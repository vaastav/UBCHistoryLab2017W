TRIAL OF GUITEAU.
On the eigiitoonth dsy pnbllo Interest In Ihe
trial was unabated, and the court-room fM
crowded notwithstanding It was the opening
day of Congress. The following eight doctors,
who hare mado a study of mental disoasos,
wore called bv the dofensei Doctors J. Q.
IUeman, Charles H. Nichols, superintendent
of the bloomingdale (New York city) insane
asylum ; Chwlos Folsom, of Boston ( Bamuol
Worcester, of Salem, Mass.; W. W. Oolding,
superintendent cf the govomment insane asy
lum at Washington; James 1L Mclirido, of
Milwaukee; Walter Channing, of Brookline,
Ultra.; and Theodore W. Fisher, of Boston.
A hypothetical qnostion, in which tho points
relating to the prisoner's mental condition as
sot forth bv the dofonse, including the insanity
in his family, and his alleged belief that he
aoted upon inspiration, wore assumed to be
ma rmrl tn the fnrnffninT and thov were
asked whether upon the state of things
they thought Guitean was insane. Seven of
them repuoa tuai n me propusiuoiu, no u
tho man was insano. Dr. Worcester would no)
txpross an opinion, becauso ho wanted I
nxnlanation of the word Inspiration tha
Itr. ScoTUle gave him. Gnitcau constantly
rter.irea in mo prucceuiugH. o ucguu u.y
sarin? that he wanted the experta to pass npon
tho question whether when a man claims he is
impcllod to do an illegal act by a power beyond
him he is sane or insane. He showed a protty
clear understanding of the testimony given, and
once pointed out how well it fitted his case. Aa
usual ho was Bensitivo on tho question of his
mental powors, and was angry when
a witness stoke diBConraeingly of his Gar
field speech, declaring he would rather be
nangRd as a sonsiDie man man auqiuueu
t r it fool, lie was also attended by a Question
Implying that he was a vulgar criminal. There
was nothing vulgar about this case, he ei
rlaimed ; it was all high-toned. At the end of
Ihe dav's proceedings, when Mr. Sooville an
lonnced that ho expected to have President
Arthur as a witness, Guitean insisted that
3encral Grant, cx-Senatora Conkling and Tlatt.
tx-Govornor Jowoll and others should bo called
tn 1mw what was the political situation before
the assassination. He also suggested that
President Arthur would do well to appoint
Smory A. Btorrs as attorney-general.
Tho first w itness called for the defense on
ffio nineteenth day was Congressman Charles
B. Farwcll, of Chicago, who tostifled that he
bad bad one or two interviews witn uuitcan,
and regarded him as insano; but on cross-ex
amination he said Guitean could distinguish
betwoen right and wrong. After a short exam
ination of George C. Gorham, editor of the
Washington Republican, during which
Guitean constantly and violently interrupt
ed and asked questions, at ono time
saying that his counsel, Sir. Scoville, was
"getting cranky on this business." tho dofense
closed, Mr. Scovillo saying, however, that he
expected some testimony from President Arthur
and Dr. Bpitzka. Mr. Scovillo explained that
what ho wanted to show by tho President's tes
timony was that in October last Guitean wroto
him a letter on public business, and he im
plied that ho regarded this lottor as proof of
ihe prisoner's insanity. It was arranged that
Ho should sena written quostions to tho I'resi
dent. During tho close of tho session a curious
scene occurred when Mr. Scoville proceeded to
read from Guiteau's book, "Truth." Mr. Scovillo
eaid he would have to read tho whole book,
and ho was boginning to do so when the
ririsonor called out to him: "Do not read it
ike a schoolboy. Read it with some spirit."
Thereupon Mr. Scovillo proposed that tho
Erie oner himself should do the reading, and
e proccoded to do so, with rather a poor effort
at declamation and with occasional illustrative
remarks, such as, " That is the way that Paul
got in his work." When a slight diaturbanco
was caused by some of the spectators trying to
get out, the prisoner commanded ordor and
said: " Some of this book is interesting. It is
rood religious talk. It will do people good to
hear it read." After about threo-quartcrs of au
hour spent in this way tho district-attorney in
tervened, representing that this was a war-'to of
Ihe time of tho court, and as the result o(
some discussion it was agreed that Mr. Scoville
should tho next day mark tho portions of the
book to which ho proposed to call tho attention
of tho jury.
Gniteau began proceedings on tho twentieth
day by declaring himBelf dissatisfied with the
development of the facts relating to the politi
cal situation, wherein lay Uie gist of tho al
legod offense, and he renewed his demand for
tho testimony of Grant, Conkling, Piatt,
"and those kind of men." lie announced
also his purpote to make the dosing
snoech for the defense. No answer hav
ing been received from the half-dozen
3uooUono aulimittod in writing to 1'rnni
ent Arthur the couit said that the defense
should have tho benefit of this testimony when
obtained. Guiteau disclaimed a wish to bring
the Prosidont into court, expressing a high re
gard for him and claiming tho credit of havii.g
mane mm rrcsment. 'ine prosecution called
to the witness stand Genoral W. T. Sherman,
who identified the letter that was placed in
bis bauds after the shootinsr written bv Gui
teau, and said that he suspected at the
timo that thcro might be a conspiracy,
but afterwards ho concluded that
tho shooting was tho act of ono man. Guiteau
hero thanked tho general for protecting him
with tho military, at which the warrior smiled
grimly. Tho pioseoution then put upon the
witness stand ten citizens of Frecport, 111., who
icBiiucci to tneir intlmato acquaintanoo with
tho assassin's father, and declared their belief
in his perfoct sanity, which they never hoard
questioned until after July 21ast Their names
are Edward P. Barton, a lawyer; A. T. Green, a
collector; G. W. Tandy, boot and shoe dealer;
JJr. v. 1. uuckiey, who had been
the family physician of Guiteau's father; 8. D.
Atkins, editor Freenort Jtevublican: J. 8.
Cochran, a lawyer; G. W. Oiler, a justice of the
roace; A. A. Babcock, a lawyer; State Senator
u. u. Hunttonaua, ana uoraca raruox, capital
ist. Wbilo ono of these witnesses was being
examined, the prisoner took occasion to com
ment upon the President's message, saving:
"I am glad that General Arthur has rapped
those miserable Mormons, and I hope he will
. do it again. I want him to make it a specialty
of his administration to destroy Mormonisni,
The message shows that he is a very fine man
in his administration. I expect he will give us
tho best administration we have ever had. The
message has the true ring to it"
Uuituau camo into court on the twenty-first
day escorted in tho usual fashion-an officer
walking in front, a secoud one behind him,
holding him by his left arm, under which there
was a bundle of newspapors, and behind still
another officer. Tho day was more exciting
than any recent day of the trial, and the mass
of evidence taken was exceedingly damaging
to the defense. The first witness called was
Mrs. Julia M. Wilson, a cousin of the assassin,
a daughter of tho Mrs. Julia Maynard whom
the defense had sought to make out insane.
Mrs. Maynard was a sister of Luther W.
Guiteau, the assassin's father, and the purpose
of the defense was, of course, to Bhow parallel
oases of insanity in that generation of the
Guiteaus. Tho witnoss eulogized her mother
with a quivering voico, and testified that she
had never seen the slightest trace of flightiness
in her conduct. In the course of her testimony
Mik. Wilson stated that her father was lneaue
bofore he died, and this led to scene between
the assassin and his brother. John W. Guiteau
rose, and addressing the court asked that the
question and answer be stricken out as irrele
vant. He protested against having things of
this kind, not affecting any blood relation of
the prisoner, go out to the world. The dis
trict attorney intimated that the testimony was
valuable as showing that if Abby Maynard (one
of the two members of the Guiteau family who
have been members of insane asylums) was in
sane, she probably inherited insanity from her
father. Mr. Scoville was now on his foet,
angrily objecting to any interference by John
W. Guiteau. This fired the assassin at once.
"I think he's a perfect nuisance," he
shouted, banging his fist on the table in front
of him, while his eyca gleamed hatefully.
"He'd better go back to Boston. I haven't
known anything about him for years. He
just crawled into this case, and he's try
ing to got a little notoriety out of me. I never
recognized him aa a brother. He's not of coun
sel in this case and don't know anything."
Several other witnesses next gave testimony
tending to disprove the plea of insanity. This
displeased Guitean, who accused some of the
witnesses of bias, and claimed that the testi
mony of others was irrelevant. President Ar
thur's reply to the written questions sent him
by Mr. Scoville waa read. The President
said be had seen Guitean at least ten
and perhaps twenty times, but had no
conversation with him eioept to
return the ordinary salutations, and
once or twioe in answer to
his request to be employed as a speaker by the
Republican State committee, of which he was
chairman. Guiteau had never rendered any
political service that the President knew of to
the Republican party in the last campaign.
There was nothing in the prisoner's relation to
himself or to General Grant or Senator Conk
ling or any other leader of the Republican
party, socially or politically, to give him any
grouud for supposing he would receive polit
ical preferment, and he had never given Gui
teau any reason to think he could have any po
litical or personal influence with him. The
President added thai in October last lie re-1
eeived a letter from Guitean, containing tome
claim to having rendered important set vices to
the Republican Trty, and an appeal for the
postponement of his trial. Ho did not preserve
the letter. The Rev. Dr. Mc Arthur, of New
xorK city, or whose church Guiteau and his
wife wore members several yoars ago, de
scribed his acquaintance with the assai sin and
the circumstances under which Guitoau was ex
pelled from the church. The prisoner alter
nately contradicted this witness outright and
addressed him with an air of familiarity.
On the twenty-second day the proceedings
began with the continuation of the examina
tion ol the Rov. Dr. MmArtliur, of Now York,
who testified that he had seen no indications
of unsoundness in Guitean. The prisoner, as
usual, constantly interrupted and used
aousive language, at one moment snowing
anger at tho witness, at another making an on
slaught on a local reporter, and then again at
tacking District-Attorney Corkhitl, saying : "If
your record was dug up, colonel, it would stink
woree than mine. 1 understand you are booked
for removal. Yon had better go slow. The
President is only waiting to get this thing off
his mind before you get your ticket-of-leave. I
want the absolute truth about this." Stephen
English, of New Y'ork, editor and proprietor of
tho Insurance Tune, next detailed all the cir
cumstances connected with the prisoner,
procuring bail for him while ho was
in Ludlow Street jail on a charge ol
libel. Ho was interrupted at cvory
stop of his narrative by the prisoner
ejaculating! "That is not true;" "Confine
yoursolf to the facts, English ; " "He got me
arrested by actual perjury; " "That is abso
lutely false. I can convict yon that you are
lying. There is not an insuranco presidont in
New Y'ork who does not know that you are a
first-class fraud ;" "That is the biggest lie you
have spoken. Why, I would not spit on you in
the street, yon old scoundrel:" "The insur
ance presidents of Now Y'ork would not believe
yon under oath, you old fraud." In reply to
the question whether he had any doubt as to
the sanity of the prisoner, the witness said :
" Novor. On the contrary, he appeared to be a
man of remarkable keenness ol intellect, be
causo ho completely outwitted me. He waa
shrewd, active, Intelligent lawyer." Several
New Y'ork lawyers woro then examined, and
testified eithor as to the. prisoner's
sanity or rascality, Guiteau con
tinually interrupting in bis usual abusivo
stylo. Judge Hawes, of the New York marine
court, in whoso oftico the prisoner occupied a
desk in 1871, testified that they had never seen
any indication of unsoundness of mind in
Guitoau. Senator Benjamin Harriion. of In
diana, testified that tho prisoner asked him in
Washington last spring to help him get office,
but tho witness told him he was already
overloauou witti applications irom ins own
State. Ho had never questioned Gui
teau's sanity. Guitean patronizingly said of
Senator Hnnison: "iouare a good lellow,
Senator. I remember yon very woll. Our con
versations were generally social." Tho wxt
witness was Isaac F. IJoyd, of New Y'ork, sec
retary of the Mutual Life Insurance company.
Ho presonted applications for insuranco -four
from John W. Guiteau. two from the pris
oner, and one from the prisoner's father. The
point mado was that those applications con
tained negative answers to the question whetbor
there was insanity in the family. Upon objec
tion by prisoner's counsel the court excluded
the applications of the prisoner's
father and brother. But the great
sensation of tho day was created
when D. McLean Shaw, a Now York lawyor in
whose office Guiteau had a desk ten years ago,
testified that tho prisoner told him iu 1872 that
ho (Guitean) was bound to be notorious before
ho diod ; that if ho could not get notoriety for
good, he would got it lor evil ; mat no wouiu
shoot some Of our big men, and would imitato

spectators felt how completely it ntteu tiiepop.
ular conception of the assassin's character, i
profound sensation was visible. The assassin
was beside himself with excitement. "You

he said, with a grin of pure malice; " I'll show
you up." The assassin went on to pour out a
torrent of abuse on tliowitnesn, which lasted
almost without a break through both tho direct
and croBB-cxamination. Mr. Scoville did his
best to break tho effect of thn evidence by
showing that Mr. Shaw had not allowed the ex
pression of euch eentiments to alter his rela-
tions with Gniteau, but tho witness explained
that he had not really supposed the niun would
tlo what lie said.

Christmas roast meat done to a turn,
Before, however, sitting down to the
festal meal, some further rites had to be
performed. First, the Domachitza, tak
ing with her a dish containing corn, a
cup of wine and a pomegranate, begged
me to accompany her to the cattle stall,
She then entered the stall set apart for
the goats, ana Having nrst sprinkled
them with coin, took the wine cup in

born. Mavst thou be healthy. I drink

granate ; majstthou meet with all good
luck 1 " She thon lifted the cup to her
lips, too a sip, tossed the pomegranate
over the herd, and throwing her arms
around the she-goat, uttered a blessing.
At the end of the service the beauti
ful old Slav rite, called the " Peace of
God," was performed by the whole con
gregation. Every one approached his
neighbor and kissed him or her on both
cheeks, saying, " Hristos se rodi "
(Christ is born)!" To this the other
replied: va istinu se rodi (Of a troth

and this was repeated till each had
kissed and been kissed by all present.

A simple test is to cork up a 6mall
bottle nearly full of it, in which a piece
of lump sugar has been put. If by
thus excluding the air and letting it
stand in the light for two or three days
there is not a milky cloud seen, but the
water remains clear, it may be consid
ered free from the phosphates with
which sewage water is impregnated.
To ascertain if water contains iron, take
a glass ol water aud add to it a few
drops of the infusion of nntgalls, or
suspend a nutgall in it by means of a
thread for twenty-four hours. If iron
be present, the water will become of a
dark-brown or black color. Prussiate
of potash is a still more delicate test
for detecting iron. If a crystal, or a
drop of it, when dissolved, be added to
a glass of water containing iron, it will
immediately become of a blue color.
To ascertain if water contains magne
sia, take a quantity of the water, and
boil down to a twentieth part of its
bulk; then drop a few grains of car
bonate of ammonia into a small glass
of water. Mo magnesia will yet be pre
cipitated; but on adding a small quan
tity of phosphate of soda, if any magne
sia ba present it will then make its ap
pearance and fall to the bottom of the
glass, in this experiment it is neces
sary that the carbonate of ammonia be
in a neutral state.

FACTS ABOUT UMBRELLAS.
Antiquarians sny that the umbrella was In
rented shortly afler the .lood, nml Iirs been the
least Improved upon of all appliances for human
comfort, the .shue beiiiu now as Huns in those
youthful days of the world. An umbrella is
much like a pigeon ns to tho question of posses
sion the )ut one who ci ts it owns it. The fol
lowing facts about umbrellas especially the last
one may servo every reuder a splendid purpose
sooner or Inter: To pWo your umbrella in a ruck
indieatcsithat it Is about to rbnnRC owners. An
umbrella enrried over a woman, the man petting
nothing but drippings of the rnin.indiratcseourt
shlp. When the man lins the umbrella and the
woman the drippings, It indicates ninrrince. To
curry it at right angles under your arm signifies
that an eye is to be lost by the man w ho fallows
you. To put a cotton umbrella by the fideofaniec
silk one signifies that " exchange is no robbt'rv."
To lend an umbrella signifies that "1 am a fail."
To carry an umbrella lust high enough to tear
out men eyes and knock off men's hats, signifies
" I am a woman." To go without an umbrella
In a rain-storm shows I am sure of getting rheu
matism, and will have to use St. JacousOii, to
get well." To keep a fine umbrella for your own
use and a bottle of Et. Jacobs Oil always in the
house, in case of rheumatism or accident, would
equity mut juu arc rcui puuo&opuvr.
The following communication to the editor of
the Salem (Mass.) Jtenietcr shows how an artist
treated hisvisitor: 41 1 would have accepted your
kind invitation to visit you in your new qunrters
w ith pleasure before Hits hud not my old enemy,
.nr. itneumaiism, pounccn on me fo sunueniy.
He arrived lost Friday, and, without stopping to
send up his curd, rushed la and grasped mcby
the hand with such a grip that in a few hours
my hand and wrist were so badly swollen and
painful that I felt as though one of Mr. Hatch's
coal teams had run over me. Mr, Rheumatism
has been a constant visitor of niino for several
years ; be always swells and put on a great many
airs, making himself at home, devouring my sub
stance aud leaving mc poor in flesh and pocket.
Ijist winter be came and stayed two mouths. I
then decided that the next time he came I would
change bis diet. I was somewhat at a loss w bnt
to feed him with, but finally concluded to give
him three tquare meals a day of St. JacobsOii
morning, noon and night. This face bo is dis-
f usted w ith, and is paekingnp bis trunk and w ill
cave by to-morrow or next day; says he cannot
(top any longer, as he has pressing business else
where. Ho is a treacherous fellow, and he in
tends visiting some of our t-alera friends; if he
docs, just give himthesumefurctb.it I did and
he won't stop long. J. S. Lefayovr.

The friends ot tbe Davenport (Iowa)
Academy of Soiences claim that that
institution possesses the on It evidence
that has yet been discovered that the
mysterious monnd builders had s writ
ten language. It has in its museum
two inscribed tablets which were found
in some of the mounds, and which have
attracted attention from American and
European archreologists. Mr. Prett,
late president of tne academy, believes
that the evidence of the genuineness of
the inscriptions is sufficient, but the
fact must be regarded as still very much
in question.
