Frederic J. Easkln; L'iector, Washing
ton. r. C.
Senator Curtis has taken a firm
atand against the setting; up of a num
ber of boards and commissions, as pro
vided In the railroad bills, now pend
ing In congress. His attitude probably
will be approved by a large majority
of his constituents. The senator holds,
quita properly, that the in erests of the
government, the public and the em
ployes and owners of the roads can
be handled as well by one commission
as by half a dozen, to say nothing of
the saving1 of money and time.- While
the Interstate commerce commission
has made a mess of the transportation
business in the past. It la by no means
certain that another commission, or
several commissions," would do any
better. It Is a case in which it may
be better to bear the ills we have than
fly to others we know not of. The
tendency in the states recently has
been toward a reduction in the num
ber of boards thru .elimination and
consolidation. The provisions of tbe
pending; railroad bills have the appear
ance of a move- backward.
The silver lining in the coal strike
cloud may not appear nntil the flat
dweller who owns a piano begins to
break it up for fuel.
Isn't it about time for the Mexicans,
either to kidnaip or arrest Jenkins
again? Their dealings with the United
States probably afford them almost as
much amusement as a bull fight. An
other prod of the bull seems due.
Gold has become a drug on the
market. It no longer pays to dig
3.22 grains of gold out of the ground
for a dollar, and that Is all the miner
can get for it, so he has quit and gone
Into other business where he can
charge more and get it.
Contrasting the manner In which
Carranza has permitted Americans to
be murdered, robbed, and outraged,
with tha celerity with which a British
citizen wa let loose upon a peremp
tory demand from the British govern
ment, the parallel speaks volumes in
condemnation of the policy of the ad
ministration. The. Mexican situation
promises to be an Issue In the ap
proaching political campaign over
shadowing even the League of Nations.
President Wilson la opposed to start
ing anything In Mexico. Evidently he
wants to be off with the old war be
fore being on with the new.
Probably the coal strike will be the
last big walkoat by labor for a long
time. Recent lessons must have taught
workers the truth that strikes do
not pay. Reports by the bureau of
labor statistics show something of the
magnitude of this disturbance of in
dustry. During the months of April.
May and June last, the building trades
led the list in the number of strikes,
furnishing 200 out of a total of 974
of these activities. Metal trades were
next with 1 7 strikes, while textiles
and clothing furnished 78 and 57 re
spectively. Lumber and timber added
It to the list.
Unfortunately for the Interest of all
the people, one phase of our industrial
or labor problem is being threshed out
to the practical exclusion of all others.
This Is the share to be allotted to la
bor out cf the Income resulting from
productive effort- Included in this
struggle is the -question of wages,
hours of toll, working conditions, par
ticipation in profits and management,
and other features affecting produc
tion. The question of the distribution
of Income Is not the most Important,
one that faces us today. The big prob
lem, the proper solution of which
lone can save the world from the
rlims of wretchedness, is production.
It may be good strategy from the
standpoint of class egoism to fight for
wage Increases while employers are
struggling with desperation to turn out
good's they have agreed lo deliver,
when demand is keen and .competent
help is .scarce. The threat of a strike
is bound to carry- weight when a
manufacturer is booked months ahead,
when he knows that frantic buyers
place primary consideration on the
question of delivery. Demands that
reach the extreme of uneconomic ab
surdity may be granted in, whole or in
part under such conditions. But labor
gains little or nothing by such tactics.
The reaction upon the general public
contains the elements of tragedy.
good piece op wonx.
,The news-criticism of the police de
partment In The State Journal Tues
day evening, calling attention to the
many "punch board" gambling devices
operating in the city despite the gov
erning city ordinances, brings to mind
the fact that It is only human to criti
cise and not commend.
The so-called, "punch boards" are in
violation of the ordinances, to be sure,
but It must be admitted that if the
police are out hunting thieves, bandit
and other criminals end have found
it necessary to neglect petty gambling
devices, the department is ridding the
city of a much greater evil.
In the same spirit "Wf calling atten
tion to the lottery The State Journal
gladly offers a somewhat tardy com
mendation to the police department
for the capture of the man who made
the sensational ,10,000 theft from the
National hotel.
This newspaper has been responsi
ble for many severe comments on ac
tions of the police department of the
present and former city administra
tions. On this account The State Jour
nal wants to play strictly fair and be
generous with commendations when
Chief Hannan deserves them.
The coal miners staged their strike
November 1 In the belief that they
could win quickly by freezing the peo
ple. They were mistaken. If they
had struck last spring they might
have succeeded. At that time they
only would have tied up the industries
of the country. Coal operators then
had many contracts outstanding, to
furnish coal regardless of strikes. They
would have granted the miners' de
mands and charged sthe costs up to
the unprotected industries, which
would have passed them on to their
customers. In ther efforts to make
success doubly certain, the miners
failed and brought not only their or
ganisation, but labor unions generally,
into bad repute. Strikes never again
will be won so easily as they have
been In the past.
i
" CAN WE HAVE PEACE?
There are Indications that Governor
Allen will recommend to the legisla
ture, at the special session, which he
has called, the enactment of a law
establishing a court of industrial re
lations. This is something that has
been uaged by The State Journal as a
possible reme ly for existing conditions
in the industrial field.
A workable law must apply impar
tially to both employer and employe.
The court should be empowered to en
force the fulfillment of contracts be
tween labor and capital, just as other
contracts are enforced. Either party
should have the right to bring the
other before the court when a dispute
arises. When a case arising under the
law has been adjudicated, the court
must have the power to enforce its
decree. Refusal to obey the court's
mandate must be subject to punish
ment by fine, imprisonment or both,
to be imposed on those responsible
for such refusal.
There wlll remain the possibility
that large bodies of men will refuse
to work in obedience to the court's
order as in the case of the coal min
ers. In such case the leaders and the
treasury of their organization must
pav thepenalty.
On the other hand, employers may
decide to close their plants rather than
obey the order of the court. In ad
dition to being punished for contempt,
they can be made to turn their prop
erty over toa'receiver who will keep
it in operation, until they change their
minds.
This program, or any other along
similar lines, may fail to work satis
factorily, but something of the sort
seems worth a trial.
But a disposition on the part of em
ployer and employe, to deal squarely
with each other, will do more to bring
about industrial peace than all the
laws that can be placed on the statute
book. The time has arrived when the
public is about to Insist on its own
protection, and if either labor or cap
ital find Itself In a worse position than
before, it has only Itself to blame.
Congressman Kelley, of Michigan,
i has introduced a bill intended to make
more effectual the curbing of Red
activities.' It provides additional pen
alties for conspiring to overthrow the
government by imposing a fine of
$5,000 upon conviction, or imprison
ment -not to exceed five years, or both.
After the expiration of sentence aliens
are to be deported. Th annual report
of the department of labor, submitted
to congress on the opening day of the
new session, discloses the fact that out
of 697 radical aliens arrested during
the last two years on deportat.on war
rants, only sixy were actually sent
back across -he ocean. These figures
do not include the recent arre-ts In
organized raids thruout the country.
But what would be the object in keep
ing a Red shut up in jail five years
at an expense to the taxpayers? And
w here would one of them get 15.000?
If TresiVnt Wilson finally decides
to encage this country In a war with
Mexico, he cannot say that the United
States senate pushed him in.

Washington, D. C.
PRESIDENTIAL: SPECIFICATIONS.
Washington, D. C Dec. 8. What
! has become of that seventh son of a
seventh son who can always tell you
a year ahead who is going 'to be the
next president?
He is gone, along with the politi
cal logic upon which he based his
Judgment. It used to be argue-1 hot
because a man lived in .Ohio, had an
Irish grandmother, fought In the Civil
war, and hud never stated a definite
pinion avbout anything, he was un
beatable. And often he was.
The presidential virtues for a Ions
time, were chiefly negative. of
course, very early In "our history we
had some remarkable presidents. In
ihat day we had an intellectual aris
tocracy. It led us to .success in the
revolutionary war, and furnished our
political leaders for a generation or
so afterward. Of this crew were
Washmg'tn, Adams and Jefferson.
Hut with tho growth of the demo
cratic Idea came the demagogue, and
the mediocrity in the presidential
chair. The rugged figure of Jackson
sta-nd.s out a great demagogue but a
demagogue none the lens Admirable
ir. hie, courage but terrible -n his ?g-noi-mce.
Then came the Civil vxr,
stranui-ly produrlng its own genius in
Lincol!!, a being unaccountable and
unty.Hv
After the Civil war, our strange na
tional sport of presidential politics
reach sd its highest development.
Presidential candidates were nothing
but pawns used by the great parties
in the game which they .played for the
stakes of office and power. Men were
chosen because they were "safe."
Mediocrity was a prime qualification.
A man with a marked personality,
marked achievement or marked in
any other way was not wanted. That
a brilliant individuality like that of
Cleveland reached the presidency in
spite of this system was an accident
which politicians deplored.
It is only in the last gei1 ?ratlrn that
the presidency has been rescued from
mediocrity. President Roosevelt
taught' the people to regard the pres
ident as their personal representative,
and not merely as the mouthpiece of a
political party, and of the interests
which dominate it. Mr. Wilson has
carried this idea of the president as
the official interpreter of the public
still further. Both of them have
shown that there is still room in the
presidency for a real personality.
Another thing which has perished
recently is political oratory of the old
spread-eagle and sentimor.tal school. It
is still practiced in the south to some
extent, and in back counties generally;
but it is no longer, as it once was, a
presidential sine qua non. Nc man is
going to win the presidency this time
on the strength of his perorations.
Who will get the nomination is a mys
tery, but certainly neither of them will
be captured by a "cross of gold and
crown of thorns" speech.
Thus,, while it is hard to pick the
individual who will be the next presi
dent, it is not hard to pick the type.
The man will not be a professional
politician, a mediocrity foisted on the
public by his fellow professionals. It
will not make so much difference
where he lives. A record of public
office will not help him much, but a
record of practical achievement will
help him a great deal. And he will
not be a sentimentalist, a tear squeez
er, one who weeps and bellows and
waves the riag. The type of the next
president is well represented In the
leading candidates, and men men
tioned in connection with the candi
dacy. Two of these men are especial
ly significant. Hoover and McAdoo.
Perhaps neither of them will even run.
but the mere fact that these two have
been widely mentioned for the presi
dency, and have been more or less ac
cepted by the people as men of a type
who. might make good presidents. Is
iremenaousiy significant. It is claimed
of McAdoo that he has a brilliant rec
ord as a political executive, but Hoov
er has been in no way associated with
politics.
The fact that a Hoover of unknown
politics had' even been mentioned for
the presidency is striking proof that
the public mind of the United States
has changed. Twenty-five years ago,
when a Prince Albert coat and a Wide
black hat, and the ability to thunder
out platitudes n a baritone voice were
almost essentials of political success.
Hoover would have been as out of
place in politics as a bricklayer in a
cabaret. Here is a man who has
wealth and cares nothing for the ma
terial success involved; who shows no
slightest craving for publicity for its
own sake; who does not seem to rep
resent a class or a. point of view; who
has nothing to recommend him for
the job except a capacity for handling
large enterprises and an integrity that
seems not to be questioned by anyone.
Me is a stranger in our political arena,
and ehe fact that we allow him to be
there at all is proof that we are chang
ing.
' In the forefront of Republican can
didates stands Gen. Leonard Wood, of
another type, but none the" less quite
different from the candidate Drand of
the pasti His campaign is not being
made on the basis of his helm? a mili
tary hero but upon the claim that he
is a proven executive, a man who gets
things done.
The American president for the next
four years will find his task logically
dividing itself Into two Kreat respon
sibilites that of meeting the- indus
trial situation at home, and of giving
America its proper international posi
tion in a re-made world. The indus
trial situation at home is a matter of
primary interest to the public. It is
i The George Matthew Adams
DIGXITT.
There will always be something pe
culiarly fine about . the worker or
thinker who plants a certain dignity
underneath all that he-does.
To be dignified just as a pose or as
a matter of fact, is to defeat the rea
son for dignity.
For dignjty must accompany a personality-
man or woman who has
deserved well of life. Not to hold dig
nity as a great asset is to belittle one's
personality and cast a shadow upen
worth.
The one who feels responsibility is
always accompanied by a wplendld
dignity.
But to be dignified is not to be snob
affecting every man, woman and" child
because It has to do with the dally
supply of food and clothing for each
and everyone.1 Upon the handling of
that situation depend such issues as
the pYesence of fire in the grate, the
oneration of the transportation .-facili-
Fties of the nation, the chance of the
Individual to work that his children
may live the very continuance of the
government itself. .
And thin is not the onlyf problem.
The shelves of the world are empty
World industry has .been paralyzed
for half a decade, and will be sorely
handicapped -for years to come. The
-United States, of all nations, has
emerged from the war with enormous
industrial capacities, and with un
limited financial resources. For her
the door of opportunity is wide open,
and for her there Is no bar to entrance.
Whether or not she makes the best of
this, her golden day for gaining a
trade foothold in the marts of-the
world, will depend largely upon the
administration of her affairs .for the
next four years. "
The public is coming to an appre
ciation of these vital facts. The
friends one meets' at home, the men
he talks to on railroad trains, the edi
torials he reads in newspapers, cause
him to realize that there is a knowl
edge abroad in the land of the respon
sibilities that will rest upon the next
chief executive. Old fashioned poli
tics are in eclipse. The old issues be
tween the . parties do not hold good.
Where the Democrats were accus
tomed to so deport themselves as to
ne regarded as the party particularly
friendly to organized labor, they are
today arrayed in a titanic contest with
certain groups of that element.'
While the Republicans were of old
the party of expansion, the party that
favored America's stepping boldly
forth and assuming its share of world
influence and world responsibility,
they are today the party advocating
the doctrine of magnificent isolation.
The old issues are turned topsy turvy.
There are no new ones to take their
place. Both parties promise to write
platforms based largely on American
ism and differing little.
So the situation is developing In
such a way that the candidate is the
matter of dominating interest.' The
parties-are following the publio in their
expression of desire to find just the
right sort of man to handle the big
Job ahead. .

Evening Story
, A Little Dog's Day.
BY H. LEWIS RATBOLD.
Just before -Jim Houston went to
France ho took ltts most valued pos
session In his arms and had a heart to
heart talk with him, "Uttle dog," he
(said, "I'm off to war and, while I'm
away, I m going to give you to the
dearest girl in the world. I can't ask
her to be mine, yet me, a poor duffer
with no prospects but don't you let
anybody else have her until I'm back
and get in the game again!" So say
ing, he sat down the thorobred
littl Boston terrier and, putting on
his leash, took him to Betty Lancas
ter. . '
"Here, Betty," he said, "is a re
minder of me! But, joking aside,
I hope once in a while he will make
you think, of somebody who, even if
he's getting a whack at the boches,
will be thinking of you all the time."
','Oh, the darling," cried Betty, get
ting down on her knees and fondling
the doe, who did not object in the
J least. "Indeed, I don't need anything
to remind me of you, but I love him
already and will take the best of care
of him until you come back," she con
cluded wistfully. This- old school
chum's going off meant more than
she dared let herself think. "I'll write
you and knit for you--and "
Jim wanted to say the words that
trembled, on his lips, but he had had it
out with himself the night before, that
he would not deem himself a man to
bind this girl when the future was so
uncertain. So now, "Good-bye, Betty,
girl," was all he permitted himself,
and one last touch of her hand. His
last glance back showed him Betty
standing, with her saddened eyes, hold
ing fast the leash of his dog.
Now he was back home. When
peace had come, he had thought joy
fully that now he could get back to
Betty. She had kept her word, and
i knitted socks and mufflers and a
sweater, and when he had written her
of his promotion to top sergeant, she
had replied how. glad she was and
added that she had named the little
dog "Sergeant."
Jim, thru a lucky chance, was able
to return ahead of his regiment with
a company of casuals. Betty did not
know of his arrival in this country and
he had no time to notify her. When,
uoon reaching camp, he found that he
could have a three days' furlo, he
decided to surprise her her whom he
would now dare to ask to marry nim.
For, even starting at the bottom as he
would have to, the wait could not be
very long with such a goal to strive
for.
It was dusk when Jim got off the
train at Bolton. He had to stop for a
word with the station agent and then
was waylaid along the way uptown to
Betty's home by welcoming irienas.
When at last the well-remembered
stretch of maple trees cams in view
shading the Lancaster lawn, Tiis heart
beat unmanageably.
As he drew nearer, he heard the
laughter and gay voices of young peo
ple sounding from the Lancaster
porch. He felt a twinge of disappoint
ment at having to see his sweetheart
before so many. Already he looked
upon her as that very thing his sweet
heart.
Wondering whether to go away and
come back later, or at the worst, early
next morning, Jim walked more slow
ly. As he reached the gate he heard
a voice he recognized as that of Billy
Van Norden, a schoolmate of his who
had been wounded and sent home.
Van Norden was saying: "When
Toots and I are- marnea, you u nave
to be very clever to bother us. No
rice and old shoes for us. eh. Toots?"
A merry girl's laugh followed. But he
could not quite cateh it. Who was
Toots?
Then another voice broke in, "Hear
the man Utlking already about getting
married and he and Betty have only
been engaged two days!" More
laughter.
Jim's heart the heart which had
carried him unafraid thru patrols on
No Man's Land and over the top
almost failed him now.
Betty engaged Betty engaged
Betty engaged! He leaned against
the fence for support. Was she fas
cinated by Van Norden's lieutenant's
uniform or the 'fact that he waa
wounded or no, that wasn't fair.
(thought honest Jim. Billy Van Nor-
'den was a dandy fellow. He deserved
a corking girl. But nis Betty:
Why had she not written? But they
had only been engaged two days! He
was two days too late, provided things
hadn't gotton too far before that. He
hadn't dreamed .
Well, he would go away ft unob
trusively as he had come back to
camp and then anywhere but Bolton.
He might sign up for the regular
armv. Ha might
What was this bounding down to
the gate? "Good old doggie," whis-pered-Jim.
"Good old doggie!" a sus
picious moisture gathered in his eyes.
This was the little dog she had played
with, had named for him. "fkirgeant,
you couldn't keep her for me, could
you, old boy?"
"Here. Sargie, here Sargie!" he
heard Betty's dear voice calling.
He tried to send the dog back, but
Sergeant, overjoyed at this glimpse of
his master, would not be driven away!
He frisked about Jim's feet,, jumped
up and licked his hands, and barked
joyously.
"I must see what that Cog is up to."
said Betty, and before Jim realized it,
she was down the path and at the
gate, searching for the cause of the
dog's excitement.
What she saw made her step back
quickly, her hand on her throat.
There stood Jim looking wistfully,
hungrily at her.

"Give you a hint, what?" asked Bet

thought was thousands of miles away.
"That you were getting engaged,"
said Jim reproachfully.
"But rm not!" she cried. "I'm not!"
"Then what did Billy Van Norden
mean?" said Jim, bewildered In xhis
turn.
A light was beginning to break on
Betty's perplexity. "Oh," she said,
"well, I wrote you that my cousin
from out West was here on her first
visit, didn't it?"
"Yes," said Jim. "But I don't
see "
"Did I mention her name?"
"I don't remember."
' "Well It's Elisabeth, the same as
mine. We were born on the same
day and our mothers gave us the
same tame. So she Is Betty, too.
Cousin L'etty Is engaged to Billy Van
Norden."
Jim took a step toward her. "For
give me. Betty," he said. "I thought of
course it was you. and I was all broken
up. You see ever since we went to
high school together, you've been my
girl. I've come to tell you so. Wlli

SANDRA THE JEALOUS
By JANE
A DISTRESSING NIGHT.
CHAPTER CXVIII. '
I ljad put the note, Everett had
written Leola In the long ago, away
intending not to look at It again, at
least not for soma time. But almost
immediately after Everett left, I had
taken It from the hiding place and
once more agonized over it. .
Among other things he had said:
"You say you can't believe I love
you as I say I do. You are my heaven.
I have nothing in the world that is
dear to me but you. my dearest dear.
When I think of you my soul Is rav
ished, my limbs tremble." Etc. I
could scarcely realize that .my digni
fied middle-aged husband ever had
penned such sentiments; yet here they
were in his handwriting, signed, by
him.
Two or three times during that long
evening did I put the note away, de
termined not to look at it again; and
as many times did I take it out again,
with tears and a terrible heart-ache,
read It over and over.
Every jealous, bitter thought I had
had sine I married, welled up in my
heart strong than ever. Even the
banishment of the picture ceased to
mean anything. Perhaps he had taken
it down because of baby? He was so
pleased that I had given him a son.
he had been willing to remove Leola's
picture? It was because of his de
light In hia boy not lor me.
Then I suddenly remembered I had
not seen the yjicture in the attic. What
had he done with it? I dared not go
up again at night. Since I had burned
myself by taking a candle to the attic
to satisfy my curiosity I had been -very
timid of fire and lights. There was no
gas or electricity up there. I would
have to wait until morning unless I
questioned him when he came in.
"I can't do that! He'll mistrust
something has happened." I said aloud
as I put the note away "for the last
time just before I heard his key in
the door.
I hurriedly commenced to 'undress.
been! "Jim, dear," she said, "I am
your girl and I always have been."
Jim drew her to him, and unseen
by the people on the porch who won
dered who on earth Betty was gossip
ing with, they stood for a moment in
clpse embrace.
Then Betty stooped down and pick
ed up the little dog. "If he hadn't
barked. I wouldn't have come down,
and you would have gone away and
we might never " Her look told Jim
what her lips did not say.
Jim put his arms about both dog
and girl. "Good old doggie." he cried.
"I did you an injustice. You did give
her back to me, after all!"

"No is it so late ?
"It is midnight. You look ill. I
am surprised that you are still sitting

I made no reply, simply hastened
my preparations. Had he said "wish

sobbed out i..y misery. But "orders"
simpiy made me hard and cold. So
without a word I crept into bed.
I slept little. My tortured brain re
peated again and again the words of
that love note I found pinned In Leo
la's dress. The next morning I was so
tired and languid- that I remained In
bed. Everett seemed anxious about
me, after he had eaten his breakfast,
followed Hetty to my room to see
that I ate mine. I could scarcely
swallow, but to . avoid his quest

had plunged me. I waa hot with re

HEART AND LEAUTY
PROBLEMS
BY KR8. BLIZABHTn THOMPSON'.
Dear Mrs. Thompson: I am a young
married woman with four small child
ren,, but. I do not Jovft.aa,? IrusUnnd.
I am In love with a 'man oid enough
to be my father.
I know you will think it fooli?;i,
but I lovs him with all my heart and
although he has never salt! so, I know
h returns my love. .- As the savins;
goes, "Actions speak louder than
words." He is also married and has a
family. He is an officer of the law.
W'o always spoke nnd talked, until
some time ago by my fault something
happened to vex him and he Is angry .
and does not speak always. I feel as
tho I should go . mad. I know it la '
wrong to love him. but I can't help it.
I would give anything to talk things
over with him and get things aettle.l.
aa I am very sorry for what I did.
but he never gives me a chance and
I am afraid to speak first.
Please give me- your advice. Hhall
t speak or wait for him? Things
have got ( to turn before long or I
shall go mad. DOWN HEARTED.
You over-estimate the regard the
officer has for you. He does not love
you. If he did, he would forgive you
and want to talk tot you and see you
again.
It is so foolish to think that you
aro going mad. Your love for your
Children should be great enough to
keen you from doing a dishonorable
thing. To carry on a secret love af
fair with a married man hv certainly
not honorable. Make up your mind
that you are going to be happy with
your husband and. your children. . If
you make the effort and do your part,
I am sure you will find greater hap
piness than thru selfish dishonor.
Speak to the officer as you would
to any acquaintance, but do fiot carry
on a conversation: with him.
