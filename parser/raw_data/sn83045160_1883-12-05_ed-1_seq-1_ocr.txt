What more could they want than the

He yesterday reintrodi'L-ed
his las
ssion's bill for the sn-.inrixuiinn
of po ,ypmy, wUh a few amendments tliat
liu thinks will make it; Wronger, and he
''jvred n bill for the. protection of citizens
of the Cnited States in their civil rights,
without regard t folor or previous condi
tion, by which 'e hopes to overcome the
ihjections the Supreme Court recently ex
pressed Vu its condemiiHtion of the exist
i"S ei'.il rights law as unconstitutional so
far as it a(!"ects the people of the several
V-itates, and all who are beyond the immedi
ate reach anil control of the Federal gov
ernment. Senator Wilson, it is proper to
say here, supplemented this civil rights bill
by a civil rightsamendment to the Federal
constitution. F.dmitnds also introduced a
bill for the establishment of postal teleg
raphy by the construction of four trunk
lines to connect tho several geographical
ali visions of the country with 'Washington;
these lines to bo completed by June of
J.S85; nothing in the nit to be construed
sis in any way interfering with individ
uals or ."orpoi'iitions carrying on the busi
mess f telegraphy, or operating telegraph
linH. These three bills havethe makings
'of a great ileal of gas, ami there will no
doubt be much of forensic ability expend
ed upon them before they are killed or
are pawed. ICdiuuiiils has lively times
before him, ami his friend Wilson evidently
means to share in the f in.
Wk devote a great deal of opneo thi
turning to the President's Message, which
it will be found embraces tho licst points
in the reports of the Several departments,
together with tho recommendations
made by tho -several secretaries, and
u careful review of the foreign re
Sations of the government. H is a
a'ompm-r and business-like document,
fnit t'.iero is much in it that not only the
f'" niiKTatic but the licpuhlican party will
dissent from. Indeed, the bill introduced
in the Senate yesterday by Senator Kd
iniinds providing for the construction of
lour postal telegraph lines, is in tho very
teeth of President Arthur's expressed op
position to postal telegraphy, and this no
doubt will have the consent of a
majority of tho members of lmth
houses. What Mr. Arthur says alsuit
the regulation by Congress of the inter
State tratlie by railroads will command
attention as a tribute to the sagacity of
"Mr. Itejigan, of Texas, w ho for years has
pressed this mutter upon the considera
tion of Congress with the aid of
;l majority of the Democratic members
of both lioiuvM. Tho radical measure
the President suggests for the extirpa
tion and suppression of polygamy
will challenge attention as really the
only means left the government to ne-a-omplmh
that purpose, and that will doit.
As to the taiill bill of tho M of March
last, which Arthur does not wish to see
repealed or amended, Mr. Carlisle's elec-
"tion lei the Speakership of the House is a
pUin'answer that it is to give place to one
that will distribute the burdens of
taxation more equitably and assure the
rights of the peoplo as against the monop
olists, in whose aid the present taritf bill
was passed, llvero are other points in
this message withy of notice, but they
will be taken up Und treated of from time
to time as opportunity shall oiler.
Tub election of Mr. Carlisle to the
Spcakci-Hhipof the House has called out
sis many vuricties f opinion as there are
vies on the tariff question. The mos
silly and absurd of all these is that it wit
affect the business interests of the country
(letnmeut illv, and will pave the wav for
the defeat of the Democratic party in
Is-"!. Mr. Carlisle is a conservative
statesman who, in all that ho has
ever clfected of legislation, has given
proof of his determination for
the greatest good of tho greatest number,
and he is w ise and prudent enough to
reek these results not by ultra or radical
measures, but by steady approaches on
-utilises of power, so that the economies bf
nlie country shall not lie disturbed. Just
now ho is, as all true Democrats are, for
tariff reform. That d.?s not mean the
instantaneous alxilishmcnt of the tariff
Jaw, but only its readjustment so as to
lighten tho burdens of the peoplo. The
payment of the interest on the national
debt, the maintenance of the government,
costly and much-needed public works,
ami the gradual li'piiilatioa of the public
debt call for large sums of money, larger
sums than can bo raised even by the ex
isting tarilff so that a continuance '.of the
greany reitueeu internal revenue is a
necessity. The most therefore that th
most rampant free-trader can exeet from
Mr. Carlisle and the present House, is a
revision of the taritf that shall, as we
have said, give some little relief to the
people ami at the same time distribute
'thetariif burden in a more sensible anc
fairer way than is the cose under the exist
ing law. That is all that can lie done just
now, but in doing that the Democratic
party can recover much of lost ground
and regain much of its historic prestige as
tho party of the people and for the peo
pie. under the direction of which the
Cnited States achieved its greatest glories
and expanded aud grew and thrived com'
men ially as it never has since upon tho
high seas and in its trade with foreign na
tive. The JHimocraUc party must be
come aggressive to live. It has too long
and too tamely submitted insupincnesa
to Republican dictation and initia
tive. Another four years of such
cowardly olicy and its race would end
in ignominious disaster and death. The
election of Mr. Carlisle means new life
and the revival of the latent energies of
the party ; it means a vigorous foreign as
well as liberal domestic policy, and that
this government of the people and for the
peoplo shall tie administered not for tha
READY FOB WORK.

AVashinutox, December 4. Ibmrc. Mr.
Converse said he had been requested by
Mr. Manning to ask unanimous consent
that the question of hisjiri'i;ia fiwic right
to his seat be referred to the Committee
on Elections, with instructions to report
at the earliest day tiossible.
Mr. Keifer asked that the case, of Mr.
Chalmers be also referred, and Mr. Con
verse put the request in a resolution refer
ring to the Committee on Flections all pa
jiers in the case, with instructions to report
immediately whether on the prima facie
case presented either Manning or Chal
mers are entitled to lie sworn as menii,,
pending the contest on its mer-'j., andVlot
to affect the final right & theVat. The
resolution was adon.
The delegate from the Territor ies a
peared at Clt, l,ar of tho House, and were
swil in.
Mr. Springer offered a resolution to
refer to the Committee on Flections,
when appointed, the memorial of the
memorial of the Governor of Kansas, and
others, presented yesterday, and the
papers presented to the clerk of the
House in regard to tho elation qualifica
tions of Peters, of Kansas, w ith instruc
tions to report whether Peters was
eligible; and if not, whether the con
testant, Wood, was entitled to the seat.
Adopted.
A resolution was adopted providing that
the rules of the Forty-seventh Congress
be the rules of the Forty-eighth until two
weeks from (he appointment of the Com
mittee on Pules.
The Democratic 'caucus nominees for
tho minor offices were elected pid sworn
in..
A committee consisting of Messrs. Cnr
tin, Blackburn and Hiscock was appointed
to wait upon the President and inform
him that the House was organized and
ready to receive any communication he
was pleased to transmit.
The business of drawing for seats was
proceeded with.
Upon the completion of the drawing,
Mr. Dunn offered a resolution for the ap
pointment of a committee of fifteen mem
bers, to be known as the committee to
which will bo referred propositions 'or the
improvement of rivers and hsiti'ors. Re
ferred to the Committee On Pules, when
appointed.
The Speaker appointed as the Com
mitttee on Mileage Messrs. Motilton, Well
born, J laseock, Kaney and Miller Fa.
Mr. Tucker offered a resolution, which
was referrx-d to the Committee on F.lee-tl,,p-i
when appointed, the certilieatesand
an me papers rv'.ating to the election of
the JCepreneutativo from the 1- irst District
of Virginia, with instructions to report as
early as practicable which of the rival
claimants (Mayo and (iarrison) to the
seat has a primn fm ie riiht. reserving to
the other jiartv the privilege of contesting
the case on its merits.
At this point the committee to wait
upon the President announced that the
l resilient would communicate to the
House a message in writinir.
The President's secretary at 11:05 o'clock
p.m. appeared and presented the Presi-
lent s message.
Consideration of Mr. Tucker's resolu
tion was entered upon.
Mr. Calkins contended that the urima
fnrie right was already settled by the swear-
ng oi juavo.
The previous question was seconded.
Mr. Keifer spoke in otmosition to the
resolution, contending that should it be
adopted, and (iarrison allowed a prima
jm-ic rigiu io me seal, siayo would be de
prived of all power of contest. This was
a plan by w hich a man already sworn in
could lie unseated on a prima fonV ease.
and forever deprived of the rights of con
lest. The House should hesitate ln-fore
It undertook to put any gentleman In that
position.
.Mr. .lulin S. iso asked his collea.'iie
w hether it Wns a iniestion as to w ho Tins
the firimu ftn-tr title.
Mr, 1 lleker answered yes.
Mr. Springer said he understood that
Carrison made a contest of the primn fnrie
rignt as well as the rnrht on its merits.
Now that the House was organized, it w as
the judge of everything that pertained to
the light of a menilier. Would the House
allow a returning-board to usurp the au
thority of the Ibmse and disfranchise
w hole committees in granting prima facir
certillcatcs? If there ever had been an
arbitrary exercise of quasi judicial power
by a returning-board it was in this ease.
Mr. J. S. Wise said the only case from
Virginia in which the question of retnrn-ing-lHards
entered was the case of Piatt
against tioode, when Piatt was elected,
hut (iomle was given the seat bv a Demo
cratic House. It came with dad grace
from the other side to make the statement
that frauds by returning-lioards were be
coming too common in Virginia.
Mr. Mavo declared that the certtlleate
which allowed him to be sworn was identi
cal with that presented by his colleague,
Mr. tucker, llo asked, in common justice,
that the House deal with his case fairly,
for lie would be sorry to have to say that
he belonged to a body of men w ho so far
forgot w hat was right as to decide noon a
case in advance, merely becauso lie be
longed to the minority.
.Mr. Calkins appealed to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Tucker) not to estab
lish a precedent that would endanger
every man in his seat. After the clerk of
the House had put a man on the roll, and
he was sworn in the prima facit right was
n atljuatcala.
At the suggestion of Mr. Kandall the
matter went over until to-morrow, and the
reading clerk rend the President's mes
sage for message in full, see second page,
which was ordered printed and referred to
Committee of the hole, after which the
House adjourned.

W.aMinxoroN, lecember4. The memo
rial presented in the Senate by Senator
Coke, relating to the alleged abuses in the
I nited States IHstriet Courts of Texas,
sets forth that Cnited States Hisliict
ndgos of Teas are failing to hold the
terms of the courts fixed bv law. Thev
are appointing their sous, sons-in-law and
brothers-in-law to places as the district
and deputy-district clerks of their courts,
and keeping them in office, to the great
wrong o the p'.ihlic. Among other illus
trations of the charges, the memorialist
mentions the fact that the Cnited States
Histnct indue of the Western district of

only two terms of tho court, when he
should have held six, and for this negli
gence there is no gootl cause.

troduced by Senator Ingalls to remove cer

If the disability occurred prior tothedis-

HOW ATKINS
Wns Dcfr.ilct for Clerk of the Houkc ot
I;circtentnll vfa.
Special to the Cincinnati Co.nni'Tcini (!a-
zclle: It seems that there were not two
ballots for clerk, but than when tho roll
call was finished, and the tally stood
('lark itl, Atkins ill, Martin ti, friends of
Atkins, headed bv no less i person than
Randall himself, who left his seat for the
purpose, obtained the change of three
Martin votes to him, leaving the tallv at
Atkins HI. Clark !-. Martin i. Immedi
ately afterward, Phil Thompson and oth
ers induced a change of two Atkins men
to Clark, making it Clark l, Atkins rl.
.Martin .;. Ilu-n, while the tellers and
clerks were puzzled a Martin vote was
changed to Clark, electing him bv Clark
'., Atkins !-, Martin 2. It was the one
close tight of the caucus, and the length
of the ballot and the uncertainty for a
time of the result, led to the general idea
outside that a tie had occurred, and that
two ballots had been taken. As giving an
idea of the immensity of the Democratic
majority, a leading memlier says: "When
1 entered the chamber 1 for a moment for-
ft it was a mere party caucus, and be
ieved that Congress was in session on
some unusually important business. More
seats were occupied than in the case dur
ing session, cxcojt on special occasions.

liun or the oloiine of Silver.
"Silver-Dollar" Pland, of Missouri, docs
not believe this Congress will stop the
coinage of silver dollars. He was asked:
hat is the cood in continuing the coin
age of silver dollars merely to store it
away in the vaults of the Treasury?" and
replied: "Mv idea is to keep it as a re
serve to support an issue of silver certifi
cates. 1 believe in issuing gold and silver
certificates up to the amount on hand and
use them for theeurrencv of the country."
"Then you do not believe in the contin
uance of national hanks?"
Xo. I do not. I believe in their annual
extinction by nsturnl moans. I dui not
liolieve in doing anything to shock the
business interests of the country; but if
the iKinds continue to be called in, the
banks will have to el we no. Thhi will
come gradually, and no harm will resnlt if
proper means are taKcn to supply the loss
by the contraction o! the national bank
nrrencv with gold and silver certificates.
Such contraction will create such a de
mand for silver that I am 8ureHwill soon
equal gold in market value."
liland dix's not believe in making any
crusade against national banks. He might
consent to tiie extension of their charters
iu cases "w here a business stringency is
threaten, ",1. but ho is against all proposi
tions to help perpetnate the system as a
system. The sooner the government fur
nishes directly the currency needed the
better, he thinks. Then the hanks through
out the country shall be confined to re
ceiving deposits and making loans. He
favors calling in the trade dollars and re
ducing them to bullion.

Oossfp as to Mr. Carlisle's committees

iMill, miU, lha lunniici1 of iit'w members
is greater than in any preceding Congress
for years, and the capacity of the new men
is not very well understood. Speculations
for the present are mainly confined to
chairmanships. It is generally admitted
that Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, will be
chairman of the Ways and Mans Com
mittee, and that he ill be one of Car
lisle's chief advisers. Many think that
Mr. Morrison will be the most influential
factor in tiie organization of the House,
and that he would be better pleased to
control tho organization in accordance
with his own views than to receive a very
important place him self.
A noted Kand.:!l man says: "Mr. Mor

Plans for Cnrr.vlnsr on the Nationnllatt
Agitation
A great meeting of the National lieagners
of the county of 1-oiidonderry, Ireland,
was held iu the chv of Londonderry
Saturday. Hie object was that of devis
ing methods of carrying on the National
ist agitation by a series of public meetings,
which may escape the usual prohibitions
issued by Dublin Castle against the con
ventions" avowedly in tho interest of the
league propaganda. It was, alter a long
discussion, derided to orgtinfte a coiltinu-
ous series of anniversary celebrations of
episodes in the Irish resistance to Eng.ish
invasion. the sentiment is that the
Castle authorities will not prohibit or dis
turb these ostensibly patriotic celebra
tions, while the very nature of the occa
sions will tend to revive the Irish national
spirit and make it the more susceptible to
league influences. The first of thff new
series of meetings will be held on the 18th
of the present month, w hich will be the
anniversary of one of the most inspiring
events in the annals t Irish patriotism.
It was on this date, in 18). that some
cool-headed apprentice bnvs of London
derry, while the citizens of the town were
running about iu Wild panic over reports
that a general religious massacre had been
ordered and was about to be put into ex
ecution, noticing the approach of King
James's troops under Lord Antrim, drew
up the terry gates just as. the besieging
soldiers were about to secure their pos
session, and thus so eifeetually barred out
the enemy that the town was enabled to
properly put itself in condition to success
fully resist the memorable luo-davs siege.
Every arrangement will be made to have
tins J'crry celebration as successful as
nosRihle. The orations will be delivered
by the ablest speakers in the league, and
inducements win ue neid out to araw
excursionists from all parts of Ireland.
Much anxiety is felt by the league
leaders as to what policy the gov
ernment will adopt toward the pro
posed class of meetings. The Derry meet
ing will be largely experimental. The
leagners assume that as the Derrv resist-
aice to King James was mainly Prot
estant the Orangemen should not oppose
the celebration, but the Orangemen de
clare that the new league scheme is
merely a false pretense, devised for the
purpose of hoodwinking the officials into
a tolerance ot a dangerous lorm ot na
tional propaganda, and have already
threatened to organize connter-celebra-
tions for the pnrKse of making riots nn
minent,and so inducing the castle to issue
the usual prohibitions.

Tim interests of humanity seem to de

facts: Two months ago my attention was
called to the case of a poor woman who
was said to be atllicted with a cancer. I
found her with an ulcer on her shoulder
at least five inches in circumference,angry,
'.ainful, and giving the patient no rest day
or night for six months. I obtained a
supply of Swift's Specific, which I per-
suaueu ner io iry. one nas uiKen live
battles, the result of which is that the
ulcer is entirely healed up, nothing re
maining but a small scab, not larger than
one's finger nail, and her general health is
better than for five years past. She seems
lierfectly cured. An old man of sixty-
seven years had been subjwt to scrofu
lous sores live vears. 1 le had one on his
cheek as large as a silver dollar, swollen,
raw anil constantly exuding very offensive
matter, .mother on Jus loot ol the some
character, and several on his hands, all of
about two and a half vears standing. His
general health was poor, and he could
scarcely get about at all. He has taken
two bottles ol bwift s specific I he sores
are all well, leaving scarcely a vestige of
their former existence, and his general
health belter than it has been in ten years.
I consider its effects wonderful almost
