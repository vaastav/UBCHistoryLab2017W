Fc.vkkxl ok \silUam llcme—The re
ma ns of W illlam Hcms were brought
| here from Kentucky by his devote-1 mil
' •j'.r, and buried in the cemetery in this j
town on Tue lay the 25th ult. Funeral ■
services were had in tlie Episcopal Church,
and an appropriate discourse delivered by i
Kev. Mr. Enclc. A large number of i
1 mourners and friends attended, and paid
1 ,
i the last rites to his mernotv. The
Chilton Tirnc$ t edited by his brother, re
turns thanks to the people of Manitowoc
jc f un!y wl. . by ll.eir sympathy and aid,
done much to alleviate the suffering of
the -orrowirg friends of the deceased.
Pkai-ewoi thy. —We understand that
at a meeting of the members of Hook &
Ladder Cos. No 1, held a few evenings
ince, they resolved to have a party and
ball in two or three weeks on a large
ca’e, the proceeds to be applied for the
benefit of the families of those unfortunate
! persons who may be drafted in this county.
The affair will come off some time after
| Christmas; and from the fact that the
I boys of Hook A' Ladder Cos. will have
barge of it, we may expect a good time.
Besides, the object is such a praiseworthy
one, that we doubt not the proceeds will
amount to a handsome sum.
1 Navigation. Notwithstanding the
lateness of the season, the steamers Comet
and Sunbeam are running pretty regularly
between Milwaukee and this port and Two
Livers, and will continue to do so until
Jack Frost comes down 100 hard on them
At this time of year we would very much
prefer to be editor of a country newspaper
poor as the business is—than Captain of
a Lake steamer. Captains Pabst and
Morgan have our warm sympathy, and
their Clerks, Messrs. lluhson and Gardi
ner, our kind regards. When we get to
be President, the whole four shall be mem
bers of our Cabinet, or receive fat con
tracts.
The price of white paper for news
papers lias gone up to 20 cents per pound
in New York. This is an advance of
about one hundred per cent, on former pri
ces. Will the subset ibers to the Pilot
bear in mind (hat this new burthen of ex
pense falls heavily upon us, and we can ill
a fiord to put up with it unless they make
prompt payments. Come, friends, assist
us to get over the coming winter.
Lumbering. — Active preparations have
been made ibis fail for hindering in this
vicinity on a large scale. We have no
doubt that more logs will be got out the
coming winter than for several past seas
ons The rapid rise in the price of the
article in Chicago is a strong inducement
for our lumbering men to “ dig in.”
Benefit Ball.— The friends of Mrs.
Patinc.de, who resides in Classonvilie. in
tend to give her a benefit on tbe evening
of die 13th. Good music and good fare
and a good company will he there.
Frozen Over.— The river was frozen
over on Monday night, and the boys skat
ed on its glassy suiface on Tuesday’.
-leut. L'on A. Shove, of the 14s h
Regiment, arrived liome on Wednesday
morning. We believe be has resigned.
Foreign Intervention. —In today’s
paper we publish an interesting correspon
dence between M. throe vn de LTllvs, tbe
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
Earl Hissell, in behalf of the English
Government, in relation to mediation in
American affairs. All accounts agree that
Lot n Napoleon will shortly “take a
band in” with the South, whether Eng
land does or not. Such seems to be the
opinion of French, English, and American
papers.

— ” have but one word my friends,
to -ay," was the concluding sentence of
McClellan’s speech at Trenton ; “It is
to advise you, while your soldiers are fight
ing in tbe field, to see that the war is pros
ecuted for its proper objects—the preser
cation of tbe Union and Constitution, and
the maintenance of your nationality and
your rights as citizens.” Let these be the
watchwords of the Democracy
Richmond not vet Taken —Weeks
have elapsed since McClellan’s removal,
and yet Richmond is not takan. It is
now said that our army is going into
“ winter quarters.” Is McClellan to
blame now ? What say his Abolition en
emies ?

Latest News by the Boat.
No later war news than that published
in another place.
The general impression at Washington
of the President's message is, that il is ar.
inconsequential document.
In the Senate, on Tuesday, Mr. Davis,
of Kentucky, offered a joint resolution rec
ommending ail 'he states to send delegate
to a contention to be held in Louisville.
April Ist, to con-ider means of restoring
the Union. Laid over.
The Washington Republican of Mondav
had elaborate articles, sai l to be inspired
from official quarters, arguing against any
further advance of Bcknsid;;, for fear that
Washington will be attacked.
Fernando Wood, in a speech in New
York, on Saturday night, said he had re
ceived information, and had communicated
it to the government, that, under certain
circumstances, the South was ready to re
turn. Leading statesmen of the South,
men of position and influence in the South
ern Confederacy, had expressed a desire to
return under a Democratic rule, — the past
to be forgotten ; the public debt on b lh
sides to be provided for; and they are
willing to let by-gones be by-gones, if the
Noith would, and the Union once again
be restored. This announcement was re
ceived with tremendous c heers. This is a
symptom. Let us have all the facts.—
That such is the spirit that animates large
masses of Southern people, there is good
reason to believe. So says the Milwaukee
News.
The Pirate Ship Alabama.
Washington, Nov. 30.
Admiral Dupont, of the flag ship Wa
bash, fiom Port Koval on the 25ih, writes
to the Navy Department that on the night
of the 13th a steamer attempted to run the
blockade at Charleston. She was discov
ered and chased, but escaped seaward. —
On the night of the 20th. a steamer, sup
posed to be the same one. attempted to I
run I lie blockade, and was discovered with
in two hundred yards of the steamer Biunl. |
which hied a shell at her, which exploded
on the deck of tlie tebe! steamer, causing j
her to change her course, and she soon dis
appeared in the darkness, and it issuppos
ed that she returned to Nassau disabled.
The Navy Department has information
of t!ic pirate Alabama. She was expected
in the vicinity of the Azores, early in No
vernber, to receive supplies, ammunition
and men, from Bahama A steamer took
dispatches there for Captain Femmes.
