Ij. x nsrton. Mo., Dec 7. (Special,)
Smr bmg parties from this city found the
bodies of Jesse Winner and James Nelson,
the men taken from the Jail here last nlsht
by a mob from Ray county, about a half
mile from the river In Ray county on the
Iti. hmond road, at 7 o'clock this morning.
Bun nded from a limb on a small burr
.-k tr--. with their hands tied behind
Them The men had been pulled up and
ord h had resulted from strangulation.
I leputy Sheriff lUchard Green arrived In
thte city this morning with Ixm Lackey,
the other man connected with the murder,
and lodged him In Jail here, but left this
evening with him for Kansas City, whers
he will be placed In Jail for safe keeping.
After crossing the river this morning's
mob took AVinner and Nelson about half
a mile up the road that leads to Lexington
Junction. At a point known a3 the "rail
road pond" a huge fire had been built.
Here they stopped. It Is one of the most
dismal places in Ray county, and a fit
place for Buch a tragedy to be enacted.
The road on either side is skirted by a
dense and almost Impenetrable growth of
timber and underbrush. The mob had pre
viously Intended, so It Is said, to bang
Winner and Nelson until they were nearly
dead and then throw them into the fire and
burn them, but when they reached the spot
they de lded that they did not have time
to put their original plan into execution, so
they proceeded to hang them.
After tying the ropes around the necks
of the two men. they were asked If they
had an) thing to fa. Winner, pale and
trembling, according to the statement of a
man who says he was an eye witness,
made a full confession of his part In the
crime. He said that he came back to the
house on the night of the murder and
after his wife escaped from the house he
strurk her over the head with a club and.
thinking he would make certain of her
death, ho split her head open with an ax.
Nelson was bold and defiant, but when he
felt the rope tighten around his neck he
confessed that he cut the throats of the
two children. The brutes were then drawn,
up until their feet were clear of the ground
and the ropes tied to the limb above. After
waiting for some time to make sure that
the men were dead, the mob started for
itlchmond. leavlmrahe tensnnsodfer-trf-the
two brutes as a grewsome example of
th vengeance of an outraged people. They
passed through Lexlirgton Junction about
2 o'clock this morning.
At noon to-day Constable Kate!, under
Instructions of Coroner Dove, of Camden.
ut the bodies down and coiuejed them to
Lexington Junction, whero an inquest was
held and the verdict was rendered that the
men met their death by hanging, at the
hands of an unknown mob Hon. Will
iam Aull, prosecuting attorney of Lafa
ette county, expected to ofTer evidence that
dinner and Nelson met their death by
hanging. at the hands of certain men
whose names he has In his possession, and
who were recognized bejond anj- possible
doubt but he did not reach the Junction
In time. He will, howecr, use every pos
sible means to have these parties answer
to the law for taking justice Into their own
hands, but there seems to be a great deal
of doubt as to whether this can be done,
for the people of both counties are morally
certain that the proper men were hung
and it is stated on good authority that any
amount of money will be raised in defense
of the men should any proceeding be Insti

be looking for someone, and was very nerv

was asked.
' I sent for Sheriff Holman to come and
get me. I want protection from the fnends
of Nelson. Hve women hae been here
since morning and every one of them has
told me I would be lynched." she replied.
At this Juncture, Mrs. Bales. Miss Cat
ron's sister, spoke up and said she was
afraid tome of Nelson's following would
do them harm.
It wfll be remembered that Maggie Cat
ron lived with the Winner family for sev
eral months previous to the murder, and,
upon being asked if she knew of any mo
tive the two men could have had in kill
ing the woman and children, she replied.
"One day Winner and hi? wife quarreled
and Jesse knocked his wife down. She
arose and told him if he did not treat her
better she would tell something that would
lay him and others of his kind in their
graves. I suppose he was referring to
the murder of old man Matthews up at
Excelsior Springs."
The people around this city seemed to be
entirely satisfied with the work of last
irght. Lon Lackey was brought here from
Lexington Frida) night, but was taken
back this morning by Deputy Dick Green.
Ho and the deputy passed the bodies of
Winner and Nelson en route, and Lackey
seemed almost paralyzed with fear. The
authorities at that place sent word that
they did not feel disposed to keep Lackey
there over night, and his whereabouts are
unknown at this time by the Richmond
people, as the authorities will disclose noth
ing. Feeling Is high against Lackey, and
now that the farmers have their blood up,
all precautions will have to be taken to
prevent another l)nching.
ESCAPED MOBS VENGEANCE.
Lon Lackc, One of the Alleceil I.ex-
luffton Murderers, Ilrnnclit to

Lon Lackey, the trird of the suspected
murderers of the Winner familj, at Rich
mond, J o., October 2, w ho escaped death
at the hands of the mob at Lexington Sun

ws innocent of any complicity. He is C3
)ears old and has been a miner all his life.
He is not married. His parents live near
Richmond, and he claims he was in Rich

tion was received Saturday at Lexington
that a mob was forming in Ray county to
lynch Lackey, Winner and James Neison,
who had been under arrest on suspicion of

taken to Lexington for safe keeping.
Lackey was removed to Richmond, and
Mr. FuIkron wanted to take Winner and
Nelson awa), but Judge Ryland said there
was no apparent danger. That night they
were taken out al l)nched.

with Lackey for Lexington yesterday
morning. They had not heard of the lynch
ing, but upon reaching the river bank they
saw the bo-Jle3 of Winner and Nelson hang

ese Government AVrltes of Hor
rible Torture Suspects Are
Subjected To "Black
Hole' of .Manllln.
Wichita, Kas., Dec. 7. (Special.) C. II.
Davidson, a prominent banker of this city,
has received a letter from his son, James
Wheeler Davidson, a member of the im
perial Japanese guard, who is stationed at
Formosa, telling of the horrible cruelty of
the Spaniards towards the natives of the
Philippine Islands who are now In revolt
against their oppressors. Young Davidson
rendered distinguished service to the Jap
anese government during the recent war
between that country and China, and has
since been honored with unusual attention
at the imperial palace. He went to the
Philippine Islands recently to investigate
the condition of affairs there and report to
the Japanese government.
He found that the natives and half castes
were being subjected to the most cruel tor
tures known to history, and their condition
was so pitiable as to excite his oeepest
s)mpathy, but he dared not make known
the real facts while on the islands. The
methods of torture invented during thj in
quisition are resorted to in wringing con
fessions of treason from suspects, and he
declares that 3,0u0 suspects have been ar
rested and thrown into foul prisons and
dungeons at Manilla.
The "black hole" or Calcutta has a grim
rival in Manilla. Mr. Davidson describes
the death of fifty-nine unfortunates, who
were smothered in the "black hole" there.
There is a large underground pit in Man
illa, with an opening above. Tour hundred
natives were thrust into it at one time and
the opening closed. The air was soon ex
hausted, the imDrisoned wretches, mad for
a breath of fresh air, fought each other like
demons. Their cries and pleadings failed
to move the hearts of the sentries, and iif-ty-nine
were smothered. The excuse of
fered by the officials for this outrage was
that it was raining, and the openirg was
closed to prevent the prisoners from get
ting wet.
Mr. Davidson sas in his letter:
"When a native Is arrested, his arms aro
bound back by fastening a strong cord
drawn atross the back to each elbow. So
tight is this drawn and so long continued
that the arm is ba lly lacerated. For ex
ample, one prisoner named Lerma had his
flesh so badly torn that he Io-.t the use of
both arms, and the wound was ot such a
nature as to disable both arms perma
nently. Then the native is taken before
the militar) court, where he is subjected
to an examination. If his answers aro
not satisfactory (and ordinarily they ara
not unless guilt is confessed), he is taken
to the torture chamber. After being
stripped, he is first subjected to whipping
with a rattan 2C0 blows, or more, if the
victim is especially obstinate. If this 13
not successful, good old-fashioned thumb
screws are brought into play, and the poor
wretch, already half dead from beating,
is obliged to undergo tho exquisite pain
of the instrument. These torturing ma
chines were actually those used in the
da)s of the Inquisition, and are preserved
to this time in tho monaster)- of St. Au
gustine at Manilla, to be brought Into use
at this day.
"These statements are well known by
all to be facts.
Tho natives tell ot other tortures. They
say prisoners have been placed against a
board wall and small nails driven through
each finger, holding the arms out as in a
crucifixion until the suffering man cnes
out a confession. Again, the suspects hav e
been fastened in a position from which
they cannot change, while a vessel of
water is o arranged above them that drop
after drop falls on their hands, causing
great torture-.
The Spaniards justify thce tortures by
saying that the natives suffer no shame
from imprisonment, and severe measures
are necessary. When suspects are con
demned, they are executed within twenty
four hours. The e-xecuiion usually takes
place in the public park, where tho men.
bound, are placexl on their knees and shot
in the back, death nearl) nlwa)s bfing in
stantaneous. During tho last execution
thirty-four Spanish women were co.mted
among the spectators. In fact, the killing
! looked upon, to a certain etent, as a
gala exhibition, and no doubt compensates
iihcm fcr the lack of bull lights, which (have
bcn, during these days, diKXntinueI.
Rand--, of music are ato playing during
the ep-ution."
Davidson also writes that the Spanish
fortifications are defended by airtlqitatcsl
guns, and that the Spanish troops on the
islands are raw recruits of the same, cli-
as thoe sent to Cuba. He predicts that
the Spanish government cannot put down
the uprising in tho Philippines unless its
military forces are rcirforced b) veterans
and bv- new guns.
Mr DVrtdscn states that he has just been
tendered, by tho t'nited States govern
ment, and will accept, the appointment as
consular agent for the islanu of Formosa.
Davidson was one d the most popular at
taches of the Peary Arctic expedition and
has acnieved considerable success as a war
correspondent.

this afternoon. It is as follows:
To the Congress ot the United States.
As representative of the people in the leg
islative branch of their government, jou
have assembled at a timo when the
strength and excellence of our free insti
tutions and the fitness of cur citizens to
enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest. A political contest involving mo
mentous consequences, fraught with fever
ish apprehension and creating aggressive
ness so Intense as to approach bitterness
and passion, has been waged throughout
our land and determined by the decree of
free and independent suffrage, without dis
tut bonce of our tranquillity or the least
sign of weakness In our national structure.
When we consider thei incidents and
contemplate the peaceful obedience and
manly submission which have succeeded
a he-ated clash of political opinions, w e dis
cover abundant evidence of a de-termlna-tlon
on the part of cour.tr) men to abide
by ever)" verdict of the popular will and to
be controlled at all times by an abiding
faith in the agencies established for the di
rection of the affairs of their government.
Thus our people exhibit a patriotic dispo
sition which entitles them to demand of
t!hoe t. ho undertake to make and execute
their laws such faithful and unselfish serv
ice in their behalf as can only be prompt
ed by a serious appreciation of the trust
and confidence which the acceptance of
public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional require
ment. I herein submit to the congress cer
tain information concerning national af
fairs, with the suggestion of such legisla
tion as. In my judgment. Is necessary and
expedient. To secure brevity and avoid
tiresome narration, I shall omit many de
tails concerning .matters within federal
control, which, though by ro means unim
portant, are more profitably discussed in
departmental reports. I shall also further
curtail this communication by omitting a
rninuto recital of many minor incidents
connected with our foreign relations which
have heretofore found a place In executive
messages, but are now contained in a re
port or the secretary of state, which is
herewith submitted.
THE TROUBLEJN TURKEY.
Nothing: Left Undone to Protect uicr-
i en us. but Armed Intervention
Deemed In.-ulv isnlile.
At the ouuet of a reference to the more
important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, it wculd afford me
satisfaction if I could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Tur
key had. during the past )ear, assumed
a les hideous and bloody aspect, and that,
cither as a consequence of the awakening
of the Turkish government to the demands
of humane civilization, or as the result ot
decisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treat) to In
terfere for the protection of thoe exposed
to the rage of mere bigotry, and cruel fa
naticism, the shocking features ot the sit
uation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protective intervention,
we have been affiicted by continued and
r.ot infrequent reports of the wanton de
struction of homes and the bloody butch
er)" of men, women and children, made
mart)rs to their profession of Christian
faith.
While none of our citizens In Turkey
has thus far been killed or wounded,
though often in the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safety in the future
is by no means assured. Orr government
at home and our minister at Constantino
ple have left nothing undone to protect
our missionaries in Ottoman territor), who
constitute nearly all the individuals re
siding there who have a right to claim our
protection on the score of American citi
zenship Our efforts In this direction will not be re
laxed; but the deep feeling and F)mpathy
that have been aroused among our people
ought not to so far blind their reason and
judgment is to lead them to demand im
possible things.
Armed Force Inmlv Isnlilc.
The outbreaks of blind fur)- which lead
to murder and pillage in Turkey occur sud
denly and without notice, and an attempt
on our part to force such a hostile pres
ence there as might be effective for pre
vention or protection would not only be
reited by the Ottoman government, but
would be regarded as an interruption of
their plans' by the great nations who asert
their exclusive right to intervene in their
own time and method for the security of
lif.1 and property in Turkev.
Several naval vessels are stationed in the
Mediterranean as a measure of caution
anil to furnish all possible relief and rer
uge In case of emergency.
We have made claims against the Turk
ish government fcr the pillage .ind de
struction of missionary propert) at Har
pool and Marasn during the uprisings at
these places Thus far, the validity of
these demands has not been admitted.
though our minister, prior to such out
rages, and in anticipation of dange-, .c
manded protection for the persons nd
property of our missionary citizens .n the
localities mentioned, and, notwithstanlmg
that, strong evidence exists of actual com
plicity of Turkish soldiers in the work
of destruction and robber). The facta as
they now appear do not permit us to
doubt the justice of these claims, and noth.
ing will be omitted to bring about their
prompt settlement.
A number of Armenian refugees having
arrived at our parts, an order has lately
been obtained from the Turkish govern
ment permitting the wivs and children ot
such refugees to jo.n them here. It i
hoped that hereafter no obstacle will b
interpesed to prevent the escape of ail
those who s"ek to avoid the perils which
threaten thm in Turkish dominions.
Our recently appointed consul to Erz
room is at his post and discharging the
duties of his office, though for some unac
countable reason hts formal exequatur
from the sulian ha. not been issued.
I do not believe that the present som.
ber prospect in Turkey will be lonsr per
mitted to offend the sight of Christendom.
It so mars the human and enlightened civ
ilizaticn that belongs to the cloe of the
nineteenth century that it seems hardly
possiole that the earnest demand of good
people throughout the Christian world for
its corrective treatment will remain un.
answered.
THE CUBAN INSURRECTION.
Autonomy for the Island Advised,
AVith u SuKKestiiiii That Interven
tion May Become Nccessnrj.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues,
with all Its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progres? has thus far
been made toward the pacification of th
island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has in
tho least improved If Spain still holds
Havana and the seaports and all consider
able towns, 'the insurgents still roatn at
will over at least two-thirds of the inland
country.
If the determination of Spain to put down
the insurrection seems but to strengthen
with the lapse of time, and la evidenced
by her unhesitating devotion of largely In
creased militar)- and naral forces to the
task, there is much reason to believe that
the Insurgents havo gained in point of
number and tharacter and resources, and
are none the less Inflexible In their resolve
not to succumb, without practically secur
ing the great projects for w hich they took
up arms. If Spain has not jet re-established
her authority, neither havo the in
surgents )et made good their title to bo
regarded as an independent state. Indeed,
as the contest has gone on, the pretense
that civil government exists on the island,
except so far as Spain Is able to maintain
it, has been practically abandoned.
Spain does keep on foot such a. govern
ment, more or less imperfectly, in the
large towns and their immediate suburbs.
But, that exception being .made, the entire
country is either given over to anarchy or
i subject to the military occupation of one
or the other party. It Is reported, indeed.
on reliable authority, that, at the demand
of the coromander-in-chier of the insurgent
army, the putative Cuban government has
row- given up all attempt ro exercise its
functions, leaving that government con
fessedly (what th-ore is the best reason for
supposing it alwa)s to have been in fact)
a .government merely on paper.
CnliiuiH Only BiislivvlinekerK.
Were tho Spar.is-h armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in pitched
battle, prompt and decisive results might
be looked for, and the Immense superiority
of the Spanish forces In-mHnbens.-dt-ipIiRe
aisl equipment, could hardly fail to tell
greatly to their advantage.
But they are called upon to face a foe that
shuns general engagements.that can choose
and does choose its own ground. tht fn m
the nature of the countr) is visible or in
visible at pleasure, and that fights only
from ambuscade, and whn all the advan
tages of position and numbers are on its
side. In a country where all that is In
dispensable to life In the way of food,
clothing and shelter is -o easily obtunabl",
especially b.- those om-.i ard ireti on th-
soil. It is obvious that there is harlly a
limit to the time during which hostllit'es
of this sort may be prolonged.
Meanwhile, as in nil cases of protracted
civil strife, the pissions of the combatants
grow- more and more inflamed and excesses
on both sides become more frequent and
more deplorable. They are also partic
ipated in by bands of marauders, who,
now in the name of ono party and now in
the name of the other, as may best suit
the occasion, harry the country at will
and plunder its wretched inhabitants for
their own advantage.
Such a condition of things would Inevit
ably entail immense uestruction of prop
erty, even if it were the policy of both
parties to prevent it as far as practicable.
But while such seemed to be the original
policy of the Spanish government, it has
now- apparently abandoned it. and is act
ing upon the same theory as the insurgents,
namely, that the exigencies of the contest
require the wholesale annihilation of
property, that it may not prove of use and
advantage to the enemy. It Is to the same
end that. In pursuance of general orders,
Ppani3h garrisons are now being withdrawn
from plantations and the rural populi
tion required to concentrate itself in the
tow ns.
Culm Fust Ilelnir Huiiieil.
The sure result would seem to be that
the indcstr'al -alue of the Island is fast
diminishing, and that unless there Is a
speed) and radical change In existing con
ditions it will soon disappear altogether
That value consists very largel), of course,
in its cTpacity to prodiue sugars a ca
pacity already much reduced by the inter
ruptions to tillage which have taken place
during the last two 5 ears. It Is reliably
asserted that should these interruptions
continue during the current ) ear and prac
tically extend, as is now threatened, to the
entire sugar-producing territory of the isl
and, so" much time and so much money
will be required to ri'store the land to Its
normal productiveness that it is extremely
doubtful if capital can be Induced to even
make the attempt.
The spectaile of the utter ruin of an
adjoining countr). b) nature one of the
most fertile and charminc on the globe,
would engage the serious attention of the
government and people of the United
States under any circumstances, in point
ot fact, they have a loncern with it which
is by no means of a wholly sentimental
or philanthropic character. It 'lies so near
to us as to be hardly separated from our
territory
Our actual pecuniary Interest in It Is
second onlv to that of the people and gov
ernment of Spain. It is reasonably esti
mated that at least from J30.0W.WJ to S-".-M,W0
of American capital are invested in
plantations, and In railroads, mining and
other business enterprises on the island.
The volume of trade between the United
States and Cuba, which In 1SS3 amounted
to about 54.000 0X1. rose in 1SD3 to about
JlKlf'AOO. and in ISM. the jear before the
present insurrection broke out. amounted
to nearly iK,OOX"0. Beside this large pe
cuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the
United States finds itself inextricably in
volved in the present contest in other
ways, both vexatious and cosily.
Position of the I tilled Stntrs.

indirectly promote the insurrect on through
tne press, by public meetings, b) the pur

Crisp's Memory
Honored.
Washington. Dec. 7. The reassemblin:; o
congress to-day for the closing session o
the Fifty-fourth congress was an occasion
of unusual brilliancy and interest. Tho
opening day is always a gala affair, mark
ing, as it does, the official inauguration o
the social, as well as the political, season
in AVashingtoa. but to-day it was all the
more interesting because of the long and
hard fought political battle that had been
waged during the recess.
The weather was perfect, clear and fair
ly warm. The throngs that streamed up
tho hall to witness the openicg ceremonies
forme an tmorsanlzed civic pageant. Gay
eenripajos, with a rattle of chains, drawn
by prancing steeds, conveyed the diplo
mats, the fashionables and the more promi
neri: in official lif( Elegant turnouts
moved side by side with one-horse ram
shackle cabs and other nondescript two
wheelers, conveying legislators and visit
ors. Tho unnumbered thousands moved up
Pennsylvania avenue on foot or In street
cars.
The corridors and galleries' were soon!
thronged, there were demonstrations for
conspicuously prominent statesmen, and at
last came the drop of the gavel and tho
regular ceremonies attending- tho opening
of the session and the reception of the
president's annual communication to con
gress. Senate Galleries Crowded.
The United States senate began ths sec
ond session ot the Fifty-fourth congress
with crowded galleries, and with that ac
companiment of activity and of greeting
that usually attends the reassembling o
congress. But the upper branch of con
gress never puts aside Its dignity, and tha
meeting developed no demonstrations or
dramatic incidents. The reading of tho
president's message was the feature of tho
proceedings, and beyond this no attempt
was made to enter upon the business o
the session.
To many of the foreign representa
tives occupying the diplomatic gallery, tha
message had special interest and signifi
cance, owing to the part they had taken In
the conspicuous foreign events to which,
the president referred. Sir Julian Faunce
fote, the British ambassador, and the new
Turkish minister. Moustapha. Bey. were
present. Senor Dupuy de Lome, the Span
ish minister, was not in attendance during
tho. daK-buE-two-of. the eecrtariea. of tha
Spanish legation carefully noted the refer
ences to the Cuban conflict. Minister
Hatch, of Hawaii, and Mr. Cooper, the
Hawaiian mlrister of foreign affairs, wero
listeners, although the message contained
no reference to the Hawaiian Islands.
The diplomatic gallery was vacated as
soon as the foreign questions referred to
in the message had been read On the
floor of the senate, printed copies of tho
message- were distributed, and these gavo
the senators opportunity to read the salient
features Instead of listening to them. As
a result, there was scant attendance after
tho reading had proceeded beyond the first
half hour. The reading of the message
covered one hour and fifty minute-, and
at its conclusion the senate adjourned.
Cnlleil to Order nt Nnnn.
It was exactly 12 o'clock when A'ice Pres
ident Stevenson entered the chamber, and,
going to the desk of the presiding officer,
gave a tap which brought the senate to
order, while the blind chaplain. Rev Dr.
Milburn, delivered an Impressive Invoca
tion The roll call showed seventy senators
present. Mr Cuilom was the first to re
ceive recognition and his resolution that
the house of representatives be notified
that the senate was in session and ready
to proceed with business was agreed to
without comment. Mr. Hale followed with
a resolution that the daily hour for meet
ing be 1.! o'clock m.. which was agreed to.
Mr. Sherman made the customary mo
tion for a committee of senators and mem
bers to wait upon the president and upon
Its adoption the presiding officer named
Mr. Sherman and Mr. Smith (Democrat,
New Jerse)), as the senators of tho com
mittee. Mr. Morrill (Republican. A'ermont) was
the first to suggest an) thing In the naturo
of legislative business by presenting sev
eral petitions asking for the passage of tho
Dingley bill. He )ieMed. however, to Air.
Hoar's suggestion that all business 1 de
ferred, as a matter of courtesj. until tho
president and house of representatives had
been communicated with, and thereupon,
at 12-I'! p m., the senate took a rceis un
til 1 o'clock.
Hemline of the MesunRr.
At 1 4.". o'clock Mr. Sherman reported that
the president had been waited uin and.
would communicate his- views In writing.
Seeretary I'ruden. of the White Houso
staff, then presented the message, ard it
was taken to the presiding ofil. er"s des-k.
where the seal was broken, and General
Cox, secretary of the senate, read it.
Mo-t of tho senators remained la their

message and followed it with mueh Inter-'

accompanied b) hj secretary. Norigh Ef
fendi. and an attache, entered the gallc-y
shortly before the clerk read the presi
dent's words as to prospective a- tion to
stop Turkish indlrnities, and left imme
diately after this portion of the messaga
was read. .
Just as the senate was about to adjourn
at 21". o'clock. Mr. Call, of Florida, anva
to offer a resolution, but whi'h he with
drew until to-morrow. It Is a joint reso
