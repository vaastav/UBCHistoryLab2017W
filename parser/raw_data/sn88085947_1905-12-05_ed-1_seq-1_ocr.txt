MAYOR DAGGETT VETOES
CORBIN ROAD FRANCHISE
Mayor Daggett today vetoed the
ordinance granting the Spokane In
ternational railroad a franchise
through the city.
The broad ground upon which
the mayor based his action Is that
the question of grade crossings on
Hamilton and Division streets must
be settled before this franchise can
be granted. He says the time to
settle these questions is now and
the O. R. & N. ( Washington Water

franchise is granted.
The franchise calls for tho pay

BOOSTERS WILL OPPOSE
ELEVATION OF TRACKS
At last night's meeting of the
150,000 club, that body was swept
away by the oratory of W. B, Rob
erta and other advocates of track
lowering schemes, to solve the rail
road crossing trouble In Spokane.
A committee of 25 was ap
pointed to call upon tho city offic
ials and use influence with tho city
couucll to prevent the acceptance
of any other plan of ggrade cross
ing elimination.
This committee gets its author
ity from the flowing resolution:
"Resolved, That it ls the sonse
of the 150,000 club that no plan be
adopted by the city council for tho
Northern Pacific grade crossings
that docs not have for its ultimate
object tho sinking of its tracks so
that streets can go across the
tracks a£ the present grade, and
i the wrath of the Lord the wisdom
of man can not avail; in times of
flood or drought human ingenuity
can but partially repair the disas
ter. A general failure of crops
i would hurt all of us. Again, if the
folly of man mars the general well
being, then those who are innocent
of the folly will havo to pay part
of the penalty incurred by those
who are guilty of the folly. A pan
ic brought on by the speculative
folly of part of the business com
munity would hurt tho whole bus
iness community. But such stop
page of welfare, though it might
be severe, would not be lasting.
In the long run the one vital factor
in the permanent prosperity of the
country Is the high individual char
acter of the average American cit

be mental or manual, whether he
be farmer or wage-worker, busi

ire not provided for, and this
ihould be settled now to prevent
future disputes. These companies,
he mayor thinks, should bear all

lamage to abutting property.
Cincinnati street, the mayor
points out, is not provided for in
the ordinance and a viaduct at
Hamilton would divert traffic to

The mayor thinks the ordinance
should provide for separation of
a;rado crossings at any street in
the future at which the city coun

NO RECEIVER EG,
HOME FINDING ASSN.
Only County Commission*
erCan Bring Action and
He Wontßecause Grand
Jury Recommended It
Judge Kennan in superior court
this morning decided that, the pro
secuting attorney had no authority
to bring the action lor the appoint
ment of a receiver for the North
western Home Finding association.
Former Judge George W. Belt
challenged the authority and this
morning successfully argued a mo
tion requiring the prosecutor to in
dicate his authority. There ls no
direct declaration from the su
preme court of this state in the
premises and the case is entirely
new. Judge Belt argued that un
der the statutes of the state the
prosecutor could not bring civil ac
tion in the name of the county
without authority from the county
commissioners. Deputy Prosecut
ing Attorney Laughon admitted
that he could show no authority
from the county hoard but held
that the generic powers of the pro
secutor were sufficient to allow
him to bring action in the interests
of the public.
The argument waged about the
use of the word "represent" as
used in the statute. Judge Belt
claimed that the word should be
applied in the same sense as that
between an ordinary client and a
private attorney. Mr. Laughon
held that the word had a wider sig
nificance because of the quasi-ju
dicial situation in which the coun
ty prosecutor finds himself. He
reiterated the fact of Manager Wil
Hams of the association receiving
public moneys from various coun-

Ito that of buying a farm and pay

Judge Kennan held that the pro

legislature designed to place in the
hands of the commissioners alone
the authority for bringing civil ac
tions.
Mr. Laughon asked the court to
make record of an exception to the
ruling of the court, but said that
he was undecided whether to carry
the matter to the supreme court.
While Mr. Laughon introduced
nothing to show that the county
commissioners had been requested
to lend authority for the bringing

county commissioners for the man
ner In which it concructed county
affairs. It is generally understood
that the commissioners have
agreed to say "how-dc" to
grand jury by declining to a*fCept
any of its suggestions.
The chances are that the com
missioners would have declined to
sanction the action against Wil
liams, had it been asked. But
ti;tre is no record or such a re
quest. Tne august board still
smarts under the painful lash ot
the grand jury's strictures on Its
conduct, in which it declared in
competence and lack of the mental
acumen used by a successful busl
ness man in his private affairs.
On this theory of affairs the
chances are that the action recom
mended by the grand Jury to collect
the illegal $25 a month lump sum
expenses drawn by Commlssionera
Collin and Dean, will never be
brought. It would of necessity be
a civil action, and according to
Judge Kennan today the prosecutor
would have to get the authority of
the board before bringing the ac

ly be refused in a very pointed and
peremptory manner.
The situation seems to be that
because the grand jury "swatted"
the commissioners, the recommend
ations of that body, even whera
meritorious, will not be carried out.
Thus the county board nullifies
