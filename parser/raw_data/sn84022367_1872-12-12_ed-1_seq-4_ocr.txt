A New German .Rifle.
The Borsenzpitung says that the new
Mauser rifle will be thoroughly tested
next vear by various divisions of the
German troops, and that the whole of
the army will be provided with this rine
as speedily as possible. Notwithstand
ing the constant demand for arms of all
kinds during the war of 1870-71, the
conversion of the old needle-gun has
proceeded so rapidly that the troops this
year all armed with the converted rifle,
besides which the Chassepots captured
during the war have been converted for
the use or the uerman cavairy. ine
German army, adds the Borsenzeitung,
la thus now in a position to enter upon
a new war with a much more effective
rifle than it possessed in 1870, and all
accounts agree in the opinion that the
new weapon mav compete favorably
with any of the rifles adopted by other
Htates. l no same paper points out, in
reference to some statistics published in
the last number of the Militar Wochen
blatt, that the number of men and hors
fcs lost by the German artillery in the
late war is unprecedented in military
history. At Gravelotte out ot tour om
cers, 151 men, and 120 horses which
formed the two batteries of the 9th
Reciment of field artillery, 8 officers,
86 men. and 102 horses were killed and
wounded ; four other batteries lost
officers, 45 men, and 49 horses and
Hessian borsc-battery 2 officers, 30 men,
and 27 norses. At Vionville the second
battery of the 3d Regiment of field ar
tillery lost 0 omcers (one supernumerary
to the establishment,) 47 men, and 49
horses. Indeed, it frequently happened
that the German artillery lost while in
action one-third of its officers and men
and two-thirds of its horses. The loss-
. es in euns. on the other hand, were un
precedentedly small. The number of
German euns used at Gravelotte was
615, at Vionville.222, at Worth 231, and
at Sedan 599 : yet the total number of
truns lost In the whole campaign was
onlv six two at Gravelotte, one at

Ccban Slavery. The Pall Mall Go,
tette writes: From an interesting dis
patch from British Consul General Dun-
lop to Lord Granville, which appears in
the correspondence, respecting slavery
and the slave trade in foreign countries
just issued, it appears that there are, in
round numbers, about 350.000 negro
slaves in Cuba, a considerable propor
tion of whom are African born, import
ed during the last thirty years ; deduct
ing from this the aged negroes, children,
and those employed in domestic and
other servitude, there may be rather
more than 200,000 active, able-bodied
"estate" slaves occupied in the cultiva
tion of sugar, tobacco, etc. ; and in ad
dition there are similarly employed about
50,000 to 60,000 Chinese, who are, while
under the bond of labor, to all intents
and purposes slaves. Ever since the
slave trade has been seriously interfered
with the field negroes have been dimin
ishing in numbers over the whole of
Cuba. They are not encouraged to con
tract regnlar marriages, lead irregular
lives, and are generall overworked.
They nre not, however, treated with
wanton cruelty. During two years' resi
dence in Cuba, Consul General Dunlop
has never teen a negro slave receive a
buffet or a hlow, though he says they
often defeve it, "for an insolent, sulky,
obstinate, healthy negro is as provoking
and cross-tempered as a wicked, wilful,
disobedient schoolboy or a refractory
mule." The Gazette, delighting to have
its little joke, adds : Their position is,
therefore, on the whole better than that
of a Winchester schoolboy, but their
hours of work might with propriety be
minced. The Vstatu" slave begin! his
work at six in the morning, arm labors
' with little intermission up to six, seven,
and with moonlijrht to eight and even
nine at night. This Consul Dunlop has
seen repeatedly, and he adds it is painful
and melancholy to witness. It must,
however, be remembered that as regards
hours of labor the slave iu Cuba has not
more reason to complain than the rail
way official in England, and his fatigue
though painful to himself. is not danger
ous to the public.
The Belgian Ministerof Finance has
brought in a bill to facilitate the use of

THE RUTLAND HERALD.
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1878.
Uniform Day for State Elections.
Among the alterations proposed in our
organic law, the constitution ot lae
United States, at the present time, is one
to make the day of elections in the sev
eral States uniform. This is already
substantially provided for in reference
to the Presidential elections, and it is
now proposed to extend the same pro
visions to all elections. There is no
doubt of the power of Congress, under
the constitution as it now is, to fix a'
uniform day for the election of members
of the national House of Representa
tives. The constitution provides "that
the times, places, and manner of hold
ing elections for Senators and Repre
sentatives, shall be prescribed in each
State by the Legislature thereof ; but
the Congress may at any time by law
make or alter such regulations, except
as' to the places of chosing Senators."
It is more than probable that if Con
gress, under this clause, should enact a
law providing that the elections for
members of the House of. Representa
tives should take place on the same day
in all the States, the rsnlt as to State
elections, would also sooner or later be
accomplished, without the aid of a con
stitutional amendment. The arguments
and reasons in reference to uniformity
in the days of election would apply with
greater force to ordinary State elections,
if that for Congressmen should be ap
pointed for the same day throughout the
Union, and, consequently, on a day dif
ferent from that on which most of the
State elections are held. Some of the
reasons for a uniform day may be briefly
stated.
It would work a vast saving both in
time and expense, and would, m effect,
add to the national wealth. The saving
of time and money that will be worked
by this change is evident at the first
dance. The expenses we mean legal
expenses of every election, in the ag
gregate, are enormous and the greater
the number of elections, the greater will
be, necessarily, the expense attendant
thereon. There are in the United States,
according to the last census, nearly for
ty millions of inhabitants, of whom
from four to eight millions are voters,
If only half of these, a3 a general rule,
attend the polls, the saving of time that
would be gained by one attendance, in
stead of two would be vast. These
same voters, as a class, are all or nearly
all producers of wealth, lhcir tune is
worth from two dollars a day and up
wards. It needs but the statement of
the proposition, to show the loss to the
national wealth and general prosperity
that is occasioned by unnecessary and
frequent elections.
A uniform day for holding elections
will, also, in a great measure shut one
of the doors to fraud. The history of
elections in New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Indiana and other States
demonstrate this. Situated, as they arc,
on the borders of State's holding their
elections on different days, voters and
repeaters, by the hundreds and thou
sands, are colonized from the one State
to the other and vote without difficulty.
This is nqstheory or baseless charge. It
has been practiced time and time again,
and has been proven by sworn and un
impeachable testimony. If ths elections
are held on the same day, this would be
simply impossible. This reason alone is
sufficient to show the wisdom and neces
sity of the proposed change.
As the law now stands, if an extra
session of Congress is convened, a por
tion of the States are necessarily unrep
resented. For the past six years, at
least, New Hampshiy and Connecticut
have been without representation in the
House at the opening of Congress, the
day of their election occurring in the
spring and subsequent to the 4th of
March. This difficulty would be obviat
ed by the change.
Each State would vote without refer
ence to any other State. It is true, it
may be all wrong, but it is nevertheless
true, that there are a large number of
voters, who are, so to speak, floating
along on the wave of public opinion. They
are determined to be with the majority,
it makes no difference what political
opinions that majority represent. In
some States this class are sufficiently
numerous to control the result. Hence
the familiar expressions in reference to
the "moral effect of the fall elections,"
etc. That this is so as all of our Presiden
tial elections demonstrate. So obvious
has it become that it is almost a truism
that "as goes Pennsylvania so goes the
Union." This effect becomes impossible
by the change. We need not enlarge
upon this. For these reasons briefly
stated, as well as others, we favor the
proposition for a uniform day for elect
ing members of Coflgress as well as for
all State elections.
1 The South Carolina Senatoeship.
John J. Patterson was Wednesday elect
ed to the United States Senate by a large
majority in the Legislature of South
Carolina. Congressman Elliott, the col
ered Representative of the Third Dis
trict, having determined to investigate
the means by which the successful can
didate received so large a vote, came to
the conclusion that Patterson or his
agents had been using unlawful means
to accomplish this result, and at once
had the Senator elect and an associate
arrested on a charge of bribery. The
defendants were speedily released on a
writ of habeas corpus, however, and
the'hearing of the case was set down for
yesterday.
Mb. Gkeelet's Will. The contest
over Mr. Greeley's will has occasioned
general astonishment and regret. In
1S71 Mr. Greeley made a will fitted to
his circumstances at the time aud while
his -w ife was living. Shortly before his
death, his pecuniary position having
somewhat changed, and his children
having been deprived of their mother,
he revoked the former instilment and
substituted iu its place another by which
he devised the whole remaining property
absolutely to his daughters. No more
sensible or commendable act could have
been performed, and that any person
should have leen found willing to con
test the last bequest is a matter of sur
prise to the community.

Going through the forest it was rare to
find a tree as small as three feet through
the butt. They were from five to six,
seven, eight, and sometimes nine or ten
feet through at the base, and marvellous
ly tall, some 250 feet high. He saw one
tree that would make an amount of lum
ber equal to the average of five acres in
Michigan. It is estimated that a tree
200 feet high and ten feet through at the
base will make 80,400 feet of lumber ;
eight acres of Michigan pine lumber, as
the trees run, would therefore make no
more lumber than one of these Oregon
trees. They are of white cedar, make
very fine finishing lumber and the pro
duct is worth $40 per thousand feet at
Portland and other places on the coast.
Alabama. It is the fixed determina
tion of the government not to interfere
in the political affairs of Alabama, un
less something arises under the Constitu
tion of the United States .which shall
render the intervention of the Federal
authority necessary. Committees repre
senting both wings of the Alabama Leg
islature have placed in possession of the
Attorney-General full statements relat
ive to the situation of affairs at Mont
gomery, including the causes which led
to the present attitude of the two bodies
claiming to be the Legislature of Ala
bama. The Attorney-General will not,
unless requested by the President, ren
der any opinion or take any action there
on. Epizooty. The epizooty seems to

quite as bad a time as its rivals, horse
car travel and business in general being

however, is of- a mild type at St. Louis
and indeed in all that section, compara

Libeei an Coloniz ation. Accor ding

Virginian, Liberian colonization is hard

enthusiasts predicted. The Virginian
says that there has just landed at Norfolk
a party of twenty-five colored people on
their way from Liberia to North Caro
lina, and adds : " These people are the
remains of a company of near.two hun
dred who went to Liberia from Carolina
about a year ago. The balance died out
.there, and the small remnant are now
seeking their wray back to the Old North
State. They say they were treated very
well by the natives, but not being used
to the climate and mode of living they
died off like sheep."

The cable was 05s. Geld closed at. 113,
and the highest quotation for cheese was
14c. For the corresponding week last
year the receipts were 16,713 box.es, and
the exports 9.C83 boxes. The cable was
G2s. Gold closed at 110, and the highest
quotation for cheese was ic. It will
be seen that the receipts last week were
throe times as heavy as they were for
the corresponding week last year. The
Producers? Price Current says: If fac
torymen expect the trade of this city to
relieve them of their load of purchases
they wait in vain. The belief here is
that there are more cheese than can be
sold at the present quoted prices. A
gentleman who has invested in Madison
and Onondaga counties, reports 1G fac
fories as holding 16,000 cheese. Of
course this is far too great an average
for all the factories of- the State, but it
seems quite certain, nevertheless, that
the quantity back is large. We advise
that stock be forwarded on commission
before the weather becomes excessively
cold, that our receivers may take advan
tage of whatever opportunities may arise
to move it during the winter.
BITTER.
At St. Albans, the market was dull,
with the following quotations: Com
mon to fair, 2025c ; medium to good,
2530c; choice, 32.
At Boston the receipts for the week
were 11,493 packages against 9,9516 pack
ages for the corresponding week last
year. The demand was quite limited
during the week, and prices eased off
about lc per pound. Lots of New York
and Vermont fine fall made that a week
or two ago would command 33(S35, can
now lie sold for over 33c per pound,
which is the highest price for round lots.
Good to choice dairies, summer and win
ter made, range from 2530e, but it
must be a desirable lot to command 30c
per pound. Common grades are not
much wanted and sales ranged all the
way from 15ffi20e. per pound. Really
fine Western can be sold at 27(530c, but
the bulk of the stock offering was an
inferior quality and was slow of sale at
prices rangin? from 1520c per pound.
At Little Fall.s prices ranged at 30t
32c.
At Uilcfl. tin T- i no change in the
market to note. If anything, prices are
firmer. The Producers' Pries Current
of the 7th says that the "prices of fine
State, in whatever style of package, are
very firm, and rather favoring the seller,
but not quotably higher. The medium
and low grades of State are quiet." It
adds: "Roll butter is in good demand;
very choice grades sell promptly on ar
rival ; fair and low qualities are less
eagerly sought, but stock of any kind
does not accumulate." The demand of
the week ran principally on tubs both
half firkins and Welsh.
POULTRY AND GAME MARKET.
There was a scarcity of choice chickens
and turkeys in Boston,last wreek and sales
were readily made at 20c per lb. Geese
were in better demand and lots in good
order will be wanted for Christmas.
Game is moving more freely at full
prices. The market closed active and
firm for fresh poultry. The following
instructions for preparing poultry, etc.,
for f the Boston market are given by C.
C. Chamberlin & Co., Commission Mer
chants. All poultry for this market should 1m:
well fattened, especially that sent for the
holidays. Poultry should be killed by
bleeding in the neck, but never by wring
ing the neck It should always be dry
picked, and if the feathers are plucked
before the bodies are cold, this can easily
be done. But on no account should
poultry be scalded, as it lessens the value
full one-third. The wing feathers should
always be removed, the entrails drawn
and the head cut off. The skin should
always be drawn over the neck and tied,
excepting in warm weather. In pack
ing, use clean packages. Pack closely
as possible so there will be no chance for
the poultry to move about. Never use
straw in packing. Good poultry will
generally sell for a fair price, while com
mon and inferior grades invariably sell
low and at a loss to the shipper.
The Rutland Herald
" : : ::';--:, A
FOB 1873.; ;
THE VERMONT NEWSPAPER. ;
The Rutland , Daily, and , Weekly
Herald for the coming year will be
made especially interesting and readea
ble. The publisher has had many years
experience as a newspaper publisher and
proposes to relax no efforts oa' his part
to make it in the future the leading news
paper of Vermont. No expense will be
spared in Editorial work ; and the col
lecting of news by Telegraph and other
wise promptly and fully. Extensive
arrangements haye been made for local
correspondence 'in all the principal
towns of Western and Southern Ver
mont, and Essex and Washington coun
ties, New York. Also, for Washing
ington, Foreign and Western correspond
ence. The full night Telegraph
ic Reports of the associated press
are received for both Daily and Weekly
Herald, up to the very hour of going
to press, besides special Market and
Stock Reports, latest Dairy markets,
(so valuable to every farmer,) specially
prepared for the Herald. : Only
one other paper in Vermont (and that
not in this section,) takes these tele
graphic reports because of the expense.
In short the Herald aims to be a news
paper, a paper that shall be prompt and
full in passing history, takmg decided
and high grounds on all moral and po
litical questions ; to be a readable, in
structive and entertaining newspaper for
the counting-room and for the fireside.
It holds that no journal has an excuse
for existence that does not labor to make
life richer and happier for every man
and woman that reads it
The Herald offers no bait for sub
scribers in the shape of premiums or
clubbing with other papers or journals,
which is nearly always an evidence of
weakness, and is always done at the ex
pense of the subscriber. It stands on
its own merits, and will give the full
money's worth to all its subscribers.
The Publisher gives his undivided at
tention to the business departmeut, and
will constantly be on the alert to keep
the Herald in the front rank of jour
nalism. He will be assisted in the Edi
torial department by able writers. Wc
hope to receive a renewal of patronage
from all patrons of 1872, and have rea
son for hoping for a large accession of
new subscribers to our list for 1873.

ALBERT H. TUTTLE,
Publisher, Rutland, Vt.
Herald Building, Center-St.
To orR Readers. TnE Herald is
the only paper published ia the county
of Rutland that published the President's
message. We took it specially by tele
graph at considerable expense, and it
appeared in full in Tuesday's Daily and
Thursday's Weekly of last week. It is
a document that every one wants to
read, and we are surprised that our co
temporarus did not attempt it. publi
cation or even its abstract of it, if noth
ing more. But it is so long, they thought
it would cast too much to put it in type.
The readers of TnE Herald are aware
that we never stop for expense, but arc
up to the times with all these things, and
publUh everything of passing and pub
lic interest, not stopping to calculate
what our paper cost per week,
a few dollars more or less, in conse
quence. We desire to give our readers
the news, and they shall have it. Con
sider this when subscribing for your
weekly paper for the coming year.
Reader, if you are a subscriber we doubt
not you will renew, as we scarcely ever
los" a subscriber except by death. If
you are not a subscriber, commence with
us :it once.
To oi r Si'bscrii;ers. In the coming
two. or three weeks, many hundreds of
subscriptions to Tire Herald expire.
We intst that all our old subscribers
will renew for another year, and that
promptly, so that there may b.-. no inter
mission of papers. If you have a neigh
bor that does not take The Herald, re
commend it to him, if you can consis
tently, Will our friend aid uh in thin
mat'er ? W: want in the year 1873
the largest list of subscribers ever on
our books, and we have' encouraging
signs that it will be so. '
Session Laws. We give," in a supple
ment sheet in this issue, the public laws
passed at the last session of the Vermont
Legislature, designated by the Secretary
of State for publication. We give them
to onr readers in supplement that we
may not infringe upon our usual space
for other matters, and also that they
may be more easily preserved for refer
ence than would be the case if they
were published in the lnxly of the paper.
State Tax and Appropriations.
The bill for the support of the State
government which passed the last day
of the session, provides for a tax of for
ty cents on the dollar of the list of 1872,
to be paid into the Treasury by the first
of June next, a tax of thirty-five cents
on the dollar of the list of 1873, to be
paid by June 1, 1874. Seventy-five
thousand dollars ia appropriated for the
purpose of paying the debentures of the
Lieutenant-Governor, the Senate and
House of Representatives, and the xcon-
of the General Assem
bly" Six hundred and fifty thousand dol
lars is appropriated for paying such de
mands against the State as may be al
lowed by the Auditor and County Clerk's
orders. Ten thousand dollars is appro
priated for payment of orders drawn to
pay coming and incidental e:cpenses of
executive and treasury departments.
Seventy-five thousand dollars is appro
priated to pay interest on 5onds and
other debts of the State. A sum net
exceeding $40,000 is appropriated to pay
expenses of the Reform School. Four
per cent, will be remitted on all taxes
paid before the let of February next
after the issuing of the Treasurer's war
rant for the collection of the same.
Tns Waterford Bank Robbery. It
would 6eemthat the Directors of the
Waterford Bank were remarkably active
in their search for the robbers and their
plunder. Such a wide-awake body of
men would make first-class detectives
and criminal officers. The, Albany Argus
of Tuesday morning, says : " Chief
Maloy received another telegraphic dis
patch, Tuesday, from J. M. Graves,
Sheriff of Washington county, Ind., ask
ing for full particulars by mail of the
Waterford Bank robbery, and, thinking
there might be something in it, the Chief
communicated with tho officials of the
Waterford Bank. In answer to the
communication, the directors stated that
they had received several such dis
patches, and had paid no attention to
them. Chief Maloy thinks it strange
that the authorities should pay no atten
tion to a telegram from a Sheriff, but
very quietly remarked that if the bank
officials could stand it he could, and
therefore he should not take any further
trouble in the matter.
A Mischtevocs Agitator. It seems
that that disgraceful English political
adtator Odger is ripe for any mischief.
He has now been heading a combination
of dismissed policemen to intimidate the
nome Office. Pity that the law can't
seize this man and hold him, only the
unfortunate part of It is that in England
when the law does gjet hold of a man,
that man generally comes over to us.
Anybody rather than Odger. Give ns a
Communist or two, Bradlaurb, Karl
Marx, a few Iconoclasts and half a
dozen free-thinkers, but for neaven's
sake not Odger. Upon consideration we
hope therefore that Odger will keep
within the law.
At Corsicana, Texas, C. Bennett

AV1IV EXDOIE WHAT IS CURABLE ?
" What can't be cured must te endured,"'
says the pro veih; but indigestion can be
cured, and therefore it ia the merest stu
pidity to endure it. Dyspeptics have cer
tainly a right to continue dyspeptics to the
endoftbeirdaysif they chooe, but as it
is not supposed that any rational being
prefers physical torment to ease and
health, the probability is that it all suffer
ers from indigestion were convinced that
an absolute, infallible retneiy for their
complaint existed, they would with one
accord resort to it. We most emphatically
declare that such a remedy does exist, and
that its name is Hostetter's Stointich Bit
ters. The record of its success extends
over a period of more tban twenty years,
and it is fearlessly alleged that during the
whole of that tiiue it has never failed to
attord permanent relief In any disorder or
derangement of the stomach that was not
organic, malignant, and incurable. The
testimonials that go to establish this im
portant fact can be counted by the thou
sand, tstomuch complaints that had been
aggravated by a total disregard of all
dietary rules, and intensified and rended
chronic by medicinal treatment or drastic
purgation have in hundreds of instances
been cured within three months by the
systematic use of this celebrated stom
achic and alterative. It should be remem
bered that weakness of the digestive or
gans involves many otlber ailments. Bil
iousness, headache, m'rvous debility,
spasms, palpitation of th e heart, rush of
blood to the head, nausea, vertigo, and
sleeplessness are among its concomitants
and results; and for all these the great
vegetable tonic is a specifM. It acts nrst
upon the stomach, and thrc-ugh the stom
ach upon the secretory anci nervous sys
tems and the bowels, its general effect
being always genial and ben elicent.
Progress of the KEvort'Tiov. a new
light dawned upon the wo rid with the in
troduction of Plantation Bitters twelve
years ago. Drastic purga tion. went out
restoration and renovatio n came in. The
eyes of the people were opened to the
great fact that the way to cure disease is
to strengthen and support its victims, not
to place them at its mercy by depriving
them of the little strengt'.i they have, it
soon became evident that nsameans of in
fusing vitality into the feeble system, reg
ulating the secretions, curing indigestion,
and reforming a bilious habit of body, no
medicinal preparation then lenovn was at
all comparable to the new restorative.
Siuoe then hundreds of attf-mpts have
been made to rival the Bitters. They have
all failed, and the grand revolution in
medical treatment, which wascoinmenced
in 1K), is still in progress. Nothii g can
stop it, for it is founded on tho principle,
now universally acknowledged, that phy
sical vigor is the most formidable antago
nist of all hutnSn ailments, and ex perictice
has shown that Plantation Bill ers is a
peerless invigorant. as well as the best pos
sible safeguard against epidemic diseases.
