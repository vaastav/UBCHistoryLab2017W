P ESIDETS S MESSAGE
Fellow Citizens of the Senate an
Jfoitse of Jtepresenlalivcs
I congratulate you on the continu
ed and increasing prosperity of our
country By the favor of divine
Providence we have been blessed
during the past year with health
with abundant harvests with profit
able employment for all our people
and with contentment at home and
with peace and friendship with
pc
other nations The occurrence of
the twentyfourth election of Chief
I Magistrate has given an opportu
I nity t the people of the United
J States t exhibit t the world signi
r ficant example of the p aceful and
safe transmission of power and au
thority of the government from the
public servants whose terms of of
fice aro about t expire to their
newly chosen successors This ex
ample cannot fail t impress pro
foundly thoughtful people of other
countries with advantages which
republican institutions have offered
The immediate general and cheer
ful acquiescence of all god
citizens in the result of the election
gives a gratifying assurance t our
country and t its friends through
out the world that a government j
Lntauu uu iuu lieu umscub ui uii m
tolligent and patriotic people I possess
e elements of strength stability
nnd permanency not found in an
other form of government Con
tinued opposition t the full and free
enjoyment of the
RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP
conferred upon the colored people
p
ple by the recent amendments t I
the Constitution still prevails in
heveral of the late slaveholding
Btates I has perhaps not been
manifet in the recent election t
a very large extent in acts of vio
lence or intimidation I has how
over by fraudulent practices in con
nection with the ballots with the I
regulations a t the places and man
ner of voting and with counting
curing and cauvassiug the votes
rnst been successful in defeating
jmd nullifying the right of all
lights the right of suffrage which
the Constitution expressly con
fers on our enfranchised citi
zens I is the desire of
the good pee leof the whole coun
try that sectionalism as a factor in
our politics should disappear They
prefer that no section of the country I
hhould bo united in solid opposition
ip any other section The disposi
tion t refuse a prompt and hearty
obedience to the equal rights amend
ments t the Constitution is all that
IOW stands in the war of a complete
obliteration of sectional lines in our
political contests As long a these
amendments are flagrantly violated
or disregarded it is safe to assume
that the people who placed them in
the Constitution as embodying the
legitimate results I of the war for the
JLJnSon and who believe them to b
wise and necessary will continue t
act together and to insist that they
hhall b obeyed The paramount
question still is a t the enjoyment
of the rights by every American
citizen who has the requisite quali
fications to freely cast his vote and
t have it honestly counted With
this question rightly settled the
country will bo relieved of the
contentions of the past Bygones
will indeed b bygones and political
nnd party issues with respect t the
economy and efficiency of the ad
ministration internal improvement
the tariff domestic taxation educa
tion finance and other important
subjects will then receive their full
aharo of attention but a resistance
to and nullification of the results of
Iho war will unite together in ranks
for their support all who main
tain the authority of the Govern
ment and the perpetuity of the
Union and who adequately appreci
ates the value of the victory acliicv
od This determination proceeds
from no hostile sentiment or feeling
t any part of the people of our
country or t any of their interests
The inviolability of the amend
ments rests upon the fundamental
principles of our Government They
are therefore 1 expression of the
will of the people of the United
States The sentiment that the con
stitutional rights of all our citizens
must be maintained does not grow
weaker I will continue to con
trol the Government of the
country Happily the history
of the lato elcctims shows
that in many parts of the
country where opposition to the 15th
amend mcnt has heretofore prevailed
it is diminishing and is likely to
re altogether if firm and well
considered action is taken by Con
gross 1 trust the House of Repre
sentatives and the Senate which
have the right t judge of the elec
tion returns and qualifications of
their own members will see to it
that every case of violation of the
letter orw spirit of the fifteenth
amendment is thoroughly investi
gated and that no benefit from such
violation shall accrue to any person
or party I will be the duty of the
Executive with sufficient appropri
ations for the purpose to prosecute
uispnrnglyal who have been en
gaged in depriving citizens of the
rights guaranteed to them by the
Constitution I is not however
tobe forgotten that the best and
surest guarantee of the prim
nry rights of citizenship is to
ho fouud in that capacity I
for self protection which can belong
only to a people whose right to uni
versal suffrage i supported by
UNIVERSAL EDUCATION
The means at the com
mand of the local and State au
thorities are in many cases wholly
inadequate to furnish free instruc
tion to all who need it This is especially I
tou ne
pecially true whore before emancipa I
tion the education of the jeo I
pIe was neglected or prevent
ed in the interest of slavery
Firmly convinced that the subject
of popular education deserves the
earnest attention of the people of the
whole country and with a view t
wise and comprehensive action by
wie government of the United
State I respectfully recommend
that Congress by suitable legisla
tion and with proper safeguards
supplement the prpr educational
units in the several States where
fund duties and responsi
grave
bullies of citizenship have
been devolved on the p
ple by devoting to the purpose
grants of the public lands and if
grnt by from
necessary appropriations
1eossry Treasury of the united States

Whatever the government can fair
ly do to promote free popular educa
tion ought to b done Wherever
general education i found peace
eucton
virtue and social order prevail and
civil and religious liberty are secure
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
In my former annual messages I
have asked the attention of the Congress
to the urgent necessity of a
gross t nrent nesiy
reformation of the civil service
system of the government My
views concerning the dangers of
patronage or appointments for per
appitment p
ptonae
fconal or partisan consideration
sna by observation
have been strengthened my ob
servation and experience in the Ex
ecutive offlceand E believe these dan
threaten the stability of the
gem treatn te stbIty te
government Abuses s carious In
their nature cannot cerous per
manently tolerated They tend
t become more alarming with
the enlargement of the admin
istrative service a the growth ot
the country in population increases
the numbers of officers and place
men required The reasons are im
lemtive I for the adoption of fixed
rules for the regulation of appoint
ments promotion pay and removals
establishing a uniform method hav
ing exclusively in every instance
the attainment of the best qualifi
cations for the position in question
dueh a method i alone consistent
with the equal rights allcitizena and
the most enomicl and efficient ad
ministration of the public business
Competitive examinations in aid 01
impartial appointments and promo
tion have been conducted for some
years past in several of the execu
live departments and by my direction
ibis system has been adopted in the
custom houses and postoffices of the
larger cities of the country I the
city of New York over two thou
sand persons in the civil service
have been subject on their appoint
ments and tenure of place t the
operation of published rules for the
purpose During the past two years
purpe
the results of these practical triak I
have been very satisfactory and have
confirmed my opinion in favor 01 t
this system of selection All are
subjected t the same test and the I
result is free from prejudice by
reult fre frm prejudic per
sonal favor or partisan influence
ft secures for the position applied foi
the best qualifications attainable
Ii
among the competing applicants
is an effectual protection from the
pressure of importunity 1 u which
unuer any OLDer course pursueu
largely exacts the time and atten
tion of the appointing officers to
their great detriment in the dis
charge of other official duties pre
venting the abuse of the service for
the mere furtherance of private or
party purposes and leaving the em
loye purp government freed
from the obligation imposed
by patronage to depend sole
ly upon merit for retention and
advancement and with this con
stant incentive to exertion and im
provement invaluable results have
ben attained in a high degree in the
offices where the rules for appoint
ment by competitive examination
eXmlaton
have been applied A method whici
has so approved itself by experiment
al tests at points where such test1
may b fairly considered conclusive
hould be extended t all the subor
dinate positions under the
pitions govern
ment I believe a strong
and growing public sentiment
demands immediate measure
for securing and enforcing the
highest possible efficiency in the
civil service and its protection from
recognized abuses and that the ex
perience referred to has demonstrat
ed the feasibility of such measures
The examinations in the Custom
Houses and Postoffices have been
held under many embarrassments
and without provision for compensa
tion for the extra labor performed by
the officers who have conducted
hemand whose commendable inter
est in the public service has in
duced this devotion of time and labor
without pecuniary reward A con
rewar cn
inuance of these labors gratuitously
ought not to be expected and with
out appropriation by Congress for
compensation it is not practicable to
extend the system of examinations
generally throughout the civil ser
vice I is also highly important
hat all such examinations should be
conducted upon a uniform system
and under general supervision Sec
tion 1753 of the Revised Statutes
autoriz tho President t pre
crib for the regulations for admis
sion to the civil service of the Unit
Stt and for this purpose t em
ploy suitable persons t conduct the
requisite inquiries with reference to
the fitness of each candidate in
respect t age health character
knowledge and ability for the branch
of service into which he seeks to
enter but the law i prac
ically inoperative for want of
requisite appropriation I therefore
recommend an appropriation ofS 5
309 per annum 1 meet the expen
ses of a commission to be appointed
by the President in accordance with
the terms of this section whose
duty it shall be t devise ajust uni
form and efficient lystcm of compe
titive examination and to super
vise the application of the same
throughout entire civil service
of the government I am persuaded
that the facilities which such a com
mission will aflord for the testing of
the fitness of those who apply for
office will not only bo a welcome a
relief to members of Congress a it
will be t the President and heads of
departments but that it will also
greatly tend 1 remove the causes
of embarrassment which now in
evitably attend the conflicting
claims of patronage between
the legislative and execu
tive departments The most
effectual check upon the competition
upn comptton
of influence and official favoritism
in the bestowal of office will be the
substitution of an open competition I
of merit between the applicants in
which every one can make his own I
record with the assurance that his
success will depend on this alone I
also recommend such legislation
as while leaving every officer free
as any other citizen to express his I
political opinions and to use his
means forgtheir advancement shall I
also enable him to feel a safe as any
private citizen in the refusal of all
demands upon his salary for political
purposes A law which should thus
guarantee true liberty and justice to
all who are engaged In the public
engge
service and likewise certain stringent
provisions against the use of official
authority to coerce the political ac
ton of private citizens or of official
subordinates is greatly t be desired
The most serious obstacle however
serous
to an improvement of the civil ser
vice and especially to reform in the
metho of appointment and remo
val has been found to bo the prac
tice under what is known a the
spoils system by which theappoint
mg power has been so largely en I I
croached upon by members of Con I
gress The first step in the reform
of the civil service must be a com I
plete divorce between Congress and
the Executive in the matter of ap
pointments The corrupting doctrine
trine that To the victors belong the
spoils is inseparable from
Congressional patronage as
the established rule and practice
of the parties in power I seems to
b understood by applicants for office
and by the people generally that re
presentatives and senators are en
titled to disburse the patronage of
their respective districts and States
I i i not necessary to recite at length
the evil resulting from this invasion
of the executive functions The
true principles of government on
the subject of appointment to office
a stte in the national conven
tions of the leading parties of the
country have again and again been
approved by the American people
and have never been called in
Ieve bn clled ques
tion in any quarter The authentic
expressions of public opinion upon
this question are the statement of
the principles that belong
1 the constitutional structure
of the government Under the Con
stitution the President and heads of
departments are to make nomina
tions for office The Senate i to ad
vise and consent to the appoint
ments and the House of Represen
tatives to endorse The best interest
of the public service demand that
these distinctions b respected that
senators and representatives who
may be judges and accusers should
not dictate appointments to office
To this end the attention of the
legislative department of the gov
ernment is requested alike by the
necessities of thecase and by public
demand Members Congress will
not b relieved from the demands
made upon them with reference t
appointments to office until by
legislative enactment the pernici
ous prctc I condemned and for
bidden I i therefore recommend
ed that an act be passed defining
the relations of members of congress
with respect 1 appointments to
office by the President and I also re
commend that the provisions sec
tion 1767 of the revised statutes comprising
of
prising the tenure of office act
March 2 1867 b repealed Believ
ing that t reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our
country i one of the most impera
tive duties of statesmanship and
that it can b permanently done
only by the cn cooperation of the legislative
cprton
lative and executive departments of
the government lagain recommend
the whole subject t your consider
ate attention
UTAH AND POLYGAMY
I is i the duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to sup
press polygamy where it now exists
in our territories and prevent its
extension Faithful and zealous
tort have been made by the Unit
id States authorities in Utah to en I
brce the law against it Experience
shown that the I
las legislation up
in this subject to effective requires
xtensive modification and amend
nents The longer action is delay I
id the more difficult it will b to ac I
what is desired I
omplish deire Prompt
nd decided measures are necessary I
he Mormon sectarian organization
rhich unholds nolviramv has the
whole power of making and executIng
ng the local legh latiou of the Terri
tory By its control of the grand
and petit juries it possesses large
influence over the administration of
justice Exercising as the heads of
this sect do the local political
power of the Territory the
re able to make eflectual
their hostility to the law ofCongr s
on the subject of polygamy and in
act to prevent its enforcement
Polygamy will not be abolished if
gmy
the enforcement of the law depends
on those who practice it and uphold
the crime It can only be suppress
ed by taking away the political pow
er of the sect which encourages and
> ustaius it The power of Cougre
to enact suitable Jaws to protect the
ferritories is ample I is not safe
for half way measures The politi
cal power of the Mormon sect is in
creasing I controls now one of our
wealthiest and most populous Terri
tories I is extending steadily into
other Territories Wherever it
otcr Terrtorie goes
establishes polygamy sectarian
political power Its continued
violation of the sanctity of
marriage andthe family relation is a
disgrace to society and civilization
Religious liberty and separation of
church and state are among the ele
mentary ideas of free institutions
Co the reestablishment of the in
terests and principles which poly
gamy and Mormonism have imperil
ed and fully reopen to intelligent
and virtuous immigrants of all
creeds that part of our domain which
crees prt
has been in a great degree closed to
general immigration by the immoral
institution it is recommended that
the government t of the Territory of
Utah be reorganized by enactment
of Congress providing for a gov
ernment for Utah by a governor and
judges or commissioners appointed
oy the President and confirmed
by the Senate or a government
analogous t the provisional government
ment established for the territory
northwest of the Ohio by the ordin
ance of 17S7 I however i is
lome best to continue the exist
ing form of local government I re
commend that the right to vote
hold office and sit on juries in the
Territory of Utah be confined to
those who neither practice nor
thos prctce up
hold polygamy I thorough measures
sures are adopted it is believed
within 3 few years the evils which
now afflict Utah will be eradicated
and this Territory will in good time
be one of the most prosperous and
attractive of the new States of the
Union
RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN
Our relations with all foreign coun
tries have been those of undisturbed
peace and have presented no occa
sion for concern n t their con
tinued maintenance My anticipa
tion of an early reply from
the British government to the de
mand for indemni y to our fisher
men for injuries suffered by that in
dustry at Fortune Bay in January
1878 which 1 expressed in my last
annual message was disappointed
This answer was received only in the
latter part of April in the present
year and when received exhibited
a failure of accord between the two
oenment as to measures of in
shore fishing privileges secured to
our fishermen by the treaty of
Washington and of such a charac
ter that I made it the subject of
communication to Congress in
which I recommended the adoption
of measures which seemed t me
proper to be taken by this govern
ment in the maintenance of the
rights accorded our fishermen under
the treaty and towards the securing
of indemnity for injury these inte
rests had suffered A bill to carry
out these recommendations was
was under consideration by the House
of Representatives at the time of
the adjournment of Congress in
June last Vithin a few weeks 1
have received a communication
from Her Majestys government re
newing the consideration of the sub
ject both of indemnity for the inju
ries at Fortune Bay and of the inter
pretation of the treaty in which
the previous correspondence had
shown the two governments to b at
variance Upon both these topics a
disposition towards a friendly agre
ment is manifested by the recogni
tion of our right to indemnity for
the transaction at Fortune Bay
leaving the measure of such an in
demnity te a further conference and I
by an assent to the views of this
government presented in the previous i
ous correspondence that the regula
tion of the conflicting interests of
the shore fishery of the provincial
e coasts and the vessel fishery of
our fishermen should be made the
tle
subject of conference and concurrent
arrangement between the two gov
ern a basis may
be found for a speedy adjustment
of the various views on the inter
pretation of the fishery clauses of
the treaty of Washington which
n the correspondence between the
two governments stood at the close
of the last session of Congress
seemed irreconcilable
AtTSTRLIAN EXPOSITIONS
In the important exhibition of art
and industries which was held last
year at Sidney New South Wales
a well a in that now in progress at
Melbourne the United States have
been efficiently and honorably represented
presented Exhibitors from this
country at the former place received
a large number of awards in some
awars
of the most considerable
cnsideble depart
deprt
ments and the participation of the
United States was recognized by
special mark of distinction In the
exhibition at Melbourne the share
taken by ou country isno less nota

confidently expected
RELATIONS WITH FRANCE SAl
E
The state of peace and tranquility
now enjoyed by all the nations
of the continent of Europe
has Its favorable influence
commercial
and
upon our diplomatic ad cmmecil
relations with them We have con
cluded and ratified a convention
with the French republic for the
settlement of claims of the citizens
of one country against the other
commis
Under this convention a commission
sion presided over by a distinguish
ed publicist appointed in pursuance I
appinted
of the request of both nations by his
Majesty the Emperor of Brazil has
lInjet Empror
been organized and has begun its
orgniz
session in this city A congress t
consider means for the protection of
industrial property has recently ben
in session in Pars to which 1 have
appointed the ministers of the Unit
ed States iu France and Belgium aa
delegates The international com
mission upon weights and measures
also continues the work in Paris I
attention to the necessity
invite your atenton t tle leei
ty for an appropriation on to b made to
enable this government to comply
with the obligations under the
metrical convention Our friendly
relations with the German Empire
continue without interruption At
a recent international exhibition of
fish and fisheries at Berlin the par
ticipation of the Tnited States not
withstanding the haste with which
the commission was forced to make
its preparations was extremely suc
cessful and meritorious winning for
private exhibitors numerous awards
of high class and for the country at
large the principal prize of honor
offered by His Majesty the Emperor
Lime result of this great success can
not but be advantageous to this im
portant and growing industry There
nave been some questions raised b
ween the two governments n t
he proper effect and interpretation
f our treaties of naturalization but
I = < t r = = <
recent uispaicues irom our JUOlSLr
at Berlin show that favorable pro
gress is making toward a under
standing in accordance with the
views ot this government which
makes and admits no distinction
whatever between the rights
of native and naturalized citizens
of the United States Complaints
of molestation suffered by natural
ized citizens abroad have never been
fewer than at present There is no
thing of importance to note in our
unbroken friendly relations with the
governments of Austria Hungary
Hussia Portugal Sweden Norway
Switzerland Turkey and Greece
During last summer several vessels
belonging to the merchant marine
of this country sailing in neutral
waters were fired at boarded and
searched by an armed cruiser of the
Spanish government The circum
stances a reported involve not only
private injury to the persons con
cerned but also show too little ob
servance of the friendly relations existing I
isting for a century between this
country and Spain The wrong was
brought to the attention of the
Spanish government in a serious
protest and remonstrance and
the matter is undergoing
investigation by the royal
authorities with a view to
such explanation or reparation a
may be ea led for by the facts The
commission sitting in this city for
the adjudication of claims of our
citizens against the government of
Spain is i I hope approaching the
termination of its labors Claims
against the Unite States under the
Florida treaty with Spain were sub
mitted to Congress for its action and
I again invite your attention to this
long standing question with a view
to the final disposition of the matter
At the invitation of the Spanish
government a conference has re
cently been held at the city of Mad
rid to consider the subject of protec
don by foreign powers of the native
Moors in the empire of Morocco
The minister of the United States
in Spain was directed t take part I
in the deliberations of this confer
ence the result of which is a con
vention signed on behalf of all the
powers represented The instru
ment will be laid before the Senate
for its consideration The gov
ernment of the United States
has also lost no opportunity
t urge upon the Emperor of Moroc
co necessity in accordance with
the humane and enlightened spirit
of the age of putting an end to the
persecutions which have been so
prevalent in that country of persons
of a faith other than Moslem and
especially of theHebre v residents of
Morocco The consular treaty con
cluded with Belgium is not
ye officially promulgated ow
ing to the alteration of a word in the
Senate of the United States which
occasioned delay during which the
time allowed for ratification expired
LIme Senate will be asked t extend
he period for ratification The attempt
tempt to negotiate a treaty of extra
dition with Denmark failed on ac
count of the objection of the Danish
government to the usual clause providing
viding that each nation should pay
the expense of the arrest the pris
oners whose extradition it asked
RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND JAPAN
The provision was made by Con
gress at its last session for the ex
pense of a commission which has
been appointed t enter upon
negotiations with the Irn
Kirial government of China I
on subjects of great interest
The relations of the two countries en
abled the Commissioners to proceed
at once upon their mission The Im
erial Government to
penal Goerment was prepared
five prompt and respectful atten
tion to the matters brought under
negotiation and the conferences pro
ceeded with such rapidity and pro
gress tha on the 17th of November
lat two treaties were signed at
Pekin one relating to the introduc
tion of Chinese into this country
and ono relating to commerce Mr
Frescott ono of the Commissioners
is now on the way home bringing
the treaties and it i expected they
will b received in season to be laid
before the Senate early in January
Our Minister in Japan has negoti
ated a convention for the recipro
cal relief of shipwrecked seamen
I I take occasion to urge once more
upon Congress the propriety of
making provision for the erec
tion of suitable fireproof build
ngs at the Japanese capital
for the use of the American legation
and the court hoise and jail con
nectedwith it The Japanese gov
ernment with great generosity and
courtesy has offered for this purpose
a piece of land
In my last annual message I call
ed the attention of Congress to the
subject of the indemnity funds re
ceived some years ago from China
and Jap I renew the recommen
dation then made that whatever
portions of these funds are due t
American citizens should be prompt
ly paid and the residue t the na
tions respectively to which they
justly and equitably belong
ROCMANIA
The extradition treaty with the
kingdom of Roumania which ha
been for some time in course of ne
gotiation has during the past years
been conceded and duly ratified
Relations of friendship and amity
have been established between the
government of the United States
and that of Roumania We have
sent a diplomatic representative tc
Bucharest and have received at
this capital a special envoy
who has been charged by his roya
highnes prince Charles toannouiitt
the independent sovereignity ofRou

ment of commercial relations between
tween the two countries
MEXICO
In my last annual message I e
I presed the hope that the theprevalenci
of quiet on the border between thi
I country and Mexico would soon be
como s assured n t justify the
modification of the orders then i
force to our military commanders
in regard 1 crossing the frontier
without encouraging such disturb
ances a would endanger r the peace
of the two countries Events moveu
in accordance with these expecta
tions and the orders were according
ly withdrawn to the entire satis
faction of our own citizens and the
Mexican Subsequently

ly time peace of the border was again
destroyed by a savage foray under
the command of Chief Victorio but
by the continued and harmonious
action of the military forces of
both countries his band has been
broken up and substantially destroy
ed There i reason t believe that
the obstacles which have so long
prevented rapid and convenient
communication between the United
States and Mexico by railways are
on the point of disappearing and
that several important enterprises 01
this character will soon b set on
foot which cannot fail t contribute
largely to the prosperity of this
country New envoys from Guate
mala Colombia Bolivia Venezuela
and Nicaraugua have recently ar
rived at this cpial whose distinc

best guarantee of the continuance
of friendly relations between our

LEGAL TENDERS
There are still in existence 346
81016 in United Slates legal tender
notes These notes were authorized
as a war measure made necessary by
the exigencies of the conflict in which
the United States was then engaged
The preservation of the nations
existence required in the judgment ot
Congress the issue of legal tender
paper money That it served well
the purpose for which it was created
is not questioned but the employ
ment of notes aa paper money in
definitely after the accomplishment
cf the object for which they were pro
vided was not contemplated by the
framers of the law under which they
were issued The noted long since
became like any other pecuniary
obligation of government a debt to
> e paid and when paid to be can
called as a mere evidence of in
ebtednesa no longer existing I there
fore repeat what was said in my
annual message of last year that the
retirement from circulation of United
Statcu notes with the capacity ol legal
ender in private contracts ia a step
to be taken in oar progress towards
cafe and stable currency which should
be accepted as the policy and duty of
government ia the interest and ee
urity of the people
THE STANDARD DOLLAR
At the time of the passage of the
act now in force requiring the coin
age of silver dollars fixing their value
and giving thorn a legal tender char
ter it was believed byjjmany sap
orUrs of the measure that the silver
dollar which it authorized would
speedily become under the operations
a the law of equivalent value to the
gold dollar There were other sup
porters of the bill who while they
doubted as to the probability of this
result nevertheless were willing to
give the proposed experiment a fair
trial with the view to stop the coin
age if experience should prove that
he silver dollar authorized by the
nil continued to bootless commercial
value than the standard gold dollar
The coinage of silver dollars under
the act referred to began in March
1878 and has been continued aa rs
uired by the acfe The average rate
per month to the present time is
2276492 The total amount coined
prior > to the lit of November last
was 72847150 Of this amount
47084450 remain iu tae treasury
end only 25763291 are in the
lands of the people Constant effort

in circulation and considerable ez
pease bes been necessarily incurred I
for the purpose but iU return to the
treasury is promot and cure Con
mary to the confident anticipation of
friends ol the measure at the time of
its adoption the value of the silver
dollar containing 412 grains of silver
has not increased During the year
prior to the passage of the bill au
aorizirjg its coinage tho market
value of the silver which it contained
was from 90 to 92 cents aa compared
with standard gold dollars Dar
nz last year the average anti market
value of the silver dollar has been 88 <
eats It ia obvious that the legisla
ion of the last Congress in regard to
silver so far AS it was baid on an au
icipated rime in the value of silver as
a result ot that legislation baa failed
to produce the eflect then predicted
The longer the law remains in force
requiring as it does the coinigefof a
nominal dollar which in reality it not
It t Ii
a uoiiar mo greater uuuuujca tua
danger that this country will be forc1
to accept a single metal as the sole
legal standard of value in circulation
and this a standard ot lea value than
it purports to be worth in the recog
nizsd money of the world The con
stitation of the United Stile sound
financial principles and oar beat
interests all require tht we have
as HJ legal leader money both gold
and silver of intrinsic value aa bul
lion equivalent to that upon its face it i
purports to poseaa The constitution
in express terms recognizes bath gold
and silver as the only true legal en
der money To banish cither of thes
metals from oar currency ia to nar
row and limit the circulating medium
of exchange to the disparagement
of important interests The Unite
States produces more silver than an
other country and is directly inter
ested in maintaining it aa one cf the
two precious metals which furnish
the coinage of the world It will in
judgment contribute to this re
L
Efc
I salt if congress trill repeal so much of i
the existing legislation aarcquues the
coinage of a silver doUr containing t
only 412k grains of euver and in Its
stead will authorize the secretary
of the treasury to coin silver dollars
of equivalent value as bullion with
gold dollars This mil defraud no
man and will be iu accordance with
familiar precedents Congress has r
on several occasions alterad the ratio
of value between gold and silver in
order to establish it more nearly in
accordance with the actual ratio of
val > e between the two metals In
financial legislation every measure
in the direction of great fidelity in the
discharge ot pecuniary obligations
baa been found by experience to di
minish the rates of interest which
debtors are required to pay and in
crease the facility with which money
can ba obtained for every legitimate
purpose Our own recent finaooial his
tory show how surely money becomes
abundant whenever confidence in
the exact performance of monied
obligations ii established
THE ARMY
The secretary ol war report that
the expenditures of the war depart
ment for the fiscal ycor ended June
80th 1880 was 39924773 The ap
propriations for this department for
bo current fiscal yesr amount to 41
903630 With respect to the army
be secretary invites attention to the
act that its strength la limited by
statute section 1115 revised statute
to not more than 30000 enlsted
men but that the proviso contained
in appropriation bills havi limited
bo expenditures to an enli mont of
but 15COO It is believed the full
legal strength is the leatt possible
force at which the present organize
tion can be maintained having in
view efficiency discipline and
economy While the enlistment
of this force would add somewhat to
be appropriation for the pay of the
array the saving made in other re
spects would be more than equivalent
for this additional outlay and the
efficiency of the army would be
largely increased The rapid exten
km of the railroad system weet of 3
he Mississippi River and the great
tide of settlers which hm flowed in
upon the nosy t err i ton imprse on
the military an entire citame of
policy The maintenance of email
posts along wagon and stse routes of
travel ia no longer necessary Perma
nent quarters at points ejected f a
more substantial character than
those heretofore constructed will bo
required Under existing laws per
manent buildings cannot be erected
without the sanction of Congress
and when sales of military
sites and buildings have been
authorized the moneys received
have reverted to the treasury and
could only become available through
new appropriations Is is recom
mended that provisions be made by a
general statute for the sale of such
abandoned military posts and build
ings as are found unnecessary and
for the application of the proceeds to
the construction of other posts While
many ot the present posts are of but
slight value for military purpose
owing to the changed condition of
bo country their occupation is con
tinned at great expense and great in
convenience because they aflord the
only available shelter for troop
The absence of a large number of
officers of the line ou active duty
from their regiments is a serious
drawback to the maintenance of the
service The constant demand for
small detachments each ot which
should be commanded by a commis
sioned officer and the various details
of officers for necessary service away
from their command occasion a
scarcity in the number required for
company duties With the view to
essoningthis drain to some extent
it is recommended that slaw be made
authorizing the detail ot officers from
tho active list aa professors of tallies
and military science at certain colleges
and universities be so amended as to
provide that all such details be made
from the retired list of the army
Attention ia asked to the necessity of
providiiig legislation for organizing
inning anddisaiplining the active mi
litia of the country and liberal appro
priations are recommended in this
behalf The reports of the adjutant
general of the army and the chief
ordnance touching this subject fully
set forth its importance The report
of officers in charge of education in
the army shows there are 78 schools
now in operation in the army with an
aggregate attendance of 2305 enlist
ed men and children The secretary
recommends the enlistment ot 150
school masters with the rank and pay
of f commissary sergeant An appro
riation is needed to supply the judge
Advocate of the army with suitable
libraries and the secretary recom
mends that the corps of judge advo
cates be placed upon tbeeame footing
SB to promotion with other staff
corps of the army under existing
laws The bureau of military Justice
consists of one officer judge advocate
general and the corps of judge advo
cates ot eight officers of equal rank
majors with the provision that the
iimitof i the corps shall remain at four
when reduced by casualty or resigna
lon to the number The consohda
ion of the bureau of military malice
and corps of judge advocates upon
the same basis with other etafl corps
of the army would remove an unjust
discrimination against deserving offi
cers and subserve the interests of the LI
