. to" President Wilson . f
Expressing its appreciation of ..the
need of steps -for, 'national defence, a
speeiaf committee .of the Sons of the
AYnericaii . Revolution has -forwarded
to President Wilson for the Connecti
cut society, . a letter expressing- the
state organization's ,i sentifnents. The
le(tter follows: : v', , ' ' .
"The board of managers of the Con
necticut society, j Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution, at a meeting held i at'
New Haven on Nov."24, 1916, appoint
ed the undersigned a committee to ex-,
press to the President of the' United
States the , keen . appreciation . on the
part of-the board, of the need of rea
sonable", national; defense. ' i. '? -: i
"The ' spirit ,aiid . wisdom of the
founders -.of our' .government, directed,
toward the problems which -confronted
them -at . the. birth" of this .nation, is
particularly desirable; in Jhe present
world crisis. Lives and property have
been' expended . to,. maintain our na
tional -integrity but who can, how.
doubt the, propriety of the cost;? Even
those -who formerly i differed 'On prin
ciple, are now among its most: ardent
champions.' ..' : . ' ; .
."The recent . experience ' of peaceful
people has demonstrated that kind
ness and love cannot .be .relied upon
alone to ; protect them in their rights
against avarice and crime. . but tnat
some strong- means are required to
Insure, the enjoyment" of those rights.
We have had the priceless blessings of
a beneficent government and in order
to safeguard its existence 'we believe
it is necessary that every . man of
every creed and color in our . citizen
ship should be trained to a patriotic
understanding that it is tiis duty to
be prepared to Offer sacrifices, if
necescary, for a continuation of those
blessings. We also believe that the
welfare of the whole country dema'nds
that our federal authorities and rep
resentatives make s suitable prepara
tions at this time to guasd against the
evils, which otherwise are sure- to beset-it."

The , report declares that "it cannot

of fortification is a progressive one,"
and points out that the country's coast
defense equipment has not kept pace

ments in naval armament against
which It ' must be matched. While o
mention' is maSe of the $80,000,000 four
year program urged by the , adminis

sular possessions.
After , hearing President Wilson's
