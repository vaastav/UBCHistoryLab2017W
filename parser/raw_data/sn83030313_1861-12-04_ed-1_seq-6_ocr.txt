THUJ SITUATION.
THE WAR.
The President's Message was sent to Congress
yesterday. As might be expected, it bears mainly
Upon I lie all-important question of tbe war. A*
^re give it in full in another column, and comment
upon it editorially, It is unttecc.-iaiy to enter into
any remarks upon it here. We give also the re
port of tbe Secretary of the Navy an attract
of tbe report of the Postmaster General, and the
report of the Secretary of War in full.
Ollicial despatches have been received relative
to the reconnoissances of Generals Hlenkcr ami
MeCall's divisions, which we reported yesterday.
The prisoners taken from tho rebels have made
gouio valuable reports to General McClellnn.
Our naval expeditious form no inconsiderable
part of the appliances used for the extinction of ti e
rebellion, whether on the Atlantic seaborn d or the
JMisai*sippi. the great interior water highway of the"
West. In ndditiou to the expeditions against I lat
teras, Port Hoyal and the Savannah river, which
Lave proved no successful, another fleet is tww in
*)ourse of preparation at New London, Conn., and
frill sail in a few days, carrying six thousand tons
)f stone, for Charleston harbor. These vos els,
f-imberng twenty, will be sunk in the shipehaunel,
let ween Morris and Sullivan islands aid Stouo I
Inlet. The '? irbor of Charleston will thus be oflee
tually blockaded.
Another naval and military expedition is about
to Ktari from St. Louis and Cairo, under the direc
tion of Gen. Ha'.leck and Commodore Fcote, com
prising a force of from eighty to a hundred thou
sand men. The destination of this graud expedi
tion and iis points of attack will undoubtedly be
Columbus, Ky.; Forts Wr ght, llnndolph and Har
ris, in Tennmee, and possibly the city of Mcmpl is.
We give to-day uiaj a of all these points, tog- ther
with the entrances to Charleston harbor.
Tho expedition on the Missi -ij'pi will consist of
eleven gunboats, carrying over or.': hundred lit avy
guns; thirty-eight floating batteries, each mounted
With a six t) -four pound eolurnbiad, and twenty
cigh' river steamboats. We tray expect some
brilliant feats Irom this expedition.
Our news from the South to-day is interesting,
as we gather it from Southern papers. The last
Intelligence from Pensacola reprc-cuts that the
fight had not been renewed, but it is said that
If the fire ori the rebel fort McRea had been . on
tinued that fort would have been destroyed It is
aa'd that the planters all along the rebel seaboard
Hie destroying their crops, Jest they should fall
into the hands of the Union forces.
A "cori.-|i.racy" of loyal citizens of New Orleans,
who desired a restoration of the Union, has been
recently discovered, and in consequence "cveral
arrests have beeu nmde in thai city. Much ex
citenveM exists there on the subject.
Tat* arrival of the transport I'ot'ipsco al this
port ye>ti lay, brings u* the laU st news from
I'ort lioyai. Nothing of consequence had trans
pired there since the sailing of the MoCIellan,
whose news we have already published.
Our despatches from I'arnestown, Maryland,
contuin some interesting accounts frem Cencral
Bank* ' command. Nothing of a striking charac
ter, however, has occurred in tl.at direction.

many years past. The case of Mr. Clemens was
referred to the Committee on Elections. Mr. 1'unn,
of Indiana, offered a resolution expelling Henry C.
Burnett, of Kontwky. Mr. Wicklifle, of Kentucky,
made a speech on the .question, in which he reca
pitulated the acts of the rebels to force Kentucky
out of the Union, and concluded with the prediction
that before the 20th of December not a hostile
foot of a rebel will be found trending the soil of
Kentucky. Tho resolution expelling Mr. Burnett
was adopted, and the payment of whatever salary
may be due him was ordered.

The first regular annual Message of President
Lincoln to the two houses of Congress is before
our readers. They will find it a plain, concise*
unpretending, business-liko exposition of our
foreign and domestic affairs, and the reader will
lay it down, satisfied from its intrinsic evidences
that the author of this State paper is fully en
titled to iiia t'umlliar designation of "Ilonest
Abe Lincoln."
This Message, moreover, is a reftftr^1?
short one ? a depurture from the usual long
wii ded annual Presidential partisan orations
which will be universally approved. Had Mr.
Lincoln followed the example of any one of his
"illustrious predecessors" of the lust thirty
years, with the abundant topics suggested l>y
the facts and developoments of this rebellion,
he might have inflicted upon us a Message of
twenty columns without exciting surprise. Cut
he says what he has to say within less than six
columns, including a smart little essay on ti e
sound political economy of our pftpular insti
tutions, in contrast with the monarchical ten
dencies of our revolted States.
Not without some apprehensions of foreign
intervention in this domestic wur of ours. Mr.
Lincoln discloses the true polfay in our foreign
relations, in bis hope that it will appear that his
administration has "practised prudence and
liberality towards foreign Powers, averting
causes of irritation, and with firmness main
taining our own rights and honor." To be
ready, however, against all possible contingen
cies, he recommends that adequate and ample
measures be adopted lor maintaining the publie
defences on every side, "iucluding our coast
line, our great frontier lakes and our rivers;"
and tlie e measures, lie suggests, should embrace
harboi and riter improvements.
When Mr. Dal 1 oh was our Minister at London
he wfl" serionsly annoyed on one occasion, ut a
diplomatic reception, by the presence of a glu
tei in^ African representing the government of
Ilayti. During the term also of the late John
Y. Mason. as our Minister at Paris, the ebony
ambassador from his ebony majesty Faustin
Soul'^i'iua confronting, on one occasion, our
Minister in his official capacity at tho Tuile
ries, "That strapping Wftro," said Mason, ''is
out of his place. He would bring Giteen hr.n
died dollars in New Orleans." These incidents
will serve to indicate the difficulty which has
prevented thus far the recognition by our go
vernment of the nationality of Ilayti and Li
beria. Mr. Lincoln, however, says that "if any
good reason exists why we should persevere
longer in withholding our recognition of tho in
dependence and sovereignty of Ilayti and Li
beria. I am unable to discern it." The ques
tion appears to us a very tlelicWe one, ar.d we
think it would bo best to let it alone.
The Message speaks encouragingly of the
good condition of the Treasury, and calls the
attention or Congress to the financial views -nd
recommendations of Secretary Chase, not yet
reported. And so in reference to the reports of
tho other department#. They are made more
intimately than heretofore the views of the Pre
sident ? a fact which establishes the practical
unity of the President uikl bi? Cabinet. It i-< on
this account that the report of Mr. Secretary
Cameron with its ehjectionaMe features in re
tard to the slaves of Southern lebels, has been
recommitted inie his hands, to be revised ac
cording to the President's policy.
The suggestions of the Message In respect to
the reconstruction of the Supreme Court, if sub*
initted two years ago. would have created a
terrible political agitation; lor at that time this
court was regarded as the last bul
wark of Southern slavery. At present., how
ever. in the midst of this Southern rebellioin,
the reconstruction of the Supreme Court is re
duced to a simple question of convenience to the
loyal States, and the President's views on the sub
ject are entitled to the practical consideration of
? ,'ongresB. The same may be said oi his views in
regard to a convenient abridgement of tho
laws of Congress and som** special legislation
touching the temporary "administration of jus
tice in all such parts of the insurgent States and
Territories as may be under the control of this
government.'' This is an important matter, as
it is intended to reveh some portions ol tin- two
hundred millions of dollars of debts due from
citizens of the South to citizens of our loyal
States.
We pass over the numerous other topic* of
tl?c Me -sage to the main question ? ihe disposi
tion to be mu le of i !<e slaves of, Southern rebels
f illing into toe h inds of our armies. The I're i
?ient says that such contraband negroes now
under the charge of our various aimy camps are
legally tree. He expects some of the States also
(Kentucky and Missouri, we presume) to pass
laws confiscating and liberating tie slaves of
rebels. Hut what is to be done with all these
liberated slaves? Mr. Lincoln recommends their
colonization iu some "congenial clime." and
nil other free persons of color among us who
may choose fo join In the enterprise: and lie
suggests for this purpose ihe purchase <>f a con
veuant bit of tropical territory. This plan
some TtfO years ago was broached ii. Congress
in regard 10 our free negroes, and some locality
in Centriil#Anieri(a was then suggested as the
fie'd ior the colony. We think it, highly proba
i bio that this is the idea of Ihe Message; for
j where else can we jp lo purclm^ "the con
] genial clime" referred to suftieieuily conveni
j et t to answer ti e purpose in view, unless wo
; go to the island of Havti'
I , " til
At all events, ibis prop *itioa of colonisation
I shows that Mr. Lincolu comprehends the I'oliy
i and cruelty of any large emanc ipation of So .h
] em slaves if they .ire to be turned loose to shift
I lor themselves in the rui:ed Stav?. llis plan of
j amelioration is perhaps -,i.e beat tha. could be do
? vi-ed. and the only one, we think, whereby
emancipation or free negroee cno be turned to
any good account. The question forced upon
i the administration by tl.< "contraband ne:-. ??>
in our army i ami ' h.m ' : i> nt'.y been a very
i embarrassing one so Mr. Lincoln. ? lie cannot
i. ike these slaves ofSontl ?? ?? rebels, forfeited to
tie ."vcrnini.'nt, exeejil fret-men. What. th, a.
is i i be i lone u ;ih them We recognise at once
ihe wisdom and humanity ol Mr. Lincoln in

triotic devotion to the Union.
The Report of th* Secretary of the VtTy>
Tho report of Mr. Secretary Welles embraces
throe or four points of very general interest and
importance, and Ib therefore a document which
will be extensively rend by all classes of the
comC?u25,7* Tlie document is a plain, intelli
gible and b.,.ml)'0 statement of the work of the
Naval Department C! the government since the
4th of March last. The pubJ.'c will be somewhat
surprised to learn tho vast augmentation of our
uaval forco that has been effected within the
short space of eight months. Mr. Welles gives
the facts and figure*, and we will take the liber
ty of summarizing them.
Our effective navy at home and abroad con
sisted, on the 4th of March last, of 42 ves
sels of all classes, carrying 555 guns and about
7,600 men. The Department set to work to i\
pair and have put in commission the vessels ly
ing at the various navy ytf ' dismantled and
in ordinary; to have adti I vessels con
structed, and to purchase and tit out mercantile
vessels; and so energetically was this work per
formed that we have now a navy of 264 vessels,
of the aggregate tonnage of 218,061 tons, manned
by about 22,000 s-amen. Compare these figures
with those of March last, and the wonderful ener
gies which the Department has put fori U ill
be apparent in thu result. The estimate of ex
penses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18l>3,
is $44,625,065 02.
Secretary Welles ia prudently rcwrved on
the subject of the llockadc. It is apparent that
on thi't point be does not claim mucb credit lor
the navy. He does ("peak, indeed, of ?'th? brief
and feeble chase' ' of the privateer Sumter by
the steamer Brooklyn, anil says that an investi
gation into the matter was ordered. But if he
cannot take credit to his department for the
manner in which the blockade is- enforced, the
successful naval expeditions furnish him with
sufficient cause for satisfactions He gives a suc
cinct history of the capture of forts llatteras aud
Clark, on the North Carolina coast, by the ex
pedition under command of Commodore String
ham and General Butler, and of forts Beaure
gard and Walker, at the entrance So Port Royal,
by the expedition under command of Commo
dore Dupont and General Sherman; also of the
occupation, of Tv bee Island, at the mouth of the
Savannah river. This, latter demonstration
affords him the gratifying opportunity of saying
that "the flhg of ihe Union is again nnfurled in
Georgia." The report contaius a short para
graph referring to the projected movement on
the Mississippi river. It also alludes to the
operation# of the "stone fleet" which was -sent
it says, "to obstruct the channels of Charleston
harbor and Savannah river."
The Secretary of the Navy commends and en
dorse^ the action. ?f Commodore Wilkes in in
tercepting the British steamer Trent, in
tlie Bahama channel, on tho 8th of
November, ami taking from hor the
rebel conspirators Mason and Slidell. He
does -not speak of them as "ministers," or
"commissioners '' or '?emissaries," but only as
' disloyal citizens and leading conspirators."
'?The prompt and decisivo action of Cuptain
Wilkes," he says, "merited and received the em
phatic approval of the Department," and he
intimates tkii the non-seizure of the Trent her
self must not be regarded as a precedent
hereafter.
Mr. Welles manifests a like skilful avoidance
of the uje of a word of doubtful propriety when
bo coiuefr to discuss the question of fugitive
slaves, as he does in diseasing the arrest of the
rebel Commissioners. He does not once allude
to them as slaves, and uo one would imagine,
from reading the paragraph on the subject, that
it retort ed to negroes at all. lie speaks of them

Animal Report on the Post Office.
Tho report of the Postmaster General, like
those of tin" other great departments of our
government, is looked for with more than ustui
interest. Without possessing the national im
portance at this period that is assigned to tho
War, Navy and Treasury reports, we look in
the workings of our postal system for the evi
dences of social and commercial prosperity.

As the postal service v. as not discontinued iu
the revolted State# till near the clot* of the fo
cal year, the postal balance is not largely affect
ed thereby; but another year wo shall be ena
bled to see tie temporary advantages in aflnon
clal point of view of having the South provide
for their own mail service. As the complaints
respecting Jeff. Davis' postal system have been
like Macbeth's curses, both loud and deep, wo
anticipate the lively satisfaction with which the
musses at the South will grot-t a return to tho |
embrace of the Union. I
The Post Office Department ? evidently im
proving 1U Snaiiriftl condition with considera
ble rapidity. The total expenditures for tie
fiscal year 1861 were $13,606,759, being a de
decrease on tho expenses of I860 of no less than
$1,208,014, while the gross revenue amounted
to $0,049,290, a decrease from the year 1860
of only $168,771. Were the United States to tell
Secessia to go off ?nd support itself, our Post
Office would not only be self-supporting, lyit
we might at once have a material reduction in
all of Ottr rntes of postage, without any draft
on the l ie;, ury. As the revolted States evi
dently cannot support themselves, they will not
be permitted to leave the Union.
The comparative utility of our postal estab
lishment to the different sections of the country
may be seen in the simple fact that the State of
New York alone, in 185(1, sent through
the mails 29,259,943 Jetfers, while the
number pent in all of the disloyal States was
only 22,130,542. Including Delaware, Mary
land and Kentucky ? that is, all of the slave
States except Missouri ? the number of letters
s*nt through tho Post Office in 1856 was only
28,820,629, or less than the number furnished
by the State of New York alone. The next
largest number of letters Inrmlebed was
Pennsylvania, 12,045,863, and Massachusetts,
11,362,071. While cotton is not king of tho
Post Office, we see, in unmistakeaMe propor
tions, the commercial and social position of tho
Empire State.
When we have time to look over the entire
report of the Postmaster General, wo shall be
better uble to judge of the* action tak?n by
the head of the Department, and the rscom
mendations he has seen fie to make for further
and greatly needed improvements in our postal
nyetem.
TlinTrtbnne In Its Last Struggle!? Gree
ley tu the Gift Lottery Bu*lne*?.
It seems that the present war, which the abo
litionists did so much to cause, has, with a sort
of retributive justice, visited Ha aorest afflictions
upon the abolitionists themselves. That aboli
tion organ, the Tribune, is the greatest and the
representative sufferer. Our readers will re
member that, as the pressure of poverty grew
more arid more severe, Greeley cut down the
size ol'his Tribune ; cut down the salaries of his
employes; cut down the quality of his white
paper, and tried hard to cut down the wages of
hi3 printers, but was prevented by the Herald.
Ho would have cut down his dividends
al-o, T>ut for tho fact that the Tribune pays
no dividends to its stockholders, and has
long been the most " fancy" Btaek in the
market. Everything else lias failed, how
ever, and now, gathering the remnant of his
raggad associates about him. Greeley has de
termined to try the gift enterprise lottery busi
ness. The spectacle of Greeley, out at the
knees and elbows, and with an empty and aching
stomach, is touching. We pity him, and our
pity takes a most practical shape, for we print
his- prospectus for his new business in our ad
vertising columns this morning, and we do it
at half price.
We trust that all of our numerous readers
will peruse this advertisement ? at half price.
We are so sorry for poor, ragged Greeley that
we depart, for this time only, from our usual
rates, and are only saddened by the thought
that the pitiable object of our charity is so un
worthy; for he clings to his nigger still, like a
broken down drunkard to his bottle. And yet,
what should wo do without him ? Now that
crazy Wise is monopolized by the rebel press,
and the Chevalier Webb has editorially d<f
ceased, how should wo point our moral or
adorn our tale without poor Greeley ? The en
tertainment and instruction which his ex imple
and our comments thereupon have afforded our
read?rp must not be lo*t. But to think that it
should come to this ! Greeley in the gift en
terprise lottery business ! Poor, lost soul ! Wo
run take no blame for Lis ruin upon ourselves.
We have wai ned. advised and entreated him to
eitl'er seek some business for which he is better
tilled than conducting a newspaper, or else to
try to bo a sensible and a decent man. We*
wrestled with him, and threw every impedi
ment in his road to ruin, but in vain. He would
have his own bad way, and it has led
him into that vile lottery business, which he
used so much to loathe and rebuke. Now he
' is obliged having lost ull his own subscribers,
t . appeal to tho IIhiuld's readers through this
lottery advertisement at half price. Look at
Greeley's ragged coat, his tattered trowsers,
i his well-worn hat, his unmatched boots, his
cadaverous countenance, his emaciated form,
and see tho fate of an abolition -editor. We
have prinTed his lottery advertisement at half
price; but our charity goes tart tier. We w 11
crive our old clothes, hats and boots to Greeley,
i he will call for them. We used to give thc-o
articles to tho niggers lie lov^d so well j but
how much more appropriately can they be
given to this nigger worshipper in. distress.
Also-? we sigh to vffite ij, ? our slop?, crumbs

The SMMiloniiti of the Snath and (he
Abollt touiat* of (he North ok the New
York Herald.
We publish this morning two vnj curious
articles upon the New York Herald ? the one
from Goodell's radical abolition organ, the
Frinclpia, and tho other from ??Cobbett," the
UicUmond correspondent of the Now Orle.,j>e
l'ioiyunt. TLom? articles we commend to the>
attention of our readers. They are interesting,
not only as new proofs of the coincidence ia
opinion of fhe radical disnnionists. North ami
South, but also as fair tpeciaiettB of the matter
and manner of the attacks upon the Hsu vt.u
Regarded in either light, they will be found
equally amusing and instructive. They demon
strate conclusively that the radical disunionisti
of both sections fear and respect that influence
of the Hf.r AM) which has been so often disputed
and so often admitted by all parties, and that
to hate and dread the Herald is the first lesson
'n the education of a secessionist or an aboli
tionist. The liato a:id the attacks of these radi
cals are our highest praise, and the very best
evidences oi' our conservative, national, popular
course.
It is not at all singular that all enemies Of
our country should attack the Herald, and that
the rebel? of the South, the abolitionists of tiit
North and the aristocrats of Europe should
alike abuse it. The Herald is a Union journal,
and is therefore exposed to th< enmity of ali
those who, for one cause or the other, wish to
destroy the Union. It is only the praise of di?
unionists that we mistrust ? their blame is the
surest proof of the righteousness of our courtte.
But it is singular how these attacks, from differ
ent quarters, contra-lict each other. In Jeff.
Davis' kingdom the chief authorities only are
allowed to read the Herald, and iis circulation
among the people is interdicted by severe pe
nalties, even to the arrest and imprisonment ol
tho3e discovered with a copy of it about them.
Would this be the case if, as the abolitionist*
say, we sympathize with the rebels and are aid
ing them at home and abroad? At the North
the abolitionists revile and abuse us. Would
this be the e*ue if we were, as the rebels de
clare, in favor of abolltionis-m'.' In England tie
journals snail nnd bark at us. Would they do
this if, as the abolitionists say. we are moisting
England's designs upon this country? Like tho
Kilkenny cats, our assailants destroy each otter,
and leave us only a stray claw a id a little flic
to laugh at. In these curious articles this point
is remarkably developed.
But we have also in these extract* a synopsis
of those old and new charges against ti>e 11k
ra.u> which constitute the ammunition of our
opponents: and it is amusing to notice how much
credit they art: forced to mingle with tbefa blame,
as Balaam was made to bless most when he de
signed to curse most. The secessionists say
th it we "represent the genius of the universal
Yankee nation:'' that we "aspire to respfeeta
biLty," and that we have "brouj; lit an amount
of energy into play unequalled probably by
any of our cotemporary journals." This i?
very good and very true. L'ut then the rebels
add that we began oi.r career by "black mail
ing - an old lie. which No.ih and his tribe
stai ted, years ago. and which lms not e\ en the
.smallest grain of truth about it. t hen the Hi b
ai.d is praised for ''maintaining measures wiih
vigor aud power." The correspondent ex
claims, "What a circulation it has attained, and
what a wealthy establishment it 1ms beconiel"
Our articles are said to be of "a spicy charac
ter; a vein of humor has pervaded them and
occaMonn'ly (only occasionally'.') scintillations
of wit, (hat have made them uucUious and cap
tivating.-' Thank you, "Cobbett." "The edi
tor and his underlings have alw .v attained the
plausible in argument and prophecy, aud have
successfully made their appeals to what is callod
common sense." In the name of common sense,
to what could we better appeal? If the
| rebels had had any common sense our
appeals to them to remain in the Union
would hnve been more successful, aud.
when a sound drubbing has. ian-jlit them
Z CS!2mon sense idea or two they w,ll appre
ciate us all the be tcv. But "Coul.'^U says we
"change our opinions" ? the adage : ays a wine
in in sometime a does ? but accounts lo r it by
veiy truly remarking ihat ''timed change, and
nun change with them, and whal i ; patriotism
to day may be treason to mori v..'* We have
Tjothii g to add to this, for "Coll.ett" covers th'
whole SflSe and answers himself.
"Cobbmt" charges, however, that we ar
bought and sohf, Mid therefore argues th.it our
"talent of prophecy" was misapi lied when we
predicted tlie success ol the great expedition.
The rebels say we are b< ;>glu by tiie abolition
