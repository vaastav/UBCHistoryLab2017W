Celebration Yesterday Over the Clear.
Injj Up of the Debt of the Church --Addressee
by the Potior and Many Other
City Preachers.
Yesterday afternoon in the little
Howard avenue Baptist church one of
the most important services ever held
. within the walls of the church took
place and was presided over by the
pastor,' Rev. George B. Cutten. It was
the celebration of the occasoln of the
lifting of the burden from the church
property and during the service the
mortgages and all other deeds of debt
were burned in au . Egyptian incense
burner, the match being lighted by the
pastor. The total debt of the church
was $4,000, but since Rev. Mr. Cutten
became pastor of the church all this has
been lifted and to celebrate the occasion
the mortgages were burned.
The church was filled, every chair and
every nook and corner being occupied
with members and friends.
During the service many of the pas
tors of the city, all of whom were seat
ed on the platform, made five minute
addresses congratulating Rev. &r. Cut
ten and the congregation and speaking
words of encouragement for the future,
Rev. Mr. Cutten also epoke and thank
ed the ministers for their words of en
couragement and stimulation and told
of how the sum was raised, giving the
congregation an interesting account of
the work during the two years. Rev,
Mr. Cutten also said that the good work
was not going to cease with the clear
ing up of the debts, but that he and
the member of the church were going
right ahead in the same energetic man
ner until the church had a substantial
sum in its treasury. He also announc
ed that improvements in the church
would be made and that all the bills
necessary for the collection of the
money had been paid. This amounted
to $10.16 and together with the interest
during payment of mortgagee and the
total mortgages of $3,960 the sum paid
out was $4,096.24.
During the burning of these debts the
congregation rose and sang the doxol
ogy in a hearty manner. The antique
incense burned in which the Are was
started was on the platform in plain
view of every one in the church.
The programme opened at 3 o'clock
with a hymn and this was followed by
a prayer by Rev. C. W. Jackson. This
prayer was followed by addresses by
Rev. Harvey Burnes and Rev. E. C.
Sage, followed by a solo by Edward Ai
ling. The rest ef the programme con
sisted of addresses by Rev. W. J.
Mutch, Rev. Otto Konig, Rev. F. W.
Stone, Rev. W. H. Bawden, Rev.
George H Ferris, solos by Mrs. Kirk
land M. Llndroth. The services con
cluded about 4:30 o'clock with the bene
diction by Rev. E. C. Sage.

TEACHING YOUNG GERMANY
HOW TO DO THINGS.
One of the most interesting features
of German educational life is the "in
" dustrial art schools" in which young
.machinists are trained to become fore
men and superintendents of factories.
There are eleven such schools in the
City of Berlin, and they opened the fall
term with 2,512 pupils. They are sit
uated In different parts of the city to
serve the convenience of the working
classes, for whose benefit they are In
tended. There are two systems one
. ifurnlshes Instructions In every branch
of merchanlcal industry, including
designing, drawing, carving, moulding,
modeling, surveying, engineering,
chemistry, the use of Instruments of
precision and every phase of electrical
science and mechanics six hours a day
for six days in the week. For this an
annual fee of 100 marks ($25) Is charged.
In this school are representatives of the
middle classes of society, who are not
dependent upon their own earnings for
support the son of manufacturers,
merchants and skilled mechanics who
earn good salaries.
The other, system appeals to a much
larger class of the population, and
about 2,000 young men who are com
pelled to earn their own living, take
advantage of evening and Sunday In
struction that la given them for a nomi
nal fee Of 4 marks for the year for an
average of four lessons a week, and 6
marks a year for an average of six les
sons a week. Of course this fee Is
merely formal, and is intended to ap
peal to the self-respect of the pupil and
remove the odor of charity. For two
hours each evening and for four hours
each Sunday instruction is given those
whose circumstances compel them to
work during the week days. To enter a
candidate must have already gone
through the common schools and ac
quired solid foundation of general in
formation. He must also pass an ex
amination in mathematics, and must
have served an apprenticeship of at
least a year at some mechanical trade.
Upon entering the school he has an op
tion of seven or eight different depart
ments, all of them dealing with the
construction and operation of machin
ery, electric motors.pumping apparatus,
locomotive or stationary engines, spin
ning, weaving, molding, the manufac
ture and handling of all sorts of tools,
forging, and every other form of me
chanism. The instructors are practical
men, and each studpnt. must follow a
practical course. No time can be
wasted in experimental work. Upon
entering the school he must select his
trade, and he will be educated thor
oughly in that particular line of indus
try, so that he may not only be able to
operate, but to design and construct the
machinery that pertains to It. W. E.

"MRS. DANE'S DEFENSE" NEXT
WEDNESDAY EVENING.
Charles Frohman's Empire treater
company comes to New Haven' for its
annual visit next Wednesday evening,
when it will present "Mrs. Dane's De
fense" at the Hyperion theater. This
is the play by Henry Arthur Jones in
which the Empire theater company won
a tremendous all-season triumph in
New York last season. The Empire
company this season is headed by
Charles Riehman and Margaret Anglin.
Margaret 'Anglin, the leading woman, is
unquestionably one of the greatest fa
vorites with our theater-goers, and her
visit now is especially welcome because
she has a role in which she has tri
umphed magnificently and won the
most splendid success of her brilliant
career. Others of the company have

The sweet-voiced Irish comedian, An
dred Mack, gives one performance at
the Hyperion next Friday night, when
he, will be seen for the second time on
this stage in his new historical Irish
comedy drama, "Tom Moore." The ac
tion of the play begins about 1S06, when
the young poet began to write the war
songs of Ireland and fell in love with
beautiful Bessie Dyke, whom he mar
ried eventually. Their courtship is
made most romantic. There are many
and many a lover's quarrel, brought
about by a lordly admirer of the Irish
beauty, and it is in Tom's disgrace in,
London, where he is ejected from Carl
ton House by the Prince of Wales for
publishing a seditious poem, that her
great love is shown, and she marries
the happy but penniless poet and shares
his poverty with a loyal, honest love
until he is reinstated in royal favor.
Many well known men and women of
the day are characteristically repre
sented in the little play, which is a de
lightful one. Seats on sale Wednesday.
Prices $1, 75 cents, 50 cents, 35 cents and
25 cents.

ful of all plays that have ever been pro
duced in the past two theatrical sea
sons, will be presented at the Grand
Opera House to-night, to-morrow night
and Wednesday night and at the mati
nee Wednesday by an excellent cast of
players, including many of the original
interpreters of the picturesque and
quaint characters in the play, who tell
a most, beautiful. .love storya fltory
that appeals to the hearts and finer
feellngs of all who see it a pure, whole
some and moral story; a story that is
void of all suggest! veness; a story that
has not a word in it that could posBlbly
offend the most sensitive. Thi3 play
is the work of a clever actress who has
been seen in the leading support of
many of the best stars. . Her name is
Eleanor Merron, and she is perhaps the
most talked of playwright in this coun
try. Her writing of this work has
brought her both fame and fortune and
has placed her in the very front rank of
American authors. It will be presented
by a large and well selected cast of ar
tists, including many of the originals.
This company has been selected by
James H. Walllck, who is managing the
tour, with a special view as to the abil
ity of each one for the character they
represent. The play will be adequately
staged with all of the originai scenery,
costumes and effects that have made it
so popular and almost a household
phrase over the length and breadth of
this country. No play ever written and
produced In this country can show the
same record as "The Da!ry Farm," that
of three century runs in the three larg
est cities in this country, namely, New
York 109 performances, Philadelphia 137
and Chicago 133.
