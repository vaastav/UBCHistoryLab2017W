It is reported that Germany is es
tablishing a submarine base on an
island off the coast of Venezuela. It
the report is true, another one of
the few fragile threads binding Ger
many and the United States in
friendly relations probably will be
severed.
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is a large amount to pay for
capturing a bug. But if the bill of
fered to locate and confine the germ
of infantile paralysis, sponsored by
Representative Gallivan, accomplishes
ts purpose, the whole country will
;ay it was well worth the price.
Increased pay for government em
ployes, the Saturday half-holiday -all
the year around, votes for women,
peace in Europe, reduction of the
cost of living, and a settlement of
he Mexican problem are only a few
)f the many things that Santa Claus
may stuff in the stockings on the
nantel if he intends to be a "regular
fellow" this year.
Now that the use of steel helmets
in the European trenches has become
common practice, the neutral nations
again are awakened to the fact that
fighting is returning to the methods
of the middle ages by the announce
ment that British soldiers are to be
provided with suits of armor. It
seems a pity that the result cannot be
Jetermined by an old-fashioned joust.
"We denounce the profligate waste
of money wrung from the people by
oppressive taxation through the lav
ish appropriations of recent Repub
lican Congresses which have kept
taxes high and have reduced the pur
chasing power of the people's toil.
We demand a return to that simplic
ity and economy which befits a dem
ocratic government and a reduction
in the number of useless offices, the
salaries of which drain the substance
of the people."
The above pledge made in the
Democratic platform of 1912 is in
teresting when considered in ronnec
tion with the recent unprecedented
expenditures of Congress and the
estimates of the higher cost of run
ning the government during the fis
cal year ending June 3o, 1918, sub
mitted to Congress Monday by
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo.
Apparently the' Democrats are not
any more capiable of fulfilling pledges
than the Republicans and the failure
of both parties to keep their prom
ises rapidly is convincing the voter
to place no faith in political pledges.

Nr. Wie's Messge
President Wilson's address. to Con
gress was brief in words vad in the
legislative program which it outlined.
Those who expected the President
to treat the high cost of living as the
vital question of the day and make
some recommendation looking to re
lief from the situation with which
the whole country is grappling were
disappointed. Representative Fitz
gerald, of Brooklyn, sponsor for food
embargo legislation and other draltic
measures designed to furnish a rem
edy for high prices, showed his dis
appointment in a statement which he
made after the President's address.
Others who expected the President
to make definite recommendations for
the standardization of salaries of gov
eminent employes, with perhaps a
word on 'retirement legislation, lie
tened in vain for such passages. Their
hopes now center in a special mes
sage based on the facts procured by
Federal investigators probing the
' --h cost of living.
rhe body of the message is a se
,uel to the railroad legislation of the
last session. First, the President re
iterates his belief in the necessity of
enlarging the personnel of the Inter
state Commerce Commission by the
addition of two new mcmbers. This
increase to nine members will make
it possible to effect changes in the
administrative methods that long
have been deemed desirable. The
preliminaries to such enabling legis
lation alr'eady have Jeen completed
and there is no prospect that the rec
ommendation will meet any concerted
opposition in Congress.
President Wilson declines to lend
his support to compulsory arbitra
tion and contends that the Interstate
Commerce Commission has full au
thority to raise railroad rates if the
revenues of carriers are found to be
inadequate.
In his attitude both the brother
hoods and the railroad may find cause
for thanksgiving.
It is a very concise message and
does not present features that pre
sage a bitter fight in Congress. The
discussion of the Adamson law has
furnished members with much infor
mation on the subjects on which they
now mut legislate and the entire
program probably will be passed in
accordance with the President's
wishes.
The Sufragist Banner.
"Mr. President, what will you do
for woman's suffrage?"
These were the words inscribed on
a banner that was dropped on a gal
lery railing in the House of Repre
sentatives yesterday while President
Wilson was delivering his message to
Congress. The banner was unfurl
ed by a party of six well-known suf
fragists, members of the Congression
al Union for Woman Suffrage. The
President smiled, a page took posses
sion of the banner, policemen took
stations near the suffragists to see
that they indulged in no further dem
onstrations and the incident was end
ed.
The act may be described as ap
proaching closer to the militant
methods of the English suffragettes
than any demonstration made by the
suffragists of this country in many
months. The suffragists must have
awakened some admiration for their
courage in trespassing upon the for
mality attendant upon the delivery of
a Presidential message. They also
may win plaudits for their devotion to
the cause of votes for women.
But when the question of the real
material value of their action is given
consideration, the suffragists may be
given more censure than praise. It
is very doubtful if the unfurling of the
banner, interrupting the Chief Execu
tive's address, will result in any bene
fit to the cause of the suffragists.
Perhaps the chief result of such a
demonstration, novel and yet harmless
in the final analysis, will be a lash of
rather undesirable publicity which
will smack of what is known as
notoriety.
The Commissioners have asked
Congress to add forty more men to
the police force. The wisdom of the
request easily may be found in the
daily reports of robberies, hold-ups,
attacks on women and other. crimes.
The lKational Guard, also, Is not get
ting the recruits necessary to bring It
up to the strength provided for in the
army bill and without which the money
appropriated for its support can not be
given it. Even with the added induce
mnent of actual service. enough recruits
could not be had by the regiments that
went to the. border to fll their ranks.
Many regiments were only half strength.
The Missouri regiments which have
comne hohne were of that- class. Other
regiments still en the border are equally
denicient. What are we going to do
about it? P~aaps It Is this situation
that led to the unofficial statement in the
"Washington News,' that Imeident Wil
5on has-been converted to a belief In the.
necssty of universal trainingeand liabil
Ity for service.-st. Louis Star.
The Guardsmen would have seon cesma
to -empd If they had been plunged into
actual imar. But they are returning frain
the freatier with a cler comprehamnsan
of the leek of harmony in a military or
ganiatio half under State and half un
der Pederal centrol. Their fear that the
National Guard may not survve its or
deal is hardly Justified. It ertainly om

A shoittle ago there appeared in
the A~leMonthly an article en
ledf enty Min o Ralty.
The article sets forth an experience
of the author while he was co
ing in a hospital after a surgical
operation.
It w a gray March day with a
cloudy sky.. - ere was nothing un
usually exciting or exhilarating in
the convalescent's immediate atmos
phere or environment, when suddenly
e felt as if he had been translated
to a new world of light, happiness,
and Joy.
"I cannot say what the mysterious
change was" he said. "I saw no
new thing, but I saw all the usual
things in a miraculous new light-in
what I believe is their true light. I
saw for the first time how wildly
beautiful and joyous, beyond any
words of mine 'tO describe, is the
whole of life. Every human being
moving across that porch, every spar
row that flew, every branch tossing
in the wind, was caught in and was
a part of the whole ecstasy of loveli
ness, of joy, of importance, of intoxi
cation, of life. ... For those glorified
moments I was in love with every
living thing before me-the trees in
the wind, the little birds flying, the
nurses, the internes the people who
came and went. There was not'sing
that was alive that was not a miracle.
Just to be alive was in itself a mir
acle. My very soul flowed out of me
in a great joy."
If it is possible to live in a world
of happiness and beauty for twenty
minutes, is it not possible to prolong
the time-to live always in such a
world?
Lincoln said that "folks are usu
ally about as happy as they make up
their minds to be.' The experience
of the writer in the Atlantic Monthly
-as well as thousands of others that
might be cited-shows that the possi
bilties of happiness are inside, not
outside, of us.
The great mass of people do not
extract 1o per cent of the happiness
possible n their everyday life, largely
because they were never trained to
think of the normal sources of enjoy
ment. Their minds are blank, except
for the little grooves which their daily
routine has stamped in their brain
tissue. They are as ignorant of their
possible mental resources as the.early
Indians were of the natural resources
of this continent, when the Puritans
landed at Plymouth Rock. They
raised just enough barley to exist
upon. The did not know how to
feed, to e, or to enjoy themselves.
Their minds were blank. and they
lived in wretchedness, while the vast
resources of the richest continent in
the world were all unknown to them
Ruskin said he was not so much
surprised at what we suffer as at what
we lose, which might furnish infinite
pleasure and satisfaction. We hear a
great deal about the enormous loss
of our natural resources, the coal,
the waterpower, and the forests, but
they are nothing compared to the
tremendous loss in the possible re
sources of happiness all around us.
The things which really make life
worth living are very common, very
ordinary and within the reach of all.
How often we hear the poor berat
ing the rich whom they envy, bemoan
ing the cruel fate that has kept about
everything worth while away from
them, but when we stop to take stock
of life in the things that are really
worth while, that count for most, we
are pretty nearly all on an equal foot
The great Chemist himself has
mixed the atmosphere so that it is
just adapted to create health, vigor,
robustness of body and thought and
exultant feeling for all alike. The
sunlight with its marvelous chemistry
performs millions of miracles every
moment in root and rootlet, in plant
and flower, in tree, in animal life, in
human life, while painting pictures of
marvelous colorings, in flower, in
plant, in landscape.
The poorest, the humblest person
on earth has the same amount of
time as the proudest monarch or the
greatest money king. Andrew Car
negie said he would give $bo.oooooo
to have his life prolonged ten years;
but all his wealth cannot purchase,
one instant of time. Nor has money
power to purchase the best things in
life-love, friendship, sympathy. The
sweetest, the most desirable things
we know are purchasable only with
effort, with conduct, right thought,
ri ht effort.
If, like Pollyanna in the play of the
same name which all New York is
flocking to see, we make a habit of
looking for something to be glad
about, we shall very soon master the
secret of happiness. We shall master
the art of real living.
When railroad managers' and stockhold
ers assume a friendly attitude toward the
proposition of goverpment ownership of
railroads it is time for the general public
to become suspicious. For the managers
would not think of government owner
ship except as a wild-eyed scheme to de
nouinee and oppose if they were not be
ginning to think that the game isn't
worth the candle. The financial powers
which have stood behind the throne of
railroad managers wouldn't permit a rep
resentative of their. to hint at govern
mnent ownership unless other line, of in
dustry were more attractive, more profit
able and less of a strain upon financial
resources. In short, the joy of running
a railroad Is running out, railroads as
an investment are taking seats in the
rear.-Toledo Blade.
The Germans aren't beaten yet. Instead
of being effectually defeated by a com
bined great allied offensive, as waa the
expectation for the fail of 1s1s the Kaiser's
generals are pressing forward or holding
their own on nearly every front. Ru
mania, which wasn to have turned the tide
definitely toward the entente, seems due
for the fate of Belgium, Serbia and Mon
tenegro. The great alled offensive on
the western front made considerable
headway and then stopped. The Italians
captured Gorisla, but failed to make
further material gains. The Russians,
on their etended frOnts, have achieved
no enormous victories. Some signs of a

The Philadelphia came taken UP by
Representative Moore with the War De
Partment was that of a member of the
FItrst Cavalry. Pennsylvania Natinasi
Guard, which is composed' largely ot
business men or those engaged in pro
fessional life.
"The case presented by you is one of
a large number being continually re
eeve4 in whleh the discharge i urges
of members of the National Guard on
the ground that their business or pro
fessional interests demand their im
mediate personal attention," reads the
letter to Representative Moore. "The,
department is not unmindful of the
urgent necessity that prompts many of
these applications for discharge. anG
under ordinary conditions the reasons 00
which they are based would readily be
deemed sufcient to justify favorable
action. But unfortunately, the applica
tions are so numerous and are increasing
so rapidly that favorable consideratior.!
of all of them would disrupt many
militia units and greatly impair the
effciency of the service. No just or
equitable basis for discrimination has
been found upon a careful consideration
of the numerous applications thus '
received, and the Secretary of War has
ben constrained, in simple fairness to
all concerned. and in order to avoid the
discrimination that would be involved ir.
granting any individual application, to
adopt a strict rule that all of the ap
plicants must be treated alike, and that
no application of this nature shall be
favorably entertained."
