Col. O'Btp.nk must itlll remain a rcfugeo
martyr In the came of perional liberty and
the Oysterxnen'B $10,000. Judge Lattubnoe
yesterday refused to vacate the ordor of
arrest a'galustJthatoilbirolly feed Lntermo
dinry between the Oystermen and the Dock
Commission.
Mr. Ikoaixs has introduced In the Sen
ate a bill providing for World's Fair and
authorizing tho Government, through a
Board of Commissioners, to expend five
million dollars in securing a site and pro
viding buildings. It li evident thut Mr.
Ii.OAi.LS Is anxious to have the Fair held
to Washington City.
Despatches from Thomas BTZvrms, Ttte
World's commissioner, confirm the early
report that he was the first representative
of journalism to -welcome Btanlbt back
to civilization. Mr. Stevens has been
stricken down with fever, ahd a despatch
from Zanzibar announces that Emin Pabiia
has met with a probably fatal accident.
It Is proposed by the French Republic to
lend a friendly war-ship to Brazil to greet
the rising star of the Republic, and a Paris
newspaper objects on the ground that tho
presence of such a vessel at Rio would be
regarded as a menace to the Republic.
This idea is so novel and stupid that we
had supposed that it bad been copyrighted
by the Philadelphia Preu.
J at Gould imagines that as the Elevated
Railway King of this city he is rendering
terviqse which are not appreciated. He
wanff more privileges. At the same time
he prefers Chicatro or St. Louis to New
York as a location for the World's Fair.
By ull means let's turn In and help J at to
grow richer. As the city's benefactor he
hotilil not bo permitted to languish.
The President of the Union Dredging
Company yesterday bluntly traversed Capt.
Moll ah os'fl testimony regarding the alleged
dredging robberies and frauds. But may
not Mr. Loomis have forgotten all about it,
Just as he forgot all about the other busi
ness of the Dredging Company f Can any
one believe n statement from a man who
owns such a lamentably weak and treach
erous memory T
Senator Platt succeeds Ex -Senator
Cruets as manager ot the International
CoPyrlght Bill, which was introduced on
"Wednesday. It Is substantially the same
mcaiure that passed the Senate in the last
M Congress, and Hint would have passed tho
Vj House of Representatives if Mr. Patcok
a had not filibustered against the transaction
KM of any business on the dny on which It
III ught to have come up. All who are con
la cercd In the making of books, authors,
fl printers and publishers favor the bill, and
! it ought to pass before the. end of the
1 1 teuton.
II It is claimed by the Chicago EcraU that
VM New York City Is dally menaoed byayel-
) low.fever epidemic, despite the fact that
yellow fever baa not disturbed a city in
M this latitude for forty yean. It also dwells
'Pon our terriblt death-dealing electric
I HH
wlret m thragh there wort bo wires ta Chi
cago to kill people, and addst "It Is this
city, with, death-traps placed along the
streets, which Is asking the world to come
and visit it. It li the invitation ot tho
aplder to the fly." And yet two whiffs of
the Chicago River on a hot day carry mora
menace to human life than all the electrto
wires In New York City. By the way,
these wires will all be snugly interred
before 1802.
A terrible Bcandal has been brought upon
the Democratic administration of the late
House of Representatives by the theft of
$72,000 of Government funds by Craven
E. Silcott, cashier of Sergeant-at-Arms
Lrsdom. In nddldon to this sum stolen
from the treasury of the IIouBe Bilcott Is
understood to have appropriated $10,000 or
$20,000 of funds deposited with the Ber
eant-at-Arms by members. Mr. Lsrdom
engaged bi:.corr when he first took tho
office of Sergeant-at-Arms, some six years
ago. They were both from Adnms County,
Ohio. They had been reared together.
Siloott'b antecedents were excellent, but
the temptation of Washington proved too
much for him. It Is supposed that he has
taken refuge In Canada, together with the
woman who was mainly instrumental in
causing his downfall.
DO WE WAHT TEE PAIBt
There Is no use In asking Congress to
give the World's Fair to New York.
Congress will give New York nothing
which It can withhold.
It la Idle to demonstrate to Congress the
manifest propriety of locating the Fair
here and the absurd Impropriety of placing
it in any provincial town. Congress already
knows nil that can be said on that point
and is not In the least concerned to observe
the proprieties of the case.
If New York wants tho Fair New York
must pay for It. If nny appoal from New
York Is to bo effectlvo it must be sup
ported by a raonoy demonstration of Its
earnestness.
It is not arguments that are lacking In
New York's case, but money. It is not a
failure of intelligence that stands In our
way, but the miserable stinginess of the
rich men who hnve subscribed nothing and
the narrow stupidity of the Finance Com
mittee in fixing upon an inadequate sum
for the Guarantee Fund.
If we go before Congress with a miser
able $5,000,000 guarantee and a petition the
paltry sura will be mocked at as a proof of
the city's unworthlness and the petition
scorned as a beggar's pica.
If we are to succeed wo must go to Con
gress with ten or twenty millions in hand
and say that New York Is ready to pay the
expenses of a great World's Fair In cele
bration of the four hundredth anniversary
of the discovery of America, and ask Con
gress to give formal sanction to the enter
prise as National in character.
Are we ready to do that ? If so we must
put up tho money. If not wo shall save
ourselvet trouble and humiliation by with
drawing from the .contest.
HE, WTHDOira FLAH.
In his annual report Mr. Windou con
siders each of the proposed plans for solv
ing the sliver question and shows each to
be unwise and impracticable. He then
offers a plan of his own which Is more
unwise and more Impracticable than any
of them. Here Is his statement of the
plan:
luno Troumrrnotes AA-tnst depoilti of stlrtr bull.
Ion at th muliet price of ilWnr when d-pollcd,
pAjrible on denund lnauch quantities of a'Wer bull
ion will equml In Tain tt tu data of presentation
the number of dollars expreueA on tb (ae of the
noli-a at the market prlee of silver, or in col J. at the
option of the GoTernipent, or tn ellrer dollara, at the
option of the ho)4r, Iiepeal the eompalnrT fc
tmei of the present Coinage aot.
Under thU plan thero will be a totally
new kind of money put Into circulation a
form of Treasury notes of uncertain and
fluctuating value; legal tender for some
purposes but not for others, redeemable
but upon uncertain and variable terms,
and wholly unlimited In amount.
The owner of silver bullion li to be
allowed to compel the Government to buy
it at the market price, whether the Gov
ernment wants it or not. He can deposit
the metal and draw It out on a purely
gambling basis. If the price falls after
a deposit he can demand and get a larger
amount of silver than he deposited if the
price recovers he can deposit again at the
higher rate, making the difference while
the Government loses it.
The thing resembles betting at roulette
much more closely than it resembles
serious finance.
But if silver rises after a deposit the
thrifty depositor la under no obligation to
accept a less amount of It in exchange for
his certificates than ho put in. He has the
option either to pass the certificates upon
the Government at their face value In pay
ment of taxes, or to demand their redemp
tion in silver dollars of full legal-tender
character. In that event the Government
has the consolation of knowing that It can
pay in gold dollars instead, if it is so
minded.
The proposal is not worthy of serious
consideration. It is not finance at all j It
is politics. It does not solve the question
of the use of 'silver as money, or attempt
to solve it. It merely shirks it In the hope
of satisfying the silver-producers without
offending the mono-metalllsts. It will not
satisfy tho one or please the other.
GTJMTJLnTrVB ETTDENCIE.
Engineer Grutxrrx, ot the Dock Depart
ment, 'Was under examination yesterday.
Ha was very anxious, he said, to have all
his bank accounts examined and he seemed
a trifle too sensitive in resenting what ha
called charges of corruption made against
him. But Corporation Counsel Clatuc
very quietly remarked that ha had not yet
heard aiy one charge Mr. Chutm with
corruption, and the CommUilonera ot
Vittfi x&MtkJtW&to Vm1 iii'rtlia-i- i-JWil illri -f&tmfifo
Aceonnta tnformtd tho Chief Engineer that
the most Important part of the case had
not yet been touched and that he would be
wanted again.
It appeared from Mr. Qiunm-'a admis
sions that the Union Dredging Company
had done unauthorized work, and that to
cover it up the same work had been ad
vertised to be let, so that the Company
might get the Job which they had already
done. If any other Company had bid lower
than tho Union, Engineer Gmikne supposed
that he would have found somo other work
for It to do. Docs this seem an honest
method ot managing public business?
Mr. GnKSNB confirmed the stories of tho
loose and profligate manner In which the
supplies of the Department wero parcelled
out to " Invited " bidders. He " did not
believe" Capt. MoMaiioh'b stories about
the dredging frauds, anil he " did not be
llevo " tlint Gardihikr, the inspector of
dredged material, woe paid by tho Dredg
ing Company, although he was formerly in
the Company's employ. GArtmNirn, ho
admitted, was appointed at the instauce of
Ei-Spenkcr James W. IIustkd. Scratch a
suspected Dock employee and you find a
Republican Senator or Assemblyman un
derneath. Engineer GitxitNu'a evidence will confirm
the belief that the Dock Department is
putrid with mismanagement, irregularity,
Irresponsibility and corruption.
IB IT SAFE 0B0UDO7
In his desire to win the approval of all
the Republicans In the country Mr. Har
bison has made the mistake of taking the
Chicago platform seriously and Imagining
thai the Republican party in power is as
harmonious as the Republican party out
of power was in supportiug tho prepos
terous declarations of that document.
He says, for example, that In legislating
on the tariff " the protective principle
should be maintained and fairly applied to
the products of our farms as well as of our
shops." That means tho Increase asked
for by the wool men In the duty on wool.
But the constituencies of a good many
New England members of Congress want
free wool, and will certainly never content
to an increase In tho tax on that raw
material.
Again, the utterance means uncompro
mising hostility to any reduction of duties
on those necessaries of life which are the
"products of our shops." But a large
proportion of the Republicans of the
Northwest insist upon some relief in that
direction.
Their representatives were dragooned
with a single exception into opposition to
the Mills BUI; they were Impressed with
the necessity of party harmony and they
know that the bill could in no case pass
the Senate. But It will be quite another
thing to whip them into the support of
the policy ot taxing necessaries now that
their party is in power in both houses and
their votes are determinative of actual
legislation.
Apparently Mr. Harbisok has not been
as successful In his search for perfectly
sate ground as a President desirous of
" pleasing himself " with a second term
may be presumed tp wish.
EMIHBHTLY FIT,
The selection of C. C. Harrison for the
Russian mission ought to surprise nobody.
Mr. Harrisok Is not a statesman nor n
diplomatist. He is not a man known to
the public for ability of any kind. He has
bad no experience in duties of tho kind
which fit one for such a position. He is
wholly dcstltuto of the qualifications com
monly accounted essential in such cases.
But he Is a millionaire. He represents
the only class which this Administration
holds in high regard. He Is reputed to have
been a liberal subscriber to the corruption
fund collection with which Jons Wana
makxr bought his place In the Cabinet. Ho
Is a member ot the Sugar Trust, and as
such represents the plutocratic, monopo
listic constituency which put Mr. Harrison
into office and his party Into control of
Congress, with a hundred thousand major
ity ot votes against both.
He is one of tho beneficiaries of Protec
tion. He is a member of the class which
aspires to become dominant in this coun
try and is willing to purchase and pay for
political supremacy. He has all the quali
fications which are moit regarded at
present by the Republican party and its
President. His appointment is quite in
the natural order of things.
WBOrTOrHG THE PRESIDENT,
The St. Paul Planter Pre; the leading
Republican newspaper of tho Northwest,
says of the Blair education scheme that
" nobody bclioves in It but a fow senti
mentalists and surplus-killers. Tho bill for
Federal aid to education ought not to bo
able again to securo the votes of a dozen
members of cither house."
The Hartford Courant, a leading Repub
lican newspaper of New England, owned
and edited by a Republican Senator, com
menting upon President Harrison's ap
proval of the scheme tn his Message, says :
" It is to be regretted that the Message in
dorses the plan of the Blair Bill. This ac
tion is no doubt largely due to the Presi
dent's position when he was a Senator.
But It is none the less an error of judgment,
and it comes at a time when public opinion
has set decidedly more strongly against the
policy."
Now, all this Is cruelly unjust to Mr.
Harbison. In his bucolic Innocence the
President assumed that the platform
adopted by his party, on which ha was
-elected, meant something. He supposed
that it was a fairly candid expression of
tho party's opinions and intentions, and
with a docile dylra to recommend pre
cisely what ths party wanted him to
recommend ho paraphrased the platform
and called the result bis Message.
In the platform ho found a flat-footed
declaration that " tho State or nation, or
both eomUntd, should support free Institu
tions of learning sufficient to afford to
every child growing up in the land the
opportunity of a good common - school
education."
How could Mr. Harrison know that the
platform was tol de rol ? How could he
tell that his party was only shamming
when It put forward this declaration? Tho
man is distinctly lll-trcntcd.
HUE TOR BOLID RECTlTP.
What does thn Puu-Atnerlcnn Oongross
propose to do, anyhow ? It has enjoyed
a pleasant junketing tour through this
country, it intends to spend a fow joyous
dnys In New York this month and hopes to
add to Its happiness by an expedition Into
the inspiring limits of Brooklyn.
But as a deliberative body what has it
done to add to the neighborly feeling of the
American Republics 1 Surely weeks spent
In perfecting certain rule of tlebato nnd
quieting tho !mpctuo!ly of Senor Quin
tana, of the Argentine Republic, ore not
valuable additions to tho progressive ten
dencies of the New World.
The United Stntcs Government has spent
considerable money In making the Pan
American Congress a poFsiblllty. The time
has come for the people of this country,
who ultimately pay for this deliberative
luxury, to a6k for some useful outcome In
eiclmncc for the extiendlturo involved.
As the metropolis of the American Con
tinent New York will extend a warm
welcome to the Pan-Americans. But wo
reserve the right to ask for ome practical
result from an assemblage bearing In Its
very name the essence of New World
aspirations.
Let the Pan-American Congress abandon
its secrecy, its inclination to spilt parlia
mentary hairs and its aping of European
conferences. What we need In this case,
to take an illustration from Dickens, is not
a Circumlocution Office but a Gradgrlnd
school of facts.
00B DUTY TO RETUBIJCa
The Beaver Falls (Pa.) Trilmne needs
some elementary instruction. It sa s :
Tnr. Would communis to Mr. IU.irr,as an exam

Mr. Imi throuirh Milliliter SirEuts r-.cocrilr.e4 the
Itepnblto of Spain, In Februiry, 1873; but we are
euptiicd that any man Ttho thinks httuielf rouipeteut
to edit a groat metropolitan JiUr Tould expect or
aak Mr. Btatsx to repeat the hasty and foolish
farce tn which Mr. Fii-u, Mr. Bioklks and the
United States Conrreta were the lrsdlnc character
In tLe early months of 1873. Where la the rtepubllo
of Spain now f How lcrair did It endure f Hare we
any aasurance that the Republic of Until will last bo
lonj or la cny lots a myth
But what has that to do with the matter?
Do you Imagine that we guarantee the per
manence of every government we recog
nize? Can you not see that Spain's relapse
Into the barbarism of kingly rule In no way
lessened the value of our prompt expression
of our readiness to rejoice In her emanci
pation? The American people believe In
the eternal righteousness of de : ociatlc In
stitutions. It is the business of their Gov
ernment to reflect their convictions in their
dealings with other nations, All people
who try to free themselves from their mas
ters and to establish a Republic look to tho
Great Republic for the help of prompt and
cordial sympathy.
Brazil had a right to expect a glad wel
come at our hands, and if our Government
had been in the control of men Imbued
with tho American spirit her expectation
would not have been disappointed.
Three notorious dives in the city, all
having liquor licenses, wero vUlfcd by
World reporters a wei-k ago last Sunday
morning. The affidavits of the reporters
show that they were admitted to tiicse
resorts after 1 o'clock in the morning and
were drugged while there. The fact that
the dives were illegally open nt that hour
on Sunday, thus doubly violating the law,
was established. Some ot the bartenders
and proprietors havo slnco been arrested
by the police and held for trial.
The Excise Commissioners now have
an opportunity of proving their de
termination to enforce tho law by
revoking the licenses of these three
dives. They are all disreputable dens and
they ought to be closed. If their licenses
arc revoked they can and will be closed by
the police. President Meakin and Com
missioners Fiizpatrioe and Koon have
greatly Improved the excise administration
in the city. They should lose no, time In
doing a plain act of justice In this matter,
and in revoking the licenses which bavo
been forfeited by such gross violations of
the law.
In an Interview In an evening newspaper
Jay Gould refers to a decision by Judgo
BitrtwKit, the new Associate Justice of tho
Supreme Court, sustaining tho plea on
which be hopes to defeat In the courts the
action of Postmaster-General Wanamackb
In fixing the telegraphic rate for Govern
ment messages at one mill per word. Judgo
Brrwxr, In a recent railroad case In the
United States Circuit Court, decided against
the right of tho Government to exact ser
vice which entails loss on the corporation
rendering it. According to Jat Gould,
Judge Brewer held that such an exaction
was in effect confiscation and thus In
conflict with the Constitution. As Gould
intends to fight the Poatuiaitcr-Geucral's
order in the courts the advancement of
Judge Brewer to tho SuprcntV Court is of
interest to him at this time.
Senator Vanob's bill for the repeal of
the Olvll-Servica Law is not Democratic,
and its author is worthy of the se
verest condemnation. The law has oper
ated to the advantage of the Govern
ment and has developed to its present
excellence by a Democratic President.
There Is soma hope felt, mainly by Repub
licans, that under this Administration the
law may bo repealed. No ono could have
expected suoh a result while Mr. Curvx-
k
.. ' aiiBlMhiiaei nl isi Tfflli1 1 I it, JtsYsVsViiWi F.rl 'i
land was Proildent. Under the circum
stances a Dcmocratlo Beuator has no
excuse for attacking the system. More
over, the law Is a fixed fact and Its only
bad featuro Is its Improper enforcement.
HNnT Carlton, the slayer of Policeman
Brknnan, was executed In an expert man
ner yesterday. The affair was well man
aged, and all accounts agree that a human
life could not havo been moro neatly taken
by electricity. This permits tho gallows
to retire with credit, Inasmuch, If the
electrical capital puntrhment law stands,
Carlton's gallows will be the last ever
erected In the Tombs. After Carlton's
death yesterday, for the first time in twenty
years, there was not a slnglo condemned
murderer in tho Tombs.
Senator Blair' fertile mind is still active.
He now wants the District of Columbia
represented In Congress and in thoElcc.toral
College. He preontcd a bill yesterday
proposing an umendment to the Constitu
tion so that the District shall be entitled to
representation In Congress by one Senator
and one Representative, und that it shall
alto be entitled to as many electors for
President and Vice-President as it has
members In Congress.
There Is no greater anomaly In the public
service than the presonce of the Weather
Bureau In tho Army. Forecasting storms
and transmitting messages by flag and
torch are entirely dissimilar occupations.
The conjunction of the two has proved a
failure. As a rule enlisted men cannot be
come meteorologists, nnd the reward of a
second lieutenancy Is not adequate for one
who can and docs.

Another polite man among tbe lesding colored '$yt
citizens of this country is Blanche K. Bruce, ft
who is now spoken of aa the pofslble'ltecorderof r'9
Deeds for the District or Columbl. As Register Jg
of the Treasury Bruce was looked upon as ths p
moet politu man in tho Dorartment, and he IK
made lniurclf popular even with some of the tm
aristocratic, blue-blooded Southern ladle who flit
held office ouder him. In the Senate be took his fijll
stand with such dignity that evaii the Southern '"El
members resptctod him. He la not ashamed of sjjlw
hla boyhood, and hi present position recalls ji
the story of his fust interview with Senator I jpl
Bocle. or MUinnri, during hi term In the W,i
United States Senate. Kenitnr Bogle was at lift

would see to it at once, and Bogie said, on leav. li

" But. ''iiaid Senator Bruce, "Senator Bods. w

" Indeed," replied Senator Bogie, almost-. Jl'
hotly, "are yon not mistaken? Vhon, pray, If.

"It was, SeuaUr," responded Bruce. When ffil

Senator Bruce has bean lecturing during the !

Senator Bruce live in the fashionable north- Si

near that of Mr. Gen. Hancock, but whether '' .
he owns It or not I cannot say. The colored ', JK
citizens are sandwiched in between the white
