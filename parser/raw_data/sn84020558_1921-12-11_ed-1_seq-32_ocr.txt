parties are being arranged -for in
the near future.
Among last Sunday's dinner part
ies were one of six that included
Mrs. S. T. Butler, Miss Myrtle But
ler, Miss Verdie Butler, Mr. and Mrs.
C. E. Howard and T. A. Kiordan. A
second party of six included Mr. and
Mrs. W. N. Holmes of Nashville.
Tenn..' Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Lutgerding
and Mr. and Mrs. Julian Holmes.
A party of five was made up by
Dr. Solis Cohen, Dr. D. L. Leknaitz,
Sam Ballsum. Edward Rothman and
Herman Lewkowitz.
Also on Sunday E. I Williams of
New York was the guest at dinner
of Robt. C. Metzler. Guy P. Nevitt
and A. B. Hinkle, Jr., of Phoenix.
Mrs. Alexander B. Barrett of Hol
lywood, on Thursday entertained at
luncheon her cousins, Miss Fanny
Peck and Miss Grace Peck of Phoe
nix. Miss Nellie Andrew, VTm. A. Mc
Callum and Frank Andrew of Cin
cinnati, and Neil P. McCallum of
Phoenix were visitors at the San
Marcos on Wednesday.
Senator H. B. Wilkinson and U
J. Taylor were Phoenix visitors on
Friday.
Joe Daniels and Orris Holdren re
turned from their week's trip to the
Mogollon Rim on Wednesday night.
They went by motor to Little Green
Valley, 20 miles east of Payson, and
from there by horseback to Babe
Haught's ranch, about 33 miles. From
the ranch they made various scout
ing and hunting trips through which,
Mr. Daniels states, is one of the
prettiest and most scenic pieces of
country he ever visited.
They report that they were in
high wind and snow most of the time
they were near the Rim. They found
lots of feed everywhere, and say that
the cattle are In fine condition. The
road from Payson back to the Roose
velt dam was good, but slippery from
recent wet weather. This is ta
country that Zane Grey likes so well
to hunt in and write about. Mr.
Daniels says he plans to make hunt
ing trips up there a confirmed fall
habit.
Much Interest Is being taken by
the San Marcos people in Chandler's
coming "Progress Carnival" which is
to be held in Chandler December 28
and 29. Miss Belva Winn, of the
office force, has been one of the can
didates nominated for carnival queen,
.who is to be chosen by ballot. The
hotel folks are backing Miss Winn
a winner.
Horseback riding is becoming very
popular among the guests, and Guide
Bill Huggett's squadron of cavalry
is growing daily.
Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Sartelle of St.
Louis were guests of their brother
and sister, Mr. and Mrs. Will H.
Robinson, on Friday and Saturday.
Mr. and Mrs. Sartelle, who knew the
Chandler country in pioneer days
even before the Chandler Ranch was
started, found it hard to believe that
the San Marcos wasn't some en
chanted sort of a creation evolved by
genii, so great has been the metam
orphosis from the desert over which
they had driven and hunted 30 years
ago.
Recent arrivals at the San Marcos
include: Frank L. Dunn and family
of Boston, Mr. and Mrs. John W.
Patterson, Kearney, Neb.; Geo. Arch
er. Jr., New York City: Mrs. H. Har
rison and Miss Mary Bergman, Los
Angeles; J. F. McGrath, Chicago;
Jack Brace and Frank Fee. Phoenix;
Mr. and Mrs. S. Ai Marks, San Fran
cisco; Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Peck,
Tempe; J. D. Pouleson and R. I
Holmquist, Los Angeles.

THE FRATERNAL BROTHERHOOD
December promises to be the Jolll
est month of the year for Phoenix
Lodge No. 43. The barn dance given
cn the first meeting night of the
month was a success in every partic
ular. The musicians caught the spirit
of the fun and It seemed to spread to
the entire gathering, for every one
threw aside formalities and just had
good time. The old-time fiddler
brought out the old English and Vir
ginia reels and many specialties in
this line were indulged In by the
dancers. The committee, Mrs. Fred
Vess, Mrs. Henry Chambers, Mrs
Harry Diehl. Mrs. J. C. Reynolds and
Mrs. J. N. Houser, managed so that
every part of the evening's entertain
ment was carried out consistently and
everyone present was glad that they
came.
On the second meeting of the month
occurred the election of officers and
it went with a snap and pep. The
officers were selected for their efi
ciency and experience and the mem
bers look forward to a term of prom
ise and achievement.
The night of December 17 has been
set aside for the annual roll-call ban
quet as this is the occasion for Su
preme President J. A. Batchelor's
isit to the lodge. There will be the
class initiation, a short program, the
banquet, followed by dancing and
cards.
Supreme Trustee Barnett E. Marks
will in his snappy manner act as
toastmaster: State Manager K. T.
Mabon will occupy the position he
likes best, that of seeing that every
one is recognized and made to loci
that they are one of the happy as
sembly: Brother R. H. Bloem will
have charge of the program, which
he says will be composced exclu
sively of lodge talent, and the ban
quet Is put in the hands of a com
mittee composed of Mrs. Mel vine a.
Morse, Mrs. Irene Johns, Mrs. Lulu
Davis. Mrs. Edward Trincano, Mrs.
Edward Nisbet and Mrs. Claud Scrtv
ner. These members have been on
so many committees and their pas
record for service Is so well estao
lushed that the lodge realizes that
there is a treat out of the ordinary
in store for them.
The drill team win have charge of
decorating the lodge room, and the
Juvenile Liberty Lodge No. 12 will
decorate the banquet hall, so the sur
rounding atmosphere will be in keep
ing with the festivities, and every
member is asked to come in a holiday
mood and aid in making this one of
the good times peculiar to this soci
ety. The entire evening, will be open
to members only.

Bending Every Effort To Secure
Building Of San Carlos Project
FLORENCE. Aria, Dec . The,
San Carlos executive committee Is
determined to leave no stone un
turned to secure the building of the
San Carlos project, and -to that end
is bending every effort to secure
recognition of our project outside the
state of Arizona, The attention of
the people is called to the fact that
this project is for the betterment of
the entire state of Arizona, of all
business and commercial Interests,
and all people "who are compelled to
depend upon work of this character
for a living, and that any partisan or
political feelings or tendencies which
would not be harmonious to a suc
cessful determination of this matter
should be cast aside and all work
for the welfare of our project": and
to this end the committee is conduct
ing its campaign to secure outside
assistance irrespective of political
representation.
It is evident from President Hard
ing's message to congress that he is
In hearty accord with any movement
that has for its object the reclama
tion of the arid lands of the west.
and that it is his desire that congress
by appropriation legislation should
Provide the reclamation with funds
with which to carry on this class of
work.
Attorney Carl R. Tisor, who for the
past month has had active charge of
the publicity campaign of the execu
tive committee. Is in receipt of letters
from Frank P. IJtchert, executive
secretary of the Republican national
committee, and Senator James E.
Watson. Republican senator of In
diana, both of whom are friends of
many years standing, and botn oi
whom were urged to support either
the Ashurst bill or any general ap
nropriation bill for the reclamation
service. Irrespective of pontics.
Mr. Litchert letter is as follows
kMr. Carl R. Tisor. Florence, Ariz.:
"Dear Carl Your letter of Novem
ber 1 is at hand, and I note what
you say about the reclamation service
In your state. I shall be glad to do
anything I can to help push tnis mat
ter along, and will look Into it to the
best of my ability.
"With best wishes. I am,
"Sincerely yours,
"FRANK P. LITCHERT."
Senator Watson's letter is as fol
lows:
"Mr. Carl R. Tisor, Florence, Ariz.:
'Friend Carl I have your letter.
Replying, permit me to say that I am
a thorough believer In irrigation;
bave been over most of the big 'Irri
gation districts in the country and
am profoundly convinced that land
and water should be brought together
in a government scheme whenever
and wherever possible. ,
"Ashurst and I are on friendly
terms and Cameron and I are ex
ceedingly close and I shall be very
glad to take this matter up with
either of them and discuss it when
ever either one of them sees fit to
talk to me about it. Cameron will
doubtless discuss the matter w ith me
for he talkawith me very much about
Arizona matters in general, I shall
be very glad to render any service I
can. but I must first look into the
scheme before I can determine its
merits.
"Wishing you well, I am,
"Sincerely yours,
"JAMES E. WATSON j
Everyone Interested is urged to
take this matter up with congress
ional representatives outside of Ari
zona, with a view to securing a na
tion-wide interest in these projects,
and particularly the San Carlos
The needs and requirements of the
entire country are such that there is
a general trend toward co-operation
cf all interests, business, commercial
and political, to work a readjustment
of our entire country, and we are sat

measure brins about the desired results.
Our Arizona congressional delega

this state to urge upon them the
necessity of persistent efforts along
oil lines, and especially that of en
listing the support of congressmen
from the east.
