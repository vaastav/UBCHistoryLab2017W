can bear testimony that they were
above the average Circuses swinging
round here. With no big preten

ised and acquitted themselves hand
somely in their several roles, and
gave pretty general satisfaction to t

-THE weather has at last veered a
to its good intents, and at last we C
have been mildly chilled into Winter
practical facts. The first white frost
of the season, accompanied with the
first freeze, paid us its tardy visit on
the 7th inst., and five or six of the a
same sort have visited us since with
punctuality and weather guage regu- I
larity. In consequence of all this we f
have been blessed and highly favored '
with lovely weather, and as fair as
a maiden of sweet sixteen. Every
body and everything needed it, and
we can only wish it may continue the d
whole of this December, to make
amends of horrid past November. c

session all the week, and it is said
will have business till Cbrtstmas.- (
The Grand Jury were on duty all the a

not adjourned; rumor has it that
they have rigidly performed their
duties, and it remains to be recorded
with what good effect. a

CONGRESSR0
Much of our available space, this
week is taken up, and justly so, with an
the new Congress, its Speaker, the wE
President's Message and other pro- pa
ceedings of Congress. All these are rij
of the more importance at the pres- at
ent juncture of our national affairs, I&
because for the first time in fifteen an
years the Democratic party has pu
obtained control of the popular, th
guiding branch of the National Legis- th
lature. It has set its majority there ev
at such a juncture that its every act ar
must tell with irretrievable force up- ot
on the fortunes, not of the party on- da
ly, but of the whole country. na
At such a time the- Democratic nc
majority in the house of Represen- id
tatives has a great duty, and the first ho
portion of that duty has been well
and ably performed in the selection mi
and election of the Hon. Michael C. fai
Kerr, of Indiana, as its Speaker, and re
other equally competent and faithfnl wi
Dcmocrats for Clerk, Sergeant-at- us
Arms, and all the other offices in its fo
gift. The Speakership of the House on
is a post now, not much less worth wi
the careful choice made by the Dem- at
ocrats than the next President of the hi
United States. The Speaker exer in
cises a power which is not fully un- oi
derstood except by the most experi- lo
enced members of Congress, for the w
very moment he has assumed his w
i chair he becomes the very prophet es
of legislation. He has the power to oer
-appoint the members of every Com-. at
mittee of the House, and no man, ex
cept by argument or persuasion or aT
lower means can gainsay him. No of
man or conclave has any, except the st
-moral, right to approach him. He is tl
an autocrat. His will is the law and ni
the fact. Upon his appointment of m
the members of committees depends A
even more than upon all; except ex- tip
traordinary deliberations and decis- sc
ions in the House, the course of Con- to
gressional legislation on every sub- cl
ject. Committee rule becomes in the pi
National and State legislatures more at
absolute as years increase. What at
has been once examined and decided to
upon in a committee-room is usually to
accepted and passed in the open or
chamber. bl
r Hence then the great and striking gi
advantages we start out with-a T
Democratic Speaker, a Democratic se
House of Representatives, the purse gi
and sword of the nation. What bet- or
ter, grander era ahead can we antici- siu
pate and cherish for our glorious old pr
party, and what better prestige of th
victory in 1876? Surely the unity, lei
harmony and tenets gracefully han- ol0
died by the gifted Lamar, of Missis- ei
sippi, the caucus president, and Ran- us
dalI, of Pennsylvania, as he falls in nc
Democratic line, can but nerve us to br
continued-efforts strengthen our par- fa
ty and effectually crush out the ills pr
of Grant radicalism. th

OUR PUBLIC SCH0OOLS.
We have easily rested on our oars
and our meek patience for two long loi
weeks, and yet the questions of im- pe
portance and our rested minority Cc
rights, which we have been seeking ev
at the merciless hands of the School wi
Board of Rapides, have remained un- ou
answered and to all intents and and to
purposes we have been snubbed, and it
the powers that be seem bound to it
their idols and more determined than qt
ever to cheat us of these rights. We
are almost forced to admit that no
other School Board in the State would m
dare act with such shameless obsti- la
nacy and injustice, and we may add of
no other people, but those of Rap- st
ides could be made to stand it, and in
have it so well rubbed in. wi
SViewing the question as one of the m
most vital importance we have thus n(
far shaped it as a Parochial one, and IxP
really had hopes the interested ones to
would come to our rescue and back ed
us up a little while we were fighting in
for their rights and the cherished te
ones of their children. But it seems di
we have been counting on weak hosts th
and that all aid and backbone oil of
I have abandoned us, and left us alone vI
in our glory, fighting at tremendous W
odds the perfumed chambers of Kel- se
logg's power in our Parish. But as gi
we are composed of some stern stuff, ar
we cannot abandon our fight thus A
early in the action, and turn to oth- pi
ers nearer at home to listen to us, g<
Sand force that good fight with ns. de
We now propose to choose Alex- A
-andria, our Town, as the future field na
of operations, and here throw out our o01
skirmish line, believing we can force sat
the enemy from his position, and fi- ti
I nally regain our Parochial reinforce it
ments. Within the limits of the bi
Alexandria Ward, under the direc- tt
tion of that School Board which has m
so long maltreated us, there are fully se
twice the number of schoolable white Cor
children than colored ones; the white qi
parents of those very white children di
are taxed and pay nineteen dollars w
and seventy-five cents out of every Ip
ttwenty dollars assessed and collect- re
ted, and how stands the school rec- ia
ord as arranged by the Board? We pi
blush as we are forced once more to gi
gire it to the public in these columns. sc
There are in Alexandria two colored th
schools, one for boys, and one for et
girls, whilst our white children have di
only one school in an old fly-specked se
shanty, with a teacher not of their tli
parents choice, but an importation of n:
the School Board, and who has a se- nT
lect night negro school in that same
old shanty, and not, mind you, in qi
either-of the other fine school houses tii
used for the little darkies. We mean ar
no insult to this teacher personally wi
but merely take him along with the of
false position we are placed in at the to
present juncture, and must grope all ar
the shades in to make the real pic- ty
lure more sad and glaripgly unjust pr
to us. And right here we may as lP
well have another little inj ustice and ar
meanness of the Board slipped in 14
they have had a new lot of benches 1U
made, painted and drayed to the ne- 1E
, gro school palace, and the old ones th
therein they graciously gave for the ee
use of the little white ones of the sr
shanty, but they had to pack them to hb
that school shanty, for no drxyage in
can be allowed them, as all that sort Pt
ofcontingent expenses are only al- uj
lowed to the darkies! to
Now, good people of Alexandria, tr
you parents who have schoolable pi
children and pay the school taxes to Si
which we allude, come to the frqcut w
and make yourselves heard, and give pi
the Democrat, your friend, your or- al
gan, a little moral help right here, ti
and we honestly believe we can make vI
an impression on the Board and force W
them to do the right and fair thing: tr
give us our minority rights, where we at
should really have the majority ones. s
Come to our rescue, view the situa-.eC
tion in its proper light and then act. ti
We believe we have at last struck the pl
right vein and that our Town par- pl
ents will take up the matter at once a,
and force practical justice from our
hard-headed and obstinate Board.- ei
r Who will be the first to move and ri
move in earnest in this matter? i;

THE MESSAGE. pi
G
The President's Message is the je
longest ever written by Grant, and gi
perhaps the longest ever delivered to tit
Congress. We have not space for di
even one-fourth of it as delivered, and
with the best inclination to give It to di
our readers, they must rest satisfied Si
to get it in sectional doses, as we cull cia
it from the whole document, and give hi
it to them on the most important ai
questions now at issue in the Union: m
PUBLIC EDUCATION. i
We are a Republic whereof one pi
man is as good as another before the RI
law. Under such a government, it is
of the greatest importance that all
should be possessed of education and I
intelligence enough to cast a vote ci
with a right understanding of its j
meaning. A large association of Ig- 11
norant cannot for any considerable el
period oppose a successful resistance $:
to tyranny and oppression from the li
educated few but will Inevitably sink c
into acquiescence to the will of in- y,
telligence, whether directed by the t
demagogue or priestcraft. Hence ci
the education of the masses becomes 6
of the first necessity for the preser- p
vation of our institutions; they are ti
worth preserving because they have tl
secured the greatest good to the u
greatest portion of the population of is
any form of government yet devised. n
All other forms of government ap- li
proach it just in proportion to the ,
general diffusion of education and in- ti
dependence of thought and action.- ti
As the primary step, therefore, to our it
advancement in all that has marked r
our progress in the past centur3-, I
suggest for year earnest considers
tion and most earnestly recommend u
it that a Constitutional Amendment q
be submitted to the ILegislatures of b
the several States for ratification, ti
making it the duty of each of the 0o
several States to establish and forev- ls
or maintain, free public schools, ade- s9
quate to the education of all the chil- o
dren in the rudimentary branches
within their respective limits, irres- ci
pective of sex, color, birth-place or e
religion, according the teaching in m
said schools of religious, atheistic or p,
pagan tenets, and prohibiting the p
granting of any school funds, or g
school taxes, or any part thereof, ei
ther by legislative, municipal or oth- ce
er authority for the benefit or in aid w
directly or indirectly of any religious el
sect or denomination, or in aid or for
the benefit of any other object of any, b
nature or kind whatever. d
THE TAXATION OF CHURCH PROPERTY. a
In connection with this important gc
question I would also call your atten- sl
tion to the importance of correcting ,
an evil that if allowed to continue n
will probably lead to great trouble in tl
our land before the Nineteenth Cen- I
tury. It is the accumulation of-vast
amounts of untaxed Church proper
ty. In 1850, I believe, the Church''
property of the United States which g
paid no tax, municipal or State, oC
amounted to about $83,000,000. In lti
1860 the amount had doubled. In
1875 it is about $1,000,000,000. By I
1900 without check it is safe to say ~
this property will reach a sum ex- $1
ceeding $3,000,000,000. So wast a TI
sum receiving all the protection and Li
benefits of government without bear
ing its portion of the burdens and ex- c
penses of the same will not be looked
upon acquiescently by those who have w
to pay the taxes. In a growing coun- p
try where real estate enhances so ra- le
pidly with time as in the United oi
States, there is scarcely a limit to the
wealth that may be acquired by cor- T
porations, religious or otherwise, if a
allowed to retain real estate without
taxation. The contemplation of so $1
vast a property as here alluded to k
without taxation may lead to seques- a
tration without constitational an
thority and through blood. I would
suggest the taxation of all property o
equally, whether cburch or corpora- o
tion, excepting only the last resting n
place of the dead, and possibly with a
proper restrictions, church edifices.
RELATIONS WITH FoREIGn# POWERS. J
Our relations with most of the for- q
eign powers continue on a satisfacto- 4
I ry and friendly footing. Increased a
intercourse, the extension of com- c
merce and the cultivation of mutual i
interests have steadily improved our I
relations with the large majority of
the powers of the world, tendering x
practicable the peaceful solution of1
questions which, from time to time, g
necessarily arise, leaving fhw which
demand extended or particular no
tice. Thr correspondence of the De
r partment of State with our diploma
r tic representatives abroad is trans
- mitted herewith.
FOR NELLIE'S BEIENFIT.
I also invite your attention to the 1
necessity of regulating by law the I
status of American women who may
d marry foreigners and of defining I
more fully that children born in al
foreign country of American parents 1
who may reside abroad, and also of
some further provision regulating or
giving legal effect to marriages of
n American citizens contracted in for
fl eign countries.
n The correspondence submitted here
ro with sabws a few of the constantly
occuring questions on these points
presented to the consideration of the gi
Government. These are few suab- or
jects to engage the attention of Con- de
I gress on which more delicate rela- ai
tions or more inportat'interests are It
*dependant. co

SPECIE RESUMPTION. ti
I mean specie resumption. Too i
i much stress cannot be laid upon this in
t question, and I hope Congress may bi
f be induced, at the earliest day praE- It
ticable, to insure the consammation t
3 of the act of the last Congress at its Ti
- last session to bring about specie re- uI
-sumption on and after the first day ti
-of January 1879. m
SIt would be a great blessing if this d
could be consummated even at an to
r earlier day. Nothing seems to be Ie
amore certain than a full, healthy ex- Ti
r periment. Reaction cannot take al
3 place in favor of the industries and *
r financial welfare of the country until io
we return to a measure of values re- a
Scognised throughout the civilized s
world. While we se a currency not di
Sequivalent to this standard - the at
r world recognized standard-specie ti
' becomes a commodity like the pro
ducts of the soil, the surplus seeking w
Sa market wherever there is a demand P
for it. Under our present system we a
Sshould want none, nor would we have fe

must be paid in coin, and because of fo

I am not prepared to sy that I can
suggest the bestlegslaation to secure
the end most heartily recommended.
It will be a source of great gratiiea
I tion to me to beable to approve any
measure of Congress looking effect
ively toward securing resnmption.
UWLIMITED IRVLATIOW,
would probably bring about spoole lie
- payments more speedily than any ct
- legislation looking to the redemption
of legal tendera in coin; But it
" would be at the expense of honor.
The legal tenders would have no val
ne beyond settling present liabititles
or properly speaking repadiating
) them. They would buy nothing af
" ter debts were all settled There are tt
a few -measures which seem to me p
important in this connection and flg
which I commend to yoar earnest g,
F'consideration-a tepeal of so much ni
of the legal tender act as makes these tr
S notes receivable for debts contracted ii
after a date to be fixed in the act it- uD
' self, say not later than the 1st day of j
IlJanuary,1877. We should then have ,
quotations at real values, not fleti- h
' tious ones. Gold would no longer be p
at a premium, but currency at a di. p
' count. A healthy reaction would set o
'1 in at once, and with it a desire to d
ir make the currency equal to wtst it b
f purports to hbe .The merchants, b
g manufacturers, and tradesmen ofev cv
ery calling could do business on a
e, fair margin of proit. The money to
h be receired having an unvarying val
Sne, laborers and al classes who work
e- for etipulaled pay or salary would re
"' eeve more for their Income, because ~
- extra profts would no longer be t
charged by the capitalist to compen
sate for the risks ofa downward ec- -
ic tnation in the value of the corrency.
re Second, That the Secretary of the
Iy Treasury be authorized to redeem,1
Ig say not to exceed $20,000,000 month
a ly of legal tender notes by issaing in
is their stead a long bond, bearing in.
of terest at the rate of 8 65-100 per
or cent per annum, of denominations
of ranging from $50 to $1000 each.
r- This would in time reduce the legal
tender notesto a volume that could
ire be kept afloat without demanding re
.ly demption in large sums suddenly. I
its Third, That additional power be
given to the Secretary of the Treas- 0
ury to accumulate gold for final re
demption, either by increasing reve- ri
aue, curtailing expenses or both.
It is preferable to do both-and I re
commend that reduction of expendi
tures be made wherever it can be
done without impairing Government
obligations or crippling the due ete
cution thereof. One measure for In C
creasing the revenue, and the only s,
one I think of is the restoration of y,
the duty on tea and coffee. These r
duties would add probably $18,000,- it
000 to the present amount received M
from imports and would in no way T
increase the prices paid for these ar- le
ticles by the consunlers. These ar- ed
ticles are the products of countries p
collecting revenue from exports and ti
as we-the largest consumers-re- ri
duce the duties they proportionally ce
increase them. o0
THE CENTENNIAL. al
The board heretofore appointed to I
take charge of the articles and mate- it
rials pertaining to the war, the navy, A
the treasury, the interior and the
post once department, and the de- ti
partmeat ofagrlculture, the Smith- A
sonian Institution, and the commis- w
sion of food Ashes to be contributed 5s
under the legislation of last session g
to the international exhibition, to be si
held at Philadelphia during the Ceti- oi
tennial year 1876, has been diligent si
in the discharge of the duties which w
have devolved upon it and the prepa- gi
tions so far mhade with the means at al
command, give assurance that the ti
governmental contribution will be si
made one of the marked eharacteris- ol
ties of the exhibition. The board tl
has observed commendable economy w
in the matter of the erection of a c1
blilding for the governmental exhib
It, the expense of which it is estima- C
ted will not exceed say $90,000.- al
This amount has been withdrawn ci
under the law from the appropria V
tions of five of the principal depart-. tl
menats, which leaves some of those ti
departments without sufficient means b
to render their respective practical ei
exhibits complete and satisfactory. tt
The exhibition being an Internation- tt
al one, and the Government being a cI
voluntary contributor, It is my opin. r
lon that its contribution should be of al
a character, in quality and extent, to 5s
sustain the dignity and credit of so it
distinguished a contributor. The C
advantages to the country of a credi- -
table display are, in an international al
point of view, of the first importance, w
while an indifferent or increditable gi
participation by the Goiernment li
would be humiliating to the patriotic ti
feelings of our people themselves. I Ini
commend the estimnates of the Board hi
for the necessary additional approplri- c.
ations to the favornble consideration- in
of Congress. The piowers of Europe, an
almost without exception, many of ti
the South American States, and even G
the more distant Eastern powers have ti,
inanifested thekr friendly sentiments lhe
toward the United States and the in- 2'
terest of the world in our progress by ti
taking steps to join with us in cole- si
brating the Centennial of the nation,
and I strongly recommend that ii
more national importance be given to to
this exhibition by such legislatiop l
and by such appropriation ss will in- fe
sure its success. Its value in brIng- I
ing to our shores innumerable useful et
works of art and skill, the comming- '
ang of the citizens of. foreign coine- pc
tries and our own. and the inter-.
change of ideas and manafactures
will far exceed any pecuniary outlay 7r
we may make. V

--STPhHN A. DOUGLAS at one time t
'thought himself near enough to the f
Presidency to promise his friends of-
cfles. A correspondentof the Chica
go Times gives an account of a din
ner where there was a generois dis. n
tributina of this kind. When the
I list had been nearly exhausted Mr.
Douglas noticed that one of the A
f guest., Beverly- Tucker by name, had p
Snoot asked for in odice. Turning to'1
him he requested him to state what
8 position he desired. The man re
plied he had no wish for offce, but I
only a request to make, which he e
D disclosed as follows: "It is simple, I
have a Christian name. My mother C
" baptised me Beverly. Some call me
'Bev.' Now, when you are elected S
F ?realdent, I want you upon every c -
casion when we meet in publiotosay, i
I "Hallos, Be, is that you? Bow are
k yeo, old fellow?" I want you to slap t
me on the shoulder, -and talk with me a
' confidentially. If yao will always a
" treat me like that when we meet, I 1
' will ask no more."

A purple soutane, with a trailingf

scarlet silk gash, weighed down with
I grert tassels of gold. Above was aI
surplice of soft lace, and a mantilla
of purple velvet, lined with searlet`
silk. Around His Eminence's neck
was a golden cross, On his erect,
Sgraylsh head were the berretta and a
skull-cap-both scarlet. His signet,
the Papal arms graven on a large
sapphire, was on his left hand: Ae.
olytes and priests filed in state along
I the edge of the elevated platform, on"
which the altors rest, and entered the.
chancel.
SAll knelt for a moment. Tbe the "
Cardinal ascended a throne of gilded
and fretted walant, with panels of'

themselves attractively, and the cele -

Semnise mass, the chair supportaing
them. At the end of the confession -
-the Cardinal fed the live coals in the
censer with incense, and white smaoke
wreathed his person, the throne, anti
all near it. 'Then the priests incen*
