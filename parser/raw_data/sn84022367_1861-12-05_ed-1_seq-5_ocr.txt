Wherefore thev went they !o not tell, but
there-are manv obvious reasons tor their
preferring a more southern position. The
state cf popular fVling in Virginia was
growinr unpleasant ; their acs were re
ceiving verv free and bitter cridci.-nis, and
the jealosy between the Virginia V. V.
Vs. and the cottonocracy was beginning
to stick out in a verv uncomfortable
Resides there were dark shadow s of com
ing events tailing upon Richmond, such as
a possible defeat at Manama, and a prob
able isolation of Virginia from th South
bv the advarsee of the government form's
into Tennessee. Moreover Jeff' Davis,
notwithstanding the inflated self-siifncieney
and brag of his message to the confederate
Congress, sees that the lines of the govern
ment are closing in upon hint on all sides,
and he very wisely prefers to be it; ad
vance of our gr- i; western expedition in
the movement down ti . Mississippi. It
m.,v be siiteh 'iledictui that Nashville
wili not continue the r-i-l capital as 1-mg
as Richmond has. and thai the progress of
the bub ot the revolution towards the C.-ulf
is henceforth V be rapid. Conlederate
paper is already at a discount of thirty
per cent, and t-ir conspirators are talking
about a law to compel the southern people
to take their worthless paper at. par. The
failure of their great cor ton and pro luce
scheme .t revenue is absolute and u I. -dis
guised, and the only thing it ha accom
plished is the disaffection of the planters,
who see how fal.se and heartless an- the
leaders who haw beguiled them to t'.ieir
ruin. The attempt of the leaders ;; stir
up popular violence against the commer
cial classes, as if they were responsible for
the nrevalent distress, is another sign of
the growing disorder and disaffection,
which are sure precursors ot failure and
ruin to the men wno have involved their
section in this ruin, to promote their own
neisonid amhitions. The Union men of
the South rejoice L- the privations inci
dent to the blockade, and comfort them
selves by the consideration that the seces
sionists are the greatest sufferers. The
tightness of the blockade and the constant
gathering of the armies of the Union, the
now admitted courage of the northern
troops, the failure of England and France
to recognize the supremacy of cotton, the
arrest of the rebel ministers to Europe, the
money resources ot tne federal govern
ment, which seem inexhaustible, are hav
ing their eflect even upon ths most reck
less of the conspirators. Nothing but tne
prestige ot a few successes, immensely
magnilifcd by a systematic lying, haa kept
tht n-bels in heart up to this time. And
one or two great federal victories in the
field only are necessary to knock the props
from the confederate experiment, and
!e-vo it :.! fall into a sLapelesSu mass ot nt-
ins. The judgemeut of the great and
wicked abortion "lingereth not, and its
damnation slumhereth not."
