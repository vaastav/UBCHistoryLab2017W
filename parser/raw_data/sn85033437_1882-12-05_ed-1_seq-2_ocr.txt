TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1882.
From The Republican of December 5th.
A VALEDICTORY SALUTATORY.
A parting that ends with a meeting,
A meeting that ends with a wedding,
A wedding that ends with a greeting,
A trreetinsr that ends with ink-shed
ding.
This will be the last issue of The
Republican.
We wiite these words with some
regret.
The Republican was foundfd
under circumstances well known.
Wht of good it has accomplished
we look on with pride; what of evil
it has done we contemplate with
regret.
The career of no man is one of
uninixrd good. The best of men
coiiimit errors by the multitude.
"There is none that doeth good, no,
not one.? The very sun, that em
blem of brightness, hath its spots.
We, therefore, are not so pre
sumptious as to imagine that The
Republican ha committed no
errors. Looking backward over its
pathway, we ste many things we
would have otherwise. We have
said things we ought not to have
- said, and have left unsaid things we
ought to have said.
But with all our errors, we have
ever endeavored to prefer princi
ples to parties and parties to per
sons. In the discussion of princi
pies we have striven to use the
noblest weapons and to convince
and win rather than insult and
destroy. In the discussion of par
ties we have clung to Republican
iem as Ruth to Naomi, saying ever,
F.n treat mfi not to leave thee, or
to return from following after thee:
for whither thou goest, I will go;
A.nd where thou lodzest. I will
lodge: thy people shall be my peo
ple, and thy God my God: where
thou diest, will I die, and there will
I be buried!"
In the discussions of persons we
have hit aDd been hit; we have
struck with feeble arm and yet with
till our power ; we have been battered
by heavy artillery but have yet not
been destroytd. We have faced
every foeman and measured swords
-with every assailant; not witnout
fear, but without cowardice; not
without occasional defeats, but yet,
we hope, without ever - being-dis
(traced. "
For those who fought n as the
representative of principles we have
th highest respeot; for those who
fougUt "ua for less worthy reasons
we have the charity of sileace, and
ask the same in return, not doubt
ing that there is blame at our own
door, also.
To those noble men, and their
names are many, who stood by us
to the end, we have a heart full of
the sweetest gratitude and a hand
with a pressure as soft a woman's
love.
If there be any who have fallen
out with us by the way, we urgo
them to try us once more, in our
new pathway; and they may find
we have learned to profit by exper
ience, and have grown wiser and
better as we have grown older.
Hereafter, The Republican and
the Whig & Chronicle will be
consolidated and published as one
paper, under the name of the Ke
publican' Chbonicle.
The two papers have ceased to
fight each other and have been
united in political wedlock. We
invite the friends of both to the
wedding feast. No man need put
any oil in his lamp for we have a
lamp that will shine for all pro
vided our friends will supply the
oil.
No cards were issued, as the high
contracting parties desired the cer
emony to be as private aa possible.
But wedding presents from the
friend3 of both parties, in the shape
of subscriptions and advertise
ments, will be entirely in order,
and, we hope, entirely fashionable.
The Republican takes the sur
name of the Chronicle, and may,
therefore, be considered the bride ;
but nevertheless she did the court
ing, and, in consideration of the
dower, the groom, blushingly, ac
cepted.
The "happy pair" will be found at
the groom's office, where they hope
to receive their friends, thtir con
gratulations and the presents afore
said. Henry R. Gibson,
Editor.
MORE
DEMOCRATIC BLUNDERING
PROPOSED.
A n amber of Tennessee Demo-
ratic journal are advocating a reap
portionment of the State by the new
Tennessee Legislature. This is
demanded because of the fact that
the last Legislature gerrymandered
the Senatorial and Flotorial districts
of East Tennessee in the interest of
the Republican party. Bristol Re-
porter, (Dem.) .
The silliness of such babble would
be incredible did we not see it in
print.
The last Legislature was Demo
cratio, and the charge that it redis
tricted "East Tennessee in the
interest of the Republicans" is a
direct assault upon the wisdom,
integrity and good faith of the
Democratic majority.
Nobody ever heard of a second
redistricting within ten years, and
the ConstituJon of the State makes
no provision for such action.
A few Democrats, made drunk by
the wine of victory, are ready to en
gage in any sort of political excess
that promises to give them one office
more.
This is the same spirit of
revolution that seeks to de
prive Mississippi Chalmers of his
seat, and to keep Louisiana Kellogg
out of Congress.
If it were not for such fanatical
revolutionists and such incendiary
anarchists, the Democratic Party
would have had a President before
thiB.
The Democrats ought to establish
a political Lunatic Asylum, and
should hasten to confine in it all of
these fanatics and hot heads; for, as
long as they are allowed to ran at
large, so long will the Republicans
use them as mere raw-heads-and-
bloody-bones to terrify the timid
into voting for the party of law and
order.
POLL-TAX QUALIFICATIONS.
Over 100,000 white men were not
able to vote at the late election in
Virginia because thev had not paid
tneir poll tax. Politicians are now
agitating in favor of repealing the
tax, argumg that it is an incentive to
bribery, by tempting rich candidates
for office to pay the poll-tax of poor
men. Governor LoDgr and Gov
ernor-elect Butler, of Massachusetts,
where the same system exists, have
expressed their disapproval of it.
New i. or k Tribune. .
It is not generally known, but is
nevertheless true, that the Constitu
tion of Tennessee provides that
'each voter shall give to the judges
of election, where he offers to vote,
satisfactory evidence that he has
paid the poll-taxes assessed against
him for such preceding period as the
Legislature shall, prescribe, and at
such time as may be prescribed by
law; without which his vote cannot
be received,"
The Legislature of 1869V70 passed
an act enforcing said provision, but
it was subsequently repealed.
a it 1- j i .
AU aucu laws tend to in
crease political corruption, and
to degrade the right of suffrage,
It puts the rich above the poor, and
makes the primal right of freemen a
thing to be evidenced by a receipt
for money paid.
So hostile were we to any such
badge of degradation that we re
fused to sign the Constitution that
contained it
The Readjusters in Virginia and
the Democrats in Massachusetts are
moving towards a .repeal of this
purchasable privilege of "voting. :
We wish them success ; and we
wish success to every movement that
will purify the ballot-box, and ele
vate our politics.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
(Concluded from first page.)
surplus waa more than one hundred and
forty-five millions.
The report of the Secretary shows what
disposition has been made of this money.
They have not only answered the require
ments of
THE SIKKTMG FUND,
Bnt have afforded a large balance, applica
ble to other reductions of the public debt
But I renew the expression of my convic
tion, that such rapid extinguishment of the
national indebtedness as is now taking
place, is by no means a cause for congratu
lation; it is a cause rather for serious ap
prehension. If it continues, it must speedi
ly be followed by one of the evil results so
clearly set forth in the report of the Secre
tary. Either the surplus .must lie idle in
the treasury or the government will be
forced to buy, at market rates, its bonds
not then redeemable, and which, tinder
such circumstances, cannot fail to com
mand an enormous premium, or the
swollen revenues will be devoted
to extravagant expenditure, which, as ex
perience has taught, is ever the bane of an
overflowing treasury. It was made appar
ent in the course of the animated discus
sions which this question aroused at the last
session of Congress that the policy of di
minishing the revenue by reducing taxation
commanded the general approval of the
members of both Houses. I regret that
because of conflicting views as to the best
method by which that policy should be
made operative none of its benefits have as
yet been reaped.
In rulnllment of what 1 deem my consti
tutional duty, but with little hope that I can
make valuable contribution to this vexed
question, I shall proceed to intimate briefly
my own views in relation to it.
Upon the showing of
OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION
At the close of the last fiscal year, I felt
justified in recommending to Congress the
abolition of all internal revenue taxes ex
cept those upon tobacco, in its various
form, and npon distilled spirits and fer
mented liquors ; and except, also, the spe
cial tax upon the manufacturers and
dealers in such articles.
I venture now to suggest that unless it
shall be ascertained that the probable ex
penditures of the government for the com
ing .year have been underestimated, all
internal taxes, save those which relate to
DISTILLED SPIRITS,
can be prudently abrogated. Such a course,
if accompanied by a simplification of the
machinery of collection, which would then
be easy of accompliahment, might reasona
bly be expected to result in diminishing the
cont of such collection by at least two mil
lions and a half of dollars, and in the re
tirement from office of from fifteen hun
dred to two thousand persons. . The sys
tem of
EXOISI DUTIES
has never commended itself to the favor
of the American people, and has never been
resorted to, exept for supplying deficiencies
in the Treasury when, by reason of special
exigency, the duties on imports have proved
inadequate for the needs of the government.
The sentiment of the country doubtless de
mands that the present excise tax shall be
abolished as soon as such a
course can be safely pursued.
It seems to me, however, that
for various reasons, so sweeping a meas
ure as the total abolition of internal taxes
would, for the present, be an unwise step.
Twq of these reasons are deserving of
special mention: First, it is by no means
clear that even if the existing system of
duties on imports is continued without
modification, these duties alone will yield
sufficient revenue for all the needs of the
government. It is estimated that one hun
dred millions of dollars will be required for
pensions during the coming year, and it
may well be doubted whether the maxi
mum annual demand for that object has
yet been reached. Uncertainty upon this
question would alona justify, m my judg
ment, the retention, for the present, of that
portion of the system of internal revenne,
which is least objectionable to the pecfple.
Second, a total abolition of excess taxes
would almost inevitably prove a serious, if
not an insurmountable obstacle to a thor
ough revision of the tariff and to any con
siderable reduction in import duties.
TEE PSKSENT TARIFF
System is, in many respects, unjust. It
makes .unequal distributions, both of its
burdens and its benefits. This fact was
practically recognized by a majority of each
House of Congress in the passage of the act
creating the tariff commission. The report
of that commission will be placed before
you at the beginning of this session, and
will, 1 trust, afford you 6uch information as
to the condition and prospects of the vari
ous commercial, agricultural, manufactur
ing, mining and other interests of the
country, and contains such suggestions for
statutory revision as will practically aid
your action upon this important subject.
THX BXVKNVS FBOlf CUSTOMS
For the fiscal year ending June, 30, 1879,
amounted to $137,000,000. It has in the
three succeeding years reached first,
$ 166,000,000; then $198,000,000. and final
ly, as has been already stated, $220,000,000.
The income from this source for the fiscal
year, which will end on June 30, 1883, will
doubtless be considerably in excess of the
sum last mentioned.
If the tax on domestic spirits is to be re
tained, it is plain, therefore, that large re
ductions from the customs revenues are en
tirely feasible. While recommending this
reduction, I am far from advising the
abandonment of the policy of no discrim
inating in the adjustment of duties as to
afford aid and

this session, I express the hope that at least
some of the more conspicuous inequalities
or tne present law may be corrected before
your final adjournment. One of them is

rom tne report of the
THE SECRETARY OF WAS
It appears that the only outbreaks of In
dians during the past year occurred in Ari
zona and in the southwestern part of New
Mexico. They were promptly quelled, and
the quiet which has prevailed in all other
parts of the country has permitted such
an addition to be made to the
military force in the region endangered
by the Apaches; that there is little reason to
apprehend trouble in the future. Those
parts of the Secretary's report which relate
to our sea coast defences, and their arma
ment suggest the gravest reflections. Our
existing

the hope that authority and means to begin

I invite the attention of Congress, to the
propriety of making more adequate pro
vision for .'
ABMBO AND EQUIPPING THE MILITIA .
Than is afforded by the act of 1808, which
is still upon the statue book. The matter
has already been the subject of discussion
in the Senate, and a bill, which seeks to
supply the deficiencies of existing laws, is
now upon its calendar. The Secretary of
War calls attention to an embarrassment,
growing out of the recent act of Congress,
making
THE RETIREMENT OI OFTICKBS
OF THE
ABMT
compulsory at the age of 64. The act of
1878 is still in force, which limits to four
hundred, the number of those who can be
retired for disability or upon their own ap
plication. The two acts, when con
strued together, seem to forbid the re
lieving, even for absolute incapacity
of officers who do not fall within the pur
view of the later st itute, save at such times
as there chance to be less than four hundred
names on the retired list There are now
four hundred and twenty. It is not likely
that Congrtrss intended this result, and I
concur with the Secretary that the law
ought to be amended.
The grounds that impelled me to with
hold my signature from the bill entitled
An act making appropriations for the
construction, repair and preservation of
certain works on
BIVZBS AND HARBORS,"
Which became a law near the close of vour
last session, prompt me to express the
hope that no similar measure will be deem
ed necessary during the preseut session of
Congress. Indeed, such a measure would
now be open to a serious objection in addi
tion to that which was lately urged upon
your attention. I am informed by the Sec
retary of War that the greater portion of
the sum appropriated for the various items
specified in that act remains unexpend
ed. Of the new works which it
authorized, expenses have been incurred
upon two, only for which the total appro
priation was $210,000. The present availa
ble balance is disclosed by the following
table:
AMOUNT OF APPBOPBIATION, ' 1
by act of August 2, 1882, $18,738,875.
Amount of appropriation by act of June
19, 1882, $10,000. Amount of sppropria
tion for payments to J. B. Eads, $304,000.
Unexpended balance of former appropria
tions, 4,738,2l3. Total, $23,791,138.
Less amount dra wn from the Treasury be
tween July 1. 1882, and November 3, 1882,
$6,056,194. Total, $17,734,844.
It is apparent by this exhibit that so far
as concerns most of the items to which the
act of August 2, 1882, relates, there can be
no need of further appropriations until after
the close of the present session. If, how
ever, any action should seem to be neces
sary in respect to particular objects, it will
be entirely feasible to provide for those ob
jects by appropriate legislation.
It is possible, for example, that a delay
until the assembling of the next Congress
to make additional provision for
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IMPROVEMENTS
might be attended with serious conse
quences. If such should appear to be the
case, a just bill relating to that subject
would command my approval This leads
me to offer a suggestion which 1 trust will
commend itself to the wisdom of Congress.
Is it not advisable that grants of considera
ble sums of money for diverse and inde
pendent schemes of internal improvement
should be made the subjects of separate and
distinct legislative enactments. It wiu
scarcely be gainsaid, even by those who
favor the most liberal expenditures, for such
purposes are sought to be accomplished by
what is commonly called the river and har
bor bill That the practice of grouping in
such a bill
APPROPRIATIONS
for a great diversity of objects, widely
separ .ted, either in their nature or in the
locality with whi.-h they are concerned, or
in both, is one which is much to be depre
catud unless it is irremediable. It inevitably
tends to secure the success of the bill
as a whole, though many of
the items, if separately considered,
could scarcely fail of rejection. By
the adoption of the course I hare recom
mended, every member of Congress, when
ever opportunity should arise for giving his
influence and vote for meritorious appro
priations, would be enabled bo to do, with
out being called upon to sanction others,
undeserving of his approval; so, also,
would the executive be aitorded thereby full
o ortunity to exercise his constitutional
pi . rogative of opposing whatever appro-
pr.atious seemed to nun objectionable,
without imperiling the success of others
which com iii end themselves to his judgment
It may be urged in opposition to these sug
gest on, that the number of works of in
ternal improvement which are justly en
titled to govermental aid is so great as to
render impracticable
SEP ABATE APPBOPBIATION BULLS ;
Therefore, or even for such comparatively
limited number as make disposition of
large sums of money. This objection may
be well founded; and. whether it be or not,
the advantage which would be likely to en
sue from the adoption of the course 1 have
recommended may, perhaps, be more ef
fectually attained by another, which I res
pectfully submit to Congress as an alterna
tive proposition.
It is provided by the constitutions of
fourteen of our States that the executive
may disapprove any item or items, or items
of a bill appropriating " money, whereupon
the part of the bill approved shall be law.
and the part disapproved shall fail to be
come a .law, unless repassed according to
the provisions prescribed for the passage
of bills over the veto of the executive. The
States wherein some such provision as the
foregoing is a part or the fundamental law,
are: Alabama, c alifornia, Colorado, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Jersey, Ne York, Pennsyl
vania, Texas, and VV est Virginia.
I commend to your careful consideration
the question whether an
AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
In the particular indicated, would not afford
the best remedy for what is often a grave
embarrassment, both to members of Con
gress, and to the Executive, and is some
times a serious public mischief.

THE NAVY
States the movements of the various squad
rons during the year, in 'home and foreign
waters, where our officers and seaman, with
such ships as we possess, have continued to
illustrate the high character and excellent
discipline of the naval organization.
Un the 2lst of December, lsol, informa
tion' was received that the exploring steamer
Jeannette had been crushed and abandoned
in the Artie Ocean, the officers and crew,
after a journey over the ice, embarked in
three boats for the coast of nibena. One
of the parties, under command of Chief
Engineer Geo. W. Melville, reached the
land, and falling in with the natives, -was
saved. Another under
LIEUT. OOMMANDEB DS LONO,
Landed in a barren region near the mouth
of the Lena River. After six weeks had
elapsed all but two of the number had died
from fatigue and starvation. No tidings-
have been received from the party in the
third boat under the command of Lieut
Chipp. But a long and fruitless investiga
tion leaves little doubt that all its members
perished at sea. As a slight tribute to their
heroism I give in this communication the
names ofthe gallant men who sacrified their
lives on this expedition : Tiieut Commander
Geo. W. DeLong, Surgeon James M. Am
bier, Jerome J. Collins, HansHalmerErick
son, Heinrich EL Kacke, George W. Boyd,
Walter Lee, Adolph Drisaher Carl A. Gortz,
Wilse Iwison, the cook; A. H. Sam and the
Indian, Alexy. The officers and men
the missing boat were Lieut Chas. W,
Chipp, commanding; William Dunbar, Al

Kuhne, Edward Star, Henry D. Warren
and Peter E Johnson. Lieut. Gilmer B.
tlarber and master Win. 11. bcheutze are
now bringing home the remains of Lieuten
ant DeLong and his comrades, in pursu
ance of the directions of Congress. The
Rogers, fitted out for the relief of the
Jeannette, in accordance with the act of.
Congress, March 30, 1881, sailed from San
Francisco June 16th, under command of
Lieut Robt M. Berry. On November 30th
she was accidentally destroyed by fire.
while in winter quarters, in St Lawrence
bay, but the officers and crew succeeded in
escaping to the shore. 'Lieutenant Berry
and one oi ms omoers, after making
search for the Jeannette along the coast of
Siberia, fell in with Chief Engineer Mel
ville's party and returned home by way of
Europe. The other officers and the crew of
the Rogers were brought from St. Law
rence Bay by the whaling steamer North
Star. Master Chas. F. Putnam, who had
been placed in charge of a department f
supplies at Cape Serdze, returningVto
' his post . from - St 4 Lawrenoe Bay,
across - the loe in an obUng snow
storm, was carried . . out to . sea and
lost, notwithstanding all efforts to rescue

It appears by the Secretary's rei-ort that
the available naval force, of the United
States consists of thirty -seven cruisers;
fourteen single turreted monitors, built dur
ing the rebellion; a large number of
smooth-bore guns and parrot rifles and
eighty-seven rifled cannon. The cruising
vessels should be gradually replaced by
IRON OR STEEL SHIPS,
The monitors by armored vessels, and the
armament by high power rifled guns. The

nities for exercise and discipline in their
profession, under appropriate oontrol and
direction. The Secretary advises that the
LIGHT HOUSE aEBVMJE
And coast survey be transferred as now or
ganized from the Treasury to the Navy
Department, and he also suggests for the
reason which he assigns, that a similar
transfer may wisely be made of the cruising
revenue vessels. The Secretary forcibly de
picts the intimate connection and interde
pendence ef the navy and commercial ma
rine, and myites attention to the continued
decadence of the latter, and the correspond
ing transfer of our growing commerce to
foreign bottoms. This subject is one of the
utmost importance to the national welfare.
Methods of reviving
AMERICAN 8HXP BUILDING,
And of restoring the United States flag in
the ocean-carrying trade should receive the
immediate attention of Congress. We have
mechanical skill and abundont material for
the manufacture of modern iron steam
ships in fair competition with our commer
cial rivals; our disadvantage in building
ships is the greater cost of labor, and in
sailing them higher taxes and greater inter-
em on capital, wnue tne ocean highways are
already monopolized by our formidable
competitors. These obstacles should in
some way be overcome, and for our rapid
communication with foreign lands we should
not continue to depend wholly upon vessels
built in the yards of other countries, and
sailing under foreign flags. . With no United
States steamers on the principal ocean lines
or in any foreign ports, our faculties for
extending our commerce are greatly re
stricted, while the nations which build and
sail ships and carry the mails and passen
gers obtain thereby conspicuous advantages

lhe report of
POSTMASTEB-GENEBAXj
Gives evidence of the satisfactory condition
or that department and contains many val
uaDie data and accompanying suggestions
which cannot fail to be of interest. The
information which it affords, that the re
ceipts for the fiscal year have exceeded the
expenditures, muBt be very gratifying to
(jongress ana to the people of the country.
As matters which may fairly claim particu
lar attention I refer you to his observations
in reference to the advisability of changing
she present basis for fixing salaries and
allowances, of extending the money order
system and of enlarging the functions of
the postal establishments, so as to
put under its control the telegraph
system of the country; though from
this last and most important recommenda
tion, I must withhold my concurrence,
At the last session of Congress several
bills were introduced into the House of
Representatives for the reduction of letter
postage to the rate of two cents per- half
ounce. I have given much study and re
flection to this subject and am thoroughly
persuaded ' that such a reduction would be
for the best interests of the public It has
been the policy of the government from its
foundation to defray as far as possible the
expenses of carrying the mails by a direct
tax in the form ot postage, it has never
been claimed, that this service ought to be
productive of a net revenue. As has been
stated already, the report of the Postmaster-
General shows that there is now a consul
erable surplus in his department, and that
henceforth the receipts are 1 likely to in
crease at a much greater ratio than the
necessary expenditures. Unless some
change is made in the existing laws, the
profits of the postal service will in a very
few years swell the revenues of the govern
ment many millions ot dollars.
The time seems auspicious, therefore, for
some
SEDUCTION IN THE BATES OF POSTAGE.
In what " shall that reduc
tion consist ? A review of
the legislation which has been had upon
this subject during the last thirty years,
discloses that domestic letters constitute the
only class of mail matter which has never
been favored by a substantial reduction of
rates. I am convinced that the burden of
maintaining the service falls most unequally
upon that class, and more than any other
it is entitled to present relief, and that such
relief may be extended without detriment
to other public interests, will be discovered
upon reviewing the results of former reduc
tions. Immediately prior to the act of 1845,
the postage up n a letter composed of a
single sheet was as follows:
If conveyed 30 miles or less, 6 cents; be
tween 30 and 80 miles, 10 cents; between
80 and 150 miles, 12 cents; between 150
and 400 miles, 25 cents. By the act of
1845 the postage upon a single letter, con.
veyed for any distance under 300 miles, was
fixed at 5 cents, and for any greater distance,
at 10 cents. By the act of 1851, it was pro
vided that a single letter, if prepaid, should
be carried an distance not-exceeding three
thousand miles, for 3 cents, ai d any greater
distance, for 6 cents. It will be noticed that
both these reductions were of a radical
character and relatively quite as important
as that which is now proposed. In each
case there ensued a temporary loss of rev
enue, but a sudden and large influx of busi
ness, which substantially repaired that loss
within three years, unless the experience of
past legislation in this country and else
where goes for naught, it may be -Safely
predicted that the stimulus of 33 per cent
reduction in the tax for carriage would at
once increase the number of letters con
signed to the ma Is. The advantages of se
crecy would lead to a very general substitu
tion of sealed packages, for postal cards
and open circulars and in divers other ways.
The volume of -.
FIB8T-OI1AS8 MATTER
Would be enormously augmented. Such
increase amounted in England, in the first
year after the adoption of penny postage to
more than 125 per cent, as a result of care
ful estimates, the details of which cannot be
here set out I have become convinced
convinced that the deficiency for the first
year after the proposed' reduction would
not exoeeed 7 per cent of the expendi
tures, or $300,000,000, while the deficiency
after the reduction of 1845 was more than
14 per cent, and after that of
1851 was 27 per cent Another
interesting comparison is afforded
by the statistics furnished me by the Post
office Department The aot of 1845 was
passed in face of the fact that there existed
a deficiency of more than $30,000; that of
1851 was encouraged by the slight surplus
of $132,000. The excess of revenue in the
next fiscal year is likely to be $300,000. If
Congress should approve these suggestions,
it may be deemed desirable to supply, to
some extent the deficiency which must for
a time result by increasing the charge for
carrying merchandise, which is now only
sixteen cents per pound; ; but even without
such an increase, I am confident that the
receipts under the diminished rates would
equal the expenditures after the lapse of
three or four years. .

THE DEPABTMENT OF rUBTICB

enlarging the -present system of Federal
jurisprudence, so as effectually to answer
the requirements of the ever-increasing liti
gation with which it is called npon to deal
The Attorney -General reviews th aug.
gestiona of his predecessors, that in the
Interest of justioe, better provision than the
existing laws afford should be made in cer
tain judicial districts for fixing the fees of
witnesses ana jurors.
In my message of December last I referred
to pending criminal proceedings growing
out of alleged frauds in what is known as
the Star Koute service of the rost-otnee
Department and advsed you that I had
enjoined upon the Attorney General and
associate counsel, to whom the interests of
the government were intrusted, the duty of
prosecuting, with the utmost vigor of the
law, all persons who might be found
chargeable with those offenses. A trial of
one of those cases has since occurred. It
occupied, for many weeks, the attention of
the Supreme Court of this district and
was conducted with great zeal and ability.
It resulted in a disagreement of the jury,
but the cause has been again placed upon
the calendar and will shortly be retired. If
any guilty persons shall finally escape pun
ishment for their offenses, it will not be for
lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the
part of the prosecution. I trust that some
agreement may be reached which will
speedily enable Congress, with the concur
rence of the Executive, to afford the com
mercial community the benefits of a nation
al bankrupt law.

of that department
In respect to Indian affairs, noth
ing has occurred which has changed
or seriously modified the views to which
is devoted much space in a former
communication to Congress. I renew the
recommendation therein contained as to ex
tending to the Indian the protection of the
law allotting land individually to such as
desire it and making suitable provision for
the education of youth. Such provision as
the Secretary forcibly maintains will prove
("unavailing unless it is broad enough to in
clude all those who are able and willing to
make use of it, and should not solely relate
to intellectual training, but also to instruc
tion in such manual labor and simple in
dustrial arts as can be made practically
available.
Among other important subjects which
are included within the Secretary's report
and which will doubtless furnish occasion
for Congressional action may be mentioned
the neglect of the railroad companies to
which large grants of land weie made by
the aot of 1862 and' 1864 to take
title thereto and their oonsent
in equitable exemption from
local taxation. No survey of of our mate
rial condition can fail to suggest inquiries
as to the moral and intellectual progress of
the people.
AN ALARMING STATE OF ILLITERACY
in certain portions of the country, where
the provision for schools is inadequate. It
is a momentous question for the decision of
Congress whether immediate and substan
tial aid should not be extended by the gen
eral government for supplementing the
efforts of private beneficence, and of State
and territorial legislation in behalf of edu
cation.
lhe regulation of inter-state commerce
has already been the subject of your delib
erations.
One of the incidents of the marvelous
extension of the railway system of the
country has been the adoption of such
measures by the corporations which own
or control the roads as has tended to im
pair the advantages of healthful competition
and to make hurtful discriminations in the
adjustment of freightage. These inequali
ties have been corrected in several of the
States by appropriate legislation, the effect
of which is necessarily restricted to the
limits of their own territory, so far as such
mischiefs affect oonimerce between the
States, or between any one of the States
off foreign country, they are subjects of
national concern, and Congress alone can
afford relief. The results which have thus
far attended the enforcement of the recent
statute for
THE SUPPRESSION OF POLYGAMY
In the Teritories, are reported by the Secre
tary of the Interior. It is not prabable that
any additional legislation in this regard will
be deemed desirable until the effect of exist
ing laws shall be more closely observed and
B.udied 1 congratulate you that the com
missioners, under whose supervision those
laws have been put in operation, are en
couraged to believe that the evil at which
they are aimed, may be suppressed without
resort to such radical measures as, in some
quarters, have been thought indispensable
for success.
The olose relation of the general govern,
ment to the Territories, preparing to be-
come great states, may well engage your
special attention. It is there that the
disturbances mainly occur, and that polyga
my has found room for its growth. I can
not doubt that a careful survey of Territorial
legislation would be of the highest utility,
and that life and proper
ty would become more secure.
The liability of outbreaks between the In
dians and whites would be lessened, the
publio domain would be more securely
guarded, and better progress be made in the
instruction of the young. Alaska is still
without any forms of oivii government If
means were provided for the education of
its people and for the protection of their
lives and property, the immense resources
of the region would invite permanent set
tlements and open new fields for industry
and enterprise. The report of
THE COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE
presents an account of the labors of that
department during the past year and in
cludes information of much interest to the
general public. The condition of the for
ests of the country and the wasteful manner
in which the desnruotion is taking place,
give cause for serious apprehension. Thir
action in protecting the earth's surface, in
modif ing the extremes of climate, in regu
lating and sustaining the flow of springs
and streams is now well understood, and
their importance in relation to the growth
and prosperity of the country cannot be
safely disregarded. They are fast disap
pearing before destructive fires and the le
gitimate requirements of our increasing
population, their total extinction cannot
be long delayed unless better methods
than now prevail shall be
adopted for their protection and
cultivation, the attention of Congress is
invited to the necessity of additional legis
lation to secure the pres6rva ion of the val
uable forests still remaing on the publio
domain especially in the extreme western
States and territories, where the necessity
for their preservation is greater than in less
mountainous regions, and where . the pre
vailing dryness of the climate renders their
restoration, if they are once destroyed, well
nigh impossible.
The communication which I wrote Con
gress at its first session in December last
contained a somewhat full statement of my
semtiments in relation to the priuciples and
rules which ought to govern
APPOINTMENTS TO PUBLIC SERVICE.
Referring to the various plans which had
heretofore been the subject of discusion in
the National Legislature." .Plans which in
the main were modeled upon the system
which obtains in Great Britain but which
lacked certain of the prominent features,
whereby that feature is distinguished. I felt
bound to intimate my doubts whether they,
or any of them, would afford adequate
remedy for the events which they aimed to
correct I declare, nevertheless, that if the
proposed measure should prove acceptable to
Congress they would receive the unhesitating
support of the executive. Sinoe these sug
gestions were submitted for your considera
tion, there has been no legislation npon the
subject to which they relate, but there has
meanwhile been an increase in the publio
interest in that subject, and the people of
the country, apparently without distinction
, of party, have, in various ways and upon
frequent occasions, given expression to their
earnest wish for prompt and definite action.
In my judgment, such action should no
longer be postponed. I may add that my
own sense of its pressing importance has
been quickened by observation of a practi
cal phase of the matter, to which attention
has more than onee been called by my pre
decessor. . .
The civil district now comprises about
one hundred thousand persons, for the
larger part of whom must, under the terms
of the constitution, be selected by the
President, either directly or through his
own appointees. In the early years of the
administration of the government the per
sonal direction of appointments to the civil
service may not have been an irksome task
fox the executive, but ow, that the
burden has increased folly a- hundred
fold, H has beoom gnats
than ha onirht to bear, and it necessarily di
verts his time and attention from the proper
discharge of other duties no less delicate
and responsible, and which in tne very m
tare of things cannot be delegated to other
hands. In the judgment of not a rew woo
have given study and reflection to this mat
ter the nation has outgrown the provisions
which the Constitution has established for
filling minor offices in the publio service.
But whatever may be thought of the wis
dom or expediency of changing the tunaa-
mental law in this regard, 11 is ceruuu iui
much relief may be afforded, not only to
the President and to the heads of the de- 1
partments, but to Senators and Represent
atives in Congress. By discreet legislation
they would be protected in a great measure

PEBSONAL IMPOBTUNITT
And from the labor of exaining confl cting

trust that before the close of the present
session some decisive action may be taken
for the correction of the evils which
arise in the present methods of appoint

government It seems to be generally
agreed that whatever their extent or char
acter the one shall be definite and the
other stable, and that neither should be
regulated by zeal in the service of fidelity
of party or fidelity to the fortunes of an in
dividual. It matters little to the people at
large what competent person is at the head
of this department or of that bureau if they
feel assured that the removal ox one ana
the accession of another will not involve
the retirement of honest and faithful subor
dinates, whose duties are purely adminis
trative and have no legitimate connection
with the triumph of any political princi
ples or the success of any political party
or faction. It is to this latter class of of
ficers that the Senate bill, to which I have
already referred, exclusively applies, while
neither that bill nor any other prominent
scheme, for improving the civil servic e,
concerns the higher grade of of
ficials who are appointed by
the President, and confirmed by the Senate.
I feel bound to correct a prevalent mis
apprehension as to the frequency with
which the present executive nas displaced
the incumbent of an office and appointed
another in his stead. It has been repeated
ly alleged that he has, in this particular,
signally departed from the course which has
been pursued under recent administrations
of the government The facts are as fol
lows: "The whole number of Executive ap
pointments during the four years immedi
ately preceding Mr. Garfield's accession to
the Presidency, was 2,696. Of this num.
ber 244, or 9 per cent, involved the removal
of previous incumbents.
THE BATIO OF REMOVALS
To the whole number of appointments, was
much the same during each of these four
years. In the hrst year, with 79U appoint
ments, there were 74 removals, or 9 3-10 per
cent In the second, with 917 appoint
ments, there were 85 removals, or 8 5-10
per cent In the third, with 480
appointments, there were 48
removals, or 10 per cent In the
fourth, with 429 appointments, there were
37 removals, or 8.6.10 percent; in the four
months of President Garfield's administra
tion there were 390 appointments and 89
removals, or 22.7-10 per cent. Precisely
the same number of removals (89) has taken
place in the fourteen months which have
since elapsed, but they constitute only
7.8-10 per cent of the whole number of
appointments, 1,118, within that period,
and less than 2 6-10 of the entire list of
officials, 3.459, exclusive of the army and
navy, which is filled by Presidential ap
pointment

POLITICAL ASSESSMENT.
In July last I authorized a public announce
ment that employes of the government
should regard themselves as at liberty to
exercise their pleasure in making or refus
ing to mae political contributions, and
that their action in that regard would in no
manner affect their official standing. In
this announcement I acted upon
the view which I had always
maintained and still maintain that a publio
officer should be as absolutely free as any
other citizen to give or withhold oontriba
tions for the aid of the political party of
his choice. It has, however, been urged,
and doubtless not without foundation in.
fact, that by solicitation of official superi
ors and by other modes, such contributions
have at times been obtained from persons
whose only motive for giving has been the
fear of what might befall them if they re
fused. It goes without saying that such
OONTBIBUTXONS
are not voluntary, and in my judgment
their collection should be prohibited by
law. A bill which will effectually suppress
them, will receive my cordial approval. I
hope that, however numerous and urgent
may be the demands upon your atteLtion,
the interests of this District will not be for
gotten. The denial to its residents of the
great rights of suffrage, in all its relations
to national, state and municipal action,
imposes upon Congress the duty of afford
ing them the best administration which its
wisdom can devise.
The report of the District commissioners
indicate certain measures whose adoption
would seem to be very desirable. I in
stance, in particular, those whioh relate to
arrears of taxes, to steam railroads and to
assessments of real property.
Among the questions which have been
the topic of recent debate in the halls of
Congress, none are of greater gravity than
those relating to the ascertainment of the
vote for Presidential elections and the in
tention of the constitution in its provisions
for devolving executive functions upon the
Vice-President when the President suffers
from inability to discharge the powers and
duties of his office. I trust that no em
barrassments may result from a failure to
determine these questions before another
national election.
The closing year has been replete with
blessings, for which we owe to the Giver of
all Good our reverential acknowledgement
for the uninterrupted harmony of our for
eign relations, for the decay of sectional
animosities, for the exuberance of our har
vests and the triumphs of our mining and
manufacturing industries, for the prevalence
of health, the spread of intelligence
and the conservation of the public
credit, for the growth of the country in all
the elements of national Kreatness for these
and countless other blessings, we should re
joice and be glad. I trust that under the
inspiration of this great prosperity our
counsels may be harmonious and that the
dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice
and economy may lead to the adoption of
measures in which the Congress and Execu
tive may heartily unite.
