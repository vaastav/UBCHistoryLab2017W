MESSAGE.
In the light of the peevish, constant
and undeserved criticisms of President
Taft upon any and all occasions it is
quite refreshing to at last observe a
partial awakening to the presence in
a large measure of real statesman
ship in the nation's chief executive.
Jn reviewing the president's message
the St. Paul Dispatch says:
If the message of President Taft
may be said to contain a keynote—
and there is no reason why an ominis
sion should necessarily subject it to
criticism—it is found in ins emphasis
of the importance of economy and ef
ficiency in the administration of the
many departments of the government.
Among the recurring annual prob
lems of administration, there is
nothing pending that rises to
the dignity of a vital point or critical
issue demanding that consideration
If there has been public expecta
tion of some startling expression con
cerning the two leading questions of
the day—the tariff and the railroads
—it will fail to be realized. Roth sub
jects are dismissed with comparative
brevity. The tariff commission has not
acquired the information indispensable
to an intelligent consideration of the
schedules, and there is nothing but
to wait patiently. The question of the
protective principle is up to the peo
ple, not to congress, not to the ad
ministration. But in this, as in all
other subjects discussed. President
Taft is strong in his faith and firm
in his position. He stands where he
has always stood. If an election storm
has passed over the country it has left
no traces upon the serenity of the
chief magistrate. He renews his ex
pression of confidence in the results of
the policy of the tariff board inves
tigation, and the single schedule con
sideration. His one warning is against
unsettling business by agitation and
uncertainty.
Upon the trust and transportation
problems his attitude is that of await-
ing developments. The effect of the
enlarged powers of the interstate I
commission is yet to be determined,
and the scope of the anti-trust act ia
regarded as sufficient to meet all
present conditions. Congress is not
pressed, at this time, to the consider
ation of these questions, and Presi
dent Taft contents himself, in this
connection, with recommending a law
that will prevent the transcontinental
railways, for obvious reasons, from
controlling the steamship companies
that will benefit by the Panama can
al, when completed. The canal, by
the way. occupies a large and inter
esting place in the message, the presi
dent expressing his satisfaction with
both the progress and status, recom
mending a toll of $1 per net ton to be
charged and emphasizing the advisa
bility of fortification at a cost of $19,
000,000.
A summary of the features of the
message would be fittingly headed by
it» strong demand for the 'cheapening
the cost of litigation by simplifying

E CENSUS FIGURES.
The census figures for the state of
North Dakota has been announced by
Director K. Dana Durand, the total
population being something over ."7,
000. Then years ago the federal cen
sus gave North Dakota something
more than 319.000. This shows an in
crease of about 2.10.000 in the ten
year period, and while the total is not
as great as some enthusiastic prophets
have hoped, it shows steady and sub
stantial growth. The next decade will
see a still greater proportionate in
crease in population, for the tide has
been flowing pretty steadily toward
the stale in the past ten years and is
still flowing westward to the great ag
ricultural area.
Tne figures so far announced do
not give tiie population of the cities
that would make it the dominant note I"'' state, but these will follow in a
of his recommendations to congress.
He has taken advantage of tne fact to
shake up the dry bones of archaic sys
tems in operation and urge the adop
tion of methods calculated to reduce
the expense of the governmental ma
chinery and bring it to a higher state
of efficiency. Through the somewhat
formidable state document he has
short time. There is naturaly great lo
cal interest in the relative showing
made by the larger cities of the state.
It will be found that a considerable
number of the cities show as great a
proportionate increase as the state as
large. Bismarck, for example, will
no doubt show a substantial growth,
and the best of it is that the census
transmitted are frequent recurrences has been taken pretty accurately and
of the advisability of substituting mod-: without padding.
em ideas for antiquated and cumber
some departmental systems and al
ways with the emphasis upon the
necessity of reducing cost and improv
ing results.
The figures show that Burleigh
county has doubled in population in
the past decade. Morton county has
grown from 8,000 to 25.000. Other fig
ures of growth are indicative of the
substantial advance of North Dakota.
And in the next few years there ought
to be further efforts on the part of
al interested to build and develop
North Dakota. The good work that has
been done the past ten years must
be kept up.
The central and western part of
the state show the greatest propor
tionate increases in population. The
eastern counties have not grown with
anything like the rapidity that the
western counties have. And there is
ample room for growth in these east
ern counties, too. But there is need
through the whole state of smaller
farms, more intense cultivation and
move people supported from the soil.
This will mean not only a vast in
crease in population but in wealth as
well.
The total figures indicate that North
Dakota will hardly get a third con
gressman, as it was hoped would be
the case. The tendency is apt to be to
increase the number of persons in con
gressional districts rather than to de
crease it. and keep the total member
ship of congress as low as possible
consistent with fair representation.

army are variously estimated at from
400.000 to 700.000. and the historians

ures are a gross exaggeration, but it

LONDON THEATERS.
The Historic Pit That Is Fenced Ofi
From the Stalls.
In the orchestra of a London theater
there are only eight or ten rows of
staKs, and immediately behind them is
the pit whic.li is walled off by a bar
rier or feace that stretches clear across
the theater. In the pit there are no
individual seats—merely rows of long
benches on which the people sit rather
closely together.
It is, of course. Impossible to reserve
seats in advance, and people who are
going to the pit have to come early on
the evening of the performance in or
der to secure the best places.
Hence in the case of a popular play
a long queue of people may be seen at
7 o'clock stretching from the pit door
all along the sidewalk, waiting for the
house to open. They keep their places
very patiently in line, united by a com
mon mood of pleasurable anticipation.
One manager awhile ago made the
experiment of selling reserved seats in
the pit at the usual price, but to this
the pit people objected strenuously on
the ground that they could seldom
know in advance just when they would
find themselves possessed of that hap
py combination of money and an even
ing off which would permit of theater
going and preferred to take their
chances waiting in line when the for
tunate opportunity arrived.
The pit is patronized by people of a
very estimable class and is often fre
quented by well educated men and
women who wish to save money and
1o not care to dress. Whereas a seat
in the stalls costs half a guinea (or ap
proximately S2.M)). a place in the pit
costs only two and six (or approxi
mately CO cents), and the play can be
seen very nearly as well.
In the pit the same program that is
sold in the stalls for sixpence is sold
for twopence, and the pit has a re
freshment bar of its own which is
cheaper than the main bar of the thea
ter. Of course the real reason why
there is a pit in the London theater is
that there has always been a pit. That
in itself is sufficient for the British
mind, but it must be admitted that the
system is on grounds of common sense
an exceedingly good one.—Bookman.
Quite Poetic
"Tell me. Harry," said May Bright
ley's admirer to her young brother,
"who is this other fellow that's been
calling on your sister?"
"I don't know his name." replied
Harry. "I just call him 'April show

"What for?"
"Because he brings May flowers."

LOCAL GUARDSMEN ARE AROUSED OVER E INJUSTICE METED
The only dissatisfaction existing
among the local guardsmen wa3 that
fifty dollars was all that they could
I send, and they are anticipating that
every company in the state of North
Dakota will respond as generously as
they have.
The case of Sergeant Manley has
been running in the Associated Press
stories but for the general informa
tion of those who are unfamiliar with
the case, the following article is re-

jury influenced by the anarchistic
howling of a yellow newspaper and
local prejudice against the national
guard, found Sergeant Manley guilty
of murder and the trial judge sentenc
ed him to 99 years in state's prison.
Sergeant Manley is a victim of the
grossest miscarriage of justice and if
necessary his case must be carried
to the highest court in the land, but
that justice be secured.
Briefly, the story of Sergeant Man
lev's case is as follows:
On October 23, 1909, President Taft
visited the big state fair at Dallas.
Texas. A tremendous crowd had been
anticipated and extra precautions for
the protection of the president had
been taken. On the occasion of the
army's military tournament in that
city shortly prior to the president's
visit, a hot bed of dangerous anarch
ists had been discovered—hence the
precautions for the president's pro
tection. Officers of the national guard
who were proficient with the revolver
were assigned to special duty around
the president's carriage. Extraordi
narily strenuous orders were issued
to the militia which had been called
out to do police duty. Sergeant J. D.
Manley, Company E. Third infantry of
Dallas, was stationed at an extremely
hazardous point and he was ordered
to see that no person be allowed to
cross a certain forbidden zone. Man-

soldier had no other recourse but
to present his bayonet at the charge
and the death of Reichenstein resulted.
Sergeant Manly was turned over to
the civilian authorities and later the
grnd jury returned the indictment of
murder in the first degree. Believing
it impossible to obtain a fair trial in
Dallas county, a change of venue was
asked for but denied. The trial was
short, the jury returning the verdict
of murder in the first degree and the
court sentenced the soldier to life
imprisonment. An appeal has been
taken but meanwhile the soldier has
to remain in jail, being denied any bail
whatever.
So far the expenses of the trial have
been borne by the officers of the Dal
las guard, and the burden has been
very heavy. Sergeant Manly has a
young wife, and a baby four months
old at the time the trouble occurred,
and his family has had to be cared for
during his incarceration in jail for
he is a man of no means and had been
working at a salary that had not per
mitted him to save.

pends the very existence of the nation

many other states. Manly has been in
jail for nearly a year and ha3 been de
nied bail. He was tried and convicted
in effect not of committing murder as
the verdict recites, but of being a na-

USUALLY ONE DOSE
ENDS INDIGESTION
If your meals don't fit comfortably
or you feel bloated after eating, and
you believe it is the food which fills
you if what little you eat lies like a
lump of lead on your stomach if
there is difficulty in breathing after
eating, eructations of sour, undigested
food and acid, heartburn, brash or a
belching of gas, you can make up
your mind that you need something
to stop food fermentation and cure
indigestion.
I To make every bite of food you eat
'aid in the nourishment and strength
of your body, you must rid your
stomach of poisons, excessive acid
and stomach gas, which sours your
'entire meal—interferes with digestion
and causes so many sufferers of dys
pepsia. Sick Headache, Biliousness,
Constipation. Griping, etc. Your case
is no different—you are a stomach
sufferer, though you may call it by
some other name your real and only
trouble is that which you eat does not
iii.'. but quickly ferments and sours,
.u-odiK-ing almost any unhealthy con
dition.
A case of Pape's Dl&pepsin will
eo.-.t fifty cents at any pharmacy
here, and will convince any stomach
sufferer five minutes after taking a
single e'oso that fermentation and
sour stomach is causing the misery of
indigestion.
No matter if you call your trouble
Catarrh of the Stomach. Nervousness
or Gastritis, or by any other name—
always remember that a certain cure
is waiting at any drug store the nio
imon: you decide to begin its use.
I Pape's Diapepsin will regulate any
out-of-order stomach within five min
utes, and digest promptly, without any
fuss or discomfort, all of any kind of
food you eat.
HELPED BY A HAMMER.
A Little Business Incident to Which
Hangs a Moral.
Two blocks apart in a certain street
are two stationery stores. The owner
of one has abundant capital, has a
wide, roomy place.with a large stock
of goods well displayed. The store of
the other man is a mere hole in the
wall in a dingy building, yet this deal
er is getting most of the business.
The following incident may explain
it A woman who had just moved to
the vicinity stopped in the larger store
one evening to buy some picture nails,
but was told that they were not sold
there.
"Where can I buy them?" she asket1
politely.
"I don't know." said the proprietor.
The woman went to the smaller store.
This man had no picture nails either
"I have a box of old nails that I use
myself." he explained. "Perhaps some
of them might do."
The woman gratefully accepted his
offer and found some nails that an
swered her purpose. She remembered
then that she had no hammer. "I can
lend you one." said the shopkeeper, "if
you will bring it back in the morning."
Ever since that time that woman has
walked the extra blocks to patronize
the obliging merchant. She has told
her friends of the incident and influ
enced them to become customers.
The lesson taught by this insignifi
cant Incident is one that is only too
often neglected. It pays a small
tradesman to be obliging—it pays all
of us. Small favors bring large re
turns.—Chicago Tribune.
