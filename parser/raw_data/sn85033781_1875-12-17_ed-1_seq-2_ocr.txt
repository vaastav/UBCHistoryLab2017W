The Iresident niaele a very singular error in
j his aiiuual message ono which is creating
much unfavorable comment among the legal
fraternity. He says, in his message, that Con
( gress should devise some better methoel of veri
: lying claims against the Government than at
1 present exists through the Court of Claims, es
je lally those claims growing out of the late
I war. and that a very large percentage of the
amounts passed anil paid are either wholly fruud-
uleut or are far in excess of the real losses
1 alleged to have- been sustained on small farms.
I The blunder made by the President is this, that
; the subject-matter of which he treats is out
side of the jmisehction of the Court of Claims.
' and the points which he makes have no appii
cation to that Court, which has nothing what
ever to do with tlie class of cases alluded to.

possessions.
