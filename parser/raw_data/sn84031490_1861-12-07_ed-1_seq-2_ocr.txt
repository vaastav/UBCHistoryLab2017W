SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1861.
A. BIDICCIors FIASCO.
One of those ridiculous but amusing,
inexcusable but unfortunate, blunders
which sometimes pursue the best in
tentions, has been made in Washing
ton by the joint efforts of the Cabi
net and Secretary of War, the conse
quences of which will, we fear, be unfa
vorable to the popular cause. It seems
that, after Mr. Cameron had finished his
Annual Report, he caused it to be printed
in pamphlet form and sent out to the larger
journals of the country, each copy under a
double envelope, with directions on the in
ner one not to open it until after the Prcsi
deni's Message was read in Congress. Sub
sequently the Report iiecame the subject of
discussion in the Cabinet, and its modifica
tion in what relates to the arming of the
escaped slaves of rebel masters, was deemed
necessary. Changes were made in accord
ance with the will of the President, and, in
its altered form, the document was sent to
Congress. Meanwhile, the Report, as
originally written,, was on its way to all
parts of the country where the mmls could
bear it. The copies sent to this city arrived
here on Wednesday morning, and were re
printed in the city papers on Thursday,
greatly to the delight of the public. But the
fad now comes out that the advance copies
were not the Report that was read to the
Representatives of the people. Elsewhere
we print an account of the case, as far as it
has been developed, and while begging for
it the reader s attention, we content our
selves with saying that it is unfortu
nate, in so far as it exposes the Ad
ministration to a certain degree of blame
for not guarding against such a stupid
blunder, and gives men who would
be glad to claim the President as
an adherent of their do-nothing-to-hurt
slavery policy, a chance to do mischief.
Wc shall see what will come of it. But,
whatever be the end of the matter, the
march of opinion is onward; and the pol
icy to winch we have so pertinaciously ad
hered—that of taking advantage of all
proper and constitutional methods of end
ing this war by putting down the rebellion
and restoring the Union in its integrity—is
that which must be finally adopted. It com
mends itself to the people by its obvious
necessity, and its easy practicability; and
tho*dgh President and Cabinet should op
pose it, three months would not elapse be
fore the outcry of the masses would com
pel them to embrace it and to make warfor
the preservation of the country, without a
thought of what may become of Slaveiy.
the military pass system.
By tlie system that lias prevailed for the
conveyance of troops by railroad, the prac
tice has been for the officer in command to
direct his Quartermaster to furnish the
transportation required- The Quartermas
ter turns over the order to the railroad
company, number of men and destination
being specified. On this, the railroad com
puny arc glad to issue their tickets, receiv
ing as their voucher the certificate. The
tickets issued are the ordinary passage tick
et, at two cents per mile, stamped in red
ink across the face “ U. S. Military Ticket ,
Army Bate. 11
Each of the tickets thus issued repre
sents a value and a cost to the Govern
ment of two dollars for every hundred
miles. And here is a leak out of which
the Government has lost hundreds of thou
sands, the past year. When the figures
come in, they will be appalling. These
tickets have been used without shadow of
Tight, bj thousands of men who would he
ashamed to be caught stealing a dollar, and
yet, by riding on military tickets, the act
was scarcely more honest Officers who
would indignantly resent any charge of
Squandering public or private funds in their I
hands, have had a strange Lmty of princi
ple in these military tickets. It would be
not a whit more dishonest in principle,
while it would be the same as regards the
United States Treasury, were the Collector
cf tins port to treat Ms friends to U. S.
Treasury notes, and quite a pile of them
might slip through his fingers and not cost
the Government more than the practice
That has prevailed among Colonels and
Quartermasters in too many of our camps.
There are places in Illinois where recruit
ing has been going on, where these military
tickets have been used by hundreds, by
persons who possessed no claim whatever.
They have been used by townsmen, with
out military claim or even pretence. They
have been sold by Quartermasters. They j
have passed from hand to hand in conn- i
tiy towns, and in the city, until it came to
be received as a neat joke, and altogether i
the thing to ride on a military ticket
Some, and indeed many, have thought
that by their use of these tickets, the rail
road company only carried one dead-head
the more, but this is a false idea. The more
of these tickets used, the belter the content
ment of the railroads, for Unde Sam pays
for all. We notice that Gen. Halleckis
looking into this matter thoroughly, and
nil our commanders should set at work to
reform this thing utterly. Hundreds of
thousands of dollars have been lost already.
It is time to stop the leak.
TOO TTULIi GITE ?—PASS AROUND
THE PAPER.
At the nest •war meeting, no matter
where held, the question of the confisca
tion of the slaves of rebels will he sure to
come up, and some man will he found who
will go over the usual balderdash about
“ constitutional rights/’the “border States,”
&C-. &c., &c. } in the endeavor to befog and
obfusticate this plain matter. 2sow we
Lave a short and infallible method with
him and all like him, which we hope our
friends will not fail to adopt, the very next
time these old pro-slavery formulas and
semi-secession justifications for rebellion
are trotted out.
"Wc propose this: Let a subscription pa
per he started and carried all through the
Northwest,''and let the Editor of the Chicago
Times bear it. It may read like this:
We, fathers and mothers of families, agree to
give each the number of eons set opposite our
names respectively./or Utc purpose of mnirfng the
pre-ent contest between Freedom and Slavery a
war for the protection of Slavery 1
Let the Editor of the Times carry this
around, and close after him let the Editor
of the Stoic Segistcr follow with another
paper in the following language :
Whereas, The country Is engaged in a war
brought on by the rebellion of the slave-holding
power In the Republic against the constituted au
thorities ; and,
Wuebeas. A large proportion of our country
men in the North believe (hat It i« the clear and
Undoubted right and Imperative duty of the Gov

and turn them to advantage in the armies of the
North; and.
Whereas, Wefearthat without special and earn

JIEBELB, THAT TBCTH SERVICE OR LABOR SHALL SOT
EE DIVESTED TO THE LOTAt CAUSE, BUT
WHERE IT 18 SOW EMPLOYED, IS HOSTILITY TO THE
Cosenrunos asu the law !
The real, • thorough-going, dear-grit,
earnest loyal men of the country are every
riay paying largely for a policy that is ex
ceedingly distasteful to them, solely be
cause of the allegiance they; owe to the
Government, and the necessity, in some
fchape, of maintaining the combat which
Slavery commenced. Now in view of this
fact, we want papers like those that we
print above to go about for the benefit of
those to whom the present policy is accept
able. They are the touchstones that would
develop the true sentiments of the people;
and the men who arc urging upon the Gov
ernment a lenient. policy towards the
rebels, the “peculiar character” of
“slave property,” the necessity of
keeping the Border States in good humor
with the troops who are there defending
their firesides and children, should not hes
itate to set these papers a-going, that the
direction of public sentiment may be
proved by an infallible test
But what lias Ibis to do with the question
at issue? cries one. Wc answer thus:
The money and lives which arc now car
rying on the war, as it is being carried on,
are, if not subscribed by the people, paid
by them nevertheless; and of the hundreds
of millions of the first, and* the thousands
and tens of thousands of the last, h full half
are expended and poured out in conse
quence of that policy at Washington which
obstinately and in defiance of light and
knowledge, insists that the slaves shall
work for the rebels and not for us. The
war taxes .every pound of sugar, tea and
coffee, every yard of calico and eve
ry bar of iron. We pay indirectly,
but wc pay nevertheless: and of ev
ery dollar collected by the Govern
ment for war purposes, fifty cents go
for the protection of slavery; and out of
each two lives lost in defence of our coun
try and our cause, one goes to the account
of the manner in which the war Is
conducted. Wc are bleeding at ev
ery post. Every man who has a bush
el of grain to sell, every, mechanic waiting
for customers, every merchant fight
ing against bankruptcy—every man, no
matter what his pursuits, feels in his dimin
ished receipts and his declining business,
-that there is war in the land, and that he is
contributing his share to carry it on. We
believe that they want it so conducted
that it may soon be brought to a close; that
they desire the Government to use all
legitimate methods of warfare to ac
complish tha,t purpose; that, with an army
of 600,000 men in the field and nothing
done, they are getting tired of the fruitless
expense and the waste of blood, a large
part of which is consumed in trying not to
hurt the “peculiar property” of the men
who are whetting their knives to cut our
throats. If any do not believe this, let
them take the subscription papers that we
have drawn up, and go around among the
heads of families, who hare sons to spare,
and among the tax-payers generally, who
foot the war bills, and test their sentiments
bv soliciting contributions directly and
openly—without sham, subterfuge, or the
intervention of red tape—for continuing the
llircc that has thus far been kept up.
3IOKE MODIFICATIONS,
Emasculation of Secretary Cameron’s
Report.
The telegraph has been singularly silent in
regard to the suppression, by the President, of
the most important portions of the Report of
the Secretery of War. Beyond a vague re
mark in the Washington dispatch to the As
sociated Press, the censor let nothing reach
the Western papers, except a brief remark
which vas allowed to he sent to pro-slavery
sheets like the Chicago Times and St. Louis Rt
puUlcan,which barely stated that the Report, as
read to Congress, differed from that published
in the New York papers. The special, dis
pat eh for tliis paper describing the extent of
the modification and the cause of it, was sup-1
pressed by the censor of the Government.
Yesterday wc got a pretty clear idea of the
nature of the fiasco, but concluded to say
nothing about the matter until all the tacts ar
rived by dne course of mail, And we now
proceed to give the public what information
we have been able to gather respecting the dis
agreement between the President and the
Secretary of War, with regard to that portion
of the report which treats of the use to be
made of the slaves of rebels.
The Government censor permitted the fol
lowing special dispatch to he scut over the
wires on Monday night to the pro-slavery Ifaw
York Herald, in which sheet it appeared on
Tuesday—the day the Message was read in
Congress
Washikgtok, Dec. S, 3831-
A great deal of anxiety, mingled with some
astonishment, pervades Washington to-day.
People cannot understand why it is that the
President’s Message, ■which was understood to
have had ail the finishing touches put upon it,
and to he ready for delivery, was not sent into
Congress. Of course, all sorts of rumors and
speculations arc rife as to the cause of this.
Some of the facts connected -with It have got
wind, and their discussion adds to prevailing
excitement. As there is nothing to be gained
by concealment in such matters, and as I am
informed of the state of the case, I propose
to enlighten you thereupon.
First, then, you must know tlmt the closing
portion of Secretary Cameron’s report takes
very definite and decided grounds on the sub
ject of slave property- It goes as far in that
direction as did John Cochrane’s now famous
speech to his regiment, and goes farther than
did Gen. Fremont’s more famous proclamation
in Missouri. When Secretary Cameron en
dorsed the sentiment of Col. Cochrane's ad-
dress, he did so understanding fully its import.
There was no mental reservation in his expres-
sion of approval. The same views, I under
stand, he put forth in an official and clearly
expressed form in the Report winch he had
prepared to he submitted to Congress, and
which was to have accompanied the President 1 &
Message. He there enunciated the policy of
the emancipation of slaves in the rebel States,
of the converting to the use of the National
Government of an property, whether slave or
otherwise, belonging to rebels, of resorting to
eveiy military means to put down the rebel
lion, and even of placing anus in the hands of
negroes for that purpose.
Whether it was that that portion of the Re
port of the Secretary of War embodying these
views was not completed last night when the
Cabinet had settled up everything pertaining
to the Message, or whether more mature con
sideration on the part of the President led
bun to appreciate more clearly the danger of
these extreme views of the Secretary of War,
I cannot with certainty say; but one thing
which I do know is, that it was on account ol
tins Report of Secretary Cameron that the de
livery of the Message* has been delayed. I
believe there are some objections, also, on the
same point, to the Report of the Secretary of
the Navy, and both these documents will
have to* undergo revision and modifica
tion before they are presented. An import
ant Cabinet meeting has been held to-day in
reference to these very exciting matters. The
President seems determined to adhere faith
fully and unswervingly to the line of policy
which he proclaimed in his Inaugural, and oh
which he has since conducted his administra
tion —that is, to put down the rebellion by
using all the national resources, but at the
same time to maintain inviolate the Constitu
tion cud laws of the United States. Between
his polity and that of the Secretary of War
there seems to he a wide gulf One or the
other must yield, and I need not say that it
will not be Mr. Lincoln. He knows his
responsibility to the nation, and will not allow
1 himself to be turned aside from the straight
path of duty by any crotchets or views of
policy that may be entertained by any of his
subordinates.
• The above is the secession Herald account of
i the disagreement between the President and
. Secretary of War. The dispatch which was
u prepared for the N. T. Tribune and was sup
pressed by the censor,'.but forwarded by ma‘d
to that paper, is as follows:
THE SCTTBESSED DISPATCH.
WASHUfoTOK/December 2,1061.
The call of the roll had scarcely ended la
the House, when the temper of the people was
strikingly manifested by their Representatives
hastening without delaying a momentfor Pres
idential or other message, to pass a resolution
emancipating the slaves of rebels within the
military jurisdiction. Before the vote upon
it was recorded, a painful rumor pervaded
the Hall that the President had taken open
issue on this very question with Secretary
Cameron, and had recalled from the Philadel
phia Post Office the undelivered copies of the
War Department Report which the latter had
mailed yesterday for the use of the newspaper
press. The city was filled with rumors of a
breaking up of the Cabinet, and the influence
of the revolution we are passing through, in
attaching men to principles while weakening
their hold on laws and forms, was everywhere
strikingly and most suggestively conspicuous.
The excitement occasioned by this Executive
opposition to the necessities of the war and to
the popular will, to-night sways thchotels and
parlors ofthc city. Thenistory of the difference
between tbc President and the Secretary of
War has at last taken this shape. The Secre
tary presented his Report to Mr. Lincoln on
Saturday. On Sunday afternoon he mailed it to
the principal papers of the North and West,
is customary on the day preceding the
' °f the Message. On Sunday night the
| president, having found time to read it, found
it not in ins heart to agree with the Secretary’s
doctrine of the right and the duty to make a
mditary use 0 f the slaves of rebels
—to ann them if necessary—and in all
ways to use them as we would any
other property of the rebels to suppress this
rebellion. He sent for Mr. Cameron, and re
quired him to suppress this whole portion of
his Report, on the ground that its recommen
dation was premature and Ul-timed. The Sec
retary promptly and resolut ely refused to sup
press a word of it. The discussion between
them was protracted. It ended as it began, the
President insisting upon the altcraUon,and the
Secretary respectfully hut firmly refusing to
change a syllable of his recommendations, a. I
subsequent interview in the afternoon had a !
similar conclusion of debate, but a new and
strange conclusion of Executive will. The
President announced his purpose to strikeout
the entire passage about the emancipation and
arming of the slaves before sending in the Re
port with Ins Message to Congress. Hr. Cam
eron declared he should not recall or suppress
. the document in the hands of Northern and
Western editors, and that the printers were at
liberty to do with his report what they pleased.
Which of the two copies will the people read
and the army prefer?
This corresponds very closely with our pri
vate information from several persons • in
Washington, some of whom give the scene be
tween the President-end the Secretary of War
more graphically and in detail.
The portions of the report which the Presi
dent suppressed are as follows:
u WHAT WILL as IK) WITH IT?’*
It has become a grave question for determi
nation, what shall bo done with the slaves
abandoned by their owners on the advance of
our troops into Southern territory, as in the
Beaufort district of South Carolina. The
whole white population therein is six thous
and, while the number of negroes exceeds
thirty-two thousand. The name which drove
their masters in wild confusion from their
homes, leaves them in undisputed possession
Of the SOiK Shall they, armed by their matter*,
be placed in the fidd to fight against vs, or shall
their labor be eon timiddy employed in reproducing
the means for supporting the armies of rebellion?
The war into which this Government has
been forced by rebellious traitors, is carried
on for the purpose of repossessing the proper
ty violently and treacherously seized upon by
the enemies of the Government, and to re
establish the authority and laws of the United
States In the places where it is opposed or
overthrown by armed insurrection and rebel
lion. Its purpose Is to recover and defend
what is justly its own.
War, even between independent nations, is
made to subdue the enemy, and all that be
longs to that enemy, by occupying the hostile
country, and exercising dominion overall the :
men and things within its territory. This
being true in respect to independent nations
at war with each other, it follows that rebels
who arclrtboringby force of arms to overthrow
a government, justly bring upon themselves
all the consequences of war, and provoke
the destruction merited by the worst of crimes.
That government would be false to national
trust, and would jndly excite the ridicule of ike
civilized world, that would oftstain from the use
.of any efficient means to preserve its own exist
ence, or to overcome a rebellious and traitorous
enemy, by sparing or protecting the property of
those who are waging tear against it.
CONFISCATION OF SLAVES OF REBELS.
The principal wealth and power of the rebel
States is a peculiar species of property, cou
aistlng of the service or labor of African
slaves, or the descendants of Africans, This
property has been variously estimated at the
value of from $700,000,000 to $1,000,000,000.
Why should this property be exempt from the
hazards and consequences of a rebellious war?
It was the boast of the leader of the rebel
lion. while be yet had a seat In the Senate of
the United States, that the Southern States
would be comparatively safe and free from the
burdens of war, if it should be brought on by
the contemplated rebellion, and that boast
was accompanied by the savage threat that
“Northern towns and cities would become
the victims of rapine and military spoil,”
and that “Northern men should smell
Southern gunpowder and feel Southern
steel” No one doubts the disposition of the
rebels to carrythat threat into execution. The
wealth ot Northern towns and cities, the pro
duce of Northern farms. Northern workshops
and manu&ctories, would certainly be seized,
destroyed, or appropriated as military spoil.
No property in the North would be spared
from the hands of the rebels, and their rapine
would be defended under the laws of war.
Wldlc the loyal States tints have all their property
aud possessions at stake, are the insurgetU rebels
to carry on warfare against the Govermnent in
peaceand security to their own property?
Reason and justice and self-preservation for
bid that such should be the policy of this Gov
ernment, but demand, on the contrary, that,
being forced by traitors aud rebels to the ex
tremity of war, aU the rights and powers of
war should be exercised to bring it to a specedy
cud.
Those who make war against the Govern
ment justly forfeit all rights of property,
privilege, or security, derivedfromthe Consti
tution and laws against which they are in
armed rebellion; and as the service of their
slaves constitutes the chief property of the rebds ,
such property shentld sltare the common fate of
war to which they have devoted'the property of
loyal citizens.
ALL THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED.
While it is plain that the slave property of
the South is justly subjected to all the conse
quences of tms rebellious war, and that the
Government would be untrue to its trust in
not employing all the rights and powers of
war to bring it to a speedy close, the details
of the plan for doing so, like all other military
measures, must, in a great degree, be left to
be determined by particular exigencies. The
disposition of otherproperty belonging to the
rebels that becomes subject to our arms is
governed by the circumstances of the case.
The Government has no power to hold slaves,
none to restrain a slave of his liberty nor
to exact his service. It has a rigid, however,
to use the voluntary service of slaves liberated
by war from their rebel masters, like any other
property of the rebels, in whatever mode may
be most efficient for the defence of the Gov
ernment, the prosecution of the war, and the
suppression of the rebellion. It is asekarhj a
right of the Government to arm slaves, when it
may become necessary, as it is to use gun
powder taken from the enemy. Whether it is
expedient to do so is purely a military question.
The right is unquestionable by the laws of war.
The expediency must be determined by cir
cumstances, keeping in view the great object
of overcoming the rebels, rc-establisliing the
laws, and restoring peace to the nation.
It is vain and idle for the Government to
carry on this war, or hope to maintain its ex
istence against rebellious force, without em
ploying ailtJte rights and powers of tear. As lias
been said, the right to deprive the rebels of
their property in slaves and slave labor, is as
clear and absolute, as the right to take forage
from the field, or cotton from the warehouse,
or powder and arms from the magazine. To
leave the enemy in the possession of such
property as forage and cotton and military
stores, and the means of constantly reproduc
ing them, would be madness. It is, therefore,
equal madness to leave them inpcacefulaud secure
possession of slave property more valuable and
efficient to them for war, than forage , cotton
and military stores. ( Suck policy would be na
tional suicide. What to do with that species
of property, is a question that time and cir
cumstance will solve, and need not be antici
pated furtherthan to repeat that they cannot be
add by the Government as stares. It would bo
useless to keep them as prisoners of war; and
self-preservation, the highest duty of a gov
ernment, or of individuals, demands that they
should be disposed of or employed in the mok
effective manner that will tend most speedily to
suppress the insurrection and restore the au
thority of the Government. If it shall be
found that the men who have been held by the
rebels as slaves are capable of bearing arras
and performing efficient military service, it is
the right and may become the duty of the
Government to arm and equip them , and em
ploy their sendees against the rebels , under
proper military regulation, discipline and
command.
But in whatever manner they may be used
by the Government, it is plain that, once libo'-
aled by the rebellions act of their masters,
they should never again 6c restored to bondage .
By the master’s treason and rebellion he for
feits all right to the labor and service of his
slave; and the slave of the rebellious master,
by his service to the Government, becomes
justly entitled to freedom and protection.
The following is the substitute for the above
passages which were erased by the President,
written, it is presumed, by himself. From the
words in the original, “It has become a grave
question for determination what shall be done
with the slaves,” read:
“It is already a grave question what shall
be done by the slaves who are abandoned by
their owners on the advance of our troops into
Southern territory, as at Beaufort District,
In South Carolina. The number left within
our control at that point is very consider
able, and similar cases will probably occur.
What shall be done with them? Can we
afford to send them forward to their masters,
to be by them armed against ns, or used in
introducing supplies to maintain the rebellion ?
Their labor may he useful to us; withheld
from the enemy, it lessens his military resour
ces, and withholding them has no tendency to
induce the horrors of insurrection even in the
rebel communities. They constitute a mili
tary resource, and, being such, that
they should not be turned over to
the enemy, is too plain to discuss.
Why deprive him of supplies by a blockade,
and voluntarily give bim men to produce sup
plies ? The disposition to be made of the slaves
of rebels,after the close of the war, can be safely
left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress.
The representatives of the people wiu. un
questionably secure the loyal slaveholders
cverv right to which they ore entitled under
the Constitution of the country.”

Municipal Elections at the East.
There is no doubt of George Opdyke’s elec
tion to the Mayoralty of New York, but the
aldermen and councilman chosen with him
are as bad as they might be. The aldermen
are, three to one, Democrats, and include such
notorious names as Aldermen Boole, Farley
and 'Walsh. The Council stands 13 Demo
crats and 11 Republicans, and include among
the Republicans C. C. Pinckney, William Or
ton and Abraham Dent; and among the Demo
crats, Morgan Jones, President of this Coun
cil, who will probably continue in that office.
The result ou Mayor pleases the New Yorkers
amazingly. There was a great jollification at
the Republican headquarters, on the evening
of election, and Mr. Opdykc made a speech, in
which he said:
The honor which my fellow citizens have confer
red on me I appreciate very highly. To fill an office
that has been graced and adorned by such men as
DcWitt Clinton and Edward Livingston, and many
other men of high esteem who have filled the same
office, is worthy the ambition of any man. I can
only ear that if onr present Impression should he
realized, and if 1 am to ho induct edinto that office,
whatever powers 1 possess shall be exerted for the
bot interests of the city and Its honor—to lighten
its burdens and to do everything in my power to
meet the expectations of those who have elected
me. *
Massachusetts is now in the period of her
municipal elections, and the first half dozen
cities elected their Mayors last Monday, while
Boston and other half dozen cities elect nest
Monday. The Mayors are all re-elected, thus
far, as follows: —Cambridge, Charles Theodore
Russell; Chelsea, Frank B. Fay; New Bed
ford, Isaac C. Taber; Fall River, Edward P.
Buffinton; Springfield, Stephen C. Bemis;
Lawrence, W. EL P. Wright, vice Barker,
present incumbent.
The contest in Boston is likely to be close,
Ic'wccn Joseph M. Wightman, old Whig-
Democrat and present Mayor, and Edward S.
Tobey, Republican.
ISf'Various opinions are held respecting the
length of the present session* of Congress.
Judge Collnaer, ofVcrmont, who is one of the
shrewdest men In Congress, advises an early
adjournment.... He says: “War is not a busi
ness Congress can engineer. It is properly
exeadtw bvsineaf; and the moment Congress
passe&byond the line of providing for the
W ntsofthc Government, and deciding the
purposes of the. war, to sa jhov it shall be con
ducted, the whole thing will prove a failure."
yy Rhode Island has just sent her eighth
battery to the seat of war. No other State
stands in anything this proportion, as to
artillery; and Rhode Island artillery is con
fessedly famous.
Ol r B WASHINGTON LETTER.
The Opening: Bay of the Session.
Early Appearance of the Negro on the Floor—
dieported Trouble in the Cabinet —/In Admi
ralty Question at Cairo —Mason and Slidell at
Fort Warren.
[From Oar Own Correspondent.]
Washdtgtok, Dec. 4.1861.
Tbc roll of the House was hardly called, the
prayer of the venerable Chaplain (ia which
he appropriately besought blessings for “our
enemies in the midst of our friends,”) was
hardly concluded, when the negro sprang from
his hiding place full armed, like Minerva from
the aching head of Jupiter- Your dispatches
will have already anticipated any notcslmight
make of the progress of business thus iar.
Already it has been demonstrated that the
representatives of the people will discuss, aud
fearlessly, this whole question, and dodge
none of its issues.
Mr. Fenton, of N. Y., then appeared on the
floor and announced, in behalf of a joint com
mittee, that they had waited on the President
and announced that the two Houses of Con
gress were in session, and were ready to re
ceive any communication he might be pleased
to make, and that the President had replied
that he would communicate to them a mes
age in writing to-morrow, at 13 o’clock. Con
siderable surprise was manifested at this de
lay, which was heightened towards evening by
a statement in the Star , that a dispatch had
been sent to New York recullingall the Reports
of the Departments. At the present writing
(6 p/m.) the rumor prevails that there is a se
rious, if not fatal, disagreement in the Cabinet
on the slavery question—Messrs. Cameron
and Chase advocating emancipation or confis
cation throughout the rebel States, while the
President, together with Messrs. Smith aud
Bates, take reactionary ground. The position
of Messrs. Seward, Blair and Welles ia not
fixed by these rumors. It ia useless to specu
late on these things. But all will come to the
people in time.
D. L. Phillips, Esq., U. S. Marshal for the
Southern District of Illinois, Is here to get a
decision on the questions arising from the
seizure of rebel property at and near Cairo.
It seems that the officers and men of the gun
boats claim prize money or salvage or what
not on all steamers, cargoes or other property
which they capture, according to maritime
usage. Mr. Phillips does not understand
these rules to apply to the Western rivers,and
he is not prepared to give up the property
without special instructions from the proper
departments.
XT. S. Marshal Murray, of New York, arrived
here this morning from Fort Warren, where
he left Mason aud Slidell as well as could be
expected*, that is, quite poorly. He says that
they are both thoroughly broken down by
their captivity. Everything was done, that
could be done consistently, for their comfort,
but they have both grown old Tery fist since
they stepped on board the San Jacinto. It
was proposed in New York to take them by
railroad to Boston, on acconnt of the tem
pestnous weather. Against this they both
protested in the strongest terms. They would
be happy to buffet the worst storm that ever
howled around Cape Cod, rather than en
counter the “Abolition mobs ” of Connecti
cut and Massachusetts. Slidell, who had not
spoken to Capl. Wilkes since the day he left
the Trent, now found his tongue, and argued
with great volubility in favor of going by sea.

Tlic Tnmnfß but expresses the universal
sentiment of those who have left home and I
everything to light for their country in this the I
hour of her utmost need, when it boldly and i
cogently insists that It is the duty of the Gov
ernment to strike at the vitals of this accursed
rebellion. Here, in Kentucky, we have en
dured the heat of the summer’s sun, and now
feel the winter’s cold—we hare breathed for
months the malaria of these God-forsaken, se
cession, cursed swamps. TVe expect and arc
willing tq,bear all these, to lay down our lives
when necessary, to sustain our common coun
try. But we do feel to complain of, and even
dare to be disgusted with, the powers that be,
because we see, day by day, the results of the
milk-and-water, shilly-shallying policy pur
sued toward rebels who are raising unholy
hands against the most beneficent institutions
the world has ever seen.
Here, in Ballard county, Kentucky, where
at the election, when the question was pre
sented, were cast but two votes for the Union
—where the people are rampant for secession,
and have given and arc now giving freely their
whole substance to sustain the army at Co
lumbus—the Government is protecting and
feeding the rebels, and evenholding and catch
ing their traveling chattels; permitting those
who pretend to be Union men (but who arc
really friends of the rebel owner) to mouse
through our camp after some poor negro, who
only left the day before he was to be taken to
Columbus to labor on tbe entrenchments and,
if need be, to fight for the rebel cause. Aye,
doing more; issuing orders tons in obedience
to the commands of the great military lumi
nary at St. Louis, to drive outside our lines
the chattels of rebels when they come to us—
as they always do when they come at all—
with valuable information, and only because
they do not wish to be shipped South.
Let me submit a few facts. Since the battle
of Belmont, the rebels have been Cir more ac
tive than usual at Columbus. They arc mak
ing superhuman exertions to make that place
impregnable. Slaves are being sent there in
large numbers, to dig their ditches and build
their embankments. A few days since, two
slaves came into camp, because they had
found out that they were to be sent to Colum
bus, where their masters arc, with rebellious
arms in their hands. The simple-minded crea
tures say, in substance : "We don’t want to
fight at all; we don’t want to leave our old
wives; but if we must fight, we would rather
fight for “de ITotf." Now we are ordered to
turn these men out of camp. Of course their
master’s hounds are prowling near by, and the
negroes arc seized and taken to Columbus to
plant batteries that shall cut down our brave
men by hundreds, perhaps. “ But fugitives
sometimes give valuable information to the enemyP ’
Ah! most wise Commander of the De
partment of the Missouri.
Fora month there has been in this fort a
fugitive owned by a captain in the rebel army.
This fugitive baa given us information proved |
to have bcen reliable and most invaluable. He |
knows our entire force, the number and situa- 1
lion of our guns, our arms, defences, every- i
thing. He is at work for the Government for
his food and clothes. Shall he be sent to
Columbus with all this information to dis
close it, and to work and fight against us ? If
he goes beyond our lines ho goes to the army
of the rebels; for the slave, as our armies ad
vance, has no middle position. If we do not
make use of him for ourselves, he is made use
of against us.
Cases like the above are happening and are
to happen daily, until the Government awakes
and asserts the first law of nature—self
defence. Shall I not use all the means nature
has given me to overpower the villain who is
using all fiispeneers to throttle me, I trust the
press will continue to urge
upon the Government its duty in this behalf.
Our rulers must ultimately listen to the
united voices of the press and the people.
Captain Delano’s Quincy (III.) Cavalry made
a reconnoissance towards* Columbus to-day,
and came in contact with the scouts of the
enemy at EUlcott’s Mills, about half way to
Columbus. The rebels ran, and having a good
start, they escaped.
The rebel gunboats that payed us a visit on
Sunday afternoon do not amount to much.
One (the Calhoun) is quite small and Ihrht, and
has no large guns. One of the othersls noth
ing hut the bull of on old steamboat, with a
few guns mounted upon deck- They evident
ly preferred to keep their distance. If they
come again, as doubtless they will, it will pro
bably be when the telegraph operator is away
and bur gunboats are up the river, as iu this
case. Soldier.

LomsviLix, Dec. 4,1861.
Private advices from Columbia and Somer
set indicate that the marauding expedition of
Gen. Zollieoffor has assumed formidable pro
portions and a threatening aspect. Ho is
reported at the head of 8,000 men marching on
Somerset from Montioello, at the latter of
which places reliable information of a day or
two ago had placed him. His force is repre
sented to be the Second Brigade of Tennessee
ans and Mississippians, who marched up. the
hill at Camp Wild Cat, and hastily marched
back again. This, not unlikely, he may find
another Wild Cat' Camp in this new road of
his choice.
The road to Somerset crosses the Cumber
land river about eight miles south of Somerset.
Four miles down the river from the road is
the mouth of a stream of considerable dimen
sions, not fordable, called Fishing creek.
Above the road, some three miles distant,
another and n similar stream empties into the
river. Both of these streams run south to the
river and brace* necessitate the crossing of
the Cumberland at some poiat between
the mouths of the two, or the crossing of two
streams. It Is plain that Gen. Zollicoffer will
have to attempt to cross at the usual crosslog
at this point, that is by the road bridge or
ford. To this point of the crossing of the
Cumberland, Col. Hoskins, who was encamped
farther north on Fishing creek, is understood
tohave marched with bis incomplete regtment,
determined if possible to - oppose the crossing
Of the river, and because of failure to fallback
: oo the troops at Stanford. No reinforcements
have been tendered him, and it is said he has
been ordered to fall back, though it is doubtful
whether any orders have been given at all.
These arc the facts stated by private
letters, and letters from individuals
to the Department indicate that the
people are in great dread of the column
approaching. If is quite evident, however,
that Zollkoffer la only in search of a country
where subsistence can be obtained and perhaps
winter quarters may be found. He can hope
to accomplish nothing of importance with the
small force under Ms command, and is very
likely to content himself with tne accumula
tion of a considerable amount of hog and
hominy, and the securing of a safe retreat.
Gen. ZoUicoffor has much to encourage him,
however,. in a rapid and brilliant forward
movement.. He is opposed by two militia
Generals, one of whom is ignorant of u com
pany drill,” and who, as sworn in court, never
had the capacity to learn it while in Mexico;
and the other of whom once asked Gen. Sher
man if the JUinie ball turned after leaving the
Mbiie musket. Any General could make a
march from Montlccllo to Lexington before
such Generals could fix up a plan to oppose
him.
Wc haven’t anything to boast of in the way
of Kentucky Brigadiers. It would puzzle the
wits of many to command, or drill a regiment,
and it is for Mr. Lincoln to say for wnat sol
dierly qualifications they were appointed.
A letter is published in this morning’s Dem
ocrat, giving the rumor of the march of Zolli
cofier on Somerset, and stating that Zollicoffer
had scut word to Hoskins to leave, as he did
not intend to harm Mm and his little band,
but desired to have his way open and unob
structed. When I knew the General in Nash
ville, it was proverbial that he was an excecd
ingly proud and polite gentleman; but I never j
supposed he was so decidedly polite as tMa
notice would indicate, nor so proud as not to
take an undue advantage of anybody he could.
The latter is certainly a trait by no means
common to Confederate Generals, nor general
throughout the land of bowie and rifle.
Gen. Breckinridge has grown to be übiqui
tous. He is reported, by late arrivals from
Calhoun, to be again in Bowling Green, while
letters state that he is at Rochester, in Butler
county. The Louisville Courier , of the 26th
November, says he is at Russellville, yellow
with jaundice.
A small boat, called the Pink Tarblc, lately
went up the Cumberland river with a lot of
machinery for McMinnville, Tennessee,
which had been permitted by the Secretary of
the Treasury. The captain and owner of the
boat was a good rebel, and fancied that there
fore his rebel friends would allow him to re
turn. On the contrary, they seized his boat
and himself—at least, he has not been able to
return, and the above story is told here.
Col. Starkweather, of the Ist Regiment Wis
consin .volunteers, has been presented with a
handsome sword, by bis regimental officers.
Tbe 16th and 18th regiments, of the regular
service, arrived here last night. The 10th and
loth Ohio volunteers arc due in a day or two.
Mr. Geo. D. Prentice is not the only Ken
tucky institution engaged in attempting to ef
fect the release of reticle confined iu Fort War
ren. The Kentucky Legislature appears dis
posed to take a hand in the matter. Mr.
Burns, the only secessionist I have been able
to discover in the House, has been olfering a
resolution requesting the Govcrnorto demand
of the President the immediate delivery of
Messrs. Morehcad, Barr and Dorset, lately ar
rested in this city, into the custody of the
United Stales Court for the District of Ken
tucky, that charges may be preferred against
the laws of the United‘States, and that they
may have a speedy and impartial trial, as pre
scribed by the Constitution of the State of Ken
tucky.
The demand on the President by the Gov
ernor, if ever made, it is to be hoped may meet
with silent contempt. It ia rather a strange
anomaly that G-D, Prentice should be engaged
hand in hand with the rebel Executive of Ken
tucky and the only rebel member of the Legis
lature, in trying to effect the release of per
sons known to he traitors at heart.
The Legislature is hauling the Milltaiy
Board over the coals. Resolutions of minute
inquiry have been offered before the Senate and
House, and Adjutant Filmed and Quarter
master Darley will have to render a strict ac
count of themselves and of the money they
have expended. The Board has given consid
erable dissatisfaction to the regiments they
have been called upon to consolidate, but I do
not know but this is to its credit. The patri
otism of many of the Kentucky would-be offi
cers has been pretty thoroughly tested by the
I decisions of the Board. There appears to be a
surplus of officers, and iu consolidating the
regiments, the heads of Colonels and Captains
indiscriminately fall to the ground, at which a
great hue and cry is set np by the decapitated
ones. One Colonel of cavalry, who had re
cruited eight companies, being compelled in
consolidating to run the risk of a contested
election, appealed from the Military Board, to
the Legislature. Pending the consideration of
his petition, he was elected Colonel of the con
solidated regiment.
A joint session was held yesterdav, to go in
;o an election of United‘States Senator, al
though the third was set for the election.

Camp Illinois. Washington, D. C.. Dec. 3.
Editors Chicago Tribune:
Y on will confer a favor on a large number of
your friends by correcting a statement pub
lished in one o*f the Chicago papers, in refer
ence to one of the membera of Co. A iu Farns-
worth’s Cavalry Regiment being canght
asleep on ids post. Some “ officer,” whose
name was not given, in a private letter to a
Chicago paper, tries hard to rub olf the tar
nish from the reputation of the regiment, on
account of a member of Co. A being fonnd
asleep on his post.
The “officer” could not have taken the
pains to inform himself correctly, since none
of the members of Company A bare as yet
failed to perform their duty.
The unfortunate young man, or rather boy,
mentiouedby the “officer” was a member of
Company A, and up to the present time has
not been tried. He is at present underproper
care, and awaits his trial with a degree ofman
lim-ss well becoming his extreme youth.
What his fate may be no one here at present
can tell, but there is certainly every reason
for the exercise of leniency towards’him, on
account of his youth, the ‘deprivation of his
accustomed rest, and a more thorough knowl
edge of his duty. I wish to state here, that
the “officer” either wilfully or inadvertently
misrepresented tbe whole of the facts in the
case. Yours respectfully, S. K. Crawford.
The following is from the same camp and
command, and will interest the many frieuds
of the regiment in this section:
Camp Illinois, Wasiokoton, Dec. 3,1861.
To-day, Dec. 2, four hundred blankets for
our regiment were obtainedfrom Government.
When more than twice that number have been
secured, our twelve hundred men will have
each only one blanket. And then we will not
have half enough to keep us all warm. These
facts indicate “why I proposed, and why the
Colonel warmly supports, the project of ap
pealing to the friends of each company to do
nate blankets, quilts and the like, to be pack
ed at places central and convenient, and
thence Supped to Chicago, to be accompanied
to Washington by the 'Chaplain, so as to in
sure their prompt” and early arrival at camp.
Moreover, single boxes without a traveling
companion arcalways delayed, and very often
lost. Quite a number arc now stretched along
the ronte, we know not where. This will be
obviated entirely.
The friends of each company are expected to
collect for each of the 100 men one of the ar
ticles named. One such article may he mark
ed for any particular soldier, and will he deliver
ed. But it would not be agreeable to have a few
soldiers supplied with many articles, and leave
many soldiers in a company without any sup
ply. _ Other articles are not called for. And
it is impossible to receive miscellaneous pres
ents. Aeccssarv articles of bedding alone are
provided for. Woolen shirts, socks and mit
tens will he carried for any person desiring to
send them.
All bundles must be opened out and packed
in the one large box at each place named be
low. Therefore, mark carefully whatever is
designed for a particular person. All articles
not labelled will bo distributed by the Cap
tains of the companies respectively, to those
in need.
Various families in the State have been ad
vised by letter, that I will have messages for
them. They will please take note of the pla
ces and dates given below, and call on the per
sona named.

to hold a public meeting. On the afternoon

MAKING THE BEBELSPAT THEIR
DEBTS.
Judge Frew’s Decision,
fProm the IscwVork Tribune.}
As a large number of your readers are inter
ested personally, as wcil aa generally, in the
question now before the Cabinet, as to wheth
er they will or will not sustain Provost Judge
Freese, of Alexandria, in his recent decision
touching claims due from disloyal or loyal
citizens, I Lave thought it well to inform you
and them as to its exact condition at the pres
ent time.
The President and every member of the
Cabinet, except Attorney General Bates, arc in
favor of sustaining the action of the Provost
Court, and but for the unfortunate position of
Judge Bates, would have had an orderissued
to tliis effect long since. Judge Bates—unfor
tunately for himself as well as for the whole
country—listened to an ex parte statement
made by the counsel of one of the parties
whose goods had been seized, and thereupon
induced, the Assistant Secretary of War to is
sue the order which led to the subsequent is
sue of the two other orders, whereby the pro
ceeding of the court were stayed in civil cases.
Had Judge Bates waited to have heard the
Other side before taking action, the probabili
ties are that the proceedings of the court
would not have been stayed. Having placed
himself in this position.—unthinkingly, as I
have the charity to believe—he now hesitates
to revise his opinion, or allow others to do so.
He makes it, X understand, a personal matter,
and insists upon it that the other members of
the Cabinet shall not overrule him; but since
hU first opinion was founded on doubtful if not
false statements, made by a secession lawyer,
and at a time when only one side of the ques
tion had been submitted, neither I nor any
other lawyer ofthis city—and I have conversed
with many about it —can see any impropriety
in his making a different decision, now that
all the facts are before him.
TUefaetis, the question uever was a ques
tion of law, and hence ought never to have
been submitted to the Attorney General at all.
It was a question, rather, of military necessi
ty or national policy—a question growing di
rectly out of the rebellion, and never would
have arisen at all but for the rebellion—a ques
tion upon which loyal citizens are arrayed upon
the one side, and rebels to the Government upon
the other—a question which involves cither
the giving or withholding of “aid and com
fort’’ to the enemies of the country, and this,
too, to the extent of near $200,000,000 —a
question, in short, as to whether the Seques
tration Act passed by the so-called Confeder
ate Congress, should be respected, or clfectu
ally annulled.
Ihe court itself (as I understand it,) before
which the question was originally decided, is a
military court, established as a military neces
sity, because of the absence of all other author
ity, and only assumed civil jurisdiction because
ofbeiug in an enemy’s country, where no other
authority could be appealed to by loyal citi
zens. JudgeFreese is amilitary officer,‘holding
the rank,as I understand,of Assistant Adjutant
General in the army. As it originated with
the military authorities, it should have been
left just where it began, and Judge Bates
should not hare had, nor onght he now to
have, any voice in the matter. As a question
of policy, it might very jtroperly have been
brought before the Cabinet; but as a question
of right and propriety, it should have been left
wholly with the Secretary of War or the Com
manding General. I trust this view will still
be taken qf it, and that the Cabinet will refer
the whole subject to the Secretary of War, to
do as he may think proper in the premises.
This will relieve Judge Bates from a direct
condemnation by the Cabinet, and again put
in motion a court from which the country
may expect great good
In this city every loyal citizen commends
the action of Judge Freese. I have talked
with lawyers, judges, Senators, and others,
upon the subject, and have yet to meet with
the first man who condemns the action. One
of your own celebrated lawyers, Mr. Evans,
was here last week unriug the Administration
to sustain the court. The memorial upon the
subject, presented by the Chamber of Com
merce of your own city, was so clear and con
clusive that no one thought the Administra
tion would hesitate a day after receiving it.
Add to this the feet.that the press of the whole
country has unequivocally sustained Judge
Freese’s decision, and none cau but wonder
that the Administration did not sanction it at
once.
It is a growing opinion here that if Judge
Bates continues to oppose his personal quib
bles in a case like Ihis—a case in which your
own merchants are interested to the extent of
over $65,000,000, and the whole country to the
extent of some $300,000.000 —beside the ad
vantages in a military 'point of view to be
gained from it—a voice will come up from the
whole country that he be removed, and that
some better man be put in his place.
From the best information that I can gather
at present, I think the court will be sustained
—probably in the way above indicated —name-
ly, by referring the whole matter to the Secre
tary of War, on the ground that it is a mili
tary and not a legal question.
I have not the honor of knowing Judge
Freese personally, but certainly a more just
decision never emanated from any man than
that given by him, and the voice of the whole
country is, and will continue to be, that he
must be sustained.
Arrest of a Sel>ol Spy*
[Washing Cor. (21th) Xew York World.]
A rebel spy was captured yesterday about
seven miles* below Alexandria. He reports,
that be has been in the habit of visiting our
lines ns often as three times a week," carrying
messages ami papers and important informa
tion to the rebels. He crossed the Oecoquan
river in a small boat, sinking it on this side,
and at night eluding the vigilance of our pick
ets, and made his way to Alexandria, where he
always found the required information, with
all the late papers from New York. The next
evening he would start on his way back, tak
ing the same route, arriving within the rebel
lines on the following morning.
South Carolina Negroes—lmportant
Rebel Correspondence.
Gen. Thomas F. Drayton, commanding the
third (Beaufort) military department of South
Carolina, and who was not killed at Hilton
Head, writes to Gov. Pickens, under date of
Kov. 18th, as follows:
“Sib: At the request of your Excellency,
made to me yesterday at these headquarters, I
have the honor of presenting my views of the
present attitude and behavior of the negroes
in this portion of the State entrusted to my
immediate command. So far from there being
any insurrectionary feeling among them, lean
assure your Excellency that I have neither seen
nor heard of any act o'f pillaging, incendiarism
or violence in auy direction.
“It is true that the negroes of a few planta
tions have shown a spirit of insubordination,
by refusing to move higher up the country,
when ordered to do so by their owners, but
this disobedience should be assigned rather to
a feeling of dismay and utter helplessness at
being left alone and unprotected by the pre
cipitate abandonment by their masters of their
plantations, than from any organized plan of
resistance to the authority they had been ac
customed to obey. But X now feel much
satisfaction- In staling for the information of
your Excellency, that the negroes arc fast re
covering from their fright, and coming forth
from their hiding-places, and quietly and sub
missively resuming their agricultural labors,
without the guidance or presence, in many in
stances, of either master or overseer.
“ In conclusion, I would respectfully advise
that all planters and overseers, who are not
mustered into service, and arc owners or
agents of property upon the mainland, should,
without delay, return to their several neigh
borhoods, and thus, by their presence, pre
vent a recurrence of that excitement among
their people which has been due in a grea!
measure to their absence. ”
Zollicoffer’s Second Advance.
[Correspondence Cincinnati Commercial.
Before his first advance into Kentucky, Zol
licofferhad strongly fortified Cumberland Gap,
and, on falling back to that point, other de
fences were atlded. At this time the Gap is
fortified in such a manner as to command the
approach from any quarter, north or south.
With the Gap in ‘this condition, and in the
hands of a strong garrison, Zollicoffer his
been enabled to advance again into Kentucky,
and has done so by the Wifiiamsburgaud Mou
ticello route, threatening Col. Hoskins, on
Fishing Creek, Pulaski, and, indeed, according
to one report, coming up with him on the
banks of that stream, and indulging in a skir
mish iu considerable force. Tins “report has
grown old without corroboration, however,
and Is not believed. It is known here also
that large bodies have been thrown out to
wards Glasgow, Edmonton and Borkesvillc,
thus establishing a line ou the right of Buck

McCook. Tnese movements have been lately
made, in view of the rapid movements of our
troops and the warning indications of an ad

Sutlers continue to thrive, and some of them are
rapidly enriching themselves at the expense of
those forced to purchase of them whatever thev
desire in addition to Uncle Sam's hard fare. Quite
a number of officers have resigned their commis
sions to engage in sutlershlps, which arc often

more in need of com than cotton, and France
having found it necessary to curtail her army
and expenses—he closed by saying:
We have scaled 5.600 miles of coast: we have
shut the breathing boles; and now we are patting
in the red hot torch of war at the upper end. andin
a short time 1 think rebellion will be unearthed.
God has poured money in onrland; God has taken
away cotton from England, and He holds Prance in
His right hand. Sweep round the ring. Standoff,
spectators. Now let this gigantic universe under
stand that it is liberty and God, slavery and the
devil. Ko man put hand or fool into that ring till
they have taken cattle unto death. Amen. Even
so. Lord God Almighty, it is Thy decree, it is Thy
purpose: and when the victory shall come, not
unto ns. not unto ns, bnt in the voice of Christ,
ten thousand ransomed ones mingle with all Thy
children's gladness. Unto Thee be the praise and
the glory forever. Amen.

•—Of the Boston boot and shoe market, the
Exporter says the manufacturers pf heavv boots
are now busily at work filling orders from the
New York dealers and from sutlers for double
sole and half donble sole grain boots. The
demand for army shoes and sewed cavalry
boots has lessened considerably during the
past two weeks. The prices of stock show
■ rather d receding tendency, and manufacturers
are cautious about purchasing.. Total-ship
ments ofboots and shoes by rail and sea, for
the week, 12,834 cases.
Breckinridge Backing out A gulp. .
Last week Breckinridge, at the bead of Ms
brigade of rebels, made a threatening advance
through Butler county, Ky., as far north as
Skitervillc, and robbed some of the stores of
Greenville. CoL James S. Jackson’s cavaliy
at once started in' pursuit of them, when
Breckinridge fell backandretumed to Bowling
Green, with colors flying and a large drove of
stolen hogs grunting at their ill usage. Gen.
Thos. L. Crittenden is said to he sorely per*
plexed, aa he was making arrangements to hag
the General and Ms entire force. This is the
third time that Buckner has attempted and
failed to send a force to the Ohio river and
capture “Lincoln’s Hessians” at Henderson
and Owensboro.
jSflt is denied that CoL Kerrigan, of the
25th New York regiment, has been convicted
of treason in court-martial and ordered to be
shot. The information came by special dis
patch to the New York Express —not first-rate
authority—and seems to have had no other
foundation than that Kerrigan is under arrest,
with charges of treason alleged against him
that will probably result in the end as this dis-,
patch prematurely indicated. CoL Kerrigan
made visits to Charleston, last winter, and
was said to have an excellent understanding
with the rebels; and his conduct as Colonel of a
regiment, on the Potomac, has not been such as
to reflect either honor upon onr arms or upon
himself. He has been under arrest now for
some sis "weeks. Kerrigan is a Five Points
bruiser, and was the man who knocked Presi
dent Stryker from the platform of the Syra
cuse Democratic Convention in 1660. This
gave him his first notoriety.
In the "Wheeling Convention, the name
“Kanawha,” proposed to be applied to the
new Stale, was stricken out of the ordinance,
after long discussion, by a vote of 30 to 14.
The majority claimed that the name was dis
tasteful to their constituents, in the northern
part of the new State, and they were under in
structions to change it. The Convention then
voted for a name, as follows:
For *• West Virginia,” 30 votes.
For •• Kanawha,” 9 votes.
For “Allegheny.” 2 votes.
For “ Western Virginia,” 2 votes.
For ** Augusta.” 1 vote.
The first section of the Constitution was
then adopted, as follows:
-Sec 1. The State of West Virginia shall hcand
remain one of the United States of America. The
Constitution of the United States, and the laws
and treaties made in pursuance thereof, shall he
the supreme law of the land.”-
pST* The X. Y. World says that Secretary
Cameron, on his recent visit to Hartford, had
a conversation with Colonel Sam. Colt about
buying his "whole works in the South Meadow,
for Government, and asked the Colonel for
his terms for factory, machinery, grounds and
all. Colonel Colt wished time for considera
tion, and the story is, he has quite recently
sent a letter to Mr. Cameron, offering to sell
his whole concern for five millions of dollars—
everything to be included for this sum except
his own private dwelling and grounds contig
uous.
£gT The Detroit Free Frm says the order
for*‘no more cavalry 11 will probably cause
Col. Rankin’s Regiment of Lancers, encamped
at that city, to he disbanded unless they con
sent to serve In some other way. The regi
ment was to number 1,600 men, and some 600
are now in camp. The Ad art iter, on the
other hand, says the Lancers will not be dis
banded. They promise to become too valu
able an arm of the service to be given np now.
The New York World says that Henry
Ward Beecher preached at General Fremont
slightly, when he attended service at Plymouth
Church last Sunday by invitation of the pastor.
Mr. Beecher did Indeed urge good and upright
conduct on the part of men of influence, but
he doubtless took Ms usual course, and
allowed the coat to fall on any fitting shoul
ders.
A third stone fleet of twenty vessels,
carrying upwards of six thousand tons of
stone, will be ready to sail from New Bedford
in a few days, to be sunk in the outer channel
of Charleston harbor and Stono Inlet. The
first licet was sunk in the “rat holes” of the
North Carolina coast; the second licet at the
entrance of Savannah; and now the third will
seal up Charleston.
Carmel coal has been discovered at
Crab Orchard, Kentucky, by the troops there,
and the inhabitants arc quite astonished at it.
One man said that several years ago he had
dug a well on an adjoining farm, through the
“ same sort of stuff,” but it had never oc
curred to him that it was cauuel coal.
The amount contributed at New York
for the relief of the Union refugees at Hat
tcras Inlet is $9,133, and money still coming
in. President Lincoln has given his approval
of the object in a letter to George Bancroft.
Tiie schooner Elijah Shcddcn is nearly loaded
with supplies.
Gen. Butler is rapidly gettinghU second
expedition ready, to sail from Boston for the
South. The steamship Hliuois has been char
tered to take the next load of troops, and will
sail in a few days.
The Washington correspondent of the
Springfield (Mass.) i&pu&icau writes ;
Mr. Lincoln pays great respect to the opinions
of Mr. Holt in alf tliat lie does in reference to Ken
tucky. A day or two since a Kentucky Republican,
a moderate ami most worthy man. asked a small
favor of 3lr. Lincoln, and was referred to Mr. Jo
seph Holt. “If he gays you ought 10 beattended
to. 1 will do so.** was’the reply of the President.
The man went away somewhat indignant, especxal-
Iv as Mr. Bolt is his old political adversary.
