SLUMP IN WHEAT
SCARED TRADERS.
After the Unusual Experience of
the Past Week, Speculators
Are Nervous and Warv.
REPL'EIJC SPDCIAU
New York. Dec 6. Finding the public a
little weary after Its violent and successful
bull prices of the wetk, professional traders
emerged from their retreats this mcrning to
have another try at undermining the wheat
market sufficiently to promote a general
scare among holders.
An opening bulge that carried 3Iay within
?lc of jesterday's highest point, and was
due more to unexpected foreign bujing in
face of easier cables than to renewed out
side support, made a go:d starting place,
and under the pressure that followed values
sagged off nearly a cent per bushel. A
close watch was kept on corn during the pro
cedure, for the latter has occasionally had
a habit of working independently, but this
morning fell off In proportion and actually
helped the general depression.
Inability to gauge the power of outride
speculation and uncertainty as to when it
may suddenly Cash out again with resist
less force, aro the sole reasons for present
Inactivity of the bear element.
The recent big jump and "excitement In
corn,' coming as an eruption from a sup
posedly extinct volcano, was a lesion that
bears will not forget In some lime. That its
match may be seen in wheat, should that
market slow down a little and become weak,
is a sufficiently live problem to mak all
scalpers wary on the short side. Through
the afternoon wheat acted nervous, with
both sides In the pit sparring for points and
outsiders holding the balance of tower. The
market closed rather firm on a late demand
from shorts Uc net advance.
Corn and oats, which were also fever:--!!
throughout the afternoon, vere quiet, but
rallied at the close, corn dosing li9 ad
vance net.

RETUBUC FPECIAU
Chicago. 11L, Dec 6 The excitli-g events
of yesterday on 'change brought great
troops of v iltor" to the Itonrd of Trade to
day, but there was no repetition of the tre
mendous operations of cstcrdav.
It had been advertised that Friday would
probably witness a slaughter of the inno
cents a shake-out of the widely scattered
holdings of outsiders In the speculative mar
kets. On this line there was a lot of pro
fessional selling in all grain pits, wheat,
corn and oats.
Prices jielded only moderately. Early
seller, failing to get the break they ex
pected, had to turn about and replace their
lines. Good recovery quickly fo'Iowed.
What action there was In prices was not
such as to have much Interest except for
those financially Interested.

PHILIPPINES TARIFF CAUSES
REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
Washington, Dec C Speaker Henderson
announced the Ways and Means Commit
tee to-day at a six-minute session of the
House, and the Republican members at
once proceeded to get to work on a Philip

created by the decision of the court. He
thought the bill would b" ready next week
and would re-establish the old rates.
House and hcnnlc Clnsh.
In connection with the Philippine tariff, a
clash has rome between the Senate and ths
House. The members of the V.as and
Means Committee resent the introduction
of the Lodge bill in the Senate and insist
that It robs the House of its constitutioml
prerogative of negotiating alt legislation
raising revenue for the Government.
Chairman Payne was aTned to-night If he
would accept the Lodge bill and introduce
It In the Houe.
"I shall not," he replied. "We shall have
a bill of our own."
There is eminent precedent for returning
Senate bills raising revenue without action
by the House, and should the Lodge bill
come over this would be done.
A leading member of the House said the
probable outcome would be that the House
bill would go over to the Senate, where the
Lodge bill would ba allowed to quietly drop
out of existence.
The Speaker nli announced the Commit

sopraro, tne to carrj out her contract to
sing at a "musical ' planned bv 3Irs. Claude
Kllpatnck for ntxt Wednesday e.imnc.
Whfther an Injunction Milt or an action
for damages will he begun will depend on
the attitude of Maurice Grau. Mme. Schu-marn-Heink's
impresa-io. wl'.f-n 3!r. Allen
shall have brought tne Unicn Musical Club's
claiirs to his attention.
In the meantime 3ir-. Kllpatnck, who U
herself a member of th club, is so much
troubled over the unhappy turn of affairs
that she has been urable to receive Jier
fnenJs for evoral di3, and. it Is said, may
have to postpone hr mus.cal. Simultane
ously, this other members of the cljb are
as on woman in averting that they have
not the least desire to interfere with Mrs.
Kilrnirlck's musical, to which many of them
v.-re invited.
Contrast ppnL Out Plainly.
The Urion MuMcal Clnb has a contract
with ilaurice Grau for a rccitil by Mm".
Schuniann-Hc-ink on January 27 In the ar
ticles of agreement is a clause providing
that rr.adame shall not sing at any other
recital or concert in fet. Louis. It is this
clause which, the club asserts, has lyen
10Iat-d in the agreement for 3Im Schu-rcar.n-Heink
shall sing at 3Ir-. Kilpatrlck's
lioust. The club's Board of Directors es
terday morning agr d to rlace the matter
in 3Ir. Allen's hand'.
"The legal rights of Urn club hinge on
the interpretation of the word 'recital.'"
said Mr. Allen Ian night. 'The affair at
Mrs. Kilpatrlck's is called a 'musfcale.' 1
believe. All the same, according to the b-st
authcnti-s 1 can lind. it is really a recital,
f.n though given at a privaf hoiisv.
"The right of the club to enjoin Mme.
Sciiumann-Heink's apptarance at this re
cital is unquestionable. The club could not
compel h;r to sing, even under its contract,
if she should refuse to ting. But the agree
ment of her as"nt. 31r. Grau, that she
should not sing an where ele in St. Louis
than b"tore the club, is a 'negative cove
nant.' which ctrtainly can te en.orced.
"The damage th- club vvou.d sustain
through tire appearance of the great singer
at sonf other recital than its ov. n would be
mucn greater than the loss In ticket sales
for that particular concert. Mmeil Schu-n.arn-Heink
U really the feature of the
j ear. and her name has done much toward
attracting the attcntidn of inline lovers to
the work of the club. Tte promise of her I
exclu-lve appearance under its auspices
would undoubtedly add largely to the num
ber of season subscribers to the club's
concfrts and recitals.
"Two thousand dollars would rot be an
"tcc-lve estimate of the club's loss if Mme.
Schumann-Heink should fail to keep the
contract. The club is not .1 monej -making
organization, but one that is trj ing to cui
ti.ate a high appreciation for the best
mu-ic and spends much in pursuit of this
purpose.
"Just what will be done I am not pre
pared to -ay. After I have consulted fur
ther with Mrs. Philip N. 3Ioore, who made
the contract on behalf of the club, and
other members of the Board of Director", I
will understand better just what the club
wishes me to do. I have already explained
to them what their rights are, and have in
dicated what course cou.d bo pursued."
