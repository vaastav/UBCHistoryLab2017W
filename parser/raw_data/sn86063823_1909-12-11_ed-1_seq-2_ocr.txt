You have Just two weeks In which
to make yoirr Christmas purchases.
President Taft Joes not want a con
gressional Investigation into the acts
of the sugar trust and said so in his
message to congress. Is he afraid
that the stealing will be found to be
larger La an announced?
The tut of the new court house11 and
Jail on the first page of today's Issue
of the Record shows that the building
will be a credit to the county. Inci
dentally It Is the first view shown of
the proposed building.
If the population and business of
the country could only grow at the
same a ate as the expenditures there
might be eonie excuse for the manner
of spending money indulged in by re
publican administrations, but they do
not.
Secretary Nathan Jaffa has Issued
a dealal that he will leave the office
of oecrefary to become engaged In
bankinj; business. The runior which
called forth the denial had him about
to become Interested in Cie First Na
tional Bank of Albuquerque.
On the eleventh of next monvh the
people of Dayton will vote on the is
suance of bonds to the amount of fif
teen thousand dollars for the con
surucuon of a water works plant. As
Dayton has always shown a progres
sive spirit there is little doubt that
the Issue will go through easily.
Secretary MacYeagh, la a public
address in Boston, declared that ths
Payne tariff bill was but a step to
wards the proper revision of the tar
iff, but we notice that in his message
"to congress President Taft embodied
a plea for a rest on tariff agitation.
Evidently there Is a difference of op
inion between the secretary aad the
'resident regarding th tariff bill.
GOV. HANLY ON WHISKY.
Governor Hauly of Indiana has told
a few truths aboirt whiskey. He goes
straiehi to the point. Here is what
he said:
"Personally I have seen so much of
the evils of the traffic In the last four
years. o much of Its econoailc waste,
fto mi'Ch of Its physical ruin, so much
of Its tears and heartache, that I
have come to regard the business as
one that must be held and controlled
by strong and effective laws.
I bear no malice toward those en
gaged In the business, but I hate the
traffic.
I hare Its every phase.
I hate It for Its Intolerance.
I bate It for Its arrogance.
I hate H for l a hypocricy.
I hate it for Us cant and craft and
false pretenses.
I hate It for Its commercialism.
I hate It for its greed and avarice.
I hato It fur Its sordid love of gain
at any price.
I hate it for its domination In poll
tics. .
I hate it for Its corrupting Influ
ences In civic affairs.
I hate It for its Incessant effort to
debadch the suffrage of the country
for the cowards it makes of public
enen.
I hate It for Its utter disregard for
law.
I hate H for Us ruthless trampling
of the solemn compacts of state con
stitutions.
I hate It for the load It straps to
labor's back: for the palsied hands it
gives to toll: for Its wounds to gen
ius; for the tragedies of Its niight-
nave beens.
I hate it for the human wrecks it
. has caused.
I hate it for the almshouses It peo
ples: for the prisons it fills; for the
insanity It begets; for Its countless
graves in potters fields.
I hat it for the mental ruin It Im
poses upon Its victims; for Its spirit
ual blight: for its moral degradation.
I bate tt for the crimes it has com
mitted.
I hate It for the homes It has de
stroyed. I hate It for the hearts its has brok
en. I ha'e It for the maWce it has plant
ed in the hearts of cflea: for its poi
son, for Its bitterness, for the dead
ea frul: with which it starves their
souls.
1 hate it tor the grief tt causes wo
man hood the scalding tears, the
hopes deferred, the strangled aspira
tions, It burden of want aad care.
I hate It for its heartless cruelty
to the aged, the infirm and helpless;
for the shadow It throws upon the Uv
ea of children; for Its monstrous in
justice to hlamelees little ones.
I hate It as virtue hates vice, as
truth hates error, .as righteousness
hates eta. as Justice hates wrong, as
liberty hates tyranny as freedom hat
es oppression.
I hate K as Abraham Lincoln hated
slavery, and as he socnethnea saw In
.nt.Atio nrfstam th And of slaverv
and the coming of the time when the
son rbould shine and the rain anouia
fall upon no slave In all the republic.

$5,000,000.00 IN ONE YEAR.
f 5,000,000.00 is a vast sum of money, and if we were to
tell you that an institution located in the Pecos Valley will do
this amount of business in one year, you would look askance at
us and give us a cynical smile. But just listen to what Mr. It. T.
Williams, who is assisting: in the organization of The New Mexico
National Life Insurance Company has to say along this line: "I
have been oftentimes asked since we commenced the organization
ofThe New Mexico National Life 'How much business do you
think you can write during the first yettr of your existance?' and I
have always answered the question by saying: 'That, of course,
depends upon the determination and zeal of the management and
the efficiency 01 the agency force; but I see no reason why we can
not write at least $ 3,000,000.00 of paid for business during the
first twelve months of our existance.'
"I now have every reason to believe that The New Mexico
National Life will put $5,000,000.00 of paid for business on its
books during the first year of its operation. It was on September
lGth that we received our Certificate of Incorporation from Hon.
Nathan Jaffa, Secretary of the Territory, and it was the latter
part of that month that we began soliciting subscriptions to the
capital stock. Since that lime, with only three active agents in
the field, we have succeeded in placing; $150,000.00 of the stock with
about aoo representative citizens of the territory. When the entire
amount of the capital stock, including the surplus, $400,000.00 is
sold, we hope to have at least 500 stockholders, each of whom will
be an integral part of this great institution. They will be scat
tered throughout New Mexico, Arizona and Wst Texas. It takes
no stretch of the imagination to ieceive the influence that such
an segregation of active, aggressive citizens will wijld for an en
terprise in which each one is vitally interested. I am not appeal
ing to the credulous when I say that an average of $10,000.00
insurance will result from the influence of each of these 500 stock
holders within twelve months after the company begins an earnest
and vigorous campaign for business.
"What would be the income of $5,000,000.00 insurance?
Ask any insurance agent what the average premium is estimated
at and he will tell you $40.00 a thousand Then $1,000,000.00
insurance would mean $40,000.00 and $5,000,000.00 would mean
$200,000.00 premium income. Besides, there are other sources of
profit to the company aside from the premium income.
"When we came to RosweU last July, we came determined
to organize The New Mexico National Lifo, and while our company
has met with some obstacles, minor ones, however, I am
more than gratified at the marvelous results we have attained.
And I desire to go on record here and now with the prediction that
In less than five years time every dollar of the capital stock of The
New Mexico National Life will be worth more than five for one. In
face of what a number of recently organized companies have ac
complished, I consider this prediction very conservative, and it will
be so considered by others, who are unprejudiced, having an
knowledge whatever of the value of life insurance stocks.
' 'Is it the intention of the company to demand, like some
other companies, a certain amount of insurance through the influ
ence of an applicant for a loan before the loan will be granted?'
In regard to the loaning of the company's money, I will say it is
presumed that, of course, preference will be given to stockholders
and policy holders, but in no case will the company demand that
an applicant for a loan produce a specified amount of business be
fore the application will be considered. It will not be the policy
of The New Mexico National Life to secure its business in this man
ner. The company will be able to offer a policy to prospective in
surants that will bean inducement within itself, and the $400,000.00
it will have to loan, when the entire amount of stock is placed,
will be available to all persons who are in position to furnish the
security specified by the law of the territory the law by which the
company is governed.
"Yes, the company has placed about all the stock in Roswell
that it cares to place, and after Jan. 1st, no more of the stock will
be offered for sale in this city (except pending business. ) This step
is taken in order to give other towns of this and contiguous terri
tory the opportunity of securing some of the stock and for the
further purpose of extending the influence of the company.
"In regard to the building proposition, 1 will say that the
laws of the territory allow us to invest a part of our capital in a
home office building, which will undoubtedly be done. I have in
vestigated sufficiently to convince myself that a four or five story
office building, modern in every respect, would yield a handsome
dtvidend within itself, and .be the means of enhancing the value of
every foot of real estate in this city, especially that immediately
contiguous to the building.
"Yes, I am thoroughly convinced that The New Mexican
National Life will be a phenomenal success and will be the means
of contributing to the success of every legitimate institution in the
territory, and I consider that person very short-sighted indeed, or
else guided by an envious and selfish motive, who is unable to real
ize what an enter prise of this character means toward the progress
and development of this country."
"Keep New Mexico Money in New Mexico."
