THE NEWS,
The military situation is not changed in
any important respect since our last issue.
The Incoherent babble of tbc rebel dispatches
Is far from being conclusive as to Sherman’s
position and condition, and only proves the
existence of a great internal commotion in
Dixie, and teeming dangers to our army
which Us leader did not forget in his prepara
tions. The war in Virginia presents no new
phase in the dispatches, though wc
have advices through private channels of a
movement of troops through Washington
from the Shenandoah to strengthen Grant,
and a pretty little ofiklr of Gen. Merritt’s to.
wardsthe Bine Ridge. There are great moves
on the board, and tbe existing mystery In mil
itary matters cannot long be maintained.
Our advices from Nashville arc importantand
Interesting; but there, as in other theaters
of the war, the crisis is postponed, though
rumors were rife yesterday in the city,
claimed to be on tbc strength of private dis
patches, that a great battle was in progress
yesterday at Nashville. It lacks confirma
• mation, though by no means improbable.
The Postmaster General’s report Is a com
prehensive document, containing numerous
statistics of interest to tbe reader. The
I'osta! revenues for tbe year ending on the
30th June last, were $12,435,253,73, and the
exiKindlturcs of this Department during the
same period were $12,0-14.780.20, showing an
excess of tbe latter of $236,532.42. General
Grant expresses himself well satisfied with
tbe working of the Post Office arrangements
in the various armies. • - -

vessels under construction on the Ist of Do.

sion Bureau.
TUB PBESIDENDS MESSAGE.
The President’s Message, in point of style
is a terse, condensed, and well-written docu
ment, the most unexceptionable, perhaps,
which has ever come from his pen. In mat
ter it is comprehensive, and brings forcibly in
review before us the multiplicity of the intcr
cstsand magnitude of the questions which
-claim attention and decision from the Chief
Magistrate of this mighty republican empire
while engaged in one of the world’s gicat
historic wars. In tone, it is erect and digni
fied, positive and firm, especially in its attl
lude towards the rebellion and the “ insurgent
lender.” The endorsement received by Mr.
Lincoln at the polls, has nerved and braced
him up for the great work before him. Tho
hand at tho helm, if it ever wavered, is now
confident. The Executive will, slowly form,
iug and hardening, now asserts in adaman
tine words the determination of tbc Ameri
can people to presen e their national integrity
at every hazard.
A salient poiut In ths Message is its em
phatic statement to Congress of the necessity
of curtailing the constantly increasing clr.
citation of the State banks, whereby a
larger loan is made to them than to tbs
Government, and the currency is more
depreciated by them than by tho greenbacks*
We have dwelt so iavetcrately on this
topic that our readers are already familiar
with our settled conviction. The present
Congress will, probably, confer no such dis
tinguished honor upon iiselt or service upon
the country as to adopt the President’s re
commendation. He might however have
plied them with the same argument as he
uses In reference to the constitutional amend
ment ; “As it is sure to pass sooner or later
they might as well pass it first as last.” We
believe that the next Congress will adopt the
mmetire necessary to complete and harmonize
Secretary Chase’s Banking System by sup
pressing* the rival circulation of the State
banks, which now depreciates our currency.
Wc shall then he the strongest government,,
financially, in the world.
The nation’s terms of peace to the rebels
are tersely expressed by the President, in
toms with which no Northern man, who Is
cot a disunionist, could find fault. “ They can
at any time have peace simply by layingdown
their anus and submitting to the national an
thori’y under the constitution.” Who could
ask for more? At the same time Qje Presi
dent announces hie determination to retract
nothing heretofore done relative to slavery.
Wc agiee with him in secingno inconsistency
In these terms. "What has been done Is
wholly right and constitutional. In submit
ting to the constitution they submit to It.
The President is ominously, and
loudly silent up (in the war now
being waged by British pirates upon our com
merce. This is well. It !s better not to
speak until wc are ready to act. Then, let it
be a word and a blow, and let the blow come
first. France Unot mentioned in the docu
■mat, but it opens with a shrulficant intima
tion that the position of Maximlllian is that
of one of the chieftains in an intestine war,
and that our Government will preserve Ur
neutrality bclmtn llu.' bcUigereiti* for the pres
ent.
His recommendation to Congress to end
the slavery question forever, by the constitu
tional amendment abolishing it legally in all
the Slates, is, however, though fully expect
ed, the grand feature of this very important
document. This is one of those sublime mea
sures which, layinghold of an eternal truth,
anchors within the veil, and links its movers
forever lo the Throne of God.
Steadily the great revolution for a more
perfect UiHon and a larger liberty moves on.
The President’* Message is worthy of his po
sition as the chosen commander of the hosts
who are contending for Freedom and Nation
ality. More than this could not be said.
nOSECBIffS,
It will be with regret that the loyal country
Bids adieu lo Rosccrans, once the petted
hero of tile earlier buttles In Tennessee, bn
■whose reputation suffered untimely blight.
Be had a subsequent and indulgent reprieve
of sentence, resulting In. his aimless and
znannderiujt military mismanagement in
Missouri. The sigh of relief uttered by loyal
-men at his now announced removal from the
scene of his latest protracted failure west
'Of the Mississippi, is genuine and irresistible.
It would be ungracious to dwell on
causes of his misadventures and
the country’s through him, hut they
are vcry-largcly of an acquired nature, and
.the banc of military service. Dnquestion-
Ably and zealously loyal, the country had
high hopes of Rosccrans; but its recent most
prominent hope is now happily realized, and
Missouri is to be congratulated His whole
course of mismanagement within that depart
jnent has been glaring, and had not the faults
of ihc leader been largely repaired by Ida
subordinates, Missouri would to-day be, what
she is not likely to become again, an active
theater of war.
THE KEW CHIEF JUSTICE,
TLe appointment and confirmation of Mr.
Chase, yesterday, to the chief place on the
Supreme Bench, will everywhere be -well re
ceived among the fiicnds of loyalty and . lib
erty, and happily settles a vexed question as
to this most important of ail posts, next to
the Chief Executive of the , nation. It was
necessary that the Chief Justice should be a.
sound and ahlolawycr. skilled in the Courts;
Mr, Chase L all that. It was desirable that
Us arduous duties should not be complicated
by the tailing physical powers' of some
one far past the noon of life; Mr.
Chase possesses the splendid prime
of a vigorous manhood. And more
than this it was necessary in the present life
jjtrngglc of the nation, that there should ex
ist no bias In behalf of the waning cause of
ppman Chattel! sm. Since judges are
mortal; and their sympathies tinge their de
cisions, slavery has all too long possessed
this advantage In the Supreme Court. There
is no longer a refuge for the monster at
the feet of' ‘ the Chief Justice of
the United States. Mr, . Chase Is
happily fitted by his antecedents for dc.
ciblous that shall strengthen Liberty and vin
dicate her Irreconcilable quarrel with the
znan-stealcrs. His is no eleventh hour con-
vol. xvm.
version to tbc doctrines tbe events of Ibis
war have brought this nation to sustain. For
thirty years be bos stood as the counsel of
Freedom in our courts and before tbe people,
every where and at all times hostile to tbe
nationalization of Slavery, expressed os well
by bis position in the political movements
of the country os in bis efforts at tbe bar.
Tbe country Is to be congratulated in a choice
which so closely allies him with tbe final end
ing of the present conflict of principles, os
ended It will be for Liberty and Humanity,
tbc Executive, tbe Military and tbe Judiciary
of tbc nation now standing arrayed on tbc
side of Freedom.

(From Onr Own Reporter.)
Nashville, Sunday, December 4—A- LI.
There has been little change in the situation
since I wrote yon last, Tho forces of Gen. Thomas
are concentrated around this dty, and tho whole
rebel army is confronting It Skirmishing oc
curred yesterday and last night, hutno fighting of
consequence resulted. Onr right rests on the
river, below the town, and our loft on It above,
the stream bending In » very convenient form for
a secure defense. Thomas could, nt any moment,
make a successful assault uj>on Hood, but fully
convinced as he is that the foolhardy rebel wiu
attempt the captnrc of this city, he proposes to
await an assault, and, having defeated him, will
then pursue.
In this I hove no doubt that he Is right Hood
will commence the attack. Tnc rebels'arc throw-
Ing up earthworks, and will makes desperate as
sault whenever an advance la ordered; the fearful
slaughter that will follow, and the'eose with which
thiJr ranks will be shattered, will be apparent
when the conflict shall have ended.
General Rousseau was at Murfreesboro when the
communications were cut, at the head of a consid
erable force (thenumber being contraband), and.
the forces in East Tennessee were hastening to
Join his, when he will be enabled to operate in
Hood's rear; and perhaps yoa have heard by tele
graph that Morgan Ig Smith, au energetic fight
ing man. was on his way rrom Vlcksbnrg, intend
ing to strike—well, where he will strike. I must
not be definite. Whether you bare beard of it or
sot, certain it is; he is on the war path, and he
has a large army with him
Some have been led to believe that Hood will
attempt a crossing of the Cumberland, above this
S'cce, pass Nashville by, and move into Kentucky,
at I have so such Idea. If be does not make a
direct assault, he will suddenly march in the di
rection of Murfreesboro, with a view to over
whelming Rousseau, and thence will pass through
McMinnville, to East Tennessee, us I indicated in
ii former letter. Were be a discreet General, I
should feel confidcnttliathc would do this; but
he is not of that kind; he is no strategist, only a
reckless, dashing leader, in battle.
Deserters and prisoners state that he Is making
a desperate effortto create the impression among
hie men that Thomas* was defeated at Franklin:
but they are hardly prepared to swallow that. I
had a conversation with one the other day, which
I will relate. He was a plucky man and strongly
devoted to the rehri Cf lire, and claimed a victory,
“fioyou were victorious?” 1 said. “Of coarse,”
was tie response. “But do you not recollect that
Rood claimed a victosy before Atlanta ouce, on
the sole ground that he took eight of onr flags,
and that he stated that such trophies were the only
means of determining who had won a battle t”!
inquired. - “1 recollect the address,” bo answered.
“Well, we captured thirty-one battle-flags at
Franklin; and yet you claim yon were the vic
tors.” Just at that time, over a thousand reliel
Erieoners came marching down the street He
ad )>ccn taken early in the action, and did cot
know the extent of our captures. As the prison
ers filed by, 1 asked: “Well, docs that look as if
you had won a victory?” At this point he was
inarched away by the guard, and 1 saw him no
more.
Johnsonville has been evacuated by our troops,
the stores having all been transferred to this city
some time since. A reconuoiseance for eighty
miles up the river disclosed the feet that there
were no rebels on the north side.
Ucnt Fitch, with several iron clads, is here, and
will thoroughly patrol the river, as the water !e
high.
in any event, whatever Hood may do. the present
bupprnsc will not be of long duration. If the
rebels will hot become the attacking party, Thomas
will sally out from his works, and drive them oil,
and follow them up. 1 repeat here, what I have so
often said, that all Thoms*' rctroirade movements
have been for a purpose, and not from compulsion.

The singular omission In the President’s
Message to any anything of onr relations with
Groat Britain and France, while dwelling on
those with minor points, excites comment,
and is by some supposed to have a connec
tion of some sort with the sudden departure
of Lord Lyons, but there Is no reason to so
regard it.
No better illustration of the success with
which the President has harmonized in his
message the views of his supporters can be
found than the fiict that the concluding and
more important passages of the message, from
the calculation about the votes cast at the
last election to the end, was approved unani
mously in full Cabinet meeting without the
suggestion from a singlememl»er of the change*
of a single sentence or clause.
Major General Rosccrans was to-day super
seded in the command of the Department of
Musouri, by Major General Dodge, of Inwa,
Geii. Steele is also understood to be super
seded by Major Gen. Reynolds.
Mr. Chase is likely to be sworn in aad-to
take his seal on the Bench to-morrow, in or
der to make a quorum.
The Supreme Court met andadjoarned over
again to-day for want of a quorum. It passed
resolutions of respect to the late Chief Jcsticc
Taney.

Boyd in Europe, captured at Martinsbarglast
Friday, was brought here to-day and put in

Parties just arrived from the front report
all quiet in the Army of the Potomac, but
that onr army is not going into winter quar
ters. Nearly nil our sick and'wounded have

An order was just issued for the erection

Three hundred sick and wounded were
brought up to-day and placed in hospitals in
this city. Among them were several wound,

Mason.
Last week Gen. •'Merritt started with his

Gen. Merritt scoured London had Fauquier
counties thoroughly, and last Saturu2„ v Wma

No force of the enemy were seen, except a

guerillas were captured. Gen. Merritt’s loss
was one killed and three or four wounded.
Gov. John Flctcberv the radical Governor
elect of Missouri, has had long and very satis

The story about a proposed transfer of Gen.

Governor Dennison’s and Attorney General
Speed’s nominations will undoubtedly be
acted upon by the Senate to-morrow. In ac
cordance with the almost invariable custom,
they were to-day referred to the appropriate
committee.
The Senate has been caucusing to-day on
committees. Quite an animated controversy
took place on the question of putting Grimes
at thehcad of the Nayal Committee in place
of Hole, who is hostile to the department.
The other committees in the Senate remain
practically unchanged. John Sherman rises
by regular promotion to the head of the Fi
nance Committee.
In the House there will he. no changes in
committees except In the vacancy in the Com
mittee of Ways and Means, caused by Stcb
bin’s resignation, which must he filled.
Washington, Tuesday, Dec, 6.—The Senate

The vacant Indiana Judgeship engrosses the

The appointment is expected to be speedily
made. Secretary Usher lias not been a can
didate, though it has been thought probable
that the place might be tendered him. There

1864 over 1861— the first year of the .rebellion
—was $4,083,037.38. As an exhibit of. the ex
cellent financial condition of the department,
the revenues of 1664 were estimated at au in
crease of 5 per centum on those of 1862, while
they actually reached un increase of 42*£ per
cent; and the expenditures which hud been
estimated at $13,060,009, fell $355,213.80 short
of that sum.
ESTIMATES F08,1806.
The estimates for the year 1800 are as fol
lows : Expenditures, $14,098,500; gross reve
nues, $13,184.547.79; giving a deficiency of
$913,952.21; from which must be deducted
the amount of the permanent appropriations
to compensate the department for carrying
free mail matter, $700,009, by which the es
timated deficiency is reduced to $213,052.21.

the armies of the Potomac and Cumberland
through special agmU of the Department,
located at or near the”headquarters of each.
Since the Inauguration of this practice, about
the Ist of July last, the agent at City Point,
Vn., Las s»*ld stamps amounting to $27,773.90
and the agent of the army at Chattan’oaga,

TRANSPORTATION STATISTICS.
On the 80th of June last, there were in the
loyal States and Territories 6,033 mall routes
in operation with a length of 139,173 miles as
follows,viz: Railroad 22.010 miles; steam-,
b0at,7,278 miles; “celerity, certainty and
security,” 100,278 miles; costing $5,518,409.
The aggregate compensation of route agents,
local agents, mail messengers, baejrage mas*,
tera and agents on steamers was $040,753.45,
which added to the cost of service In operation
on tbeSOtb of June, ISG4, ($5,818,469) makes
the total cost of mail transportation at that
date, $0,305,222.48.
OVEBLVND MAILS.
The contract for the service from Atclihon
or St. Joseph to Salt Lake City, is in the
bands of Ben. Holladay, of New York,'at
$365,000; and from Salt Lake City to Folsom
City, Cal., in the hands of .Win, B.
Dinsmore, of New York, at $335,(X>3.
The contracts arc -irom October 1, 13W,
to Sept. 30,18C5. Paper and document mails
for the Padflc coast are to be carried by sea
via New York and Panama, at $160,003 per
annum. The contract for the California and
Oregon route, terminating Sept. 16, ISM, pro
posals were invited for the continuance of the
service to 1806 and 1808. But one bid was
received, that of the California Stage Com
pany, at £250,000 per annum, which was deem
ed extravagant, and accepted only to June 33,
1865, only, with a view to again invite com
petition,‘which has been done. The contract
for service on the joule from St. Cloud, Min
nesota, to Pembina in Dakotah Territory, was
extended to June 80.15G5, and the trips in
creased from one to two per week, at an In
crease of compensation of $17,167 per annum.
Tnqclrj has been made of Lient.Gcn. Grunt
relative to the existing arrangement for sup
plying our armies with malls. He replies
that the system of receiving and forwarding
mails now in operation Is entirely satisfacto
ry, and that 41 oar soldiers recleve their, mail
matter with as much regularity and prompt
ness as is possible for armies in the Held, and
with perbapsas much celerity aud security as
the most favored parts of the country. He
also announces that the policy originally
adopted of excluding civilians from the mail
service within the lines of the army, and de
tailing for that duly enlisted men of intelli
gence and reliability, will be continued.
COST OP DISTRIBUTION.
The expense attending the work in twen
ty-two distributing post offices amounted
during the fourth quarter of ISO 4 to nearly
f2OO,CKX); being at the rale of $309.0 D p“r
year, or about 62 per centum of the whole ex
pense of clerk hire in all offices.
RAILWAY POST OFFICES.
The mailing of all letters direct from one
office to another being objectionable, railway
or travelling post offices have been estab
lished. The requisite cars for the purpose
arc prepared for one daily line between New
York and ■Washington, and by means of clerks
taken temporarily irom the post offices at
Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and
New York, letters intended for distribution at
either of these points arc distributed in the
cars, and so arranged that they can be dis
patched without delay on connecting routes.
By tills means tbc transmission of letter* Is
expedited from twelve to twenty-four hours.
Similar experiments have been made on the
routes from Chicago to Clinton, Davenport,
and Dubuqne. lowa, with equally satisfactory
results. It is hoped the final effect will be to
reduce the expenses connected with the
present plan of distribution.
STATISTICS OP FOREIGN SERVICE.
The aggregate postage npon the correspon
dence exchanged with Great Britain, Prussia,
France, Hamburg, Bremen, and Belgium
amounted to $1,399,005.69, being an excess of
$174,930.48 over last year. The collections In
this country amounted to $531,730.03, and in
Europe to $517,875.01 ; excess of collections
in the United States, $303,855.07.
EXPENSES OP TRANSPORTATION.
By the foreign steamships of tha New York
end Liverpool, Canadian, Bremen and nam
bfirg lines, $770,865.01. By British contract
mall rackets of the Cunard and Galway lines,
$629,340.68. Amount paid formail steamship
service to and from Europe, $371,740.44.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN PROVJNvia.
The total postages on the correspondence
exchanged with the British North American
provinces during the ycar amounted to $397,-
571.59, being an increase of $51,023.09 over the
{irevions year. This. extraordinary increase
a probably partly owing to the fact that
large numbers of rebel agents, sympathizers
and refugees .have taken up Ihoir temporary
abode in Canada.
WEST;INDIAN MAILS.
' The total postages conveyed to and from
the West Indies amounted to $59,090.18, and
the cost of transporting the same ,to and
from Havana and other west India ports was
$40,337.03, being $19,653.15 less than the
United States postages on the mails conveyed.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN MAILS.
The United States postages upon the cor
respondence exchanged with Central and
South America, via Aspinwall and Panama,
amounted to $14,208.51, all of which was paid
to Cornelius Vanderbilt for tbc sea and Isth
mus transportation.
NEW LISE OP MAIL PACKETS.
During the post year a new line of French
mail packets has been established between
France and the United States, the steamships
plyingatprcsentdirectbotweu Havre andNcw
York. An arrangement has also been conclu
ded for the transportation of the malls fort
nightly "between Boston and Halifax, Canso
and Picton, Nova Scotia, and Charlottetown,
Prince Edwards Island. The transportion of
the mails between aport of the United States,
north of the Potomac River and Rio de Janeiro
in Brazil* to commence on or before Sept. Ist,
1865, has been awarded to the New York Nue
vitas & Cuba Steamship Co., at $340,000 per
annum, the turn to be divided equally be
tween {be two governments.
ROUTE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO JAPAN AND
CHINA.
There are other ocean routrsbesides the one
to Brazil, which can be safely and profitably
occupied by American lines of moil steamers,
among which the route between San Francis
co, Japan and China, at present occupied by
foreign mail packets, is perhaps the most im
portant in a commercial point of vl-w, and
may be available in securing to ns a large
participation in the commerce of the East,
the greater portion of which is now enjoyed
by great Britain through her mall steamship
connections, via Suez, in the Indian ocean
and China Seas.
The central position of the UutUed States
between eastern Asia and western Europe,
affording rentes but little longer, if any, than
those now traversed between these distant
regions, aided by the superior expedition of
runway transportation between the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts, will famish such facilities
as will mate their adoption a practical neces
sity for thc commercial- intercourse between
Europe and the populous countries of eastern
Asia. These considerations, and others which
will readily suggest themselves, render it im
portant that the Pacific routes, properly be
longing to ns, should be occupied by Ameri*.
rim mail steamers, the profits of which, with
the addition of a small subsidy for the mail
service, would justify the establishment of
one or more steamship lines, which would be
: remunerative to the proprietors. -•
number of post offices;
Including the suspended post office?, the
whole number on the 30th of June, 1864, was
28,878, of wElch 19,976 are su the loyal States
and 8,903 in the disloyal States. The number,
of Presidential offices is 705, and 28,178 ore

The number of dea£ letters received and
examined during the year was 3,503,825. Dar
ing the year there were registered and re
mailed to the respective owners, as contain

gate of $131,611.24, of which number 20,059,
containing $104,605.84, were delivered. The
number of leiters contalning Papers of value

of these letters delivered was«l,B7B. Daring
the year 4,538 letters and paßrngcs were re

types and articles of jewelry, | Of this num
ber 29,999 were sent out for delivery. The
number of valuable dead lectors registered
and sent out for delivery w|U 68,187. .The
number of letters which it was found impos
sible to forward from the offices where depos
ited, or to deliver to the parties addressed,
because of the postage being unpaid or on
account of being illegibly directed, and which
were consequently sent to the Dead Letter
Office, was 115,812. A large timber of letters
addressed to rebel localities - nave been re
tinned to the Dead Letter Office, amounting
to 31,423. The gross revenue derived from
the dead letter postage amounted to $23,-
555.38, and the report suggests to Congress
the propriety of restoring prepaid letters to
■tho owners free of postage, especially In view
of tho fact that a very large .proportion go to
persons of very moderate meKns. The num
ber of letters returned to foreign
countries daring the year was 162,591, the un
pc Id postage on which was £9,161.53. The
number received from foreign countries in the
same condition during the c .mc -period was
€2,427, and tho amount of unpaid postage
thereon was $3,088.57.

which have already been published in those

“By the eleventh section ct‘ the Act above

prohibited from depositing in any bank mon

postmasters having moneys trbm this source
to deposit in the National banks designated
by the Secretary of tho Treasury, as deposito

Mississippi Navigation matter*.
[Special Dispatchto the Chicago Tribune.]
Sr. Paul, Tuesday, Dee.
Reliable information has reached here that
most of the hostile tribes of Indians have
sent representatives to Fort Sully, on the
Missouri, with overtures for peace. Captain
Pell, General Sully'* Adjutant General, re
fused to receive the Indians until they gave
up the white woman they hold as prisoner
They agreed to this and sent a delegation for
her, which had not returned when our Infor
mant left.
Everything now looks favorable to an early
peace with the Indians in upper Missouri.
Gcncial Sully has gone to Washington to
secure authority to treat with them. As soon
as the tribes can bo learned better than to
feed and furnish ammunition to the few wan
dering bonds on tbo northern boundaries of
this State, the Indian war can be completely
ended.
The boat which started from La Crosse for
St. Paul, tailed to reach here, but a boat came
up from Prescott with a load of freight on
Saturday night. This Is four days later than
a boat was ever .before known to reach this
port. The river is closed again this morning,
and will remain so until spring.

away about 2,000 head ot cattle, sheep and
hops,- and have left the whole region over
wmch they passed without hay or forage of
any kind; all the bams containing hay have
becn.burned and the haunts of Mosby and

-few rebel prisoners were taken. The party
was followed and attacked by bushwhackers
at various points, but not with any serious
opposition. The result of this raid into the
London Valley, which has been the lurking
place of Mosby?s and other guerillas, is most
important, and will greatly increase their
difficulties in subsisting on that part of the
country. . ; - '

The Military Situation—lmportant
Rebri News of Sherman’s March*-*
New York New*--Washington items.
[Special Dispatch to the Western Press.]
New Your, Tuesday, Dec. 6—Midnight.
The Military Situation.
Later dispatches from thq Army of the
Potomac report no new movements of impor
tance. The rebels continued their artillery
fire on Dutch Gap canal Saturday, but it was
not as heavy as'dnring proceeding days.
The French frigate Adonia is now lying in
James River. Her officers have ihado visits
to tho armies and express amazement at the
extent and magnificence of the plans of Gen.
Grant.
The World's Washington special says Col-
Mulford states that as yet Sherman’s move
ments Lad not interfered with the exchange
of prisoners, and if such should continue to
be the case he expected to effect an exchange
of one thousand per diem.
The Herald . announces some im
portant changes recently made in
subordinate commands under Gen. Cabby.
Among these the assignment of General Dana,
lately commanding at Vicksburg, to the dis
trict embraced firWeafc Tennessee and the
State of Mississippi, under the designation of
the Department of the Mississippi, and the
ttausfcr of Gen. Steele from the.command of
Die 7th Army Corns in Arkansas to special
duty at* New Orleans, to be succeeded by
Gen. J. J. Reynolds, and the return of Gen.
Ranks to the head of the Department of the
Gulf, with headquarters at New Orleans. In
military affairs Gen. Banks will act in subor
dination to Gen. Canby, bat in his civil ad
ministration he will be responsible directly
to the President.
Headquarters Abmt of the Potomac,
Monday, Dec. 5. —There is nothing of interest
to report. There was quite a fusilade last even
ing in the’ vicinity of the Jerusalem plank
road,.but it did not last long. No harm done.
New York, Dec. o.—Rebel official and
newspaper accounts admit • all that has been
claimed on the Union side of the complete
success of Gen. Gregg’s cavalry raid on the
Weldon Railroad, oh‘ Thursday last. The
serious and dangerous effects ofitlo Lee’s
army are conceded, and it Is thought to bear
even more military Importance than the Im
mediate losses sustained by the rebels in the
destruction of property and capture of pro
visions.
The Richmond papers say that the firing by
the rebel guns on the Dutch Gap Canal last
week, was merely for experimental practice,
to ascertain what damage they can inflict on
the monitors, if they attempt to pass through
it.
It is said that Grant’s men In front of
Petersburg are preparing their winter quar
ters.
Hobo! News,
The Richmond Examiner Bays all .the news
from Georgia Is extremely encouraging. A
few clays ago when the Yankees wcrcroportcd
to have reached Milieu, there was reason to
believe they would roach the coast easily, but
the report was unfounded. They were whip
})cd before Millen, and a columnof Fosters
roin Port Royal has. also been beaten com
pletely. If Gen. Sherman gets through now,
which Is doubtful, he. will do so with the loss
of half his army.
In the rebel House of Representatives, on
Saturday, Mr. Foote offered a resolution call
ing for a convention of Southern States, with
the evident viewtoreconstrcetlon. Thercso
tious were laid on the table by a vote of 63 to
13. A bill was reported appropriating one
hundred thousand dollars towards the relief
of prisoners in' the enemy’s hands.
The Whig of the 2d saya the “man with the
black valise” is among the Yankees uud will
not be driven out. He will elndo their grasp
and defeat their efforts to arrest him or balfle
his attempts. His plans are well laid. .
The Richmond jA»pdtch of the 3d looks upon
Gregg’s expedition asvery important,evident
ly fearing it was something more than a cav
alry raid.
The Angnsta 'Sfffititr claims that in the
fight of the 20th Kilpatrick’s cavalry were
badly defeated by Wheeler.
The rebel editors appear still -puzzled to
know whether Sherman meant to strike
Charleston, or Savannah; or Beaufort, or join
Gen. Grant in front of Richmond. They ac
knowledge that he has met With very little
eslstancc.
Tbe Savannah 2t r em of the 23 th gives an ac
count of Sherman’s attack on Macdn on tbe
20th. It says the fight was principally with
artillery, but some small arms were used. It
claims that the Yankees were driven off, leav
ing their dead and wounded on the ground,
and complains of the plundering of tbe in
habitants by the rebels, alter the Yankees
were repulsed.
On Thursday night, a body of tbe enemy’s
cavalry attempted to cross the Oconee, twelve
or fourteen miles below tbe bridges. They
were attacked and driven into tbs river. They
threw away their arms and ran into the
swamps to escape. There is much scraggling
among the Yankee troops. Three were picked
np by our cavalry. They report that the
army is worn down and almost destitute of
provisions.
The Savannah JJepeNfran of the 2Sth says
the Invalding or lleeing army of Sherman,
arc, from all accounts, still In the middle of
Georgia, somewhere in ,I*l6 vicinity of Oconee
River, aud not advanced far enough to aufchor
ize any satisfactory opinion of its destination.
It Is slill where It may charge Augusta’, Sa
vannah or Brunswick, or even turn tall and
make tracks for Macon or- Columbus. The
latter cities are sold to be well defended in
addition to their excellent location in a mili
tary point of view. Augusta is now believed
to be able to take care oi'hersclf. If Sherman
should take a fancy to come this way, on the
Central Railroad, or even west’ofit, be will
find his troubles have just commenced. HU
conduct at last accounts indicated much hesi
tation aud doubt regarding his policy. Ho
was advancing slowly and cautiously. Our
own forces are of the right stamp and in the
right place and at the proper time they will
give full and good report of themselves. If
we can only destroy Sherman’s cavalry he
will never be able to get free of Middle
Georgia , . -
The Angusta ßegMer of the 27th says Wayne
is reported ns having retired. Hardee is
looking after things in that quarter, aud we
hare no fears for the result. The enemy’s
position is becoming developed at last, we
will soon have full knowledge of his where
abouts, and we have no doubt of our ability
topnnish his temerity. We are glad to learn
there is a disposition on the part of onrpvCplo
to remove or destroy all provisions likely to
fall into the hands of the enemy. This Is one
of. the most efficient modes of thwarting his
purpose that could well be adopted.
The Savannah JRepvNican of the Ist, says it
mentioned in a previous issue, that a Ibrce of
Fedcrala bad landed on Broad River, and
were advancing on the railroad in the direc
tion of GrnhamsvHle. During the night the
Confederates transported an effective force to
that point, which, uniting with that already
on the marched lorward on the 30th
Nov., under command of Gen. Smith, of Ga.,
with the State troops, to meet them. The
JiezivKican says the Federal troops
numbered- 5,d00 men, , with sixteen
pieces of artillery. Smith was attacked
at'a place called Horey ville, three miles from
Grahamsvillo. The Confederates had only
1,400 musketa and 7 pieces of artillery. The
fight lasted until-dark. The'paper says we
repulsed every attack, finally driving the en
emy’s right and centre, but the left stood un
moved.
At the. close of the action, tbo rebels
received. iteinforcements. Notwithstanding
their boasting they admit that It was’ a
drawn battle. The Republican of the SOth
savs: Last night seven or eight transports,
with treops, were rapidly going up Broad
river, whi«h gives assurance that the fight
will be renewed to-day. The J&p'jbUcan says
Wheeler managed Kilpatrick with all ease.
New York, December 6.—The Richmond-
Enquirer of December Sd .‘says: “We believe
it true that Sherman’s army has reached Mil
ieu, and separated into , two columns, one
moving towards the Savannah river, and nn
other turning back towards Augusta. The
kilter column and movement is without doubt
intended as a feint to protect his rear from
attack. It is too late to menace Augusta, and
Sherman’s 'main body is too for South. He
will do ono of two things—either go straight
to Beaufort and Savannah, to attack Charles
ton by land, or will join Grant in an attack
against Richmond. .He Las met with-very
.little ..resistance In his march through
G Th(f Augusta Uegiiicr of November 27th
Bays: ‘ 1 Too news yesterday was very inter
esting from up the Georgia road, and we
learn that the enemy’s raiding parties had ap
proached very near, if not quite to. Warren
ton.- Scouts report-them as being near that
•place, but as fkr as we can learn, they were In
small parties. These parties are no doubt
scouting or small raiding parties. We regard
this appearance of the enemy as no indication
of the presence of the main body. Such
movements are doubtless intended to feci our
strength and cover tbe real direction of thelc
march.”

The Treasury Report.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report,
reviews the financial measures adopted since
the outbreak of the rebellion. This is in sev
eral acts the authorizing the issue of bonds
at long periods of payment of principal at
maturity mcoia, andinothers notspecificallj
provided. The omission, it is believed, wos
accidental, as there could have been no inten
tion to make a distinction between different
classes of securities. In this respect the Sec
retary recommends that all doubts
be removed by legislation. The act
of June last, authorizing the Secre
tary to dispose of any bonds known as
5-20$ remaining unsold, it is at least ques
tionable whether, by this clause, power is
conferred to dispose of the amount beyond
that fixed by existing law. Additional legis
lation may remove that doubt, should Con
gress think it advisable, otherwise they may
be cancelled. The Secretary says $300,009,000,
at least, should be realized from internal du
ties. It is for Congress to select sources and
devise modes in which the most desirable
result can be obtained. He suggests whether
the income tax should not be collected from
all without exemption. In connection vrith
the subject of Increased taxation and . the ne
cessity of providing additional'revenue from
ordinary sources, the Secretary calls at
tention to our public domain, especially
to that portion of it abounding in precious
and other metals, which by the policy of the
Government has been reset ved to the nation.
He hopes that Congress maybe able to devise
some mode by which these lands may be
made available to an extent in some measure
proportioned to their yearly production. He
suggests a board of officers, a commission* of
Sinking Fund, and whether ench-income as
may be received from the public domain,
from sales or in the shape of rents or royalty,
may not be beneficially appropriated to the
same purpose. As to foreign loans, he
says tho possible benefit to bo derived
has not seemed sufficient to overbalance
other and opposing considerations. He does
believe that our patriotic people 'straggling
for national existence and the possession of
ample means,should not be compelled to adopt
measures so fraught withjinjnrioas conse
quences os the issue of_paper money beyond
the limits prescribed. The question, howev
er, is one for that people to decide. They
have pronounced for the continuance of the
war until its great object shall be accom
?l!shed, -in unmistakable terms. It is for
hem further to determine whether the nec
essary means shall be furnished by way of
loans, and a circulation-to be restrained with
in State limits, or whether they will prefer
to endure the evils of exorbitant prices, with
loss of credit on the present, and debt of
endless magnitude entailed upon tho future.
Notes bearing an increased rate of interest,
payable in currency, redeemable in three or
five years, and convertible at maturity into
5*20 bonds, would be preferable to any other
form of security.
Any estimate of probable receipts and ex
penditures for tho nest fiscal year must
necessarily be liable to uncertainty. This re
mark applies more particularly to the expen
ditures, for while the existing laws remain
unchanged the amount of revenue may be
calculated with reasonable certainty, it is Im
possible to anticipate what the exigencies of
war may require on the one hand, and on the
other it may be confidently hoped that the
great struggle is near its termination, and,
consequently, any estimate now' submitted
will prove far beyond the wants of tho year.
While any doubt remain?, however. It would
be insane to assume any other basis of calcu
lation than the one indicated by the existing
state of affairs:
Receipts for the year ending Jane 33, 1301, are
estimated as follows:
From enstoms.
From Internal Duties.
From Lands
From miscellaneous educes
Aggregate $296,000,000
The expenditures arc estimated as follows :•
Balance of unexpended appropriations. $350,000,000
