PRESIDENTS MESSAGE, r<

FINANCES. W
lit my tirst aiiutml message I promised to employ o
my best exertions, in co-operation with Congress, to 1
reduce the expenditures of the Government within b
the limits of a wise and judicious economy. An s'
overflowing treasury had produced habits of" prodi- ?
galiiv and extravagance which could only bu gtadu- "
ally corrected. The work required both time and w
patience. 1 applied mvsolf diligently to this task 7'
trcm *hc beginning, and was aided by the able and jl
encr.. ..a elforrsof the heads of the different Execu- b
tive Departments. The result ot our inborn in this al
good ciiitse did not appear in the sum total of our ex- 0
pendic.'.tv- for the nr*t two years, mainly in eonso- r
qttetice of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily 81
incurred in the Utah expedition, ami the very large d
amount of the contingent expenses of Cougroas du- ?
ring tin-, period. These greatlv exoccd the pay and "
mileage of the members. For "the year ending Sutli ?
June. laoiS, whiist the nav and mileage amounted to w
$1,490,214, the contingent oxpcuscii rose to $2,0S3,30!?
7'.', and lor the vear ending 30th June, 1S5U, wliilst P
the pay and i nil cage amounted to ysaS.O'.'S 66, the I.1
contingent expenses amounted to $l,431,ot>0 7S. I f>
am happy, however, to be utile to inform you. that u.
during the lust fiscal year ending on the 30th June, ti
16th?, the total expenditures of the Government, v
In all its branches?legislative, executive and judicial?exclusive
of the public debt, were reduced $
to the sum of $,' *>,402,4<j.', 40. This conclusively ap- 0
pears from tile h.-oks ol the Treasury. In the*year fl
ending ?'n the 3t'th June, i3">5, the lotul expenditure, b
exclusive of the public debt, amouoted to
$71.201,12t< 77. and that for the year ending on the c
3<|th June. ls.V.1, to $00,340,220 13. Whilst tho books 11
of the Treasury show an actual expenditure of ?

lv chnrgeithle tc> the year ls.7'.i, must be deducted ?
from the sunt of $7i?,S4S,47-l 7'.', in order to useer- *'
ud the expenditure for the year ending on the Soth ti
June, IsGO; which leaves a balance for the expenditures
of thut year of *.7.7,402,40") 40. The interest r
on 'ho public debt, including Treasury notes, lor the *
same riscal year ending on the S'.'th June, 1300, 11
amounted to 5?;.177,U14 tig. which, added to the 11

It (.light ill j i is'.fee to he observed that several of j;
the estimates irt'.'n the departments for the year ending
H'Uh June, ie'10, were reduced by Congress below J1
what was and still is deemed compatible with the
public interest. Allowing a liberal margin of
$2,.7'X',Wo for this reduction, and lor other causes, it
may he saiely asserted that the sum of $61,000,000,
or. at the most. $02,000,000, is amply sufficient to
administer the Government and to pay the interest
on the public debt, unless contingent events should Jj
heroalter render extraordinary expenditures necessary.
... !;
Tins result has been attained in a considerable de- .
gree by the cure exercised by the appropriate depart- !'
nients'in entering iuto public contracts. I have myself
nuver interfered with the award of any such "
contrite?,except iu a single ease with the Colonization ?
Society, deeming it advisable to cast the whole re- "
spoustbility in caeh ease on the proper head of the
department, with the general instruction that these .
contracts should always be given to the lowest and
best bidder, li has ever been mv opinion that pub- e,
lie contracts are not a legitimate source of patronage, '
to be conferred upon personal or political favorites; 1
but that in ail such cases u public otlicer is bound to
act for t lie Government asa prudent individual would
act for hiiuseit.
AKWCaX SLAV k Tli.CDE, LTC. 1
1: is with great satisfaction, 1 communicate the fact,
that since the date of my last Anuuul Message, not
a single slave bus heen imported into the United
States in violation of the laws prohibiting the c
Airiest!) slave trade. This statement is founded upon
a thorough examination and investigation of the sub- ?
jeet. Indeed, the spirit which prevailed some time '<
since amonga portion o! our fellow-citizens iu favor
of this trade seems to have entirely subsided.
I also emigrate late vou upon the public sentiment
which now exists against the crime of sotting on foot
military expeditions within the limits of the United
otates,"to proceed fromthenec to and make war upon
the people of unoffending States, with whom wc are n
si peace. In this respect a happy change lues been j
effected since the commencement of my Adtninistration.
It surely ought to be the prayer of every *
Christian and patriot, that such expeditious may -1
never again receive countenance in our country or
depart from our shores.
It would be a useless repetition to do more thun n
refer, with earnest commendation, to inv former re- .
commendations in favor of the 1'acilie llailroad?ot
the grant of power to the President to employ the Si
naval force in the vicinity for the protection of the A
lives and property of our fellow-citizens passing in
transit over the "different Central American routes, ,1
against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations,
and also to'protcot American merchant vessels, Si
their crews and cargoes against violent nud unlawful oi
seizure and confiscation in the ports of Mexico and fc
t!ic South American republics, when these may bu in
u disturbed and revolutionary condition. It is tuy ,
settled conviction tiiat without such u power we do
not ailbrd that protection to those engaged in the
commerce of the country which they have a right to JJ
demand,
ELECTION i.P MEMRKItS Of Co.NOnEs*. f
1 again recommend to Congress the passage of u ,
law in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitu- 0
tion, appointing a day certain, previous to the 4th
.Marc:! in eazh year of an odd number, lor the eleo- cc
tion of llcproso'.itstives throughout all the States.?
A similar power I,.ls already been exercised, with "
genera! approbation, in the appointment of the same
day throughout the Union for holding the election oi at
Electors for President and Vice President of the
United States. My attention was earnestly directed sv
to this subject, from tho fact that the oJth'Congress
terminated on the Cd March, loPe. without making
the necessary appropriation for the service of the 20
Post Office Lie part in cut. 1 was then forced to consider
the best remedy for This omission, and au immediate
call of the present Congress was the natural . r
resort. Upon enquiry, however, I ascertained that
titteen out of the thirty-three States composing the ar
Confederacy were without representatives, and tiiat, lit
consequently, these fifteen States would be disfrail- }]
chisod by such a call. Tlie.se fifteen States will be
in the same condition on the 4th .March ue.xt. Ten
of them cannot elect Ileprcsentalivcs, according to
existing State laws, until different periods, extending
from the beginning of August next until the months cl
of October and November. ju
It. tuy last message I gave warning that, ill a time
of sudden and alarming danger, the salvation oi our
institutions might depend upon the power of the Pre- ?'
sidetit immediately to assemble a full Congress, to ?
meet the emergency. [)
TARIFF.
It is now quite evident that the financial necossi- ,
t.es oi the Government will require a modification of
the tariff during your present session, tor the pur
pose oi increasing tin- revenue, in uns aspect, i <iusire
to reiterate the recommendation contained in 0l
inv last twoannual message, in lavcr of imposing '
specific instead of to/ filonm duties on all imported
articles to which theso can be properly applied.
rrotn long bservation and experience 1 am eonvin- if
eed thut specific duties are necessary, both to protcot
the revenue and to secure to our "manufacturing *!
interests that r?m tint of iiicidental encouragement
which unuvoidatde results from a revenue lurid'. w
As an abstract proposition it may !>e adtniltcd that CC
lid r<ilortir, duties would, in theory, lie the most just
and equal. Uut it the experience of this and ot all
other commercial nations has demonstrated that such "
duties cannot he assessed and collected without {Treat a(
frauds upon the revenue, then it is the . art of wis- M
dorn to resort to speciflo duties. Indeed, from the of
very nature of an ad ealortta duty, this must be the j]
result. L'uder it the inevitable couscqueuee is, that
foreign iroods will be entered at less than their true
value. The treasury will, therefore, lose the duty on hi
the difference between their real and fictitious value. h<
and to this extent we are defrauded. A
The temptations which uJ valor am duties present Ji
to a dishonest importer are irresistible. His object
is to pass his goods through the Custom-house ut the
very lowest valuation necessary to save tlieui from
confiscation, in this he too oilen succeeds in spite vt
of the vigilance of the revenue officers, lleoco the al
resort to false invoices, one. for the purchaser and
another for the custom-house, and t<> other expedi- 01
cuts to defraud the Government. The honest importer
producesjiis invoice to the collector, stating in
the actual price at which he purchased the nrtielos ft.
abroad. Not so the dishonest importer and t he agent u
oi the foreign manufacturer. And here it may be
observed that a very large proportion of the inniiii- t'1
factiires imported from abroad are consigned for sale
to commission merchants who are mere agents em- p(
ployed by the manufacturers. In such cases no ae- J,
tual sale has been made to fix their value. The fo- 1
reign manufacturer, if he be dishonest, prepares an se
invoice ot the goods, not at their actual value, but
at the very lowest rate nccessarv to escapo detection, fo
In this manner the dishonest importer and the fo- u]
reign manufacturer enjov a decided advantage over
the honest merchant. They are thus enabled to undersell
the fair trader, and drive him from the mar- to
ket. In tact, the operation of this system has alrei? tfc
dy driven trotu the pursuits ot honorable commerce bt
many ot that class ot regular and conscientious merchants.
whose character, throughout the world, is the
pride o: our country. P1
Tin- remedy for those evils is to be found in apecific
duties. >o far as this may he practicable. They DJ
uispvh-e v. ,;ii nnv inquiry ut the oustotn-bntisc into tu
the actual or value oi the urticle, and it puvs ca
the precise amount of duty previously fixed by law.
They present ? > temptations to the appraisers of
foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and
might, by undei valuation in a few cases, reiider.ibeiu- N
selvos independent. ar
Besides, speeirie duties l-ot conform to the requi- \r
sitiotl in tile Constitution that "no preference shall
be given by any regulation ot commerce or revenue "
to the ports of one State over those ot another."? si<
Under our ad valorem system such pr- tun-nees are ni
to some extent inevitable, and complaints have often c.
been made tlsat 'lie spirit ot this provision has been ..
violated bv a lower appraisement of the same articles '*
at one port than at another. sit
An impression, strangely enough, prevuils to some M
extent, that specific duties are necessarily protective ?j
duties. Xothing can be more fallueions. llreut
Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue
from imports is at the present moment collected '1'
under a system of specific duties. It is a striking nti
fact, in this connection, that.iu thoeommercial treaty frc
of fiSd January, lot?h between France and England, jj(
? one- of the articles provides that the ad lalur-.M du- t ,
ties which it imposes shall bo converted into specific j~'
duties within six months from its date, and these are br
to be ascertained by making an average of the prices
tor six months previous to that time. The reverse w(
of the proposition would benearcrtothctruth.be i
cau-e a much larger amount of revenue would bo
collected by merely converting the ad valorem duties
of it tnritl into equivalent specific duties. To this '
extent the revenue would be increased, and in the pp
same proportion ihe specific duiv might be Uimin- ,u,
ished. " tm
Specific duties would secure to the American man- I"5
ufacturor the incidental protection to which he is w'l;
fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to this sure- ]
Iv no person would object. The fratners of the existing
tariif have gone further, and. in a liberal spirit. , '
have discriminated in favor of large and useful "C1
branches ?.?t* ?ur manufactures, not by raising the rate If
of duiv upon the importation of similar articles from i wil
abroad, '"it. wiuit is the same in effect, by admitting i ,jjS
articles ' j >:' Jul \ which enter into the composition j ,
of their hioiics. '
Under the pr. .- ut system it has been often truly j thf
\
miarlccd that (thin incidental protection decreases in
hen the manufacturer need* it most, unci increases w
lien ho needs it least, and ooiistitutesa sliding scale .
liielt always operates upiinst liim. The revenues
f the couutry are subject to similar fluctuation.?
usteud of approaching a steady standard, as would
e the ease under a system ol specific duties, they
ink and rise with tho sinking and rising prices of
rticles in foreign countries. It would not tie dill!cult
>r Congress lo arrange a system of spccilic duties s(
hich would ufl'ord additional stability both to our tl
jvenuc and our mnnufaelures, and without injury or
ljustice to any interest ol the country. This might
c accomplished by ascertaining the average value of
ny given article for a series of years at the place of ni
xixirtation, and by simply converting the rate of <n/ r<
ulofm duty upou it which might be deemed ncces,?ry
for revenue purposes, into the form of a specific C(
uty. Such an arrangement could not injure the
ansunier. If lie should pay n greater amount ol'
uty one year, this would be counterbalanced bv a
:sser amount tho next, and in tho end the aggregate
ould bo the samo. " tl
1 desire to cull your immediate attention to the
resent condition of the Treasury, so ably und clear- ,
r presented by the Secretary ill his report to Con- 01
rcss; and to recommend that measures he promptly C!
doptod to enable it to discharge its pressing obligu- si
,ons. The other recommendations of the report are u
roll worthy of your favorable consideration.
I herewith transmit to Congress tlio reports 01 tuc
oorcUries of War. ol the Xavv, of the Interior, and e
f the Dosmastor General. The recommendations g
nd suggestions which they contain arc highly valua- si
le and deserve your careful attention. n
The repor of tho Postmaster Gci*rul details the ,
ircnuistanccs* under which Cornclins Vnnderbilt, on
jy reouest, agreed, in the month of July last, to
arrv the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Paei- h
c coasts, llad lie not thus acted, this important fli
atcrcoinitiunicuiion must have been suspended, at i
:ast for a season. The Postmaster General had no .
owcr to make him any other compensation than the b
ostoges on the mail matter which he might carry.? n
t was known, at the time, that these postages would ?
nil fur short of an adequate compensation, as well t)
s of the sum which the same service had previouscost
the Government. Mr. Vnnderbilt, mi a cojnuendable
spirit, was willing to rely upon the justice w
f Congress to make up the deficiency; and I, there- a;
ore, reccommcnd that an appropriation nitty be
ranted for this purpose.
I should do great injustice to the Attorney Genual
were 1 to omit the mention of his distinguished v
ervices in the tneasiires adopted and prosecuted bv p
liui for the defence of the Government against mi- k
nerous and unfounded claims to land in Calilornia, j(
mrporting to have been made by the Mexican Gov- .
runient previous to the treaty ot' cession. The sue- *'
essful opposition to these claims lias saved to the it
Jnltutl States public property worth inai.v millions ci
if dollars, and to individuals hulJiug title under
hern to ut least an equal amount.
It has been represented to nie, from sources which >'
deem reliable, that the inhabitants in several por- 11
ions of Kansas have been reduced nearly to a state si
f starvation, on account of the almost total failure ti
f their crops, whilst the harvests.in every other
ortion ot the country have been abundant.?
'lie prospect before them for the approaching winter l'

'ould recommend its adoption. w

lect was known to be a dangerous man, beause
he avowed the principle of the "irrepresible
conflict" party, with the view of making
ar upon my section. Though the present

lie did not think nny <jI the .Southern States
ad acted precipitately. If such occurrences
s have taken place in the last fifteen years
ad been with a foreign nation we would have
cen at war before this. In his judgment a
umber of the Southern States would secede
ithin sixty days. The South Carolina xubtissiori
party was small.
The wisest thing that Congress could do
ould be to divide the public property as fairly
s possible alter paying tbe public debts. My
cople are not terrified?we have more teriijry
now than the colonies who begun the war
iih Great Britain. W'e have four times their
opulation. Our imports last year amounted
i $;:0,UU0,iJf?0. Northern gentlemen say our
istitutions are a disgrace to the family, and
ley want to have them removed. They say
is a sin to hold slaves. If we separate their
.nisciciiccs will be clear.
He agreed with the 1'residentthat there Is no
ower in the government to force a State to retain
in the I'nion. The most offensive nggreson
would be to lev)- tribute, and if a separaon
takes place all the slave States would be
uiet and peaceable. They were carrying out
le policy of the fathers of the revolution.
Mr. Crittenden replied that he had hoped
icy had come together as a union of Iriends.
le hoped, for himself,that the Union lie lias so
>ng lived under would be preserved, lie rose
ir the purpose of expressing a hope that the
sample of the gentleman from North Carolina
otild not be followed. Better not come here

ould be no angry debates. North Carolina

.Mr. Ciingman approved the desire expressed
i preserve the Union, lie would be sustained
i what he had said by a majority of the people
f his State. North Carolina was next to the
st to come into llio Union, and when the
nion ceases to protect her she will bid it good

Mr. Morehead, from the committee appointI
to wait on the President, reported that they
id performed that duty, ami that the Presi nt
requested them to say that he would comunicitc
his message in writing today at noon.
Mr. Phelps?"That hour has already arced."
After some unimportant proceedings the
essago was laid lu-forc the Mouse, anil read
: Col. Forney, the Speaker having first relestcd
gentlemen to be silent.
The message having been read,
Mr. Sherman moved that it be referred to the
inmiltee of the whole on the state of the

shale to day, lie moved the previous question.
Mr. John Cochrane said he had purposed to

intlciuan from Virginia (Mr. Boteletq had
sen for a similar purpose, lie would give way.
Mr. Botcler expressed his thanks to Mr.
ochrane, and, Mr. Sherman having withdrawn
s demand for the previous question, Mr.

luirnittee of one from each State, with leave

.Mr. McClcrnand wished to movo an amendcr.t,
and amid repeated calls it was read as
Hows:
' Resolved, That so much of the President's
inual message as relates to matters of grievice
between the slavehohling States, and the
oposid by Congress of amcndincnts to the
oustitutiou of the United States for the ratifi-;
ition o! the several States, and to the question
' State secesion from the Federal Union, be \
ferrcd to a select committee, to consist of one j
om each State, to be appointed by the Speak I
; and that such committee be instructed to !
quire into and report by bill, or by proposing j
1 amendment or amendments to tbc Consti-1
ition of the United States, or otherwise, upon j
tcli subjects; and particularly whether any ;
rthcr legislation or amendment to the Con-1
itution is necessary to give prompt, certain j
id full ellect to the last clause of the second
etion of the fourth article of the Constitution, !
incoming the return of fugitives from service ;
' labor."
Mr. Moteler declined to accept Mr. McClerind's
amendment.
Mr. Sherman proposed to Mr. Holder that
stead of a select committee of one from each '
ate, there should lie a committee of fifteen, j
Irics of "oh, tio."J
Mr. Uocock raised a question of order with ,
ferencc to the last part of Mr. Holder's reso- |
tion. A committee could not report at any I
ne without a suspension of the rules.
The Speaker decided that the question was j
idl taken.
Mr. Bocock, at the request of several friends, 1
ithdrcw his objection,
Mr. Stanton supposed that Mr. Bolder could ;
complish his object by omitting the last clause
his resolution.
Messrs. Curry and Burnett rencwod the ob:tion.
Mr. Botelcr modified his resolution by stri
ngout the words "with leave 10 report at any
11C."
Mr. Slicniian wished to oiler an amendment,
iving the House to decide as to the mode of
ganizing the proposed committee.
Mr. Holder replied that he had specially |
oided saying how the committee should be j
ised.
The Speaker said that the rules provided '
at the Speaker shall appoint committees, lints
otherwise ordered.
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, wished to oiler an
lendmcnt, which he read lor information, as j
lows:
"Resolved, That we are unalterably and ini- '
ivahlv attached to the Union of the States: j
it we recognize in the Union the primary
.ise of our present greatness and prosperity .
a na'ion, and have as yet seen nothing, d*
;r in the election of Abraham Lincoln to the j
esidency, or from any other source, to jus- j
r its dissolution; and that we pledge to each
icr our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred j
nor to maintain it.''
Uhjeclion was made. Mr. Holder's resolution j
ing distinctly before the House.
Mr. Runietl suggested that each committee* |
n be selected by the State delegations.
Cries of "No." "No." "That is contrary
the rules."]
Mr. Kunkd suggested that instead of the
rds, "perilous state of the country," that
. Boteler incorporate in his resolution the
guage contained in Mr. McClernand's prolition,
so that the House might specifically ;
3w what is to be referred to the Committee, i
| The question was then on agreeing to Mr.
| Holder's resolution, as an amendment to Mr.
! Sherman's motion.
j Before the vote was announced, Mr. Single:
ton, of Mississippi, said he declined voting on
this question, because the Legislature of his
' State had called a Convention to consider the
matter. !fe believed that the people would
: determine it for themselves.
Mr. Jones, of Georgia, remarked that hisreaI
son for not voting was that his State had also
called a convention to decide as to her federal
relations, aiul did not want Congress to decide
for her.
Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, said his State had
appointed some day in January for a State :
; convention to take into consideration this very
question. The people of Florida had decided
! to settle in convention, the time, manner and
mode of redress. It was for them, and they I
i will settle the question in their sovereign ca- j
parity. It was not fir him, therefore, to take '
'anv action here upon the subject, lie was:
.. ? .,n enninrmnise now. as be was in times ;
I P"*'- " . !'
.Mr. .Morris, of Illinois, rose to it point of or1
der, that while the ijuestion was pendingitwas ]
out of order to open debate.
.Mr. Cloptwi, of Alabama, also declined to j
vote because his State had called a convention. J
Mr. li'artrell, "f (icorgia, said he did not rise !
to debate, but simply to say, for a similar ren- 11
son as just assigned, lie declined voting for this I >
proposition.
Mr. Houston, of Abibaina, said be would do j j
all he could lo accomplish great ends for the I i
: country, and as ibis rcsoululion was directed j:
tosucb a purpose, he should vote for it. j i
Mr. Cuitv, of Alabama, next addressed the | i
> chair. j '
The Speaker inquired: ? Does the gentleman | 1
: desire to vole ? j
Mr. Curry.?No sir. I desire to sav m
The Speaker, interrupting. Objection has j
been made to debate. I
Mr. Curry.?I was present when my name j <
was called and ' 1
Mr. Millson, at this point, objected to alldis
I mission, because it was out of order,
j Mr. Curry, resuming his seat, remarked:? I ; '
never violate the rules of the House. i
Mr. Davis, of Miss., wished to say that the j i
President's message has to be referred some- t t
' where, titul therefore he favored a select com- i i
mil tee. 1
Mr. Moore, of Ala., said the reason given by
, his colleague (Mr. Clopton) for not voting, was
, the same why lie would not vote.
Mr. Cobb, of Ala., remarked that the rea!
sons assigned by his colleagues were not pow:
erful enough for him, so he would hang on to
his vole in favor of the resolution. jLaughitcr-J

Mr. Miles, id S. L\, said his State was out of
the confederacy, except ilic mere form, and
I therefote her delegation took no interest in this
j ipiestion. j
IThis remark w as received with marked gofel
I hiiinnr. J

The House agreed to Mr. Sherman's original i
motion that the message be referred to the coin- I
%iittc of the whole on the stale of the Union ; t
and l?e printed, together with Mr. Bottler's
I amendment thereto, namely :?flint so much t
; of it as relates to the present perilous condition i
of the country be referred to a select committee i
of one from each Stale.
No question was not taken on any other pi a- <
position than the one above mentioned. <
Mr. ISoteler wished to say one word. He t
knew it was the universal custom of the House l
for the Speaker to appoint as chairman tlie ; I
mover of a proposition for a select committee. ;.'
lie wished it understood, in justice to himself I
and to the great objects he had in view, that he . :
could not serve on the committee, lie had no i i
idea of it. i
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, asked leave in inlro- ;
duce his resolution, (ahove printed.; as a separate
and independent proposition. i
Mr. Itullin, of North Carolina, and others, t
strenuously objected to the introduction ?11" the I
resolution. : i
Mr. Morris hoped that the objections would t
he withdrawn, so as to come to a direct vole, t
The resolution was again read. ' '
Mr. I'hclps objected to its introduction, and j I
moved an adjournment; which was carried.
Stale Convention? Letter of Ilea. Jolin I
H. I'lojtl. j '
Tu-day, we publish the letter of the lion. 1 '
John Ik Floyd, in response to one addiessrd j
to him by us. Mr. Floyd's letter derives addi- ' j
tional interest from the fact that he is a member I i
of the Cabinet from whose head has jn.sL j 1
emanated the imisJ remarkable ami miscbic- j 1
vous message ever sent by n President to Con- I ,
grrss. ' ,
The letter is one ol great force : i < 1 discusses I I
the questions at issue from tin: stand point of j
mi indent ntl'ectioii for llio Uidim of these'
States. Mr. Floyd lio'.ils the i ii^lit of sc- '
cession, though lie would not exercise it before
making further dibi ts at conciliation and liar- I
ntoiiy. |
Mr. Floyd agrees with all of the geiitleiiieti
who have written i<> u?, on the necessity for a
speedy call of a Convention of the State by
the Legislature.
We have not heard ol any man ul influence
and position in the State who does not advocate 1
the speedy call of a State Convention. 1
Washington Citv, l'e<\ :'.d, i?v>0. j
iJt.ti: Sin:?My time has been so much en- \
grossed by pressing public duties, that 1 have j
been unable until now to reply to your favor j
of the loth ultimo. | regret this all the less, :
because the time lms passed, when the counsels j
of any one can arrest the precipitate current j
of events, or avert the icsult which an exasperated
and excited public feeling at the South :
has rendered inevitable. Ihsuuioti, I fear,
cannot he prevented hv any human power.? I r
All that devoted patriotism and manly firmness
can now do, is so to control the course of
events as to keep open the way and keep alive I w
the hope for a reconstruction t.l liie Union | o;
when the wounded feelings of the South shall ' w
have been somewhat soothed and propitiated n
bv such favorable inilueiiccs as 1 trust a benig- la
nant future may have in store for the country. It
The agitation of the slavery question, which r<
has been so long and wantonly persisted in by ti
Northern men, has produced ihc sectional a
alienation which is about to find its natural j w
result in the destruction of a confederacy that ' tl
was voluntary in its origin, and can only be
perpetuated by the voluntary assent of its members.
When that amity, which is generally
found to exist even between nations foreign to
each other, ceases to exist between confederated
States; when those comities, which enlightened
nations delight to extend to each other,
arc refused to sister States by members of a
fraternal confederacy; when sectional strife
and crimination usurp the place of charity and
kindness in the hearts of a confederated
people; when hatred and defamation mark j
all the relations between neighbors and partners,
then separation becomes not only
the natural and rightful, but the inevitable resort.
The States of the South, having the
right to secede, not only from the very nature
of a federal compact, but by express reservation
on the part of some of them at the time !
of entering the Confederacy, are, in live or six
instances, preparing to secede from their Union
with partner States which have converted the
Ic'islalive branch of the Federal Government
into a mere theatre for agitating the slavery j
iiuestion?into a rostrum from which to pour ;
forth over the world denunciations and ealiiin- |
nies against their social institutions. Patrick i
Henry, one of the wisest amongst the founders j
of free institutions in this country, feared and |
predicted their overthrow by the agency of the !
Federal Government. If lie could have fore- j
.cull the use which one section of the Confcd- i
racy would make of the Houses of Congress, J
for assailing the other?employing entire ses- |
sions, to the neglect of nearly all other Lusiijcss,
in the work ol agitation?expending large ;
sinus of the public money in the publication of1
incendiary debates, and burdening the public ;
mails in distributing thousands ol iiillanimainry
speeches over ilic land, until the mere tact ol
Lhe meeting of Congress is felt l.?v :i whole
section as a public calamity?he would not
tulV have resisted the establishment of the
Federal t iovernmetil as he did, Imt he would
have defeated it at the cost of precipitating the j
country into a second revolution, before the :
. chocs of the lirst had died away.
The great danger of the present crisis con- j
sists in the fact that in our country all political |
iction is by popular movement, and all popular ;
movements, during periods of angry excite- j
meiit, are, from the nature ol things, ultra and j
.'XI re me. The dillieulty of accommodating the
differences of the two sections, while the pres- !
ent animosities continue, is, therefore, almost
insurmountable. The election of Mr. Lincoln
is the result of the ultra and violent popular
feeling of the North against the South, liewas
nominated on account of the supposed [
rancor of his hostility to slavery, lie was the !
choice of men who denounce that institution j
as "the sum ol ali villainies." His most active |
and ellicieut supporters were the men who !
signed their approval of the vulgar calumnies j
and truculent appeals of the Helper hook.?
Among his most zealous supporters were the j
fanatics who apotheosize John Brown. Ninety I
per cent, of the Northern voters in the recent >
election, denied to the .South the right of coil- !
slituliona! protection to slave property in the ,
public territories, but .Mr. Lincoln obtained!
vastly more votes than all ether candidates, I
from the fact that he went to the extreme point 1
of declaring for the complete exclusion of the I
South from all tic territories of the Union, i
It is Vain to protest now that he himself is a '
conservative man. Elected bv a powerful, fa
natical. unreasoning, reckless party, he is not j
the master of his own actions; their wiil must I
he his : his noliev theirs. Whatever Mr. Lin-i
i:oIii may l?e in reality, or may be asserted to j
lie, lie was eleftfil by the Northern masses as j
an ultra, extreme anti slavery man, a bitter !
opponent of the South. Their language to the !
Southern people was: "Mere is a man who j :
furiously hates slavery, and bitterly hates you ; :
lie hates as we hate ; therefore we elei't him In
be your President, and mean to see that you j
>ubmil to his rule." Such is the extreme icm- i
per of the Northern anti-slavery party. i
The South is now, in turn, about to assume |
her position, ller action must be taken, as a |
matter of course, by popular movement; and, I
is such iiuvcinenis, in times of excitement, :
are never conservative, her position will, of j<
course, whea taken, be as extreme as that of !<
the North. The North has set the example of | I
Joing without the South in the election of a j I
common President. The South is about an- i i
twering this by allowing them to do also with- 1 t
jut her in the Union. The people acting in j '
mass will no; stop in a crisis to draw distinc- j <
lions and split hairs, but rush headlong to ex- i 1
trcnie conclusions. The Southern people*' an- j <
iwer to the North will lie as demonstrative and ; t
lctiant, in one lirection, as the election of Mr. ; 1
Lincoln, on the part of the North, was in the '
ithcr. If all tie Southern Slates shall put it ; i
to popular vote, to say what shall he dune in ! i
the present crisis, the position of probably . {
very one of tlion will he extreme. If a few i I
ecede, and all -llbrts at reconciliation fail, ail r
aiiist sooner or later secede. Virginia would ?
lot. other border States could not, stand neu s
tral between North ami South. s
For one, lam not for secession as long as *
my honorable efi'ort can be made to preserve c
the Union on a ('institutional basis, guarantee- t
ing equality, justice and protection to the negro t
property of tlie Siutb. I shall not undertake, i
m this place, to | irtieularize all tin: measures s
jf reform and polcv which should be incorporated
into a settlement of the present dilli r- | t
i-tices between the Nnrtli and the South. I 0
cannot conceive iiow harmony can be pcrma-1 e
ncntly secured :is ioug :is Congress continues ' c
to l<c made a inert, detailing club for agitation . x
mil incendiary appeal. Tin: ads of the several I r
Northern .States, Minifying the fugitive slave 1
law, being siibver- ve of the Constitution, vio- ''
ativc of tlie plight*) faith of confederates, and i v
n conflict with the comity of States, ought to j (
>e repealed; and an amendment to the Consti- | t
.utiuii must forever prevent their re-eiiaetinent. i t
But even though the principles ol a settle- ' i
nent ?'f the present troubles could he agreed ; c
lj.on, there would be very great dilliculty in v
ooeuring their early ratification by tlie people 1
if the two section*. The Northern masses | v
:nnnot be brought at once to recede from the t
sxtreme and aggressive positions they have i
isstiniod towards tin South; while tlie South, t
.ireil of broken compromises, and smarting n
roui repeated and rever ending insult, will be a
slow and loth to accede to new compacts.? a
Moreover, every mr.nitestation by the South of i
i willingness to accept terms of reconciliation, '
s at once construed hy the North into a proof ?
>f timidity, and niaJe the occasion of new in- j
mil and injury.
I believe, however, that the great material
ntcrcsts of the country demand a reconeiliaion
of the sections, ami the preservation of the '
I'll ion; and I rely much Upon the sh?w, but
a-rtain, the silent, hut potential influence of
his great agency to bring ahout a settlement .
if our present troubles. The main study of '
ill should he to prevent any collision between
lie sections, and vno>t especially the shedding J
)f the first drop of blood. If we can hut sue- ,
reed in averting these calamities, the great,
miction!, business interests of the country
nay, perchance, sooner or later, bring nhniil a '
( -construction of the Union and a restoration i
if harmony between the sections.
It is earnestly to be hoped that these great j |
ntorosts, aided by the disinterested prompt- J
ngs of a sincere patriotism, may rise in their j
lower and with potential authority require of J '
he fanaticism of the North to abandon an :
igitation which must lead to certain and swift J
lestructioti. If this -linli he done, who can !
louht that a returning sense of coutideuco will ]
>e felt by the injured and exasperated South, j *
nd that peace and the Union will lie restored. 1
The American people are eminently practi- i J
:al in their temper and judgment, and also in ( (
heir action, when they can i?e brought to <ie- j
iberate. They must sec that nn interest?nut t
me in the whole extent of the American con- j
inent?can fail to be materially injured, nud
ome of them utterly annihilated, by a disso- |
ntiori of the Union. If there is nothing in
he majestic power of our great confederacy ;
hat can excite a feeling of just pride in the j
icarts of our people?if our self-interests have : ^
eased to value the solid advantages which ac- i
rue to all from the respect and protection that '
llow our flag over the surface of the whole ! ,
lobe?surely the desolation and misery which ! '
iie dullest apprehension must see will follow 1
ii the track of civil war, and the contempt j
rhich such an event will he certain to excite ! '
ir its in the mind of ail Europe, ought at least j 1
n prompt to a careful and wise deliberation 3
efure a feud is commenced which shall beotne
irreconcilable. '
The South should remember, that in di>soIv- c
ig the Union she annihilates a mighty army : 1
f true, unselfish and devoted friends at the a
forth, who battle forever lor the o ristitulional 0
ights of the slave States. Without this great
nd efficient aid, the power of abolition fanatiism
would lie unbroken and unchecked?.
ould indeed ' surround the South with a wall '
f lire." It would do more. New England
ould consort with old England in devj.-ing
leans by which the cruel and inhuman phinthropy
practised by the latter in the West
idia islands should be repeated here. That
digious zeal which turned away from all ra- ''
onal hope of progress in Christian faith half
million of Africans to the savageism of fetish <
orship, and converted the fairest islands of,
ic sea into a desert and a waste?that Euglish ' e
justice which seized upon a thousand millions .
of her subjects' property and vaunted herself ;
before the world for having paid one-tenth of j
its value?would find surely and speedily am- j
pie room, in conjunction with New England |
abolitionism, for the practice of her pharisaical
virtues amidst the fields of Virginia and Lou- >
isiana. If the hate of New England Abolition- j
isls to the South is sleepless and malignant? '
if they hope by fraud and indirection, by agi- |
tation and theft, to harrass the South and to i
impair the security and value of her slave pro- i
perty?all combined would, in my belief, be i
justice, honesty and fair dealing compared with j
the inexorable hate and majestic fanaticism of |
England directed against the slavery of a dis- |
mcuibcred Union and a feared and hated com- ;
mercial rival. I
Twenty-five years more of Union and har- >
moti3' will concentrate the controlling couiiner- i
cial power of the world in the waters of New
Vork. Then, the decline of England becomes
as certain as was that of Alexandria and Yenice,
and for the same cause. Instead of the :
first, she becomes a third rate European power.
Hut let disunion take place?let civil war
ana utscoru instruct mis conn try, anu r.ngianu
well knows that the ships of the North tnust
rot at their wharves, unci the busy hum of
their manufactories must cease forever. Then,
indeed, would England feel again that she was
mistress of the seas without a rival, secure in a
commerce that no power could ever shake.
It is a fatal error to suppose that the interest
of England would prompt her to foster the
planting interests of the South. From the !
I'rinee Consort, who sat silently by and witnessed
the deliberate insult of an American
minister by a British peer before the congregated
intelligence of all Christendom, simply
because slavery existed in the United States,
down to the wretched Cockney himself, forty
times the slave to suffering, and circumstances
beyond what any negro is to law?there is not
an Englishman who does not in his heart abhor
slavery, if he does not also abhor the country
where it exists. England will have margin
enough to supply her wants for cotton, even
with a large diminution of our present production?if
the demand of the North for it is cut
off', as it would be by disunion and civil war.
But England, safe in her commercial ascendancy,
does not always follow that line of
policy which others might think conducive
to her interest. She sacrifices much and largely
to gratify a hatred, to vindicate a blunder,
or cater, to ascntiment. Without caring much
about the opinions of others, she values very
highly her own, and with a laudable desire to
appear righteous in her own eyes, perpetrates
any act of cruelty or oppression, under the
pious pretence of evangelizing and civilizing
the heathen, or reforming the heresies of the
Christian. She ravages China because they
unwittingly brutalize their nation by eating
opium. She desolates India because that he- !
mghled people are averse to rendering Hp their
independence and their rupees in exchange for j
Bibles and a crushing military despotism. But
it is not the Mongol or Tartar race alone that
experience the tender mercies of England in en- j
forcing the blessings of liberty and the saving
grace of the Thirty Nine Articles. It is in vain
that Ireland points to the illustrious pages of
history?English lii.slor.v---enacted by her sons, i
It is in vain that the most renowned periods of
her senatorial fame Imvo drawn their peculiar I
lustre from the genius of Ireland, or that the <
topmost rounds of her military celebrity have '
been reached under the leadership of the same
race ; neither of these considerations, nor all <
combined, have been able to save that unfortu- '
nate nation from a perpetual impalement, coin- <
pared with which, the worst forms of African \ j
slavery arc mercy and a blessing. A few . '
years ago, only a few years age, England, |
with her mighty resources, with that em- i i
[ ire upon which the sun in his daily i
course, it is boasted, never ceases to shine, '
stood a calm spectator from her own hap- '
dv shores and looked with Christian com- 1
plaoency across the Irish Channel at the tor- [ '
Lure of their people writhing in the agony of
narration ; a tnilliori of whom, it is computed, 1
lieil from famine, ami its accompanying "
liseascs. I hiring this period, Knglish "phi- >
anthropy fouml emissaries and moans enough *
:o dispatch to America for the purpose of stir- o
ing up the spirit of abolitionism, to overthrow j ?
.he Union, and incite the negro to insurrection. 1 >
flic shrieks of famishing multitudes of her '1
?wn subjects, have never pierced the heart of '
m gland like the fancied wrongs of the Afri- j d
an race in the cotton fields of the South? *'J
Imugh it may he truly asserted, that no slave ; ri
las ever died of starvation on our continent. | *'
The South can never count upon the friend- I "
hip of Kngland or upon her toleration of evils ;
int.her own. ('nee within the reach of her le
lower, slus will lix upon us forever the very : 'I
mdge of inferiority which we are now J re
eady to destroy the Union to escape;! in
aid vviil foster our products so far, and i w
o far only, as may be absolutely neees
ary to supply her wants. Kngland hi
rotild insist upon making gooi] her re- to
:ord upon the slavery* question. To sacrifice si
he interests of a class, or even to starve to in
leath a few hundred thousands of her subjects pi
n the laudable task, would constitute a very to
mall obstacle to her policy. ar
Hut with all these consequences attending in
he measure of disunion, and multitudinous
ithers, which readily occur to every mind, no g<
iption i.s left now but, either to choose to en- mi
ounter them or to secure those guarantees pf
rhich must stop at once and forever the ag- m
jrcssions and agitation to which the Nurth has st
teen so long addicted, on the subject of slave- g'
y. AVith proper guarantees of this sort, el
vhich could be given by amendments to the ! ti'
'onstitulion, we may goon in a happy and cor- j tj
lial Union, made so from a miitualilv of peeu- j I'*1
liarv interests, and a consciousness which ! {!'
inion will give us of power to maintain all ! th
air rights and command the respect of the ; ai
vorld. w
I am of opinion that the Legislature of Vir- :'|
;inia should immediately call a convention of t'1
he people of the State with a view of referrne
all these momentous questions to the arl. i- se
ratnent of a convention of all the Slates, such j
is is provided for in the Federal Constitution, : e:
ind that, in the meantime, Virginia should use i m
ill her influence to culm the exasperated feel- j lungs
of the country and to prevent, if possi- u<

I regret exceedingly that 1 will not be able
to attend the session of the College to vote in
accordance with the wishes of those who elected
me, for John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky,
for President, and Joseph Lane, of Oregon, tor
Vico President. Please communicate these
facts to the Electoral College.
With kind regards to yourself and family, j

The Chairman also announced, thnt lie lia-l
received :i printed circular, signed Mercurv, and
dated from Washington.
On motion >>| Mr. Jackson, tin* reading of the

"The i>rimtinj moth> authnri/xd by the f'oit- 1

a President and a Vice President of the United
Stales. The announcements of newspapers and
other authorities, giving to each candidaic a
certain tuiinber of rlerturn/ i o'< j, and casting
up a majority in favor of 11 particular candidate,
is premature. The electoral votes have not yet
been given, and conse'|UCiilly lliere is no election
of President ami Vice-President consummated,
nor cm Id it ever he done without the
intervention, the agency, and the delegated option,
the salutary discretion, "I the Electors

"The Akticlk II of the Constitution says

iresentlv lie seen, after I ipiote, in part, the v_
intendment to the ahove clause, whtch savs:
"'The Electors shall mi el ::? their respec- |I(

"These provisions, independent of other mat- H
