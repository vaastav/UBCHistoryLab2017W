The Daily Commonwealth gave its readers yes
terday afternoon President Wilson's complete a
message to Congress, which was delivered at one
o'clock on that day. The Memphis News-Scimi
tar only gave its readers a half column news item !
about the message, and the Commercial Appeal
published the address this morning. That's the
difference between a real live afternoon paper and
the less progressive ones-and the difference, j
from a news service standpoint, between the up-|
to- date afternoon newspaper and the morning as
publication, is so largely in favor of the former ;
that comparison is ridiculous.
