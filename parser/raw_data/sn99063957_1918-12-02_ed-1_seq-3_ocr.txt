' The president's speech followfi
Gentlemen of the congress:
The year that has elapsed since I lust
stood before you to fulfill my const
tutioual duty t0 give to the congress
from time to time information of the
state of the union, has been so crowded
with great events, great processes and
ereat results that I cannot hone to civo
jbil 'an adHiiatdr picture 'it its trans-':
actions, or if the far-reaching changes
whiah have been wrought in the life of
our nation and of the world. You have
yourselves witnessed these things as 1
lave. It is too soon' to assess them;
and we who stand in the midst of thorn
and are part of them are less quilified
than men of another generation will
be to say what they mean, or even
Tihat tliey have been. But some great
outstanding facts are unmistakable and
constitute, in a sense, part of the pup
lie business with which it is our duty
to deal. To state them is to set tho
stage for the legislative and executive
action which must grow out of them
arid which we have yet to shape and
determine. "
, Comparatively Small Losses.
A year ago wo had sent 145,918 men
overseas. Since then we have sent 1,-
950,513, an average of 162,542 each
complete, more thorough, in method and
effective in result, more spirited and
unanimous in purpose and effort than
any other great belligerent had been
able to effoct. We profited greatly by
the experience of tho nations which had
already been engaged for nearly three
years in exigent and exacting business,
their every resource and every execu
tive proficiency taxedt o the utmost
We were their pupils, but w learnod
quickly mid acted with a promptness
and a readiness that justify our great
pride that we were able to serve tho
world with unparalleled energy and
quick accomplishment.
Braises Fighting Men.
But it is not the physical, Bcalo and
executive officioncy of preparation,
supply, equipment and despatch that I
would dwell upon but the mettle and
quality of tho officers and men we sent
over and of tho sailors who keep tho
seas, and the spirit of the nation that
stood, behind them. No soldiers or
sailors, ever proved tbomsclvea more
quickly ready for the test of the battle
or acquitted themselves with more
splendid jouragc and anshlovemonn wnen
put to the tost. Those of us who played
some part in dirocting the, great, pro
cesses by which tho war was pushed ir
resistibly forward to the final tri
umph may now forget all that and de
light our thoughts with the story of
what our men did. Their officers un
derstood the grim and exacting task
they had undertaken and they perform
ed them with an exactitudo and unhes
itating courage that touch the story
of convoy and battle with imporisha'blo
distinction at every turn, whether the
enterprise- wore groat or small from
their great chiefs, Pershing and SimJ)
down to the youngest lieutenants; and
their men were worthy of them such
men as hardly need to be commanded
and go to their torrible adventure
blithely and with the quick Intelligence
of those who know just what it is they
would accomplish, I am proud to bo
the fellow countryman of men of such
stuff and valour. Those of .us who

May -test, to 245,951, in June to 278,- stayed at home did our duty; the war

to reach similar figures in August andlant men who fought it given their op-
fieptember in August 289,570 and in
Beptember 257,438; No such movement
of troops ever before took place, across
three thousand miles of soa, followed
by adequate equipment and supplies
and carried safely through extraordi
nary dangers of attack dangers which
were alike strange and infinitely diffi
cult to guard against. In all this move
ment, only seven hundred and fifty-
cigtht men woro lost by enemy attack
--six hundred and thirty of whom were
upon a single English transport which
was sunk near the Orkney Islands,' .

I need not toll you what lay back of
this great movement of mm and ma

many a long day we shall think our
selves "accurs'd we were not there and
hold our manhood cheap while any
speaks that fought" with these at St,

those days of triumphant battle will go
with these fortunato men to their
graves; and each will have his favorite
memory. !
"Old men forget; yet all shall be for

- What we all thank God for with
doepest gratitude is that our men wenf

And throughout it all how fine tho
spirit of the nation was; what unity
of purpose, what untiring zeal!
What leaven of purpose ran through
all its splendid display of strength, its
untiring accomplishment., I have said
that those of us wfto stayed at homo

labour; but we can never be ashamed.
It has been an inspiring thing to be
here in the midst of fine men who had
turned aside from every private inter
est of their own and devoted the whole
of their trained capacity to the tasks
that supplied the sinews of the whole
great undertaking.
The patriotism, the unselfishness, thy
thoroughgoing devotion and disting

and comrades of the men in the trench

were to bo obtained and prepared, iu

'was needed to sustain the battle lines,
men have vied with each other to dc

The Tasks of Peace v
And, now we are sure of the great
triumphs for which every sacrifice w.i--
mado. It has come, come in its com
pleteness, and with the pride and in
spiration of these days of achievement
quick within us we turn to the tasks
of peace again; a peace secure against
the violence of irresponsible monarchy
and ambitious militaries coteries aud
mado rbudy for a new order, for new
foundations .of justice and fair 'deal
in. ,
We are about to give order and or
ganization to this peace not only for
ourselves, but for the other peoples of
tho world as well, so far as they will
suffer us to secure them. It is inter
national justice that we seek, not doi
mestic safety merely. Our thoughts
have dwelt of late upon Europe, upon
Asia, upon the near and the far east
very little upon acts of peace and ac
commodation that wait to be performed
at our own doors. While we are ad
justing our relations with the rest ol
the world, it is of capital importance
that we shoul clear away all ground-)
of misunderstanding with our imme
diate neighbors and give proof of the
firendahip we really fecit I hope that
the members of the senate will permit
me to speak once more of the unratified
treaty of friendship and adjustment
with the republic of Colombia. 1 very
earnestly, urge upon them an early and
favorable action upon that vital mat
ter. I believe that they will feel, with
me, that the stage of affairs is now set
for such action as will be not only just
but generous and in the spirit of the
new age upon which we have so hap
pily entered.
Bo far as our domestic affairs are
concerned, the problem of our return
to peace is a problem of economic and
industrial readjustment. That prob
lem is less serious for us than it may
turn out to be for the nations which
have suffered the disarrangements and
the losses of war longer than we. Our
people, moreover, do not wait to be
coached and led. They know their own
business, are quick and resourceful at
every readjustment, definte in purpose,
and self reliant in action.
Any loading strings we might seek
to put them in w.oid epeeai.y reeome
hopelessly tangled because they would
pay no attention to them and go their
own way. All that we can do as their
legislative and executive servants is to
mediate the process of change here,
there and elsewhere as we may. I have
heard much counsel as tu'the plans that
shoid bo formed u'd personally con
ducted to a happy consummation, but
from no quarter hai I seen any get
eral scheme of ' reconstruction"
emerge which I thought it likely we
could force out spirircd business men
and self-reliant laborers to accept with
duo pliancy and obedience.
While the war lasted we set up many
agencies by which to direct the indus
tries of the country in the services it
was necessary for them lo render, by
which to make sure .of an abundant
i supply of the materials nueded, by
which to check undertakings that could
for the. time be dispensed -with and
stimulate those that wore most serv;
iceable in the war, by vhieh to gain
for the purchasing departments of the
government a certain control over the
prices of essential articles and mater
ials, by which to restrain trade with
alien enemies, make the Most of the
available shipping and -tystematize fi
nancial transactions, both public and
private, so that there would be no. un
necessary, conflict or confusion by
which, in short, to 'put every material
energy of tho country in harness to
draw the common load and make us
one team in the accomplishment of a
great task. But the moment , we knew
the armistice- to havo been signed, we
took the harness off. P.aw materials
upon which the government had kept
its hand on for fear there should not be
enough for the industries ihut supplied
the armies, have been released aud put
into the general market, r.gain. Great
industrial plants whose -whole output
and machinery has beon . tr.kcn over
for the uses of the government have
been set free to return to the uses to
which they were put before the war
It has. not been possible tj remove so
readily or so quickly, Hha control of
foodstuffs and of shipping, because
the world ha still to be fed from our
granaries and the shipf are still need
ed to send supplies t our men over
seas and to bring the men back as fast
as the disturbed conditions on the fill
er isido of the water 'permit; but even
the restraints are being relaxed as
much as possible and-more and more
as the weeks go by.

to the very practical plans which the
secretary of the interior has developed
in his annual report and before your
committee for tho reclamation of arid,
swamp and cut over lands which might

land for cultivation. Thero ore said to

land in tho west, at present arid, for
whose reclamation water i available,

two hundred and thirty m'liion acres
from which the forests lave been eut

for the plow and which lie waste ond

million acres of land thnt lie under
