well afford to le without the amount ol
pood reading for thit insignificant mm,
We truit each of our reader will oblige ti
by calling the a'tontion of their neighbor
to this offer.

Death of Horace Greeley.
Political prejudices are lnid nsiJc nnd
tho people o? tho Vnitcd State to-d.iy
mourn thedeath of one of their moat prom
inent citizens. Mr. Grkeley died at ten
ni in u tea before seven o'clock, V. on laat
Friday, nnd was buried on Wednesday, the
fourth inst., with the largest funeral de
monstration since the death of President
Lincoln. Flags were at half mast in
this place, also throughout the country.
Vi'e had partially prepared some ulogies
from the daily press for this issue, but
pace will not admit this week.
Message and Department Reports.
We trust our readers will appreciate our
efforts tht week to lay before them the
raimvl amount of reading matter, besides the
President's Message and all the Pepart
m ?nt Report-. So far the message . has
failed to elicit criticism from the opponents
of President Grant, but on tlte contrary in
complimented. The Cincinnati CommT
aviX says in reg-.vrd to it : ,:Upon the whole,
this document will commend itself to the
people, as one in which the faults arc not
prominent, and which is becomingly considerate."
The Electoral College.
The Presidential College consists of 3i6
members; necessary to a choice, The
Hiate Colleges voted respectively at the
State capitols on Wednesday, and a special
messenger from each was sent to Washing
ton with the result, where Congrese counts
the votes and proclaims the result.
Considerable discussion has been indulg
ed in since the death of Mr. Gkeelev, re
garding the duty of the Greeley Electors
to their constituent. It secra to have not
been definitely decided, as the votes are
scattering. Tennessee cast her vote for
IlEy-uniCKS, of Indiana, for President, and
15. Ghatz Brown for Vice-President.
tlriforgt voted as follows : For President
If. Uhatz Brown C, Horace Greeley 3,
Charles Jevkis?, of Georgia, 2. For

Our New County Commissioners.
On Momlay nioming last the two Cottntr
Commissionant elect filed acceptable bonds,

the UTschrga of their duties. The law
provide for one Commiaaioner to he elect
ed annually, that there may Tie at all times
two cxpsrienced moraber left on the
Board; but the death of the lute Ebf.r
"VtXTJMcauicd a Tacancy which made it
nccesary to elect two members of the
Board at tho O.-tober election. In such
' oases tho law provides that the candidate
. receiving tha highest vote will be entitled
to the long term. This givos Capt. E. A.
WiLSosf tha long term and. J. II. Pierce,
isil; tlte short term. Tlte Board, as now
composed, is R. W. Kellby, E. A. Wil

with the provieions of the bill, aays It "tn
drawn up witb ear and jndgoment, and in
many datsils would be an improrement on tli
present law," and cocsmsnt as follow upon

"Tb bill maka, hewertr, on great miltak.
It perpetuates the uib-distrlots whioh har son
atltuled tk greateat aril of Ilia iireaent common
school sjatem of Ohio. Bin 18J3, oulsid of
eitie sod larg town, the township ha been
recognised aa tb ichoot district. The township
Hoard of Education ha had the moat lm ertant
functions, suprriing nd controlling, in many
respest, the aub-diatrict. Lpnn an arersgs
each tnwnahip in Ohia is dirided into eight au
sclinol districts. Eh tub-diatriet eleoti tbre

or true Hoard of EJnca inn.
This Board mar prescribe ml for th aolioot
or the whole diatri Jl, appoint one ot tnsir mem

Tber mar chaaga tha aub diatrieta, locate
new cbool-houses,l'y taxes for building them,
and apportion tha school moneys. Hut the local
Directors employ and diimiss teachera, and
mike th contrast for building, and all other
rxpenditnre. Of course, between thai too
power ther mnst be conetant conflict. For
nearly twenty year th State Cnmmisaionert
liar dernted a larg part of their labor to tb
aetllement of the diaputa thai bar artaen all
orer th Slat between Board of Edueatiou and
tha local Directors. Alany lin:es th querrels
hare been earned Into the courts. The energies
uf sobool officers, whicb ought t har bo de
roted tn the improrement of aehonl, har been
waeted in ware which this banglingarstam ni.kei
iueritabl. Cemmiasioner hare recommended
th tnwnahip ayatem. Tb Ohio Taehera' Aa
aociation bar repeatedly prenoun-ed againat
the aub districts. The Intelligence of the State
is'npposed to them. Let them be aheliahad.
The sub-districts are easentially wrong io
principle. Th intelligence and publia apirit
naeded in a tohool board ia not erenly dirided
among all the little neighborhood of a towaahip.
No tnwnahip I so large but that th geod men
thoae who are tit to manage sohool aflairs ar
known by all th eitiians. Irft th to lea nf the
whole tnwnahip make th elections ; let their ag
gregate intelligence bar a chanoe to cbooae th
beat men. It ia a towuakip'a butaineaa, and
ought not to be controlled, a It frequently
ghl not to t eontrollerl. a. It frequently i
w. br family ennaid.ra'.ton. or petty ."it. or
jealousies.
In th bill, a drat introduced by Mr. Taft,
tli needed reform wa partly provided for by
reducing tb number of local Director and in
creating th power nf Hoards of Education ;
but in th amended bill even this mush is ur
rendered. This surrender era owing tn th op
position nf th counter memHera. Tb litil
rings, that grov as Nat in the country as in th
itv, snt up a cry. Ilepreaentatirta look warn
ing, aod this important provision was struck out
of the bill. At the sppmaching sessiao, wh'n

township srsteia be adapted. Thle will do
nor to advance th intereeta of th common
ehonl of Ohio than th adoption of all tli

Speaking of Obiiit' tnrts at reform, th

On Tueilay last th Cincinnati Cammereinl
mad the following peculiar stalement for that
paper : "There U just one gn.l us tn whi h

bar turned their attention tn physiaitoi and

on the charge of depositing io th Unittd Stat, s

This ia the first ease of th kind brought be
