President's Message.
To-day we lay before our read
ers the President's Message to
Congress. For want of time and
space, we cannot make any com
ments upon it, farther than to
say that it is a very sensible,
straight-forward and satisfactory
document. We ask for it a close
and attentive reading.
NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
TION.
Thc Secretary of the National
Republican Executive Committee
has issued a call to have a meeting
of that committee at Washington,
on the 11th day of January, to de
cide when and where the next Re
publican Presidential Convention
shall be held.
FIRE IN ENGLAND.
A Cable dispatch announces a dis
astrous fire at. Warwick Castle, in
England, by which an irreparable
loss to the antiquary occurred
through the destruction of old ar
mor, paintings, furniture, &c The
great hall is particularly mentioned
as having suffered. The baronial
hall in Warwick Castle is of great
size and antiquity, and retained its
old furniture, affording, an accurate
picture of mediaeval domestic life.
FIRE IN ENGLAND. BAD FOR THE POLICE.
Mr. Garner, of Deleware, who
was Knocked m the nead witu a
hatchet and stabbed, is still livin
The police dont seem to be worth
much. Not long ago three persons
drove into Columbus in a carriage,
and on one of the most public
thoroughfares, and in the presence
of fifty persons, perpetrated a most
foul outrage, and tried to do worse,
but never since that time have citb
cr the police or city authorities been
able to tell who those scoundrels
were.
CUBAN AFFAIRS.
Although officials refused to give
information is certain that a crisis
has arisen in connection, with Cuban
affairs which the Cabinet'was espec
ially summoned to consider. The
King presided at the meeting, pro
ducing a profound sensation by pro
posing pert onally to proceed to Cu
ba to direct pacifactory measures in
the Island. It is generally believed
the result of the meeting of King
and Cabinet was to convoke the
Cortes in extra sessjen tc provide
means to Crush the insurrection.
The excitement is very great, and
sympathy is expressed for the gov
ernment, even the late ministers
proffering their support to the pres
ent ministry.
MORAL COURAGE.
There is one navy officer who
does not drink and his name is
Smith. Admiral Smith gave an en
tertainment upon ship board to the
Duke Alexis, and not a drop of any
thing that could intoxicate was serv
ed, though, the refreshments were
very elaborate and expensive. That
was true moral courage. It requires
sometimes, more courage to meet
and combat fashion, than to meet a
cast-iron foe. Something to drink
is so much a matter of course in
fashionable circles, and emphatical
ly so in military and naval circles,
that that officer who has the stamina
to fly in the face of the drinking
custom, is entitled to as much cred
it as one who meets and defies an
armed foe, and he should be ranked
among the tried heroes.

MESSAGE
OF THE
President of the United States.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4, 1871.
The following is the President's
message, just transmitted to Con
gress:
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS.
To the Senate and Home of Representatives:
In addressing my third annual
message to the law-making branch
of the Government, it i3 gratifying
to be able to state that during the
past year success has generally at
tended the effort to execute all laws
found upon the statute-books. The
policy has been not to inquire into
the wisdom of the laws already en
acted, but to learn their spirit and
intent and to enforce them accordingly.
DISASTERS BY STORM AND FIRE.
The past year has, under a wise
Providence, been one of general
prosperity to the nation. It has,
however, been attended with more
than usual chastiscments.in the loss
of life and property by storm and
fire. These disasters have served
to call forth the best elements of
human nature in our country, and
develop a friendship for us on the.
part of foreign nations which goes
far toward alleviating the distresses
occasioned by these calamities. The
benevolent who has so generously
shared their means with the victims
of these misfortunes, will reap their
reward in the consciousness of hav
ing performed a noble act, and in
receiving the greatful thanks of men,
women and children whose suffer
ings they have relieved.
OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS.
The relations of the United States
with foreign powers continue to be
lriendiy. ihe year has oeen a
eventful onc,iu witnessing two great
nations, speaking one language and
having one lincagc.sctling by peace
ful arbitration dispute of long stand
ing, and liable at any time to bring
those nations into bloody and cost
ly connicL An example has thus
been set which, if successful in its
final issuc,may be followed by other
civilized nations, and finally be the
means of rcturmn to productive
industry millions of men now
mantaincd to settle the disputcsjof
nations by the bayonet and the
Droadsiuc. "
TREATY OF WASHINGTON.
I transmit -herewith a copy of the
treaty alluded to, which has been con
eluded since the adjournment of
Congress with Her Britannic Ma
jesty, and a copy of the Protocols of
the conferences ot the Commission
ers by whom it was negotiated
This treaty provides methods for
adjusting the questions pending be
tween the two nations. Various
questions are to bo adjusted by ar
bitration. I reccommend Congress
at an early day to make the neces
sary provision for the tribunal at
Uencva,and for several commissions
on the part of the United States
called for by the treaty. His Ma
jesty, the king of Italy, the Presi
dent of Swiss Confederation and
His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil,
have each consented, on the joint
request ot the two powers, to name
an arbitrator for the tribunal at Gen
eva. I have caused my thanks to
be suitably expressed for the readi
ness with which the joint request
has been complied with by the ap
pointmcnt ofgentlenjcn of eminence
and learning to these important po
sitions. His Majesty, the Emper
or of Germany, has been1 pleased to
comply with the two governments,
and has consented to act as the ar
bitrator of the disputed water boun
dary between the United States and
Great Britain. The contracting
parties in the treaty have underta
ken to regard as between themselves
certain principles of public law for
wnicn tne united btatcs have con
tended from the commencement of
their history. They have also
agreed to bring these principles to
the knowledge of the other mari
time powers, and to invite them to
accede to them. Negotiations are
going on as to the form of the mode
by which the invitation is to be ex
tended to the powers. I recommend
the legislation necessary on the part
of the United States to bring into
operation the articles of the treaty
relating to the fisheries and to the
matters touching the relations of the
United States toward the British
North American provinces, to be
come operative-as soon as the Dron-
er legislation shall be had on the
part of Great Britain and its pos
sessions, as it is much to be desired
that this legislation may become op
erative before the fishermen of the
United States begin to make their
arrangements lor the coming season.
I have addressed a communication
of which a copy is transmitted here
with, to the Governors of New York
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana. Michi
gan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging
upon me viovernments ot those
States respectively the necessary ac
tion on their part to carry into ef
fect the object of the article
of the treaty which contem
plates the use of the canals on either
side connected with the navigation
of the lakes and rivers forming the
boundary, on terms of equality by
me innauiiants oi both countries,
It is hoped that the importance of
tne object and the benefits to flow
therefrom will secure the speedy ap
proval and legislative sanction of
the States concerned.
THE FORTY NINTH PARALLEL.
I renew the recommendation for
an appropriation to determine the
true position of the forty-ninth par
allel of latitude, where it forms the
boundaiy between United States
and the British North American
provinces, between the Lake of the
Woods and the summit of the Rocky
Mountains. The early action of
congress on this recomendation
would put it in the power of War
Department to place a force in the
held during the next summer.
WITHDRAWAL OF PROTECTION TO GERMANS
IN FRANCE.
The resumption of diplomatic re
lations between France and Ger-
man-, have enabled me to give di
rections for the withdrawal of the
protection extended to Germans in
France, by the diplomatic and con
sular representatives of the United
States in that country. It is just
to add that the delicate duty of this
protection has been performed by
the Minister and the Consul Gener
al at Paris and the various Consuls
in France, under the supervision
of the latter, with great kindness as
well as with prudence and tact.
1 heir course has received the com
mendation of the German Govern
ment, and has wounded no suscepti
bility ol the French.
GERMANY STILL FRIENDLY.
Tim finvm-nment of the Emncror
of Germany continues to manucst
a friendly feeling towards the Uni
ted states, and a desire to narmon-
: with the moderate and just
policy which this Government main
tains in its relations with the Asi
atic powers, as well as with South
American Republics. I have given
assurance that the friendly feelings
of that Government are fully shared
by the United -States.
The ratinicauons oi me consular
and naturalization conventions with
the Austro-Hungarian Empire have
becm exchanged.
ITALY.
I have been officially informed of
the annexation of the States of the
Church to the Kingdom of Italy,'
and the removal of the capital of
that kingdom to .Rome. In con
formity with the established policy
of the United States, I have recog
nized this change. The ratifications
of the new treaty of commerce be
tween the united bates and Italy
have been exchanged. The two
powers have agreed in this treaty
that private property at sea shall be
respected during a war between the
two powers. The United States
have spared no opportunity of in
corporating this rule into the obli
gation of nations.
CLAIMS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
AGAINST SPAIN.
The forty-first Congress, at its
third session,made an appropriation
for the organization of a mixed com
mission for adjudicating upon the
claims of . citizens of the United
States against Spain, growing out
of insurrection in Cuba. That com
mission has since been organized. I
transmit herewith the correspond
ence relating to its formation and
its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped
that this commission will afford the
claimants a complete remedy for
their injuries,
RESTORATION OF PEACE BETWEEN
SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICA.
It has been made the agreeable
duty of the United States to pre
side over a conference at Washing
ton between the plenipotentiaries of
bpain and the allied bouth Amen
can Republics, which has resulted
in an arm is tic with the reasonable
assurance of a permanent peace,
RUSSIA—THE GRAND DUKE—CATACAZY.
The. intimate friendly relations
which have so long existed between
the United States and Russia contin
ue undisturbed., The visit of the
third son of the Emperor is a proof
that there is no desire on the part of
his government to ucminish the
cordiality of these relations. The
hospitable reception which has been
given to the Grand JJuke is proof
that on .our share the' wishes of that
government. The inexcusable
course of the Russian Minister, at
Washington rendered it necessary
to ask his recall, and to decline to
decline to longer receive that func
tionary as a diplomatic representa
tive. It was impossible with self-respect,!
or with a just regard to the
dignity of the country, to permit
Mr- Uatacazy to continue to hold
intercourse with this Government.
officials and during his persistent
interference through various means
with the relations between the Uni-
ed States and other powers. In ac
cordance with my wishes, this Gov
ernment has been relieved of fur
thers intercourse with Mr. Cataca
zy, and the management of the af
fairs ol the Imperial Legation has
passed into the hands of a gentle
man entirely unobjectionable.
OUR INTERCOURSE WITH JAPAN.
With Japan we continue to main
tain intimate relations. The Cab
inet of the Mikado has, since the
close of the last session of Congress,
selected citizens of the United States
to serve in offices of importance in
several departments of the Govern
ment. I have reason to think that
this selection is due to an apprecia
tion ot the disinterestedness of the
policy which the United States have
pursued towards. Japan. It is our
desire to. continue to maintain this
disinterested and just policy with
China as well, as Japan. The cor
respondence transmitted herewith
shows that there is no disposition
on the part of this Government to
swerve from its established course.
THE WAR WITH COREA.
Prompted by a desire to put an
end to the barbarous treatment of
our shiwwrecked sailors on the Cor-
ean coast, I instructed our Minister
at Pekin to endeavor to conclude
convention with Corea for securing
tne saiety ana humane treatment ol
such mariners. Admiral Rogers was
instructed to accompany him with
sufficient force to protect him in case
of need. A small surveying party
sent out, on reaching the coast, was
treacherously attacked at a disad
vantage. Ample opportunity was
given for explanation and apology
lortnemsuit. JNeituercame. Alorce
then landed, and after an arduous
march over a rugged and difficult
country, the forts from which the
outrages were committed were re
duccd by a gallant assault, and were
destroyed. Having thus punished
the criminals, and having vindicated
the honor ot the uag, the expedition
returned, finding it impossible under
the circumstances to conclude the
desired convention. I respectfully
refer to the correspondence relating
thereto herewith submitted, and
leave the subject for such action as
Congress may see fit to take.
THE MEXICAN FREE ZONE.
The Republic of Mexico has not
repealed the very objectionable laws
established, relative to what is
known as the Free Zone, on the
frentier of the United States. It is
hoped that this may yet be done.
and that more stringent measures
may be taken by the Republic for
restraining lawless persons on its
frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by
its own action, will soon relieve this
Government of the difficulties ex
perienced from these causes.
THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS.
Our relations with the various
Republics of Central and South
America continues, with one excep
tion, to be cordial and friendly. I
recommend some action by Congress
regarding the overdue installments
under the award of the Venezuela
Claims Commission of I860. The
internal dissensions of this govern
ment present no justification for
their absence of effort to meet their
solemn treaty obligations. The rati
fication of an extradition treaty with
Nicarauga has been exchanged.
EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES IN BRAZIL.
It is a subject for congratulation
that the great Empire of Brazil has
taken the initiatory step towards the
abolition, of slavery. Our relations
with that Empire, always cordial,
will naturally be made more so by
this act. It is not too much to hope
that the government of Brazil-may
hereafter find it for ,its interest, as
well as intrinsically right, to ad
vance towards entire emancipation
more rapidly than the present at
tempt contemplates. The true pros
perity and greatness of a nation is
to be found in the elevation and ed
ucation of its laborers. It is a sub
ject for regret that the reforms in
.. . i! iY. i !. ;.i i..
inis uireciion wuicii were yuiuuuu-
ily promised by the statesmen of
bpain have not been carried out in
its West India colonies. The laws
and regulations for the apparent
abolition of slavery in Cuba and
Porto Rico leave most of the labor
ers in bondage with no hope or re
lease until their lives become unbur
den to their employers.
AMERICAN CITIZENS OWNING SLAVES
ABROAD.
I desire to direct your attention
to the fact that citizens of the Uni
ted States, or person claimiug to
be citizens of the United States, are
large holders in foreign lands of
this species of property, forbidden
by fundamental law of their alleged
country. I recommend to Congress
to provide by stringent legislation a
suitable remedy against the hoiam:
owning or dealing in slaves or being
interested in slave property in for
eign lands, either as owners, heirs
or mortgages by citizens ortheUm
ted States.
THE CUBAN INSURRECTION.
It is to be regretted that the dis
turbed condition of the Island of
Cuba continues to be a source of
annoyance and of anxiety. The ex
istence ot a protracted" struggle in
such close proximity to our own ter
ritory, without apparent prospect of
an early termination, cannot be oth
er than an object of concern to a
people who, while abstaining from
interference in the affairs ol other
powers, naturally desire to see every
country m the undisturbed enjoy
ment of peace, prosperity and the
blessings of free institutions. Our
naval commanders in Cuban waters
have been instructed, in case it
shonld become necessary, to spare
no effort to protect the lives and
property of bona fide American cit
izens, and to maintain the dignity
of the flag. It is hoped that all
pending questions with Spain grow
ing out of the affairs in Cuba may
be adjusted in the spirit- of peace
and condition which has hitherto
guided the two powers in their treat
ment ol such questions.
EDUCATION OF AMERICAN YOUTH FOR
DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN CHINA AND
JAPAN RECOMMENDED.
To give importance and to add .to
the efficiency ot our diplomatic re
lations with Japan and China, and
to further aid in retaining the good
opinion of these people, and to se
cure to the United States its share
of the commerce destined to flow
between those nations and the bal
ance of the commercial world, 1
earnestly recommend that an appro
priation be made to support at least
four American youths in each of
these countries, to serve as a part of
the official family of our ministers
there. Oar representatives would
not even then be placed upon an
equality with the representatives of
Great Britain and of some other
powers. As now situated, our rep
resentatives in Japan and China
have to depend for interpreters,who
know our language imperfectly, or
procure for the occasion the services
of employees in foreign business
houses, or the Interpreters to other
foreign Ministers. I would also
recommend liberal measures for the
purpose of supporting the American
lines of steamers now plying be
tween San Francisco and Japan and
China, and the Australian line, al
most our only remaining lines of
ocean steamers, and ol increasing
their services.
THE NATIONAL DEBT.
Has been reduced to the extent of
eighty-six millions, fifty-seven thou
sand, one hundred and twenty six
dollars and eighty cents during the
year, and by the negotiation of na
tional bonds at a lower rate of in
terest, the interest on the public
debt has becu so far diminished
that now the sum to be raised for
interest account is nearly seventeen
millions ot' dollars less than on the
first of March, 1800. It was,highly
desirable tli.it the rapid diminution
should take place, both to strengthen
the credit of the country and to
convince its citizens of their entire
ability to meet every dollar of lia
bilities without bankrupting them.
DIMINUTION THE BURDENS OF
TAXATION.
a
a
But in view of the accomplish
ment, of these desirable ends, of
the rapid development of the re
sources of the country, its increas
ing ability to meet large demands
and the amount already paid, it is
not desirable that the present, re
sources of the country should con
tinue this rapid payment, i recom
mend that all taxes from internal
sourccsbe abolished, except those
collected from spiritous, vinous and
malt liquors, tobacco in its various
forms, and for stamps. There are
many articles not produced at home
but which enter largely into general
consumption,through articles which
arc manufactured at home, such as
medicines, compounded, &c, from
which very little revenue is derived,
but which enter into general use,
All such articles I recommend to
be placed on the free list. I have
not entered into figures, because to
do so would be to repeat what will
be laid before you in the report of
the becretary ol the Treasury.
SALARIES COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS.
The present laws for collecting
the revenues pay collectors of cus
toms small salaries, but provide for
moieties or shares in all seizures,
which, at the principal, ports of en
try particularly, raise the compensa
tion of these officers to a large sum
It holds out an inducement to dis
honest men, should such get posses
sion of these offices, to be lax in
their scrutiny of goods entered, to
enable them finally to make large
seizures. Your attention is respect-
luiiy invited to this subject.
ARMY.
For the operations of the armv in
the past year, the expense of main
taining it, the estimates for the on-
suing year, and for continuing sea
coast and other improvements con
ducted under the supervision of the
War Department, I refer you to the
accompanying report of the becre
taryofWar. I recommend that the
officers in each grade in the staff
corps be fixed, and that whenever
the number in any one grado falls
below the number so fixed, that the
vacancy may be filled by promotion
from the grade below. I also recom
mend that when the office of chief
of a corps becomes vacant, the place
may be filled by a selection from
the corps in which the vacancy exists.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the
Navy shows an improvement in the
number and efficiency of the naval
force, without material increase m
the expense of supporting it. This
is due to the policy which has been
adopted, and is being extended as
fast as material will admit, of using
smaller vessels as cruisers on the
several stations. By this means wo
have been enabled to occupy at onco
a larger extent of cruising grounds,
to visit more frequently the posts
where the presence of our flag is de
sirable, and generally to discharge
more eificiently'thc appropriate du"
ties of the navy in time ot peace,
without exceeding the numbers of
men or theexpenditurcsauthorized
by law. During the past year the
navy has, in addition to its regular
service, supplied the men and officers
for the coast; survey, and has com
pleted the surveys authorized by
Congress of the Isthmus of Daricn
and Tehuantepec, and Under like
authority has sent out an expedi
tion completely furnished and
equipped, to explore the unknown
ocean of the North. The .sugges
tions of the report as to the neces
sity for increasing .and improving
the material of the navy, and the
plan recommended for reducing the
the pereonal of the service to a peace
standard by the gradual abolition of
certain grades of officers, the reduc
tion of others, and the employment
of some in the service of the com
mercial marine, are well considered,
and deserve the thoughtful atten
tion of Congress. I also recom
mend that all promotions in the
navy above the rank of Captain be
by selection instead of by seniority.
This course will secure in the higher
grades greater efficiency, and hold
out an incentive to-young officers to
improve themselves in the knowl
edge of their profession.- -The pres
ent cost of maintaining the navy, its
cost compared with that of the pre
ceding year, and the estimates for
the ensuing year are contained in
accompanying report of the Secre
tary of the Navy.
THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT.
The enlarged receipts of the Post-
office Department, as shown by the
accompanying report of the Post
master General, exhibits a gratify
ing increase in that branch of the
public service. It is the index of
the growth of education and of the
prosperity of the people, two ele
ments highly conductive to the vig
or and stability of republics. With
a vast territory like-'ours, much of
lb Bpuisui pupuiauiu, uuu.au requir
ing the services of the mail, it is not
at present to be expected that this
Department can be made self-sus
taining; but a gradual approach to
this; end from year to year is con
fidently- relied on, and the day is not
far distant when the Postofflce De
partment of the Government will
prove a much greater blessing to
the whole people than it is now.
The suggestions of the .Postmaster
General for. improvements in the
Department presided over by him
are earnestly recommended to your'
special attention. Especially do I
recommend the favorable considera
tion of the plan for uniting, the tel
egraphic system of the. United
States with the postal system. It is
believed that by such a course the
cost of telegraphing could be much
reduced, and the service as well if
not better rendered. It would se
cure the further advantage of ex
tending the telegraph through por
tions of the country where private
enterprise will not construct it.
Commerce, trade, and, above all,
the effojts to bring a people widely
separated into a community of in
to a community of interests, are al
ways benefitted by a rapid inter
communication; education, the
grand work of republican institu
tions, encouraged, by increasing the
facilities to get the news speedily
from all parts, of the country. The
desire to reap the benefits of such
improvements will stimulate educa
tion. I refer you to the report of
Postmaster tieneral for full details
of the operations of last year, and
lor comparative statements of re
sults with former years.
THE KU-KLUX LAW—ITS ENFORCEMENT.
There has been imposed upon the
Executive branch of the Govern
ment the execution of the act' of
Congress: approved April 20, 1870,
and commonly known as the Ku-
Klux law, in a portion of the State
of South Carolina. The necessity
of the course pursued will be dem:
onstrated by the report of the com
mittee to investigate Southern out
rages. Under the provisions of the
above act, I issued a proclamation,
calling the attention of " the people
of the United States to the same,
and declaring my reluctance to ex
ercise any of the extraordinary
powers thereby conferred upon me,
except in case ot imperative neces
sity, but making known my purpose
to' exercise such powers,'whcnever it
should become necessary, to do so,
for the purpose of securing to all
citizens of the United States the
peaceful enjoyment of the rights
guaranteed to them by the constitu
tion and the laws. After the pas
sage of this law information was re
ceived from time to time that com
binations of the character referred
to in this law existed and were pow
erful in many parts" of the Southern
States, particularly in certain coun
ties in the btate ot bouth Carolina.
Careful investigation was made, and
it was ascertained that in counties
of that State such combinations
were active and powerful, embrac
ing a sufficient portion of the citi
zens to control the local authorities,
and having among other things the
object of depriving the emanci
pated class of the substantial bene
fits of freedom and of preventing
the free political actions of those
citizens who did not
with their own views. Thousands
of inoffensive and well-disposed cit
izens were the sufferers by this law
less violence. Thereupon, on the
12th of Oct, '71, a proclamation
was issued, in the terms of the law
calling upon the members of these
combinations to disperse within 5
days, and to deliver to the Marshal
or military officers of the U. S. all
arms, ammunition, uniforms, dis
guises, &c, tc. This warning not
having been heeded, on the 17th of
Oct. another proclamation was is
sued, suspending the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus in "J coun
ties in that btate.

MORMON QUESTION.
In Utah there still remains a rem
nant of barbarism, repugnant to
civilization, to decency, and to the
laws of the United States. Terri
torial officers, however, have been
found who are willing to perform
their duty in a spirit of equality
and with, a due sense of sustaining
the majesty of the law.
It is not with the religion of
the self-styled Saints, that wo are
now dealing, but with their practic
es. It may bo ad visablo for Congress
to consider what, in the execution
of the laws against polygamy, is to
be the status of tho plurality wives
and their offspring. The propriety
of Congress passing an enabling act
authorizing tho territorial legisla
ture of Utah to legitimatize all chil
dren born prior to a time fixed in
tho act, might be justified by its hu
manity to tho innocent children.
INDIAN POLICY.
The policy pursued towards tho
Indians has resulted, favorably, as
can be judged from the limited time
during which it has been in opera
tion. They arc being cared for in
such a way, it is hoped, as to induce
those.still pursuing their old habits
of life to embrace the only opportu
nity which is left them to avoid ex
termination. I recommend liberal
appropriations to carry out the In
dian peace policy,not only because
it is humane, Christian-like,econom-ical,
but because it is right. I rec
ommend to your favorable consider
ation, also, the policy of granting n
territorial government to the Indi
ans, in Indian lerritory west of
Arkansas and south of Kansas.
The Secretary of the interior has
treated upon this subject at length,
and I recommend to you this sugges
tion.
BUREAU REPORTS.
The report of the Secretary of the
Interior, submitted with this, will
give you all the information collect
ed and prepared for publication in
regard to the census taken during
1870, the operations of the Bureau
of Education for the year, the Pat
ent Office and the Indian Bureau.
AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Commissioner
of Agriculture gives the operations
of his department for the year. It
is in the hands of an able head,with
able assistants, all zealously devot
ed to introducing into the agricultu
ral productions of the nation all
such products adapted to any of the
various climates and .soils of our
vast territory.
THE QUESTION OF AMNESTY.
More than six years bavin? claused
since the last hostile gun wal fired be
tween the armies then arrayed ajrainst
each other one for the perpetuation,
the other for the destruction of the
Union it may well be considered wheth
er it' is hot time" that the disabilities im
posed by the Fourteenth Amendment
should be removed. That amendment
does not exclude the ballot, but only im
poses the disability to hold offices upon
certain classes. When the purity of the
Daiiot is secure: majorities are sure to
elect officers reflecting the views of the
majority, i uo not see tne advantage or
propriety of excluding men lrom office,
merely because they were, before the re
bellion, of standing and character suf
ficient to be electee! to positions'requlr-
ing them to take oaths to support the
Constitution; zna admitting to eligibil
ity of those entertaining precisely the
same views, but of less standing in their,
communities, it may be said that the
lormer violated in oaths while tne latter
did 'not have it in their power to.do so
If thev had taken this oath, it cannot
be doubted they woald- have broken it,
as urn the lormer class, ll there are any
great criminals distinguished above all
others for the part they" took in opposi
tion to tne government, they mignt, in
thejudgment of Congress, bo excluded
from such in amnesty. This subject is
submitted for your careful considera
tion. The condition of the Southern
States is unhappily not such as all true
patriotic citizens would like to see. Us
tracism'for opinion's sake", threats of
personal violence toward persons enter
taining political views opposed to those
entertained by the majority of the old
citizens, prevents immigration and the
flow of much needed capital into the
States lately in rebellion. It will be a
happy condition of the country when
the old citizens of these States will take
an interest in public affairs, promulgate.
ideas honestly entertained, vote for men
representing their views, and tolerate
ihe same freedom of expression and
Ballot in those, 'entertaining different
political convictions.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions ot the act of
Congress, approved February 21, 1871, a
territorial government was organized in
the District of Columbia. Its results
have thus far fully realized the expec
tations of its advocates. Under the di
rection of the territorial officers, a sys
tem oi improvements nas Deen made in
augurated, by means of which Wash
ington is rapidly becoming a city worthy
of the nation's capital. The citizens of
the District having voluntarily taxed
themselves to a large amount for the
liurpusu ui communing to me arrange
ment of the seat of government, I rec
ommend several appropriations on the
part of Congress, in order that the Gov
ernment may bear its just share of the
expense ot carrying out a judicious sys
tem ot improvement. ,
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN CHICAGO.
By the great fire in Chicago the most
important of the government buildings
of that city were consumed. Those
burned had already become inadequate
to the wants' of the government in that
growing city, and, looking to the near
future, were totally inadequate. I rec
ommend, therefore, that an appropria
tion be.made immediately to purchase
tne remainder ot the square on which
the burned buildings stood, provided i:
can be purchased at a fair valuation, or
provided mat tne .Legislature ol Illinois
will pass a law authorizing its "ondem
nation for government purposes; and
alsc an appropriation, of as much money
as can properly be expended toward the
erection of new buildings during this
fiscal year.
PROTECTION OF IMMIGRANTS.
The number of immigrants ignorant
of our laws, habits, &c, coming into
our country annually lias become so
great, and the impositions practised up
on them so numerous and flagrant, that
I suggest Congressional action for their
protection. It seems to me a fair sub
ject of legislation by Congress. I can
not now state as fully as I desire the na
ture of the complaints made by immi
grants of the treatment thev receive,
but will endeavor to do so during the
session of Congress, particularly if the
suDject snouiu receive your attention
HONESTY AND EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC OFFICES.
FICES.
It has been the aim of the adminis
tration to enforce honesty and efficiency
in ail puoiic ouices. Jivery puDiic ser
vant who has violated tho trust placed
in mm nas Dcen proceeded against with
all the vigor of the law. If bad men
have secured places, it has been the fault
of the system established by law, the
custom lor making appointments, or the
lault ot tnose who recommend lor gov-
cmuieiib iJuaiLiuiis jjciauiia iiui suiuuiujiL-
ly well known to them personally, or
who cive letters lnuorsinsr the charac-
ol. oliice-seekers without a proper
sense oi tne grave responsibility which
such a course devolves upon them. A
civil service reform, which can correct
this abuse, is much desired. In mercan
tile pursuits, the business man who
gives a letter of recommendation to a
mend to enable him to obtain credit
from a stranger, is regarded as morally
responsible for theintegrity of his friend
and his ability to meet his obligations.
A reformatory law, which would en
force tins privilege against all endors
era of persons for public place, would
insure great caution in making recom
mendations. A salutary lesson has been
taught the careless and the dishonest
public servant in the great number of
prosecutions and convictions of He last
two years. It Is gratifying to notice the
favorable change which is taking place
throughout the country in bringing to
punishment those who nave proven rec
rcant to the trust confided to them, and
in elevating to public office none but
those who possess tho commence or tho
ways be found to comprise the majori
ty oi tno community in wnicu tney
live.
THE CIVIL SERVICE BOARD.
In my message to Congress one year
ago 1 urgently recommended a reform
in the civil service of the country. Jn
conformity with that recommendation
congress, in the ninth section or an act
making appropriations for sundry civil
expenses or the uovcrnmcnt and lor
other purposes, approved March 3rd,
1S71, gave the necessary authority to
tno .Executive to inaugurate a civil ser
vice reform, and placed upon him the
responsibilities of doing so. Under the
authority ot said act I convened aboard
of gentlemen eminently qualified for
tho work to devise rules anil regulations
to ellect tho needed reform. Their la
bors arc not yet completed, but it is be
lieved that they will succeed In devising
a plan which can lw adopted to the great
relief of tho Executive, tho heads of de
partments and members of Congress.
and which will redound to tho true in
terest of tho public service. At all
events the experiment shall have a fair
trial.
I have thus hastily summed up the
operations of the Government dt1 ring the
last year, and made such suggestions as
occur to me to be proper for your con
sideration. I submit them with a con
fidence that your combined action will
be wise, statesmanlike, and in the best
interests of the whole country.
