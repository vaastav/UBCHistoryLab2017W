THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE '
THE address of President Wilson, delivered today before a
joint session of eongress, is remarkable for what it doesn't say.
It is devoid of the brilliant rhetoric usually put forth in the
preparation of documents of state intended to impress the listener,
but the brevity of the communication deserves the applause of
every busy newspaper reader. Three-fourths of the message is
devoted to consideration of labor questions, including the Adamson
bill, with suggestions for congress to complete the unfinished task
of the 6ession that sat within a few days of the opening of the
campaign. From appearances there is nothing special to commend
the document, but it is obvious that in dealing with the transporta
tion during the campaign the president failed to touch upon some
of the more drastic features which he touches upon today. For
instance, he boldly urged the enactment of laws for the seizure and
operation of railroads as "a military necessity," which is a mere
euphemism for the president to operate these roads with military in
the event of industrial disturbances. After overriding the sugges
tion of the railroads that the differences between the operating
forces and the management should be submitted to arbitration, Mr.
"Wilson now comes to the front as sponsor for a law that will make
arbitration compulsory. "There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in
it unless it be arbitrarily or unjustly done. It should be .done with
a full- and scrupulous regard for the interests and liberties of all
concerned, as well as for the permanent interests or society itself,"
is the way in which he dismisses the issue of compulsory arbitration
without wrenching the consrienee that not long ago promised the
railroad brotherhoods that there would be nothing akin to the
Canadian law 61 compulsory arbitration and governmental adjudica
tion of wage questions.
The president purposely avoids or evades responsibility for the
recommendations of department heads, which, for the first time, do
not attain the dignity of comment from the chief executive of the
country. The reports of the cabinet officers will go directly to
congress without having passed the censorship of the president and
without the president assuming any responsibility for what they
contain. This is a cheap method of escaping a lot of responsibility
and its effect on congress remains to be seen. Altogether, the
message may be regarded as an experiment which has to be
subjected to the test of criticism.
At the opening of the succeeding congress, with a Republican
majority in the lower house, the president may find a powerful
argument to indulge in a more comprehensive message, that the
citizens of the United States be given to understand exactly what
his policies stand for.
TIRED OF INVESTIGATIONS
CONGRESSMAN FITZGERALD of New York hit the nail on the
head when he introduced several bills looking to the regulation
of food traffic with the remark, that the people are weary of
investigations that don't investigate and serve no useful purpose;
what the public wants is something that will spell relief in the
only pracrtical way of cutting down the expense account of the
small family. Until that is done there is not much use discussing
where the fault lies or on whose shoulders should be placed the
onus for an artificial condition that permits dealers to charge more
for commodities raised in his country than what is exacted across
the water, where war's grisly head obtrudes its ghastly shadow on
every side. Notwithstanding the abundance of everything pertain
ing to living, the cost has advanced out of all proportion to the
shortage reported by government agents. A cursory inquiry
discloses the sad truth that in many ases it is customary for the
middlemen to destroy produce that they may be enabled to demand
more from their putrons or to maintain the high rates of existing
contracts based on false representations of conditions. A recent
report from the Canadian bureau having charge of the cost of
living states that thfe advance during the past three years has been
only about ten per cent, while just over the line, in the most fertile
sections of the United States, cost increases are shown ranging all
the wav from 2Q to 100 per cent. In Canada there is the foundation
for an excuse owing to the removal of so many of the young men
from agricultural pursuits in response to the demands of their
country, which carried with it a diminished production of the
leading commodities of the farm. Congress has essayed to regulate
commerce and there is nothing to daunt this body from enacting
laws that will give the consumer a square deal.
THIRD TERM TALK
A LTIIOUGII President Wilson has not begun his second term
l vpt thfl talk of a third term for him has betrun. Some of his
ardent admirers think he will initiate the example of Disraeli, who
hfeized the essential features of his opponent's program, crammed
them down the throats of hi own party and thus cemented himself
into power as prime minister of England. These Wilsonian admirers
intimate that the president will make use or the situation created
by the close of the European war if that event comes within the
next four years to turn to a protective tariff ax the proper
economic policy for this country and thus draw to himself the
nnnnrf nf a. Inn? bodv of voters who now; affiliate with the
t-jrw. . o ----
Republican party on that policy. . t
The idea is far fetched, but the talk of a third term for Wilson
is by no means the idle vaporing of political theorists. It is being
seriously talked of by men who have close personal association with
the president and who are in a position to know what is passing
through his mind as well as any one can in the case of so
8elf-eontained and uncommunicative a person as Mr. Wilson.
It is unethical for doctors to advertise, but the New York health
department is willing to ask the newspaper for free boosting in
suggesting the adoption of a "Doctor's Day" by every community
on which everybody will visit a physician to be "looked over."
This system will not appeal to the man wrestling with the high
cost of living.
i Rumor has it that District Attorney J. A. Sanders met his
Waterloo before the Nye county grand jury the present grand
jury) the other day, when he was compelled to pull in his horns
and become a quiet little lamb. This is one grand jury that cannot
be browbeaten by the men of officialdom, and the people will be
the gainers.
Russia begins to show the cloven hoof or the steel claw of the
bear that wants to find an outlet for the products of the far north
through the Dardanelles. The fact that Russia has spoken may be
taken as a quiet but firm intimation to England not to be too rash
in dictating policies of the war.
"Only a few Chinese killed," Is the way the Mexican government
reports results of tthe Chihuahua attack. It may be recalled that the
same government not long ago paid $3,000,000 for "only a few
Chinese" massacred at Torreon. Nothing was paid for Americans.
THE STROLLER,
BY L. B. (LETSON BALLIET)
THE BUSINESS MAN AND H. C. L.
Now that the election la over, it is
idle to enter into any post-mortem
examinations or how it happened,
suffice it is that it did happen, and
all we can do is to make the best ot
it, and continue the fight against
H. C. L. (which stands for High Cost
ot Living).
The paper that this newspaper is
printed on has advanced in price
over fifty per cent, the ink, the type
and the typemetal used in the lino
type work has all advanced from
fifty to one hundred per cent, and
yet the publisher can charge no more
for his paper than before. .
Business men finding the cost of
doing business has Increased are
struggling to increase their efficien
cies, for the purpose of reducing
their expenses. But the greatest mis
take that can be made is to curtail
their advertising. Advertising is the
vanguard ot business. The tighter
hiiMiness crows the stronger must
grow the vanguard.
For a business house to assume
that it is well established and too
well known to need advertising is
the first step in business decay,
which allows others who are not so
well established to gather the busi
ness from the public through pub
licity. The readers of this paper are
struggling with the high cost of
living, and the merchant who is most
efficient, and advertises the fact by
calling attention to his prices, gets
the most business and makes the
most profit.
The advertisement of "Jones &
Jones, dealers In general merchan
dise, established In 1901," Is not
effective. No one cares when they
were established, with the H. C. L.
conditions confronting them. What
they want to know is where they can
buy to the best advantage.
If the "Johnnie Come Lately store"
can sell cheaper than the "Moss Back
store," Johnnie Come Lately will sell
the more goods. Many people think
that the public doesn't read the ad
vertisements. Of course they don't.
when tliey are the unattractive an
noiincement cards, identically alike
day after day.
Perhaps you didn't read the politi
cal circulars with which you were
flooded during the last election cam
paign, and perhaps you didn't read
the announcement cards of the vari
ous candidates, every day, which re
mained unchanged during the entire
campulgn. But during the campaign
I advertised in this paper and labeled
it paid advertising, and nearly every
one read my advertising. In fact, on
several different occasions the entire
Issue of the paper was sold out, and
on one or two occasions the pub
lisher had to put the forms back on
the press and print a second edition
of several hundred copies to supply
the demand for papers. This is a
thing almost unheard of In advertis
ing, that a second edition be required
to supply people with - papers on
account of paid advertising It con
tains. No one can tell me that the
readers of this paper don't read the
advertising If It is written so that
it will Interest them.
If the people don't read your ad
vertising matter It Is your own fault,
not the fault of the people nor the
publisher.
I'll lay a wager with the publisher
of this paper, or any advertiser, that
I can write on any business In Tono
pah, three months of paid advertis
ing, double the business and Increase
the circulation and street sales of
the paper.
Advertising Is jus: u interesting to
the reader who is struggling with the
H. C. L. as the war In Europe, if it
is well written so as to hold the
interest and so It will TELL SOME
THING that the readers want to
know or should know.
I am no more interested In this
paper than yofa are, but I am inter
ested in Tonopah and Nye county,
and I don't want to see long faces
on Tonopah merchants because mail
order houses get the cash business
and local merchants get the credit
business. I don't want to see Tono
pah merchants close their doors, and
I'm sure that the publisher of this
paper doesn't want to see It any
more than I do. I believe in patron
izing home business, when it can be
had. If the home merchants had and
could hold all the business that is
here they could sell just as cheaply
as any mail order house can deliver
the goods here.
For that reason I want to tell the
merchants something:
Advertising to be effective must:
First, attract attention to the article
or business advertised. Second, to
give information about subject ad
vertised In fact, ; to educate the
readers in its benefits and costs,
Third, to assure the public of its
reliability.
An advertisement falling in any
one of these three essentials is lost,
The catalogues of mail order
houses attract attention, describe the
articles and state the costs, and
guarantee reliability. Their guaran
tee of reliability is established by the
amount of money spent in preparing
the catalogue, and the fact that they
continue business year after year.
even though the goods cannot be
examined before purchase. The mail
order houses' catalogue and office ex
penses can be eliminated by a local
merchant, and reliability assured by
opportunity to personally inspect the
goods.
Now, Mr. Merchant, Iook at your
ajvertlsement. DOES IT ATTRACT
ATTENTION? DOES IT TELL ANY
THING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE
FOR SALE AND GIVE PRICES? If
it fails in either of those two essen
tials, your established reliability
counts for little.
