While attending her husband's
husband's funeral at New Virginia,
Mrs. Margaret Hossack was arrested
by Sheriff Lewis Hodson of Warren
county, charged with the murder of
her husband, John Hossack, who
was killed in cold blood'recently at
the Hossack iiome near Medora. The
atendance at the funeral was un
usually large, farmers coming for
miles around to attedH. When the
sheriff stepped up to Mrs. Hossack,
shortly after the last chunk of dirt
had been thrown upon the newly
made grave, and she was on her way
to town with her children by her
side, the arrest caused a tremendous
sensation. Mrs. Hossack took the
arrest calmly, evidntly having an
ticipated the event. She expressed
a desire to go first to her home to
get a few things, and within an hour
the sheriff and the accused were on
their way to the county jail at In
dianola. More than twenty wit
nesses were examined by the coron
er and his jury before the evidence
was closed. Almost the last witness,
and by far the most important one
examined, was Mrs. Hossack herself.
She reiterated her former statements
of the crime, and although she was
under examination for nearly three
hours nothing in the way of causing
her to break down or to cross her
self In her evidence resulted. The
evidence upon which Mrs. Hossack
was arrested is purely circumstan
tial, the only testimony being to the
effect that Hossack and his wife had
frequent quarrels, and the improb
ability of the woman's story that
she slept peacefully by the side of
the murdered man and heard no
sounds until it was all over and the
murderer had escaped through the
front door.

BAD FIRE AT AWES. 3
Main Building of Agricultural Col
lege Nearly Destroyed.
Ames, Dec. 9.—The main building
at the State Agricultural college was
almost completely destroyed by fire
yesterday morning. The north wing I
and m'ost of the center of the build
ing are in ruins, and the botanical
collection, one of the most' valuable
in the country, suffered heavy loss.
The total loss is estimated at close to
$50,000.
Two hundred men students, occu
Pying the north wing of the building
as a dormitory, escaped with their
lives, fifty using the fire escape, but
were able to save but few of their
belongings. Practically nothing but
the south wing of the buildinc was
saved.
The fire originated in the boiler
room of the heating plant in the
basement of the north wing at 4
clock. It caught in a heap of shin
gles used as kindling. This was di
rectly under the conduits through
which the steam pipes lead to the up
per floors. This created a strong
draft and the fire was sucked up to
the top floor in an instant. A mo
ment later the entire top floor was in
flames. By the time the alarm could
be given the "top floor was a burning
furnace, and the fire was rapidly eat
ing its way downward.
Students were aroused from sound
slumber as if by magic and rushed
for the fire escapes half-clad. That
all of them escaped without one be
ing seriously injured in the panic is
almost miraculous.
Paul St. Clair, the fireman in
charge of the boiler room, gave the
alarm as soon as he discovered the
seriousness of the fire, but the fa
cilities of the college Are department
were utterly inadequate to the emer
gency.
The display of college spirit was
magnificent, and it was the perfect
discipline of the students which pre
vented more destructive spread of
ine flames.
Their efforts saved most of the
$10,000 botanical collection, which
was on tne first floor of the north
wing.
The' building which lias been de
stroyed was erected in 18G8 at a cost
of $200,000. Repairs were made on it
two years ago and it was in good con
dition. It was devoted to dormitory
purposes and recitation rooms.!
Kirby's cigar store at Boone was
broken into by burglars and eighty

The J. R. Smith & Son elevator at

origin of the fire is unknown, but it
is thought that it was started by
some means in the engine room. The
proprietors had just put in some new
machinery ana will feel the loss
keenly. There was $5,000 insurance
on the building and grain.

George Wicks, superintendent of
the Johnson county poor farm, is in
a precarious condition as the result
of being stabbed by "Blind" Kauff
man, one of the insane patients of
the county house. Superintendent'
Wicks was carrying supper to Kauff
man and had barely opened the door
to his cell when the madman leaped)
upon him and stabbed the superin
tendent eight or ten times with a
sharpened butcher knife. Kauffman
had been confined in a solitary cell
at the poor farm awaiting the action
of the authorities, who were expect
ed to commit him to the hospital at
Mt. Pleasant. The superintendent
grabbed the crazy man by the right
arm, but could not prevent the tor
rent of blows rained upon him. The
cries and scuttling brought assistance.
It is believed that only the greatest
skill will bring Kauffman's victim
through.
Two youths of Dubuque, whose

minutes after the youth who took
ine first draught had imbibed he
was unconscious and physicians
worked with him twelve hours be
fore they brought him to. His face
turned purple and his neck became
swollen and the veins distorted. The
doctors pronounced the case one of
asphyxiation from the gas which
naturally generates in a liquor bar
rel. The boy who drank first got the
most gas. One of the youths is 18
years of age and the other a little
younger. They had gone to the cel

MINISTERS ABANDON FUSTS
Dispute Between the Netherlands and

Lisbonj Dec. 8.—The minister of

is believed a difference has arisen
on the subject of the exequatur to
the Dutch' consul at Lorenzo Mar
quez, which the Portuguese govern
ment has withdrawn.
The tension between Portugal and
Holland appears to have been empha
sized, perhaps not altogether unin
tentionally, by the peculiar warmth
of King Charles' toast to Queen Vic
toria jat a banquet given yesterday
evening at the royal palace to Vice
Admiral Rawson and the officers of
the British fleet now in the river
Tagus, and by the telegram which
the lcing afterward dispatched to Vic

ing the fleet and for the friendship
thus demonstrated.
"I beg to record," telegraphed the
king, "my great satisfaction at the
frank and loyal alliance uniting Eng
land and Portugal." In the course of
his speech, the king said, among
other things: "England has often
shared the efforts and glories of Por
tugal. Our mutual friendship and
close alliance are strengthened by
history and bloodshed together in
causes which have always been just."
Admiral Rawson replied that the
works of the king harmonized with

holding of an interstate and West In
dian exposition in Charleston, S. O.,

was displaced by the ship subsidy bill
as unfinished business and Fryc ad
dressed the senate in favor of its pas
sage.

organization bill,' which went over
till tomorrow. Among bills pr.ssetl
was one to provide for the detail of

a system of military instruction.
Washington, Dee. 5.—Senate—Pet

mation on Cuban posta. frauds wa.'l
referred to the Committee on relrt'
tions with Cuba. Frye concluded his
address in favor of' the ship subsidy
bill.
House—The arm^ bill came up
under special order and eleven of
its twenty-six pages were disposed
of. The feature of the debate was
the speech of McCall, rep., of Mass
achusetts, who not only opposed the

pine policy of the administration,
Washington, Dec. ff.—Senate—The
senate spent almost the entire time
in executive session, the floor being
occupied by Morgan,who while declar
ing that the Hay-Pauneefote treaty

the Nicaragua canal, favored its rat
ification in deference to the wishes of
the secretary of state.
House—The house, at the end of a
long sitting, passed the army reor
ganization bill by a vote of 166 to
133. Three democrats, Messrs. Hall of
Pennsylvania "and Underhill and Clay
ton of New York voted with the re
publicans for the bill, and Mr. McCall,
republican, of Massachusetts, with
the democrats against it. Otherwise
it was a strict party vote. An anti
canteen amendment by Littlefield
was_ adopted. ±he democrat.e prop
osition, an extension of the tempo
rary army until July 1, 1903, wliiili
was voted upon indirecuy on a mo
tion to recommit, commanded the
votes of only about half the opposi
tion and of two republicans, Mr. Mc
Call and Mr. Mann of Illinois.

.executive session the senate agreed
to vote on the amendment offered
by the committee on foreign rela
tions providing for the policing of

constructed. Senator Morgan con
cluded his speech and Teiler spoke
for two hours in opposition to the
treaty.
House.—The house passed the
Grout oleomargarine bill by a vote of
196 to 92. The substitute offered by
tlm minority of the committee on
agriculture which imposed additonal
restrictions on the saie of oleomar
garine to prevent its fraudulent sale
as butter and increased the penalties
for violations, was defeated by a vote
of 113 to 178. The bill as passed
makes all articles known as oleo
margarine, butterine, imitated butter
or imitated cneese transported into
any state or territory for consump
tion or sale subject to the pouca
power of such state or territory,
but prevents any state or territory
from prohibiting the transportation
or sale of such product when pro
duced and sold free from coloration
in imitation of butter. The bill in
creases the tax on oleomargarine
colored in imitation of butter from
2 to 10 cents per pound and decreas
es the tax on oleomargarine uncol
ored from 2 cents to .cent per
pound.
Washington, Dec. 10.—Senate—The
senate spent almost five hours in ex
ecutive session considering the Ilay
Pauncefote treaty. Morgan took is
sue with Teller as to the purport of
the first clause of the Clayton-Bnlwer
treaty, claiming it applied only to
Great Britain's right to fortify the
Nicaragua canal itself. Teller re
plied at some length, asserting
that the provision was of more gen-,
eral import as, he said, any one could
ascertain for himself by reading
President Buchanan's views upon the'
subject when he was minister to Eng
land. The declaration then made
showed plainly, he said, that Eng
land had attempted to extend her
rights beyond the immediate vicinity
of the canal. Teller repeated his dec
laration that the United States
should construct the .canal, if at all,
regardless of the English position
and without going through the for
mality of ratifying the pending
treaty.

ply bills, the legislative, executive

Messrs. Jones and May of CIs
land, the engineer and business ag
of the Cleveland Interurban ElectrW
Railway company, who were in Dei
Moines last July to look over the^
route of the proposed electric line be
tween Des Moines and Newton, hqve
been in Des Moines again within the
last two weeks. They were accom
panied by other representatives of J.
B. Hanna and the Cleveland capital
ists who propose to build the road,
and made another inspection of the
proposed road. They came unherald-.
ed, either did not register or regis
tered under assumed names,- and
were in Des Moines and vicinity for'/
threfe days at least. The fact thp.tf
they were here leaked out through
men who have been consulted by
them relative to the project From
them it was learned that the gentle
men say there is no question but the
road will be built if the necessary
concessions in the way of franchises
can be obtained. In Des Moines a
franchise will be asked for one line
from the east-city limits to the busi
ness center over some street to be
nhmed, and the towns of Altoona,
Mitchellville, Colfax and Newton wil^
be asked to grant franchises for tha
operation of the road through those
towns, and over certain streets. It
was claimed that the franchise ques
tion will be taken up with the city
council in Des Moines during the
winter^ months, and that building
operations will be commenced as
soon as spring opens up if the proper
arrangements can be made.
Immediately after the Easter holi
days Des Moines will become a see
city. Dr. McGorrislc, one of the dele
gates to the meeting.of. the suffragan
bishops at Dubuque, stated yester
day that he had taken a canvass of
the bishops in attendance and found
not a dissenting vote on the ques
tion, even the Davenport bishop nol
objecting.

John R. Sage, director of the Iowa
weather and crop service, has issued ij
his annual crop report, showing th'e
average yield per acre, total product
and average prices of staple farify
products in Iowa December 1, 1890.
The yield of winter wheat on a re
duced acreage as compared witly'
former years appears to be 1,018,070
bushels—an average of 14.3 b.ushel^
per acre. The total yield of spring
wheat is 20,280,280 bushels—an aver
age of 14.3 bushels per acre. The
average home value of spring wheat
is 60 cents and winter wheat 62 cents
per bushel, making the total of the
wheat crop $12,799,371. The care
fully revised figures made last June
showed the area of corn planted this
year to be 8,618,660 acres. The re
turns of the harvest show remarka
ble uniformity in the output of the
crop in the different sections of the
state, the'average per acre for the
several counties ranging from thir
ty-five to forty-three bushels. There
are sixty-three counties credited
with an average yield of forty-three
bushels per acre. The total product
of the state is 345,055,040 bushels,
The average yield per acre is 40J
bushels for the state average price,
87 cents, and the value of the crop
at that figure is $93,104,860. Fully
three-fourths of the crop will bo
consumed within the state.
Dr. R. E. Conniff of^the state board
of medical examiners admitted in an ",
interview that the board would use
every means to keep from issuing
certificates to graduates of the Still
College of Osteopathy. At its last
meeting the board postponed- action,
giving for its reason that there was
too yiuch other business on hand to
consider the osteopaths, but Dr.
Conniff said: "The board members
propose to stand by their guns and
protect the public health of this
state just as long as they possibly
can. It is true there is a law under
which the board is required to issue
certificates' to osteopaths, but -there
are also provisions which allow the
board to provide qualifications that
must be met before persons can be
admitted to the practice of osteop
athy. I am convinced we should
make every effort to keep them from
practicing. They have begun man
damus proceedings against us in Polk
county and threaten us with jail for
contempt of court, but we are will
ing to let that come if necessary."
