Washington, Dec. 10. —The senate to
day broke the record in the way of
measures introduced in a single day,
there being 012 bills and eight joint
resolutions presented.
Senator Paddock of Nebraska has the
distinction of having introduced the
iirat bill in this congress. It provides
for the organization uf a section in the
department of agriculture, to be known
as the food section of the chemical divi
sion, whose duty it shall be to prevent
the adulteration and misbranding of
food, drugs, etc. This proposition failed
of adoption at the last session, as an
amendment to the agricultural appro
priation bill. ,
Among the documents laid before the
senate and referred, were the annual re
port of the secretary of the treasury,
and many memorials asking legislation
for the closing of the world's fair on
Bundays.
PKEE COINAGE BILLS.
Senator Stewart introduced a bill pro
viding for the free coinage of gold and
silver bullion. It is a copy of the bill
introduced by Plumb at the last con
gress, on the same subject, with certain
amendments. One of these is that bul-
lion deposited in the mints shall be
coined into standard dollars only, and
not in part mado into bars. Another
amendment provides that the certifi
cates issued shall be of denominations
of not less than one nor more than ten
thousand dollars. This bill was laid on
the table, so at any time Stewart may
call it up.
Plumb introduced a bill to provide
for the retirement of national bank
notes and the free coinage of silver, the
same as the bill introdced by him at
the last session, with a few amend-
CHINESE EXCLUSION BILLS.
Senator Stewart introduced a bill sup
plemental to the Chinese exclusion act.
It makes it unlawful, after the passage
of the act, for a Chinese laborer to enter
or remain in the United States for any
purpose whatever. The act, it is pro
, vided, shall preclude the entry into the
United States, not only of Chinese labor
ers who have never been here, but all
who have been here and departed;
also all Chinese persons who may
desire to pass through or over the
United States lor any purpose what-
ever.
Senator Cullom also introduced a bill
on the same subject. It provides that
for ten after the passage of the act, the
coming of Chinese laborers to the
United States be suspended. During
bucli time it shall be unlawful for any
Chinese laborer to come, or having so
come, to remain within the
United States. Every Chinese per
son, other than a laborer, who may
be entitled by the treaty of ISBO or this
act to come within the United States,
shall obtain permission of and be identi
fied as so entitled by the Chinese gov
ernment or other foreign government of
which at tho time such Chinese shall be
a subject. This certificate shall be vised
by a United States diplomatic or con
sular representative. The provisions of
the act apply to all Chinese except diplo
matic or consular officers and their at
tendants. Chinese found unlawfully
within the jurisdiction of the United
States shall be removed to China. Chi
nese now in this country must obtain a
certificate within ninety days.
INTRNATIONit ARBITRATION.
Mitchell presented a petition oi a
large number of citizens of Oregon, pray
ing that congress take whatever action
may be necessary to invite a conference
of the governments of the world during
the world's Columbian exposition, for
the purpose of devising measures by
which the principles of arbitration may
be incorporated in treaties, conflicting
international laws harmonized, and an
international court established having
jurisdiction in cases which disagreeing
governments shall fail to settle by nego
tiations.
Dolph introduced a bill appropriating
$1,000,000 to establish a gun factory on
the Pacific coast; also one to continue
in force the Chinese exclusion act of Oc
tober, 1888, with an amendment requir
ing that Chinese in the United States be
removed to China; also one appropriat
ing 1(525,000 for the improvement of the
Lower Columbia river.

Wells-Fargo Olftoe Robbed.
Sacramknto, Dec. 10.—A special from
Shingle Springs, California, says the
office of Wells, Fargo &Co. at that place
was robbed last night by two masked
men, who covered the agent, F. C. More
beck, with pistols and compelled him to
surrender the keys to the safe. The
robbers secured only a watch and $90 in
cash. The sheriff and a possee are in
pursuit, but there is little hope of cap
turing the men.
MR. SPRINGER'S POLICY.
THE ILLINOIS MAN OUTLINES HIS
TARIFF PLAN.
He Will Not Attempt a General Revision,
of the Tariff at This Time, if He
(Jots the Ways and Means Chair
manship.
■Washington, Dec. 10. —Springer, who
is likely to be chairman of the ways and
means committee, if Mills is offered and
declines the honor, said today his policy
with reference to the tariff was to pro
vide for free wool, free salt, free lumber,
free cotton ties, free coal and free bind
ing twine. He said: "I do not think
we should attempt a general revision of
the tariff at this time. We should offer
the country relief by passing bills for
putting the articles named on the free
list, and sending them to the senate. A
general tariff bill cannot be enacted into
a law, and would keep congress here
until October. I think there should be
appointed a special committee on manu
factures, with able investigators on it.
It should consist of fifteen members, ten
Democrats and five Republicans. This
would make five sub-committees of three
each. They should divide the work,
one investigating the textile industries,
another iron production, another glass
ware aud pottery, and so on. This
committee would besortof an adjunct to
the ways and means committee, which
could go on with its work, and then
subsequently get all the testimony with
out a long list of bearings. These sub
committees could go on during the
bession and also during recess. Their
inquiries should not be conducted with
a spirit of hostility toward tho manufac
turers, but with a view to apcertain the
bottom facts, aud liud out in each case
what, it any, degree of protection is
needed, us I have a euspieion that fre
quently it is represented that they need
a great deal more protection than is
really the case. It should be as
certained what the labor costs
on things .produced; tho wages
paid, whether work be steady or not;
profits on actual capital, and not on
•watered' stock; relative cost of pro
duction here and abroad; whether there
are tacit or direct agreements to limit
production, and much more information
of a practical character. This informa
tion is not now to be had. The party
could then fight the McKinley bill, and
if we'win in the elections, this informa
tion would enable us to form a tariff
bill adapted to the country, and one
that could become a law, and we will
pass it in the fifty-third congress. If
we fail in the elections, then the, infor
mation has been obtained, and we can
keep on till the country is educated
against the McKinley bill."
APPROPRIATIONS WANTED.
Estimate* For the Fiscal Tear 1803
Sent to the House.
Washington, Dec. 10.—Secretary Fos
ter today transmitted to the speaker of
the house for the information of con
gress, estimates of tho appropriations
required for the fiscal year 1893, as fur
nished by the heads of the several exec
utive departments. Some of the de
tails are of interest. The estimate for
the army and navy is $147,064,650,
which is a decrease of $3,748,583 from
the amount appropriated, on account of
pensions, for the fiscal year ending June'
30, 1892, and which includes a deficiency
appropriation of $29,350,598. The
amount of the estimates under the gen
eral head of naval establishment is
$26,865,054, which is something over
$5,000,000 less than the present appro
priation. Nearly all this reduction is
made in the estimate for increase of the
navy, the estimate for this item being
$12,280,855. For a building for the
library of congress, $1,035,000 is asked.
A Quadruple Tragedy.
Buda-Pkstu, Dec. 10.—A quadruple
tragedy ia reported from the village of
Alth-Kanitza. A blacksmith who re-
Bided at that place, in despair at his
inability to procure work, killed his
wif« and two children. He then com
mitted suicide by stabbing himself to
the heart.

IN THE REICHSTAG.
Debate on the Commercial
Treaties Opened.
Chancellor Caprivi's Appeal for
Their Adoption.
Bismarck Will Not Appear Daring
the Debate.
Dispatches Concerning the Chinese Re
bellion—ltaly Willing to Con
sider the New Orleans
Incident Closed-
Associated Press Dispatches.
Beklin, Dec. 10.—In the reichstag,
today, Chancellor yon Caprivi opened
the debate on the commercial treatiep,
making a strong appeal in favor of their
adoption. He dwelt upon the fact that
the present import and export relations
would ruin both employers and em
ployees. The measures under discus
sion were a necessity to preserve Ger
many's husbandry and commerce.
Continuing, the chancellor said the
immediate effect of the treaties upon
the finances of the empire would be
the diminution of the revenue nearly
18,000,000 marks. This was a matter
that required closest consideration.
Speaking on the question of differ
ential treatment of the countries not in
cluded in the treaties, he said it was
needless to speak of Russia. The la
mentable distress in that country would
not be removed for some time, and it
was useless to discuss what would be
done afterwards. As regards the
United States, the two governments
have decided to continue on the
basis of the arrangements of 1885,
whereby the United States received the
most favored nation treatment.
In connection with alleged distress in
Germany, he said the agriculture of the
country "could very well bear, without
risk, a reduction in the tariff rate of
one-half mark. In the matter of wine,
it had been the aim to compel sharp
competition against artificial wines,
schnapps and so-called "French" clar
ets, so as to provide on German soil a
battlefield for Italian wines against
those of France. The reduction of the
duties on the necessaries of life was an
advantage to the working people.
Adverting to the McKinley law, the
chancellor said : "We wish the countries
of Europe to preserve their independence
of America. For this purpose they must
unite together. The treaties just con
cluded will give a sure guarantee for the
future."
Herr Yon Kanitz (Conservative) op
posed the chancellor's policy. He re
gretted that the negotiations showed
that they had only free-trade counsel
lors. He looked forward to the ruin of
the German agriculturist.
The chancellor responded that he had
been aided by the same advisers that
assisted Prince Bismarck.
At a meeting of the Conservative
members of the reichstag, twelve voted
in favor of, and twenty-four against the
treaties. Horr KardofT read a telegram
stating that Bismarck did not intend to
appear during the debate.
CHINESE ADVICES.
Tho Plan of Surrounding tho Itebels
Mot Yet Successful.
London, Dec. 10. —A dispatch from
Pekin states that owing to the delay of
getting the Mongolian tribes together,
the plan of the viceroy to surround the
rebels has not proved successful. An
other battle was fought between the
imperial troops and the rebels, and the
latter were routed and dispersed. This
battle is believed to be the one concern
ing which the Chinese legation here re
ceived advicas yesterday.
Today's dispatches 6tate that the em
peror of China has taken up the study
of the English language.
A dispatch from Rangoon says: China
demanded the withdrawal of the British
posts at Mampoung. The government
replied, declining the withdrawal of the
posts, but instructing the commander
to do his utmost to avoid a collision.
Paris, Dec. 10.—The Journal dcs De
bats states that it has learned on good
authority that the leaders of the anti
foreign movement in China are in com
munication with leading Tonquiuese,
especially with members of the former
reigning family of Annam, "which was
deposed by the French.
FRANCE'S NATURAL ALLY.
Senator St. Hllalre Opposed to Alllauce
with Russia.
Paris, Dec. 10.—Senator Saint Hi
liare, ex-minister of foreign affairs, said
to the Associated Press correspondent
today that he is distinctly opposed to
the attempt to draw France and Russia
into an alliance. He can discover no
common bonds of union between
the most enlightened people of Europe
and a country almost eastern in its
barbarity. The prevalent idea in France
is that this alliance will enable her to
regain her lost provinces, while she will
help Russia to lay hands on Constanti
nople ; but while Russia will not fail to
seize every opportunity of increasing her
empire, she would not embroil herself
with Europe in *t>rder to please France,
and when satisfied would repudiate any
claims the latter power might havo on
her. In his opinion, the most natural
and profitable alliance for France would
be one with England.
FELL 400 FEET.
A Famous Varaohute Jumper's Horrible
Bombay, Dec. 10.—Lieutenant Mans
field, who gained quite a reputation by
thrilling parachute descents from great
heights, met a horrible death here to
day. Only a short time ago he made a
descent of 11,000 feet safely. Today an
enormous crowd gathered at tbe Victo
ria gardens to watch him repeat the
feat. When the balloon had reached a
height of about 400 feet, it burst, and
immediately began to fall to the earth.
Mansfield could not disengage the para
.chute, as it was entangled in the ropes.
He came to the ground with awful
force, and was instantly killed, his
body being mangled in a terrible man
ner.
The St. John Divorce Case.
London, Dec:. 10.—The trial of the
suit of Miss Floience St. John against
her husband was continued today. In
terests the case shows no sign of abate
ment in theatrical circles. Mariua was
again on the stand, but very little inter
eat was elicited. Witness admitted that
once after a quarrel with his wife he
tried to force his way out
of the door threatening to
leave the house. He pushed her,
and she fell on the floor, striking the
table. Miss St. John afterwards left the
house, and refused to live with him. A
year following her separation from him,
Hp became acquainted with the actress
Mario Luella. Marius denied that he
had Mb wife watched. He said his first
wife was divorced from him on the
grounds of adultery and desertion.
Marius declares that if it were not for
Miss St. John's mother and brother, he
and his wife could live happily together.
The New Orleans lucldcut Closed.
London, Dec. 10.—The Chronicle's
ferre.pondent in ltome asserts that the
United States government has given the
Italian government a semi-official prom
ise to so modify the American constitu
tion as to insure rrost absolute protec
tion to foreigners. Upon this promise
the Italian government intimates its
willingness to regard the New Orleans
dispute as closed.
Ve.scl Wrecked and Crew Drowned.
London, Dee. 10.—The French bark
Leouore, Captain Barnard, which sailed
from Coosaw November 13th for Swan
sea, has been wrecked off Mumbles
head. The crew were drowned. It is
believed twelve persons have been
drowned.
CLAIMS AGAINST CHILE.
MINISTER MATTA SUBMITS A RE
PORT TO CONGRESS.
He Says It Is tho Duty of the Govern
ment to Pay Indemnity to Foreigners
for Losses Sustained try ths Looting
of Property During the War.
New York, Dec. 10.—The Herald's
Valparaiso cable says: Foreign Minis
ter Matta, in a report to congress rela
tive to the claims made against Chili by
foreigners, says the government is bound
in duty to administer strict justice. The
Chilean ministry, however, he adds, re
jecte all attempts to formulate claims
which at times have been allowed in
America, owing to the Bpecial circum
stances under which the governments
against whom such claims were pre
ferred, were placed toward those in
whose favor they were formulated.
To countenance the present attempts
would be to create in favor of for
eigners privileges that are allowed
neither by state nor international law.
By virtue of the mere fact that a for
eigner takes up his residence in Chile,
he shows that he likes it, and that it
suits him. He would further wish to
impose on the government the obliga
tion to secure him against downfall and
disastrous events that afflict Chileans as
well as foreigners, and which are en
tirely due to superior force, as in the
case of August 28th and 29th. While
there is no dc.ibt that the claims of
prominent British merchants are in
several cases grossly exaggerated, still
in the end the Chilean government can
not refuse to pay a large portion of the
claims made for the sacking and looting
in Valparaiso, Vina Del Mar and San
tiago, as well as for damages to the
Nitrate railroad and the detention of
steamers.
BKSSIfi'S BABULS.
Sarcastic Comment ou the President's
Message by British Papers.
London, Dec. 10.—The St. James Ga
zette, commenting today on President
Harrison's message, says the most im
portant point in the document is that
part which has reference to the result of
the McKinley tariff. The figures present
ed compare significantly with British
figures, which remain stationary. The
calculations of the supporters of the
McKinley bill are working out much
better than any one in England had rea
son to expect.
The Globe sarcastically comments on
the message, which it says is adroitly
traced on catch-vote lines. "The nervous
Yankees are assured that the govern
ment knows how to climb down, as in
tho cases of Chile and the Bering sea
dispute."
"Lord Salisbury," the Globe adds,
"need not be much frightened at Presi
dent Harrison's tremendous menace
ftpd expression of concern at foreign
encroachment upon territories con
trolled by American government."
The Globe disputes the statement in
the message that ttie prosperity of the
United Stateß is entirely due to the
McKinley bill. On the contrary the
prosperity of the country is due to the
exceptional harvests there at the time
when Europe is short of grain.
Fire at Seattle.
Seattle-, Wash., Dec. 10.—The Me
chanic's Mill company'B large factory on
the tide flats was burned tonight, but
the big sawmill attached was saved.
For a time the Seattle boiler works, the
marine ways, the sawmill of the
Seattle Dry Dock and Ship Building
company, the tug Bix, which was on the
ways, and Moran Bros.' foundry and ma
chine shops were in imminent danger. All
this property is on the tide-flats, nearly
half a mile from the shore line, and
only reached by wharves and bridges.
The city water mains have not been ex
tended to their factories, and only small
private water mains were available.
The fire boat saved the big sawmill,
which was attached to the factory. The
loss of the Mechanics' Mill company is
estimated at $140,000; total insurance,
$28,000.
