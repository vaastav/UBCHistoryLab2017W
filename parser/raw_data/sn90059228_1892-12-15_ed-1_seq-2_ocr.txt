of the human race where civilization

than in success, and when they are face

OUR NAVY.
Its Rapid Development as Shown by the
Report of Secretary Tracy.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. Secretary
Tracy in his report to the president
starts out with a list of vessels in the
navy, and points with pride to the
work accomplished during the present
administration. He says:
"On the 4th of March, 1889, the fleet of the
United States navy, apart from a few old ships
long since obsolete and fast going to decay, con
sisted of three modern steel vessels, of an ag
gregate tonnage of 7,863 tons, and mounting
thirteen 6-inch and four 8-inch guns, thefbrgings
(or which last, as well as the shafting for the
vessels, had been purchased from abroad, as
they could not be made in this country.
"There have been a total of nineteen vessels
of the new navy put in commission during this
administration, of an aggregate tonnage of 54,-
B33 tons, mounting altogether two 13-inch,
six 10-inch, sixteen 8-inch and eighty
two 6-inch guns, all of which, with the
exception of five of the earliest, have been
manufactured in this country. Three
new steel tugs have also been construced and
put in service during this period. There are
eighteen vessels in process of construction and
certain to be completed, should their armor be
delivered within the next year, of an aggregate
tonnage of 93,407 tons and mounting alto
gether twelve 13-inch, six 12-inch, sixteen 10-
inch, thirty 8-inch, thirty-two 6-inch, thirty
eight 5-inch and thirty-four 4-inch guns, all of
which have been or are to be manufactured
in this country. During this period twenty-five
vessels will have been launched, thirteen of
them, including the three tugs, during the cur
rent year, and of all the new ships the con
struction of which has been begun during the
present administration only two will remain on
the stocks on the 4th of March next.
"Our new navy including all vessels built or
authorized, now consists of the following ves
sels: One sea-going battleship (first class
Iowa. Three coast-line battleships (first-class)
Massachusetts, Indiana, Oregon. Two battle
ships (second class)Maine, Texas. Six
double-turreted harbor-defense vesselsPuri
tan. Monterey, Miantonomoh, Monadnock, Ter
ror, Amphitrite. Two armored cruisersNew
York, Brooklyn. One rani. Two protected cruis
ers of extreme speedColumbia, Minneapolis.
Fourteen cruisersOlympia, Baltimore, Chi
cago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Charleston,
Newark, Boston, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Raleigh,
Detroit, Montgomery, Marblchead. One dis
patch vesselDolphin Six gunboatsYork
town, Concord, Bennington, Machias, Castine,
Petrel. One dynamite vesselVesuvius. One
practice vesselBancroft Two torpedo boats
-Pushing, No. 2, making a total of forty-two
vessels.
"All the above, with perhaps one or two ex
ceptions, are essential components of a
fully developed naval force, but the rel
ative contribution to the defensive power
of the United States to be found in
these groups of vessels is not to be
measured either by the number of ships
or the number of tons alone. The develop
ment of the last four years has not been con
fined to ships alone. At the beginning of this
administration the naval establishment was
entirely destitute of certain elements of effi
ciency, each one of which was indispensable
to its practical employment as a fighting force,
and the absence of which, if it had been pos
sessed of a hundred ships, would still have left
it in a condition of paralysis. These were the
following Armor, torpedoes, heavy rapid-fire
guns, armor-piercing shells, smokeless powder,
high explosives.
The secretary details at length noteworthy
progress in the production of these things, and
says the progress noted, by which the United
States has emerged from its condition or help
lessness at sea and by the employment of its
own resources has distanced its most experi
enced competitors, marks an epoch in naral de
velopment not only of this country but of the
world.
Cpming'down to a detailed statement as to
armor tests the secretary tells of the work ac
complished, of the tremendous test to which
the Harvey nickel-steel armor plate was sub
jected, as the result of which improved meth
ods were introduced in the Harvey process, and
continues:
"Tne result has never been equaled or even
approached before by any armor plate, Amer
icaii or foreign. It has demonstrated that
the United States, in the reconstruction of
its new navy, which ten years ago had no
existence even on paper, is enabled to
place upon each and all of its armored
vessels a material the like of which the
world, up to this time, has not seen and that
while vast sums have been spent in plating the
sides of foreign men-of-war with an inferior ma
terial, this country will employ for the purpose
an armor which is not only far more efficient,
but which represents unquestionably, having
reference to the dimensions of plates thus far
tested, the highest development of modern
science, and a development reached by its own
independent efforts.
"Following the example of the United States,
the English government four weeks ago held a
trial of the new American armor, and it is clear
from the highly successful results of the trial
that the United States, instead of being the last
in the race in the construction of vessels of war
or of borrowing its best ideas from abroad, has
set an example in this respect which other
maritime powers will speedily follow."
In reference to ordnance of the navy the
secretary makes extended reference to develop
ments promising greatly improved results.
Comment is also made at length as to powder
manufacture, high explosives and projectiles,
all showing progress of the most satisfactory
nature. With regard to torpedoes, while *he
Howell torpedo has not gone much beyond the
stage of hope with which the department en
tered upon a contract for its manufacture four
years ago, yet the latest trials are giving great
promise.
The secretary speaks with much satisfaction
of the act to "encourage American ship build-
ing," under which the City of Paris and City
of New York are admitted to American reg
istry.
The aggressive policy of foreign nations con
tinues, and this count*v- whether it will or
not, will soon be forced into a position where
it cannot disregard measures which form a
standing menace to its prosperity and security.
On the isthmus our commerce is engaged in a
desperate fight to maintain its foothold. In
the south Pacifio repeated annexations and
protectorates are extending the power and in
fluence of the maritime states of the old
world. Subsidized lines of fast steamers are
completing the circle of maritime communi
cation on the eastern and western coasts of
the Dominion of Canada and fortresses daily
increasing in strength are surrounding our
coast upon the south and east. Under these
circumstances it is imperative to the welfare of
this country that the policy of naval recon
struction* %o successfully carried on in the
past, should suffer no interruption in the
future.
Much space is devoted to Interesting details
as to the operations of ships in commission the
last year in Behring sea and elsewhere on the
work of the marine hospital bureau in connec
tion with cholera quarantine, etc Interesting
statistics are given as to the growth of the gov
ernment toward establishing naval militia, the
creation of which is characterized as one of the
rmost important steps in our recent naval prog
ress.
The estimates in the report for the fiscal year
ending June 30,1894, for navy and marine corps,
including those for public works and increased
navy, are $24,471,498, being 82,713,141 less than
those for the last fiscal year.

Averag-e Prices of Corn, Wheat, Oats and
Other Grain.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.The Decem
ber statistical returns to the depart
ment of agriculture relate to farm
prices. The average value of corn is
39.3 cents per hushel, depressed hy
the |jsurplus of the previous
crop and early distribution.
It is 60 to 70 cents in the east
ern states, 50 to 60 cents in the middle
states, ranging from 42 to 65 in the cot
ton states, 42 in Ohio, 40 in Indiana, 37
in Illinois, 36 in Missouri, 32 in Iowa,
31 in Kansas and 28 in Nebraska. This
is higher in Nebraska than for any
year since 1882 except in 1887 and 1890.
and in Iowa in the same time the pres
ent average value has been exceeded
only in the two years named.
The average price of wheat is 63.2
cents." The next lowest price was 64.5
cents in 1884. In 1886, 1887 and 1890S.
the average was a cent or two below 70.
Last year it was 83.9. Principal state
prices are: Ne York, 85 Pennsyl
vania, 81 Virginia, 76 Georgia, 90
Texas, 75 Kentucky, 67 Ohio, 68
Michigan, 69 Indiana, 64 Illinois,
64 Minnesota, 61 Iowa, 60 Missouri,
58 "Kansas, 52 Nebraska, 50 South
Dakota, 51 North Dakota, 52 Califor
nia, 70.
The average value of oats is 31.0
cents, nearly the same as last year.
Eye, 54.8 cents. Barley, 4X cents.
Buckwheat, 53.4 cents. Potatoes, 67.3
cents per bushel, against 37.1 cents
last year. Hay, $8.49 per ton, nearly
the same as in 1891.
The condition of winter wheat the
first day of December averaged 87.4,
against 85.3 last year. In the Ohio val
ley the range is from 79 to 87, and is
low also in Kansas and Pennsylvania.
It is high in New York, in the south
and on the Pacific coast. In the
southern states and on the Atlantic
coast germination was delayed by
drought, and the same cause delayed
both planting and growth in the Ohio
valley, and materially reduced condi
tion of the crop. The condition of
winter rye is but little better, aver
aging 89.4.
A REIGN OF TERROR.
Blood Flows Freely in tlie Klkhorn Min
ing KeffloTi in West VirginiaThe Mar.
derer of an Officer Lynclied.
WHEELING, W. Va., Dec. 12.Blood
has been flowing down in the Elkhorn
mining region the last few days. As
the record now stands two men have
been murdered, one lynched and a
faithful officer of the law lies mortally
wounded. The first victim of the mur
derers was Officer James Brooks, who
was killed at Keystone, on the
Elkhorn river, in an attempt to sup
pi'ess disorder growing out of the too
free indulgence by the miners in liquor
on pay day.
Officer Dillon and Constable Burton
attempted to regulate a tough colored
man named Cornelius Coffee, when Cof
fee opened fire on them. Dillon was
shot through the right breast, near the
nipple, and diid Burton received a
ball in the body but is expected to pull
through. This shooting, followed
so closely on the murder of
Officer James Brooks, etirred up
great excitement and a close search
was made for Coffee, who succeeded,
however, in boarding a Chesapeake &
Ohio train and was soon over the line
into Virginia. Conductor Griffith rec
ognized Coffee on the train and tele
graphed ahead to the officers at Poca
hontas, who arrested him on the ar
rival of the train.
The West Virginia authorities were
notified and Detective Eugene Robin
son went to Pocahontas, secured his
man and started back to Elkhorn.
When Keystone, the scene oi
the tragedy, was reached a mob
of determined men entered the
train, quietly relieved Robinson oi
his man, proceeded to a tree close by
the track, and Coffee was dangling
from a limb in a few minutes, while
the mob riddled his body with a hun
dred bullets and then dispersed, leav
ing the corpse hanging at the end of a
rope.
GARZA'S MEN IN A FIGHT.
They Attack Mexican BarracksSeveral
Are Killed and They Burn the Build
ing.
LAREDO, Tex., Dec. 12.A band oi
300 followers of Garza crossed the Ric
Grande at lgnacio Zapeta early Sunday
morning and attacked the Mexican
barracks, just over the border, in
the republic of Mexico. The Mexi
can troopers came out to meet the
revolutionists, and at the first fire
several were killed and the soldiers
were driven back. The revolutionists
pushed on and captured the barracks
with its guns and supplies. After
stripping it entirely the place
was burned and all of the sol
diers dispersed and the revolution
ists then returned to their abode
on this side of the Rio Grande.. The
invaders were under the direct leader
ship of Eutrigo Ramon, the right hand
man of Garza. Ramon was slightlv
wounded. Just after the fight th
Mexican authorities rushed out twe
companies of cavalry from Nuevo Lare
do, south cf here, but the barracks had
been burned and the revolutionists
fled. The authorities, on this sid
i sent several companies north and
Uncle Sam's men are now hurzying
through the mesquite to head off th
returning insurgents. A courier from
west of here says that Garza can gel
8,000 men together at a call and thai
Diaz has ordered Mexican troops
massed at the border. Ts^'-^M

JUDGE J. B. HILL, of the Superior
Court, Walker county, Georgia,
thinks enough of German Syrup to
send us voluntarily a strong letter
endorsing it. When men of rank
and education thus use and recom
mend an article, what they say is
tvorth the attention of the public.
It is above suspicion. I have used
your German Syrup," he says, "for
my Coughs and Colds on the Throat
and Lungs. I can recommend it for
them as a-first-class medicine."
Take no substitute.
YOUR HEALTH.
The citadel of life must be guarded
at two points. In the first place there
is the danger of taking cold. We take
cold through the skin and this affects
the kidneys arid the lungs. So inti
mately are these organs connected,
that a cold affects both. In order to
relieve the system, both should be
treated, or rather the whole system
should be regulated. This is done by
Reid's German Cough and Kidney
Cure. It acts as a stimulant and re
stores the organs to action. The
other weak spot is the digestion.
When the food does not digest, it ac
cumulates and causes fever, sickness
and death. The Laxative Gum Drops
will remove all waste material from
the system and do it without pain or
griping. Ask your druggist for these
remedies and see that he gives them
to you.
