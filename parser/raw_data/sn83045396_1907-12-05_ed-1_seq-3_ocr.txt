PRAISES FORESIGHT OF
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
PARTS. Dec. 4. The return to To
klo from Washington of Viscount
Aoki is not generally understood in
Paris, but the best interpretation is
that, it. is only a question between the
embassador and his Ciovcrnment. Jt
j is not believed that his return Js in
ni:y sense directed ' against the United
Si files.
The Temps today dwells at length
upon the naval section of the message
I of President Roosevelt, and says:
I "The difliculties which tho Govern
, ment at Washington and Tokio must
regulate antedates the despatch of the
American fleet lo t ho Pacific; their
origin is economic and moral. The
.rananeac, as a result of the California
incident, cannot fail to see. in this
movement of the. American fleet a
measure of precaution directed against
themselves. But in the present stale
of international relations military i pre
cautions never arc useless precautions.
President Roosevelt understands this
well, and his foresight entitles him lo
honor,"
j.'MIM CROW" MEASURE
NOT VET PASSED
GUTHRIE, Okln.J Dec. -i. After a
spirited argument, during which nu
merous amendments were offered, the
lower house of the Legislature today
adjourned without h.iving passed the
'Mini crow" bill, which was made a
special order for consideration. .
Anticipating the ultimate passage of
such a measure, the Oklahoma Cor
poration coin mission will tomorrow of
ficially publish their "jim crow" or
der, providing for separate coaches for
I whites and blacks.

which enveloped tho city :ind made tho

plo to wondurJntr "what could the matter

thociKht. for tho people blamed him for
tho blue mist that made the day look
dreary, though the sun was shining
"Tho public: doesn't know what Is tho
mutter," said the weather man; "and of
course It Is hard for them to understand
The trouble Is that the smoke is settling
j over tho ritv because there is not enough
, wind stirring to blow It away. The wind
for the past three or four days has not
av'eraged throe miles an hour In any
twenty-lour, and that Is remarkably low.
ly wind machine Is not In the best
working order now. but I am working on
it and expect lo have a regular breeze
blowing In a few days which will sweep
that smoky haze clear off lhrt enrth."
Another warm and beautiful day was
1 allotted to Salt Lake Wednesday while
sister cities in tho F.nst wore blanketed
i in white. Less than live stormy days

i posed to have begun, and it Is the com-
inon prediction among "wise ones." who
prophesy concerning tho weather, that
there will be no whiter in Salt Lake this
year because the Optimist club, which
! originated In this city, with Its smiles
I and cheerfulness, has had such an
ameliorating effect on the frigid severity
of the winter months.

CALIFORNIA FRUIT MEN

rATlVSATXJjE, Cal., Doc. 4. Tho
California fruit. Huvors. in convention
here today memorali.cd Congress for
speedy action iu repealing tho Chinese
exclusion act. The growers contend
that Iouk trial aud earnest, effort have
proved the iinpossibil't' of inducing
i reliable white labor to engage in the
primary processes of production iu or
chard, Vineyard, asparagus, sugar bect.
onion, celery and other great, industries
in which tens of millions of dollars aro
invested. The memorial suys;
"Chinese exclusion ' has depleted tho
Chincso labor and cxtensiou of tho ex
clusion policy to tho .lapancso will
leave these imperiled industries ex
posed to enormous losses and threat
ened with ultimate extinction. The
opposition to Asiastic labor is found
in the cities, duo largely to tho ef
forts of agitators who aro themselves
of alien blood and they and the class
they represent will not do the work
done by the Asiatics at any wage.1'
Tho momori.il was adopted by t.hi
unanimous vote of tho largo conventiou
amid cheers.
When to Go Home.
From the Bluffton, T.nd., Banner:
""When tired out, go homo. When you

show others that; you have reformed, go
home and let your famil' got acquaint

and do tho act there. When yoh fool
Hko being extra liberal, go homo and

When you want to ahino with extra
