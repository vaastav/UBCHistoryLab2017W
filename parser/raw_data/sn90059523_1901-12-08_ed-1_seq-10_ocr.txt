WHAT (JOES UP
Must Come Down,
Nothing is more certain than that the
use of so-called tonics, stimulants and
medicines, which depend upon alcohol
for their effect, is injurious to health in
the long run.
What goes up must come down and
the elevation of spirits, the temporary
exhilaration resulting from a dose of
medicine containing alcohol, will certainly
be followed in a few hours by a corre
sponding depression to relieve which an
other dose must be taken.
In other words, many liquid patent
medicines derive their effect entirely from
the alcohol they contain.
Alcohol, and medicines containing it,
are temporary stimulants and not in any
sense a true tonic. In fact it is doubtful
if any medicine or drug is a real tonic.
A true tonic is something which will
renew, replenish, build up the exhaust
ed nervous system and.wasted tissues of
the body, something that will enrich the
blood and endow it with the proper pro
portions of red and white corpuscles which
prevent or destroy disease germs. This is
what a real tonic should do and no drug
or alcoholic stimulant will do it.
The only true tonic in nature is whole
gome food, thoroughly digested. Every
particle of nervous energy, every minute
muscle, fiber and drop of blood is created
daily from the food we digest.
The mere eating of food has little to do
with the repair of waste tissue but the
perfect digestion of the food eaten has
everything to do with it.
The reason so few people have perfect
digestion is because from wrong habits
Of living the stomach has gradually lost
the power to secrete the gastric juice,
peptones and acids in sufficient quantity.
To cure indigestion and stomach trou
bles it is necessary to take after meals
some harmless preparation which will sup
ply the natural peptone and diastase
which every weak stomach lacks, and
probably the best preparation of this
character is Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
which may be found in every drug store
and which contain in pleasant palatable
form the wholesome peptone and diastase
which nature requires for prompt diges
tion.
One ;-. or two of these ". excellent: tablets
taken after meals will .prevent souring-,

;:. Stuart's.; Dyspepsia' Tablets ? are • equally
valuable for j little childrenj as for adults,

And its progress, often in the face ot
the fiercest opposition that its opponents
could marshal against it, has been one ol
the marvels of the age.
The following history of its career has
been prepared by Rev. Heman C. Smith,
the church historian, for The Globe,
and will be found full of interest. In ad
dition to giving -an account of the trials
to which those who formulated Its creed
were subjected, Mr. Smith also corrects
a popular error that his church and the
Mormon sect are identical. His narrative
is as follows:
Latter Day Sniitt*.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints, erroneously called, the Mor
mon church, had its origin in the state of
New York. It was organized April 6, 1830,
at Fayette, Seneca county. At its or
ganization there were but six members
in Its communion, including Joseph
Smith, who became its presiding elder
and leading exponent.
The events leading up to this organiza
tion were briefly as follows: When Joseph
Smith, "who was born Dec. 23, ISOS, wa3
in his fifteenth year, there was a great
religious revival at Manchester, N. X.,
--where the Smith family then resided. It
began with the Methodists, but finally be
came general with all churches in that
region of country. A part of the family
united with the Presbyterian churoh, but
Joseph preferred the Methodist, yet was
in doubt as tfi which church was most
acceptable to God. In this state of mind
he was reading in the Epistle of James.
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him
ask of God that,giveth to all men liberal
ly and upbraideth not, and it shall be
given him." Acting upon this suggestion
he retired to the woods to comply with
the conditions prescribed. He claims that
while there a vision was presented to
him, in which he saw two personages,
"Whose brightness and glory defy all de
scription." Standing above him in the
air the one pointing to the other said,
"This is my beloved Son; hear Him."
This messenger informed him that he
should not unite with any of the churches
in the neighborhood as their creeds were
an abomination in God's sight.
Further instruction' was received from
time to time which resulted in the or
ganization before mentioned. The church
made wonderful progress, notwithstand
ing determined opposition, which some
times took the form of violence and
sometimes the form of slanderous reports.
The church assumed the form of organ,
{ration described in the New Testament,
namely, apostles, prophets, evangelists,

pastors, teachers, etc. The headquar
ters were removed from New York to
Kirtland, Ohio, early in IS3I, where they
remained until IS3B, when they were re
moved to Caldwell county, Missouri.
On July 2J, 1533, the corner stone for a
temple was laid at Kirtland, Ohio, and
soon after the erection of the building
was begun. The building of the edifice
■was prosccttcd at great sacrifice, and

en an elevated plot of grround south of
the east fork of Chagin river, about three
miles southeast of Willoughby, Ohio,
about nine miles southwest of Paines
ville, and about six miles in direct line
from Lake Erie. The building is of stone,
plastered without and within. It is three
stories high, exclusive of the basement.
The outside walls are about two feet
thick, and the outside of the building is
59x79 feet. The first and second stories
are auditoriums, each 55x65 feet on the
inside, exclusive of a vestibule on the
east end, through which is the entrance
to the building and in which are stair
ways.
During the time the church remained
at Kirtland, a settlement was formed in
Jackson county, Missouri, in and around
Independence, this place having been
designated by revelation as the future
gathering place.
This people coming from the Eastern
states and settling among a people mostly
from the Southern states, and being de
cidedly opposed to the principle of slav
ery, soon came into conflict with their
neighbors, which resulted in the forcible
expulsion of the saints from the county
in 1833, attended by the unlawful destruc
tion of life and property by their ene
mies. They then settled in Clay and ad
joining counties, but finally founded the
City of Far West, in Caldwell county,
which was made the headquarters of the
church and the principal place of gather
ing. They prospered in Missouri, and ac
cumulated property, from which they
were finally driven in the winter of 1838-9.
In connection with this trouble, Joseph
Smith and other leading men were in
carcerated in jail at Liberty, Clay county,
from which they were liberated in the
spring 0f»1539, no charges having been
sustained against them.
The body of the church then settled in
Hanccck county, Illinois, built the city of
Nauvoo, and erected a magnificent tem
ple, wbieh, on account of persecution, was
never completed. Their former enemies
In Missouri succeeded in so prejudicing
the minds of the people of Illinois against
them that hostilities were again opened
in their new home, resulting in the as
sassination of Josep*h Smith and his
brother, Hyrum, at Carthage. 111., on the
27th -day of June, 1844, by a lawless mob.
- After the death of Joseph Smith, there
were several aspirants for the leadership,
prominent among whom was Brigham
Young, subsequently famous as the lead
er of the Utah faction. There was, how
ever, quite a respectable portion of the
membership who rejected the claims of
these aspirants. There were otners, also,
who, after accepting these claims, be
came dissatisfied because of the introduc
tion of doctrines and practices contrary
to the original faith; prominent among
which was polygamy, or plurality ot
wives.
In 1852, the elements who were true to
the original faith formed a reorgaization
at Zarahemla, "Wis., now known as
Blanchardville,- In April, 1860, Joseph
Smith, the eldest son of the prophet,
united with this organization, and was
chosen its president. This was in har
rrony with the law of lineal descent, as
previously understood by the church, and
also in Accord with the predictions made
through his father.
The reorganized church was first incor
porated, under the laws of tne state of
Illinois, in 18i2, with headquarters at
Piano. The members established a pub
lishing house, and the Saints' Herald,
the church organ, was issued until the
year liSl, when the publishing plant, to
gether •with the headquarters of the
church, were transferred to Lamohi,
lowa, its present location. Tfie church
was subsequently incorporated under the
laws of the state of. lowa, with head
quarters at Lamoni, where it has a local
organization of about i.400, with branches
throughout the United States, the British
possessions in America, Australia,
Europe and the islands of the Pacific.
The general offices are at Lamoni. The
officers are Joseph Smith, president; A.
present, and have used their influence in
favor of legislation against this abomi
nation In Utah, and have maintained
since 1863 a mission In Utah for the pur
pose of converting the adherents of the
dominant church there to the original
faith of so-called "Mormonism."
The principles of the faith are Briefly
B. L. Kelley,
Presiding Bishop.
stated In the following epitome issued by
the publishing house;
We believe in God the Eternal Father,
and in His Son Jesus Christ and in the
Holy Ghost.
We believe that men -will be punished
for their own sins, and not for Adam's
transgression.
We believe that through the atone
ment of Christ all men may be saved oy
obedience to the laws and ordinances of
the gospel.
We believe that these ordinances are:
First, faith in God and in the Lord Jesus
Christ; second, 'repentance; third, bap
tism by immersion for the remission of
sins; fourth, laying on of hands for the
gift of the holy ghost; fifth, we believe
in the resurrection of the body; that tha
dead in Christ will rise first, and the rest
of the dead will not live again until the
thousand years are expired; sixth, we be
lieve in the doctrine of eternal judgment,
which provides that men shall be judged,
rewarded, or punished, according to tha
degree eft good or evil they shall have
done.
We believe that man must be called of
God. and ordained by the laying on of
hands of those who are in authority, to
entitle him to preach the gospel and ad- ,
minister in the ordinances thereof.
"We bejieve in the same kind of organ
ization that existed in the primitive
church, viz: Apostles, prophets, pastors,
teachers, evangelists, etc.
We believe that in the Bible is contain
ed the word of God, so far aa it is trans
lated correctly. We believe that tha
canon of scripture is not full, but that
God, by His spirit, will continue to re
veal His word to man until the end of j
time.
We believe in the powers and gifts of ;
the everlasting gospel, viz: The gift of i
faith, discerning of spirits, prophecy, ;
revelation, healing, visions, tongues and j
the interpretation of tongues, wisdom,
charity, brotherly love, etc.
We believe that marriage is ordained of
God; and that the law of God provides
for but one companion in wedlock, for
either man or woman, except in cases
where the contract of marriage is broken
by death or transgression.
We believe the doctrines of a plurality
and a community of wives are heresies
and are opposed to the law of God.
We believe that the religion of Jesua
Christ, as taught in the New Testament
Scriptures, will, if its precepts are ac
cepted and obeyed, make men and women
better in the domestic circle, and better
citizens of town, county and state, and
consequently better fitted for the change
which cometh at death.
We believe that men should worship
god in "spirit and in truth;" and that
such worship does not require a violation
of the constitutional law of the land.

president of the church and his two
counselors, presides over the general af-
