PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE.
Hakes Annual Recommen»
dations to Congress.
ATTACKS ANTI-TRUST LAV
Sherman Act Should Be Amended to
Permit Combinations Which Are In
the Interest of the Public, Says the
President — Urges Legislation to
Safeguard the Wageworkers—Dwells
on Need of Protection For Forests.
Views on the Army and the Navy.
Washington, Dec. S—In Lis message
to congress, read to tlie two houses,
the president said:
The financial standing of the nation
at the present time is excellent, and
the financial management of the na
tion's Interests by the government dur
ing the last seven years has shown the
most satisfactory results. But our
currency system Is imperfect, and it
Is earnestly to be hoped that the cur
rency commission ( will be able to pro
pose a thoroughly good system which
will do away with the existing defects.
During the period from July 1, 1001,
to Sept. 30, 1008, there has been a net
surplus of nearly one hundred millions
of receipts over expenditures, a reduc
tion of the interest bearing debt by
ninety millions, in spite of the extraor
dinary expense of the Panama canal
and a saving of nearly nine millions
ou the annual interest charge. This Is
an exceedingly satisfactory showing.
There has been a reduction of taxa
tion.
Corporations.
As regards the great corporations en
gaged in interstate business, and espe
cially the railroads, I can only repeat
what I have already again and again
eald in my messages to the congress.
I believe that under the Interstate
clause of the constitution the United
States has complete and paramount
right to control all agencies of inter
state commerce, and I believe that the
national government alone can exer
cise this right with wisdom and ef
fectiveness so as both to secure Justice
from and to do justice to the great
corporations which are the most im
portant factors in modern business. I
believe that it is worse than folly to
attempt to prohibit all combinations,
as is done by the Sherman anti-trust
law, because such a law can be en
forced only imperfectly and unequal
ly, and its enforcement works almost
as much hardship as good. I strongly
advocate that instead of an unwise
effort to prohibit all combinations there
shall be substituted a law which shall
expressly permit combinations which
are in the interest of the public, but
shall at the same time give to some
agency of the national government full
power of control and supervision over
them. One of the chief features of
this control should be securing entire
publicity in all matters which the pub
lic has a right to know and, further
more, the power, not by judicial, but
by executive, action to prevent or put
a stop to every form of Improper fa
voritism or other wrongdoing.
The railways of the country should
be put completely under the Interstate
commerce commission and removed
from the domain of the anti-trust law.
The power of the commission should
be made thoroughgoing, so that it
could exercise complete supervision
and control over the issue of securities
as well as over the raising and lower
ing of rates. As regards rates, at least
this power should be summary. Pow
er to make combinations and traffic
agreements should be explicitly con
ferred upon the railroads, the permis
sion of the commission being first
gained and the combination or agree
ment being published In all its de
tails. The interests of the sharehold
ers, of the employees and of the ship
pers should all be guarded as against
one another. To give any one of them
undue and Improper consideration Is
to do Injustice to the others. Rates
must be made as low as is compatible
with giving proper returns to all the
employees of the railroad, from the
highest to the lowest, and proper re
turns to the shareholders, but they
must not, for instance, be reduced In
such fashion as to necessitate a cut
In the wages of the employees or the
abolition of the proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies
engaged in interstate business should
be put under the jurisdiction of the in
terstate commerce commission.
Ample Rewards For Intelligence.
It is to the interest of all of us that
there should be a premium put upon
individual initiative and individual ca
pacity and an ample reward for the
great directing Intelligences alone com
petent to manage the great business
operations of today. It Is well to keep
in mind that exactly as the anarchist
Is the worst enemy of liberty and the
reactionary the worst enemy of order

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.
so the men who defend the rights of ;
property have most to fear from the !
wrongdoers of great wealth, and the S
men who are championing popular i
rights have most to fear from the i
demagogue;? who In the name of popu- 1
lar rights would do wrong to and op
press honest business men, honest men
of wealth, for the success of either
type of wrongdoer necessarily invites
a violent reaction against the cause
the wrongdoer nominally upholds.
The opposition to government con
trol of these great corporations makes
its most effective effort in the shape»
of an appeal to the old doctrine of
states' rights.
The proposal to make the national
government supremo over, and there
fore to give it complete control over,
the railroads and other instruments of
interstate commerce is merely a pro
posal to carry out to the letter one of
the prime purposes, if not the prime
purpose, for which the constitution
Was founded. It does not represent
centralization.
I believe that the more farsightcd
corporations are themselves coming to
recognize the unwisdom of the violent j
hostility they have displayed during |
the last few years to regulation and I
control by the national government e:' I
combinations engaged in interstate busi- .
ness. . I
Labor.
There are many matters affecting la- j
bor and the status of the wageworker j
to which I should like to draw your j
attention. As far as possible I hope I
to see- a frank recognition of the ad- j
vantages conferred by machinery, or
ganization and division of labor, ac
companied by an effort to bring about
a larger share in the ownership by
wageworker of railway, mill and fac
tory. In farming this simply means
that wo wish to see the farmer own his
own land. We do not wish to see the
farms so large that they become the
property of absentee landlords who
farm them by tenants nor yet so small
that the farmer becomes like a Euro
pean peasant.
The depositors in our savings banks
now number over one-tenth of our en
tire population. These are all capital
ists who through the savings banks
loan their money to the workers—that
is, in many cases to themselves—to
carry on their various industries.
Fostal savings banks will make it easy
for the poorest to keep their savings
In absolute safety. The regulation of
the national highways must be such
that they shall serve all people with
equal Justice. Corporate finances must
be supervised so as to make It far
safer than at present for the man of
small means to Invest his money in
stocks. There must be prohibition of
child labor, diminution of woman la
bor, shortening of hours of all me
chanical labor. Stock watering should
be prohibited, and stock gambling, so
far as is possible, discouraged. There
should bo a progressive inheritance
tax on large fortunes. Industrial edu
cation should be encouraged.
Protection For Wageworkers.
There is one matter with which the
congress should deal at this session.
There should no longer be any palter
ing with the question of taking care
of the wageworkers who, under our
present industrial system, become kill
ed, crippled or worn out as part of the
regular incidents of a given business.
The object sought for could be achiev
ed to a measurable degree, as far as
those killed or crippled are concerned,
by proper employers' liability laws.
as far as concerns those who have
been worn out. I call your attention to
the fact that definite steps toward pro
viding old age pensions have been
taken in many of our private indus
tries.
Pending a thoroughgoing investiga
tion and action there Is certn in legis
lation which should be enacted at
once. The law passed at the last ses
sion of the congress granting com
pensation to certain classes of em
ployees of the government should be
extended to include all employees of
the government and should be made
more liberal in its terms. In this re
spect the generosity of the United
States toward its employees compares
most unfavorably with that of every
country in Europe—even the poorest.
The terms of the act are also a
hardship in prohibiting payment in
cases wncre the accident is in any
way due to the negligence of the em
ployee, It is inevitable that daily fa
miliarity with danger will lead men to
take chances thnt can lie construed
Into negligence.
I renew my recommendation made
in a previous message that half holi
days lie gnir.tt-d during the summer to
all wageworkers in government ein
l'loy.
I also renew my recommendation
that the principle of the eight hour
day should as rapidly and as far as
practicable be extended to the entire
work being carried on by the govern
ment.
The Courts.
I most earnestly urge upon the con
gress the duty of increasing the totally
inadequate salaries now given to our
judges. On the whole, there is no
body of public servants who do as
valuable work nor whose moneyed
reward is so inadequate compared to
their work. Beginning with the su
preme court, the judges should have
their salaries doubled.
It is earnestly to be desired thai
some method should be devised for do
ing away with the long delays which
now obtain in the administration oi
justice and which operate with pecul
iar severity against persons of small
means and favor only the very crimi
nals whom it is most desirable to pun
ish.
At the last election certain leaders
of organized labor made a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire ju
diciary of the country, an attack
couched in such terms as to include
the most upright, honest and broad
minded judges no less than those of
narrower mind and more restricted
butlook. Last year before the house
committee on the judiciary these same
labor loaders formulated their de
mands, specifying the bill that con
tained them, refusing all compromise,
stating they wished the principle of
that bill or nothing. They insisted on
a provision that in a labor dispute no
Injunction should Issue except to pro
tect a property right und specifically
provided that the right to carry on
business should not be construed as a
property right, and in a second pro
vision their bill made legal in a labor
dispute any act or agreement by or
between two or more persons that
would not have been unlawful If done
by a single person. In other words,
this bill legalized blacklisting and boy
cotting in every form. The demand
was made that there should be trial
by jury in contempt cases, thereby
most seriously impairing the authority
of the courts. All this represented a
course of policy which, If carried out,
would mean the enthronement of class
privilege in its crudest and most
brutal t r;a and the destruction of
one of the most essential functions of
the judicin rv i u U 11 civilized lauds.
The v, age workers, the workiugmen,
the laboring men of the country, by the
way In which they repudiated the ef
fort to get them to cast their votes in
response to an appeal to class hatred
have emphasized their sound patriotism
and Americanism.
Courts Imperiled by Judges.
But the extreme reactionaries, the
persons who blind themselves to the
wrongs new and then committed by
the courts on laboring men, should
also think seriously as to what such a
movement as this portends. The
courts are jeoparded primarily by the
action of these federal and state
judges who show inability or unwill
ingness to put a stop to the wrong
doing of very rich men under modern
industrial conditions.
There are certain decisions by va
rious courts which have been exceed
ingly detrimental to the rights of
wageworkers. This is true of nil the
decisions that decide that men and
women are by the constitution "guar
anteed their liberty'' to contract to
enter a dangerous occupation, or to
work an undesirable or improper num
ber of hours, or to work in unhealthy
surroundings, and therefore cannot re
cover dai.n-.ges when maimed iu that
occupation and cannot be forbidden
to work what the legislature decides is
an excessive number of hours, or to
carry on the work under conditions
which the legislature decides to be un
healthy.
There is also, I think, ground for
th e belief that substantial injustice is
often suffered by employees in conse
quence of the custom of courts issu
ing temporary injunctions without no
tice to them and punishing them for
contemi t of court in instances where,
as a matter of fact, they have no
knowle.-' o of any proceedings. Pro
vision <uld be made that no injunc
tion or temporary restraining order
issue otherwise than on notice, except
where irreparable injury would other
wise result, and in such case a hear
ing on the merits of the order should
be had within a short fixed period,
an! If nut then continued after hear
ing it Phoni.l forthwith lapse. Deci
sions s': n'.J be roivlcred immediately
and the < ha nee of delay minimized in
every way.
The c nrts are to l e highly com
moii(lop and staiK-hly upheld when
tlun set their faces n.;ain:t wrong
d< in": or tyranny by a majority, but
they are to be blamed when they
fail to recognize under a g.-vrnnient
like ours the deliberate judgment < f
the majority as to a matter of legiti
mate policy when duly expressed ! y
the legislature. The people sin aid
not be permitted to pardon evil and
slipshod legislation on the theory that
the court will set it right. They should
be taught that the right way to get rid
of a bad law is to have the legislature
repeal it and not to have the courts bv
ingenious hair splitting nullify it.
People Themselves to Blame.
I or many of the shortcomings of
justice in our country our people as a
whole are themselves to blame, and the
judges and juries merely bear their
share together with the public as a
whole. It is discreditable to us as a
people that there should be difficulty
iu convicting murderers or in bringing
to justice men who as public servants
have been guilty of corruption or who
have profited by the corruption of pub
lic servants.
The huge wealth that has been ac
cumulated by a few individuals of re
cent years, in what has amounted to
a social and industrial revolution, has
been as regards some of these individ
uals made possible only by the improp
er use of the modern corporation. Cor
porations are necessary Instruments of
modern business. They have been per
mitted to become a menace largely be
cause the governmental representatives
of the people have worked slowly in
providing for adequate control over
them.
Real damage has been done by the
manifold and conflicting interpreta
tions of the Interstate commerce law.
Control over the great corporations do
ing Interstate business can be effective
only if it is vested with full power in
an administrative department,a branch
of the federal executive, carrying out
a federal law. It can never be ef
fective if a divided responsibility is
left in botli the states and the nation.
It can never be effective if left in the
hands of the courts to be decided by
lawsuits.
The courts hold a place of peculiar
and deserved sanctity under our form
of government. Respect for the law is
essential to the permanence of our In
stitutions, and respect for the law is
largely conditioned upon respect for
the courts. But we must face the fact
that there are wise and unwise judges,
just as there are wise and unwise ex
ecutives and legislators. When a
president or governor behaves improp
erly or unwisely the remedy is easy,
for Iiis term is short. The same "is
true with the legislator, although not
to the same degree. With a judge
who, being human, is also likely to
err, but whose tenure is for life, then
is no similar way of holding him to
responsibility. Under ordinary condi
tions the only forms of pressure to

DEADLY SMELTER FUMES.
Federal Authorities Advised That
Forests Are Being Destroyed.
Washington , Dec. 3.— Whether the
Amalgamated Copper company can
operate its smelter plant at Anaconda,
Montana, without providing some
means for consuming the gases, was
argued today before President Roose
velt. A conference on the destruction
in Montana of the forests and vegeta
tion by the fumes from the copper
smelting furnaces was held at the
White house, and it was decided to
haverepresentatives of the copper com
panies come to Washington to be
heard in the matter before any action
was taken.
Those taking part in the conference
were the president, Attorney General
Bonaparte, Counsel L. J. Johnson of
the department of justice, who has
been investigating the matter, Senator
Dixon of Montana, and a number of
agricultural men from that state who
came to Washington to make a pro
test.
Vegetation and forests, including
national reserves in the vicinity of
I the copper smeltiug plants, it is de
! elared, are being destroyed by the
I gases from the smelters, and, as a re
' suit, the water s apply is being in
jured. The farmers desire the smelt
ing companies to place gas consumers
in their, smelters, but the companies
say this could not be done except at
very heavy expense.
Would Amend Land Laws.
Washington , Dec. 4.--The neces
sity for repeal of the timber and stone
act under which, it was asserted, 7,
000,000 acres of public lands had been
taken up by land speculators at low
figures and sold later at phenomenal
advance, were emphasized at tonight's
s -sion of the national conservation
commission, by Senator Nelson of
Minnesota.
Senator Nelson's declaration that
he want( 0 to see the law off the statute
books stirred up a lively discussion.
Among those who took part in the
debate were Senators Flint, Smoot
and TMxon: Representative Shirley
and ex-Governors Blanchard and
Pardee.
Commissioner Fred Beuuett of the
general land otiice, was the principal
speaker aud his remarks, dwelling
upon tiie havoc wrought in the forests
of the west bv land speculators under
the existing act, sounded the keynote
for the views which were later voiced
and which, it is declared, probably
will have weight in the recommenda
lions the commission will make to
President lloosevelt.

MILLIONS _FR0M MINES.
Montana Mineral Product The Past
Year Valued at $58,000,000.
Helena , Dec. 4.—William Walsh (
state mining inspector, has field his
annual report with Governor Norris,
and he estimates the mineral produc
tion of the state for the year to be
approximately $58,000,000 from the
following sources: Copper, $45,000,
000: silver, $8,000,000: lead, $2,500,000:
gold, $2,250,000, or a total of $57,950,
000.
The report comprises about 200 type
written pages, aud deals largely with
the ditl'ereut phases of the chief indus
try of the state. Mr. Walsh tlnds that
a majority of the properties of the
cotninonweath are in a fairly safe
condition as regards ventilation, tim
bering, etc.
During the years 1007-08 Montana
has maintained its position in the first
rank of the leading metal producing
states of tho nation. In face of the
changing conditions» the production
of gold during the last ten years has
shown a marked increase throughout
the state. Considering that the cop
per, gold and silver bearing lodes of
this state have not received much at
tention as compared with the interest
exhibited by the miners and capital
ists of other precious metal producing
states, the record indeed is great.
Referring to the red metal produc
tion, the report says that the great
copper fields of Montana are now fur
uishiug the world with more than 40
per cent of the output. Tho wonderful
mineral wealth of tho state is one of
the greatest factors in its material
prosperity, and no one can Btudy the
operation of its mines without being
impressed with their great importance
to the country.
Live stock Losses In Colorado.
DENVEU, Dec. 2.—Thousands of
cattle on the range are reported to be
starving, with tho prospect that there
will be an unprecedented loss to the
cattlemen during the winter which
opened early aud has caught the
majority of the stock men unprepared.
Peed is selliug at almost prohibitive
prices in the range districts, hay now
bringing $25 to $30 a ton in the Arkan
sas valley and Park range districts,
iu tho Park range district tho first
snow which fell early in October still
covers the ranges, and hundreds of
cattle perished in the first storm.
Many persons have reported the
same conditions from all over the
southeast and western quarters of the
state. The temperature fell below zero
last night generally oast of the con
tinental divide, and causcd great
suffering among the badly nourished
range herds.
