ATTACKS
IN
FORMATION
The German war office asserts that
six thousand British have been made
prisoner during their drive and that
one hundred guns have been taken
from them. A large number of the
guns already have been recaptured.
The four days' battle is described as
the most sanguinary, one that has
taken, place since the days of "Verdun
and the first battle of Ypres.
Artillery duels are in progress be
tween the French and the Germans
north of the Chemin . des Dames and
in the Verdup sector. An attack" by
the Germans north of Flirey in the
latter region was. entirely without re
sult, the Germans being driven back
by the French, suffering heavy cas
ualties and leaving prisoners behind
them.
Likewise, on the Italian front the
fighting is mostly by means of big
guns, the duels being intense on the
northern line in the hilly region be
tween the Brenta and Piave rivers.
No details have yet been received
concerning the negotiations between
:he Germans and the Russians for an
armistice, although the German grand
headquarters announces that an ar
mistice already is in force on sections
of the Russo-German front. . In addi
tion to Austria-Hungary accepting
the proposal of the Russians for a ces
sation of hostilities, Bulgaria also is
to open negotiations-with Russia with
the same 'object in view. . .
Meanwhile the Internal "situation In
Russia remains cute. Infantry and
machine- gun detachmentsrrha've been
sent against the general staff head
quarters at the front, where refusal
met the Bolsheviki regime's ' demand
that proper arrangements be made by
the coromander-in-chief with the Ger
mans for an armistice.

WAR DEPARTMENT'S j
. WEEKLY REVIEW OF EVENTS
Indicates That the Teutonic Allies Are
Trying to Force an Early Decision,
Fearing Exhaustion.
Washington, Dec. 8. An effort by
the Germans to bring on a decisive en
gagement on the western front is sug
gested in the war department's review
of military operations for the week
ending December 1, Issued tonight by
Secretary Baker.
"The outstanding feature of the
general military situation today," says
the review, "is to be found in the ever
increasing mobility of action of the
forces engaged.
"Static warfare is giving Way to ac-
tivitv of movement ' ..... I
"It seems that a decision is being
sought by the enemy, who realizes
that he cannot endure for a much,
longer period the strain of " trench
warfare imposed, by the allies in the
west.
"This explains the effort of the
central powers in massing considerable
forces in order to invade Italy a con
centration of troops made possible by
the internal situation in Russia. This
offensive was undertaken to crush the
Italians and .compel them to sue for
peace.
No Nearer Their Real Object
"Five weeks of desperate fighting
has brought them no nearer their real
objective in this theatre.
"The Italian armies suffered serious
reverses in the early stages of the bat-
tie. They were compelled to give way
and for a time the military situation
along the Italian front was serious.
But the enemy had under-estimated
the resisting power of the Italians and
discounted the splendid morale which
their forces would display when the
full magnitude of the impending crisis
was visualized.
Propagandists Failed in Italy.
"The hoped-for revolution in Italy,
which had been fomented by German
propagandists and which was an im
portant part of the German plan of in
vasion, failed to materialize.
"The Italians, by a magnificent effort,
reorganized their broken forces, rapid
ly reformed their ranks and backed by
the allies, were able, single handed,
to check the Austro-German invasion.
'It would be futile to under-estimate
the great loses, both of men and ma
terial, suffered by the Italians. These
losses should serve to set forth. , in
bolder relief the heroic efforts of those
elements of the Italian armies which
were able to thwart the plans of "the
central empires.'
"The closing of the Swiss " frontier
for two weeks may indicate that the
enemy is transporting large forces,
both men and guns, to the west.
, "The enemy is. constantly -detaching
large contingents from the eastern the
atre..;. AH good troops which can -pos
sibly be spared are being despatched
to other zones of operations. X
. Further Offensives Anticipated.
"So -that;, though the season is not
propitious . for engaging in military en
terprises on a large scale, yet. owing
to the imperative necessity for a con
tinuance of this mobility, furthef of
fensives are to be anticipated.
"On the other hand, the allies will
give the enemy no respite and any of
fensive undertaken by the Germans
will be promptly met by a counter
stroke of great severity.
. "The battle of Cambrai continues
with sanguinary intensity; The enemy
after the first onrush of the British,
by bringing up fresh forces, has been
able to bolster up his weakened defens
es, which for a time imperilled the se
curity of the entire Hindenburg line.
"However, when' the. Germans had
recovered from the first blow and
were able to stand their ground, no
further extensive gains of terrain by
the British were to be anticipated.
Conditions at Cambrai.
"Hostile reaction has been extreme
ly heavy and costly counter-attacks
made by the enemy have enabled him
to retake a certain area as well as
occupy terrain southwest of the new
salient. The British have the situa
tion well in hand and announce the re
pulse of the enemy, who has Deen
driven from the positions captured.
"The situation along the Italian
front is rapidly becoming normal. En
emy assault in the northern sector are
subsiding. Allied co-operation has
now been firmly established, in a
measure reviving the Italians.
In Palestine theatre of operations the
rapid advance of the British on Jerusa
lem, after the fall of Jaffa, has been
temporarily retarded. The activity ' of
the Turkish forces has considerably in
creased and the necessity of bringing
up further reinforcements and material
has caused delay In the offensive oper
ations." MEXICAN OUTLAWS FIRE

Estimates for Year
$13,500,000,000
IN APPROPRIATIONS FOR WAR
AND ORDINARY EXPENSES'
SENT TO CONGRESS
If President's Message Today Does
Not Call for Declarations of War on
Germany's Allies, Members of Con
gress Will Advocate Such Action.
Washington, Dec. 3. Congress is
ready to take up again its part in the
prosecution of the war. The second
session of the sixty-fifth congress be
gan today at noon with brief routine
sessions marked by the receipt of ap
propriation estimates for next year's
war and ordinary expenses aggregat-
ig the vast sum of $13,500,000,000.
Joint Session at 12.30.
Tomorrow the senate and house will
meet in joiot session at 12.30 p. m. to
hear President Wilson deliver his an
nual address. Guidance of the presi
dent in the work ahead is awaited by
tacit agreement. Congressional lead
ers tonight admitted that his recom
mendations, awaited with profound in
terest by the world, virtually would
outline the session's programme.
Speculation as to the nature of the
president's address centers largely up
on the question whether he will reeom-
mend declarations of war by the Unit
ed States against Germany's allies.
General belief is that he will not, at
least for the present, and that con
gress will follow his desires. Senti
ment for such action is widespread,
however, and individual members
probably will introduce war resolu
tions. One or two senators were pre
pared today to offer ruch resolutions
but were prevailed upon to" withhold
them.
A Spirit of Confidence.
A spirit of confidence apparently
pervades congress. Returning mem
bers exchanged views with declara
tions of increased determination to
lend every aid in vigorous conduct of
the war. The leaders predicted that
legislation would be confined largely
to war measures, as the president is
understood to desire. Senator Mar
tin, democratic leader in the senate,
said there would be little time for
other than war problems and Repre
sentative Kitchln, the , house floor
leader, announced after informal con
ferences with colleagues, that he was
disposed to favor the plan. The un
derstanding, is that the first few weeks
of the session, untH after the holidays
recess at least, will. be. open to gen
erf! legislation.

A War Time Aspect.
. A war time aspect was given- to
day's sessions "by .the presence of many
uniformed men among spectators ifl
the- crowded gallaries, and of women
busily plying knittinar needles during
the opening ceremonies.
Senate proceedings were unusually
brief. After adoption of routine res
olutions, the senate adjourned out of
respect to the late Senator Hutsling
of Wisconsin. .The house remained
in session until the Joint committee
appointed . to notify President Wilson
of the return of congress reported, and
then passed the resolution for tomor
row's Joint session. .The usual crop
of bills, resolutions and petitions was
received in the house, iricluding a res
olution by Representative Martin of
Louisiana proposing . 'congressional
investigation of the surar shortage.
Renresentsitive John J. Fitzgerald, of
Brooklyn." N". Y.; chairman of the im
portant house appropriations commit
tee, prominent democratic leader and
a member of consrress of eight years'
service, announced late today his in
tention to resign, effective December
31, to resume the practice of law. His
successor to head th appropriations
committee probably will be Represen
tative Swager Sher'ey of Louisville,
Ky., ranking democratic committee
man. Little business this week Is planned

come derived within it, and not . be

ed upon the citizens' appeal for re
