(Special to The Caucasian.)
Washington, D. C. Dec. 7, 1909.
Both Houses of Congress assembled
ibterday. but adjourned promptly
out of reject to the memory of Sen
:t!or Johnson of North Dakota and
K preventatives Lassiter of Virginia
ami De Armond of Missouri, all of
whom have died since the adjourn
ment of the special session last sum
mer. It was announced that the Presi
dent's message would not be sent to
Congress until to-day. There was not,
however, the usual expectant inter
est as to what the message would
contain, because the members of
Congress as well as the people of the
country generally felt that the Presi
dent had outlined in detail the sub
stance of the message in his many
speeches made in his recent long
swing around the circle through the
North, West, and South. Hence, the
conversation between members of
Congress was in fact directed more
to the remarkable political situation
in England than to our own affairs.
The astonishing action of the
House of Lords in rejecting the bud
get passed by the House of Commons
was the uppermost topic of conversa
tion, the general opinion being that
the House of Lords had committed
rash and dubious action which might
threaten the overthrow of that here
ditary body.
The President's Message a Surprise.
But this evening the one topic of
conversation among members of Con
gress is the President's message,
which is being discussed more for
what it does not contain than for
what it does contain.
The interest as to the President's
message, it may be said, centered
chiefly around how far the President
would go in his recommendation for
advanced legislation on the three
great cardinal policies of the Roose
velt administration, namely, the
trusts, the railroad control, and the
conversation of natural resources.
The extreme conservatives were hop
ing that the President would touch
lightly on these questions, while the
progressives were hoping that he
would come out at least as strong
along the Roosevelt lines as indicated
by the President's speeches in the
West. But to the surprise of every
one, the message contains no recom
mendations on these three great
questions. A Western Congressman
said it is a case of "Hamlet" with
"Hamlet" left out.
The friends of the administration
are pointing out that the President
will take up these three questions
and deal with them more effectively
in special messages, while others take
the position that even if he should do
this, that much valuable time will be
wasted, and that if such messages are
not soon sent to Congress it will be
too late for any effective legislation
along these lines to be enacted at the
present session. It Is understood that
the President's reasons for omitting
these most important domestic ques
tions were that he was not able to de
cide upon a middle course between
the views urged upon him by the re
actionaries on the one side. and the
progressives on the other. But It Is
certain the President will speak out
on these questions later.
Foreign Questions Chiefly Dealt With
Nearly half of the President's mes
sage is devoted to foreign affairs. Of
course, the situation In Nicaragua Is
discussed, but most of the message on
roreign affairs deals with the Far
eastern situation.
The Sugar Trust Frauds. .
A number of members of Congress
had prepared resolutions looking to
Congressional Investigation of the
enormous and multifarious frauds
perpetrated upon the Government by
the Sugar Trust, to say nothing of
the robbery of the public. These are
much disappointed that the President
in his message should ask Congress
not to Investigate these frauds, but to
leave the whole matter to the Attor
ney-General's Office. However, it is
thought that the President's request
win be acceded to and the Attorney
General will be given time to prose
cute the criminals with the belief
that the higher criminals will not be
allowed to escape.
The Economy Plea.
The President strongly urges in
his message that expenses of the Gov
ernment in all departments shall be
cut down to the lowest possible notch
A Western insurgent Congressman,
commenting upon this recommends
"On, said that his conntrv was too
tig and too rich to begin a cheese
paring policy at the expense of na
Wonal growth and development. In
eluding the beautiScatlon of the na
tional capital. He asked significantly
if such a recommendation was made
because it was believed that the tariff
bill placed the duties so high on im
ports that not enough revenue would
be received from it to conduct the
Government in a way fitting to its
size, dignity, and growth!
Strong for Postal Savings Banks.
The friends of postal savings banks
are very much gratified that the Pres-
dent in his message spoke out In
strong and positive terms for the es
tablishment of a system of postal sav-
ngs banks. The president pointed
out that It was not necessary to wait
to see what the monetary commission
recommends and what Congress does
for currency reform before passing a
aw to establish a system of postal
savings banks similar to systems that
have already been adopted in nearly
every other civilized country in the
world and which are- working with
such success and popularity.
The President might even have
gone further and pointed out that no
one step could be taken by the Gov
ernment that would be a greater
check and preventive for panics than
such a system, besides the great ben
efits to result in encouraging the poor
to save up sufficient capital for in
vesting in enterprise or to make a
substantial stake of some kind in the
country.
ro Change the Date of Inauguration.
The District Commissioners have
in their report to Congress strongly
urged that the date of the inaugra-
tion of the President be changed
from March 4th to the last Thursday
n April, and sentiment in Congress
seems to be strongly in favor of this
date or even a later date in May.
The Commissioners have also urg
ed that with the retrocession of that
part of the District of Columbia lying
south of the Potomac and within the
State of Virginia, which was receded
by Congress in 1846, it should be
again taken over. The Washington
Board of Trade has passed a resolu
tion raising squarely the question as
to whether or not such retrocession
by Congress was not unconditional.
and to-day the chairman of that
Board presented these resolutions to
resident Taft. It is understood that
the President is interested in the
question and may later send a special
message to Congress upon this sub-
ect.
It will be remembered that when
the Government was founded it was
provided that there should be a ten-
mile square. strip on the north and
south side of the Potomac, one-half
to be ceded by Maryland and the oth
er half by Virginia, to be known as
the District of Columbia, to be the
site of the Federal Government and
entirely under its control. The Vir
ginia part of this cession was re
ceded, as already stated, In 1846. It
13 now seen that the capital will soon
outgrow the reduced District and will
need the entire ten miles square.
Two Other Congresses in Session.
There met in Washington on yes
terday two other congresses besides
the Congress of the United States, the
proceedings of which will be of no
small interest. One Is the Southern
Commercial Congress and the other
s the National Rivers and Harbors
Congress. Both are well represented
by a large body of fine-looking dele
gates.
SENSATIONAIi RAID IN BURKE
COUNTY.
A Deputy Sheriff and Magistrate Ar
rested for Operating a Blockade
Distillery.
Hickory, Dec. 3. The most sensa
tional revenue raid that ever occur-
ed in this section was made yester
day when special employe C. F. Bla-
ock and posseman H. W. Jones cap
tured Carl Swink, deputy sheriff of
Burke County; Haywood Swink, his
son, and Timothy Lail, a magistrate,
operating an illicit distillery.
Several days ago the officers re
ceived word that a still was in opera
tion in the South Mountain district
of Burke County. Leaving Hickory
yesterday at 8.30 o'clock they drove
20 miles, and on their arrival at the
place described in their information,
it is said they found the still running
full blast, with the above-named men
operating it.
The 50-gallon copper still, the cap
and worm, with nine fermenters,
about 1,000 gallons of beer and four
gallons of low wines were destroyed
A shotgun and one and a half gal
Ions of corn whiskey were conns
cated.
The men were taken Into custody
and brought back to Hickory, where
they were given a hearing to-day be
fore United States Commissioner L
R. Whitener, who bound them over
to the spring term of Federal Court.
In default of $500 justified bond each
they were committed to Jail at New
ton to await trial in Statesville next
spring.
In the month of November, 1908,
Mr. Blalock destroyed a still near
the home of Carl Swink. Swink was
tried for this, but judgment was
withheld - against him for two terms
of court on condition that he let
blockading alone. A warrant was is
sued for his son at the Bame time.
but up to yesterday the officers had
never been able to lay hands on him

the meeting.
TAFT'S JflESSAGE.
President's Message Read in
Both Houses of Con
gress Tuesday.
ECONOMY IN DEPARTMENTS.
The President Advocates the Estab
lishment of Postal Savings Banks,
Ship Subsidy, Civil Pensions, and
Also Urges That a BUI Be Passed
Requiring Congressmen to File
With the Government a Statement
of the Contributions Received and
Expenditures Made in Their Cam
paigns The Nicaraguan Affair.
The message of President Taft
was communicated tc both houses of
Congress Tuesday. The message Is
a lengthy document which we have
condensed for our readers.
Of Central affairs the President
says:
"I need not rehearse here the pa
tient efforts of this government to
promote peace and welfare among
these republics, efforts which are
fully appreciated by the majority of
them who are loyal, to their true In
terests. It would be no less unneces
sary to rehearse here the sad tale of
unspeakable barbarians and oppres
sion alleged to have been committed
by the Zelaya government. Recently
two Americans were put to death by
order of President Zelaya himself.
"At the date when this message is
printed, this government has termi
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government. It may
later be necessary for me to bring
this subject to the attention of the
Congress in a special message.
"Our traditional relations with
the Japanese empire continue cordial
as usual. The matter of a re
vision of the existing treaty between
United States and Japan which is
terminated in 1912 is already receiv
ing the study of both countries.
Government Expenditures and Rev
enues. -
Perhaps the most important ques
tion presented to this administration
is that of economy in expenditures
and sufficiency of revenue.
The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for
the current year ending June SO,
1910, will exceed the estimated re
ceipts by $34,075,620. If to this de
ficit is added the sum to be disbursed
for the Panama Canal, amounting to
$38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to be
paid on the public debt, the deficit of
ordinary receipts and the expendi
tures will be Increased to a total de
ficit of $73,076,620. This deficit the
Secretary proposes-; to meet by the
proceeds of bonds "issued to pay the
cost of constructing the Panama
Canal. I approve this proposal.
'In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year, I directed the
heads of departments in the prepa
ration of their estimates to make
them as low as possible, consistent
with imperative governmental neces
sity. The result has been as I am
advised by the Secretary of the
Treasury that the estimates for the
expenses of the government for the
next fiscal year ending June 30,
1911, are less than the appropria
tions for this current fiscal year by
$42,818,000. So far as the Secre
tary of the Treasury is able to form
a judgement as to future income and
compare it with the expenditures for
the next fiscal year ending June 30,
1911, and excluding payments on ac
count of the -Panama Canal, which
will doubtless he taken up by bonds,
there will be a surplus of $35,931,
000. Most of the great Industrial or
ganizations, and many of the well
conducted railways- of this country
are coming to the conclusion that a
system of pensions for old employes,
and the substitution therefor of
younger and more energetic servants
promotes both economy and efficiency
of the administration.
I am strongly convinced that no
other practical solution of the diffi
culties presented by the superannua
tion of civil servants can be found
than that of a system of civil pen
sions. Frauds in the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds in the
collection of customs revenue at New
York City, In which a number of the
subordinate employes in the weigh
ing and other departments were di
rectly concerned, and in which the
beneficiaries were the American Su
gar Refining Company and others.
The frauds consisted in the payment
of duty on underweights of sugar.
The government has recovered from
the American Sugar Refining Com
pacy all that it is shown to have
been defrauded of. The sum was re
ceived in full of the amount due.
Criminal prosecutions are now
proceeding against a number of the
government officers. The Treasury
Department anw the Department
of Justice are exerting every
effort to discover all the wrong
doers, including the officers and em
ployes of the companies who may
have been nrivy to the fraud. It
would seem to me that an investi
gation of the frauds by Congress at
present, pending the probing of the
Treasury Department and the De
partment of Justice, might by giving
Immunity and otherwise prove an
embarrassment in securing convic
tion of the guilty parties.
In the interest of immediate econ
omy and because of the prospect of a
deficit, I have required a reduction In
the estimates of the War Department
for the coming fiscal year. For the
same reason I have directed that the
army shall not be recruited up to its
present authorized strength. These
measures can hardly be more than
temporary.
The coast defenses of the United
States proper are generally all that
could be desired. There Is,
however, one place where additional
defense is badly needed, and that is
at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay,
where it is proposed to make an arti
ficial island for a fort which shall
prevent an enemy's fleet from enter
ing this most important strategical
base of operations on the whole At
lantic and Gulf coasts. I hope that
appropriate legislation will be adopt
ed to secure the construction of this
defense.
Department of Justice.
The deplorable delays in the ad
ministration of civil and criminal
law have received attention of com
mittees of the American Bar Associa
tion and of many State Bar Associa
tions, as well as the considered
thought of judges and jurists. In my
judgment, a change in judicial pro
cedure, with a view to reducing its
expense to private litigants in civil
cases and facilitating the dispatch of
business and final decision in both
civil and criminal cases, constitutes
the greatest need of our American
institutions. I do not doubt for one
moment that much of the lawless
violence and cruelty exhibited in
lynchings is directly due to the un
certainties and Injustice growing out
of the delays in trials, judgment, and
the executions thereof by our courts.
Of course these remarks apply quite
as well to the administration of jus
tice in State courts as to that in Fed
eral courts, and without making in
vidious distinction it is perhaps not
too much to say that, speaking gen
erally, the defects are less in the
Federal courts than In the 8tate
courts.
(Here the President recommends
that appropriate legislation be enact
ed to remedy the matter in accord
ance with the planks in the Repub-
lean platform.)
Postofnce Department.
The deficit every year in the post-
office Department is J -rgely caused,
by the low rate of postage of 1 cent
a pound charged on second-class mall
matter, which includes not only
newspapers but magazines and mis
cellaneous periodicals. The actual
loss growing out of the transmission
of this second-class mall matter at 1
cent a pound amounts to about $63,-
000,000 a year. The average of the
transportation of this matter Is more
than 9 cents a pound.
A great saving might be made,
amounting to much more than half
of the loss, by imposing upon maga
zines and periodicals a higher rate
of postage. They are much heavier
than newspapers, and contain a much
higher proportion of advertising to
reading matter, and the average dis
tance of their transportation is three
and a half times as great.
Postal Savings Bank.
The second subject worthy of men
tion in the Postoffice Department is
the real necessity and entire practi
cability of establishing postal sav
ings banks. The rate of in
terest upon deposits to which they
would be limited would be so small
as to prevent their drawing deposits
away from other banks.
Ship Subsidy.
Following the course of my dis
tinguished predecessor, I earnestly
recommend to Congress the consid
eration and passage of a ship subsidy
bill, looking to the establishment of
lines between our Atlantic seaboard
and the eastern coast of South Amer
ica, as well as lines from the west
coast of the United States to South
America, China, Japan, and the Phil
ippines. Conservation of National Resources.
In several departments there is
presented necessity for legislation
looking to the further conservation
of our National resources, and the
subject is one of such importance as
to require a more detailed and ex
tended discussion than can be enter
ed upon in this communication. For
that reason I shall take an earl op
portunity to send a special message
to Congress on the subject if im
provement of our waterways.
"Political Contributions.".
"I urgently recommend to Con
gress that a law be passed requiring
that candidates in election of mem
bers of the House of Representatives
and committees in charge of their
candidacy and campaign, file in a
nrooer office of the United States
Government a statement of the con
tributions received and of the expen
dltures incurred in the campaign for
such elections, and that similar leg
islation be enacted in respect to all
other elections which are constitc-
tionally within the control of Con
gress." The plant of the Michael Gheens
Manufacturing Company, at Lincoln
ton, N. C, manufacturers of all kinds
of wooden products, was burned Fri
day morning, the loss being $10,000.
THE MACHINE VIEW.
Collector Brown, According
to Patronage Machine, Will
Not be Re-Appointed.
WANT MACHINE FAVORITES.
Question Is, Who WU1 Have Preel
dentlal Ear? The Organ I ration
Does Not Favor Some Recommen
dations Made by Congressmen
Grant and Morehead Is It a Plan
to Down These Two Enterprising
Congressmen ?
The following Washington special
first appeared in a leading Demo
cratic dally, and now it appears in
one of the Republican patronage ma
chine organs, under a Washington
date line, and as a brand fire new
special. It seems to be the machine
view of the situation:
Special to The Gazette-News.
Washington, Dec. 4. President
Taft has some big. Juicy plums that
he is going to hand out North Caro
lina way shortly after the advent of
the new year. The terms of all the
big Federal office-holders expire in
February and March, and this means
the transfer of some of the most de
sirable political berths in the State
to other hands. Wheeler Martin, the
Collector of Internal Revenue in the
Eastern Carolina District, is probably
the exception, and will not be dis
turbed. Mr. Martin was appointed
two years ago to succeed E. C. Dun
can, who left the Government ser
vice to become a receiver of the Sea
board Air Line. There Is no fixed
term for collectors of internal reve
nue, but tney are generally allowed
to complete four years' service before
they are disturbed. The Indications
are that Wheeler Martin will not
have to worry about his job for an
other two years.
Mr. Brown's Case Different.
But with Collector George H.
Brown, of the Western North Caro
lina District the case is different.
His term will expire early In the new
year. About the same time the Presi
dent will have the appointment of
two District Attorneys and two Unit
ed States Marshals. In addition to
these five big offices there are two
assistant district attorneyships to be
piled With ech office there is con
siderable patronage attached, some of
which is protected by civil service.
District Attorney Harry Skinner is
the first of the big officials whose
terms expire. His commission will
be out of date on February 1, which
means that he will have one month
more of official life after the new
year. Thirteen days later the Presi
dent will have to name a successor
to the acting marshal In the West
ern District. Marshal Milliken re
ceived his re-appointment on Febru
ary 13, 1906, and although he re
signed some time ago, the appoint
ment of the new marshal will date
from February 13 th of the new year.
The term of office of Claudius Dock
ery, Marshal in the Eastern District,
will expire on March 1st of the new
year. District Attorney Holton has
until March 20th to serve, that be
ing the date of expiration of his com
mission.
The Candidates Busy.
Already the various candidates for
Presidential favor are getting busy.
The incumbents desire another term,
and it is certain that they will all
have opposition. The first to arrive
on the scene was W. E. Logan, of
Asheville, who wants the Western
Marshalship, and who has the en
dorsement of his Congressman, the
Hon. John Grant. Mr. Logan prompt
ly subjected himself to the Inspection
test at the White House, which prov
ed so popular with North Carolina
office-seekers when the President
was considering the appointment of
a successor to the late Judge Pur-
nell. It would seem that the meas
uring test and personal inspection
system is as popular as ever with
Tar Heel candidates for office, and
that it promises to have much vogue
as long as the disposition of the big
Federal offices In the State remains
an open question.
The Presidential Ear.
Interest in the contest over these
positions is not whom the candidates
will be, but who will have the Presi
dential ear when it comes to making
the appointments. It has been plain
for some time that the Republican
State organization has the favor of
the administration, and is meeting
with little oppositon in putting over
its patronage program. The question
of interest here is, will Congressman
Morehead and Grant, who are not
working in harmony with the organi
zation, be able to land the men they
have endorsed for two of the three
big jobs that are allotted the west?
Mr. Grant is pulling for Logan for
the marshalship, and it is certain
that Mr. Morehead will do his utmost
to bring about the appointment of
Thomas Settle to one of the three big
positions that are accredited to the
west It is not expected that the or
ganizatlon will be found endorsing
either of these candidates. It is the
understanding here that all sides are
for a new deal, and that none of the
incumbents in the west will be re
appointed. District Attorney Holton
has already had three terms, and this
will be the objection to his re-ap
pointment. Collector Brown's suc
cessor is being kept close under cover
bat it U said here there will be a
new collector.
So far as the east ii concerned,
that Is a matter that Is up to Nation
al Committeeman E. C. Duncan. He
has a death-like grip on the Repub
lican political situation throughout
the east, and the administration, real
ising that it may need delegates very
badly at the next Republican Nation
al Convention, will, in all probability,
give Mr. Duncan a free hand in shap
ing the political slate In the east.
Xo Love for Skinner.
Mr. Duncan has no deep-seated
love for District Attorney Harry
Skinner, who is completing his third
term. It was current gossip during
the judgeship fight that Mr. Duncan
had promised Iredell Mearea the Dis
trict Attorneyship, but that was de
nied. Now it is said that he will rec
ommend the appointment of T. T.
Hicks of Henderson. Herbert Sea
wel), who was Duncan's persistent
candidate for the Judgeship, Is not to
be overlooked In this contest for the
position held by Harry Skinner. How
ever, Duncan feels very kindly also
towards Hicks, whom he endorsed for
the judgeship after he ascertained
that there was no hope for his man
Seawell. The President having per
sonally inspected all of the candi
dates for the District Attorneyship
when he was casting around for ma
terial for the Eastern Carolina judge
ship, it will not be necessary for the
various candidates to subject them
selves to another personal inspection.
Although he found that they were all
spavined or short-winded when they
made their dash for the judicial han
dicap, Mr. Taft may be able to find
one of the number who is able to
cover the short distance District At
torney course.
As for the marshalship in the east,
it is best opinion that Claudius Dock-
ery will get a second term.
