THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE,
president Roosevelt took 30,000
words of good EngllHh to tell Congress
and the American people what
he had to nay on matters pertaining

the people Is that our resources are
as great as those of any nation on i
onrth and we ought therefore to have j
.confidence in our industrial institution!-.
