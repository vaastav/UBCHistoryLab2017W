Halifax, N. 8., Dec. 7. Stricken
Halifax wag swept tonight by a raging
blizzard. So fierce was the storm that
rescue workers were forced to, sus
pend their operations In the devastat
ed section. It is believed certain that
all the Injured buried under the ruins
of shattered buildings have perished
of cold and hunger.
Battered by a biting wind and
blinding snow, the plight of the sur
vivors of yesterday's holocaust Is little
short of desperate The windows and
doors of virtually every house in the
city were shattered by the explosion
which wrecked the Richmond section
and devastated a large part of the wa
ter front. Improvised barricades of
boards give little protection against
the elements and attempts to heat
buildings Into which the snow is stead.
Ily drifting are hopeless.
The city is again In darkness to
night except for.'V, , illuminating nf
"to'j'dt.vt.to a acirfit supply of ofrfumpB
and unless these are carefully screened
they are extinguished us soon as light
ed by the gale which whistles through
uo cruae snutters- only a small per
centage ot the buildings have even
this slight protection from the storm.
Cold Iiicroanes Suffering.
The sufferings of those who es
caped injury have been increased by
the fact that every available blanket,
quilt and comfort has been requisi
tioned for the Hundreds of injured,
in the temporary hospitals. Many of
these are so gravely wounded their
only hope lies in the best of care. Se
rious fears are felt that cold, shock
and exposure will result in an out
break of pneumonia.
A single telegraph wire, bending
dangerously in the "storm, offered
Halifax only a precarious means of
communication with the outside world
and It was feared momentarily that
this line would snap. Telegraph and
telephone companies are making des
perate efforts to provide a makeshift
service and the work is beset with
great dificultics.
While muny generous offers of ma
terial relief have been received and
trainloads of supplies are on the way,
the specter of famine was abroad to
night, for If the storm continues It
may seriously Interfere with railroad
traffic, There Is enough food on
hand for Immediate needs, but it will
last only a short time unless addition
al supplies are received.
" Now Victims Are Found.
As the day wore on the immensity
of the disaster Increased rather than
diminished. Hundreds of bodies were
taken to the morgues and rescue
squads were constantly finding new
victims burled under tons of debris,
until the blizzard forced thm to cease
work. There is every reason to be
lieve that many more will be recov
ered. No concerted effort has been made
as yet to compile a list of the dead,
as every effprt is being made to iden
tify those who perished. The condi
tion of many of the bodies makes this
exceedingly difficult and a large pro
portion of those who lost their lives
will be buried as "nameless dead."'
There Is no reason, however, to
change the estimate of 2,000 dead and
3,000 Injured. - ,
The fires which had been raging
for twenty-four hours In the north
end were brought under control early
today and the city is no longer men
aced by a conflagration.
Business Is Suspended.
While soldiers, sailors and volun
teers were searching the ruins of the
north end today, business was entire
ly suspended. The leading citizens
devoted their efforts to organizing
work of relief and substantial prog
ress was made In this respect.
An emergency meeting of the cltl
zens' was held at the city hall today.
Lieutenant Governor Grant and Dep
uty Mayor Colwell presided. The
large audience listened wtth Intense
interest and ringing applause to the
sheaf of telegrams from far and near
which have poured in with messages
of sympathy and promises of assist
ance, much of which is on the way
and some already here. ' Two tele
grams came from the Duke of Devon
shire, governor general of Canad.a,
who is In Regina.' - a said In one:

Calls to all the nearby towns which
were sent yesterday for medical sup

Mrs. Jesse Jones, director of wom
an's work, Washington,. D. C offered
Red Cross supplies, asked for infor

assured special transportation.
The American ship in port offered
150 bankets. The nanager of the
terminals offered food and shelter for
200 persons.
Captain de Carteret, of the French
Coble company, said he would provide
a temporary hospital. His offei may

is in such dangerous condition that it
may be necessary to vacate it.
A registry has been organized at tho

asked to register their names so that
the missing may be found if possible.
The Bank of Nova Scotia will pro

Rome, Dec. 7. 'On tho As ago

out interruption," says today's offi
cial report.
"The withdrawal of our troops from
Meletta salient to the rear line of
defense was accomplished on Wed
nesday night and yesterday morning
under protection of the artillery
which held up the advance of the en
emy's masses," says the report.
"An enemy party attempting to

machine gun fire.
"In the afternoon, after the most
violent artillery preparation, carried
out from north of the Ronchi valley
lo Monte Kaberlabs, the enemy at
tempted with large forces to break
through our lines south of Galllo. The
attempt failed owing to the bravery of
the fourth Bersaglieri brigade, which,
opposing the enemy at Monte Slsemol
and engaging htm In a strenuous
struggle lasting for twelve hoirt, gave
time for our line to link itself up at
that point also in accordance with
the plan. After six attempts had been
repulsed by our counter-attacks, the
enemy, having suffered severe losses,
was compelled to arrest his advance at
Monte Sisomol."
The latest reports at this hour (7
o'clock In the evening) show that de
tachments of Alpini, surrounded en
Monte" Castelgomberto, preferred
death ' rather than surrender and
either fell by their own hands or were
cut to pieces in the fierce assaults by
the enemy column which had com
pletely surrounded them.: It 's esti

The United States is at war with
Austria-Hungary. With unanimity
except for a negative vote cast in the
house of representatives by a socialist
member both houses of congress
Friday acted favorably on the request
made by President Wilson in his re
cent address- to congress that the
United States declare war on the dual
monarchy, which the president as
serted was "not her own mistress, but
simply the tool of the German gov
ernment." There was scarcely any
debate on the war resolution in either
house.
Shortly after the action of the two
houses of congress, President Wilson
affixed his signature to the measure
which definitely aligned Austria-Hungary
as an enemy country.
The taking up of arms against Austria-Hungary
comes at a most oppor
tune time, for it will permit of the
."t-nuHsd Mutts 'fcn'(Ai'.(i aid to sorely
stricken Italy, where the Austro-Germans
are striving to render the Ital
ians a neglible factor in future opera
tions. Turkey and Bulgaria were ex
clutyjd from the war resolution by the
temper for both houses of both houses
of congress indicates that whenever
President Wilson shall ask for similar
action against these countries, which
he characterized as al$o the-ools of
Germany, acquiescence In his desires
will be forthcoming.
Invaders Made Gain.
That the Italians are being .hard
pressed by the enemy in greatly su
perior numbers ,and in gun power is
indicated by the latest official com
munications. Additional gains have
been made by the invaders in the
Aslago plateau region, but again
heavy price in men or wounded was
was paid by the attacking forces. At
last accounts the Italian lino still was
Intact and the way barred against tho
enemy debouching on the Venetian
plain.
The Berlin war office announce
ment; asserts that 4.000 additional men
have been made prisoner on the Ital
ian front, bringing the' total since the
new offensive begun up to 15,000.
Only minor operations are in prog
ress on the other battle fronts. ,
The cessation of hostilities along
the eastern front has extended to that
part of the line held by the Ruman
ians. An official communication from
Jassy says that as a result of the Rus
sians having proposed an armistice tc
the enemy it had been decided that
the Rumanians hud associated them
selves with the Russians and that
therefore fighting has ceased. The
Rumanians, however, have declined
all attempts by the enemy to frater
nize with them.

Washington,' Doc. 7. A decision as
to the government's attitude toward
tho railroads, involving suggestions
for either government operation dur
ing the war or suspension of anti
trust laws and financial support, still
rested tonight with President Wilson.
No move was looked for until after
Monday, when the president will go
over the entire subject with Senator
Newlands, chairman of the congres
sional committee Investigating trans
portation problems. .
Today, however, brought three Im
portant developments in the situation.
They were: An order by Robert S.

preferential shipment to fuel, fooi
and government supplies over all
general freight -

Washington, Dec. 7. Heads of the
express compunies, before the Inter
state Commerce commission today In
the first hearing on their application
for an Increase of 10 per cent In rates,
said the shippers understand their
need for higher rates for the war
emergency and will present little ob
jection. ,
Before ashing for an advance,
George C. Taylor, president American
Express company, told the commission
that officials of the principal com
panies held conferences with com
mercial bodies and large shippers in
a number of cities to explain that
higher revenues were imperative to
save the companies from actual loss.
In virtually every case, Mr. Taylor
said, the shippers were "sympathetic
and appreciative of our needs."
Only one shippers' representative
appeared today to protest . at the
hearing, .which will continue tomor
row;. William A. Wlmbish of Atlanta
gave notice that on behalf of shippers
of Atlanta, Nashville and Montgom
ery he would object to increases. The
state railroad commissioners asked
the commission for a month in which
to analyze figures presented by the
express companies to show greatly de
creased net Income this year, and
actual loss by some companies.1 The
commission Indicated it might allow
a week or two at most.
E. A. Steadman, vice president and
general manager of the Wells Fargo
Express company, testified that short
age of labor had caused unusual ex
pense to the express companies, ow
ing not only to the necessity of paying
higher wages but also to the increase
in loss and damage resulting from
hiring inexperienced men. Added
causes of loss and damage, he said,
were poor packing by shippers,- over
loading of cars, use of freight' car
ltd congestion, at terminals. -

qarcful study today to tho Interstate
Commerce commission's recommenda
tion to congress that the government
operate the roads or suspend during
the war laws which prevent a com
plete pooling and a consequent uni
fication of all rail systems.
Priority Order Effective Dcec-nilxT 15,
Today's priority order, effective De
cember 15, is the first general order
issued classifying materials for ship
ment. It whs issued at the urgent re
quest of the food and fuel adminis
trations and government departments.
The railroads have opposed It on the
ground that it would returd rather
than expedite shipments.
The materials classified today will
move In the following order:
Railroad fuel, livestock, perlshablo
foods and feeds, military supplies,
other government supplies on special
request, coal for coking plants and
coal for current use. The movement
of coal is prescribed in a manner sim
ilar to a request for preferential ship
ment for specified requirements re
quested of producers several days ago
by Fuel Administrator Garfield.
The new order does not affect pri
ority order No. 2, relative to open
top cars, No. 3, relating to movement
of coal from mines In Utah and Wyo
ming, and No. 4, relating to shipments
of cattle feed to Texas and New Mex

Traffic Manager Suggested.
The intimation that the government
will name a traffic manager came
from the railroad war board, which
hns urged the appointment of such a.
mnn to co-ordinate demands by vari
ous government departments for pri
ority of their shipments. Kdward
Chambers of the Santa Fe system,
now traffic manager for the food ad
ministration, has been suggested for
the place.
Mr. Harrison's statement was in
terpreted as an answer to suggestions
for government operation of railroads.
It was given out at the railroad war
board's offices and replied to declara
tions that the railroads have "broken
down" under the strain of war. After
asserting that the roads could, not be
operated more efficiently under dif
ferent management, Mr. Harrison
said:
."The point of the whole matter Is
that the railroads have been operated
with the highest efficiency and have
until now transported without sub
stantial complaint tho greatest volume
of traffic in the history of tho coun
try. "The roads under direction of the
railroad war hoard are prepared with
out reservation to make common use
of facilities, power and equipment to
accomplish the highest measure of
success In the transportation effort of
the country."
Financial Alii Needed.
Members or tho board feci that
government financial aid Is necessary
If terminals are to be extended. Sus
pension of anti-trust laws to permit
pooling of traffic and profits, would
add to the efficiency of freight move
ment and would dispel hesitancy or.
the part of the roads In putting Into
operation a complete pooling system.
A government loan, according to the
railroad men, would not relieve the
immediate situation, hut would be of
Incalculable value If the war lasts
long and traffic remains heavy. It U
Impossible, they say, to obtain from
banks money for extension because
the money Is going Into Wjir materials.
Heavy shipments of cars and locomo
tives to Fiance and Russia have caus
ed domestic orders to be set aside.
