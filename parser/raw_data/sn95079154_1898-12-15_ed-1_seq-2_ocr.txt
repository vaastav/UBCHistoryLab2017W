THUKSDAY, DECEMBER 15,1898.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President McKinley's annual message
has received at the hands of the press,
generally, a most favorable comment. It
has been pronounced very modest, even
compared with other messages of the Pres?
ident. To the average reader it has ap?
peared as a business-like statement of im?
portant events that have occurred during
the present year, and a brief reference to
our national affairs generally. There has
been a disposition with a few papers, like
the New York Herald, to make unfavora?
ble criticisms upon the message. That
paper in speaking of it say?: "True to bis
habit ol thiowing down the reins, Presi?
dent McKiniey in this inspiring moment
of our history has nothing to suggest, takes
no initiative, strikes the keynote of no new
policy, he merely collate? a dreary rep ?rl
presenting numerous facts, and leaves the
rest to Congress arid to God."
L'pon the whole the message has been
received by the public as a patriotic de?
claration of the views of our Chief Magis?
trate and will be able to win the beany
approval of the mass of the people. It
was wise in President McKinley to avoid
announcing at this time any policy in re
gard to the Philippine Islands, before the
treaty with Spain had been signed by the
Peace Commission, now sitting at Paris
and before the ratification of that treaty
by the Senate. The suggestion of a policy
by the President at this time would be
premature and Injudicious. When th<
islands have become ours in fact and :i
treaty is ratified there can be no doubl
that Mr. McKinley will give expression to
his views in the usual decided manner in
which he has expressed himself upon
every important question that has arise|
during his administration. At the begin
ing of his administration, when he gavt
bis views on the Cuban question, he wa>
criticised by the opposition press and poli?
ticians, who declared that he did not
have any decided convictions upon Ilia:
question, or was afraid to express them,
His caution and conservatism were pro?
nounced by hostile Democracy, cowardice
The sequel, however, showed that Mr.
McKinley not only held positive convic?
tions but when the time ca:ne and neces
Bity demanded he could express and exe?
cute his views. So will it be in cornier
tion with the Philippine question. The
people have seen enough of Mr. McKinley
to have complete faith in his intelligence
courage and patriotism, and w?fnphoh
him in every step he takes for the advance
ment and progress of the nation. It i:
most gratifying to note that the President
in his message gives an uneijualitied en
dorsement and approval to sound money
In this position he will be sustained noi
only by those who elected him President
in 1896 but by many others who did not
agree with him in his views that year.
WILL THEY SUGGEST SOMETHING ?
The Democratic newepapeis are making
themselves ridiculous by decrying the
President's policy in connection with tin
Philippines before he has announced what
that policy will be. They are striking at
what they are pleased to call "imperial
ism," but which is in truth territorial ex?
pansion. Even if the Administration has
determined that the Philippines shall be
held as conquered territory, what better
policy have the anli-annexationists to sug?
gest? They are prolific in criticisms of the
supposed policy of the Administration,but
seem unwillingly or unable to offer any?
thing that will be acceptable or reasonable
as a substitute.
In. dealing with the Philippine question
this country will be compelled to choose
between four distinct policies. The first,
is to restore the islands to Spain, which
would be infamous; the Eecond,is to aban?
don them to the natives to he followed by
prolonged cru.;l internercine strife, which
would be brutal; the third, to turn them
over to other Powers for their supervision
and to accomplish the work which our
people set out to do, which would be
cowardly; or to hold the islands, giving to
them a teiritorial or colonial government
and preparing them for the independent
form of government that maybe desired
in the future, which would be wise and
honorable.
If the anti-expansionists have any policy
to offer that is better than that whbh
they claim is to be pursued by the Adminis
tration, why do they not make it known?
They should do so.or shut up.
A few months ago the Democratic news?
papers said that John Sherman was an imbe?
cile and it was shameful for Mr. McKinley
to make him a member of his Cabinet.
Now Mr. Sherman has pronounced
against the President's Philippine policy
the Democratic journals treat him ss a pro?
found statesman and highly qualified to
speak upon the foreign policy of the
Uuited States.
SOMETHING MORE THAN AMBITION.
Hon. John Sherman said. "I sympa?
thize with Agninaldo in his ambition to
found a republic in the China Sea, near
the equator, and hope be may become
the Washington of a new nation, abso?
lutely free from European and American
influence."
Mr. Sherman seems to foisiet that it
takes something besides ambition to make
a Washington. Aiming the essentials
for such a character as that of Wash?
ington are courage, extraordinary
good sense, sublime patriotism and abso?
lute .honesty. There can be no doubt
that Aguinaldo has the ambition. We
doubt whether he Las the courage, good
sense and true patriotism. If report be
true he is not honest, for he was bribed by
Spain to leave bis native land, then le
turned with the American lleet to help
organize a rebellion be bud been bribed
to abandon. Mr. Sherman shows that he
has no just conception of the true situa?
tion in the Philippines, when be suggests
\ that there is a remote possibility of Agu
naido developing a character anything
like that of our grand George Washington.
Thebe is every indication that there will
be a row in the Democratic camp over the
question of who shali be the leader ofthat
party in the next Congress. It looks like
Bailey, of Texas, will be selected for the
leadership, which ?ill afford a pic nie for
Tom Reed and the Republicans of the
House.
Americals for Peace, and Can Fight for It.
! .St. Louis Globe Democrat.]
Peace is the normal condition of the
United States. This country believes in
international courtesy, fairness and open
i dealing, not in the diplomacy of furtive
! cunning and sinister stratagems. Ameri
cans are as direct in war as in other du?
ties that devolve upon them. Our army
at Santiago pushed .at once to the front
and tried cunclui-ions with rifles. Admi?
ral Dewey detied torpedoes and forts and
as soon as it was light enough engaged the
enemy".- lleet in its chosen position. The
troops at Manila took the enemy's works
by assault. The ships nearest Cervera's
lleet when it came out of the harbor did
not wait for a massed formation, but at
? tacked singly on the shortest lines. What
! the French official characterizes as a lack
of manners turns out on examination to be
straightforwardness, a decisive purpose
wiien tiie time comes to act. Yet it is the
earnest desire of the American people to
be at jier.ee with the world, to deal with all
frankly and honeslly, to avoid rashness or
w.mton aggression, and to keep out ol
^vooked diplomacy, for which they have
JMthcr liking nor adaptiveness.

The bill provides that the Constitution
and laws of the United States locally ap?
plicable shall have the same force and ef?

where in the United states.
This is the usual provision found in the

being laid upon the continued importation
of coolie labor into Hawaii.
currency and postal banks.
Two other bills go into the report, one
relating to Hawaiian silver and treasury
notes and the other to postal savings
banks in Hawaii. The first provides that
unmutilated Hawaiian silver coins shall be
received at par value in payment of all
dues to the Government of the territory of
Hawaii and of the United States, and shall
not again be issued, but shall, on presen?
tation in sums of $501) to either govern?
ment, be purchased and lecoined as bul?
lion at the United States mint at-San Fran?
cisco. All Hawaiian silver certificates are
to be redeemed by the Territory of Ha?
waii on or before January 1, 1902.
The other is a bill which repeals the Ha?
waiian laws establishing postal Bavings
banks, and directs the Secretary of the
Treasury to pay the amounts on deposit in
the postal savings hanks in Hawaii to the
persons entitled thereto, terminating the
interest on all deposits on the 1st of July,
1899. and forbidding further deposits after
that date.
THE PROPERTY. OF THE REPUBLIC.
The report contains an inventory of the
public property of the Republic which now
inures to the United States, which is of an
estimated value of $10,418,740, distributed
a; follows: Government or public land-,
$1,147,790; government lots, sites, etc.,
$1,481,800; department property, $4,789,
240.
The report gives considerable data in re
i gard to duties collected, showing that un?
der the Dingley bill the amount would
. have been much greater than it was. This
comparison shows that the collection for
1897, which was $548,483, would have
i been under the American law $902,706.
i The report recommends the construe
l tion of a cable to the islands, to be under
the control of the United States, which it
says "is demanded by the military condi
! tion existing or liable to exist at any time."

I UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE.
Dramatic Incident of the Cuban
Blockade Between the Porter
and the Wlnslow.
Frequently Jn the anxiety to discover
' whether the strange craft were a l'rie nd
1 or foe without betraying her own pres
i ence, a torpedo boat was fired on by her
I own friends, says Harper's Magazine.
. The blockading squadron was taking
, no chances of any kind of approaching
( dark little craft and used the western
method of shooting first and inquiring
' ufterwards. In the excitement conse?
quent on the signal "Enemy's torpedo
boat sighted," even torpedo-boats en?
gaged each other. This happened one
) of the first nights off Havana. The mo
? ment the signal was made, all the scout
| ing vessels in the vicinity converged at
r full speed toward the point where the
( signal stars had been seen. Suddenly
out of the gloom of the night and right
across the bows cf the Porter rushed o
1 dark object, the sparks from its fun
" nels and the dim outline markingitdis
> tinctly as a torpedo-boat. No ques?
tions were asked by the Porter, for we
. knew no other torpedo-boat of ours
t was on that section of the blockade.
There was a heavy' sea and dense clouds
of black smoke were sweeping down be?
tween us from our funnels. This
1 fortunately caused the first shots to
1 go wild, and instantly, in answer to our
fire, the night signal was shown. It
? was one of our own boats that bad
come from Cardenas with dispatches,
, and she was looking for the flagship. A
j- joking apology and a hearty laugh from
us all ended our little encounter and the
two boats parted, not to meet again for
weeks?not until the Porter, returning
to Key West from her cruise to Porto
i Rico, found the Winslow battle-scarred
! and torn by the enemy's shell, her cap
I tain wounded and her executive officer
f and five of her crew dead. It was no
laughing matter this time.

THL door to the passage leading to

been audible for some time burst into
a loud clamor as Connolly, his wife and
a stout, elderly little woman in a hut

plumes, came into view.
The stout little woman seemed to be
responsible for most of the noise,
which was rich in brogue and musical
in tone. She only stopped talking to
laugh, and her laugh was of that hearty
kind that constrains persons of a full
habit of body especially to slap their
knees and hold their sides. The jnn
itor was maintaining his customary
seriousness of expression and his wife
was smiling pleasantly at the depart?

sentence and kissed her with a re?
sounding smack.

"I tell Mrs. Connolly that speech was
given her to conceal her thoughts, an'
to do her th' justice she's entitled to,
she niver makes my ear-drams ring th'
way some women do. When we settle
down for th' evenin' she opens th' oven
dure for me to put ray feet in an' gets
out her basket av mendin' an' draws her
rocker up to th' lamp. If I happen to
have anythin' to say I say it an'?well,
jwby wouldn't I say it? I don't do all
Ith* taUdn'. She'll say: 'You're right
there,' or That's a true word,' or 'Hush
your mouth, you big idjut,' an' I niver
'try to restrain her flow av language.
Shedon'tabuse her privileges an' oppor?
tunities?that's how ut is.
"I like your style av conversation?no,
I ain't stringin' you. It's improvin',
wthat there is of ut, an' there ain't too
much of ut. A man has time to study j
jout (what ypu mean, or whether ypu.
moan anything when you talk. August
is another man ut'.s n pleasure 1o listen
to. He's restful. When I want to know
August's views on a proposition, all I
have to do is to formulate an' opinion
an' then wait. If them's his sentiments
he says 'Yis, dot is so," an' if lie disagrees
ho shakes his head an' grins. Tt ain't
necessary for him to spind half an hour
av his employer's time to tell me win
John Peter Altpeld nn* him linvc their
points av difFe-rencc. or his objections
to a policy av imperial expansion. He's
a wise hoy, is August, an' he knows th'
value av a close month.
"That was Maggie Dwyer that was
just in here. There's no better woman
breathin' than Maggie is. Phil Dwyer
?you've heard av Phil?I mind him
when he was workin' at anythin' he
could get to do an' Maggie was kecpin'
boarders. She's kecpin' boarders stili
and Phil don't do anything but smok
his pipe an' amuse himself with politics.
That's th' reason, it's likely, you've
niver heard av him.
"I remember when I was a bit av
a boy goin' into Maggie's kitchen.
Thcro was a pan av bread on th' table
that had raised itself an' run over an'
Moggie's arms an' th' bangs av her hair
was bnnkin* up th' overflow. She wag
settin' in a chair, leanin' forward soun-i
asleep. I'll not forget that as long as
I live. Ut was th' only time I saw .Mag?
gie when she wasn't talkin'.
"Phil's got so used to ut that when
Maggie wants to get his (attention
has to grab him by IheGalways. ITe's
like the man lived next ciurc to a boiler
factory an' had insomnia when it shin
down. Well, ut's axcusahle in a woman.
Providence decreed they should talk
and talk they will; but I don't like
talkin' all one-sided. I like to have a
chance to say somethin' wanst in
awhile."
"I notice you don't take any chances."
observed the tenant.
"I'll not be a party to an argument."
returned the janitor. "I'd like to stay
an' hear you awhile longer, hut I have
my work to do. I'm feelin' a little re?
covered now, thank you kindly."?Chi?
