The Message of' President Johnson

While it does not abate the advocacy
of the President's policy, it is courteous
and dignified in its tone toward Con
gressN There is none of the drunken
slang about the "rump Congress :"y or
any recommendation to an! ignorant
mob to hang its leading members.. In
fiict we do not believe Andrew Johnson
wrote it. It bears' the- earmarks of
lenry Stanbery, the Attorney General.
The people, and their representatives
in Congress, care very little what Apr
drew Johnson may say or do. lie ha s
betrayed th e people who elected him,
and he is now powerless. '
Congress will pay very little attention to
him.
CO:GKEM.
- Congress met ou Monday of last week,
and at once proceeded to business. In
the House the section permitting the
pardon rebels in advance of conviction
was repealed. The matter came up in'
the Senate and was debated at length.
he bill permitting negroes to vote in
the District of Columbia will come up
this week. 1 The murders of Union sol
diers in South Carolina, and the New
Orleans murders, will be investigated.
The question of taking the appointing
power from the President and vesting
it in the Chief Justice has been agitated.
Congress sets out vigorously, and ill
no doubt provide for the meeting of the

adjournment of the present Congress,

RANDOM THOUGHTS Ho. SO.
BT TUB EDITOR.
I wcut to Portsmouth tout week and staid
couple of days. Going down Second Street,
met S. P. Drake, of the Republican, and Rev. J. Q.
Gibson, formerly editor of the Stumlard, and more
recently Lieut., aud then Chaplain of the Second
O. H. Artillery, then Agent of the Frcedinan's
Commission, and now preacher in charge at
Hanging Rock and Haverhill. My wife and I
topped with Mr, Glbsou and family during our
stay in the city.
After dinner Mr. Gibson and I went to look at
the now H. E. Church on Sixth Street. It Is a line
brick building, and the slate roof was being put
on. Its original cost was estimated at y.xiw,
. .t . . a jt.m rtt A
but it will cost much more. Here is a building
going up at the cost of only one of the many con.
gregatious in the city, and It will cost more man
the new Court House In this place, which Is bum
ai the expeuso of the whole county and which
some of the ueoule think will ruin tlicm. While
we were looking at the new church, Rev. Mr.
Crook, Psstor of Blglow Chapel, aud Rev. Mr.
Bee, Presiding Elder of the District came along,
Mr. Crook invited us to go and sec bis church,
He could not get the key, bntliy going through
the underground passage, we entered the lecture
room, and then the main room. It Is a very flne,
well arranged building. I attended prayer meet
ing at this church at night, and found there the
poor mechanic aud laborer, aud also the rum
bauker and merchant. It was pleasant to see so
flue a building, provided by the means furnished
by the wealthy, aud equally eidoyed by the poor.
I sow oue lino Presbyterian church, two Epis
copalian, one Methodist Protestant, besides oth
ers. The public schools of Portsmouth are taught In
two large Union school houses, ono on Second
Street, and one further back. They appeared to
be well attended. .'
I visited the principal business houses In the
City. Wherever they advertised I found that they
were prospering. Mr. J. F. Towelt, on Front
Street, la one of the most extensive advertlsors In
the place. His card may be aeon In nearly all the
country papers In this part of tho State. He told
me that his trade' was extensive and was more
permanent and reliable than be had anticipated.
He showed mo his slock of goods. It Is very
large and well selected. He deserves his great
success, as he is oue of the most honorable busi
ness men In the State. He made me a preseut of
a pair of warm, lined kid gloves. Stephenson,
the bookseller, is doing well, but he Is In poor
health. I booght some paper from him. Ho Is
an honorable dealer. Oeorge A. Waller, the hord.
ware merchant, also on Front Street, Is doing
well. Waller Is a clever man, and an honorable
dealer. Mr. Taylor, of the Taj lor House, Is doing
a line business. He ha renovated the old "Biggs
House," killed off the army of bed bugs, and has
made It a llrst class hotel. It deserves, and Is re-
eelvlng, a large patronage. I saw the StamUud
being eagerly read by the guests, while waiting
for dinner. Mr. Taylor evinces his good sense,
by furnishing bis guests with the Standard.
Daroarln & Co., wholesale grocers, aro doing a
steady, lariro business. Itecd, Curtis A Co.,
druggists, on Second Street, are doing well. T,
J. Purscll i, Co,, dealers In ipiecnswarc, glass.
ware &c., on Front Street, aro doing well. They
will renew their advertisement In the Standard.
I called on Mr. Yoakley, Piano dealer, but he was
uot In. I must not omit to mention my old friend
A. W. Busklrk. wholesale grocer. Ho docs not
advertise now, but ho I doing a fair business,
havlnir heen In business for many years. I bail a
pleasant honrs talk with blm.
I met Judge Peck at the drug aturoof Reed,
Curtis A Co. I had not seen the Judge for some
vcsis, He was pretty severe on me when I com.
menced the practice of the law, and I did uoUllke
him very well: but he Is so good a lawyer, and he
had perhaps forgotten the time when he was com
montlng, that I forgive him. The Judgo Is be
ginning Ui look old. I met Elljth (Hover on the
street. Nearly every liody calls lilm Ell. That Is
not his name. I asknd him If he rememliered
when I subscribed for his papor, the "Scioto Cr.
itr." In the year 1SS6. The next yoar he sold out
to Hamilton ft Clark. Edward Hamilton edited
Urn naner for some years, and then went to Ore.

Clark. Bllnn and Hutchlns afterwards conducted
the paper for S lime. 8ieaklng of the paper, I
may mention that I called In the several offices.
The Time$ was neat and In good order, as usual.
Dan. McFarland was at his post, in the TrUiuoe
odlce. Mr. Wetmore waa In the fcpubhea oftlee.
Mr. Drake waa not In. I called on Col. Turley,
Assessor, and had a pleasant talk with hhu.
I saw Mr. Sebastian Klfort, who resided here
soma ten Jeara ago. He I vet in KentucKj
The rebels killed bis son, Henry, during the re
bellion. What any decent, Union man can thing
to reside Id such a place as Kentucky, I cannot
Iruaulne.
During this short stay In Portsmouth, I saw lit
tle of misery or poverty. That there are poor
and suffering person In the place, there can be no
doubt. For Instance, Iaawa little girl, perhap
ten years of age, ragged and bare-foot, going
alonir th navement eating raw turnip. But
such sight are not eomuiou. There is much
wealth and refinement in th place, and I was
pleased to ace the principal business men attend-

Tho papers of the country are very generally
dUcusMU the question : "Shel the Democratic

onto this suhjek at various times, and the more I
hev considered it, the more I am satisfied that it

spirit uv loekelarlry I told him that slrlknine

The pour fellow nut seein It wuz a joke, look au

1. We can't goblile Abllshen votes with nigger

it they'd probacy go to the Inventors thereof,
that thoy mite bo atbourcd uv gcttln tho genoo

Wo are too lute for this. Tho nigger Jus' now It

and wo sbood devote ourselves entlioosiaslically

Afore that time 1 shel hev gone into that other
