FOR AN ANTIPOLYGAMY
Aj BND EENT
I
It is a long time since an antiMor
mon petition was presented in congress
but one was yesterday It came from
West Virginia and was presented by
Representative Dorr of that state The
gist of the petition is that the Mormon
church is engaged in an active propa
ganda and that its missionaries are
making a good many converts in West
Virginia that the victims of this
conversion are mostly families of girls
and the petition takes this as prima
facie evidence of the nefarious inten
tion of the Mormon church to secure
political control in the western states
that such an institution protected by
I the state constitution would be as
much of a standing menace to the In
I tegrity of the Union as was the slave
power of a former generation The
I petition closes by asking congress to
propose an amendment to the consti
tution declaring the practice of poly
I gamy a felony punishable by the laws
of the United States
I It is a pretty safe prediction that so
far as congress is concerned nothing
will come of it though it will probably
I cause some comment in the press and
may call forth some remarks from
some of the pulpits of the land noth
ing more will come of it
The old issues that racked this state
for near half a century and that more
or less disturbed the nation for the
time settled should
same have been I I
there be a revival of them in one form
or another they would be state issues
not national That the question of
church influence in politics will come
up occasionally everybody in Utah ex
pects but that the church has any
gran scheme to control the inter
mountain states will receive no cre
dence in Utah And if it had any such
scheme how would an antipolygamy
amendment to the constitution prevent
it This West Virginia petition shows
that the people of that state who
signed it havent advanced nearly so
much in the past decade as have the
people of this state The nonMormons
of Utah are not worrying in the least
about polygamy why should the peo
ple of West Virginia
TRYING TO SERVE TWO MAS
TERS
The Salt Lake Tribune is about the
only paper in the country that pre
tends to be a friend of silver which
also pretends to believe that the Mc
Kinley administration is friendly to sil
ver The paper or person that can
make such pretensions must be
troubled with mental strabismus Fri
day the Tribune said
We believe the president meant some
thing significant when in his message
he said the American commission l
were not yet ready to report we be
lieve if the matter had been consid
ered settled that before now Mr
Wolcott would have been heard from
in the senate More there are outside
causes at work In the campaign ol
LS96 the statement was repeatedly made
that the WilsonGorman tariff would
oe ample to raise all needed revenue
under normal conditions but that ven
I a higher and perhaps better adjusted
tariff would not avail until the finan
cial basis of the country was broad
ened Even the unexpected and nat
ural advance in the price of wheat
this year has not broken the fore 0
that statement The president must
see this so must some at least of
his advisers Again the winter is upon
I the country and notwithstanding the
shouting of good times in certain quar
ters the calls for charity will be just
as loud and persistent during the next
few months as they were during the
corresponding months of last year
What the president said in his mes
sage about the American commission
ers not being ready to report was sig
nificant and it signified an attempt
to pull the wool over the eyes of that
portion of the people who still give
I
allegiance to the Republican party and
yet retain a belief in silver It prob
ably signifies something else to the
Tribune and it should give its read
ers the benefit of its interpretation
especially as it i < = engaged in the task
of holding up the hands of the ad
ministration in its efforts to do some I
I thing for silver
Secretary Gage has laid his plan for
reforming the currency before the
house committee on banking and cur
rency and he declares his first great
object is to commit the country more
thoroughly to the gold standard No
one will contend for a moment that
this plan is not the presidents Being
his what becomes of the belief of the
I Tribune that the president meant I
something significant when in his mes
sage he said the American commis
sioners were not ready to report Isnt
the Gage bill considerably more sig
nificantMhan the phrases of the mes
sage And what was the Tribunes
I
comment on the Gage bill Absolutely
nothing though it had this to say of
his definition of bimetallism
Secretary Gages definition of bimet
allism as meaning the gold standard
puts us in mind of the old proposal
of the white man to the Indian in di
viding their hunting spoils which was
Ill take the turkey and you take the
turkey buzzard or you take he tur
key buzzard and Til take the turkey
Gages definition is new but the prin
ciple is old
And whose definition of bimetallism
is this It is the definition of the Mc
Kinley administration promulgated by
its official financial spokesman The
McKinley administration sending com
missioners abroad to ascertain Euro
pean sentiment on the subject of in
ternational bimetallism merely that it
may say the pledges of the St Louis
platform have been fulfilled and hold
ing out some false hopes in the presi
dents annual message is offering to
the silver men and bimetallists of the
country nothing but turkey buzzard
And still the Tribune is constantly
trying to make out that the McKinley
administration is yet going to serve
out turkey to the bimetallists It
should reconcile its editorial page of
one day to its editorial page of the
next and likewise learn that It can
not serve two masters at the same
timethe people of the silver produc
ing west and the McKinley administra
tion

PROFESSOR JORDAN PROTESTS
I
It is really amazing that any member
of congress is so small and mean spir
ited that he could seriously propose
that this great government should
enter upon the task of exterminating
the fur seals simply because it has
thus far been impossible to arrive at
any understanding with Great Britain
for the prevention of pelagic sealing
Yet Representative Johnson of South
Dakota has made a proposition look
ing to the immediate killing of all seals
on the seal islands as the readiest way
In which to prevent friction between
this country and Canada Against this
proposition Professor David Stan Jor
i4i =
dan nreside of the Stanford univer
sity enters a strong protest It is
scarcely necessary to point out that
this course of action would not accom
plish the desired end says he As the
animals are never all present at one
time on the islands a remnant would
be left which in time would revive
the herd and with it the whole ques
tion In the meantime every objection
which has been urged against pelagic
sealing would be justly chargeable
against such a slaughter It would be
necessary to lie in wait for the females
and kill them as they came ashore on
land to give birth to their young or to
provide them with nourishment The
young must be slaughtered wantonly
or else left to starve The proposition
is an abominable one without a single
redeeming feature
To slaughter the fur seal herd our
selves because its preservation is beset
with diplomatic difficulties in which
the fault has not all been on one side
would be a confession n of impotence un
worthy of a civilized nation It would
transfer to the United States alone
and for all time the odium for the de
struction of the fur seal herds
I There is a manly ring about this lan
guage that should make Representa
tive Johnson blush when he reads it
The course he suggests reminds one of
the disputes that the Indians used to
have among themselves over the di
vision ot captives after a successful
raid when being unable to agree
among themselves they tomahawked
their prisoners The Johnson proposi
tion isnt one whit more civilized For
congress to authorize such a thing as
Representative Johnson recommends
would be to authorize the putting of an
indelible stain upon the countrys
name
Professor Jordans protest he being
I
a recognized authority on the seal I
I question cannot fail o have much
weight Decency if nothing else
would forbid favorable consideration of
I
Johnsons proposition
BIMETALLISTS AT THE MKIN
LEY SO3
Human nature is t ul and hence
it is that children L on people
are so easily deceive it is
I
better to be deceived oo than
to be always suspicious o jbody
suspicion grows quite as rapidly as
jealousy and hence it is not well to I
give it undue encouragement But
there is a form of suspicion that may
be termed nothing more than a com
I mon sense caution and which when
properly exercised prevents a too fre
quent repetition of the same deception
It is this trustfulness of human
nature that has caused so many bi
metallisits to believe that the Mc
Kinley administration would do some
thing for silver They have hoped and
hoped and yet have never seen their
hopes realized They have looked
upon this Inove and that as the be
ginning of the fulfillment of their
hopes still every move has proven to
be but hope deferred Their expecta
tion may be compared to that of
Sancho Panza when as governor of
Bardtaria he sat down to a feast fit
for a king and each time he prepared
himself to enjoy the choice viands be
I fore him they were instantly removed
I They were used to tantalize and deceive
I him and at last he was content to go
I away asking only a quart of barley
for Dapple and some cheese and a loaf
of bread for himself
Everty time the bimetallists have sat
down to the McKinley political board
expecting that the fair promises for
silver would be realized the McKinley
administration has given them a look
at them and then removed them as
not being good for them And yet some I II I I
of them persist in sitting at the board I I
when they should know that they will
not get even a bit of barley for Dapple
and a piece of cheese and a loaf of
bread for themselves Isnt it about I
time they got up and did a little
rustling for themselves It is the only I
way they will ever get anything
SENATOR RAWLINS AND AN
NEXATION
The other day the New York Herald
placed Senator Rawlins among those
who would vote against the Hawaiian
annexation treaty According to a
Washington dispatch to the San Fran
cisco Examiner of the 17th inst the
senator was wrongly classified He is
reported as saying
I favor annexation The islands are
capable of selfgovernment I have
seen the evils of territorial govern
ment I do not want to see the islands
governed by a policy similar to that
followed by the powers of Europe
Now is the accepted time If we miss
the golden opportunity today we are I
sure to be thrown into a war in the
future We need the islands The peo
ple of this land are of a colonizing
disposition The islands do not lie so
far out in the Pacific but they can be
reached by this influence We are I
stretching out now We must have I
them I have no fears on the score of
annexation It is best for the islands
best for us
We believe this is the first public an
nouncement of his position on the
question of annexation that Senator
Rawlins has made Democrats are di
vided on the question the party not
having made any official declaration on
the subject and it is to be regretted
that there is no such declaration The
senator will not have arrived at any
conclusion on the subject without first
having given it full and careful con
sideration We trust that when the
time for considering the treaty by the
senate comes he will insist on having
it debated in open session
GOV ADAMS COMMITTEE RE
PORTS
The committe appointed by Governor
Adams of Colorado to investigate the
recent Indian troubles in the vicinity
of Lily valley Routt county has filed
its report The report is a complete
vindication for the game wardens and
a correspondingly complete condemna
tion of the Indians
The report says the Indians were the
aggressors that when they learned the
game wardens were looking for them
they dropped their game and in turn
started to look for the wardens that
had the game wardens not dropped
into the Indians camp before they
were aware of their presence the ward
ens would have met with disaster at
the hands of the Indians and the
story of the conflict would have bpen
that whites instead of Indians had been
killed This may all be still most
people will take it with a very generous I
amount of salt The presence of I
squaws in the camp is sufficient tp re j
I
ute any testimony to the effect that
I
the Indians had started to hunt the
game wardens J
The report may be regarded by the
game wardens and their friends as a
highly satisfactory vindication but to
others it will have very much the ap
pearance of a whitewash if for no
other reason than that it is so lauda
tory
The report of the government officers
on the reservation will now be awaited
vltll much interest That it will differ
very materially from that of Governor
Adams committee goes without say

One of Lincolns Pardons
Washington Post Senator Mills has a
new story about Lincoln It was told to
him by a son of John L Helm of Ken
I
tuck who lives in Corslcana
Old John L Helm said the senator I
was a famous character in Kentucky
ie was if I remember rightly a gov
error of the state but at 4ny rate his
position was a most prominent one When
I the civil war came on Helm was a rabid
I secessionist He could not praIse the
I south too highly and he could not heap
I enough abuse on the north He was too
old to go into the war with his sons and
remained at home doing all he could to
help the confederate cause and harass the
Yankees wro invaded the state Finally
he became so obstreperous that the feder
al general who was in command near the
home of Helm put him in prison The old
mans age the high position which he
occupied in the state his wide connection
and especially his inability to do any actual
tual harm were all pleaded In his extenu
tion and he was released Instead of
profiting by the warning the old man became
came more persistent than ever in his
course Once more lie was clapped Into
jail This happened two or three times
and finally while he was still locked up
the matter was brought to the attention
of the federal authorities Even President
Lincoln was appealed to and asked to
commit the ardent southerner to an In
lefinite confinement in order that he
might be curbed
jincoin listened to the statement of the
case with more than usual interest Then
he leaned back and began to speak with
a smio upon his face You are talking
about old man John Helm Well did you
know that I used to live when I was a
boy in Helms town He was kind to me
He seemed to like me as If boy and he
rever lost an opportunity to help me He
seemed to think said Lincoln with an
other of his almost uathetlc smiles that
Iwould probaoly make something of a
man Why when I went down to Illinois
poor and unknown that man gave me the
money to pay my way and keep me until
I got a start John Helm Oh yes I
know him And I know what I owe to
him I think I can fix his case
And then said Senator Mills Lin
coln went to a desk and wrote a few
words The bit of writing Is treasured in
tho Helm household to this day This Is
what the president wrote
I hereby pardon John L Helm of
Kentucky for all that he has ever done I
against the United States and all that he
over will do
