Washington, Deo. 9. President
Roosevelt to-night made public a long
letter addressed to Secretary Root giv
ing correspondence between the presi
dent and former Ambassador Bellamy
Storer, at Vienna, and Mrs. Storer, in
which he says that Mr. Storer's refus
al to answer his letters .and the publi
cation of various private letters justi
fied the ambassador's removal; that
Mr. Storer's publication of private
correspondence was peculiarly ungen
tlemanly and that he (the president)
had stated with absolute clearness his
position and the reason why it was
out of the question for him as presi
dent to try and -et any archbishop
made cardinal, though expressing his
admiraatlon for Archbishop Ireland as
well as leaders of other denominations.
He says he thinks It well that the
members of the cabinet should know
certain facts "which he (Sturer) either
suppressed or misstates." He said he
did not resent the action of the Stor
ers "until it became evident they were
likely to damage American Interests."
He says Mrs. Storer urged him to give
her husband a cabinet place and that
she states Mr. Choate at London and
General Porter at Pariu were not prop
er persons to be ambassadors, suggest
ing her husband in that connection,

to the country" to appoint Archbishop

says the late president never made
, any such request. The president de

Providence, R. I., Dec. 9. Rev.
Ji.seph Hutchinson, rector of St.
Mark'u Episcopal church In Warren,
in the course of a sermon to-day con
demned the decision of the high eccle
siastical court in the Crapsey case, en
dorsed Dr. Crapsey and his belief, and
declared his readiness to stand trial
on the iyfcsue in turn.
In the case of Dr. Crapsey, he sa.id
a high ecclesiastical court has just de
cided that the clergy are forever bar
red against accepting the conclusions
and methods of science or historical
criticism In eo far as they go against
the creeds and liturgy of the third cen
tury. To-day I solemnly and publicly
protest against this finding. I assert
that this court has misunderstood and
misinterpreted the true function and
pirit of the church. I cannot be si
lent and allow that noble minded
priest in Rochester to suffer alone. I
stand here ready for trial in my turn
and until tried and deposed I propose
to remain here.

More Interesting.
Ithaca, N. Y., Dec. 9.Cioach Warner
of the Cornell football eleven said to
day that he was in favor of having
more than eleven men comprise tha
football team. He said he had found
It difficult under the new rules this
season to formulate plays with eleven
men and that he was convinced that
a better game could be player with
twelve men. .
"Each time I have a play figured i
out," said Warner, "it failed to pleasa
me, for it seemed that there was al
ways one player missing."
He illustrated his remark with e dia
gram showing how on the offense the '
drawing back of a lineman for a
plunge revealed the purpose a"nd weak

the meagre seconda.-y defense by ai .
fake p lay. An extra man in the
rear, he continued, would balance the
defence and make the game more a
match on even terms. ' , '
"I would like to see all restrictions
removed from the forward pass," War
ner added; "the rule giving the ball to
the other side when it hits the ground
has made teams afraid to employ it
while the limit of its use to two times)
and compelling it to he passed flva
yards from center have kept the play
from being developed to its fullest ex
