Buchanan's
Dakota is rapping violently at
the door of Congress for admission
to the sisterhood of states. The
60,000 Republican majority given
by the territory at the recent elec
tion does not impress the Democrat
ic members in Congress very favor
ably.
John H, Reagan is being highly
recommended by the Southern
chivalry for postmaster General un
der Cleveland, because he held that
office under the Confederacy. Cer
tainly a good qualificationin the
eyes of the Southern Yankee
haters.
The North Chicago Rolling Mills
have been closed owing to dull
trade, thus throwing 1,800 men out
of employment. Many mills in
Pennsylvania have also been closed.
This will be a hard winter with the

com-
Hon. John L. Gibbs, of Free
born county, is prominently men
tioned in connection with the
Speakership of the incoming legis
lature Mr Gibbs served very ac
ceptably as Speaker in 1877. Mr.
Cornish, of St Paul, is also a can
didate for the position.
At the recent convention of
stockmen, at St. Louis, a proposi
tion was made to ask congress to
set apart a strip of land ten milea
wide extending from Texas to Mon
tana, over which stock can be driv
en from the soiilli to the north dur
ing the grazing season.
Hendricks going about the coun
try thanking the democrats for
electing "Cleveland and Hend
ricks," as he is always sure to put
it, presents a spectacle not unlike
the dog's tail that wags when a
piece of meat is put in the mouth
at the front end of the animal.
Ex.
The negroes of Washington have
asked permission to participate in
the inauguration ceremonies of
March 4th, but the Democratic
managers gave them to understand
that it was to be a white man's
celebration. And yet we are told
that the Democrats are the only
true friends of thp colored man.
Edward A. Keeler, convicted in
October 1881 of robbing the mails,
was releaeed from the Joliet peni
tentiary last Friday, it having been
ascertained beyond a doubt that he
was innocent. Mr. Keeler was
formerly a prominent politician of
southern Minnesota, and grand
foreman of the A. O. U. W. of the
State.
On to-day I he presidential elec
tors will meet at the State capitol
of their iespecti?e States and cast
their ballots for President and Vice
President of the United States, in
accordance with the wishes of the
people as expressed at the polls on
Nov. 4th. Two hundred and nine
teen electors will vote for Cleve
land and Hendricks and one hund
red and eight).two will vote for
Blaine and Logan. Butler, St.
John and Belya are excluded from
the electoral college entirely.
Father P. M. Kaeder, of Crown
Point, Indiana, in a letter to Fath
er Sylvester Malone, of Brooklyn,
iboth being Catholic pastors" who
supported Mr. Blaine) says: "Let
me tell you that three days before
the election several hundred thou
sand dollars came to Indiana for
the Democrats, which was distri
buted in every precinct, $300 com.
ing to Crown Point, $500 to Ham
mond, in this county. With this
corruption fund sufficient votes
were bought in eyery precinct to
carry the State for Cleveland. This,
is a fact and you can give it to the
press if you like."
Fifty-one members of the old
Ninth Minnesota recently met at
Mankato and enjoyed a pleasant re
union. A permanent organization
was effected and Capt. J. M. Dan*
niels of Rochester was elected presi
dent and Rev. A. H. Kerr chaplain.
The next re-union will be held at
the same place, in June next.
Senator Lamar, of Mississippi,
has commenced suit in the United
States Circuit Court against the
Government to recover $100,000
for cotton taken from his plantation
in 1865.Mr. Limar has .waited
until the south "was in the sad-
dle." We do not flatter ourselves
that is the only claim of the kind
thatthis will be presented. It is
only the beginning,
On Saturday, 22d ult., Mrs. John
Wattacounit and a twelve year old
daughter attempted to walk a dis
tance of twelve miles, returning
from the funeral ot the mother's
sister to their home near Oconto,
Wis. They evidently lost their
way and perished by the severe cold
in an intense swamp surrounding
the Shawanee lake. The bodies
were discovered by searching parties
last Friday afternoon, frozen stiff.
At a recent conference of mem
bers of the State board of charities
and correction with several
trustees and superintendents of the
Rochester and St. Peter hospitals
for the insane, it was determined
to ask the legislature to establish a
third hospital. The large geo
graphical extent of the state, and
the long distances that seperate
some of the most populous and im
portant sections from the present
hospitals, give point to this request.
In a gulch near the Plum river,
Neb., has been discovered a village
of petrified prairie dogs. A party
of hunters lately came upon this
village and were surprised to see
the dogs sitting up in their_ho!s.
without fear. Expanniftion showed
that aJL, wefe^ turned to stone.
There were also a number of petri
fied owls and snakes lying about as
natural as in life. Mr. T. J. Smith,
editor of the Western flews, at
Ainsworth, Neb., vouches for the
truth of this story.
The New York Sun in an editor
ial entitled "Manly in Defeat," has
the following kind works to say of
Blaine.
A man's conduct la defeat in a sure teat of his
quality. Especially is thia true of a roan whose
temperament la neither doll nor elugish bat ac
tive and vivacious People sa'd of Mr Blaine,
when the returns began to indicate his defeat.
"It will kill hiraj he is a sick man and will never
set over it, this will be the end of him "Doubt
less many of his friends feared that these predic
tions would be verified. But they are pleasantly
disappointed Mr. Blaine made a speech at Au
gusta on Tuesday evening which shows more abili
ty thin anything he did during the campaign,
proves that he accepts the result of the election
in manly spirit, and vindicates his title to be re
garded to day, and in spite of the election, as one
of the foi eraost, if not Indeed the very foremost,
of the leaders of the Republican party
Cincinnati Commerical Cazette: The
colored people of the South are terri
fied ,and this terror extends to the race
in the North. The readiness with
which those who were slaves believe
that they are to be sold again into sla
very is pitiful. Many ot them have
been subjected to unfeeling jests on the
subject, and their abject alarms have
been mocked bv the brutal wretches
who have imposed upon them. A friend
who has been traveling in the South
tells us that a favorite ceremony of am
usement has been the holding of mock
auctions, in which colored people were
brought to the block and bid off in the
old style with roars of devilish laughter
an awful joke upon the poor black
people There is a reign of terror in
the South, and the chances are that the
black people will flee in enormous num
bers from the gulf states acioss the
Mississippi, and that the whites who
are not inclined to enter the torrent of
barbarism and float with it will stream
across the Ohio.
Chicago Tribune: In reply to
the Schurz-Edmunds-mugwump
cackle that a stronger man than
Blaine might have been nominated
one who would easily be electel
we submit the results of the con
test as a whole. Mr. Blaine has
been defeated by a few hundred
votes in the state of New York,
but his candidacy has effected a
revolution and lifted a prostrate
party to its feet. Some men for
get where the elections of 1882 left
the Republicans. J^r, Blaine's can
didacy has redeemed seven Republi
can statesOhio, Michigan, Wis
consin, Kansas, Colorado, Nevada
and Californiafrom Democratic
rule, and given six of them Repub
lican governors and legislatures and
a gain in Republican congressmen
and in almost every one of these
states, popular as the Republican
state candidates were. Blaine ran
far ahead of them. These victories
were made in the face of hostile
majorities, with the Democrats in
control of the voting machinery,
and in spite of weightier obstacles
than any other Presidential candi
date has bad to encounter.

WASHINGTON LETTER.
Washington. Nov. 29th, 1884.
The Democrats here find it im
possible to conceal their itching
palms. They are not in the habit
of wearing gloves, and the clamor
for office, already loud, bids fair to
develop into a riot.. The questions
every body is asking are Will
Cleveland be able to resist the
pressure, will he desire to resist it.
Tbe general opinion is that he will
desire and try, but will faij. He
will set Mi massive shoulders against
the postern, open it gingerly to
let a few good democrats in, but a
las when he shall try to close it,
he will ftud that the "kw good
democrats'" wej?e tjje entering
wedge of the immense Y\-3haped
"unwashed," and poor Cleveland
will be as helpless as a child in a
stampeded herd of Texas steers
Ltffi

"What are we here for if not for
the offices" were the historic words
of ex-Senator Flanagan of Texas,
and they express the sentiment in
the heart of the hungry, thirsty,
unwashed democracy.
Over 15,000 of the residents of
Washington are in the employ of
the Government in iU various
branches. This estimate includes,
beside the class known as Depart
ment employes, the Army and
Navy officers stationed here, the
employes of the District Govern
ment, those of the Navy yard, of
the city post office, and other local
offices, the employes of Congress
and of the various courts. Natur
ally the deepest interest is felt in
every change of administration,
but imagine what anxiety must pre
vail when the "party of spoils" is
on the war path.
While the Republican party will
be relieved for a time from the re
sponsibility of government, it will
be interesting to watch the Demo
cracy blundering under its unac
customed burdens. It is only to be
hoped that it may blunder upon
some useful reforms. A breadth
of charity is needed to suggest this
possibility, but this is an age of
wonders.
Commenting on the possibility of
Democratic supremacy in the upper
and lower branches of Congress a
distinguished ex-Senator said: "If
they should get their hooks on Con
gress, they will first fix themselves
to stay in power. This they will
do by making two states of Texas,
and admitting Utah as an offset to
Dakota, which cannot be kept out
much longer. That would give
them four more senators and the
Republicans two. Then enormous
sums would be appropriated for,
opening up the South, millions will
be dumped into the Mississippi, a
flood of cotton and other claims
will be worked through.
On next Monday at noon the
stars anisipjges y[\[ beiioisted oTrH
the Senate and House wings of the
Capitol, and at the same hour the
second session ot tbe Forty-eigth
Congress will begin. On that day,
or possibly a day later, President
Arthur will transmit his last an
nual message to Congress, his val
edictory of 1884. He*has not yet
finished this document, which, at
this crisis, will be listened to with
more than ordinary interest.
The inauguration, and the dedi
cation of the Washington monu
ment are the two coming events
most talked of now. The mer
chants, hotel proprietors and the
boarding house keepers who drive
the chief industries of Washington
expect to grow rich off the throngs
of people that these two celebra
tions will bring to the*city. It is
said the inaugural ball will be held
in the new Pension building, which
have to be temporarily roofed with
canvass or paper for the occassion.
The top of the Washington monu
ment is now among the clouds, and
if it does not get too cold for the
workmen up there, they cau give
the finishing touches to the summit
in about fifteen days.
The improvement of this city
goes on in spite of the disturbing
influence which the recent election
has had upon every kind of busi
ness. The reason of this is that the
census here continues to grow, be
cause the attractions of the city as
a place of residence are appealing
each year to a wider circle of tastes.
Now not alone the politicians but
literary people, and those fund of
society find here congenial associa
tions, and surroundings. To supply
homes for this new population de
mands the investment of capital,
and so long as this form of invest
ment yieds more largely than any
other speculation there will be no
lack of investors.
