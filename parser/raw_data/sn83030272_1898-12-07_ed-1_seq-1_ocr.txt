Tarih. Deo. 0. Sir Edmund J. Monson, ths
British Ambassador, in a speech at ths annual
banquet ol ths British Chamber ot Commerce,
ilt parted from tho traditions of dlplomaoy in a
manner that is certainly calculated toexolte
comtnont and. ooncetvably, to Irrltata the
French Govornniont, his remarks containing
outspoken advice to France to avoid annoying
Great Britain.
The speech Itself was no mors offensive than
several recent dallrerancsa by English states
men, but It read strangely coming from an
Am bassador In tho oapltal to which ho is aoorcd
lied filr Edmund evidently recognized this, (or
' he prefaced his remarks with the statement
that " It has not boen without much roflectlon,
I ninv oven say anxiety, that I hnve deolded to
takeadvantageof this occasion to depart some
what (ruin tfao traditional limits by which a
diplomatist Is hampered."
He referred nt somo length to "ths new
diplomacy," which lie described as a conces
Hon to In de lMe Impatience. This,
1 e said, win chiefly dus to the enter
prise ot tho preset, but also partly "to
the originality of the American mind, whlolv
ever restlessly on the watoh for improving
everything, will, perhaps, end In Improving,
dlp'omatlsts of tho old school off tho faco of
the earth. I am quite ready to acknowledge
that there is much good in this Innovation."
Ulpalda tribute to the American Anibassa
dors to Groat Britain, to whose perform
ance of their diplomatic duties and their
labile utterances on both sides of ths
At'antic might be ascribed much of ths
happy development of friendly feellug
(between the nations, and said that while tho
new diplomacy, of which examples had been
i-et in high places, encouraged diplomatists to
apeak out, they must still be guided by obliga
tions of discretion, courtesy and good feeling.
I Tho Ambassador after discursive references
to political affairs, the Franco-Italian treaty,
which he said "took us all by surprise," and the
l'jrla Imposition, plunged into the subject of
I ho Anglo-French relations. Hs declared that
white Groat Britain was steadfastly deter
mined not to permit any encroachmont on
her rights, she had no aggressive designs
which need inspire anxiety In those who
deal honestly and justly with her. "Wecau
afford," he eald. "to admire tho energy of
French colonial expansion, and we can afford
tb rejolco In the prospect It opens ot re
ciprocal benefits to the world, as well
as to France. We ask her to disabuse
herself of all suspicion ot unfair intention on
our part, to try to believe that there
is no general animosity in Great Britain
against the Trench, just as we believe fer
' vsntly that the bulk of the French nation
holds no animosity against the British, and
I to meet us on every -question at Issue
' w!t(j"tlie honest desire for an equitable,
arrangement, and with no afterthought toward,
scoring a diplomatic triumph or driving a one
aided bargain. '
' "I should like to think that the Ideas I have
ao Imperfectly expressed will find acceptance
by those who' ore directly or Indirectly,
responsible for the direction of the
national policy. I would earnestly ask
them not to countenanoe and to abstain
from a continuance af that 'policy of pinpricks.'
which, while it can only procure ephemeral
I gratification to a short-lived Ministry,
must Inevitably perpetuate across tho
Channel In I tat Ion which a high-spirited
nation must eventually feel Is intoler
able, I would entreat them to resist the
temptation to thwart British enterprise by
ltty manoeuvres, such as I grlevo to see sug
gested by the proposal to sot up educational
establishments as rivals to our own In ths
J newly conquered provinces oltho Soudan.
i "6uoh Ill-considered provocation, to which I
confidently trust no'offlclal countenance will be
then, might well have the effect of con
certing that poller of forbearance which Is
fir from taking full advantage of our
ment victories and our present posi
tion, which has been enunciated by our
highest authority, Into the adoption of meas
ures, which though they evidently find favor
with a no Ineonslilorablo party In Great Britain,
are not, I presume, the object at whloh French
aentlmont Is aiming.1'
London, Dee.7.-The JOailu Nru$ regards Sir
Edmund Monson's speeoh as being very ro
rnarkablc. nnd says It seems to show
that the relations between ths two coun
tries are still for from satisfactory. It
adds that tho admirable courtesy and
moderation with which ho Invested his words
only make the substance of them moro sig
nificant. Either the speech was a great
indiscretion or a deliberate move In the diplo
matic game. If it was tho former the situation
will become graver than it Is, and If It was the
latter the situation Is already gravor than It
I seems.
The .Daffy OrapMo condemns the attributing
of the departure from the traditions of the old
diplomacy to the supposed American Inaugura
tion of the new diplomacy.
It says It fails to rocall any American Am
bassador addressing his countrymen in lon
don on matters that were in controversy be
tween the United States and Great Britain,
The Cnronfrfe does not treat the matter very
seriously, but characterizes Sir dmund's
allusion to a short-lived Ministry as reckless.
Ths Ttltsraph, while agreeing with tho senti
ments of HIr Edmund Monson, regrets the time
and place chosen for their expression. It says;
It may be new diplomacy, but It Is very like
old-fashioned Indlsoretlon. Wo aro unable to
eoncelve Col. Hay or ths late Mr. Bayard dllat
lng on the errors and misconceptions of the
Government to which they were aocredlted."
The Timet entirely approves of Sir Ed
mund's remarks. It admits that It Is
n' for an Ambassador to freely dls-
International affairs in the country
w which he Is accredited, but. It
f "re, Sir Edmund dared to be uncon
"ntlonal and to think more of the end
"n of the traditional limitations of means.

DEATHIN ELEVATOR WRECK
DISLODGED WEIGHTS CltVSIl A CAB.
IN V. S. INSURANCE CO.'S BVILDINO.
Secretary Grlften Killed. Director Cnuld
well Badly Hurt, and Other Directors,
Who Had Been Heating, Slightly In
juredAccident the First ot the Kind.
Sevon hundred and fifty pounds In Iron
weights fell from the top ot the elevator shaft
ot tho United Statos Fire Iniurance Company's
oloYon-story building at (55 William street yes
terday afternoon, crashing through tho root of
the car, killing tho Secretary ot thooompany.
Walter II, Griffon, and eorlously Injuring
Thomas W. Cauldwell, a dtroctor, Ot the six
other men in the car not ono escaped injury,
bnt tholr hurts were not serious. Ths car was
at the ground Door when tho accldentoocurrod.
Mr. Grlften and Mr. Cauldwoll wore just about
to leave tho car when theyworo struofc down.
Mr. Griffon, who was 40 years old, lived at 223
West 100th street. For nlxtoen years ho had
been with the Unltod States Insurance Com
pany, and for tho last ten yonrs had boon Its
Socrctary. Ho loaves a widow, but no children.
Ho was a member of tho Sooloty of Frlonds.
Mr. Cauldwoll, who Is at tho Hudson Street
Hospital, suffering from frncturo of the skull,
Is a lawror at 11 Pine street, and lives in Mor
ristown. All those In tho car, oxoopt ths elevator man'
Dennis Sullivan, were directors of the com
pany nnd had been attending n mooting In ths
directors' offices on the eighth floor. The
meeting waq over at 2 o'olook. Halt of thodl
reetorn enmo out In a body nnd orowdad Into
the car. After them cams Richard Barrett, a
clerk ot the company. Ih Inc at 734 Do Kalb av
enue, Brooklyn. Ho stood near tho door,
which was just olostng when Mr. Griffen and
Mr. Cauldwoll camo toward tho elevator, call
ing out for the car to watt. Seeing thatthore
would not bo room for both ot them. Barrett
stepped out to give up his placo nnd wait tor
tho next car. That net undoubtedly saved his
lite Tho Hecrotary and the director thanked
him and Flopped in, nnd tho car went down,
taking with it. besldos those two, tho following
passenger . Wlllloiult. Moore, A, Walter Hnv
lland. George II. Smith Edmund A. Hurry and
Edward D. Thurston. Barrott stood by the el
eiatnrshaft, and what he saw of the acoldont
ho tolls tlui's :
"I could tell when tho elevator reached the
ground floor by tho bump. It was a pretty hard
one. but it htul been bumping lately a good
deal, nnd I didn't think much of It. Then I saw
a big. durk object shoot down the shaft, nnd
when several others followed it close tbecthor
I realized that the weights woro falling, and
ran downstairs as fast as I could. As I ran I
could hear, above the sound of my own foot
steps, the crash of tho weights and the cries ot
the meu. I didn't suppose one of them would
come out alive."
Why and how those weights came to fall is a
matter for elevator experts to clear up; but
what happened, so fur as those in the ear can
tell. Is this: When within about a foot of less of
tho bottom, the car, which Is of Iron framo
work. shot down with a bump hard enough to
jolt tho nnssongera soveroly. Sullivan, tho
elevator man. threw the door open, nnd Mr.
Catihlwell started forward, closely followed by
Mr. Griffen Koine one In tho enr said;
"Something ought to bo done about this ele
vator "
At that Instant tho forward part of tho iron
lot tlcfl roof was pounded In by the Impact of
several welghw ntriklng at almost the same
spot and the big blocks of Iron came tumbling
through. Mr. Cauldwell fell access thn door
way, struck, on tho head and shoulder, and
Secretary (JrlfTen. with his head crushed In.
dropped across him. Tho others pressed back,
cut and brulstfd by tho ironwork that pressed
In upon them, The noise of the smashing of
the ironwork and the men's cries of alarm
brought many of thoso In the building to the
scene. Those In the car crawled out over Mr.
Griffen and Mr. Cauldwell. Mr. Smith was
stunnod and had to be dragged out. All tho
others were able to walk. Mr. GrlUcn was
lifted from Mr. Cauldwell and died as he was
being carried toward the door.
The other men got Mr. Cauldwell into the
company's office on the ground floor, and Po
liceman Conlan of tho Old slip station, who was
first at tho place, sent In an ambulance call. In
response to which ambulances from tho Hud
son Street Hospital and Gouverneur Hospital
enme. One ot the former took Mr. Cauldwell
away, while tho other surgeons busied them
selves looking after the Injuries ot those who
had been in tho car. At first It was deemed
beet to tnko Mr. Smith to a hospital, but a brief
examination showed that he was not seriously
hurt and he wont home. The body of Mr.
Griffen was taken to the Morgue and tho sur
vivors of tho accident scattered to their various
homes, with tho exception of the olevntor man,
who was arrested Allot them woro too much
upset br tho shook to give any nceount or tho
accident In. fact, none of them was able to
tell anything more than that just as thoy were
about to leave the car tho weights came burst
ing through the roof.
" It's a wonder wo weren't all killed," was the
unanimous sentiment.
That they wore not seems to have been due
to tho fact that tho roof gave way only at tho
front, all tho weights going through the breach
made there. When a reporter saw the eleva
tor car just as it was immediately after tho ac
cident therowero six of ths weights lying on
tho floor, all but one of thorn broken in liair.
The weights were oblong, being about 30
Inches by 4 Indies by 4 Inches, and woro of
Iron, welching 125 pounds apiece. The f rame
workof thoelovatortop at the front was bent
In two feet or more. The cablo above tho car
was slack to the extent of two yards or more.
What had happened, as nearly as anybody In
the building could judge, was that the coun
terbalance weights had In somo way got out of
the framework In which they rest and had fallen.
Theso weights ascend and descend In a broad
groove, or frame, extending up tho rear wallof
the shaft, and rest In a wrought Iron cage or
holdor, suspended by a eable' which runs ovor
the cablo wheel at the trip of theshnft and Is
attached to tho elevator car at the rther end.
Thus, when tho car Is at the bottom of the
shalt the weights are at the ton. nnd vleo vorsa.
Tho weights are held In pluoe between two up
rightR and by nn overlap of wrought Iron. They
aro not fastened to the cable, but It sets In
f:rooves In the weights. When the oar bumped,
t Is surmised that tho concussion eltherpulled
some of the weights olean out ot the top ot tho
frame, or twisted them out at the front. Not
allot the weights fell. The elevator Is an Otis
electric elevator, and the fact that the Otis
people havo never before had an accldontof
this sort to deal with makes conjeoturo' the
moro difficult. There havo been cases where
the weights havu come crashing down within
the framo, but never whero thoy have escaped
from It.
Dennis Sullivan, tho young man who was run
ning the elevator, was substituting for tho reg
ular man, and had been In charge only two
days. It wan thought thnt to hlsinoxpnrienco
the accident might havo boen due, but ho ears
that he hns been running elevators for nearly
five years and has never had an accident before.
Thnt tho bumping ot the elevator wasTnot nls
fault Is shown by the testimony of W. T. Craft,
one of tho directors of the company, whose
office Is on the ground floor, next to ths ele
vator shaft. He said yesteway :
" For a week or more the elevator hasn't been
running smoothly. It's been coming down
with a bump at the bottom. A couple ot days
ago It came down so hard that the passengers
were shaken up badly and the olectrlo lights
were broken, Then this present elevator Doy
took to running down veryslowly and carefully
from the first floor. I was in ray office at 2
o'olook. and I heard and felt the shock of the
elevator oomlng down; but I didn't think any
thing of It particularly, because It wasn't as
hard a bump as I had folt before. Then I
heard the crash and the cries and ran out to
find Mr Or) (Ten lying across Mr. Cauldwell In
the hallway, both with their feet still In tho ele
vator, and the ethers huddled back In the rear
ofthecar. If ths main partof tho roof hadn't
held they'd all have been killed. It's ourious
that those weights, which woro at the rearot
the shaft, should have struok the front ot the
car."
W. W. Underbill. President of tho United
States Insurance Company, came burying
down ns soon as he learned of tho accident. He
was greatly shocked at Mr. Or I (Ten's death and
said i hat he could not understand how the acci
dent happened.
"If I hadn't been detained by a question,"
he said: I should probably have boen in that
elavatormyself."
It was said In the building yesterday that two
of the city Inspectors from the Building De
partment had inspected the elevator yesterday
morning. William F, Manlce, the owner of the
building, eald that he knew nothing of any In
spection at that time, lie declined to discuss
the acoldent. Sullivan, who Is 23 years old and
lives at 20 Prlnoe street, was arraigned In the
Centre Street Police pourtyeaterdayafternoon,
and was turned prr to tb Ooroaec. Jj that
he said was that hehadnownrnlng of the ao
cideiit nnd could not possibly havo prevented
It. Coroner Hart caroled him In the oustody of
his counsel, . . ,.
Tho building at 55 William street was put up
seven years ago. and the elevator was put In at
that tlmo. At the offices ot the Otis Elevator
Company It was said yesterday that the acol
dent was without a parallel In their experi
ence. Tho elevator had alwnys run woll. It was
snld. barring tho usual stoppages for minor
repairs, and there had beon no complaints
made there ot Its not running smoothly re
cently. Two experts wore sent to Investigate
by the company and to prepare n report. Pend
ing that report none of the officers of the com
pany would oxpreas any opinion othsr than
that the acoldont was a remarkable one.
Mrs. Cauldwell and hor brother-in-law came
to the Hudson Street Hospital last night to pes
her husband, who was still unconscious. She
did not see him, as her brother-in-law feared
that the sight would unnerve her.

POltPOISES IN THE EAST KITEE.
People Along the Waterfront Entertained
by nn Unusual Spectacle.
A school of porpoises, about six In number,
made tholr appearance In tho East River oft
Grand street at 8:30 o'clock yesterday morn
ing. Tholr gambols attracted tho attention ot
a gang of men working on a plor at the foot of
Grand street, and soon all the piers In ths
neighborhood woro dotted with people watoh

mained off Grand street tor ten minutes, leap

toward tho navy yard and then back to ths
New York shore, swimming In a circle.
Ferryboats, tugboats and all sorts of rher
craft were stopped to permit thoso on board
them to wntoh tho porpoises. A deckhand on

France Not to Be Cnnght Napping In Case
nf Trouble with Great Britain.
St. John's. N F Dee. 0. The Frenoh cable
steamer Admiral Courbot has been hero for two
days coaling for extenslvo cable operations on
tho Grand Banks. It Is Intended to relay a sec
tion of tho two French cablos from Brest, ono
ot -which runs to St. Pierre and tho other to
Duxbury, Mnss. She will cut thorn on the Inner
side of tho Banks and lay new sections across
these ledges In entirely nltered directions from
tho present cables, and beyond tho outer edge
ot tho Banks Sho will pick up the main cables
again and splice tho now lines thereto, thus re
storing perfect connection with Franoo.
Tho object is to so change the location of
these French cables over the Grand Banks as
to make It difficult, If not Impossible, for tho
British to cut the cables In war time and so cut
off the French possessions In this hemisphere.

SENATE LEADERS CONFER.
PEACE TEEATT LIKELT TO DE RATI
FIED AT THIS SESSION.
No Effective Demooratlo Opposition Re
garded as Probable Efforts to Avoid an
Extra Seaslon Army Legislation Agreed
Upon Work tid Out for Congress.
WABHirfOTON. Doo. C At a conference of tho
leading Republicans ot tho Senate, hold In the
room ot the Committee on Appropriations this
afternoon, tho first steps woro taken tbward
mapping out a plan ot legislative action for the
session. Senators Aldrlch. Allison and Spoon
erand other members ot ths Btoerlng Com
mtttoe were thoro, and although no definite
programme was agreed upon, thoso prosent
woro able to arrango a general understanding
ot what ought to be dona and what can bo done.
In the first place the sontlroent In favor ot
avoiding an extra session was almost unani
mous. It depends, ot course, altogether upon
the President to say whethor thoro shall be an
extra session, but it Is the Intontlonof the Sen
ato leaders, as expressed In to-day's confer
ence, to shapo matters so as to put ths respon
siblllty ot having one entirely upon Mr. Mo
Elnley. Tho quostton of the ratification of the poaco
treaty jras discussed moro fully than anything
else, and after tho conference adjournod It was
stated with muoh posttlvenossbf some ot the
most practloal Senators prosent that the
treaty would bo ratlflod at this session.
Something was said about tho alleged
purpose ot Senator Gorman to hold tho
Demooratlo sldo ot the chamber solid against
the treaty, and to tako advantage ot the divided
opinion on the Republican side to prevent a
vote. It was tho opinion ot those at to-day's
conference that Mr, Gorman would fall
Ignomlnlously If ho should attempt such a
task, because It Is known that there
aro several Senators on tho Demooratlo
sldo who are more than anxious to vote for
a treaty ot peace. It was pointed out, mort
over, that much Demooratlo opposition will be
nullified when it is loomed that the treaty con
tains no provision binding this Government to
any future policy In the Philippines. There
was some division of opinion on this point in
the conference, but the majority of those pros
ant were oonfldent that tho treaty would go no
further than to provide for present conditions.
While no programme of work was mapped
out It was the general understanding that It
would be necessary to pass the Hull bill. In
creasing tho army to 100.000 men, one of 'the
main arguments In its favor as an emergency
measure being tho Intimation in the President's
rnosaago that he would not muster out tho
volunteer army until the incroase In the regu
lars should be provided for.
It is also probable that the bill reorganizing
the army will bo passed. Gen. Miles has
submitted ono bill to tho Secretary of War,
but this seems to have been set aside,
for the present nt least, in favor of a
measure which Is boing drawn up by Adjt.-Gen.
Corhln. A strong fight will bo mado against
tho Hull bill, ot course, both by the National
Guard organizations and by those who are op
posed to any Incrcaso of tho regular army. It
is thought that the arguments in favor of an
Increase and reorganization at the prosent
-time will be sufficient to pass the bill.
It was tho consensus of opinion In the con
ference, therofore. that a treaty ot peace will hs
ratified at this session, thnt the Army bills will
be passed, and that no extra session will be
necessary because ot ths failure ot the Con
gress to act upon Important legislation.

Peace Commission lasted four hours, begin
ning at 2 o'clock this afternoon and closing at
0 o'clock.
After tho adjournment Judge Day confined
himself to tho statement that good progress
had been made, but from other sources the
correspondent of The Sun learned that ques
tions submitted by the Spaniards and arising
from the protocol were chiefly consldored,
propositions and counter-propositions being
made. Everything Is reported to be now run
ning smoothly.
The purely American questions have not as
yet been broached.
An American attacli6 of the commission said
this ovonlng that he bellovod the commission
would finish its work on Friday.
The eight essential articles of the treaty of
peace woro definitely agreed to yesterday. To
day eleven subsidiary articles, arising from ths
protocol, wero submitted by tho Bpanlards,
somo being agreed to, others rejected, while
still others were modified.
Thoro is good authority for stating that the
treaty will be signed this week, though it is un
certain how comprehensive It will be. Prob
ably sundry matters will bo left open for subse
quent treatment, as both sides are apparently
anxious to have the proceedings concluded.
Now that the prlnoipal points havo been ob
tained by the Americans, the Bpanlards express
themselves as being weary of tho business and
as anxious to see the end of the nogotlattons.
It is believed that tho Spaniards have rocolved
fairly satisfactory, treatment on the minor de
tails, which have already been cabled, though
at present Tub Bun correspondent Is unable
to state definitely whloh havo beon granted
and which havo boen refusod.
