THIS AND THAT
We understand that Rev. E. S.
Horton is to be a candidate for the
office of county superintendent, sub
ject to the of the votes ia the June
primaries. Although formal an
nouncement has not vet been made,
it will appear later*, Mr. Horton
was a resident of Hurley for several
years 'and his candidacy will be
looked upon with fayor by many in
this neighborhood.
There are manv theories advanced
as to what f.oes to make a good town,
but we believe that agood live town
is made by trading at home as much
as you consistently can—the mer
chants as well as the farmers speak
ing a good word for the enterprises
that go to make up the life of your
town, and taking a kindly interest
in the welfare of your fellowmen
If your competitor or business
neighbor is making money do not
get peeved about it, but roll up your
sleeves and go after your share of]
the business here. You will bring
more trade to town and everyone
will be benefitted thereby—your
self included.

Nearly 30,000 men took a chance
by filing on and securing one of 700
homesteads recently opened on the
Fort Berthold reservation. This in
dicates that people are again begin
ning to get land hungry and realize
that a title to a good piece of real
estate is a mighty good thing to
have. It will take a lot of wealth
produced from the soil and mines to
make up the vast losses of the Euro
pean war, and good prices for farm
products may be looked forward to
for many years to come. South
Dakota land will never be as cheap
again as it is today, ia the prediction
of many foreseeing business men.

S:
Evidently our little article of last
week headed "The Royal Slave
was not received by some in the
spirit in which it .was written.
Shortly after the publication of the
paper we received by mail an unciSfn
plimentary comment on the write-up
and by someone who preferred to
leave his identity a matter of specu
lation. Inasmuch as no regular
reader of the Herald is of such small
calibre, we naturally assume that
the Author is someone who ha^
formed the habit of reading his
neighbor's paper. Let us hope that
its up lifting influence will be felt
before his present mistaken ideas of
courage lead him to stab someone
jyiin the back. EHi 5 If

Agriculture Extension Agent for
Turner County
-'A movement is on in Turner Coun
ty to take advantage of the assist
ance offered by the state and Unitec
States government to employ & coun
ty agent.
There are ten such agents at wor!
in that many counties in South Dak
ota. Eight have begun-work since
May.
This agent is for the purpose of
helping in the progress of farming
in a nutshell, it isforihie purpose of
making farming more profitable and
making the farm a better place„ on
which to live. C,
The agent's duties yary as the ag
ricultural interests of the county
vary. He is the local man to call on
the State College or the U.S.Depart
ment of Agricnlturfe for help on any
special outbreak oJ disease* He will
he -the man who will, with the coop
eration of the farmers help to eradP'
cate hog cholera, black leg or an
thrax help in the exchange of sires
or breeding stodk or questions of
drainage, building, rotation of crops
and any problems that may arise on
the farm. The agent is to be a util
ity man at the service of the farmers.
He does not know it all.
The money necessary to finance
the work is appropriated by the
county, the state and the federal
government. No county is allowed
to appropriate more than $100 to a
township, so Turner caunty could
not give more than $1800 for the
work. For every dollar raised by
the county the state puts in 60 cents*
(making $720 for Turner county
when that' county appropriates
$1200.) The federal government
puts in $50 p?r month or at the? rate
of $600 per year. The state and
United States together give $1320 to
the county which raises $1200.
To support the agent in this new
work a strong association of the men
of the county is necessary. The

HURLEY, SOUTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER
state law requires that at least 50
men in one third of the townships
(or 6 men in Turner county) form
an association, pay a membership
fee of $2, elect 5 or 7 directors to
take charge of things, incorporate
under the state law and then peti
tion the county commissioners for
an appropriation. $1200 is enough
for Turner county.
The success of the work depends
largely on the cooperation of the
farmers of the county one man
alone can do but little, but with 300
men in a county out to get resulted—
nothing can stop them. Every far
mer in the-county ought to and will
be back of this as soon as he under
stands it. We want you all to help
get the right kind of an agent and
then help him make a success of the
work in this county, as it has been
made a success in over 1500 counties
in the United State?,
9, 1915
The work is well under way in
Turner county. There will be a
county-wide meeting within a week
to elect directors. As soon as corn
picking is finished" we want every
farmer in the county to come in
Whether he joins or not The date
of this meeting has been sec for
Dec. 17th. This is a farmer affair
for the farmer. Gome in and give
your views.

The Night Before Christmas
The critics and particular show
goers the country over have united
in calling "The Night Before Christ
mas" a comedy of intense human in
terest and the greatest laugh pro
ducer of the theatrical season. It is
chuck full of native American wit
with a dash of drama. It is a play
which all classes and nationalities of
peoples thoroughly and honestly en-:
joy. Nothing to offend any pne..
The play as you see it does not seem
to have been built at all, it gives,one
the impression of having just grown
naturally, like the the trees, the
flowers and the brightness of the
sunshine free and wholesome in its
strength and as lasting as the rock
of Gibralta. The comedy will be
taken care of by Mr. Wight and the
entire play will be presented
with his usual care and thorough
ness. Remember the Mon
day. December, 13th*Av$&
