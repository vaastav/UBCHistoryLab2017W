Atlanta Journal. Sunday. Doc. I.
Moise De Leon, the wealthy Atlanta j
contractor who mysteriously disap?
peared last August, turned up in a
hospital In Sydney, Australia, about
the first of 8eptember( and got back
to his home "44 Piedmont avenue,
last Thursday( is preparing to go to
a private sanitarium and have an op?
eration performed en his skuii.
"I must have heen hit on the head
and beaten up," he told a Journal re?
porter yesterday afternoon, "for when
I waked up in the hospital in Sydney,
they had my head all wrapped and
bandaged, l am in a very weak condi?
tion, both mentally and physically. I
expect to go to a private sanitarium
next Monday for an operation. 1
haven t had tin* time or tho strength
since 1 got back to look into my busi?
ness affairs. The first thing I'm after
is to get well again. Yes, it is good
to be back home."
A beautiful baby girl with a wealth
of golden curls came down stairs, bun?
dled In her coat and warm bat and
mittens for a walk with the nurse.
She ran to her father. Where he sat
in the hall, and putting her arms
around his neck, kissed him and hug?
ged him.
"Bye-bye, papa, 1 she said, as she
turned in the doorway to throw him
a kiss.
Mis sunken, burning eyes followed
her as long as she w;us in sight, and
then a film of tears rose in them, and
h said again:
"It is good to be back home."
Very little, and that very vaguely,
can Mr. DeLcon recall of what hap?
pened between his departure last Aug?
ust ami his strange gwakenlng from
a Spell of brain fever in a hospital on
the other side of the world.
lie left home last August after a
trying Illness to go fishing ami hunt?
ing a few weeks in the Michigan
woods. The last he remembers is that
he went to a baseball game in Chicago
with a friend.
"It was awfully hot in Chicago," he
Salyg, "ami the heat must have got
me, in my weakened condition. The
next thing i knew l woke up |q the
h< spital in Sydney."
The hospital authorities told hyn
that they found him in tin- Quaran?
tine hospital. Tiny said he had been
taken from the Steerage of a tramp
stenmer, along with Japs and Chinese.
When the Quarantine hospital washed
off the coal grime and found that he
was a white man instead of a "collie,"
they made arrangements to remove
him to tbe other hospital, it being a
sort of sailors' home. He was wear?
ing, when taken from the steamer, a
pair of overalls, an undershirt, and
a "cholera belt." this beim? simply a
Strip of cotton with a buckle and a
pOOket. In the pocket were found
a few greenbacks of American mon?
ey, a lew Japanese coins, and a little
Japanese dog carved out of wood.
A thirty-second degree Masonic
ring, which Mr. DeLeon wore on his
right hand when he left home. was
gone, and the finger was crushed. A
ring which. Iiis wife gave him. worn
on his h it hand without ever once
being removed since he put it on a
few d iys before tiu ir marriage, was
also gone, and that finger was llk< -
wise bruised and tut.
The back of his head was battered
his right arm was lacerated, his legs
were bruised, am! one of his toes was
broken,
The steamer on which they found
him was a " ramp" that had cleared
from Vancouver, B, C, ami called at
ports In Japan, the Philippine Islands,
tin- South Sea isla ids. ami at Syd?
ney,
From about September i until the
middle of i ?< toner, he lay delirious in
the hospital bed, and when finally he
recovered his right mind the rust
words in spoke wa re about a cable?
gram to bis w Ife,
They told him that he had tried,
three weeks before, to tell them ahoul
it, but tio y could not understand him
And Ihey told him that in his de?
lirium he had said bitter things con
< ernlng the Japanese,
There were Masons in the hospital,
and Mr DeI<eon gave them the pass
word, nnd they raised the money to
puy his pas age home lie stopped at
Honolulu several days, but came out
of Man Francisco on the tust train.
Though Mis DeLoop knew, by the
cablegram, that he was on his way
home, she did not know the tiav when
he would arrive,
"No, I didn't try to time it ? .? I'd
get lo re Thanksgiving day," he said
in r? plv it. a question l was com
Ing iuj fuiil as l could and expected
to grrlve about November j'j."
Mr. I't I .i on has ;-t. nobod) but a
ftw verj t loi Ince his i?
tutu. He ree< porters with
reluctance and was not strong enough
t<> talk with them long.
"Win n I am wi ii again, and
strong," said he, "l will write out as
much as l ( in remember what has
happened to me, Maybe I can recall
more of it. Then if you think anyl < <i\
would be Interested in r? ding th*"
statement I will give it to you for
publication.*'
That .Mr. DeLtSon had disappeared
first became known to the public in
the latter part of August, through ef?
forts of members of his family to lo?
cate him in the Michigan WOOds,
where he was going on a Ashing trip,
when he decided to stop over in Chi?
cago and visit friends for a few days,
and incidentally see a big league base?
ball game. The contractor has long
tu en known to his friends as an en?
thusiastic baseball ' fan.''
Two days after relatives appealed
to the police of many cities and em?
ployed private deteCtlVM to search
the Michigan woods and points in and
near Chicago for the missing man, a
friendly suit for a receivership for
Iiis property was brought by creditors
hi ee,
One of the reasons for bringing the
suit Wits that money had to be raised
to pay the large force of workmen,
whom Mr. la Leon had employed on
tin- million-dollar court house, which
is still in the course of construction.
j
The suit for receiver set forth that
the creditor! bringing the action be?
lieved Mr. DeLeon to be solvent, but
that it was necessary to save it from
ruin, and raise the money needed to
meet certain Obligations like the sala?
ries of employes.
Roland Hansom, an attorney, and
H. L. Fraser, employed in the !>? -
Leon office, wa re named receivers by
the superior court.
For some time the reecivern insist?
ed that they thought the estate to be
solvent, and asked the courts to ap?
point an auditor to make a careful
examination of all of his books.
In the meantime, the Maryland Fi?
delity and Casualty company, which
had bonded Mr. He Leon, took charge
of the construction of the court house,
The board of county commissioners
met, and by the necessary legal for?
malities vested in the contract in the
bonding company, under whose super?
vision the work is now going on.
When the auditor's report was filed
in the court it showed that the con?
tractor's liabilities approximated $00,
000, while his assets were less than
that amount by about $15,000.
Mr. DeLeon Was later declared a
bankrupt and named H. L. Fraser
trustee of the estate. He is still act?
ing in that capacity.
No division has been made of the
estate, and according to Mr. Fraser,
mos! of the creditor! have advised de?
lays, expressing their confidence in
Mr. DeLeon and declaring that on his
return he would straighten out his
tangled business affairs and pay his
creditors dollar for dollar.
Mr. DeLeon Will he unable to as?
sume control of his estate except
through an order of the fede ral court.
By an agreement with his creditors
he might secure an order from the
bankruptcy court, allowing him to
take* his own busln< BS again.
Failing in this, Mr. DeLeon can only
BeeUre his estate by filing a bill and
showing that he Is now insolvent

cluding; day <<f i In- session "f the
South Carolina conference of tho
Methodist Episcopal church, South
was marked by much Important busl
ne.lS, including tin reading of the ap
pointments for next year and the pre?
sentation of the report of the commit?
tee on education. The report of the
board of education, which was adopt?
ed, provides for ;. campaign to raise
1300,000 to increase the facilities of
the church's colleges In this state.

by the educational hoard, which was
adopted, provided for a campaign to
obtain $300,000 for Increasing the
