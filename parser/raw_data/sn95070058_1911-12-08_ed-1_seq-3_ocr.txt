SAVING MONEY.
A Dollar a Week Put Into the Bank Is
a Good Investment.
"It Is mighty hard , " said an unfortu
nate worklngman some time ago to the ,
writer , "to save up a thousand dollars
by laying aside a dollar or two a week
and then to take It out of the savings
bank and lose It to a get rich quick
swindler , as 1 have just done. " The
poor fellow could work and save , but
lie had not had even a kindergarten
education In finance , else his story
would have been different. He had
never given a thought to interest and
KO was absolutely Ignorant of growth
through compound Interest and , of
course , had never heard of that won
derful process of accumulation known
as "progressive compound interest. "
One dollar deposited in a savings
bank that pays 4 per cent will amount
to $2.19 In twenty years. This is sim
ple compound Interest. Now , if you
deposit $1 every year for twenty years ,
or $20 In all , the sum to your credit
will have grown to $30.07.
Any wage earner can put by $1 a
week. That money deposited In a pav
ings bank for twenty years will have
Increased to $1,012. A deposit of $5 a
week will have grown to $8,000 , and
this at 4 per cent will bo $320 a year.
There is no secret , no mystery , about
this. It is as clear as the cloudless

FOUND SHE WAS A
COUNTERFEITERS WIDOW.
Woman on Deathbed Threw Light on a
Mystery of the Early Seventies.
Carrying since his death In 1882 a
secret that touched on the life of her
husband , Mrs. Mary Clancy , who has
just died at the home of her nephew ,
George Ilasklns , at llolton , Mich. , on
her deathbed divulged a story that
back In the seventies puzzled the gov
ernment secret service otllclals.
According to her Htory , she was mar
ried In 18158 In London to Robert Dale
Clancy , a young engraver. Two years
after their marriage they went to New
York city , where Cluncy found em
ployment In a large engraving estab
lishment. He titled up rooms In thu
basement of their home and .spent
much of his spare time there. He
told his wife he was making experi
ments that would result In great
wealth for them both , and she never
was allowed to enter the basement ex
cept with her husband. He had fre
quent visitors-men who came late
and departed before daylight the next
morning.
One night he came home very much
excited and Informed Ills wife that
they were to move that night. lie
was Joined by three men , who assist
ed In the packing of their household
goods , and before day dawned large
vans came and took away the goods.
Clancy and his wife toi l the train
for Philadelphia. Her husband never
left the new home till after dark and
seldom left nt all. Some men visitors
came to see him , and they spent their
time In rooms Clancy had tlttcd up In
the rear of their residence. He al
ways seemed to have plenty of money
and never stinted her In any way.
In 18S2 Clancy was taken 111 with
pneumonia and , realizing that he was
going to die , gave his wife instructions
about the workshop. Ho told her
where to llnd a large sum of good
money , and never to her knowledge
did she handle any money that was
not genuine. He told her always to
keep the little chest in the workshop
and never allow any one to know
what was In it.
After his death , April i > . Mrs. Clancy
was visited by a number of well dress
ed men who offered various pretexts
and threats In order to obtain posses
slon of the chest. She refused to give
it up , and it has been with her all
these years.
When opened after her death It was
found to contain four plates from
which to print money , many choice
engraver's tools and paper like that
on which money Is printed.
One set of plates was for $10 sliver
certificates and the other sot for fives.
Mr. Ilasklns took the contents of
the chest to Washington , where he
turned them over to the government
authorities with a full explanation.
Ancient Stone Workers.
Egyptian stone workers -1,000 years'
ago had a surprising knowledge of
what are considered modern tools.
Those pyramid builders operated with
solid and tubular drills and straight
and circular saws. In handling the
tubular drills , which were of superior
quality , the skill of the artisan was
so remarkable that the cutting marks
In granite show no indication of wear
of the tool , while a cut of a tenth of
an inch was made in the hardest rock
at each revolution. A hole through
Loth hard and soft material was bored
perfectly smooth and uniform.
Her Account.
"I should like to open an account nt
this bank , if yon please. "

you , madam. What amount do you
wish to deposit ? "

THRIVED ON MISFORTUNE.
A German Peddler Who Insulted the
Kaiser and Got Rich.
A Gorman hawker , Hans Bauer-
mcistcr , retired from business , having
amassed a little fortune. According tea
a Paris contemporary , misfortune was
the foundation of his success. The
hawker's specialty was the sale of portraits
traits of the Imperial family.
Ills mode of haranguing his audience
was something like this : "Buy a portrait
trait of William I. , whose motto was ,
'I have no time to be wearied. ' "
"Who'll buy this Frederick II. , whose
prayer was , 'Teach me to suffer with
out complaining ? ' " "Do not fall to
complete your collection and buy this
portrait of our great emperor , William
II. , whoso r.ivorlte phrase Is , 'Augusta ,
you pack your trunks. " "
This hist always brought down thu
audience , and In time the police , In
another sense. Bauormelster was sen
tenced to sixty days for lese majesty.
He did his time and on release re
started bis business. He sold his portraits
traits with the old formula until he
came to that of the kaiser , and then
he said , "I have learned to my cost
that It Is not lawful to repeat what
he says so often. " The people were
Just as well pleased , and the portraits
sold splendidly.

THACKERAY AS A TALKER.
A Grand Oratorical Display That Did
Not Take Place ,
Thackeray was terribly self con-
ncloii.i and usually presented n very
poor appearance when ho attempted to
deliver n speech. "Why can't they get
Dickens to take the chair ? " he grum
bled when he had to preside at the
general theatrical fund. "Ho can make
a speech , and n good one. I'm of no
use. They little think how nervous 1
am , and Dickens doesn't know the
meaning of the word. "
An amusing story Is recorded of the
occasion when , with Mr. Fields , the
well known American publisher ,
Thackeray traveled to Manchester to
make a speech at the founding of the
Free Library Institution In that town.
The would be orator declared that , al
though Dickens and Bulwer Lyttoti
and Sir James Stephen were to pre
cede him , ho Intended to beat euch of
them on this occasion. He Insisted
that Mr. Fields .should bo seated di
rectly In front of htm so that ho should
not miss n single word.
Later , as ho rose , he looked at his
friend as much OH to Hay , "I'll show
you what speaking Is. " lie began flu
ently , was excellent for two minutes
and then In the midst of n most car-
nest sentence stopped suddenly , gave
n look of comic despair and sat down.

was over "my boy , you have acci
dentally missed hearing one of the
finest speeches ever prepared by n
great British orator. " "Some Aspects

What He Wanted to See.
It cannot bo denied that the saddest
thing In the world Is a man trying to
buy In a department store a garment
for a woman. Discouraged before ho
begins , a walk through acres of gar
ments which are none of his business
depresses him still further. Saleswo
men are pitifully tolerant , even kind ,
but his sense of Inferiority grows.
Ono unfortunate who tried to buy a
sweater for a wife who was out of
town did at last rebel Ills first nils
take was In language. "Thirty-six
chest , " ho said. "Thirty-six bust , "
corrected the young woman. At last
In a helpless tangle he bought meekly
what ho was told to buy. Then she
asked. "Is there anything more I can

A New Way to Religion.
A clergyman recently said. ' 'If 1
were to start a new religion , do you
know what I would do ? "
"You'd go out and preach , wouldn't
you ? " I asked
"I'd do something else first , " ho re
plied. "I would go to the popular
song writers , writers of words and
writers of music , and 1 would get
them to write songs expressing the
spirit of the new religion. If we can
only make people feel religion , If we
can make them realize that It Is al
ready there In their hearts , malic them
love It , we can move the. world. " San

EARL LYTTON'S BAD TASTE.
A Dinner Speech That Called Forth
Howls of Derision.
1 once sat at a banquet given In
London by Wilson Barrett to Lawrence
renco Barrett , says a writer In an
English magazine. Earl Lytton presided
sided , n curled , oiled , effeminate , su
percilious fop. He had a Roman
tragedy to ? ell to Wilson Barrett. That
was why be came.
He eulogized Wilson Barrett In a
speech. "I believe. " he said , "that
Mr. Barrett won some success with a
piece called ( consulting his notes ) 'The
Lights of Ixindon. ' I suppose it was
the work of some dramatic hack. ' '
George Sims sat facing him and never
said a word.
Then his lordship went drawling on :
" 1 next find on the list of Mr. Bar
rett's successes something called 'The
Silver King. ' Here again 1 know
nothing of the authorship. The names
of those dramatic carpenters do not
Interest me. " At which Henry Arthur
Jones glared and a flush came Into
the face of poqr blind Henry Herman.
"Finally , " said Lord Lytton , "Mr.
Wilson Barrett has placed on his
boards what lie humorously calls a
Roman tragedy. I refer to 'Claudlan. '
attributed to one W. G. Wills , of whom
I have never nnard" This was too
much for the banqueters. All of them
were personally acquainted with Irv-
Ing's pet poet , the modest Wills. So
they howled derisively.
And Earl Lytton's tragedy , produced
n month later , was a dismal failure.

thought Detective William J. Burns
was entitled to all of them , Including :
those offered by labor organizations
and subsequently withdrawn when the
McNamaras weie arrested , if Burns
cares to sue for them.

rest , and Burns was then employed
by Mayor Alexander. There are other
large rewards , however , not affected
by that ordinance , which he will prob
ably get.
