DOS ANGELES. Cel., Dec. 5.-Judgo
'Wuiter Bordwell Issued a formal state
ment lute today, giving his views as to
the McNamara trial and especially as
to what brought tibout Its termination.
That statement follows:
"In a spirit of Indifference to every
thing In the McNamara cases, save the
facta and the law applicable thereto, I
deem It due to the court and to this
community that I should make a brief
publlo statement regarding the circum
stances attending the abrupt close of
these cases, together with sufficient ooin
ment to indicate my views as to such
circumstances. This Is done In the hope
of correcting, if possible, some miscon
ceptions due to erroneous publications and
particularly to tin article which appeared
in a local newspaper on the 22d Instant,
over the signature of Lincoln Stcffens.
"In the first place, the claim or. sug
gestion that the termination of the cases
was due to the efforts of himself and
other outsiders -who undertook to Influ
ence the officers of the court other than
the judge-is without Justification in
fact
Claims tntrne.
"I also wish to denounce the claims of
that gentleman and of other persons for
him that the change of pleas In this
case from 'not guilty' to 'guilty was due
to his effort, as groundless and untrue,
lie la correct in the Btatement that the
court was not a party to uny negotiations
for what he termed 'a compromise' of
these cases; but there is no ground for
any claim that he induced the prosecu
tion to come to an agreement In the
matter. The district attorney acted en.
tlrely without regard to Mr. Steffens and
on lines decided upon before the latter
Vfvearea. on the scene.
"As to the defense. h
on it that the developments of last week
s to the bribery and attempted bribery
of jurors l the James B. McNamara
case were the efficient causes, of the
cnaaga, 0f pla which suddenly brought
, thesa caaes to an -end. The- district -attorney
could have had James B. Mc-
u,M.s pla or guilty long ago if he
had been willing to dismiss the case
against his brother, but he refused, In
sisting that the latter was guilty and
ahould suffer punishment.
"The first propositions from those In
terested in the defense were that James
B. McNamara should change his plea
f.om 'not guilty' to 'guilty on condition
that he should not be sentenced to death
and that hla brother should go free. The
district attorney would not agree.
"Afterwards emissaries from the de
fense brought to the district attorney the
Preposition that James B. McNamara
would plead guilty and be sentenced to
death If the court so ordered, providing
that lils brother should be saved. But
the district attorney still would not agree.
Bribery Revelations taaar.
"Those Interested In the defense contin
ued to urge his acceptance of the last
proposition for ten days or more, and
until the bribery developments revealed
the desperation of the defense and para
lysed the effort to ave John J. McNa
mara by sacrificing his brother. Then
it was that the change of the pleas of
these men was forthcoming.
"The notion broached In' the Steffens
article that the McNamara in the com
mission of the crimes as confessed by
them, are 'two heroes' is offensive-to
common Intelligence and repellant to the
conscience of all just men-to say nothing
of the abhorrence of the law for uch
sentiment; and I am confident that the

lost their lives In the Times disaster. No
one was killed In the Llewellyn Iron
works affair. Imprisonment will be in

District Attorney John D. Fredericks

At that time Investigator Brown was

by seventeen policemen In uniform.
Sentence was pronounced. In a court
room full of cheery-faced spectators,
whose chatters filled the room until the
prisoners entered and trailed them across
the Hrldge of Sighs when they left. The
two brothers, side by side, received what
the law and the court determined to be
the Just return for what they confessed
to have done. The extreme penalty for
James B. McNamara was death; thai
for his brother life Imprisonment, and
District Attorney Fredericks urged that
clemency be shown each man because of
his plea of guilty and on account of
"other services rendered the state."
Deserves Maximum Penalty.
James B. McNamara's plea that he In
tended to kill no one wns scouted by
Judge Bordwell.
"You well deserve the maximum pen
alty," said the court. "That that Judg
ment does not extend Is not due to any
extenuating circumstances, but It Is the
wisdom of the court to do otherwise."
This he practically reiterated to John
J. McNamara,
The sentences Imposed upon them, while
seemingly widely divergent, are In effect
likely to be Identical,.
John J. McNamara is. 4o years old. . j-tia
sentence with allowance for good be
havior will take him well on the road to
the sixties. That he will have any con
siderable span of life after his prison
years is not believed, but District At
torney John D. Fredericks, who pleaded
that as. a matter of state policy, the de
fendants should not be forced to end their
life In prison.
Twenty-four minutes was the time oc
cupied by the court proceedings. At the
end of thai time, without speaking to
anyone, tho McNamaias were led hank
across the Bridge of Sighs.
'There is-nothing to gloat over In this."
said Fredericks afterward. "1 shall have
nothing to say beyond what I have ul
ready said In court."
Attorney Darrow and his assistants re

KUHN-LOEB BLCOMES FACTOR
Introduction of firm Injto reorgan

Street, to Have 'Special "
Significance,
NEW YORK, Dec. r.-"F!nanclal re
adjustment and reorganization" of the
Wabash railroad waa determined on at
a meeting of the directors today. The
announcement caused something of a sur
prise, It having been generally believed
that the reorganisation plan of the
Wheeling & Lake Kile-Wabaih term
inal roads would be accepted, thereby
materially reducing the Wabush'a finan
cial burden.'
Wlnslow 8. Pierce, onoe a prominent
figure In all Gould projects, returned to
his early affiliations as chairman of the
Wabash board and reorganization com
mlttee, succeeding IS. T. Jeffery, who
continues as a director. Other new ntcn
in the board are Kdwln Hawley, who
comes In not because of any Interest In
Wabash, but as a practical railroad man;
Kobert Goelet and Alvln W. Krech, presi
dent of the Equitable. Trust ' company,
which is trustee for the first and re
funding and extending mortgage of the
Wabash road.
Kihn-l.oi'li IManaaera.
One of the unexpected incidents of the
proposed reorganization is the naming of
Kuhn, Loeb & Co. as syndicate man
agers. The firm owns the greater part
If not all of the S,000,000 notes for which
the Wabash is guarantor, but Its Intro
duction into the reorganized, company is
believed in muny Wall sireet quarters to
have some deeper significance. Relations
between Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and the
Goulds have not been especially friendly
since the unexpected withdrawal of the
bankers from Missouri Pacific financing
carry In the year.
Although one of the leadlug interests
In thu Wabush reorganization is au
thority for the stutement that the re
adjustment will not Involve receivership,
that point Is yet to be settled. It will
not lie, decided until thoso who (ire to
assumo control of tho property have
