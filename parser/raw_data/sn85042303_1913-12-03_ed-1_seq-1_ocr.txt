OWEN
ADMITTED HIS SUCCESSFUL CUR
RENCY REFORM LEGISLATION
IS PAVING WAY.
Oklahoma City, Iiec. 2. Success
ful currency reform legislation along
the. lines now being followed in con
gress will pave tin? way for I'niti d
States Senator Robert L. Owen's
candidacy for the presidency, ht
haps in lt'ltl, if not then, in lX'u.
A very close friend of Senator Ow
en, associated with him in his suc
cessful campaign for renoniination
and re-election last year, was author
ity tor the statement Monday that
Senator Owen would not ask another
term in the snate, when his pres
ent term expired in 1919. Senator
Owen's aspirations were higher, this
man said, and he indicated that his
.statements were founded ou fact, not
fancy.
Senator Owen is chairman of ;he
senate committee, o(n banking and
currency, awl as such, has super
vised the framing of the bill now
'about to be reported to the senate, af
ter passago by the house. Ileal cur
rency reform accomplished under the
provisions of this bill woull be in
Itself a platform sufficient to justify
the Owen candidacy.
Senator Owen has been senator
from Oklahoma since statehood, lj
won the long term by lot, at :-tate-hood,
and ran first for re-e'ert;on,
last year. He defeated former Gov
ernor C. N. Haskell for the nomina
tion in 1912, overwhelmingly, ami I'd
the democratic ticket by thousands
of votes in the general election.
The revival services that have heel',
in progress . at the First Christian
church will close tonight. A rally
of all the members and friends of
the church is desired. Many live so
tar away that with the conditions
of tile crossings, streets and roads
it is n?xt to impossible for the
great number who have read through
the columns of the Ardmoreite of
the meetings, to attend. However,
tonight it is expi cted that many will
brave 'he elements to hear this last
message. The services, though last
ing only ten days, have been unusu
ally instructive and inspirational.
It is a matter of general regre t ex
pressi d freely by our citizens who
have heard Lev. Mr. Spicer. tint
conditions were not favorable for a
gnat hearing, which the messages
justly d' served.
The church and Rev. M. S. John
son as minister, are to be congratu
lated on the success of their neiV
home opening service. An unusual
period of prosperity is predicted for
these gool people. Rev. Spicer will
return to Law ton tomorrow, via
Oklahoma City. He is warm in his
praise and appreciation or Ardmore.

United States Authorities Will Arrest
Federal Troops if They Cross Into
United States, and Carry Them to
San Antonio.
Juarez, Jec. (ieneral Panelio
Villa toilay sent troops to Intercept
the seven federal generals who evac
uated Chihuahua City and who are
said to be on tin ir way with two
thousand men to cross the I'uited
States at Presidio, Texas.
It is not. believed that Villa's men
can head off the federals, and they
will lie arrested by the United States
authorities and taken to San Antonio
if they cross the border.
