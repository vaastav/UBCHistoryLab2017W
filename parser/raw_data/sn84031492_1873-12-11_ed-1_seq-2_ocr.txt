Standing of tlio Springfield Republican
—lmportant Points Involved
in tho Controversy.
Correspondence of The Chicago Tribune.
Spring field. Mass., Deo. 7,1873.
./Tho Uttlo City of Springfield, Mass., which
could easily bo tucked away in some corner of
Chicago without seriously disturbing tho real
estate market, is Just now enjoying a
SENSATION OF NATIONAL INTEREST
and importance,—nothing loss than a libel-suit
against tho J?epu6ifc<in, of which Samuol Bowles
is tho.editor. Tho caso is simply this:
During tho rocont canvass for tho election of
dty officers in Springfield, the. iJspu&ftcan ac
cused Mr. Willis Phelps, a well-known railroad
contractor, of endeavoring to procure such nom
inations as would eocuro tho appropriation by
tho city of $225,000 for a railroad to Longmead
ow, a town 4or 5 miles from ..Springflold; and
stated that this sum: was $125,000 more than
Phelps had declared himsOlf willing to build tbo
road for. Tho
most serious charge,
however, relates to Mr. Phelps* connection with
tho Springfield, Athol «h Northeastern Hoad, for
which ho got from the city an appropriation of
$300,000,—5200,000 of which, the Republican
declares, ho put Into his own pocket. “Public
robber” and “public corrupter" are tho epi
thets that Mr. Bowles’ paper applies to tho ag
grieved gentleman. Ho is charged with being
THE DOSS TWEED
of Springfield; with lobbying; with openly buy
ing voles; and with being a party to both sides
Of tho public bargains in which ho has engaged.
Tho Republican's immediate object In publish
ing these bold accusations was evidently to in
fluence tho voters of Springfield in their choice
of city officers on tbo first Monday of this
month, and it was partially successful;
but nobody acquainted with tbo paper, or with
tho character of Mr. Bowles, believes that they
wore dictated by malice, or wore totally un
founded. Mr. Phelps brings his suit in tbo
Supremo Court, and tho trial will come off in
this city, not before next April, possibly not till
April, 1876. Mr. Phelps asks for
$200,000 DAMAGES.
Tho office of the Republican was under an
attachment, and with a keeper in charge, (or
two or three days, last week: but the defend
ant was afterward put under bonds of sdoo,ooo,
and the attachment was taken off. The signora
of tbo bond are among the most prominent cit
izens of Springfield,—Chester W. Chapin. Pres
ident of tho Boston & Albany Road, and Daniel
L. Harris, President of tho Connecticut
River Rood, being on tho list. Both
aides employ well-known local lawyers,
while Judge Thomas, of Boston, is expected to
be senior counsel for tho nrosccutlon. The host
bit of gossip about the counsel, however, is, that
Phelps is going to retain
BEN BUTLER.
Now, you know that Ben Butler feels toward
Samuel Bowles very much os the Devil feels
toward holy water; and, if ho is going to have a
hand In tbo case, ho will make things interesting.
Tho tone of tho Republican since tbo suit was
brought has beon bold, but not impudent. It
baa republished the offensive articles; has called
for a speedy trial: has promised that tho matter
shall be thoroughly sifted. Phelps seems equally
anxious for tho tilt, - and expresses a determina
tion to
“SQUELCH THE REPUBLICAN."
Bowles is said to treat the matter in a mirthful
way, ami is currently reported to havo rubbed
bis with glee when ho first hoard of tho
suit. -
Public fooling is, of course, divided. Tho
Republican charges that the special dispatches
about tbo affair havo received a Phelps coloring.
The rank and file of tho Springfield populace are
siill scratching their heads over tho matter, and
perhaps have hardly made up their minds yet,
but the great majority of those I have h aid
from think that Sam Bowles would hardly make
such charges without
PRETTY SOLID GROUND
under bis feet. Thoro ate a groat many people
in town, nevertheless, whose corns havo been
uncomfortably trodden on by Buwlcs’ paper, and
some of them would doubtless Inly exult to see
him in a box. Samuel Bowles is a very inde
pendent man, and’would not hesitate to dc
ounuco in his paper any base public act that bis
dearest personal friend might bo guilty of;
bouco many may havo spots about them which
bo baa made sore iu years past, that would bo
comfortably poulticed by any trouble that might
oo brought upon him.
Bub tho Springfield Republican is
A GREAT INSTITUTION
in this town of 20,703 inhabitants, and the peo
ple of all parties, while many of them hate it,
are very proud of what they cull tho boldest and
best paper iu Now England. About 11,000 per
sons—tliut is, nearly every family in Springfield,
and a goodly number in the surrounding coun
try—subscribe for its ‘ daily edition, road it
thoroughly, admire its brilliancy, and then—part
of them—roundly damn its independence. But
this Utile town cannot afford to have a $200,000
hole made in the Jicnublican'9 strong box. Take
away the Springfield Republican from this city,
and all the city’s interests
WOULD SUFFER BADLY.
The increase of population would bo chocked,
real estate would fool tho shock, and tho town
itself would havo to rely for its repute abroad
upon its United States Armory, for it has
no other public Institution worth mentioning,
Mr. Bowles makes the Republican what it is,
and Air. Bowleses don't grow on every bush.
The family Is an old one, and has been identified
with tho interests of the town for many years,
and the Springfield public will, 1 think, wait a
good while boioro it consents to havo a paper of
which It is so proud “ squelched,” just for the
luxury of paying too high prices for Us rail
roads.
This libel-suit is regarded as
A VERY IMPORTANT ONE,
as promising to settle one or two points in jour
nalism that have uac yet boon satisfactorily bot
tled by the Courts. independent journals very
much desire to know whether tbo Jaws will sus
tain thorn in turning mon inside out whon they
aro candidates for office or aro putting for
ward othora for profermout; also, whether it
is right to call a liar, a thief a thief, and
a spado a spado. It is a question,
too, whether a journal cau properly put
certain facta together, and draw from them the
inference that a man is a rascal. A recent llbol
yuit at Philadelphia elicited from a Judge the
charge that it is only necessary for the defend
ant to remove the presumption of malice; that
It is of no consequence whether the alleged li
belous statements against the plaintiff are true
or not, if the defendant believed them to be
true at tbo time of publication. This is pretty
liberal ground,—poihapa too liberal. Messrs.
Phelps and Bowles seek
A OLEAULY-DEFINED LAW
of some sort on tbo subject, if haply they may
fool after it and find It. There is a very general
impression that, if the question is to be tested
at all, Mr. Bowles is a good man to represent the
eide of independent journalism.
The groat conundrum now is, of coarse, How
will the suit come out ? The combatants have
got everything ready, and settled back on tboir
haunches, to remain la that posture until April;
nnd the interested public will have to hold its
bioath till that, month.
THE ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH
in tbo two camps aro about as follows: On tbo
one side, a man lighting for Ids honor; his busi
ness, and the privilege of plugging up bis neigh
bor's mouth j on the other, an old newspaper
war-dog, with tooth that have had a good deal of
practice in biting,—in fact, have boon biting for
thirty years, but are all the sharper for tboir
uto. On the one side, railroads, money, political
friends ; on the other, on unwavering and ab
sorbing faith in a certain principle, and a deter
mination to put that principle to the tost, an
Influential newspaper, a reputation to protect,
and a bold position in journalism to defend.
For my own part,—without expressing my
opinion on this particular caao,-v-lf X wore croine
ipto tbo llbol-imt business,
, I SHOULDN'T SELECT SAMUEL COWLES
mmy first victim. 1 would rathor tako an easl
or subject to begin with. It would bo too much
like going on a balloon trip across tbo Atlantic
bofoio you havo made any llltlo oxourstona over
land. ctr. Bowles has brains, which will doubt
ions prove a convenience to him in this unpleas
antness. At all events, both ho and Ids oppo
nent promise that tboy will do all In their power
to mnlco tbo suit a lively ouc, for which tbo pub
lic, who stand by and boo tho fun, will bo duly
grateful. Kenton.
LOUISIANA.
It in now made manifest that tho Congress of
tho United States will entertain jurisdiction in
tho Louisiana caoo, and determine, during Its
present session, tho question of legitimacy be
tween the two Governments in this State.
Owing to the Intervention of the Federal pow
er, the Government claiming to bo the
legal aud legitimate Government of
Louisiana, and of which Z have tho
honor to bo tho head, has boon prevented from
assuming and exercising tho practical functions
of government: nevertheless we have kept up
the form of our Government, and its whole
machinery is ready to bo put in motion tho mo
ment it receives the recognition of tho Congress
of tho United States.
1 have remained at my post at the Capital of
tho State, slnco my election and inauguration.
Tho Attorney-General, tho Auditor, tho Secre
tary of Stato and tho Superintendent of Educa
tion. havo done tho saroo; and tho Treasurer of
tho Stato, I presume, is ready and willing to
follow that Government which tho Congress
shall recognize.
You. as tho Legislative Department of tho
Government, remained true to your posts during
sixty days last winter, aud, as the timo is now
fast approaching when tho Constitution requires
tho commencement of your annual session, I
have doomed it proper to address you oomo
words of adviop aud counsel.
Unless the Congress of tho United States de
termines tho caso in our favor prior to the first
Monday of January, it would bo useless for you
to assemble, because such is the existing state
of affairs In Louisiana, no practical benefits
could flow from any legislation you might enact.
It seems, then, to bo the part of wisdom and
patriotism that you should hold yourselves in
readiness to respond to my proclamation for
your assembling, in tho event that our Govern
ment is not recognized by Congress until after
tho first Monday of January next.
Congress will not pass lightly over the grave
matters involved in tho case of Louisiana, for
sho stands at the bar of that body as one of tho
co-equal States of tho Union, pleading that the
groat wrong done her by Federal usurpations,
ought and should be redressed by the political
department of the National Government.

THAT BEECHER INVESTIGATION.
To the Editor of The Chkago Tribune ,
Sin: You seem to have found a weak point in
my armor, and strike homo, straight and strong;
bat, as my father and mother were Irish, it might
bo well for mo to claim tho national right to
speak twice before expecting to bo understood.
I surely would not ask for groat preachers an
immunity in crime; and, in supposing tbo possi
bility of Mr. Beoohor’s guilt, .while positively
opposing an investigation, I seem to overstate
my argument. Great usefulness, like that of
Mr. Boocbor, has an inherent right to unusual
caro in tho bringing of accusations calculated
to damage or destroy it. It is a principle
admitted in jurisprudence, that tho mag
nitude of the interests involved should
be taken into consideration in every caso; and
whore the faith and hope of millions are moro or
loss at stake, thoro should bo greater care than
whore but one or two are interested. It would
bo unjust and impolitic to attaok tho reputation
of the humblest minister of tho Church on suoh
grounds as a story in an obscure newspaper;
bow much moro unjust to placo tho great ser
vices of Mr. Beecher In tho scale against such
authority. My supposition of his guilt was to
relievo tbo conscience of any who may entertain
a belief in it, and feel bound thereby to got up a
great scandal-hunt in tho church.
I simply place his gifts over against tho sus
picions, ana note the fact that morality is not
suffering by any act of hie, and requires no de
fense against tho unknown, Ido maintain that
neither Church nor Stato authorities are called
upon to aniff, and scent, and hunt after private
sins; that, before proceeding to judgo and
punish, thoy should wait until an accusation
lias been made on respectable autborily, and in
regular form. No such accusation lies against
Mr. Beecher or Mr. Bowen; an investigation,
under present circumstances, could bo noth
ing but a Paul-Pry search into private family
aflairs.
i never but once saw Mr. Beecher, and this
was in Mr. Tilton’s house, whore ho waa ns an
intimate personal friend and sympathizing
pastor, after (he date fixed m this horrible tale as
that of the break between the two families ; and
my inmost soul shrinks from any movement
toward bringing the relations of these families
before the public in such a light. That
there has since been some trouble between
them and Mr. Bo.won; that, as
you suggest, something has boon kept
back during all this Plymouth Church squabble
—must bo evident to all; but who has any right
to insist upon knowing what it is which is thus
withheld from tho public? Are there throe men,
or throe families, in tho laud so humble that
they have not a right to settle their personal
or family difficulties among themselves? It is
in urging this right of privacy that I dwell on
tho point which troubles so many people, viz.:
Mr. Beecher’s relation to tho Church ; and
claim that whatever it is that underlies the
Beecher, Bowen, and Tilton covenant, it is noth
ing that interferes with Mr. Beecher’s useful
ness, or which ought to interrupt his work.
No one is under any more obligatioa to ferret
out Air. Beecher's sins ’ before listening to or
reading his sermons than to understand the ex
act nature of Paul's “thorn la tho flesh” before
reading Ills Epistles.
Wore David’s songs less pure and sweet
For bis tempted heart ami wandering feet?
Were tho stones In the Temple less fair uml good
That Solomon bowed to gods of wood?— Whittier,
Whitfield was a groat preacher, and did the
world good service, although ho was tho apolo
gist and ally of slaveholders and slave-traders ;
George Washington was a humane man. al
though he did drag a poor, escaped slave
woidan hack into bondage ; “ Child© Harold ”
Is a noble poem, although written by a rake;
and Thomas Paine was a statesman, philosopher,
and patriot, although ho was an infidel. The
world would ho poverty-stricken to-day if do
ptlvcd of the labors of all tho men who would
havo failed to pass unscathed through a Church
investigation. So. oven admitting the possibil
ity of Mr. Beechers so failing, I Insist that, with
out fear of injury to the cause of morality, ho
may bo permitted to work awayuutilsomo regu
lar accusatlou is brought against him. Any man’s
general reputation for decency should bo answer
enough to such a charge as that which lies
against him; ami I repeat that, when tho Con
gregational Church tabes Mrs. Woodhull for a
loader, I must decline tho honor of being ono of
tho led, it is not possible that Mr. Beecher
could so fall without coming very soon to a bitter
repentance; and I would ioavo uod and him to
settle it. Especially as no concealed guilt can
bo so detrimental to public morals as is our mode
of trying criminals before a jury of a hundred
million people, a largo part of whom take les
sons of tho culprit and make a hero of him.

Mr. W. T. Nelson, Ylco-Prcnldont for tho
FIRST DISTRICT,
road a lengthy report in regard to tho progress
In his district. Ho dwelt largely on tho offeot of
tho winter-drought on tho vitality of troos, claim
ing that to this cause was duo much of tho disas
ter tho post winter. Opo person had reported
that shelter on tho east sido of tho orchard was
injurious, but advocated shelter on the north
aud west sides. Tho loss of troos has been quito
largo tho past winter, aud tho crop of fruit very
small. Many contradictory incidents occur in
regard to hardiness, and no rule will explain
those erratic eases. Some of tho most hardy
sorts have boon seriously injured, and tboso
sheltered almost as badly as those exposed.

Report adopted.
Tho Hon. A. O. Cunningham introduced
DR. GREGORY,
who addressed a wolcom eto the members of tho
Society, and spoke at length in regard to tho
value of Horticulture In all parts of tho State.
THE PRESIDENT
spoke as follows:
Seventeen years ago this month, a few—not a
dozen—persons mot by appointment, at Decatur,
to organize the Illinois State Horticultural So
ciety. Tho wisdom that dictated that movement
has long since been apparent. Then there wore
but a few small commercial orchards, and mar
ket-gardening was In Us infancy. Wo wore
entering on our first experiments, and
settlement had just begun to
show its effect on our climate';
while our Insect-foes, that we now have to bat
tle, had not begun a serious warfare on orchard
and garden.
Those,seventeen Years have been fruitful of
progress; and to-day tho orchards, tho vine
yards, and the market-gardens of tho State oc
cupy many thousand acres ; and many square
miles of river-bluff, of rolling prairie, and wood
land hillside, are made resplendent with horti
cultural riches.
As the years have come and gone, somo of
that band of workers and organizers—men who
put their hands to tho early work—have laid
down to their final rest. But now workers have
come into tho field, and the good work will go
on long after all of us shall have gone to our
lost homo. It is well that tho good work shall
continue, for Horticulture is tho handmaid of
Agriculture, and refines and adds to the enjoy
ments of life.
lu all periods man has had to labor. Even
Adam, when placed in tbo midst of Eden, was
commanded to dresa and to keep it. But. under
the now arrangement that soon followed, there
wore new duties imposed, and now enemies to
encounter : all of which wo now most fully com
prehend. The summer’s heat and tho winter’s
cold must ho modified by culture, by shelter, and
by tho shears and the pruning knife.
At first this Society gave its efforts to tho
orchard and the garden ; but soon there came a
demand for forests, and forestry and hedge
growing wore added to tho list of our ackivo
duties. Then tho railroads havo made a now
demand on us, for tho ties that form the road
bed, the timber for culverts, for cars, and for
fence-posts.
How best to provide for all of these now and
old demands is tho object of those annual gath
erings, that call you from your homos iu order
that you may plan tho work for its bettor prog
ress. Much has beon accomplished, but moro
has to bo done. Tbo varied changes of tho sea
sons, tho unequal alternations of wet and dry,
the uncertain attacks of tho insect-tribes, the
forays of birds, and tho irregular growth of
plants, havo all to bo taken mto tho account,
and, as far as possible, to bo mitigated and
amended. Thus Horticulture has become an
important pare of rural labor, and one that re
quires speciol training and special management
in order to be most successful, and yet its sub
division may bo added to ordinary farming os
tbo orchard is nark of the farm, though
the farm-orchard is not expected to fur
nish a large surplus for tho demands
of tho market. Then tho small fruits
may become a part of the business of tbo mar
ket or suburban gardens, or oven of tho farms ;
while flowers, from tho modest forget-me-not to
the giaut denizens of tho forest, should form a
part of every rural homo.
To you is confided this important trust, and
upon its faithful fulfillment will depend much of
the wealth, tho pleasure, and tbo enjoyment of
tho homos of tho people.of the Stato.
DISCUSSION OK TUB DEPORT OF MR. NELSON.
Mr. Winkler took exception to that part of the
report hi regard to tho injury of shelter on tho
oast. Ho was for sheltering not only our
orchard but our field. Wo must plant ticos for
shelter and for other purposes. He was glad to
see the progress already made, lie know of
cottonwood trees grown on tho prairie that have
been out in boards at the saw-mill.
Mr. Humphry slated that this year orchards
on high laud, without shelter, bad stood tho
winter equally well with those sheltered by
timber-bolts. He did not think that this isolated
case should bo rolled upon.
Mr. Snedcckor said the drought for the past
three years bad had a serious effect, audit should
not bo taken as a rale. He had little faith in
shelter-bolts. One orchard, in deep black soil
that kept moist, boro a fine crop. This had no
shelter : had boon pastured. Another orchard,
on tho bluff, had also done well without any
shelter, Mr. 8. is from Jersey County, near tho
Mississippi Bivcr.
Mr. Gafuslia would call tho attention of mem
bers to tho discussion in this subject in tho lie
port of 1872. Ho thought that shelter was of
value, if tho shelter was not too close on all sides.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
The first thing in order was the annual address
of tlfo President, who spoke as follows ;
president's annual address.
After tbo experience of another season, wo
have mot to take council together.
THE DROUGHT,
The unusual diought of the post three years
has given us some now conditions to be consid
ered, and. if possible, to bo corrected. Formerly
wo bad been taxed with a surplus of rainfall,
that called for drainage, and now wo have the
very reverse. The web feet that occasioned so
much of our attention have become dry foot;
and that excess of dryness, like tbo excess of
wet, has led to doathm the orchard, the vine
yard, and on the lawn,
ORANGE OF SEASON,
Wcwnnst not speculate on the cause of those
changes in the progress of the season, but may
look to tbo effect, and inquire for a remedy.
Fortunately, the plan for tbo oure of tbe one Is
also a dure for the other. Deep tillage and a
friable condition of the soil is essential to both
conditions. In one case tbe rainfall may pasa
off through tbe soil, and in tbo other it may
arise by canllliary attraction.
The dead trees aro now past remedy, but the
lesson should bo of value hereafter in the case
of trees, and vines, and shrubs.
THE OVEII-nEAUIKO.
The abundant crop of 1872 also weakened the
vitality of the orchards, and aided to some
extent in their destruction; and |at this time
there is every indicatlou that the same result is
to follow, and wo shall need to guard the orchard
during tbo coming year from an oror-orop, unless
the late frost shall do the work for us.
Wo aro largely indebted to Dr. Hull for valuable
lessons in the thinning of fruit, and I respect-*
fully call attention to ids teaching, not only for
the poach, the pear, and the cherry, but lor that
most valuable of all fruit, the apple.
DEMAND FOU CIDEII,
There Is a demand for a superior article of
cider, and there Is no reason why ourorcbkrdlsts
should be behind those -of Now Jeisoy in Uiat
respect. The samples hero shown proyo that
this may bo accomplished.' This will add greatly
to the value of tho applo*orchard.
qiDER-VINRUAR. , '
> We need more thorough lessons in tho making
of oldor-vinogar, and tbo monitor of putting it
on tho market. Ago and careful racking-off be
fore shipping aro tbo essentials to this end, and
their observance should be regarded by all, and
ought to nearly double the value of tho orchard
in tho making of this product.
ADULTERATION OF FOOD.
Wo must ask our Legislature to pass a law
protect people from Injury, by tho adulteration
or food, including fruits for food and medicine.
Other countries aro in this respoot careful of the
health of tho people, while hero there is no pro
tection against this class of wrongs, aud It has
now come to bo a orvlng evil that must com
mand attention.
SELLING DT WEIGHT.
Wo must also ask that ait articles of a dry
matter bo sold by weight instead of mos.suro.
This should apply to berries, eggs, and all pro
ducts that are not really fluid.
ONLY AN OPINION,
The voting on tho merits of onr fruits has
oftou had a tendency to mislead, and wo should
Slve more weight to the experience of good cul
vatora, rather than to the votes of lessen
formed persons.
ORCHARD OP THE INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY.
The experimental orchard of tho Industrial
University should now, to a largo extent, take
tho place of individual effort, and its lessons
should bo of piactical value. Tho orehardist,
Mr. Vickroy, has tbo fullest confidence of this
Society, and it is to be hoped that ho will bo re
tained in Its charge. An application should bo
mado to tho Trustees for tho froo distribution of
cions of such varieties as may prove of valuo, or
give promlao of snob, in order to a wider teat in
all parts of tho Stato. Such distribution should
ho to orchardists rather than to nurserymen.
This experimental orchard was created at the
expense of the Stato, and It should ho used to
further advance tbo valuo of tho orchards of tho
Stato.
THE FOREST.
Forestry is making fair progress, and those
trees of a commercial valuo aro being planted.
At tho head of this list is the European larch
for ties, fence-posts, and similar uses: tho
Oaaco-orango (in all tho south half of the
State), tbo ash, maples, olm, hickory, walnut,
and willow. In tho sonth part of tbe Slate tho
Osago is perhaps tho most valuable for general
use, and must take its place at the head of tbo
list for supplies of wagon-timber.
$3,007.34
. 102.03
It {a dow well understood that Ostgo hedges
must do plashed at from 6 to 8 years old, and
and afterwards bo kept in check by the shears.
The simple cuttiug-baok and the let-alone plans
have not been a success.
THE IIAILUOADB.
The railroads have began to appreciate the
value of horticultural products as a feature in
their earnings, and have given tho subject of
freights and handling more attention, in order
to foster this department of their business ; and
yot there is room for further improvement.
PACKAGES.
Until fruit !s sold bv weight wo shall make
little progress in thin direction. At present tho
study is to soil the least for the most money,
and not how wo may make the most for tho
least money. Barrels, boxes, and buckets aro
of an uncertain measure, and are sold by guess
rather thau by measure or by weight. The buy
er says, “I guess that barrel bolus 2% bushels,
and the other one 3 bushels." Weighing would
cheapen the coat of tho package, and lesson the
freight, and bo an advantage to both buyer and
soltor, and leave loss opportunity for falso re
turns of tho commission-men.
Year attention has been called to some of these
subjects before; but they continue to press on
our attention, and will do so until they shall be
fully mot and provided for.
TOE NSW MANAGEMENT OF TIIE INDUSTKIAIi UNI-
VERSITY
calls for our earnest sympathies; and, so long as
It endeavors to bo of practical valuo to the great
interest of horticulture, it should bo ouoour
agod. Tho day is past wbon a dissent from its
management may bo construed into a hostility
to the duties that aro imposed upon it. Its hor
ticultural department, to a groat extent, should

Bin i 1 have been induced to trouble yon with

of tbo following facts: He tolls us that Spain

(tho marines tho most elegant corps In tbo

70,000 sailors on the reserve, 7 Iron-clads with
100 guns, 11 frigates with 401 guns, aud a num
ber of smaller vessels, In all 080 guns. This
official report may have been correct
some tlmo ago, but wo must recol
lect that Cartagena foil Into the

about thirteen of tho best vessels of her navy,
including four irou-olads,—tbo Nuraanola, Yitto

English fleets, returned to the Oastolar Govern

Chicago, Doc. 0, 1873.
To the Editor of The Chicago Tribune
Sint Best assured that, if I did not fool my
self and tho public deeply wronged aud out
raged, I would not force mysolf on your notice.
Cacoolhoa scribondi is not my failing; yot tbo
following circumstances aro of euoh nature as to
require your and and all other good citizens' im
mediate attention and thorough investigation:
Bomo weeks ago, burglars onterod my resi
dence, on Prairlo avenue, between tbo hours of
2 and 4 in tho morning. Thoy ransacked tho
iowor part, and doubtless would have continued
their search had not Ofllcer Berger, of tbo
Cottage Grove Station, boon on tbo alert and
disturbed tho thieves. Owing to tbo superior
vigilance and intrepidity of ibis officer, and
after severe fighting, one of tho burglars,
named Thompson, alias Conway, was arrested.
Tho other for want of prompt assistance, es
caped. It was at tho risk of his life that tho
bravo officer secured his prisoner. Subsequent
ly, tho man was tried before a Police Magistrate,
and, after several delays, was sent for trial to
tho Criminal Court. Tho Grand Jury, at tho
November sitting, brought in a truo bill for bur
glary against Thompson. You know it in not
any easy task to follow up all those proceedings:
it involves loss of time, pationco, and business.
Wbftt with adjournments, attendance on differ
ent courts, consultations, &0., several days woro
spent.
On tho day fixed for his trial at tho Criminal
Court, I was ready to give my testimony; and I
understood all tho witnesses woro subpeonaed,
aud tho caso thoroughly worked up by tbo police
officor. Imagine my surprise and indignation
when I was calmly told by our bland Slate's At
torney that tbo prisonor bad been bailed, and
ho could not now bo found, but that ho
would forfeit the bonds. Great satisfaction, for
sooth. My house had boon robbed, and a man
caught in the very act; my family's security en
dangered : my wife’s nerves unstrung ana al
most paralyzed ,so that she was incapacitated for
several days, and is still in constant dread ; an
officer had risked his life to do his duty ; had,
along with his Sergeant and myself, spout days
in serving tho public by trying to convict a felon ;
and then to bo assured that tho bond—tho straw
ball—was to bo estreated, was poor, very poor
consolation, Was this not adding insult to in
jury?
I was approached by a man, and certain hints
thrown out, aud innuendoes given, that it
would bo to my interest not to prosecute, and I
would bo well remunerated for all my
trouble aud outlay. Tho officer who
captured tho burglar was also ap
proached, and bo says a largo sum of
money offered, aud by him scornfully rejected.
Tho Clerk of tho Court save that be considered
tho bail insufficient; but still tho Judge said ho
would tako it. Whether he was satisfied as to
its sufficiency, or thought tho prisoner an honor
able man. it is not within my province to un
ravel. Tuo Clork further stated that it was bis
honest conviction that the prisonor was ont of
the State in a few hours after his release.
HEDGE.
This is a plain and unvarnished narrative of
foots. A felon caught in tbo act admitted to
boil. What kind of bail ? Two men, named
respectively Milton Forbes and John H. Leon*
ard, both unknown to mo, but known to others,
—not, as I have boon informed, as men who are
responsible. Our State’s Attorney, and the
whole coterie of ofQoials. know whether those
men are professional bailors or not.
Should felony bo a bailable offense? Is money
payable to the State, or oven to the individual, a
compensation for or satisfaction of an injury
which amounts to a felony ? If eo, then nave
proper bail taken. If wo have professional bail
ors in our midst, it does not speak much for tho
capacity of our officials if they do not know it.
A man who has tho slightest suspicion of bis
genuineness should be rejected. Our Prosecut
ing Attorney—who, when ho has an audience, so
loudly and vehemently denounces crime, corrup
tion, and bribery—should see that tho Courtis
nob deceived in taking bail.
Misdemeanors are the only class of wrongs
against tho person or property that should be
bailable. When a crime rises to felony, and that
branch known os burglary, tho prisoner shonid
not be bailed,—more especially when ho has boon
caught in tho aet, or tho proofs aro indisputable.
But, sir, after a careful survey of tbo facts, 1
have come to tbo conclusion that, when tho
public press follows up a case, it is prosecuted
successfully 5 and it is only when it is aroused to
denounce a wrong or expose villainy that others
—whether to gain notoriety or not I know not—
become virtuous, loyal, loud in their protesta
tions of honor, and prosccuto with vim. I
say this advisedly. How many true bills are
found, and in bow many oases was a nolle
prosequi entered? There wore about Jivehwi
dred criminal charges not prosecuted last year,
or rather this year, although true bills wore
found. Some of that number had created
a sensation, and tho press had no
ticed them. What is tho use of our
county being to tho expense of a Grand Jury if
nearly one-half of their true bills are not prose
cuted. Think of it: in ouo year five hundred 1
Tbo public would like to know wby is it. An
An evasive or general answer is not sufficient.
When facts aro so patent, ami wrongs so often
recurring, we want men not to speak in plati
tudes. It has come to this pass, that it is doubt
ful whether any groat outrage, like tbo one com
mitted on tho young girl a few evenings ago,—
assaulted when returning homo, and an officer
stabbed in trying to make the arrest,—will bo
prosecuted. B. 0. Givins.

Opinion on the President’s
Message,
Some of Its Recommendations,
From Our Own Correeoondent,
As I sat In tho gallery Tuesday afiordoon, and
saw every seat filled, and tho background behind
tho members occupied by standing or sitting
Cabinet-Ministers, Judges, ox-mombcrs, Bureau
crats, and preferred visitors, all
WAITIMQ FOB TUB PBERIDENT's MESSAGE,
it seemed to mo to bo a very decent and assuring
econo. 1 hardly see how any foreigner, repre
senting money, Christianity, or hope in man.
could bavo looked at it without feeling that the
United States bos made no decline as an organic,
self-understanding, modern nation.
It is seldom that any President's message has
boon hoard in person by tho representatives of
more constituencies. Both parties were equally
considerate and respectful. Both races in tho
galleries, with Japan adding its vigilant spies,
sat through the very long reading which Mr. Mc-
Pherson, with his weak voice and occasional at
tempts at declamation, did not much relievo.
TUB MESSAGE
was a long one, because tho President has no
kn&ok for bringing liko things together by tho
law of association, and sparing words.
Bis stylo is that of a country-preacher,
who makes a separate head for evory suggestion
which comes to him, and preaches tho littio boys
into something very like the Saints' rest. It was
a dull message, because there was nothing lu
minous in tho man behind It, who has made tho
best of tho accident of battle which raised him
to civil magistracy, and therefore feels his way
along In diotion ; never energizing a phrase;
never lightening one ; without ornamentation,
either of art or inspiration ; and bonce there is
not a peg la this dreary surface on which you
can hang your bat, while you turn around and
ask if there may not bo something in it. I mot
Mr. Sumner in one of the corridors, and asked
him if ho had been listening to the annual scrap
book.
" Yes," lie said. “It seems to mo that each
of his Secretaries must have presented a pistol
at his head and said : 1 Mr. President, if you
don't insert iu your message a sufficient amount
of tho report of my Department, I'll blow your
head off t' "
Tho manner of
composing these messages
is more embarrassing to the President than to
bis Heads of Departments, and harder upon
thorn than their Bureau-officers. It is difficult
to make the subordinate Chiefs come promptly
forward with their fstimotos and accouute;
and hence tbo President gets tho informa
tion last of all in tho actual totals.
But such a mind as should occupy the Supremo
Magistracy has no business to bo bothering with
tho multiplication-table, aud merely editing and
annotating Department-reports. If we woro
properly served at tbo head of tbo State, wo
should nave a President who would separately
summon bis Oabinot-Minlstors to tho discussion
of their Departments, and who bad ail along kept
in his mind tho main course of affairs. Then,
dismissing those gentry, who aro but bis
Lioutouauto-of-Polico, tbo condition of tbo
Nation should rise upon the sight of its ruler,
and, grappling with it in bis keen, clear, ex
perienced habit, bo should be able, like the
artist—
To take the charcoal from the peasant’s hand.
And, by tbo magic of Ida touch, at ouco
TrausQgurcd, an the hidden vlrtuea shine.
It may bn said that a message, being a more
statement of affairs to Congress, is of secondary
consequence like
A queen's speech
at tbo opening of Parliament; but there is no
conuection between the two oases. Tho Queen's
speech is littlo moro than tho reading of the
Decalogue, to which all good parishioners sub
mit, while they freely criticise the sermon,
which is moro nearly the President's message.
If tho Prime Minister of England should open
Parliament,—a mere party bead, responsible in
art and logic as well as in office, —wo should not
long expect him to keep his placo if ho gave an
nually a great scroll of slipshod scrap, com
mon-place, and second-rate suggestion, to tempt
tho oat-calls, shuffling of feet, etc., etc., of the
House of Commons.
With tho rank tho United States has attained
our population, annexations, discoveries of
mines, acceleration of energy, and steady victory
over despotic or retarding localisms, it should
bo an easy task for a President of capacity to
make his message a bloodless, inexpensive, and
powerful instrumentality to dissipate doubt and
error, harmonize factious, enhance our credit,
and bo the voice of “ ono speaking with authori
ty, aud not as tbo Scribes.’
But so weak have been tho President's docu
ments, because based upon defective knowledge,
and always most confident when least informed,
that ho baa himself complained of Congress for
not paying more respect to his proposals. So
well understood is
TUE PIIESIDEHT’S INSUTFICIEKCY,
that ho was re-elected, and is to-day supported,
by tbo majority of tho people, out of sympathy
for his weakness, and out of wonder that his
mistakes havo not been serious. Liko tho little
boy who undertakes, with a nervous nature, to
speak his piece boforo an audience, and halts,
and blubbers, aud touches all hearts, until tho
Principal of the school takes him up in his arms
and carries him off, and then reports, amidst
thunders of applause, that tbo young martyr
has attained tho highest prize for oratory,—the
President has twice come to the front, and is
willing to bo ontreatod again. Tbo wiso man in
tbo Now York Nation, who discovered that
Sentiment governed this Republic, may point to
the President's popularity, and walk up and take
tho tart.
the president's nnn annual message—
not to mention special messages hero and there—
vindicates previous criticism upou him, by
showing that his defects wero not of experience,
but of tbo blood. Ho has not improved in five
years. Everything Is haphazard, fugitive,
neither digested nor assimilated; and the mes
sage shows that tbo man is not conscious of his
ignorance, and is yet so vain that none of his
Ministers dare criticise the first draft.
Lot us take it up aud glance at it.
Thoro ore two recommendations on tho sub
ject of
First, that it bo admitted as a State, although
its population was only 40,000 at the dots of tbo
last census, which is the only data that a Presi
dent should cousult, and the metropolitan coun
ty is reported as Laving loss than 7.000 inhabi
tants. Yet this State, if admitted, would have
as many Senators as Illinois, with 2,510,000 in
habitants by tho same census, or New York with
4,883.000. Rut the President answers his first
recommendation when he comes to the second
on the same subject, which is to oncourago a
canal for tho relief of Colorado with a land
grant, because, as ho says, there ore from 800 to
600 miles of width of arid land between it aud
tho States.
Hero we are asked to give representation in
the Senate to a Territory of less population than
some wards of Chicago, at an expense of mill*
ions, which, of course, the two Colorado Sena*
tors must vote for in order to keep the now State
from depletion and sliding back on our bands,
like Nevada.
When we look at the recommendation for the
canal, what is it ? Where is the water to come
from which Nature haa refused to that vast, arid
iutor-rogion, suflloiont, when spread over 500
miles of desert in shallow rills, to fructify the
whole, without evaporation on the way ? The
prominent man In Colorado, who haa the Inter
ests of the Territory at heart, said to mo, the
day the message was made public:
*‘lf I wanted Colorado to enjoy a season of
speculative prosperity, to bo followed by certain
collapse, I would say, the President is all right.
Put ho has boon taken in, while making a short
visit to Colorado, by Gov. Evans and some of
our big operators, who have boon stuck in build
ing the Kansas Pacific Railroad. Their land
grant is of very little account without irrigation,
and they are willing to spend the puhllo money
nnou an improbable experiment of that kind.
The admission of Colorado at present moans only
the extension of area of jobbery in the Senate,
the diversion of our people from individual in
dustry to premature political activity, and no
good, in the long run. to any Territory in the
West. Congress might do well to embrace all
the Territories in one Senatorial representa
tion. M

Thus It appears that the President was bo car

that ho proposes to put it in the Senate, food it

MARINE DISASTER.
The City of Detroit Founders in
Saglnuw Hay—Supposed Loss of All
on Hoard-
Prom (Ae Detroit Tribune, Dee, 8,
On Saturday evening, between 0 and 10 o'clock,
intelligence reached hero of the loss of the pro
peller City of Detroit, belonging to Oapt. John
Pridgoon, of this city, with tho probable loss of
all on board. Associated Press dispatches wore
published in tho Sunday papers, but as they did
not represent tho circumstances correctly, wo
herewith give tho facts, so far as known, obtain
ed from Oapt. Pridgoon himself, who received a
dispatch from Port Elgin, Out., on Saturday
evening.
It appoara that tho propeller, with tho barge
Guiding Star in tow, was on a voyage from Mil
waukee to Sarnia, She had ou board a cargo of
wheat and flour, while tho barge is understood
to have boon carrying 24,000 bushels of wheat*
On last Wednesday night they woro coming down
Lako Huron, and woro in the vicinity of Saginaw
Bay. When the galo of Thursday morning arose
they must have boon off Saginaw Bay, and wore
firobaoly in tho worst placo on all tho chain of
akos.
The dispatch received by Mr. Pridgoon came
from Cupt. Maurice Barrett, of tho bargo Guid
ing Star, formerly the propeller of that name. It
stated that ou Thursday morning tho propeller
and barge, being struck by agate, wore compelled
to separate. tho propeller leaving the Star to
take care of herself. That, at 7:1)0 ou Thursday
morning, tbo propeller wont down in Saginaw
Bay. That tho barge had been driven across
Lake Huron by the wind (which was blowing from
tbo southwest), and was at tho time uf sending
tbo dispatch nine miles out from Port Elgin, Ont.,
and was leaking. That ho (I he Oaplaiu), with a
crow of men from tho barge, had come ashoro in
a very bad plight, with the view of obtaining as
sistance.
Mr. Pridgoon at onco communicated with Port
Huron, ana the tug Priudivillo was started from
that point yesterday morning, and it was oxpoct
od that she would roach tho bargo by night and
bring her down tbo lake to Sarnia, if no unfore
seen difficulty arose. In Mr. Barrett, tbo Captain
of the barge, Mr. Pridgeon has every confidence,
having known him for years, amlkuowiug him to
to bo a trusty aud faithful man, one who will make
ovory possible exertion to bring his vessel safe
into port. The barge is an unusually good ono
of its class, an is evident from its crossing Lake
Huron as it did in such terrible weather. Hex
cargo will, no doubt, bo somewhat damaged, but
it is believed that the vessel will come safely into
port.
It seems quite clear that tho City of Detroit
baa fouudorod in Bay, nut far from
where tho Water Witch went down several years
ago. 'Nothing is known as to whether any of hoc
officers or crow got away in boats or not, or
whether any are saved or not. Mr. Pridgoon,
however, and other men familiar with tho stato
of affairs on tho lakes at tho present time, bad
given up hope yesterday that any have survived.
If any had got to laud before, they would prob
ably have boon hoard from now, aud tho air and
water are now so cold that it is impossible for
men to Uvo out any longth of time in open
boats. It is therefore doomed probable that all
on board the propeller perished.
Tho City of Detroit bad about twenty persons
on board, including only officers and crow, and
no passengers, so far as known. Tho Captain
was Itcdmond Ryder, brother of Cant. Gcorgo
Ryder, who was lost on the Water Witch. With
*hitn was also a eon. The Clerk was Andrew
Young, of Milwaukee; the steward, James
Phelps ; tho waiter, John Campbell, of Detroit;
tho lirab engineer, James RockoU, of Green
Bay ; tho First Mato, Daniel Mclntyre, of Poiut
Edward. Those are the only persons ou board
of tbo propeller who aro known to Mr. Pridgoon
or his Irionds. Tho otbor employes aro usually
known ouly to the Captaiu or other officers.
The City of Detroit was a wooden propeller of
about 70U tons burden, aud was nearly 7 years
old. Sbo was built at Newport, and, being a fine
vessel and having great power, she was doomed
one of tho best sea-going boats on tho lakes.
This circumstance explains her being sent on a
voyage so late in the season. She was valued
at $60,000, was entirely uninsured, and was
owned by Mr. Pridgoon alone, who therefore
loses heavily by the disaster. Hor cargo was
valued at $25,000, aud it is understood that it
was insured. Tho immediate cause of her going
down cannot bo more than conjectured. Old
seamen all agree, however, that tho galo was ono
of tbo very worst which has been experienced in
this vicinity for a quarter of a century, aud their
ouly wonder was that not moro vessels woro
lost. Tho propellers Scotia. Vanderbilt, and
James Fisk, Jr., woro all in advance of tho City
of Detroit, aud, getting round Poiut aux
Barques before tho height of tha galo was ex
perienced, they passed through safely, while tho
Detroit went down. Further information con
cerning her will bo awaited with iutouso anx
iety.
TTlio fVcstcEioator Libel Suit*
From the Sets Fork Timm, Dec. 7,
At tho opening of tho Circuit Court at TThito
Plains yesterday morning. J. 0. Dykomau, of
counsel for Mr. Frauds E. Eldridge, charged
with the publication of a libel on Mrs. Lucy
Ann McMahon, addressed tho jury on behalf of
his client for upward of an hour. In tbo mean
while, a consultation between the other counsel
engaged iu the case, on tho part of tho
plaintiff aud tho defendant, tho Bov. Robert
iloldcn, took place, and agreed upon a com
promise and complete settlement of all tho suits
involved in tho matter, seven in number. An
agreement was signed by tho several parties in
terested that oil the suits on all sides should bo
withdrawn, all tho letters written by Mrs. Me-
Mahou to Eidridgo and to Mr. and Mis. Holden,
aud all loiters written by Eidridgo to Mrs. Mc-
Mahon, about a bushel, should bo destroyed in
presouco of tbo oouusol engaged. It was decided
by them on all sides that Mrs. McMahon, at tho
time of writing tho letters to Mr. Eidridgo, was
laboring under an impaired mental condition ;
that no suspicion rested upon any of their
minds iu regard to Mrs. McMahon's
chastity or her unblemished reputation aa
a wife and mother. On the other hand, it was
conceded that tho Rev. Mr. Holden, in delivering
the letter of Eidridgo and verbal message to Mr.
McMahon, did so from a sense of duty, being
aotuatod in tbo matter by a desire to keep from
tho public an exposure of the facts winch ho
had become acquainted with from Eidridgo. Tho
stipulations entered Into wore put in shape and
contldod to tho enro of Ex-Juago Cochrane, pre
paratory to being placed on file among the rec
ords of the court; aud tho concluding scone of
committing the letters and papers connected
with this famous case of alleged libel, black
mailing, and exposure of family secrets to tbo
llamen in tho yard in tho roar of the Court-
House, was carried out, to tho great satisfaction
of all couuorucd.

Campbell's wife, and endeavoring to induco her
to leave him. The, animosity between the
two men bad finally progressed so far
that it was generally understood by the
neighbors that, when they mot, blood
would flow. On Wcduosday afternoon, Camp
bell was in Drury Bishop's saloon, when he saw
Stallings approaching the house. Ho quickly
stopped into a back room, and when Stallings
had entered the saloon, not knowing his enemy
was there, Campbell stopped out of the hack
room with a revolver m his hand, walked up to
him and said, “ Stalling, you have boon the
cause of all my trouble I" With that ho dis
