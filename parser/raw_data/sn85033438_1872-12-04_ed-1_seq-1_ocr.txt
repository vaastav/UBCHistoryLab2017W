MARBLE POE THE ST. LOUIS CUSTOM
HOUSE.
As the papers arc giving some attention
to the merits of thodlfl'ercnt kinds of stone
outof which itls proposed to build the new
custom house at St. Louis, wohavo thought
It no moro than due our Knoxville marble
to give some facts concerning it that are
worthy of the consideration of the St.
Louis people. ,
The quarry from which tho marble used
in our custom house is taken, seems in ex
haustible. We visited it when it was first
opened, and we visited it yesterday only
to find that all tho stone taken out for our
large and beautiful new building, has
scarcely made an impression upon the vast
bed of solid marble that now lies exposed.
It is on the edge of tho Tennessee river,
on a high Mull' about four miles East of
Knoxville,and the marble in abed about a
quarter of a mile wido and running back
fully a mile, seems to bo in quantity
enough to construct all tho public build
ings now projected. The Government has
expended about eight thousand dollars
in opening the quarry, providing steam
power and machinery for sawing the mar
ble into any sized block desired and in con
structing tram-roads, derricks and con
veniences for loading tho stone on boats
for transportation. As the marblo needed
for this government building will soon be
all quarried, and as that remaining can bo
taken out and sawed at a trilling expense,
with all the machinery now there, it seems
,to us tho Government would save a great
sum by shipping the stone for the St. Louis
building from Knoxville. Gentlemen
haying control of this quarry liavo pro
posed to sell tho Government the marble
for the building at $2 75 per cubic foot.
If this is not satisfactory, they propose to
turn tins rich quarry over to the Govern
meat and let it quarry and prepare the
4stono under the direction of its own tern
jiloyees. ThisMsfcertaiulv an honorable
hnd'uGeTSi.roosltioun
Tliero are several reasons why the St.Lou
is building should be built, of this marble
In tho first place the stone is unquestion
ably equal if not superior for that purpose
to any in the United States. Wo saw at
tho quarry, yesterday, some of this marble
that for many years has been washed by
tno Tennessee river and subjected to the
frost, and stains from dirt washings. Chip
off tho surface and you see at once the
clear, pure marblo unstained and unhurt.
This shows that the marble has a compact
grain and would not stain on exposuro in
ji wall. While it is hard and close grained
it is free from Hint and can bo worked with
ordinary tools. Under tho glass it shows
.perfect crystalization and oven texture.
We have seen a letter from Supervising
Architect Mullett, in which ho unquali
fiedly pronounces it tho most durable stono
in this country. General Holman yester
day gave this marblo a very severe lire test,
heating it as hot' as possiblo In a furnace
and plunging it into cold water. It did
not burst, crumble, Hake or seem to be in
jured at all. A piece of sandstone
crumbled at tho same test. Wo there
fore claim it will resist heat better
than granite, better than sandstone and
better than any stone wo know of. In
view of tho lats experiences at Chicago and
Boston this is a quality worthy of great
consideration. It weighs one hundred and
eighty pounds to tho cubit foot, and will
last as long as any building material
known.
This marblo is preferable again because
it can be prepared for use at a very reason
able cost. Under the prcsentarrangement
Gen. Holman saws and shapes the stone
for thirty cents a superficial foot. Tho cost
when the stono is cut entirely has been two
dollars for the same measure. Tho freight
lrom Knoxville to St. Louis can bp con
tracted for at sixty cents per cubic fooL
Wo refer to this subject because we kco
the merits of the different kinds of stone
uro being discussed and because wo feel our
jMioplo are deeply Interested in tho result.
If our quarries can supply the government
wants it will be a source of great revenue
to our people. Wo believe we have tho
best, and all things considered, the cheapest
building marble in this country aud hence
wish to bring its merits properly before tho
-people.
We see from our exchanges that the cold
weather wo aro now having come from
much severer weather in tho North and
Northwest, Navigation pn tho lakes and
oanals Is about closed and some of the
umaller riven aro frozen. Tho Winter
from present indications will bo a long and
severe one In tho North. It has come up
on us earlier and moro severe than usual,
but we will doubtless yet have some mild
er aud plefimter days.

Moxtoomkky, Nov. 30. This morning
a detachment of the Seventh United

yards from the Capitol grounds and bivo
uacked. Intense excitement followed,
but learning that the troops were intended
for a mciacommitaiusposxcniul nottodrivo
thoLegislaturo from tho Capitol, tho ex
citement subsided somewhat. The Legis
lature passed a bill and sent it to Governor
Lewis, but ho refused to receive it. A
Joint resolution was passed raising a com
mittee to communicate uie mcis oi mo
situation by telegraph to the Government
at Washington and appointing a delegate
to present tho written statement of the
case to tho President. Tho Legislature ex
presses great confidence that tho President
will sustain them when tho facts arc laid
beforo lilm. Jn answer to tho committee
of the Capitol, Governor Lewis yesterday
replied that two bodies claims his recogni
tion and that tho members of the other re
ceived a. majority of tho votes east and that
ho would not recognize tho Capitol Legis
lature because If the persons whom he said
did not receive a majority vote wero in
cluded the body would bo without a quo
rum. The court houso body did nothing to
day, but has been In secret session a con
siderable portion of tho day. The Advil''
User, the central liberal Democratic organ
of the State, in its issue for to-morrow
morning says, that In view of tho deatli of
Mr. Greeley wo recommend all tho Greeley
Electors to cast their votes for Grant and
make his election unanimous.
Moxtoomkky, Dec. 2. Owing to the
death of Whitfield, the Conservative
member from Tuscaloosa, tho Capitol
bodies adjourned to ten o'clock to-morrow.
The other body did nothing. Spencer has
been nominated by tho Republicans and
will probably receive a majority of tho
votes cast by the court house body. The
Conservatives meet In caucus to-night and
will probably nomlnato a candidate.

It compliments Hon. Charles Fran

nova, and Mr. Bancroft, Minister at Ber
lin, for their earnest services in tho matter
of the Geneva and the San Juan Arbitra
tions, the decision i utile latter leaving tho
United States for tho first time without
any question as to disputed boundaries.
In regard to tho fisheries and to our rela
tions witn tlio lJritisli North American
Provinces, the President says that ho has
received notice that the Imperial Parlia
ment and thoDominion Government have
passed laws to carry tho provisions of tlio
Treaty of Washington into operation, and
he, therefore, recommends a legislation of
Congress in the samo direction. Ho speaks
of tho friendly relations of tho United
States with all the Governments of Eu
rope. Ho refers to tho Vienna Interna
tional Exposition, recommends tho fitting
up oi two national vessels to convey tho
goods oi exuiuttors to Trieste and suggests
that a proposition bo mado to havo the
next great exposition in this country in
1S70, at the timo of tlio Centennial Cele
bration in Philadelphia.
CU11A.
He refers to tho disturbed condition of
Cuba, and says that no advance to
wards pacification in that island has been
made, while tlio insurrection had gained
no advantages and exhibited no moro of
tlio elements of power or prospective suc
cess than a year ago. Neither had Spain
succeeded in repressing tho insurrection.
Tho parties to the strife wero standing in
tho samo attitude as for a long timo past.
Tho continuation of slavery in that island
ho regarded as among tho strongest causes
of the continuance of the strife, and ho
thinks that the abolition of slavery and tho
institution of other reforms there, could
not fail to advance tho restoration of peace
and order. It was generally to be hoped
that the present liberal government
of Spain will voluntarily adopt that view.
He, referring to our relatlonswith China
and Japan, the President recommends
provides for maintaining four American
youths in each of these countries ad a part
of tlio diplomatic family of our Ministers.
oun FINANCES.
Ho give details of tho revenuo received
in tlio post year aud of tho reduction to
tlio amount of over one hundred millions
of tlio public debt. He expresses a doubt
whether any further reduction in taxation
is practicable for the present and ho recom
mends that no moro legislation bo had
on that subject except to correct errors of
omission or of commission in tho present
laws until sulllclenttimo shali;huvo elaps
ed to provo that It can be done and still
leavo sufficient revenuo to meet the our
rent expenses, to pay Interest on tho pub
licdebt and to provide fortho sinking fund.
He suggests, also, that tlio currency shnll
bo as soon as possible brought to a par with
Gold.
INTl'.HNAIi IMlMtOYKMUKTS.
He says that various enterprises will bo
brought to the attention of Congress for
tho cheapening of tlio transportation of
produce from tho West to tlio Atlantic sea
coast, and suggests that steps should be
taken to gain all available Information to
ensuro equitablo and judicious legislation.
In this connection ho refers favorably to
the proposed routo to connect tho Missis
sippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charles
ton and Savannah, by way of the Ohio
and Tennessee Itivers, also to tho proposed
extension of tho Kanawha and James
Itivcr Canal and tho Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal, and to tho proposed canal around
Niagara Falls. Ho says that there should
bo an almost continuous system of land
locked navigation from Maine to tho Gulf
of Mexico, naturo having provided n
greater part of tho routo and tho obstacles
to bo overcome being within tlio skill of
engineers.
OL'K NAVY AND COlIMKltC'IAI. .M.UIJNK.
He calls attention to tlio weakness, of
tho American navy and endorses tho coc
ommendatlons of tho Secretary of tho
Navy in that respect. Ho recommends
subsidies for steamship lines to Brazil and
between San Francisco, New Zealand, and
Australia; also an increaso of tho salaries
of heads of bureaus. He favors tho abo
lition of the franking privilege and rec
ommend a modification of Its existing
evils. Ho also recommends the adoption
by Congress of tho best method of acrulr-
rlng title to all telegraphic linos now in
operation, and of connecting that Fcrvice
wlth tho postal service. It is not proba
ble that the subiect can receive proper con
sideration at this session, but ho thinks
tho movement might bo inlatlatcd so that
liuuro action mav bo had fair to the irov-
ernment, and to tho privato parlies con
cerned. He calls attention to the
alarming falling oil' in tho Amer
ican carrying trade, nnd says
that a yearly expondlturo of five million
dollars for the next live years to restore
that trade would lie a profitable invest
ment. Till: KUKI.UX AND Tltr-SlNMANS.
.Referring to KuKlux outrages, tho Pres
ident expresses his conviction that the
time is not far distant when the obvious
advantages of good order and peace will
Induce an abandonment of all such com
binations, and when it will bo Unnecessary
to carry on prosecutions or to inflict pun
ishment in ordor to protect citizens from
tlio lawless men of such combinations.
Ho makes suggestions in regard to the
Indians, that they shall all bo confined to
the territory South of Kansas, and that
farms bo secured to them In feo aud
severalty.
llo recommended that a nirther census
be taken lu 187o, but that no reapportion
ment of members of Congress lie mado un
der it in only one of the territories.
A.W.OW at ror.YOAMV.
Utah is in a condition of affairs regarded
by the President as unsatisfactory. It had
seemed to bo the policy of tlio Utah Leg
islature to ovauo an responsibility to the
United States Government and even In
hold opposition hostile to it. Ho recom
mends careful revision of tlio present law
and tho enactment of laws that will Micun
neaco, equality of all citizens beforo the
law and the ultimate extinguishment of
polygamy.
Ho recommends an appropriation to re
imburse tho city of Washington, for work
dono in front of tho public reservation!,
and for the embellishment of the publli
building and grounds. Ho favors action
to give greater cclut and success to tho ob
servance of tho Centennial Anniversary of
American Independence.
In regard to Cival Service, ho Bays he
will carry out the rules during his term of
office, but suggests that there should be
tho direct acting of Congress to mako the
system binding on Ills successors and to
secure to tho public service a practical
method of obtaining faithful and efficient
officers and employees.

The Treasuryfcport says that necessity
exists for a new if-suo of national haul
notes.
Tho Secretary exonerates Assistant
Treasurer Hillhouso from neglect of duty
in tlio stamp division defalcation In the
Assistant Treasury ai New York.
Tho Secretary again recommends the
passoge of a bill to amend and consolidate
tho navigation and customs collection laws
of the United States. As tho leading pur
suits of the country aro now stronger than
ever before, in tho possession of aderjuah
capital anil a supply of intelligent laborers
thcrif may be a moderato reduction from
time to timo in tho rato of duties as the
diminishing expenses of tho Government
shall penult without cither alarming at
that or injuring labor.
Ho says tho circulation of tho banks
should bo fixed aud limited and that pow
er to change tho volume of paper in circu
lation within the limits established by law
should remain in tho Treasury Depart
ment. A degree of flexibility In tho volume
of currency is essential for two reasons.
First, tho business of tlio Department can
not bo transacted properly if a limit U
mado and tho power to raise tho circula
tion above or reduce it below that limit i
denied. Secondly, there is a nocessil
every autumn for. moving the crops with
out delay from tho South and West to tlu
sca board that thoy may bo in hand for ex
port and consumption as wanted. Tin
problem Is to find a way of Increasing the
currency for moving tho crop and dimin
ishing it at once when that work is done.
This js a necessary work and inasmuch
as it-can not be confided to tho banks tin
power should bo retained in tho Treasury
Department.
Behoving that tho country is not pre
pared to sustain tlio policy of contraction
tlio Secretary considers tho means b
which tho valuo of our currency may be
Improved. Tlio basis of u policy of ini
provementsmust bo found in a steady n -fusal
to add to tho paper In circulation un
til it is of tlio samo value .essentially as
coin, tills being accepted as tho settled pur
pose of the country, there can be no per
manent increase of tlio difi'eronco between
paper and coin, and an opportunity will
bo given for tho influence of natural
causes, tending upou tho whole to a better
financial condition. All legislation limit
ed in Its operation to the paper issues of
tho Government, whether bearing interest
or not, and which in its effects shall tend
to diminish the market valuo of coin, will
bo found upon analysis to contain a plan
for contracting tho volume of paper curren
cy, and all legislation so limited which
does not contain such a plan will prove In
effectual. Tho Secretary, without proceeding to the
discussion of the general subject of resum
ing specie payments, thinks all will have
been gained that Is of value, when tho
treasury shall bo "repared to pay tho de
maud notes of tho Government lu coin,
and tho banks shall bo prepared to pay
their notes either in coin or ! ,jal tender
notes, and then our good fortuuo will clear
ly appear In this, that our paper currency
is not exclusively of National Bank notes,
nor exclusively of United States aotes.
