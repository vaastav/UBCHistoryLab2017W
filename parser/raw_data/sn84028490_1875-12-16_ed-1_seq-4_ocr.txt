President Grant's message is a crude

forgotten child I While telling CongresH
how to save up money for special re

But the strangest and most unpardon
able omission of all is that he makes no
reference whatever to the whisky frauds
lately unearthed, and for which his
friends McDonald, Joyce, and Avery are
already in the penitentiary,, and Bah
cock, his private Secretary, in danger.
A little talk of reform in connection
with this question would have been
quite acceptable to thepeople, , But no,

war with Spain about Cuba, but attempts
no explanation of the activity in the

over Victoria Woodhull and her lecture,
be more explicit. In his notice he mid:

The military court tnartial appointed
to try Babcock met in Chicago last week
and finally concluded to adjourn for the
present and let the civil law take its
course. General Hancock gave the
reasons in full for this course. It would
seem that if Babcock is found guilty by
the civil court a military court martial
will not be necessary, and if acquitted it
will be unnecessary.. , ' , ' '

. , On the eve of dOparturo of Hon. lit B.
Payne to 'Washington to take his seat in
the Rational House of Representatives,
he was visited by a number of political
and personal friendsand called upon
him fof a speech, ,'rhe Plalndealcr gives
a synopsis of his remarks from which we
make the following extract:
Mr. Pavne referred to the fact that
when his name is called and entered up
on the records of the House, it will be
that of the first Democrat ever elected
from this (the Cleveland) district, his
predecessors having always been Whigs
or Republicans. 1 : Mr, Payne said that
much was expected from the next Mouse
of Representatives-too much, perhaps
from it, from the fact that there will be
much inexperience1 amongst he' mem
bers, but of one thing the people fnust
rest assured that there ' would be a
thorouuh scrutiny into the past manage
ment of tlie different departments' of ihe
government! and that .it, would bejhe
aim';of the Democrats to bring abont ad
ministrative .reform, and a reduction , in
the enormous amount of expenditures, so
beneficial, to the great army ot Kepuun
qan ofiice-holders. ! Democrats should
remember that the i President .! was
against them and that the .Senate was
still in the hands ot the mends 01 me aa
ministration, and that their object would
be to widen '.he breach that unfortunate
ly seemingly existed between Democrats,
but he trusted to the practical good seiisc
of the Democratic members of Congress,
and believed that such concessions of
opinion would be made one to another,
as would bring about that unity of action
and harmony so desirable now to brine
back the country to a firm foundation of
honesty , and jnstice in public artairs.
On the question of finance Mr.. Payne
said that there were differences. 1 . He
was not in favor of inflation, nor of un
due contraction. He was not an ex
treme man in his views upon this sub-
iect. hut he believed his fellow citizens of
the Democratic party, a large majority ,01
the business men ol , tne city, woiua
agree with him on the necessity of the re
peal of the law now as the i',' Sherman
bill" providing for the resumption of
specie payments in I8791 Keternng
briefly to the impracticability of ' that
measure he noted that he believed Dem
ocratic statesmanship wonld yet light the
way to an eventual return to the con
stitutional currency of the country with
out bringing shock and alarm to the bus
iness interests of the country or want and
suffering to the people , . . ;
Plucked. Home Building and Loan
Association No. 1, of Cincinnati, has
been plucked. It seems the President,
Rut-sell, is $22,000 short. "A , stormy
meeting of the shareholders took place
Friday evening last week and the eeene
was exciting. The Enquirer says ; ,
'Confusion reigned supreme, and amid
it all a man named Davis made the wel
kin ring by charging that Hon.. S. W.
Bard had $10,000 of the Association's
monev on a call loan. Mr. Bard was
silent under this withering charge, which
was annlaitded. and the Irish'! woman
said. "Och hone ! I'm robbed. I'm I bat's
a poor washerwoman that has gone bare-
rooted in the winter to put mv money in
here. O, the old robber ! They're all
robbers I" Three or four members had
the floor at once, shouting and yelling,
and the feeling waxed warm, until it
seemed that bloodshed would be ' the
outcome. Dlivis said he did not believe
that Russell was alone to blame in this
matter, and he was for bringing a crimi
nal prosecution against the otlicers. Thus
the confusion kent ud until midnight,
and out of it all came amotion instruct
ii g the committee that had reported to
act with the Attorney of the Association

as to secure the Society from loss.' The

and Russell will not be tjie wiiiy sufferer.
At Cleveland, on the 3d inst a man
named Adirr,' the driver 'of an express
waVon murdered his Wife with a hammer
in a horrible, manner, arid then drove to
the house of Mr. Benton, hitched,, and

Mrs. Benton and his step daughter, 23

The amendments to the national bank
ing law1 proposed J in-the repast of the
Controler of the Currency include sever
al, measures to throw new safeguards
around the management of National
banks, Among them is one that prohib
its thr deposit of more than ten per cent
of capital with any private banker or
any person or association other than aNa
tional bank. Such a rule, thoroughly en
forced might have prevented some of
the worst scandals in nationalbank man
agement if it had been in existence two
or three years ago. ,The repeal of the rej
quirement of two cent stamps upon bank
checks would meet with popular favor,
The stamps were always a great annoy-i
ance to the business community, 1
It is a notable f.ict.'ahd will probably
be confirmed .by the observation ol
others, that of the hundreds of men who
made their thousands and ten's of thous
ands of dollars in questionable ways dur
ing and after the war, and generally at
the expense of the government, very few
of them are now wealthy and prosper
ous, while others have been reduced al
most to pauperism-,
General Babcock does not deny
having sent dispatches to Joyce at St.
Louis, but he Says " tvery aispatcn
which I sent" will appear innocent the
moment he has an opportunity to ex-
nlain. And vet no dispatches disclosed
during the trial had more conclusive ear
m irks of conspiracy, man tne responses
of Joyce, who looking through his pris
on bars, still declares his innocence, are,
like those constructed by Babcock, pre-
prepared so as to . conceal intorma-
