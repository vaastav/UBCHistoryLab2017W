It is apparent from the figures p.ver
in this speech that the eot of the tojml
household in England is much greater,
certainly directly, than the cost of a repub
lican president, however large the family
and however widely extended the collateral
relations of the president may be. But the
Baronet was qaite rijrht in cautioning his
hearers against a republic without republi
can virtues A king or queen or president
who can keep the civil service of the kingdom
or republic free from corruption would he
cheap at five millions a year, while a Tweed
or a Murphy in authority is dear at any
price. Hut when a gentleman of great
wealth, good social position, fine abilities
and large attainments, like Sir Charles
Dilke, thus fearlessly exposes the costliness
and corruption attending royalty, and talks
about a republic as a remedy to one of the
largest parliamentary constituencies in Eng
land, it is safe to predict that the divinity

President's Message.
To the Senate and House of Reprritntatices:
In addressing my third Annual Message to '
the law-making branch of the Government it
is gratifying to be able to state that during 1
the past year success has generally attended
the effort to execute all laws found upon the
statute books. The policy has been, not to
inquire into the wisdom of the laws already
enacted, but to learn their spirit ad intent,
and to enforce them accordingly.
The past year has, under a wise Provi
dence, been one of general prosperity to the
nation. It has. however, been attended with
more than usual chastisements in the loss of
life and property by storm and fire. These
disasters have scived to call forth the best
elements of human nature in our country
and to develop a friendship for us on the
pari of foreign nations which goes far toward
alleviating the distresses occasioned by the
clement. '1 ho benevolent who have so gen
erously shared their means with the victims
of these misfortunes, will have tht-ir reward
KLloX Al FAIRS
O M
The relations of the United States with for
eign powers continue to be friendly. The
year has fen an eventful one in witnessing
two great nations, speaking one language
aud baring one lineage, settling by peaceful
arbitration disj ut,s of long standing, lia'de
at any time to bring those nations into
bloody and hostile conflict. An example ha
thus been set, which, if successful in its final
issue, may be followed hy other civilized na
tions.. and he the means finally ot returning

duty ot this protection has been i erformed
ty the M d later and the Consul General al
Paris and the various Consuls in France
under the supervision ol the latter, with
great kindness aa well as with prudence and
tact. This course has received the com
mendation of the German Government and
has wounded no susceptibility ol ttie French.
The government ol the Emperor of
Germany continues to manifest a friendly
lecling towards the nited State- and a
desire to harmonize with the moderate and
just policy which this government maintains
in its rilations with Asiatic powers as well
as with the South American Republics. I
have given assurances that tin
teel'ngs of that government ar. Ii
by the L'nitcd States.

I have been officially informed of the

Capital ot that kingdom to Rime In
conformity with the e tablisbed policy of the
United States I have recognized this change.
The ratification of the new- treaty of commerce
between the United Mat's and Italy have
been exchangi d. I be two powers have agreed
in this treaty that private proj erty nt sea
shall be (xcmpt ironi capture in case of war
between the two powers. The L'nited State
have spared bo opportunity of incorporating
this rule into the obligations of nations.
The lorty fir-t Congress, at its t lird s sion
made an appropriation for the organization
of a mixed Commission for adjudicating upon
claims of citizens of the United States against
Spa n, growing out of the insurrection in
cuba. L'hat Commission bac since been
organized. 1 tr.msmit herewith the corres
pondence relating to its formation and its
lurisdictioB. It is to be hoped that this
Commission will bffird tlie claimants a
complete remedy lor their injuries. It has
heen the agreeable duty of the United Mate
to preside over a Conference at Washington
between the Plenipotentiaries of Spain and
the allied South American Republics, which
has result d in an armistice, with the
reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.
The intimate friendly relations whicn have
so long existed between the United States
and hussia continue undisturbed. The visit
ol the th.rd son ot toe Emperor is a prisof
that there is no desire on the pirt ol Ins
government to diminish the cordiality of
luese relations. Tne h jspitahle reception
which n.is been given to lhe Grand Duke is
a proof that on our side we share the wishes
ol that government.
Tne uuexcusablc course oi tne Russian
Minister at Washington renders it necessary
to ask his recall, and to d.cline to longer
receive that functionary as diplomatic
representative. It was impossible, with self
respect or with a just regard to the dignity
of the country, to permit M. Catacpzy to
continue to hold intercourse with this gov
ernment after his personal abuse of govern
ment officials and during his persistent in
terference, through various means, with the
relations between the United States and
other powers. In accordance with my
wishes this government has been relieved of
further intercourse with Mr. Catacazy. and
the management of the affairs of the Imper
ial Legation has passed into the hands of a
gentleman entirely unobjectionable.
With Japan we continue to maintain inti
mate relations. The Cabinet of the Milkado
has, since the last session of Congress,
selected citizens of the United States to serve
in offices of importanco in several depart
mcnts of that fiuvcrnuient. I have mason
to th.nk that this selection is due to an ap
preciation of the disinterestedness of the
policy which the United States have pur.-.;" I
toward Japan.
It is our desire to continue to maintain this
disinterested and just policy with China us
well as Japan. The correspondence trans
mitted herewith shows that there is no dis-po-iti.
n on the part of this Government to
swerve from its established conrse. Promp'e i
by a desire to put an end to the barber i -treatment
of our shipwrecked seamen on the
t 'orean coast I instructed our Minister at
Pekin to endeavor to conelud.- a convent: :i
Rodgers was instructed to aceompan

126 80 during the .year, and by the negotia
tion ot national bonds at a lower rate ol
interest, the interest on the public debt hi I
been so far diminished that, now the sum t I
lie raised for the interest account is nearly
$47,000,000 less than the first day of Man if.
1869. It was highly desirable tl
rapid diminution should take place,
strengthen the credit of the country
convince the citizens oi their entire
t this
inth to
tnd .to
ability
to meot every dollar ol the liahility without
h niki opting them. But in view of the
accomplishment of these desirable ends, ol
the rapid development of the resources of tin
country, its increasing ability to iiuet the
large demands, and the amount already paid,
it is not desirable that the present resources
of the country should continue to lie taxed
in order to continue this rapid payment.
I thrarelore recommend a modification of
both the tariff and internal tux laws. I
recommend that all taxes from the internal
service be abolished, except those collected
fioui spirit .us, vinous and malt liquors in
their various loruis. and from Stamps. In
readjusting the tar ill' I suggest that a carelul
estimate lie made of the amount of surplus
revenue collected under the present laws,
after providing lor the current expenses ol
the Government. The interest account,
and the surplus fund, and the hunine-s sur
plus to be reduced in such a manner i oi
lers the greatest relief to the riatest num
ber. There are many articles not produced
at home, but which enter largely into gi mo
ral consumption, through articles which are
manufactured at home, such as at idieines
compounded. tc, &., from which very lit
tle revenue is derived, but which enter into
general use. All such articles I recom
mend bi placed on the tree li-t. If a fur
ther reduction should prove advisable 1
would tiien recommend that i: ,e made up in
those article a which cen beat bear it without
disturbing home production or reducing the
wages of American labor. I have not en-
tered into figures, because to do so would be
to repeat what will he laid before you in the
report of the secretary of the Treasury.
The present laws for collecting the reve
nues pay collectors of customs small salaries,
but provide for moieties, shares in all seiz
res which at the principal ports of en-1
try practically raise the c itnpcnsation of;
those officials to a large sum. It has always
seemed to me as if the system must at times
work perniciously. It holds out an induce
ment to dishonest men, should such get pos
session of those offices, to be lax in their
scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them
finally to make large seizures. Youi atten
tion is r -spectfully invited to the subject.
The continued fluctuation in the value of
gold ae compared with the national currency
has a most damaging effect on the increase
and development of the country in keeping
up the prices of all articles necessary in
every day life. It fosters a spirit of gam
bling, prejudicial alike to national morals
and the national finances. If the question
em be met us to how to get a fixed value to
our currency, that value constantly and uni
formly approaching par with specie, a very
desirable object will be gained.

The policy .ursutd toward the Inlians has
resulted favorahly so tar as can be judged
from the limited time during which it has
been in operation. Through the exertions
of the various societies oi Christians, to
whom has been entrusted the execution ol
the policy, and the Board of Commissi, ners i
authorized by the law ot April 1. 1869,
many tribes of Indians have len induced to
settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil,

tor the perpetuation and the other for the
destruction of the Union, it niav well be
considered whether it is not now time that
the disabilities imposed by the 14th Amend
ment should be removed; that the amend
ment docs not exclude the ballot, but onlv
iuiposcs the disability to hold office upon
certain classes. When the purity of the
billot is secure, the majiritus are sure to
elect officers retlecting tl e views of the ma
jority. I d not sec the advantage or pro
priety ol excluding men from office" merely
because they were btfore the rebellion ol a
character insufficient t i be eld ted to a posi
tion requiring; them to take oath to support
the constitution and admitting to eligibility
tho-c entertaining precisely the sime views,
but of less standing in their communities.
It may be said that the former violated an
oath while the latter did not. The latter
did not have it in their power to do so. If
t cy h d taki n this oath it cannot be doubt
ed ihey would have broken it, as did the 1 s
mer class. If there are any great criminals
distinguished aliove all others for the part
they took in opposition to the Government,
they might, in tne judgment of Congress, be
excluded from such an amnesty. This sub
ject is submitted for your careful consid-ra-tion.
The condition of the Southern Mates
is unlnppily not such as all true patriotic
citizens would like to see. Social ostracism,
for opinion's sake, personal violence or
threats towards persons entertaining po'iti
eal views opposed to those entertained by
the majority of the old citizens, prevents
immigration and the flow of much nceled
capital into the States lately in rebellion. It
will he a happy condition ol tho eviuntry
when the old Ct tiaen a of the States will take ;
an interest in public affairs, promulgate
ideas honestly entertained, vote for men '
representing their views, and to create the'
same freedom of expression and ballot in
those entertaining different political convic-'
tions.
