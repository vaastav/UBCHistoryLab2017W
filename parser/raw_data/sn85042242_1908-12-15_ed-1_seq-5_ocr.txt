4KEW FOREST RESERVE. II
sj.The setting apart of a forest re-'
serve in North Dakota Is perhaps
more important than is generally ap­
preciate^. North Dakota is a com­
paratively treeless state, and the gov­
ernment in addition' to reserving a
tract where forestry may be practic­
ed, encourages the forestation of oth­
er areas over the state. A Washings
ton correspondent of the Herald at
Grand Forks, in speaking of the new
^reserve in this state, says:
"The new Dakota National Forest
4$onsists of 14,080 acres in the Bad
Lands region. It is located in Bil­
lings county and lies an equal dis­
tance between tie Northern Pacific
.^Y&ilroad on the north' and the Chi­
cago, Milwaukee and St. Paul on the
south. It means that an experiment­
al field for forest planting has been
secured in North Dakota, the least
forested state in the union, haying
only one per cent of tree growth.
The forest service expects to estab­
lish forest nurseries with the hope
that in time to come the area may
he reforested by artificial means.
vThis feature is expected .to prove a
very good object lesson, to the set
tiers, who it is hoped, will in turn
g-|,r |plant windbreaks around their farms.
"The forest is very open and for
rA-ithe moBt part oontains a scattering
stand of western yellow pine ttihber.
r^r«f^Al°ng the creek bed is found ash,
j^box elder, cottohwood, elm and birch,
Cedar breaks are also found on pre
/ycipitous slopes bordering the streams
^^Western yellow pine is the only mer-
V'chantable
species, however, on the
^forest and the average stand per acre
fVjis not over 2,000 feet. The repro
Auction of pine is fairly good wher
'^"'ever mature trees occur, but owing to
the open condition of the forest and
•^|pl the dense growth of grass it is for
^'j^j^the most part unsatisfactory
There is but little timber that
be sold from the forest at the pres
ent time since this area is very isqiat
*£|ed, being surrounded on all sides by
?jjvast plains. Many homesteaders have
the past come to this forest for
|f|!
timber for logs to build their houses
Since the completion of the St. Paul
R-, Billings county-is being rapid
settled and while stock grazing is
f^*9t the present time the most import
^fwit Industry it Is very probable that
farming will become the most im
|#portant Industry within the next few
|&,jrears. It Is very important, tinere
^|fore, that the timber which now re­
mains should be conserved exclusive­
ly tor tbs use of the borne builder.
At the present time there are but
seven homesteaders within the boun-'
daries of the forest, but all of the
odd sections are alienated land, be­
ing owned by the Western Land Se­
curities company. This company has
been sellin portions of their holdings
daring the past few years. Very lit­
tle of the government land within
the boundaries of the forest is suit­
able for farming purposes, since it
Is quite rough and broken and wa~
ter is very scarce. It is the country
outside of the forest which is now be­
ing taken op by settlers.
No sawmill operations have ever
been conducted on this area. When
the Northern pacific railroad was
feeing built a large number of trees
were cut for railroad ties and al­
together with the logs whoch have
tow procured for house building by
Settlers this is the only use which has
bees made of the timber on the for­
est It is understood that the logs
used in the construction of President
Roosevelt's cabin, which now stands
in the state capitol grounds at Bis
xnarcK, N. D., were obtained from the
area now included in the North Da­
kota National forest.

According to the editor of the
Northwestern Miller published at
Minneapolis, the millers of that sec­
tion will not abide the decision of
Secretary Wilson with respect to
bleachjed flour without testing in the
courts the legality of the order and
the authority of the secretary fin­
ally to pass upon the matter. It is
claimed, with respect to the process
of bleaching, that it is harmless, and
that the otfper of the secretary is arb­
itrary and unwise^ /-As to the whole
.matter, it would 'seem that there
ought to be no great difficulty in ar­
riving at a just conclusion. The mil­
ling industry is one of prime import­
ance to the northwest, and it seems
hardly probable that an arbitrary or­
der would be entered with a view
to embarrassing the millers, if such
an order could nqt be sustained by
reason, good judgment a»d consider­
ations of health. On the other hand
if millers are agreed as to the value
of the process, it would seem only
fair that they should have a day in
court to establish their claims. Sure­
ly the millers do not desire to con­
tinue a process that makes a harm­
ful product, and on the other hjand
there could be no desire to cripple
them in the carrying on of their law­
ful business.
The state bar association will meet
on December 28 to prepare recom­
mendations for the appointment of
the two additional judges of the. su­
preme court to be submitted to the
governor. Already there is a large
list of candidate for these import­
ant positions, and the number of
eligibles will be larger after the bar
association meeting. It is not likely
that the association will indorse any
two candidates as preferable to any
other, but a list will, probably, be
submitted of attorneys deemed by the
association to be of supreme-judicial
calibre. No appointments will, prob
ably, be made until after the recom­
mendations of the bar association are
received, although it has been held
that the appointments can be made
at any time now that the result of
the vote on the constitutional amend­
ment has been officially declared. It
settled, however, that the n$xt
regular term of the supreme court,
which will be the one held in Janu­
ary, having been adjourned from the
September term, will see five judges
of the court, sitting ijjt the,hearing of
cases. ,, .J
Irrespective of any other 'consid­
eration but that of friendly sympathy
the people of the state will ergret
to learn of Senator Hansbrough's
serious condition, necessitating an
operation recently performed at Min­
neapolis. The senator has been in
poor health for a year or so, and his
condition was not improved by tie
necessities of a strenuous primary
campaign lasting for a number of
months. He underwent a mastoid
operation while in Washington in the
course of the last session of congress
and an aggravation of the trouble
from which he suffered then has
made a second operation necessary
The operation is at best dangerous
and exhausting and in the senator's
physical condition is more to be fear­
ed. It is, to be hoped that he may
continue to improve and that rest
from his legislative activities may
restore him to complete health'.
The Northwestern Agriculturist
urges farmers to Invest a little extra
money in the proper heating of their
farm houses. A modern heating out­
fit. in the basement bf a farm house
will add comforts that many farmers
have never dreamed of in winter.
No farmer will hesitate to buy ma­
chinery for the farm that will save
labor and the time has come when
he should consider the women folks
of his household if not himself. They
perform the endless drudgery of car­
ing for fires, sweep and duBting on
account of the dust from ashes and,
soot and often times with the best of
stoves the houses are insufficiently
heated. Take on some solid comfort

DEADLY FANATICS WHO KILLED
POLICE UN KANSAS CITY WERE
IN BI&ltfARCK LAST SUMMER.
!The story of the Wiling of several
policemen by "Adam God" and wo­
men of his fanatical party at Kansas
City, brings to "mind that "Adam, ........
God" and his crowd were in this
city
a day or two -last summer, having
come down the river in a houseboat.
The -woman and little girls went about
the icSlty singing hymns in a wlerd way
for what money wias put in the hat
that was industriously passed.
John Sharp, or "Adam God," as he
was known by 'his followers, was^the.
man with 'the flowing beard, and it
was Be who attacked the 'policeman
who wanted to know where they got
the ichlldren, he 'believing them stolen.
This attack was followed up by firing
on the police by both men and wo­
men, the woman with the girls put­
ting four .bullets into an officer, who
permitted himself to be killed rather
than fire on a woman.
One of the Jijtle girls, Lola Pratt,
was killed by the police while trying
to escape in a. -boat the woman with
the gun having fired on the officers.
This tragedy has put an end in
Kansas City to street exhortations
by unknown parties, and it might be
well if the practice was stopped gen­
erally.

Thomas Jefferson's conception. Its
perennial popularity ds due entirely td
the equisite art, delicate feeling and
trresistable htunor with -whioh the
Jelfersons have delineated the jovial
old vagabond hero. There is heart Ih
every line the artist speaks, and
there is (tenderness and love and all

It Is a character such as no actor

have lived nd breathed the very at­
mosphere of the character all their
lives. Thomas Jefferson pours his
own heart and soul and all the genial
attractions *f his own nature into the

with his glorious gilding art that the
results call for all the admiration'and

Falling Water, a masterpiece of hls
