Little Vessel Buffeted and Tossed
and Finally Engulfed by the
Hungry Waves.
PORTLAND, Me.. Dec. 15.— The
schooner Susan P. Thurlow, bound for
Hillsboro, N. 8., from Now York, with
a cargo of plaster rock, went to piec
en Cape Elizabeth at 8 o'clock last
night, and the captain and five of the
crew were lost. One sailor managed
to reach land, and early this morning
he informed the inhabitants of the
wreck. The bodies of the captain and
one sailor were recovered before noon.
The single survivor of the disaster
was E. Reimann. He tells a story of
the wreck as follows: The Thurlow
ci ' nuntered rough weather last night,
and as the storm increased the captain
led to make Portland harbor for
shelter. He was only a few miles out
from Portland when the rudder rope
parted and the vessel became disabled.
The captain and crew tried to repair
the steering gear, but while they were
is engaged the schooner struck on
tli" reef. All three masts were carried
away, one of the top masts striking
the captain and crushing one of his
legs. The captain and mate ordered
the men to jump for their lives. Rei
maruß was caught by a huge wave and
hurled into the sea. He was washed
upon the beach of the island three

foothold and was swept back by the
under tow. He managed to get hold
of one of the spars and clung to it
for a long time, finally being carried
upon the beach by the waves.
He lay on the beach, benumbed and
exhausted for some time. At length he
dragged himself to the hut of a fisher
man where he was cared for until this
morning, when he was brought to this
city and the story of the disaster be
came known.

Ihe crew heartily cheered the emperor.
Emperor William's two eldest sons,
Crown Prince Frederick William and
Prince William P.itel Fred; rick, will
arrive here tomorrow and will accom
pany his majesty as far as Rendbuig.
Emperor William stopped at Ham- 1 ]

ed the town hall and attended a lunch
given in his honor at the Rathskeller.
There were 180 guests present. The
emperor occupied the center table, with

SOLDIERS STOOD PI KM.
Desperate Pic. !i lint. Between Hie
English and Afridis.
SIMLA, Dec. 15.— Further details
from the front regarding the inarch of
Gen. Westmacott's brigade down the
Bara valley show it to have been ac
companied by the most desperate light
ing since Dargai ridge. The enemy,
for the first time in the whole cam
paign, exposed themselves in their ef
forts to cut off the rear guard and
poured in a constant Lee-Metford ar.d
Martini-Henri rifle lire, in replying to
which the British troops exhausted
their pouches "f ammunition.
While the rear guard was worn out
by constant atta( ks and in a difficult
position, the enemy made the coup of
the campaign by an open rush upon it.
The tired soldiers stood firm and a
withering, independent fire swept the
advancing tribesmen, who charged al
most to the bayonet's point. The Afri
dis, decimated, wavered ar.d then re
treated to cover, from which they con
tinued a harassing fusilade until dark.
The action recommenced with the
rising of the moon. In spite of the
vigilance of the scouts, some of the
enemy got between the flanking bodies
and the main column and kept up an
unceasing fire, during which the
Jemadar who was leading Gen. West
macott's horse was killed.
The British troops behaved splendid
ly and inflicted the most severe pun
ishment upon the enemy which the lat
ter has yet sustained, quite 400 men
falling.
MRS. LANGTRY RARRED.
London Society Will Not Accent tlie
Jersey Lily.
NEW YORK. Dec. 15.— A dispatch
to the world from London says: The
report that Mrs. Langtry will be again
taken into society is more than offset
by a resolution that has been passed
by the jockey club which is aimed
directly at her and the Prince of
Wales. The resolution says that "for
the future ladies, other than the wives,
daughters and sisters of the members
of the club, will be admitted at New
market, and on other race courses only
on presentation of voucher, signed by
a member of the club together with the
payment of one pound." Until the- _■ s
olution was passed a member of the
club had a right to pass into the jockey
club inclosures and into the private
stands any woman whom he saw fit.
There has been a general imnression
that Mrs. Langtry has had the free
dom of the track, but this is not true. !
Until the death of her husband two !
months ago, she was kept out of the |
inclosures and private stands of the j
jockey club. It was on the day that '
her husband died and the day that her
horse, Merman, yon one of the great i
racing events of the year at New- i
market, and nearly £100,000 for Mrs. I
Langtrv. that ih- Princ. of Wal*»S co .- j
ducted her into the inclosure and with- ;
in the pale of jockey club society. ;
This act— it has generally been called 1
a breach on the part of his royal holm
ess — made a great stir, ft was com- j
mented upon most unfavorably. Even j
the newspapers deplored it.
This recognition by the Prince of I
Wales gave ris^ to the rumor that Mrs.
Langtry would try to regain her old j
place in society and that in this effort j
she would be backed by th. Prince of I
Wales' influence.
As a matter of fact it is doubtful if }
Mrs. Langtry has any very great d.sire
to get into society again and it is ab
solutely certain that she could not do
so if she tried.

Roots, Of C ._r-<jr_vi ie, .___., who was a
candidate for the ,'po.Ui on of Uniicd
Slates Treasurer, and Who was chair
man of the committee which framed
the call for the monetary convention
held at Indianapolis, claims that sev
eral of the suggestions in President Mc-
Kinley's message, and Secretary Gage's
recommendations to congress en» the
currency and banking questions, were
embodied as early a_ December, 1893,
in an article wiitten by him, and much
of it was appioved by Secretary Sher
man.
"The endless chain would be a thing
of the past, with a full treasury, es
pecially if the greenback, were re-is
sued only in exchange for gold. As to
the national banks, if a fifty year bond I
at 2 p^r cent, were issued, as the La. is J
of banking circulation, and the barks !
tti ! to is_ue to the par value of j
their bonds, take the tix off circulation
at '! pi rmit the banks of a capital of
§25,000 to organize, it would accelerate
t3 • : imat'on of banks throughout the
ci untry and we would not hear of the
banking question for years to co ■•. -."
Mr. Hoots further suggests, that sil
ver be made the basis of the national
: g circulation instead of United
States bonds and at its market value;
that the bank be permitted to issue 90
per cent in not.s against the silver de
_, and that 10 per cent be held to
proti ct the notes so issued from the de
cline in silver, and that a tax of 1 per
cent annually be levied on the banks to
protect the issue, and that the govern
ment guarantee the notes and pay the
banks 2 per cent per annum interest for
the silver so deposited.
The suggestion have been submitted
by -Air. Hoots to H. M. Hanna, chair
man of the executive committee
man of the executive committee of the
monetary conference and they will be
presented to the committee on banking j
in the house.

STEAMER WRECKED.
laoss of .lie Cleveland Reported by
Her Captain.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 15.— The
Merchants Exchange has received a
teli gram from Nanaimo in which the
captain of the missing steamer Cleve
land says that his vessel has been
wit ckid on the coast of Vancouver
island. No other details are given.
The Cleveland left here for Seattle
about ten days ago and it is known
that she encountered fierce gales. She
carried a crew of thirty men and about i
twelve passengers. '1 he Cleveland was
a biige iron steamer and had a series
of misfortunes. She is owned by
Charles Nelson and was commandea
by Capt. C. F. Hall. It is supposed
the steamer's machinery became dis
abled, and that she was blown out of
her course while under sail.
SAFE TO SAIL THE LAKES.

CHICAGO, Deo. 15— Not a single pas
senger was lost by accident dining th .•
season of navigation on tho great lakes
just closed, and but one jumped over
board.
Sixty-eight sailors lost their lives, i
This is about the average for the past
two seasons. The only craft in dis
aster was the Idaho, lost en Lake Eric,
when nineteen lives were sacrificed.
The remainder of the sixty-eight were
lost one at a time from accident. Fall
ing into the hold caused the death of
a dozen. Forty-six were drowned and
three committi d suicide.
The season was remarkable for the
large number of narrow escapes of
crews from wrecked vessels, but the
life-saving crews everywhere made

ARMOUR POIRIN'G IN .Y.iK.VT ON
THE HEAD OF THE Dl L.L
CLIQUE.
CHANGE FOR FIREWORKS
IS SCARCELY SO BRIGHT NOW AS IT
WAS A FEW DAYS
AGO.
SQUEEZE IS GOING OVER TO HAY.
Wheat Laid Out for Shipment to
Other Points Attracted by the
Chlenpro Corner.
CHICAGO, Dec. 15.— There are just
sev< nteen days left to make or unmake
the December wheat deal. The chances
for fireworks and old-time corner pri
ces are scarcely so bright as they were
seme time ago. Leiter is learning some
thing about the possibilities of Chicago
as a receiving market and about the
resources of Armour. Earlier in the
season Leiter gave Armour, who came
lack from Europe a "dollar wheat"
bull, some points on how to act
promptly, but in tho last two days the
1. cal stock of wheat has been increas
ed by 1,350,000 bushels. Such a move
ment is simply phenomenal and repre
sents a part of the energetic campaign
made by Armour and Weare. The last
cargoes of an abnormal Duluth-Chi
cago movement, aggregating 2.G45.000
bushels, are arriving. The bulk of this
has been contract wheat brought down
for the special benefit or the market
made by .Mr. Leiter. It has been vari
ously disposed of. Part of It has gone
into public- elevators and part into pri
vate houses.
Armour knows just how much con
tract win at is here. Leiter would give
a snug sum for exact information as
to how much of the Chicago stock has
come hero to till short sales to him
and how much is here to be dumped
out on December advances, such as
those of last Friday and last Monday.
The chance of pyrotechnics is in the
speculative market for December
wheat. The real battle is in the cash
property. Leiter has been holding a
large assortment of speculative cards
and has been playing them rapidly. He
has brought the deal up from July to
September, and from September to
December, but only recently has been
li!. -ling prices to a point to bring
whi at from all directions. This is the
situation which promises to give Ar
mour an opportunity to recoup any ac
tual losses in his operations and some
of liis consequential losses for not hav
ing taken up the bull side of tlie mar
ket when he came from Europe and
held to it aggressively since. Leiter
has disclaimed any intention to corner
wheat. Armour lias disclaimed doing
anything but a warehouseman's busi
ness. I.' iter's operations, and more
particularly his announc intents of
plans t<> move the entire Chicago stock
of wheat out of tlie country, have put
wheat to $1.00, and by forcing Chicago
out ef line with other markets have
started an avalanche of wheat to Chi
cago. As an elevator man, Armour's
opportunity lies in the accumulation at
Chicago of a stock of wheat such as
did not seem possible at the beginning
cf the season.
CHRONIC CORNER.
The demand and supply prospect at
the opening of the wheat seas >n wis
that Cnicago would get but little
wheat. By grace of a chronic cone r,
recently reaching more acute stages
at or above ?1 a bushel, the chanc s
are good foi a local stock of wlv j at of
10,000.000 bushels by the end of De
cember. What !s to all intents ar.d
purposes a Chicago corner is attract
ing te this market wheat < riginally laid
by for milling, rot only in the North
west, but in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana
I and as far east as Buffalo. If Armour
I can control the ebb of this tide of
i wheat to any extent there is a great
opportunity for recouping losses,
actual or theoretical.
During tho last few days the trad ■
generally has been working around to
a theory something like this:
Aimour and Leiter have cross 'I
weapons and recognized their respec
tive points of advantage and streneth.
Leiter will handle the December deal
as carefully as possible and realize just
as much profit by sabs as the mar
ket will stand. He will then take some
cash wheat on delivery, but practically
leave the cash situation to Armour.
He can ge; over to May with better
prospects than ho wont over into
Si ptember or over into December.
Armour will then lie left with Chi
] cago in control of the oash situati in
j and with foreign demand and domes
| tic requirements as a result of millers
' selling their stocks on the high Chi
cago premiums. This would furnish a
! basis for advancing prices and give
I Aimour an opportunity for merchan
dising wheat on a . cale which was not
! thought possible at the beginning cf
t i j • - crop yi ar.
William T. Baker, president of tho
board of trade, says with referene.- to
tho unusual conditions in wh.at:
"Cash wheat is at a premium over
| future delivery here and in all parts
lof the world because more of it has
been sold than can be delivered.
j Wheat is scarce all over the world.
: Not enough was grown last year to
supply tho demand. America now has
the opportunity to make its own price
i for wheat. It has in the past be.n
| considered by many to be a blessing j
j for us to supply th" world with cheap
; wheat, even though our own farmers
i could hardly make both ends me t on
tho cost of production. Now, perhaps.
in view of the prosperity which has
come to this nation from higher prices,
there will be l e ss sympathy for those
operating to depress grain values be
low the values normally adjusted by
demand and supply. Tn tho pr.st un
limited auantities of wheat have 1 p.
sold on the market and resold with no j
demand for its delivery. Now. how- i
ever, the wheat is wanted so badly by |
consumers that contracts cabins; fori
delivery can stand for no 'wind - wheat, j
We shall probably se^ tha same ti__h_ j
conditions in May wheat uh-ti May \
comes as wo now sop in December
wheat T think that th's country al- j
ready has exported much of the wheat
which it will soon need for its own
consumption and that the full scarcity
Is not by any means yet appreciated."
