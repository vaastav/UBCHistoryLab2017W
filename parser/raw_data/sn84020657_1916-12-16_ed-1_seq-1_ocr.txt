PARIS. Dec. 16.?As his last ac
before assuming the chief command
of the French army on the wcsterr
front. General Neville today smash
ed the German line east of the
Meuse river along a front of six
miles and the French positions arc
now within a short .distance, ol
where the Germans stood at the out
set of the great Verdun drive.
Nine thousand prisoners and
eighty cannon were captured in the
drive of Gen. Neville and the Ger
mans were apparently surprised at
so sudden an attach.
?en. Neville, since the fait- of
Forts Vaux and Douamont has been
quietly preparing to push his ad
vantages by an attack on a larger
scale. Men and guns had been
assembled and shells piled and ev
erything put in readiness for the
moment when the Geenral should
see his opportunity. Then the blow
fell like a thunderbolt. Terrific ar
tillery preparations flattened the Ger
man defenses. Then the guns were
elevated and threw a curtain of fire
behind which the infantry from ev
ery trench from Pepper Hill to be
yond Damlop dashed forward on the
enemy, who were still stunned by
the bombardment.
One after another. Vaucherauville
and Louvenmont villages. Chambreest
farm and Haramount and Besom and
Vaux works fell without the defend
ers having time to carry away either
guns or material and prisoners be
gan to stream steadily rearward to
the pens prepared for their recep
tion.
The weather, according to hither,
to accepted notions, was all against
the offensive. It was wet and misty
and the French officers believe that
this fact led the Germans to miscal
culate the probability for an at
tack.
KAISER TALKS TO TROOPS.
Amsterdam. Dec. 16.?The Co
logne Gazette gives an account of
the Kaiser's recent visit and speech
to his soldiers in Alsace and Lor
raine. The Kaiser said the irony
of fate permitted grain purchased
by England in Rumania to fall into
German hands, adding "English paid
for it. but we eat it."
The dispatch describes how the
troops were drawn up in parade or
der. a number of aeroplanes beiig
in readiness to ward off a possible
air attack. The Kaiser was ac
companied by the Crown Prince
and General Von Guendell. com
mander of the army. After inspect
ing the troops the Kaiser made a
speech thanking them for protect
ing the region. "The steadfastness
of the troops in the west," he said,
"had made it possible to deal de
structive blows in the east." He
spoke in words "most wrathful in
contempt of that people in the j
east which had thought to stick a
dagger in the back of our ally."

MORE CONTROL
SHOULD GO TO
LEGISLATURE
Congress Is Asked tc
Grant More Power to
Legislative Body
of Territory.
PEOPLE KNOW RIGHTS
Formation of Militia in
Alaska is One of
Points Made
by Governor.
In his annual report to the Secre
tary of the Interior, Gov. J. F. A
strong discusses the Alaska Legisla
uro, Alaska Pioneer's Home, mail
lervice and several other interest
ng subjects. Several emphatic boostr
or Juneau are given. In commenting
m the Territorial Legislature, Gov,
strong says the Alaska Legislature
vas created by an act of Congress
ipproved August 14, 1912, and the
Irat session was held in March.
913. The Legislature meets bleu
lially and the next session will con
?ene 0n the first Monday In March.
Jli. The legislature is vested with
mhed power, in fact, the llmita
ions are such as to make its legls
ativtf powers partake more of shad
v 'ban of substance. While Con
,ress extended to the legislature
he authority to "alter, amend, mod
W ? repeal Iav;s In force in Al
ska. such authority naturally does
ot extend to the customs, internal
evenue. the primary disposition of
he soil, postal, or other general
xw$ ?f the United States; but such
urey local or Territorial matters
s the game and fish, and laws re
tting to fur-bearing animals of the
ulted States, applicable to Alaska
r to the laws of the United States
roviding for taxes on business and
*ade, or to the establishment and
laintenance of schools, are under
I# exclusive control of Congress,
urther. the Territory Is prohibited
?om creating any bonded indehted
ess, and so are the municipalities;
te Territory may not levy for Tec
torial purposes a tax in excess of
per cent in any one year, upon
te assessed valuation of the prop
rty therein. Municipalities are lim
ed to 2 per cent, per annum. The
aove are some of the limitations
tat should be removed and the
>wers of the Legislature extended
? as to provide Alaska with "the
til form of Territorial government."
htc.i was granted to every Ter"i-1
,py by Congress, Ala;ka excepted,
i his message to Congress, in De-'
'niber, 191J, President Wilson rec-1
amended that the full form of Ter
torial government be so extended.1
it no affirmative action in this
'spect has been taken, although
Us with that object in view have
3Cii introduced in Congress
An enlargement of the powers of
10 CB's'afure should be welcomed
T Congress. If the Alaska Legisla
ire were permitted to legislate up
,i?.. ?att0/8 bearing an intimate
lation to the Territory and, there-1
re. not general. Congress would be !
ilieved from legislation covering
atters of purely local concern. It
to be presumed, therefore, that
' , '^ps'a'ion thus enacted would
| better adapted to the immediate:
-eds of the Territory, if Alaska!
receive the full measure of
ogress and growth to which it is
-rly entitled by reason of Its com
anding pre-eminence In the matter
great natural resources, a liberal
-ension ot local self-government Is,
iperative. As at present constl-1
ted. Congress and the Territorial
glslature can not co-operate In a
tlsfactory manner, and conflict at
roes will be inevitable. It is not!
?ked that Congress waive its right
control those subjects of legisla
jn that are national, and not local
their scope, and arguments should
?t be necessary in support of the
;rrltory s right to control all its
cal.4a?alrs. if the mil form or
*rrl tonal government were accord
to Alaska, no doubt. the legisla
re would make mistakes; this Is
bo expected of any legislative
dy. but the mistakes would be
ose of the direct representatives
the people of Alaska, and those
istakes would be remedied lit time
This statement is made in the full"
lief that the people of Alaska may
1 fully trusted with the government
themselves. It is hoped and ex
ceed that Alaska will one day be-!
me a State, or perhaps several
ates may be carved out of the
.'rrltory as at present constituted
rt in my opinion the time for State
od has not arrived, and until such

LLEWELYN IRON
WORKS GOES UP IN
LOS ANGELES FIRE
Two Explosions Starts
Fire Which Ends in
Destruction of
Big Plant.
POLICE ARE ON CLUES
Conflagaration Resulted
: Several Hours After
David Caplin Is
Found Guilty.
LOS .ANGELES, Dec. 16.?Early
j this morning the Llewelyn Iron
Works was destroyed by fire, which
was caused as the result of two
mysterious explosions.
One explosion occurred in one
part of the big plant and the em
ployees had hardly recovered from
the shock when another explosion
occurred 100 yards distant from
the first. Fire immediately broke
out and spread with lightning ra
ipidity.
Police arrived on the scene short
ly after the explosions, a riot call
having been sent in, and a quick
investigation was made before the
flames spoke the doom of the iron
works. While the fire was raging
sparks ignited the Lack Manufactur
ing company and that plant suffer
ed serious damage.
The loss to the Llewelyn Iron
Works is estimated at $500,000
and the forty workmen who were
on night duty, all had narrow es
capes.
Late this afternoon the police an
nounced that they believed that the
explosions were caused by an old
ring of the dynamiters who operat
ed here years ago. Six years, on
next Christmas, the iron works was
damaged by a bomb which was
planted by McManigal, the self-con
fessed dynamiter. The police be
lieve that either dynamite or nitro
glycerine was used today.
CAPLIN FOUND GUILTY.
One peculiar incident of the ex
plosion and fire today was that
they occurred a few hours after Da
vid Caplin was found guilty of man
slaughter for complicity in the ex
plosion which wrecked the Los An
geles Times when twenty employees
were killed. Caplin was tried once
before but the jury disagreed. He
will be sentenced next Monday.
