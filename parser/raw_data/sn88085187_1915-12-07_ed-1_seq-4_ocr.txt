Message Is One Western Washington Will Approve and Applaud
On the whole, the message which President Wilson today read to the assembled houses of congress
Will please the progressive people of western Washington. The paragraphs dealing with preparedness, tin
•abject of perhaps paramount interest, are certainly far from militaristic or jingoistic. They are no
Stronger than advance press reports had intimated. Certainly \vp of the freedom-loving west will agree
with the president when he says "At least so much by way of preparation for defense seems to me to be
absolutely imperative now. We cannot do less." Indeed, the country probably will be bitter pleased il
congress takes considerably more advanced ground on the question of national defense than does he.
One disappointing feature of the message, in this regard, is that no mention is made of the question
of the government's manufacturing its own munitions of war and building its own battleships.
The address opens with an admirable statement of America's reasons for its position of neutrality.
It turns next to our relations with Houth and Central America. Wilson seizes the opportunity to set
forth an altered Monroe doctrine in which "there is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards but,
Instead, a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors, in the in
terest of all America, north and south.
As to Mexico, the president stands by his creod. He says, "We now hopefully await the re-birtli
of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from"am
outside quarter in the radical but necessary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will imt
coerce her; and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all America that we sed<
no political suzerainty or selfish control." <
After dealing with the subject of military preparedness, the president turns to the highly important
question of a merchant marine, He advises the immediate establishment of a government-owned fleet

Henry and Noah
Speaking of the ridicule of Ford's peace voyage, his side-partner, Mr. B^yan, says that "if any peo
ple on Noah's ark had been making money out of the flood, they would probably have ridiculed Noah for
Sending out the dove."
Not probably, but certainly, Mr. Bryan. We haven't complete reports on what took place on that ark.
Very likely, some fellow aboard, who had enjoyed a monopoly in water cress, rice, water lilies, or such,
admired that rainfall and hooted the idea that 40 days and nights was enough of it. There were in that
boat Noah, Shorn, Ham, Japheth and their wives. \t would be another miracle of high class if, in that
crowd of eight there wasn't one who kicked on anything tending to break up the pleasant life of security,
comfort and ease, after an hundred and fifty days of it.
With this proposition established as premises, it is legitimate to conclude that Noah really was ridi
culed, since he was 600 years old and it. was reasonably safe to do it, for it will be remembered that Noah,
desiring a port, maybe desiring peace for family reasons, first sent forth a raven, which was lost, and then
a dove, both failing to find what Noah was after. Ke undoubtedly got ridiculed for sending out for land
when there was nothing but water, just as Ford is getting it for sending out for peace when there's noth
ing but war. I
Then, what did Noah do! Say, what did Noah do then? Why, he gave the flood a chance to subside
somewhat, sent out the dove again and got an olive twig, which indicated that there was some show for a
safe landing. This gave him tlie laugh on Shem or Ham, or Mrs. Sheni or Mrs. Ham, or more likely Mrs.
Noah, who had made fun over his losing that raven. i
The similarity between the voyages of Noah's ark and Henry's Oscar is striking, up to the present,
and Mr. Bryan's reference to the matter is a neat hit
Romance In Commonplace Lives
We are all accustomed to look upon ourselves as eommonplaise. We are apt to see only dullness in
our neighbors'lives. We mourn because we thing romance is confined to fiction or the stage. And we
even go to the movies to seek the romance which we miss at home.
But where did the story, the play, and the film udventure come from, if not from real life?
QUESTIONS THEY WRITE TO I -«-««- .—
CYNTHIA GREY--HER ANSWERS | ZspT^JTJ^
Dear Miss Cray: lam a widow, alone. I have a good posi
tion —1 get $7 a week and board myself. That Bounds easy, but
I am also supporting my children. I pay $5 a week for their
board, and out of the remaining $2 I am clothing them and m>
self, also feeding myself.
lam well, thank Ood, or I couldn't stand it. Now what I
want to know is this —should I struggle on until "something"
happens, or shall I find homes for my babies. It breaks my
heart to see Christmas coming on, and—oh well, what's the use?
I went to a picture show a short time ago and it Is said "what Is
the reward of right living?" The answer waa "untainted moth
erhood."
Now I gave my babies this, and they are all the world to
me. I cuddled and loved them just as all mothers do, and now I
must give them away.
Any old squaw in the United States can keep her babies.
Uncle Sam sees to it that she can, but we American mothers
mast grit our teeth and smother back the heart-breaks and give
our babies away.
If I could have the dearest wish of my heart, do you know
what it would be? —work where I could send my children to
■ehool, and lie able to get home in time to fly a nice supper for
them when they returned.
A terribly er pensive hope, isn't it? Yet I can't have it. I
must find homes for them. Then, supposing I do, what will be
come of me? I surely need advice. Shall I struggle .on, or try
tc* find them homes? Tell me— MOTHER.
A.—You certainly are in need of aid and encouragement, you
poor, discouraged woman- lint cheer up! IHd yon never hear of the

Ind- you. Don't look nn the dark Hide. There la always some aid for
a worthy mother. If you <!•> not succeed In getting a pension, please
write me again, dear, and I will have some further advice.
Dear Miss Orey: You give such sensible advice to others,
will you please tell me what to do? lam staying at my father's
(he is a widower), and keep ho use for him and one boarder.
I have a baby of about six months. My husband works away
from home and comes home only once in two or three weeks,
to spend Sunday.
Do you think I should pay board? Ido all the housework.
I have to care for my baby, too.
I have also been reading "Confessions of a Wife," but un
fortunately did not get tha first of it. 1 am very much Inter
ested and would like to get it all. Can you tell me where I could
get it or th? first of It? I certainly do not blame Margie for not
wanting Mrs. Waverly to live with her- 8. A. R-

otherwise. Ido not believe he expect** an] thing more from yon.

pnlilished in book form, although they undoubtedly will be when the

TBI TAOOMA TIMIA
of freight earners, the need for which Secretary McAdoo, in a special article written for this paper, so
strikingly set forth a few days ago.
Discussing the revenue situation. President Wilson points out that $112,000,000 of additional income
will be needed by the goveninient for the coming year. He recommends that all the present taxes be
continued and the added sum be provided by one or more of several easy methods.
One of the striking passages in his message is his declaration against the proposal for raising any of
this money by the sale of bonds. "It seems to me a clear distate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance," says he, "that in what we are now, I hope, to undertake we should pay as we go. The people
of the country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to carry, and to know from
the outset, now. The new bills should be paid by internal taxation."
Suggestions which ho advances along this line are for increasing the income tax rates, and levying
taxes on gasoline, automobiles, bank checks and fabricated iron and steel.
One of the strongest passages inihe whole message is directed against the "hyphenated" citizens of
this nation who have been plotting to destroy our industries, to involve the national neutrality and to
pry into national secrets for the benefit of European governments. The president rightfully urges that
laws be passed making it possible to punish such wrong-doers with deserved severity.
Inline with other lessons taught by the great war are the concluding section of the message, which
propose a study to lead to the complete co-ordination of our industrial and transportation systems for the
national defense.
On the whole it is a message, not only TO you and me, but FOR you and me to congress. And that is
what a president's annual address should be. X

"It looks aa though mother
would have to come to us," said
Dick yesterday morning.
"Now, Dick, I simply cannot
have your mother with me; you
know we do not get along to
gether at all; we do not think or
act along the same lines. Why
can't she stay at the hotel? She
will be much happier there. I
will be glad indeed to help pay
I—r board If her income is not
large enough to let her stay
there."
"Oh, she will have enough to
live on. Mollte told me this
inornlng that besides buying the
house of her fox twenty thousand
dollnrs, Chadwick waa going to
settle twenty more on her
mother."
"How perfectly lovely- Aren't
you ashamed now, Dick, at all you
have said about him?"
"A little," owned Dick, "but
handing compliments to Chadwick
Is not getting us any nearer to
what we shall do with mother. Of
course, that silly idea that she Is
going to travel-with them is out
of the question and there is only
us."
I could not help thinking how
gladly we had welcomed Aunt
Mary and how happy we had been
with her, and how much happier
she had been than Mother Waver
ly was. I don't believe, little
book, that every one owes It to
older people to put up with their
ways and abide by their opin
ions always. Mother Waverly
will never do anything we want
her to do unless she wants to do
It. She does not care for the;
theater, but instead of slaying
quietly at home and letting Mol
lie go occasionally, she Insists
that she shall stay at home with
her and play cards, which Mollie
detests.
I will say this for Mollie, that
she most always gives in to her
mother and she has done this so
often that If Mother Waverly was
to go with them on their wedding
trip she would probably spoil not
only their whole trip but their
whole lives to come.
Sometimes, little book, I think
we make too much of duty and
self-sacrifice. Mother Waverly had
her courtship and her honeymoon,
and, I have often heard her tell
how perfect it was. While dad
lived she was always very selfish.
She always Insisted on being
first; she did not give up even
for her children. Now it is time,
for her to "let the others have
an inning," as Dick would say.
But she still thinks her children
must give in to and lor her.
"Mother does not think* It looks
well for her to board at a hotel
when her son lives in the same
town," continued Dick.
I fairly snorted. "Now, Dick, If
