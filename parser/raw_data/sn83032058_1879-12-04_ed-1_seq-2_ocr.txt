The legislative bribery trial has been
quashed, on account of a trick of radical
hatching—they managed to nave one
grand juror, out of tbe '24, not to be
sworn, and this irregularity led to the
quashing of the indictments, and the
radical corruptors of our state legisla
ture go free for the present.
These rascals have already been prov
en guilty by a legislative committee and
if tbe trial had not been defeated by this
trick, Keinble and his assistant radical
corruption gang which attempted to fas
ten 4 millions upon the state, would
have been sent to state prison.
The readers of the Ripoexek will re

JJMexico would die of inanition if it

News has been received by the steams

al Jeaes Ramirez has pronounced, and
some of his forces hare been at liosario,
Concordia, Copala, about sixty miles
from MazatiaD, and near tbe lines of
Tepicand Binaloa. Another small force
has pronounced at Cosala, |in the State
of Sinalca. The insurgents have also
pronounced at Lapaz. About two hun
dred and fifty men took possession of
the town, and after getting possession
of all arms left for the interior.
Nothing is Bafo any more under radi
cal hands. They have for IS years stol
en and rniaappropriated the public
monies, stolen the revenues and when a
rascal was sentenced he got out by an
abuse of the pardoning power. They
have used the army and the sword for
the basest purposes and to maintain car
pet-bagism, carry elections and an - est
voters, and have stolen the presiden
cy.
Now they enter the gtaud jury room
to defeat justice by an irregularity, so
that indictments against the corruptors
of our state legislature may escape pun
ishment.

The legislative commi'tee to prsoecute

1 The agent in charge of the White

to the Interior 1 *epartment that the
Chippewa Indians have made a very
gratifying success of the experiment of
raising sorghum in that part of the
country. Twenty-live acres upon which
the experiment wa# tried last season
yielded 100 gallons of svup per acre.
The Chippewa* are much pleased with
the industry, and next year will plant
•J9O teres with aorghnm. The agent re
porta that it will grow and ripen upon
any lands capable of producing corn.
The Chippewaa, about one thousand in
number, who were all wild ludians ten
years ago, have also this season raised
abundant crops of grain and vegetables,
and are reported to be happy and con

The lIuroXTKB desires to announce to
the radical press that thee may soon
have another southern "outrage" to
howl over, which will l>o when Klita
Pinkston—Sherman's Kiiia—is hung for
murdering her husband. Kiiia was of
great service in the presidential steal,
and in the hands of John Sherman
played oil bruised and half dead, under
perjury, to get up a fictitious outrage.
Now that Kiiia has murdered her bus*
band, neither Sherman nor the radical
press can see a '■southern outrage" there.
When Kiiia'a trial comes off let the rad
leaders do like in Penn'a, tamper with
tlie grand jury. and thus have the indict
ment against their dear sister Kiiia
quashed. There is hope for Kiiia yet.
llalstead of the Cincinnati l v.
the most intluential republican paper in
Ohio, looks shy at the Grant movement.
In his paper he deals it the following
black eye:
We got aloug very well without Grant
while he was going arouud the world,
and we do not need him now. There
are 1,000,000 citiiens of the United
States as capable as he of being a good
President for the fouryoais succeeding
Hayes. Any capable Justice of the
Peace is equal to tlie Chief Magistracy.
The American people must not be per
mitted to make asses of themselves
about the noed of rulers. We do not
require anybody to rule over us. We
are Republicans and irule] ourselves.
The President isn't a ruler.
Alex. 11. Stephens deniee that he has
expressed himself in favor of Grant. In
a letter to the Augusta Chronicle he is
in accord with the erratic Dr. Felton, or
that he contemplates publishing a simi
lar manifesto. He also denies saving to
a reporter of the Washington star that
"if democratic dimensions in New York
continue our only hope of success is des
troyed, and the South wi|l look out for
herself," or that "the South to-day pre
fers Grant as dictator to Sherman or
Conklingas President," or that "among
the Southern soldiery there is the great
est respect and reverence for Grant, and
that Lhepsopls of the South would sup*
port him in preference to any other man
of the republican party." Mr. Stephens
says that the telegrams and interviews
ascribing these expressions to him are
groundless fabrications from beginning
to end, and he trusts "that the people of
Georgia who hare any regard for tbe
truth will not bo misled as to my say
ings or doings by giving credence to any
such anonymous representations of my
utterances."
The heathen Japs have a highfalutin
opinion of Grant, which is not less than
the opinion of the jobbers and plunder*
ers here, from whom they evidently re~
ceived their knowledge of the Gener
al.
In anticipation of the visit of General
Grant to Jeddo there appeared a sketch
of his life in Japanese, in which the
author, after speaking with enthusiasm
of the achievements of Gorantu, as he
calls the General, addresses his readers
in the following words"Whether we
consider the fox amoDg leasts, or the
pho. nix among birds, we find that even
when endowed with unusual abilities
the inte.'hgence of these is not equal to
that of stupid Old women or doltish boys.
But men are able, if Uiey chose, to culti
vate their talents; and tifir >® ft man
who has cultivated his great natural
abilities, is rich in thought, is admirmb.'O
in bis movements, is as unfathomable
as heaven and earth, and with whom
neither the fox nor the pbu-nix is for a
moment to be compared. Sach a one is
General Grant, whose intelligence is
commanding to a degree, and whose
business capacities are truly grand."
Well, wc are to have light at last. And
now it is announced that Edison promi
ses to show his electric light perfected
on Christmas evo, at Menlospark, N. J.
He will illuminate all the buildings in
the modest little hamlet in which he
lives and works. To that end wires
have been run from liouae to house, and
connected thence with his laboratory.
The illumination will be given by means
of what might be railed electric jets,
each jet of 10-candlo power, which is
the measurement of electric intensity;
that is to Bay the extraordinary phe
nomenon may be seen, on Christmas
day in Menlo-park, of electric lights
toned down to the intensity of gas jets.
In a few days Edison will begin the
task of affixing the jets so-called, from
thejgas burners in the Beveral houses,
instead of running wires that are to
transmit the current through gas pipes,
as it is his intention to do shortlv, in
this city. For this occasion ho will lay
wires along the pipes. "I shall send in
vitations far and wide," says Edison,
"in order that all may see that what has
considered as visionary and impos
sible, ha® I**" aecompllslwfd. Let gas
companies reduce their prha, and then
reduce it again, for it la well known
they can still do this and make money,
and I can undersell them and make a
largo profit.

Mli. IIA IX*' MESSAGE.
On Tuesday last President t llaycs I
sent his third annual message to con*;
press, and as it is a lengthy document
we cannot publish it, and so notice the
following from the Harrisbnrg l'i •'
in reference to it: It contains nothing
of a remarkable nature except an itera
tion of the civil service reform recom*
mendation made by Mr. Hayes in 1577
which so disgusted his party that it re
fused to sustain the administration at
the elections of that year. The fine
hand of John Sherman is plainly visible
in tliis part of the message. Now that
the elections are over and the depart
ment clerks will not be required to con
tribute tojtho republican corruption fund
for six months to come lie thinks it a
good time to manufacture a little capita!
for the administration and for himself
as the administration candidate fur the
succession. With this view he has per
suaded his chief to drop the stalwarts
once more and to return to a repetition
of his mummery in regard to the civil
service. On this point, however, the
message carefully distinguishes between
the heads of departments and their sub
ordinates so as not to subject Mr. Sher
man and his associates in the cabinet,
or Mr. Hayes himself, to criticism or
ridicule for their meddlesome interfer
ence in recent political campaigns. It
is insisted that the president and his of
ficial advisers may with eminent propri
ety explain their policy before the peo
ple, but that it is the duty of those in
subordinate places in the civil service
"to obey tbe legal Instructions of those
upon whotn that authority is devolved
and their best public service consists in
the discharge of their functions irre
spective of partisan politics." In other
words, while the president and his cabi
net may properly travel over the coun
try on electioneering tours and engage
in partisan politics to the top of their
bent, chiefs of bureaus and. department
clerks must not meddle in political mat
fers but give all their time and attention
to their official duties. The message al-;
so declares that "in whatever aspect
considered, the practice of making levies
for party purposes U]>on the salaries of
officers is highly demoralizing to the
public service aud discreditable to the
country." Now, the fact is, as Mr.
Hayes and Mr.bherman very well know,
that if the members of the cabinet and
the president himself did not set the ox
ample their subordinates would not
trouble themselves abont partisan poli
tics ; that if the high officials of the ad
ministration did not permit levies to be
made upon their underlings for party
purposes and thus countenance and en
courage that practice there would soon
bean end of this system of collecting
electioneering funds from the subordi
nates in the departments. It is only
necessary for Mr. Hayes to put his foot
on the evils of which he complains if he
would crush them out. Hut the course
pursued by his cabinet, notably by the
secretary of the treasury, is not calcu
lated to inspire any very profound faith
in his sincerity. It is notorious that
subordinates in the departments aud of
ficers of the revenue have been removed
because they did not belong to the ad
ministration party or failed to perceive
the eminent fitness of John Sherman for
the presidency. Nevertheless, it will
be well for congress to take Mr. Hayes
at'his word and send to him such legis
lation for his approval as will not mere
ly authorize but require the executive
and heads of departments to cause their
subordinates to abstain from such par
ticipation in partisan politics as inter
feres in any way with the proper dis
charge (J their oflieial duties or requires
ttiem to share their salaries with tlio
managers of political campaigns. The
message congratulates congress on the
success of resumption, but falls into a
contradiction when it reecommends the
retirement of the legal tender notes; for
if rcdpmptjpn is already a success, in
spite of the fa iX that the whole of the
$1540,000,000 of legal tenders repeln un
redeemed, where is the necessity for the
retirement of the legal tenders',' Mr.
Hayes could not have more maladroitly
admitted that resumption is not yet an
assured fiif-i 4t?d will not ho until the le
gal lenders urn finally redeemed at the
treasury. On other subjects the message
is very tame and unsuggeslivo. hcarcu
lv a thread of the bloody shirt appears
in its texture. An allusion is made to
the importance of free elections, and a
platitude about public opinion overrid
ing "all political prejudices and all sec
tional and state attachments in dernand-
I tug that all ovci our wide leritorr lite
name und character of citir.cn of the
t'nitcd Stairs shall mean one and the
same thing," probably in intended as a
bint to congress to require Massachu
setts and Rhode I -land to treat natural
laod eltlsena of tins United States at
least as well as Wisconsin and Minne
aota treat unnaturalited foreigners. A*
a whole the message is just what might
have been cipeeled from an Ohio man
who holds an office to which he was not
eluctesl prompted by another Ohio man
who hopes to to elected to an office
which he fears the people are unwilling
to confer upou hitu,

THE COMPOSITION OF THE '
GRAND JURY.
Harrisburg. Nov. 2S.—ln the Lcgiila-,
live bribery casts to day. the Common
wealth was reinforced by Cel. Gowen,
President of the Philadelphia 0c Heading
Railroad Company, who made a strong
argument against the contradiction of the 1
Record of the Court.
Motiou to Quash.
After the caso against A. \Y. Leisen
ring of Muucb Chunk, charged with cor
rupt solicitation of members of the Legis
lature had been callod, General Albright
moved to quash tho indictment on the
same grounds on which that against
ex-Reprcfentativo Salter was quashed.
The defense then offered to submit some
evidence heretofore offered to how that
the Urand Jury was illegally constituted,
when the Commonwealth objected to its
reception.
Argument of tho Prosecution.
Judge Black submitted the following,
which wui signed by attorneys for tho
Commonwealth :
Fu ht—The facts asserted by the defsnd
ant HI reasons for quashing the indictment
are all of them extrinsic to the record, and
it is a well settled rule of the common law,
adopted in Pennsylvania by the highest
judicial authorities of the State, that facts
not apparent in the body of the indictment
or tho caption thereof cannot be produced
in any form of proof to sustain such a mo
tion at this.
Second— This indictment nnd all previ*
ous proceedings which load to it are con
cltillvely proved by the record to havo
been perfectly free from any defect in
form or substance, for it was found by a
Grand Jury of twenty-three persons, reg
ularly empaneled and sworn, duly pre
sented to the Court and made a part of it*
record in perpet nam tntmoriam, The
absence of any averment to the contrary
in the objections which the defendant nnd
his associates have mado is iteclt an ad*
mission that it is regular.
77, Such a record is sacred and can
riot he falsified or contradicted by any eg
trinsic proof to tho Court which mado it
up. What allegation* of misbehavior or
negtigcncu committed by tho judges,
clerks or grand jurors might be shown to
sustain a plea in abatement, it is not now
a question before this Court, and on that
subject wo aflirm or deny nothing.
Fourth—To allow tho verity of tho re
cord or tho effect arid force of tho indict
raont to bo callod in question by uiero alii
davits not given, upon any issue mado up
between tho parties, would bo a total de
nial of justice to tho Commonwealth, for
great criminals can at all times have their
spies prowling about the ante-rooms and
corridors to walcli for some irregularity,
or the OwiiwiPn some form, and affida

New London, Uonn., November lit.—Al
collist. n between a freight an i a passenger'
train on the New London Northern rail-ji
'r.-ad occurred at half past s. ven u'clock i <
this morning, between Palmer and Throe
rivers. MSM. The engine# of both trains ,
sad two or three cars were wrecked. Sev
en person* whose name* have not yet been .
ascertained were injured more or less se- *
veroly, tbe majority of them being track- ,
men of the road, who wero riding in the i
baggage car of the passenger train. Homer 1
Williams, engineer of the freight train, J
ha* both legs broken, and his fireman is ;
severely injured in the batk. Tbe colli*- i
i n was due to the stoppage of tbo freight,'

In combatting tbe common idea that •
isfety from a lightning slroko can be •-
[cured by insulation on a glass foundation;
■ the Scientific American incindenlallv
• ays, what all 'scientists now affirm, that
tbe git" insulators with which most light
ning-rods are provided are utcloss. if
thero is a path of least resistance fr< m the
rod to the ground through the bouse, th*
discharge will take this path without re
gard to the glass insulators. All light
'mng-rods should be connected with the
' system of g&t-pipo* ar.d steam-!.eating ap
i paratus, furnaces or large masses ol metal
! about a bouse, and then carefully ground
ed in moist earth. Tho lsc<<t ground can
! be obtained by connecting the lightning
' rod with the water-pipes, if there are such
about the houe.
