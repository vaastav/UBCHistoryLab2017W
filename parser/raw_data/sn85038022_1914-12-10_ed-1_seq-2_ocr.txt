HEALTH.
"It is rigiit that we should provide it not only,
hut that wo should make it ns attractive as possible,
and so induce our young men to undergo it at such
times as they can command n little freedom and
can seek the physical development they need, for
.mere health's sake, if for nothing more. Every
means by which such things can be stimulated, are
legitimate, and such a method smacks of true Amor
ican ideas.
"It is right, too, that' the National Guard of the
states should be developed and strengthened by
every means which is not inconsistent with our ob
ligations to our own people or with the established
policy of our government. And this, also, not be
cause the time or occasion specially calls for such
measures, but because it should be our const out
policy 'to make these provisions for our national
peace and safety.
"More than this carries with it a reversal of the
whole history and character of our policy. More
than, this, proposed at this time, permit me to say.
would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession,
that we had been thrown off oilr balance by
a war with which we have nothing to do, whoVo
causes can not touch us, whose very existence af
fords us opportunities of friendship and disinter
ested service which should make us ashamed of any
thought of hostility or fearful preparation for
trouble.
" "This is assuredly the opportunity for which a
people and a government1 like ours were raised up,
the opportunity not only to speak but actually to
embody and exemplify the counsels of peace and
amity and the lasting concord which is based on jus"
ticc and fair and generous dealing.
"A. powerful navy wc have always regarded as
our proper and natural means of defense; and it
Jias always been of defense that Ave have thought.
never of aggression or of conquest. But who shall
tell us-now what sort of navy to build? AVe shall
take leave to be strong upon the seas, in the future
as in the past; and there will be no thought of of
fense or of provocation in that. Our ships are our
natural bulwarks." President Wilson's Message.
ILLITERACY DEFINED.
Hev. 13. E. Smith's contribution to the Messenger
on Thursday was timely as well as novel. The
topic chosen by him for treatment was, "Illiteracy,
One of the Causes of the Great AVar In Europe."
The amplification of this theme made the notable ar
ticle. It was novel chiefly in the broader meaning
given by Dr. Smith to the word "illiteracy." In
common parlance the word is taken to mean the
absence of knowledge of books and other things
strictly literary. This is the moaning given to the
word by most of those who use it. This is conveni
ent aud customary, but Dr. Smith delves deeper and
peers further and gives us a new significance for
this now quite current word. He makes it mean not
only ignorance of letters, but ignorance of men and
their manners. He even hints that there is not only
ignorance of neighbors, hut misinformation founded
on preconceived notions nurtured by egotism and
jealousy.
And just here is where he accounts for the war
most rationally. Not only does he find the cause in
a rational way, but he also does it ethically and
thus accounts for the more brutal and more fre-
qucnt wars of the past when men (or brutes, were
they?) stood face to face and bayoneted each other
to death, or even broke each other's skulls with
clubs or stones.
Yes, illiteracy the lack of knowledge of each
other's interests and purposes, no doubt caused the
war and other wars. Owensboro Messenger.
AN OUTRAGEFAGAINST te RAILROADS,
The statement is madd by a well informed rail
road man that the railroads of this country "kilt
over 5,000 persons annually, an average of fourteen
every day, because there arc no laws penalizing
trespassing on railroad tracks.
In other countries men arc fined for exposing
themselves by walking on railroad tracks.
Hero wc assess heavy damages against railroads
hecaifsc men put themselves where those operating
Ihe trains can not avoid killing or injuring them.
We have seen so much here of this free train hop
ping, walking on the tracks and the eternal pen
chant to trespass on the danger zones of the raiU-,
ways, and the resulting accidents and tragedies
that one almost is forced to think that many hu
man beings are incapable of reasoning.
If a hobo, tramp, loafer, deadbcat, or any one
else is killed oV injured while trespassing on a rail
road, the company should not bo blamed.
Wc mean those who trespass.
The railroads are common carriers and if a dead
hobo is a superior being vested wjth special rights
and privileges, the statutes ought to say so but
they don't.
Keep off the ears unless you have it ticket aivftj
keep off the tracks even if yon have forty tickets.
WHERE WAS SOCIAL JUSTICE?
What became of Social Justice at the Chicago
conference of the Progressive party? Wc can find
no reference to it in the reports of the proceedings,
and the canned statement issued in behalf of the
committee was devoted in large part to explaining
the need of "a permanent non-partisan tariff com
mission.'.' That particular article of faith could just as wOll
have been framed under the inspiration of Uncle.
Joe Cannon, Boise Penrose and William Barnes.
Let them appoint the tariff commission, and they do
not care how permanent or non-partisan it is.
But this is all as far from Armage'ddon as the
kaiser is from Tipprary. The Army of the Lord
used to battle for Social Justice, and if it has noth
ing better than n permanent non-partisan tariff
commission to fight for, we fear thrit recruiting will
be slow and desertions heavier than ever.
Social Justice ought to have gone to Chicago.
Was it obliged to stay home because the Colonel
staved home? New York World.

A PUZZLE TOR THE COURTS.
Tho city of Omaha has a case that
will interest many another American
city whero such cniidjtinus may prevail.
It all depends upon what is a chiHl,
and what a certain traction ordinance
means. A city lnw of Omaha provides
that tho traction company shall sell car
tickets at reduced rates' to " children
attending school." Several university
students boarded a street car and ten
dered tho reduced-faro tickets. Tho
conductor refused to accept the tick

rot off until their destination was
reached. Now, what is a child f
Of courso, that is a matter easily

Now, what is a child, nnyhow
Thdro is but 0110 w'ny left to determine
nnd that is tho courts, to whom tire

what was in tho mind of tho nuthoi
when ho wroto theso words, and what

questions for philosophers, mind read

uovor'appenr to balk. They novor pas?
it on. They always get something out
of it, nnd if tho man did not mean just
what tho courts have snid ho should

Tells How Vinol Restores
Strength and Vitality to the
Weak, Worn-Out Ones In
Her Charge.
Rosary Hill Homo, Hawthorne, N.Y
"I have been at work among tho sick
nnd noor for nearly eighteen years, and
whenever I have used Vinol for run
down, weak or emaciated patients, they
havo been visibly benefited by it Ono
patient, a young woman, was so weak
and ill she could hardly creep to my door
for aid, and was leaning on a friend's
arm. I supplied Vinol to her liberally
and in a month when sho returned to
thank me I hardly recognized her. Sho
was strong, her color charming and her
cheeks rounded out These words aro
uttered from my heart, in order that
moro peoplo may know about Vinol, aa
there Is nothing makes mo happier in
tho world than to relievo the sick."
Mother M.ALPHONSALATimohO.S.D.,
Hawthorne, N.Y.
Such disinterested and reliable testi
mony should convince everyone of tho
merits of Vinol, our delicious cod liver
and iron tonic to build up health and
strength for all weakened and nervous
conditions, whether caused from over
work, worry or chronic coughs and colds.
If Vinol fails to benefit wo return your
money.
