The French people have new cause for com?
plaint in the declaration of a state of siego in
all the provinces still occupied by the armed
forces of Germany. Hut they have only them?
selves to thank for this now grief, as it has
been made necessary by the frequont mur?
derous assaults on German troops by French
citizens. It would be unfair to hold the whole
nation accountable for the state of things in
the interior of France; but it must be con?
fessed that the bratalitk-s committed by the
common people are only the legitimate expres?
sion of the national hatred.
As might he expected from the character of
the new Mayor of Chicago, the message of Mr.

the brief epitome which we have by telegraph.
Retrenchment in salaries is wisdom in tho best
of times, and is especially necessary in a city
which has just suffered a great calamity. Ono
of the lessons of the Chicago fire was the dan?
ger e>f crowding structures of inflammable ma?
terial inside the city Ihn its. " Not another
" wooden building" is the watchword of Mayor
Mcdill. The suggestions are wisely made; and
the financial situation, according to the Mayor,
is cheerful, after all.
TUB PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
To war-worn Abolitionists, accustomed te)
find in each President's Message themselves
beratt-d, their motives aspersed, and their de?
votion to Impartial Liberty stigmatized as im?
pelled by sectional bate and in essence little
better than treason, it must be refreshing lo
rend thit Message, wherein aversion to Slavi'ry
at home and abroad, with recommendations
that onr citizens be forbidden to hold slaves
in countries where human bondage is still
legal, congratulations on the initiation of
cnfi.wobisement in Brazil, hopes that the
process may be hastened, complaints that
Spain's semblance of emancipation in Cuba
and Porto Rico is a mockery, &c?, &c, are
so prominent. The fart that the President
who thus nobly embodies and enunciates the
better impulses of our people was himself a
partisan of Shivery down to the outbreak of
our great Civil War, so far from weakening
the force of his demonstrations against the
discarded scourge and shame of our country,
but intensities and emphasizes that testimony.
,Tust compare this Message in its relations to
Slavery with one of lluchanan's tittered barely
twelve years api, and the im:nen?e, beneficent
stride?? made by our licpublic within that
period will be manifest. Let none doubt that
the melioration is '?ernianent, and far more
likely to lie increased than diminished.
Our Foreign Relations appear to be* satisfac?
tory in the main, and the President is right
in regarding and representing our late Treaty
with Great Britain, whereby our grave dilier
encea with that power aie submitted to friendly
arbitration, as a striking evidence of
progress in true civilization. Cirant that
the Treaty in question is less favora?
ble to us on some points than
might fairly have been expected?that we
should have insisted on a total abolition of war
on private property (other than contraband)
afloat?still we hold that Treaty a theme of
just felicitation, honorable to both parties, and
auspicious to the future peace of Christendom.
We believe Gen. Grant's felicitations there?
upon will be fully responded to by a great ma?
jority of his countrymen.
We judge that our relations with Spain aro
more critical than the President's guarded
language would indicate ; otherwise, we should
strenuously object to his indorsement of Secre?
tary Robeson's " suggestion as to the necessity
" for increasing and improving the material
" of tiie Navy." We protest against any such
increase. If we need more vessels anil more
men for any present emergency, let us hire
them, use them, and pay the bill; but there is
no need of a permanent iacrease. On the
contrary, we suggest that half the National
vessels now rotting idly in our ports bo
sold to the highest bidder, and no longer
watched and guarded at a useless cost while
Uiey grow daily more and moro unseuwortby
and unserviceable. If we ever want moro
war-vessels, these will be found good for
nothing but breaking up and sale as old iron.
Let us break them up at once, now that iron
is ia demand at good prioea, and not let
them eat their heads off twice more.
If we need more guns' in the West
Indies, cull home our useless parade
fleet from the Mediterranean. Secretary
Kobe son is a jolly good fellow, and we wish
hfni all matrimonial and other felicity ; but
his "suggestion" implica more ofticers and
more expense, whether he knows it or not,
und that I ho country will not stand*. Avast,
there, skipper ! for you are rushing on ?sunken
rocks winch your chart seems to luke no noto

The Pi (??dent's recommendations that tho
Internal Taxes be swept away, except those
known Mi Stamps and those levied on
Liquors rind Tobacco, will meet with gen
eral approval. May we not hope that Congi-eaa
will act promptly and decidedly on this lecom
mradationf
Aa to Tariff revision, the President refleofs
very nearly the avcrago sentiment of the
People. Hut we guess his true friends in
Congress will make haste slowly in reducing
the revenue from this source. The fact that
the, Debt lias been steadily and laaycly re?
duced ha? done more than anything* else to
aaake the Administration and the party Mip

' With regard to the Ku-Klux outrages ia
eertain localities at the South, the PreBldent'a
representations are sound, moderate, and will
be heartily approved by a lane majority of
his country mon. Those outrag?e muet be sup?
press ,? peaceable ritirens, however powerless
and despised, munt he protected in their bombie
bornes ; and, if the Staates cannot or will not
do this, the Union must and will. We heartily
regret that National interposition is nea???ary ;
but, since it ta, wc rejoice that it han been
decreed, and bide fair to prove effectuai. The
denunciations of "martial law" in Opposition
journals and sTj-eeehce are lajsed on nntrnth.
There has beea no priielaaiation of martial
law ; nothing more, than a vijiorous nssertten
of the aupretnacy of statute law to conspiracy,
violence, and inurdrr. If any have ab
scondod from their ? home? because of
Hal President's Proclamations, their guilty'
consciences were tbelr B^neore. We wish the
President had ?arien fit, moreover, to ?indicate
hie abhorrence of tho carpet-bag viUainka
whenby several'ScnithfTn State* have been
impoverished and their credit broken down
villainies which partially explain but in no
manner excuse tho crimes of the Ku-Kllix
prowlers; but he is right as to these mis?
creant?, and, so far, the country is with him,
Wo dissent most emphatically from moat pf
the President'n auirgeiatious bailed on the lViwt
master-OcncrarV Report. We deny tfant the ex?
pectation that the Post-Office should sustain
itself is unreasonable. On the contrary, we
hold that the (Vveriiiiicnt should, pay ita own
postage, just as others do, and flint those who
use the Po.-U-Oftioe ahould sustain it?hy a
fair and ?qu?l assessment of the ex?
pense on those who aro benefited by it.
Let everything UrMusmilted through the
iMiiils lie fiiirly assessed to meet this expense :
then, if turee couta por letter doea not poy,
charge four or even five. Pot don't burden tho I
Mails with thousands of tuna of free matter,
and then muhe a parade of supporting the
Department from the Federal Ttvasury. The
system is evi ry way vicious 5 and w ? are grieved
and amazed thai the President still clings to
it. Hip Van Winkle'? twwii-y-yearsr sleep is a
flea-hi le to his.
Then us to "uniting the Telegraphic sysfcrm
" of the Caite?] states with the, Petali system,'*
can the President lie unaware that this means
buying out the present stockholders, ia tele?
graphs at treble the cost of ?'?mstiluting the
existing lines, and thus enriching a small
number at the expense of the great body of
their fellow-citizens Y Ho ought to know this;
for we warned kim of it pcr-ionally a
year ago, and then advised him that
the People would not stand it Mr. Presi?
dent 1 bo entreated to get out of this job and
keep out ! It is certain to damage you if you
do not; for them will be a revolting odor gen?
erated by its comjumniation. Thirty Millions
aro to be taken out of the Treasury by it to
pay for property that never cost Ten Millions ;
and not one dollar of that Thirty Millions will
ever come back again. Indeed, you tell us
that the proposed system would "secure
"the further advantage of extending the
"Telegraph through portions of the country
" tchere private tntcrprite will not construct it."
Not a doubt of it I Only throw the cost of
extending and maintaining the Telegraph on
those who do n't Use it, and wo can have
poles and wires, offieea and batteries, superin?
tendents and operators, where there is no
business, nnd probably never will be. But,
until the Post-Office ia made to pay ita own
way, we insist that it shaH let tho Telegraph
alone. Nor will Congress vote othiTwise,
unless the members aro plied with hthur than
legitimate inducements to go wrong.
?We have some plain strict urns to offer on
Civil Service Reform, but these can wait.
On the whole, we lind much more to approve
than to condemn in this Message, and beliove
that it will lie favorably regarded by a large
majority of the American People.
THE HO?AE COMMITTEES.
Speaker Blaine was confronted by a difficult
and invidious task in the assignment of his
fellow-members to tbo respective Standing
Committees of the House, and he has per?
formed it with judgment and tact. Of course,
every one could not be placed as he wished
to be?indeed, few, we presume, were en?
tirely suited in the arrangement we herewith
announce; for Mr. Dawes, who is Chair?
man of Ways and Means, is under?
stood to have preferred his old place at the
head of the ('ommitteo on Appropriation?, where
he did such excellent service in the last
House. Wo do not know another man who
would be so generally acceptable aa Mr. Dawes
in his new post; but, unless we are misin?
form ed with regard to Mr. Bttrchard's views,
the Ways and Means Committee is no longer
Protectionist, as we think it ought to be. Mr.
B. stands, about midway bet (reen; Pret^lkon
and Free Tia de; but that, we understand, is
where the House chooses for the pie-sent to
stand ; so the selection may be a fair one.
Gen. Garfield is made Chairman of Appro?
priations, and wiQ prove a good one. He has
to choose between pleasing the tax-payers and
obliging the tax.oonsumcra ; but Mr. Dawes
has set him so admirable,* pa ti ern and been
eo firmly upheld in hie upright course by the
country that he can hardly go wrong if he
would, and we think he would not if he
could. Retrbkchmrkt wherever possible, but
especially in the expenditures in and about
tho Capitol itself, Is the work plainly de?
manded of Geu. Garfield and bia Committee:
we hope to say at tho dose of the acssion
that Geh. G. has proved a worthy suc?
cessor of Mr. Dawes.
Our State bos two importent Chairmanships :
Mr. Wheeler retaining that of Pacifie Railroads,
while Gen. Ketchem is advanced to that of
Publie Landa. We urge both to bear in mind
that tho policy of land-grant? fur whatever
! purpose is gravely qnr-stionrd?nay, fiercely
! contested?while judicious friends of that
policy (ii* we claim to be) hold that So much

the bat Congress, is one of the ablest men in
?be 1 lo tina. Mr. Bingham lins four superiors
aa a read? and fluent dobuter.
Massachusetts baa three leading Chiiirman
sbips: Dawe?, Ways and Means; Hooper?
Banking and Currency ; and Bunks, Foreign
Afl-ftrs. We bad guessed that Mr. P. Clark of
our State would preside Over Banking and
Otrrreiiry, -but that seems to have been pre?
cluded by renioving Mr. Hooper from the
Ways and Means. Mr. Clark ia assigned to
do ty on the Committee on Appropriations.
Indiana has the Chairman "of Indian A fiai ra
'(-hanks), mid of Military Affairs (Coburn).
Gan. Shanks has already filled the former
post with eminent fidelity and industry.
Our own State ha? ir^resentatives on nearly
every important Committee, with two each on
IVays and Means, Judiciary, Banking and Cur?
rency, and Pacific Railroads.
Pennsylvania has 8cofield, Naval Affairs,
and no other of first-Tate imr*rrtanco. Mr.
Blaine cannot bo accused of partiality to his
native St?ite.
The complexion* of the Poat-OlTice Com?
mittee gives assurance that the war oa the
Franking Privilege is to be prosecuted with
vigor. So moto it be!
On the whole, wc consider Mr. Blame's cast
of trio Committees a good oue. It might, we
thittU, ltc improved in two or three instances ;
but wo do not know from whom a better
might have bean expected, and we congratu?
late the Hoimo and the country on a distribu?
tion of labora whieh promises signnl energy
anti ellicicucy In the dispatch of business.
THE TREASURY.
The monthly debt statements have told the
public tliat the Government's revenues aro
aaipltv ead that the Publio Debt ia gradually
diminishing. Mr. Rout well's annual report prom?
ises a continuance of this happy condition of
the N.itib_aJ finance-. He estimate? a reduc?
tion of about 118,000,000 in the Internal Rev?
enue roceipta, and of t4j?t?,000 from miscella?
neous sources, and an increase of $4,000,000
in the customs for the current fiscal
year which ends Juno 80, 1873. Tho
expense? be estimates will be about
a million dollars greater than they were in
the year which ended on the -0th of June
lost. The Public Debt was lessened $94,000,000
last year, and the estimated surplus for the
year ending with next Jane 1s about $82,000,
000. Mr. Bout well thinks the time has come
when a cocf?idcrable further reduction can be
mad? in the taxes, and yet leave tho Govern?
ment $50,000,000 a year with which to cancel
ita outstanding bonds. lie recommends Con?
gress to dispense with all revenue from
internal sources, except that derived from
stamps, liqnors, beer, ale, and tobacco. He
also recommends a reduction of the Customs
duties on salt one-half, on coal to 60 cents a
tun, and a .partial removal of the duty on
hides. l?o would enlarge the free list by tho
addition of st-vend minor articles, necessary in
the arts and manufactures, which yield now
bat inconsiderabre revenue.
Ile notes with satisfaction the decrease in
the premium on gold and tho iuerenstd value
of our paper money, and thinks that still
further progress could be made by the substi?
tution ot greenbacks and bank notes for tho
coin at present in use aa currency in the
Pacific Stales. Ho advises a change in the
laws under which the Collector, Surveyor, and
Naval Officer of this Port severally
derive perquisites to the amount of
about $50,000 a year, as their share of fines,
forfeitures, etc., incurred by violators of the
revenue laws. Brief reference is made in the
report to the public buildings contemplated or
in proeess of construction in various cities,
and a hlut is given that appropriations for
buildings not absolutely neces-ary bo delayed
until those now in progress are completed.
The most elaborate portion of the report is
devoted to the subject of the negotiation of
the $300,000,000 of new 5 per cent bonds, in
eluding a statement of the agreement entered
into with the London and American Syndi?
cates. Mr. Bout well thinks that the commis?
sion allowed to the agents of the Govern?
ment by the act authorizing the loan
is too small, and concludes his remarks
under this bead by recommending that
the coupons on United States bonds held
abroad be made payable in London. The
difficult question, What shall we do to keep
the American flag on the ocean f is carefully
discussed, and the conclusion arrived at is that a
liberal subsidy should be guaranteed to persons
who will employ in the foreign trade first-class
American-built iron steamships of not less
than 8,000 tuns burden. Such are the more
important point? touched upon by the Secre?
tary. Our critical review of the positions
takes by him on debatable questions ia un?
avoidably deferred* until to-morrow.
THE CURRENCY.
We find no recommendations of special im?
portance in the report of the Controller of
the Currency. Ho notes the tenacity with
which the Pacific States adhere to a speoie
currency, persistently rejecting "a moro
? active, economical, and accommodating circu
" lating medium," and thinks this characteristio
of the inhabitants of the land of
gold somewhat censurable. He recommends
that provision bo made for the establish?
ment of NationuliRanks in California and Ore?
gon upon a legal-tender basis. A fow cases
of dishonesty have occurred in the manage?
ment of National Banks, but none of any mag?
nitude. The attention of Congress ts called to
the very high rates of taxation that are im?
poned on National Banks inmost of tho 8tates.
The report ia chiefly devoted to a discussion
of the subject of specie payments. The au?
thorities, with few exceptions, the Controller
tells tis, are agreed that when the currency
has been considerably inflated, and specie
payment suspended, there mint be a decrease
of the paper money before euh pay?
ments can be safely resumed. In 1800, a
return to specie pAj_nenU being called for
by the people, Congress passed a law
authorizing the contraction of the greenback
currency. In the Winter of 1867 and 1868 the
currVncy was contracted under this law, but,
hard times coming on, the contraction was
susptiidrd in obedience to popular clamor.
Since thon the people havo not wished for re?
sumption st the cost of contraction, the evils
of which they think to be greater than they

of theeiretiial political economy Mill find

Tf'lB POST OFFICE.
Mr. Creswell'* report is long and in larga.
uM-jaaure statistical, but it is interesting. The
Poat-Ofliee Department is about aa far tis ever
from paying its own expenses ; but the service
boa licou greatly extended and improved,
and new fouturus are to bo introduced
which will still further increase its con?
venience to the public. The syateim of
! railway post-offices, and tho sorting snd
, distribution of maila in transit, which has
been for some time in operation ?m a few
principal rentes, will soon be established all
along from New-Brunswick to San francisco,
and from the Bay of Pitndy to tho Gulf of
Mexico. How enormous are the distances
which our' mail ?service lina to cover
may be judged from the f.tct that
thpse two trunk lines of railway of
ticcs alone are respectively 3^32 dhd
8,108 milee in length, while one of our foreign
route? (that from New-York to Kio) is 5.500
miles long, and another (San Francisco to
China and Japan) 7,0t? miles. Mr. Creswell
'gives excellent reasons why tho Brazil and China
services shimld be made semi-monthly instead
of monthly. He recommend* the encourage?
ment of American steamship lines by offering
their project??? ? a reasonable oompenieation
? for conveying the mails in excess of the
" postage receipts." But it will be observed
that tho postago receipts earned by all the six
English and Germ?n lines which carried the
mails from the United States to Great Britain
in 1871 amounted to only |174,13???an average
of alxmt $?00 a trip.
Of Mr. Creswell's scheme for placing the
telegraphs under Government control we have
spoken elsewhere. It is a mischievous plau,
which we believe the good -tenso of the coun?
try will reject. Returns aro citeil of the great
increase in tbe number of messiiges trans?
mitted over British wires since they were
united with the Post-Office Department ; but
the in?rense results from the redii?*tion in ?tolls,
and not from the chango of management. Mr.
Creswell could increase the consomption of
bread if ho woultl buy up all the bakeries and
sell loaves at half price.
THE INTERIOR.
In times of peace the great intorests repre?
sented in the Department of the interior come
to the front. These have a dominant im?
portance when the country is tranquil
and the din of anns is hushed. The
Cens?a, Land System, Indian Affairs, Rail
reads, und other kindred topics, with all
their peaceful tnumphs, are embraced in
tho satisfaatory Report of the Secretary.
And the country will find much cause for
gratulation aad pride in the facts and figures
which are here arrayed. Foremost atnoug these
subjects come the condition, treatment, and
possible future of those wards of the nation?
tho American Indians. The Secretory lias no
words to waste upon this much-discussed
topic, and what he says is concisely to
the point, though some? of his views have
the merit of novelty. It is to be observed
tliat the Secretary is able to report a peacea
blo disposition among most of the Indian
tribes, the exceptions being those wandering
mer.? which hover along the borders ot Texas,
New-Mexico, Arizona, and Dakota. To the
credit of the Indian Service it should be remem?
bered that these nomads have only Lately come
under the influence of any tentative civilizing
system ; indeed, it is but a short timo since
they have come in contact with any form of
civilization, even in antagonism. That tho
Indian is onpiiblo of acepiiring the arts of
peace, when long enough under their mihi
restraint, is shown by the statistics exhibited
by the Secretary. This officer, encouraged
by the industrial progress made by many
tribes, favors the policy of gathering all
tho remnants of tribal organizations upon
one groat Ueservc. Lcaviug out the 73,000
Indians of Alaska, tho Secretary figures
the rest of the aboriginal people in the
Republic at 342.CT 1. To provide for the domes?
tication of these, he suggests that the Indian
Territory, west of Missouri and Arkansas, and
south of Kansas, with an area of 44,1.54,240
acres, would afford 180 acres of land,
per capita, for the entire number
were alt gathered there. This hint is a sug?
gestiv o one, especially when we reflect that
such an ingathering of tribes would release
nearly 100,000,000 acres of land to improve?
ment and settlement by a white population.
Buf it must be recoUected that two railroads
now building through the Indian Territory,
are entitled to right of way through it, and
are asking for a partial throwing open of the
adjacent lands. Other objections to the plan
will occur to every one. The remaining sug?
gestions of the Secretary, relative to the treat?
ment of tho fast-fading Indian races, aro clear
and intelligent. They deserve the thoughtful
attention of Congress.
The General Land Office has disposed of
10,1106,702 acres of the public lands, of which
4.000,!R3r3 ttcres were patented under the .opera?
tion of the Homestead Act of 1862. This is a
comimrutively small amount, though the total
acreage which has passed out of the hands of
the Government is 2,511,879 greater than last
year. It is evident that the demand for lands
immediately available for settlement is trans?
ferred frortf the Land Office to the railroad
?corporations. Considerable prominence is given
to the condition of affairs in California, Colo?
rado, Arizona, and New-Mexico, where the
General Government, as well as the settler,
is embarrassod by ttie multiplicity of private
claims wliiedi cover the country. Those are
incidental to the Spanish occupation of
the region now embraced ia the ? Terri?
tories, though California claims are now re?
duced to aomething like an orderly setthuneut.
But the Spanish land grants, which have
cost Government and citizens to dearly,
are becoming a fruitful source of litigation ia
tho other sections named. Tho Commission?
er's plan for simplification of the Land laws,
consolidating Homestead and Preemption lawa
in ont?, aird nasimihitiug Agricultural College
scrip and military land wai rants in another,
will coin murret itself to the good sense of
Congress.
Pension?! ind their disposal occupy much
apaco in the .Secretary's report, and though
there is a wiiW-rtpread suspicion that there has
been much imposition iu this branch oi the
public service, the (?copie who remember grstr
fally the defenders of the country will not too
ehitBfly rtcrutinU?) the. p??um??iii rolls. The mim?

of all the social and industrial statistics of tits
country. The whole document, embracing as
it doe? many of the operations of the Govern?

strangers of al} lands as affording, with its se*
comp.'tnyiiig documents, an admirable picture
of the great resources and chief coucu-ns of

THE NAVY.
Mr. Kobeaon repeat? the stereotyped demand,
of Secretaries of the Navy for an inciease of
our nav.il foi ce, but he mul.es a suggestion
for the gradual reduction of tbo number of
officers, partly by adding two years to the
term of study at Annapolis, and partly by al?
lowing the grades of Admiral, Vire-Admind,
and Commodore to lapse with tho lives of the
present incumbents. Thns be calculates
we ?bill save about $W0,000 a year
and dispense with nearly .J00 unnctetjisary offi?
cers. Of the present condition of the Naw ho
says very little. We have 170 ?hips. Of these
39 are sailing vessels, 52 are monttors, 17 are
under repair, l8 have never been launched,
and several of them never will be. The list
includes overy sort of craft, down' to dispatch
boats, receiving ships, floating hospitals, and
so on, and embraces a very large propottion
of wooden vessels which are actually not worth
putting in repair. Wo have 53 vewtols in
eervice (including all ?ort*,, and these Are
armed with 001 guns; six other? un fitting oat
and nearly reatly for sea. The ofh-usive
strength of the Navy at the present moment
is repi.-sfutnd by the ? five ?tjundron? in com
mission, comprising in the aggregate 40 v?asela
and H? guns. No information is given in the re?
port us to the internal efficiency of the service,
though it is well known that the Navy has
lteen .lint rae ted by intestine dispute*. Mr.
Roberton acknowledges the failure of the Co?
rean expedition, Imt believes that it has
''contributed materially in its ell'ecte to
"tlio consideration and comfort, aud per
" hap? to the safety, of our citizens
'located there"?a pleasing nnd ?.inginna
assurance which it would be cruel to disturb.
He regards both the surveys for an inter
oceanio canal with satisfaction, but gives ne
decided preference to either the Tehnantepeo
ot the Darien route. Both are practicable,
and the choice between them must lie gov?
erned chiefly by considerations of expou_e.
BOGUS NEWS.
The modern arrangement whereby fabrica?
tions and tlia'ir antidotes are printed in the
same issue of a journal has such obvious ad?
vantages of convenience that we neglect no
opportunity to commend it.
Some weeks since, a telegram preluding a
meeting in Pennsylvania of (len. Butler, Hotaoe
Greeley, and others, to organize resistance to
Gen. Grant's renomination, went the round
without objection or comment. Wo judged
any one who could swallow that too hopeless
a donkey to be influenced by a correction.
Now, we hear that said meeting has been " put
" off," whieh is reassuring. The Time?, in a
Washington dispatch, say? :
" Tlie great oonference of political ' sorelu-ad?' that
was recently announce! st H_m?i>urg, anil did not taits
plaoe, it now set down for tills city, at tlie Arlington, for
Tue min y next Sotaras heard from, the IiIkIi Joint coi. -
ferres are H. P. Cumming?, who Is tho Massachnsotts
Internationale, (Jeor?e Wilkes, snd Horace Greeley. As
Mr. Cunrtuiltigs, ous ot tho conferees, is authority for the
auiioiiiu?tiiuciit, It m.iy be believed, or not, according te
one's fsucy. He. ?ay s that Mr. Wilkes thiuks it possible
to defeat the nomination of President Orant, and Is work,
lug a ?.'hem.) for that purpose ? la Magdalena Bay, bul
lie Mtn.iflf thinks it la easier to prerent the election than
ll.o nomination. He will tell what Mr. Qreeley thinks
about It when he coin?s to the conference."
?Here, you see, is something definite, and
not too far in the future. As we wero naturally
anxious to know "what Mr. Greeley thinks
" about it," we inferred from the above that
Th? 'limes woidd underuiko to tell Bl to-mor-*
row. But, turning to the editorial page of that
paper, we read :
" Tho coming session of Congress Is to afford the oppor?
tunity, and Washington is tobe the hr-tlqii-rteisi for
perfecting the plans of this anti-Grant luoveiucnt, sod
curry tug out the details of the programme. Among tbs
prominent Senators enlisted In It are Sumner, Scbursi
Truui bid!, and Fou ton, while ouisido of Congress tbs ?
loading c?ptalas are Orats Brown, Tom Scott, WendeU

Mr. Orocley, we are Informed, Is not to be admitted Into
the tanks of tue captains, bat will be permitted to do eer
v ice as a guerrilla, soour, sharp-shooter, spy, or whsterer
may be found best suited to his capacity in the sblfUng
exigencies of tlio campaign. The leaders were afrstd la
give him a oaptaiu's commission, because, its they said
be was ' erratic, crotchety, and unreliable.' "
?There"certainly would seem to be some truth,
or at least plausibility, in the above, whatever
its appearance in Tht Times might indicate;
for, up to this -moment, "Mr. Greeley" has
attended no conference, caucus, meeting, or
cabal, held with reference to the nomination
or election of President in 187?; nor has he
been invited to attend any. He has not seen
George Wilkes for a year or more, knows
nothing of " Mr. S. P. Cummings, the Massa
"ehusetts Internationale * (whatever that may
mean,) and has not con ferr ed with reference
to tho Presidency evon with Gen. 11. F. Untier,
amazing as that fact may appear. To tho Witt
of his knowledge, he has been quietly miuding
his own business at and abaut hume, and is
happy to confirm tho statement that he is too
"erratic, crotchety, and unreliable" to be ?
party to any busk-stairs intrigue for the Presi?
dency. If any per*;o^bearing his name ghouj?l.
appear to-day in~ Washington, the police is
requested to arro** that person at a swindler.
The Pittsburgh GazetU still MMM nut to un?
derstand our objection to the ai.pi.iutment of
Gen. Arthur (or any such as he) to the Col?
l?e torship?saying :
" We cannot ont??rtjln the thought that Tut? TiitstniB
