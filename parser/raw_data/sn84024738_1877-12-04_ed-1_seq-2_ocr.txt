TUESDAY DECEMBER 4. 1877.'
The President's Message.
We publish this morning the first annual
message of President IIates* to Congress.
It is a document of which neither tb? author
nor the country can ever become ashamed.
It is the production of an honest wan if we
arc capable of Judging. It is the message
of nn independent, outspoken, sincere pa
triot, who bae no private ends to subserve ?
of a man who seeks not office nor the ap
plause of the multitude, but the best means
of promoting the.welfare of his country.
It bespeaks a man who would, if he could,
have his countrymen to agree with him, but
who will not flatter them by professing to
agree with thorn when he does not, nor
swerve the ninth part of a hair from the
line of rectitude upon which he proposes to
travel in the pursuit and performance of
Ulll* .
Such being the man it is not strange that
the first subject to which he calls the atten
tion of Congress, after the usual almost
perfunctory reference to the health, peace,
and prosperity of the country, should he
the coursc which he has pursued towards
the southern States. "When his letter ac
cepting the Republican nomination for the
Presidency was originally published ? to
which letter he refers in this message? wc
paid it such a compliment as to draw down
upon us some severe comments from cer
tain of our brethren of the Conservative
press of Virginia. Now, when his
tirst message has been published,
we can safcly say much more in
his praise than we thea said, and feel
no fear that any true Southron will
find fault with our words. The President
promised in that letter that if elected he
would do all that lie could to make the peo
ple of the United States forget that there
was any South or any North. Well has he
kept this pledge. He says in his message
that the pacification of the country is the
most Important of all the measures that can
be considered by Congress or the people.
He boldly affirm* t hat hat lie has done was
most in harmony with the Constitution of
the United States and the genius of our peo
ple. Free institutions, in a word, could not
coexist with government from Washington.
Satraps and provinces belong not to this
hemisphere. Military rule does not consist
with republican institutions, (with a small
"r.'') He does not regard his southern
policy as an experiment, but as a success.
It is a success. It can never be anything
else, whatever may take place hereafter.
He is not the wisest man, says Emeksox,
who does what turns out to be the best
thing, but he who does what is the best
thing when it is done. We have no fears,
however, that laudation of the President's
southern policy will ever need even these
few words of qualification. The people will
approve it, voluntarily, and they will com
pel the politicians to approve it. Coxk
I.IXG and Blaixe may mislead the fanatics
of the North, but the masses oi the people.
North and South, will never allow the na
tional clock to be set back.
On the silver question the President takes
exactly the right position. He wishes to
utilize both silver and gold, but he js not
willing to declare by law that niuety cents'
worth of silver is equal to a dollar's worth
of gold. Such a declaration would amount
to nothing. Nobody would believe it. And
so the President, whilst desiring to use sil
ver, wishes to employ it honestly. He would
have it pass for what it is worth, and no
more. The debt of the country is owins in
the money of the world. The bonds were
sold with the understanding that they were
payable in such money. And he would
have the faith of the nation preserved. The
interest has always been paid in gold, and
.every bondholder purchased his bonds with
the understanding that he was to receive his
interest in that kind of coin. The Presi
dent, therefore, would not favor a measure
proposing to pay the nation's creditors in
silver dollars worth less than gold dollars.
The President does not waste much space
upon civil-service reform. Nor will we.
He is right in his views upon this question ;
but his pracdee has hardly squared with his
precepts and we are not sure that it is pos
sible for him, under the circumstances, to
do more than he has done to aid in this sort
of reform. ?
The President refers appropriately to the
state of affairs upon the Rio Grande. We
are ahead of him on this subject, and also
on the question of looking after Cuba. His*
aggressive policy, if such it may be termed,
meets with our approval almost as fully as
it would if it were still more vigorous.
His reference to the army furnishes him
another occasion for defending his southern
policy. We have said enough on that topic.
His reference to the Postmaster-General's
report reminds us that Mr. Ket has recom
mended a change in the postal laws which
will bring him much applause? namely, that
all matter sent from the office of publication
of a newspaper and registered and weighed
together shall go at the rate of two cents per
pound.. Such we understand to be Mr. Key's
recommendation ; and a capital oue it is.
The President does not forget the colored
people. He is a little touched with fanati
cism on this one subject, we fear. His ap
pointments of Douglass and Laxgstox to
important offices were unwi9e acts looked
at from our point of view. Nevertheless,
as Mr. Lincoln, the best of Republicans,
was the unconstitutional emancipator of
the slaves? we rejoice that they are free
Mr. Hates may be excused for pandering
to the prejudices of the Western Reserve
of his grand State of Ohio. But the ne
groes can never be protected from Washing
ton. The southern people, let alojie, will
do a better part by the negroes than all of
the watchfulness recommended to Congress
by the President can accomplish.
The President tells us what of course we
knew? and he knew that we knew? that
the country is at peace with all the world.
He is brief in his references to these sub
jects; and we commend to the reader the
message itseir.
The President recommends a tariff of
ten cents per pound on tea and two
cents on coffee. We must think of this re
commendation before concurring in it. He
says we may thus get rid of all internal
taxes except upon whiskey, beer, tobacco,
and spirits. Leave out tobacco, Mr. Presi
dent, and we'll join hands with you. We
are for any sort of a tariff that will rid us
of the internal-revenue system.
The President promises to sign any
proper bill which Congress may pass in aid
of the public schools of the country. He
also recommends a national university,
which is what ought never to be established
by Congress.
There are other nutters-touched upon by
the President. But they are of minor im
portance.
The message, is well written. It is a
plain, concise, unpretentious document. Its
wtyle fci good; The President knows bow
to say wtat he mea^s. Wc comment* it to
the perug#} of our readers.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
j FeUoxtyCitizcns of the Senate and House
? of Representative*) :
With devout gratitude to tbe bountiful
Giver o! all good I congratulate you that
at tbe beginning of your first regular ses
sion you find oilr country blessed with
health and pcacc and abundant harvests,
and with encouraging prospects or an early
return of general prosperity.
To complete and make permanent the
pacification: of the country continue* to be
and, until it is fully accomplished, must re
main the most important of all our national
interests. The earnest purpose of good
citizens generally to unite their effoits in
this endeavor is evident. It found decided
expression in the resolutions announced In
1876 hy the national conventions 01 the
leading political parties of the country.
There was a widespread apprehension that
the momentous results in our progress as a
riation, marked by the recent amendments
to the Constitution, were in imminent
Jeopardy; that the good understanding
which prompted their adoption in the in
terest of a loyal devotion to the general
welfare might prove a barren truce, and
that the tW sections of the country, once
engaged in civil strife, might be again
almost as widely severed and disunited as
they were when arrayed jn arms against
j?ach other.
? The course to be pursued which m my
judgment seemed wisest in the presence of
this emergency was plainly indicated in my
inauguial address. It pointed to a time
which all our people desire to see, when a
genuine love of our whole country, and of
all that concerns its true welfare, shall sun
plant the "destructive forces of the mutual
animosity of races and of sectional hostil
ity. Opinions have differed widely as to
the measures best calculatcd to secure this
great end. This was to be expected. The.
measures adopted by the Administration
have been subjected to severe and varied
criticism. Any course whatever which
might have been entered upon would cer
tainly have encountered distrust and oppo
sition. Tlie?e measures were, in my judg
ment, such as were most in harmony with
the Constitution and with the genius of
our people, and best adapted, under all the
circumstances, to attain the end in view.
Beneficent results, already apparent, prove
that these endeavors are not to be re
garded as a mere experiment, and should
sustain and encourage us in our efforts.
Already, in the brief period which has
elapsed", the immediate effectiveness, no less
than the justice of the course pursued, is
demonstrated, and I have an abiding faith
that time will furnish its ample vindication
in the minds of the great majority of my
fellow-citizens. The discontinuance of the
use of the army for the purpose of uphold
ing local governments in two States of the
Union was no less a constitutional duty and
requirement, under the circumstances ex
isting at the time, than it was a much-need
ed measure for the restoration of local self
government and the promotion of national
harmonv. The withdrawal of the troops
from such employment was effected delib
erately, and with solicitous care for the
peace and good order of socittv, and the
protection of the property and persons and
every right of all classes of citizens.
The frsults that have followed are indeed
significant and encouraging. All apprehen
sion of danger from remitting those States
to local self-government is dispelled, and a
most salutary change in the minds of the
people has begun and is in progress in every
part of that section of the country once the
theatre of unhappy civil strife; substituting
for suspicion, distrust, and aversion, con
cord, friendship, and patriotic attachment
to the Union. No unprejudiced mind will
deny that the terrible and often fatal collis
ions which for several years have been of
frequent occurrence, and have agitated and
alarmed the public mind, have almost eti
I tirely ceased, and that a -spirit of mutual
forbearance and hearty national interest
has succeeded. There has been a gen
eral reestablishment of order, and of the
orderly administration of justice; instances
of remaining lawlessness have become of
rare occurrence ; political turmoil and tur
bulence have disappeared; useful indus- j
tries have beeu resumed; public credit in the
southern Stages has been greatly strength
ened ; and the encouraging benefit- of a re
vival of commerce between the sections of
tbe country lately embroiled in civil war
are fully enjoyed, buch are some of the re
Suits already attained, upon which the coun
try is to be congratulated. They are of such
importance that we may with contidence
patiently await tbe desired consummation
that will surelv come with the natural pro
gress of events. w ,
It may not be improper here to say that it
should be our fixed and unalterable determi
nation to protect, by all available and proper
means, under the Constitution and- 1 be laws,
the lately emancipated race in the enjoy
ment of tbeir rights and privileges; and I
urge upon those to whom heretofore the
colored people have sustained the relation
of bondmen the wisdom and justice of hu
mane aud liberal local legislation with re
spect to their education and geucral welfare.
A firm adherence to the laws ? both national
and State? as to the civil and political rights
of the colored people, now advanced to full
and equal citizenship ; the immediate re- '
pression and sure punishment bv the nation
al and local authorities, within their respec
tive jurisdictions, of every instance of law
lessness and violence toward them, is re
quired for the security alike of both races,
and is justly demanded by the public opin
ion of the country aud the age. In this way
the restoration of harmony and good-will,
and the complete protection of every citizen,
in the full enjoyment of even- constitu
tional right, will surely be attained. What
ever authority rests with me to this end, I
shall not hesitate to put forth. Whatever
belongs to the power of Congress and the
jurisdiction or the courts of the Union, they j
may confidently be relied upon to provide
and perform. And to the legislatures, the
courts, and the executive authorities of the
several States, I earnestly appeal to secure ?
by adequate, appropriate, and seasonable
means within their borders ? these common
and uniform rights of a united people
which loves liberty, abhors oppression, and
reveres justice. These objects are very
dear to my heart. I shall continue most
earnestly to strive for their attainment. The
cordial cooperation'of all classes? of all sec
tions of the country and of both races? is
required for this purpose ; and with these
blessings assured, and not otherwise, we
may safely hope to hand down our free in
stitutions of Government unimpaired to the
generations that will succeed us.
Among the other subjects of great and
general importance to the people of this
country, I cannot be mistaken, I think, in
regarding as preeminent the policy and
measures which are designed to secure the
restoration of the currency to that normal
and healthful condition in which, by the re
sumption of specie-payments, our internal
trade and foreign commerce may be brought
into harmony with the system of exchanges
which is based upon the precious metals as
the intrinsic money of the world. In the
public judgment that this end should be
sought and compassed as speedily and se
curely as the resources of the people and
the wisdom of their Government can ac
complish, there is a. much greater degree of
unanimity than is found to concur in the
specific measures which will bring the
country to this desired end, or the rapidity
of the steis by which it can be safely
reached.
Upon a most anxious and deliberate ex
amination which I have felt it my duty to
give to the subject, 1 am but the more con
tirmed in the opinion which I expressed in
accepting the nomiuation for the presi
dency and again upon my inauguration,
that the policy of resumption should be
pursued by every suitable means, and that j
110 legislation would be wise that should j
disparage the importance or retard the at- 1
tainment of that result. I have no disposi
tion, and certainly no risrht, to question the
sincerity or the intelligence of opposing
opiuions, and would neither conceal or un
dervalue the considerable difficulties, aud
even occasional distresses, which may
attend .the progress. _ol._ the nation
towards this primary condition to its
general and permanent prosperity. I must,
however, adhere to my most earnest cont
viction. that any :waveriper in purpose, ot.
unsteadiness in methods* so far from, avoid
injr or reducing the inconvenience in
separable froth the transition from on
irredeemable to a redeemable paper cur
rency, would only tend to increase and
prolong disturbance in values, and, un
less retrieved, must end in serious disorder,
dishonor, and disaster in the financial affairs
of the Government and of the people. The
mischiefs which I apprehend, and earnestly
deprecate, arc confined to no class of the
people indeed, but seem to me most
ccrtninly to threaten the industrious
masses, whether their occupations are
of skilled or common labor. To
them, it seems to me, it is of prime import
ance that their labor should be compensated
lu money which is itself fixed in exchange
able value by being irrevocably measured
by the labor necessary to its production.
This permanent quality of the money of the
people is sought for, and can only be gained
by the resumption of specie-payments. The
rich, the speculative, the operating, the
money-dealing classes, may not always feel
the mischiefs of, or may find casual profits
in, a variable currency, but the misfor
tunes of such n currency to those who arc
paid salaries ,or wages'are inevitable and
remediless.
Closely connected with this general sub
ject of the resumption of specie-payments,
is one of subordinate but still of grave im
portance? I mean the readjustment of our
coiuage system, by the renewal of the silver
dollar as' an clement In our specie cur
rcncy endowed by legislation with the
quality of legal-tender to a greater or less
extent.
As there is do doubt of tbe power of Con
gress, under the Constitution, "to com
money and regulate the value thereof," and
as this power covers the..whole range of au
thority applicable to i'tbe metal, the
rated* value and the legal-tender
quality which shall be adopted for
the coinage, the considerations which should
induce or discourage a particular measure
connected with the coinage belong dearly
to the province of legislative discretion and
of public expediency. Without intruding
upon this province of legislation in the
least, I have yet thought the subject, of such
critical importance in the actual condition
of our affairs as to present an occasion for
tbe exercise of the duty imposed by the
Constitution on the President (fl recom
mending to the consideration of Congress
?< such measures as he shall judge necessary
and expedient."
Holding the opinion, as I do, that neither
the interests of the Government nor of the
people of the United States would be pro
moted by disparaging, silver as one of the
two precious metals which furnish tbe coin
age of the world, and that legislation
which looks to maintaining the volume of
intrinsic money to as full a measure of both
metals as their relative commercial values
will permit would be neither unjust nor
inexpedient, 1 must ask your indulgence to
a brief and definite statement of certain
essential features in any such legislative
measure which I feel it my duty to recom
mend.
I do not propose to enter the debate,
represented on both sides by such able dis
putants in Congress and before the people
and in the press, as to the extent to which
the legislation of any one nation can control
this question, even within its own borders,
against the unwritten laws of trade or the
positive laws of other governments. The
wisdom of Congress in shaping any partic
ular law that may be presented for my ap
proval may wholly supersede the necessity
of my entering into these considerations,
and I willingly avoid cither vague or intri
cate inquiries." It is only certain plain and
practical traits of such legislation that I de
sire to recommend to your attention.
In any legislation providing for a silver
coinage, regulating its value and imparting
to it the quality of legal-tender, it seems to
me of great importance that Congress should,
not lose sight of its action as operating in a
two-fold capacity and in two distinct direc
tions. If the United States Government
were free from a public debt its legislative
dealing with the question of silver coinage
would be purely sovereign and govern
mental, under no restraints but those
of constitutional power and the pub
lic good as affected by the proposed
legislation. But in the actual circum
stances of the nation, with a vast public
debt distributed Very widely among our
own citizens, and held in great amounts also
abroad, the nature of the silver-coinage
measure, as affecting, this relation of the
Government to the holders of tbe public
debt, becomes an element in any proposed
legislation of the highest concern. The
obligation of the public faith transcends all
questions of profit or public advantage oth
erwise. Its unquestionable maintenance is
the dictate as well of the highest expe
diency as of the most necessary duty, and
will over be carefully guarded by Congress
and people alike.
The public debt of the United States, to
the amount of $729,000,000, bears interest at
the rate of six per cent., and ?70S,000,000 at
the rate of five per cent., and the only way
in which tbecouutry can be relieved from
the payment of these high rates of interest
is by advantageously refunding the indebt
edness. Whether the debt is ultimately paid
in gold or silver coin is but of little moment
compared with tbe possible reduction of in
terest one third, by refunding it at such re
duced rate. If the United States -had the
unquestioned right to pay its bonds in sil
ver coin, the little benefit from that process
would be greatly over-balanced by the in
jurious effect of 'such payment, if made or
proposed against the honest convictions of
the public creditors. All the bonds that
have been issued since February 12, 1873,
when gold became the only unlimited legal
tender metallic currency of the country, are
justly payable in coin, or in coin of equal
value. During the time of these issues the
only dollar that could be or was received by
the Government in exchange for bonds was
tbe gold dollar.
To require tbe public creditors to take, in
repayment, any dollar of less commercial
value, would be regarded by tbem as a re
pudiation of tbe full obligation assumed.
Tbe bonds issued prior to 1873 were issued
at a time when tbe gold dollar was tbe only
coin in circulation or contemplated by either
the Government or the holders of tbe bonds
as the coin in which they were to b? paid.
It is far better to pay these bonds in that
coin than to seem to take advantage of tbe
unforseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a
new issue of silver coin thus made so much
le^s valuable. The power of tbe United
States to coin money and to regulate the
value thereof ought never to be exercised
for the purpose of enabling tbe Government
to pay its obligations in a coin of less value
than that contemplated by tbe parties when
tbe bonds were iftued. Any attempt to pay
the national indebtedness in a coinage of
less commercial value than tbe money of
tbe world would involve a violation of the
public faitb and work irreparable injury to
the public credit.
It. was tbe great merit of tbe act of March,
18C0, in strengthening the public credit
that it removed all doubt as to the purpose
of the United States to pay their bonded
debt in coin. Tbe act was accepted as a
pledge of public faith. The Government
has derived great benefit from it in the pro
gress thus far made in refunding tbe public
debt at low rates of interest. An adherence
to tbe wise and just policy of an exact ob
servance of tbe public faith will enable the
Government rapidly to reduce the burden
of interest on tbe national debt to an
amount exceeding $20,000,000 per annum,
and eflecl an aggregate saving to tbe United
States of more than $300,000,000 before tbe
bonds can be fully paid.
In adapting the new silver coinage to the
ordinary uses of currency in tbe every-day
transactions of life and prescribing tbe
quality of legal-tender to be assigned to it
a consideration of the first importance
should be so to adjust the ratio between the
silver and tbe gold coinage, which now con
stitutes our specie currency, as to accom
plish the desired end of maintaining the
circulation ol the two metallic currencies,
and keeping up the volume of the two pre
cious metals as our intrinsic money. It is
a mixed question for scientific reasoning
and historical experience to determine bow
far and by what methpds a practical equi
librium can be maintained which will keep
both Tneials in circulation in their ap
propriate spheres of common use. An
absolute equality of commercial value,
free from disturbing fluctuations, is
hardly attainable, and without, it an
v.< i "t ?
unlimited legal-tender for private trans
actions assigned to both nfetals would
Irresistibly tend to drive oat of circulation
the dearer coinage and disappoint the prin
cipal object proposed by the legislation in
view. I apprehend, therefore, that the two
conditions of a near approach to equality
of commercial value between the gold and
silver coinacc of the same denomination,
and of a limitation of the amount for which
the silver coinage is to be a legal-tender,
are essential to maintaining both in circu
lation. If these conditions can be success
fully observed, the issue from the mint of
silver dollars would afford material assist
ance to the community in the transition to
redeemable paper money, and would facili
tate the resumption of specie-payment nnd
its permanent establishment. Without
these conditions I fear that only mischief
and misfortune would flow from a coinage
of silver dollars with the quality of unlim
ited legal-tender, even in private transac
tions. ?'
Any expectation of temporary ease from
an issue of silver coinage to pass as a legal
tender at a rate materially above its com
mercial value is, I am persuaded, a delu
sion. Nor can I think that there is any sub
stantial distinction between an original
issue of sliver dollars at a nominal value ma
terially above their commercial value and
the restoration of the silver dollar at a rate
?which once was, but has ceased to be, its
commercial value. Certainly the issue of
gold coinage, reduced in weight materially
below its legal-tender value, would not be
any the less ' a present debasement of the
coinage, by reason of its equalling or even
exceeding" in weight a gold coinage which,
at some past time, had been commercially
equal to the legal-tender value assigned to
the new issue.
In recommending that the regulation of
any silver eoinagc which may be authorized
by Congress should observe these condi
tions of commercial value and limited legal
tender, I am governed by the feeling that
every possible increase should be given to
the volume of metallic money which can be
kept in circulation, and thereby every pos
sible aid afl'orded to the people in the pro
cess of resuming specie-payments. It is
becausc of my firm conviction that a disre
gard of these* conditions would frustrate
the good results which are desired from
the proposed coinage, and embarrass with
new elements of confusion and uncertainty
the business of the country, that I urge
upon your attention these considerations.
I respectfully recommcnd to Congress
that in any legislation providing for a silver
coinage, and imparting to It the quality of
legal-tender, there be impressed upon the
measure a firm provision exempting the
public debt heretofore issued and now out
standing from payment, either of principal
or interest, in any coinage of less commer
cial value than the present gold coinage of
the country.
The organization of the civil service of
the country lias for a number of years at
tracted more and more of the public atten
tion. So general has become the opinion
that the methods oi admission to it and the
conditions of remaining in it are unsound
that both the great political parties have
agreed in the most explicit declarations of the
necessity of reform, and in the most em
phatic demands for it. I have fully be
lieved these declarations and demands to be
the expression of a sincere conviction of
the intelligent masses of the people upon
the subject, and that they should be recog
nized and followed by earnest and prompt
action on the part of the legislative and ex
ecutive departments of the Government, in
pursuance of the purpose indicated.
Before my accession to office 1 endeavored
to have my own views distinctly understood,
and upon my inauguration my accord with
the public opinion was stated in terms be
lieved to be plain and unambiguous. My ex
perience in the Executive duties has strong
ly confirmed the belief in the great advan
tage the country would 11 nd in observing
strictly the plan of the Constitution* which
imposes upon the Executive the sole duty
and responsibility of the selection oi those
Federal officers who, by law, are appointed,
not elected; and which, in like manner, as
signs to the Senate the complete right to ad
vise and consent to, or to reject, the nomi
nations so made; whilst the House of Rep
resentatives stands as the public censor of
the performance of official duties, with the
prerogative of investigation and prosecu
tion in all cases of dereliction. The blem
ish and imperfection in the civil service
may, as I think, be trated in most ca*cs to
a practical confusion of the duties assigned
to the several departments of the Govern
ment. My purpose ia this respect has been
to return 10 the system established by the
fundamental law. and to do this with the
heartiest cooperation and most cordial un
derstanding with the Senate and House of
Representatives.
The practical difficulties in the selection
of numerous officers for posts of widely
varying responsibilities and duties are
acknowledged to be very great. No system
can be expected to secure absolute freedom
from mistakes, and the beginning of any
attempted change of custom is quite likely
to be more embarrassed in this respect
than any subsequent period. It is here
that the Constitution seems to mc to prove
its claim to the great wisdom accorded to
it ; it gives to the Executive the assistance
of the knowledge and experience of the
Senate, which, when acting upon nomina
tions^ to which they may be disinterested
and impartial judges, secures as strong a
guaranty of freedom from errors of import
ance as is perhaps possible in human affairs.
In addition to this I recognize the public
advantage of making all nominations, as
nearly as possible, impersonal, in the sense
of being free from mere caprice or favor in
the selection ; and in those offices in which
special training is or greatly-increased value
I believe such a rule, as to the tenure of
office should obtain as may induce men of
proper qualifications to apply themselves
industriously to the task of becoming pro
ficients. Bearing these things in mind, I
have endeavored to reduce the number of
changes in subordinate places usually made
upon the change of the general Administra
tion, and shall most heartily cob'perate with
Congress in the better systematizing of such
methods and rules of admission to the pub
lic service, and of promotion within it, as
may promise to be most successful in
making thorough competency, efficiency,
and character the decisive tests in these
matters.
I ask the renewed attention riT Congress
to what has already been done by the Civil
Service Commission, appointed in pursu
ance of an act of Congress by my predeces
sor, to prepare and revise civil-service rules.
In regard to much of the departmental ser
vice, especially at Washington, it may be
difficult to organize a better system tban
that which has thus been provided, and it
is now being used to a considerable extent
tinder my direction. The Commission has
still a legal existence, although for several
years no appropriation ha3 been made for
defraying its expenses. Believing that this
Commission has rendered valuable serv ice
and will be a most useful agency in im
proving the administration of~tbe civil ser
vice, I respectfully recommend that a suit
able appropriation, to be immediately avail
able, be made, to enable it to continue its
labors.
It is my purpose to transmit to Congress
as early as practicable a report by the chair
man of the Commission, and to ask your at
tention to such measures on this subject as
in my opinion will further promote the
improvement of the civil service.
During the past year the United States
have continued to maintain peaceful rela.
tions with foreign Powers.
The outbreak of war between Russia and
Turkey, though at one time attended by
grave apprehension as to its effect upon
other European nations, has had no ten
dency to disturb the amicable relations ex
isting between the United States and each
of the two contending Powers. An atti
tude of just and impartial neutrality has
been preserved ; and I am gratitied to state
that, in the midst of their hostilities, both
the Russian and the Turkish Governments
have shown an earnest disposition to ad
here to the obligations of all treaties with
the United States, and to give due regard to
the rights of American citizens.
By the terms of the treaty defining the
rights, immunities, and privileges of con
suls between Italy and the United States,]
ratified in 1868, either Government may, I
after the lapse of ten years, terminate the j
existence of the treaty by giving twelve
months' notice of its intention. Tlie Gov
ernment of Italy, availing itself of this
faculty, has now given the required notice,
and the treaty will accordingly end on the
17th of September. 1878. , It is understood,
however, that the Italian Government
wishes to renew it in its general scope, de
siring only certain modifications in some of
its articles. In this disposition I concur,
and shall hope that no serious obstacles may
intervene to prevent or delay the negotia
tion of a satisfactory treaty. ?
Numerous questions in regard to pass
ports, naturalization, and exemption from
military service^ have continued to arise in
eases of emigrants from Germany who have
returned to their native country. The pro
visions of the treaty of February 22. 1808,
however, have proved to be so ample and
so Judicious that the legation of the United
States at Berlin has been able to adjust all
claims arising under it, not only without de
triment to the amicable relations existing
between the two Governments, but it is be
lieved without injur)* or injustice , to any
duly-naturalized American citizen. It is de
sirable that the treaty originally made with
the North German Union in 1868 should
now be extended so as to apply equally to
all the States of the empire of Germany.
The invitation, of the Government of
France to narticpate in the exposition of
the products of agriculture, industry, and
fine arts, to be held at Paris during the
coming year, was submitted for your con
sideration at the extra session. It is not
doubted that its acceptance by the United
States and a wcll-selectcd exhibition ot the
products of American industry on that oc
casion will tend to stimulate international
commcrcc and emigration, as well as to pro
mote the traditional friendship between the
two countries.
A question arose sonic time since as to
the proper meaning of (ho extradition
articles or the treaty of 1842 between the
United States and Great Britain. Both
Government?, however, are now in accord
in the belief that the question is not one
that should be allowed to frustrate the
ends of justice, or fo disturb the friend
ship between the two nations. No seri
ous difficulty has arisen in accomplishing
the extradition of crithinals when ne
cessary. It is probable that all points
of disagreement will in due time be
settled, and, if need be, more explicit decla
rations be made in a new treaty.
The Fishery Commission, under articles
18 to 2") of the treaty of Washington, has
concluded its sessional Halifax. There
suit of the deliberations of the Commission,
as made public by the commissioners, will
be communicated to Congress.
A treaty for tlie protection of trade-marks
has been" negotiated with Great Britain,
which has been submitted to the Senate for
its consideration.
The revolution which recently occurred
in Mexico was followed by the accession of
the successful party to power, and the in
stallation of its chief, General Porlirio Diaz,
in the presidential office. It has been the
custom of the United States, when such
changes of government have heretofore
occurred in Mexico, to recognize aud en
ter into official relations with the de facto
government as soon as it should appear
to have the approval of the Mexican peo
ple, and should manifest a disposition
to adhere to the obligations of treaties
and international friendship, Tn the
present case such official recognition
has been deferred by the occurrences
on the Rio Grande border, the re
cords of which have already been commu
nicated to each House of Congress, in an
swer to their respective resolutions of in
quiry. Assurances have been received that
the authorities at the s<*at of the Mexican
Government have both the disposition and
the power to prevent and punish such un
lawful iuvasions and depredations. It is
earnestly to be hoped that events may
prove these assurances to be well-founded.
The best interests of both countries require
the maintenance of peace upou the border
and the development of commerce between
the two republics.
It i? gratifying to arid that this temporary
interruption of official relations has not
prevented due attention by the representa
tives of the United States in Mexico to the
protection of American citizens, so far a*
practicable. Nor has it interfered with the
prompt payment of the amounts due from
Mexico to the United States uuderthc treaty
of July 4, 18G8, aud the awards of the joint
commission. While I do not anticipate an
interruption of friendly relations with Mex
ico, yet I cannot but look with some solici
tude upon a continuance of border disor
ders as exposing the two countries to ini
tiations of popular feeling and mis
chances of action which are naturally un
favorable to complete amity. Firmly de
termined that nothing shall be want
ing on my part to promote a good un
derstanding between the two nations, I yet
must ask the attention of Congress to the
actual occurrences on the border, that the
lives and property of our citizens may be
adequately protected and peace preserved.
Another year has passed without bring
ing to a close the protracted contest be
tween the Spanish Government and the in
surrection in the Island of Cuba. \Y bile
the United States have sedulously abstained
from any intervention in this contest, it is
impossible not to feel that it is attended
with incidents affecting the rights and in
terests of American citizens. Apart
from the effect of the hostilities up
on trade between the United States
and Cuba, their progress is inevitably ac
companied by complaints, having more or
less foundation, of searches, arrests, em
bargoes, and oppressive taxes upon the
property of American residents, and of un
provoked interference with American ves
sels and commerce. It is due to the Govern
ment of Spain to say that, during the past
vear, it has promptly disavowed and offered
reparation for any'unauthorized acts of
unduly zealous subordinates, whenever
such acts have been brought to its atten
tion. Nevertheless, such occurrences can
not but tend to excite feelings of annoy
ance, suspicion, and resentment, which are
greatly to be deprecated, between the re
spective subjects and citizens of two
friendly Powers.
Much delay (consequent upon accusations
of fraud in some of the awards) has occur
red in respect to the distribution of the lim
ited amounts received from Venezuela un
der the treaty of April 25, JS66, applicable
to the awards of the joint commission
created by that treaty. So long as these
matters are pending in Congress the Ex
ecutive caunot assume either to pass upon
the questions presented or to distribute the
fund received. It is eminently desirable
that definite legislative action should be
taken either affirming the awards to be linal
or providing some method for reexamina
tion of the claims.
Our relations with the republics of Cen
tral and South America, and with the em
pire of Brazil, have continued without se
rious change further than the temporary
interruption of diplomatic intercourse with
Venezuela and with Guatemala. Amicable
relations have already been fully restored
with Venezuela, and it is not doubted that
all grounds of misunderstanding with
Guatemala will speedily he removed. From
all these countries there are favorable indi
cations of a disposition on the part of their
Governments and people to reciprocate our
efforts in the direction of increased com
mercial intercourse.
The Government of the Samoan Islands
has sent an envoy in the person of its Secre
tary of State to invite the Government of
the United States to recognize and protect
their independence, to establish commercial
relations with their people, and to assist
them in their steps toward regulated and
responsible government. The inhabitants
oi these islands, having made considerable
progress in Christian civilization and the
development of trade, are doubtful of their
ability to maintain peace and independence
without the aid of some stronger Power.
The subject is deemed worthy of respectful
attention, aud the claims upon cur assist"
ance by this distant community will be care
fully considered.
The long commercial depression in the
United States has directed attention to the
subject of the possible increase of our for
eign trade and the methods for its develop
ment, not only with -Europe, but with other
countries, and especially with the Statesand
sovereignties of the western hemisphere.
Instructions from tliq Department of State j
were issued to the various diplomatic and
consular officers of the Government, asking
thern to devote attention to the question of
methods by which trade between the re
spective countries of their official residence
andtfie United States could be most judi
ciously fostered. .In obedicncc to these in
structions examinations and reports upon
this subject have been made by many of
these officers and transmitted to the Depart
ment, and the same are submitted to -the
consideration of Congress.
The annual report of tbe Secretary of the
Treasury on tbe state of the finances pre
sents important questions for tbe action of
Congress upon some of which I have al
ready remarked.
Tbe revenues of the Government during
the tiscal year ending June 30, 1877, were
$269,000,586.62. The total expenditures for
tbesame period were 8*238,660,008.93, leav
ing a surplus of 830,340,577.69. This has
substantially supplied the requirements of
the sinking fund for that year. The esti
mated revenues of tbe current fiscal year
are $265,500,000, and the estimated expen
ditures for the same period arc 8232,430,
643.72. If these estimates prove to be cor
rect there will be a surplus revenue of
833, 060,356. 2S? an amount nearly sufficient
for the sinkinir fund for that year. The es
timated revenues for the next fiscal vcararc
8269,250,000.
It appears from the report that during
the last tiscal year the revenues of the Gov
ernment, compared with the previous year,
have largely decreased. This decrease,
amounting to the sum of $18,481,452.54,
was mainly in customs duties, caused partly
by a large falling olTof the amount of Import
ed dutiable goods, and partly by the gcnernl
fall of prices in the markets of production
of such articles as pay ad valorem taxes.
While this is felt injuriously in the diminu
tion of the revenue, it has been accompa
nied with a very large increase of exporta
tion". The total exports during the last
tiscal year, including coin, have been 8658,
637,457, and the imports have been 8492,
097,540? leaving a balance of trade in favor
of the United States amounting to the sum
of 8166,539,917; the beneficial effects of
which extend to all branches of business.
The estimated revenue, for the next tiscal
year will impose upon Congress the duty of
strictly limiting appropriations, includinir
the requisite sum for the maintenance of tlx'
sinking fund, within the aggregate est ima
ted receipts. ?
While the aggfrgate of taxes should not
he increased, amendments might be made to
the revenue laws that would, without di
minishing the revenue, relieve the people
from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tea
and coflce is shown by the experience not
only of our own country, but hi other coun
tries, to be easily collected without loss bl
under valuation or fraud, and largely borne
in the country of production. A tax of ten
centsa pound on tea and two centsa pound
on coffee would produce a revenue ex
ceeding $12,000,000, and thus enable Con
gress to repeal a multitude of annoving
taxes yielding a revenue not cxeeedin"
that sum. The internal-revenue svs?
tcm crrew out of the necessities of the war,
and most of the legislation impo.sin" taxes
upon domestic products, under this -Tv.teni ?
has been repealed. By the substitution of
a tax on tea and coffee all forms of internal
taxation may be repealed except that on
whiskey, spirits, tobacco, and beer. Atten
tion is also called to the necessitv of enact
ing more vigorous laws for the "protection
of the revenue and for the punishment of
frauds and smuggling. This can best be
done bv judicious provisions that will in
duce the disclosure of attempted fraud bv
undervaluation and smuggling. All reve
nue laws should be simple in their provi
sions and easily understood. So far as prac
ticable the rates of taxation should be in
the form of specific duties, and not ad va
lorem, ^quiring the judgment of expe
rienced men to ascertain values, and ex
posing the revenue to tiie temptation of
fraud.
My attention lias been called during the
recess of Congress to abuses exiting in the
collection of the customs, and strenuous
etlorts have been made for their correction
by Executive orders. The recommendations
submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury
b.vti commission appointed to examine into
the collection of customs duties at the port
of Xew York contain many suggestions for
the modification of the customs laws, to
which the attention of Congress is invited.
It is a matter of congratulation that, not
withstanding the severe burdens caused bv
the war, the public faith with all creditors
has been preserved, and that as the result
of this policy the public credit has continu
ously advanced, and our public securities
arc regarded with the highest favor in the
markets of the world. I trust that no act
of the Government will cast a shadow upon
its credit.
The progressof refunding the public debt
has been rapid and satisfactory. Under the
contract existing when I entered upon the'
discharge of the duties of mv office, bonds
bearing interest at the rate of per cent,
were being rapidly sold, and within three
months the aggregate sales of these bonds I
had reached the sum of $200,000,000. With i
my sanction the Secretary of the Treasury I
entered into a new contract for the sale of
four per cent, bonds, and within thirty days
after the popular subscription forsuchbonds
was opejied subscriptions were hail amount
ing to ^75,-}9o',i3oO, which were paid for with
in ninety days after the date of subscription.
By this process, within but little more than
one year, the annual interest on the public,
debt was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.
r recommend that suitable provision be made
to enable the people to easily convert their
savings into Government securities as the
best mode in which small savings may be
well secured and yield a moderate interest.
It is an object of public policy to retain
among our own pcopie the securities of the
United States. In this way our countrx- is
guarded against their sudden return from
foreign countries, caused by war or other
disturbances beyojid our limits.
The commerce of the United States with
foreign nations, and especially the export
of domestic productions, has "of late years
largely increased; but the greater portion
of this trade is conducted in foreign ves
sels. The importance of enlarging our
foreign trade, and especially by direct and
speedy interchange, with countries on this
continent cannot be over-estimated ; and it
is a matter of great moment that our own
shipping interest should receive, to the ut
most practical extent, the benefit of our
commcrce with other lands. These consid
erations arc forcibly urged by all the large
commercial cities of the country, and pub
lic attention i$ generallv and wiselv attract
ed to the solution of the problems they pre
sent. It is not doubted that Congress will
take them up in the broadest spirit of lib
erality, find respond to the public demand
by practical legislation upon this important
subject. *
^ ? ? - :
The report of the Secretary of War shows
that the army has been actively employed
during the year, and has rendered very im
portant service in suppressing hostilities in
the Indian country, and in preserving
peace and protecting life and property in
the interior as well as along the ilexicaji
border. A long and arduous campaign hxs
been prosecuted, with final complete suc
cess, against a portion of the Nez Perces
tribe or Indians. A full account of this
campaign will be found in the report of the
General of the Army. It will be seen that
in its course several severe battles were
fought, in which a number of gallant offi
cers and men lost their lives. I join with
the Secretary of War and the General of the
Army in awarding to the officers aud men
employed in the long and toilsome pursuit,
and in the final capture of these Indians,
the honor and praise which are so Justly
their due.
The very serious riots which occurred in
several of the States in July last rendered
necessary the employment of a considerable
portion of tho army to preserve the peace
and maintain order. * In the States of West
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Illi
nois these disturbances were so formidable
as to defv the local and State authorities,
and the National Executive was called upon,
in the mode provided by the Constitution
and laws, to furnish military aid. I am
gratified to be able to stato that the troops
sent in response to the*e calls for aid in
the suppression ol domestic violence were
able by the influence of their presence in tbe
disturbed regious to preserve the peaco
and restore order without the use ol force.

The present condition of the Indian tribes
on the territory of the United States, and
our relations with them, are fully set forth
in the reports of the Secretary of the Inte
rior and the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs. After a scries of most deplorable con
flicts? -the successful termination of which,
while reflecting honor upon the brave sol
diers who accomplished if, cannot lessen
onr regret at their occurrence? we art- now
at peace with all the Indian tribes within
our borders. To preserve that peace by a
just and humane policy wid be the object of
my earnest endeavors. Whatever may be
said of their character and savaire propensi
ties, of the difficulties of introducing :?ui??'n
them the habits of civilized life, and of the
obstacles thev have offered to the progress oj
settlement and enterprise in certain part*
of the* country, the Indians are certain!)
entitled to our sympathy, and C> *
conscientious respect on our part foi
their claims upon our sense of justice.
They were the aborigiual occupants of the
