S . iBB:hUsin the following: Unguaeo: How
Kr the slanders Ion the President's married llfo
E erer started In tho first placo I do not pretend to
itlccS -know, bnt we have always understood that
H, , teahy of them hare their origin ' on the hill. I
ehonld not wish to say that Mr. Ingall ha
gagagV knowingly et In dronlatlon a false story, bnt he
Hg has been bitter and vindlctivo against the Frost-
ggggaV dent" , , ....
1 Senator Ingalls li not the man to keep still
H after an accusation of any sort has been made
gagagBT against him. He thercforo hastons to deny Mrs.
Hfc IVhltaeys assertions In a characteristic stato-
H sunt, which he has carefully prepared in re
K Kponse to sercral requests from correspondents
gagagKi. for Jnterrlews on the subject. Here it is:
f , "The social leader of the Administration, tho
HL v i W tf Cabinet Minister, would hardly cort-
K? ' tent to a formal intenrlow upon a subject so dell.
BW eate and personal as tho domestlo relations of
K' the President without his authority. I assume,
HR? therefore, that the publication In tho Tribune
H Tras mado with his knowlcdgo and sanction. In
HsKk falsely attributing to mo the Invention and dls-
fcKP semination of slanders, even in tho guarded and
K; cautious phrase which is employed, Mrs. Whit.
K; ney transcends propriety, and evidently relies
H, Bpon tho prerotfatiTos of her so for Immunity.
Bf Tho man who mado such a statement, directly or
K j by Inference would bo required to prove It or to
mWt ' retract It.
Bra ' I have never been cither 'bitter or vindio.
HBn tlve against the President' Politically I have
HBM been opposed to him, and my opinions have not
Hfc been furtive nor stealthy. In tho North Ameri.
Hr can Jievtea, In tho Now York Bun, in various
Hp' speeches in the Senate and on the stump, I have
K declared the grounds of my hostility, which need
Hftf B6f bo rehearsed now. I have no more Ill-will
B against him than I have against tho yellow fever
K or.tbs great March blhsaard. My weapons have
BL 'been those of the gladiator, not of the assassin.
MJT ' ' Those who remember the orttlcisms on Lin
H coin, Grant, Gar field and Arthur will not differ
HK" with mo when I affirm that Mr. Cleveland owes
. more to the consideration of his political adver-
E$- sarles than any other pnhllo man in our history.
Hf-i It would be idle to deny that I have heard the
H stories to which Mrs. Whitney alludes, and
Hr? '' others much worse, which time and events atone
Bjv can'verify or, disprove. They have been tho
Hfc common gossip and rumor, the open secret of
Ep tho promenade, the hotel and the olnb for many
HS. months; but they are of Dcmocratlo origin, like
Hl the scandals of the campaign of 1884. Itepub-
Hg , licans are not responsible for them. They have
Kf been circulated and repeated by the highest Dom-
Ki. Mratloauthority.masonllno and feminine. If the
Hb1' partisans of the Executive ar wise they will be
Hpr silent, Tho President's marriage was the most
Hr- popular act of his Administration. The mistress
Hfe' of the White House has no enemy and no rival
Hg in tho affectionate admiration of the American
R ' people. Amid many temptations to levity and
ITjl ' many opportunities for frivolity she has bomo
H herself with unexampled grace, dignity and
Hif composure. Adulation has not disturbed tho
Hp charming and nnaffectod simplicity of her char.
Kh adter. Bhewlll carry with her into retirement
HKf the unabated honor and regard of all who have
r'', been so fortunate as to know her, She will re.

HVK ' can womanhood so long as virtue has a votary
- or beauty a champion. ,,..., . .
K "Borne things aro self-evident In morals and
H-V history as well as In logic. They prove them-
K selves) they aro disproved by evidence. To deny
H& apple accusations is to plead guilty to them.
KgP When you have to offer evidence that an rag
tV is good, that egg Is doubtful; and a doubt-
HS' fnl egg is always bad. The merchant who. Is
K, compelled to produce affidavits to establish his
Hfe. I honesty is probably a thief. Tho citizen who Is
H, now obliged to prove that he was loyal and patri-
RJ otlo during the war was cither a rebel or a Cop-
f I porhead. Shakespeare cast an indellblo stain
w. I upon the 'lady who protests too much,' and no-
e- ' body cares to marry the woman whose chastity
BRji is open to discussion and debate. Bo when it
Kk becomes necessary for a htmbatid to obtain a
Hi certiflcato of good moral character and to prove.
E by the testimony of experts that ho is faithful,
K, considerate and tender towards a young, lovely
v. and affectionate wife, ho may be innocent, but
H ' he certainly is unfortunate. "
kt 'Hlnoe Thursday, when sho was interviewed
B about the slanders on the Prexidcnt, Mrs. whit
K ney has declined to see correspondents or re-
I porters; but when called upon to-day Uy Tiik
K1' j Vomj correspondent and asked what she had
fc to say in reply to Mr. Depew she made this state-
H v mentj
F ' I dislike to say anything more for the press
f, tin this subject, but it distresses me very much
K that Mr. Depew should have become so luuchln-
H, Tolvedinit. Btlll. it was the very fact that Mr.
Kl Depew had told these stories that stung me into
S my indignant outburst, for if he would bellove
t them and he would not repeat them unless ho
H did what man or woman In the whole land
K. would not have the right to believe them, toot
K " for Mr. Depew is eminent beyond all for
HEi1 " fairhess to friend and foe. and is be-
IHtV 3nd 017 criticism or praise in his kindliness
H WiA indisposition to harm others. And yet he,
: f all men. was givon as authority for thexe sto-
v- ries, not by one but by several persons, for he
LLY forgot, in the' excitement of telling them, that
Kif his vivid descriptive powers sent them flying
Kr gain, and in passing from one to another his
W qusilncations of them were forgotten. His de-
vi ' rtial of belief in them now will do far more than
jf1 anything 1 have said to crush them forever back
m'j into the dirt whence they came.

(trxcuf to in woatn.'l
WisniitoTOK, Dec. 11. Dr. Mllburn, tho
blind chaplain of the Houso, set a lot of tho rioh
men on tho floor squirming thlt morning by an
indirectly administered prod. Here 1 what ho
said In hi opening prayer;
' ' Wo dovoutly bless theo for tho Illustrious In
stances of benovolonoo and boneflconco fur.
nlshed lately to tho land by tho Puritan Daniel
Hand and the Quaker Isaiah Williams. Impress
on tho rich men of the country the solemn lesson
that great fortunes aro a trust held for the bene,
tit of their fcllow.mcn;,tliat money only be
comes wealth when widely used to help
others to help theroselvMI that thon
only Is it llko mercy, twloo blessed,
'blessing him who gives and him who take.'
Inspire the moneyed classes of this prosperous
iiountry with lofty passion for the common weal,
leltilng them to leant that happiness Is not to
io found in hoarded wealth, not In selfish and
ynlgar display, but In humbly following in the
footsteps of him who oamo frrrnl heaven to
teach, in life and death, byword and deed, that
It is more blessed to give than to receive. "
During this petition llttlo Deacon White raised
his eves furtively sovcrs times and glanced over
to where Dunham, of Illinois, stood in devont
pono. Dnnham looked guilty, but ho passed the
glanco of reproach along to J. D. Taylor, of
hlo. who has the reputation of being very
"well fixed." Taylor tiptoed softly down tho
aisle and nudged Judge Kollcy in the ribs.
Kclley nodded In acknowledgment and pointed
his famous forefinger at Gen. Hpinola and Peter
P.Mahonoy, of New York. Mahonoy waitcduntll
tho prayer was over and then wont around with
a subscription paper he happoned to have to lit
tle George West, who has mado millions in paper
mills. Everybody looked around for Bill flcott,
but nobody could find hjm. .William Walter
Phelps, too. was absent Perry Belmont would
have come In for a llttlo attention had he not
been on his way to Spain. ' ' Parson " McKinnoy,
of New Hampshire, with professional Instinct,
remarked upon the conclusion of tho prayer;
This would bo a first-class time to pass around
the contribution-box. That prayer would draw
tacks."
The vote on tho passage of the bill to pay back
to tho States the direct Fax levied during tho war
will taken up to-morrpw at 4 o'clock. The House
talked about the bill all day to-day. Thcro is
llttlo doubt that it will pass, although the op
position to it has been growing rapidly within
Hie past few days. It is not entirely a sectional
question, becanso Mills, of Texas, is in favor of
the hill and Dibbio and Elliott of South Caro
lina, both spoke in favor of it to-day. South
Carolina it ono of tho Southern Btates which
furnished not only their own quota but a stir-
5lus. Bouth Carolina paid into tho United States
'rcasury 377,000, whereas her assessment
waa only '.104,000, and tho burden had to bo
borne chiefly by the two Congressional districts
now represented in Congress by Messrs. Dibble
and Elliott.
On tho qthor hand, several Northern Demo
crat and. It la said, somo Northern Republicans
and all the Southern Republicans, aro opposed
to the hill. Cox, of New York, and other North
ern Democrats are expected to speak against it
to-morrow. DuckalcWf of Pennsylvania, mado
a very strong speech against it to-day. The pro
posed amendment to refund the cotton tax,
amounting to three times the direct tax, will bo
supported by all tho Bouthornmeniber. hut
without doubt it will be lost The Direct Tax
bill has already passed the Stnate. There is
some talk about tho probability of a Presidential
veto, but nothing definite can bo learned on this
point
THEY WILL CAUCUS AGAIN.
What Tlenoeratte llepreaentatlvra Will
Probably Do About Admitting State.
Wabuikoton, Dec. 1 1. A hundred arid fifteen
member of the House attended tho Dcmocratlo
cauoua held In the hall of tho House to-night to
discuss the policy In regard to admitting Terri
tories to Statehood. Representative Cox
called tho caucus to order and pre
sided until he wtnted to tako part in
tbo discussion. Then Representative MoOreary,
of Kentucky, took up tbe gavoi. The Omnibus
bill now before tho House, providing for tho
simultaneous admission of Dakota, Montana.
Washington and New Mexico, was the text of
the talk. Tho snbstanee of tho bill met with
general approval, bnt a large proportion of
the speakers were willing to dlvldo Dakota,
admitting tho southern halt as a State and
organizing tho northern half as a Territory. A
E reposition of Mr. Holman to modify the Omm
na bill to this extent was under consideration
when tho caucus, seeing that tho dlsonsston
could pot be finished in ono night, adjourned to
meet again on Thursday evening.
The principal speeches woro made by Dele
gates Toole, of Montana, and Voorheoa, of
Washington Torritory. Both would admit South
Dakota and the othor three Territories men
tioned in tho Omnibus bill. Other spoechos
wcro mado by Cox. Splnola, McAdoo, Oaten,
Ohipman, McDonald and several others. It
was mads nnlto apparent that tho Omnibus bill
will be modified probably so as to divide Dakota
and admit tho southern half Instead of ad
mitting it as a whole.
S. S. Cox would admit all tho Territories by
separate bills, but tho proposition did not meet
with as much favor as tho urouplng plan. Toolo
snggested to admit Montana and South Dakota
off-hand at tho present session, they having al
ready adopted constitutions, and pass an
enabling act for tho othor two Tocritonos. On
Thursday evening tho caucus will probably de
tormlno to push tho Omnibus bill. '
Senator Vance, of North Carolina, is decidedly
annoyed at the criticisms which Democrat in
tho House havo mado of tho conduct of Demo
cratic Bcnatora on the Senate Tariff Dill. Said
ho to-day;
' Tbo criticisms of tho Way and Means Com
mittee of the Houso on the Finance Committee of
the Benato are very unlust Wenevar saw the
Senate bill until a few days before Congress ad
journed. The Senate has bean, in session four
days. The analysis of the Senate bill by Treas
ury experts was handed to tho Senate finance
Committee pn last Wednesday morning. Tho
hard work ' done by the Way and Moans Com
mittee was put in the possession of Spnators
this morning for the first time. To sup-
SMe the Dcmocratlo members of the Finance,
ommlttee capable of analyzing tho Senate bill
and exposing Its provisions In four days is pay
ing them a high compliment indeed, especially
when wo remember tho fact that the Ways and
Means Committee took only about seven months
to frame their bill and pass it in tho House. If
they will posses their souls in patience'! think
they will find the Dcmocratlo members of the
Finance Committee of the Senate adoquato to
tholr duty in tho premlsos. "
ONLY A MAKESHIFT CABINET.
The New Npnnlth ministry Composed of
Weak and Obscure Men.
Madrid. Dec. 11. Premier Sagasta' new
Cabinet ia weaker than the previous one and
will not last Its dissolution is probable in the
Spring. With tho exception of Beflor Armljo
and Seflor Gonzalez the Ministers aro men of
small note and influence. Premier Sagasta has
chosen them for their pliancy. The Liberals an.
tlcipate that thcro will bo no attempts at genu
ino progressive legislation, but rather some con
cessions to tho Protectionists and tho suspension
of the electoral and military reforms. Tho Min
isters took tho oath of offlco to-day.
The Conservatives, led by Seflor Bilvcla and
Beflor Canovas, opened tho debate In tho Cortoa
t day by attacking the G rrernment's policy and
Premier Sagas ta's feeble attitudo In dealing with
tho antl-Consen ativo demonstrations. Premier
Ssgasta and Beflor Morct, tho retiring Minister
of the Interior, spoko In defense. Beflor Sagasta
explained that the rccont crisis wa not caused
by any question of principles, but was due to
the belief of tome members of tha lato Cabinet
that they could not rely upon tho support of a
portion of tho majority. Tho new Ministry, ho
said, would continue tho programme of tho
former Oocniment, trusting to tho assistance
of the majority.

About the Direct Tax Illll,
WAimiNoToit, Deo. 11. -Tho Senate mixed
polltlos with tho tariff talk yesterday, and tho
first amendment to tho hill was adopted reduc
ing the rate on steel beams, Ac, from 1.1 cent
a pound to 1 cent a pound. Bcnator Mcrhcr
ton and Payne (Dem.) voted agalnat Bonator
narris' amendment making tlio rate to.O cents
a pound, a In tho Mills bill.
Tho ball was set rolling by Bonator Vost, who
said Bonator Sherman was wrong In thinking
that tho election had settled tho tariff quostlon
In favor of tho Sonato hill unamended. Ho for
ono didn't see It In that light, and he would offer
amendments to the hill. Ho went into tho de
tail of the metal schedule and referred to the
Bteol Trult as "that gigantic devil-fish of a
combination which puts an lmmcnso amount of
money into tho pockets of its members in tho
name of American labor and of Infant indus
tries. "
Senator Gorman said he had novcr taken an
extremo vlow of tho reduetlon or Increase of du
ties, but ho felt sure that ono cent a pound was
duty enough for protection In the case undor
consideration. In tho midst of a Presidential
campaign and for political purposes tho Benato
bill had been framed, its object being to rcduoa
taxation principally on sugar and tobacco, and
Increase the tax on other articles so as to in.
crcaao unduly the profit of certain Northern
manufacturing Interests; and now tho Senate
was met with tho statement that the. Republican
sido of the chamber would voto solidly to keep
tho bill a It Is, without amendment or modifica
tion. This brought Senator Allison to his feet with a
disclaimer. The bill should not be put through
on party lines or for party purposes, ho said. It
was faulty In many respects hq know. One cent
a pound would be duty enough on steel beams
and ho would so amend if possible.
If that was the caso, why not recommit tho
hill and bring it in when it ia perfected t
Senator Gorman asked. But at any rate, ho
oontinuod, he wa ready to take up tho bill,
consldor Its Items and volo for them if they were
all right Ho could not vote for Senator Harris's
amendment, because . 0 cent was too low a rate,
but l . 1 cents was too high.
' Wo will go to the country again on this sub
ject. " ho added, "and I hope that our side will
bo able to show that protection to Amorican In
dustries, to the full extent of providing for tho
difference in cost of labor here and elsewhere,
will bo made by this side, but that tho sharp dis
tinctions advocated by tho Republicans here and
elsowhero would build up monopolies away be
yond anything that has ever bcon dreamed of,
even during war times. "
Befnro thoy got back Io the merits of tho
amendment under discussion Senators had
something to say about the liquor shops of Hud
son County, N. J., Trusts, a bill got up
for political purposos, patty capital, the Mills
hill, the St. Louis Convention, tho President's
message, tho Dcmocratlo Senatorial caucus, tho
Democratic party, tho election, tho dynamito
explosion at Chicago, tho Whiskey Trust, tho
next Presidential "canvass," tho closing of the
Montana copper mines, commercial devil-flshos
and whatnot.
When they got down to a vote on Senator Har
ris's amendment tho latter wts rejected yeas,
SO; nays, 20 Senator McPherson and -Payne
voting nay and Senator Gorman not voting.
Mr. Vost then moved to fix tho rate at one cent a
pound, and tho amendment went through with,
out a division.
