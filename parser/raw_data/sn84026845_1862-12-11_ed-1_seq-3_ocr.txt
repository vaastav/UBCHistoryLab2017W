?The Peelisu in the Uity.?Tbe nrw* of
the pasbage of tbe bill through the Xation
al House of Representatives, lor the admis
sion of tbe txfaw State of West Virginia,
vu received with demonstrations of ap
proval all orer tbe city. We received tbe
special dispatch announcing the glorious
news about three o'clock in tbe afternoon
and by four o'clock it was spread.throughout
ibe city. Everywhere there was a jubilant
feeling. Tbe news was read in the Hall
ot tbe House of Delegates just as that body
adjoarned and was received with three
cheers. The new State men are eongratu- i
lstiog ?ach other in all direetions apod the
successful delivery of the new bora infant
to whose coming they have looked for
such a long period and with so much soli
citation. It is indeed a subject for joyful
congratulation. It brings with it equal
taiation, equal representation, industry,
power, developed resources and a realisa
tion of all the ardent hopes which have
aonimated the breasts of all true Western
Virginians for many long years. It tells
of a bappy release from merciless task
masters, from conspiracy and rebellion,
from injustice and oppression and all the
innumerable wrongs which Western Vir
ginia has suffered so long and so patiently
Last evening an old baby waker captur
ed by Gen. Kelley at Romney was brought
oat and a salute of thirty-five guns was
Bred in honor of tbe new State.
J^-Hs Had Seem tsi Paresis.?'The
Cleveland Herald, of Monday says: When
the train from Columbns reached Crestline
yesterday, a man came on board and got
into conversation with one ot the passen
ger*. Finding the passenger a rather good
natured sort of a fellow, the straeger "un
bosomed" himself to him. He said be bad
two daughters, young girls, on the train,
and that be wished to take them to Cleve
land. They were motherless, poor things,
baring lost their maternal parent within a
few days. He was endeavoring to get them
to Cleveland to place them in charge of a
relative who bad consented to take care of
them. Unfortunately he bad spent all his
ready money on his wife's funeral, and he
was without funds to pay tbe fare of him
self or the girls. He had a nice gold watch,
a valuable timekeeper, which had belonged
to his poor wife, perhaps tbe kind passen
ger would lend bim fifteen dollars on its
security, to be repaid as soon as tbe train
arrived in Cleveland, where the relative
would be awaiting them. Passenger "heft
ed" the watch, found it to be apparently
"pure g51d?* and took out his pocket book
to advance the money. Just then he re
membered having "seen in the papers"
about similar hard up gentlemen, who de
posited as security valuable gold watches
which turned out to be genuine brass. So
suddenly replacing the pocket book in Ms
pocket he significantly remarked that he
"couldn't see it," and the distressed stran
ger left in disgust.

All of those who would like to see their
houses look cheerful and neat and nice, are
referred to the advertisement of J. C. Har
bour, No. 143 Main street, who baa at this
time, in his mammoth establishment, the
most exteosUe, rich and varied stock of
carpets that we hare seen for a long time.
Bis house is also extensively supplied with
everything >?> house famishing line?
Where everything is displayed in snch
abundance it is useless to particularize. It
jS only necessary to add that ilr. Harbour
and his^assistanta are pleasant gentlemen
to deal with, and that the prices, which
are of course governed by the quality of
the goods, are as low as the lowest.

l9*SncTTnrQ up a Baa Room.?A dread
fui occurrence took place at Graflofj U>e
ether day. E rer since the restriction* have
been placed upon the whisky trade of Wes
ern Virginia the Qraftoo House at Grafton,
on the Baltimore * Ohio Railroad, has
been an .oasis in the wbiskyless desert.
The hope of getting a nip at Grafton has
buoyed up the spirits of railroad passaen
gers and nMy looked totho "tavern under
the hill" lor that spiritual consolation
which they do not hope to attain hereafter.
The other day, however, the military of
ficer having power at that point shut tip
the bar ot the boose, and now no more
whisky toddles are to be bad at Qraflod.1

that on and after Monday next, they mast

The Rebels Preparisglto Attack the
^Gunboats m Galveston Harbor
Na?r Voke, Dee. 10.?Bj a late arriral
from (he Gulf ire bare the following inter
esting glance-of'the progress of affairs
near Galveston, with other matters of la
terest:
It was well understood from trustworthy
authority, on the 13th alt., that the rebels
were preparing to make an attack on the
! Union gunboats in Galveston harbor, with
an armed flotilla of light draught steamers.
And thai five of these vessels were being
fitted np for action, by removing thvlr up
per or hurricane decks, and fortifying their
sides J>y a double layer of cotton bales.?
All the heavy guns from the battery at
Virginia Point have been removed to arm
the steamers and were to be immediately
placed on board. It is known that the
battery consisted of 2 84* pound rifle cao
aon, 2 10-inch Golumbiads, 4 8-inch Go
lumbiads and the remaining 9 guns of 12
and 24-pounders. Another report is that
the rebels intend to eome down under cov
er of night and board the gunboats with a
large force.
The number of Confederate troops un
der arms in the vicinity of Virginia Point
ie estimated at from 3000 to 5000. At
the end of one of ther piers under cover of
the United States iteamer Westfield are
gathered a little baud of 50 or a 100 Un
ionists. They are said to be (n n most
wretched plight, a)moft starving and are
day after day eagerly expecting - United
States troons to come to their relief. If
caught by Uie rebels they will be immedi
ately pnt to death.
Geo. Magruder had recently arrived and
assumed command of the rebel troops, bis
headquarters are at Harrisburg, on Buffalo
Bayou.
Com. Re'nshaw in command of the
United States fleet has everything in
readiness for action at a moments notice.
Her H. B. M. steamer Corette Grey
hound three days from Vera Cr^t, arrived
in the Bay at nine o'cloclt on the morning
ofthelStb. She came to communicate
with the British Consul at Galveston^ Her
officers report that on the 6th inst., during
a heavy gale at Vera Cruz eight vessels
were driven aihore and all totally wreck
ed Of these two were Amerioan.

i Washington, Dec. 10.?The Hou?e resu

for the admission of the Stale of Weft
Virginia into the Union.
Mr. Noell, of Mo., briefly stated the rea
sons why, after careful investigation, be
had come to the conclusion to rote for the
bill. As a representative of a slave State,
be would save the life of the Union wheth
er constitutionally or not.
Mr. Segar, of Va., without entering into
a dlscusaioc of the unconstitutionality of
the pleasure, which bad already been ex
posed, said that the fundamental principle
that all governments derive their just pow
ers from the consent of the people, bad
been ignored in this case. The consent of
North-Western Virginia had not been given
to the proposed New State organization.
He proceeded to show that ibis was ibe
ease. Congress bad no right to interfere
with the domestic concerns of a State
which Id effect tbey proposed to do as to
Northwestern Virginia, la.tbe name of the
loyal people oT the Eastern portion of the
State, be protested against tbe injustice
now sought to be inflicted. What would
become of the loyal people outside of tbe
proposed limits of the new State? Tbey
; would all be turned over to a traitor Gov*
j ernor ot a traitorous 8tate. He wanted tbe
| Wheeling Government to remain as it is,
to serve as a nucleus around which all the
connties might rally. He believed that tbe
j entire 8tate would gradually return to tbe
' fold of tbe Uoion.

The Lt Patrie says that Russell has vir

that she is not prepared to recognise Prince
Alfred as Kiog of Greece.
The London Tint* thinks that Prtnee
Micbales, the youngest brother of tbe King
of London will be elected to tbe Greece

to prepare for Prince Alfred's reception.?
