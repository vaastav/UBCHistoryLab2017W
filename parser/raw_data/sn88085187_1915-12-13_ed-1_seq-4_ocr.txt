EDITORIAL PAGE—Let the Truth Prevail!
President Wilson Neglects and
President Wilson in his interesting message ignored three important issues that possess the hearts
and minds of the people—preparedness against war trusts at home, equality of political freedom, and
federal prohibition of the manufacture, sale and importation of intoxicating* beverages.
He said much about preparedness to meet the aggression of foreign foes, and recommended the ex*
penditure of hundreds of millions for it, but nothing about preparedness against the domestic foes who
have furnished rotten armor for battleships and robbed the nation, year after year, by combines and
extortionate prices. Underlying the matter of preparedness is a mighty question of national policy.
Shall adequate defense of the nation be at the mercy of private corporationsf Or, shall the nation build
its own ships, and make its own armor, guns and munitions'? Shall the government make preparedness
its own business? It is no use trying to disguise the fact that in this question of change of govern
mental policy there are involved somewhat of militarism and a good deal of socialism. But the people
will not stand hundreds of millions more of taxation, with the tißual tribute to the war trusts. Nor can
the president excuse Mb omission on the ground that the method of preparedness is wholly a question
for congress to discuss. He discussed and urged methods of raising the money for preparedness.

What's Your Skeleton For? Who Was Cicero?
They are having lots of fun in New York over the answers to questions in a state examination for
teachers' certificates. For example: "What is the purpose of the skeleton?" "Something to hitch
meat to." Well, what's the matter with that answer? A fine jelly fish you'd be if you didu't have a
bag of bones inside of ye to hitch your meat to! ,
Here's another, a definition of gender: "Gender shows whether a man is feminine, masculine or
neuter." A little hazy, perhaps, that answer. But surely you must be provided with gender or some
thing or other to determine just what many a fellow you meet these days really is. Going down Fifth
avenuoo, New York, the neuters seem to have it.
And here's one that interests us. Reply to question: "Who was Cicero?" "When Cicero delivered
his orations he was a prefix." If we could have caught old Cicero, when we were going to school and
studying those blamed old orations of his, you bet he'd have been a prefix—we'd have made his the pre
nxture of a nice, large, flying brick.
"Shakespeare was a great writer only he used too many familiar quotations?" AMEN!

Educate Boys For American Supremacy
How to create a foreign market is one of the lessons which Germany has taught the world. The
success of her plan has included the training of young men in the languages, business customs, financial
systems, needs and wants, as well as the geography of foreign countries in which she wishes to spread
her manufactures.
The United States is going to become the greatest commercial nation in history. In all discussions
of this promised supremacy there enters the question of labor and wages. And properly. Little is said,
however, about the education of young men to place our manufactures in other countries, and to man
age the details of foreign branches of American business. Our young men have always been loft to dis
cover such chances for themselves. But here is a door to success never opened to our youth before. The
time is ripe now for boys to shape their schooling to meet a big demand for intelligent and educated
young men in the commercial world.

Ignores Three Important Issues
How long will political freedom knock at the White House door and fail to arouse a man big enough
to seize the opportunity for everlasting glory and rank among the immortal liberators 1
How long will this government, almost alone among governments, be able to dodge responsibility
for the .national curse of strong drink t
Nations, like all men, big or little, have in their spines soft, weak, elastic vertebrae. The right is
long recognized, but it is easier, more comfortable to shirk, shift or make special pleadings to avoid tho
accountability that must finally come. The causes of equal rights and eradication of the curse of drink
are taking the same course that the cause of the black slave did. The right is as clear and plain to us
and shines as fiercely as the sun at noon on a cloudless August day. We hesitate, we hide, we tempor
ize, we talk of different human levels, we quibble about states' rights, and finally see that THE RIGHT
IS THE LORD'S LIGHT, and wonder that we didn't see it so long before. Our sons will live to see our
women as free as our negroes. They will see drink abolished by the United States government - And
they will look on our tombstones and that that some of us were moribund with spine troublo quite a
while before burial. M

My Dear Miss Orey: lam a young man and would like to
know how to grow a beautiful head of hair. My hair is dark
brown, quite thick but awfully scraggy. It Just won't get wavy.
I have tried several applications and prescriptions, but without
any effect. Most young men have tholr hair combed pompadour
style and their hair Is wavy. Is It natural or la it a way they care
for their hair? Do barbers make hair wavy? Please answer in
tomorrow's paper. ANXIOUS.
A.—The appearance of the hair depends a great deal on a per
son's general condition. If you keep yourself healthy and wash and
comb your hair frequently, that is aO that can be done. If your hair
Is not naturally wavy It cannot be made so by any method I ever
heard of. In general, I would advise against Ihe use of patented prep
arations) usually they do more harm than good. I doubt if the barber
can do anything other than to help you keep your hair clean.

Q. —Can you tell me what the birthday superstition for De
cember is? J. 0.
I An old rhyme runs as follows
If cold December gave you birth,
Tbe month of snow and Ice and mirth,
Place on your hand a turquoise blue,
Success will bless whate'er you do.
Can you tell me of any school in the city where I can learn
moving picture music? K. ('
A.—The only way to learn t hi.- branch of musical art is to get a
IHJsitiou at a theater and adapt your music under tlie direction of the
manager.
Q. —Whet can be done to rid country towns of the crowds
' of Idle men who gather In front of business places and make re
marks about every woman who passes? CENTRALIA.
A.—lf the police authorities in small towns are not able to handle
tlii.-> >.iiuntil,ii. the business men should take steps to protect their
women customers. Read Zona Gate's stories of Friendship Village
to learn how some public s|>iiited women brought civic purity to their
town.
Q. —What can a young boy give to a girl for Christmas?
A—A boy may give to a girl anything which Is not of a per
sonal nature. That is, he may not give her things to wear. That
privilege in reserved for her I'amlly. He may give Iter hooks, flowers,,
candy, school pennants, stationery, pen, silver pencil or any articles
fur her desk.
D«ar Cynthia: Will you state ln your columns If a Roman
Catholic can become president of the United States? Please
answer as soon as possible as there will be seven of us looking
1 for the answer. A READER.
A.—The only qualifications for the president are that he must
be a native born citizen, of the age of 88 or more.

CONFESSIONS
"So you are going to be one of
the ushers at Mollies wedding,
Jim; aren't you afraid that it will
bneak your heart to see the girl
you wanted to make your wife
married to another?"
Jim had come up to our apart
ment about six o'clock, saying
that he was going to stay to din
ner. I did not want him to stay,
for I was afraid that Dick would
telephone me about half past six
that he would not be home, and
although I knew that Jim would
not ask for any explanations and
would not make any remarks, yet
I knew I could not bluff him a bit.
However, I made the best of
things and did not say a word, ex
cept to ask if Dick knew he were
coming.
"I could not find him this after
noon," said Jim, "but I knew he
would be home to dinner, and as
you had not invited me up for a
long time, I thought I would Just
make you feel mean by inviting
myself."
"Now, Jim, you know you are

always welcoj-e."
"And I also know, my dear
Margie, how much thoaa always
welcome words mean. I don't
believe any man ia 'always wel
come' at any other house than
his own, and sometimes he is not
always welcome there."
"Gracious, Jim, you are not get
ting to be a cynic, are you?"
"Not a bit of it; just stating a
few facts to the lady that knows a
fact when she sees it."
"Well, I can tell you one thing,
Jim Edle, Dick I s always welcome
at his own fireside."
"Of course; did you not under
stand that I intimated it wns only
some homes and some firesides?"
I almost wanted to tell Jim that
I did not get a chance to welcome
Dick as often as I oould wish, but
somehow 1 cant tell anybody but
you, little book, how Dick neglects
me.
Her e Is my peculiar position:
When Dick is home he is almost
always kind, seems to think a lot
of me, often tells me that I am the
only woman ln the world who
does not bore him to death.
"Is that the reason why you see
so little of me?" I asked.
Dick laughed comfortably.
"Don't be sarcastic, dear; it
doesn't become you," he said.
That is the awful part of it all-
Dick doesn't seem realize that
he is doing anything he should
not. lam sure If any one should
ask him he would say that he
knew I was perfectly satisfied,
perfectly happy.
Perhaps I should be, and yet—l
want to have once in a while one
of those rapturous times that we
had before we were married, when
I knew that I was the only thing in
Dicks thoughts. I want to Bee his
eyes brighten as he looks at me. I
want him to make a little excuse
so that he can come near enough
to touch me. I want to see the
kisses in his eyes that he cannot
press upon my lips because wo are
in some public place.
Does any woman, after the
flush of honeymoon, get these?
And in any woman, after the won
derful glory of the honeymoon,
satisfied with less?
I was thinking all this and be
ing rather rude to Jim In not lis
tening te him, 1 guess, for he
■aid:
"Margie Waverly, you are miles
away from here—so far that I am
not sure you will eiver come back.
Can you tell me what you are ■
thinking about?"
"Nothing in particular, Jim. I
am afraid I spend too much time
thinking about myself. Ido wish
Dick would let me go back to
teaching school."
"Great scott!" exclaimed Jim.
"You must be miserable If you
want to teach school again."
Just then Dick came ln, a lit' 1 o
lain. It seemed to me that a shade
passed over his head as he saw -
Jim.
I wonder if It could be possible
to make Dick jealous; I have a
good mind to try.
