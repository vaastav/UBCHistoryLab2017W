MORE aSCRETI UP THE P1TISOW.
HOUSE HON. JACOB THOMPSON,
AGAIN.
We referred, yesterday, to the fact that a
large portion of the private paper and corres
pondence of Mr. Buchanan's Secretary of the
Interior, fell Into the hands of oar army, In the
capture of Oxford, Mississippi. Among the
pipers Is said to be Mr. Thompson's copy-book
of letters written. The one below, we publish
from the Rational InttUigtnctr ot yesterday. It
Is, aa Mr. Thompson say of Mr. Bncliauan,
ajtiui."
When he wrote this letter, Mr. Thompson
was a member of Mr. Buchanan' Cabinet, and
so continued long afterwards. Mr. Buchanan
knew perfectly well the plotllnge In which his
Secretary waa engaged. Indeed, he permitted
Mm to go to Raleigh, as an open and avowed
delegate from Mississippi to North Carolina, to
persuade the utter State to secede. Mr. Itu
i hanan gave Mr. Thompson a leave of absence
from his duties a Secretary of the Interior, for
thlt express purpose, and received him again,
after his return, upon the old footing. Well
might Mr. Thompson cxclalmi
"Buchanan Is the truest friend to the South
I have ever known from the North."
Mr. Thompson, as will be seen, Is not of
those who believe that slavery had nothing to
il with secession. In fact, he assigns no other
esson for secession, except one connected with
livery. "The tucceasful, unrestricted Instal
lation of Lincoln 1 the beginning of the end of
slavery." Mr. Thompson urges that, and he
urges nothing else, as the stimulus and Justifi
cation of the revolution he was conspiring to
1'riog about.

Yesterday morning a large and highly lnln
enttal committee of members of both House
Of Congress, with .Vr'.-.Vnce-PrcilaenttHanilln
aa their chairman, waited npon the President
V the Executive Mansion, for the purpose of
presenting to him the following letter from a
number of the loyal Clllten1 of "Florida t
Nxw You, December R. 1M3.
To Hon. A. Li-icols, President of the U. Slate i
Sin The nndentgned cltlaen of Florida
would respectfully recommend that Hon. Ell
Thayer be appointed Military Governor of Flor.
Ida, with authority to raise twenty thousand or
more emhrrant who will so to reside nerma-
nenllyln that State and become citizen there
of. We are sure that tuch action on the part of
the Administration will meet the approbation
of the loyal citizens of Florida, and will be the
readiest and aulckest mean of cffectnallr weed-
log out treason there. The State I now ripe
for tuch a movement. Action cannot be had
too loon.
Signed by the Hon. Philip Fratcr, and quite
a number of other Florida refugee now In New
York men who have been among the active
butiness citizen of Florida for twenty, twenty
Ave and thirty yean, and some of them native
of the State, and now driven out because of
their loyalty to the old Dag.
Appended to the Florida letter, and signed by
Judge Harris and thirty other Senators, and
Mr. Speaker Grow, and 102 other of the llouit
of Representatives, waa thlt full concurrence
In Its request t
To Hon. Airihim Lincoln, President of the
United States i
Fully concurring In the views of Judge Fra
tcr, and other prominent and loyal cltliena of
Florida, we respectfully ask that his request be
granted.
A paper was alto presented from Major flen.
Hunter, commanding the Department of the
South, entirely approving of the enterprise.
Other papers expressing full belief In the feas
ibility and whilom of the movement, and sign
ed by a number of the most distinguished men
of the country, In both civil and military posi
tion, were also plated In the hands of the Pres
ident. Of the thousands of petitions coming
before the Executive, probably, In the whole
history of the Government there never has been
one so mightily signed at wat thlt of yesterday.
After omc discussion of the subject, by seve
ral gentlemen of the committee, In answer to
queries and suggestions by the President, and
the presenting of certain reasons forearlyactlom
they were pleased to be told that the President
had already given theiubject thoughtful atten
tion, and a the committee withdrew he assured
them that from his deep sympathy with the
loyal men of the rebellious Sulci, as well as
from his high regard for the Judgment of the
distinguished citizens who had concurred In the
prayer of these loyal men of Florida, he should
but consider It his duty as well as pleasure to
tke the subject Into Immediate and .full con
sideration. DANGETt IN THE SOUTHWEST.
Alarming Intelligence hat reached u from
the Southwest. It appear that the armed
rebels of Mississippi, unable or afraid to oppose
the advanco of Gen. Grant's army Into the
heart of the State, havo fallen back towards
Alabama, with the obvious Intention of uniting
with the forces of Gen. Bragg, and of transfcr-
tng the scene of conflict to a new theatre of
war, where they have lose to fear from the mil
itary genius which dominates over it, and more
to hope from victory.
Thla movement on the part of the uew gen
eral sent out by the Jeff. Davis Government to
make headway against Gen. Grant, docs credit
to his military talents.
It, In effect, revive tl (Fabian policy against
this modern Hannibal of the West. Whether
this policy shall be as successful In modern as
It waa In ancient times, depends, we think,
upon the action of our own Government. We
hope that It will not lose a moment In adopt
ing the suggestion which we made several
months since that of consolidating the mili
tary department of the Southwest Into one,
under the command of Gen. Grant. Other lse,
the Union armies In that section are liable to
be beaten In detail, with Inferior number In
the aggregate, by the rebel strategy disclosed
by this movement.
The concentration of all military authority In
J the Southwest la the hands of the only man
capaDic oi projivnr cscrwug u, win cueciuauy
block the game of the rebels In that quarter,
and tpecdlly change the whole aspect of the
war.
We appeal to the loyal Representees In Con
gress from the West for their co-operation In
bringing about thla result before It is too late
to avert the Impending disaster.

cooatderable portion of the casualties wa the
result of ilray shot and thcll from the enemy'

The extreme left, extending to the swamp.

tbey were covered by their own breastworks.
Tho entire loss In the left wing may be call

missing. The fighting In the Immediate vici
nity of Fredericksburg wat principally by Kim
ball' brigade, of French' division. This bri
gade, from Its well-known gallantry on a former
occasion, had been selected from Sumner'
corps to lead the charge on the enemy's centre,
this being considered an Important point to be
gained.
ine charge was inaae, ana tne enemy ariven
at the point of the bayonet, for half a mile, up
the rising eronnd. and almost to the line of
their rifle pits, when a cross-fire of artillery
and musketry from the enemy rendered a fur
ther advance an utter Impossibility. It was
here that General Kimball received a severs
wound In the thigh, and the bodies of the Four
teenth Indiana (one of hi regiment) were
left nearer to the enemy's rlfle-plt than those
of any other of the gallant troops engaged In
tne action inrouguoui tne nay. . i ne line tnut
reached was held by the brigade of General
Kimball, which was, In a short time, reinforced
by General Hancock, until after nightfall, when
they voluntarily retired from, their position.
The loss In this brigade Is probably heavier,
In proportion to Its number, than any otheren.
gaged In Salurdar'o fight, and the los In offi
cer was particularly heavy, almost, Indeed,
unprecedented.
Some Inconsiderable movements on both
tide, and occaalonal cannonading were the
only fact that marked the operation on Sun
day.
Monday was still more remarkable for want
of activity. Orders were pissed through the
entire line of our troops, on Monday afternoon,
for preparations for a charge upon the enemy's
works during the night. In many of the regi
ment there were roll call at every hour )1n
fact, every possible precaution was taken for
the purpose of having our entire force ready at
a moment' warning, ine wounuen in tne
hospitals at Fredericksburg w ere all safely trans
ported to this tide of the river, loaded In the
cart; and the wonnded In the division hospitals
further down the river were also safely brought
over.
Everything at sundown, on Monday. Indi
cated that an Important operation was close at
band. About 8 o'clock In the evening, our ar
tillery quietly commenced crossing the river.
Afterward' the regiments and brigades that
were nearest the rlrertook up the Uneof march,
followed by tho others, until In Franklin's coris
the Nineteenth Indiana alone occupied the ex
treme left and front, and within 300 yards of
tne enemy's pitKci.
Large and numerous fires had been built
along our lines for the purpose of showing
rather an addition of nnmbera than otherwise,
when about half-past 12 o'clock the Nineteenth
Indiana rcrelvcd an order to fall back to their
second Hue, w hlch was glv en loud enough to bo
distinctly heard by the enemy lu their front.
That second line, however, they found to be a
mile and a half this side of the river. During
all this time the troops above and along the
centre had all been quietly transferred, and
long before daylight not a soldier's cap nor a
mule was left on the opposite shore to show Its
late occupancy by Union troopa. The pontoon
bridge were cut loose at the farther end, their
anchor lifted, aud they qnletly floated round
to the north shore In solid column, where thev
were loosed and hauled out of reach of the cne-
mirsguus.
iuu
ius lu a few short hours the entire forces
and property of a largo army were transferred
under the very eye of the enemy aud entirely
within range of their guns, w Ithout the loss of a
man, and without the slightest knowledge on
the part of the enemy of the transaction, until
the morning sun showed where they had been.
Mr. Dennis statos positively that our casual
ties cannot exeeed.ln killed, wounded and miss
lug, ov er .'.,000. The wounds of most of these,
he savs, are bnt slight flesh wounds.

I.M An Ih. .-1.1- ' '
On motion of Mr. BTEVE.NS, the House
went Into Commltte of the Whole on the state
of the Union, (Mr. W. Kellogg In the chair.)
Mr. NOELL proceeded to address the com
mittee. He charged that the Democratic parly
not only gave no support to the Government In
prosecuting the war against the rebellious
Southern Mates, but, on the contrary, were
continually obstructing It successful prosecu
tion In every way. He spoke at Icng.h npon
the subject.
Mr. THOMAS, excitedly. Ifthe gentleman
desired In any way to elevate the character of
those men of the present day, but whom he wtt
now aruouneing, ne couia laae no oetter way to
do so than to Identify them with the federallsu
of New England, whom ho IThoma under-
iuuk vu ucuara were vae most noueil ana most
patriotic party that ever lived beneath the
thmneofGnd. Loud langhler.
Mr. NOELL wa for the restoration or the
Union and the prosecution or the war by all the
physical meant In the power of the Govern
ment to tubjugate the men who have raised
their arms against the Government. He wat
for no compromise with the men who had un
dertaken to destroy the Government. He spoke
the sentiments of the true unconditional Union
men or the border State. Of his own State, at
an event, u.emrn vthonad partaken or the bit
ter fruit of the war, whose homes and fireside
had been desolated, aud who had In every way
felt the oppressor's arm, These men are for no
restoration of the Union short of complete sub
mlsilou to the authority or the Government,
and short of a restoration that will bring abont
a perpetual and endnrlng peace.
The unconditional lojsl men of the border
States are against any peace, any restoration
or the Uulon that would recognlre African
slavery as an element or political power In the
Oovernmenti as a combination, North and
South, to be used as a measure or raising up
or dragging down public opinion. Any such
compromise, or restoration or tho Union on
these conditions, the Union men or the border
States emphatically denounce. The border
States unconditional Union men desire to see
compensated emancipation carried out a ooa
as may be. and knowing this, he had Intro
duced a bill to Hut end. One hundred millions
of dollars would psv for everv slave In Missou
ri, Kentucky and Tennessee, the property of
lujui -.-uncut, itu uuuiuua vtuuiu pay lor
every slave, the property of loyal citizens. In

Tub Poir Orrice Bcumso. bev eral of our

shocking conditlou of the approaches to the
city post office, growing out or the excavations
around the north and cast fronts of the Post
Ofilce building, and which have been most nn.
necessarily rrolrattcd for months. Another
and most serious obstrnctlon In approaching
the city post office results from the use made
of the PostOfflcebuUdlngas.a place or deposit

piled up con&tuully on the north and west

the enemy seemed to be, aa they no doubt were,
perfectly astonished that our army had lie
reeded la returning to thl tide of the Kappa-
nannocK. tve returned wltnoul losing a tingle
man or a gun In the retrograde movement.
A few soldiers, who had straggled off. made
their appearance upon the river bank after the
pontoon bridge had been removed, but they
were) brought over In small boat.
A few cavalry men, who wen guarding a
house Inhabited by a private family,! were not
during the night aware ofour croeefag, but In
the oiornlog, becoming awara of thla fact, they
aafely swam the river.
The pickets of the contending armies being
separated only by a few yard, rendered It ne
ceasary that everything on our part should be
conducted with the utmost caution. Those on
the outpot. were unaware of the movement
until Juit before daylight, when an officer went
to each individual man, and. In a low tone, or
dered him to fall back. Alter they got uffl-
clenlly far to be out or danger, they were or
dered to quicken their pace and reach the
bridges.
About ntno o'clock yesterday moraine-, the
enemy advanced their skirmishers along the
enure line, anu, ny noon, naa csiaoiisnea tneir
pickets near the river bank.
We had a large number of dead on what waa
regarded as neutral ground, and, a aoon aa It
wa known our force had evacuated, the sol
dlers of the enemy commenced robbing the
lifeless bodies. This was plainly seen through
a field glass, as well ai Indistinctly with the
naked eye.
About 10 or 11 o'clock, female, neatly
dreaied, were seeii walking the streets of Fred
ericksburg. They had, doubtless, been con
cealed In their house during the time the city
was occupied by bur troops, and had availed
themselves of tho first opportunity to make
their reappearance.
On Monday, the picket In front of the left
wing agreed upon an armistice among them
selves, and lrecly Intermingled, exchanging
their dead comrades who lay on "neutral
ground." During the time, a general officer of
our army rode up and put an end to these pro
ceedings. The result was, both panic Imme
diately commenced firing, when nine of our men
were killed.
After the general had left, the friendly rela
tion of the picket were renewed, and butter
nut aud blue unlforma freely mingled.
About thl time Gen. Franklin dispatched a
flag or truce, which the enemy Immediately
recognlrcdi and the exchange or dead bodies
wasresumed and continued until completed.
Yesterday afternoon, Gen. Lee sent a , flag of
truce to Gen. Buraslde, asking him to detail
men to burr hi dead In front of Gen. Sumner'
grand division. This wa done.
The wounded, with tht exception of those
whom theenemy obtained, haveelt been brought
to this side of the Rappahannock, and aa rap
Idly aa possible are being sent to Washington.
During the flag of truce, Gen. Stewart, of the
rebel army, In answer to a question, stated that
Banks' expedition had gone South, but be did
not seem io know exactly where.
The entire army I now encamped on the
lame grouud which they previously occupied.
They are aa comfortable, for the present, a
they can be in shelter tent.
Our army has been considerably reinforced
since the battle, and no danger whatorer at
taches to their present position.
It 1 the opinion of military men that had we
even mceeedod in taking tne rront ridge of
works, the opportunity for (laughter by the
enemy would have been far greater than previ
ously. Our men, it may be repeated, behaved
with the greatest gallantry, but no troopa In the
world could withstand such a concentrated fire
of heavy ordnance and musketry under cover of
rortincattons.
