Meeting of Congress ToDay.
The third session of the Forty-second
Congress opens at. the eapitol in Wash
ington, at noon to-day. The Senate and
Ilouse having their organization com
plete, in the main, the message of the
President will, undoubtedly, be com
municated in the course of the day, so
that we shall be able to present it to our
readers, in full, to-morrow morning.
The speaker and clerk of the Ilouse
elected, and the committees appointed,
at the opening of the first session, hold
over and retain their positions until the
fourth of March. In the Senate, the
committees are elected at the opening of
each session, and will therefore have to
be again selected at the present time. In
this respect the Senate differs from the
Ilouse, in that, in the latter the commit
tees are appointed by the speaker for
the entire Congress, while in the Senate
the committees are elected by the sen
ators themselves at the commencement
of each session.
This statement sets at rest the story,
so persistently telegraphed throughout
the country, that Mr. Trumbull would,
at the opening of Congress, resign his
position as chairman of the committee
on the judiciary. He probably will not
have the opportunity," as the majority
will not be particularly anxious to place
one of their bitterest opponents in a
leadiDg position in the Senate. We trust
and believe that honor is reserved to our
own Senator Edmunds. This will, of
course, be the first duty to be attended
to, after the reaeption of the President's
message. A caucus of senators will un-
doubtedly be held, to-day, for that pur
pose when Mr. Trumbull, Fenton,
Schurz & Co. will doubtless be assigned
to back seats.
It 19 impossible, at this time, to fore
shadow the business of Congress, so
much thereof will necessarily be shaped
by the x subjects brought to their atten
tion by the message of the President and
the reports from the several bureaus and
heads of departments. But we may
venture to predict a comparatively har
monious and easy session, with only two
or three questions of particular moment
to occupy their attention, beyond the
ordinary routine of business, considera
tion and passage of the ordinary appro
priation bills, etc. Then, it will be re
membered that this is a short session,
the session and Congress terminating on
the fourth of March ; and as business is
not ordinarly entered upon in earnest
until after the holidays, the session is
practically reduced to about or less than
two months.
There is also auother fact to be taken
into consideration, in reference to the
present session, and that is that the for
ty-third Congress docs not assemble un
til the first Monday in December, 1873.
Hitherto, since the early days of An
drew Johnson's presidency, the first ses
sion of a Congress lias been opened im
mediately at the close of the preceeding
Congress. It will be remembered that
thla alteration in the time of their assem
bling was deemed necessary, in order to
protect the people, and especially the
loyal governments of the Southern States
from tho machinations of Mr. Johnson,
and was repealed when it was found that
there was no further necessity for it
President Grant and his cabinet being
thoroughly in accord with the loyal sen
timcnt ot the country as exemplified by
the republican party.
There is also a counterbalancing fact
to this, and this is to be found in the re
suits of the recent presidential contest.
The overwhelming majority, by which
President Grant was re-elected, was a
substantial endorsement, by the people
of the policy of the Administration and
of the republican party. The questions
arising from reconstruction are settled
equal rights, equality before the law
and impartial suffrage have boon secured
to all, beyond the possibility of recall
amnesty has been practically extended
to all of the lately disfranchised, the ex
ceptions only numbering some hundred
or two of the leaders of the rebellion
and the financial policy of the 'adminis
tration has been sustained. The ques
tions then remaining, demanding the ac
' tion of Congress at its present session.
in addition to recommendations of the
President and the heads of departments
and bureaus, are in carrying out the
present financial policy. That policy
as announced by the Philadelphia plat
form, carried out by the administration
and so emphatically approved by the
people through the ballot box, is the re
duction of the internal revenue taxes.
except upon tobacco and liquors, and the
adjustment of ithe tariff "so as to
aid in securing remunerative wages to
labor, and to promote the industries,
prosperity and growth" of the country.
It Is understood that the commissioner
. of internal revenue has ready for pre
sentation, for the action of Congress, a
bill for reducing the expenses of that
department, but whether further reduc
tions of this form of taxes can, at pres
ent, be made, remains to be determined
ty Congress after a full investigation,
enquiry and discussion. There are two
new subjects of importance to be brought
before Congress, during its present ses
sion, which will doubtless elicit much
discussion as well as public interest. We
refer to the distribution of the fund to
be paid by England, under tho decision
pi the Geneva arbitration, and to the
subject of a "postal telegraph." We do
not propose to discuss, at the present
time, these questions, but may refer to
"them hereafter. Taking into consider
ation the whole field, it would seem to
portend an easy an;! harmonious ses
sion. Postal Telegraph. The Pist master
General recommends in his report the
purchase by the government of all ex
isting lines of telegraph, provided they
can be obtained for a reasonable sum.
If companies insist upon exorbitant
prices, ho thfu recommends that the
Tovernment he authorized to build inde-
pendent lines. lie estimates that, at the
rates he considers fair and just, the lines,
polep, instruments and other property of
existing companies are worth about
twelve millions of dollars. In this, how
ever, he does not include the value of
prospective business, etc. ilia system
contemplatts complete ownership on the
part of the government and making all
connected with the postal telegraph offi
cials and tha appointees of the Post
Office Department. The members of
th9 committee on appropriations, inpar-
tiallv examining to the question of
cost, bav co:ne to tjie conclusion that
such purchases as the Postmaster-Gen
eral recommends cannot be made, either
through arbitration or otherwise, for Icps
than thirty millions.
Alteration of the Postal Laws.
A joint resolution, it is expected," will be
introduced in Congress, at an early day,
giving euch a construction to the para
graph in the postal code, relating to col
lecting unpaid rates on partially prepaid
letters, as will stop ' the present system
of collecting double the amount lacking.
Business men from all parts of the coun
try, have been constantly protesting
against the order not to deliver letters
without the payment of double the rate
due, and many instances have been
brought to the postmaster's attention,
where delay worked serious results.
Members say there was no intention to
provide in the law for double payment,
and it is expected K M ill be speedily
remedied.
A Strange Stobt. The New York
Herald prints two communications sign
ed Chemastin, in which the writer, who
says he is one of the Paris Communists,
states that the Boston fire was the work
of the Labor Reformers, and that the
explosions heard during the fire, which
were attributed to other things, were
but the explosion of a powerful chemi
cal combination, lately invented and
know only to him and his confreres, no
larger than an ordinary apple and cst
ing only ninety-two cents each. He
says their work at Boston was but the
commencement, and intimates that cap
italists shall still further suffer if the
rights of labor are not respected.
A Speedy Retribution. Henry
Johnson, a notorious colored criminal,
was executed at Augusta, Ga., Friday,
for the murder of an aged and infirm
farmer named Martin, on the 29th of
October. Thus within a brief month,
the man committed his last crime, was
arrested, tried, convicted and executed.
A speedy but just punishment for his
crimes.
- The Woman Suffrage Case. The
examination of Susan B. Anthony and
others, for voting in violation of law, in
Rochester, at the recent presidential
election, the commencement of which
was announced " in our telegraphic col
ufnns, Saturday morning, has been con
tinued, for argument, until December
18th.
DcatU of Horace Greeley.
THE ORIGIN, PROGRESS AND END OF IUS
FATAL MALADY.
The Tribune furnishes the following
account of his illness and death :
"So far as any of his associates knew,
Mr. Greeley was in almost as good health
as usual, when on the day after the elec
tion he wrote the card announcing his
resumption of the editorial charge of the
Tribune. His sleeplessness was known
to have become greatly worse, but for
years he had suffered more or less from
the same difficulty, and, as is now clear,
sufficient allowance had not been made
for the intense strain on him throughout
the summer, especially during the last
month of hi3 wite s illness, but it soon
became evident that his strength was un
equal to the hard task to which he set
himself. He wrote only three or four
careful articles, no one of them being
half a column in length. The most
notable, perhaps, was that entitled
"Conclusions, wherein lie summed up
his views ot the canvass. In all he
wrote less than three and a half columns
after his return, contributing to only
four issues of the paper. Two or three
times he handed his assistant short arti
cles, saying : "There is an idea worth
using, but I haven't felt able to work it
out properly. You had better put it in
shape." At last, on Tuesday, the 12tb
instant, he abandoned the effort to visit
the office regularly and sent for the fam
ily physician of Mr. A. J. Johnson, the
friend with whom he was a guest, and
in whose house his wife had died. Every
effort was made to induce sleep, but he
grew steadily worse, until it became evi
dent that his case was critical. Dr.
George C. S. Choate and others were
called in consultation, and finally it was
decided to take him to Dr. Choate's resi
dence, two or three miles distant from
Mr. Greeley's own country home at
Chappaqua. Here he reeeived the unin
termitting attention of Dr. Choate, and
here Drs. Brown, Sequard and others
were called in consultation. The insom
nia had developed into inflammation of
the brain, and under this the venerated
patient rapidly sank. At times he was
delirious and at other times as clear
headed as ever. He lost flesh and
strength with surprising rapidity, and
in a few days the possibility of his
speedy death forced itself into unwilling
recognition. It was not, however, until
Thursday last that his associates and
family brought themselves to admit it,
and even then they clung to their faith
in the vigor of his constitution. On
Wednesday night he failed very rap
idly. On Thursday afternoon and
evening he seemed somewhat easier.
During the night he slept very
uneasily, muttering occasionally, and
frequently raising his right hand. To
wards morning he was more quiet, and
between eight and nine o'clock fell into
nearly an unconscious condition, which
continued with sane internals through
the day. He made occasional exclama
tions, but many of them on account of
his extreme weakness and apparent ina
bility to finish what he begun, were un
intelligible. About noon, however, he
said quite distinctly and with some force,
"I know that my Redeemer liveth."
During the day he recognized several
people, his daughters many times, the
memlers of his household at Chappaqua,
Mr. John R. Stuart and Mr. Reed. On
the whole he suffered little seemed to
have no more than the ordinary restless
ness which accompanies the last stages
of disease. During the day his extrem
ities were cold at there was no pulse at
the wrist. The action of the heart was
very intermittent and was constantly
diminishing in force. He had not asked
for water or been willing to drink it
since his stay at Choate's, but during
Friday he asked for ii frequently. Up
to within half an hour of the end he
manifested in various ways his conscious
ness of what was goimr on around him
and even answered in monosyllables and
intelligently questions addressed to him.
At half past throe lie said very disiinctly
"It is done," and beyond the briefest
answers to questions this was his last ut
terance. His youngest daughter, Miss
Gabrielle, was with him throughout
Thursday evening and throughout Fri
day the elder daughter, Miss Ida, was in
constant attendance as she had been
during the whole of his illness and of
Mrs. Greeley's before him. Other mem
bers of his Chappaqua household were
present with Mr. and Mrs. John It.
Stuart and a few other friends. Noth
ing that science or affection could sug
gest was wanting to ease the last hours,
t he wintry night had fairly set in when
the inevitable hour came. Without
sleighs were running to and fro, bearing
to Chappaqua, the nearest telegraph
station, the latest bulletins, which thou
sands of anxious hearts in the great city
near by kept demanding. Within, the
daughter and a few others stood near
the dying man, who remained conscious
and seemingly rational and free from
pain. In the adjoining room sat one or
two more friends and the physician. At
ten minutes before seven o'clock the
watchers drew back in reverent stillness
from the bedside. The great editor was
gone in peace, after so many struggles ;
in honor, after so much obloquy. -
Letter from the Indian Ocean.
The following letter from Mahe. Sey-
chelle Islands, in the Indian Ocean, was
not intended for publication, but, as it
contains interesting information from an
almost "hitherto unknown" part of the
earth, we take the liberty of laying it be
fore our ceaders :
S EYcnEixE Islands, ")
(Indian Ocean), " - -July
30, 1872.)
I left New York for Liverpool on the
magnificent steamer Atlantic, on the
25th of February, at 6 a. m. We ex
perienced rather rousrh weather some f
the way, and I would have felt safer on
dry land. But our good ship landed us
safe at Liverpool on the afternoon of
the Gth of March. On the 7th, I went
to London, and had the pleasure of visit
ing all the noted places of that famous
city. I was at St. Paul's, Newgate,
Crystal Palace,'Zoological Gardens, West
minster, London Bridge, several muse
ums, theatres, etc. ; was in the House of
Lords, House of Commons, and many
other places, and, I assure you, it was a
pleasant satisfaction to visit those places
of which I have read so much in history.
As regards neatness, London is not to be
compared with our American cities.
There is constantly a dense fog or smoke
in London, giving all the buildings a
dirty, dingy appearance, and one cannot
be on the street long without being cov
ered with the same. A clean shirt is of
no importance. On the 14th of March,
I left London for Southampton, and
sailed the same day for Gibraltar on the
steamer Malta. We had a plain view of
the coast of Portugal, Berlin Rocks,
and Cape St. Yincent, and dropped an
chor at Gibraltar on the 19th of March.
I immediately went on shore, and trav
ersed over the famous "Rocks f Gib
raltar," to my satisfaction, and even
brought away a large piece as a memento.
Arriving at Malta on the '23d, at 8 a. m.,
I remained until midnight, where I pass
ed a busy day in visiting th? Catacombs
for miles under ground, where I found
sharks' teeth and old coin -among the
rocks and old bones of that subterranean
passage, and in visiting other principal
places I called upon an American lady
and attended the theater in the evening.
I reached Alexandria on the 27th of
March, at 7 a. m., remained two days,
and those days I shall never forget. I
visited Pompey's Pillar, Cleopatra's
Needle, Pasha's Place, and many other
places. I had a row with the Arabs and
came out victor ; went the overland route
to Suez, via the Egyptian railroad, and
a more disagreeable ride I never experi
enced, it being one mass of burning sand
all the way. After a long ride of four
teen hours we reached Suez at 9 a. m.
on the 29th of March. This is a most
miserable place at the best. I caught a
glimpse of "Moses' Well" and Mount
Sinai, also the Suez canal. Uur passage
through the Red Sea was pleasant as
could be expected in pleasant weather,
with the thermometer at 120 degrees ;
sailed in sight of the "Twelve Apos
tles," Gibble Zugur Islands, and others.
arriving at Aden, Arabia, April 3d, at 2
p. m. Here J was obliged to bid tare
well to my companions and fellow-pas.
sengers, as they wero to proceed to Bom
bay and China. After going on shore I
learned that an accident had happened t(
one of the French mail steamers, and
that I was destined to remain in Aden
until April 29th. I stopped at the Prince
of Wales Hotel, kept by an old Parsee
a regular tire-worshipper and such an
hotel 1 never saw before, and excuse me
from such another in the future. ell.
Aden is composed of sand and rock
mountains, with a scattering of wild
dogs, mules, vultures, camels, and the
meanest race ot savages imaginable.
The mountains are very high, conical in
form, and learned men have decided that
they were formed by volcanic eruptions,
and the vast quantities of pumice stone,
recently discovered among these moun
tains, gives strong support to such opin
ions. And then one can distinctly see
many layers ot dnrerent kinds ot rock
and substance all the way to the top,
The country is almost entirely barren
for twenty miles from the coast. I rode
about that distance in a carriage, and not
one spot of nature's green could be seen
to relieve the eye. All vegetation is
brought from the interior on the backs of
camels. I think I have seen as many ns
one hundred at a time, loaded with fruit.
grass, etc. Fuel is brought by the wo
men, tied in bundles, on their backs.
They start on 1 heir journey very early
in the morning and return lute at night,
and, by so-doing, eirn about ten cents.
What would some of our American fe
males think of that? Not a well or
spring of fresh water for miles, all
drinking water being manufactured from
the ocean by the use of condensers ; ice
is also made in the same manner. Six
pence for a drink of ice water, and three
dollars per day tor miserable board at a
more miserable hotel. I was informed
by some of the residents of the place
that rain had only descended four times
in twenty-oue years. But I am inclined
to think they were trying to "foolish"
their inquisitive lankce tnend. lou
must not imagine for a moment that I
was homesick or downhearted while en
joying the comforts and blessings of
Aden, lor 1 assure you l was not. J
amused myself bv giving lessons in Eng
lish to the landlord's son, and the little
Parsee boy could read small words quite
well when l came awray. bo you see
my labors were not in vain. I met two
American gentlemen while there, and
that was a treat indeed. I had been in
Ihe company of English, French, Turks,
Arabs and "colored gentlemen" so long
that I was more than pleased to meet
one of my own countrymen. April 29th,
I bid farewell to Aden and sailed for
Leychelle Islands on the French mail
steamer. Jwery cabin was crowded,
and I was about the only one that could
speak Lnglish, but 1 was treated hand
somely while on board, and I believe the
French people are more like Americans
m many ways than any other race. At
7 o'clock p. m., on the 5th of May, I
reached my "island home," and thus
terminated my voyage of so many thou
sand miles. I assure you that those few
weeks will last in memory as long as I
may be permitted to live.
You can imagine my pleasure upon
arriving at this place, and finding it ene
of the most pleasant I have seen since
leaving America. There are over thirty
islands in the Seychelle group, and all,
but two or .three, densely covered with
vegetation. Several of the islands are
quite near together, only a few moments
ride -in a boat and you are there. I am
stationed at Port Victoria, Mahe, the
largest in the group. There are over
15,000 inhabitants on these islands, of
which about 5,000 are white mostly
French and the language, most in use,
is Freuch. There are many Creoles
here, and some of the girls are very
handsome. It is a very common thing
to see whites and blacks living together,
some married and others not, it being all
the same in this place. I found about a
dozen Americans here, most of them
being deserters from American vessels.
I am sending them home as fast as pos
sible. I found one young man here from
Troy, N. Y., and I have seen him in
Rutland. So you see the American ele
ment is scattered all over the globe. At
the present, this place is one of the de
pendencies of Mauritius, but the people
soon expect to be an independent gov
ernment, and the present civil commis
sioner, W. Hevlis Franklj-n, will be
governor. He is a fine old gentleman,
and I think a great deal of him ; in fact,
I spend most of my leisure time with
him. He has been all over the world,
and resided several years in America,
and for that reason understands "us
Yankees" better than most of the Eng
lish people. But I am writing a long
letter, and must hasten to the end. I
have rented a' large house, keep three
servants, live alone,' and sport,' decent
style, of course. . Living would not be
so very expensive here, if one has a wife
to look after the servants, for they .will
steal, and to be caught at it, is the least
of their troubles. "We have all kinds of
fruit, such as oranges, lemons, bananas,
cocoa-nuts, pine-apples, bread fruit,
yams, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and
finally all that one can desire. flwo
large pine-apples can be bought for one
cent; half a bushel bananas for sixpence;
three oranges for one cent, and all other
fruit accordingly. Fish, turtle, chick
ens and beef are the principal meats,
and very dear too. Amusements consist
of parties, picnics, and getting glorwmly
drunk. English men-of-war come here
often, and then we have jolly times.
Three American vessels have been in
port since my arrival, and I expect sev
eral more soon. I found my business
entirely different from anything I was
ever used to, and I have been very much
puzzled how to act many times. But I
have studied very hard and am now bet
ter posted. I have a splendid assortment
of law books, statutes at large, diplo
matic correspondence, etc., and I really
am enjoying myself quite well. I am
a little lonesome at times, and I then re
sort to reading, or take a stroll on the
beach, which 1 find both pleasant and
beneficial. I am some in hopes that I
may improve in health while here, but
cannot say .that I am aware of any
change for the better as yet. The cli
mate is very healthy, and at this time of
the year delightful. The thermometer
ranges from 77 deg. to 81 deg., but in
January, February and March it will be
a few degrees warmer. No contagious
diseases, only a few cases of leprosy,
and they are all taken to one of the
smaller islands. Sharks are very plenty,
and are often seen quite near the wharf.
I have the jaw bone of one to take home,
as a curiosity. I will have quite a mu
seum of curiosities if I remain here
long. The public buildings consist of
two churches Catholic and Protestant
several schools, custom house, prison,
hospital, and a nice court house is soon
to be built, and the Sisters of Charity
occupy a very nice building. I must not
close without mentioning the Rutland
Herald. It comes to me every month,
and seems like an old and dear friend.
Many read it besides myself.

Our Boston Letter.
Boston, Nov. 25, 1872.
We have just passed through another
very exciting week. Ever since the
great fire, every time the fire alarm
strikes, every one rushes to the window
to count the strokes of the bell, and if
the alarm comes from the business por
tion of the city, the streets may be seen
filled with people hurrying to the point
from which the alarm was sounded.
Monday night, about ten o'clock, one
of the stores in State street block, (just
below the Custom Ilouse) caught on fire,
and was damaged to the extent of about
one hundred thousand dollars, including
the goods that were destroyed. Not
withstanding the moon was very bright,
the fire could be seen for many miles in
the country. At the first alarm hundreds
hurried to the scene, but when the sec
ond, third and fourth alarms were sound
ed in quick succession, calling out the
whole department, the streets were
crowded and, for a time, there was more
excitement than even two weeks ago,
when the most ot our business portion
of the city wa3 destroyed.. The firemen
worked splendidly, and in the course of
an hour or so, had the fire under control,
so that a number of engines from adjoin
ing cities were sent home without having
been used at all. On my M ay home,
walking up State street, I heard a tre
mendous noise and, looking up the street,
saw one of the old fashioned hand en
gines advancing quite rapidly, being
hauled by twenty or thirty men and
boys, having evidently come from some
country town, the crowd cheered them
as they flashed down the street.
Wednesday evening the whole depart
ment were again called out by an alarm
from Dock Square, which proved to be
Hand, Avery & Co.'s printing establish
ment. After several hours of hard
work the fire was subdued, but not until
after two hundred thousand dollars
worth of property had beeu destroyed.
Work in the burned district has pro
gressed finely the past week, the streets
having ben all reopened. Most of the
safes have been recovered, but many
considered fire-proef, and for which
large sums of money were paid, on
being opened the contents were found iu
a badly damaged condition. Thus far
the safes of Messrs. Morris & Ireland
have proved the best, as in nearly every
case their safes preserved the contents
in a fine condition.
The Legislature, persuant to the call
of the Governor, met in extra session
on Tuesday, and have been hard at work
since that time in legislating for the
benefit of those who have lost so heavily.
The New York Times' correspondent
spoke in a very damaging way of the
militia who have been called out to do
guard duty. He said some two weeks
since that the people would not submit
to having guard duty done . by the mili
tary instead of the police. lie probably
tried to pass some sentry without a pass,
as certainly they have treated every one
well and have done excellent service.
At the request of some of our prominent
merchants a military guard will be kept
for the present, as there is still a great
deal of valuable property buried in" the
ruins, which it will take some time to
get out.
Quite a number of papers censured
Chief Engineer Damrell for his course
during the fire, but it is admitted by all
competent persons that he did all that
could be done under the circumstances,
and that he is entitled to a great deal of
praise for the masterly manner in which
he conducted his men.
The night of the fire when teamsters
were asking fabulous prices for their
services, a prominent merchant on Oliver
street, seeing a wagon driving by, ran
up and calling . out to the man, "Here,
whose team is that you have got there
where are you going with it ?" Much to
his surprise, the driver jumped off and
ran as fast as his legs could carry him,
having evidently stolen the horse and
wagon. The merchant very quietly
mounted to the seat, drove back to his
office, packed up his valuables, carried
them to a place of safety, and then
turned the horse and wagon over to the
police.
The streets have been crowded the
past few days with our country cousins,
many of them evidently on their first
visit to the city, and prove themselves
an intolerable nuisance, as they insist
upon walking so slowly, and stopping so
often that it is difficult '.o push one's
way through the crowd.
wm. f. weld & CO.
The United States District Court has
been crowded the past week to hear the
proceedings in this case. Your readers
will undoubtedly remember the course
pursued by the U. S. officials in entering
the 6tore of the defendants, and seizing
their books and papers, having been in
formed that they had been defrauding
the customs in their importations.
The Government has retained General
Butler to manage their case, while Weld
& Co., have secured the services of ex-Attorney-General
Hoar and Messrs. So
hier and Olney. With such counsel the
case will be probed to the bottom, and
we are anxiously awaiting the result of
the trial, which, from the slow progress
made last week, promises to be of long
duration.
' ' 'old sourn church.' '
r f i r i : - ; ,- ' ,
: At a meeting of the proprietors of the
Old South Church, it was voted' by a
very small majority, and after a discus
sion, to empower the standing commit
tee . to lease the edifice to the general
government for a post office.
Since the vote was passed quite a
number of citizens have petitioned the
legislature, asking that the committee
be restrained from doing this, as owing
to its historic associations, they desire
that it should always be used as a place
of worship. It seems aimost a pity to
have it used as a post office, but then we
must have a more convenient place than
Faneuil Hall, and the Old South seems
to be the only place that can be had un
til our new post office is completed.
Since the fire the church has been used
as barracks for troops, this being the
second time since it was built that it has
been used for this purpose.
THE COLISEUM.
Saturday afternoon the building used
for the great peace jubilee was sold at
auction. There were not a great many
persons present at the sale and the bid
ding was very slow. At last the build
ing was sold for $10,500, to a lumber
dealer. The lumber ought to be worth
double that amount. I believe that ac
cording to the terms of the sale it must
be taken down by the fifteenth of De
cember, so that the citizens at the south
end begin now to feel safe.
DRAMATIC.
Boucicault has not made himself very

CaMleton Seminary.
A CARD FROM THE PRINCIPAL.
Editor Rutland Ilerakl : 1 see a state
ment in the Castleton correspondence in
this morning's Herald that there have
been several suspensions and expulsions
from the Seminary lately. As I am not
aware of any such events or action by
any teacher here, I must ask you to cor
rect the statement. 1 thank your cor
respondent for the last part of the para
graph. A few words in thatdirection
will do good. The parents must sustain
the discipline of the institution, or it will
be able to accomplish but very little for
the good of its students.
Truly 3'ours,
R. G. Williams.

A Biography for Boys to Remem
ber. Samuel J. Whitten died at Per
kinsville, Vt., on Sunday week. When
a boy, in 1827, he went to North Adams
and worked in a cotton mill, supporting
his poor mother. He became overseer
of the mill, was induced to attend Sun
day school bv the promise of a pair of
shoes from Dr. Ilawkes. His ambition,
pluck and perseverance, made him a
great man at Coleraine, Mass. Before
he died he gave $5,000 to the Congrega
tional church, as a memorial for his de
ceased mother ; .3,000 for a bell for the
church, and 1,000 for the organ. He
also sent to Dr. Ilawkes, in return for
the pair of shoes presented thirty years
before, a box, which upon opening, was
found to contain an elegant black wal
nut case, with three drawers, in which
were forty-seven pieces of cutlery, with
ivory handles and silver-plated blades,
his name stamped on every blade, and a
gold hawk set in everjT handle. Accom
panying this elegant present was a slip
of paper containing to these words: To
pot for the buckled shoes.
The Courier makes a great ado be
cause The Herald did not publish a pa
per on Friday morning. Now. the facts
are, that not a single morning daily
paper was published the morning after
Thanksgiving in New England, and very
few in the country, except the New
York dailies. The Mme is true in re
gard to mornings after New Years and
Fourth of July these are the only days
The Herald suspends. And on these
daj'S it is almost impossible t ) publish a
paper. So strong has become the cus
tom, at these times, compositors, tele
graph operators and the agents of the
associated press, etc., all chum a holiday.
Not 'a publisher, wire he to consult his
own feelings and pocket. wnnUl suspend
a daily paper a single issue. The great
proportion of the circulation of any
daily paper is sold to newsmen by the
hundred, and if there is any profit to
them, it is for the interest of a publisher
to have no omissions. It also always
disarariges business, and makes, more or
less inconvenience, and never is any
profit to a publisher.
We copy, herewith, from several dai
lies, their announcements in regard to
suspension on Friday morning. We
might extract the notices from the en
tire daily press -of New England, if it
were necessary t show that The Her
ald but acted with all the New England
daily papers, in tho suspension of our

Attempted Suicide. John Ray of
St. Albans, cut his throat with a razor

"The connection of Henry Clark with

umns of that paper. Under his efficient
management The Herald has decided
ly improved as a newspaper, and he
proposes to spare no pains or expense to
make it a first class daily paper."
The Montpelier Journal says "the
Senate reporter insists that the same
copy of Friday's proceedings was sent
to the Burlington and Rutland dailies,
and to their office, and the two first
named papers gave the report correctly.
The Woodstock Standard says
"The Rutland Herald of Jlonday

A verv sad accident occurred in our

sundry articles for the family. Having
made the purchases he deposited the ar

body and mounted to return. The horse
took freight at the rustling of the papers
in the basket and ran, throwing the lit

He was carried into the house of Mrs.

AEUNGTON.
Thanksgiving was kept as usual in
Arlington, by a general suspension of
business and laraily gatherings, cnurcn
anenaance on inis uay, auu emmai uap-a,
is not as good as it 6hould be : it being
the fashion generally in all our commu
nities to pay more attention to the secu
lar and domestic occupations of the fes
tival than to its strictly religious duties
which arc really the thief object
of its appointment.
In St. Paul's church the usual morn
ing service was held, with excellent mu
sic by the choir, which is under the
charire of Mr. Clarence Hard, an accom
plished organist, and drill master as well
as musical composer. The festival was
a combination of the American Thanks
giving, and the old English "Harvest
Home.". The chancel, including altar,
lecturn, and font, were handsomely
dressed by the ladies, with wreaths and
autumnal flowers, berries and fruit, and
an evergreen cross studded with immorr
telles.
After the sermon an appeal was made
by the rector in favor of the Uoston sut.
f erers by fire, and the offertory was de
voted to their relief. A special appeal
was made in behalf of St. Stephen's
Church and Home, whose buildings were
then burnt, and which has for a long
time dispensed charity to the needy.
Historical Blunders. The blunders
of English writers in reference to Amer
ican history and geography are notorious.
There are several curious illustrations of
this in Thackeray's "Virginians," in
which he makes Washington regularly
attend church one bundled and twenty-
five miles from hi3 residence, at Mount
Vernon, and a negro chorus heard, across
the Potomac, from Williamsburg, a di
tance ot fifty miles. These instances of
ignorance are looked upon Jjy Americans
as extremely ludicrous and inexcusable,
"What shall we say then of the Apple
tons and . the author of "Major Jones'
Courtship." On page 18, of the new
edition, in a letter, dated May2Sth, 1S42,
appears this passage: "Good gracious!
6he looked so nice and trim jest like
some of them pictures what they have
in Applf ton's Journal." As the eighth
volume and fourth year of that journal
is now drawing to a close, the "Major
must have been gifted with the spirit of
prophecy, or, in their zeal for advertis

blunder.
Not Guilty. The Bennington Ban

"It was only a few years ago that we

the officer that he didn't know anything
about law, and didn't want to sit ; and
at the request of the officer, he went and
told the justice the same thing. The
court was inexorable, however and the
noviciate took his seat on the wooden
bench with the rest. When the jury re
tired to deliberate, this juryman was
chosen foreman, and when they had
agreed and returned into court, he gave
in the verdict thus : 'Not guilty : hvt
he muxrCt do it again ' "'
Lina Edwin's Theatre Burned.
Lina Edwin's theatre, on Broadway,
took fire, on Thursday morning, ami was
burned to the ground. It was probably
caused by a curtain in a saloon under
neath the theatre accidentally catching
fire from a lighted cigar smouldering yi
its folds, or from the wood work around
the f(otlights being ignited in some way
and communicating the flames to the
building. Several persons were rescued
from the building by the police. A large
amount of stage outfits and property
was destroyed, a substantial mansion in
the vicinity belonging to S. J. Lewis,
was severely damaged. A wall 39 feet
high and 25 wide saved several houses
on Lafayette place from destruction.
Had one house gone, the whole row
from Fourth street to Astor place would
have been in jeopardy. Only one man
was dangerously injured. The total loss
is $7(5,550. Ktlley & Lewis' minstrels
lost everything. The building was own
ed by A. T. Stewart.
A Thanksgivino Dinner in London.
At a thanksgiving dinner given in Lon
don by Cyrus W. Field, Premier Glad
stone respondedfat considerable length to
the toast "Great Britain and the United
States. " After reference to the past his
tories of Ijotb countries, he said all oc
casions of difference and controversy
between the two countries had been, in
their nature, temjxrary, and capable of
settlement by intelligent, good sense,
and friendly temper, and the time of
that settlement had now arrived, when
we can speak of it as a thing happily ac
complished." The sentiment between
the two countries tending towards fra
ternal union, wliich heretofore had been
liable to opposite and contending cur
rents, can now move with a full and
equal flow, with nothing to interrupt it
or fix its duration. Ex-Secretary of the
treasury McCulloch responded to the
toast "The Treaty of Washington. "
Hanging In Olden Times.
It is really surprising to those of the
present century to learn for what com
paratively light ana inviai onenses capi
tal punishment in the olden time was in
flicted. A correspondent gives the following
incidents : "While John Hancock was
Governor of the Commonwealth, Rachel
Whall was hung in Boston for highway
robbery. Her offense consisted in
twitching from the hand of another fe
male a bonnet worth perhaps, seventy
five cents, and running off with it. The
most earnest applications for her pardon
were unsuccessful. I mention this not
to the disparagement of the Governor,
lie doubtless acted upon a sense of duty,
thinking it best for the community that
the laws of the land however fright
fully severe while they were laws,
6honld be executed. A lad 18 years of
age was hung in Salem for arson, during
the administration of Gov. Strong, simi
lar appeals in his favor being considered
and overruled. Yet the intelligence
and the. humanity, alike of the Execu
tive and of the Council, notwithstand
ing the result arrived at in both these in
stances, were unquestionable.
"Within the same period, a gentleman
of this city saw a girl seventeen years of
age hung in London, for stealing a sil
ver cream pitcher. Edward Vail Brown
was hung in Boston for burglary, com
mitted in the house of Capt. Osias Good
win, in Charter street, and stealing
therefrom sundry articles. I Once own
ed a set of the Old Bailey Trials. (1775.
1825), embraced in a series of perhaps 58
quarto volumes, The earliest of these
volumes contain the trial of the unfortu
nate Dr. Dodd, for forgery, whose
touching appeals for mercy, here re
corded, were fruitlessly enforced by the
splendid eloquence of Johnson. In a
later volume, long after the commence
ment of the present century, eight capi
tal convictions arc recorded as one day's
Job of a single tribunal, the culprits be-"
ing all boys and girls between the ages
of ten and fifteen, and their offenses pet
ty thefts.
"One case I remember of peculiar ju
dicial atrocity. A young girl in her
18th year wasjndicted for stealing a roll
of ribbons worth three shillings. The
prosecutor's testimony wa3 to this effect:
'The prisoner came into my shop and
bought some ribbon. I saw her secrete
this piece also. I personally knew her
and was on the most friendly terms with
her. When she left I accompanied her
and offered her. my arm which 6he ac
cepted We chatted together. As we
reached the corner of a street leading to
the Bow 6treet office, I turned toward it
She said she wa3 going in another direc
tion, and bade me good-morning. I said
"to her, No! you are going with me! I
saw you steal a piece of ribbon. She
immediately implored me for God's sake
to overlook it, and restored to me the
article. I said to her that I had lost
many things in this way, and was resolv
ed to make her an example that I was
determined to have 'her life." And he
got it. I can never forget how my blood
boiled as I read the- testimony of this
cold-hearted wretch. In view of the
judgment of a merciful God, far rather,
it seemed to me, would I have been iu
the place of that poor, frail, erring girl,
even on the scaffold, than in the place of
her heartless accuser.
"I rose from the perusal of these vol
umes, horror-struck with the continuous
record of inconceivable legal cruelt'. It
appears to me that the seventy thousand
hangings in the reign of Henry VIII.
were matched by an equally long list of
persons condemned to be "hung ia the
reign of George IIL Since that time
much has been done in England byRom
ily. Brougham, Mcintosh, and Sidnej'
Smith, and as much, perhaps more, by
kindred philanthropists on this side of
the Atlantic."

t;ret-k Itrifauds Outwitted by
Woman.
A story comes from Athens about
Greek brigandage very refreshing to hon
est people, and suggestive of the question
whether .women might not govern Greece
better than its men. One of the curses
of modern Hellas, as everybody knows,
is the unextirpated gnild of brigands,
who infest the land, defying the govern
ment, suppressing commerce, demoral
izing the peasantry, and robbing and
murdering strangersor rich natives. One
of these unhanged villains lately captur
ed the youthful son of a widow woman
of property, well known upon the bor
der. The usual message was sent down
from the hills : The brigand chief must
have one thousand drachmas by a cer
tain day, or the life of the boy he was
only twelve years old would pay the
forfeit. As usual, too, the last 'hope
which a mother could c herish in such a
frightful position was the chance of gov
ernment help. The wretchedly weak
administrations which play at "in and
out" in Athens still allow these scoun
drels to hold the roads and passes of the
country, and this poor woman had to
trust to her own courage and wits.
Neither were wanting ; there was some
true Odyssoan blood iii her. and she hit
upon a plan for saving loth her hild
and her drachmas. She had a brother,
a young fellow of perfect pluck, though
his cheeks were as smooth as the Delian
Apollo's, and him she dressed up care
fully as a Gr."ek girl. Having appoint
ed to meet the robber chief in a certain
spot, she took up two hundred drachmas
and a present of cakes and fruit, the
"Greek girl" going with her as a "guide."
On reaching the place they found the
scoundrel waiting, with the raptive
lad bound hand and foot beside him.
The woman first ascertained by cunning
questions that the man was really alone,
and then offered, with many supplica
tions. Ler money and the present of
rakes and fruit. The villain took the
latter and munched it while he counted
out the drachmas ; then, with a fierce
oath, he said it was far too little that
t-he must go back and send enough to
make up a thousand, or the head of the
lad would be sent to her without delaj-.
While the woman clung supplicating
to his knees, the "Greek gir" suddenly
flung a grip of iron round the robber's
arms, and, as the fellow was thus pin
ioned, the outraged mother drew a load
ed pistol and shot him dead. The pair
lost no time in liberating the lad, nor did
they forget to cut off and wrap in a cloth
the head of the "chief," and, as a re
ward of three thousand drachmas had
been 6et upon this precious article, the'
made quite an excellent day's business
of it, on arriving safe and sound at their
own village.
Germany. The official journals at
Berlin, concur in assuring Europe that
the German Government will respect the
will of France in the choice of a form
of government and the election of states
men to carry it on. It has not the slight
est P3'inpathy or partizanship for either
Thiers or the assembby. Gen. Manteuffe
commanding the German army of occu

however, to concentrate forces in case
of certain contingencies. In the lower
