Tbe President's Message.
We pubireli on the outside of this
week's issue, the Annual Message of
President Lincoln. 1. It is jell written,
proving at onoa that it is not tho produc
tion of Mr. Lincoln. There are no
plebeian expressions or childish jokes in
it as were found in his first Message.
I He J'goes in" for the Publio debt and
National Bank system. He also urges
the immediate amendment of the Consti
tution so as to abolisn slavery throughout
the United ' States; 'forgetting that he
said in his Inaugural Address that it was
not his purpose nor had he aiiy right, to
interfere with alavery. He declares with
out any attempt .whatever to prove the
same, "tht no attempt' at negotiations
with the Confederates would result in any
good." He thinks that a vigorous pros
ecution of the war the only means by
which a Settlement of the national diffi
culties can be effected. He further says
in regard to the slavery question, that "I
retract nothing heretofore said aa to ela
very ;" .also, "I shall not attempt to re
tract or modify the Emancipation Procla
mation," even if the Union can be re
stored thereby!- In this respect the mes
sage is radical and can afford no, lope to
the many who looked for some measure
to be introduced by which a termination
of hostilities on the part of the Govern
ment misht be brouzht about. In other
respects there is but little feeling shown
and the President seems to intimate that
arbitrary power is placed within his hands
for another four years and it shall be his
purpose to exercise it as he may see
proper. ,
' We deem further comment unneeces
sary, as all, reading for themselves, can
see the corruption of the Administration
and make such criticisms as tcey . may
think just. : ( .. ,
THE WAR.
; .The war news of the past week has
been meager. Sherman s reported to
have been within 25 miles of Savannah,
Georgia, and movine on the city. . We
do not believe that he will attack Savan
nah, aa it is strongly fortified and well
defended, and such an attack would
entail so heavy a loss upon his armys
would destroy, its efficiency. Thus far,
Shubman's has met with very little op-
positioa, but wo. have reason to believe
that he will have to encounter and defeat
a large army Del ore ne eaa reach the
coast.,"..Th9 . Confederates have a large
number of troops in Georgia, and Sheb-
MAN 8 almost undisputed march thas a
deep significance. ' He is certainly in- a
very critical situation, and may be,, with
his entire army, "gobbled up."
Gen. Grant is expected to attack
Richmond soon. We do not believe that
the Confederate. Capital can be takeD.v
It ias been fortified antil it is now im
pregnable. ' Yet the American Butcher
will lead thousands' and tens of thousands
of brave men into the very jaws of death,
as he did in his fruitless attack upon that
city last spriD. ': , -
' The Federals claim a victory over the
Confederate 'force under Gen. Bates,
which attacked Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
The number of men murdered is small.
DUTY OF THE DEMOCRACY.
' Now, that the election is over and the
opposition successful, the Democracy
must not settle down and think there is
no more need of labor. No, there is a
mightv work to be done yet. There is a
country to 6ave from utter destruction
there are streams of. blood flowing from
the hearts ' of American, citizens that
must be stopped ; there is a murderous
civil war. existing in our land that is lay
ing waste the country, turning its snowy
cotton fields, laden with their rich pro-'
dugts, into fields of battle and reddened
with human gcre ; draining the treasury,
exhausting the resouces, spreading deso
lation far and wide over oociTprosperous
America, ' robbing our homes'lind .work
shops, destroying tho peace and happi
ness of our firesides and striking terror to
the hearts of mqthers'and wives, that
must soon be brought to a close, or nil
will be lost. There is a Constitution and
certain rights that were held sacred by
our forefathers, that have been disrespect
ed, spurned and trampled ' upon by a ty
rannical and corrupt Administration, that
must be re-established and protected, if
we would have peace, liberty : and inde
pendence again smile upon us as in days
gone by. All this remains to be done
by the . Democracy. It is, then, the
duty of Democrats to go boldly and fear
lessly xo work, and continue to cpread
their peace principles abroad, and like
Yallandigham, OtDS, and others, who
have felt the 'galling chains of despotism,
stand by the right, proclaim the truth
aod advocata itho true principles of De
mocracy, regardless of bolts and bare, or
banishment from the land of your fathers.
Stand by your rights. - Proclaim your
principles for they 'are the principles
that will restore peace, make glad the
sorrowful, bring back our sons and broth
ers,' and Bare our country from jrretriev

THE ASHLAND UNION,
THE "VICTORY AT IBANK-
' Vr.'-'-- iiir :;:
Thje Abolition papers have been claim
ing a! glorious victory over the Confeder,
ates at Franklin, Tennessee. Thia"vio-
tory," like many others, turns out to be
a disastrous defeat, as,we were informed
by. a gentleman who was there at the
time of . the bloody fray. He , says, that
the battle was terrible and the Federal
loss immense. Thus, thousands upon
thousands of brave men have been laid
low in'death. And for what r To com
pel the Southern people to abandon their
white man's Government, and submit to
Lincoln's Despotism. !
A few more such victories and another
draft will be ordered to drag more victims
to fill the, depleted ranks of Lincoln's
army, .
Tbe History of a. Iteslment.
A returned soldier gives a history of
one of the Connecticut regiments, the 8th.
It left the State three : years ago, with
1060 men: has been recruited - to the
number of 800 ; and when our informant
left, numbered only sixty men and one
officer I The number of votes cast from
all these Connecticut men, for President,
was only twenty ! How many hcunes in
the valleys of Connecticut have a vacant
chair for the manly forms that have
marched to this cruel war !
RAILWAY MATTERS.
Tlie Atlantic and Great West
ern Railway. . .
This remarkable enterprise has given
a new sign of its near approach to com
pletion, by tho running of a regular pas
senger train from Dayton to Akron,
which commenced on Monday the 21st
November, 1864. ..'A mixed train with-a
ooach attached has been passing to and
fro for some time but this has rather had
reference to the company's own business
than to the travel which might offer.
In no other case that we know of, and
we do net speak without soma familiarity
with the construction .of'tha roads in
Ohio, has' the work , of 1 road making
been brought to suoh a system of orderly
progress. - First came the 'grading gangs
to .finish up the earth works and along
with them worked the bridge builders,
putting in wooden bridges at all - places
where culverts of the larger size will be
needed. These timber structures aro a
measure of despatch and economy, -as
they serve to bringing the road into speedy
use, 'and then the' stone can be. brought
from, a distance 'more cheaply The tracfc
laying is a marvel of dispatch. A plat
form laden with, cross ties is pushed for
ward by hand to the end of the fails last
laid and the- ties are thrown off and
placed, .' this being withdrawn, another
wagon with the iron rails is . drawn for
ward by a trained horse which seems to
comprehend the whole matter, and takes
his place at the rear to draw - the -wagon
out again. . These rails are placed in line,
and are at once ready for another advatace
of ties and rails ; the spike drivers' are
following up apace and making all - firm.
Viewed from a neighboring housetop, the
road seemed to thrust itself along.
On most roads, the rails being down,
the trains; have commenced running, bnt
not so ontha Atlantic and Great West
ern, except with the ballasting trains,
which have been kept running with un
remitting dilligcnce, until tbe road is ia
complete order." 'Meantime, the needful
structures for engine stables, water tanks
and transfer warehouses are erected, and
completely finished In a tasteful manner.
And at the station in. Urbana we notice
a large coal statbe for the deposit of coal
and arranged at such height that the fuel
for the engines can be readily drawn into
die tender. As a sample of the orderly
system which will prevail it may be noted
that the clocfc at Meadyille is the stand
ard time for the whole' road and daily at
noon the precise time will be thlegtaphed
to every other station on the line. ' Such
evidences of care and forecast are a guar
antee to the public, of precision and safe'
ty in the running. of., trains, and this feel
ng of security is &' further guarantee of a
large return to the company in a constant
ly growing business. Urban Union.
- v-': ' ; - ' ' ''' V
Robbing The Government. '
' We have been struck with the silence
the P.epublican papers maintain over the
recent heavy robberies at tbe Navy Yard,
Philadelphia. . If any of the kind takes
place under a Democratic Administration,
they are never done yellinpr over it, and
they even yet try to make capital from
Floyd s peculation. iiut they are entire'
lv oblivious to the rascality of their own
friends. The recent case ia the Navy
Yard id a flagrant one. It is thought
Government property to the value of
million of dollars has been carried off by
the employees of the yard. .They unload
ed whole cargoes of copper before the
vessels reached the yard, and that and
other articles were bauled away in Gov
ernment carts. One man, of his share
of the proceeds bought a fine farm in
Montgomery county, and was erecting
house on it at an expense of 40,000. It
is said that several officials are implicated
in these rascalities. From tbe , effort
made by certain, parties to conceal the
guilty and shield them from punishment,
it is impossible to arrive at tho. whole
truth of the matter. '
We oall the attention of the Republi
can' papers to these things, and ask them
to denounce "this wholesale robbery.
