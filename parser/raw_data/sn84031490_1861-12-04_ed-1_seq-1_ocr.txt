THE PRESIDENTS 2IESSACE.
The reader of the Message will lie sure
o run liis eye hastily over its first half—-the
;sual account of the condition of our for-
ugn relations, &c. —to come upon that
theme which now occupies the thoughts
and taxes the ingenuity of every* man in
the land—the relation of the slavery Ques
tion to the War. If he is loyal, preferring
the preservation of the Union and the vin
dication of the Constitution to all else, he
will bo gratified by the position that the
President has assumed. It is, in our own
language and in brief, this:
I have olxycd and executed such laws as
Congress has made.
If Congress should deem it wise to pass
a new and more comprehensive act for con
fiscating the property (slaves) of rebels, I
will assent to it.
The Union must be preserved at nil haz
ards; uud to preserve it, if Slavery must
e.'. let it go.
VTc must not be in haste to say that ex
traordinary measures must be adopted; but
when the necessity for such is apparent, let
us have them.
Such is our reading of the few and preg
nant sentences in which the bearing of the
Slavery question upon our national affairs
is discussed. These assertions and the cog
nate recommendation that the confiscated
Macks be colonized In some place of genial
climate, at the expense of the Government,
:ire the sum total of what our Chief Magis
t rate has to say. TVo are not disappointed :
nay. the President, always loyal, always
earnest, far-sighted and sincere, has gone
beyond the bounds which, mentally, we
had marked out as those within which
hh recommendations would be confined-
In that atmosphere at Washington
where the influence of the old regime is net
dead, where the worship ol man-selling
v,"as. until the incoming of the Republican
Administration, a pari of every platform
and every creed, where slaveiy has reigned
v. iiliout question of its supremacy in the
.!flairs of the Church and Slate, there was
a chance, made more dangerous by the po
of ihc officers of the regular army, the
il.-nluful position of a part of the Cabinet,
and awant of complete comprehension of ihe
>pirit cf the people, that the real sentiments
i.:‘ the President would be suppressed:
and that the hopes of the lighting masses
which point to the final employment of all
*hv rightful agencies that may be invoked
pm down rebellion, and to the removal
*-f the cause of the strife, would be disap*
i inu-d. The danger has been surmounted*
r The cautious language which dir. Lincoln
f inploy*, docs not hide from u«, who know
die deep moral convictions of the man, the
purpose that lie has in view, nor the holy
hm«*. which he must fed, of that giant in
iquity that has at last brought war and
d-- htiltin inu. this land. He has
i< me. if not fully up to our advanced posi
d >ll. at least within, easy hail of those who
have been looking anxiously back to see
what progress he would make. Congress
will lake him at Ids word. The members
of iluit body, if wc may judge by what has
transpired already, will interpret his mean
ing in a way ■tfith which we even shall he
< o:i‘-vnt. Looking out from the porch of the
Caphol, uvi-r the heads of one hundred and
fifty thousand men who defend the ap
pr< aches *e> the viw. against an enemy that
b animated and impelled by Slavery; Icg-
Ihaing within heating of rebel drums
which call the insurgent masses to a cam-
for tl;c destruction of flic
Couslitution, that Slavery may rule;
daily witnesses of the atrocities to
which Slavery resorts, and of tire almost
superhuman efforts tiiat flic people itavc
l,een compelled to put fortji to guard against
it? attacks; cognizant in their daily walks
of the l.rutalizing effects of Slavery tip
on those v, ho are brought within its
r. arli, it would be an assault upon
their patriotism and sincerity and Chris
tianity to say that, confining themselves
within the limits that the Constitution
prescribes, they will not deal this monster
ablnw./cr the Union's safe, that will send
it a long way toward its death. In some
wav nr another, completing prejudice and
harmonizing differences, they will. IV c
know not what form their legislation will
take; but of this we are assured, and the
Hessatre is a warrant for what we say, that
in till! deliberate action of the Representa
tives of the People,the President will gladly
acquiesce.
And so we make progress. One after an
other the difficulties in the way of a glo
rious and enduring triumph go down be
fore tlie expressed will and firm determina
tion of the people. Thus our reverses and
defeats, galling and mournful though they
have be.-lt, are turned to the gloty of the
< ante. Thus the sentiment of Human Lib
<ny. which, thank God! slavery has not
i .o. n abh-tocnt-diotn, gathers new strength
and vitality. IVe foresee the end, perhaps
a l.imr way off, to he reached only through
toil ;.mi blood, and after a struggle that
skail forever be a conspicuous landmark in
the history of the world—a Republic with
out a traitor or a slave.
Tins MISSOURI HEGIRA.
Just now our Slate is receiving a large
;jci-csrinn to our population from ourtm
liappy fritter State of Missouri. They are
pouring in upon us by hundreds every
week, the refugees driven from their homes
and leaving their all, in their haste to
rsf-ajK; from the frightful evils of rapine and
murder, initiated by the inhumes of Claib.
Jackson, and now deliberately proposed in
the recent proclamation of Gen. Price. The
Missouri reliel leaders, and those conspiring
with them to fasten the State in the fetters
of the rebellion, have lost all humanity, and
from the semblance of soldiers have come
down to the role of blood thirsty robbers
if and malignant ruffians,
g The alarm among the people of Missouri
1 h immense, and thousands are fleeing be
’■ y< .ml the borders to sock homes in the free
; Bbitf-s. Mark this, that few if any who are
not a<-*ivc co-workers with the rebellion go
.. Southward. They would not do this were
g ihc difficulties of so doing even less than
i they arc: even rebel leaders farther South
thuve placed their wives and families in
the shelter of Northern communities. In
:S Flint-lively il is recognized that the only
M fcufc refuge is fur without the shadows of
% the great prison house now shaking with a
H moral earthquake.
: j Whal is the duty of our own State and
iM lowa to these refugees? The au
'% fewer springs to even' lip. They must be
iS aided, helped, and that generously. In
H communities so located as to receive these
unhappy visitors most numerously, sys-
H lesnutic aid should be poured in from other
sections. Let Chicago give a
5 her response to tins humane call, madtinjnrlm
M minenl and pressing by the vicissxtudLus mf
1 the season. We make the proposition' •“*
|1 in behalf of our citizens, our large-hearK-u
--# Mk. Cou.ter be gent to mate a direct in
.ll vesiigation as to ihc number and needs of
la refugee from Missouri. All who rc
■|i rncm l JtT this gentleman's thorough work in
■ja the aid of the sufferers by the Great Tor
<Si nado, and the fitness he has demonstrated
< for missions of Has class, will agree that he
is the man for the work. Let Chicago send
him at once to learn the necessities of the
unhappy fugitive families from Missouri.
VOLUME XV.
ora WASHINGTON bETTEB.
The interesting letter from "Washington,
found on the second page, is from Sir.
Horace White, who has been editorially
connected with this paper for several years.
Mr. White will remain at the Capital dur
ing the present session of Congress, and
correspond for the ThibovE. His letters
will prove entertaining and instructive.
He is no trimmer or compromiser, but one
who believes that to go straight forward in
the path of duty is always politic; that the
right is ever expedient. And in that spirit
he will write.
A MILITARY COURT.
Judge Freese, at Alexandria, in his ca
pacity of Provost Marshal, struck the right
vein in the adjudications in his Military
Court touching lawful claims of loyal
creditors of rebels. All that was lacking
was an official sanction of similar functions,
which may thus establish Military Courts
throughout all portions of Secessia, wher
ever the Federal arms extend, and wherever
the rebels themselves have crushed out the
ordinary courts. This temporary substi
tute forms one of the excellent recommen
dations of the Message.
THE SUPREME COURT.
That some modification has long been
necessary in the system of the Supreme
Court, has long been felt by prominent ju
rists and by intelligent men of all political
creeds, and the recommendation of Mr.
Lincoln, which will inaugurate such desired
improvement, constitutes one of the most
important features of his Message. Of
the three several modifications suggested,
the last we think will be most likely to com
mend itself to adoption, dispensing alto
gether with the Circuit Courts, and leaving
the judicial function wholly to the District
•Couit and to the Supreme Court at the
Capitol.
WELIi DONE, NEW YORK.
Thc reform of this better age of ours is
beginning at the great centres. New York
yesterday made a political funeral necessary
for Fernando Wood. She has now a Slay
er who combines, with all the private vir
tues of a citizen, the skill and business sa
gacity tliat will do her sterling service in
the municipal office. George Opdykc is
Mayor of New York. She never had a
better nor truer man in the Mayoralty.
AN ENCOURAGING TOKEN.
It is a glorious proof of the increasing
humanity -of the age, that a President of
the United States has recommended the
recognition of two young nationalities com
posed of free men of color. The light is
dawning upon the colored race, in a move
ment like this, which recommends the es
tablishment of formal relations between
this Government and IXayli and Liberia.
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
The Board of Supervisors arc now con
vened in what, wc beg these gentlemen will
remember, must prove the most important
session ever held by any similar representa
tivesofCook county. Neverbeforehasthe
treasury been assailed by so many pressing
and actual claims, and inevitably it wil prove
to tax payers an expensive cm, that to be
covered by the action of their present ses
sion. A false or indiscreet selection of
men, a yielding to log rolling and chicane
in awarding the few places to be filled, will,
if a mistake be made, cost the county many
thousands of dollars. We write Jiot .to fur
ther the interests of any one, for wc have
no favorites in the matter, but wc ask the
Board of Supervisors to make careful and
honest selections of men that are to fill the
positions of County Agent and Warden of
the Poor House for the coming year, for
these positions will, from the existence of
the war and present business depression,
involve grave and responsible duties.
On the Inside. —On the second and third
pages will be found the President’s Message;
an interesting editorial review of the proposed
Canal Enlargement; an important and press
ing appeal in behalf of unhappy refugees from
the reign of terror in Missouri; au array of
facts against Gen. George H. Thomas, in com
mand at Camp Dick Robinson, Kentucky;
and a variety of interesting miscellaneous
mutter, much of which has timely reference
to the Great Rebellion.
From Cheat mountain) Va.
Mr. C. K. Scnddcr, of Lafayette, -lud., who
has returned from a visit to Cheat Mountain,
says the road between Webster and Hutton
ville, sixty-two miles, is lined with the wreck
i*f Government wagons and dead horses. Six
miles a day is the average travel for a four
horse wagon, although a six-horse team with
a load of straw hats might be equal to seven or
eight miles. Sutlers arc compelled to pay
twenty dollars per day for six-horse teams.
The snow is fifteen inches deep on Cheat
Mountain.
Only Two States Left,
The National flag now floats over the soil of
every seceded State except Alabama and Ar
kansas. In Virginia it floats over onc-third of
the State; in North Carolina, at Hatteras In
let ; in South Carolina, at Port Royal and a
half-dozen neighboring Islands; in Georgia,
on Tybee Island: in Florida, at Key West,
Santa Rosa Island and other points; in Missis
sippi. at Ship Island; in Louisiana, atChande
leur Island; in Texas, at El Paso; and in Ten
nessee, at Bristol, Elizabeth! own, and other
points in the eastern part of the Stale.
A Doubtful Unionist.
Colonel Scgnr. the claimant for a scat in Con
gress from the Fortress Monroe district of Vir
ginia, is understood to be a conditional Unionist,
boldine the position that if the Government at
tacks slavery, he will not support war measures.—
If. 3’. Tribune,
Col. Richardson, of the Quincy (DL) District,
presented the credentials of this quasi-scces
slonist, and asked to have liim sworn in. Ob
jections were promptly made. Wm. Kellogg,
of the Peoria District, made a speech, insist
ing on giving him a seat, which is not surpris
ing, as Segur is one of his own stripe of
Unionists,
pT The French have been relieved from,
their fears of famine, by a supply of two-tliirds
of the deficiency. The week previous to the
sailing of the last steamer, twenty-eight ves
sels arrived in Havre, from New York, with
400,000 sacks of wheat, 00,000 barrels of flour,
2,700 sacks of com, and 300 of rye, and con
siderable supplies are still expected.
X&T The Washington SepuWean notes it as
a sign of progress, that a letter from Lexing
ton, Kentucky, says that Joe Holt, of Ken
tucky, is getting sick of the business of pro
tecting the property of pro-slavery traitors and
rebels, and says that the war must take its
course, even If It be across the “peculiar in
stitution.”
j3f“Gen. Fremont attended service a 1
Henry Ward Beecher’s Church, on Sunday
last, and the congregation rose m mane as the
General and Mrs. Fremont entered. Mr.
Beecher’s discourse was on “Greatness.*’ Af
ter the service the people made a rush for the
General’s pew, and detained him half an hour
with hand-shaking; and when he was seated
in his carriage, at the church door, they
crow ded the street and gave him three cheers.
The election of George Opdykc as
Mayor of New York, is a hopeful indication of
, reform in the badly mamiged municipal affairs
of that city. We hope he has a good Board of
Aldermen. He had a good ticket in the field
wi:hbim,a* will be appreciated when it is,
known that Samuel B. Buggies, well known
for his interest in the Eric Canal, was one of
the candidates.

but remains with the gallant East Tennessee
troops in Kentucky, to cheer them by his per
sonal presence, to see that all their wants arc
supplied, and to accompany them when they
advance to drive the rebel invaders from their
homes. Also, John 8. Phelps, of Springfield,
Mo., will not take his seat in Congress, at
present, if at. ail tliis winter, having duties
that are quite as important as commander of a
regiment of his loyal neighbors.

CgT Geo. Opdyke, the telegraph informs us,
is elected Mayor of New York; a great tri
umph, indeed, and still greater if the follow
ing be true—a single selection from a large
pile of abuse in the scw York Herald:

on election day, and vote for some other man for
Mayor.
The oyster trade of New York annual

Whereabouts of Zolllcofler.
[Louisville Correspondence of tte Cincinnati Com*
merciaL, Dec. Ist.]
The rebel chieftain, Zollicoffer, has had al
most as much uncertainty of location in the
eves of newspaper readers, during the last
two months, as the notorious Jeff. Thompson.
Since his retreat to the fastnesses of the Cum
berland Gap, particularly, rumor has had him
in succession at half a dozen different points.
As early as ten days ago it was believed at
headquarters in this city that he had joined his
command to the main body of the rebel array
under Gen. Johnston, and that it formed the
right wing of the same. I combatted this
belief at 'the time in my army corres
pondence, and positive information arrived
here vesterdav removes, at last, all doubts
as to' his recent movements and present
whereabouts. In accordance with orders
received previous to the uprising of the East
Tennessee Unionists, he fell hack from the
Gap, after leaving a small force, comprising
about one-third bfhis brigade, to dispute the
rumored advance of the Federals, and ar
rived at Knoxville about twelve days ago.
His troops were in a deplorable concition—
clad in rags, half-starved, and almost with
out transportation. But nevertheless he made
but a short rest at Knoxville, and the bridge
burning on the East and Georgia
railroad having made transportation by rail be
tween Knoxville and Nashville slow and tedi
ous, he marched overland through Boane,
Morgan, Fentress and Overton counties,Tenn.,
via Kingston and ’ Montgomery, aboutt a
week ago,and has since pushed onward through
Albany'and Monticello, Wayne county, and ac
cording to the latest accounts, had even cross
ed the Cumberland, and was making for James
town, Bussell county.

Washington, December 3,1661.
Advices from Fortress Monroe bring a de
nial of the Government dispatches received
from Richmond on Monday, that the rebel
Capital had been removed from Richmond to
Nashville. Spies say that intense excitement
was caused at Richmond by the decision, and
this may have caused the change in purpose.
There arc from 15,000 to 30,000 troops at
Richmond.
Eight thousand five hundred men from Fitz
John Porter’s, Smith’s, and McCall’s Divisions
to-day attempted to cut off the body of about
2,000 rebel cavalry who have recently, from

of property confiscated, after payment of ex
pense, and just claims of loyal creditors, to be
applied to the reimbursement of loyal citi
zens despoiled of theirproperty by the rebels,
and the balance to paying the expenses of
suppressing insurrection.
The rebel owners of slaves arc to forfeit all
their rights to them, the negroes to become free,
and it is made the duty of the President to
provide for their colonization so far as they
may be willing to go in some tropical country,
where they can have the protection of the
Government, and be secured in their rights as
freemen.
The Senate will order a committee of in
quiry whether disloyal persons occupy sente

St. Lons, December 8,1881.
A gentleman from Rolla states that the or
der against fugitive slaves enteringcampis not
observed there, the colored contrabands being
treated os strange white persons are, neither
allowed more liberty or restricted to less. The
blacks, dismissed by Hallcek’e order, arc just
outside the lines, and that is alt They could
easily get in again if pursued by rebel owners.
Gen. Pope Is in command at Syracuse, and
Sherman at Sedalia. The latter retains the
gruff manner noticed In Kentucky.
There was trouble in Col. Olmstead’s Ger
man Home Guard Regiment, to-day, caused
by an attempt to transfer them to the State
service. There was talk of mutiny and several
companies were ordered to load, to repress it.
But the difficulty was adjusted by a suspension
of the transfer till further investigation.
The river is full of ice to-day. All the

Adjourned.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
The President's Mcssagewos read.
Mr. MAYNARD, of Tenn., presented the
credentials of Mr. Clemens, a Representative
elect from the Fourth District of Tennessee.
He briefly related the circumstances under
■which the election was held, saving that three
members were elected in East Tennessee, men
who declare for the National Constitution and
for the flag under which they had hoped to
die.
On motion, the credentials were referred to
the Committee on Elections.
On motion of Mr. WASHBURNE, of HI.,
the President’s Message was referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the State of the
Union, and his motion for printing 50,000
extra copies was referred to the Committee on
Printing.
Mr. DUNN, of Ind., offered the following:
Whereas. Henry C. Burnett, a member ot this
Donee from Kentucky, is in open rebellion against
the Government of the United States, therefore,
Mecolvtd. That the sn'd Henry C. Burnett be and
he is hereby expelled from this House, and that
the Governor of Kentucky be notified of his ex
pulsion.
Jlcfolral, That the Scrgcant-at-Arms be directed
not to pay Burnett's salary which has accrued
since the close of the extra session.
Mr. WICKLUTE, of Ky., saldhc had intend
deto prepare and submit a proposition some
thing like an obituary notice 01 bis colleague.
[Laughter.] The latter was not, as the reso
lution asserted, in armed rebellion, but heads
a provisional government in Kentucky—a
revolutionary convention. Not satisfied with
the treatment of this Government to maintain
the Union, nor satisfied with the course of his
own State, he (Burnett) has assumed the im
portant duty of organizing another govern
ment for the tender protection of the lives,
property, and liberty of the people of Ken
tucky, ‘and in this undertaking employed
Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat
aesimnlated in name but In the deeds
of Simon Gueltercz, who once headed the In
dians in Ky. Three times has the gallant State
of Kentucky declared by overwhelming ma
jorities, she would not leave the United
States to run after strange gods or for the so
called “Southern Republic.” Notwithstanding
berrepcated declarations for the Union, and in
violation of the well known sentiments of'tlic
people of Ky., they had been told the object
of the Convention and of the so-called South
ern Confederacy was to relieve them from a
despotism and to protect their rights. And
we were deceived; we were told by the Ex
ecutive of this so-called Southern Confederacy
it was intended to respect the condition of
Kentucky, which it was pretended would not be
donebv the Government of the United States.
The Union men of Kentucky never did deny
the right of the Federal Government to occu
py its soil for the exercise of the purposes im
plied by the Constitution. Kentucky did ac
knowledge her obligations, and expressed her
intention to fulfill them. The proclamation
of the Governor of Kentucky deceived the
people, but the Legislature denounced it.
Two messages of peace were sent to the Exec
utive of the United States, and one to the
President of the Southern Government, to
know what was intended to be done with
Kentucky. The former said it was intended
to maintain thehxwand the Constitution, and
that this was believed to be the will of the
people of Kentucky. The latter declared that
he intended to respect the neutrality of Ken
tucky as understood by tbe secession party of
the Skate, but the Southern President did not
tell them he had matured a plan to
assail them at the different points, nor
did he tell them there was on the
statute book of the Southern government
a law-_providing money and means, not to sus
tain Kcntucky'ag.iinst oppression but to carry
her into tbe Southern Confederacy against a
majority of two-thirds of the entire State.
The present provisional Governor of Ken
tucky was sent to sec the government at
Richmond. Meanwhile, Burnett is at the head
of the new order of allairs, in the discharge of
his duty, and an armed force has been gathered,
composed of young, desperate, reckless men,
commanded by Buckner. In conclusion, Mr.
Wiekliffesaid: “With the blessing of God, I
predict that bv the 25th of December no rebel
loot will be found on the soil of Kentucky.”
[Applause.]
The resolution for the expulsion of Burnett
was adopted. Adjourned.
From Washington.
Washington, Dec, S. —This morning the
pickets of Gen. Blehker’s brigade were at
tacked, at Annandalc, by a party of secession
cavalry, who came across our men very unex
pectedly. Sharp firing took place, and the re
sult was, one rebel was killed and two wound
ed and taken prisoners.
A most important order will soon be issued
from Headquarters, informing the Governors
of the several free States that no more regi
ments, batteries, or indeperdent companies,
must be raised or received by them, except
upon the requisition of the War Department.
The regiments, &e. , now forming, will be com
pleted, unless it shall be deemed more advan
tageous to the service to assign the men al
ready raised to incomplete organizations actu
ally in the field.
General Superintendents of the volunteer
and recruiting service will be appointed for
all Stales, and recruiting in each will be direct
ed upon the system pursued iu the reguhtr
army These* Superintendents will be offi
cers* of the regular army—retired officers, if
possible, or officers of artillery not serving
m the field. Depots for the collection and
instruction of recruits, under the command
of the Superintendent, will be estab
lished •at the following places, and
such other as shall be considered
advantageous in each of the States.
Those in the "West "are: Minnesota, Fort
Snclling; lowa, Davenport; Wisconsin, Mad
ison; Missouri, Jefferson City or Benton Bar
racks; Michigan, Detroit; Illinois, Spring
field ; Indiana, "Indianapolis; Ohio, Columbus,
Kentucky, Louisville. The enlistment papers
of the volunteers will be the same as for reg
ulars. Clothing will be issued to them at the
State depot. Commanders of regiments in the
field, wanting troops, will make requisitions
directly on the Superintendents for their re
spective States. No more cavalry will be ac
cepted by the Government, and it is the pur
pose of the Commanding General to muster
out of the scrviceall cavalry recruits in incom
plete regiments, unless they will consent to
come in as infantry.
The number of the cavalry already amounts
to between sixty and seventy thousand—much
more than the Government can use.
Information has been received here that one
clause iu the treaty with the Mexican Govern
ment provides for a loan of £10,000,000 by our
Government, to be famished in five annual
sums of $2,000,000 each, in return for the mer
cantile advantages and transit of U. S. troops
through Mexican territory.
Gen. McClellan is understood to have made
the most urgent presentation to the President
in favor of a regular and systematic exchange
of prisoners, fie will probably succeed m
having his views approved and acted on.
There has been no advance of rebel pickets
upon our lines, as has been stated. On the
contrary, our pickets have advanced into the
enemy’s country. .. _ ,
McCall is moving towards Leesburg, and
Gen. Smith and Gen. Porter arc extending
their lines forward, while McDowell and
Franklin are watching the enemy’s centre,
which is growing weaker and weaker every
day.
I am enabled to state in the most positive
manner, that the struggle is over, and that the
President’s conservative policy is sustained by
' his Cabinet with entire unanimity.
No flag has been flying from the rebel bat
teries on the Lower Potomac for some time,
until a few days since, when the Southern
Confederacy flag wasnnforled, and it is now
displayed all along their Imc.
Secretaries Cameron and Seward were sere
naded to-night, but only the latter appeared.
He simply complimented the music, and sta
ted that in tea days tho country would rejoice
at great news...

Repfcv&d Skirmish near Chilllcolhe
—■Movements in the Southwest.
Si layers, Doe. 3.—Passengers by the
North Missouri train report that It is rumored
along thg road that an lowa regiment and a
force ofrcbels under CoL Stein had met near
Cbillicojiic,where a sharp skirmish took place,
resulting In the rout of the rebels. It needs
confirmation. Stein with his band are known
to be somewhere in tliat neighborhood.
Advices from Rolla, datcd’Deccmber 2, say
that two scouts arrived there from Springfield,
and report that they heard on the road that
McCulloch, after going a short distance south
ward, turned his course to the east for Iron
ion, or, as some thought, for Pocohontas, in
Northeastern Arkansas. Afterward it was re
ported that he had passed four miles south of
that place.
Capt. Washburn, of the Ninth lowa, and
CoL Vandcvcr, stationed at Franklin, left Sul
livan on Thursday, with twenty men, on a
scouting expedition to the Southwest. They
followed up the Brazile river, and had a sharp
skirmish with a party of rebels, taking all of
them prisoners.
Col. Gustavos A. Smith, of the 35th Illinois
regiment, is reported quite ill.
A gentleman who left Osceola last Saturday
states that Price’s army, at that place, is not
over five thousand men. A large number of
his troops hud left him, or been sent of by
him, and gone to the Missouri river counties.
Those at Osceola were in a destitute condi
tion, ami suffering greatly for want of clothing
and provisions.

AcccOuts of Federal itovements.
Washington, Dec. 2.—Tnc Richmond Hr-
of Friday, he 20th ult., contains the
following telegrams:
Chakleston, Thursday, Nov. 3-S.—A courier
who arrived this morning, says that a skirm
ish took place near Buckingham on Saturday
last, between the Confederates and Union
invaders. The Unionists attempted to laud,
but were driven off One of our men was
slightly wounded by a shell. It is
reported that the enemy lauded yester
day at Bennett’s Point, at the mouth of the
Aehebo river. Four Union steamers shelled
Atto Island, north of St. Helena, on Monday,
and then landed. They now hold entire pos
session of St. Helena' Sound. A number of
lights passed our bar on Monday niirht. and it
is presumed that the Union fleet were eu route
South.
Savannah, Nov. 2S.—The papers of this
morning state that Fort Pulaski yesterday
threw a few shot and shell at the camp of the
Federate on Tybee Island, which caused a
Bull Run stampede to safer quarters. There
are now nix Union vessels inside the bar, and
five outride.
Ltkcubvrg, Ya., Nov. 2S.—Floyd’s com
mand expects to go into winter quarters at
Peterstown, Monroe county. The roads are
almost Impassable, and it is thought neither
the Yankees nor ourselves can accomplish
anything until next Spring.
Baltimore, Dee. 3.—The boat from Old
Point has. arrived. The following items are
gathered from Southern papers.
The reported removal of the Capital from.
Richmond to Nashville is incorrect.
The Southern press is advocating the abol
ishing of the elective franchise.
The latest advices from Pensacola, represent
that the fight had not occurred. Accounts say
that had the fight continued, Fort Mcßca
M ould hare been destroyed. No particulars
of the affair are given.
The planters throughout the Southern sea
board are represented to be destroying tbeir
stocks, lest they should fidl into the hands of
the Yankees.
A cor-piracy of Unionists had been discov
saud iivsNew Orleans, causing jejc*£ excite
ment there. Mony arrests Imd been made.
Friendly Feeling of Spain.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The Madrid CSmwj-
recently received here,
contains the Following paragraph, which shows
the friendliness of feeling existing be
tween the Spanish Government and the Church
parlv of Mexico:
“Yesterday took place the long announced visit
to her Majesty, the Queen, by General Miramou.
Ex-President of Mexico. Our august cousin re
ceived him with her usual amiability, as also did
the Kin?, her husband, who was seated at her side.
The conversation lasted for more than a quarter of
an hour.”
From intelligent sources, it seems there is
some foundation for the report that Queen Is
abella has made a secret treaty with the Empe
ror Napoleon, oedinghim the Volcanic Islands,
provided he will assist her in her designs
against Mexico.
Proposed Law against Returning Fa*
gltlve Slaves.
New York, Dec. 3.—Special dispatches state
that a resolution will be offered in the House
punishing any officer of the army for returning
fugitive slaves to their masters.
F. P. Stanton still claims the scat occupied
by Jim Lane in the Senate.

Adger at Baltimore.
Baltimore, Dec. 3. —The steamer James

Movements of McCulloch and Price in
Southwest Missouri.
The Kolia correspondent of the St. Louis
Democrat writes, December Ist:
The rebels, on their march from Springfield
to the Osage, were hurried up by a rumor that
the Federal forces were crossing the White
river into Arkansas, for the purpose of cutting
oil their rear. Hence the burning and devast
ation which was made of the conrtry, in order
to discommode the former, and prevent its oc
cupation by the "Unionists. Col. Clarkson left
Springfield on Sunday, 34th, for Osceola,
bringing up the rear.
It is well settled that McCulloch refuses to
co-operatc with the redoubtable Price. The
former was heard to remark, -“Price has gone
north cn another bell-trip, and may go alone.*’
A gentleman who called on McCuHochat Mr.
Graves’s house, his headquarters while in
Springfield, found the rebel General in a
moody state. He was reading, at the time, a
copy ’of the Missouri RepuWcan of the 16th
nit.* and appeared absorbed with Us contents.
He had taken much pains to send for the pa
■ icr. McCulloch when last heard of was at
! Little Tork, headed in the direction of Arkan
sas. McCulloch has a “Col. Jim Lane” in
his division, from Marshall, Harrison county,
Texas. The party of Texas Rangers under
Col. Stone, who visited Lebanon, joined Mc-
Culloch the day he left. McCulloch's troops
consisted of five regiments of cavalry, with
out tents.
It was stated that 5,000 rebel Indians were
moving north to the west of Fort Scott, to
act in "conjunction with Price. One of the
rebel officers (Livingston) had returned from
an expedition, and made his brags that he had
hung thirteen and shot thirteen more k ‘Union
abolitionists, and sent them to .”
A friend, who has a copy of Price’s proc
lamation, deems the publication injudicious.
He says the publication by the Union papers
of liis documents is precisely what Price
wishes. He alludes to the term of service
about to expire of many of his men, calls for
‘recruits, and boasts of the achievements
already made over the Federal forces, with
scant supplies and a deficient military chest.
The train is on the move.
The BKlssonri Hegira.
[From the Missouri Democrat, Dec. 3d.]
The fact that a number of destitute and suf
fering families, refugees from the southwest
counties of Missouri, where Price’s plundering
and thieving army are devouring the substance
of the inhabitants, have within the last few
days arrived in this city, with the little house
hold goods they had saved from the general
waste and destruction, has already been an
nounced. Yesterday a stronger illustration
was given of the amount of suffering, depriva
tion and misery, and the extent of desolation
and utter poverty now existing among the
families of all that region. Twenty or
thirty families, consisting of worn
down, suffering and apparently ruined
men, half-clothed, cold, hungry and woebe
gone women and children, drawn in creaky,
broken wagons, by half-starved mules and
oxen, following the almost worthless frag
ments of furniture and goods they were able
to gather from their household wreokßj pre
sented a sad and moving spectacle. Their ap
pearancc was that of fugitives from destruc
tion. These people arc fleeing from starva
tion and death. Many of the families who
arrived in the city yesterday were provided
with quarters temporarily at the public lodg
ing house on Chcsiint street, between M*un
and Second streets. , .. .
* Through the generosity of the kind people
in the vicinity, the immediate wants of the
sufferers were supplied, but there still re
mains much to he done for them bj the chari
table. Contributions in clothing, hats, caps,
shoes, &c., for the little ones, dresses for
the grown females, would afford great relief
The Chief of Police has bee;n busy providing
for them, and has concluded .to keep them in
their present quarters *5, the expense of the
city, until tbey are better prepared to proceed
on their journey. The emigrants arc mostly
from Laclede county, and the neighborhood
of Springfield. They state that since the re
cent- battles in and near Springfield, they have
been deprived of nearly everythinir, and were
at List compelled to seek a llvmg'clscwhere.
They report that the road between here and
Springfield is. literally lined with destitute
: jimilics, who have also been forced to quit the
Slate. The majority of them arc on their way
to Sangamon county, Illinois.
If any of onr readers wish to see some of
the bitter results of the civil strife now going
on in this State, let them visit the apartment
we have named. A more heart-rending specta
cle is seldom presented. And such of our
kind citizens who desire to do a real act of
charity, have an opportunity in contributing
iheirmitc to the relief of the distressed families.
The Rebel Steamer Nashville,
[Correspondence of ths New York Herald.]
The Rebel steamer Nashville, flying the
the rebel flog, has arrived at Southampton.
She landed Captain Nelson and crew, twenty
nine in number, of the American ship Harvey
Birch. Captain Nelson reports that he left
Havre on the 17th instant, bound for
New York, in ballast; on the 19th was brought
to by the Nashville, who at once ordered the
Captain and crew on board the steamer allow
ing them to take a few of their effects and
fresh provisions. Captain Petrram then or
dered the Harvey Birch to be fired, and Lud
alongside till she burned to the water’s edge.
Captain Nelson immediately placed himself in
communication with Captain Bristow*, United
States Consul at Southampton.
The Nashville is still lying in the river, living
the rebel flag. Captain Nelson says that Com
mander Pegram states that he has no commis
sion from the Southern government as a war
steamer, yet declares it not a privateer. No
Southem'Comuiissioncrs arrived by the Nash
ville.
The whole crew ofthc Harvey Birch, except
the Captain, were placed in irons till the arri
val at Southampton. Exhortations were made
to induce the Captain and crew to take the
oath to the rebel government. Captain Pe
srram communicated with Mr. Yancey. The
Nashville will refit at Southampton.
