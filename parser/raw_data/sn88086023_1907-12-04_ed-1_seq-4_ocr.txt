Upon my country's scroll of

E'en though the records of the

In which I live bear not my

If I shall utter but one word
But sound one note In life's

SCOTTS RENUNCIATION.
Some of the papers of Oregon are
inclined to censure Editor II. W.
Scott, of the Portland Oregonlan, for
declaring his political Independence,
for forsaking the republican party
after 50 years of labor in its ranks.
The East Oregonlan is not so In
clined. It rather congratulates Mr.
Scott on having the courage to re
nounce old associates, to forsake old
I-aths.
It requires courage to make a sn
- cere change of wind, to pass out of
an old environment. The man who
has not experienced that sort of a
mental change Is no judge of its con-
ment upon such until he has been
tempered in the fire of experience.
The renunciation of H. W. Scott Is
all the more commendable and In
spiring, when It is considered that ho
is past middle age, a man of fixed
habits of thought and action, a man
of intense determination and sincere
convictions.
Very few men change either their
politics, religion or habits, of life,
after having passed middle age. The
ci.iiiviiiiiiii. J L jvuiii niiu J u lift
manhood takes deep root In the lives
of men and to renounce and forsake
associations and lines of thought fol
lowed clostly for half a century is a
triumph of mental strength and mor
&' courage which is not to be dis
paraged. That Mr. Scott walks out of the
republican ranks and declares him
self and his paper absolutely Inde
pendent hereafter, is triumph enough
for one life time. No man who has
never forsaken a cause in which he
has fought valiantly and long, though
deluded, can understand the mean
ing of his renunciation.
It costs something which the aver
age man cannot pay, to uproot the
old convictions in the mind and as
sume an entirely new attitude toward
life and its surroundings.
Harvey Scott has had the courage
to take the step and he will always
be glad of It. It Is a fitting act with
vhlch to crown a long career of vital
activity. His personality and his pa
per will wield a stronger influence
In Oregon, Independently, than they
have ever wielded as partisan in
strumentalities. THE ROOSEVELT DOCTRINE.
Summed up in a few words, the
Roosevelt doctrine as enunciated In
the president's message to congress,
, la as follows:
law enforcement for the trusts and
combinations; regulation and strict
control for the railroads; the di
vorcement of stock gambling from
the financial and commercial Interests
of .the country; punishment for dls
Lonest speculators who manipulate
the money supply to the detriment
of the nation; open rivers, not only
in the east and central states, but In
THE WEST; more government rec
lamation; more practical forestry de
velopment; public lands for actual
settlers; range leasing for the west;
strict and unfailing control of Inter
state commerce by the federal gov
ernment; more elastic currency; tar
iff reform when consistent ar.d prac
ticable; construction of the Panama
canal as quickly and cheaply as pos
sible; no grafting, boodling or cor
ruptlon In any government depart
ment; a government for the people,
free from sectional prejudice; the
highest possible development of edu
cation, citizenship and personal In
tegrity for every child In the nation
o strong hand for the support of
every deserving American Industry,
but the "big stick" for the grafter,
the parasite and the drone; enlight
ened independence, clean, wholesome
progress; fearless manhood and wo
manhood and sturdy personal honor
lii every man and woman of the na
tion.
Aside from the political recommen
dations of the president's message it
breaths a pure and wholesome spirit
of good citizenship, fearless man
hood and personal Integrity and Is a
sermon worthy of the man who wrote
it.
JIDGK FRAZERS DEATH.
What Pen Lindsay as Juvenile
Judge of Denver has been to the boys
of that city for the past decade. Judge
Arthur L. Frazer, Juvenile Judge of
Portland, was fast becoming to the
boys of that city a safe guide and
counsellor and a power for great
good.
Portland's Juvenile court had Just
been fairly started under the direc
tion of Judge Frazer when death re
moved that able and tender man. It
Is a misfortune not only to the er
ring boys who were learning to heed
his counsel and follow his direction,
but also to Jhe entire state of Ore
gon.
While another good man will
doubtless be selected to take the place
of Judge Frazer, yet death has
broken the chain which he had w;oven
about the unfortunate boys of the
city and another man will be re
quired to begin at the beginning, as
dJd Judge Frazer, and forge his
chain of confidence, link by link, a
work which had been already per
formed by Judge Frazer In a most
commendable manner.
It Is enough to say of Judge Fra
zer that he was loved by the boys
who had been brought before his Ju
venile court.
MONEY IS PLENTIFUL.
The true financial condition of
Umatilla county Is shown every day
In the volume of holiday trade which
Is being enjoyed by the merchants
and especially so by the good attend
ance and ready purchases at several
sales of farming Implements and
stock held In the county this week.
On Tuesday, within a few hours,
over $3000 worth of stock and Im
plements were sold at a public sale
in the north part of the county, a
large port of this sum being paid In
cash and the remainder In notes.
Bidding was spirited and prices
were excellent. Several horses were
sold at $225 each and other stock
in proportion. There was no hint of
the financial flurry, no pinching
down of prices or payments because
of any uneasiness or uncertainty as
to the money situation.
The East Oregonlan accepts this
as the true Index of the situation in
Umatilla county and unhesitatingly
announces that nothing better has
ever been offered anywhere as t
guarantee of confidence, prosperity
and stability.
NO LONGEH A FRONTIER.
The substantial character of coun
ty roads and bridges now being con
structed in Umatilla county is evi
dence that the county has passed out
of frontier conditions.

highways.
. The character of the county roads
It. also Improving from year to year.
It Is the Intention and aim of tho
county court to get the main roads
out of the gulches on higher ground
wherever possible, and thus do away
with washouts with every little rain
storm.
This work Is slow and costly, but
Is being kept within reasonable lim
its and Umatilla will soon be the best
equipped county In eastern Oregon
from the standpoint of roads and
bridges.
The horrible quadruple murder
near Salem Is looked upon by many
as nn evidence that the west Is be
coming more depraved than It was
formerly. As population Increases
crime will naturally increase, but the
proportion of crime to population Is
r.ot now nearly so great In the west
as In the east. It must be remem
bered that new people with their un
known and unknowable characterls
Istlcs are coming to the state on every
train and the bad Is developed as
well as the good, although not per
haps In the same proportion.
It Is laughable to hear the Pen
dleton Tribune beg the small school
children of the city, th third and
fourth graders, to do Its reporting for
a month. Why not let the little fel
lows write editorials, discuss state
ment No. 1 and Bryan and other
juicy editorial subjects?
THE TRUE AND THE UNTRUE.
He was a dog.
But he stayed at home
And guarded the family night
and day.
He was a dog
That didn't roam.
He lay on the porch or chased
the stray
The tramp, the burglar, the hen
away;
For a dog's true heart for thai
household beat
At morning and evening, In cold
and heat.
He was a dog.
He was a man.
And didn't stay
To cherish his wife and his chil
dren fair.
He was a man.
And every day
His heart grew callous, Its love
beats rare.
He thought of h'mself at the
close of day
And cigar In his fingers, hur
ried away
' To the club, the lodge, the store,
the show.
But he had a right to go. you
know;
He was a man.

SUIT HOUSE
BY IMPURITIES IH THE DL00D
If Old Sores were due to outside influences, or if the cause was confined
strictly to the diseased flesh around the ulcer, then external treatment and
simple cleanliness would cure them. But the trouble is in the blood, which
has become unhealthy and diseased, and keeps the sore open by continually
discharging into it the impurities and poisons with which the circulation is
filled. This poisonous condition of the blood may be the remains of some
constitutional trouble ; the effect of a long spell of sickness, or because the
natural refuse of the body, which should pass off through the proper avenues,
has been left in the system and absorbed iuto the blood. Again, the cause
may be hereditary ; but it does not matter how the poison becomes intrenched
in the blood, the fact that the sore will not heal is evidence of a deep underly
ing cause. Salves, washes, lotions, etc., may cause the place to scab over
temporarily, but the blood is not made any
PURELY VEGETABLE
discharging unhealthy matter into the place, it carries rich, tissue-building,
flesh-healing blood to the diseased parts and in every way assists in a natural
cure of the sore. Book on Sore9 and Ulcers and any medical advice free to

The thread trust announces net
profits of upwards of fifteen million
dollars for the past year. A divi
dend of 20 per cent together' with
an additional bonus of 10 per cent
will be paid stockholders.
Referring to these facts the Nor
folk (Va.) Virginian Pilot says:
"This doesn't ' look like the recent
advance of one cent a spool In the
price of thread w-as needed to enable
the trust to earn a fair and legitimate
return on Its Investment. But It does
strikingly illustrate the blessings of
our policy of Inordinate tariff pro
tection. Thirty per cent to the pos
sessors of 'swollen fortunes and tho
poor seamstresses pay the bill." The

formerly a stock broker, who drop

during the early spring.
One night, shortly after going to
bed, the Plttsburger was awakened
by strange signs. At first his no

hoarse voice. 'If you stir, you're a
dead man!" It said. "I'm looking
