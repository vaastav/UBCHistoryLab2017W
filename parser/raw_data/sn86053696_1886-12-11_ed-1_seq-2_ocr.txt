■ why Mr.
The President's message is an able
document, and highly commonded by
tbe press of the country. He advo
cates Tariff reform, and applauds tbe
Civil Service as applied under bis ad
ministration. The New York papers
express themselves on the subject of
the message substantially as follows :
Tbe Sun simply reviews the message
sjrnoptically, making slight comment.
Tbe Herald pronounces it "a truly and
soundly American State paper." The
Timet says it was "unpretentious, pat
riotic, alraight forward and business
like." The Tribune says it is not pre
cisely a great message, hut in the main
fairly sets forth the opinions of tbe
party which made Mr. Cleveland Pres
ident. The Star pronounces it "clear
and deciaive, complete and compre
hensive." The World admits that "it
is conceived in a patriotic spirit and
written with ordinary clearness."
Among Congressmen Mr. Morrison
says it is a better tariff document than
the first message, but tbat be is un
illing to talk about it. Mr. Carlisle
says it is sound aod able, teaches tree
Democratic doctrine and should satisfy
tariff reformers. Mr. Randall says it
is a good message. Mr. Cox says it is
admirable. Mr. Hollman says that the
silver and civil service portions don't
suit bis region of country, but that the
rest is sound. Messrs. Bland and
Weaver are disappointed at the repeti
tion of tbe coinage suspension recom
mendation. Mr. Springer says the
message is able. Mr. Reid thinks the
message is impracticable, aiming at
impossible benefits by impracticable
reforms. Senator Beck likes tbe mes
sage generally, but says tbe President
"cranky" on silver.
The Lynchburg Virginiati sounds
the key note to the success of the
South in the following well pointed re
marks : " The day has passed by
when the Sooth should indulge the
absurd prejudices which formerly ex
isted between the sections. We arc
one country and one people, with one
common interest uniting and binding
ns iudissolubly together. The man of
business is always cosmopolitan in hie
feelings as well as in his opinions.
The South is becoming better ac
quainted with the North and the
North with the South, and the result
is that each thinks better of the other.
Could we get rid of a few hundred
sectional and party agitators in each
State, it would be a happy day for tbe
whole country. These men, for their
own selfish purpose, are continually
agitating the people and exciting their
prejudices and passions to a greater or
leas extent, The day for these things
has passed and goiie forever, we hope.
The bnsiueas of this country cannot
be conducted npon any sectional basis,
and the man or men who attempt to
do it will make a signal failure."
When the South gets a home mar
ket for its farm fruits and produce,
and has its monopoly ef the cotton
crop besides, it will become the richest
agricultural country in the world. The
South will become a great manufactur
ing aection ; and this, more than any
thing else combined, will briug pros
perity to the Southern farmer uud
high value to his lands. So soon as
the South aecured home rule the peo
ple manifested the industry and activ
ity which enabled them tu prosecute
the war for four years against odds
which nothing hut pluck and energy
could have ao long resisted. Never
did a country rise so rapidly from the
ashes as the South has riseu since the
Soulhorn Stales emerged from the re
construction era, and passed under the
control of the tax paying while people.
Notwithstanding the Rayne Signal
considers Calcasieu parish a poor place
lor farming, it atauds on the list of
productive parishes in the State only
three notches from the top. Tbe Sig
nal might gain something by under
standing tbat " pulling down your
friend and neighbor to build up one's
self," is a very poor way to gain pop
ularity. Tbe Signal may compliment
itself ten years hence, if by well
directed efforts it succoqds in making
of Acadia, all told, iu wealth what the
lumber interests alone of Lake Charles
represents to day. Bro. Dtison will
sharpen bis pencil and scratch his edi
torial reservoir many times before
Acadia cau be oompared to Calcasieu,
either as an agricultural or progressive
aection.
The Baton Rouge Capitolian-Advo
cate of tbe 8th inst. says : "In the

Last Itfouday evening au alarm of
fire wan sounded which proved to be
at Mr. Geo. W. Ryan's residence on
Ryan street, near the corner of Divis
ion, caused by a defective flue. As
usual, the fire department was prompt
ly on band and arrested the flames be
fore much damage was done to tbe
building. The Phoenix H. «fc L. was
tbe first company on the ground but
were quickly joined by tbe Babcock
H. & L., closely followed by Lake
Charles Steam Fire Co. No. 1. Both
Hook and Ladder companies did most
excellent work, leaving nothing for the
steam engine to do on its arrival.
Much credit is due both the Phœuix
and Babcocks for their efficient work
on tbe occa8ion,and the promptness of
the steam engine is very commenda
ble. The Babcocks did good service
with extinguishers on tbe inside of
tbe building, while the Phœuix boys
fearless of danger mounted the roof
with buckets of water and quickly
subdued tbe fiâmes.
The Young American's were on
hand in goodly numbers and ready for
duty, but as they had not received
their engine at the time they were
powerless to do anything more than
assist the other companies.

At last a long felt want has been
supplied by our energetic fellow-citi
zen and tbat master mechanic, Mr.
Tbos. B. Barnes, in the establishment
of a manufacturing and general re
pair shop, where all kinds of iron
work can be done iu a mechanical way
and at the shortest notice. Mr.
Barnes' skill as a mechanic is un
surpassed, and equaled only by few,
which is one of the best evidences tbat
all work entrusted to him will be exe
cuted in a mechanical way. Barnes
& Co. give special attention to farm
smithing, wagon and carriage repair
ing, shipsmithing, gnnsmithing, boiler
making and repairing and all kinds of
machinery repairing, both portable and
stationery ; in fact Tom says they are
prepared to do almost any and every
thing, as there is nothing impossible
but for a mechanic to get rich. Read

The Rayne Signal comes to us this
week enlarged to a 7-column folio, and
much improved in appearance. The
Signal is a good paper and is a faith
ful chronicler of all local happonings
sister parish of Acadia, and de
serves the liberal patronage of its peo
ple. The Echo wishes the Signal
every success, as the energy and talent
displayed by Bro. Duson deserves
more than ordinary recognition by his
parishioners, and no doubt be will re
ceive it, as a first-class newspaper is
the making of any community, and as
such the Signal will compare favora
bly with any other country paper in
the State.

State of Louisiana,
Parish of Calcasieu.
The Grand Jury of the parish of
Calcasieu duly empanelled and sworn
on Mouday, the 22d day of November,
1886, present this their general report
to your Honorable Court as the result
of their labor.
We have found 27 true bills and 18
not true bills, and for cause we have
turned over to the District Attorney
several minor bills for future consid
eration. A great deal of our time has
been consumed in investigating cases
of a trivial and malicious nature, hav
ing been handed ua, some of which
were referred to us from Magiatrates'
courts, thereby entailing an unneces
sary expense on the parish. This evil
could be avoided by a little judgment
on part of the J ustices of the Peace.
Fiom general complaint we find the
public roads in bad condition, with a
few exceptions, owing principally to
neglect on part of the Police Jury to
appoint road overseers, some roads
having had no overseers appointed for
four or five years passed.
We examined the Jail and found it
in a very bad condition. The cage
being flat on the floor causes a damp
ness which is causing the floor to rot
out and the sheetiug ou the underside
to rust out. We advise that sufficient
railroad bars be put under the cage to
allow free ventilation. The premises
and hose are in a very bad aud leaky
condition, and needs repairs. We
further recommend that fuel be fur
nished the Ja»I.
We have been annoyed and delayed
in our deliberations from the fact that
we could not force the attendance of
witnesses.
We respectfully ask your Honor
that we be discharged from further
duties at this term of court.
