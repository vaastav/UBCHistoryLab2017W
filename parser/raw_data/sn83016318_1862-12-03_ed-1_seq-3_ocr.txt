The Kail Road We sue no steps be

towards Completing the fUilroad to Michigan

cate, and we har rumors to the efT.ct, that
ihose who have the control of the cnc rn, d
uot intend to continue the road beyond its pres
ent terminus on Fianklin stieet. Now tliii is
not what the people in tbe middle and southern
portions of the city, who have paid their money
Ir. ely fioto time to lime to aid in building the
road bargained for. It is grossly ui j ist towards
them, to allow the road to remain at its present
termiuus, without an effort on tbe part of the di
rectors to complete it to th; avenue. Will uot
our citizens arouse to their iuterests, and take
some measure to get the road completed ?
The Legislature will soon be in session, aud
