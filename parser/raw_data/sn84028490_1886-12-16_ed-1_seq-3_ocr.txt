' NATURAL FRUIT
n
OUR FOREIGN COMMERCE.
The annual re'iort fresh from the
FtutHHti of Statistics affords an lutorest
ii n BiialyslH of lite report of the trade
of oar own and other countries during
the lust fiscal year, with Instructive
ci nipatisons and comments.
The reports says that the foreign com
merce of the United States for the fiscal
year 1885 86, when compared with that
of the year 1884 85, discloses few
marked changes. There was a decline
of $(22,000 000 in the value of the ex
p ins of ni-icliaudiso, and an increase
of $58 000,000 in the value of imports.
I' ue export ot merchandise exceeded
the imports, nevertheless, and the de
line of foreign trade, which had been
138,000,000 in 1884, and t88,000,0t)0 in
18b5, was less than $5,000.00 in 188ii.
The decline beginning in 1882-83 was
'he remit of business depression
throughout the commercial world, and
in no respect peculiar to the United
States.
The slight decline last year is regard
ed as an indication that the trade de
pression has reached its lowest point
and that we are on the eve of a period
ut Increased commercial activity and
national prosperity. This Is further
Indicated by the trade returns of the
first three mouths of the fiscal year,
which exhibit a gratifying increase of
near forty millions of dollars in exports
aud Imports over the corresponding
period of last year. An analysis of the
returns for last year f mphaslze the fact
that the decrease invalneof our foreign
commerce was cansed more by falling
prices than Dy decline in tne volume ot
business.
A comparison ot the value of foreign
commerce of the leading commercial
nations ot the world, show that Great
Britain stands first, Germany second,
France third and the United States
fourth, and that the value of the com
merce of the United States increased
- it.ee 1860 to a much larger extent than
that of either Great Britain or France.
Of the decline i f foreign commerce un
der the American ting the rtport says:
It is humiliating toourna.lonal pride
that t nly 15 per cent, ot foreign trade,
measured by its value, is carried in homo
vesselri; while 79 per cent, is carried iu
foreign vessels, and that in this age of
rapid trauBp rtation by steam only 6
per cent, of onr foreign trade is con
ducted in steamers bearlngour national
Hug, while 65 per cent ot that trade,
with all its profits and the employment
of capital and labor, is conducted In
alien vessels. The constant and rapid
decline to the proportion of the value of
commodities carried in onr own vessels
from 75 per cent, in 1858 to 15 per cent.
in 1886 is a startling fact which should
arouse us to the impending danger of
the utter annihilation of our foreign
carrying trade.
The President's message is a care
fully prepared document and reads
well, it is clean cut and sensible. He
wants taxes cut down and labor less
burdened, less surplus in the treasury.
Correct undoubtedly.
It seems that nnner this Uf mocratic
administration more pensions have been
abjudicated and paid than under any
like period. Let onr Republican friends
note this, aud ex-soldieis thould not
forget.
The attention of Congress is called to
our coast defences. In case of foreign
war we might be rather defenceless;
but after all, torpedoes can quickly be
made and placed; and those sort of dy
namite bombs are cheap and fearful in
execution, eometlmes. Of course our
coast defenses are worthy of attention.
The report of the Socreiary ot ttie
Treasury which is made to the House is
an Important document, and gives
bis views on the financial eiiua
tlon with suggestions. The report is
a remarkably able st tte paper. It is
aggressive in theextreme; demonstrates
that there is no present nope ot per
suading Great Britain and Germany tb
adopt the bimetallic standard, calls for
the repeal of the compulsory coinage
clause of the silver law. it wants the
Government to get oat of the banking
business, ana to substitute sliver ana
gold Cttititi 'stea lor the legal tenders,
it dwells at great length upon the "ex
tortion of a continued war taxation
which breeds onr vast surplus revenue
and calls vigorously for a reduction
thereof. It wants the free list greatly
increased, and especially demands that
wool shall be made wholly free, that
the tax may be taken off of the clothe
of sixty millions of people. It believes
that labor especially suffers from a war
tariff, and presents the arguments with
force and clearness.
From the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, tne total revenues of the
Government for the flPRl vear ending
Jnue 30, 1886, were $336,4311,727. The
ordinary expenditures lor the same per
iod were $287 034 181, leaving a balance
of $49,405,545. Of these expenditures
neatly $63,500,000 went for pensions,
and nearly siuu.txju.uuu ror interest on
the public debt and Hinking Fund. The
revenues were $12,749 029 larger than
the previous yenr, and tho expenditures
were $17,743,796 smaller than in the
previous year.
It seems CongreBsman McKlnley does
it ot approve of the President's message'
Mr. McKlnley ought to feel gratefnl at
least, that in the Departments at wasn
lngton yet are manv of his Republican
friends from this district, whom he,
McKlnley, had appointed under Repub
lican administrations.
It would seem that President Cleve
land believes in just and economical
government, and bence favors equal
taxation, and hence Mr. McKlnley does
not endorse the President nor his mes
sacre. Mr. McKlnley believes in "pro
tection tot the sake of protection"; that
is, he wants the people taxed to put
money in the pecKets or iavorea indi
viduals. The Democratic idea is that
our government hiR uo right to tax the
people and take their money, except for
revenue to carry on the government
and pay its debts.
The Constitution says: "Congress
shall have power to lay and collect
taxes, to dbv the debts and provide lor
the general welfare." John Sherman
wants to take the tax off sugar, so-that
sugar may come in free, and also favors
the government paying those who raise
sugar In Louisiana and the South, two
cents per pound by way of bounty and
encouragement. This, of course, would
be direct protection or bounty. It is
really more honest than the usual mode
of Indirect bounty oalled protection.
Bat the whole thing is robbery.
"High wages In labor and cheaper
products are correlative terms," says
Secretary Manning in his report. He
claims that our high wages Insure low
labor cost In product; that "pauper
wages" in other lands make higher
labor cost In products. He speaks of
"oar suicidal taxes on raw materials."
The total value of our domestic ex
ports for the last fiscal year was almost
exactly $666,000,000, of which 86 per
oent. were the products of onr fields,
forests, fisheries and mines, and 10 per
cent, only were the sum total of maun
factored products in which American
labor was inwrought.
Taylor, of the Enqnlrer, has ben in
terviewing several Democratic S ate
Souutoid tnd throws out tLe idea that
they may not attend during the session
at all. After glvtpg his Interview with
Senator Van Cleaf at riiclevilie, Mr.
Taylor said in Sunday's E quirer:
'ftie whole of the Seuutors emversa
tion lmpres-iHd me with ttm Improbabil
ity of the Democratic Senators go'.ng to
Columbus this winter. LI pointed out
In the published journal of the Senate a
number of changes, Interpolations aud
amendments, which are nothing short
of forgery, and said:
"You were present and know wbat the
proceedings were. If the public records
are to be thus doctored and falsitied to
cover up revolutionary crimes, wt at Is
the nse of honest men gring there to be
trampled noon and lied fbout in the
public archives?"
It the Democratic Senators refuse to
attend, and if the session continues bj
yond the 4th of March, and Fuzsley and
Cruase resign, Senator A. D. Ftssett, of
Mahoning, will then tve reacted the
goal of his ambition.
The two Republican vacancies will
leave bat nineteen Senators, a bare
quor m, and Fassett will be boss of the
situation, the position he schemed for
last winter.
It is well known, to a good many peo
ple, at least, that Fassett offered to vote
for the retention of two Democratic
Senators from Hamilton county it the
Democrats would stand by him rn all
matters ot legislation and the confirma
tion of the Governor's appointment.
This would have made him virtual die
tator ot the Sanate, the Governor's office
and the Legislature.
The Democrats indignantly spurned
the offer, although it would have ena
bled tbem to hamstring the Republican
Alminlstration aud bring It into dlsre
pute with the people. The Republicans,
under the same circumstances, would
not have been so virtuous. They would
have jumped at the opportunity.
Speaking of the proposed consolida
tion of the fall and spring elections,
Senator Van Cleaf said:
"I am opposed to it, and the people
generally will be when tbey reflect on
the subject. It wonid greatly impair
tfflcleucy and honesty of local muni' Ipa!
government, and make them a pan of
the party machines. The little i Dices
in a State election would be a corrupt ing
element, and small-fry adventurers and
pot house politic lit as would icroe
themselves on the list for the smaller
offices to secure the opportunity to tiade
on the larger ones. The result would be
very corrupting. As a rule, the little
offices would be the stock in trade wben
dealing with the politicians for the
larger offices, while occasionally a big
one would be traded for a little one, and
public interests jeopardized. Lot ibe
municipal election alone, or change it
to May, so the weather will be more
favorable than the first of April."
It is pretty clear, however, that the
Republican leaders Intend to make the
abolition of the spring election a party
TAYLOR.
THE RECKLESS REPOSITORY.
Again has the Repository o'erleaped
Itself. In a commendable i ffort to tiive
news it has given the stamp of its ap
proval as truth to wbat it publishes as
rumors heard upon the street, concern
lng alleged dissensions in the ranks of
the Canton Relief Association.
The Canton Relief Association, con
ducted by noble and charitable lanies
of the city, done much last winter to
alleviate the Buffering of the needy end
worthy poor of Canton. To this fuc. we
can cheerfully testify. The only re
ward the members received for tLelr
meritorions labor was the conscious
ness of having performed a humane aud
Christian-like duty.
The fact appears from the action taken
at a meeting of the Association Wednes
day night that, instead of dissension,
everything has been harmonious amoi.g
the ladies and that hd the Ropo-dtuy
done the ladies the justice to which Hi, y
were entitled, by interviewing some of
them, it would have dlssovfred that the
rumors were false and malicious.
The rash and untimely assertions of
the Repository, based upon the state
ment of a business man who talked tin
der cover, without disclosing bis ident
ity, hus had i hn eff et of rtaniKging the
good name of the As ooi ttion, aud it is
teured, may interfere with the work of
relief this winter, inasmuch as the gen
erous people who last year suipMed the
society with funds and other contriba
turns, will feel cimry about making tin
nations to nn Association, if they think
Its memriers are not working iu h.ir
monv.
At Wednesday night's meetlug the
Association vindicated Its pre-ide; t
llrs. Ada Clark, to whi m was ascribed the
cause of the alleged trouble, by pas
lug resolutions, condemning thi
words of the unknown business
man and emphatically declaring that all
the work ot the society had been traui-
aoted with the utmost harmony. Thene
resolutions with a complete and accurate
report of the meeting, at which they
were passed, will be found on the fourth
page of this issue.
ELECTORAL BILL PASSED.
Tb House of Representatives yester
day, by a substantially unanimous vote,
passed the Senate bill of last session
regulating the electoral count, with cer
tain amendments of ;ts own, which will
no doubt be concurred in by the Senate
and thus the possibility ot a contested
Presidency avoided in the future, as
well as It can be done by statute.
The bill as it etauds makes the deci
sion of State tribunals as to the choice
of electors conclusive and that it shall
govern in the counting of the electoral
vote. The States are authorized to
create tribunals to determine contests
in the choice of electors.
In case of disputed authority In the
State, only that electoral vote will be
connted which is aocepted by both
Houses of Congress acting separately.
The important feature of the bill Is to
remand the settlement of all contested
elections of electors to State authority.
With the passage of the bill last ses
sion regulating the Presidential eucce.
sion, and this bill regulating the count,
the necessary safeguards have been es
tablished to guard against a disputed
Presidency.
It gives us great pleasure to state
hat the merchan t who was reported to
be at the point of death from an attack
of pneumonia, has entirely recovered by
the use of Dr. William Hall's Balsam for
the Lungs. Naturally he feels gratefnl
for the benefits derived from nslng this
remedy for the lungs and throat; and in
giving publicity to this statement we
are actuated by motives of public bene
faction, trusting that others may be
benefitted in a similar manner.

Judge Meyer still t-ays "it is fale lhat
I (he) surrendered it (me Probate fli e)
for a consideration." Let us see. Wuen
Judge Meyer wanted to resign iu favor
of A. L. Jones, a year ago, the con (dera
tion was the purciase t:f his pio.ierty.
Was it not Judge? Would Mr. Fawcett
have purchased your property if
he had in t been appointed Pro
bate Judgi-? We apprehend not.
It Is a fact, and Judge Meyer
oinnot deny it that he lumie sim
ilar propositions to o her Republicans.
It is alKO a fact that Judge Meyer, one
year ago, offered to rewign, lu favor of
another Dmocrat, if that Democrat
would purchase his property and enter
Into an sgreement to give him one-half
of the fees of the office. No considera
tion Judge? Then what would you call
it?
The Democrat has never q-mtioned
J'idgfl Vinyer's nbiilty in the iu fillment
of the duties of the offices to which he
has been elov.tei by the D mu'ratio
party aud which he has so basely De
frayed in handing over the Probate tffise
to a Republican.
As to Judge Meyer's "success or fall
ings as a soldier iu the field Qghtlug for
the Union" we'll not question th t just
now, but when the Judge prates -ontuch
about "loyalty" aud vaun a himself,
what does be have to say abont the fact
of his wanting to borrow fifty dollars In
1861 of a Democratic friend in this city
in order to send bis boys down to South
Carolina to join the army of Jeff Davis?
There Is no slander, Ju ige, In telling a
fact; and the fact tbat yon have betrayed
the party that elected you Is beyond
question. So with these remarks we
will sav:
"Farewell; thorj canst not teacb ns to forget"
Thousands Say So.
