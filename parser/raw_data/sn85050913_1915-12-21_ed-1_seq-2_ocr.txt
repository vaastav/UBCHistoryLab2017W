It seems that when one of the

he also breaks a few promises. But
in this the kings of the Balkans are

If Henry Ford can talk peace loud
enough to be heard above the
shrieking of the big guns and the
roar of the smaller artillery he may
attract some attention in Europe.
Otherwise his mission is already
lost.
They are having a mighty hard
time in Nebraska to get candidates
for president upon the primary bal
lot. The latest from that staite is
that somebody has-filed the name of
Henry Ford.. What do you think
Vibout that?
It may dawn-upon Ford's peace
pafty before they get far with
their peace program in Europe that
.if they cannot agree among them
selves they will have a hard time
making the warring nations agree
upon anything.
It is likely that every warring na
tion in Eusope would like to stop
fighting if nothing more were gain
ed than to be recognized as victor.
But the indications are that the con
flict will go on until one side or the
other will be forced to quit from
sheer exhaustion.
Billy Sunday accuses Henry Ford
of running hte peace ship for adver
tising purposes and there is no au
thority in the country more exper
ienced in the free advertising de

Sunday. His evidence may be ac
cepted as that of an expert.
The past season has put a check
upon the sale of land in Iowa to
some extent, but some sales are be
ing made and in every instance
prices are higher than asked lasf
year. Iowa soil has the value in it
and land seekers are coming to re
alize that fact.
Of course everybody fn Iowa will
back Senator Kenyon's proposition
for a national park in the north
eastern part of the state National
parks comprise-' some of our best as
sets and each year adds to their
value, and every day the purchase
is delayed increases the cost.
A jeweler in Waterloo a few days
ago circulated some hand bills tel
ling the people that they should
patronize home jewelers in buying
their Christmas presents. The jew
eler's advice was ail right, but un
fortunately the hand bills bore the
imprint of an Illinois printing
house.
There doesn't appear to fie as
many democratic candidates for gov
ernor of Iowa as there were a few
months ago. There is a sort of
holding back as the day for the sac
rifice draws nearer. Ed. l^redith,
W. W. Marsh, Frank O'Connor and
1
all the other boys seem to be suffer
ing from a severe attack of cold
feet.
From South Dakota, too, come en
couraging reports of the strength of
Senator Cummins as a presidential
candidate. In fact, the entire north
west is treating the senator with
great consideration. Iowa stands
the Lest slfow in its history of sup
plying the next occupant of the
white house..
"I have come back to live down
my reputation for wickedness,"-^.
Joseph G. Cannon.
This proves that uncle Joe expects
to live to be 109 years old and that
he expects to remain in congress till
the end of th,e chapter. Because no
body would seriously contend that
he could live down his reputation
inside of twenty or thirty years.
Boone has a municipal motto,
"Try.Boone you'll stay," which is
at least better than Cedar Rapids'
self smirking phrase.—Cedar Rap
ids Republican.
Webster City also has a motto,
but she doesn't use it in broad day
light. She is hoping, however, that
the directors of the commercial
league will see fit some day to give
her one that is befitting to her dig
nity and importance.
Senator Kenyon is backing in the
senate a bill to prevent the clear
ing of ships from our ports that con
tain both passengers and munitions
of 'war or other dangerous explos
ives. Had such a law been in ef
fect there would have been no Lusl
tania disaster to shock the civilized
world. The bill ought to pass 'in
the interest of humanity and no
commercial reasons should be per
mitted to block its way.
Senator Tillman, known among
friends as Quarter Section Ben, took
occasion the other day to tell the
senate, and incidentally the coun
try, that he had no use for Roose
velt or Bryan. Either of the gen
tlemen named stand much higher in
the estimation of the American peo
pie -than the firebrand from South
Carolina, whose chief aim in life
appears to toe the adding of addi
tional burdens to an already over
burdened" race.
There ft no particular necessity'in
quoting scripture to prove the right
of preparedness, says the Chariton
Leader. All nature proves this. Ev
en the plants .have their weapons of
defense, and when it comes to ani
mals, the arsenal is unquestioned
The cock has his gaffs, the polecat
his fluid extract, the long-horned
Texas steer his "hooks," etc. Of
course, as they become domesticated
these- weapons modify, but they are
weapons, nevertheless.
Attacking President Wilson's mes
sage to Congress, Col. Roosevelt
calls the chief executive a "Byzan
tine logothete." Were we in Presi
dent Wilson's place we would look
that up in the dictionary and if it
meant anything half as bad as it
looks we would whip Rooaevelt on
eight.—Manson Democrat.
Jack Dalton wouldn't do anything
of the kind. But he would get an
awful licking himself if he under
took to do what he says he would if
in Wilson's position.

The statement of ex-President
Taft that he is out of politics for all

Some of the taxpayers of Des

the best thing in sight.

The Freeman-Tribune is unable to

In the case of Long vs. Dalton at
Rockwell City -this week the jury

for years the'editors of Manson car
ried on a bitter fight, attacking each
other with unusual venom. Manson
is about the last town in the state
where such plays were put upon the
boards. Journalism has been raised
above such methods in most com'
munities. It is eitfirely proper for
competiting papers to criticise each
other's editorial utterances, but per
sonalities should be avoided.
Qol. George Harvey, "the man
who discovered Woodrow Wilson,"
and then was sorry for it, is now in
London and in a recent interview
declared that the president would
stand a good show of being re-elect'
ed if the war lasted through next
year, and he thought it would last.
He also declares' that Great Britain
has not yet really started to fight
and that her resources in money and
men have hardly been touched. In
the Judgment of the colonel, Ger
many must lose in the end) Rus

says, stronger than ever, and Rus

timistic.
Gov. Ferguson of Texas Is alarm
ed over the vast sums of money the
financiers of the United States have
loaned Europe in the past year and

sum would permit a loan of $800
to every tenant farmer in this coun
try and put him on the road to farm
ownership. Gov. Fergtason might be
right in his figures, but he is wrong
in his conclusion. Little or no
money is now going to Eucope from
the United States, not nearly so
much as before the war began. It
has been estimated that at least
$300,000,OOO were expended an

American travelers and as traveling

WILSON AND FAIRPLAY.
The attack of the president in his
message upon all foreign born
Americans is utterly without justifi
cation, uncalled for and unwise. To
condemn them as a class as he does
is unaccountable for a man of his
natural and acquired intelligence. It
has been well demonstrated we have
no more patriotic citizens in our
country "than those of foreign
birth.—Eagle Grove Eagle.
The misrepresentations of the
statement of the president by the
Eagle Grove paper is without justi
fication, uncalled for and ^unfair.
The president did not attack all for
eign born Americans^ nor did he con
demn them as a class. The president,
as well as every otlier patriotic and
intelligent citizen, knows and ad
mits that the average naturalized
citizen of tliis country is loval to its
institutions $nd interests and the
vast majority of them would not
hesitate to offer their1 lives as sacri
fices if necessary to. perpetuate our
free institutions and insure the sta
bility of this government by, for
and of the people./'^t is only fair to
President Wilson to quote what he
really said upon the question which
brought forth the unfair attack of
the Eagle. Here' it is:
I 1

*V
uralization laws to the full freedom
and Opportunity of America, who
have poured the poison of disloyalty
into the very arteries of our nation
al life, who hayg sought to bring the
authority and good name of our gov
ernment into contempt, to destroy
our industries wherever they
thought it effective for their vin
dictive purposes to strike at them
and to debase our politics to the
uses of foreign ftitrigue. Their nuni'
ber is not great aB compared with
the, whole number of those sturdy
hosts by which our nation ^has been
enriched in recent generations opt
of virile foreign stocks, but it is
great enough to have brought deep
disgrace upon us and to have made
it necessary that we should prompt
ly make use of processes of law by
which we 'may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
VICTORY OF PEACE.
Clinton Advertiser: A greaft So
cialist leader said in the German
Reichstag the other day that if the
war continued, the United States
would be the only victor, for Europe
would commit suicide. In this idea,
uttered by a man who for the mo
ment disregarded official restraint,
the American people may, if they
will, find a profound lesson.
President Wilson had the same
thought the other day when he said:
''it was necessary, if a universal
catastrophe was to be avoided, that
a limit should be Set to the sweep
of destructive war arid that some
part of the great family of nations
should keep the processes of peace
alive, if only to prevent collective
economic ruin' arid the breakdown
throughout the world of the indus
tries by which its populations are
fed and sustained. It was mani
festly the duty of the self-governed
nations of this hemisphere t6 re
dress, if possible, the balance Of
economic loss and confusion in the
other, if they could do nothing else."
We are charged, as no. other great
nation ever was before with obliga
tions that we cannot lightly, aban
don. By keeping alive the processes
of peace we are preserving civiliza
tion not only for ourselves bfit for a
devastated world. With Europe in
ruins, impoverished, perhaps swept
by anarchy, where except in the
great republic will be found reme
dies, moral, legal, intellectual and
material, that will surely be' need
ed for the healing of the nations?
This is what Dr. Scheidemann
meant when he said that if war con
tinues, the United States will be
the only victor. In that contingency
it will be the victor not of war but
of peace not of ambition, bat of
justice. Iv/
For what we are seeking now is
national efficiency and security. We
serve a great nation. We should
serve it in the spirit of its peculiar
genius. It is the genius of common
men for self-government, Industry,
liberty and peace."—Woodrow Wil
son.
PEACE TIME NOT RIPE.
Sioux City Journal: The German
chancellor's declaration that Ger
many is willing to discuss peace
terms if requested by the allies is
interesting, but as an item of news
it is' not startling. Germany has
been ready to talk peace at any
time since the failure of the inef
fective drive at Calais. The success
of the Teuton offensive in Russia in
creased Berlin's readiness to make
terms. -The later success in Serbia
has had a tendency in the same di
rection. This is easily explained.
Germany can go into a peace confer'
ence now as a victor in tbe war. All
her military undertakings have
been crowned with & measure of sue
cess. She has taken Belgium And
part of France. Sfhe has cleared
Galicia and taken Poland and por
tions of Russia.' She has takeii Ser
bia and part of Montenegro. She
has opened a' land route to the ori
ent All these operations have been
entered in the record as victories.
From a military standpoint, they
are victories, but it remains to be
seen whethet* they are worth the
high price paid for them. The all
important fact is that none of them
has put any of the great allies who
are opposing her out of the fight,
and all of them put together have
not convinced the allies that they
must in the end lose the war.
Germany has subjugated Belgium
and Poland and Serbia, but she is
still confronted by Great Britain,
France, Russia and Italy, all in bet
ter shape for effective fighting than
at the opening of the war. While
the struggle goes on the allies will
retain control of the sea. They will
remain superior in financial and
economic resources. They will out
number Germany in available fight
ing men. Under the circumstances,
no one need be puzzled as to Why
the allies do not care to enter a
peace conference in which Germany
would expect to'dictate terms on the
Btrength of her early victories—lue,
obviously, to her better prepared
ness at the opening of the war. The
allies are. not ready to admit that

A Good Ordinance.
The city council of Waterloo has
adopted an ordinance regulating so-
licltofs and agents for magazines,
periodicals and other commodities
to be delivered at some future ddtc*,
and providing that tliey shall fur-,
nish proof to the city cierk to sho^
ttrtSy are responsible agents before
they will be permitted tci solicit of
ders jn the city. A license will be
issued to each agent at the discretion
of the city clerk. No fee will bp as
sessed for this license.
The ordinance provides that any
agent or solicitor who fails to com
ply'with the terms of the ordinance
Shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
and upon conviction, may be fined
not to exceed $100 or thirty days in
the city jail.
Tliere has beon considerable
fraud committed in Iojra the past
year or two by agents taking sub
scriptions for various periodicals
and Webster City people 'have been
worked" along with others. The
Waterloo ordinance, we take it, is
for the purpose of protecting the
public rather than to interfere with
legitimate solicitors. Such an 'or
dinance in Webster City would be a
good thing.
