The president's message is worth
reading. This is something new.
The Pacific (Missouri) Herald is a
new exchange. It is a neat and clean
family paper.
The fight on Senator Cockrell will
simply consolidate his friends. Only
this and nothing more.
The Troy board of trade is alive
and kicking. It got off on the wrong
foot but is now booming.
There is only one applicant for the
Mexico postoffice. "What became of
the rast of the boys, we don't know.
The mugwumps have joined the
Greenbackers, and the new "party"
can hold its convention in an one
horse omnibus.
The Moberly Monitor has tied its
tow-line on to the branch pen. It
deserves to win. Meberly is a daisy
town the twin sister of Mexico.
In drawing seats in the house of
congress Hon. J. E. Hutton of this
district drew a seat on the speaker's
right, back near the lobby. He is
near Burnes, Clardy and Hatch, all
of Missouri.
Disappointed office-seekers all
over the state are finding fault with
the appointments of Cleveland in
Missouri. We should think this very
bad taste. He may have made mis
takes but they are few.
The St. Louis Chronicle and St-
Louis Globe-Democrat differ. One
says ear congressman is confined to
his room with vertigo and the other
says it is hay fever. Great papers
will differ.
We find the following in a telegram
to a St. Louis paper of Monday
"Representative Hutton is under the
weather. He had a slight attack of
vertigo to-day." This is greatly to
be regretted as congress was to have
convened on Monday.
Correct, as Usual.
A paper that has not the courage
to condemn wrong in its own party
is not a truo exponent of honest
Democratic sentiment We believe
above all things in keeping our own
household pure. Mexico Intelligen

For reasons that we consider good
we leave out the "sour grapes" arti
cle sent us by a Democrat in regard
to kicking made in a wholesale man
ner against the appointments of
Cleveland in this state The article
may er may not be true. The pub
lishing of it now could do no good.
Cleveland needs no backbone. He
knows his business and "disappointed
office-seekers'' will not be able to
bias him.
"Much Credit to Bob White."
We see by the Mexico Ledger that
' the water works are about completed
in that city. Much credit is due
Bob White for this enterprise, for he
has been hammering away in the
Ledgu for some time past with re
ference to the matter. You can Bay
what you please about newspaper

wonderfully in these public enter
prises Marshall News.
Two Supplements.
Tbe Ledger this week at an extra
ordinary expense furnishes its read
ers with two supplements free. One
contains the president's message and
ether good reading matter. The
other is filled with tbe best local mat
ter and live ads. The Ledges at
ibis time of year is of course -with
ads on-account of iU i&tge cir
culation but under no circumstances
does ita proprietor limit the amount
of reading matter.
Watches, Diamonds. Clocks, Rings,
It is a shame that a live little city
like Mexico should have any drones,
clams or dogs in the manger, but it
is a. fact. There are a few such in
but
Mex5co fihould be .tlked
straight- The men we wish to stir
J up are those who are able to assist
with time and money in booming
Mexico. We fear they want to en
joy all the advantages but spend no
money. When a sidewalk to the
cemetery is to be laid or a park fence
is to be erected or the poor to he fed
or buried, or a Board of Trade to be
organized, or money to be subscribed
to get a manufacturing establishment,
or electric light to be paid for, or one
thousand and one other things nec-
essarv to a live town to be looked
after, some of our citizens are inva
riably conspicuous by their absence.
This is not right. It is not fair for
a few people to do all the work and
spend all the money while others who
are amply able, stand around sneerin,
and sulking, and at the same time
get all the advantages derived
from the enterprises.
The Ledger does not favor boy
cotting but we do think such busi
ness (?) men should be hauled over
the coals. Their proper place is in
the grave yard. They are no good
on the earth to a town. They would
kill any town. Except for the vital
ity Mexico has this class of men to
day would be playing marbles where
Hardin College is or ''shucking"
corn where the court house stands.
Wake up, gentlemen. Get to the
front. If you are too penurious
that's the word to give aaything,
for heaven's sake don't discourage
others and spend your time in throw
ing cold water on every enterprise
spoken of. Mexico has got to get
there. If the old fogies and cranks
won't assist we must get there any
way if we have to plow them under.
Mexico is getting a move an herself
and is bound to shine. You can t
keep a good town down, no matter
how you handicap it.
Mexico has many liberal men
men who help every enterprise men
who give more than they can afford.
Our remarks are intended for a few
chronic kickers, who, although able,
and reap the benefits, never spend a
cent unless they are sure of getting
back two cents before they shut their
eyes.
Do they ever ask themselves, "Will
anyone be at our funeral because
they are sorry we are gone
?" No,
sir, the brass band will be out that
day.
la Good Shape!
We are glad to get tbe following
in conservation with Rev. T. J. Wheat,
the Presiding Elder, who was here
holding quarterly meeting on last
Sabbath. The Liberty street
Methodist Episcopal church has
paid for pastoral support for the
past quarter $223.00. The church
building is in good repair and the
Society is in a good and growing
spiritual condition. They have no
church debt, but have nearly $1,200
in notes and available funds to invest
in parsonage property. The invest
ment will likely be made in the near
future. Tbis, the Presiding Elder
said, is a good showing. We cheer
fully give place to these reliable facts
and wish their church unbounded suc
cess. One Price.
The Ledger has one price for ad
vertising the same to all business
men. One page one week (except
local page) $15 ; one-half page one
week (except local page) $30 ; one
quarter page one week (except local
page) $20; one-eighth of page one
week (except local page) $10.
Of course, to regular advertisers
who are patrons the year 'round, we
make a slight reduction. Business is
business, and we carry no man's ad
vertisement for less money than
another. We know our space is
worth the price asked ; if you don't
want it don't take it. See sworn
statement of circulation.
The Ledges' s prices are governed
by its circulation. We don't claim
to carry ads any cheaper than any
one else. We charge according to
the quality of tbe goods.

Mexico, Dec. 8. We see that the

pitching into the senators and Cleve
land about the appointments made in
Missouri Was not tbe editor of
that paper a candidate for an office
under the government? Did he not

RUSH HILL RACKET.
Correspondence of the Ledger. s
Rish Hill. Dec. 8. Rush Hill is
fast coming to the front. Her citi
zens are thoroughly aroused on the
subject of improvements. An effort
is being made to have the town in
corporated. When that is done we
may look for good sidewalks on the
principal streets, and crossings put
down so we can get across the
railroad without being compelled to
go half a mile around.
W. T. Lott, who has the contract
to tear down and move Sabbath
Home church to town, deserves much

We learn that Mr. Hill has bought
Mr. Reusch's new residence and all
his interest in the town of Rush Hill
Mr. Reusch has not fully decided
what he will do but thinks he will
go on a farm near town.
The man that took the lumber
from the church had better stop such
operations or he will get crippled in
the other leg (he is lame in one leg )
There has been too much of tbis
petty thieving going on of late.
Some of the parties are known and
will be exposed if they do not stop
it.
Dr. Vance says if the man that
took his case of instruments will
place them where be can get them he
will say no more about the matter.
There will be a festival at the new
church Friday night, December 18th,
under the direction of the Red Apron
Club, the proceeds to go towards
liquidating the debt incurred by the
moving and refitting the house. All
are invited to come and assist the la
dies in their laudable undertaking.
Married, Tuesday morning, at
Mexico, by 'Squire Winscott, Miss
M. E. Crockett, daughter of David
Crockett of this place, to Mr. E. B.
Bernard, of Detroit Michigan. The
happy couple arrived on the one
o'clock train and with a few invi-
I ted friends were driven to the resi

You have constantly before you flaming advertisements making such offers, and when you call at the

Tou should remember this important fact : . Some houses pay a very much larger price for goods than
others, consequently you have to pay from 10 to 33 per cent, more for your goods than if you bought them from
a house that is prepared to buy goods cheap and can sell you goods at your own price.
