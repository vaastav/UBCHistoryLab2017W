THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho people /who havo boon looking
tor the soiiBational und oven "tho J
yellow" In tho annual message which
ProBldont Roosevelt sent to Congress!
yesterday > can liave nothing but a'
feeling of dlBnpolntment. It Ih vig?
orous nble, and truly Roosevelt,
but It Is common place as com?
pared to what wo were expected to
beliove from tho Washington cor?
respondents 'Who had space to fill
and illlod It regardless of veracity.
Ab good guossers moat of the cor?
respondents are failures. While thoro
^^jirosomo more or less startling sug
gestflSlt?- In* the' message thoro Is
nothing to alarm tho nation and
none of tho recommendations, if
enabled Into laws, would revolution?
ize tho country- Twenty years ago
portions of tho message would havo
been pronounced rank socialism. It
Garflold or Harrison or Cleveland
had given to Congress such a mos
sago .thoy would have been pro-,
nouncod enemies to society, but
times uro changing nnd the people
Will read and accept Mr. Roosevelt's
views as an every day mailer.
Thoro Is no mistaking the lan?
guage President Roosevolt uses In his
nibesago relative to the corruption I
la politics and the necessity of >
having a law which would forbid
corporation-.; 'from making contri?
butions to election campaign funds.
The President stands out strongly
for a cleaner nnd better political
syutom; thoro Is no dougt of It, and
the American people with tho ex?
ception of the professional politician,
will pray that ihls recommendation
will In tho very near future become
law
The President reiterates his views
on injunction cases In labor trou?
bles and asks Congress to enact
legislation covering this subject ask?
ed for last yenr. 'He also calls tho
attention of the people of the coun?
try to lynching* and summed up
his vlOWS On this question are that
tho negro should be given fair
play.
One of tho strongest features In
?President RoosevelU's message la
his denunciation of the domagogim.
In no uncertain manner and in a
way that will meet with the approv?
al of the people, ho denounces
the man who preaches discontent for
personal gain. It is not hard to
read between lines that his refer?
ences, lu this part of his message
rerer to William 'Randolph Hearst
and Arthur Brisbane and others who
seek to make a class hated. More
1k one passage of that part of his
message that Is worth rending:
"There must bo a storn refusal to
i. be misled into following eithor that
baso creture who appeals and pan?
ders to the lowest Instincts and
passions in order to arouso one sot
cf Americans against their fellows
or that other creature, equally base,
but no baser, who In spirit of greed
or to accumulate or add to an al?
ready huge fortune .seeks to exploit
his fellow Americans -with callous
disregard to tholr wolfare of soul
and body. The <man who debauches
others in order to obtain a high
office stands on an evil equality of
corruption with tho man who do
bauchos othors for financial profit,
nnd when hatred 1b sown tho crop
which springs up en nouly bo evil."
Tho child labor problem Is briefly
touched upou and facts and figures
relative tu disputes between capital
and labor are given. Tho President
expresses the belief that tho great
majority of strikes could be avert?
ed If there was more love! head
ncss and more of an Inclination to
sett to tho trouble by arbitration.
It was in that purl of tho message
devoted to tho control of tho cor?
poration where tho grenter.t disap?
pointment for tho lovers of the sen
sat iual came In. There Is nothing
radical about tho President's sug?
gestions. Mo very sensibly say?
that nothing can bo done with the
greater evils by different states leg?
islating on the subject. He. truly
says that the fountain head for deal
lug with this question is In the
National Congress. As lie has be
for told the people the President be?
lieves that all corporations are not
?had. but acknowledges that thcro
are bad ones und It Is theso
with which ho wants congress to
deal. As tho President soys. If cor?
porations are properly conducted
there Is no harm In the combina?
tion of capital, anymore Hi an thcro
Is In a properly conducted combina?
tion of labor, tint tho trouble Is that
both innke themselves obnoxious to
tho people by wanting too much. To
speak plainly, It Is the liogglshuess
In them that tho pooplc do not like
one want eliminated entirely from
American life. There Is nothing
really now In the President's mes?
sage ou tho corporation question
aj ho has expressed tho same views.
In nt lonst two speeches which ho
delivered last summer, but every
thinking American should read that
portion of his message, at least.
On the Inheritance und Income
tax tho President reiterated opinions
previously expressed. Ho acknowl?
edges that the question Is undoubt
ly very Intrlcntu, delicate and trou
blcsomo, and Hint one of the great?
est obstacles to be overcome is to
have a law that will prove consti?
tutional. It Is a subject that every
American citizen should carefully
study and become thoroughly ac?
quainted 'With
"There Is no doubt but a law
that would bo constitutional would
be of grout benefit to tho country
at largo. It would bo nothing more
than Just ami right that thoro should
bo a national graduated Income tux
nnd also a national graduated Inher?
itance tax. The people It would
effect would bo In n position whero
It would not do them no harm in
a flnnncinl way and It would greatly
Increase tho revenue of the nation.
There Is no doubt that more money
Is needed every day to run our
nation. It is one of the results of
prosperity and Increasing greatness.
If wo are not going forward there
would be no need of more money to
conduct the affairs of tho Federal
government, but we are n progressive
nation, ami to continue on that line
of progresslveness which fnto has
cut out for us, an Increased Income
Is an absolute necessity. This In?
heritance and Income tnx is about
the only means loft through which
to raise additional money, for there
wculd be a fearful hue nnd cry If
u-t attempt was made to Increase
the tariff or Internal revenues.
The President yesterday was not
at nil vigorous in his appeal to have
Congress pass a ship subsidy bill.
Two years ago ami ngaln last
year, it was a feature of his message,
but yesterday he merely snld that
there should bo some sort of pro?
tection to the merchant marine. He
expressed the hope that the bill In?
troduced In Congress last year would
bo passed ut this session. There Is
every reason to believe that the bill
In question is as nearly unobjection?
able as any can be.
After discussing n number of mat"
tors the President takes up the sub?
ject, of the Navy, which he charac?
terizes the "surest guarantee of
pence which this country possessess."
He does not ask that tho navy be
Increased but continued at Its pres?
ent strength, and points out that
the only way that this can die done
la to replace the obsolete and out?
worn ships by new and good onos.
The President's recommendation Is
In accord with the great majority of
tho people who believe there should
bo no backward stops by this coun?
try In furnishing modern sea fight?
ing machines for tho navy.
In reference to the California pre?
judice against the Japanese the Pres?
ident makes an appeal for what he
terms "International morality" an.l
declares that there should bo no
discrimination against people of any
color In the matter of schooling. To
thnt extent he probably will have
the support of the people of the
country; but when he declares that
ho will use all of the federal power
at his command and n^ks for the
enactment of specific laws which
will enable him to Interfere with
tho internal affairs of the state or
j municipality many serious questions
I are raised and widespread opposl
Itlon is bound to ensue.
To bo sure, tho school board of
San Francisco should give to the
Japanese pupils the samo education?
al advantages given to other aliens.
No reasonable man will dissent from
that proposition, but when the fed
eru! government assumes to Hay who
shall or who shall not attend tho
school (and one power naturally
would carry with It the other) It Is
time to call a halt or else permit
the federal government to . support
the jjchools. Congress might pass
laws from now until doomsday with?
out dispelling nn lota of the preju?
dice felt ngali)6t tho Japanese In
California. The experience with the
war amendments to the Constitution
of the United States should be suf I
ftclout argument against rate schools
would bo the only satisfactory so?
lution of the problem The President
fears that a mob outbreak may pro?
voke war. He should realize that
an effort to enforce distasteful "so'<j
lal equality" Is a powerful factXfl
In developing the very prejudice ho
seeks to allay, anil might cause the
violence he apprehends.
A stranger entered a store In
Oklahoma City and told the clerk
to hold uii his hands. The owner of
the store, entering at this lime,
seeing the clerk's plight laughed,
whereupon the robber shot him. This
was precipitate, however. The owner
was not laughing at life robber but
at the clerk.
Gradually the patronage In the
hands of the members of Congress
have been .withdrawn from their
control. Having only the fourth
class postmaster left to them to
appoint, It. Is not reasonable to<
suppose the party loaders In Con?
gress will consent to the transfer
of the postal service to a private
syndicate.
Pat McCarren Is still unsubdued.
He says he will be glad to meet the
Democratic State Connimlttee. though
It cannot discipline him; and adds,
this partisan shot, "Brooklyn folks
are most discriminating at the polls.''
Hut MteCarreii Is a little too modest
for the way In which Brooklyn
(rented tho Democratic State ticket.
Mr. Hearst's explanations seem to
need much explaining. Every few
days we are told Just what "never
again to be candidate" means. "Nav
e\" for instance, means hardly ever.
Mr. Hearst Is not In the hands of his.
friends but far he It from him to
deny that he Is in the hands of Fate.

EDITORIAL CLIPPINGS.
All this talk about war with Japan
Is based upon a total misconception of
Japan's financial position. The Mika?
do's country is totally unfit today to
enter , the lists against any first-class
power. The war with Russia serious?
ly dopletod the resources of the em?
pire and loft Japan In a state of ex?
haustion, from which It will require
some years to recover. It must re?
coup Its treasury and win the world's
trade, and to do this It needs years of
peace. Even accepting the theory
that n warlike spirit animates the Jap?
aneso people In consequence of (be
action of the Callfornlans, the likeli?
hood or a conflict Is extremely remote.

(By Associated Press.)
CHICAGO. ILL*., Dec. 1.?Wilbur
Glenn Vollvn, so called successor to
.lohn Alexander Dowle, announced
from bis pulpit that he intended to
found a new ZionjCily. taking ton
picked families ns f%;*~leii8 for the
proposed municipality; Whero' or
when the c'^V Is ,fJ be established he .
does not know, but ho promises lira- {
nor tont announcements in n few days.
The plan contemplates the abandon?
ment of the present /.Ion City by those
I whom he can induce to go with him.
What proportion of the Zion City
I residents he can persuade to relin?
quish their homes In problematical,
but It Is believed ho will find as many
1 difficulties In the way as did Dowle
In trying to establish his projected
paradise in Mexico.
Dowic Yoke Galling.
Those familiar with the situation
say Mr. Vollva owes his present posi?
tion not so much to the whole hearted
confidence of Zlonttes In his leader?
ship as lo their desire to throw off
the Dowle yoke, which had become
financially galling, and to follow the
guidance of some one who might be
able and willing to get them out of
their pecuniary troubles.
If the financial clouds begin to lift
in the present Zion City it is doubt?
ful if more than a handful of recruits
could be enlisted for the proposed new
venture.
Dowie Has Not Threatened.
The friends of John Alexander
Dowle today denied the stories that
the mind of the former lender of the
Zlon Church had become weakened.
Deacon Lewis, a constant companion
of Dowle. said today: ?
"Tho address delivered by Dowie
yesterday wns In some respects Inco?
herent .but It would hnve been easily
understood If he had been allowed 'to
finish. He had been In a deep sleep
Just before coming to the plntform.
nnd without waiting he wont at once
Into his suhjoct.
"The fact Is that bis body Is too
weak to keep up with his mind, which
Is ns clear as a hell. Ho has. howev?
er, hcon vorv ill nnd Is still far from
well."
