Land Grabbers Aci Sustained.
In au opinion delivered by Judge
Harrison of the Supreme Court in two
cases last Thursday, known as the'-laud
grabbers" cases, the constitutionality of
the act was sustained. This was as ex
pected. In the first place a court never
holds a law unconstitutional unless it
be so clearly so, that there is no possible
way to avoid it, the utmost latitude
always being given to the Legislature
in making law.-. It was therefore ex
pected that the act would be sustained.
But the way out of this outrage on tbe
property owners of the State, is to re
peal the law, and this can be attended
to when we elected our next legislative
body. Pledge the candidates to a re
peal of it.
Didn't Know the Law.
Gen. Walker has been twice elected
to Congress under the laws of Virginia
governing electioue. When he was
elected the laws were good enough.
Now that he is defeated they are very
bad. Gen. Walker, however, showed
marked ignorance of their provisions
last Monday in Richmond. He grew
boisterous when Mr. Lawless, the Sec
retary of State, told him ihe packages
had been opened before the canvassing
board met, but mellowed, when Mr.
Lawless showed hiul the law, aud as
strange as it may seem, and as much as
Cci). Walker had bae„ supposed to
study the Virginia election laws, he ad
mitted he did not know that there was
a provision allowing this to be done.
This shows that Gen. Walker has set
out to damn the laws, just as many
others eh>. it has been no unusual
thing to hear men grow furious over
them, who could not state any siugle
provision they contained. Nen, Walk
er is not quite this bad, but he is de
nouncing the very beat that twice cur
ried him safely over the stream.
A Terrible Truth.
Years ago if a man stooped to take
advautage of another simply because
he had the power the entire world de
nounced him. Iv this day aud time it
is yet a crime among a large class of
people, bnt there are many who credit
the advantage takers with, being the"'
brainy men of our country. The latest
crime of this character has just been
unearthed and the President of tiits-:
United States and Mark Hanna arc the
guilty parties. The story is best told,
by Hon. John Sherman, who since the I
death of James G. Blame, racks as the
brightest light in the Republican party.
Mr. Sherman says:
"I was always a supporter of Presi
dent McKinley. You know that what
ever he desired to have—goveruor, pres
ident, anything—l sustained. They
always called upon me, and I respond
ed. But Ido not believe that my sug
gestions or wishes would now be sus
tained by the administration. I con
sented to give up my scat ;is I did nor
want to appear exacting. Always with I
good nat ure 1 have subscribed to the
program. I think that I have; been]

I know that Hanna wanted ihe rest of!
i> y term, and as he had always been
friendly to me I did not desire to seem j
disobliging. So I resigned my seat and
went into the cabinet Mr. Hanna re
ceived tbe rest of my term, but wheu
be tried for a term for himself he could
only get it by a single vote notwith
standing thoadministration's support.
It then began to be said (hat 1 was
growing forgetful and senile. Hanna,
whom I had obliged with my seat was
among tbe first to say that I had lost
ray mentality. It wai wa a very kind
return for my vacating my seat foi
Was there ever a greater trick played?

who loves his party Mr. Sherman has
Withheld from the public this statement, j
but when be Lord that Mr. Hanna, i
had said that he, Sherman, was "grow-'
ing forgetful find senile." ir was too
much for tbe old man and he could not
longer withhold the truth thai
known only to himself. The Obiausj
had always elected Mr. Sherman to the
Senate by a unanimous vote, but when
Mr. Hanna came along for re-election lie
won by one vote and was afterwards I
indicti.il for bribery in securing that j
much. Men In office should always be j
grateful to those who aided them in
their promotion, but McKinley and
Hanna appear to be without this princi '

STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND VINDICATOR.
This subject is waxing warm. The j
styrm centers of the opposition are I'.os
ton and Baltimore, so say experts.
These two large and influential cities
are powers of course, but they do not
control the destiny of this country as!
they must sooner or later learn. The
trouble at Boston is that Mr. Hoar
has grown old, he thinks in the past
in.-tead of the future tense. He, like
in uy men who have been giving atten
tiou to national affairs, thinks he has a l
copyright on the business. But annex
ation is fixed and certain, and they who
oppose it might as will cry no moreover
spilt milk, but go to work to fill the
bucket again. Every time the United
St itcs lias advanced her territorial lines
the pessimists have issued warnings, and c
sent forth gloomy foreboding, dangers j
haw been abundant. Yet the country !
'•viiii ou regardless ot these sad and sor-
I rowfal people. There is no very good
Ireason for a large country going to'
B c] nicker than a small one. Khode
Island is really no safer in its polities] I
Idestiny than New York or Texas. Rus
sia is no nearer destruction so far as wel
lean Bee, than Denmark, or Sweedeu.
So that we must conclude that it is not
lhe size which weakens. The most
powerful nation iv the world is admit
ted to be England, aud yet her policy is
i.c acquire every foot of ground she can
lind. Do any of tho.-e who see so much
danger ahead, see disintegration, aud
decay in oar mother country ? We are
the same people, why may we uot have
a government in many respects like
hers, and why may we not own colonies
aud have our Bag planted as England
plants hers in every land and every
clime? Let what come, soever, we
are now the owners of territory stretch
ing nearly half way round the earth,
and whilst we have our internal bick
cringe, we know of no feeling that can
make our home, our central govern-1
ment anything but one of great strength
ou account of the loyalty, aud uatioua!
devotion of the people. England has
unified her home government by rea
son of her foreign holdings and colonial I
policy. To touch her is to touch a hive, I
every inmate is stirred to the utnmst
degree. We believe therefore that the
same result will follow here. We be
lieve instead of weakness the acquire
ment of the territory now about to come
into our possession will prove a source
of strength in that it will broaden our
'conceptions, increase our loyalty, en
gender more national pride, and in
'many ways add new strength to every
fiber of our being, take us out of our
