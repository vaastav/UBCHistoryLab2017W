Uncompromising Attitude As

on Question Calls Halt

Russia Declared to Be Highly
Dissatisfied With Ismet
on Straits Question '
LAUSANNE, Dec. 9. (By the Asso
ciated Press) European delegates
who attended the meeting of the sub
commissions devoted to discussion of
the treatment of foreigners in Turkey
and the disposition of the Ottoman
debt described the attitude of the
Turkish representatives participating
therein as recalcitrant. The question
at issue before the former subcom
mission today was the position of
foreign property holders, and two
young deputies who recently arrived
from Angora adopted an attitude
which seemed to augur intransigence
when the vital question of foreign
ports is to be considered later. No
advance was made at the session.
At the meeting of the subcommis
sion on the Ottoman debt the Turks
said they would refuse to accept re-,
sponsibility for the entire Turkish
debt contracted during the great war
and insisted that it should be divided
pro rata between Mesopotamia, Syria
and . those parts of Greece, Bulgaria
and Jugo-Slavta which formerly be
longed to Turkey. . ... .-
The allies have announced that
they cannot accept this view, and a
deadlock exists on the question.

When the war closed, it was de

service should be perpetuated by the
creation of a like number of scholar
ships, by which young American uni

Satisfactory Settlement of

YET FAR FROM ACCORD
Mussolini Advocates Full
Publicity of Sessions
But Fails in Deed
LONDON. Dec. 10. (By the Asso
ciated Press) Premier Bonar 1-aw
caused a sensation at the seconl ,
session of the allied premiers this
atteraoon, when, in the course of his
reply to M. Poincare's moratorium
plan, he gave clear indication that
the British government would be
quite willing to reconsider the ques
tion of cancellation of th French
debt, provided such a step was made
pjossible by a reparations settlement
satisfactory to Great Britain.
Mr. Bonar Law had previously In
timated that America's insistence
on the payment of the British debt
had made it very difficult for Ens
land to discuss remission of the
French war debt.
The British prime minister's declar
ations at the afternoon meeting
greatly encouraged . Premier Poin
care who was extremely pessimistic
in the day over the outcome of the
conversations.
While the premiers are far from
an accord as yet, it was said by the
French delegation this evening that
Bonar Law's pronuncement on the
debts had made an agreement mini
more Likely. . . .
The British prime minister brlelly
outlined the kind of settlement he
desired a moratorium sufficient to
Germany to re-establish for finance
and credit and stablize the mark, no
military action of any character by
the French and a reduction of Hie
indeminity to between thirty and
forty billion gold marks.
This statement is expected to have
the effect of making M. Poincare
more conciliatory and less inclined
to take about military measures,
although he himself believes that
military measures would not prove
very effective. Another new element
which may help the conference is
an agreement developed tonight
