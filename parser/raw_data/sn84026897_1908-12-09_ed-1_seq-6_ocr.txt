The message of President Roosevelt
to the second session of the Sixtieth
Congress vas read in both houses,
and was in- substance as follows :
To the Senate and House of Repres
entatives; .
Finances.
The financial standing of the nation
at thc present time is excellent, and
the financial management of the na
tion's interests by the Government
during; the last seven years has shown
the most satisfactory results. But
oar currency system is imperfect, ?nd
it is earnestly to be hoped that the
Cuneney Commission will be able to
propose a thoroughly good system
.which will do away with the existing
defects.
During the period from July 1,
.1901, to September 30, 190S, there |
tvas an increase in the amount of
money in circulation of $902,991,399.
The increase in the per capita during
this, period was $7.06. Within this
time there were ? several occasions
?hen it was necessary for the Treas
urer-Department to come to the relief
of the money market by purchases of
redemptions of United States bonds;
hy Increasing deposits in national
banks; by stimulating additional is
sues of national bank notes, and by
faciiiti tating importations from
abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur
rency system has made these proceed
ings^, necessary, and they svere effec
tive until the monetary disturbance
in the fall of 1907 immensely increas
ed, the difficulty of ordinary methods
of relief. By the middle of Novem
ber the available working balance in
tte Treasury had been reduced to ap
proximately $5,000,000. Clearing
boase associations throughout the
country had been obliged to resort to
tte ejqpcdicnt of issuing clearing
boase certificates, to bc used as
money. Ia this emergency it was de
termined to iavitc subscriptions for
$50,000.000 Panama Canal bonds, and ?
$100,000,000 3 per cent certificates of
indebtedness authorized by the act of
June 13,190S. It was proposed to re
deposit in the national banks the pro
ceeds o? these issues, and to permit
their use as a basis for additional cir
ca latin*; notes of national banks The
morai effect of this procedure was so
great that it was necessary to issue
on?y ^4?B35S0 of thc Panama Canal
?onds and $15,436,500 of the certifi
cates of indebtedness.
Baring- the seven years and three
montos there has been a net surplus
of near?y one hundred millions of re
ceipts over expenditures, a reduction
of the interest-bearing-debt by ninety
millions, m spite of the extraordinary
expense of the Panama Canal, and a
saving- of nearly nine millions on the
annan! interest charge. This is an
.exceedingly satisfactor}' showing, es
-pecially in view of the fact that dur
:ing tins period the Nation has never
hesitated to undertake any expendi
ture that it regarded as necessary.
'There have been no new taxes and no
-increase ?f taxes; on the contrary
.sotae tases have been taken off ; there
liras ?mm a reduction of taxation.
/ " Corporations,
c As regards the great corporations
engaged in interstate busin?ss, and
especially the railroads, I can only
repeat what I have already again and
again said in my message to the Con
gress. 1 believe that under thc inter
state classe of the Constitution the
" United States has complete and para
mount right to control all agencies of
interestatc commerce ,and I believe
that the National Government r.lcr.e i
can exercise this right with wisdom
and effectiveness so as both to secure
justice from, and to do justice to, the
great corporations which are the most
important factors in modern business.
I believe that it is worst than folly
to attempt to . prohibit all combina
tions as is done by the Sherman anti
trust law, because such a law can be
enforced only imperfectly and un
eqnally, and its enforcement works
almost as .much hardship as good. I
strongly advocate that instead of an
unwise effort to prohibit all combina
tions, there shall be substituted a law
?which shall expressly permit combina
tions which are in the interest of the
public, bot shall at the same time
give to some, agency of the National
Government full power of control and
supervision over them. One of -the
chief features, of this control should
''be securing' entire publicity in all
matters whieh the public has a right
to know, and furthermore, the power,
not "by judicial but by executive
action, to prevent or put a stop to
every form of improper favoritism or
other wrongdoing.
The railways of the country should
be put completely under the Int er
state Commerce Commission and re
moved from the domain of the anti
trust law. The power of the Commis
sion should be made through going, so
that it could exercise complete super
vision and control over the issue of

most valuable features in recent legi

lie che representatives of the publ:
should have complete power to st

this power should also be exercised s
as to see that.no injustice is done t
the railroads. The share-holders, th
employees and thc shippers all hn"

to the interest of all of them that h
swindling stock speculation should b
allowed, and that there should be n

the successful building and snccessfi
management of railroads should r:
ceive ample remuneration; but n

to this the interests of the share
holders, of the employees, and of thi
shippers should all be guarded a?

Telegraph and telephone companies
engaged in interstate business should

Labor.
There are many matters affecting
labor and the status of the wage
worker to which I should like to draw
your attention, but an exhaustive dis
cussion of the problem in all its as
pects is not now necessary. This ad
ministration is nearing its end; and,
moreover, under our form of govern
ment the solution of the problem de
pends upon the action of thc R<-at?s
as much as upon' the action of the
Nation. Nevertheless, there are cer
tain considerations which I wish to
set before you, because I hope that
our people will more and more keep
them in mind. A blind and ignorant
resistance to every effort for the re
form of abuses and for the readjust
ment of society to modern industrial
conditions represents not true conser
vatism but an, incitement to the wild
est radicalism; for wise radicalism
and wise conservatism go hand in
hand, one bent on progress, the other
bent on seeing that no change is made
unless in the right direction. I be
lieve in a steady effort, or perhaps it
would bc more accurate to say in
steady efforts in many different direc
tions, to bring about a condition of
affairs under which the men who work
with hand or brain, the laborers, the
superintendents, the men who pro
duce for the market and the men
who find a market for the articles
produced, shall own far greater
share than at present of the wealth
they produce, and be enabled to in
vest it in the tools and instruments by
which all work is carried on. As far
as possible I hope to see a frank rec
ognition of the advantages conferred
by machinery, organization, and di
vision of labor, accompanied by an
effort to bring about a larger share
in the ownership by wage-workers of
railway, mill, and factory. In farm
ing, this simply means that we wish
to see the farmer own his own land;
we do not, wish to sec the farms so
large that they become the property
cf absentee landlords who farm them
by tenants, nor yet so small that the
fanner becomes like a European peas
ant. Again, the depositors in our
saving, banks now number, over one
tenth of our entire population. These
are all capitalists, who through the
savings banks loan their money to
the workers-that^ is, in many cases
to themselves-tb carry on their var
ious industries. The more we increase
their number, the more we introduce
the principles of cooperation into our
industry. Every increase in the num
ber of small stockholders in corpora
tions is a "good thing, for the same
reasons: and where the sraployees are
the stockholders the result is particu
larly good. Very much of this move
ment must be outside of anything that
can be accomplished by legislation ;
but legislation can do a good deal.
Postal savings hanks will make it
easy for the poorest to keep their
savings in absolute safely. The reg
ulation of the national highways must
be such that they shall serve all peo
ple with equal justice. Corporate
finances must be supervised so as to
make it far safer than at present for |
Humor and Philosophy.
There are a lot of good people that
are most horribly uninteresting and

associate with the aforesaid good
people to the imporveraent of both.

th? man of small means to invest his
money in stocks. There must be pro
hibition of child labor, diminution of
woman labor, shortening of hours of
all mechanical labor; stock watering
should be prohibited, and stock gamb
ling so far as is possible discouraged.
There should be a progressive inheri
tance tax on large fortunes. Indus
trial education should be encouraged,
As far as possible we should lighten
the burden of taxation on the small
man. We should put a premium upon
thrift, hard work, and business ener
gy; but these qualities cease to bc the
main factors in accumulating a for
tune long before that fortune reaches
a point where it would be seriously
affected by any inheritance tax such
as I propose. It is eminently right
that the Nation should fix the terms
upon which the great fortunes are in
herited. They rarely do good and
they often do harm to those who in
herit them in their entirety.
The above is the merest .sketch,
hardly even a sketch in outline, of
the reforms for which we should
work. But there is one matter with
which the Congress should deal at this
session. There should no longer be
any paltering with thc question of
taking care of the wage-workers who,
under our present industrial system,
beccme killed, crippled, or worn out
as part cf thc regular incidents of a
given business. The majority of wage
workers must have their rights se
cured for them by State action; but
the National Government should leg
islate in thoroughgoing and far-reach
ing fashion not only for all employees
of thc National Government, but for
all persons engaged in interestate
commerce. The object sought for
cuold be achieved to a measurable de
gree, as far as those killed or crippled
are concerned, by proper employers'
liability laws. As far as conecrns
those who have been worn out, I yali
your attention to the fact that definite
slops toward provding old-age pen
sions have been taken in many of our
private industries. These may be in
definitely extended through voluntary
association and contributory schemes,
or through the agency of savings
banks, as under thc recent Massachu
setts plan. To strengthen these prac
tical measures should be our imrae-j
diate duty ; it is not at present neces
sary to consider the larger and moie
general governmental schemes that
most Europena governments have
found themselves obliged to adopt.
I renew my recommendation made
in a previous message that half-holi
days be granted during summer to all
wage-workers in Government emplqy.
I also renew my recommendation
that the principle of the eight-hour
day should as rapidly and as far as
practicable be extended to the entire
work being carried on by the Govern
ment; the present law should be
amended to embrace contracts on
those public works which the present
wording of the act seems to exclude.
The Courts.
I most earnestly urgejipon the Con
gress the duty of increasing the to
tally inadequate salaries now given
to our Judges. On the whole there is
no body of public servants who do as
valuable work, nor whose moneyed re
ward is so inadequate compared to
their work. Beginning with the Su
preme Court the Judges should have
their salaries doubled. It is not be
fitting the dignity of the Nation that
its most honored public servants
should be paid sums so small compar
ed to what they would earn in private
life that the performance of public
service by them implies an exceeding
ly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.
It is earnestly to be desired that
some method should bc devised for
doing away with the long delays
which now obtain in the administra
tion of justice, and which operate
with peculiar severitv against persons
of small means, and favor only thc
very criminals whom it is most de
sirable to punish. These long delays
in the final decisions of cases make in
the aggregate a ciwing evil ; and a
remedy should be devised. Much of
this intolerable delay is due to im
proper regard paid to technicalities
which are a mere hindrance to justice.
In some noted recent, cases this over
regard for technicalities has resulted
in a striking denial of justice, and
flagrant wrong to the body politic.
Forests.
If there is any one duty which more
than another we owe it to our children
and our children's children to per
form at once, it is to save the forests
of this country, for they constitute
the first and most important element
in the conservation of the natural re
sources of our country. There are of
course two kinds of natural resources.
One is the kind which can only be
used as part of a process of exhaus
tion; this is time of mines, natural
oil and gas wells, and the like. The.
other, and of course ultimately by far
the most important, includes the re
sources which can be improved in the
process of wise use; the soil, the riv
ers, and the forests come under this
head. Any really civilized nation
will so use all of these three great
national assets that the nation will
have their benefit in the future. Just
as n farmer, after all his life making
his living from his farra, will, if h'e
is ?in expert farmer, leave it as an
assit of increased value to his son, so
we ?riiould leave our national domain
to oir children, increasd in value and
not worn out. There are small sec
tions of our own country, in thc East
and in the West, in the Adirondacks,
the White Mountains, and the Appa
lachians, and in the Rockv Mountains,
where we can alreadv see for oursel
ves the damage in thc shape of per
manent injury to the soil and the
river systems which comes from reck
less deforestation. It matters not
whether this deforestation is due to
the actual cutting of timber, to the

Inland Waterways.
Action should be begun forthwith
during the present session of tin
Congress, for the improvement of nu
inland waterways-action which wi i
result in giving us noe onlv navi
gable but navigated rivers. We hav
spent hundreds of millions of dolla1"
upon these waterways, vet the trafli
on nearly all of them is steadily de
dining. This condition is thc ditec
result of thc absence of any comnre
hensive and far-seeing plan of waler
way improvement. Obviously we ea:
not continue thus to expend the rev
cnues of the Government without re
turn. It is poor business to spen<
money for inland navigation unies:
we get it.
Denatured Alcohol.
I had occasion in my message o:
May 4, 1900, to urge the passage o:
some law putting alcohol, used in tin
arts, industries, and manufactures
upon the free.list; that is, to providi
for the withdrawal free of tax o:
alcohol which is to be denatured fo:
those purposes. The law'of June 7
1906,' and its amendment of March 2
1907, accomplished what was desiree
in that respect, and thc use of de
natured alcohol, as intended, is mak
ing a fair degree of progress and ii
entitled to further encouragement anc
support from the. Congress.^
Pure Pood.
The pure food legislation has al

Indian Affairs.
It has been my purpose from the
beginning of my administration tc
take the Indian Service completelj
out of the atmosphere of political
activity, and there has been stead}
progress toward that end. The last
remaining stronghold of politics ir
that service was the agency system,
which had seen its best days and was
gradually falling to pieces from nat
ural or purely evolutionary causes,
but, like all such survivals, w?s de
caying slowly in its later stages. It
seems clear that its extinction had
better be made final how, so that thc
ground can be cleared for larger con
structive work on behalf, of the In
dians, preparatory to their induction
into the full measures of responsible
citizenship. On November 1 only
eighteen agencies were left on the
roster, with two exceptions, where
some legal questions seemed to stand
temporarily in the way, these have
been changed to superintendencies,
and their heads brought ,into . the
classified civil service.
Secret Service.
The law enacted by the last session
of Congress to provide that there
should be no detail from the Secret
Service and no transference there
from seems to have been only in
the interest of the criminal classes,
both large and small, and as a mat
ter of common interest should be re
pealed and the old system re-enact
ed.
Corporations are necessary instru
ments of modem business. They have
been permitted to become a menace
largely because the govermental rep
resentatives of the people have work
ed slowly in providing adequate con
trol over them. 'j
Control over the great corporations
doing interstate business can be ef
fective enly when such control is
vested in the executive department
of the government.
Postal Savings Banks.
I again renew my recommendation
for postal savings banks, for deposit
ing savings with the security of thc
Government behind them. The object
is to encourage thrift and eeonomv
in? the wage-earner, and nerson of
moderate means. In fourteen States
the deposits in savings banks as re
ported to the Comptroller of the
Currency amount to $3,590,245,402, or
9S.4 per cent of the entire deposits,
while in the remaining 32 States there
are only $70,308,543, or 1.6 per cent
showing conclusively that there are
many localities in the United States
where sufficient opportunity is not
given to the people to deposit their
savings. The result is that money is
kept in hiding and unemployed. .It
is believed that in the aggregate vast
sums of money would be brought in
to circulation through the insirumenT
tality of the postal savings banks.
While there are only 1,453 savings
banks reporting to the Comptroller
there arc more than 61,000 post-offices
40,000 of which are money. .Order of
fices. Postal savings banks are now
in operation in practically all the
great civilized countries with the ex
ception of the United States.
Parcel Post. .
In my last annual message I com
mended the Postmaster-General's re
commendation for an extension of the
parcel post on the. rural routes. Thc
establishment of a local parcel post
on rural routes would be to the mu
tual benefit of thc. farmer and the
country storekeeper, and it is de
sirable that the routes, serving more
than 15,000.000 people, should be
utilized to the fullest practicable ex
tent. An amendment was proposed
in the Senate at the last session, at
the suggestion of the Postmaster
General, providing that, for the pur
pose of ascertaining the practicability
of establishing a special local parcel
post system on the rural routes
throughout the United - States, the
Postmaster General be authorized and
directed to experiment and report to
the Congress the result of such ex
periment by establishing a special
local parcel post system on rural de

rural carriers. It would seem only
proper that such an experiment
should be tried in order to demon
strate the practicability of the prop
osition, especially as the Postmaster
General estimates that the revenue
derived from the opeation of such a
system on all the rural routes would
amount to manv million dollars.
Education.
The share that the National Gov
ernment should take in the broad
work of education has not received
the attention and thc care it rightly
deserves. The immediate responsi
bility for the support and improve
ment of our educational systems and
institutions rests and should always
rest with the people of the several
States acting through their state and
local governments, but the Nation
has an opportunity in education work
which must not be lost and a duty
which should no longer be neglected.
With the limited means hitherto
provided, the Bureau of Education
has rendered efficient service, but the
Congress has neglected to adequately
supply the bureau witt means to meet
the educational growth of the coun
try. . The appropriations for the? gen
eral work of thc bureau, out side edu
cation in Alaska, for the year 1909
?ire but $S7,500-an amount less than
they were ten years a<ro, and some of
the important items in these appro
priations are less than they were
thirty years ago. It is an inexcusable
waste of public money to appropri
ate an amount which is so inade
quate as to make it impossible prop
erly to do the work authorized, and
it is unfair to the great educational
interests of the country to deprive
them of the value of the results which
can be obtained by proper appropri
ations.
Census.
I strongly urge that the request of
the Director of the Census in connec
tion with the decennial work so soon
to be begun, be complied with and
that the appointments to the census
force be placed under the civil ser
vice law, waiving the geographical
requirements as requested by the Di
rector of the Census. The supervisors
and enumerators should not be ap
pointed under the civil service law,
for the reasons given by the Director.
I commend to the Congress the care
ful consideration of the admirable re
port of thc Director of the Census,
and I trust that his reeommedations
will be adopted and immediate action
thereon taken.
Soldiers' Home.
All Soldiers' Homes should be plac
ed under the complete jurisdiction
and control of the War Department.
Independent Bureaus and Commis
sions.
Economy and sound business policy
require that all existing independent
bureaus and commissions should be
placed under the juridiction of ap
propriate executive departments. It
is unwise from every standpoint, and
results only in mischief, to have any
executive work done save by the
purely executive bodies, under the
control of the President: and each
such' executive body should be under
the immediate supervision of a Cabi
net Minister.
Statehood..
I advocate the immediate admis
sion of New Mexico and Arizona as
States. This should be done at the
present session of the Congress. The
peoDle of the two Territories have
made it evident by their votes that
they will not come in as ?one State.
The only alternative is to admit them
as two. and I trust that this will be
done without delay.
Interstate Fisheries.
I call the attention of the Con
gress to the importance of the prob
lem of the fisheries in the interstate
waters. On the Great Lakes we arc
now. under the very Arise treaty of
April 11th, of this year, endeavoring
to come to an international agree
ment for the preservation and satis
factory lise of the fisheries of these
waters can not otherwise be achieved.
Lake Erie, for example, has the rich
est fresh water fisheries in the world;
but it is now controlled bv the
statutes of two Nations, four States,
and one Province, and in this Prov
ince by different ordinances in dif
ferent counties. All these political
divisions work at cross purposes, and
in no case they achieve protection to
the fisheries, on the one hand, and
justice to the localities and individ
uals on thc other. The case is simi
lar in Puget Sound.
Fisheries and Fur Seals.
The federal statute regulating in
terstate traffic in game should be ex
tended to include fish. New federal
fish hatcheries should be estbalislied.
The administration of the Alaskan
fur-seal service should be vested in
the Bureau of Fisheries.
Foreign Affairs.
This Nation's foreign policy is
based 011 fnc theory that right must
be done between nations precisely as
between individuals, and in our ac
tions for the Inst ten years we have
in this matter proven our faith by
our deeds. We have behaved and are
behaving, towards other nations, as in
private life an honorable man would
behave towards his fellows.
Latin-American Republics.
The commercial and material pro
gress of the twenty Latin-American
Republics is worthy of the careful
attention of the Congress. No other
section of the world has- shown a
greater proportionate development of
its foreign trade during the last ten
years and none other has more sneeial
claims on thc interest of the United
States. It offers today probably
larser opportunities for the lo<riti

mate extension of our commerce than
any other group of countries. These
countries will want our products in
greatly increased quantities, and we
shall correspondingly need theirs.
The International Bureau of the Am
erican Republics is doing a useful
work in making these nations and
their resources better known to us,
?nd in acquainting them not only
with us as a people and with our
purposes towards them, but with
what we have -to exchange for their
goods. It is an international insti
tution supported by all the govern
ments of the two Americas.
Panama Canal .
The work on the Panama Canal
is being done with a speed, efficiency
and entire devotion to duty, which
make it a model for all work of the
kind. No task of such magnitude has
ever before been undertaken by any
nation; and no task of the kind has
ever been better performed. The men
on the Isthmus, from Colonel Goe
thals and his fellow commissioners
through the entire list of employees
who are faithfully doing their duty,
have won their right to the ungrudg
ing respect and gratitude of the Am
erican people.
Ocean Mail Lines.
I again recommend the extension
of the ocean mail act of 1891 so that
satisfactory American ocean, lines to
South America, Asia, the PHilipiries,
and Australia may be established.
The creation of such steamship lihes
should be the natural corollary of the
voyage of the battle fleet. It should
precede the opening of the Panama
Canal. Even under favorable con
ditions several years must elapse be
fore such lines can be put into opera
tion. Accordingly I urge that the
Congress act promptly where fore
sight already shows that action soon
er or later will be inevitable.
The Anny.
As regards the Army I call atten
tion to the fact that while our junior
officers and enlisted men stand very
high, the present system of promo
I tion by seniority results in bringing
into the higher grades many men of
mediocre capacity who have but a
short time to serve. No man should
regard it as his vested right to rise
to the highest rank in the Army any
more than in any other profession.
It is a curious and by no means cred
itable fact that there should be so
often a failure on the part of the
public and its representatives to un
derstand the great need, from the
standpoint of the service and the Na
tion, of refusing to promote respect
able, elderly incompetents. The
higher places should be eiven to the
most deserving men without regard
to seniority; at least seniority should
be treated as onlv one consideration.
In the stress of modern industritl
competition no business ' firm could
succeed if those responsible for its
management were chosen simply on
the ground that t.<ey were the oldest
people in its employment; yet this is
the course advocated as regards the
army, and required by law for all
grcfdes except those of general officer.
As a matter of fact, all of thc best
officers in the highest ranks of the
army are those who have attained
their present position whollv or in
part by a process of selection. -
The Navy.
I approve the recommendations of
the General Board for the increase of
the \Navy, calling especial attention
to the need of additional destroyers
and colliers, and above all, of the
four battleships.' It is desirable to
complete as son as possible a squad
ron of eight battleshins of the best
existing type. The North Dakota,
Delev.-are, Florida and Utah will form
thc first of this squadron. Thc four
vessels p?oposcd will form the second
division. It will be an improvement
on the first, the ships being of the
heavy, single caliber, all big gun
type. All the vessels should have the
same tactical qualities, that is, speed
and turning circle, and as near as
possible these tactical qualities
should be the same as is in the four
vessels before named now being
built.
Thc American people have cause
for profound gratification, both in
view of the excellent condition of the
fleet as shown by this cruise ,and in
view of thc improvement the cruise
has worked in this already high con
dition. I do not believe that there is
any other service in the world in
which the average of character 'and'
efficiency in the enlisted men is as
high as is now the case in our own.
I believe that thc same statement can
be made as to our officers, taken as a
whole; but there must bc a reserva
tion made in regard to those in the
highest ranks-as to which I have al
ready spoken-and in regard to those
who have just entered the service;
because we do not now get full bene
fit from our excellent naval school
at Annapolis. It is absurd not to
graduate the midshipmen as ensigns;
to keep them for two years in such
an anomalous position as at present
the law requires is detrimental to
them-and lo the service. In the aca
demy itself, every first classman
should be required in turn to serve
as petty officer and officer; his abil
ity to discharge his duties as such
should be a prerequisite to his going
into the line, and his success in com
manding should largely determine his
standing at graduation. The Board
of Visitors should bo appointed in
January, and each member should be
required to give at least six days'
service' only from one to three days'
to be performed during June week,
which is the least desirable time for
the board tb be at Annapolis so far
as benefiting the navy by their ob
servations in concerned.

WWMMRS_ MEEI
Second Session of the Sixtieth
Congress Begins Its Work
SEVERAL?NEW MEMBERS SWORN
If the Republican Leaders Retain
Present Views There Will Be very
Little Else Done by the Con?.-ess
Except Appropriate Money Foi
Various and Sundry Objects.
"Washington, Special.-If Republi
can leaders retain their present views
the legislation of the session of Con
gress which began Monday will in
clude very little except the appro
priation bills. These bills will carry
in the aggregate about $1,000,000,000,,
and the general opinion is that in the
time that will bc allowed, the two
houses will find they can best serve
the country by giving proper atten
tion to these appropriations.
There will bc a general effort to
hoi,} the appropriations down to the
lowest possible limit. It is generallv
understood that there will be a bill
for the improvement of rivers and
harbors, to carry not less than $25.
.000,000 or $30,000,000. Provision
must be made this year for the cen
sus of 1910, and this will require not
less than $10,000,000. There will be
other exceptional demands, so that as
j it looks now Congress will do well
if it succeeds in holding the appro
priations for the second session of
the Sixitieth Congress to the dimen
sions of those of the first session.
The House* committee on ?ppropria
tions already has begun its work on
the sundry hills.
The fr rt that the managers desire
to restrict legislation will not pre
vent other members of the Senate
and House from exerting their efforts
in behalf of favorite measures. The
first effort in this direction will be
made in thc Senate by Mr. Foraker,
who will renew his attempt to have
passed the bill authorizing the re
enlistment of the negro soldiers dis
charged Avithout honor on account of
the Brownsville riot. This measure
will be the special order for Decem
ber 16th. Senator . Beveridge will .
make an effort to obtain early con
sideration of his child labor bill, and
Senator Carter, of the postal savings
bank bill.
It is quite certain that the recent
agreement between the United States
and Japan will receive early consid
eration in the Senate. Already i\
.number of Senators have privately
expressed disapproval of the fact;
that the compact, was entered into
without consulting the Senate.
Monday at 12 o'clock both houses
of Congress convened for the begin
ning of the second session of the Six
tieth Congress. Practically no busi
ness was transacted in either house
Monday. In the Senate ex-Governor
Cummins, of Iowa, took the oath of
office as the successor of Senator Al
lison ,as did Carroll S. Page,-of Ver
mont, as the successor of Senator /
Stewart. In the House the seven
members who were elected in Novem
ber to succeed members who have
died or resigned, arc Henry A. Barn
hart, Democrat, who succeeds the lat?!
Mr. Brick, Republican, from the thir
teenth Indiana district; Albert Esto
pi?al, Democrat, who succeeds the
late Mr. Meyer from the first Louis
iana district; Otto G. Foelker, Re
publican, .successor to Mr. Dunwell,
Republican, in the third New York
district; Frank E. Guernsey. Repub
lican, successor to Mr. Powers, Re
publican, frcm tho fourth Ma i ne dis
trict;; Eben M.'Masters, Republican,
successor to Mr. Parker. Republican,
from South Dakota at large; O. C.
Wiley, Democrat, successor to his
brother, A. A. Wiley, Democrat, from
the second Alabama district, and
John P. Swansay, Republican, suc
cessor to Mr. Littlefield, who resigned
during the last session from the sec
ond Maine district.
The two houses appointed commit
lees each to notify the other House
and the President that the two bodies
were organized and .prepared to go
forward with the business of the ses
sion. The Senate then adjourned for
the day, out of respect to the mem
ory of Senator Allison, who died dur
ing the recess. The House terminat
ed its bref session with resolution?
commemorative of the lives of
Messrs, Parker, Wiley, Dunwell and!
Powers, who have died since adjourn
ment last May.
