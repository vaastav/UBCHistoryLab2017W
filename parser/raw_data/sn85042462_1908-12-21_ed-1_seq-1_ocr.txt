Herald and Its readers to be celebrated

Simpson auditorium, both on South
Hope Street, on the afternoon of De
cember 26, will be in full swing.
There are some surprises which the

it may be stated that Al Levy and his
corps of aides who have general
charge of the feast have placed orders
for tin' best of- everything, and the
produce exchange of Los Angeles, with
its usual generosity, has agreed that
most of the victuals shall.be furnished

Secret of Happiness
The pursuit of happiness is the In
alienable right of man. A happy
Christmas is the Inalienable right, of
all children.
The laws of nature and the constitu
tion of the United States give this
privilege to every man who has tho
spunk to work for it and to claim It
when Ire has earned It, li is the duty
of the community to see that no child
Is cheerless on Christmas day.
That Is why The Herald lias under
taken the stewardship of the fund
being raised for the big Christmas
feed, entertainment and distribution.
.Happiness, the kind that won't rub
off. according to the best philosophy^
consists mainly In making other happy.
That being conceded, here is an oppor
tunity for everybody to share in the
joy. .
Contributors are conferring a lasting
happiness on themselves, are helping to
keep crime down and are fulfilling the
advice of the sages of old in seeing that
no child is forgotten by Santa Claus.
Gifts by Boys
Two letters, written in behalf of boys,
show the kind hearts that beat. in

COMMENDABLE WORK
OF HERALD FRIENDS
The California Independent of Los
Angeles, of which Andrew Park has
just taken editorial charge, in its cur
rent issue calls attention to the
Christmas dinner and entertainment.
The Independent is full of good things
this week, but nothing, perhaps, strikes
the Christmas keynote more true than
this editorial reprinted here:
A Great Work by The Herald
The Los Angeles Herald is doing a
most commendable and praiseworthy
work in preparing to feed about 3000
children at the Y. M. <:. A. hall on
Christinas day.
The excellency of this work Is not
measured alone by the pleasures and
comforts that will be given the chil
dren on that day, but will live In their
memories in years to come, and no
doubt will have much to do with de
termining heir characters, for a child
to be hungry and cold on Christmas
day, and that within full hearing of
church bells where the more fortunate
are to receive . presents, Is sad In a
degree inexpressible; but for that child
to know that other hearts beat In sym
patyh with It and to be the recipient
of kindness linking Its affections to the
kind givers is to Inspire it to a noble
life. **■-■■
No doubt hundreds that will be fed
and clothed on Christmas day will in
■ years to come look hack to the Herald
and to the noble people that have as
sisted this journal in Its commendable
work, with not only gratitude, but with
a resolution to emulate this truly
Christian deed. -
i Moreover, the magnitude of this work
is not measured alone by tne good
that it is doing these children, ; but
through the letters i published ln the
Herald from grateful children the at
tention of many of the people of Los
Angeles has been directed to a state
of affairs which but few had knowledge
of formerly, and this has moved many
of our citizens to co-operate with the
Herald in this work of kindness.
Probably do city of the size of Los
Angeles has fever i destitute children,
yet it is a fact within our knowledge
that there are many children in our
city that tire going barefooted to school
and' without sufficient food. This
should not be, but the Judicious method
adopted by the Herald ln calling atten-

CONGRESS' LAST SESSION ONE
OF SNAPPY EVENTS

Political Casualties Forecasted —Chief
Executive's Attack on Senate
May Lead to Much
Trouble
[Special to The Herald.l
WASHINGTON. Dec. With the
adjournment of congress until
after the holidays Washlngton
ians are busily gossiping of the series
of events which already has character
ized the short but snappy sessions of
the second half of the sixtieth congress.
Not the least Important of these
"events" was that portion of the presi
dent's message criticising the higher
law makers in connection with civil
service details. It was like a bomb
hurled into their midst, for it created
havoc not only in the Democratic ranks
but in the Republican ranks as well.
Many senators declare that in sub
stance" and by inference the president
has denounced them as so many ras
cals, and the resolution appointing a
special committee to investigate the
president's language portends political
casualties which old-time prophets
hesitate to forecast. '•*-'
Leading solons say the president has
stirred a hornet's nest with which he
is not yet through.
Aside from the fight between the sen
ate and the chief executive, to say
nothing of the hubbub of gossip which
is Circulating relative to the president's
actions at the close of what had gen
erally been considered a triumphant ad
ministration, there is a great deal of
speculation as to what will ensue from
the president's attack on several of the
large newspapers of the east, whose
enmity he lias created because of their
demands for an Investigation of the
Panama canal bonds deal.
May Resent Attack
These newspapers, the Indianapolis
News, the New York "World and the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch. It Is believed will
bttterly resent the president's attack,
which is considered more or less dam
aging to them because it came in an
exceptionally forceful document—his
message to congress. The president's
messages, it is maintained, should con
tain no reference to political or per
sonal feuds. ■■'.- '.** •;■'
Joseph Pulitzer, whose prosecution
for criminal libel President Roosevelt
practically demands at the hands of the
government's department of justice in
connection with published statements
relative to the $40,000,000 Panama canal
purchase, is editor and proprietor of the
New York World and St. Louis Post-
Dispatch. While bitterly opposing the
nomination of William J. Bryan for the
presidency in the last campaign, the
World was the leading newspaper in
the support of the Democratic ticket in
the east. • ■ .. . • " '
Douglas Robinson, whom the presi
dent defends in his message, and whom
he declares was viciously maligned in
the World's Panama canal articles, is
Mr. Roosevelt's brother-in-law, and a
wealthy and prominent real estate
dealer In New York. Poultney Blgelow.
who throws down the gauntlet to the
president, practically daring Mr. Roose
velt to proceed against htm in court for
his statements relative to the canal, is
a writer of international prominence,
and a personal friend of the German
emperor. At present he is in New York.
These men, it is prophesied, will carry
the controversy now begun to a definite
decision. '"■"' ' * ■ >•"_***'■'* v

during the ■ past six months has dis
closed an organized system of theft
among railroad operators on the Pa

amount estimated at sevral hundred
thousand dollars, according to a state
ment made tonight 'by an • official of
the company who has had charge of
the investigation.
The telegrams with but few excep
tions, were properly .transmitted and

the Western Union 'officials to action.
, A secret service was organized and it
was discovered that In some offices the
thefts are said to have aggregated over
60 per cent of the'messages filed at
railroad offices - where the operators
jointly handle the. commercial business
of the telegraph company and the busi

The United States, Great Britain |

"A neutral ship found within the
limits of belligerent powers may be
seized, destroyed or used for warlike
purposes, but the proprietors must bo

"In cases where the enemy, has no*,

"Such ships must conform to the

"A neutral ship carrying dispatches is

venient reasons, and without special
contention of remuneration, are not
subject to seizure and should not 'be
detained, unless there is a well grounded
cause to suspect a violation of the laws •
of war."
Hospital Ships Exempt
In the. section relating to the ex
emption from capture of hospital ships.
it is suggested that such ships should
give succor and assistance; to - the
wounded, sick and shipwrecked of the
belligerents without distinction of na
tionality. I Belligerents should have the
right to control the movements of and y
visit hospital ships.
They, could refuse their help, or.lei
them away In any direction wished, put y
a commander aboard and even detain
the ships if the gravity of the situation '
requires it.. '" ' ■" • y -. ,ty*
Merchant ships, yachts or neutral ves
eels carrying or picking up belligerent
wounded, sick or shipwrecked should
not be captured on account' of such'
juts, but still be subject for capture-'
for any violations of neutrality they
may have committed.
The American views also -': contain '
proposals as to contraband and I the *
methods of blockading which are sinii- .
jar to those put forth by Great Britain
in a more extensive manner.
