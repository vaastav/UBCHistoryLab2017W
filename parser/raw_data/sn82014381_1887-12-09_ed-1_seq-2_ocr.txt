ME. BLAINE'S REPLY.
Mr. Blame baa made with promptness a
review of the President's menage, taking
TadicaJ isßue mih him, ami enunciating
tlic protective policy with force ar.d clear
ness. He assails the position taken by Mr.
< lereland for retention of internal revenue
in order to force down the taring and thus
expose American lalmr production to un
wholesome foreign competition. But while
In- would remove the domestic t«ilj;icc<i tax,
Mr. Blame says that for moral reasons he!
would retain the whisky tax. This he
bases upon the assumption that decrease in
price would enormonsly increase consnmp
tion. Dpon that point we cannot think
he is in correct. We do not believe that
the drinkers of liquors would Bnd any re
daction of price at the liar. In a gallon
of whisky the reduction would, if
made, be merely a cent or less per drink.
On the contrary, the removal of the tax,
besides abolishing an army of revenue offi
cers, would remove also an incentive to
fraud in compounding, and the consumer
would really get better liquor than now, at
the same price.
Mr. Blame's claim forexpenditure of the
surplus in enlarging coast defenses is one
that will meet with hearty general ap
proval. The nation docs not expect war,
but it is the part of unwisdom to invite
assault, or neglect those ordinary precau
tions which contribute to our armed
strength and inspire respect from other
powers. As now situated, there is scarcely
a port in the I'niti-d Suites that is not at
the mercy of the ordinary ironclads of the
weakest of the nations of the earth.
As a whole, Mr. Blame's reply to the
President is such- a one as will strengthen
the protectionists greatly, and which will
prove extremely annoying to free traders.
Behind Mr. Blame's argument U the pres
ent policy hi" the country which it is urged
it ought to abandon. It has had the repu
tation of l>eing popular with th<j people,
and conservative of manufacturing labor
and producing interests. That policy has
the great advantage of being in poraession
and its ouster, Mr. Cleveland will find, is
no easy task, nor to l>e accomplished with
out a very liv.ly shaking up of the whole
country, in widen sectioaal interests
will be compacted in one part of the land
against those of another, and export
ing and importing businesses :it the great
Beaporta X- arrayed againtt'the manufact
uring industries and the larger portion of
industries dependent upon production from
the soil.
THE WOOL GEOWEES' PBOTEST.
It was a rather singular coincidence that
the annual aeasion of the Wool-Growers'
and Dealers' National Association should
In- held in Washington on the very
<l;iy the President delivered his message to
Congress. The Association let no grass
grow under its feet in passing resolutions
declaring the menage to be a direct "at
tack upon their industry, one of the most
important of the country, and in positive
violation of the national Democratic plat
form of l#B4 as interpreted by the party
leaden and accepted by the rank and file
of the party. The argument made by the
President for the removal of our protec
tion against foreign competition bone re
peatedly made by the enemies of our in
dustrial progress and effectively answered
in nearly every school district of our land
and bo thoroughly disproved by the logic
of facts and the demonstration of experi
ence and history a^ to Deed no answer
from us."
There can be no mistaking this language.
The wool-growers are angered, and argu
ment in rapport of the President's views
will not be likely to mollify them. We
continue their protest in those words:
We had the ri».-iit to expert nmething differ
rom the Chief Kieenttve of a nation tha
mod bappy, prwperooi and co'.'.ented of any
of the world, made bo by the policy ,-,{ protec
tion anil development which he now seeks to
destroy. We had the risrht to expect o;ir Presi
dium would luvor the wool-prmvcrs of the
('nited Stated, and <-on less our deep disappoint
ment that Instead he favors the Interests of our
foreign competitor*. We nuke an appeal from
his recommendations t. the (even mid three-
Rniruu millions of otu fellow-citizens encased
iv mamifrtof.irini:; to the array of wagc-earutrs
to tradesmen and ruerehauls, knowing that
their judgment arid decision will Ik- Ij :.sed upou
justice and patriotism, and will therefore favor
the maintenance of the Amirirun inilirv of pro
tection, to which i!i<; country is indebted for its
unexampled development «ud protperity.
All of which and much more of like im
- I">rt" >rt in the protest adopted, must be ple.i.—
ant reading ior the Presides! and bis
party, who see now that the frfrltarif in
the path to a wcond term, and continued
rnk by the Deinooracj, arc rising thick
and fa.>t and are likoly to tower to th • po
litical skies. Vet wo \i\uA rnilftail tliat
President Cleveland i> not lacking in
courage, fur he mast have known that nefa
prou^ts aa the foregoing would be entered
and that a dedanitioa of policy ooncern
ing the taring which he mighl l i;1 vo loft
for Congress to make, would bring about
lii-cirs the whole anoy of protectionists j
and raise np against him the opposition of
a :*reat number of indoatriee of the
conntry.
ME. E4S3OK OK THE TARIFF.
Hon. Join; A. K:\s-m. of ".>w:i. ;!i
in the December Fanm the Western view
01 the taring considering the free ir .'.■-.
pure :i!;. 1 simple, tli.- ' tari;:ii-.«-f..r-rcvc
nuc-i.nly," nad theprota :': ••ni.-i:-. Ileholds
that on thb absorbing question the soaks
of juetice are held most evenly in tiie West,
as it is 1101 prejudiced by the jn>;iti<al tra
ditionsoi Jforth or Sooth, ami ■ .-Peking
only the good of the wimle oonntry. To
the free trader he declares there is no in
vitation in the West, for he has not pro
■ciui'Cil any iacts to Mipport hi.-, theories.
Tlie real rairtinrtanfai who Jo battle in the
\Y>*st are the reveiimMaritnus and the
protcetaookta. As to ntotetuon, the West
kaa decided for its constitutionality ; the
only question is as to the wisdom of or ad
vantageousness of adopting the policy.
The West has found liy examining the
question, lie hold-, that the foreign pro
ducer, if left to control our markets, will
become a monopolist and regulate prices at
his own will, Imt under a protective tarii!
home producers and competitors, he be
lieves, are multiplied far in excess of the
nuin'ner of the foreign comj>etitors ex
cluded. The West has found by experi
ence, say-, Mr. Ka.-son, that protection of
! nan u fact i ire and production has kept up a
good home market. Thus, Bessemer steel
cost $1 "2o a ton. American EBanuTacturen
onered to place it in market, if protected
by a duty of $22 ">0 a ton — afterwards
made s2B 12. When the competition un
der that shelter began, the English drop
ped their [trice, but competition went on,
without destroying the American interest,
until the steel sold for only a little in ex
cess of the duty figure. So it was with
the silk industry forcing down French
prices. So that the West ha- conn- to be
lieve firmly that protection does not en
hance values, and does encourage industry,
and from this belief Mr. Ka.sson docs not
think the West can l>e shaken, for it found
besides that there was, along with protec
tion, an increased supply of money, as our
imports fell below mir exports. The fann
ers of the West are Gnnly fixed in the be
lief that they are producing more food
than the country consumes, and that more
formers would increase the surplus and
lower prices; they therefore want home
industries developed, in order to enlarge
the number of mouths to be fed. Besides,
he add?, the West " prefers home competi
tion at the same price to foreign, even
were the latter to U> of equal extent with
the former." Be proceeds in this view at
length, and to the patriotic phase of the
question, and holds that the West is for
protection because of ancestral advice,
patriotic purpose and a desire for complete
national independence. How such views
which must lie taken to retlect the major
portion of the sentiment of the West, are
to be estimated in a political contest, in
view of President Cleveland's " scale
down-the-tariH" message, is not difficult to
understand.
WESTERN FAEMEBS SOLVENT.
The labor orators — probably because
misinformed, for they have nothing to
gain by misrepresentations — have been
telling the people that the farmers of the
west part of the country groan beneath a
burden of debt secured by mortgage. But
now comes Mr. Edward Atkinson, the
accomplished statistician, and Bhows by
indisputable figures that the farmers of the
West are ahead of their creditors. Thus
of 200,000 Western mortgages on farm
land covering from four to thirty-eight
years, and securing $180,000,000, 119,000
have been itnid in the .sum of £10-3,000,000.
This does not look like following a losing
vocation. So, too, while they have been
paving off, from profits made from the
soil, interest has declined from an average
of 10 per cent, on mortgages for live years,
to 0] or 7.1 per cent, without commission,
where formerly 10 per cent, commission
was charged.
F. J. Babson, President of the "Fish
ery Union," is out in print saying that hi s
association will never consent to commer
cial union with Canada. Willingly, per
hap.s not ; it was never anticipated. New
England coast communities are not ex
pected to be friendly to the scheme of
reciprocity. The people of the whole
country, ho Fever, .ire to settle this matter,
and we believe it will be done by them
upon a reciprocal basis and a probable
breaking down of the tariff line between
the Canada* and the United States, and
the erection of a tariff harrier similar tn
oar own along the whole exterior line of
the United state* and the Canadas. Com
mercial nni<m between the two countries is
very nearly as certain ea the rising ( >f the
sun, but it may be delayed a tew years,
owing to the. resistance of such associations
as the " Fishery Union, 11
The San Francisco Bulletin makes a good
point when, referring to the President's
claim that unjust taxes sin, uld lie removed
from the necessaries of life, it saw* : "If
the alimentary necessaries of life are meant
it is only necessary to rejoin that nearly
all these are produced in the United States,
and are, therefore, not subject to import
duties. Tea and coflee are produced in
foreign countries, but they are on the free
list. They were formerly taxed, but when
the import duty which we imposed on
them was taken oflj Ihe countries, from
which we get them levied an exjHirt duty
to the same amount, or nearly so. Con
sumers gained nothing. Our Government
dmply gave $10,000,000 of its revenue to
Brazil, Java, Costa Rica, China and other
countries."
TllK Citrus Fair to be held at Oroville,
Buttc county— beginning on the 20th— the
very heart of Northern California proper,
should l>e kept in view in making engage
ments. During that fair a great many of
our people should attend it, and do all that
can be done to make the fact of its l>eing
held and the character of the exhibits
widely known. It is at Once an advertise"
meat for the north, :t protest against mis
representation and a proof of the semi
tropio character of this region.
OoxraßSsntAH Brace, a Democrat,
thinks the President's tariff i>olicy would
be disastrous to wool interests. If that is
so, becaßse Mr. Biggs comes from a wool
growing section, how can he defend the
policy against the objections of other inter
ests ns vitally affected as is wool growing?
Let the forecast be ventured \v>\\- — the
Democracy will not renominate Mr. Cleve
land, became Democracy a not so cour
ageons aa Mr. Cleveland, and will endeavor
to before the country in l^^s with the
tariff loft out of its platform.

BLAISE'S "CORKER."
Conclusion of Blame's Criticism of Cleve-
land'x Message.
Following is the portion of the interview
with James G. Blame received after the
Rkcord-I'mos's report closed yesterday:
" How will the President's message be
taken in the South ? "
" I don't care to answer that question.
The truth has been so long obscured by cer
tain loyal questions of unreasoning
prejudice nobody can hope for industrial
enlightenment among their leaders yet; but
in my view the South, above all sections of
the Union, needs a protective tariff. The
two Virginias, North Carolina. Kentucky, i
Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia '
have enormous resources and fair facilities i
tor developing and handling manufactures. I
They cannot do anything without protec- !
tion, even the progress, vast as some of
these States have made, will be checked if
the President's message is enacted into law.
Their Senatorsand Representatives can pre
vent it, but they are "so uaed to following
anything Democratic that it is very probable
they will follow the President and blight
the progress already made. By the time
some of the Southern States get free iron,
ore and coal, while tobacco is taxed, they
iuay have occasion to sit down and calcu
late the value of Democrat free trade to
their interests.'
ADMISSION OK RAW MATERIAL.
" Will not the President's recommenda
tion to admit raw material lind strong sup
port?"'
"Not by wise protectionists, in our time.
Perhaps some greedy manufacturers may
think with free coal or free iron ore they
can do great things, but if they should suc
ceed in trying they will, as the boys say.
catch it on the rebound. If home trade in
raw material is destroyed or seriously in
jured, the railroads will be the first to feel
it. If tiiat vast interest is crippled in any
direction, the financial fabric of the whole
country will feel it quickly and seriously.
If any man can give a reason why we
should arrange the farilf to favor the raw
material of other countries in competition
against our material of the same kind, 1
should like to bear it. Should that recom
mendation of the President h i approved, it
would turn 1.00u.000 laborers out of em
ployment before it had been a year in op
eration."
EFFECT OF THE MESS.UiE.
"What must be the marked and general
effect of the President's message?"
"It will bring the country where it ought
to be brought — to a full and i'uir contest on
the question of protection. The President
himself makes it the one issue by present
ing no other in his message. 1 think it
well to have the question settled. The
Democratic party in power is a standing
menace to the industrial prosperity of the
country. That menace should be removed
or the policy it foreshadows should be
made certain. Nothing is so mischievous
to business as uncertainty, nothing to para
lyzing as doubt."
WaDls Information.
The following letter has been received i>v
a citizen in Auburn, from A. L. liateiuan
of Indiana :
"In the hard winter of 1852-3 when
Hour got up to $1 per pound in Downie
ville and along the Yuba, I was mining a
short distance below Goodyear'a l*ar. Fluur
at $1 per pound and other articles in pro
portion seemed to threaten a slight embar
rassment in ray financial circumstances be
fore the opening of the spring, and I
shouldered my blankets and started across
the mountains through snow about six feet
deep for Foster's Bar. From Fosters I
went to riacerville (known everywhere as
Haugtown then), and passed through Au
burn, spending two or three days there.
Well, I never saw Auburn again till two
months ago returning home from a trip to
Southern California, where I had been
looking over the country for eighteen
months. I again passed through Auburn
and I want to say to you that in the foot
hiils .jf the Sierra ( I spent ten years ainmi"
them in the early days), is the finest the
most delightful country,' in California. 1
found land about Loa Angeles selling all
the way from .S2OO to $1,500 ncr acre. I
thought it a little 100 hitrh. The cliniate
is good, but it is hardly worth $1,500 per
acre.
" Now, what I want to know is some
thing about your section. What is good
fruit land worth with yon, improved and
unimproved? What do you raise prin
cipally ? Are your vineyards troubled with
diseases'.' How about water supply .' < a n
you folks do as much lying about your
country as they- do in the southern part of
the State? If you can and do, then don't
write to me, for God'a sake; but ii you can
tell me something reliable about your sec
tion, I want to hear from you, and want to
hear from you bad. Send'me your county
paper. I don't care anything about its
religion or its politics ; I simply want to
hear something about the country, and am
led to believe irom eignteen months' ex
perience in the coast counties that a Cali
fornia newspaper is reliable and won't lie
except for a consideration. Excuse me if I
am asking a good deal of you, but I am
presuming a little on being an old Cali
fornian and want to get back to the mount
ains."
Trouble at, the Ouarrle*.
The Auburn Reptiblican says : " The
stone-cutters who have been working for
G. Griffith struck on Thanksgiving Day
and left his employment They had an
nounced that on January Ist tbtv would
demand $\ a day, but the cause of their
"juittiriK earlier was the fact that Mr. (irif
iith had employed more apprentices at tht<
Hocklin quarry thau the cutters thought
ought to have work. Six cutters went out
at Fenryn and nine at Rocklin. Tlitseman
were receiving $3 50 a day for ten hours'
work. There has been a Union •,' Penryn
and Bocklin stone-cutters, and it is this or
ganization which ordered the strike. Their
rule is, like that of ihe National Union,
that an employer shall have only one ap
prentice to ten journeymen. S,i:u<. time
ago Mr .Griffith obtained the contract for
famishing .nr;;nite for the new Stockton
Oourt-house. The contract calls for about
10.000 feet of stone, and was taken at the
very low price of $100,000. .Mr. Griffith
needed men for this work, but the an
nouncement of the cotters that they
W uld demand $4 a day had the effect of
kseping other workmen out of the county,
so that those already at work c juld more
easily enforce their demands. Mr. Griffith
found himself in a dilemma. He saw that
he must accede to their demands and pay
$4 to all union men, whether they were
worth it or not, or else take the bull by the
horns and till his contracts by hiring non
union men. He chose the latter course,
and hired i number of apprentices with
ihe result already stated. Xo great trouble
is expected, as ih?re are already several men
at work, some of them apprentices, who
have nearly served their time and will soon
be journeymen, and others from the East.
The regular qaarrrmen are all at work as
usual. The report that Mr. Griffith ejected
any of the strikers from his houses is false.
The Stockton contra "t will probably last
two years, and at times it will require fifty
or sixty cutters. Any nood mechanic will
be given w>rk. when thereis room for him,
and, if he is worth $4 a day, the chances
are that he will get it.''
What Am I to Do?
The symptoms of Biliousness arc unhap
pily but too well known. They ditTer in
different individuals to some ext«nt. A
Bilious man is seldom a breakfast-eater.
Too frequently, alas, he has an excellent
appetite for liquids, but none for solids of
a morning. Ilia tongue will hardly bear
inspection at any time; if it is not' white
and furred, it is rough at all events.
The digestive system is wholly out of
order, and Diarrhea or Constipation may
bo a symptom, or the two may alternate.
There are often Hemorrhoids or even lon
of blood. There may b» giddiness and
often headache and acidity or flatulence
and tenderness in the pit of the stomach.

Profitable Cultivation of Horehound and
Bergamot in Butte County.
Oroville, December 7. 1887.
Eds. Record-Union : I notice a telegram
in your Issue of the tith inst., from Redding,
mentioning an establishment there of an
apiary by W. If. Hoge. This gentleman is
establishing an apiary fifteen miles from
here and has twenty acres of horehound
under cultivation. Last spring he brought
200 swarms of bees through here, and I
understand from his Superintendent that
these increased during th° summer to 275
swarms.
This horehound plant is the most won
derful honey producer I ever saw and the
bets cluster in great numbers upon it. I
understand that Mr. Hoge t who is from
Brooklyn, New York), calculates to average
next year 250 pounds of this horehouud
houey to the swaim, and that lie has had
overtures made him by a large New York
druggist for his entire production for the
next twenty-five years at fifty cents per
pound, but his crop has yielded him up to
this time fully one dollar per pound. He
declined the oiler This same man is
successfully growing bergamot. and mak

BESEBAL NOTICES.
Advlc.i to Mother* Mrs. Wlnslow*i
SOOTHING SYRUP should always be used when
children are cutting teeth. It relieves the little
sufferer at once; it produces natural, quiet sleep
by relieving the child from pain, and the little
cherub awakes as " bright as a button." It is
very pleasant to taste. It soothes the child,
softens the gums, allays all pain, relieves wind,
regulates the bowels, and is the best known
remedy for diarrhoea, whether arising from teeth-
Ing or other causes. Twenty-five cents a bottie.
mr!s-IyMWF
Only One.
There i.s but one SOZODONT. It has no coun
terpart. No other preparation for the teeth
either compares with, or resembles it. Kecora
meudatiouii of anything in its place should be
discredited. Demand SOZODONT. lon't lie
put off with substitutes. ly-TuThS
