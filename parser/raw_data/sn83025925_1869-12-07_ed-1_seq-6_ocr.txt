The Great Clerical Hrnndal.
II 1 had the opportunity of being born once
again and my opinion were asked, I should wish
to open my eyes upon some just such world as
this, where Byrons died once a century for the
purpose of having their reputations raked by
Harriet Beccher Stowcs, and where gontlemanly
journalists were being shot down by McFar
lands to furnish the occasion for bcing'apothco
eized by Ilcnry Ward Beechcrs. I should like
to feel certain of waking up in the morning and
nd waiting for me damp papers full of vir
tuous and Indignant editorials; I should enjoy
the prospect of hearing on Sunday clerical ex
cuses for libertines upon one hand, and a very
general clerical denunciation of the
excusers on the other. I should not
like to dwell in some supernal com
munity whose "sense" it was not easy to shock.
I fear that whatever the beatitudes of that
higher state of being, I should yearn after the
"natural cussedncss" of New York, and long to
thrill with the sensutiou of perceiving how
political newspapers can throw the small con
sideration of politics to the winds when they
come to face a great moral wrong ! Tho air is so
full of gossip concerning tho Kichardson-MeFar-land
case that I feel as though but little ought
to be expected of mc. Enough to say that Mr.
Beecher continues to aBsert his innocence, but
Lolds himself open to a proof of his guilt. On
Sunday he artfully excited his congregation to
the highest pitch by reading to them
s chapter in the New Testament in
which express mention was made of the rela
tions between man and wife, and of the only
crime which might justifiably destroy those
relations. Mr. Frothingham, however, with less
art, but more candor and courago, explained,
not excused himself, glossed over the great
objectionable feature in the affair, namely, the
fact that adultery only is sanctioned by tho New
Testamont as a sufficient cause for divorce, and
irlth the glib glamour of a pet parson who un
derstands the people to whom he Is talkln"
probably set himself right with the majority of
Lis flock. . As for tho clertcy in general who took
part against Beocherand Frothingham, the Kev.
Mr. Puller represented them most strongly, and
sald! he thought a libertluo was more than a
murderer or that Richardson was worse than
McFarland ana left It to bo inferred that his
opinion of his delinquent brethren was not ex
cessively high.

to the eongregaiiou of Plymouth Church are
among the new converts, and have gone over
to the Brooklyn Mormon Church, whose doc
trines are soracwhatdifferent from Mr. Beechcr's.
Several thousand soldiers are now encamped

The "putrefied" hero of Onondaga has arrived.
He is at Wood's Museum, and gave his first
tcanve yesterday. Why was he uot bought up
by the art-loving gcntlenieu who are going to
erect the new Museum of Art In Central Park ?
We need some such curiosities as this there.
However, it has just slipped In in time to revive
the waning fortunes of tho museum, which not
efen Mr. Barnum's mouey-inaklng tact has
hitherto made successful. Its menagerie of
lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, leopards,
panthers, and so forth its ornithological hall
stuck as full of ostriches and reptiles
ns the Poultry Show nt the Empire
Skating Rink Is of cocks and hens, are com
plete as far as they go, with thou
sands of other curiosities; yet some
how or other the new Wood's does nt draw
like the old Barnum's. Apropos of Mr. Barnum,
1 wonder who wrote his new "Life." I suppose
he would say that Ac did, and I hardly suppose
the gentleman who is accredited with having
written the first one would care about "owning
tip." Whoever wrote it has proved himself an
apt story-teller; but there ought to bo an inter
linear translation, converting tho imaginative
flights into unvarnished truth. I am glad to sec
that in his concluding pages Mr. Barnum has
expressed himself so piously. His religion Is
the only thing about him that is not humbug,
for it is so like tho genuine article in appear
ance that he cannot tell the difference himself.
According to bis own confession, lie has gone to
church one-seventh of his time nnd cheated the
public six-sevenths, leaving a very good balance
in his favor. Am Baba.

Mies Bateman last evening attracted a very
good audience to the Walnut, in spite of the ex
tremely unpleasant state of the weather, and
she achieved a measurable success in spite of a
very indifferent play. Miss Bateman has Im
proved within the last lie years, and while she
retains all the peculiarities of her style she has
her powers better under control, and is able to
manage her effects with more skill. The drama
of Man Warner was written by Tom Taylor
for the purpose of (iiting this aciress with a part
suited to her and of furnishing her with a variety
number of situations that would enable her to
represent certain emotions. The subject chocn
is not a pleasant one, and it undoubtedly appeals
to a very low order of taste. A robbery is com
mitted under circumstances that point very
plainly either to ''George Warner," a workman
in a machine shop, or his wife, as the perpetra
tor. Each believes the other guilty, but the wife
steps forward and confesses that she committed
the crime, and thus rescues her husband. She
serves out a term of imprisonment, her suffer
ings being aggravated by the desertion of her
husband, whom she imagines to bo the real cul
prit, and tho dramatist piles horror upon horror
by contriving Hint she should, after her dis
charge from the prison, bo accused a second
time of theft, and by her own husband, who
has now become a wealthy manufacturer. The
two nre brought face to face in the police court,
but the wife, although her inuocenco of the last
crime is established, refuses to meet the man
whom she believes has so cruelly wronged her,
and makes her escape from hirn. She is thou
turned out of her lodgings by a hard-hearted
landlady, who has a regard for the character of
hcr.housc, and docs not wish to harbor a person
accused of theft, and just as "Mary's" misery
appears to be complete, tho real perpetrator of
the robbery for which she had been condemned
confesses, and a meeting between the husband
and wife and mutual explanations ensue, which
are satisfactory to all parties concerned. It will
bo seen that this subject, despite its coarseness,
possesses considerable dramatic interest, and it
might be easily worked into a powerful play.
Tom Taylor, however, has not by any means
done it justice, and Mary Warner
is one of tho very poorest pioces from his pen
that has ever been produced in this city. Any
success that Miss Bateman achieves In it is duo
entirely to her own abilities and uot at all to her
author. Such characters ns "Mary Warner" ap
peal strongly to tho sympathies of a certain
class of playgoers, and several actresses now
before the public make a specialty of represent
ing unfortunate women In various situations of
distress, moanlug for their children, and weeping
over tho loss of husbands and lovers. In this
line of business Miss Bateman is probably supe
rior to any of her rivals. She does not equal
Lucille Western in gcnuluo tragic intensity, but
she has a refinement that Mus Western entirely
lacks, and her acting is natural withous affecta
tion and forcible without rant. In tho scene in
tho second act, where "Mary Warner" and her
husband have an interview at the prison gratings,
Miss Bateman played with line feeling. In the last
act, however, when she discovers her little
daughter, 6ho does not make the most of tho
situation, and she falls very far short of Lucille
Western in the somewhat similar scene in East
Lynue. Miss Bateman is a good actress in a
certain class of characters, but she is not a great
one by any means. It is to her credit that she
can make such a botched piece of work as Mary
Warner interesting; but it would be more credit
able if she could do as much for plays better
worthy of notice.
Mr. (icorgc Jordan gave a good performance
of "George Warner," and Miss Virginia Francis
acted the part of "Milly Riggs" passably well.
Mr. Walcot made the. most of tho very un
promising part of "Bob Levitt," and Mr. Bailey
was a good representative of ' Funks," tho
warm-hearted warden of tho prison. Mary
Warner Is well put upon tho stage, and the
scenery is for tho most part very good.
"The Overland Itoute" at llie Arch.
Last evening, despite tho disagreeable wea
ther, a large audience assembled at tho Arch
Street Theatre to witness the first icrformauco'
In this country of a play by Tom Taylor, entl-
uea -me uveriana Jiouie, which is appropriately
described on the bills as a scenic comedy. Under
thetltloof Tha. Overland Mail it was brought
out at the naymarket Theatro, In London, in
the month of February, 1800, and enjoyed a long
uiu BuccuiBiui run.
The first act dlselnuna Hip
Pacific and Overland steamer Simoon, a scene
i,An,i.n,..ui- ... .. . . .
in; hwuviihi uu tjiiecviveiy inouniuu.
Among the pnpr.ngcrs arc "Mrs. Sebright" (Mrs.
John Drew), a thoughtless woman who Is rather
fond of attentions, and, In order to soenre them,
permits herself to be thought a widow, assuring
herself that "Jack," her husband, will think It Is
all right. "Sir Solomon Fra.er, K. C. B.'' (Mr).,
lleniplc), a hotnc-retnrulng diplomat, Is constant
in his display of devotion, ns is also "Mr. Colc-j-epper"
(Mr. Mackay), late of tho East India
civil service, whose homeward journey Is em
bittered somewhat by tho loss during tho Sepoy
revolt of certain vouchers, the absence of which
places him In an equivocal position towards tho
Government. Then there is "Mrs. Lovlbond"
(Mrs. Maeder), who has heard from her "Augus
tus"' bnt onco in ten years, and then only to be
assured that he was about to do away with him
self to escape her jealous tyranny. "Major
MacTurk" (Mr. Rnlton), a blustering braggart,
has been assiduous to his attentions to the
latter; and "Captain flavoring" (Mr. Stoddart),
a genteel but tricky gambler In
disguise, is the unwelcome suitor of "Miss Colo
pepper" (Miss AnnTc Firman), the daughter of
the unfortunate cx-attachc of the Civil Service.
While these personages are passing off and on
the stage, "Tom Dexter" (Mr. Cathcart) appears.
A roving genius is he, skilled In physic and all
the arts of genteel life; but roughly used by the
world, and at last, after perils and adventures
unnumbered, on his way to England as a steerage
passenger. Some wonderful cures effected by
him bring him into the notice of "Captain
Smart" (Mr. James), the first officer of the
Simoon, who, on hearing his story, appoints
him surgeon of the ship, and allots him cabin
quarters. He is at once developed into one of
those rare characters who perform prodigies aj
if by instinct, so seldom encountered except
upon the stage. Ho knows all about the
"Sobrlghts," the "Colepcppcrs," "Sir Solomon"
and "Captain Clavering," and at once becomes
the central figure of the play. "Mrs. Sebright"
is soon brought by him to her senses,
"Captain Clavering" is forced into civility
by a disreputable reminisecuco of the card-table,
and "Miss Colepcpper" is awakened to love by
a recounting of the heroic part which ho took
in rescuing her and her father from the murder
ous Scpoy6. Aud then, just as "Major MacTurk"
has proposed to "Mrs. Lovibond." up turns
"Lovlbond" (.Mr. Craig) in the very next state
room to her, a thin, emaciated, misanthropic
wretch, who, attired in a cotton night-cap and a
white Ilanucl gown, and preseuting tho very
picture of the consummation of misery, emerges
from his den in search of the steward, and is
taken into custody by a detective as a notorious
fugitive from justice, whose name he has tem
porarily assumed for the sake of securing his
deserted cabin quarters.
The scene in the second act is transferred to
the quarter deck of the Simoou, which is almost
ns effective in its appointments as the saloon
cabin. The intrigues and counter intrigues of
"Sir Solomon" and "Mr. Colepcpper" for the
favor of "Mrs. Sebright" are here renewed, tax
ing "Tom DexterV skill to the utmost in his en
deavor to watch over the wife of his frieud
"Jack;" while "Lovibond," brought upon deck
for an airing by his custodian, reveals himself
to his "Cloriuda," as a last desperate resort to
prove that he is not the villain "Downey,"
whose name and baggage he has assumed. With
the poor consolation of knowing that ho will
have an opportunity of establishing an alihi
when arraigned in Bow street, he attempts a
cheerful countenance, and joins with tho other
passengers in a turn on the light fantastic; but
when the mazy whirl is at its height, tho good
ship Simoon strikes upon a coral reef in the
Red Sen, a scene of wild dismay ensues, the
mastcareens, the bulwarks are stove in, and
the curtain descends upon a sensational eff ect
which almost throws Boucicault's house on fire
into the background, and elicits tumults of ap
plause from gallery and pit.
The closing act reveals the encampment of
the passengers upon the coral reef, the accom
paniments of this scene being fairly in keeping
with the requirements of nature. "Captain
Smart" is laid up with a splintered arm, and
"Tom Dexter" falls naturally into his shoes,
directing all the movements of tho crew and
passengers with that wonderful skill which he
alone possesses. A spirit of cheerfulness reigns
in every heart save that of "Major MacTurk,"
the stoppage of wkose daily bitters makes a
perfect wreck of that chivalrous soldier, his
humiliation being complete when he is brought
to his knees by "Lovibond,'' by whom he Is de
tected in tho act of stealing a bottle of boor; and
that of "Sir Solomon." whose teeth have been
"swallowed up in tho jaws of the deep." But the
action of this last act is altogether too brisk
to be sketched in our limited space at length,
and it must suffice to say that "Dexter" dives
down into the wreck and rescues from twenty
fathoms of water a mysterious black box, which
contains the missing vouchers of "Mr. Cole
pepper," whereby that worthy gentleman is set
upon his legs once more, and interposes no
obetaole to the happiness of his daughter and
the prodigious "Tom;" that villain "Downey"
turns up in propria persona among the steerage
passengers In the hospital tent, and "Augustus"
throws himself into "Clarinda's" arms, without
a epoL upon his reputation or cloud upon his
brow; while the melancholy "Sir Solomon"
recovers his teethjustln time to announce the ap
pearance of a ship In the ofliifg. So long-suffering
virtue is fully rewarded, and what little
vice there was on board tho Simoon is brought
to grief.
The Overland Route is a genuine comedy, des
pite the successful atteuipu at scenic display
which accompany it. Tho plot is not very intri
cate, it is almost lost sight of in tho whirl of in
cidents by which it is obscured; but the dialogue
is brisk and rattling, and many of tho hlt3 are
brimfull olj humor and productivo of excessive
laughter. Each of tho parts was well sustained
ast evening, but the most characteristic person
ations wero those of Messrs. Craig aud llemple.
The make-up of tho former both on ship board
and on the coral reef was admirable, and his
acting fully in keeping with his make-up. When
the loss of "Sir Solomon's" teeth puts a tempo
rary quietus upon that garrulous diplomat, Mr.
Hcmple wabbles about the stage mumbling In
the most natural and mirth-provoking way.
With an excellent dialogue, clever acting, and
the effective scene which closes the second act,
the Oct rland oute is certainly an eutortaiuing
play, far above tho general run of latter-day
sensations.
