Figures on a Tour Will Make

Springfield, 111., Dec. 6. A little over
- $8,000,000 is the amount superintend
ents and managing officers of the 17
charitable institutions of Illinois esti
mate the state legislature in its winter
session ought to appropriate for the
maintenance of the institutions for the .
coming two years.
These figures were given out by Fis
ral Supervisor Frank D. Whipp of the
J state board of administration, who has
. Just, returned from a tour of the 17
institutions for the purpose of getting
' the estimate, which is returned in com
pliance with the new charity act, in
force Jan. 1, 1910. Of the amount
named, it is roughly estimated by the
superintendents that $6H0,000 will be
required for general and ordinary ex-1
penses, $1,250,000 for new buildings,
$600,000 for repairs and the balance
i for miscellaneous purposes.
Will Make Detailed Report.
! Fiscal Supervisor Whipp. after re-
ceiving the estimates from the manag
ing officers of the institutions, will
make a detailed report to the board of
administration of his findings, which
report will be ready within a week or
10 days.
TAFT'S MESSAGE FALLS
ON INDIFFERENT EARS
(Con tinned from Page One.)
president says:
"The progress of the work is most
satisfactory. It will be completed well
withia the time set, Jan. 1, 1915. and
witni.i the estimated cost of $375,000,
000. The slides in Ctilebra cut offer
no great reason for delay."
Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the United States powerless to
enfort e the universal and equal use of
the waterway acainst a desperate and
irresponsible enemy, and would defeat1
the object of the canal in increasing i
the military effectiveness of the
American navy.
The tolls should not exceed $1 per
ton. The president should be author
'zed to adjust the rates as necessity !
arises. The government should in-!
rlude in its management of the canal
the furnishing not only to the navy
You recall holiday times when you and I have gone
out for a good time and expended from $10 to $200.
There have been Christmas mornings in Rock Island
when hundreds of children awoke to an empty stocking .
the bitter pain of disappointment that Santa Claus
had forgotten them. Perhaps it wasn't our fault. We
had provided for our own; we had also reflected in a
passing way on those less fortunate than our own, but
they seemed far off and we didn't know where to find
them. Perhaps in the hundred and one things we had to
do some of us didn't think of that heart sorrow of the
child over the empty stocking.
Now, old top, here's a chance. , The Argus showed
you and me and our friends the way a year ago. Just
send your name and address to The Argus Santa Claus
fund. State, about how many children you are willing to
protect against grief over thafc empty stocking and you
will be furnished with the names, addresses, sex and
age of that many children. It is then up to you, you do
the rest. Select your own present, spend 5 0 cents or
$50, and send or take your gifts to those children on
Christmas eve. You pay not a cent more than you want
to pay every cent goes just where you want it to go.
You gain neither notoriety nor advertising; you deal
with no organization; no record will be kept. The whole
plan is just as anonymous as old Santa Claus himself.
Neither you nor I get anything out of this, except
the feeling that you have saved some child from sorrow
on Christmas morning. If that is not enough for you
then you have wasted time in reading this it is not in
tended for you, but for the good fellows of Rock Island.
Perhaps a 25 cent doll or a 10 cent tin toy wouldn't
mean much to the children yoti know, but to the child
who would find them in the otherwise empty stocking
they mean much the difference between utter disap
pointment and the joy that Santa Claus did not forget
them. Here is where you and I get in. The charitable
organizations attend to the bread and meat ; the clothes ;
the necessaries; you and the rest of the good fellows
furnish the toys, the nuts, the candies; the child's real
Christmas.
Or if you don't want to go to the trouble of buying the
presents yourself just send in a subscription to The Ar
gus Santa Claus fund, and thus do your part in helping
make happy those little ones whose names will not fall
into the hands of the good fellows. The Argus has two
plans: One is by supplying you the names of as many
children as you ask for, and the other is in receiving sub
scriptions with which gifts are bought. It's up to you.
A GOOD FELLOW.
Danville, 111., Dec. 6. When H.
H. Whitlock, retiring county treas
urer, turned his office over to his
successor, O. B. Wysong, yesterday,
it became publicly known 'that the
retiring treasurer had found himself
$37,552 short. At his bondsmen's
suggestion Whitlock turned over to
Attorney J. W. Keesler as trustee
all of his real estate, appraised at
$32,000 and all of his life insurance,
amounting to $11,000.
On the real estate there are in
cumbrances amounting to $7,000,
leaving his equity in the real estate
$25,000. After having done this,
the bondsmen made good the defici
ency in the county treasurer's cash.
Whitlock stated his financial con
dition was due to bad investments,

Washington, Dec. 6. There will be
no omnibus building bill at this ses
sion of congress, according to present
plans: but some individual bills to
meet w'nat may be regarded as press-
j ing local necessity may be reported
out by the house committee on public
buildings. Chairman Bartholdt of that
committee is against any omnibus bill,
which attitude is in line with the pol-
icy of keeping the appropriations down

Active preparation for the Rock
Islaud high school senior class play
was begun last night when a com
mittee consisting of Catherine Heim
beck, Dorothy Arndt, Inez Cramp
ton, Will Woodin and Edward Ret
icker. met with Mr. Burton and ob
tained his consent to the annual en
tertainment. Mr. Burton's dissolu
tion of the dramatic club last week
was responsible for the instigation
of a rumor that there was to be no
senior class play. Mr. Burton, how
ever, stated that one of the reasons
for placing the ban on the dramatic
club was the fact that it might hin
der the class play, which he assures
his most hearty support. The com-1
mittee was not appointed until late!
this year, but it expects to have a!
play and cast ready in a short time. !
They are to be assisted by a commit-j
tec of the faculty. At the same time, i
Br. Burton denied that he had in-:
tiniated that there would bo no stu-j
dent manager of the football team ;
next year, as was stated recently. j
He said that he had not even con-j
sidered the matter. j
