That Isthmian canal, so long dreamed of.
thought of, wished for and worked for, is
at last "in sight." The Hay-PauncefOte
treaty is on the eve of ratification, and
following that in reasonable time should be,
and presumably will be. the necemary
legislation by Congress for putting in the
first spade on the great work. The rest
will be mere business detail. The method
of prosecuting the work, and the length of
time necessary for its completion, will call
for sound judgment and gAod management,
but there need be no great uneasiness on
that score. Government contracts are not
always promptly executed, and government
estimates of cost are not always accurate.
But as this undertaking is exceptional in
every way, let us hope it may prove so In
this way as in other ways.
The piercing of the isthmus has been so
lor~g contemplated that familiarity with the
topic has in a measure dulled the popular
appreciation of its tremendous importance.
It will prove to be the greatest achieve
inent in the cause of progress of modern
times. It will complete and crown that
chain of feats which 'has made of this
world a neighborhood of men. Cutting
across lots has been the order of the day
for a full century; and the annihilation of
thousands of miles of sea voyage on the
passage from the occident to the orient
with the occident the seat of commercial
power. and the orient just waking up to
the advantages of new systems and en
joyments-is something the whole world
Could afford to celebrate by a series of
formal fetes. When the canal is opened
and the first ship enters for passage
through, maybe the President of the United
States will by arrangement press a button,
and set off the steam whistles and the bells
"from Greenland's icy mountains to India's
coral strand." That will be a noise which.
if less notable and far less musical than
When the morning stars sang together, will
yet be a truly big time in the history of
this world of ours.
Congratulations are in order, and should
be dispensed with a liberal hand. Only the
continental railroads of this country, and
their tools in and out of Congress, are de
nled a share of the universal gratitude.
Democrats and republicans alike in the
United States have wrought to the great
end. Englishmen and Americans, after
years of wrangling and playing at cross
purposes, have put aside all differences and
difficulties. Presidents of the United
States, without distinction of party, have
favored the enterprise. And last, but not
least, the names signed to the treaty are
those of as capable and patriotic men as
have ever served their respective govern
ments in high office. John Hay and Lord
Pauncefote deserve well of their country
nen, and are assured of permanent fame.
No American or Englishman of this gen
eration has set his hand and official seal
to a diplomatic document of so much gen
eral and lasting interest.
Next Yesr's EneamPment.
The decision of the Grand Army of the
Itepublic to hold Its next annual encamp
zrent in this city follows the line of nat
Ural selection. Washington is becoming
ncre definitely each year the logical city
for the assemblage of great national organi
Nations, especially those of a patriotic char
acter. It offers a maximum of historical
interest and its associations are all such
as to endear it especially to the veterans of
the civil war. Next year's encampment will
occur Just ten years from that extraordl
pary assemblage which brought the Grand
Army to Washington for the first time in
its history. Probably never before or since
has there been such a gathering of old
soldiers. Elaborate -and costly provision
had been made not only to entertain all
who would naturally attend the encamp
ment, but to secure the attendance and
comfort of veterans who without aid would
be unable to visit the capital. The pur
p's., which was executed with exceptional
suiccess. was to bring to this city the full
est possible attendance of the old soldiers,
who had not thus formally visited the led
eral city since the grand review in 1865.
The capital city has always felt proud
nif that encampment, as doubtless has the
Grand Army itself. It was a red-letter oc
'casion in the history of both the city and
the organization. The District cannot hope
ti repeat next year what was done ten
years ago, The elaborate entertainment of
Y~a!l involved a local cost which cannot
lie easily computed, in view of the direct
violation by Congress of the organic act
in providing the entertainment fund ap
.propriation. That disastrous form of ap
propriation will never be duplicated with
the consent of the people of Washington,
The Grand Army will find here a conven
tIn city of unique interest in itself; and
the veterans will be greeted with that
hearty hospitality which the capital ex
tndis to all assemblages of American citi
zens as honored guests within Its gates.

Bishop Ketuald ad the Frae.
A t a recent missionary conference i'eld
in Rochester, New York, a bishop of the
Episcopal Church referred in severe terms
to the conduet of the Spanish friars in the
Philippines, This has aremed stiahop Me
Qjuald of the Jboman Catholie diocese of
Rochester. who, In a reply, uses the 1o1
lowing language:
''I have certain knowledge that the con
d1 uct of the friars in the Philippim. Iu=1z91s
can be fairly compared with the cnduct
01 the ministers in the bisho's own church
or in any other church in ths ountry. It
is false to assert that education was not
given to the grest aib'of these pepe.
They had a morality Tht I am afraid te
will never know eaein einee the introduc
tion of American civilisation."
Bishop McQuaid owes it to himself to at
once give the muble the beasent of tis
"ertain knowledge' which puts the friars
in the Philippines on a par for character
with the ministers and priests Ia the
United. States. It is wholly at variamc
with testimony from a thousand other
sources, and all within the pale of his own
church. Has Bishop McQuald never seen

N rm "i that the see.n..e trirs
sha not resume their charges; and the
question for both the church &ad the state
in the Philippines is to secure peace On
this score by the institutionet a =w -order
of things.
It will thus be seen that the accusers of
the friars are those who at .one time sat
under their spiritual minttrationa. Pre
sumably they must have the best of rea
son" tr their ompatae for people, as
rule. are slow to move where the good
name of their religious communion is In
volved. But. acceeiag to the sworn state
ments of these men, conditions were such
at the time of the anmas=a downfall in the
Philippines that the lives of many of the
friars were an abominatien in the sight of
their parishioners. The comgainants there
fore embraced the irst opportunity to
make known their grlevances, for the pur
pose of having the foul nests cleaned out.
They remain Itoman Catholics, but they
ask for spiritual guides who live up to the
requirements of their sacrok calling.
If they are looking to America for an
example of what they desire in the way
of successful church government their eyes
are fixed in the right direction. Churches
of all denominations thrive In this free
country, and the Roman Catholic Church
shows greater prosperity under the stars
and stripes than under any other fiag that
floats. American-bred priests would speed
ily solve the Phflippine problem as It Is
complicated by the Spanish friars, both in
the energy of their labors and in the cor
rectness of their lives.

Books for the Publio Library.
The District appropriation bill for the
current fiscal year should have carried with
It an appropriation for the purchase of
books for the Public Library In such num
bers as to ensure the opening of the new
building with a respectable show!ng on the
shelves. It was clearly pointed out that
such an anticipatory provision would pre
vent an embarrassing situation later. But
Congress last winter Ignored the plea. The
library building will be finished some time
In May. The regular District appropriation
bill. in all probability, will not be passed
much if any before the first of June. It may
not be passed even until after the close of
the fiscal year. as has heretofore happened
on occasions. In any event, the money for
the new books imperatively needed for the
library cannot be had In hand for at least
live months through this measure. This
means that it will be impossible, unless
some other way is found to meet the case.
to open the new building with a decent
showing of books on the shelves. It Is
strongly urged by the librarian of Corgress,
out of his own wide experience, that every
effort be exhausted to brevent the opening
of the building-which in this 3ase is al
most tantamount to the inauguration of
the library Itself-with bare shelves. Such
a spectacle would be humiliating to the
pecple of the District, a reflection upon
Congress as the District's legislature and a
check upon the development and the, popu
larity of the library.
In order to provide the volumes necessary
for the proper opening of the building the
trustees have asked for an appropriation
of $40,000. and the Commissioners have ap
proved that estimate and forwarded It to
Congress. It is assured that several
months of hard work will be necessary to
expend this money properly and to cat
alogue the books. A mass of uncatalogued
books will be of no value to the readers.
So the money should be appropriated im
mediately, unless Congress is willing to
permit the opening of the new building
with a discreditable showing of empty
shelves. This can be done by means of the
urgent deficiency bill, which Is usually the
frst of all the supply bills to be passed. It
Is likely that this measure will become law
shortly after the Christmas holidays, and
the book fund for the new library building
would thus become available In season,
with hard work by a competent force of
cataloguers. for the opening In May. The
Public Library committee of the Board of
Trade has recommended this course as the
only way now available for avoiding a
humiliating spectacle next spring on the
occasion of the opening. The course is
urged, indeed, by every consideration of
pride in the capital and this new institu
tion, which has already, even with its
scanty stock of books and Its Inadequate
equipment, demonstrated its great useful
ness to the people of the District.
New York Sprucing Up.
Things are moving in New York along
the line of moral betterment, even in ad
vance of the assumption of office by the
fusionists. The other day a police captain
was convicted of neglect of duty and he
was subsequently dismissed from the force
in consequence of this action. He was one
of the most effective of- the Tammany cap
tains In working the great graft. Deputy
Commissioner Devery is on trial for some
of his tyrannical actions toward the men
who refused to bend the knee to the ma
chine. Captains of the force are actually
raiding pool rooms and other joints without
being forced to do so by the anti-vice so
ciety. The latest raid resulted In the cap
ture of the "policy king," whose connec
tion with Tamnmany has been close In the
past. Enough evidence was collected, it
was afterward reported, to send a large
gang of the gamblers to prison, and per
haps to afford clues to the principals in the
great game, which it is known embraces
some of the leading exponents of the Tam
many system of government. At this rate
Mayor Low and District Attorney Jerome
will enter office with the reform movement
already under working headway. It would
be a striking commentary on the mutability
of life in large cities for these purifiers to
find their paths eased for the regeneration
of New York largely in consequence of the
eleventh-hour repentance or forced virtue
of the heelers and their official allies.
Illinois has developed some strongly con

The statehood fight down In Indian terri
tory and Oklahoma is growing interesting.
The Oklahoma people want the two terri
tories merged into a single state, pointing
out that they would make one compact and
populous commonwealth. The other folks,
however, do not desire to lose their iden
tity, fearing that Oklahoma would get the
name and the credit of the statehood. They
feel rather jealous of the newer territory
anyhow, it having been carved from the
borders of the old organization. The propo
sition to unite the two into one state is
likely to command strength In Congress,
despite the threat of the Indian territory
people to fight any statehood movement on
this basis. It is to be questioned whether
there will be any pronounced public sup
port of the two-state project.
