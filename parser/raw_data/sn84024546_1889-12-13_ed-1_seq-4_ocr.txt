PITTSBURG. FRIDAY. DEC. 13. 1SS9.
ME. ID0'8 METHODS.
The scandal with which this session of
Congress has opened we refer to the Silcott
defalcation is not growing any less as the
days go by. The committee appointed to
examine the accounts of the Sergeant-at-Arms
and the methods which permitted the
expensive Mr. Silcott to maintain a course
of systematic embezzlement for a long time
has made a singularly interesting report.
3usiness men particularly will be surprised
end amused by the revelation this report
makes of the free and easy style of handling
the people's money in the Sergeant-at-Arms'
office. Congressmen have now learned for
the first time how lucky they have been to
have had any salaries to draw during the
past year or two.
Mr. Leedom can hardly blame the Con
gressional investigators for reflecting se
Terely on his conduct in office. 01 course,
beside the flagrant crime of Silcott who
got away with exactly 570,795 the peculiar
practices of his superior officer will not ex
cite so much unfavorable criticism as they
might have done otherwise. Still, Mr. ee
doni's profitable habit of advancing salaries
to Congressmen out of the Government's
money at 10 per cent discount, will not en
hance the reputation of theretiring Sergeant-at-Arms.
Nor does it redound to his credit
that be never counted the cash intrusted to
his care once during his incumbency until
Silcott's departure for Canada had become
public. Beside the well-merited condemna
tion of Mr. Leedom's peculiar methods a
Tery mild phrase, indeed we trust that Con
gress will see to it that Mr. Leedom's suc
cessors in office will be compelled to attend
to their duties, these duties not to include,
lending Uncle Sam's money to Congressmen
at 10 per cent
THE CHOICE F0S THE FAIR.
Everybody has been stirred up to a more
active and immediate interest in the World's
Fair project by the confident assertions of
practical men that there is no more time to
lose if the fair is to come off at all in 1892.
3fotwithstand2ng the intense rivalry among
the competing cities the eager desire of
each to possess the attraction there is the
feeling common to all of a national pride,
which demands that wherever the fair be
held it shall be a success. There is a quick
perception now that Congress must not
dilly-dally upon the choice of location;
but that, on the contrary, whatever is to be
done should be done quickly.
What effect the demand for early action
will have can only be conjectured; but as
the bulk of conjecture so. far runs, it favors
the idea that Washington will profit from
the newly awakened feeling. New York
is hardly in shape to make its most effective
showing at present Preparing for the fair
is slow work with New York. Chicago is
farther on; but if New York cannot win for
itself it is presumed that it will favor Wash
ington as the second choice.
The influence of the Congressional Com
mittee also, we judge, will ultimately be in
favor of the National Capital Should the
latter city be selected, Pittsburg can claim
credit for the approval of the judgment of
its Chamber of Commerce, which was one of
the first public bodies in the country to take
the broad -view that the fair, if national,
should beheld at the capital of the nation.
A POIKTEB FOB SPOILSMEN.
Republicans and Democrats of a certain
very well-known class are combining at
Washington to make an assault upon the
civil service law of 1883. They are not
maintaining any show of secrecy even in
their preparations for this noble and high
minded undertaking. Senator Ingalls has
pronounced his emphatic approval of the
campaign against the policy which the
Pendleton law embodies and which the last
National Republican platform indorsed,
and his remarks are only verbally varied by
the friend of the spoilsman on the other
side of the fence, Senator Vance. It is a
happy and singular unanimity. But we
sincerely hope that these statesmen will
have a common grief in the defeat of their
plans next year.
Jn regard to this subject our esteemed
cotemporary the New York Timet points
out one of the consequences of the success
of this anti-civil service reform raid, which
we think has not been generally considered.
This consequence would be "that if any ad
ministration should undertake, after an ap
propriation had been refused for the com
mission, to make a 'clean sweep,' it would
depopulate the departments until such time
as Congress should provide money for the
work of the commission again, because un
der the law no appointments can be made
in the classified service except in accord
ance with the rules as they have been, or
shall have been, duly promulgated. It is
"not surprising that this fact is unknown to
the opponents of the system. All that
they think it necessary to know about the
system is that it interferes with the distri
bution of the spoils. That is enough to
make them rush at it blindly. But they
will hardly find a majority in either branch
of Congress, to say nothing of one in each
branch, so stupidly ignorant as to follow
them."
OHIO'S F0BQEBY SCAHDAL.
It will do no harm, and it may do consid
erable good, if the committee which the
House ofBepresentatives agreed yesterday,
at the instance of Congressman Butterworth,
to appoint, makes a thorough investigation
of the ballot box forgery matter. The
3JISPATCH has already printed a great
many of the circumstances under which the
forged contract passed from R. G. Wood
to Governor Foraker, but that there still
remains more to be told we have little
doubt Between the Congressional com
mittee and the courts, which have also laid
hold of Mr. Wood, the truth and all the
truth is likely enough to be squeezed out
Aside from the necessity of punishing the
forger and compounder of the fraudulent
contract, it is extremely desirable that the
exalted person or persons behind the scenes,
. who are alleged to have' pulled the strings
tin this shameful business with a Tiew to
' benefiting their own political fortunes andj
7 '
vf 'V'
-
destroying those of others, should be dragged
into the fall light of publicity. This is pre
suming the insinuations against the indi
viduals in question have some foundation.
If these insinuations are merely malicious
lies, or the turning of a hunted animal to
delude the dogs of justice, the victims will
enjoy deserved justification. Anyhow, the
matter needs probing sharply.
-HOT BET- ATJKT.
Pittsburg is not exactly contiguous to the
dark and barbarous lands from which Stan
ley and Emin Bey have just now emertred,
and yet the latter explorer is bound to our
classic suburb, the West End, by a tie of
kinship that is strangely close. A reporter
of The Dispatch yesterday discovered in
the person of Mrs. J. P. Eolson, an aunt of
the redoubtable Emin Bey. Mrs. Eolson
lives in the West End, and sho tells the
story of her relationship to the great ex
plorer with such' circumstantiality that we
cannot see why its entire truth should be
questioned.
The whole narrative is interesting, but
especially so is that part of it which relates
to Mrs. Kolson's recollections of her
nephew's precocious childhood. We are
not surprised to learn that even in his ear
liest days Joseph Schnitzler for such was
the slightly unromantio name of Emin Bey
before he set about to climb the dizzy heights
of fame was addicted to exploring the
territory within his reach. It is not re
corded how many pots of preserves suffered
from his exploring fingers, but probably
they were not few. We have noticed that
there is a natural tendency in most boys
toward such explorations, and with the
germ of that love for adventure in his
bosom which has carried Emin Bey into
untold dancers we can readily imagine how
the- preserve cupboards must have paid
tribute to him in his youth.
By the way, the explorer must have had a
foreboding of his coming fame when he ex
changed his plain title of Dr. Joseph
Schnitzler for the mora pretentious one of
Emin Bey. And yet he must feel a yearn
ing to see the old folks in Cologne again. If
he will visit his relative here all Pittsburg
will assist Mrs. Kolson to make him wel
come. PITY THE CITY LOAF-!
The city loafer is a much-persecuted
person, and will probably arise and make
known his grievances if he can overcome
the aversion to action which characterizes
him, He is always being ordered to move
on; he is not allowed to congregate at street
corners or in front of public buildings, and
is generally treated, with contumely. Now
Allegheny Councils strikes a blow at him
by prohibiting, under Bevere penalties, any
loafing in front of the Carnegie Library,
How different the treatment accorded to
the city loafer's country cousin. When the
sun goes down behind the snow-clad hills
the village storekeeper thoughtfully sets
empty barrels on end for him to rest upon,
carefully strews upon the floor pieces of
cracker boxes convenient for whittling pur
poses, and sees to it that the stove is red
hot Poet, painter and novelist work
together to cast the halo of romance around
the happy, idle group, and illustrate, with
brush, pen and pencil the simple gossip
about "Silas! red heifer," "the new school"
and other matters of rural interest
Why does not some philanthropist estab
lish loafing places in cities? It might make
the loafer happier, and it would certainly
be an unmitigated blessing to lady pedes
trians, who have to wade through tobacco
juice past groups ot idle and usually inso
lent men at the street corners.
ifRKP THE PARE INTACT!
A very healthy sign of the times is the
close watch which city officials and publio
meu are keeping upon Pittsburgh new
park, There is no chance of any under,
hand schemes to the detriment of this great
treasure being carried on successfully while
such a staunch watch dog as Mr. R. B.
Cunahan is on guard. There is also an
evident disposition upon the part of City
Engineer W. H. Brown, Mr. Moreland and
other officials of the city government to pro
tect the park at all hazards and against all
comers, be they individuals or corporations.
The statement made by Mr. Carnahan to
the effect that Mr, Torrens has no power or
right to grant any privileges to the Squirrel
Hill Electric Railroad Company, settles the
question. The railroad must withdraw; and,
unless the permission of the people of Pitts
burg, through their representatives in Coun
cils, is obtained, which is very improbable,
the withdrawal must be permanent How
Pittsburg has a park she is going to keep it,
and every hit of it for her own use, pleasure
and benefit.

Ax last our esteemed cotemporary, the
Philadelphia -Record, has come ont for protec
tion. The Record distinctly says: "Count
Herbert Bismarck brought homo with him
from the Orient, it is stated, a new proverb,
which runs: There are three things with
which no man should play: The .fire, because
it can burn him; the viper, because it can sting
him; a woman, because she can love him.'
There should be a prohibitory tariff on Im
ported proverbs like this."
In examining our reasons for thankful

cherishes his memory. He is one of the few

When a tinker stops a policeman on the
street and wants to solder up his eyes, it should
be regarded as a delicate compliment. In some

so tight there is no need for solder.
The silver men object to Secretary Win
dom's silver scheme. This will surprise no one,
and least of all a Secretary of the Treasury.
It would be a great surprise indeed If any

tbe silver in it, but the earth itself.

In New York it is a Tery queer day now
that does not show at least one man killed by
contact with electric light wires. The Coroners

regulations than enforcing them.

I0UKG MEN TO THE PE0NT.
The Average Abo of New Congressmen Less
Than 40 Year.
Washington Letter In .New York Herald.
The average age of the new members of the
Honse is not more than 40 years. This fact fur
nishes strong proof that the present is an era of
young men. It was not always so. A quarter
of a century ago an impression existed that to
be a legislator one must have reached a mature
age; that to properly discharge the duties of
the position one should be at least 60, and it
were, better if he were 60 years of age. Since
then the average has been falling, until at the
present time the House contains a score of
men whose ages are less than 40 and possibly
thrice that many who do nqt exceed that age.
The majority of the young men come from
the West showing that tho youth of the coun
try 15 and 20 years ago were quick to follow
Horace Greeley's advice and find homes for
themselves far removed from the effete civil,
izatlon of the overcrowded East.

THET0P1CAL TALKER.
A Winter Km-Speculating; Abent St.
Margaret's Hospital Staff An Erratic
Yet Stead? Locomotive.
SoMETniNQ of a sensation attends all the
public appearances of Miss Una Durfee, whose
beauty and liveliness lends not a little gilding
to "A Gold Mine."
It is really funny to see what attention she
attracts upon ths streets. On Wednesday,
afternoon I happened to see ber walk down
Fifth avenue from Smlthfield street to Wood
street, and it Is a fact that not a man she
passed but wheeled about to take a second look
at her. The blue coat she wore It was a bright
and light blue became ber amazingly. It is
not so much in regular features that Miss Dur
fee's beauty consists, as in her perfect blonde
complexion, slender and shapely figure and the
contour and poise of her gold-crowned head.
Captain Wishart is not looking welt His
broad-brimmed high hat overhung a very
pallid, weary-looking face when I saw him
mount the postoffice steps .the other day. Is it
the result of the arduous labors in which he
indulged last year, or does he miss the excite
ment and anxiety which those labors brought
him? Anyway the shining star of Law and
Order seems to have lost a good deal of' fits
luster.
ft is an odd fact that Captain Wishart's face
is not very generally familiar to the publio.
For a man who has made such a noise in this
town, he is singularly free from publio attention.
.
There is a good deal of curiosity among
physicians about the organization of the med
ical and surgical' staffs at the hospital which
the late Mr. Shoenberger's money is to
build. Some people think that because
the hospital is, generally speaking,
to be conducted under the auspices
of the Episcopal Church the doctors will have
to be Episcopalians. This is neither probable
nor complimentary to the founder of the hos
pital. Perhaps it might oe possible to gather
together a competent staff of doctors profess
ing to be Episcopalians though I am told by a
good authority that there are very few Episco
palians practicing medicine in this city but
such a selection would be unwise and against
all precedent.
There are only two hospitals, strictly speak
ing, under religious domination in this city, viz:
the Mercy and St Franciscus, both admirably
conducted Institutions. The Roman Catholic
Church owns and manages both these hospitals.'
Yet In neither is a doctor's religion looked into,
but simply his ability, before he takes his place
upon the staff. At present I believe it so
happens that all the, doctors, attached to the
Mercy Hospital are Protestants. And a very
happy and blessed thing it is that this enlight
ened spirit prevails. There is no reason to be-,
lievatbat the St Margaret's Hospital will be
conducted on narrow, illogical lines. The Epis
copal Church is nothing if not broad-viewed
and liberal.
Looohotiyb 17, of the Fort Wayne Railroad,
accomplished a singular feat yesterday. It
was drawing the Leetsdale accommodation,
which is due in Allegheny at 1:15 yesterday
afternoon, and bad reached the crossing just
below the signal box outside the Federal street
depot when it left the track. At this point
there is a network of switches, and the engine
by rights ought to have turned upside down
without more ado. But It didn't. For SO or 40
feet it ran, turning gradually to the right till it
was making a course directly at right angles to
its proper one. The ups and downs over the
steel rails did not disturb its equanimity in the
slightest, and it ran to the edge of the grassy
bank, finally coming to a standstill at the base
of a telegraph pole, which the cowcatcher cut
half in two. '
Meanwhile tho cars, which did not emulate
the levity of the locomotive, but -kept their
place on the rails, came to a sharp halt as the
air brakes the connecting pipe being broken
automatically seized the wheels. The passen
gers thought little of it till they saw people
running dawn the street to the tracks, and then
a few wiseacres opined that somebody, a small
boy at most, had been run oyer. They were
happily sopn undeceived, for no one was hurt
The locomotive even seemed little damaged,
A locomotive engineer who came to look at
the engine gone astray, said to me; "It's ex
traordinary that she didn't upset. 1 remember
bringing my engine off the turntable once, and,
running slowly as she was, she stood right on
ber head when she left the rails."

POLITICAL BATTLES IN BEDFORD.
Numerous Candidates Hustling tq Secure the
laportaat Qflce,
rsrcoAz, tzxxgbauto tot dispatch.j
Bedford, December la The fact that; next
fall an entire county ticket is to be elected, be-
biuo vuugressnian ana oiaie senator in the
district has set the politicians, the candidates
and their respective friends at worn unusually
early in the campaign, and consequently oneqf
tbe liveliest and hottest contested fights in tbe
history of old Bedford county can be looked
for. The contest of 1891 already .overshadows
the campaign of 1890. and that alone will have
considerable to do with framing the ticket to
be voted for next fall.. It Js a well known Jact
that Congressman Scull Is anxious to bo his
own successor, and in order that Bedford
connty shall come to his aid he has made it
known that Bedford connty is to name tbe Re
publican candidate for Judge in 1891. Whether
this will coincide with tbe views of John H.
Jordan, Esq.,wbo has had the Copgresslonalbee
buzzing in his bonnet for several years, has
not been learned; but some of his friends say
that Jordan will acquiesce in this scheme, in
the hope of getting bis friend, Hon. J. H.
Longeneckcr, out of the way two years hence,
as Longeneckcr at present is the most formida
ble candidate for the Judgeship.
The contest for the Judgeship Is already on,
and the respective candidates are going
through tbe button-holing process. The can
didates so far mentioned are Hon, J, H, Longe
necker, at present Uepnty Secretary of the
Commonwealth, and Alexander King. Esq.,
son of Judge Alexander King, deceased, ho
was at the time of his death President Judge
of the district who is supported by tbe whisky
element of the party, whose strength is not to
be overlooked, as was shown in the
June election. Whether ex-Judge Will
iam M. Hall will drift Into the
contest is not known, but if he does it will
complicate matters. Some of the Republican
leaders say if he is a candidate and cannot
gain strength enough to nominate himself he
will throw his influence to King, in order, to
defeat Longenecker.
The Senatorial contest has brought no less
than three ex-members of the Legislature into
tbe political arena once more. Dr. 0. P. Cal
houn. Captain N. O. Evans and E. 8. Ascom
are already in the fight In this county, beside
Senator Alexander, who is anxious to succeed
nimseii. xnis promises to be a lively fight;
with Calhoun as a probabje winner.
For the county offices the pig Republican
majority has brougnt candidates to the surface
by the dozen, while tbe Democrats, from pres
ent indications, will have to hunt candidates
who are willing to be sacrificed for the good of
the party,
EAGLES IflSH FOE TRODT,
They Rob the Set Lines of Clearfield Connty
Lumbermen.
Harrisburs, Pecember 12, A cp?ious stqry
comes from Clearfield county. Mosquito creek
flows through a wooded part of that county,
and the stream is as full of trout as the dense
forest is alive with various kinds of birds. The
eagles find a peaceful home there, and they are
plenty, too, Some time ago a party of (umber
men bethought themselves that it would be a
good scheme to catch the trout that inhabit
Mosquito creek. They could not spare the
time to fish with rod and line, and Franklin
Hayerstraw, the inventive genius of the camp,
suggested the idea of tying lines to bottles!
The next day the creek was full of bottles with
lines on them. They had good luck for awhile,
until tbe bottles began to disappear. To solve
tbe mystery a watch was put upon the fishing
tackle, and Haverstraw qnd Christ Moore
went on guard. A day passed, bnt the bottles
were undisturbed, and a good mess of fish was
caught. However, the two men saw several
eagles perched high in the treetops. looking
suspiciously into tbe water below. Then they
wuuiu aor arouna ana ny ciose to tne creeK,
quickly going to tbe highest limb of the tallest
tree when they saw the men.
This singular action of tbe birds set Haver
straw to thinking, and when be told bis partner
that it was bis belief that tbe bqttles were car
ried off by tbe eagles, Moore scouted the idea,
Haverstraw was firm in his convictions, and
the nextdaythe two men hid themselves among
the leaves. At 8 o'clock In the morning three
large birds came in sight They sat on a tree
for an hour. Then, feeling sure that they were
unobserved, they made a descont. and each
caught a bottle in its claws and carried it to the
bank. Each line had a fine trout on it which
tbe eagles proceeded to devour, The men were
dumfounded. For the first time in their lives
they saw an eagle eating a fish. Haverstraw
and Moore remained in their hiding place. To
their surprise the birds made another trip to
tbe river. Only one line had a fish on (t, but
the other two birds carried the bottles, and
lines to the shore. Before they could devour
the one fish Haverstraw and Moore appeared
on tbe scene and the birds flow off. The
grounds were then searched, and many of the
missing bottles and lines were found, Tq
sboot they eagles was tbe next measure
adopted, and on the fourth day two of the
birds were killed. The third flew away, and
was not seen again.

Throng at the Chsrch. Bind at the Home.
The First Presbyterian Church was filled
with a brilliant assemblage last evening to
witness (he solemn vows of wedloctc as taken
by Miss Margaret Magee and Mr. Kler
Mitchell.
The church was very prettily decorated with
tropical and other foliage plants, while the
altar was thickly massed with rare exotics.
After a short musical programme, Mr. John
Bell struck tbe introductory notes of Lohen
grin's "Bridal Chorus,'! and the wedding party,
in the following order, entered the church and
passed up the white-ribboned aisle: Ushers
Lieutenant Lansdale, Mr. Christopher Magee,
Jr., Mr. Nat Holmes, Mr. Oliver Rlcketson,
Mr. Charles Mitchell, and Mr, Joseph McLead,
of Hew York City, all attired in faultless even
ing dress, with sprays of white flowers worn on,
their coat lapels.
Two tiny little flower girls dressed in white
silk. ru nil trimmed with white satin ribbon and
carrying pink and white bouvardlas, created
much admiring comment as their dainty feet,
In perfect time to the music, pattered up the
aisle. They were Misses Mary aqd Emily
Mnrehead,
The four bridesmai ds, two in lavender soft
Silk gowns made in the Empire fashion and
carrying white roses, and two in delicate pink
gowns ot the same style and texture carrying
rqses of the same color, were Misses Alice

of tbeextremelv long train, and a diamond
necklace, tbe gilt of tbe groom, glittered on
uer deck, xisr uouqnes was composed oi my
of the valley and orchids, and she was deliv
ered into the keeping of the smiling groom,
who, with his best man, Mr. Strong, of New
York, were waiting at the altar, by her fatber,
Judge Magee. Rev.Dr. GeorgePurvesofflciate4
In a very impressive manner, and the responses
of both bride and groom were audible In the
rear portion of the church,
At the conclusion of the ceremony tbe invited
guests were conveyed to the residence of the
bride's parents, corner Neville ana Forbes
streets, where a reception was held. The
lovely home is situated on the crown of a con
siderable elevation and the approach to the
house, tbe surroundings and the house itself
are very Tuxedo-esque. In the twilight of the
evening (the ceremony was performed at 6
O'clock), tbe house and grounds had a weird
plctnresqneness that greatly intensified the
warmth, fragrance, music and gayety within.
Those who attended the bride to tbe altar
assisted in receiving, and the drawing room,
the bow wipdow of which the receiving party
occupied, was lovely with the decorations of the
glossy green smilax and the pure white lilies,
harrasi, calla and lilies of the valley. Tbe
corresponding mantels were banked with
maidenhair ferns and tho fireplaces were 'solid
with the lilies.
The smilaxformedprettyportleres attbe bow
window and gracefully draped the pictures and
easels, also formed pretty natural lines on the'
rich crimson plush hangings.
The Roman hyacinth and narcissus combined
with smilax, formed the decorations of the
library, and were arranged in a very artistic
manner.
The dining room was radiant with countless
roses from tbe deepest pink to the faintest
blush of color, the table was most exquisitely
decorated and the air was heavy with tbe per
fume of the most fragrant of aU roses, tbe La
France. Tall, waving palms and majestiq
foliage plants filled every nook and corner in
balls and rooms throughout the entire house.
Toerge Bros.' orchestra was in attendance, and
added much to the enjoyment of the evening.
Hagan served the supper, which was one ot the
most elaborate of the season, and the bridal
jjany eujuyeu uieir rturesnmencs in an exqui
Bitely decorated little room on the second floor,
with closed doors.
The wedding cake was in the form of a church
and the gilt hands of the clock in the steeple
pointed to the hour of 0, The presents were
displayed in a little pink draped room on the
second floor, and the exhibit reminded one ot
the holiday assortment of goods in a fashion
able jeweler's establishment.
The bridal prefent from the bride's mother
was a solid silver tureen and ladle.
Judge Magee's present will be a residence
in the East End, the site and strncturo not yet

A BRILLIANT BaZUE.
The V. P. Orphans' Home Benefit a
Most
Successful Event,
Old City Hall has.never witnessed a brighter,
more animated scene than was presented
within its four walls yesterday.
Buntings of various colors and the national
flag in great profusion changed tbe ordinary
aspect of tbe hall quite materially, and wbenl
the throngs oi ncbly-oressed men, women and
children began to arrive one wished for two
pairs of eyes with which to view the beauties
of tbe scene.
The occasion was that of the annual fair and
bazaar given for the benefit of tbe Orphans'
Home by the ladles of the United Presbyterian
Churches.
The center of the room was occupied by the
fancy booth in pretty drapings of pale yellow
aqd green, and there everything feminine taste
could inyent or skill manufacture was to be
found.
The dolls, and there were hosts of them, per
fect swarms were in a booth of the fiery red,
and the glassware in the cool green and pure
white drapings displayed its sparkling qualities
to the best possible advantage.
The American flag made patriotic the com
mon sense booth, where so many useful articles
were exhibited that p eoplo were forced to be
sensible and purchase. Ice cream and cake
was dispensed to the multitude under tbe
dainty colors of rose and blue. The upper port
tlon of the hall became a dining room for the
occasion, and a number of .lovely tables loaded
with all the good things of tbe season tempted
tbe hungry wanderer to an over liberal supply
of supper. Tbe event was a grea,t financial suc
cess, aud reflects much, credit upon tbe ladies
who had it in charge, a list of which was pub
lished in these columns yesterday morning.

In the height ot yesterday's gale tbe bark
Marie, consigned to Funcb, Edye & Co,, was
sighted off Sandy Book, in tow of a tng.
Funcb, Edye 4 , Co. telegraphed their boatman
and their boarding clerk to board the bark, if
possible, and get ber paper?. The wind yester.
day afternoon was blowing at the rate of 45
miles an hour, and there was a very high sea.
Nevertheless, David Dillon, the boatman, and
the boarding clerk started out from Quaran
tine in a little open boat. When they reached
tbe bark the clerk became so frightened by the
heavy sea that he violated the law and climbed
an board. Dillon made fast his. little craft to
the tug with a towline, however, and bade the
Captain go ahead. A few minutes after tbe
tng had started the rope that held Dillon's
boat to tbe tug snapped, In two minutes the
little boat was, half a mle to the rear of the tug
and tbe bark, Dillon waved his arms franti
cally, a,nd shouted to stop the tqg. In a few
minutes be was past Sandy Hook, going out to

the last over seen of him. This morning tele
grams were sent to the Hook, but nobody

vealed that last, year Germany granted only
3.K1 patents, atrainst England's 9,779 and the

Far the first time on record a lady has
beep appointed a Deputy Collector of Internal
Revenue. Miss Phoebe Couzms bas been a
Deputy Upited States Marshal aqd bas wielded

had to visit regularly the tough dives and mors
decent saloons of a wicked city and inspect
Government licenses. This is what Miss Maud
Cottom, just appointed Deputy Collector for
the Seventh Indiana district by Collector
Throop, will have to do.

r Parisians have lately been entertained
by a remarkable artist who displays wonderful
skill in her peculiar form of painting. With
plates of various colored sand before her, she
takes tbe sand in her right hand and causes It
to fall in beautiful designs upon a table. A
bunch of grapes is pictured with violet sand, a
leaf with green sand, the stalk with brown
sand, and relief and shadows by other sands;
when the work is brushed away a bouquet of
roses and other objects are represented with the
same dexterity ana delicacy.
The wife of J. D. Cheever, a salesman,

For the last w9 weeks passengers on
the San Francisco ferryboat to the Oakland
side of the bay have bad a free entertainment
prepared for them each night as the boat tied
np in the slip at the end of the mole. During
that time millions of overgrown sardines have
swarmed into tbe sIIds. where they have been
scooped up in boxes, barrels and even bats. No
attempt bas been made to catch tbem with hooks
because tbey are so numerous. The oldest fisher
man cannot remember any time when there has
been such quantities of any kind ot fish.
One of the most remarkable monuments
in America is in San Luis Obispo county.
Southern California, A great rock rises 150
feet above the plain of Carissa, and in the dis
tance looks rugged and forbidding; On near
approach it Is seen to have on its eastern side
an opening 25 feet broad, which leads into an
inner temple or court with level floor 223 feet
long and 123 feet broad at its widest part. The
ceiling is 60 to 100 feet hia;b. This great natural
cathedral is a wander to geologists, bat it is
more wonderful to archaeologists. It was evi
dently used by prehistoric men as a temple of
worship or a capitoi of government On the
walls are paintings, iq red, white and black,
doubtless having a meaning. There are figures
representing fields, suns, farts, spears, men and
animals. The colors are apparently as bright
as when laid on. Tbe wonder was discovered
by Franciscan missionaries 100 years ago, and
there has been no change in its appearance
since. When or by whom tha walls were deco
rated no one knows. The Indian tribes had no
tradition concerning the work, and regarded it
with superstitious reverence.
