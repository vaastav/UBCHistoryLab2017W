FULL LEAKED WIRE REPORT
OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
The Btate Journal to a member of the
Associated Preas and receives the full day
telegraph report of that great news or
ganization for the exclusive afternoon
publication in Topeka.
The news is received in The State Jour
nal building over wires for this sola pur-
Good for Arkansas. Despite her
handicap as being the habitat of Jeff
Davis she comes to the front with an
Increase in population during the past
decade of 20 per cent.
Reports from the weather bureau are
to the effect that the weather Is at a
standstill. But it is not of the variety
to en urage persons who have to be
rut id St to strike the same attitude.
That was a rather severe dose of
lenevolent assimilation which was ac
corded to a band of Shoshone Indians
by a gang of Nevada horsethieves. It
resulted in 14 Red Men being consigned
to one grave.
The son of the man who owns a third
of the state of Chihuahua has been

monwealth. There's nothing like keep

P Commenting on the advertisement
which says every home should have a
talking machine, the Houston Post
says: "Nothing doing with us; we

If the winner had to pay the bills,
the Chlcagoan who ate a broiled quail
and drank a quart of champagne ev
ery evening for 31 nights, could not have
had very much velvet left out of the
$700 he won by accomplishing this much
toooted feat.
It is a noticeable fact but there is
Bothing so unusual about it, that in the
petition for divorce which a Topekan
has filed on charges that his wife has
the habit of throwing things at him,
he does not allege that he was ever
struck by any of the missiles.
Night and day Is the Philadelphia
mint kept busy turning out money in
the medium of small coins. Nearly
$6,000,000 of such money was turned out
by the mint last month. But if you
want any of this coin you've got to
work for It, and work a little harder
than usual.
The condition of the winter wheat on
December 1 was reported to be below
the ten years' average. This is Inter
esting Information, of course, but it
wouul be Just as well not to think of
worrying about the wheat crop until
June 1 of next year. And the chances
are there won't be any need for worry
ing then. '
President Taft is said to be having a
difficult time to decide on appointees
to the supreme court which will be ac
ceptable to the United States senate,
the confirmatory power. But the pres
ident's difficulties In this direction
would be Increased a thousand fold if
he had to consult the wishes of one or
more of the governors of the several
states, which he doesn't.
Bank Commissioner Dolleys sugges
tion that the bankers of Kansas should
organize an anti-bank robbers' associ
ation to wage a war against the bank
burglars who have been successfully
active In the state during the past few
years Is a good one. It is to be hoped,
though, that if such an organization is
effected none of Its funds will be dis
sipated in the purchase and mainten
ance of a bunch of bloodhounds.
MrBalllnger has been entirely exon
erated by a majority of the investigat
ing committee on each and every charge
preferred against him by Glavis and
Plnchot. Two other different reports
from the other members of the com
mittee have also been made. So you
can pay your money and take your
choice. In other words, there is offi
cial endorsement of any view anybody
v-ants to take on the famous Ballinger
Pinchot controversy.
Burglars who looted a Chicago house
the other day sampled some of the food
they found in the Ice box. Then they
left a note for the mistress of the house
severely arraigning her for being such
a. poor cook. Maybe If these fellows
had found something satisfying to eat,
they would have gone on their way re
joicing without carrying the valuables
in the house with them. Thus is the
fact brought home again, that the ad
vantages of good cooking are innumer
able. Evidently the dull days In congres
sional circles are not to continue for
long. Representative Norris, of Ne
braska,, who led the successful assault
on them last year, says the fight
against the house rules is going to be
continued. It is reasonable to assume.
however, that the Republican insur
gents against these rules will not get
the support in the future from the
Democrats that they received . in the
past. ' The Democrats will be in control
of the next house and they can be de
pended upon not to help amend the
rules in a way that will deprive their
leaders of all control over the manage
ment of the house and the legislation
which comua before it.
WALL STREET.
Wall street is In the doldrums again.
The prices of stocks are weak, exceed
ingly weak. This is the condition they
have been In for some time. There
was a natural expectation that if the
president's message was of a friendly
tone towards the corporations and the
big business Interests ot the country,
business would pick up a bit in Wall
street. That's the kind of a message
President Taft sent to congress, a sen
sible message, too, on this point in its
advocacy that the present laws for tha
public regulation of corporations should
be enforced before new legislation on
this Bcore is undertaken. But an hour
after this message became public, the
bears, instead of the bulls, got busy
in Wall street and the prices of stocks
made a weaker showing instead of a
stronger one. l
What's the reason for this weakness
that has prevailed for many months
among the stocks that are bar
tered on Wall street? Business
conditions, taking the . country as
a whole, have not been as active of
late as it was reasonable to expect
that they would be. This la truer of
the eastern section of the country than
it is of the great west. Then, too, a
large portion of the stocks and bonds
handled on Wall street are of the rail
road variety, and the plaint of the rail
roads that their financial standing will
be crippled if they are not permitted
to raise their freight rates has a ten
dency no doubt, to keep down the
prices of their securities. In all pro
bability, however, there is another
potent reason, among others, for the
weakness of Wall street.
The people of the country have be
come wise to its ways, or the ways of
the many stock gamblers and manipu
lators, who have prostituted the proper
functions of this great mart for the
buying and selling of the securities of
the world. And the people, having got
ten wise to the ways of Wall street, are
keeping out of its meshes. They are
not turning their hard earned surpluses
Into the craw of Wall street with the
idea of getting rich over night. They
are not taking the fliers In stocks they
used to. They have had the almost
utter futility of their efforts to beat
the Wall street gamblers' game knocked
into their heads by the hard blows of
an expensive experience. The result is
that the questionable "financiers"' who
infest Wall street, have no money to
pay their game with but their own. A
constant stream of other people's gold
is not being dally turned into their cof
fers. Naturally the game grows weak,
a gambling house, where, even if it is
honestly conducted, the big percentage
for gain is always with the proprietor,
cannot keep its doors open for long
unless new suckers are knocking at
them nightly. That is one of the trou
bles of Wall street. And until its busi
ness is readjusted to its legitimate field
and functions, the stock market will
continue weak.
But the people, generally, especially in
the great west, are not concerned much
over the weakness of Wall street. They
don't pay much attention to it, one way
or the other. They have discovered,
also, that its ups and downs are not the
arbiters of the conditions in the busi
ness world, although that opinion was
once held strongly.
TRAINING FOR PUBLIC SERVICE.
Through its committee on educa
tion, the New Jersey State Civic fed
eration has appealed to the managers
of educational institutions In the state
to establish a course of civics for the
training of young men for the proper
handling of public questions. This is
a matter that it might not be amiss
for the educational institutions of
Kansas and other states to consider.
The letter sent out by the New Jersey
federation says:
v "The records of various municipal
governments, as disclosed in public
print in the last three years, have
been such as to call serious attention
to the inadequacy of present methods
of administering public funds and re
cording these in a straightforward
accounting to the people. Realizing
that the only remedy lies in an edu
cated and expert management and
control of municipal affairs, the New
Jersey State Civic federation suggests
the establishment of a course as shall
prepare young men for an intelligent
grasp of the powers and duties of the
administrative side of a municipality,
and fitting them to assume, as experts,
the problems of accounting in city
affairs."
TOLSTOI AND KANSAS.
Kansas is, indeed,, coming into her
own. She is being recognized by the
wise men of the east as the veritable
land flowing with milk and honey; the
land where the sprit of Christianity is
broad and tolerant; the land where
the material things of life have not
been absorbed by a few but have been
distributed among the many; the land
of progress.
And it is an uiiusual coincidence,
to say the least, that the most recent
acknowledgments on this score
come from two of the leading periodi
cals of the country, in issues that came
out simultaneously and in their re
spective comments On the death and
life of the great Russian philosopher,
Tolstoi. Surely do great minds run
in the same channels, and that these
channels wend their way to Kansas
is further testimony of their discern
ment. The instances in question came
to the front in Harper's Weekly for
last week and Life for this week, both
of which, however, reached Topeka
on the same mail.
In Harper's Weekly the regular edi
torial writer In his comment on Tol
stoi had this to say, among ' other
things:
"Social, political, and ecclesiastical
organization all seemed alike to him
obstacles to the Christian life, and to
such an ordering' of the world as was
most favorable to it.
"In Kansas they think the Christian
life can be assisted by automobiles,
and the progressives out there want
every family to have one. That Is the
form their brotherliness takes. Tol
stoi's brotherliness might have taken
that form if he had lived In Kansas,
but as a progressive In Russia, where
there is no present prospect of there
being comforts and luxuries enough
to go around, hto brotherliness took
the simpler form,, of unwillingness to
have more, or live better, than his
brethren."
' Writing along In the same vein of
thought a parallel that is certainly
remarkable in contemporaneous lit
erature the regular editorial writer
of Life'had this to say ot Tolstoi and
Kansas:
"We wonder becattse he did not be
have in politics like an Iowa Insurgent
and in religion like Edward Everett
Hale or Phillips Brooks, but alter aii,
he was not a Massachusetts man, nor
an Iowan, nor even a Kansan, but a
Russian, breathing a cold storage at
mosphere two or three centuries be
hind the times.
"Moses was a great man, but put
him down, in Kansas and they would
say he was not up to date. Tolstoi was
a great man, and his great books are
appreciable even in Kansas, but the
Kaneans would feel that his applica
tions of Christianity to conduct were
very much behind the times. We
guess they were some oi tnem, dui
his spirit was not."

five years', service, is that ' right?"
"Well, not quite." said the drummer,
shoving his hands in his pockets to
keep them warm, "but it's about the
same thing. Each stripe means one
round trip over the road from Atchison
to Lenora."

KANSAS COMMENT
, THE FARM PROBLEM.
The census figures show that the
Dack-to-the-farm movement has made
no progress. It is encouraged for the
other fellow but not for the man him
self. The farms are steadily losing pop
ulation. What is to be done? The in
vention of machinery may give a so
lution. If men can perform more work
with less help then the work can be
done and the production kept up. Fur
6r. fertilizer offers a big help. Fer
tilized land produces much more than
unfertilized. We were reading the other
day about Immense corn crops in South
Carolina. The land in the south ia no
where near as good as the land in the
west. It will not produce without fer
tilizer. It responds to fertilizer readily
ana produces in abundance. Fertilizer
could be used here. We have rather
pride ourselves that our land did not
need -fertilizing but it is a fact that the
productiveness of our land haa steadily
decreased. We raise five bushels less
corn per . acre and an equal, amount of
wheat right here in Kansas. If the land
could be fertilized It could produce
much more abundantly. Anyway these
things ought to be tried. Lawrence
Journal.
FOR BETTER ROADS.
A movement is on foot among rural
route carriers in different parts of the
state for the establishment and main
taining of better roads along their
routes.
In the fall of the year there la al
ways a gathering of more or less
trash, weeds, Russian thistles, etc.,
along the roads especially between
fences, the accumulation of the sum
mer taonths. Especially is it so In
some parts of this county.
Now in some parts of the state the
farmers are banding together, taking
a day off and raking and scraping
this trash up and burning it. We have
driven several times across the south
em part of the county and there are
miles of fence piled high with dry
Russian thistles, that at this time of
year would be the greatest feed in the
world for a prairie fire, if it ever got
started.
If we were farming in this com
munity about the first thing we would
start to do would be to clean out the
Russian thistle. ? They may be all
right, but they are a long ways from
being pretty, even when they are
green to our notion. The county is
certainly overrun with them.
The grading of the road could also
be done at this time, and even though
only a mile was graded, it would cer
tainly be a great help, and in time
would reach greater proportions and
soon cover the entire county.
Come on, now Mr. Farmer, wake
up to your own interests once, as well
as those of your neighbor. Just try
this receipt for good roads and see
how . It works. Oberlin Eye.
FROM 01 HER. PENS
JOB LOT OF SUGGESTIONS.
The American Peace society has
published a lot of suggestions from
publicists and teachers in the United
States, Canada and Great Britain in
regard to the celebration of the 100
years of peace since the war cf 1812.
Some of the suggestions will appeal
to everybody. Some will seem imprac
ticable, like the one Calling for the re
moval of all thesJouatom houses along
the border between the Unitea States
and Canada. While many persona
would be glad to see the custom
houses removed, such a removal would
raise such delicate questions in Can
ada as to the custom houses against
Great Britain along the Atlantic sea
board that it can be declared at once
that the peace anniversary will see
the customs flags flying still. One of
the best suggestions is that of a Cana
dian statesman, who would have a
day of thanksgiving celebrated- in both
the United States and Canada, and the
erection of a permanent memorial In
each country.
But even if there is no formal cele-
bratlon like the adoption of a treaty
of arbitration or the abolition or cus
torn houses, there is still an oppor
tunity for a great popular celebration
along the border. And regardless of
what the governments may do, there
will be such a popular celebration.

WOMEN IN BUSINESS.
One significant phase of present day
civilization Is shown in a striking man
ner by a change that has taken place
in one of the most famous streets of
New York. It is the increasing activi
ty of women in business.
Fifth avenue has undergone a
transformation, between Twentieth
street and Fifty-second street. It is
no longer a man's avenue. Of the
700 firms doing business there fully
300 are composed entirely of women
and sell to women. Two hundred oth
ers have both men and women mem
bers and deal in goods for women ex
clusively. One hundred more are of
men trading in women's wearing ap
parel. The largest hotel in the vi
cinity, the Waldorf-Astoria, makes a
feature of catering to women, and
every day Its sumptuous lounging
rooms are crowded with shoppers.
Whatever the difference of opinion
among the sterner sex regarding wom
en's capacity for business they are
quietly settling the question them
selves in a most practical manner.
Many of them are going into business
and they are winning success. Cleve

For when from the heights he has won

Nor catch them like fishes In nets;
And sometimes the thing our life misses

But Just in the doing, and doing v
As we would be done by, is all.
Through envy, through malioe, through

Against the world, early and late.
No Jot of our courage Is abating
Our part is to work and to wait.
And slight is the sting of his trouble,
Whose winnings are less than his
worth;
For he who is honest is noble.
Whatever his fortunes or birth.

Carson went away with his pulses

that should make for romance.
That night he wrote this note:
"Dear Lady of the Rose Leaf:
"This petal floated down to me as
I stood watching the battleships to

up and saw your face. I have no
right to ask you to admit me to your
friendship, but some day I hope to

He signed it "Maurice Carson" and
sent it off.
After that, life seemed very differ

spent much time beneath the balcony.

reached the wall that overlooked the
Hudson, and saw leaning on it, not

day came when it was possible to
speak of his desire, and of the ro

love from a somewhat insignificant

Old Sailors Startled. j
Masters of tugboats and other harbor
craft were given a severe fright this
morning at seeing a large black ob
ject, half submerged, rushing up the
narpor, causing suoh a swell that
wharf lines snapped like whipcord, and
causing all to ask each other for the
following fifteen minutes. "What was
It?"
The cause of the commotion was only
the submarine boat Narwhal, in oherg
ot Ensign A. H. Miles, which, while
maneuvering in the Chesapeake bay,
paid a visit to this port to arrange for
a dock in preparation for the visit next
Saturday of the submarine flotilla.
All agreed that it was the strangest
looking craft seen in the harbor, and
among those to receive the greatest
shock were the crew of the fireboat
Cataract, alongside of which the Nar
whal suddenly bobbed to the surface.
After the Narwhal sailed from Solo
mons and was on her way up the bay
she was sighted by Mr. R E. Daniels,
the maritime observer, at Cove Point,
which is 60 miles down the bay.
The submarine was about a mile dis
tant, and while he was looking at tha
strange craft she was seen to go down,
stern first, and did not rise again to
the surface. Not being accustomed to
the antics of submarines, the observer,
Immediately thinking that some dis
aster had befallen a vessel, notified tha
local maritime exchange of the occur
rence. With pictures of a frightful
submarine tragedy at the bottom of the
bay, the manager called up the navy
bureau at Washington. All fear for
the safety of those on the Narwhal
was then relieved by the official, who
announced that it was possible for the
submarine to remain under the water
for 12 hours.
The Narwhal is one of the largest
submarines in the navy, and went into
commission last November. She will
sail this afternoon for Solomons and
will be one of the flotilla of ten sub
marines and two tenders that will
visit this port next Saturday. Balti

Simplified Arithmetic.
Mathematicians have seen a great
light! They agreed recently that cal
culus and mensuration, the greatest
common denominator, square root and
complex fractions and a few of the
other brain-twisting tortures of the
course in arithmetic might as well be
dumped into oblivion, bo far as the
public school child is concerned.
At a meeting of the Philadelphia sec
tion of teachers of mathematics of the
middle states and Maryland, held in
Houston hall, not one protesting voice
was raised against Superintendent
Brumbaugh's new simplified course in
arithmetic. The only criticism was that
it is not simple enough, and that while
the city's educators were about it they
might aa well get rid of wall-papering
problems and. cut out the everlasting
type of example that begins drearily,
"How many yards of carpet will it
take?"
The 600 teachers who crowded the au
ditorium heaved a concerted sigh of re
lief when Dr. Brumbaugh announced
the demise of the least common multi
ple and the greatest common denomi
nator, "Too many teachers in this city and
all over the state and country." he said,
"have been riding an arithmetic hobby
and cramming it down pupils' throats
in season and out of season. Now,
arithmetic is only useful as it will ap
ply to the child's future life. What is
the use of teaching a boy who is going
Into a mill at 14 how to find the square
root or calculate in comiplex fractions?
What he needs is a working knowledge
of the elements of arithmetic and an in
sight into current Industrial activities.
"The new course aims to do this. It
has done away with dead subjects, and
simplifies the statement of problems. It
has shifted the work upward in the
grades, so that the children will not
learn like parrots, but will be old
enough to reason out their examples."

Thirty Dollars a Day.
Not long since I lunched at a New
York restaurant. It was not the most
expensive place but rather above the
average price. The menu card inter
ested me as a new schedule of rates
would hold a railroad president. As
a farmer I produced food similar to
that offered for sale, and I knew what
I was paid for it. A man likes to
see what is tacked on to the thing
which leaves his hand. Strawberries
and cream were offered at 25 cents.
I figured that a quart of our berries
would make about four dishes. Two
eggs served in various ways cost 30
cents. You paid 80 cents for a half
chicken. Now, my big family would
feel poorly used if we served less than
4 quarts of berries. We could hardly
keep good natured on four whole
chickens.
For berries and chickens alone,
therefore, at these restaurant prices,
we spend $10.40 at a single meal. If
.we charge the prices printed on this
card for the salads and vegetables and
other things which make our meal,
we should have a cost of J IS, or more
than ISO a day. Of course, my family
is a large one, and all are blessed with
good appetites. I can buy food cheap
er at other city places, but If I take
the prices paid by at least 150,000 peo
ple in New York, the "daily bread"
for our family represents $30 or more.
