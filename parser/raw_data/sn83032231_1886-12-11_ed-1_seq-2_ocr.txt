Somk one has said that snowflakes will

lTis astonishing to note the propensity

not more so than to iiutu with what rapidi

Tut: Advocati: gives to its readers to

Altciiiiisiiop ItvAN, of Pliiladelphla.has
caused much commotion among thu man
agers of the Catholic Charity Hall, which
for several years lias been a hiilllaut social
and financial success in that city, by calling
attention to the fact that the Third Plenary
Council of Baltimore in Its decree prohibits
all balls for charitable institutions. He
says that none of the proceeds of the ball
can be devoted to charitable objects.
Tin: refusal of the Western assemblies of
the Knights of Labor to pay the assessment
asked for by Giand Workman Pouderlv is
the subject of much comment amongst la
bor men. mid what It portends Is dlllleult to
coiiji dure at tills time. It may mean that
the laboring masses are awakening to the
fact that striking Is a business that don't
pay, and that they put their seal of con
deumatioH on it by refusing to pay an as
sessment, the proceeds of which go to
the support of the strikers. If this be the
we. then the Knights of Labor have half
covered tho ground which leads to sueccs.

Cot.. Vii.as lias saved his salary for this
year and the rest of Ids term by making
the cleiks earn theirs. Under a section of
tho General Statutes the members of the
Cabinet are required every winter to tell
Congress how many clerks they have In
their employ, what their names are, how
much they are paid, and whether they
work as they ought to. There Is also a
clause In the law which says tho Cabinet
members must state whether the public
service would not be Improved by dispens
ing with some of these clerks, and whether
their removal and the substitution of oth
ers Is not required for the belter despatch
of business. Col. Yilas has footed up the
absences in Ids department tht past jea,

Broadbrim's Mew Yorlc Letter.
Special to the Cahiiok Aiivocatk.
Perhaps wo may get ns much pleasure
and profit by n stroll lit) Hroadway this
sunny afternoon as from any other source.
Let us try it. The Stock Uoard has closed,
and Wall Street Is gradually being emptied
Into Hroadway. Trinity chimes three, nnd
hundreds of jonng messengers arc. darting
hither niul t lilt her. Il'lio can tell the iui
port with which those messages are freight
ed? To some they carry ruin; to soinchopc;
to some fortune. Stand on tho corner here
a moment; , Do you tee that plain, nervous
inan who looks like a country farmer? that
Is S. V. Il'lillc, the broker, who was re.
cently elected to Congress in the swallow
tailed district In Brooklyn, and who, not
withstanding his millions barely escaped
defeat by a few hundred majority: right af
ter him comes l'.usfcl Sage, who two years
ago got stuck for a million on puts and
calls; he paid up eventually, but It is said
that Ills back has troubled him from that
day to this, so that ho takes fewer chances
and more certain gilns. There goes Itufus
Hatch, Uncle llufus, as the boys call him;
a walking enrjclopavlla of human wisdom,
and an epitome of everything worth know
ing in all Street. That little coupe dash
ing along there contains Jay Gould and his
:m George. They do say that the new
daujliter-ln-Iaw lias captured the old man
as much ns the son; lucky .girl, luckv Jay.
Ah, here Is a pair of howling swells; what
a distinguished air they have they are. the
best dressed men on the street. Their dla
nionds and style denote them men of
wealth and position. Do I know them; of
course, I do. One of them Is a faro dealer
from Chicago, and tho other keeps a gam
bling house on 2.1th Street. That clerical
looking young gentleman Imme.lhtely be
hind them is a pick-pocket; you would not
think it, no; well.t'hat is exact'y the reason
that he succeeds so well hi ills business.
Yoi; obseive that demure young widow who
walks Immediately behind him; watch
them, they neither look at, nor speak to
each other; to all appearances they are
strangers. She, in the polite slang of
thievery, is bis Moll. She follows him to
take whatever he can pick up in the way
of business. If lie can secure a watch or
poekctbook, quick as a (lash it Is passed to
tins woman, wno at onco disappears with
the prize. If the thief is secured, no evi
dence of ids crime Is found upon lilni, and
as a general thing lie secures his discharge
for want of .corioboratlve evidence. Ah,
hero we are at Union Square that's the
Jlorton House on the cornet'. This block
between Hroadway and Fourth Avenue Is
the Paradise ofactois. Hero they crowd
tho sidewalk, exchanging notes and swap
pine jokes, occasionally stepping Into the
barroom on tho comer to renew assurances
with some young swell, who is desirous of
making acquaintance with the profession
That very plain looking woman just coming
out of the Union Square Theatre is the
great tragic actress, Modjeska. 'As she
stands talking to that tall young man In the
Kngllsh ulster, she looks like anything but
a tragic queen. Nat Goodwin thecomedian
of the Ilijou Is leaning against the lamp
post; and Pioland Heed the great expositor
of Humbug is soberly talking to a lady who
looks like a Sunday School teacher, but she
la not, she i not, she Is one of Daly's prin
clpal actresses, an immense, favorite; she
took the place of Kdllh Klngdon, who mar
ried young George Gould, and rumor says
she may make no bad match herself.
lint come let us go on. What building
is this on the comer of loth Street. Lei
u siep in ami see. jieiore us lie caos
filled with costly ornaments diamonds.
pearls, rubies, amethysts, and all sorts of
precious stones and jewels. Gold anil silver
ate everywhere, the wealth of the world
seems to bn spread out in these marvellous
and wonderful cases. There Is a diamond
pendent its value Is $,"0,000; a pair of
solitaiieearrlngs worth $10.000.and myriads
of other costly jewels. This U Tiffany's.
Let us step into the little office In the rear.
Mr. Tiffany himself U there, and perhaps
you may see something yeu never saw lc-
foie. At my request he takes carefully
from his safe a little case, ho opens It, and
there before your wondering gaze Is one of
the largest diamonds In the world. It is
fiom South Africa, of a palo yellow; almost
a topaz in color, hut a genuine, diamond
nevertheless. How much is It worth? Oh,
only $100,000; If it were pure white, a mil
lion would not buy It. lint jump In the
elevator and let us go lo the room above.
Allaiouud you arc magnificent and costly
bronzes, tho finest collection on tho con
tinent. In the little room to tho right Is
Thaxter's beautiful statue of Lmo's first
Dream, and beside It tho likeness of the
young sculptor who passed away in life's
early morning.
Hut we cannot linger here all day, conic
let us go. All, here wc are at Lyneh's.
Look at that window. Do you know the
story It tells? peihaps not. few do; but In
that little window Is the saddest of all sad
hlsloiies. It is filled with ruined hopes,
blighted ambitious, and blasted lives. Oh!
yes, there are diamonds there, plenty of
them, stones of the purest water and fabul
Ions value. That little case of unset stones
liefoie joii would purchase a Prince's ran
sntn. The store Is not pretentious I admit;
hut, Inside tucked away In safes and strong
boxes. Is wealth enough to start a dozen
Hroadway jewellers. Here come the rich
gamblers when luck turns against them, to
raise a fresh stake by the s ilo of their costly
diamonds, and here too tho soiled doves of
tho tteml mviulc come, when misfortune
overtakes them, to part wlih the trinkets
that have cost them body and soul. 1'uln,
bankruptcy and death aro in that window,
mixed up with those beautiful jewels.
Come let us turn down 2-lrd Street. Splen
did Is the pioeesidoii that passes us, and
Hundreds of them sweep Into that costly
drygnods store, the windows of which aie
filled w ith rich silks and laces. .Marvellous
ly beautiful aro these tilings, but let us not
look at them, they are not intended for
such as you and L Across the street is tlie
2:lrd Street Tabernacle, altered by poor old
halinl Jlorse for the production of his
Passion Play. The last Uine I crossed its
threshold, Mr. Morso was busy In the pro
duction of lids play, which had been the
dream of tils life. Ho was an Oriental
scholar, nnd a clot student of tho Hlble.
He was a christianized Jew, a'pcrson who
seldom has the conlidence of those whose
faith he has accepted, and w ho Is universally
abhorred by those whose religion he has
deserted.
When Ibe subject of Mr. Morse's play
was mentioned, New York rosoas one man
against It. Tho pulpit and tho press lashed
it w ttli unrelenting fury. A storm of abuse
and vituperation howled aiotnd tho un
lucky author, which almost drove him to
madness, and did eventually drive him to
ruin. The play was a failure and poor
Morse, loaded with debt and blighted In
bopo, assayed to come the mentor of an
ambitious young actress, out of whom he

This is as It should be Tho Prince of tills

ants of an effete aristocracy, but the in en
who have bought their titles to nobility by
the works of their own Imperial genius
therefore welcome Mavar jlunkacsy,
I cannot speak for those whose sole guides
are the severe cations of. art, but to the
million tho picture is disappointing. 1 do
not t 111 n k It Is within the scope ef human
genius, lo paint a picture that will satisfy
everyone; each .man has his ideal, and each
wants the plcttuo painted, as ha conceives
It. In tills great cartoon thcra aro about
forty figures most of them ltfe size, 'flic
principal characters, howerer, are Christ,
Pilate nnd Cephas, the accuser of Jesus.
Hack among the mob is a ragged vagabond
who kees shouting Crucify lilm, crucify
him, crucify him; the spear of the ltoman
cuard is all that prevents him from rushing
on the Saviour.
Only ono face beams in pity on the suf
ferer, and It is that of a young woman who
holds ill her arms a child. Sweet and
soothing is the sight of that pitiful face in
tho midst of that cruel throng. The figure
of Jesii3 Is disappointing; all of the critics
have had a fling at it; but It Is worth while
before pronouncing judgment to ask our
selves if tlie painter Is not poslthely right,
and his critics wrong. What warrant have
wo for belloving that Christ was dignified
or handsome. Ilia public life was ono con
tinuous scene of persecution and suffering.
He slept whercier chance furnished him a
shelter, and ho ate tho bread of charily,
and we all know what that means. Tlie
night before his trial he had been wander
ing, up to the hour of ids betrayal bydudas.
In tlie sorrowful Garden of Gelbseniene.
When dragged Into Court before Pilate,
what wonder that he bore the Incontestable
evidences of ids suffering. No halo of
glory encircled ids head; no white winged
dove hovered over him; bo was human. Al
ready In the stern eye of the consul, ho read
his cruel s-ntcuce, and In Imagination ho
felt the cruel nails and saw the cruel cross;
and there lie stands before Pilate not a
transfigured Christ not a defiai.t God
but a man of sorrow witli his death sentence
ringing in his cars. Now in Slunkaesy's
pletuic there is neither grandeur nor dignity
in the figure of the Saviour, it Is all human,
ami a wrecked. nnd surTciiug humanity at
that. Tlie effect of the figure of Cephas is
destioyi'd by tho figure placed behind it,
and which almost appears suspended on
tho wall. StHI the press lias been lavish in
Its praise, and one of the finest art critics
In New York, Herman Scliaus, assured 1110
It was a wonderful picture. The receipts
of Its exhibition 111 Europe reached nearly
a million of dollars.
We aro still busy with our boodlo alder
men, and I must confess It is rather uphill
work. The prosecution have to get twelve
men, thodefenee has only to get one. Heavy
odds, and boodle will tell.
Stocks are lively. Heal estate booming.
General business fair; and these tilings
Willi a fair piotnlse of Moody and Sankey,
for our benighted neighbors In Brookljn,
give us hopes for the fntttre as well as
realization for the piesent. Hkoaiiuiiim.
