THE ELECTION OF JUDBES.
With all due regard for the foresight
aLd wisdom of the majority of the
Virginia Convention, the determina
tion to let the Legislature elect the
judges, seems to us the gravest depar
ture from Republican principles yet
announced by that body.
No argument has been advanced in
favor of such an election that does not
apply with equal force to every other
officer in the State. One advocate of
the Legislature's electing the judiciary
said that he did not want to see a
judge compelled to pass sentence on a
man who by his vote might probably
throw that very judge out of office.
The pictue drawn was a sad one. He
■ eemed to see the judge quailing before
his electorate.
The idea never has seemed to dawn
on the convention that such an election
is a reflection upon the men to be se
lected as judges. Are they weaker than
other people? Will a judge quail be
fore his electorate any sooner than
any other officer? Why must such
safeguards be placed about this pecu
liar officer? They say they do not
want a judge to be shaking hands with
the people and going about election
eering. If a judge cannot do this no
man can—a sheriff nor a justice of the
peace. Certainly a governor cannot,
and so cannot many other high func
tionaries. It is argued that the Leg
islature Is not fit to elect a TJ. B. Sena
tor, and yet in the same breath we are
told that this is the very body to elect
all of our judges.
It has long been doubted whether the
Legislature ought to possess any elec
tive franchise, whether this right
should not be placed in the people en
tirely. We do know one thing—and
this is meant for no reflection on any
Legislator—that the average Legisla
tor is no more fit to choose a judge
than the average voter, and to entrust
him with such function seems to re
flect not on the people, but on the per
son to be etosen. The cry haß been
that the people should not be given
this power because of their likelihood
of being deceived by the demagogue,
but the real trouble when sifted down
by the advocates of Legislative elec
tion, is that they are afraid of the
judges wheu brought face to face with
their creators, and hence must gve the
poor creatures a chance.
The thing is a mistake, a grave mis
take, a mistake that ought not to be
made in this day and generation. It
has been cured by nearly every State in
the Union. But Virginia, like her
English ancestry, is holding on to ob
solete theories, and getting obsolete
results.
The figures presented show that the i
government need only build the Isth
mian canal to get rich. It will posi
tively be the best paying institution
the government ever invested in. If
we only had two or three more of those
canals that we could build, our entire
burden of taxation would be lifted.
The reason Mr. J. P. Morgan does not
build this canal himself is,that he will
undertake to float the bonds and not
the ships, his sense of propriety not
permitting him to appear in too many
capacities in the same transaction.
The President recommends that
Congress undertake the subject of ir
rigation in the arid districts of the
West. This can be done by leveling
the Sieras so that the clouds can get
over and rain fall in those quarters
Other plans will be suggested, but this
will be the most permanent. It will
cost a trifle of course, but what is that
to a nation of seventy-five millions
of people. *
I So greedy and wolf-like is protection
that no sooner did the U. S. Supreme
Court decide that articles could be im
ported free of duty from our new colo
nies, than a bill was immediately pre
sented in Congress to prevent it. To
bacco and sugar trusts need protection,
even against our own little islands,
and they will get it, beoauie they are
so young and so fragile.
. - ——
Why need Congress, filled with pro
tectionists, waste its time talking
about trade expansion, when the
policy of this government is to drive
trade away. High tariff is made for
the express purpose of keeping trade
out, and does retard If not destroy it-
Then how foolish to talk about ex
panding trade.
You know it must be done, but you
hate somehow to have a tooth pulled.
The same sensation is said to be felt
by the politician who submits himself
to Dr. Roosevelt.

The bill known as the "Judiciary|
Bill" in the State convention, came
up for discus-uou last Saturday, and
I the question of whether Staunton
[■should have a City, or as we know it,
la Hustings court, was the subject of
| rather a heated discussion between
1 Judge Quarles, who bitterly opposed
j such court, and several members who
advocated it, among others Mr. A. C.
Braxton. Judging even from the sten
ographic report, which we learn in no
sense portrays tbe real picture, Judge
Quarles must have lost his" temper,
and usually to lose one's temper is to
lose one's case. On the vote which
was afterwards taken on Monday,
I Judge Quarles received no support as
Ito his views, save and except his own
The fact that about $50,000 have
been subscribed to ransom a young
American woman of tbe name of
Stone, from some alleged Brigands in
some unknown country of the East,
is sufficient refutation of the adage
that "a rolling stone gathers no
moss."

Reciprocity, like charity, is to begin
at home. We are to have this bless
ing between our United States and
our Philippine Islands. When the
world sees the vastness of its beauty,
like children for Castoria, the world
will cry for it.
The "Crumpacker Bill" for reducing
the representation in Congress from
the Southern States, is again up. If
the bill does not diea naturaldeathits
name ought to kill it.
There seems to be a growing belief
that Mr. Roosevelt is likely to render
himself as popular with his party, as
Mr. Cleveland did with his.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
(From our Kegular Correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. o.—Almost simul
taneously with the opening of Congress
the Supreme Court rendered its deci
sion in the "Fourteen Diamond Rings"
case, declaring that the Philippine Is
lands are an integral part of the Uui"
ted States and that the provisions of
the Dingley tariff law do not, therefore,
apply to shipments between the islands
j and the United States. This, of course,
I leaves the trade absolutely free aud
threw the protectionists into parox
ysms.
With this incentive in view the dila
tory methods which usually attend the
first weeks of a new Congress have been
abandoned. Speaker Henderson has
already named the members of the
Ways and Means Committee and it has
held a session with a view to reporting
a bill providing for tariff regulations
between the United States and the
Philippines. It is believed that the
bill will simply apply the provisions uf
the Dingley tariff without changing
any of its rates.
Congress has received the report of
the Isthmian Canal Commission and
the Senate is in receipt of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty. The latter has
been referred to the Committee ou
Foreign Relations and that committee
has voted unanimously to report the
convention for the favorable action of
the Senate. It will be promptly rati
fied. Senator Morgan has re intro
duced his bill providing for the con
struction of the Nicaraguan canal in
accordance with the recommendation
of the Commission, which favors that
route, but to the person who reads care
fully between the lines there is reason
to suspect that there.is, in the prompt
ness with which all this Is being done,
something in the nature of a ruse aud
that it is the hope of the promoters of
the canal to bring the owners of the
Parama route to reasonable terms,
T hey now hold out for approximately
$70,000,000 more than the Commission
believes their plant to be worth.
The President's advice on the tariff
question quite accords with the views
I! high protectionists of his party
vhen those congressmen who have
cated tarff revision have ventilat
eir opinions to an extent which
believe will satisfy their coristi
s, and perhaps gain for them
concessions in the way of pa
,ge or local appropriations, they
will graciously consent to have their
•buried in committee and will soon
>t that they ever contemplated the
sy of tariff revision—at least until
have to ask their friends at home
to re-elect them.
I The only cloud on the republican sky I
the recommendation of Mr. Roose
It in regard to reciprocity with Cuba,
lie President has said that from moral
reasons and national interest we are
bound to grant material concessions to
Cuba, Tbe Sugar Trust has promised
to add the gentle weight of its persua
give influence to the movement, always
provided that there is no reductiou on
refined sugar, which, of course, means
that the Cuban raw sugar can be
bought cheaper by the trust but the
consumer will have to pay just as much
for the refined article, and Senator
Lodge has been chosen to lead the fight
in the Senate.
There istme recommendation in the
President's message which should re
ceive the cordial support of congress
men irrespective of party, and that is
his appeal for support of the Postmas
ter General in his eff/)rts to relieve the
abuses which have crept into the ad
ministration of the laws in regard to
second class mail matter. Mr. Roose
velt says that although second class
matter constitutes nearly sixty per
cent, of the mails, out of a total reve
nue of $111 the Post office De
partment i\ o-ived only $4,299,445 for
transnrtsion of that class of mail. He
goes on to say if the pound rate "were
limited to the legitimate newspapers
aud periodicals actually contemplated
by the law no just exception could be
taken "
j pound rate was not originally contern-
I plated by the f raraers of the law and
! which cost the government for trans
portation and handling $15,657.49
against which the publishers paid
postage amounting to $2,286 88 leaving j
a net loss to the Department of $13,320
per weekly issue.
An amusing incident occurred the
'other day. While standiug in the ante
room of the 'President's reception room
1 saw a congressman go up to the Pres.
identas he and Senator Lodge Mine
out and say'want (o say a word for
I Mr. Blank, who holds a small office in
liny district—" "What!" the President
! interrupted. "Is that infernal scoun
drel still thereT" Yes, I knew him
when I was on the Civil Commission.
Yes, I'll remember him," and be left

Mr. Robert Erviue, who, for ten or
twelve years has driven the four-horse
team run by V. 15. Bishop between
Monterey and Staunton, had what be
terms a "close call" last week on Shen
audoah mountain. While coming down
the mounta.in with a heavy load, and
when rounding the horseshoe turn, one!
of the horses in Mr. Ervine's team fell
on the ice and broke off the tongue of
the wagon. Mr. Ervine's longcxperi-l
ence as a wagoner, and his presence of |
miud, enabled him to do the right thing
promptly and thus avert a serious dis- j
aster. With the aid of his well trained
saddle horse, he succeeded in heading!
the fore wheels toward the bank,
where he anchored until a new tongue !
could be improvised.
One day last week 750 pounds of
venisou bams came across the line
from West Virginia and were shipped ]
of the county this season. Neither
party has butchered yet, bu those who
have seen the two hogs estimate their |
weight at figures varying from 500 to
550, with the odds iv doubt. With two
exceptions, these are the largest hogs
raised iv the county for many years.
Sheriff J. Ed. Arbogist started last
week with William Minor for the re

Are Made Miserable by
or
Kidney Trouble.
Kidney trouble preys upon the mind, dis
courages and lessens ambition; beauty, vigor
and cheerfulness soon
disappear when the kid
neys are out of order
or diseased.
Kidney trouble has
become so prevalent
that it is not uncommon
for a child to be born
afflicted with weak kid
neys. If the child urin
ates too often, if the
urine scaias me nesh or if, when the child
reaches an age when it should be able to
control the passage, it is yet afflicted with
bed-wetting, depend upon it. the cause of
the difficulty is kidney trouble, and the first
step should be towards the treatment of
these important organs. This unpleasant
trouble is due to a diseased condition of the
kidneys and bladder and not to a habit as
most people suppose.
Women as well as men are made mis
erable with kidney and bladder trouble,
and both need the same great remedy.

Constitutional Convention,
The Constitutional Convention de
voted much time to a discussion of a
resolution offered by Mr. Quarles pro
viding that section 8 of tbe judiciary
report, providing 24 court circuits, be
recommitted. |
The feature was a discussion between
Messrs. Quarles and Braxton over the
questiou of retaining a city court in
Staunton. Mr. Quarles said he did uot
think Staunton needed a corporation
court; that no business man of Staun
ton wanted it, and the court was kept
up to give the judge an office. He de
clared that the committee had forced
a court ou Staunton that the people did
not want. He then criticized the eigh
teenth circuit, composed of Rocking
ham, Augusta and Rockbridge coun
ties, and contended that no one judge
could transact the business of that cir
I Quarles insisted that what
i and other cities of her size
,nd wanted was a circuit court
uld transact all the business
Id not require the cities to pay
'ies.
axton opposed the proposition
ed by Judge Quarles. He said
lie of his city wanted the pres- j
court retained, and read, in '
of his position, a memorial
embers of the bar, the city
of Staunton and others,
lotion made by Judge Quarles
nmit this sectiou was over
igly defeated.
Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications, as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear.
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedias.
Deafness is caused by an intiamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube gets in
tiamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is entire
ly closed deafness is the result, and un
less the inflammation can be taken out
and this tube restored to its normal con
dition, hearing will be destroyed for
ever; nine cases out of ten are caused
by catarrh, which is nothing but an in
flamed condition of the mucous sur
faces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free-
