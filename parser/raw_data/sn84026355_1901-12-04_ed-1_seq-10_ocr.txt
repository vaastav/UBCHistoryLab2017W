th.it railway rates should be ju,-t and reasonable and
that .ill shippers, localities, mid commodities should

just, appreciation of the value of for

t'lvat part played hy theni In tho creation and main

Wise forest protection does not mean tho with
drawal of forest reaourcM, whether of wood, water,
or km-is, from contributing their full hharu to tho
-.Mlf.. re of the people, but, on the contrary, Klves tho
.-.tsurunro of lancer and mora certain supplies. The
fundamental Idea of forestry Is tho perpetuation of
forohtn hy use. Forest protection la not nn end of
itself; it Is a means to Increase, and sustain tho re
sources of our country nnd tho IndustricB which de
pend upon them. The preservation of our forests is
an Imporatlvo business neceaMty, We liavo como to

which I ulnu uliurned wllh the Kcneial advunceineiH
of practical forestry In the United Slates. These
various functions should lie united In thu burenn of
forestry, to which they propurly heloni?. The present
diffusion nf responsibility It bad fiotu every stnntl
polit. It prcvclitH thai effectlvp co-operation between
Hi!' itovcrnntent nnd the men whu iitlllne thu re
sources of tho reserves, without which the Interests
of both must suffer. The scleiitlllc bureaus ueneritlly
rhotild bo put tindcf the dopiirtinenl of tiRrlcllltille.
Tho president should have by law the power of trans
fenlntT lamN for use as forest reserves In the depart
mom of nKilctlltuie. He already has such power hi
Iho case of lands needed by the departments of war
and tho navy,
Thu wise ndmlnlsl ration of the forest reserves will
be not less helpful to the interests which depend on
water than to those which depend on wood nnd (trass.
Tho water supply Itself depends upon the forest. In
tho arid region it Is water, not land, which measures
production. The weleru half of the fulled Htutef
would stistulli a population ureator than that of out
whole country today If the waters Hint now run lu
waste weru saved and used for Irrigation. Tim fur
eat nnd water problems are perhnps the most vital
Internal question of the I'lilted Slates.
t.'crtnln of thu forest reserves should also bo in.uli
preserves lor the wild fot'osl oren lures. All ot tint
teserves should be heller protrcted from llres. .Many
of them need special protection because of the gre.il
Injury done by live stock, above ull by shet p. The
Increaso In deer, elk and other animals In tho Yellow
sloii" 1'ark shows what may be expected when other
mountain forests are propeily protected by Inw mid
properly guarded. Some of these areas have been so
denuded nf surface vegetation by iivergrar.mg that
tho ground breeding birds, Including grouse mid quail,
and many mammals, Including deer, have been exter
minated or driven iiway. At the same time, Iho
wiiter-storlng capacity of the surface lias been de
creased or destroyed, thus, promoting Hoods In timet
of rain and diminishing Hie Mow of streams between
rains.
in ca:-es where natural renditions have been re
stored for a few ears, vegetation has again car
peted tho ground, birds and deer are coming back,
and hundreds of persons, especially from the imme
diate neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the
privilege of camping. Some, at least, of tlio forest
reserves should afford perpetual protection to iho
native fauna and flora, sufo havens of refuge to our
rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds,
and free camping gioiinds for the over-increasing
numbers of men nnd wumeu who lime learned to find
rest, health, and recreation In the splendid forests
and Mower-chid meadows of our mountains. Tho for
est reserves should be set apart forever for the use
and bcnellt of our people as a whole and not sacri
ficed to the short-sighted greed of a few.
Urgent Need
of Irrigation.
The forests are natural reservoirs.
Uy restraining the streams in HooiJ
and replenishing them In drought
they make possible the use of waters otherwise
wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so
protect the storage reservoirs from tilling up with
silt. Forest conservation is therefore an essential
condition of water conservation.
The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate
i ml conserve the wateis of the arid region, (treat
-lornge wotks are necessary to equalize tho flow of
"t reams and to save the flood waters. Their con
struction has been conclusively shown to be an un
dertaking: too vast for private effort. Nor can it be
best accomplished by tho individual states ac.tlnr
alone. Far-reaching interstato problems arc in
volved; mid the resources of single states would often
be Inadequate. It Is properly a national function, at
least In some of its features. It is us right for the
national government to make the streams and rivers
of the arid region useful by engineering works for
water storage as to make useful the rivers and har
bors of the humid region by engineering works of
another kind. The storing of Hie floods In reservoirs
at the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement
of our present policy of river control, under which
levees are built on the lower reaches of the same
streams.
The government should construct and maintain
these reservoirs as it does oilier public works. When
their purpose is to regulate the How of the streams,
the water should be turned freely Into the channels
In Hie dry season to take the same course under the
same laws ah the natural How.
Tlio reclamation of tho unsettled arid public lands
presents a different problem. Here it Is not enough
to regulate tho flow of streams. The object of the
government is to dispose of the land to settlers who
will build homes upon it. To accomplish tills object
water must bo brought with their reach.
Tlio pioneer settlers on the arid publi" domain
hose their homos along streams from which they
could Iheinselves divert Hie water to reclaim their
holdings. Such opportunities are practicallj gone.
There remain, however, vast areas of public land
which can be made available for homestead settle
ment, but only by rp.servoir.-i and main-line canals im
practicable for private enterprise. These irrigation
works should bo built by the national goverumuit.
Tho lands reclilmed by them should be reserved by
Hie government for actual settlers, and the cost of
construct ion should so far as possible bo repaid by the
laud icclalmed. Tho distribution of the water, the
division or the streams among Irrigators, should bo
Iclt to the settlors themselves iu conformity with
stii to laws and without Interference with those laws
or with vested rights. Tho policy of iho national snv
ernrnent should be to aid Irrigation In tho several
status and territories in such manner as will enable
.he people in iho local communities to help them
scIvps, nnd as will stimulate needed reforms hi the
state laws and tcgulaticius governing irrigation.
Tin- reclamation and settlemeni of the arid luniH
will enrich every portion of our country, just as the
ettloniPiit of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought
prosperity lo tho Atlantic states. Tho Increased de
mand for manufactured articles will stimulate Itulus
'ilul production, while wider home niarkets and the
trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies
and effectually prevent vsteru competition with cast
cm agriculture, Indeed, tho products of irrigation
will bo consumed chiefly In upbulldlm; local centers of
mining and oilier Industries, which would otherwise
not come Into existence ut all, Our peoplo as a whole
will profit, for .successful home-making Is but another
namo for tho upbuilding of the nation,
The necessary foundation has already boon laid
for thu Inauguration of the policy just doscribed, It
would bo unwlso to begin by doing too much, for a
great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what
can and whut cannot bo safely nttompted, by the
early efforts, which must of necessity bo partly experi
mental In diameter. At tho very beginning the go
vriunont should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt,
Its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the
broadest public Interest. No reservoir or canal should
ever bo built to satisfy selfish personal or local Inter
ests; but only In accordance wllh tho advlco of trained
exports, after long investigation has shown the local
Uy whero ull tho conditions combine to make tho worl:
most needed and fraught with tho greatest usefulness
to the community as a whole. There should bo no
extravagance, and tho believers in tho need of irriga
tion will moat benefit tholr causo by seeing to It that
It Is frco from the least taint of excossivo or reckless
uxpcndlturo of the public moneys.
Whatever tho nation does for tho extension of Irri
gation should harmonize wllh, und tend to Improve,
tho condition of thoso now Hvlns on Irrlguted land,
Wo aro not at the starting point of this development.
Over two hundred millions of private capital has til
icudy been expended In tho construction of irrigation
works, and many million acres of arid laud reclaimed.
A high degreo of enterprlso and ability has been
el "'0 work Itself; but as much cannot bo said
!u i'i'i e 'be lawa relating thereto, Tho secur
ity tun.' At of iho homes created depend largely on
the stubi.it' rf titles to water; but tho majority of
these rest ou the uncertain foundation of court decl-t-lon:!
rondeicd In ordinary uults at law, With a few
creditable exceptions, tho arid states havo failed lo
iroylde lor the ceiia'n and Just division of iitre.iins
times of scarcity i ' uncurtain laws have
io It possible lo -m to water In cxeesi
1'ial uses or e ..v...!iu i any .arcanis have
i. ,i iv passed into pi ..no . crshlii, or a contiol
I'ljul.'iiicnt lo ownership.
Whofiver controls a stream practically controls Hip
hind II renders productive, und the doctrlno of private
ownership or water npntt from land cannot prevail
without causing enduring wrong. Thn recognition of
Ntich ownership, which has been permitted to grow
up III thu nrld regions, should give way to n moro en
'btlilcned and larger recognition or tho rights of the
public In tho control und disposal or tho public wuler
supplies, t.tiWH founded upon conditions obtaining In
humid regions, where water Is too abundant lo Justify
hoarding it, have no proper application In a dry coun
try. In thu arid states tho only rlghl to water which
should be recognized Is that of use, In Irrigation t Ills
right should ntlac'li to the land reclaimed and be In
separable therefrom, Omitting perpetual water rlghtc
to olhcrs than users, without compensation to the
'public, Is open to all tho objections which npply to
giving awny perpetual franchises to the public utilities
of cities. A Tew of tin- western states havo already
recognized this, and have Incorporated In tholr con
stitutions the (loRlrlnuVif perpetual stnto ownership
of water.
The beiielllH which have followed the unaided de
velopment of the past justify the nation's aid nnd cot
operation In the more dlillcult nnd Important work yet
to bo accomplished, t.aws so vitally affecting home
as ihii.ii- which control the water supply will only be
effective when they have the sanction of tho irriga
tors: teforms can only bp tlnul and satisfactory when
they come through the enlightenment of the people
most concerned. The larger development which na
tional aid Insures should, however, iiwaken In every
arid stnto the determination to make Its Irrigation
system equal In Justice and effectiveness that of iny
country in the civilized world. Nothing could be more
unwise Hum for Isolated communities to continue to
learn everything experimentally. Instead of protltlng
by what Is already known elsewhere. We are dealing
with a new and momentous question, in the pregnant
years while Institutions are forming, and what we do
will affect not only the present but future generations.
Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the larg
est urea of laud und provide homes for the largest
number of people, hut to create for thh, new Industry
the best possible social und Industrial conditions; mid
tills requires that wo not only understand the existing
situation, but avail ourselves of the best expeilcnce of
the tlnio In tho solution of Its problems. A careful
study should bo made, both by Iho nation and the
states, of the Irrigation laws and conditions hero, mid
abroad. I'ltlmately it will probably be necessary for
the nation to co-operate with the several arid states In
proportion as these stales by their legislation and ad
ministration show themselves lit to receive It.
Hawaii, Porto
Rico, Cuba.
In Hawaii out aim must bo to de
velop the territory on the tradi
tional American lines. Wc do not
wish a legion of largo estates tilled by cheap labor;
we wish a healthy American community of men who
themselves till the farms they own. All our legisla
tion for the Islnnds should be shaped wllh this end
in view; the well-being of tho average home-maker
must nfford the. true test of Hie healthy development
of the islands. Thu land policy should as nearly as
possible be modeled on our homestead system.
It Is a pleasure to say that It Is hardly more neces
sary to report as to I'orln Itico than as to any state
or territory within our continental llmltr. The Island
is thriving as never before, and It Is being adminis
tered efllciently and honestly, lis people are now en
ioylng liberty and order under tlio protection of the
United States, and upon this fact we congratulate
them and ourselves. Their materia! welfare must be
as cai'Pfully and jealously considered as the welfare of
any other portion of our country. We have givin
them the great gift of free access for their products
to the markets of Hie United States. I ask the at
tention of the congress to the need of legislation con
cerning the public lands of Porto Rico.
In Cuba such progress has been made toward pul
ling the independent government of the Island upon
a linn footing Hint before the present session of the
congress closes this will bo un accomplished fact.
Cuba will then start as her own mistress; and to the
beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as sho unfolds this
new page of her destiny, we extend our heartiest'
greetings and good wishes, KIsewhero 1 havo dis
cussed Hip qupstion of reciprocity. In the case of
Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality
and of national interest why the policy should lie held
to havo a. peculiar application, and 1 most earnestly
ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed to thu vital
need, of providing for a substantial reduction In tin
tariff duties on Cuban imports into tho United States.
Cuba has In her constitution alllrmed what wo desired,
that she should stand. In Internuttoiial matters, In
closer and more friendly relations vjith us than with
any other power; and wo aro bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass commercial
measures In the Interest of her material well-ncing.
Future of the In the Philippines our problem Ik
Philippines. larger. They aro very rich tropical
islands, inhabited by many varying
tribes,. representing widely different stages of progress
toward civilization. Our eiirnest effort Is to help these
people upward along the stony and dlillcult path that
leads to self-government. We hope to make our ad
ministration of tho islands honorable to our nation
by making it of tho highest benellt to tho Filipinos
themselves; und as un earnest of what wo intend to
do, we point to what wo havo done. Already a greater
measure of muterlul prosperity and of governmental
honesty and efficiency has been attained In tho Phil
ippines than ever before In their history.
II Is no light task for u nation to achieve tho (em
perainental qualities without which the Institutions of
free government aro but an empty mockery. Our peo
ple aro now successfully governing themselves, be
cause for moro than a thousand years they have been
slowly (ltting themselves, sometimes consciously,
' sometimes unconsciously, toward this end. What has
lakcu us thirty generations lo achieve, wo cannot
expect to seo another race accomplish out of hand,
especially when largo portions of thai race start very
far behind the point which our ancestors had reached
even thirty generations ago, In dealing with the Phil
ippine people wo must show both patience nnd
strength, forbearance and steadfast resolution. Our
aim Is high, Wo do nut desire to do for the Islanders
merely what has elsewhere been dono for troplo poo
ides by even the best foreign govcrumonls. Wo lmpi
to do for them what has never before been done for
any peoplo ot the tropics to muke. them III for self
government after the fashion of tho really tree na

instnnco in which u masterful moo such us ours. Imv
lug been forced by tho exigencies of war In take pos
session of an alien laud, has behaved to its inhabit
ants with the disinterested zenl for their progress that
our pi oph have shown In the Philippines, To leave
tho Inlands at this time would mean thai thuy would
fall into u welter of murderous anurchy, Such deser
tion of duty on our part would ho a crime against
humanity. The character of Governor Tuft and of his
associates and subordinates Is u proof, If such be
needed, of thu sincerity of our effort to glvo tho Island
ors a constantly Increasing1 monsuro of self-govern-inent,
exactly as fast as they show themselves lit lo
oxurclso It. Since the civil government waa esiule

In our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the
Philippines, It may bo that hero and there wo have
Bono too rapidly Iu giving tliciu local snif-govornmeni.
It Is on this side that our error, If any, has been com
mitted. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of
Hnding out the farts und Influenced only by a ileslrn
for the welfare of the natives, can assert that wo have
not gone far enough. Wo havo gono to tho very verge
of safety In hastening tho process. To havo taken a
Hliiglo step further or faster In advance would li.ivi
been folly and wenkness, und might well have been
crime. Wo are extremely anxious that tho unlive

aro unxlous, first for their sukes, and next, because
it relieves us of a groat burden. There need not be
tho slightest fear of our nol continuing to give them

Tho only fear Is lest in our overunxlcty wo give

have already occurred. In other words, thero Is no
tho slightest chmico ot our fulling to show a sum
clently htimanlturlau spirit, Tho danger comes In the
opposite direction.
Thero are still troubles uheiid In tho Islands. Tin
Insurrection has become un uffnlr of local band lit'
and mnrnuders, who deserve no higher regard than
tho brigands of portions of the Old World. Kncotit
agement, direct or Indirect, to theso Insurrectos
stands mi tho same footing ns encouragement to hos
tile Indians In thn days when we still hnd Indlun wars.
lOxactly us our nlm Is to give to the Indian who re
mains peaceful tho fullest and amplest consideration,
but lo have It understood that wo will show no weak
ness If ho goes on the warpath, so wo must muke It
evident, unless wo uro fulsu to our own traditions nnd
to the doinnnds of civilization nnd humnnlty, that
while wo will do everything in our power for tho Fili
pino who is peaceful, wo will take the sternest meas
ures with tho Filipino who follows tho path of the
Insurrecto and the Indrone.
The heartiest praise Is due to large numbers of the
natives of tho Island for their steadfast loyalty. Tho
JIaeabcbes have been conspicuous for their courage
nnd devotion to tho Hag. I recommend that tho scre
tary of war be empowered to tako somo systematic
action In the way of aiding those of these men whu
ore crippled in the service and tho famlllos of those
who aro killed.
The Hmo bus eomo when there should be addi
tional legislation lor the Philippines. Nothing beltei
pan bo done for tho Islands than to Introduce Indus
trial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so
much as throwing them open to Industrial develop
ment. The connection between Idleness and mischief
is proverbial, and tho opportunity to do remunerative
work Is one ot the surest preventives of war. Of
course no business man will go Into Hip Phlllpplner
unless It Is to his Interest to do so; nnd It Is Immense
ly to the Interest of tho Islands that he should go In.
It Is therefore necessary that the congress shook'
pass laws by which tho resources of the Islands can
ho developed; so that franchises (for limited terms oJ
years) can be. granted to companies doing business li
I hem. and every encouragement be given to the In
coming of business men of every kind.
Not to permit this is to do wrong to the Philip
pines. The franchises must be granted und tho busi
ness permitted only under regulations which will
guarantee the Islands against tiny kind of Impropev
exploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the
Islands must be developed, and the capital willing ti
develop It must bo given the opportunity, Tho ficli1
must bo thrown open to Individual enterprise, which
has been tho real factor iu the development of ever:
region over which our flag has flown. It Is urgently
necessary to enact, suitable laws dealing with general
transportation, mining, bunking, currency, home
steads, and the use and ownership of tho hinds and
timber. These laws will give free play to Industrial
enterprise; and tho commercial development which

The Transisthminn
Canal.
No single great material work
which remains to bo under
taken on this continent is of
such consequence to tho American peoplo as the build
ing of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North
and South America. Its importance to tho nation Is
by no means limited merely to Its material effects
upon our business prosperity; and yet. with view to
these effects alone It would be to the last degree Im
portant for us immediately to begin it. While its
lienellelal effects would perhaps be most marked upon
tho Pacltlc coast and tho Ctulf and South Atlantic
states. It would also greatly benefit other sections. Il
is emphatically a work which it Is for the interest of
the entire country to begin and complete ns soon an
possible; it is out- of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake, with prospects of success,
and which when done aro not only permanent assets
hi the nation's material interests, but standing monu
ments to it.s constructive ability.
I am glnd to bo able to announce to you that our
negotiations on this subject with Cheat Britain, con
ducted on both sides In a spirit of friendliness and
mutual good will and respect, have resulted in my Do
ing ublo to lay beforo thu senate a treaty which if
ra tilled will enable us to begin preparations for mi
isthmian canal at any time, and which guarantees to
this nation every right that it has ever asked In con
nection with thu canal. In this treaty, tlio old Clay-tou-nnlwer
treaty, so long recognized as Inadequate
io supply tho base for tho construction and mainten
ance of a. necessarily American ship canal, Is abro
gated. It specifically provides that tho Hulled State.
alone shall do the work of building and nssumo the
responsibility ot Hafeguardlng tho canal and shall
regulate Its neutral use by all nations on terms of
equality without the guaranty or interference of any
outside nation from any quarter. Thu signed treaty
will nt onco bo laid beforo the senate, and if approved
tho congress can then proceed to g' 'e effect to tho ad
vantages it secures us by providing for thu building
of tho canal.

The American The true end of every great and
Doctrine. free people should ho self-respeci-
lug peace; and this nation most
i-nrueslly desires .ducere and cordial friendship wllh
all others. Over the entire world, nf recent years,
wars between the great civilized powers h.ivo become
loss and less frequent, Wurs with barbarous or semi
barbarous peoples come In mi entirely dllfereul cute,
gory, being merely a most regruttablo but necessary
Internatlouul pollen duty which must be performed
for tho sake of the welfare of inunkliid. Pence can
only be kept with cerluluty where both sides wish lu
keep It; bin more und more the civilized peoples me
realizing the wicked folly of war and uro attaining
Hint condition of Just und Intelligent regard for Hie
lights of others which will iu thu cud, us wo hope anil
believe, mal.'e world-wldu peace possible, Tlio peace
eonferenco ut Thu Hague gavo definite expression to
ihis hope nml belief und marked u stride toward theli
attainment.
Thin t'uine pence t'onferencu acquiesced in our
statement of tho .Monroe doctrine, us compatible with
Iho purposes mid ulnts ut tho conference.
The Monroe doctrlno should be tho cardinal fca
tuio ut tho foreign policy of all tho nations of Hie
two Americas, ns It Is of the United Stales, Just
Huveuty-clght years havo passed slncu President Sinn
rou in his annual message uuuuuiiccd that "The
American continents nru henceforth nut to no consid
ered as subjects for future colonization by any Kuio
pean power." In other words, the Monroe doctrine is
a declaration that there must bo no territorial ag
grandizement by any non-American power al tho ex
pense of any American power on American soil, it Is
iu no wlsa intended us hostile to any nation iu tho
Old World. Still less Is It Intended to givo cover to
uny aggression by one New World power ut tho ex
pense of uny other. It Is simply a step, und a Ions
slop, toward assuring tho universal pence of the world
hy securing tho possibility of perniuncnt peace on this
hemisphere.
During tho past century other Influences havo es
tablished tho pcimancncu and Indepcndcnco of the
smnll suites ot Hurope. Through tho Monroe doctrlnt
we hope to ho able lo safeguard like Independence nnd
secuto llko pormnnenco for tho lesser among the New
World nations.
This doctrine hns nothing to do with the commer
cial relations of uny American power, suvo thnt It In
truth allows each of them lo form such as It dcslrci.
In other words, II Is really a guaranty of tho commer
cial Independence uf the Americas. We do not ask
under this doctrlno for any exclusive commercial deal
ing!) with uny pther American state. Wo do not guar
nntep nny stntc against punishment If It misconduct
Itself, provided Hint punishment docs not take the
form of tho acquisition of territory by uny non-Ametl-can
power.
Our attitude In Culm Is u sumclent guaranty of
our own good fnllh. Wc have not trie slightest desire
to securo any territory at tho expense of any of our
neighbors, Wo wish to work with them hntul In hand,
so that nil ot us may be uplifted together, nnd w
rejoice over the good fortune of nny of them, w
gladly hall their material prosperity nnd political
stability, nml am concerned nnd alarmed If any of
them fall Into Industrial or political chaos. Wo do not
wish to see any Old World military power grow up
on this continent, or to bo compelled to become a mili
tary power ourselves, Tho peoples of the American
can prusper best It left to work out their own salva
tion In their own way.
Why We Need a
Larger Navy.
The work of upbuilding the nftvy
must bo steadily continued. No
one point of our policy, foreign
or domestic, is more Important Hum this to the honor
und material welfare, and above all lo tho peace, of
our nation In tho future. Whether we desire It or nol,
wo must henceforth recognize that we have interna
tional duties no less than International rights. Kven
If our ling were hauled down In the Philippines nnd
Porto Itlco. oven If we decided not to build the Isth
mian cannl, we should need u thoroughly trained
navy of adequate size, or else be prepared definitely
und for all time to abandon the Idea that our nation
is among those whose sons go down lo the sea In
ships. Unless our commerce Is alwuys to be carried In
foreign bottoms, wo must havo war craft to protect It.
Inasmuch, however, as the American people have
no thought of abandoning tho path upon which they
have entered, nnd especially In view of tho fact that
tho building of the Isthmian cannl Is fast becoming
one of the mutter.' which the whole people are united
In demanding, It Is Imperative that our navy should
bo put nnd kept lu tho highest stnte of efficiency, nnd
should be made to answer to our growing needs. So
far from being lu any way a provocation to war, an
adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty
against war. the cheapest and most effective pence
Insurance. The cost of building and maintaining such
a navy represents the very lightest premium for In
suring pence which this nation can possibly pay.
Probably no other great, nation In the world Is so
anxious for peace as we are. There Is not a single
civilized power which has anything whatever to fear
from aggressiveness on our part. All we want Is
ppnee; and toward this end we wish to lie uble lo
secure the same respect for our rights from others
which we are eager and anxious to extend to thvdr
rights iu return, to Insure fair treatment to us com
mercially, and In guarantee the safely of the Ameri
can people.
Our people Intend lo abide by the Monroe doctrine
and to Insist upon It as the one sure means of secur
ing the peace of the Western hemisphere. The navy
offers us the only means of making our Insistence
upon the Monroe doctrine anything bill a subject of
derision to whatever nation chooses to dlsr-'gard il.
We. desire Hie peace which comes as of right to the
Just man armed; not the peace granted on terms of
Ignominy lo the craven and tho weakling.
It Is not possible to improvise n navy after war
breaks out. The ships must be built nnd the men
irnlned long in advance. Somo auxiliary vessels eun
be turned Into makeshifts which will do hi default of
any better for tho minor work, and a proportion of
raw men can be mixed with the highly trained, their
shortcomings being- made good by the skill of their
fellows; but the clllcient fighting force of the navy
when pitted against an equal opponent will be found
almost exclusively In the warships Unit have been
regularly built and In the officers and men who
through years of faithful performance of sea duty
have been trained lo handle their formidable hut com
plex and delicate weapons with the highest etflclency.
In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the
decislvo blows at Manila and Santiago had been
launched from two to fourteen years-, and they were
aide to dons they did because tho men in the conning
towers, the gun turrets, and the engine rooms had
through long years of practice ut sea learned how to
do their duty.
Our present navy was begun hi 1SM'. At that peiiod
our navy consisted of a collection of antiquated
wooden ships, alreudy almost as out of place against
modern war vessels ns the galleys of Alcihiades nnd
Hamllcnr certainly us the ships of Trnmp and Blake.
Nor nt that time did we liavt men fit to handle a
modern man-of-war. Under the wise legislation of the
congress and the successful administration of a suc
cession of patriotic secretaries of tho navy, belonging
to both political parties, the work of upbuilding the
navy went on. and ships equal to nny In Hie world
of their kind were continually added; and what was
even moro Important, these ships were exercised at
soa singly mid in squadrons until the men aboard
thorn were able to get the best possible service out of
them. The result was seen In the short war with
Spain, which was decided wllh such rapidity because
of the infinitely greater preparedness of our navy
than of the Spnnlsh navy.
Whllu uwnrdlng the fullest honor In the men who
actually commanded and manned the ships wliich de
stroyed the Spanish sou forces in the Philippines and
iu Cuba, wo must not forget that an equal meed of
praise belongs lo those without whom neither blow
could huve been struck, The congressmen who voted
years lu advance tho money to lay down tho ships,
to build the guns, to buy the nrmor-plate; the de
partment ofllululs and the business men and wage
workers who furnished what tho congress had au
thorized; tho secretaries of the navy who asked for
and expended the appropriations; nnd finally the offi
cers who, in full- weather and foul, on actual sea ser
vice, trained and disciplined the crows of tho ships
when there wns no war In sight nil are entitled to a
full share In the glory of Manila nnd Santiago, and
the respect accurilid by every true American to thoso
who wrought such signal triumph for our country.
It wns forethought nnd preparation which secured us
the overwhelming triumph of 1S0S. If wo full to show
forethought anil preparation now, there may como a
time when disaster will bpfall us instead of triumph:
and should this time come, the fault will rest pri
marily, not upon those whom Urn accident of event
puis in supreni" command nt the moment, but upon
those who have failed to prepare In advance.
There should bo no cessation lu the work of com
pleting nur navy. So far Ingenuity has been wholly
unable tu devise a siibstituto for thn great war craft
whoso hiimmerlng guns beat out the mastery of the
high i-eiis, it Is unsafe and unwlso not to provldo thU
year for several additional bnttlo ships and heavy
iumoied cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in
proportion; for the exact numbers und character I
lifer you lo the icport ot tho secrelnry of the navy.
Hut theie Is something wn iiped oven moro than addi
tional ships, und UiH is additional nfllcers and men.
To provldo battle ships und cruisers and then Iny them
up, with the expectation of leaving them unmanned
until they uro needed In iiotuul war. would be worse
than folly; It would bo u crime against tho nation,
To send uny warship against a competent enemy
inloss those aboard It liuvo been trained by years of
urinal sea service, including Incessant gunnery prac
lice, would bo to Invito not mere disaster, hut th
bitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand addi
tional seamen and ouo thousand additional marines
should bo provided; and nn Increase In the officers
should bo provided by making a large addition to tho
classes at Annapolis, There is ono small matter which
should be mentioned In connection with Annapolis,
Tho pretentious mid unmeaning tltlo of "naval cadet"
should bo abolished; tho title of "midshipman," full
of historic, association, should be restored.
Kven lu time ot pcaco a wurshlp should bo used
until It wears out, for only so can It bo kept fit to re
