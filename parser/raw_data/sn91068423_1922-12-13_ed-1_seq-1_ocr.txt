Kaleiuh, N. C, Dee. 13. No action
will be taken asainst Capt. Walter
Yoemans of the coast guard station at
Portsmouth, N. C, who " was accused
by a witness of Arthur Coleman, own
er of the Message (,f Peace, ami Claud
Craham, supercargo, charged with vio
lating the national prohibition laws, of
having' a lantern while Coleman remov
ed liquor from the vessel for sale to
two Eoston sportsmen, R. A. Kohloss,
federal prohibition director, said today.
"Captain Yoemans was on the vessel
at the time the alleged sale was made
in the capacity of coast guard officer
rendering assistance to a ship in dis
tress," said Mr. Kohloss, "and was not
in charge. The Message of Peace is
a British vessel and while it was a vio
lation for liquor to be sold at Ocra
coke, I do not think Mr. Yoemans
knew this, as this is one of the first
cases reported in North Carolina."
The director said he did not know
whether the treasury department, un
der which the officer works, . would
take the matter, up.

man will be shipped to her former

Mrs. Richardson was formerly.. Miss
The'ima Ham, a daughter of Mrs.
Bell Ham, who now resided in the

The theory now under considera

shot the girl during a quarrel in
the belief that the girl was about
to kill him or that she was shot in a
struggle, a;s the revolver was her
propertv. J. Mosby West, who ac
companied Mrs. Richardson, and Pol

Raleigh, N. c!, Dec. 12. The latest
foreign information on crops and
markets indicate for thirteen leading
countries a slighp reduction in acre
age of corn, as compared with last
year and the usual, which was 133,
330,030 million acres. The nroduction
shows about nine percent decrease
from last year's crop in sixteen coun
tries." This statement is contained in n
digest of official agricultural reports
issued today by Frank Parker, statis
tician of the North Carolina and Unit
ad States departments of agriculture.
"Europe's production of corn shows
a great decrease," it is stated. "The
United States and -Argentina supply
80 percent of the corn entering the
world trade, according to estimates.
These two countries export about the.
same quantity in the long average,
although we exceeded them almost
twenty percent last year.
"Most classes of livestock are be
low the pre-war level in number.
"The leading twenty four foreign
countries have experienced the same
general price level since the war
period. The high point was reached
in 1920 and fell until the summer of
1)22. Since then the trend has been
upward again.
"We are thankful that our south
land is being the first to recover -from
the distressingly adverse conditions.
Although cotton is generally ipoor,
North Carolina has a ood crop when
Considering the weevil and weather
damages. General business has been
much stimulated.
"This year's national corn crop is
back to the 1916-1920 average and
prices are much better than last year's
over-production. The Irish potato crop
is distressingly large. Many fields in
the western states will not be dug
at all. Rotting is bad with both the
white and sweet potatoes. Prices of all
lotatoes are very low.
"The present outlook for tobacco is
considerably below the 1916-1920 aver
age . but twenty eight percent more
than last years, small crop. North
Carolina prices are ix cents per pound
hie-her than 1921-average of twenty
five percent. The cotton crop, which
is reconed at. 19.100.000 bales is twenty
five percent more, thon made last year,
but also is less than the consumption
needs. The shortage is reflected in the
price level:
"It is of especial interest to note
that abou 12 percent more production
of all the crops is made this year than
last, but that we have no morethan
the fiveyear average production," the
digest states.

Rev. "W. TI. McNairy addressed the
welfare league of West Hickory and
Longview last night on "The Sins of
Youth," and the need for combatting
this great evil. Rev.'G. H. Pye, mastor
of the Church of God, offered prayer.
Mr. McNairy took the position that
the social evil must be solved through
the youth of the land, which he as
serted was worse than intemperance,
as great an evil -as it is. Immorality
was the cause of the fall of Babylon,
Greece and Rome. Unless there is im
provement, America Will go the same
way.
The penalty for immorality is a most
horrible disease, and there are yr"
suffering , from these horrible discn
ses.
The speaker described the school in
Kinston for the feeble minded. Most
of these feeble minded children arc
thus because of the immorality ot
somebody. Most of the divorces are
brought about from the result of im
morality. Let us do all we can to stop all
foul taik. The welfare league should
see to it that the pictures suggesting
evil be stopped. The welfare league
should see to it that people who make
a business of immorality are stopped.
Brother McNairy told of a hansome
ly diessed young man who boasted
that he had led astray a pure girt.
Some of the audience suggested that
such a man should be sent to the
penitentiary for life or electrocuted
The speaker declared his belief that
he should be rendered harmless for
all time.

Raleigh, N. C, Dec. 13. The su
preme court to'day handed down a de
cision granting a new trial to O. G.
(Red) Thomas, Charlotte automobile
dealer, convicted in Cabarrus of sec
ond degree murder in connection with
the killing of A. J. Allen at Kannapo
lis near Concord last October. Thom
as was under sentence of 18 years.
The court held that Judge J. Bis
Ray had failed in his charge to the
jury to state in "a plain and correct
manner the evidence in the case" and
"to explain the law arising therefrom."
'.'We did not intend tQ suggest that
his honor did not charge the jury as
to manslaughter," says the opinion.
He did, but in doing so, he failed to
instruct them on one of the import
ant phases of manslaughter."
Thomas admitted he shot and killed
Allen with a pistol, but contended he
shot in self defense. The shooting oc
curred near Kannapolis on October 25,
1921.
The court did not hand down an
opinion in the case of John Bush on
appeal from Caldwrell county.
