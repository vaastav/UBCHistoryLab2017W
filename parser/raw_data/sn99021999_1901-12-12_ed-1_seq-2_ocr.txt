WASHINGTON, Dee. 11. When the sen
ate met today pruytfr was oitereil by Hcv.
Hcrrlck Johnson of ChlcaKO, Chaplain Mil
burn, beinfi absent. The house concurrent
resolution, providing for u holiday ndjourn
ment from December 19, until Jnnuary 6.
1002, was referred to tho committee on
appropriations. Tho senntu at 12:22 p. tn.
on motion of Mr. Lodge went Into executive
Bcstloh to further consider thu Hay-l'auncc-foto
treaty nnd at 2:60 p. tn. adjourned until
tomorrow.
Two speeches on tho Ilay-I'aunccfoto
treaty wcro made In the executive session
of tho sennto today, one by Senator Uacon.
In opposition of tho treaty, nnd the other
by Senator Ciillom, the protective chair
man of tho committee on foreign relations,
In BUpport of It.
Mr. Ilncon replied to thu speech made
yestrrilny by Senator I.odRe. Ho summed
up his objections In tho statement that he
could not freely accept any treaty which
does not place the iuhmlati canal entirely
under American auspices and American
control. This, he said, tho pending treaty
dors not do, nor docs It do anything like It.
It did not by long odds accomplish what
had been accomplished by the senate amend
ment made to tho Ilay-l'aunecfotc treaty
nt the last fosslon of congress. Tho Davis
amendment, he said, had abrogated all tho
nbjectlonnl provisions of that treaty us
negotiated and It did not muttor what pro
visions thcro was In the agreement, so
long as tho United Stales were authorized
as they were by tho principal Davis amend
ment, to secure the safety and maintenance
of tho canal by tholr own force.
II lull I of Control n DcIurIiiii.
That amendment had given this country
n free hand to do what was necessnry
for the protection and defense of the canal,
whereas tho prcrcnt treaty carried all the
restrictions which were originally con
trained In tho old treaty, leaving out the
modifications of the Davis amendment. Ho
also pointed out that tho treaty repro
duces tho restrictions of tho old Suez canal
treaty, which had been Incorporated In tho
original convention. Ho charged that tlieso
restrictions had been copied almost ver
batim from tho old treaty, tho only material
chango being In the omission of tho words
"In time of war as In time of peace" from
rulo 1 of tho Suez canal agreement. This
omltislon did not, In his opinion, chHiigo
tho character of the agreement.
"Tho only reply," hu said, "which tho ad
vocates of tho treaty malm to criticism Is
that tho canal would be. under the full con
trol of tho United States In tlmo of war,
but this Is no more true now than under
tho old treaty, and It is n strango thing
that nil tho provisions refer to the con
trol of tiie canal In war, notwithstanding
It Is contended here that In that contin
gency tho removal of this phase places tho
canal under our absolute control."
Dnvla Ainctiiliiiciit IInnoii t Inl.
Ho said tho war restrictions of the treaty
wero entirely Inconsistent with tho claims
of Senator Lodgo thnt this country should
Kay who should use tho canal and who.
should not tn caso of hostilities. Ho con
tended that tho only power given to tho
United States which was not given to Rre.it
Ilrltatu was found tn tho last sentence of
regulation 2, providing that "tho United
States shall be at liberty to maintain such
military police along tho canal as may be
necessary to protect tt against lawlessness
nnd dlordor."
This, bo said, was not sufficient to make
tho canal nn American Institution ami If
tho Davis nmomlincnt had boon necessary
to render tho origlual treaty acceptable it
was equally necessary In this Instance. Ho
considered the pending treaty every whit as
objectionable ns the treaty of tho last ses
sion. Ho quoted tho fourth article of tho
pending treaty, na follows:
"It Is agreed that no chango of territorial
sovereignty or of International rolatlons of
tho country or countries traversed by the
before mentioned canal shall nffect tho gen
cral principle of neutralization of tho ob
ligation of the high contracting parties
under tho present treaty."
ine encct or tins provision, he said was
Inevitably to surrender control of the canal
belt In caso tho ownership of tho soil em
braced In It should pnss to the United
State. Ho pointed out that this restriction
bud not been Incorporated In tho first treaty
nnd said It was entirely out of placo In tho
revised agreement. Indeed, he thought
thoro would bo nlmoat ns much objection to
guaranteeing neutrality on land owned by
tho United StntcB on tho Isthmus of Panama
ns on land hold by a canal crossing the
peninsula of Florida.
In conclusion Mr. llacon announced that
hllo ho had no Intention of voting for
the trcnty, he would do nothlug to obstruct
Its rntlllcatlou.
t'lilliini III Ilefcime,
Senator Cullom conftratulated tho senato
nnd tho rouutry upon tho fact that there
aro two things In connection with the now
treaty upon which, he said, practically nil
ero agreed. One of these was the desira
bility of tho supercesslnn of tho Clnyton
llulwer treaty, uud tho other that of tho
necessity for tho construction of nn Uth
tnlnn cnnnl.
Ho contended that tho now treaty rad
loally changes tho conditions presented by
tho first Hny-Pnuncefoto treaty, clearly re
llcving It of the necessity of such nn amend
ment a thnt mado to tho old treaty upon
tho suggestion of Senator Davis, because
tho treaty Itself would permit tho United
Etates under International law to own, mnn
ago and defend tho canal In any way that
It might thoouo.
In other words, ho added, In n war with
Orcut Hrltaln or with any other power tho
treaty would bo suspended, under tho law
which governs nations, until the wnr shoub
bq concluded, when It would bo revived nn
ngnln enforced, Ilo dwelt upon tho fnct
which, he said, was the most Important
ctrcumstnnco to bo considered, that tho new
treaty supercedes nnd abrogates tho Clay
ton-Uulwer convention of 1850 und for this
reason would bo of untold valuo to tho
country.
I iiltrit HtntPM linn Ample I'luvcr.
Ho ndmlttcd that tho now treaty retains
tho general principles of neutralization, n
' Humors
' They take possession of the body, and.
re lords of Misrule.
They ore attended by pimples, bolls, the
Itching tetter, salt rheum, nnd other cu
taneous eruptions: by feolliurs of weakness,
languor, general debility and what not.
They cause moro suffering thnn anything
llmlth. Strength. Peace anil Pleasure
require their expulsion, nnd this Is posi
tively effected, according to thousands ol
trnteful testimonials, by
Hood' Smrmapmrillm
which radically ancj permanently drlvea
fuem out ana uuuaa up iuc wouio sjriww.
did the original Hay-I'auncefoto treaty, but
he urged thnt It does not re-enact or keep
nllve any of tho provisions of the treaty
of 1130,
While It retains tho doctrine of neutrali
zation tho provision making that retention
applies, the senator contended to nil nations
alike, but to none of them for any longer
time than they observe the regulations
prescribed by the United States. When
they should fall In this observance we
could close the canal under tho terms of
the treaty. All nations would be treated
on terms of fairness and equality by allow
ing nil to use the canal In time of peace
nnd shutting out all In time of war In
disc It should bo found desirable to do so.
In short. Senator Cullom urged that thero
Is no provision In tho pending convention
which would Interfere with our right as u
nation to close up the wafer-wny to nny
belligerent power..
He contended that the provision In regard
to the policing of the cnnnl applies to Its
control In times of peace, nnd not In time
of wnr.
Control liy I'ollce or llllllnry.
Then tho United Stales, being tho owner
of tho property, undor tho terms of tho
law It could control It with either
police or military power as It might choose
for the protection of our government nnd
Its proporty.
Referring to tho fourth article of the
treaty which was not contained In the
old trcnty, Senator Cullom held that tho
provision regarding tho change of sover
eignty would mnko no real dlffcrenco In the
conditions, ns tho snmo rulo would apply
If the sovereignty of tho country traversed
by tho cnnnl should come to tho United
Stnlcs. Under that Improbable condition
tho cnml could bo closed In caso of war.
Just ns It could be In case the sovereignty
should remain where It now Is, as tho
senator predicted It would remain.
In this connection ho quoted from Presi
dent Hoosevelt's messnge, saying that the
United States Is not necking to extend
its borders, nnd nddlng that tho chances
wcro ten to ono that this country would
not seek to secure new territory In that
direction. As n mnttcr of fact, ho said, the
people do not want more territory than
we now have, but are content to lenvo tho
boundaries ns they nt present exist.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Tho democratic
senators today held their first caucus of
tho present session. Its purpose 'was to
consider committee assignments, but the
occasion was moro than ordlnnrlly signifi
cant because of the general attendance) upon
tho caucus.
All the senators elected ns democrats,
with tho exception of Senator McLaurln of
South Carolina, wore present, ns wero nil
the senntors who wcro elected ns silver re
publicans or populists. All tho Independ
ents except Senator Teller of Colorndo had
entered tho democratic caucus hold Just be
fore ndjouniment last March, but Sonntor
Teller then remained nwuy. He was pres
ent, however, nt todny's conferenco nnd
participated in tho proceedings.
Tho caucus was colled nt the Instnnco of
Sonntor Joins of Arknnsas, who had said
ho thought It pondblo that the new senn
tors might wnnt to mnke some chango In
tho caucus. Thoro wns, however, nn ex
prcfslou of satisfaction with the present
olllfcrs nnd Senator Jones wni elected unan
imously chairman of the committee. Tho
old committee on tho order of business was
nleo reappointed ,nnd the ono vncancy on
that committee wns filled by the selection of
Senator Dubois of Idaho, who was tho
choice of oil the western members of the
caucus.
Teller I'leniN for lliirinony.
During tho proceedings Senator Teller
suggested thnt there should bo frequent
conferences nnd continued effort to ngrce
on tho main features of tho present con
troversies. Thero wns quite n gcnernl re
sponse to this suggestion, nnd tho opinion
wns fairly unanimous that the party should
present a united front, permitting of no
more straggling than was absolutely neces
sary.
Senator Jones presented n stntcment from
the republican committee on committees
outlining Its wishes ns to the committee
nsslgnments, from which It nppearcd that
the republicans wero nnxlous to Increase
the republican membership of several com
mittees nnd to decrease tho democratic
membership of a few of tho committees.
Tho most important change suggested by
them was that the republicans should bo
allowed' to add ono to their sldo of tho com
mittee on commcroo, while tho democrats
should agree, to surrender ono of tho plnccs
on that commlttco held by them. The com
mittee as now constituted Includes ton re
publican members nnd seven democratic
members.
Wnnt lliitinl Itciircsf ntntlon.
It was decided vigorously to resist this
Innovation. Tno republicans also expressed
n desire to Increase the membership of tho
committees on agriculture and cenmis from
nine to eleven each, the new members to
bo republicans; to lucrenso the committee
on claims from thirteen to fourteen, tho
republicans to have eight members nnd tho
democrats six, ns against seven nnd six re
spectively ns tho commltfco Is now consti
tuted. An Increase Is also proposed In thu
committee on foreign relations.
An It at present stands tho committee
numbers eleven members, four of whom arc
democrnts. Tho proposal Is to make It
consist of thirteen mumbers, eight of whom
shnll bo republicans nnd five democrats. A
chango was also suggested In the committee
on Irrigation, which Is at present composed
of six republicans nnd llvu democrats,
lonei mi I'liiiincc Committee.
Tho change If adopted would glvo n mem
borshlp of eleven, only four of whom would
bo democrats. The democrats decided to
oppose tho proposed changes In the com
mittees on clnlms and Irrigation.
The republican committee suggested no
changes in tho committees on npproprln
Hons, finance and Judiciary, but Indicated
that they will contlnuo Scnntor Jones of
Novnda on the finance committee, thus prnc
tlcnlly adding one to the republican rep
rescntatlon and taking from the opposition
representation.
Tho republicans did not Intlmnto any In
tention to tako care of Senator Wellington
In tho matter of committees nor was uny
suggestion mado In the caucus that tho
democrnts should find places for htm.

on the Count,
The Omaha police believe they have un
der arrest one of tho persons Implicated In
tho $15,000 diamond robbery committed In
Portlnnd, Ore., November 17, nn nccount of
which was In the Assoclnted Press dis
patches nt the time. Though uenrly n
month hns passed since then and detectives
all over the rouutry have been working on
tho case, encouraged by tho offers of re
wnrd, not the slightest rlue enmo to light
until the arrcet w,ib made In Omaha. The
suspect Is a negress named True Johnson.
In her possession hus been found diamonds
and Jewelry to tho v.i'uo of $3,000, each
Item of which answers the description sent
out by tho owners of tho property. Tho
chief hopes through her to find tho rest of
the loot.
With her wno nrrestcd her lover, W. H.
Woods, who is suspected of having ut least
a guilty knowledge of tho robbery.
On Sunday night, November 17, Albert F.
Low en thai, traveling salesman for n New
York Jewelery house, put up at tho Port
land hotel, Portland, Ore. His sample
cases wcro left In his room while he went
down to supper. When he returned tt wns
to find the room unlocked, tho sample cases
opon and nil of the most valuable Jewelry
gone. He gave tho alarm at once. Half
tho pollco force of Portlnnd was turned
loose on the case. But tho nuthortlos woro
handicapped from the llrst, becauso no one
had been seen to enter Ioweuthnl's npnrt-
mcnt or come out of tt nnd no description
of tho thief or thieves wns to bo had.
Clrculnrs giving a description of tho prop
erty wcro printed nnd scattered broadcast
over tho country, Tho chief of pollco of
cacli largo city received a rolt of them, with
n request that he furnish each pawnbroker
In his city with a copy. Tho Plnkerton Do
toctlvo agency wns then plnccd tu charge of
tho ense.
Tho ctrculnr describes 223 diamond
brooches, ninety-two diamond senrf pins,
flfty-thrco diamond rings nnd moro thnn 100
miscellaneous articles.
DlNttirliN Chief Iteverli-n.
Ln?t Monday night ns Chief Donahue nnd
Captuln Her were sitting In the olllce of tho
former In tho city hall a well known Omaha
pawnbroker entered hurriedly. Ho wub evi
dently much excited. Holding up to the
olllcers' Inspection a beautiful diamond
brooch, he exclaimed:
"I've Just given my check for $200 for
this, and the woman who sold It to me und
no more than gono out of the door beforo I
became suspicious either that tho brooch
wan stolen or thnt It was comparatively
valueless.
Tho chief examined It, and compared It
with the goods desrrlbed in tho circular. It
corresponded with the flist turn In the Port
lnnd list n diamond sunburst on a ground
work of filigree gold, ten flame-shaped
points mado of one-clghth-cnrat diamonds
radiating from n Inrgcr diamond In tho cen
ter.
Then the chU.f nnd tho cnptnln shared tho
excitement ot tho pawnbroker.
"There's no doubt but this Is from tho
Portland Job," said tho chief. "What kind
of n looking woman was she"
"Sho wns a negress, rather heavy set.
chocolate colored nnd wore n brocuded tan
Jacket. She suld her name was Williams
and gave her address as 121 North Eleventh
street."
For tho next twenty mlnutra the chief
wns busy with tho telephone. As fast as
they could bo located detectives wore mar
shaled at the police station, which Is within
a block of tho Eleventh street address.
Detectives Donahue, Heltfcld, Drummy
nnd Mitchell were detailed on tho case.
Cnptureil In Short Order.
The quartet first went to tho Eleventh
street house, to And It securely locked nnd
tho lights out. They then prosecuted the
fecnrch elsewhere. An hour later Detectives
Donahuo and Ileltfeld arrested the woman
nnd Harry Woods In nn enst side restau
rant, where they were discussing an elabo
rate meal, with wdne on tho nlde. They
recognized tho woman nt oneo as Truo
Johnson. Her hnnds were fairly ablaze
with diamonds, nnd two or three stones of
the first wnter twinkled from Woods' shirt-
front. Tho pnlr wns tnken to the station
and consigned to tho sweatbox.
Detectives Mitchell and Drummy thon
went to the house, which they searched
thoroughly, even Inking up the carpets and
overhauling the 'excelsior In tho mnttresttes.
Thero they found another sunburst which
had been mado luto u locket, ten diamond
pins, a fine gold watch and chain, a pawn
ticket, a railroad ticket to Portland, Ore.,
nnd sovernl less valuable articles of Jew
elry. llernvcrs the Check.
When tho woman was searched at tho
pollco stntlon tho $200 check which had
boon given her by tho pawnbroker was
found In her stocking. She admitted that
sho Intended cashing It before returning to
her room that night nnd thnt sho Intended
to use the money In tho purchase of a ttckot
to Portlnnd, to be used by Woods. It was
their plan to stnrt for tho west within tho
next twclvo hours, Sho admitted nlso that
sho had had tho second sunburst mnde Into
a locket, Intending to mnko Woods a Christ
man present of It. She denied nil knowl
edge of tho robbery, however. Her mother
had died recently, sho said, leaving her
sorao money, which sho bad Invested in dia
monds. Chief Donahue has received n telegram
from William Plnkerton congratulating htm
on the capture.
Alfred F. Lowenthal, tho salesman who
was robbed, Is now on his way to Omaha to
Identify the property nnd file n complaint.
It Is probablo that tho pair will bu taken
back to Portland on a requisition.
So far no known Truo Johnson wn3 novor

Bho has mndo her homo hero for yenrs,
Last spring she nnd Woods were nrrested on
