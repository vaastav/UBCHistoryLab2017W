There were 500 persons on the stand when

aroo and bowed In recognition of the tu
mult of applause which greeted him. He
said, in part:
However men may differ about the invasion
of thn South African Republic, all are afmd
that U rwtoration of paacs is. In the highast
!gre. drflrable. Tre are but two ways in
which the war can be tcrmlnatt-1-elther th
Boers most surrender or the Ecelish Goiemrarat
must abandon lb attempt to subdue them. It
is quIU general! assumed that the resistance of
tse Boers caanot be sucresoful. and If this be
true, they would not be justified la contlnuiag the
struggle which Involves the fruitless loss of life
and waste of property even thoush the losses
inHicted on their enemy were tenfold greater
than what they suffered themselves lor blood
shed, which Is useless. Is always indefensible.
ln.t is It true that the resistance of the Boers
Is hopeless? Since the fall of Pretoria. It cer
tainly has not been fruitless: It baa been Jus
tified by most Important results. iora Salisbury's
position that nothing hat absolute surrender
would be considered has been abandoned, and
to-day the Burghers could securs almost any
terms abort of complete and explicit acknowl
edgment of tcelr independence.
Boers' Causae Jtot Heeless.
Aa their resistance has sot been fruitless,
neither is their strasSi fur ladcpendeuos hope
less. On the contrary. If tcelr resistance be pro
longed for a tew months, the abandonment by
Oreat Britain of the straggle to subdue them is
inevitable.
This statement 1 act based on any special In
formation concerning the war. but on the con
viction that It will be impossible for the Govern.
ment to secure the passage of many more war
appropriations through the House of Commons.
The last budget was ussasrt only after Immense
difficulties. All sources of ts ration nave prac
tically been exhausted and the attempt to effect
another large war loan would result In. such a
fall In tie pnee of consols as would seriously
joDardrse- British ladusutes.
If. then, the Boer forces can bold the field a
little longer, the attempt to subdue the Repub
lic must be abandoned for lack of means to
pursue It.
The capacity of tbe Boers to maintain the
struggle Is placed beyond a doubt by tin bar
barity of the methods employed to subdue them.
The ngllsb Govemmenr. cannot avoid sinmorUxur
the women and children mad homeless by the
destruction of the farms. With ta support
of his women and chlleren Imposed upon Eng

capture abundant supplies of food and arms from
the English forces His reputation tor humanity
and courage make the bagUsa soldier prefer
surrendering to facing his rifle.

Nothing can be clearer than that the reauKsaos

being consistent with lattice. It is In tbe Interest

England, aa well aa the rest of tb world, will

Tbe pretence that tbe existence of these Re
publics endangered British authority over the

slderatloo. If Republics and monarchist author
ity are to hostile that then- proximity Involves
conflict between them, this country would be
Justified In annexing Canada a a necessary

Sheriff Henry Broughton of Bell County,
where Howard lived under the protection

arrest of Howard until after the recent
election. Mr. Slasher, his brother-in-law
and deputy, wanted to undertake the arrest
of Howard and Broughton consented.
A man named Rice, a neighbor of How
ard's, on Straight Creek, was selected to
keep them posted as to Howard's move
ments. Yesterday Rice came to Broughton's
office and said he had sent his son to see
Howard about a cow trade, and that How
and would be at his house that afternoon.
Deputies Smith and Slusher, with two
other men. went immediately to the vicini

Washington. Dec. 8. The only measure of
Imnortance which the Senate ha on its
calendar for the present week Is the new
Hay-Pauncefote treaty, making provision
for the abrcgatlon of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty and opening the way for the unob
structed construction of an Isthmian canal
by the United States. Acting for the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations. Senator Lodge
w'll ask the Senate to go Into executive ses
sion to-morrow for the consideration of the
treaty, and each day thereafter until the
convention is disposed of.
HatUscattlon Seem Certain.
It can be said that at this time the pros
pect is very strong that the treaty will be
ratified, and it now looks as if this result
would be secured after comparatively little
delay. There will be some debate and some
features of the document will be criticised
as undesirable, but there is no probability
of captious opposition. The criticism vclll be
along the lines indicated by Senators Money
and Bacon In the Committee on Foreign
Relations at its meeting on Friday last.
No Senator thus far. Jjowever. has shown
a disposition to carry his objections to the
point of ultimate effort to defeat ratifica
tion. The principal authors of the criticism
of the treaty are Southern Senators, who
are, generally, very anxious for the con
struction of the canal. They find that all
canal legislation will be tied up until action
can be secured on the treaty, and they are.
on this account. Iess liable than they other
wise would be. to do anything to delay ac
tion upon tbe treaty itself. The most active
friends of the treaty now claim that ratifi
cation will be secured during tbe present
week, and the opinion Is very general that
ratification will be obtained before the
Christmas holidays.
Reciprocity to Go Over.
Beyond the consideration of the treaty
very little business will be undertaken be
fore the holidays. It Is now generally
agreed that the queion of reciprocity will
go over until January, probably without so
much as being mentioned, and It may be
added that from being for a time the sub
ject most likely to attract early attention
It has taken a position among the matters
which will not be vigorously urged.
When the reciprocity treaties do come up
for consideration there will be persistent op
position to the agreement with France and
to that with Great Britain covering the
Wet Indies. There, Is not so much feeling
oer the conventions 'With the South Ameri
cans Republics. The present outlook also is
against any immediate action in the Senate
looking to tariff legislation for the Philip
pines, and there are some indications that
the Senate will wait npen the House of
Representatives In this matter. Probably
the Chinese exclusion act will be reported
from the committee during the week.
The nomination of Attorney General Knox
will be reported at the-first executive ses
sion, but Immediate comlrmarlon probably
will be antagonized by some Senators.
PHiupmre tahifb .cestiow.
Washington. Dec S. The; House this week
probably will pass a measure to meet the
situation created by "the Philippine decision
of the Supreme Court last Monday.
Up to the present time, however, the Re
publican members of the Wiji and Means
Ccmittee have not decided upon the char
acter of the measure which will be reported.
A difference of opinion exists as to wheth
er there should be a temporary enactment
of the Dingley rates on goods entering the
United States from the Philippines, or
whether a permanent scheme of tariff legis
lation for the islands should be prepared
It is understood that Mr. Payne, chairman
of the committee, and Mr. Dalzell. favor
the latter course. The Republican members
of the committee will meet again to-morrow.
Of course. If It Is decided to enact a
temporary measure, the proceedure will be
exceedingly simple, and it probably can be
passed In a da. If. on the other band, an
entire scheme of tariff legislation is to be
enacted more time will be consumed both

CANAL REPORT WAS UNANIMOUS
Nicaragnan Route Decided to Be
the Most Feasible.
REPCBUC SPEC3AU
Washington. Dec 8. Examination or the
report of the Isthmian Canal Commission
which was sent to Congress last week
shows that It i a unanimous report, signed
by every one of the nine members of the
commission. There Is no minority report,
despite the reiterated assertions that one
member, Geo. S. Morrison, had differed with
his colleagues to the extent of recommend
ing the adoption of the Panama. 'Canal
route. As It reached Congress, the report la
unanimous In Its indorsement of the Xica-ragt-an
route as the "most feasible" upon
which the United States can construct tbe
great interoceanic waterway.
This discovery is the more surprising. In
iew of the fact that the text of the so
called "minority report" signed by Mr. Mor
rison has been published and accepted as a
fact by the press of the country.
Mr. Morrison, from an engineering and
physical standpoint, strongly preferred the
Panama Canal route to that projected
across the Territory of Coeta Rica and
Nicaragua. He put his views into writing
last August and had the assurance of the
support of more than one other member
of the commission.
Rear Admiral Walker, chairman of the
commission, however, has been unable to
get M. Huiln. president of the Panama
Canal Company to make any definite propo
sition for the sale of his property. He
stated several times that the present value
Is placed at tlOs.OOO.OOO. but no sale price
was obtainable, aitnougn Aumuai
notified him that If by No ember a a price
was not set he would thereafter be disre
garded. This brought forth a reply from M.
Hutln. again asserting that the "prMf"1
value of the Panama Canal Is Sluf.OOO.OW.
All of the Commissioners were, in town
for their final meeting, and they were sur
prised to have M. Hutln come before them
and protest against the construction placed
upon hi letter. He claimed that he did not
intend I.WM0 to be taken as his final
price, and when he was confronted with
Admiral Walker's letter, to which Ms note
naming these figures was a i response., he be
came greatly excited, claimed that he wa
being unjustly treated, that he had not been
given time enough, and actually threatened
to go over the heads of the Commissioners
to the Secretary of State and President
Roosevelt and lodge a complaint against
wbst be termed their sumtnary action. -
Mr. Morrison then abandoned hia intention

LABOI FEDERATION
WORKED ON SUNDAY.
Majority of the Committees Organ
ized and Laid Plans for
Work To-Dav.
Beranton. Fa.. Dec . Many delegates to
the convention of the American Federation
of Labor devoted the day to the transaction
of committee business. A majority of the
committees organised, and not a few .of
them took up questions that will engage tbe
attention of the convention during the coming-
week.
The executive council, which is composed
of the president, the six vice presidents, the
secretary and the Ueasuier. of the Federa
tion, went into session early and did not
adjourn until long after noon. The session
was secret and nothing- was given out for
publication.
TheJfetal Trade.Fedratlon. embracing-all
kinds of metal trades, held another meet
Inf this afternoon and ills, n il plans for
perfecting the organization. Nine of the
fifteen eligible metal trades unions In the
United States .were represented.
The American Federation of Labor Con
vention win remain m session for the next
six days, and will have a'rery busy week.
Two hundred resolutions, touching upon
nearly every question in the labor world,
have been presented for action.
What Is looked upon by many of the dele
gates as the most vital question that will
come before the convention is that of trade
autonomy: The brewery workmen and the
mine workers delegates probably will be
the storm center on this question. Both of
these trade unions want Industrial autono
mythat Is. they advocate that all trade
In one Industrial establishment should form,
one organisation for the better advancement
of tbe condition of all. They also announce
that ther will oppose trade autonomy to
the bitter end- The miners. In their argu
ment, say that if a handful of engineers
or firemen employed In a mine should strike
It would cause the mine to be closed thus
throwing out of work hundreds of men who
may have no grievance. If all trades in the
mine were united under one neaa. ine miua
workers say. much friction could be avoid
ed. Thoe who advocate trade autonomy
claim It would be fatal for them to enter
such a combination, and that no good result
could come from an amalgamation of that
The matter of trade jurisdiction is also
expected to cause a long discussion, par-.
.im,i..iv nn tfte n.irt of the woodworkers.
who make the point that tradesmen such as
planomakers are woodworkers and should
come Into the tatter's union, instead of having-an
Independent organization.
Nearly a dozen resolutions on the matter
of the exclusion of the Mongolian race
from the United States and Island pos
sessions are in the hands of a special com
mittee. This committee probably will re
port one resolution embodvtng the good
points of all of them..
At this time it seems reasonably certain
that all the preent officers of the federa
tion will be re-elected. There Is a JoY
ment on foot to Increase the number of vice
presidents frcm six to seven or eight, but
It Is not likely that this will be accom-

ARBITRATION IS COMPULSORY.
New Sonth Wales Adopts Measure
to Settle Labor Disputes.
Sydne. New South Wales. Dec. . By the

putes Is to be presided over .by a Judge of

tensive powers. Including; the power to de-.
clare a standard wage and to direct that,
other things being equal, an employer shall
give preference to union over nonunion la
borers. There la no appeal from the deci
sions of this court.
