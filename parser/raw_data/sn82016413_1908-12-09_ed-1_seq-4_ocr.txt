lesson for some of tho lUtlo big meu
of this Territory, it there be any
such. t
First let It bo noted that tho mes
sage was written nnd ready to go to
the printer many weeks before It was
delivered. And the President Is a
very busy man.
Tho reports of heads of Depart
ments were Issued on time. In the

In the nssertlon that tho history of
this Territory has been regularly
punctuated with exeftses from heads
of departments for not having their
reports out on time for presentation
to the Legislature.
And when the newspapers havo
tried to secure an udvanco copy of
the messago of our Governor to the
Territorial Legislature, that Impor
tunt state document has been guard'
ed with moro tender care than the
Message of tbo President of the Unit
ed States.
Ilousevelt has considered himself
entirely safe in sending out udvanco
copies of his message to be held In
confidence till formally presented.
Koosovelt not only felt that his mes
sage was safe as a confidential mat
ter in the hands of mainland news
papers, but also allowed It to be sent
to the Associated Press papers of tho
city of Honolulu.
Strange to Territorial officers, but
true.
Tho present Territorial Adminis
tration has not yet had the opportu
nity to show whether It Intends to
bo so narrow and pcanutty as Its
predecessors In handling "state pa
pers." We commend the example of the
Federal Administration to Frcar's
