The President's Message.
The president's message follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives- The people of this country continue
to enioy great prosperity. Undoubt
edly there will be ebb and flow such
prosperity, and this ebb and flow will
be felt more or less by all members
of the community, both by the deserv
ing and the undeserving. Against the
Wrath of the Lord the wisdom of man
cannot avail in ties of flood or
drought human ingenuity can but par
tially repair the disaster. A general
failure of crops would hurt all of us.
Again, if the folly of man mars the
eneral well-being, then those who are
nnocent of the folly will have to pay
part of the penalty incurred by those
who are guilty of the folly. A panic
brought on by the speculative folly of
part of the business community would
hurt the whole business community. But
such stoppage of welfare, tho it might
be severe, would not be lasting. In the
long run the one vital factor in the per
manent prosperity of the country is the
high individual character of the average
American worker, the average Amer
ican citizen, no matter whether his work
be mental or manual, whether he be

National House May Settle Ap
propriation Bill Before Com
mittees Are Named.
By W. W. Jermane.
Washington, Dec. 5.In all probabili
ty the Panama canal appropriation bill,
which must be enacted by Dec. 15, if the
credit of the government is to be main
tained, will be considered in the house
of representatives this week, either by
unanimous consnt or by special rule, in
advance of the appointment the house
standing committees. This course is
highly necessary in view of the likeli
hood that the speaker will "mot be
rtady to announce his committees next
week.
In such a disposal of the bill as is
here suggested the speaker will prevent
a clash of committee jurisdiction. The
Panama bill carries an appropriation,
and ought, therefore, to go to the appro
priations committee, but it also takes up
questions that clearly fall under the
jurisdiction of the interstate and for
eign' commerce committee. If these
committees were in existence, each
would claim the bill and the speaker
mgiht have some trouble in satisfying
them.
Said a leading house republican this
morning- If John Sharp Williams is
expeditious in his work of making up
the minority representation on standing
committees, those committees ought to
be announced by the iddle of next
week.''
From other sources it is learned that
Spe&ker Cannon is practically ready
now to name the republican members
of the standing committees. The only
committee as yet incoplete on the re
publican side is the comittee on appro
priations. Tawney will be its chairman
but the speaker is undecided as to how
to fill several junior vacancies. Numer
ous applications are being ^considered,
but none from the northwest.

thousands of bellowing cattle, there are
seven buffaloes, almost the last of their

buffaloes arrived yesterday and are on
the market like common beeves, to be
sold to the highest bidder.
The former kings of the prairies were
consigned by the Empire State Cattle
company of Pierre, S. D., and they were
not sold yesterday. Four hundred dol

are expected to bring, which would
make the price of a real good buffalo

New York, Dec. 5.Frequent men
tion has been made of some of the pres
ents given recently at the marriage of
sNathaniel Moore of Chicago and Miss
Fargo in New York, but there was one
that has escaped notice. That was a
check for $250,000 given to the young
bridegroom by his father, James Hobart
Moore, one o'f the "big four" in* the
Rock Island road and prominent as a
promoter of industrial consolidations.
This is the second big check Mr. Moore
has given his son within a compara
tively short time. When the young
man attained his majority last year his
father made him a present of a check of
$100,000. What he has left of the first
check, added to the quarter of a million'
he received as a wedding gift, ought
to make a tidy sum on which to start
light housekeeping.

THE RETOGE OR
"A NEWSPAPER
Sheriff Ward Sfl.ys Observance of
Law in Crawford Hanging
Caused "Roast."
Sheriff E. L. Ward of Elk River ar
rived in Minneapolis shortly after noon
today on his way to dejiver the Craw
ford death warrant to the governor at
St. Paul. When asked about the ac
cusations made in -the Tribune this
morning against his manner of conduct
ing the execution of C. D. Crawford
the boxcar murderer,-he said:
I don't like to dignify all this slush
that ha* been printed by answering it
but my friends in Elk River think the
ufelic is entitled to a statement ant3
have decided to,make one. In the
first place, the execution was conducted
in strict accordance with the law. One
of tho principal provisions of the state
law is that no newspaper reporters are
to be admitted. Acting under this law,
I refused to admit any newspaper men
"Among those who applied to me
was one Butman of the Tribune. I
told him I had no power to admit him
He said: I have got-'to go in and see
that execution.' Still I refused. At
last he said: 'If you don't let me in
you will get the worst of it in tomor
row morning's paper.' 'All right,' I
said. 'Go ahead. I can't let you in.'
The mass of misrepresentations in this
morning's Tribune was the result.
I did not faint and have someone lse
pull the trap. I did it myself and with
a reasonable amount of coolness, too.
I did not refuse to admit the three wit
nesses named by Crawford under the
law. He selected his three men and all
of them were present. They were:
Deputy Sheriff Connelly of Sauk Cen
ter, Sheriff Tanner of Little Falls and
Dr. Hubbard of St. Cloud. Crawford
did not ask to have Ids attorney E. S.
Cary, admitted, but I told Cary he
could come in if ha wanted to, but I
could not admit any of his friends. He
refused to come in, bnt stayed 6utside
and tried to make all the trouble he
could. We had a hard time keeping the
crowd back. One reporter forced his
way in and we had to throw him out.
In short, we observed the law faithful
ly, but we had a hard time doing it."
Sheriff Ward believes that many of
the moves made in the Crawford case
were part of a'plan to issue a book de
scribing the whole affair. He says that
such a publication would be demoral
izmg and altogether unfortunate.
A SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION
Crawford Goes to His Death Without
Faltering.
Special to The Journal.
Elk River, Minn., Dec. 5."Qood-by
boys am sorry for this action of
mine.''
These were the last words spoken by
C. D. Crawford, the murderer of Heme
Lundeen. A moment later the trap
was sprung and his emotionless body
was .danjgMnjr pi&mAher end of the rape
beneath ifte se1i|*m.
Calm to the?^ut, Crawford walked
up the stefMMtf .'fhe fallows without as
sistance. He surveyed the forty per
sons present without a sign of tremor,
and in the three minutes" work of ad
justing the noose he stood before the
priest reciting prayers. When .the last
moment had come he made his brief
farewell.
The trap was sprung at 1.48. Eleven
minutes later the dead body was cut
down and carried into the jail. It will
be buried by the Catholic church here.
The last scenes at the jail were
marked by the first sign df a break
down by the prisoner. He was told of
the woman in Minneapolis who, the
officials firmly believe, is his mother.
Then Crawford cried. His long-re
strained feelings gave way* to bitter
tears. Later he recovered his spirits
and talked with the sheriff.
The prisoner arrived here with his
guard about 6 o'clock last evening,
driving to the jail in a closed carriage.

IN CONFERENCE
Archbishop Ireland Visits Bishop
McQuaid in His Eastern
Home.
Archbishop Ireland is in Rochester,
N. Y.. as the guest of Bishop McQuaid,
anu tne visit is regarded in the^ east as
of particular significance. It is taken
as an indication of a coming together of
the liberal and conservative wings of
the church in' America, as the archbish
op and bishop now together, have been
looked upon as representative of these
elements of the church.
Archbishop Ireland has been inspect
ing St. Bernard's seminary at Rochester
as the guest of Bishop McQuaid, and in
commenting upon* the visit, the
Rochester Herald says:
"This visit has nyr significance
than would appear on the face of dt, as
it may be regarded as a union of the
"conservative" and "liberal" wings
of the Catholic hierarchy in America.
At one time 'the consecrated blizzard
of the northwest,' as the archbishop of
St. Paul was once called by Archbishop
Ryan, at a banquet in Baltimore, was
regarded as the leader of the 'liberal
wing/ while Bishop McQuaid, who is
now entertaining him, was classed as
the leader of the 'conservatives.'
"Abbe Felix Klein, of the Catholic
University of Paris, so described him in
his recently published book on America,
entitled, "The Land of the Strenuous
Life.' Today's visit is an indication
that this condition has passed and that
each leader recognizes the need for co
operation in work dear to each of theit
heartsthe training of stude'tfts for the
Catholic priesthood."

the prison plant has been a serious thorn
in the flesh. Prices will be made lower
than the sisal and manilla twine sold by

Madison, Wis., Dec. 5.Governor R.
M. Lafollette, at the close of his mes
sage, formally announced that some
time in the course of this special ses
sion, or at least at its close, he would
resign as governor and accept the com
mission as United States senator. The
governor's statement is as follows:
"Upon the 25th day of January last
you elected me the representative of
Wisconsin in the United States senate.
I was then, and while I live I shall
continue to be profoundly grateful for
the great honor which you conferred
upon me, but certain fixed obligations
bound me to continue as governor, as
laws involving millions of dollars were
being challenged in the courts and legis
lation vital to the state was pending.
I could not in good cbnscience offer
more than a qualified acceptance.
''The close of the sesion found the
litigation undecided and the new laws
untried. Adverse decisions in the cir
cuit court might call promptly for cura
tive legislation and the administration
of the new laws might disclose defects
requiring immediate remedies. Every
reason made it a plain duty to await
the circuit court decision and the con
test over the new laws.
Justified by Time.
"Time has entirely justified this
course. The attitude of the railroads in
contesting every assessment of taxes
as soon as made, the construction which
modifications of this law seem to de
mand, the amendment needed for the
better administration of the railway
rate law, the amendments of the pri
mary election law and the other im
portant matters for your consideration
are all required to round the work of
legislat-iure,
"In advancing this great reform
movement, the contest for representa
tive government in Wisconsin is not
ended. To protect and preserve all that
has been gained by this protracted
struggle will require the combined ef
forts and the continued vigilance of
the patriotic citizenship of the state.
"We have another responsibility in
the influence which this state exercises
upon the country at large. We cannot
halt or turn back without bringing dis-
aBter to our own state and discouraging

Mutual Reserve Company Gave
a Man $15,000 to Quiet
Him.
New York, Dec. 5.George D.J
Eldredge, vice president of the Mutual
Reserve Life Insurance company, testi
fied before the insurance investigation
committee today that the Mutual Re
serve paid $15,000 to a Mr. McDonald
of Philadelphia in 1899, to avoid a suit
by policyholders to oust Frederick A.
Burnham from the presidency of the
Mutual Reserve company.
Yesterday's session o the Armstrong
investigating committee developed:
That Horace H. Brockway, a director
of the Mutual Reserve Fund Life asso
ciation, was placed on the payroll of the
company at a salary of $300 a week in
March, 1898, and that the services he
rendered thereafter were practically the
same as those he had always given as a
director of the company.
That two months after being placed
on the payroll President Frederick A.
Burnham called Brockway into his of
fice and said to him: "You are earn
img a good salary and I want you to.
Sve$6,000
mjk $6,000. Brockway gave fiim
in currency. He declared he
did not know why Burnham wanted the
money or to what use he put it.
That President Frederick A. Burn
ham, who was wanted as a witness to
tell about the money he got from Brock
way and about the alleged payment in
May, 1898, of $40,000 to Lou Payn, then
superintendent ox insurance, has joined
the army of sick and disabled insurance
officers. Mr. Burnham sent his physi
cian, who declared the president of the
Mutual Reserve was too ill even to sub
mit to an examination at his own resi
dence.
That George D. Eldridge, vioe presi
dent* of the Mutual Reserve, frequently
