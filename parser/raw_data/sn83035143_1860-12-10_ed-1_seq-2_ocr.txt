Fully Committed.
Tb Telf graph intormi ua that President
Buchanan "tipliciUy ei pressed hU determi
atton to aeod DO mora troopi to lha forts
hmt Charleston, and imd ererything possible
would be done on his part to avoid a collis
ion." This is committing bimwlf to the
cause of the secessionists boldly and fully.
It Is well understood by him, as it Is by all
at Washington, that it is designed to take Fort
Moultrie by force, as soon as secession is de
clared on the lTth Inst., and yet the President
wilfully ignores this fact and declares that
he will do ererylhicg in his power to aroiJ a
collision. Perhaps, in his thorough devo
tion to Southern demands, he will direct the
commandant of that Fort to surrender at the
first demand, "to avoid a collision." In his
lCeemge he says that the resignation of the
Federal lUrshals, Judges, Ac, in South Caro
lina hns left him powerless to enforce the
Uwi ; and now to complete the subjugation ot
the General Government, he proposes, coolly
and deliberately, to allow the last sign of
Federal power in that rebellious State, to be
seised by the revolutionists, without raising a
hand to sustain that Constitution, and those
laws, which he has sworn to support. How
much further out base subserviency to the
South, and a total lack of moral courage, car
ry him T As has been remarked, his white
hairs are turning to feathers.
Mr. Lincoln's Views.
The New York Herald calls upon Mr. Lin
coln for a "generous Union speech" to "quiet
the troubled waters, and save the ship." But
what possible good will that do? South Car
olina and the secessionists will not wait to
see what Mr. Lincoln will do,' and till procla
mations by him would be of no avail to
quiet the turbulent waves ot southernanati
cism. They will not wait to see what the
principles of the incoming administration are
to be, lest it should prove so calm and sensi
ble as to disarm them of all pretext for dis
union. They have reached the crisis for
which they have long sought, when they can
fulfil their oft repeated threat of disolution;
and what they dread net of aU, is such a
settlement as will tend to quiet the present
agitation. Hence, the South Carolina and
Florida representatives refuse to serve on the
conciliatory committee, and wish fur nothing
10 much as immediate revolution and bloodshed.
Tender of a Maryland Regiment.
A dispatch from Columbia, S. C, a few
days ago, announced that Gov. Gist bad re
ceived an offer from Baltimore of the services
of a regiment of Maryland troops, under
charge of Philip Henry Lee. The Baltimore
Patriot says that no such major or regiment
belongs in the City.
Failure of Water in New York.
On Thursday morning last, two mains of
the Croton Aqueduct burst in Fifth Avenue,
Kew York city. The street was flooded and
torn up, and all the central and lower parts
of the city were deprived of their usual al
lowance of water. The greatest inconven
ience resulted from the stoppage, and great
fears were entertained of a destructive confla
gration. Factories worked by steam had to
suspend operations ; hotels were without ma
terials for baths and washing; private fami
lies had, for the time, to gather around the
breakfast table with unwashed hands and
faces, and saloons charged more for a glass of
water than for a glass of beer. The few
pumps which still exist as old relics of the
days of wells, were surrouaded by eager
crowds with pails, tubs, barrels and tin pans,
who, under the direction of policemen, formed
in line, and patiently or impatiently, waited
for " turns" at the pump handle. The steam
presses of newspapers were kept in operation
by water brought from Brooklyn, and proba
bly at no former period were so many prayers
ant up for rain, as during the two days re
quired to repair damages. The entire police
fjree was detailed to keep strict watch on all
portions sf the city, as a preventative meas
ure against fire, and alt New York breathed
easier when they again saw the clear stream
running from the faucets.
The Kansas Troubles.
Wyandotte (Kansas) Commercial zette
thus comments upon the letter of
Jndge Williams, which that worthy wrote
when he was flying from Kansas to Missouri :
"A more wicked and cowardly string of
lies ccnld hardly be crowded into the Bame
space, even by the most ingenious falsifier in
the whole list of Buchanans omce bonders;
and when w. say that, we consider that we
have made the case as strong as it can be
made.
Judge Williams, in Clinton, Missouri, "to
inform the citixens of this that place of the
following tacts." A pretty Judge, indeed, to
inform the people of the "following facta,
when the statements which follow are not
facts. They are for the most part, if not en
tirely, willful, malicious, and cowardly false
hoods.
Instead of "the Abolitionists under com
mand of Montgomery and Dr. Jennison, to
the number of from 300 to 500, armed with
Sharp's rifles, dragoon sabres, navy revolvers
and bowie knives, having commenced a war
of extreme ferocity on the law-abiding citiz
ens ot Southern Kansas," there has only
been a small party of men in the field at all,
numbering, we are assured by reliable par
ties direct from tee scene of the difficulties,
not over thirty at the most, and they have
not meddled with "law-abiding citizens,"
but have only administered merited punish
ment to three or four kidnappers and mid
night assassins, who would now be commit
ting depredations on society for all of any
check likely to be put upon them by Judge
Williams' Court, or Fort Scott packed juries.
And what is more, instead ot" Montgomery
being at the head of them, he has been
quietly about his business at home all the
time.
The fact is, Judge Williams ran away from
his post of duty, at Ft Scott, over into Mis
souri, and there told a terrible story of devas
tation and slaughter, which bad little other
foundation than his own cowardly imagin
ings. And thit story with others of the same
baseless foundation, has formed the ground
work of most wanton and wicked attacks
upon Montgomery, who, for all that be hs
yet done, is a far better man than ever Bu
chanan had honesty and decency enough to
appoint as a Judge in this ruffian -beridden
Territory."
During the late storm, according to the
reports by telegraph and otherwise, thirty-six
Teasels hare gone ashore on Lake Ontario,
seventeen on Lake Erie, two on Lake Huron,
and six or esren cn Lake Michigan. Three
propellers have been totally destroyed, and
two with a large loss of life. Three or four
sail Teasels have also been totally lost ; and
the Ion of men is orer Rventy. K , c ,
Affairs at Washington.
The dispatches to the Kew York pajivrs
say that only Boyoa of South Jarolina, and
Hawkins of Florida, will resign on the Con
ciliatory Committee. Pavis, of Mississippi,
Love of Georgia, anl Uueston, of Alabama,
will serve, although great efforts h.ive been
made by people Irom their States to Induce
them to resign.
An effort will be made to-day to present
the People's Pacific Railroad to Congress..
The Republican Representatives and Sen
ators are in receipt of anonymous Utters
threatening them with personal injury. Such
schemes are the hut report of ruffians.
The Union sentiments of Cochrane in the
House and Saulabury in the Senate, drew
hearty applause from the galleries; last year
the disunion sentiments were mostly ap
plauded. Secretary Cass will shortly give to the pub
lic his views of the political conditiou ot the
couutry.
Two millions of dollars will be wanted
January 1st to pay the interest on the public
debt There la not that amount iu the Treas
ury, and a bill will probably be rejiorted to
day, authorizing the issue of ten miliums of
Treasury notes.
Hope for relief is grounded apon the an
ticipated changes in the Cabinet Mr. Holt,
P. M. General, will take the place of Secre
tary Cobb, and Mr. Fessenden, of the Finance
Committee, will succeed Mr. ' Hunter, the
present Chairman. The passage of the Mor
rell Tariff Bill is expected after these changes,
and brighter times are looked tor.
The correspondent of the Cincinnati Com
mercial, telegraphs that Seward, Cor win,
Sherman, Wade, all the Republicans. and Doug
las and his friends, assume boldly that the
idea of the Right of Secession shall never be
admitted in any event, and men of stamini
take ground that, it necessary, steel and lead
shall be the ultimatum.
NORTHERN FIRMNESS.
Yon would be surprised at Northern stern
ness. Many Southern men are deluded with
the chimera that, if Government attempt to
coerce the South, revolution will ensue in
New lork and other Northern cities; but are
surprised at the firm demeanor of Republi
cans. They begin to manifest serious anxiety
to kuow whether the North will meet the
shock bravely. There seems yet to be no
traitors in the North.
BUCHANAN'S COURAGE.
It is considered not unlikely that the Presi
dent's courage may be terribly tried before
New rears, as his intimation in bis Message
that revenue laws must be enforced at
Charleston, will be pressed home on him by
the North. Senator Douglas is bold, and
for the Union.
JERRY BLACK.
Southern men have ruined Jerry Black's
prospects for a seat on the Supreme Court
Bench. They accuse him of penning offen
sive portions of the message, and if the
President should appoint him the south will
oppose, and rejection would follow. Doug
las' friends are in ecstacies.
FORT MOULTRIE.
Fort Moultrie is garrisoned by ninety men,
Eentuckians, and Col. Anderson will die by
the flag of the Union sooner than yield to any
public enemy. South Carolina members say
that their Slate will not assault the Fort
Their Commissioners appointed by State Con
vention will apply to the Federal Executive
for peaceful arrangement and adjustment of
financial matters after secession.
A TENNESSEEAN'S VIEW.
Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee Union
men were storming about the "insulting ' de
meanor of South Carolina and denounced
disunion as superlative folly. . "What," said
a Tennesseean, "shall Tennessee be dragged
into this folly by South Carolina? We are
a prosperous and happy people. Our nig
gers are under better subjection, and are bap
pier than they ever were. We've got a good
trade with the North and South, and does
South Carolina imagine we are such infernal
fools as to impoverish ourselves to gratify her
whims? Wkar'i the danger to our niggers?
Whose agoing to run 'em off? The most in
fernal nonsense ever heard of!" And a Vir
ginia planter in a similar state of mind, rav
ed up and down Pennsylvania Avenue,swear
ing be "would shoulder a musket and
march down with Virginia troops and wipe
out South Carolina, if she didn't stop her cus
sed folly. He went on to say that seces
sion has already reduced the value ot nigger
fitty percent
HOW CONGRESSMAN TALK.
Senator Trumbull will not confess that se
cession is likely, excepting perhaps in the
case of South Carolina, she being lnnatic,and
therefore an exception to aU laws. He says
there is a flurry, it will blow over. Senator
Wade recognizes the facts, is ready to treat
them as facts, and Fays the North has nothing
to do but proceed as she ever has. 1
Senator Seward's position is in dispute.
The logic of his career has a duplex interpre
tion. One party says he will yield too much
to the Soutbnotwithstanding his "irrepressi
ble" speeches. Thurlow Weed's recessive ar
ticles confirm this impression, because his in
timacy with Seward seems to indicate that they
are acting in concert,and that the utterances of
the Albany Evening Journal are the echoes of
Seward's views. Another party vigorously
denies Seward's complicity with Weed's re
cession, and contend that he will, as usual,
lead the Republicans in the line of rigid prin
ciple. But a general impression obtains that
he will assume the role of pacificator. Sum
ner will remain quiet nntil the Republicans
agree generally to define. But all of the
Republicans are for the Union as it is. While
all ot them would readily consent to the re
peal of Northern Personal Liberty laws, if
the South will first withdraw her challenge,
not one, no t not on of them, flinches from
the Republican doctrine against extension of
slavery into territories. But mark again
they seem unanimout againtt Congreieional
legislation on the subject of slavery reelecting
the terriioriet. They are content to abide the
natural laws of labor, to work out the great
anti-slavery principle, and they are falling
fiat on Governor Chase's idea of Popular
Sovereignty.
Now for Southern gentlemen. Senator
Hemphill of Texas, is strong for the Union.
His colleague, Wigfall, is plump against it
Mason of Virginia, is a Secessionist His
great colleague, Hunter, is rather for the
Union, and tremendous efforts are making by
Virginia planters to made bim altogether for
the Union, but they are embarrassed by the
attitude of the B&ltimoreacs.. ; Here, by-the-bye,
I am reminded of a new element which
is likely to be brought to bear in behalf of
the Union fight. . The Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad interests are deeply involved, and at
the proper time, it is suggested that corpora
tion will engage in the struggle. Johnston
of Tennessee, is set down for the Union. ' The
position of Senator Powell of Kentucky, has
not been the subject of discussion. He will
probably be for the Union, while Mr. Breck
inridge is. Everybody knows wbera the
Mississippi Senators stand. Clingman of N.
C, is slightly for secession. Green and Polk,
of Missouri, are for the Union, and so are the
Representatives from that State. All the
Kentucky and Tennessee Representatives, J
believe, are on the same side. Hill of Geor
gia, talks earnestly for the Union. The po
litical and pecuniary salvation of Botteler
(of Va.) and his people, place him on the side
of the Union.
Ji3 Many unsuccessful attempts have been
made to obtain a perfect substitute for whale
bone, in the manufacture of the ribs ol umbre
llas and parasols. An ingenus manufacturer
has at last found that white oak timber of the
second growth, when selected from the butt
end of the tree, and straight and tree from
knobs, may, after subjection to a certain
curing process, be employed as a substi
tute for whalebone. It is even said to be sup
erior to whalebone in toughness and tenacity,
and the ribs made from it always resume their
original straight condition after exposure to
the. weather.
From the N. Y. Independent.
South Carolina and Secession.
South ('arulinu fell into a 8l:ilu of lirnuie
idiocy on the subject of secession about thir
ty years ago, and has continued ever since in
a conditiou or hopeless imbecility. Her caw
is beyond any other treatment tnan that of a
strait-jacket, aud a rigid diet of bread anil
walur.. She Is perfectly iu earnest in her ra -Tiug,and
is determined t j go into the cold and
starve, or to break things lu pieces In a dread
ful mai ner if she is prevented. When htr
condition is thus rightfully apprcheuded, it
will all i be seen that she is only dangerous
so long as she is kept iuside, and not permit
ted to have her own way. Let her go; a
large black m in, bigger than herself, stands
ready to receive her with a strait-jacket the
moment she crosses the threshold, and tree
trade and direct taxation are a diet that will
bring the blood anay from he.- brain and re
duce her system to that condition that she
may by-aud-by, in Uud's good time, recover
her reason. If she is determined to rid the
rest of the family of her presence, they will
be delivered from a very pestilent and noisy
member, wh, tor more than a quarter of a
ceutury, has done no'hing but break the peace
of the whole household.
Now if this be a true statement of her case,
and it certainly is, why should any threat of
the secession of such a State disturb the com
merce of tho whole country ? South Caroli
na contains about as many white people as
the city of Brooklyn, probnbly does not con
tain so much wealth, certaiuiy has not so
much intelligence, and is not of more conse
quence to the Union we mea" no disresect
to Brooklyn thuu that ci'y. Undoubtedly
she has some foreign commerce and some do
mestic trade, but Its penentnse noon the
whole trade and commerce ot the country is
so small, that its loss would hardly be fell,
should she be cut loose from ber sister States,
towed out into the Gulf Stream, and anchor
ed to a raft, to drift for evermore from zone
to zone. We are exaggerating nothing, and
setting down naught in malice. The industry
ot a Stale coutainingonly about 275,000 white
people, supported by 375,000 black people,
who are fed upon three pounds of bad bacon
and a peck of corn a week, and whose entire
clothing does not cost $10 a year each, can
not by any possibility, even we had no statis
tics to verity the fact, be of any great moment
to a great, flourishing, and energetic nation
of 40,000,000 of people. She may go, and
the great West will produce not a bushel the
less of corn and wheat, not a pound the less
of pork and beef, not a wisp the less of hay;
and our great EasUand-West railroads will
have not a pound the less of produce to bring
to market; she may go, and not a spindle
the It as will whirl in Lowell or Lawrence;
she may go, aud not a sad the less will dot
the harbors ot the North ; ehe may go, and
not a mouth the less will be filled in all the
wide Union beside, not a dollar the less be
paid to all our millions who labor with their
heads or their bands. All this is capable of
arithmetical demonstration. In the lu ion
she does little, with her sini-ll population,
more than half of whom are unwilling pau
per laborers, while the other section are de
pendent npon these for the few necessaries
and the not many luxuries of life they are
permitted to enjoy. Out of the Union she
will d less, for all of the trade she now does
that comes to her from bordering States will
find its way to Savannah and Mobile, and the
little cotton she raises she will be glad to send
to market in the ships thai will take it quick
est and cheapest. So little reason have we
to fear ol disaster and loss to the commerce
and trade of the country from the secession
of South Carolina. It is marvelous that the
threat of such an event, such "a mere misap
prehension of danger," should so blind men
to the dictates of common sense."
Senator Hale on the Crisis.
The telegraph contained a brief abstract of
the speech of Senator John P. H t!e iu Con
gress. Below will be found one or two ex
tracts from his speech : ' 1
"Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, (Rep.j 1
was very much in hopes that there would
have been a Message that would have com
mended itself to somebody. I vas not san
guine of its pleasing myself, but I did hope
it wouid please some one, and that the Presi
dent would have looked things iu the face. I
have read it somewhat carefully, and if I un
derstand it, and I think I do, it is this: First
That South Carolina has just cause for se
ceding. Second that she has no right to se
cede. Third That we have no right to pre
vent ber seceding. That is the amount of the
Message, substam tally. Then the President
goes on to represent this as a great and pow
erful country, and that no State has a right to
secede from it; and all the power of the
country, it 1 understand the President con
sist, in what Dickens makes the English Con
stitution consist the power to do nothing.
Now, sir, I think it was incumbent on the
President of the United States to have point
ed out and recommended to Congress some
rule, and to have told us what he recommend'
ed us to do. The only way to escape the
danger is to look it in the face; and 1 think
the country did expect from the President
some exposition of decided policy.
I do not wish to say a word that would
cause irritation, or add to the feeling of bit
terness which really exists in the country.
Wot one. 1 would bear and forbear before 1
would say such a word. But I tell you the
plain truth, that the way is to look the thing
iu the face, aud see where we are. And
what is the issue that is presented, but
that the constitutional will of tho pnbhc
epinion, expressed through the forms of the
Constitution, will not be submitted to? And
if war is the alternative, let it come in any
form or in any shape. The Union is dissolv
ed, and it cannot be held together as a Union
if that is the alternative upon which we go
into an election. If it is pronounced and
determined that the vote of the majority ex
pressed through the regular constituted forms
of the Constitution will not be submitted to,
then, sir, this is not a Union of equals. It
is a Union of dictatorial oligarchy on the one
side, and a herd of slaves and cowards on the
other. That is it nothing more or less
If this discussion is proceeded with, I shall
take occasion to address myselt to that phase
of the controversy which is so constantly, per-
severingly and continually held up, that the
Northern States are the aggressors. We have
a set of presses and politicians among us who
have perverted the public voice and the pub
lic interests, ministering to a depraved appc-
tite, and they have lent their interest to as
persions and slanders on the people among
whom they live, and upon whom they feed ;
and I very much fear our friends on the other
side have listened too much to their asper
sions rather than to their own convictions
of what the trouble is.
Let me toy further, if theri art
those tcho look to the lettlement of thit con
troversy by further concetrion front the North,
I think they mistake. I think we have con
ceded too much, wo have compromised too
much, and we have got to that position of
things, whenever any fault is found, there is
the ever recurring remedy of statesmen, of
stin further concessions from the North. I
agree, sir, that under the Constitution of tho
United States, you are entitled to demand
and have an honest and fair discbarge of that
obligation which is imposed on all the States
in regard to the rendition of fugitive slaves,
and I am willing, perfectly willing, that there
shall be an honest, and fair, and laithful per
formance of that pledge. Sum up every case
of injury and suffering and aggression by the
whole North, of the free Stall's, upon the
right to recapture fugitive slaves, and put
them all down in the darkest colors, and
draw it as hideous as truth and fancy can
make it, and then I can bhow you aggres
sions on the constitutional rights ef citizens
of the free States that will infinitely out
weigh and outnumber every aggression by
the free States npon the rights of the South,
in regard to their slaves."
Senator Hale on the Crisis. Tom Jones, the Sculptor---Bust of Alfred
Kelly.
By the following from the Columbus Ga
zette it will be seen that the celebrated T. D.
Jones is about to execute a bust of the late
Alfred Kelly:
"Ton JoxKS, Till Sctxptoh. The admira
ble bust ot the Hon. Thomas Ewing, taken
by this distinguished Uhio Sculptor, now
graces many of the offices of the lawyers in
the State, the love of the beautiful, the en
couragement of art, the pride of the profess
ion, and shore all, the admiration of the
trreat niminal tending to make the work ex
ceedingly popular; and it is not at all surprU-
iii:' Una it is already uiflicult to procure a
copy, the limited supply not being sulfcient
to meet the demand. Mr. Jones has succeed
ed in giving entire satisfaction to the friends
of all the celebrated men of whose linea
ments he hns taken duplicates, and few ar
tists can boast of having had such an illus
trious array of subjects.
Clay, Chase, Corwin, Cass, ueneralj 1 ay-
lor aud Scott, Breckinridge, Archbishop
Hughes, as well as Mr. bwing, have bad
their hints taken by Mr. Jones, and all of
them have felt flattered as their striking like
nesses came finished from the master hand of
the sculptor.
After Mr. Corwin returns from Uongreas,
Mr. Jones will take another copy of that al
most inimitable face, that puts a crowd in a
roar of pleasure, so as ts consign the "Wagon
Boy" to posterity in marble.
Mr. Jones has received an order, to exe
cute a bust of the late Alfred Kelly, from a
posthumus cast, and, we trust it m.iy be as
nearly perfect as his other works, for no oth
er Ohio man has let! a deeper impression for
good, upon the public mind ot the State,than
did Mr. Kelly in his day and generation.
The bust will be finished next spring. Mr.
Jones proceeds to Springfield, Illinois, next
week, to execute a model of that face of all
faces, ' Old Abe's," in plaster, aud if he suc
ceeds in making a good looking likenesi of it,
he will give the most indisputable evidence of
possessing genius of the most remarkable order."
