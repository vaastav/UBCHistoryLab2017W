Thk end has come,
ture has adjourned.
The Igiela-
Free trade and a Solid South con
trol Congress. Can they beat Pro
tection and a Solid North for Presi
dent? Carlisle got one vote in the east,
Cox got two in the south, and yet
we are told the Democratic party is
not. sectional.
During the fight for Speaker,
Randall kept telling his friends to
look out for a surprise. Well, his
friends are surprised.
It may be useful further along to
remember that, Carlisle got but one
vote trom the EaeUrn States, and
but one from the Middle States.

Kentucky has the Speaker, Mis
souri the Clerk, and Texas the door
keeper of the present House. Isn't
the Southern tail wagging the dog ?
The gentlemen who fired on Fort
Sumpter, and raised Cain a few years
since, are now in charge of the House
of Representatives at Washington.
Since the election of Carlisle,
McDonald,- of Indiana, starts his
Presidential boom by endorsing the
Shakers free trade views. Let her
boom, Bay we.
The election of Carlisle, an avow
ed free trader, is simply notice irom
the Democracy to the American
workincman that he must compete,
for a living, with the pauper labor
of Europe.
Sec. Folger's plan for getting rid
of the trade dollar, is to exchange
il.-m t",.rili( standard silver dollar
and then recoin them into standard
dollars. This is easy and sensible.
Di'kixg the present year, the lo?sis
of the insurance companies in this
country have amounted to more
than 6K!0,00',0Ua This has so
alarmed ,the companies that they
deem a thorough revision of the rates
necessary.
We were met with ridicule last
year, when we insisted that protec
tion was an issue. Now, when
free trade Speaker holds the reins,
aud Pennsylvania s interests are
threatened with bankruptcy, the
dullest "kicker" can see it"
The election of an avowed free
trader to the Speakership, has had
the queer effect of setting all the
Democratic papers in this State to
work, proving that he is not a tore
trader, while the Democratic papers
of bis own State are exulting over
the fact that he is.
"Thank (.Jon tor the opportunity
to knife the Pennsylvania iron men,"
exclaimed Frank Hurd, the notori
ous Democratic Free Trade member
of Congress from Ohio, when it was
ascertained that Carlisle was elected
and all. the Southern Brigadiers are
shouting amen !
During the struggle over the
Speakership, Mr. llensel, Chairman
of our Democratic State Committee.
was in Washington booming Ran
dull, and there expressed the opin
ion that Pennsylvania was a fairly
debaWble State in the coming Presi
dential election Wonder if he
thinks so now ?
The Iiellefonte Watchman dubbs
Mr. Blaine, "the whisky candidate,'
because he favors the distribution o
the tax collected from whisky
anaong the States, and it thinks that
the "christian people" of the United
States are not anxious to have the
world sneer at us as a government
that is run on and by whisky."
It is announced that prominent
parties in Texas are about to begi
suits against the United States Gov
ernrrent for the value of slaves
emancipated during the war. Evi
dently these people thine the grey
is on top again. They will probabl
discover their mistake after expend
ing their money iu useless legisla
tion.
Now that the Legislature has ad
journed, the bold, cold fact stares
those politicians in the face who
were instrumental in giving us
Democratic Reform Governor, that
their monumental folly has cost the
tar payers over fre hundred and
thirty-fix thousand dollart, for a use
less extra session. The idiocy of
trusting to Democratic promises of
reform, has again been fully demon
strated. If the Meyersdale Commercial will
point out when or where the Her
ald asserted during the canvass of
last year "that there were less than
one hundred Independents iu the
county," or when or where, "he ad
mits that there were eight times that
number now," we will agree that for
once it speaks the truth. We com-
mend to it the old adage that eays:
"The disciples of Annaniaa should
have good memories."

Randall. But they wore as rothing
o the old Bourbon free traders who
tad determined to carry everything
with a high hand, regardless of con
frequences. We shall seethe results.

election of Carlisle to the Speakership

yet the Democratic journals ol luis ,
State profess to be satisfied with the
result, and are attempting to deny
that the Democracy of the Nation is
against a'protective tariff, and that
the Solid South and Free Trade won
a victory in Carlisle's election.
Thb following little episode is
reported to have occurred at Harris
burg shortly after the veto message
had been so ignominiously disposed
of.
A rumor having obtained some
credence that the Attorney General :
11 i . i !
W0U1U we presseu iu issue a

delegation ot Representatives
unted up the Attorney General and
one of them acting as spokesmen,
said :
"Mr. Cassidy, it U announced that you

Is it true?
No," paid the Attorney General, (irmly.
If vou will onlv cet out of this town and
relieve its atmosphere from the pollutiou of
our presence, why in nd s name go.
If one of the "Representatives''
had, in reply to this brutal insolence,
appplied a number ten boot ta the
Attorney General's seat of honor,
the interview would have been
properly and deservedly rounded
out.
While the professed tariff Demo-!
crats of this State are singing very
mall on the question of protection,
and trying to induce their followers
to believe that Speaker Carlisle and
the Democratic House over which
he presides, will pursue a very con
servative course, it muf-t be borne in
mind that Mr. Carlisle is, and always
has been an open, persistant foe of
protection, and that Mr. Watterson,
editor of the Louisville Courier
Journal, the lending Democratic
journal in Carlisle's own State,
declared some time since, that he
(Carlisle) would be Speaker, and
that the "gigantic public robbery" of
the tariff was to be stopped. Which
of these declarations does the public
think is correct ? That of the Dem
ocrats of this State, who opposed
Carlisle's election on the grwund
that he was not as safe on the tariff
question as was Randall, or that of
Watterson, his fast friend, and the
leading editor of the party in the
Mate he represents
The third annual message of pres
ident Arthur, given in full on anoth
er page, will doubtless attract tne
attention of every intelligent citizen.
It is a concise statement of the lor-
eisrn relations and public affairs of
the country, coupled wth Fuch rec
ommendations as commend them
selves to the President's judgment.
He wastes no words on glittering
generalities, and confines himself
closely to business matters. Its
salient points are a demand tor tlie
suppression of Mormon polygamy,
a decided opposition to any disturb
ance of the present tariff law until it
has been more thoroughly tested, a
recommendation of the improvement
of our naval defenses, a commen
dation of the civil service reform act,
and an expression of opinion that
our surplus revenue should be ap
plied to building up a navy and pro
tecting our harbors. Other subjects
of minor importance are comment
ed upon, and taken all in all, the
message will attract, and well de
serves commendation for its plain
and sensible presentation of the
National situation.
When the Legislature assembled
on.iuesaay oi last wees, as was
anticipated, the Governor sent in a
message vetoing the salary bill.
After brief discussion the House
passed the bill over the veto, by a
vote of 1C5 yeas, to 25 nays, more
than two-thirds, aud in the Senate
the yeto got but 4 affirmative votes
to .17 nays. On Wednesday both
Houses adjourned nine die, and so,
the long, do-nothing, foolish, ex
pensive xtra session came to an
end.
The veto message is a most extra
ordinary State paper, and reads like
a school masters lecture to bad
boys, aud we do not wonder that it
was so unceremoniously and un
mercifully kicked out of the House.
The pay of members is fixed bylaw,
and Governor I'attison knew when
he called the extra session, that he
could not abate it one jot His veto
message was therefore a childish
display of spleen, and well deserved
the contemptuous treatment it re
ceived. He apparently forgot that
th Legislature is a co-ordinate
branch of the Government; his
equal, not his inferior, and when he
attempted to deny the right of its
members to pay, because Uvey could
nt agree on apportionment bills,
and ta hector them for failing to
perform their duty, he is guilty not
only of a gross impertinence, but of
a flagrant assumption o( authority
which, if tolerated, would overturn
the ntire theory of our State Gov
ernment The Governor is not
responsible for the failure of the
Legislature to pass apportionment
bills, but he is responsible for calling
the extra session, when it was ap
parent to ail sensible own that do
agreement could be arrired at, ani
for the consequent waste of more
than half a million of the people's
money, and we presume that the
knowledge that this fact was patent
to the world, stung him to the fur
ther folly of a veto, and the resulting
exposure of the fact that he has
utterly lost influence with the
representatives
of the party that
placed him in power. No man ever
occupied a more humiliating position
than does the Governor of this great
Commonwealth.

Democratic Fear for Business Inter

The election of Mr. Carlisle is in
opposition to the conservative mass
es of the Democratic party, and, we
may as well add, lor we think it, to
the business interests of the country.
If he 6hall do aught to disturb these
interests, just recovering from the
recent change in the revenue laws,
he will be buried deeper than plum
met ever sounded. What we write
seems the natural inference to be
drawn from

From the New York Sua.
As we understand the position of
the new Speaker he is entirely op
posed to the protective features of
the present tariff, big and little, di
rect and incidental, practically no
less than in theory, and, in common
with many other free traders, he
holds that the only question of prin
ciple that remains in our politics is
the logical application of the doc
trine of a tariff for revenue onlv, all
strictly political questions being des
titute of principle and subordinate,
inferior, of little consequence in com
I parison.
Mr. Carlisle is an honest man. He
does not look one way ana row
another. Ilis acts and his principles
will never be found in contlict. He
is not :: free trader in private and a
protectionist in Congress.
DelilM-rate Assault on American In
dustries). A. K. Mi-Clare, la Philadelphia Tie.
It is a revolution in Democratic
policy, a bold departure from all
Demecnitic teachings and traditions
of the last century a defiant dccla
ration ol war agaim-t even inciden
tal protection to the dissatisfied
industries which are to day the
pride, the force, and the wealth of
the Republic. For years the Dem
ocratic party ha3 battled against
prohibitory protection, but never
until now has it avowed its purpose
to discard even discrimination in fa
vor of domestic industry.
The new Democratic deliverance
will startle the country North and
South. The suicidal declaration for
a tariff for revenue only" in 1SS0
defeated the Democrats in Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York,
Connecticut, and nearly lost New
Jersey and Delaware, but the party
disavowed it in all these btates, and
the country had enough faith in
General Hancock to prevent the
positive disintegration of the party
Hut now the Democratic proclama
tion of aggressive hostility to any
and every shade of protection
to American industry conies from a
House assuming to speak tor the
party just en the threshold of a Pres
idential contest, and the proclama
tion comes from the body that is
charged by the country with the
preliminary legislation about the
subject.
The success of Carlisle in the
Democratic caucus last night means
that the committees of the House
will be formed in the interest
of the anti protection wing of
the Democratic party. It means
also that the Southern wing of the
party, having formed alliances to
elect Mr. Carlisle, will take steps to
make the best possible use of their
victory.
It matters not that Mr. Carlaisle
is one of the broadest and fairest men
among the Congressmen from the
Southern States. The question is
not what he would like to do, but
what the men who have contributed
to his election may compel him to do.
The conservative attitude he assu
med during the contest for the
Speakership was simply a matter
of diplomacy. He was bidding for
votes, and he secured them by con
cealing rather than avowing his
purposes. But it is not to be sup
posed that he secured votes without
pledges. These must be met, and
as f.iir men as Mr. Carlisle have been
made the instruments to carry out
the very worst schemes of a domi
nant faction.
The success of Mr. Carlisle means
in short, that old fashioned Democ
ra cy is to assert itself, and that
under cover of the new Speaker's
reputation and record the Southern
faction is to fight for the control of
the party machinery. Inter Ocean
The election ot Mr. Carlisle to the
Speakership is fuller of meaning
than any other political event in
many vear. It admits of but one
explanation. 1 he Democratic party,
aeanouie pieaumgs aim warnings
of a few half hearted Northern lead -
ers, has boldlv taken its stand upon
the only distinctive issue it has ever
been faithful to and declared for
free trade, pure and simple. It csn
uot be said that the contest for the
Speakership was a mere contest be
tween men. The fight was fought on
clearly defined isue3 Free Trade,
or Protection. Mr. Randall had
been three times chost-n Speaker by
the Democratic party. A man of
recognized ability, and an excellent
parliamentarian, Congress never
had a more efficient or popular
Speaker. The parity of his personal
character, his eminent fitness and
his satisfactory record were admitted
by friend and foe. But, unfortun
ately for him, he is an advocate, to
a (certain extent, at least, of a tariff
for protection of American indus
tries. His successful opponent, Mr.
Carlisle, has no greater ability, has
been but a comparatively short time
"n Congress and his qualifications
for the Speakership are yet to be de
termined, but he is an open, avowed,
persistent opponent of protection.
Called upon to choose between these
two men and the principles they
represent, the Democratic party, by
a vote of more than two to one, hon
ored the exponent pf free trade and
buried the advocate of Protection jn
a defeat as overwhelming as it wag ,
unmerited- We close as we began,
and say that Mr, iUndall's defeat!
admits of but one explanation. The
Democratic party, casting policy to
the winds, has declared for free
trade. Mercer Dispatch.
Null's Trial Postponed.
Usio.NTOWN, Pa., December
The Nutt trial took a sudden
o.
and
unexpected turn to day. The work
of selecting a jury began at 9 o'clock
and it soon became evident that
twelve men could not be found in the
panel of eighty who understood the
ruling of the Court, who were compe
tent to serve . The jurors had form
ed opinions which it would require
strong evidence to remove, and they
were challenged for cause. The
challenging proceeded with great
monotony until the twenty fourth
juror was reached, who was accept
ed and sworn. When the panel
of eighty had been gone over only
three were sworn. The defense had
made six of the twenty, peremptory
challenges allowed them, and the
Commonwealth two of their four.
The prisoner's counsel then deci
ded that it would be useless to try
to get a jury in Fayette county, for
at this rate a special venire of 300 or
400 would be needed, which would
require several days. Senator Voor-
hees accepted the answers given by
the eighty jurors examined as ex
pressive of the sentiment of the coun
ty, and he thought it necessary,
therefore, that a change ol venue
should be moved. The prosecution
did not object, and the motion for a
change was allowed. Several caunr
ties were proposed, but the delense
urged that a speedy trial could be
obtained better in Allegheny than iu
any other neighboring county. The
prosecution did not like Allegheny,
but did not make strong objections,
arid Judge Wilson granted the pray
er of defense in favor of that coun
ty. This sudden stroke meets with
great popular favor. All sides ad
mit that the case could not be tak
en to a county where the sentiment
is more strongly in favor of young
Nutt Many pronounce it equiva
lent to an acquittal. The casa will
probably be tried the first week in
January under Judge Stowe.
The opinion is freely expressed
this evening that at least sixty of
the eighty jurors examined to try
would have acquitted the defendant.
In fact, so hrmly were they so dis
posed that their opinions cnalleng-
ta tnem oil. senator oornees
stated this evening that there was
not such another case in the civiliz
ed world. He is confident of an ac
quittal.
Gnawed My Wolves.
bioux L'ity, December . A man
who arrived from Ainsworth, Neb.,
reports much excitement there over
the recent lynching of horse thieves.
The bodies were found where the
Vigilance Committee had left them
hancinp. and had evidently been
dead a week or two. One found
near Long Pine had been hanged so
low that the wolves had eaten the
lower parts of his legs. In all, four
or five men are believed to have been
hanged. Who the vigilantes arenu
one cares to ascertain. They are
believed to be mostly homesteaders,
living between the Elkhorn and the
Niobrari. The horse thieves they
are hanging are the remains of Doc
Middleton's gang. On the train on
which the man who gives this infor
mation went to Ainsworth was a
Sheriff with a murderer and two
horse thieves going to Ainsworth
for trial. As the Sheriff expected a
lynching party at the depot, he fur
nished his prisoners with pistols, and
induced the conductor to 6top before
the train reached the station, and
the party disappeared in the dark
ness. At the stations nearly all the
able-bodied citizens had assembled.
They received the news of the
Sheriff's flank movement, and said
that if the men were not tried at
this term of court they would hang
them.
Mr. Campbell's Mineral Coiiunlsolon,
Washington, Dec. 6. Represent
ative Campbel', of Pennsylvania,
proposes to renew his bill of last ses
sion, providing for the appointment
by the President of a commission of
seven persons killed in the investi
gation, production and use of Metal
lic substances and other structural
materials. Their business will be to
plan and superintend the execution
of such tests and investigation of
materials used extensively in the
construction of buildings, bridges,
ships and other structures and ma
chinery. An annual report of the
results achieved must be submitted
to the Secretary of the Interior, but
no salaries will be paid, although
mileage and other necessary expen
ses incurred will be allowed the
members of the commission. Scien
tific and mechanical experts in
twenty eight States have signified
their approval of the proposition
and it is probable that it will suc
ceed this session.

The Jay Earthquake.
Boston, December 6. The bark
Bessie Baker, from Manila, May 'S,
via Batavia, which arrived here to

the Java earthquake. She reports
that on August 27, Babie Island

rising from the westward, which
contiuued to. rise until it became
obscured, barometer suddenly falling

showers of sand and ashes began
falling. This was atmut noon time.
Then it became darker than the
darkest night, the wind blowing a
perfect hurricane and the sea per
fectly smooth. A heavy rumbling
like thunder was heard continually,
the sky was lighted by flashes of
lightning and a strong smell of sul
phur pervaJed the air, making it
difficult to breathe. Altogether it
formed one of the wildest and most
awful experiences imaginable. The
tide was setting strongly to the west
ward throughout the gale at the rate
of fourteen knots. The sky became
clearer at 3 p. m., though the ashes
continued to fall. On the 20th
while passing through the Straits of
Suuda, we 'saw a large number of
dead bodies, and the water for miles
was covered with trees and ashes,

Shocking Suicide.
Connellsville, December . The
wife of Patrick Lyons, a laborer, re
siding until recently at Gibson, a
few miles east of here, was killed on
the Baltimore and Ohio road this
morning under circumstances which
lead to the belief that she committed
suicide. She started from home
early with a little five year old 6on
to gather coal along the road. She
was seen standing on the east bound
track after the Uniontown accommo
dation had passed, apparently ab
sorbed in deep thought To the en
treaties of the child to be taken
home for breakfast she replied he
would have to do without breakfast,
as she had nothing in the house to
eat.
She remained in her position
watching the approach of an engine
and several cars backing down on
the west bound track. When they
came within a few yards of her she
deliberately walked over and step
ped on the track in front of the ap
proaching train, was struck and car
ried under the cars. The little boy,
as, if fearing impending danger,
clung to his mother's skirts, and
narrowly escaped meeting her ter
rible fate. His screams first appris
ed the trainmen of the accident
When the train was stopped and the
unfortunate creature was taken from
under it was found she was literally
cut to pieces. The woman was ad
dicted to drink and this wickedness
drove her husband away from home
some time since. Deceased was 6o
years old and leaves a family of
small children utterly destitute.
Imprisoned in asfwrr
Pitts bcug, December 6. Fred
Durke, alias Fred Vogel, a prisoner
under eleven years' sentence for fe
lonious assault, attempted to escape
to-night from the new Riverside
Penitentiary. His absence was dis
covered when the convicts were
inarched into their cells and an im
mediate search begun. Bonfires
were built around the outside of the
prison walls and the watch inside
doubled. A complete search was
made and at 10::0 o'clock to-night
the man was found in the main
sewer on his knees and up to his
neck in water and filth. He was
speechless and in a semi conscious
condition. Restoratives were at once
applied, but his recovery is not cer
tain, as he inhaled so much foul gas.
His progress down the sewer to the
river was stopped by a "goose neck"
in the sluice, which he could not
swim through, as he wuld have
been drowned. In this condition he
could not escape, either backwards
or forwards.
Gone I'p in Smoke.
Philadelphia, December G. This
year has been the most disastrous
ever known in the history of the
American insurance business. The
losses will exceed $100,000,000.
Many of the agents of large foreign
and home companies represented
in this city express the utmost anx
iety regarding the future of the in
surance business, They say that the
losses have increased to such an
alarming extent that a thorough re
vision of the rates have been neces
sary. An association, composed of
the Philadelphia representatives of
all the companies doing business
here, meet to dav to consider means
i of increasing premiums.
1 he agents of one oi the largest
companies said : "The number of
fires that have occurred in this coun
try within the past year would sur
prise you. The losses have been
constant and increasing. They will
aggregate one hundred millions. It
is true there has not been any great
conflagration like that of Chicago or
Portland, or those of Boston; but
the vast loss has been made by the
gradual growth of comparatively
small losses."

They also say that "there were

was arrested last night for embezzle
ment, made a most desperate attempt
this morning in the Central .Station

his wrist with broken glass, thrust a
sharpened lead pencil deeply into
his neck, and then used a pocket
comb in an effort to cut his throat
This, he eays, he did at two o'clock,
and then lay in the utmost agony,
hoping for death. He is a young
man of good family, and his friends
say his mind is unbalanced. His
condition is critical.
