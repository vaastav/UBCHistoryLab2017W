Let it be everywhere thundered, then, that
the present and fearful peril of the Republican
cause is Compromise—that concessions to save
the Union are themselves tbe source of the
greatest danger to tbe Union. If Lincoln's clec
tion does not secure him obedience—negotia
tion, apology, concession, never will. To tam
per with the spirit of rebellion is to pander to
it to seek to plscate it is to retreat before it
aad invite it to pursue. Mr. Lincoln'* dignified
if not indignant refusal to plead at ita bar, hia
fixed purpoee to speak of his views and purposes
only when he insy spetk at once with propriety
and with authority, is among tbe many proofs of
his fitness for the high station to which tbe peo
ple have called him.
So State but South Carolina really wanta to
leave the Union but a dosen States, will gladly
make her contumacy a lever whereby to move
the North from its upright poeition. Let Vir
ginia believe that, bv threatening to dissolve the
Union, she msy frighten the Free States into a
waiver of further resistance to slavery extension,
and she will make the demand, declaring that a
refusal will send her into the secession camp
aad having presented that ultima torn, tho pride
of consistency will constrain her to adhere to
it. What the country urgently needs la a con
viction that nothing will bo yielded to menace
tbat has not been conceded to argument Let
thia convictioo be diffused, and the Union will
bravely outride the storm that now threatens it,
or will be strengthened by the departur»of the
States that perversely break away. The calm
courage which makea no response to railing ae
cuaations, but cherishes a serene faith in the
ultimate triumph of Right, is to-day tbe most
precious element in tho composition of American
statesmanship.
