Washington, Dec. 7. The following
is the president's message to congress:
To the Congress 0f the United States: As
representative of the people In the legisla
tive branch of their government you have
assembled at a time when the strength and
excellence of our free institutions and the
fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule
have been again made mani test A political
contest Involving momentous consequences,
fraught with feverish apprehension and
creating aggressiveness so intense as to ap
proach bitterness and passion, has been
waged throughout our land and determined
by the decree of free and independent suf
frage, without disturbance of our tran
quility or the least sign of weakness in our
national structure.
When we consider these Incidents and
contemplate the peaceful obedience and
manly submission which have succeeded a
heated clash of political opinions we dis
cover abundant evidence of a determination
on the part of countrymen to abide by every
verdict of the popular will and to be con
trolled at all times by an abiding faith In the
agencies established for the direction of the
affairs of their government Thus our peo
ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en
titles them to demand of those who under
take to make and execute their laws such
faithful and unselfish service in their behalf
as can only be prompted by a serious appre
ciation of the trust and confidence which the
acceptance of public duty invites
In obedience to a constitutional require
ment, I herein submit to the Congress cer
tain Information concerning national af
fairs, with the suggestion of such legislation
as In my Judgment Is necessary and expe
dient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome
narration, I shall omit many details con
cerning matters within federal control,
which, though by no means unimportant,
are more profitably discussed In depart
mental reports. I shall also further curtail
this communication by omitting a minute
recital of many minor incidents connected
with our foreign relations which have here
tofore found a place In executive messages,
but are now contained in a report of the
Secretary of State. V'-h is herewith
submitted.
At the outset of a reference to tho; men
Important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, it would afford me sat
isfaction If I could assure the Congress that
the disturbed condition In Asiatic Turkey
had during the past year assumed a less
hideous and bloody aspect, and that either
as a consequence of the awakening of
the Turkish government to the demands
of humane civilization or as the
result of decisive action on the
part of the great nations having the right
by treaty to Interfere for the protection of
those exposed to the rage of mere bigotry
and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features
of the situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a softened
disposition or protective intervention, we
have been afflicted by continued and not un
frequent reports of the wanton destruction
of home and the bloody butchery of men,
women and children, made martyrs to their
profession of Christian faith. While none
of our citizens In Turkey have thus far been
killed or wounded, though often In the midst
of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety In
the future Is by no means assured. Our
government at home and our minister at
Constantinople have left nothing undone to
protect our missionaries In Ottoman terri
tory, who constitute nearly all the individ
uals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Our effort in this direction will not be re
laxed, but the deep feeling and sympathy
that hare been aroused among our people
ought not to so far blind their reason and
judgment as to lead them to demand impos
sible things. The outbreaks of blind fury
which led to murder and pillage In Turkey
occur suddenly and without notice, and an
attempt on our part to force such a hostile
presence there as might be effective for pre
vention or protection would not only be re
sisted by the Ottoman government, but
would be regarded as an Interruption of
their plans to the great nations who assert
their exclusive right to Intervene In their
own time and method for the security of
life and prefperty in Turkey.
Several naval vessels are stationed In the
Mediterranean as a measure of caution and
to furnish all possible relief and refuge In
case of emergency. We hare claims against
the Turkish government for the pillage aud
destruction of missionary property at Har
pool and Marash during uprisings at those
places. Thus far the validity of these de
mands has not been admitted through our
minister. Prior to such outrages and in an
ticipation of danger we demanded protection
for the persons and property of our mission
ary citizens In the localities mentioned,
and notwithstanding that evidence exists of
actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the
work of destruction and robbery. The facts
as they now appear do not permit us to doubt
the justice of these claims, and nothing will
be omitted to bring about their prompt wt
tlement A number of Armenian refugees
having arrived at our ports, an -order has
lately been obtained from the Turkish gov
ernment permitting the wives and children
of such refugees to join them here. It Is
hoped that hereafter no obstacle will be In
terposed to prevent the escape of all those
who seek to avoid the perils which threaten
them in Turkish dominions.
Our recently appointed consnl to Krzeroum
Is at bis post and discharging the duties of
his office, though for some unaccountable
reason his formal exrquator from the Sultan
has not been Issued, I do not believe that the
present somber prospect In Turkey will be
long permitted to offend the sight of Christ
endom. It so mars the human and enlight
ened civilisation that belongs to the close of
the. nineteenth century that It seems hardly
possible that the earaest demand of good
people throughout the Christian world for
Its corrective treatment will remain un
answered. CUBA.
The Insurrection In Cub still continues,
with (11 Its perplexities. It Is difficult to
perceive tkat any progress ha thus far been
made toward the pacification of the Island
r that the situation of affair a depicted la
my last annual message ha In the least Im
proved. If Spain still holds Havana and the
seaports and all considerable towns, the In
surgents still roam at will over at least
two-thirds of the Inland country. If the de
termination of Spain to put down the Insur
rection seems but to strengthen with the
lapse of time, and isjevldenced by her un
hesitating devotion of largely Increased
military and naval forces to the task, there
Is much reason to believe that the Insur
gents have gained In point of numbers and
character and resources, and are none the
less inflexible In tbelr resolve not to succumb
without practically securing the great pro
jects for which they took up arms. If Spain
has not yet re-established her authority,
neither have the insurgents yet made good
their title to be regarded as an Independent
state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on,
the oretense that civil government exists on
the island, except so far as Spain Is able to
maintain It, has been practically abandoned.
Spain does keep on foot such a govern
ment, more or less Imperfectly, in the large
towns and their Immediate suburbs. But,
that exception being made, the entire coun
try Is either given over to anarchy or is
subject to the military occupation of one or
the other party. It Is reported, indeed, on
reliable authority that, at the demand of
the commander-in-chief of the Insurgent
army, the putative Cuban government has
now given up all attempt to exercise it
functions, leaving that government, confes
sedly (what there is the best reason for sup
posing It always to have been la fact) a gov
ernment merely on paper.
were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in pitched
battle, prompt and decisive results might be
looked for, and the Immense superiority of
the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline
and equipment, could hardly fall to tell
greatly to their advantage. But they are
called upon to face a foe that shuns general
engagements, that can choose and does
choose its own ground, that from the nature
of the country is visible or invisible at
pleasure, and that fights only from am
buscade and when all the advantages of po
sition and numbers are on its side In a
country where all that Is lndispenslble to
life In the way of food, clothing and shelter
is so easily obtainable especially by those
born and bred on the soli, it is obvious that
there is hardly a limit to the time during
which .hostilities of this sort may be pro
longed. Meanwhile as in all cases of pro
tracted civil strife, the passions of the com
batants grow more and more inflamed and
excesses on both sides are more frequent
and more deplorable.
They also are participated in Yr bands of
marauders, who, now in the name of one
party and now In the name of the other, as
may best suit the occasion, harass the coun
try at will and plunder its wretched Inhab
itants for their own advantage. Such a
condition of things would inevitably entail
immense destruction of property even If it
were the policy of both parties to prevent it
as far as practicable. But while such
seemed to be the original policy of the Span
ish government. It has now apparently
bandrned It, and is acting upon the same
theory as the insurgents, aamely that the
exigencies of the contest require the whole
sale annihilation of property, that It may
not prove of use and advantage to the ene
my. It is to the same end that in pursuance
of general orders, Spanish garrisons are
now being withdrawn from plantations and
the rural population reqnlred to concentrate
Itself In the towns.
The sure result would seem to be that the
Industrial value of the island is fast dimin
ishing and that unless there Is a speedy and
radical change in existing conditions, it will
soon disappear altogether. That value con
sists very largely, of course, in its capacity
to produce sugars a capacity already much
reduced by Interruptions to tillage which
have taken place during the last two years.
It Is reliably asserted that should these in
terruptions continue during the current
year, and practically extend, as is now
threatened, to the entire sugar producing
territory of the island, so much time and so
much money will be required to restore the
land to Its normal productiveness that it Is
extremely doubtful If capltalcan be Induced
to even make the attempt
The spectacle of the utter ruin of an ad
joining country by nature, one of the most
fertile and charming on the globe, would
engage the serious attention of the govern
ment and people of the United States under
any circumstances. In point of fact, they
have a concern with It which is by no means
of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic
character. It lies so near to us as to be
hardly separated from our country. Our
actual pecuniary interest in It is second
only to that of the people and government
of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that
at least from I30,0K),0K) to QO.(X)O,0O of
capital Is invested in plantations. In rail
road, mining and other business enter
prises on the island. The volume of trade
between the United States and Cuba, which
in 1889 amounted to about J04.000.IMK), rose
in 1893 to about 103.IH0,000, and in 1894,
the year lie fore present insurrection broke
out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Be
sides this large pecuniary Interest staked in
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds
Itself inextricably involved in the present
contest in other ways both vexatious and
costly.
Many Cubans reside In this country, and
Indirectly promote the Insurrection through
the press by public meetings, by the pur
chase and shipment of arms, by the raising
of funds, and by other wans which the
spirit of our Institutions and the tenor of
our laws do not permit to be made the sub
ject of criminal prosecution. Some of them,
though Cubans at heart and In all their feel
ings and interests, have taken out papers as
naturalized citizens of the United States, a
proceeding resorted to with a view to pos
sible protection by this government and
not unnaturally regarded with much indig
nation by the country of their origin. The
Insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged and
supported by the widespread sympathy of
the people of this country always instinct
ively felt for every struggle for better and
freer government, and which In the case of
the more adventurous and restless elements
of our population, leads In only too many
Instances to active aud personal participa
tion in the contest
The result Is that this government Is .con
stantly called upon to protect American cit
izens, to claim damages for Injuries to per
sons and property, now estimated at many
millions of dollars, and to ask explanations
and apologies for the acts ot Spanish offi
cials whose zeal for the repression of rebel
lion sentiments blinds them to the Immun
ities belonging to the unoffending citizens
of a friendly power.
It follows from the same causes that the
United States Is compelled to actively police
a long line of sea coast against unlawful ex
peditions, the escape of which the utmost
vigilance will not alwavs suffice to prevent
These inevitable entanglements ol the
United States with the rebellion In Cuba,
the large American property interests af
fected and considerations of philanthropy
and humanity in general, have led to a ve
hement demand In various quarters for
tome sort of positive intervention on the
part of the United States It was at first
proposed that belligerent rights should be
Recorded to the Insurgents, a proposition no
longer nrged because untimely and In prac
tical operation clearly perilous and Injurious
to our own interests. It has since been and
Is now sometimes contended that the inde
pendence of the insurgents should be recog
sized, but imperfect or restricted as the
(Spanish gsvernment of the island may be,
no other exists there, unless the will of the
military officer in temporary command of a
particular district can be dlgnlried as a
tpeclc of government It Is now also sug
gested that the United States should buy the
island, a suggestion possibly worthy of con
sideration If there were any evidence of a
leslre or willingness on the part of Spain to
entertain such a proposal. It Is urged,
Inally, that all other methods falling, the
listing Internecine strife In Cuba should be
terminated by our Intervention, even at the
cost of a war between the United Slates and
fcpaln-a war which Its advocates confidently
prophecy could be neither large In its pro
portions nor doubtful In Ha Issue. The cor
rectness of this forecast need be neither
tfflrmed nor denied. The United States has
severtheless a character to maintain as a
nation, which plainly dictates that right and
might should be the rule of its conduct ,
Further, though the United States is not a
nation to which peace Is a necessity, It Is, in
truth, the most pacific of powers and desires
nothing so much as to live at amity with all
the world. Its own ample and diversified
domains satisfy all possible longings for ter
ritory, preclude all dreams of conques and
prevent the casting of any covetous eyes
upon neighboring regions, however attract
ive. That our conduct towards Spain and
her dominions has constituted no exception
to this national disposition is made manVest
by the course of our government, not only
thus far during the present insurrection, but
during the ten years that followed the rising
at Yara in 186a No other great power. It
may safely be said, under circumstances of
similar perplexity, would have manifested
the same restraint and the same patient en
durance. It may also be said that tott aistent at
titude of the United Slates (Wat -s Spain In
connection with Cuba will 4&uesttonably
evince no slight respect ana regard for
Spain on the part of the American people.
They In truth do not forget her connection
with the discovery of the Western hemis
phere, nor do they underestimate the great
qualities of the Spanish people, nor fall to
fully recognize their splendid patriotism
and their chivalrous dcVotion to the national
honor. They view with wonder and admira
tion the cheerful resolution with which vast
bodies of men are sent across thousands of
miles of ocean and an enormous debt accum
ulated, that the costly position of the, gem of.
the Antilles may still hold Its place in the
Spanish crown. And yet neither the govern
ment nor the people, of the United States
have shut their eyes to the course of events
In Cuba or have failed to realize the exist
ence of conceded grievances which have led
to the present revolt from the authority of
Spain, grievances recognized by the Queen
Regent and by the Cortes, voiced by tne
most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish
statesmen, without regard to party, remon
strated by reforms proposed by the execu
tive and approved by the legislative branch
of the Spanish government
It is in the assumed temper and disposi
tion of the Spanish government to remedy
these grievances, fortified by Indications of
lnlluential public opinion in Spain, that this
government has hoped to discover the most
promising and effective means of composing
the present strife, wltn honor and advan
tage to Spain and with the achievement of
all the reasonable objects of the Insurrec
tion. It would seem that If Spain would offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rule which, while preserving tne sover
eirnity of Spain, would satisfy all rational
requirements of her Spanish subjects, there
should be no Just reason why the pacifica
tion of the Island might not be effected on
that basis. Such a result would appear to
be in the true Interest of all concerned. It
would at once stop the conflict which is now
consuming the resources of the Island and
making It worthless for whichever party
may ultimately prevail It would keep in
tact the possessions of Spain without touch
ing her honor, which will be consulted
rather than Impugned by the adequate re
dress of admitted grievances. It would put
the prosperity of the island and the fortunes
of its Inhabitants within tbelr own control.
without severing the natural and ancicn
ties which bind them to the mothe. mntry,
and would yet enable them to test, ir ca
pacity for self government under the most
favorable conditions
It has been objected on the one side that
Spain should not promise autonomy until
her Insurgent subjects lay down tnetr arms.
On the other side, that promised autonomy.
however liberal. Is insufficient, because
without assurance of the promise being ful
filled. But the reasonableness of a requirement
by Spain, of unconditional surrender on the
part ot the insurgent Cubans oeiore tneir
autonomy is conceded is not altogether ap
parent It Ignores important features of
the situation tne stability two years' dura
tion has given to the insurrection; the feas
ibility of its prolongation in the nature of
things, and as shown by past experience the
utter and imminent ruin of the island. unless
the present strife is speedily composed;
above all, the rank abuses which all parties
In Spain, all branches of her government
and all her leading public men concede to
exist and profess a desire to remove. Facing
such circumstances, to withold the proffer
of needed reforms until the parties demand
ing them put themselves at mercy by throw
ing down their arms, has the appearance of
neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting
suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro
fessed willingness to gram reiorms. Tne
objection on behalf of the Insurgents that
promised reform canot oe reiieu upon must
of course be considered, though we have no
right to assume, and no reason for assum
ing, that anything Spain undertakes to do
for the relief ol Cuba win not be done ac
cording to both the spirit and the letter of
the undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of the weaker
of two combatants are always natural and
not always unjustifiable, being sincerely de
sirous In the Interest of both 'as well as on
Its own account that the Cuban problem
should be solved with the least possible de
lay. It was Intimated by this government to
the government of Spain some months ago
that if a satisfactory measure o' home rule
were tendered the Cuban insurgents, and
would be accepted by them upon a guaranty
of Its execution, the United States would en
deavor to find a way not objectionable to
Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While
no definite response to this Intimation has
yet been received from the Spanish govern
ment it is believed to be not altogether un
welcome, while, as already suggested, no
reason is perceived why It should not be ap
proved by the Insurgents, neither party an
fall to see the importance ot early action
and both must realize that to prolong the
present state of things for even a short
period will add enormously to the time and
labor and expenditure necessary to bring
about the industrial recuperation of the
Island. It is, therefore, fervently hoped
on all grounds that earnest efforts for head
ing the breach between Spain and tne in
surgent Cubans, upon the lines above Indi
cated, may. be at once Inaugurated and
pushed to an Immediate successful Issue.
The friendly offices of the United States,
either in the manner above outlined or in
any other way consistent with our constitu
tion and laws will always be at the disposal
of either party.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and our Interests would constrain us
to obtect to the acquisition of the island or
an Interference with its control by any other.
It should be added that it cannot be reason
ably assumed that the hitherto expectant
attitude of the United States will be indefi
nitely maintained.
While we are anxious to accord all due re
spect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot
rlew the pending conflict In all its features
snd properly app.ehend our Inevitable rela
tions to It and its possible results without
considering that by the course of events we
may be drawn Into such an unusual and un
precedented condition as will fix a limit to
ur patient waiting for Spain to end the
conflict, either alone and In her own way,
r with our friendly co-operation.
When the Inability of Spain to deal suc
cessfully with the insurrection has become
sianlfest and It Is demonstrated that her
tovereignty is extinct In Cuba for all pur
poses of Its rightful existence, and when a
sopeless struggle for its re-establlsbment
las degenerated Into a strife which means
sothlng more than the useless sacrifice of
human life and then utter destruction of the
rery subject matter of the conflict a situa
tion will be presented in which our obliga
tions to the sovereignty of Spain will be
luperseded by higher obligations which we
:an hardly hesitate to recognize and dis
charge. Deferring the choice of ways and
methods until the time for action arrives,
ire should make them depend upon the pre
cise conditions then existing, and they should
ot be determined upon without giving care
ful heed to every consideration involving
ur honor and Interest or the international
luty we owe to Spain. Until we face the
tontlngencies suggested or the situation 1
fcy other Incidents Imperatively changed we
thould continue In the line of conduct here
pursued, thus la ail circumstances ex
hibiting our obedience to the requirement)
of public law and our record for the duty
enjoined upon as by the position we occupy
in the family of nations.
A contemplation of emergencies that may
arise should plainly lead us to avoid their
creation, either through a careless disregard
of present duty or even an undue stimula
tion and ill-timed expression of feeling.
Bet I have deemed not amiss to remind the
congress that a time may arrive when a
correct policy and a care for our Interest
as well as a regard for the Interests of other
nations and their citizens, joined by consid
erations of humanity and a desire to see a
rich and fertile country Intimately related
to us, spared from complete devastation,
will constralnour government to such action
as will subserve the Interest thus Involved
and at the same 4tme promise to Cuba and
its Inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the
blessings of peace.
VENEZUELA.
The Venezuelan boundary question ha
ceased to b a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed upon
the substantial provisions of a treaty be
tween Great Britain and Venezuela submit
ting the whole controversy to arbitration'
The provisions of the treaty are so emi
nently just and fair that the consent of Ven
ezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated.
Negotiations for a treaty of general arbi
tration for all differences between Great
Britain and the United. States are far ad
vanced and promise to'reach a successful
consummation at an early date.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
The secretary ot the treasury reports that
duriii the fiscal year ended June 90, 1896,
the receipts of the government from all
sources amounted to 1409. 475,408.7a Dur
ing the same period its expenditures were
1434,678,654.48. The excess of expenditures
over receipts thus amounted to $25,203,
235.70. The ordinary expenditures during
the year were W.015. 852.21 less than dur
ing the preceding fiscal year. Of the re
ceipts mentioned there was derived from
customs the sum of 1160.021,751.67, and
from Internal revenue 1146,830,615.66. The
receipts from customs show an increase of
$7,863,134.23 over those from the same
source for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1895, and the receipts from Internal revenue
an increase of 13,534,537.91.
The value of our imported dutiable mer
chandise during the last fiscal year was
1369,757,470, and the value of free goods
imported 109,967,470, being an Increase of
16,5 N1.675 in the value of dutiable goods,
and 191,231,034 in the value of free goods
over the preceding year.
Our exports of merchandise, foreign and
domestic, amounted in Value to $882,606,938,
being an Increase over the preceding year
of $75,068,773. The average ad valorem
duty paid on dutiable goods Imported dur
ing the year was 39.94 per cent and on free
and dutiable goods taken together, 20.55
per cent
The cost of collecting our Internal revenue
was 2.78 per cent as against 2.81 percent
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.
The total production of distilled spirits, ex
clusive of fruit brandies, was 85,588,703
taxable gallons, being an increase of 6,639,
108 gallons over the preceding year. There
was also an increase of 1,443,676 gallons of
spirits, produced from fruit as compared
with the preceding year. The number of
barrels of beer produced was 35,859.250 as
against 33,589,784 produced In the preced
ing fiscal year, being an Increase of 2,269,
466 barrels.
OTHER DEPARTMENTS.
The report of the secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several
branches of the public service Intrusted to
his charge. The various recommendations
of the secretary are Indorsed.
The attorney general presents a detailed
and interesting statement of the Important
work done under his supervision during the
last fiscal year. The ownership and man
agement by the government of peniten
tiaries for the confinement of the convicted
in United States courts of violations of
federal laws, which formanyyears has been
a subject of executive recommendation, has
at last to a light extent been realized by the
utilization of the abandoned military prison
at Fort Leavenworth as a United States
penitentiary.
Federal Penitentiary.
This Is certainly a movement in the right
direction, but It ought to be at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive en
largement of this Improvised prison and the
construction of at least one more, to be
located In the southern states. The capacity
of the Leavenworth penitentiary is so 'lim
ited that the expense of its maintenance,
calculated at a per capita rate upon the
number of prisoners it can accommodate,
does not make as economical an exhibit asit
would if it were larger and better adapted
to prison purposes; but I am thoroughly
convinced that economy, humanity and a
proper sense of responsibility and duty to
wards those whom we punish for violations
of federal law dictate that the federal gov
ernment should have the entire control and
management of the penitentiaries where
convicted violators are confined. It appears
that since the transfer of the Fort Leaven
worth military prison to its new uses the
work previously done by prisoners confined
there, and for which expensive machinery
has been provided, has been discontinued.
This work consisted of the manufacture of
articles for army use, now done elsewhere.
On all grounds It is exceedingly desirable
that the convicts confined In this peniten
tiary lie allowed to resume work of this de
scription. Our postofflce department Is In good condi
tion and the exhibit made of its operations
during the tisril year ended June 30, 1896,
If allowance Is made for imperfections in
the laws a olicable to It is very satisfac
tory. T h. ' tal receipts during the year
were ;32,4ij 2OM.40. The total expenditures
were $90,626,296.84, exclusive of $1,669,
898.27 which wasearned by the Pacific rail
roads for transportation and credited on
their debt to the government There was
an increase of receipts over the previous
year of 15,516.080.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an
Increase of expenditures of 13,836,124.02, or
4.43 per cent The deficit was 11,679.956.19
less than that of the preceding year. The
chief expenditures of the postal service are
regulated by law and arc not In the control
of the postmaster general.
The deficit for the last year, although
much less than that of the last and preced
ing years, emphasizes the necessity for leg
islation to correct the growing abuse of
second-class rates, to which the deficit Is
mainly attributable The transmission at
the rate of one cent a pound of serial libra
ries, advertising' sheets, "house organs"
(periodicals advertising some particular
"house" or institution), sample copies and
the like, ought certainly be discontinued.
This subject Is discussed at considerable
length and reforms urgently recommended.
Navy. '
.The work of the navy department and Its
present conditions are fully exhibited In
the report of the secretary. The construc
tion of vessels for our new navy has been
energetically prosecuted by the present ad
ministration upon the general llnefe pre
viously adopted, the department having
seen no necessity for radical .changes In
prior methods under which the work was
found to be progressing In a manner highly
satisfactory. It has been decided, however,
to provide in every ship building contract
that the builder should pay all trial ex
penses, and It has also been determined to
pay no speed premiums In future contracts,
riVK CIVILIZED TRIBES.
The condition of affairs among the five
civilised tribes who occupy large tracts of
land In the Indian Territory, and who have
governments of their own, has assumed such
an asspect as to render It almost lndispens
lble that there should be an entire change
In the relations of these Indians to the gen
eral government This seems to be neces
sary In furtherance of their own Interests
as well as for the protection of non-Indian
residents In their territory. A commission
organized and empowered under several
recent laws Is now negotiating with these
Indians for the relinquishment of their
courts and the division of their common
lands in severalty, and aiding in the settle
ment of the troublesome question of tribal
membership. The reception of their first
proffers of negotions was not encouraging;
but through patience and such conduct on
their part as demonstrated that their inten
tions were friendly and in the interest of
the best prospect of success has become
more promising. The efforts should be to
save the Indians from the consequences of
their own mistakes and improvidence, and
to secure to the real Indian his right a
against Intruders and professed friends who
profit by his retrogression.
A change Is also needed to protect Hie and
property through the operations of courts
conducted according to strict justice and
strong enough to enforce their mandates,
vs a sincere friend of the Indian I am ex
ceedingly anxious that these reforms should
be accomplished with the consent and aid of
the tribes and that no necessity may be pre
sented for radical or drastic legislation. I
hope, therefore, that the commission now
conducting negotiations will soon be able to
report that progress has been made toward
a friendly adjustment of existing difficul
ties. PACIFIC RAILROADS.
On January 11, 1897, with the amount
already matured, more than 113,000,000 of
the principal of the subsldary bond Issued
by the United States in aid of the construc
tion of the Union Pacific railway, including
its Kansas line, and more than 16,000,000 of
like bonds, issued In aid of the Central Pa
cific railroad,' including those Issued to the
Western Railway company will have fallen
due and been paid or must on that day be
paid by the government Without any ref
erence to the application of the sinking fund
now in the treasury this will create such a
default on on the part of the companies to
the government as will give it the right to
at once Institute proceedings to foreclose its
mortgage Hen. In addition to this indebted
ness which will be due January 1, 1897
there will mature between that date and
January 1, 1899 the remaining principal of
sucn subsidy bonds which must also be met
by the government These amount to more
than 120,000,000 on account of the Union
Pacific lines and exceeds $21. 000,000 on ac
count of the Central Pacific lines.
In the case of the Union Paelfic company,
the situation has become especially urgent.
Proceedings have been instituted to fore
close a first mortgage upon those aided parts
of the main lines upon which the Govern
ment holds a second and subordinate mort
gage Hen. In consequence of these proceed
ings and increasing complications, added to
the default occurring on the first day of
January, 1897, a condition will be presented
at that date, so far as this company Is con
cerned that must emphasize the mandate of
the act of 1887 and give to executive duty
under its provisions a more imperative
aspect
Unless Congress shall otherwise direct or
shall have previously determined upon a
different solution of the problem there will
hardly appear to exist any reason for delay
ing beyond the date of the default above
mentioned such executive action as will
promise to subserve the public interests and
save the government from the loss threat
ened by further inaction.
OFFENSIVE PARTISANSHIP.
The progress made in civil service reform
furnishes a cause for the utmost congratu
lation. It has survived the doubts of its
friends as well as the rancor of Its enemies;
and has gained a permanent place among
the agencies destined to cleanse our politics
and improve, economize and elevate the
public service. There are now In the com
petitive classified service upwards of 84,000
places. More than half of these have been
included from time to time since March 4,
1893. A most radical and sweeping exten
sion was made by executive order dated the
6th day of May, 1896. And if fourth class
postmastershlps are not Included In the
statement it may be said that practically
all positions contemplated by the civil ser
vice law are now classified. Abundant rea
sons exist for including these postmaster
ships, based upon economy, Improved ser
vice and the peace and quiet of neighbor
hoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such
action at present I earnestly hope that con
gress will, without increasing postofflce ap
propriations, so adjust them as to permit in
proper cases a consolidation of these
postomces to the end that through this pro
cess tho result desired may to a limited ex
tent be accomplished.
The civil service rules as amended during
the last year provides for a sensible and
uniform method of promotion, basing elig
ibility to better positions upon demon
strated efficiency and faithfulness. The
ahsence of fixed rules on this subject has
been an Infirmity In the system more and
more apparent its other benefits have been
better appreciated. The advantage of civil
service methods in their business aspects
are too well understood to require argu
ment Their application has become a ne
cessity to the executive work of the govern
ment But those who gain through the
operation of these methods should be made
to understand that the non-partisan scheme
through which they receive their appoint
ments demands from them, by way of re
ciprocity, non-partisan and faithful per
formance of duty under every administra
tion, and cheerful fidelity to every chief.
While they should be encouraged to de
cently exercise their rights of citizenship
and to support through their suffrages the
political beliefs they honestly profess, the
noisy, persistent and partisan employe, who
loves political turmoil and contention, or
who renders lax and grudging service to an
administration not representing his political
views, should be promptly and fearlessly
dealt with in such a way as to furnish a
warning to others who may be likewise dis
posed. THE TARIFF LAW.
I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning the government'
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
ot venturing upon some suggestions touch
ing our present tariff law and its operation.
This statute took effect on the 28th day of
August 1894. Whatever may be Its short
comings as a complete measure of tariff
reform. It must be conceded that it has
opened the way to a freer and greater ex
change of commodities between us and other
countries, and thus furnished a wider mar
ket for our products and manufactures.
The only entire year during which this
law has been in force ended on the 80th day
of June, 1896. In that year our imports in
creased over those of the previous year
more than $6,500,000, while the value of the
domestic products we exported and which
found markets abroad was nearly $70,000,-
000 more than during the preceding year.
Those who Insist that the cost to our peo
ple of articles coming to them from abroad
for their needful use should only be in
creased through tariff changes to an extent
necessary to meet the expenses of the gov
ernment as well as those who claim that
tariff charges m ay be laid upon such article
beyond the necessities of government
revenue, and with the additional purpose of
to increasing their price in our market a
to give American manufacturers and pro
ducers better and more profitable opportu
nities, must agree that our tariff laws are
only primarily justified as sources of revenue
to enable the government to meet the nacet
lary expenses of Its maintenance. Consid
ered as to Its sufficiency in tbis aspect the
present law can by no means fall under just
condemnation. During the only complete
heal year of Its operation it has yielded
nly $8,000,000 more revenue than was re
ceived from tariff duties in the preceding
rear. There was, nevertheless, a deficit be
tween our receipts and expenses of a little
more than $25,000,000. This, however, was
sot unexpected.
The situation was such on December last
even months before the close of the fiscal
rear, that the secretary of the treasury
foretold a deficiency of $17,000,000. The
treat and Increasing apprehension and
timidity In business circles aud the depres
ilon In all activities intervening since that
lime, resulting from causes perfectly well
understood and entirely disconnected with
our tariff lawor operation seriously checked
the imports we would have otherwise re
ceived and readily account for the differ
ence between this estimate of the secretary
and the actual deficiency a well as for a
continued deficit
Indeed, it must be confessed that we could
hardly have bad a more unfavorable period
than the last two years for the collection of
tariff revenue. We cannot reasonably hope
that our recuperation from the business de
pression will be sudden, but it ha already
set irr with a promise of acceleration and '
continuance. I believe our present tariff
law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will in tho
near future yield a revenue which, with
reasonably economical expenditures, will
overcome all deficiencies.
In the meantime no deficit that has oc
curred or may occur need excite or disturb
us. To meet any such deficit we have in the
treasury, In addition to the gold reserve of
$100,000,000, a surplus of more than $128.
000,000 applicable to payment of the. ex
penses of the government and which must,
unless expended for that purpose, remain a
useless hoard, or, if not extravagantly '
wasted, must In any event be perverted from
the purpose of it exaolon from our peo
ple, the payment, therefore, of any defl-1
clencyln the revenue from thla fund la)
nothing more than Its proper and legitlmatA
use. It is immeasurably better to approprf
ate our surplus to the payment of justifiable -expenses
than to allow it to become an invjf
tatlon to reckless appropriations and ex
travagant expenditures.
I suppose it will not be denied (hat nnder
the present law our people obtain the neces-
sarles of a comfortable existence at a
cheaper rate than formerly. This is a mat
ter of supreme Importance, since it I the
palpable duty of every Just government to -make
the burdens of taxation as light a
possible. The people should not be required
to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living '
except under the stress of their govern
ment' necessity made plainly manifest
FINANCIAL.
This reference to the condition and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggest an
allusion to the weakness and vices of our
financial methods. They have been fre
quently pressed upon the attention of the
Congress In previous executive communica
tions and the Inevitable danger of their con
tinued toleration pointed out Without now
repeating these details, I cannot refrain
from again earnestly presenting the neces
sity of the prompt reform of a system op
posed to every rule of sound finance and
shown by experience to be fraught with the .
gravest peril and perplexity. The terrible
civil war which shook the foundations of .
our government more than thirty yearn
ago, brought in its train the destruction of
property, he wasting of our country's sub
stance, anu the estrangement of brethren.
These are now past and forgotten. Even
the distressing loss of life the conflict en
tailed is but a sacred memory, which fos
ters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a
tender regard for those who nobly died.
And yet there remains with us to-day, in
full strength and activity as an incident of
that tremendous struggle, a feature of its
financial necessity not only unsulted to our
present circumstances, but manifestly a
disturbing menace to business security and
an ever present agent of monetary distress.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary
relief from its depressing Influence this
should not lull us into a false security or
lead us to forget the suddenness of past visi
tation. I am more convinced than ever that
we can have not assured financial peace and
safety until the government currency obli
gations upon wnicb gold may be demanded
from the treasury are withdrawn from cir
culation and cancelled. This might be done
as has been recommended, by their exchange
for long term bonds bearing a low rate of
interest or by tbelr redemption with tho
proceeds of such bonds.
Even if only United States notes known as
greenbacks were thus retired It is probable
that the treasury notes issued in payment
of silver purchases under the act ot July
14, 1890, now paid In gold when demanded.
would not create much disturbances, as they
might from time to time, when received In
the treasury by redemptlonof gold or other
wise, be gradually and prudently replaced
by silver coin. This plan of issuing bonds
for the purpose of redemption certainly ap- .
pears to be the most effective and direct
path to the needed reform.
In default of this, however, It would be a
step In the right direction if currency obli
gations redeemable in gold whenever so
redeemed should be cancelled instead of be
ing reissued. This operation would be a
slow remedy, but It would Improve present
Z
conditions.
National banks should redeem their ow
notes. They should be allowed to Issue cir
culation to the par value of bonds deposited
as security for its redemption and the tax
on their circulation should be reduced to
one-fourth of 1 per cent The entire case
may be presented by the statement that the
day of sensible and sound financial method
will not dawn upon us until our government
abandons the banking business and the ac
cumulation of funds, and confines Its mone
tary operations to the receipts of money
contributed by the people for Its support,
and to the expenditure of such money for
the people's benefit Our business Interest
and all good citizens long for rest from f ")
erlsh agitation, and the Inauguration by the
government of a reformed financial policy
which will encourage enterprise and make ,
certain the rewards of labor and Industry.
TRUSTS.
Another topic in which our people right
fully take a deep Interest may. be here
briefly considered. I refer to the expanse of
trusts and other huge aggregations of capi
tal, the object of which Is to secure the mo
nopoly of some particular branch of trade,
industry or commerce, and to stifle whole
some coir, petition. Wncn these are defended
It Is usumiy on the ground that though they
Increase profits, they also reduce prices and
thus may benefit the public It must be re
membered, however, that a reduction of
prices to the people is not one of the
real objects of these organizations,
nor is their tendency necessarily In that
direction. If It occurs In a particular case
It is only because It accords with the pur
poses r interests of those managing their
scheme. -Such occasional results fall short
of couiposlng the palpable evils charged to
the account of trusts and monopolies. Their
tendency is to crush out individual Inde
pendence and to hinder and to prevent tne
free use of human faculties and the full di
de-v
velopment of human character.
Thnnirh Pnnirresn haa attpmntil to Aa
with this matter by legislation, the law J
passed for that purpose thus far have
proved Ineffective, not because of any lack of
disposition or attempt to enforce them but
simply because the laws themselves as In
terpreted by the courts do not reacu the
difficulty. If the insufflclenclta of e.'tlng
laws can be remedied by further kp'slatlon.
It should b. done. The fact must bt recog
nized, however, that all federal legislation
on this subject may fall short of it purpose
becanv; of inherent obstacles, and also
because of the complex character of our
governmental system, which, while making
the federal authority suireme within Its
there, has carefully limited that. sphere by
metes and bounds which cannot be trans
gressed. The decision of our highest court
on this precise question renders It quite
doubtful whether the evils of trusts and mo
nopolies can be adequately treated through
federal action unless they setk directly and
purposely to Include In their objects trans
portation or Intercourse between states or
between the United States and foreign
countries. !
It does not follow, however, that this Is the
llmitof the remedy that may be applied.
Even though It may be found that federal
authority is not broad enoug h to fully reach
the raae. there ran be no dotiht Of the rower
of the several states to act efectively in the
S remises and there should be no reason to
oubt their willingness to judiciously exer
cise such power. In concluding this com
munication Its last words shall be an appeal
to the congress for the most rigid
economy in the expenditure nt
the money it holds In trust for
the people. The way to perplexing extrava-
Sance Is easv, but a return to frugality is
ifflcult When, however. It 1 considered
that those who bear the burdens of taxation
have no guaranty of honest care save In the
fidelity of their reliable servants, the dutv
of all possible retrenchment is plainly man
liest
When our differences are forgotten afid
3SJ-
our contests of political opinion are
longer remembered, nothing In the re
sued of our public service will be as foriiv-
nate and comforting as the recollection of
official duty well performed and the memory
of a constant devotion to the Interests of our
confiding fellow countrymen.
