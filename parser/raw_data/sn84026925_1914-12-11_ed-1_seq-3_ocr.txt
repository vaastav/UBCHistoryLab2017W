Three In One?
Absolute Security! <
Most Liberal Policy Contract!
Lowest Possible Cost!
In the face of existing world-wide '
financial conditions, the Mutual Bene- 1
fit Life-Insurance Company announces j
its third substantial increase in divi- !
dends on premium paying policies in
force on January 1, 1915, of about J
20 per cent over the scale effective <

attention to the facts that the divi- (
dend scale was materially increased <
in 1910 and again in 1912, and that
two special dividends were paid out
in 1913 and 1914, respectively, the
management modestly announces "To
our knowledge the record is one
which has not been equalled by any
other life insurance company." As
an illustration of the increase, we will
take the case of a man 45 years of
age, who took out a $2,000 policy in
1914. The agent very likely told him
that according to the scale then effective,
he might expect a reduction
of $9.14 in the premium in 1915, but
in reality the reduction will be $12.24.
A proportionate increase applies to
all other ages and all kinds of policies
except term. The foregoing information
is given especially for the
benefit of the hundreds of Mutual
Benefit policy holders in York county,
who have learned by experience '
of the goodness and liberality of this
company.
