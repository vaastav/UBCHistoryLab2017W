TO PRESIDENT'S
(Associated Press Night Wire)
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 6.
Launching- of the new session of
congress was completed today with
the delivery by President Harding of
his opening address at a joint ses
sion with the arms delegates in at
tendance. Proposals for a flexible tariff,
adjustable by the president or the
tariff commission, for an indus
trial tribunal and for a constitu
tional amendment to stop the flood
of tax-free securities were the presi
dent's outstanding statements on
domestic affairs.
He said of the arms ' conference
that "a most gratifying world ac
complishment is not jmprobahle." He
also urged enactment of the-measure
for funding the allied debt, proposed
food i relief for starving Russia', ex
pressed satisfaction over the nation
being at peace and held out promise
of aid to the world in war restora
tion. PRESIDENT IS CHEERED
A hearty reception was given the
president by what was said to be
one of the largest audiences ever
jammed into the liquse chamber.
Demonstrations of a minute each oc
curred when he entered and again
when he concluded, the audience
standing and applauding. Applause
also broke into his address frequent
ly, especially from house members,
when he discussed administration
policy, and with special volume
when he advanced his plan for a
tribunal to weigh disputes between
capital and. labor and declared labor
organizations should not be permit
ted to "exact unfair terms of employ
ment or subject the public to actual
distress."
Presentation later of more detailed
views on the shipping situation was
promised by the president in declar
ing he opposed abrogation of com
mercial treaties provided by the
Jones act. A suggestion for a plan
of "reimbursement" to ship opera
tors was accepted as an advance
statement of his previously an
nounced views as to ship subsidies.
SMOOT URGES SPRING TARIFF
Legislation to meet the president's
recommendations for a flexible tariff
was also proposed immediately by
Senator Smoot, republican, of Utah.
The president also emphasized the'
need for agricultural relief. He
urged that improved methods of dis
tribution and marketing of farm pro
ducts be provided, advocating legis
lative assistance to co-operative mar
keting. Railroad freight rates, he
added, were subject of ; just com
plaint by farmers. ' .
Other recommendations included
reclamation and irrigation develop
ment, highway improvement and
measures to remedy the unemploy
ment situation.
The president expressed satisfac
tion over the tax revision law and
its "billion dollar reduction in thej
tax draft on the people" and urging
economy and efficiency, declaring
the budge; system "the greatest
reformation in governmental prac
tices since the beginning of the re
public." RAPS BLOC CONTROL
Party responsibility in government
was stressed by the president in
what some of his hearers regarded
as thinly veiled dislike over the
"bloc department" in congress.

IRELAND UNDER NEW NAME
PLACE AMONG DOMINIONS UNDER TREATY
SIGNED IN ENGLAND; ULSTER IS LEFT OUT
LONDON, Dec. 6.
Ireland was ended in the small hours of Tuesday morning by the signa
ture, in the premier's cabinet room of "a treaty between Great Britain and
Ireland" consisting of 18 articles giving Ireland the title of the Irish Free
State and the same constitutional status as Canada, Australia and other
overseas dominions.
The question of allegiance which had threatended to wreck the nego
tiations was surmounted by permitting members of the Irish parliament
to swear allegiante to the constitution of the Irish Free State and "be
faithful to his majesty the king."
The treaty has to run the gauntlet of the Ulster government and of
the imperial parliament, which has been summoned to meet December 14.
A pproval by parliament is a foregone conclusion.
ULSTER POSITION NOT
KNOWN IN ADVANCE
The position of ,Ulster is less
certain. Evidence comes from -Belfast
that t the . treaty will be sub
jected to the most searching ex
amination and many modifications
may be proposed.
The king hastened to send the
premier a telegram congratulating
him on the success of the nego
tiations. The treaty was signed by all
members of the Irish delegation
participating, the Irish delegates
signing their Gaelic names.
PROVIDE FOR ULSTER'S
BALKING IN PACT
Ireland is treated as a single
entity in the treaty with special,
clauses providing against the pos
sibility that Ulster . should refuse
acquiescence in the settlement in
which case the government of Ire
land act of 1920 will remain in
force so far as the northern parlia
ment is concerned but with the
stipulation that a special commis
sion shall determine new boun
daries for northern Ireland
Provisions also are made for the
co-operation of the two parliaments
in providing certain safeguards in
the event of Ulster remaining out
of the free state. Neither parlia
ment, however, will be permitted
.to make laws endowing any par
ticular religion or to impose any
religious disability.
IRISH OBLIGATIONS
RUN TO MILITARY
The treaty looks to Ireland in
the future to undertake its own
coastal defense and provides that
Ireland shall during war give the
British forces necessary harbor and
other facilities. It further recog
nizes the Irish free state's right to
maintain its own military defense
force.

The century-old quarrel
E ISSUES THAT

The big questions at issue between
the, British government and the rep

parliament have been:
Shall Ireland become entirely inde

for Ulster and one for- the rest of
the country?
Prime Minister Lloyd ' George has
refused to consider any proposal
which would put Ireland outside the
empire.
The sinn feiners refused to admit
that Ireland -should be split in two;
-parts. British representatives submitted a

speech at the opening of the new
parliament in Ulster.
The purpose of the negotiations
now in progress, as defined by
Lloyd George and accepted by the
sinn fein representatives is "to ascer
tain how the association of Ireland
with the community of nations known
as the British empire may he best
reconciled with Irish national aspira
tions." The conferences began in July.
Both sides have at times entertained
higher hopes of a final and satisfac
tory settlement probably than at any
time since the Irish question became
a .thorn in the side of the British
empire, but there have been several
crises when the negotiations seemed
doomed to failure.
The first of these occurred when
Lloyd George offered to de Valera at
consultation' in London a form of
self-government in Ireland something
like that prevailing in the British
dominions. The dail eireann utterly
rejected this proposal on the ground
that it did not afford even genuine
dominion rule. For a time it seemed
that a deadlock had been reached.

This obstacle- was overcome by the
two parties agreeing upon Lloyd

of the conference should be to as

The general understanding was that
the sinn fein delegates insisted that
there must be no partition of Ire
land into the north and south with
different forms of government and'
different relations to the empire.
To reconcile these conflicting view
points, Lloyd George invited Sir
James Craig, the Ulster premier, to
come to London in the .first week in
November, fo talk things over. The
situation was so delicate that Sir
James desired the support and advice
of other Ulster leaders and finally all
the members of the Ulster cabinet
were called to London. Uninist opin

was generally conceded that one of

FIFTY-EIGHTH YEAR
At the end. of a five-day journey
across Arizona and southern Cali
fornia, following a hurried flight
from Prescott last Wednesday night,
Walter H. Alton, former proprietor
of the Arizona Garage here, accused
by Mrs. Mary Rohpeter of swindling
her out of nearly $8,5007 is under ar
rest in, Los Angeles.
This was - learned yesterday in a
telegram from Chief of Police Chas.
A. Jpiies of the southern California
icity to Sheriff Warren G. Davis.
The sheriff's office .immediately
wired to Chief of Police Jones a tele
graphic warrant-for Alton's arrest on
a felony charge of obtaining money
by fraudulent representation, upon
complaint preferred last week- by
Mrs. Rohpeter.
Alton is being held in the Los An
getes cjty., jail pending securing of
extradition papers 'from state authori
tiesatPhoentx and dispatching of a
Yavapai county officer to bring him
back to face trial -in Prescott.
The sheriff's office, it was learned
yesterday, has been kept informed of
the movements of Alton since he left
this city, and has had information
out for his arrest in the principal
southern California cities. He left
Prescott early last -week with- Otto
Nennowitz, traveling in a Cadillac
automobile and a red Cadillac truck;
At a point 35 miles west of Selig-
man, the truck broke down, and Al
ton returned to Prescott. He left
this city again last Wednesday night,
picked up the truck and proceeded
on his way.
A wire from Sheriff Mahoney at
Kingman informed the officers that
Alton had passed Topoc (on Thurs
day. A letfgr written by Nennowitz
from Ash Fork to a friend in this
city, and a postal card from Needles
were turned over by Nennowitz's
friend to the authorities.
Nennowitz, it .was learned yester
day, accompanied Alton in the hope
of securing payment of a debt ot
$1,000' the other is said to have owed
him, and was going to his home in
Pomona. Alton had made out to
Nennowitz a bill of sale to the Cad
illac truck, and told him if he want
ed his money to go along with him
to Los Angeles, where the truck'
could be sold and Nennowitz could
secure his money. The truck. Chief
of Police Jones advised the sheriff's
office, is being- held in Los Angeles
under attachment to satisfy another
debt of Alton's.
It was known by the authorities,
they said, that Alton was heading for
Los Angeles. Two boxes, osten
sibly containing automobile accessor
ies, were shipped late last week to
Los Angeles, at the address of Mrs.
Alton's mother.
It is also said that a man named
Lynch, a former employe of Alton
at the Arizona Garage, now -living in
Pasadena, kept track of Mrs. Roh
peter's movements and notified Al
ton last Wednesday that she had
started for Prescott, thus giving Al
ton time to leave the city.
The sheriff's office yesterday no
tified Chief of Police Jones to let
the truck go under attachment. Ex
tradition papers now in process of
preparation will be taken to Phoenix
for requisition, following which of
ficers will go to Los Angeles after
Alton.
