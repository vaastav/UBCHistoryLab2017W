ceaaatinn of revenue floin the so-oalluj se
ceded Statea during the laat Ikoal vonr, the
inoreaae of the correspondent of the loyal
8tutes has been sufficient to prnduoe a rev
enue during the same year of $8,299,829
90, beingonly $50,000 loan than was derived
from all the states ol the Union during the
previous year. The expenditures show a
still more favorable reault. The amount
expended in 1861 was $13,606,739 Jl. For
the la-it year the amount has been reduoed
to $11,125,36'.! 13, showing a deareaaa of
about $2,491,000 in the expenditures as
compared with the preceding year, and
about$3l750,000aaooiupared with the flaual

niont for the previous year was $4,551,966
98. For the laat fiscal year it was Milm a I
to$2,lt?,8l4o7. These favorable reiulut
are io part owing to the oesaation of mail
service In the insurrectionary Statos, and in
part to a careful review of all expenditures
to that department ia the interest of econ
omy. The efficiency of the postal service,
it is believed, haa also been much iiunrove.i

It also provides for compensation, and
generally, the mode nf making it This, it
would seem, must further mitigate the dis
satisfaction of those who favor perpetual
slavery, and especially of those who are to
reonive the compensation. Doubtless some
of those who are to nay. and not to receive.
will object. Yet the measure is both just
and economical. In a certain sense, the
liberation of slaves is the dtruction of
property property acquired by descent, or
by purchase, the sumo as any other proper
ty. It is nn less trtve for having been often
said, that the people ol the South are not
mora resnonsible tor the original introduo
tion of thia property, than are the people of
the .North; nnd when it is remembered how
unhesitatingly wo all use cotton and sugar.
and shaio the profits of dealing in thetn; it
may not oe quite sate to say, mat tne nootn
has beon more responsible than the North,
tor its oontinuaneo. - if, then, tor a coin
mon objeot, this property is to be suorific.'d.
is it not itut that it bo dona at a common
oharge.
And it, with less money, or money more
easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of
the Union by this means,-than we oan by
the war alone, is it not ulo economical to
doit Let us consider it then. Let us as
certain the Mini wo have expended in the
war since compensated oiuantnpation was
proposed last Maroh, and oonsidur whother,
if thnt measure had been promntly accent
ed, by even some of the slave States, the
seme sutu would - not hnve done more to
close the war, than has been otherwise done
If so, the measure would save money, and,
in that view, would be a prudent and eon
nomicnl measure.' Certainly it is not so easy
to pay mmttMutj as it is to pay nntkinft; hut
it is easier to pay a Airre sum, than it is to
pay aiirrirone. And it is easier to pay
any stun icir wo am anie, than it is
to pay it beore we are able. Fho war re
quires large sums, and requires them at
own. - The aggro gate sum necessary for
compensated . emancipation, ot ' oourse.
would be large. But it would require no
ready cash; nor tho bonds oven, any taster
than the emancipation .progresses. This
might not, and probably would net, close
botbre the and of the thirty-seven years.
And at that time we shall probably have a
hundred millions of Deoule to share tho bur
den, instead of thirty-ono millions, aa now.
And not only ao, but the inoreaso of our
population may lie expected to oontinue for
a long time after that period, as rapidly as
berforai bectttise our territory will not nave
become full, - i do not state ' thia inconsiderately.-
At the aanra ratio of inoreaae which
wo have maintained, on, an average, trout
our. first national oeosus, in 1790, until that
oi IMO,- we should, in 19000, have a popula
tion of 103,208,41 . Aud why may we not
that ratio, far beyond that period? Our
abundant room our broad national home
stead is our - ample resource. Wen our
territory aa limited as are tho British Isles,
very eertainly our population oould not ex
pand aa staled. . Instead ot reoeiviug tbe
foreign born, as now. wa should bo com
pelled io seud partol tbe native bora away.
But auch ia not our condition. We have
two millions nine hundred and sixty-three
thousand square miles. Kurope hat three
millions and eight hundred thousand, with
a copulation averaging seventy-three and
one third person, to the square mile. Why
may not ouroountry, at some time, average
as many? - Is it less fertile? Idas it mors waste
surface, by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts,
or other oauses? Ia it inferior to Kurope in
any natural advantage? If, then, wo are, at
aometinva, to bo as populous as Kurope,
bow soon ? As to when thia uxY bo, we ean
judge by the past and the present, a -to
when it WH.L be, if ever, depends union on
whether, we maintain the Union.. Several
