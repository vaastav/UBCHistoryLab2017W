WORTH THE INVESTMENT.
fe'S Pacific const cities are spentilii?
r* $100,000,000 in preparation for the
- Panama canal. The money is going
* for harbor improvements in Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Portland. Ore.;
i M Soaltlp-and-Tacoraa, Wash; Victoria,
Vancouver, and Prince Rupert, British
. Columbia. A host of smaller
places are making plans In preparation
to tlielr size.
Will the return Justify the investment?
It-seems" as though it must.
AL| A conservative -estimate $75,000.',

fe$T. Shipped to Pacific coast cities. Naturally
this volume of traffic will in:
crease with each succeeding year after-the
opening July, 1913. If the tolls
' on/American cargoes are remitted, as
has been suggested, it will mean be
I'- fore long the building up of a Pacific
ooast empire which will.compete with
' . the"east for the commercial supremacy
of the continent. The reflex acMylty
of this expansion necessarily

land. Transcontinental railroad rates
' ?. will be lowered if the natural laws of
<\ competition ire left free from artifi .

? seem;, that the Pacific coast is overreaching
itself in'expend lug this sum

WRITE COPY EARLY
The newspapers have been co-opcr- in
atlng with the merchants to induce ha
early shopping for the benflt of all of
concrned and It is equally as import- t0
ant that the advertisers furnish the fa
copy early. There is not an idle p<
printer in Fairmont and no extra help Fi
can be picked up to help out in the M
rush season and when help is looked w
for at this season out of town we to
find that their home publishers are tli
demanding their services during the st
lioltdnvs. If r>hnv In In onvlu /*? M .loir
or so In advance at idle or slack times
it will be given better attention. In U
order to keep with the work during U
the holiday season it is necessary for
the force to work overtime and in
some instances ib is almost a duy
day and night job. It is a very trying
situation for the printers but they T
are always willing and ready to do
all in their power, to get along and
I it is more in consideration of their
interests that >ve make the*, request jn
that all adyertising' copy from now ^
up until the end of the hol&ny sea- bc
son be furnished, as far in Advance
as possible. It insures better atteh- te
tion to the advertiing matter; tc
