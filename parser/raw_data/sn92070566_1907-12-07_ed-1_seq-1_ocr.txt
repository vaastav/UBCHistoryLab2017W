The president's message is the
longesl on record. No mention
of statehood is nade: ii recom
mends that campaign expenses
of presidential candidates be
met by an appropriation from
the national treasury : t hat cor
porations be prohibited from con
tributing toward campaign ex
penses; that railroads be grant

ileges; that corporation laws be

juncl ion be limited, and in re
indorsing the proposed law of
employer's liability to workmen,
and the extension of the present
eight-hour law, organized labor
has won a signal victory over
corporate opposition.
The message, in condensed
form, is as follows :
Washington, Dec. 3. President
Roosevelt's annual message to e. ingress
is a voluminous document of nearly
30.000 words, by far the longest mes
sage he has ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of the message Is
the financial condition of the country,
and for which the president lays much
of the blame upon unscrupulous stock
speculators, and says:
"In any large body of men. however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions art
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity, their
example Is a very evil thing for the
community. Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity anil of tem
perament both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
many Innocent people into making in
vestments or embarking in kinds of
business that are really unsound.
When the misdeeds of these successful
1 ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
upon the innocent men whom they
have misled It la a painful awakening,
whenever it occurs; and, naturally,
when it does occur those who suffer
are apt to forge! that the longer it was
deferred the mote painful it would be.
i In the effort to punish the guilty it is
both wise and proper to endeavor so
i far as possible to minimize the dis
tress of those who have been misled by
the guiltv. Yet it is not possible to
refrain because of such distress from
striving to put an end to the misdeeds
that are the ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and. as a means to this end.

sponsible for them. There mav be hon

governmental policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
