British farmers would not Tote for Mr.
Cleveland to be their President. What the
"British farmer wants ia protection.
JOHANN Most, the New York Anarchist,
has been denied a new trial and sentenced to
ne year's imprisonment. Good enough.
A Detroit paper claims that Don Dickin
son "inspired the President's message." This
is a double blunder. The message was not in
spired, and it was G rover Cleveland's.
"We are "waiting to hear Senator Voorhees
make the greatest effort of his life defending
ihe President's free-trade message. Mr. Voor
hees is on record as a protectionist, but that
will not embarrass him at all.
THE wool-growers' association appeal from
the President to the people for aid in the
protection of their interests. Their trust is
tot misplaced, and they will not appeal in
rain. The people will rally to their defense
next November.
The Pall Mall Gazette says: "President
Cleveland's message is a free-trade tract of
the first importance, and ought to be widely
circulated by the Cobden Club." Of course
it ought. The English know a good thing
when they see it.
Chicago has been chosen as the place and
June 19, 1888, the time for holding the
Republican national convention. There
were ten competing cities and the contest was
quit spirited. Chicago ought to be satisfac
tory to all concerned.
The bottom facts are coming out in the Fi
delity Bank case and they are likely to cause
& sensation in social as well as business circles.
Cipher letters between Vice-president Harper
and the pretty clerk Mjss Josie Holmes, are
among the latest revelations.
A SKEPTICAL public may bo excused for
declining to accept the assertion of the
Crown Prince's physicians that the nature of
his Highness's malady has entirely changed.
It is easier to believe that the change is in
the minds of the medical men.
The Rev. Mr. Berry's congregation at
"Wolverhampton are making very earnest
efforts to induce him to decline the Plymouth
Church call, and there are some indications
that he may do so. That would not be very
soothing to the self-complacency of Plymouth
Church people.
It is a significant fact that the English pa
pers did not publish a word of that portion of
the President's message that related to the sur
plus in the treasury, but gave ample space to
Lis free-trade erguments. The surplus is the
Teal question, the other only incidental, but
it was all that interested the English papers.
Mr. Stealet, Speaker Carlisle's private sec
retary, says the rumor that Hon. W. L. Scott,
cf Pennsylvania, is to be made chairman of
the ways and means committee, is not true.
Mr. Mills, of Texas, will head that commit
tee. Mr. Mills is a roaring, rampant free
trader, one of the extremest of the extreme.
The Brooklyn School Board has decided
upon the dismissal of an experienced female

IiT contesting the election of Congressman
"White Mr. Lowry has already succeeded in
showing himself up in a very bad light, and
the more he contests the worse his case looks.
If he wishes to save a fragment of his reputa
tion Mr. Lowry should return to Fort Wayne
in haste and engage in some respectable busi
ness. Col. Alex McClttre, of Philadelphia, who
is trying to run a Democratic paper on a Re
publican basis, is a little disfigured since the
President's message, but rallies feebly, and
tries to prove that Mr. Cleveland really advo
cates protection and not free trade. The
Colonel has evidently read that message with
his paper upside down, or through a glass
darkly.
The Sentinel yesterday contained a dis
graceful attack upon the character of the late
Washington C. DePif'pr. Mr. DePauw was
thought enough of Vhe Democrats to be
their candidate for Lieutenant-governor, and
why the State organ of Democracy should
attack him when dead is a mystery upon
any reasonable theory of honorable journalism
er consistent politics.
The adoption by the State Horticultural
Eociety, yesterday, of resolutions demanding
increased appropriations for the State Library,
In order that that much-neglected institution
may be supplied with modern authorities on
agricultural subjects and agricultural maga
zines is an encouraging move. The penu
riousness of Indiana legislatures with regard
to this library, as well as to numerous other
public institutions, has been disgraceful.
For more than a generation the library has
received only $400 annually for the purchase
and binding of books an amount hardly suf
ficient to maintain a reputable school library.
Unquestionably the State should place in the
library the more valuable and rarer standard
works on all industrial topics, so that they
can be consulted by those who desire tech
nical information. The only reason why
they are not there is that the people have not
demanded them. If they will demand them,
and hold legislators responsible who fail to
provide for them, they need not wait long for
the books. If others will show some of the
spirit manifested by the Horticultural Soci
ety, legislators will begin to understand that
they are elected for something more than to
squabble about petty offices, and force special
sessions for the sake of the beggarly per diem.
BLAINE VEB8U3 CLEVELAND
Mr. Blaine's comments on the President's
message go before the country almost simulta
neous with the message itself, and will be quite
as widely read. They are eminently character
istic. Mr. Blaine is unquestionably one of
the ablest of our public men, pos
sessing a wonderfully alert and active
mind, thoroughly equipped . with facts
and arguments in every department of
public affairs, ne is, withal, an American of
Americans, a thorough believer in American
ideas, and an able champion of the Republican
policy of protection to American industry.
To his strong convictions on these points he
adds a rare faculty of putting things.
Bringing these qualities to bear on the Presi
dent's message, he exposes its fallacies with
merciless logio and riddles it fore and aft with
a fireof mingled logic and satire, argument
and ridicule. Mr. Blaine commenting on
Grover Cleveland's message is like a modern
war steamer, thoroughly armed and equipped
with perfect motive power and the most
deadly armament, steaming around the old-
fashioned, lumbering wooden hulk, and pour
ing deadly broadsides into it from every point
of the compass. The President's message
reads like a string of free-trade platitudes
culled from cyclopedias, text-books and Cob
den Club pamphlets. Mr. Blaine's comments
come fresh and hot from the prolific and
forgetive brain of a man who creates instead
of borrowing ideas and who, instead of re
peating what others have said, says things
for others to repeat. In an argument of this
kind Mr. Blaine "wipes the earth" with
Grover Cleveland. He shows clearly not only
the absurdity but the viciousness of Mr.
Cleveland's free-trade scheme. He ' shows
that the abolition of protective duties would
demoralize and imperil the whole system of
American industry without bringing any
compensating benefit. Would Mr. Blaine,
then, make no reduction of the national rev
enue? Let him answer for himself. He says,
"I would reduce it by a prompt repeal of the
tobacco tax, and would make, here and there,
some changes in the tariff, not to reduce pro
tection, but to wisely foster it." Above all,
he would hold to the central idea of protecting
and developing American industries. He
would amend the tariff to meet the changing
conditions of trade, but he says, "I would
make no change that should impair the pro
tective character of the whole body of the
tariff laws." This is the American ida, the
Republican idea, and true statesmanship. It
was hardly to be expected that Mr. Blaine
could read the President's free-trade platitudes
and fallacies without saying something in
reply, and he has done it in clear and vigorous
fashion.
GOVERNOR. GEAY'S RALLY
The Hendricks Club has issued a call for a
Democratic "grand rally," to be held in this
city on the 11th of January next, that being
the date of the meeting of the State Central
committee. The object of the meeting is to
perfect plans for early organization, fire the
Democratic heart, and otherwise prepare for
next year's campaign. The call is addressed
to Democrats in general, and "particularly
the young Democracy." This means that the
meeting is in the interests of Governor Gray.
The Sentinel says "the young Democracy
are expected to take a prominent part in the
organization movement, and after the meet
ing the delegates will be thoroughly equipped
for the work of organization." Read between
the lines, this means a movement in the inter
ests of Governor Gray and his vice-preai-
dential boom. The Governor claims to be
particularly strong with "the young Democ
racy" of Indiana. Just why he should be we
do not know, unless it is that he is rather a
young Democrat himself not particularly
young in years, but in Democracy. At all
events he has been assiduously cultivating this
element of the Democratic party, and
seems to have gotten a pretty good hold on
them. The present call for the young Democ
racy is notice to McDonald, Voorhees and
other old leaders that Governor Gray proposes
to march at the head of the procession, and
that he and the young Democracy propose to
assume control. This is the meaning of the
call and the purport of the meeting. For the
rest, the Republicans of Indiana will do well
to heed this movement as the beginning of an
early organization and vigorous campaign by
the Democracy. They know they have a big
fight and a hard one before them in this State,
and they prop'ose to make timely preparations.
This is all right. We have no objections to
anything they may do in the way of legiti
mate organization and work. If they will
only refrain from ballot-box stuffing, tally-
sheet forgeries and other frauds, that is all the
Republicans ask. We would like to have a
fair apportionment of the State for legislative
purposes, but that is impossible at present.
We do not expect the Democracy to be fair;
we only ask them not to be dishonest. On
its face, the 11th of January meeting is a
legitimate movement in the direction of
arousing and organizing the party for next
year. Republicans must not be caught nap
ping. Thev must meet organization with or
ganization, and as the Democracy propose to
begin work in January the Republicans must
not defer longer. It will soon be time to beat
the long roll.
The Boston Herald says Mr. David Turpie
is the ablest new man elected to the Senate
by the Democrats for several years; also that
he has more brains than Voorhees, and is a
better debater than McDonald. The Journal
will not venture to dispute any one of these
statements; but' the idea the Herald appar
ently wishes to convey is that Mr. Turpie is
an exceptionally able man, and just to satisfy
a passing curiosity, it would be gratifying to
know where it gained such an impression.
There has been a good deal of vague Demo
cratic talk about Mr. Turpie's ability, but no
specifications, and a large number of Indiana
citizens remain in dense ignorance as to the
precise nature of his talents, and of the man
ner in which they have been displayed.
If the preponderance of political literature
in the paper this week has caused any of the
Journal's readers to overlook the reports of
the Horticultural Association meetings, they
are hereby informed that they have missed
some very good reading and some useful
information. The fact that some of the
speakers of the occasion are theoretical
rather than practical, farmers and fruit
growers, does not militate against the value
of the facts they present. On the contrary,
your theoretical horticulturist is apt to know
a great deal about his subject and to be
most enthusiastic in discussing its mysteries.
Both pleasure and profit are to be gained from
the discussions of this society.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
has fallen absolutely flat. It has excited no
interest whatever. The country has not cared
a continental what Mr. Fairchild proposes to
do, or to know really what he has done. The
fact is conclusive against the President's
assertion of the alarming and perilous con
dition of business, and the excited feeling of
the people. If anything of the kind was, the
case, there would e feverish anxiety to
know the course and policy of the Secretary
of the Treasury. As it is, business is quiet,
the people are calm, and Mr. Fairchild's report
has dropped into Congress with a dull thud. '
ACCORDING to the federal district court of
Texas a citizen of the United States is en
titled to legal rights and privileges superior
to those enjoyed by the citizen of a single
State; or, to put it more plainly, an Indiana
drummer has a right to "drum" in Texas and
to defy the local authorities who would
seek to impose a prohibitory tax upon him.
In demonstrating the fallibility of one phase
of. the States' rights doctrine, the Kansas
salesman, who allowed himself to be arrested
in order to test a principle, has conferred a
favor upon his traveling fellow-countrymen.
The Journal heartily indorses the expres
sion of the New York Times when it says: "A
relatively negative policy will not answer the
purpose of the Republicans. On the contrary,
they must first show the country that they are
prudent, reasonable and fair; and second,
they must prove that they can and - will do
better than the Democrats in the points
where the latter are weak." The Journal is
on record in favor of an active, constructive
policy by the Republican minority. They
should be ready with it as soon as the holi
days are over.
Green Smith says if the contest for Gov
ernor is to be between men of his age and etni
perience, he wishes to be considered an aspir
ant. There are plenty of men of his age, but
none of his experience. His experience in
pretending for two months that he was Lieutenant-governor,
in usurping the duties of the
office, trying to draw a salary to which he
was not entitled and doing many other illegal
and unconstitutional acts makes him a unique
figure in politics. He is his only parallel.
The following from the "Washington special
to the Louisville Courier-Journal is not with
out its mournful cadence:
"Congressman Gay, of Louisiana, i3 Very
much bowed down at the President's message,
ana the more he reads it the stronger he be
comes in his disapproval of the document.
It will certainly, he said, 'have the effect
to make Louisiana a Republican State, and if
a bill is passed based upon the President's mes
sage there will be no hope for the Democratic
paty ever getting any help from the people of
any State interested in the cultivation of
sugar.'"
An attempt to bribe an officer of the gov
ernment is a serious offense, but can a man
who himself stands before the country in the ;
attitude of a bribe-receiver engage in the pros- I
ecution of the guilty person? The only con-'
istent thing Attorney-general Garland can
do is to find a loop-hole of escape for the man .
who approached District Attorney Burnett,
of Cincinnati, with an offer of .$20,000 if he
would "let up" on Harper of the Fidelity1
Bank.
"When the President sends in his supple
mental message giving the operations of that
wonderful man and statesman, Secretary
Bayard, we may get some indication of how,
that fishery commission was organized. It
will then be seen, we think, that Congress is
not "so English, you know" as the adminis
tration, the nsnery conierence ana the tree
trade message are more popular in England
than in America.
The President tries to create a financial
panic by exaggerated talk about hoarding the
people's money, withdrawing it from circula
tion etc. Yet the Treasury report of Dec. 1
shows that the amount of currency in circula
tion, or outside of the Treasury, is $52,000.

A Pittsburg dentist has been sued for $20,-
000 damages by a man -who asserts that through
carelessness in pulling a tooth some months ago
he suffers lameness in one arm and leg to this

of defense that no school nor authority gives in
structions for the pulling of a tooth whose roots
extend into the leg.
According to foreign rumor, Count Tolstoi is
about to resign the office of Russian Minister of
the Interior. Perhaps he needs a new suit of

At any rate, by his resignation ho will have

- There is a very general impression that Presi
dent Cleveland is a fat man. Says a correspond
ent: 'As a matter of fact he is not fat, although
he is stout. His flesh is remarkably firm and
his muscles are remarkably strong, while his
bones are large and well knit. The result is
that he carries himself with more ease, grace
and dignity than most men of half his size, and
suffers very little of the inconvenience over
which fat men as large as he is are constantly
groaning." ,; ... -
John R. Alley, of Boston, who is now in
Paris, is said to be the richest Republican poli

of the Bay State is not financial . in its nature.

During his illness the German Crown Prince
has been much remembered by the Jews on ac
count of his noble defense of them against, the
attacks made upon them in Germany in recent
years, it is recalled that he described this
movement as a blot on German culture, that in
J 879 he visited a Berlin synagogue, and was
present at the charitable concert with the ex
press view, as he himself stated, of proving his
objection to the Jew-hating manifestations; and
that' in 1880 he acknowledged Pastor Grueber's
work On Christians and Israelites with an ex
pression of the "hope that the outbreak of
fanaticism might speedily die away, and that all
denominations might be animated by a sense of

Maurice Thompson, in a contribution to a

The free-trader is a theorist; a doctrinaire;
one who dreams of an ideal world with ideal
governments all on the same commercial, finan
cial and industrial plane. If the world happened
to be in that delectable condition, free trade
would be the grandest of economic theories; but
as the world happens not to be in any such ideal
attitude, the sublime theory of free trade has to
bend to the stubborn practical or be broken in
the conflict. Philadelphia Times (Dem.)

THE PfiSIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Additional Comments and Criticisms by Hon.
James G. Blaine.
The Journal of yesterday printed the larger
portion of an interview with Mr. Blaine, in
which he commented on the President's mes
sage. A part of the interview was delayed, and
it is presented below. In response to the ques
tion, "Don't you think it important to increase
our export trader Mr. Blaine eaid:
"Undoubtedly; but it is vastly more impor
tant not to lose our own great market for our
own people in the vain effort to reach the im
possible. It is not our foreign trade that has
caused the wonderful growth and expansion of
the Republic. It is the vast domestic trade. be
tween thirty-eight States and eight Territories
with a population of perhaps 62,000,000 to-day.
The whole amount of our expert and import
trade together never, I think, reached $1,900,
000.000 any one year. Our internal home trade
on 130,0OP miles of railway, along 15,000 miles of
ocean coast, over the five great lakes and along
20.000 miles of navigable rivers, reaches the
enormous annual aggregate of more than $40,000,
000.000, and perhaps this year $50,000,000,000.
'-It is to this illimitable trade, even now in its
infancy, and destined to attain a magnitude not
dreamed of twenty years ago, that Europeans
are struggling to enter. It is the heritage of the
AmeSMban people, of their children, and of their
children's children. It gives an absolutely free
trade over a territory nearly as large as all Eu
rope, and the profit all onr own. The genuine
free-trader appears unable to see or comprehend
that this continental trade not our exchanges
with Europe is the ereat source of our prosper
ity. President Cleveland now plainly proposes
a policy that will admit Europe to share this
trade."
"But you are in favor of extending our for
eign trade, are you not!"'
"Certainly I am. in all practical and advanta
geous ways, but cot on the principle of the free
traders, by which we shall be constantly exchang
ing dollar for dime. Moreover, foreign trade is
often very delusive. Cotton is manufactured in
the city of my residence.' If a box of cotton
goods is sent 200 miles to the Province of New
Brunswick, it is foreign trade. If shipped 17,
000 miles ronnd Cape Horn to Washington Ter
ritory it is domestic trade. The magnitude of
the Union and the immensity of its internal
trade require new political economy. Treatises
written for European states do not grasp our
peculiar situation.
"How will the President's message be taken
In the South?"
"I don't dare answer that qnestiou. The truth
has been so long obscured Dy certain local ques
tions and unreasonable: prejudice that nobody
can hope for industrial enlightenment Jimong
their leaders just yet. But in my view, the
South, above all sections of the Union, needs a
protective tariff. The two Virginias, North Car
olina, Kentucky, Missonri, Tennessee, Alabama
and Georgia have enormous resources and facil
ities for developing and handling manufactures.
They can not do anything without protection.
Even a progress so vast as some of those States
made will be checked if the President's message
is enacted into a law. Their Senators and Rep
resentatives can prevent it, but they are so used
to following anything labeled 'Democratic' very
probably they will follow the President and
blight the progress already made. By the time
some of the Southern States get free iron ore
and coal, while tobacco is taxed, they may have
occasion to sit down and calculate the value of
Democratic free trade to their local interests."
"Will not the President's recommendation to
admit raw material find strong support?"
"Not by wise protectionists in our time. Per
haps some greedy manufacturers may think that
with free coal or free iron-ore they can do great
things, but if they should succeed in trying they
will, as the boys, say, catch it on the bound. If
home-trade in raw material is destroyed or seri
ously injured, railroads will be the first to feel it.
If that vast interest is crippled in any direction,
the financial fabric of the whole country will feel
it quickly and seriously. If any man can give a
reason why we should arrange the tariff to favor
the raw material of other countries iu competi
tion aeainst our material of the same kind. I
should like to hear it. Should that recommenda
tion of the President be approved, it would turn
100,000 American laborers out of employment
before it had been a year in operation."
"What most be the marked and general effect
of the Presidents message:
"It will bring the country where it ought to
be brought to a fuIL fair contest on the ques
tion of protection. The President himself
makes it one issue by presenting no other in his
message. I think it well to have the question
settled, lne Democratic party in power is a
standing menace to the industrial prosperity
of the country. That menace should be re
moved, or the policy it foreshadows should be
made' certain. Nothing is so mischievous to
business as uncertainty, nothing so paralyzing
as doubt."
What the Southern Iron Men Think of It.
Birmingham (A).) Special to Cincinnati Enquirer.
To say that Cleveland's message was a sur
prise to the iron men of this city would express
it mildly. In thu immediate district there are
now in coarse of erection twelve furnaces and
about two thousand coke ovens, and the owners
of these enterprises did not expect any tariff
reduction for several years at least.
H.-M. Caldwell, president of the Elyton Land
Company, which recentlv commenced the erec
tion of large car-works, engine and boiler-works
and other industries, said: "The message is
very- unfortunate for the party and for the
business interests of the country, : but I don't
think it will affect this section very materially.
We will go on with our works, for it is not
probable that any reduction of the tariff will be
made at this session of Congress."
Ex-Congressman G. W. Hewitt (Democrat),
who is interested in manufacturing says: "I
am ont of politics, but I cannot agree with
Cleveland's policy. If that is Democracy.
this section doesn't want any of it. I would
favor Randall for President, but I fsar Cleve
land willTe renominated."
A prominent furnace owner said: "The issue
before the country now is protection or free
trade, and protection will win. None of the
Birmingham furnace?," he continued, "will shut
down on account of the message, for if there is
any place in the United States where manufact
urers can live under free trade this is the place;
but we don't want any free trade." '
Summed up, the opinion of leading manufact
urers here is that the message will defeat the
Democratic party next year, and will also have
the effect of stopping further investments in
manufacturing until there is a new administra
tion.
The Daily Age, of this city, the leading pro
tection paper of the South, says editorially that
all party lines are now obhberated. There will
no longer be Democrats or llenublicans. but pro
tectionists and free-traders. This opinion is in
dorsed by business men and manufacturers of
the citj'.
Press Comment.
Cincinnati Commercial Gazette: The President
has hoisted the standard of his part v. It is tha
cold-wave flag, and Democrats will govern them
selves accordingly.
Memphis Avalanche: It is the kev-note of the
campaign, and with it Cleveland and the Demo
cratic party must stand or fall. It has about it
something that is prophetic of success, and yet
it brings with it the mnrmor of a battle fiercer
than any which has yet been waged in the polit
ical history of America.
Kansas City Journal: The general influence
of his message will be to add to the confusion of
his party; for he suggests no compromise). Mr.
Randall must take the Carlisle-Cleveland dose.
The direct internal revenue taxes must remain
and the indirect protection tariff taxes must be
cut and slashed until the free-traders are satis
fied with the confusion and ruin accomplished.
Philadelphia North American: Nor does the
President remember that the seven millions,
classed as farmers are. by the diversification of
industry through protection, furnished with a
swift and convenient home' marKet tor tneir
proaucts. Wipe out any of the thriving manu
facturing, towns in Pennsylvania, and what
would happen to real estate held for production
within a radius of ten miles? Will - it be neces
sary to inform the President that in that case
the farms would decline in value simply because
their earnings would fall to a minimum? Does
be, does anybodv. believe that the farmers iu
the neighborhood of great industries do not be
lieve themselves benefited by the existence of
those industries?
Milwaukee Sentinel: The President adopts in
bis message the usual assumption of free-traders
that the tariff adds to the priee paid by the con
sumers of the products of protected industries
the full amount of the tariff on imported articles
of a like nature, an assumption which has no
warrant in facta He concedes that there may
be occasional exceptions to the rule, but asserts
that combinations and trouts are formed in such
eases to put up the price. This assertion is not
generally true, while, with our home market in
the control of foreigners, similar combinations
among foreign manufacturers would be formed
for the same purpose. Such combinations are
npt confined to the United States, and are as
readily formed in England or t ranee as here.
Louisville Commercial: President Cleveland's
tariff sky-rocket ia still In the air, the delight of
a few and the wonderment of all. He has done
what certain Democratic party leaders have not
bad the courage to do announce fearlessly the
doctrine of free trade. Ha avoids the verbose
generalities of Carlisle and the glittering (petor
inktums of Watterson and goes deliberately to
work to commit his party to an advanced posi
tion on the tariff. The Commercial has
never doubted Mr. Cleveland's aggressive)
integrity. He is sincere about the tar
iff. In his opinion free trade would in
crease the prosperity of the country, and he
handles the subject in his free and honest
fashion. But what will be the effect in the cam
paign of 1888? Can the Democratic party afford
to retreat from the course so plainly marked out
by its acknowledged leader? Whatever may be
the fate of the tariff bill at this session of Con
gress, Mr. Cleveiana will co - before the country
next year as a confessed free-trader. Will such,
a policy cot array the manufacturing, wool
growing and tobacco interests solidly against
him?
The Message and a Tariff BilL
Philadelphia Inquirer: The message settles
it The three leading issues next year will be
protection, pauperism and prohibition if the
American party shall present a fourth it will be
patriotism.
New York Mail and Express: The next cam
paign will be a battle between protection and
free trade, and it will be a wholesome, vigorous
political cont. with the chances largely in
fator of the Rerublicans. . .
Detroit Tribune: There is only one way to
compete with Great Britain in a free-trade
basis, and that is to reduce the scale of wages in
this country to the low level of that established
in England. This the American workingmen
will never consent to, and they cover ought to
be asked to. But it is just what the free-traders
in this country are trying to force them to do.
A workingman who supports a free-trader or a
free-trade measure is working to reduce his own
income.
Pittsburg Dispatch: If the President could
formulate a tariff message which would
fulfill the standards of bis message; if
he could show us , bow to reduce du
ties without either destroying the profits of the
manufacturer or lowering the wages of the
laborer; if he can keep up the rewards of pro
duction in certain departments and yet lower the
cost of the products to consumers; if he cau take
the duty off articles which are not produced at
home and yet keep it on articles of luxury ex
ported from abroad, he will be able to command
the undivided support of the whole Nation with
out regard to party. But as this involves some
direct contradictions, co specific recommenda
tions are made, and it will prove somewhat
difficult for the President's friends in Congress
to reduce these generalities to the specific enact
ments of a tariff bilL
THE CHRISTIAN CONFERENCE.
Social and Economic Topics Discussed by Some
of the Ablest Men of the Country.
Washington, Dec. & At the opening of the
second morning session of the conference which
is being held under the auspices of the Evan
gelical" Alliance for the United States, nearly -every
seat in the First Congregational Church
was occupied. After devotional exereises, the
presiding officer, Justice Harlan, of the United
States Supreme Court, introduced Rev. S. W.
-Dike, of Auburndale, Mass., who read a paper
on "Perils to the Family." In the course of his
paper Mr. Dike said that the American family U
not strong enough for the strain upon it from,
our social condition. Perils threaten in " three
particulars. As a social production our failures
with the family are dangerously numerous. In
some States five, ten or twelve percentum of the
families formed annually suffer dissolution in
the courts. Fatal troubles increase this num
ber. Unchaslity corrupts many families, and
criminal practices render others ' unfruitful,
leaving the lower classes to replenish popula
tion. Probably all these evils are on the in
crease. Divorces certainly are. No christian
country, he said, takes greater risks from, loose
marriage and divorce laws than the United
States. The fundamental place of the family in
society gives grave significance to these perils.
Historically the family is the germ of all other
social institutions, and it is their living tissue.
Weakness here is most dangerous. The paper
urged the Alliance to secure closer fellowship
between scholars in the social sciences and the
clergy, whereby the latter could get the benefits
of the new material and better methods of the
former.
CoL J. G. Green, of Hartford, Conn. , then read
a paper on "The Social Vice." He said thai;
every kind of lawlessness instinctively recog
nizes the family as a foe, and seeks to corrut t
and weaken it. The reproduction of human life
is the highest function of which human beings
are capable. But uot only the genesis, but all
that go to shape and train it are of moment.
The speaker named among the more dangerous
and more unnoticed agencies for promotion of
the social vices, first, the public school, with its
inevitable mingling of the pure and the impure,
where evil influences are as rife as fungi in a
swamp. The White Cross work is especially
needed, here. The novel, against which , we do
not nowadays hear the protest that we ought, is
dangerous. Pure fiction does not constitute the
bulk of that published. A vast number read
almost nothing except highly-spiced impure
fiction. The sensational, scandal-mongering
press is the close ally of impure fiction. The eyes
of journalism are turned into every corner, and
its wonderful acumen is largely employed to dis
cover that which is poisonous. Art, in painting,
sculpture and music, which may and often does
disseminate impure suggestions, is the most
dangerous way of all. The saloon is another
exceedingly fruitful seed-bed for the germs of
impurity. The church must do more than merely
avoid and hold its skirts from contamination.
We must make an aggressive as well as a mere
defensive warfare. The church must teach
parents, and they must teach children. But in
outside nelds that the cnurcn cannot reacn, tna
White Cross work can do much, and should be
pushed.
Mr. bimon tu. uaiawin. or the racuity ox
New Haven Law School, said he thought the.
Greeks, and Romans, and ancient nations gen
erally were wisest in making the father the
priest. In this respect, he thought the Roman
Catholic church does better than others.
A Voice I don't recognize it as a Christian
church at alL ...
"I have found, in work done in .connection
with Mr. Dike, that the Catholic church has
often given us most efficient help," responded
Mr. Baldwin.
President Dodge said that the alliance has al
ways co-operated heartily with the Catholio
church for all that is good, although it naa Deen
obliged to protest against the ultramontane at
tar fe upon our public schools.
President John Eaton, of Marietta College,
Ohio, late United States Commissioner of Edu
cation, then read a paper on "Illiteracy, in the
course of which he said that illiteracy is a
measure of ignorance, a sign of darkness, an in
vitation to fraud, a cover to iniquity. Illiter
acy is hostile to man's welfare, hinders industry
and prosperity, obstructs virtue and imperil
piety. If knowledge is power, ignorance is
weakness, and becomes a temptation to per
verted intelligence. In eleven fatates the
ignorant voters, if combined, outnumber
the votes cast for either of the political
parties, and could control their legislation and
administration and elect twenty two United
States Senators and a corresponding number of
the national House of Representatives. - How
do 'they everywhere invite bribery, perjury, in
competency and betrayal of trust! Something
more than eternal vigilance is required to settle
the vast and complicated questions before u
and preserve the nice balance of our political
forces. The Nation must aid in the work of
education- Were there no illiterate Indians
Mormons, Chinese or other foreigners or
natives, white or black, all our great problems
would be greatly simplified.
President A u cell, of Michigan University.
presided at the afternoon session and introduced
president James McCosh. D. D-, "f Princeton
College, who read a paper on "The Church iu
Relation to the Capital and Labor Question."
. At the close of Dr.vMcCosh's address, a cable
gram expressing the gj-mpathy of the council of
the English Evangelical Alliance nowftin session
in London, was read to the conference.
Hon. Seth Low, of Brooklyn, followed Dr. Mc-
Cosh and spoke on the same topic.
A general discussion of the subject followed,
in which Rev. A. CL Schade, of Cleveland, ).,
took a- prominent part.
To-night a paper on - i ne v-iinstiau resources
of our Country, was read by Rev. James M.
