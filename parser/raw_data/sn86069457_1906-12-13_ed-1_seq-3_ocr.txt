was no power to act on his resignation
and the government came to a halt In

amendment which was embodied In the
constitution of Cubw I thereupon pro

satisfactory speed and efficiency The
Insurgent chiefs immediately agreed that

The Illo Coufereiie
ThP second International conference of
American republics held In Mexieo In
the vears Vk1 2 provided for the holding
of the third confeience within five ears
and committed the Hating of the time and
place and the arrangements for the con

bureau of American republics composed
of the repiesentatlves of all the Ameil

discharged the duty Imposed upon it
with marked fidelity and painstaking
care and upon the courteous Invitation
of the Inlteil State of Ilrazll the con
ference was held t Rio de Janeiro con
tinuing fiom the 23d ot July to the 2th
of August last Many subjects of com
mon Interest to all the Aineiican nations
were distusjt by the conference and the
conclusions reached embodied In n scries
of resolutions and proposed conventions
will he luid before you upon the coming
In of the final report of the American
delegates The contain iiiunv matters
of Inipoi tiime relating to the extension
ot trade the increase of laimmuulcatlou
the smoothing uwny of barriers to free
Intel 1 nurse and the promotion of a bet
ter knowledge and good understanding
between the dlfterent countries lepiesent
eel The meetings of the eonfeience wcr
reached with substantial ummimlt It
Is Interesting to observe that iu the suc
cessive onleietices which have been
held the representatives of the dlffeient
American nations have been learning to
work together effectivel for while the
first conference Iu Washington in liW
and the second conference In Mexico In
occupied ninny months with much
time wated in un unregulated mid fruit
less dlsi usslon the third conference at
Illo exhibited mm h of the fadllty In the
practical despatch ot business which
characteilzes the permanent deliberative
bodies and completed its Inborn within
the peilod of six weeks originally allot
ted for its sessions
Quite apart from the specllle vulue of
the conclusions leached by the confer
ence the example of the representatives
of ail the American nations engaging in
harmonious and kindly consideration and
discussion of subjects of common Inter
est Ih Itself of gieat nnd substantial
vnlue for the promotion of reasonable
and considerate treatment of all Interna
tional questions The thnnks of this
country are due to the government of
JJrazll and to the people of Hlo de Ja
neiro for the generous hospitality with
which Our delegates In common with
the others wer received entertained and
facilitated In their work e
Incidentally to the meeting of the con
ference the secretnry of state visited the
city of Hlo de Janeiro and was cordially
received by the conference of which he
was made an honorary president The
announcement of his Intention to make
this visit was followed by the most cour
teous and urgent Invitations from near
ly all the countries of South America to
visit them as the guest of their govern
ments It was deemed that by the ac
ceptance of these Invitations we might
appropriately express the real respect
and friendship In which we hold our sis
ter republics of the southern continent
and the secretary accordingly visited
Brazil Uruguay Argentina Chill Peru
lanama nnd Colombia He refrained
from visiting Paraguay Bolivia and
Ecuador only because the distance to
their capitals from the seaboard made It
impracticable with the time at his die
nasal He carried with him a message
of peace and friendship and of strong
the greatest empire and we deem the ob
servance of that respect the chief guar
anty of the weak against the oppression
of the strong We neither claim nor de
sire any rights or privileges or powers
that we do not freely concede to every
American republic Vc wish to lncreae
our pruspemv to sxtend our triili to
grow in wealth In wisdom and In spirit
but our conception of the true way to ac
complish this Is not to pull down others
and profit hy their ruin but to help all
menus to a common prospernv ami a
greater and stronger together Within a
Xovv months for the first time the recog

pledge ourselves to aid each other In thu
full performance of the duty to humanity
which that incepted dei lnratlnn Implies

upon behalf ot the American people
with all poslble solemnity our most
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize the Imperative need of pre
serving Justice and keeping order In the

morally and material and wishes noth

be able to preserve order among them

becomes continued In the Island it Is ab
solutely out of the question that the

generous hopltnllty to him
In in miswHge to you on the 5th of

the unbirro smcnt that might be caused
to this government by the duertlon by
foreign nations of the right to collect by

Amirlcan republics to citizens of the col

process cif compuNory collection might

Our own government hus always re

This subject was one of the topics of
consideration at the conference at Hlo

The traditional policy of the United
States which without accentuating su

demned the oppression of the nations of

It is gratifying to know that In the

arches which spanned the streets en
twined with Argentine and American
flags for the reception of cur representa

This resolution was supported by tho I Jnj om jo uonuvjasojd puu iioijiioji1
representatives of the Inlted State In
accordance with the following Instruc
tions
It has long been the established pollcv
of the Inlted States not to uso Its armed
forces far the collection of ordinary con
tract debts due to Its citizens by other
governments We have not considered
the ue of force for such n purpose con
sistent with that respect for the Inde
pendent sovereignty of other members of
the famll of nations which Is the most
Important principle of International law
and the chief protection of weak nntlons
against the oppression of the strong It
seems to us that the practice Is Injurious
In Its general effect upon the relations of
nation und upon the welfare of weak
and dlordered states whoe development
ought to be encouraged In the Interests of
civilization that It offers frequent temp
tation to bullying and oppression and to
unnecessary ami unjustinnuie wnrrare
We regret that other powers whose opin
ions and ene of Justice we esteem high
ly have at tlmea taken a different view
and have permitted themelves tho we
believe with reluctanre to collect such
debts by force It li doubtless true that
tho nonpayment of public debts may be
aocompnnled by such circumstances of
fraud and wrongdoing or violation of
treaties as to Justify the use of force
This government would be glad to see an
International consideration of the subject
which shnll discriminate between such
cases nnd the simple nonperforvuce of
a contract with a private persoriTTind a
resolution In favor of reliance upon peace
ful means In cases of the latter class
It Is not felt however that the con
ference at Rio should undertake to make
such a dlscr mlnatlon or
such a rule Most of the
the Hlo conference the
that ot Mexico to unite In effective medl
Uon between the warring republics
which mediation resulted not without
long continued and patient effort In
bringing about a meeting of the repre
sentatives of the hostile powers on board
a United States warship as neutral terri
tory and peace was there concluded a
peace which resulted In the saving of
thousands of lives and in the prevention
of an Incalculable amount of misery and
the destruction of property and of the
means of livelihood The Illo conference
the following resolution In reference
o this action
That the third International American
conference shall address to the presidents
of the Inlted States of America and of
the Inlted States of Mexico a note In
which the conference which Is being held
at Hlo expresses Its satisfaction at the
happy results of their mediation for the
celebration of peace between the repub
lics of Guatemala Honduras and Sal
vador
This nffords an excellent example of
one way In which the Influence of the
United 8tates can properly be exercised
for the benefit of the peoples of the west
ern hemisphere that Is by action taken
In concert with other American republics
and therefore free from those suspicions
and prejudices which might attach If the
action were taken by on alone In this
way It Is possible to exercise a powerful
Influence towaru tne suDsinuiion 01 con

Central America
Last June trouble which had existed for
some time between the republics of Sal
vador Guatemala and Honduras culmi
nated In war a war which threatened to
be ruinous to the countries involved and
very destructive to the commercial Inter
ests of Americans Mexicans and other
foreigners who are taking an Important
part In the development of these coun
tries The thoroly good understanding
uVitith ovists hetwean thn tniltpil Htntfa
desire for good understanding and unj Mexico enabled this government and
tual helpfulness and he was everywhere
received In the spirit ot his message The
members of government the press the
learned professions the men of business
and the great masses of the people
united everywhere In emphatic response
to his friendly expressions and In doing
honor to the country and cause which
he reprekented
In many parts of South America ther
has been much misunderstanding of the
attitude nnd purposes of the United
States toward the other American repub
lics An Idea had become prevalent that
our assertion of the Monroe doctrine Im
plied or carried with it an assumption
of superiority and of a right to exercise
come kind of proteotorate over the coun
tries to whose territory that doctrine ap
plies Nothing could be farther from the
truth Yet that Impression continued to
be a serious barrier to good understand
ing to friendly Intercourse to the intro
duction of American capital nnd the ex
tension of American trade The impres
sion was so widespread that apparently It
could not be reached by any ordinary
