STATE GRANGE'S
THE ELECTION OF MR. HULL AS
MASTER TO 8UCCEEO
MR. HORTON.
EX-MASTER. HAS HOLD YET
Full List of Official Staff With Re
marks Made by Retiring and Incom
ing Masters.
N. P. Hull, of Dimondale. Thursday
morning at Saginaw was elected mas
ter of the Michigan state grange, de
feating Geo. B. Horton, the present
incumbent, by a vote of 17C to 1C4.
The fight was bitterly contested.
Horton has been president of the
grange for 18 years.
The most intense excitement pre
vailed during the balloting, but It was
suppressed and the drop of a pin could
be heard. When the result was an
nounced a tremor of sighs passed
through the great hall and then Hull
was cheered. The Hull faction fairly
danced In their seats with glee. The
victory was the most sensational
event that ever has occurred In the
Michigan state grange.
Horton kept up a stoical front and
although visibly crushed by his de
feat, which he did not expect, he pro
fessed to be thoroughly satisfied with
the result.
"It is the grange's right," he said.
The list of officers as elected follow:
MasterNathan P. Hull, Dimondale.
Overseer Charles A. Van Deventer,
Ithaca.
Lecturer Miss Jennie Buell, Ann
Arbor.
.Steward T. E. Nlles, Mancelona,
re-elected.
Assistant Steward Leon Haybark-
er, Leroy.
Chaplain Mrs. O. J. C. Woodman,
Paw Paw, re-elected.
Treasurer Frank Coward, Bronson.
Secretary J. W. Hutchlns, Han
over, re-elected.
Gatekeeper G. A. Whitbeck, Mon
tague, re-elected.
Ceres Mrs. A. J. Kellogg, Ferry,
re-elected.
Flora Mrs. Ella Morrice, Harbor
Springs.
Pomona Miss Nellie Mayo, Ceres-
co, re-elected.
Lady Assistant Steward Mrs. Ida
Haybacker, Leroy.
Members of executive committee
(two years) George B. Horton. Fruit
Ridge; T. H. McNaughton. Ada; M.
H. Burton, Hastings; L. W. Ovlatt,
Bay City.
Mr. Horton, now that a new master
Iselected, is still a power In the coun
cil and policy of the grange, having
been elected a member of the execu
tive committee, which means that a
conservative course will be continued.
The convention reaffirmed the decla
ration of the grange in favor of a
state-wide prohibition law. A motion
to Indorse the Anti-Saloon league local
option work was objected to by one
delegate, who said he had heard re
ports of grafting in Anti-Saloon league
circles. However, the resolution was
adopted with but three dissenting
votes.
The question of government owner
ship or control of public utilities
caused considerable discussion. The
resolution finally adopted declares un
conditionally for government control,
government ownership to follow in
case the desired results do not come
from government control. The ques
tion of the taxation of mortgages was
finally settled by declaring in favor of
a specific tax on all mortgages to be
paid at the time of filing in addition
to the regulation registration fee. New
York state has such a law and It nets
a revenue of $1,000,000 annually.
Another declaration was in favor of
re-enacting an old law which gives
land owners control of a strip along
all highways eight feet from the
fence. The purpose Is so farmers can
improve appearances of these strips
and also so they can legally prevent
telephone and telegraph companies
from setting poles where they are ob
stacles, and also from stringing wires
so as to Injure shade trees. Next
vear's convention will be in Traverse
City.
No Experiments on Cattle.
The foot and mouth disease in Mich
igan will form the basis of no expert
menting for the sake of science. No
one knows this quite so well as Henry
H. Hinds, of Stanton, senior member
of the Michigan live stock commission
It has come to light that Mr. Hinds
proposed to Secretary Wilson that two
or three of the diseased animals be
kept for scientific purposes. His Idea
was that those animals should be care
fully observed, and that an effort be
made to secure more exact Informa
tion about the scourge.
It is related that the grizzled sec
retary of agriculture did not say a
word for a-rninute or two after that
proposition had been made. He Just
sat still and eyed Mr. Hinds with the
businesslike gleam of the Scotchman
who knows his own mind. At length
he said:
"No. sir. Those critters will be
slaughtered Just as quick as we can
kill them legally. We know too much
about the disease already.
No criminal cases appear on the
docket for this term of the Washte
naw circuit court.
While sweeping snow off the curb
ing over the cistern back of her resi
dence Miss Mary Kennedy, of Bay
City, evidently slipped and fell in.
Answering a knock at the door, Mrs
Frank Brown, of Lapeer, found an old
man leaning against- the porch rail
Ing. He asked for a drink of water
and she Invited him in. When she re
turned with the water and some cam
phor to revive him, she found him
dead. He proved to be Edward Col
lard, aged 86, an old soldier.
W. N. Falling, of Kalamazoo, who
has been searching for members of
his family, after long absence from
home, has learned that his sister,
Evelyn Tlbbals. for a time worked In
the Michigan Insane asylum, where
her half eiRter. Mls Delia A. Jones
unknown to her. was a natient.
THOSE RELIEF SUPPLIES.
Alpena Merchants Protest That Their
Business Suffers.
As a result of protests raised by
merchants of Alpena, the executive
committee of the fire relief commis
sion has decided to cut off immedi
ately the distribution of clothing, and
laid plans whereby a supply of pro
visions will be discontinued gradually
until Jan. 15. Then the distribution
of these articles will also close.
Business In Alpena since the fire in
October has been paralyzed by the
overflow of relief which poured in
from all sides of the state; many of
the families are better supplied now
than they ever were before, but some
still make demands on the relief sta
tion. Merchants could see no let up to
the supply, and asked the state com
mittee to discontinue the work.
The relief committee now has on
hand about fifteen carloads of cloth
ing, which will be shipped to cities in
proportion to the contribution made
by them, to be used among their own
poor.
The matter of harvesting machinery
and seed is now up to the state. Many
contributions already collected are
sufficient to supply provisions for a
time, but when this is exhausted the
people, homeless by reason of forest
fires, will be left to shift for them
selves. This many are now able to do.
Lumber for building Is now, the only
real necessity.
The action of the committee will no
doubt cause protest from the flre suf
ferers, but the merchants have suf
fered equally and think their kick
legitimate.
Beet Sugar and the Tariff.
"We don't care a whoop," said M. J.
Blaly, manager of the West Bay City
Sugar Co., when asked what he thinks
about the agreement between Taft and
the ways and means committee at
Washington, providing for the admis
sion of 300,000 tons of sugar from the'
Philippines annually free of duty, and
that ail sugar over that amount will
pay the present rate of duty, which Is
25 per cent less than the duty imposed
by the Dlngley tariff on sugar from
other countries.
"We'll make sugar Just the same,"
added Blaly. "It'll hurt some."
"Lesser of two evils; better than
free sugar," Is what W. E. Cressey, of
the German-American company, says.
That company will continue to pro
duce as before..
MICHIGAN BREVITIES.

while doing his herolo act.
Mrs: Joseph Desonla, of Saginaw,

GLEAII GET AlVAY
THE POSTOFFICE AT SAULT STE.
MARIE ROBBED BY THREE
THUGS.
DEPUTY SANDBAGGED
Was Making Up Pay Envelopes When
The Thieves Entered Inquiring for
Mail.
Twenty-five hundred dollars was
taken from the Sault Ste. Marie Dost
office Sunday night by three unknown
men, who committeed one of the most
daring crimes in the history of the
upper peninsula.
Frank HIggins. deputy postmaster,
was placing money in the pay enve
lopes about 8:30 when the three men
entered, knocked him unconscious and
escaped with the money.
lligglns is now in the hospital and
the country Is being scoured by of
ficers. The Canadian officers are work
ing on the case with those of the
American Soo.
HIggins was alone in the nostofflce
when the two men knocked at his of
fice door.
"My name is Robinson." said the
taller of the two, "and I would like to
get my mall now. if you don't mind,
because I am to leave town early lu
the morning, before the postofflce will
be open."
HIggins turned toward his desk and
one of the men struck him heavily
over the head with a sandbag.
Rushing to the desk, the men swept
off all the money and walked out
quietly.
HIggins lay several hours In a pool
of blood and finally gained strength
enough to crawl from the building. He
told the authorities at first he had
been stabbed in the back.
The robbery was not discovered till
nearly midnight. Patrolman Charles
Roberts saw the men leave the door
on the Portage avenue side of the
building, but thought they were from
the Sault club, which Is located on the
third floor. The burglars turned the
corner at Portage avenue and went
east, toward the ferry, probably going
over Into Canada.
HIggins was seen by Roberts to
collapse on the sidewalk. When he
wrnt to his assistance HIggins said:
They hit me." He was then taken to
a hospital. Later he revived enough
to tell the story of the robbery.
Postmaster Scott was Immediately
notified of the robbery. He thinks It
strange the men knew HIggins was
making out his pay roll at that hour.
Mr. Loud and the Filipinos.
Rep. Loud, of Michigan, wants to be
transferred from the house commit
tee on education to the committee on
insular affairs. It Is probable that 11
Mr. Cannon can see his way clear the
Au Sable man will get what he wants.
Mr. Loud believes that this govern
ment is not doing all it should for the
little brown brother. The Filipino Is
now taxed for the support of his
schools, but Mr. Loud points out that
a great many children under a certain
age have been compelled to stop going
to school because there Is not money
enough to go around. The Michigan
man thinks this government can afford
to spend some money of Its own in
order to give all the children a chance
to learn.
When the Governor Will Talk.
"What have I to say about the con
dition of the state treasury and the
causes for its depletion I shall say in
my message to the legislature, Jan.
1," said Gov. Warner.
The governor Is back from his out
ing trip to Florida, looking fine, and
he says he feels as fine as he looks.
"I am looking up the facts in con
nection with the trepury," he added.
"I shall go to Lansi.g this week, and
be there during the two weeks before
the legislature meets. I will not talk
about any state matters till my mes
sage is delivered."
Mr. Rich Approved.
President Roosevelt gave his ap
proval Wednesday to the .name of
former Gov. John T. Rich, or Michigan,
as collector in Port Huron. Senator
Smith saw the president at an early
hour and was told to go to the neces
sary department and have Mr. Rich's
commission made out at once. The
name was sent to the senate at noon
and confirmation is assured in ad
vance. Keep the Lid On.
Old rounders have had the time of
their lives in Battle Creek watching
saloonlsts remove screens, keep out
the fair sex and circulate petitions to
ask the council to make the liquor
laws more stringent.
All but five retailers have signed a
petition circulated by wholesalers In
which the saloonlsts, themselves, will
ask the city to keep the "Hd" down
tight. It is admitted that prohibition
rumors have scared the whisky sellers.
One saloonist, whose place has been
raided, posted a notice absolutely pro
hibiting women In the saloon.
Willie Blodgett, the 17-year-old Jack
son boy who has been missing from
his home since last Tuesday, is ap
parently traveling about the state. It
Is reported that he told people in Bat
tle Creek Saturday that his home was
in Allegan. A collection was taken
up for him and the last seen of him
he was boarding, a train for Kalama
zoo. Kaiser Wllhelm, in court language,
Is "deeply grieved" because even his
oldest counsellors Joined in the effort
to have his freedom of speech cur
tailed, especially while talking to
foreigners or after dinners. In the
language of the street, he Is "sore."
The shah of Persia has introduced
modern politics Into Persia. He prom
ised his people a council and has made
good, except that he does all the ap
pointing to that council and his
choices are men who will do Just what
ho says. The council has considerable
authority on paper and remains In
power two vears.
HERE'S A ROW.
Congress and President Have a 8harp
"Scrap" Started.
The breach between the president
and the house Is a fact, no longer a
possibility. The defi flung down by the
executive in his message has been
taken up, and unless the frantic ef
forts of the close Roosevelt coterie in
congress prevail with the angry states
men, the present session is going to
make a place for Itself in history by
the open and defiant enmity displayed
between the body, regarjless of par
tisanship, and a retiring executive.
This is the cause of the excitement:
"The chief argument In favor of the
provision was that the congressmen
did not themselves wish to be investi
gated by secret Bervlce men."
Immediately after the opening of
the house Friday, Rep. Perkins, of
New York, Introduced a resolution di
rected at the president. It provided
for the appointment of a special com
mittee of five to consider the proper
means of dealing with that portion
of the president's message criticising
congress for passing the present law
which restricts the activity of secret
service agents. The resolution is pre
ceded by a preamble which recites
some exprersions of the message.
The resolution was adopted, and the
following special committee named:
Messrs. Perkins, New York; Denby,
of Michigan; Weeks, of Massachu
setts; Williams, of Mississippi, and
Lloyd, of Missouri.
Republican senators today consid
ered what action should be taken by
the senate concerning the message of
the president and It was practically
decided to permit the resolution to be
brought in by some Democratic sen
ator. The resolution will provide for
an Investigation of the whole subject
by the senate committee on appropri
ations. Two presidents in the history of
this country have actually been re
buked by congress. One was John
Tyler, who sent a message to the
house strongly criticising It. The
house refused to receive the message
and passed resolutions of blunt cen
sure. The other was Gen. "Old Hick
ory" Jackson, fire-eater and original
big stick wielder. He clashed with
a senate made up of fearless men, and
when they passed a resolution criticis
ing him, and he sent In a hot mes
sage of protest, the senate flatly re
fused to receive it.
A Terrific Blast.
A giant blast of dynamite, prepared
for firing, was prematurely exploded
In the workings on the Panama canal
In Bas Obispo Saturday. Ten men
were killed and 50 injured.
It may be that others have been
killed, for the debris is piled in all di
rections. Bas Obispo cut is about 30
miles from Colon and the shock of
the explosion was distinctly felt.
Numerous reports are current as to
the accident, but the official version
from Culebra states that during the
loading of the last hole of the blast
the dynamite was discharged and the
remaining 21 tons were exploded by
concussion. The holes had not been
connected electrically, as the dis
charge of the blast was set for 5
o'clock In the afternoon. The last
hole was being loaded under the
supervision of one of the most effici
ent powder men in the employ of the
commission.
WIRELETS.
"Wall street expects every Hon to
do his duty when I go to Africa,"
Roosevelt told a delegation of Geor
