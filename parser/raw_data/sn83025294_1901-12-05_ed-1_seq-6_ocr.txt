The intelligent laboring men of the
West find generous encouragement in
the president's message, it treats of
the very subjects in which they are most
vitally interested, and its assurances are j
the more welcome because they are made
on behalf of the party, in power which
alone can carry them into practical
effect. A minority party, no matter
how solicitous it nflght be for reform,
could accomplish nothing, and support
of ils candidates and policies would bo
useless. It is the party which not only
favors reform but can execute its prom
ises that the honest workers of the
country should support. Such is the re
publican party. The president knows
the West, and his influence with a con
gress in political sympathy with him
must afford the best guaranty of legis
lation on behalf of the common people,
who, after all, are the best people, and
the nation's backbone. The men of the
West have asked of the government at
Washington:
The exclusion of Chinese.
Aid to irrigation.
A Pacific cable.
The regulation of trusts.
The restriction of undesirable immigra
tion.
A cabinet representative of labor and
commerce.
Expansion o? Western trade.
These are the subjects upon which the
workingmen of the Vest most desire
legislation. The republican party is
pledged to such measures as will meet
the popular demand. No other party
'has the power or the inclination to do
so. It is plain, therefore, that the best
interests of every toiler in the land re
quire that he lose no time in giving his
allegiance and his support to the re
publican party.

orders cannot be filled. If all the recent
orders were taken care of it would mean
the immediate shipment of not less than
20,000 tons. Advices from foreign ports
are to the effect that the cargoes already
landed have proved so successful in ad
vertising the American mine product
that orders are coming almost daily.
The freight to France is now $2.37 per
ton and the selling price $6.12. At this
rate the widest market ever offered for
American coal is being opened in Europe,
and American push and energy is taking
quick advantage of the change.
An immigrant is now in the Long
Island College hospital under orders to
return to the country from whence he
came. He is a resident of England
and is afflicted with tuberculosis, and,
under the laws, cannot be landed. Legal
steps 'have been taken in the immi
grant's behalf, and every test applied to
the act excluding consumptives. As the
matter stands, however, the consumptive
is barred, and must return home. This
wise provision of the immigration law,
deporting all immigrants not physically
:apable of being citizens, is generally
approved.

More than $54,000,000 in gold has passed

THE TRICE Of COPPER.
Unbelief In the reported sales of cop
per at a figure below the maiket price
.appeals to be generrl. Nor do those
best informed upon the copper situation
give credence to prophecies which fore
cast a change in the metal quotations
soon. Mining men and others familiar
with metal market conditions have
talked freely concerning the
( future A few days ago John Stanton.
market's
the well-known copper statistician, was
interviewed upon the copper market
condition by an Eastern paper.
'T know nothing of the reported cut
in the price of refined copper, and have
heard of none which has been sold under;
ir cents per pound," said Mr. Stanton j
j past, and I see no motive for a change:
in quotations."
during the course of the interview.
"There is nothing, in my opinion, to
warrant any cut at the present time. I
do not put much faith in the reports
that anti-trust legislation is to be em
ployed to block the efforts of the Amal
gamated Copper company to straighten
out the copper situation. There is as
much strength to the present copper
market as to the market of the recent

remarks upon the present state of the
market. "It seems to me that during
While entire harmony does not prevail
among the larger copper mining con
cerns. there is an evident disposition on
the part cf all who are Interested in
maintaining the price of the red metal
to give due credit to the company that
has kept up the price, and thus pre
vented disastrous consequences to a host
of smaller companies. In the Houghton
Mining Gazette, an official of the Calu
met & Hecla Mining company makes a
significant statement.
"We have sold over 1000 tons of cop
the past month consumers have been
buying of the Amalgamated interests
and paying Amalgamated prices, because
they could not get copper anywhere else.
Until very recently we have not had any
copper that we could deliver.
"Yes, it is a good plan to maintain
stability in the market for copper, that
is, to the extent of preventing wild fluc
tuations in prices. The Calumet & Hecla
has always tried to do this. The Amal
gamated people, however, seem to be
doing the same thing by keeping the
price up. This keeps a lot of mines in
business that, under normal conditions,
would be bankrupt. We don't like the
idea of having bankrupt concerns for
competitors."
RISKY MINING BUSINESS.
Gilded fortune in the form of mining
ventures will probably never cease to at
tract those who are looking for an easy
road and a short cut to wealuh. Men
. . i
persis ^ n ta -n.g capita out of a busi-,
ness in which Thoy are thoroughly posted '
and risking it in mining ventures of
which they are evidently ignorant. Noth
ing but a streak of the sort of luck
which occasionally favors the novice in
speculative ventures in such cases can
stave off disaster. The Fan Francisco
Chronicle reads a sermon on this sub
ject in a recent issue that hits the nail
squarely on the head.
"Mining is a business which requires
special qualifications and special experi
ence, like any other calling, to insure
success," is the sage observation of the
'Frisco paper. "It is true that the in
experieneed have occasionally succeeded
in it while men long seflsoned in mining
experience have failed in it. But the
same thing can be said of other kinds of
business. Nevertheless, few people have
the rashness to enter deliberately into a
mercantile venture which they know
nothing about, and trust to the element
of luck solely for success. Why should
success be expected under such condi
tions in mining? The percentage of suc
cesses among those following mining
understandingly is quite as large as it
is in any other business. Mining is safe
enough if rhe man «-ho follows it will
adhefe to the same rules in conducting
it that he would Apply in carrying on
some other business in which expert
knowledge is essential."
1 he bad repute that has been given
the mining business arises principally
from the amplitude of object lessons
(
:
I
I
!
j
pointing out the dangers of the pursuit. ;
By having the qualifications for success '
in mining, good results can generally be
secured; but, coming to the business
without experience is as hazardous as
embarking upon an ocean voyage with
out chart or compass, and will just as
surely land the reckless adventurer upon
the rocks.
NEW IMMIGRATION LAWS.
The demand for a re-enactment of the
1 Geary exclusion act comes from the peo
j pie. Selfish interest of a pecuniary na
! ture prompts opposition to the la«-.
; That there Is need for laws that will
j close the ports against Chinese and
! Japanese, nobody doubts. The recent
j statistics of the immigration bureau
' sho«' that arrivals of foreigners are
double what they «-ere a few years ago.

The prosperity which has prevailed in
the United States and the impoverished
condition of workingmen abroad has re
suited in the largest immigration kno«-n
in years. There is a ready welcome for
good citizens in every portion of the
country, and to the native of a foreign
nation with the capacity for exercising
the rights of an American citizen there
will always be an opening. But the an
! arc'hist, the incompetent and the depend
; ent are coming In such numbers that the
j laxity of the Immigration laws is a
J menace to American workingmen. The
j foreign laborer's first act la to underbid
I the American wageworker. The pros
i perity which the American laboring man
has assisted I» building up belongs to
him. The men who are interested ' in
bringing In Japanese are Just as greatly
interested in importing the cheap labor
of any other country. The Inter Mngn- |
tain publishes on another page an in
terview with Daniel McDonald, president
of the Western Labor Union, taken
from a Denver newspaper. It is stated
that during the past three years more
than 30,000 Japanese have landed on the
Pacific coast and secured employment
where American laborers were forMerty
working. The process of weeding out
this undesirable class of citizens anti
erecting barriers against the race can
not begin too soon. The attitude qf
President Roosevelt upon this subjv :t
ought io meet with ptaise in the roe—t
ins of every union in the country. uittl
it doubtless will.
THE DALY UND.
The subscriptions for the Paly monu
ment fund are as liberal as they née
spontaneous. The total so far llliis
trates the generous and public-spirited
character of the people and their • dis
position to recognize the results of Mr.
Daly's great industrial achievements.
Many a man «ho during the life of Mr. j
Daly opposed him in polities is willing i
to subscribe to the fund to build him a :
monument to perpetuate his name. No I
man in Montana ever accomplished so
much in opening mines and attracting
capital to the state as did Mr. Daly. j
It is with pleasure that the Inter ^
Mountain complies with the suggestion i
of the monument committee to open a
subscription book and print the names
of the subscribers, to the end that every I
giver to the fund may receive proper i
credit. Subscribers may leave money |

Andrew Carnegie has decided to «pend
a portion of his vast fortune to establish
a home for aged telegraphers. This act
of generosity will appeal to the publ£c
more than the previous donations of Mr.
Carnegie. The scheme to provide for
the comfort of aged employes may not
possess the utilitarian spirit that is found
in projects to establish libraries, but £t
«ill strike the public as an example of
humanitarian spirit that is good- to see.

circles «-ho have antagonized the library

Senator Burrows of Michigan has in
troduced a bill to provide for the de
portation of alien anarchists and the
exclusion of those who attempt to bring
their dangerous teachings into this
country. This bill Is for the protection

join, and it is to the interests of awry
organization working to promote the
general good that they be shut out of
the country.
The small number of soldiers landed to
protect the interests of the United

the power of the government had not

country, be mise he knew the result
of such hardihood would be swift and

Cotton exports by «'ay of Puget Sound !

Burlington and Northern Pacific, through
Montana. The value of the month)'» cot

PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT BUREAU.
City of Butte Will Establish One
Probably.
The judiciary committee of the city
council has passed a resolution to Intro
duce in the council an ordinance pro
viding for the establishment of a free
employment agency in the city.
The law gives the city council the
power to create and operate a free eui
ployment agency, and the introduction
of the ordinance «-ill be made in re
sponse to a request preferred by the
labor unions of the city.
At a meeting of the committee, among
whose members are Aldermen Kroger,
Mayo. McConnell and Dempsey, repre
sentatives of the Silver Bow Trades and
Labor Union, the Workingmen's Union,
the Women's Protective Union and the
Builiïing Trades Council presented the
request
Tl# labor representatives made the re
quest on the ground that the private
employment agencies, or some of them,
were committing abuses, imposing suf
fering and hardship upon the laboring
people who used them to obtain em
ployment.

TO FORM BALL LEAGUE.
Delegates From Utah and Montana
Cities Meet Here.
For the purpose of taking the initial
steps towards forming the Northwest
ern league delegates from Salt Lake.
Helena, Great Falls, Pocatello and
Butte are meeting at the Finlen hotel
this afternoon to discuss bas. bah.
J. C. Leary of Salt Lake says the Utah
cities are in favor of a combination be
ing formed with the Montana tou-ns.
He declares that Ogden and Salt Lake
are going to have professional baseball
teams whether the Northwestern league
is formed or not.
It is thought more desirable for Butte
and Helena to enter the Northwestern
league than for them to go Into the Pa
cific combination, because the distance
to the cities that will be in the former
are shorter.
This afternoon the delegates discussed
the matter of forming the league, and at
a meeting to be held at Salt Lake about
the middle of this month more definite
arrangements will be made.

Charge of Porjtuy Against John E.
Bordeaux Dismissed.
The preliminary hearing in the Bor
deaux perjury case came to an abrupt
termination In Justice Nelson's court to
day by the dismissal of the charge.
The hearing was commenced yester
day. but before any testimony was taken
a continuance until today was taken.
The time of the first session was con
sumed with a* discussion on the admis
sion of the stenographic notes of George
W. Patten taken at the trial of tt*
divorce suit in Judge Clancy's court.
At Its conclusion the Justice decided
to admit the notes in evidence.
When the hearing was resumed today
the prosecution objected to Jesse B.
Route and W. A. Clark, Jr., acting as
associate counsel for the state and it
resulted in the dismissal of the action.
There are four other casts of a simi
lar nature pending. ' one attains: Wil
liam Boss, one against I,. A. Sisley, one
against Mrs. Bordeaux and the other
against Charles L. Romanian, but they
are alt to be dismissed by the county
attorney for the reason that the allega

plaints were not laid before the prose

with the office before the complaints
were issued. The hearings in all of the
cases are set for tomoriw afternoon..

WASHINGTON SOCIAL LIFE.
Wives and Daughters of Congressmen
Lost in the Shuffle.
While there are S8 senators, with their
families in Washington during the sea
son, less than 20 enter into the social
life of the capital to any appreciable
degree. Among those who occupy prom
inent homes here, to which they have
returned in the last «-eek, are Senator
Elkins of West Virginia, Hanna and
Foraker of Ohio, Wetmore of Rhode Isl
and, Hawley of Connecticut, McMillan
of Michigan, Hale of Maine, Fairbanks
of Indiana, Jones of Nevada, Quay cf
Pennsylvania and Lodge of Massachu
setts.
Among the members of the lower
house, it is a conspicuous fact that this
year the percentage «"ho will take houses
and participate In the season's social
happenings Is much lo«-er than ever be
fore. While many prominent and dis
tinguished representatives and their
families are to be found among the
boarding houses and hotels, it is only
the householders who entertain a great
deal that become popular and are much
sought after. Much misapprehension ex
ists in regard to the distinction await
ing the wives and daughters of congress
men when they come to Washington.
To a prominent woiuan and social leader
in her own town or city, the disappoint
ment is very keen when she finds her
self among 300 of the same rank and
whirl of Washington society.
Only the energetic, ambitious, mag
netic «-oman or girl of this set, who
will enter the social arena and cleave
a way to popularity by the utmost
diplomacy and tact, can attain the goal
which every woman of the world longs
for—a place in society. While there are
some few of this kind to be met in a

guessing contest on the «eight of it
under the following conditions:

from us betn-een December 5, 1901, and
February 15, 1902, will be entitled to one

son who has guessed closest to its weight
we will pay $60 in gold; to the person
guessing second-closest we will pay $25,
and to the person guessing third closest
