last mr.s-
What Hayes may think; on any
public topic matters less at this time
than the opinions of any prominent
public uran; for Rutherford Hayes
is on the verge of retirement into
private life, and he retires (we write
it with rcirreti covered with the
contempt of all parties now efficient
in the political transactions of the
day. The democracy despises him
for the hypocrisy of his early pro
fessions, the stalwarts despise him
as a man whom they-have kicked
and cuffed into sustaining their pro
gram, and the liberal republicans
despise him for adopting their plat
form in word and nullifying it in
deed. We say that we make this
statement with regret, and we say
so with perfect sincerity, for it has
a demoralizing influence when a
nation despises the men it has ex
alted to high position. But it is so,
and it was for this reason that we
last week reported his message
rather in a vein of pleasantry than
as a serious matter. But ou reperu-
sal we find some matters which we
think may be briefly examined with
advantage, either because Ihey illus
trate the history of the recent presi
dency, or because they indicate the
points in which President Hayes
has surrendered to the less scrupu
lous section of his party, who now
seem likely to control the nation's
policy.
ABOUT THE SOUTH.
On this head he says :
Continued opposition to the fall and free
enjoyment i r the nciiui oi ciuzeusn',:'. u'
ferntl upon the colored people by the reeeni
amendment to the constitution, still pre
vails In several of the lute slave-holding
states. It has. perhaps, not been manifested
in the receut election to any lurge extent in
acts of violence or Intimidation. It has,
however, bv fraudulent practices in conmsc-
tion with the ballots, with the regulations
its to the places and manner of voting, na
with counting, returning and canvassing
t he voles cast, been successful In defeating
the exercise of the right preservative of al
rights, the right of suffrage, which the con
stitutlon expressly confers upon our enfran
chised citizens.
These are the words of a man who
knows that there is no exceptional
condition in the south as regards
the exercise of the franchise, but
cannot bring himself to discard alto
gether what his party still treasures
up as trump cards to use in political
emergencies. The absence of any
possible pretext for it compels him
to abandon the theory of intimida
tion and violence, and he falls back
on that of fraud, bribery and false
counting. He pretends to no evi
dence for this assumption but the
loose assertions of a partisan press,
and ignores the fact that there are
just as heavy charges rife in the
political atmosphere as regards the
elections in the north. We think it
likely that there has been more or
less of fraud and bribery in the
south, and we are sure lhat there
have been oceans of it in Indiana
New York and Pennsylvania, and
plenty of intimidation in the facto
ries of New England, but there Is
absolute indecency in a president
grounding upon loose reports of this
sort, unsustained by evidence,
recommendation to congress to pur
sue a differential policy as regards
one section of the country against
which there is no more evidence
than there is against the other.
ABOUT CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
In my former annual messages I have
asked the attention of congresw to the urgent
necessity ol a reformation of the cl vll service
system or ine government. iiy views con
ccrni ug the dangers of patronage, or appoi nt
menu for personal or partisan cousldera'
tions. have been strengthened by my
olwervation and experience in the executive
office, and I believe these daggers threaten
the stability of the government. Abuses so
serious in their nature cannot be perma
nently tolerated. They tend to become
more alarming with the enlargement of ad
ministratlve service, us the growth of the
country in population increases the number
or otnecrs aim placemen employee.
The reasons are imperative for the adop
tion of fixed rules for the regulation of ap
pointments, promotions, and removals,
establishing a uniform method, having ex
clusively in view. In every instance, the
attainment of the best qualifications for the
iKtsition in question, tsuch a method alone
is consistent with the equal rights of nil
citizens, and the most economical anil etli
cieut administration of the public business.
On this head the president evi
dently feels himself to be ou the
defensive. He is conscious that
there is a cross contradiction be
tween his professions at his acces
sion to office and his practice when
established in it. He commenced
his public declarations with the
most solemn protests against mak
ing office the reward of partisan
services, and he has filled the New
Orleans custom-house with a gan
of the most unscrupulous knaves
who aided in constructing the dis
gusting tissue of fraud and forgery
by which his defeat in the election
of 1S7G was converted into a shame
loss rape of the highest office of our
government. He tries to lay the
fault of his inconsistency on con
gress, which failed, as he says, to
legislate as he advised. But there
was no need of congressional inter
vention to provide against this scan
dal. As president he had absolute
control over these appointments;
congress had no power over them ;
the senate could only refuse to con
firm, and certainly could not dictate
to him the appointment of any in
dividual. The only compulsion
which dictated such appointments
was the president's own dread of
exposure at the hands of the men
whocounted him in, should they fail
to reap their reward in the form of
patronage. Hence the utter break
down of every attempt at remedy
for the master evil of our political
system, the evil w hich has already
transformed our government from a
republic iuto a bureaucracy, from a
government by the people into a
government by office-holders.
Mr. Hayes would have done bet
ter for his reputation as president if
he had retired without any further
allusions to civil service reform.
AIRH'T CJKANTISM.
The following is introduced into
what the president has to say about
military affairs:
1 commend to the attention of congress
the great services of the commander-in-chief
of the armies during the war for the
Union, whose wise, firm and patriotic con
duct did so much to bring that momentous
conflict to close. The legislation of the
United Htates contains many precedents lor
the recognition of distinguished military
merit, authorixiug rank and emoluments to
be conferred for eminent services to the
country. An act of congress authorizing
the HjMiinuuent of a captain general of the
liriuy, with suitable provisions relating to
romis-nsalion, retirement and other details,
would, in my judgment, be altogether fitting
And proper, and would be warmly approved
ivy the couutry.
It has really nothing to do with
military affairs, but is intended to
promote the creation of an ofiice for
the purpose of giving Gen. Grant a
Jarge Income at the expense of the
nation. It is filled with blunders
and impracticable counsel. Thus
Grant is intended to be designated
in the words "commander-in-chief
of our armies during the war."
Abraham Lincoln was the only
commander-in-chief of the United
States armies during the war, and
the United States army lias never
had any commander-in-chief at any
time except the president of the
United States for the lime being ; it
can have no other under the consti
tution. Rutherford Hayes is at this
time commander-in-chief of the
United States army, and V. T.
Sherman is acting commander under
him. There are absolutely no func
tions for a captain general to fill in
the army which are unprovided for
as things now stand. Moreover,
Gen. Grant has no claim upon the
nation such as is implied in this
recommendation. The office now-
held by Gen. Sherman was created
for Gen. Grant and held by him till
he choose to vacate it that he might
become president, ond when he did
attain that office the presidential
income was doubled iii his Interest,
giving his successor the opportunity
to save $75,000 out of his official in
come. The true meaning of this proposal
is that the republican party desires
to establish a military aristocracy,
made up of highly-paid sinecurists
for their own benefit. It is the true
principle of our government that
our presidents become private citi
zens as soon as their term of office is
over, and are expected to keep up
no more state than any other citi
zen. If Gen. Grant has not money
enough to do this, it is because he
spent his means in advertising him
self for the presidency at the last
election, and if anyone is bound to
recoup him for that, it is not the
nation, but the office-seekers who
expected to come into power and
profit under his wing.
Perhajis we may find some more
beauties yet in the last message.
So as we can't send merchant ships,
we send ships of war to make en
quiries, and we have a really inter
esting account by Consul Mathews,
of Tangier, of a cruise of the U. S.
steamship Quinnebaug, with him
on board, to the western or Atlantic
ports of Morocco. What they learn
there is what they might have
known before they started, t at the
nation which can get that trade is
the nation that can send them the
besi and cheapest goods and take
what they have to sell at the best
price. Our protective system dis
ables us in both respects ; it makes
the production of manufactured
goods expensive here by increasing
the expense of living for the manu
facturing laborer, and so necessi
tating higher wages for him, and
that prevents our selling as cheap as
less profited nations, and it pre
vents our giving as good a price for
African goods, because when our
merchants get home they have to
pay a heavy duty on them, and, of
course, can't give as good a price for
them as men who have no such
duty to pay.
SJiips of war are not what we
should send there, but American
merchant ships, carrying cheap
goods on board and ready to tako
goods of African production in pay
for them at as good prices as other
nations give for them.
But that is just what our protect
ive system makes it impossible for
us to do ; so we make drummers of
our naval officers and they drum up
no orders. .
These are not the inferences which
the state department and its report
ing, consuls intended should be
made from the present repotts, but
the man is blind who reads the
reports and fails to make the inferences.
IX CON till ESS.
The principal subjects before con
gress have been the president's mes
sage, and the mode of counting the
electoral vote ; the rest is buncombe.
As we have said our say on the!
message, we will confine our present
remarks to the other topic. The
mode of counting was introduced as
a question by Mr. Bicknell, of Indi
ana, who moved to take up the con
current resolution of the senate
standing over from last session.
This resolution made provisions
very simitar to those proposed by
Mr. Morton, the great republican
leader of Indiana, in 1875. Mr. 31.
urged the adoption of his bill on the
ground that unless it or some other
were passed, the counting of the
electoral votes and adjudication of
all contested returns would fall upon
the vice-president. This position
was disputed by Mr. Edmonds in
1877, also republican, and his refu
tation of it was so pointed that we
print it:
It staggers human credulity that, if that
body of men had designed to turn the presi
dent of the senate into a judge in the most
critical of all cases for the well-being of the
republic, and in a case where it was foreseen
and even known that he himself would be
at first, Rnd )erhaps afterward, as it hap
pened, the very man who was to profit or
lose by his decision It staggers human cre
dulity that, if they had intended to repose
such a deciding power in the chair, they
should not have suid so. When the
republican party is called upon to stultify
its own record and to go back, as the phrase
is, upon the mission it has performed in this
very respect in every time of quest Km and
dispute, and because we can gain the beg
garly prize of a temporary victory, to dis
honor ourselves, I ask whether the prize is
worth the cost. Where have we stood ? I
will not go back over all our historv. where
in every dispute, as nobody denies, not the
president of the senate, out sonielxxly else,
riguiiuiiy or wrongtully.has always decided,
but I will take republican action alone.
When in lKtfi, the first time in the republican
career that a question as to whut was the
constitutional vote of a state arose, a repub
lican majority in both houses, almost com
plete in its unanimity, having all the power
of the two houses, declared by a Joint rme
mat no vote irom a state, wnetner it were a
single vote or a double vote or a paper pur
porting to be either, should have any effect
n pun the election of a president of the
C uited States unless both houses of congress,
not the president of the senate, tiot any
body under law even, but unless both houses
of congress, In their constitutional character
and without law should admit if. That was
the twenty-second joint rule.
We have purposely quoted repub
lican statesmen only. It will b
seen that while they differ as to the
right of the vice-president to count
in the absence of congressional in
tervention, they are agreed as to its
being a monstrous idea that the
decision should be left to that officer.
Now, what are republicans in
congress doing ? They are working
In every possible way to prevent
theconcurrent resolution beingacted
upon, and Mr. Robeson broadly
avows his purpose in doing so to be
that the vice-president alone may
act in the matter.
The explanation of this policy is
clear enough; it looks to the election
of 1S84. The republicans know that
they have an utterly unscrupulous
man for vice-president; one who
knows no right or wronyr where
party Is concerned, except what is
declared so by the interests of his
party. It is understood that, who
ever may be elected, Garfield is to
be declared president by Mr. Vice-
President Arthur.
A paragraph has appeared in
the West Tennessee Whig announc
ing that Senator Baily is pledged to
procure an amendment to the con
stitution enabling states to be sued
for their debts, in the federal courts.
We have the Senators authority for
giving this an express contradic
tion. All Col. Bailey's opinions and
actions- are opposed to federal en
croachments on the reserved rights
of the states.

Scarce but a month ago,
Before the early snow,
They brought to me a bunch of roses rare.
They were so wondrous sweet
That I must needs repeat
And the story of their perfectness declare.

Nestled lovingly between
Two great cream-colored budsof richest tint
And the glow of sunset skies
Burned In the open eyes
Of the satiny leaves that with the whole was

Too beautiful to stay,

And their perfume has vanished from my

But my memory shall prove
For them a tender love

t'O-VSt E4K HEI'OKTS.
We have before us a series of offi
cial documents which have been to
us very interesting reading, more so
from facts which are incidentally,
and, as it were, accidentally brought
to light than from the intended im
pression the reiiorts were to produce.
All ourconsuls and consular agents
receive instructions from the depart
ment of state to make constant
enquiries and frequent reports as to
the possibility of promoting our
comm-rcial relations with the coun
tries in which they have their offi
cial residence, and the present col
lection emanating from the state
department is a result of such enqui
ries.
It is certain that these reports
were not written with the purjose
of discrediting what is called pur
protective system of imposts on im
ported goods, but it is easy enough
to read between their lines abund
ant proof that anything like extens
ive commerce is impossible so long
as we keep up our prohibitory sys
tem against imports.
Our attention has been specially
directed to reports in reference to
the trade of western and north
western Africa. The first point no
ticed by the reporting consuls is the
almost total absence of the Ameri-1
can flag from seas on which it was
once everywhere visible. Why it
is aosent is not far to seek. We
won't let our people buy foreign-
built ships, and we tax all the ma
terials for building them so high
that they can't be built at home
Lost Five Days.
Nashville American.
Mr. Hazelwood, living near the
Hyde's Ferry turn-pike, in the
Twenty-third district, tells the fol
lowing story of the disappearance of
his son George, a boy 11 years old :
On Saturday, Dec. 4, while Mr.
Hazelwood and his son were engag
ed in the field, dogs attacked one
of his hogs in an adjoining wood.
The boy was sent to call them off,
and, in order to do so, was compel
led to go somedistance in the wood ,
and darkness coming on, he lost his
way. The father went to the woods
to hunt for him, but without find
ing him. The next morning quite
a number of the neighbors turned
out to assist in the search, but noth
ing could be heard of the boy, and
he was given up for lost. As the
bluff on the river adjoining the
wootls was from fifty to one hun
dred feet high, it was feared that he
had fallen off this aud perished.
On Thursday last five days after
young Hazelwood's disapperance
a number of school boys, while com
ing along the public road two miles
front Mr. Hazelwood's house, saw
a boy coming out of the woods into
the road some distance in front of
them. Thinking that they recog
nized him, as young Hazelwood,
they called him, when he left the
road and ran iuto the woods. They
followed him and he stopped, and
in reply to questions, said he did
not know where he was, did not
know his old schoolmates, and nev
er saw the road before. He was
taken to the school. house in that
district and voluntarily went home
by himself from there.
When he reached home he stated
that he heard the calls on the night
lie was lost and answered them, but
could not find his father. The weath
er was cold, and the boy kept warm
by covering his body with leaves.
He lived on hickory ruts, wild
grapes and persimmons. He slept
in the ravines between the hills;
the father thinks that the sounds
which the boy heard were the ech
oes of the former's calls. Thus de
ceiving him instead of getting
nearet, got further away from him
all the time.

Franklin Corr., Nashville American.
Joseph It. Campbell, esq., return
ed on the first instant from Scotland
whether he was sent as an attorney
to investigate the statements oi
Prof." Wm. Stanford, of West
Tennessee, regarding the claim of
the McEwen heirs to a S'ipposeu es
tate valued at several million pounds
sterling, near Edinburgh. With his
accostomed energy he pushed the
investigation and probed the mat
ter to the bottom, only to find that
the representations of "Prof." S.
were founded upon an exceedingly
slender basis of truth ; so fine, in
deed, that matters could not be
made b. materialize. He caused a
thorough official search to be made,
and if any such will as the one that
has been alleged had ever existed it
would have been unearthed by the
expert empioyeti by them for the
purpose, in the dusty archives of
centuries, carefully preserved at the
Registrar's office in Edinburgh.
This office has records of every will
ever probated in all the counties of
Scotland. There was, sure enough,
a century and a half ago, a Mr. Da
vid Miller who once lived at Crieff,
a town of 4,000 inhabitants, sixty
miles from Edinburgh, and he was
probably in fair circumstances for
that day and region, but that he
left the immense estate, and partic
ularly in the way supposed, was as
certained to be a myth. To Mr.
Campbell's skill and research the
widely scatterta heirs are indebted
for the settling of the "vexed ques
tion" and putting their minds at
rest in the matter.
