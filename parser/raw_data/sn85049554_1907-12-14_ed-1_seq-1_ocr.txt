Organizations or Even to Individuals
—Must Us* Discretion.
Washington, Dec. 14.—In past years
many communications have been re
ceived by the postoffice department re
questing the delivery of so-called
"Santa Claus" letters to philanthropic
societies, and other in various parts
of the country, but the requests al
ways have been denied, the depart
ment taking tiie stand that letters of
importance would be classed with
"Santa Claus" letters thru error, arid
that it would be exposing to private
parties confidential correspondence
that the letters might contain valuaole
enclosures, and that such a practice
would not be in keeping with the prin
ciple of the sanctity of the mails. Now,
however, Postmaster General Meyer
has adopted a more liberal attitude
toward the children, as indicated by
his action today in issuing an order to
postmasters all over the country to
let the people of their cities know thru
the newspapers that mail addressed
to "Santa Claus" will be delivered to
any responsible parties who will un
dertake to act as Santa Claus' agents
in the matter.

chard as to his conversation with
Haywood and Pettibone at Pettibone's
back yard In Denver in regard to the
plans for killing Bradley, and showed
Orchard his testimony at the Haywood
trial in an effort to prove that con
tradictory statements were made. "Or
chard said the conversation referred to
by Darrow was not the same one to
which he testified in the former trial.
Darrow asked why it was that when
the witness went to San Francisco he
did not register from Denver, but that
at Caldwell, Nam pa. Boise and other
places In Idaho he gave Denver as his
home. Orchard said that when h£ went
to San Francisco .ie was being looked
for by the police, but this was not so
when he went on the Steunenberg mis
sion. Witness was questioned at
length on the Bradley affair, but no
new facts were developed.

Attorneys Claim Roads Were Bene

Chicago, Dec. 14.—Attorney Herrick
continued his argument in behalf of

work in unison provided neither prop
erty was damaged by so doing.

Iowa Retail Liquor Dealers'As
sociation Insisting Mulct Law
Shall Be Obeyed
INLAND TOWNS START CRUSADE
Liquor Dealers Who Obey Laws Notify
Fliver Towns That They Must Do So
Or Law Abiding Ones Will Join
Temperance Crusade Shaw's Book
Out in February.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dei'. 14.—The report
that the officers of the Retail Liquor
Dealers' Association are visiting the
cities of Iowa and insisting to the
saloon keepers that they get In line
and obey the law was confirmed here
today. The association has seen the
hand writing on the wall. The meet
ing some time ago in Dubuque, it: is
iet.rned now, resolved on this plan
and Dubuque was the first place
whipped into line. The association
proposes to force every saloon keeper
In the state to obey the mulct law
and to assist in prosecuting those that
do not.
The saloon keepers of the Inland
towns are the prime movers in Ihe
plan. They have decided to lay down
the ultimatum to all the river town
saloon keepers and that unless they
"come in" and obey the law, the in
land town saloon keepers, who have
for years been obeying the mulct law,
will join .the forces of the temper
ance people and give them moral sup
port in closing up such saloons.
The inland saloon keepers fear that
unless checked, the sentiment will re
sult in the prohibitory amendment
which the Anti-Saloon league and
•ministers are working so vigorously
for.
it is learned that in Davenport the
brewery interests own three-fourths
,of the saloons of that town. There
are something like twice as many
th'Sre as there are In Des Moines, thn
Davenport is only half as large. These
Davenport breweries have observed
th-3 provisions of the mulct law, but
the saloons that they own have not.
This has led to the breweries being
held up for many years by blackmail
ing lawyers. They have paid hun
dreds of dollars to keep these lawyers
from starting court actions against
them. Finally driven by desperation
they organized a "holding company" to
manage the saloons, so that the brew
eries could not be hurt.
In their management of their saloons
the breweries have toeen forced to buy
the property in which their saloons
are located and this has been a big
expense to them. Under the new
plan the state association proposes
that all Davenport saloons and .brew
eries s.hall obey the mulct law and live
up to all its provisions. This means
that they must pay the mulct tax
which they have never paid. The
payment of this tax will result in
about one-half the saloons going out
of business and the breweries will
have a lot of corner lots property for
sale.
A number of Davenport saloonkeep
ers have decided to begin strict obedi
ence to the mulct law at once and not
wait any longer for threatened legal
action. Ben Harloff was the first one
to tile a $8,000 bond and the necessary
papers with the county auditor. Others
are preparing to do the same, and it
is thought that within a very short
time all will be obeying the law.
Several incidents happened to has
ten the saloon keepers to seek snel
lor under the mulct law. One was
the visit ofl the otficers of the Iowa
Liquor Dealers' assocfition and their
ultimatum that- unless the saloon
keepers complied with the mulct law
thoy would join forces with the tem
perance element to bring it about, and
that outride breweries would join in
the movement.
The organization of a local civic
federation was completed by the elec
tion of Rev. W. H. Blancke, pastor of
St Paul's English Lutheran church,
as president.

Governor Shaw's book giving a de
fense of his position as a standpat
ter will not be out of the press till in
February or March of next year. This
information was learned today by a
Des Moines book store where an order
for the book had been lodged some
weeks ago. The advertisements of the
book stated that it was ready for dis
tribution- This was in the November
magazines. The book is not out yet and
information from the publishers to the
Des Moines book store is to the effect
that it will not appear till February or
later.
Unofficial rumors are in circluation to
the effect that the book is being held
up because the times are not propitious
for launching it. It is said that the
book was to be issued as a sort of
Mirier for a boom for Shaw for pres

a finger on tile pulse of the situation

here Is proof that the west Is aroused

next June is they can prevent it. It is
