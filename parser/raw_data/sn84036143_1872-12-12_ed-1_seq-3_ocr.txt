Blacque Bey, the Turkish Minister here,
has received a letter from the Minister of
Finance of Turkey asking a series of ques
tions in regard to Pacific railroads, their eon
tion and management, and their availability
to Mohammedan commercial interests. The
letter has been transmitted and referred to
the Secretary of the Interior, and Blacque
Bey has prepared an answer. The questions
may be stated as follows :
What are the facilities of the Pacific rail
roads for the transportation of raw material ?
In what manner are the Central, Union,
and Northern Pacific railroads constructed ?
IIow Is it that these railroads manage to
carry freights at their present reduced rates
and have large gains ?
Would it be advisable for the Turkish gov
ernment to send its raw products to the
United States and to China via the Pacific
railroads?
Understanding the desire of the Turkish
government to introduce our tnms-continent
_ al railway system in Turkey, Blacque Bey's
reply is confined mainly to the second ques
tion, concerning the construction of rail
roads. In accordance with suggestions from
the Secretary of the Interior, the Turkish
Minister, in vieiv of the fact that the terri
tory of the two Turkeys, for railroad pur
poses, is very' similar to that of the central
and western portions of the United States,
urges iu strong terms the advisability of
adopting our system, and gives it as his
opinion that Turkish commercial interests
would gain nothing by sending raw products
to the United States and China, as we receive
the same produce via the Pacific railroads,
excepting opium, gum arabic and silk, which
are inconsiderable mattery and are now
shipped to Liverpool and various ports on the
coast of France.
The commission to inspect the Minnesota
division of the Northern Pacific Railroad
report the road well located, the grades light,
embankments and excavations within the re
quirements of the law, the ballasting well
done with gravel, the rolling stock uniformly
excellent, and tlie engine houses and repair
shops adequate. Its acceptation is recom
mended.

New York, December lO.-At White Plains
yesterday the daughters of the late Horace
Gteeley, with a few friends and accompanied
by counsel, appeared before the Surrogate to
offer for probate the will of their father.
This will was executed on November 29th.
It had been written by Mr. Greeley some
time ago, but was only presented to him for
execution a few hours before his death. It
gave all the property equally to his two
daughters. This instrument had been placed
among his private papers by Mr. Greeley
himsçlf, aid was only taken from among
them at the time of his late attack, and at the
first lucid interval thereafter it was offered to
him for acknowledgment.
At the same time counsel appeared before
the Surrogate to contest this will, and offer,
ing instead one dated January, 1871 The
contestants Are Samuel Sinclair, Richard H.
Manning and Charles Store, the two latter
being named as executors. The counsel for
proponents of the will would acquiesce in
the will of 1871. He thought the will execu
the contestants then said, that he honed the
luiesci
ighf '
ted by Mr. Greeley before his death did great
injustice, inasmuch as it gave all the pro
perty to Miss Ida, with the qualification that
one-half of it was to be used by her at her
own discretion for the support and education
of her sister Gabrielle ; that some of the rela
tives would be deprived of property intended
for them.
The counsel for the daughters thought that
these remarks were uncalled for, and an
nounced that Miss Ida had offered to assign
to her sister one-half of the property, and
also to grant suitable annuities to the rela
tives. I
The Misses Greeley then declined to con
sider any proposals for compromise, and
regular proceedings to contest the will then
ensued, on the ground of the incapacity of
the testator to execute the will of 1873.
The first witness was Miss Sampson, who
testified that she became a witness to the will
on the day that Mf. Greeley died. Mr. Gree
ley was then, a few hours before his death
conscious and rational.
After some further examination of this
witness an adjournment followed. The will
of 1871 gives the property to liis daughters,
but in addition, gives bequests to his relatives^
and a legacy of equal value of a share of the
'Iribune to the Children's Aid Society of New
York.

New York, December 11.—A fire in Fifth
Avenue Hotel last night broke out shortly
after 11 o'clock on the second floor, but it
was kept a secret by the proprietors and
clerks even from the guests, who were aroused
by a female servant who had been burned
out of her dormitory and ran shrieking "fire"
through the halls. They were quieted by the
statement that it was only a small tire in the
laundry. It was nearly 12 o'clock before a
passing policeman discovered the fire and
called the engines. The stairway upon which
the fire started was at. the back of tiro house
leading from the laundry in the basement to
servant's rooms in the attic. It had no open
ings except at the bottom and top and the
Haines rushed up it as up a chimney, destroy
ing the staircase, but doing little damage till it
reached the open space at the top into which
the rooms of the servants opened. Here it
burst into its fullest strength, rushing through
the narrow passage way and spreading rap
idly over the entire extent of the west wing.
The woodwork of the servants rooms imme
diately caught and soon the entire wing was
a mass of name. The servants asleep in the
rooms at the top of the staircase were over
taken before assistance could reach them, and
they were completely shut off from the main
building. The firemen, w ho had in the mean
time arrived, w ere too late to render assist
ance, as by this time the apartments of the
poor creatures were enveloped iu flames.
Shortly after one o'clock, when it was found
that a number of persons were missing, a
police officer and a chief of the fire depart
ment effected an entrance by means of an
iron ladder to the room where the people
were supposed, to be, and they found there
the charred, burned bodies of sixteen persons.
The bedding and furniture was strewn
about the rooms, confused with human re
mains. The bodies of the victims lay in dif
ferent places, from which they had tried to
find egress. Some had endeavored to escape
through the widows, while others had fallen
at the head of the staircase. The bodies of
two women were half concealed under a bed
in an outer room, where they had evidently
tried to shelter themselves from suffocation
by smoke and the scathing flame. When
the firemen and police got into the wing the
floor of this room was sound, but tho roof
timbers were burned and bad fallen iu a con
fused mass upon the bodies, severing limbs,
and mutilating the remains horribly. In an
other room six bodies were fonml, making,
np to 2:80 this morning, twenty-two, which is
believed to be all the victims.
There were about 500 guests in the hotel,
who, when finally aware of their danger,
were greatly excited. It is said there was
gross carelessness, as was apparent in the
condition of the warming apparatus, and the
attaches of the hotel are blamed for their
efforts to keep the fire secret and making s 6
little effort to save the unfortunate girls. The
affair will doubtless be thoroughly Investi
gated. Tho loss is estimated to be from
§180,000 to $150,000. About one-fourth of
the furniture of the house is ruined by water.
Just before the alarm a guest was assigned to
a room, which, on reaching be discovered to
be on fire, and on returning to the clerk he
was informed that there was no other room
vacant. The tire was not known in the office
at this time.

.Uontnna Wheat and Kyc,
Tlie Kansas City, Missouri, Jounuil of
Cojnmcrce, of November 36, contains the fol
lowing notice of Montana productions in its
commercial columns :
From Mr. Richard Leach, of tlie firm of
Tootle, Hanna & Leach, wo have received a
head of wheat and one of rye, brought by
him from Montana. The wheat is a bearded
spring, variety, and unlike any wc have ever
seeu, tlio head proper being composed of
several smaller beads, each kernel being hea
vily encased in a chaff or hall, surmounted by
a long spike or beard, not unlike that which
barley is known to have. The party who
produced that whieh is now' iu our possession
Las been growing this variety for several sea
sons, having secured the seed from some
forty kernels, whiph he obtained in Califor
nia. At the last harvest the.entire crop was
on some acre and a quarter of land, which
produced one hundred and forty bushels of
wheat. A Single acre yielded one hundred
aud ten bushels. The rye is a very white
chaffed, beardless variety, with a berry as
white as wlient, and of extremely flue quality.
The head we have before us measures about
eight inches in length.
" Tlie name and origin of tbe wheat is un
known, but some claim it to be of Egyptian
origin. The wheat and rye were grown in
tlie irrigated district, at tbe head waters of
the Missouri river, on Ten-Mile creek, Mon
tana, where tlie first surplus crop of grain
ever known in that locality was producer the
past season. There being no outlet for (Tops
at present, grain is not regnrded as profitable
for growing beyond tlie supply necessary for
the immediate wants of the settlers."
The Journal also alludes editorially to the
wheat, aud says the yield is simply enormous.
It further says: "It is not common in the
locality where it is grown, and this is the first
season any considerable amount of it has
been harvested. Grown on land requiring
irrigation from J une until September, if this
yield is a fair estimate of its producing qual
ity, it goes far to prove this wheat a very de
sirable variety for the fanner, and that the
soil of Montana and the system of irrigation
not without merits to attract the attention of
those seeking fruitful fields iu the Great.
West."

ing been compressed, to prevent a too rapid
escape, into the form of a gas burner. After
a sufficient longth of time had elapsed for the
gas to generate, a lighted candle was applied
to the burner, when to the surprise of some
and satisfaction of all, a clear, bright jet of
flame over 13 inches in length shot from the
tube and continued to burn steadily and brill
iantly for over two hours. The retort was car
ried through our streets and stores and caused
no little excitement. When removed from
the retort the coal was found to be as per
fectly coked as any ever burned. It will be
seen from this experiment that we now have
the means within our county to successfully
run furnaces for iron manufacture and the
more perfect reduction of refactory ores,
ami, if ever desirable, to light our streets with
gas. We understand that Mr. Davis' mine
«■d the others now being worked are im
proving in width and make a better showing
with every day*» development. It cannot be
doubted that the field is an extevsive one,
and the coal of excellent quality. That its
discovery will eventually prove an incalcula
ble good to this section, Is also true; as with
the Increase of population and capital, it will
open np new branches of industry and trade
not now even thought of.
