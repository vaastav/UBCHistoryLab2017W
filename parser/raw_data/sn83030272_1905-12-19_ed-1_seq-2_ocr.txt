of no faction of his party would be the moslsatisfactory
satisfactory choice for this position durlnitho
the very Important session of the Leglslatunabout
about to conveneAfter
After consulting with many men of allfactions
factions of the party I am thoroughly convinced
vinced that Assemblyman Janice W Wadsworth
worth Jr of Livingston would be an Idealcandidate
candidate for Speaker and that If the Assembly
bly In Its wisdom should see fit tp choosehim
him a such he would discharge the dutleiof
of the position with Impartiality dignity andability

I Is almost neediest to say that the actionof

comes as a complete surprise to me lp towithin
within a few hours I had not the faintestidea
idea that he was contemplating such actionIt
I may he generally known that I as wellas
as the other members of the Assembly fromhe
the Thirtyfourth Congressional district haveicen
ben pledged to the candidacy of the lionS
S Percy Hooker of Oenesee county Thismornlne

I fully appreciate the position of the eldermemberll
member of tho Assembly who have servedur
far longer than I and who feel entitled underrdinary
ordinary circumstance to recognition Andnlthout
without going Into details I realize that onlythe
the exigencies of the situation make It possible
ble or even permissible for mo to announoamyiulf
myiulf as a candidateIn
In general my views ai to the situationIn
In the State today are the same as thosehold
hold by thousands and thousands of ourcitizens
citizens The problems which will confront
front the coming Legislature are of tremendous
mendous Importance and the people aredemanding
demanding that those problems be solvedand
and solved correctly In other words that theLegislature

representative agent of the people I Iscll
neil known that the Governor Is very desirousof
of having the romlng Legislature acquit Itselfth
