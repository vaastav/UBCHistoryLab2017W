Fit. Louis, Dec. 20.—The first public cele
bration in connection with the world's
fair to be opened in St. Louis in 1903 in
commemoration of the one hundredth an
niversary of the Louisiana purchase was
held to-day when ground was broken on
the site in Forest Park. The day was
selected because it was an anniversary
of the formal transfer of the Louisiana
terlrtory to the United States. The day
■was a holiday in St. Loujs and throughout
Missouri. It has been intended that the
formal exercises at the site should be
preceded by a parade of military and civic
bodies, but at the last moment it had

Chicago Has a Famine and
Low Temperature Causes
Deaths.
Chicago, Dec. 20.—Chicago and the
northwest have been promised a respite
from the severe weather that has made
railroads icebound, brought on a coal fam
ine and added to the usual cold weather
suffering. But so far the promise has
brought little comfort. To-day at 10
o'clock the official record of temperature
was 8 degrees below zero in Chicago;
Kansas City 4 below, and St. Louis 10 be
low. The warm blast that is predicted
from the northwest has moderated the
condition somewhat at extreme points,
Calgary reporting 34 degrees above and
Battleford 30 above.
In Chicago and the immediate vicinity,
however, the severity of the -cold has
wrought havoc. Deaths occur frequently
which are directly attributable to the
cold. Shippers of grain are almost at a
standstill. Railroads can offer no relief
unless the weather moderates.

Special to The Journal.
Winona, Minn.. Dec. 20. —"This is splen
did logging weather," remarked William
H. Laird of the Laird Norton company of
this city to-day. "In fact, the winter to
date has been about all that lumbermen
could desire. Cold weather began early
and there has been plenty of snow, the
snow falling in the north earlier than in
this city."
Speaking of the logging being done by
the companies in which members of the
Laird Xorton company are interested, Mr.
Laird said it was proceeding very satis
factorily at all points. The company is
getting out about 25,000,000 feet on the
Chippewa river and it? tributaries and
abojt an equal amount on the St.
Croix river. The logs on the St. Croix
are being cut in Mille Lacs county and
taken fifteen miles by a logging railway
to the waters of the St. Croix. Some 250
men are employed in this work and
about 200 on the Chippewa. This cut of
logs will furnish a complete supply for
the Laird-Norton company's mill in this
city next summer and part of the supply
for the mill of the Winona Lumber com
pany.
The rost of the Winona Lumber com
pany's logs will come from the upper
Mississippi above the twin cities, being
secured through the Mississippi River
lumber company, a concern which sup
plies logs to three Minneapolis mills.
Members of the Laird Norton company in
this city are interested in this organiza
tion, which this winter will cut close to
45,000,000 feet of logs.
The experiment of getting logs from the
upper river and bringing them down here
for sawing was tried for the first time the
past season, and while of course the lum
ber cannot be manufactured so cheaply
as where the log supply is near at hand,
still the experiment was found to be fair
ly satisfactory, so much so that more
logs are to be secured in the same man
ner next year. The logs are being sawed
more closely than formerly, the gang saw
! having given way to the band saw, and
small matters of waste being looked after
more closely than when the log supply
was plentiful. The most possible is now
gotten out of the logs, and they are cut
into just the stuff needed and to the best
advantage.
Mr. Laird is of the opinion that next
summer's lumber cut in Winona will be
fully up to what it has'been the past sea
son in the milsl of the Laird Norton com
pany and the Winona Lumber company.
The log supply now being secured will be
sufficient to provide for a steady season's
run. and it is expected to commence saw
ing the first of April.
In addition to the local mills here, the
members of the Laird Norton company are
largely interested in the big mill of the
Pine Tree Lumber company at Little
Falls, Minn., which is cutting some 75.
--000,000 feet of logs this winter, and ex
pects to saw that amount next summer.

ADM. SAMPSON
DOTH OBJECT
Protests Against Dewey's
Minority Finding.
WHO WAS IN COMMAND?
Argument lhat Schley En joyed Not
' This fionor.
HE, SAMPSON, WAS THE TRUE "IT"
Points Oat That This Question Was
Nut Before the Court
of Inquiry,
Washington, Dec. 20.—The objection of
Admiral W. T. Sampson to that portion of
Admiral Dewey's report of the Schley
court of inquiry in which he says Ad
miral Schley was in command at the bat
tle off Santiago and entitled to the credit
of the victory was filed with Secretary
Long to-day. The document was brought
to the navy department by E. S. Theall
of counsel for Admiral Sampson and hand
ed to the secretary. It is as follows:
N«w York, Dec. 19, 1901.—Sir: As counsel for
Rear Admiral Sampson, we have the honor to
request that the department, for the reasons
below stated, strike out or specifically disap
prove that portion of Admiral Dewey's opin
ion riled in connection with the proceeding of
the Schley court of inquiry, in which he states
his views to be that Conahodore Schley was
in absolute command at the naval battle of
Santiago.
First—Commodore Schley was not in com
mand at that ba'tle.
Second—The President of tho United States
and the navy department had decided that
I Admiral Sampson was in command at that
' battle and Commodore Sehley second in com
i lnand.
Third —The question as to who commanded
at Santiago was not referred to the court for
consideration and evidence bearing upon the
point was excluded.
\ First—Commodore Schley was not in coni
; maud at that battle, (a) The disposition of
forces at the beginning of the battle, accord
; ing to Commodore Pehley's own statement,
j places Admiral Sampson in command.
The Brooklyn and the Vixen were the •west
ernmost ships of the fleet; the Indiana and
Gloucester were "the easternmost. The New |
York was nearer both of the latter than was |
the Brookolyn, and notably at the time when i
tho Indiana was heavily engaged at the be
ginning of the action and when the Glouces
ter was engaged with the Furor and Pluton.
Commodore Schley says "the Indiana and the
Gloucester * * * closer to the flagship"
than to the Brooklyn.
riaiiiiM Sampson Wa» in Command.
We have, then, the case ol a fleet in a reg
ular formation, with the commander-in-chief
within signal distance, and -closer to a large
number of the ships than is the second in
command. It is true that ttjje commander-ln
chief could not have reisT^i^he most. distant
vessel by signals, except' ,by gauging them to
be repeated by an'intermediate vessel —an en
tirely usual course—tout it is equally true that
the second in command could not have
reached the remote vessels of the fleet (name
ly, the Indiana and the Gloucester) without
likewise repeating signals. In this state of
affairs the regulations of the navy and the
customs of the sea place the absolute com
mand and the full responsibility in the senior
officer.
(b) The Brooklyn's maneuver during the
action destroys any claim that Commodore
Schley might have had to the command. The
facts as to the loop are found by the court.
The finding and opinion show that to avoid
danger to his own ship he maneuvered with
out warning to the rest of the squadron and
in disregard of the fleet formation.
Second—The president of the United States
and the navy department had decided that
Admiral Sampson was in command at that
battle and Commodore Schley second in com
mand, t
This fact was before "he court: for the
secretary's' letter to the senate (dated Feb. 0,/
1899-) states that the Spanish squadron was
destroyed "by our fleet under his (Sampson's)
command"; and the advancement of Commo
dore Schley was proposed in recognition of
his services as "next in rank at the victory
of Santiago."
Xot Before tlie Court.
Third—The question as to who commanded
at Santiago was not "referred to the court
for consideration. Evidence bearing on the
point was excluded.
(a) If Commodore Schley was in command,
Admiral Sampson was not, and if the ques
tion as to which was in command was to be
considered by the court, surely Admiral
Sampson became an interested party and un
der the precept was entitled to the hearing
which was repeatedly refused him.
(b) The language of the precept excludes
the question as to who commanded at that
battle. It directs the court to inquire into
I the conduct of Admiral Schley—hot into his
status or as to whether or not he was in
command— and to "report its conclusions upon
his conduct in connection with the events of
the Santiago campaign."
(c) The judicial officers of the court main
tained that this 1 matter was outside the scope
of the inquiry. They expressed willingness to
go into it if their view should be overruled
but were, in every instance sustained by the
court. Thus at page 157, the assistant to the
judge advocate said: ~
"One further word as to a suggestion just
made as to the intention to show that Admiral
Sampson was not in this battle. I wish to
say that we do not understand that the ques
tion whether Admiral Sampson was or was
not in the battle of Santiago is before the
court. If it is' we shall be happy to investi
fgate it. * • • Until the case takes that
attitude it is improper to spread upon the
record arguments and questions which pro
ceed upon the theory that he is In the case."
Counsel for the applicant withdrew the
question.
At page 490 of the record the same matter
being under discussion, Mr. Hanna said: "If
it is the desire of the court to go into these
things it would, of course, be proper that we
should also go into them. It would not only
be proper, but It would be necessary. * * # *
We are thoroughly prepared to go into any
discussion of them, provided the court desires
to so enlarge and extend the scope of this
inquiry."
Court Acquiesced.
Counsel for the applicant again failed to
press the point and the court made no ob
jection to Mr. Hanna's view. At pages 153
and 1,080 there were similar rulings by the
judge advocate. In the case of all those
declarations there was acquiescence on the
part of the court.
(d) The court uniformly rejected evidence
as to who commanded. In all the pages here
in cited from the record the court rejected
such evidence and nowhere was' it admitted
against objection. ■ .*;";■
(c) The court more than once specifically
ruled that this question was not before it.
For example: At page 1.586, where the ques
tion was as to the position of the commander
in-chief and of the New York and as to the
part they took in the battle, Admiral
said: "We do not want that. We have ruled
that out." The judge advocate then asked
if the court had so ruled arid Admiral Dewey
replied: "We have. We have kept the-New
York out of it." See also page 481.
(f) The court ■went bo far as to rule at page
1,211 that Admiral Schlpy was not In com
mand during the battle. The matter then
before the court related to the period during
which Admiral Schley had been In absolute

/ Washington, Dec. There is no like
lihood, Mr. Lowry said to-day, that the

want to arrange with the government to
use any power to be developed by lock
and dam No. 2 at Meeker island.
"As I understand.," he added, "there is
a fall of only eight feet at the lock and

Rayner, you are confining yourself to July
3d, are you?"
Mr. Rayner in reply acquiesced in this view,
and the court ruled that "all questions * * *
shall be confined to between the 19th ot May
and the Ist of June, relating to the organiza
tion, management and control of that squad
ron when he was actually comuiander-in-
Chief. Matters referring to his alleged com
mand or July 3 were excluded. On page 443
the court confirms this decision.
Rejected or Withdrawn.
(g) All proposed questions on this subject
were either rejected by the court or with
drawn by the applicant, who finally acqui
esced in the decisions of the court and gave
up his efforts in this behalf, saying: "I bow
respectfully to the decision of the court, and
I know exactly what it means." Instances of
the withdrawal i>f such questions and of their
rejection by the court will be found in the
record at pages 138, 157, 484, 485 and 1080.
(h) The minority opinion expressed by Ad
miral Dewey in this matter is in variance
with all the rulings of the court in this re
gard and directly contradicts the letters
wherein Admiral Dewey, for the court, defines
Admiral Sampson's status. The na-vy depart
ment in its precept had justly provided that
any person "interested" might be given an
opportunity of appearing before the court in
person or by coui.sel and protecting his
rights.
As counsel for the applicant ignored at
times the court's rulings and spread upon the
records arguments reflecting upon Admiral
Sampson, we, his counsel, three. separate
times appealed to the court asking; for pro
tection or for permisison to appear and de
fend Admiral Sampson's rights. Each time
our request was denied and we were assured
that Admiral Sampson was not involved, and
finally Admiral Dewey, acknowledging the re
ceipt, of one of our letters, in which we had
appealed to him on the ground of this very
question as to who commanded at Santiago,
said: "I ha\e to state that while the precept
convening tnis court gives it authority to
permit any person whom it may regard as
concerned in the investigation to be present,
* * * the court considers that Admiral
Sampson is not aa interested party, * * •
and you are further informed that if circum
stances arose which in the opinion of the
court render it necessary for Admiral Samp
son to be represented, due notice will be sent
him."
Upon this promise Admiral Sampson relied.
The notice came only in the form of a minor
ity opinion by Admiral Dewey discussing
matters beyond the scope of the precept and
nowhere included in the facts found by the
court. Very respectfully,
—Stayton & Campbell,
', E. S. Theall.
Counsel for Rear Admiral W. T. Sampson.

BBARDSIiBB SPEAKS OUT
Admiral Doom Not Hesitate to Call

New York Sun Special Service
Albany, N. V.. Dec. 20. —Rear Admiral
Lester A. Beardslee. U. S. N.,- retired,
who i:*. in the city, said: :_;•;>.... , .: \,
Admiral Schley Is- a hero, and I am very
glad that George Dewey, admiral of the
United States, made that fact clear and in
disputable in his supplementary statement of
tho findings of the court .of inquiry. Had I
been a member of that court 1 should have
subscribed to the supplementary statement
of Admiral »Dewey, which makes all the es
sential facts plain. Admiral Schley has been
treated badly, and I must say that it is all
a shameful affair which navy officers in
general regret. I echo the sentiments of
Rear Admirals Erben and Miller, who have
commented oh this 'matter, and say, with
them, that the decison of the court removes
a charge of cowardice that should never have
been made against so brave and gallant ail
officer as Rear Admiral Schley.
Stated by Sampson'!) Doctor.
Washington, Dec. 20.—Dr. W. S. Nixon,
the physician in. attendance upon Admiral
Sampson, to-day made the following
statement:
The admiral is not in any immediate dan
ger. His body is in its usual condition. Ho
goes out for exercise every day, weather per
mitting. He goes to -the table for his meals.
He smokes bib cigar after dinner. He usu
ally sleeps well. He has not a trained nurse,

not feeble, but just in impaired health. His

Japs Will Be Kept at Home
Special to The Journal.
Chicago, Dec. 20.—Japan, seeking the good will of the United States, will for
as many years as may be necessary discourage emigration to this country. This
policy recently decided on by the mikado's government, has just been manifested
by the Japanese ambassador at Washington, who has asked the owners of a large
transpacific steamship line not to import several thousand laborers from Japan to
work in southern rice fields. The company will consequently decline a liberal offer
made it by southern planters and will likewise refuse similar contracts in the
future.
Mr. Shiraski, general manager of the Toyo Klsen Kaisha, or Oriental Steamship
company, says Japan, unlike China, is willing to keep its surplus laborers at home
rather than risk an interruption of its friendly relations wth the Unted States.
The Japanese officials take the view that their country owes in a large measure its
progress along the modern lines to the inspiration and help of the Unit«d States.

In That Case the House Would Give
the Bill a Black Eye.
POLITICAL SELF-PRESERVATION
Representative* Would Not Dare
Face Their Con»titnent» After
Voting? Such a Subsidy.
Mew York Sun Spools! Servian
Washington, Dec. —Senator Frye is
determined to push his new ship subsidy
bill through the senate without making so
much as a single change, and has given
notice that he will not permit anything
to interfere with his plans. Some of th©
leading members of the senate believe Mr.
Frye may be successful In getting the
subsidy bill through early in the season,
but they are equally confident it will be
shipwrecked In the house.
There are several reasons why it is be
lieved the bil willl not be adopted by the
lower branch of congress. The first is
that the members will soon have to make
their campaigns for re-election, and they
do not care to begin a battle for their
seats in congress after having voted for
a subsidy, the mention of which Is dis
tasteful to the people. Another reason
why it is believed this measure will not
go through the house is that the commit
tee on merchant marine 13 so badly di
vided that its members will be unable to
agree, upon a bill which will receive the
support of a majority of that committee.
Furthermore, the members of the house
have decided views on this subject, and
while nearly every republican and demo
crat is in favor of doing something to
build up the American merchant marine,
; owing to the conflicting opinions a measure
would not be adopted even if one is re
ported favorably by the committee.
TO PRISON
Diss De Bar and Her Accom
plice Sentenced to Penal
Servitude.
London, Dec. 20. —The jury returned a
verdict of guilty against both Theodore
and Laura Jackson (Ann Odelia Diss De
Bar), charged with immoral practices and
fraud. The judge sentenced Jackson to
fifteen years' and Mrs. Jackson to seven
years' ponal servitude.
Jackson made an address, in the nature
of a lecture, in which he claimed to be a,
man bound to single life by religious vows
and emphatically denied the testimony
furnished as lo his conduct with Daisy
Adams, whose story, he said, was a tissue
of falsehoods. He described the female
prisoner as a medium through whom he,
Jackson, had communication with his
"spirit wife."
Jackson, in his address, referred to his
estate of 7,280 acres of land in Florida,
and dwelt at great length on the princi
ples of Theocratic Unity.
During his cross-examination, Jackson
was very insolent to the solicitor general.
Sir Edward Carson. The judge warned
Jackson that he was injuring his case,
whereupon the female defendant inter
jected, approvingly; "That's right. Keep
him in order."
While the solicitor general was exam
ining Jackson, the latter casually re
marked: "If Swami (a name by which the
female defendant is known) is guilty, I
am guilty also."
Mrs. Jackson quickly arose to her feet
and refused to be included with Jackson
in the charge of criminal assault. Jack
son said his fellow prisoner had been In
jail twice.
Mrs. Jackson testified, and during her
cross examination the name Diss de Barr
was mentioned for the first time in court,
the witness admitting that she was the
divorced wife of General Diss de Barr,
adding that she had inherited a fortune
from him. The woman also admitted that
she had been married to a man named
McGool and to P. H. Messaut. She said
her income from the Diss de Bar property
was $14,000 yearly.

MAY EXPLAIN CERTAIN THINGS
He In on the Defensive Now and Hl*
Statement Will Be Eagerly
A-waited.
James J. Hill, president of the North
ern Securities company, the center of
more interest and the object of more
criticism than any other man in tha
northwest, walked serenely into the Great
Northern office building shortly before
noon to-day, accompanied by Vice Presi
dent James N. Hill and Louis W. Hill,
president of the Eastern Minnesota.
Mr. Hill looked tired and somewhat
worn as the result of the great battle he
has fought in the arena of Wall street,
and is apparently determined to get as
much rest as possible before he has to
take up the fight before him. It will be
a fight of defense this time Instead of
offense.
Before going into the Great Northern
building Mr. Hill's attention was drawn
to the fact that he would very likely b©
besieged by representatives of the news
papers, and he was asked whether or not
he would be interviewed. Mr. Hill re
plied that if he saw one reporter at this
time he would have to see them all. In
asmuch as he had matters which required
his immediate attention he would see no
one for the present and this ultimatum
was given out by Mr. Hill's secretaries.
At Work, on His Statement.
The Journal learned, however, that
Mr. Hill has decided to prepare a state
ment for the press In which he will make
an elaborate defense, or rather explana
tion of the objects of the merger. What
he will show is not known. That he im
mediately entered upon the task is cer
tain, for he sent for General Solicitor
Grover and had numerous clerks hustling
about for various statistics regarding
freight tariffs, etc. The president has at
hand a number of comparisons which it
is supposed he will use to prove his points.
When this statement apepars, it will be
the first authoritative utterance on the sub
ject of the merger. Mr. Hill has for rea
sons known to himself only, been as mum
as- a sphinx since the thing was plaaned,
excepting for ocacsional declarations that
the public was misinformed; that the
merger will be a good thing, etc. At last
the public is to know the why and where
fores.
M. I). Viiuiii of Counsel.
Attorney General Douglas declines to
discuss report that he has retained M. D.
Munn of St. Paul as associate counsel for
the state in the antimerger case. Mr.
I Munn has been in consultation with him,
however, and is believed to be connected
with the case in an advisory capacity. Mr.
Douglas was asked whether any eastern
counsel had been retained. He replied:
"I do not care to discuss the question
until the papers in the case have been
filed."
