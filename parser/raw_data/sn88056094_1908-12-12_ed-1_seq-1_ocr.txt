NEWS, VIEWS
AND GOSSIP
Lights and Sidelights on People
and Things In the Great
Metropolis.
NEW YORK, Dec., 12.—Not since
the jellyfish soul of Chester Gillette
was catapulted into the h. reafter by
an unfeeling electrical engineer—not
since the madman of Matteawan re
lapsed Into the innocuous dedsuetude
of an up-state-rest-cure resort—not
since those delectable days have the
sob sisters known such exultation as
is filling their throbbing buzzums on
this day and date. Bloodshed and
scandal and horrors permeate the
metropolitan atmosphere, and the sob
sisters sniff it as a sweet savor. Lurid
headlines shout out a story of sin
and shame, of sorrow and suffering,
of bloodshed and crime.
When T. Jenkins Hains, who with
his brother. Captain Peter C. Hains,
charged with the slaying of Wil
liam E. Annis, is placed on trial next
week, the sob sisters will hold high
revel of overworked adjectivee. No
murder trial in recent years has af
forded such an opportunity for ap
peals to passion and prejudice and
salacity.
For weeks the sob sisters have
been at work on their joyous task,
dissecting every emotion of the prin
cipals in the bloody tragedy, examin
ing every aspect of the famous case
and setting forth their theories in
lurid and Impressionistic chronicles.
Some have interviewed the mother
of the accused man. painting a word
picture of she whom they term a
"mother of sorrows." Others have
Indulged in attempts at analizlng the
character of T. Jenkins Hains, the
"ogre," the "sea-wolf." Captain
Hains has been the subject of many
ambitious efforts. One of these, sur
charged with pathos, seeks to bring
tears to the eyes of the reader in this
fashion:
"He was the most pathetic flgura
on earth—a young man broken on
the wheel of fate in his youth, the
Joy of living quenched forever for
him. old in sorrow before he is old
in years. He is the tallest of the
three brothers, a fine, soldierly, up
standing figure of a man that must
have been handsome enough to have
captured any girl's fancy when his
face was lit up by happiness, but now
he looks wan and pinched, as if some
cruel wind had blown over him and
Wighted him."
The gifted authoress shows great
knowledge of the verbal eccentrici
ties of spooks lu the following para
graph: >
"His face is the saddest human
face I ever saw, and his voice when
he speaks is like that of a ghost, so
•aid. so lifeless, so surcharged with
deathless woe is It."
And what sublimity of grief and
hopeless, helpless woe is in the con
tusion of his sob sister's tale:
HU voice trailed oft into silence
again, his brooding eyes bent upon
the table, where his hands were
drawing meaningless pictures, while
his thoughts, as in a treadmill, went
their weary, hopeless rounds of a
•orrow- for which there is no cure."
Hoor Peter Hains!"
"Poor Peter Hains." indeed. He
has many things to bear, and not the
leas: of these is the mock sympathy
of the sisterhood of sobs. And In
this sisterhood is his own wife, wrlt

PASTOR'S AUTOMOBILE
1» the Cmw of l YmtenUoa With Mem
ber* of His Flock
PORTLAND. Ore., Doc. 1$.—Dr.
W. T. Busier, formerly pastor of a
Lewiston (Idaho) church, now pastor
of the Sunnyside Methodlat church,
one of a few Methodlat pastors in the
northwest possessing sutomoblles,
has met with more trouble over the
gasoline horse." At last night's ses
sion of the church trustees a $30
freight bill for shipment of the ma
chine from Pendleton, the Rev. Bus
ter's recent pastorate, to Portland
was refused on the ground that it was
not a legitimate church debt. The
Rev. Mr. Euster has been compelled
to pay the bill from bis own salary,
which, by the way, was set at $1500
by this same board of church trus
tees. Dr. Buster says his automobile
has caused so much contention that
he has often wished he did not own
one.
Dr. T. B. Ford, who left Sunny
side church to take up the work
where Dr. Buster left off at Pendle
ton, has sent in a demand that back
salary to the amount of $200 be paid.
The original shortage, so the church
records should show, was $250,
but this claim was compromised at
$200 on the promise that it would be
paid. The churcb'a busineaa affair*
when examined last night were found
to be sadly tangled.
The Rev. Mr. Enater was Instru
mental in having the beautiful $60,
000 native stone Methodist church
constructed at Lewiston which is
now nearing completion. He is an
author of note and is well known as
the "church builder of the north
west."

SENATOR HEYBURN
Half ft Down Politician* Willing

LEWISTON, Idaho. Dec. ll-Froa
every part of Idaho coma reports
that an effort will ha made to defeat
denator W. B. Hey burn, gad there
la much speculation aa to th* com
bined strength of th* man who ar*
said to have a hand In tho plan to
change tha toga. State Chairman
Barney O'Neill of Wallaee haa boon
regarded as an active, although some
what secret, caadldato. O'Neill has
seat some of hla friends to Nog Pare#
county to approach tha legislators,
but It la said they received no en
couragement. for Net Perce will vote
for Ilsyburn. Those who are con
sidered receptive candidates for the
office of senator are: Governor-elect
Jamee H Brady, Supreme Judge A»
shle and possibly Governor Fraah R.
Gooding. With O'Nell thee* make
a formidable quartet, hut It le said
non* or them will oponly oppose the
Wallace statesman.
Hey burn stands a good ehaaco for
rselection because of the top-heavy
majority on joint billot, according
to local political prophets. On joint
ballot the republicans will have ft
votes, against na even 30 for tho
democrats, if those opposing Sena
tor ilsyburn can secure n score of re
publicans who will not enter n party
nomination end If n fight Is made
th# chances are that he will ho de
feated.
It la believed here that Heybern to
win must win on the first ballot,If St
republican* agree to vote agaltwl
him he will then need to draw one
vote from the democrats, and this Is
regarded as an Impossibility.
It Is generally believed that the
federal administration would not he
