This is going to be a hard winter
on the United States Treasury.
Thk office-seekers are making Con
gressman McComas's life a burden to
hin?.
Jkpfersox Davis is dead. Let him
that is without guilt first revile his
spotless character.
Thk G. A. R. evidently thinks that
the sole duty of Congress is to pass
reckless pension laws.
It may not be generally admitted,
but the thoughtful people of the
country expect a trreat deal from the
minority in Congress.
Thk Republican majority in Con
gress is very small and consequently \
quite uncertain. The majority will (
have to walk the chalk line.
AXOTHKR ocean steamer has beaten
the record. If this sort of thing keeps j
up there will soon be more w recks \
than records to make note of.
Although but little more than a
week has passed since it was made
public, there is not one echo heard
from the President's message.
Coxgrkssmkx are always very will
ing to spend other people's money,
but it goes mighty hard with them
when the joke is turned as Silcott
turned it.
Joh.N Waxamakkr, Postmaster
General and proprietor of the Phila
delphia bargain store, has just se
cured a government contract to fur- '
nish eighteen brass cuspidors to the
War Department at forty cents per I
cuspidor.
Skxator Mandkrsox, whose con
nection with the re-rating of pensions
under the Tanner regime is not al
together creditable to him. has intro.
duced a bill in the Senate which if
passed would make our pension ex
penditures run up into the billions.
Thk extraordinary sum of $97,210,
252 is demanded from Congress to
pay the pension bills for the next
year under the present laws. And
still the G. A. R. and the other pen
sion grabbers of the Republican
party are not satisfied, but are howl
ing at the doors of Congress for yet
more extravagant measures.
Thkrk is one position in Washing
ton that seems to go a-begging. It is
a place connected with the Geological
Survey, and pays $900 a year. But
the man who fills it must be a geolo
gist. terminologist, and a draughts
man, well up in paleozoic inverte
brate paleontology and mesozoic in
vertebrate paleontology. Now. who
wants the job?

Judge Brkwkr, who last week
was nominated by the President to
be a Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States, has been, we are
told, a farmer in Massachusetts, a
lawyer in Missouri, and a superinten
dent of public schools in Kansas.
We do not know when he was su
perintendent of schools in Kansas, but
we sincerely trust he is in no way re
sponsible for the following questions
and answers at a recent State exam,
ination of teachers of public schools
in that commonwealth. "W e quote
from the Western School Journal:
Question 1. What personal characteristics
of the settlers caused the threat difference be
tween the colonies of Virginia and Massa
chusetts?
Virginia: They were idle and wasteful.
There were comparatively few laborers
among their number, but a long list of forty
eight -useless gentlemen," and several par
doned criminals. They regarded themselves
as mere sojourners and adventurers, ex
pecting to dig gold, trade with the Indians,
get wealth and return home. They had dlf
nculty with the Indiana.
Massachusetts: They were not mere ad
venturers, but Industrious, educated, enter
prising and virtuous people. They came to
secure religious freedom, and with no ex
pectation of returning. They made a solemn
treaty of friendship with the Indians, which
was faithfully kept for fifty years.
What was the relative character of the first
settlers of Jamestown aud Plymouth?
The settlers of Jamestown were not accus
tomed to work, and came to the New Woild
In search of adventure and wealth. They
were therefore poorly fitted to be pioneers.
The settlers of Plymouth were hard-work
ing. God-fearing people. They came not for
wealth nor adventure, but to found home for
themselves aud their children. They were,
in brain, brawn and principle, well adapted
to lay broad, deep and solid the foundations
of a great commonwealth.
We suppose if the Kansas Jayhawk
ers are determined to teach their .
children such rot there is no law to
prever t it. But we would just like to
know who is responsible for the pro
mulgation of such untruthful, mean
and prejudiced ideas. We hope no
man has been or ever will be raised j
to high office who calls the witch. |
burners of Massachusetts educated
and virtuous people in the same
breath that he describes the patriotic
pioneers of \ irginia as idle and w asie
ful adventurers and criminals? who
teaches that the self-sacrificing sons
of the grand old "Mother of Presi
dents" were inferior to the narrow
minded, Puritanical settlers of New
England, who may possibly have
come in search of religious freedom
but who persecuted and destroyed
those who disagreed with them.
Did the late superintendent of
sehoole in Kansas subscribe to these
sentiments when be was engaged in
educational work in that State?
OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
Washington, D. C.,
December 10, 1889.
EdUor Register.? There was great ex
citement about the Capitol last Thurs
day morning when it was whispered
around that there was a defalcation
on the part of one of the officers of
the House. The defaulter is Craven
E. Silcott, of Ohio, the cashier to the
sergeant-at-arms, and the amount of
money he got away with is about
$72,000. He drew the money from the
Treasury Department to pay the sala.
ries of the members of Congress, but
instead of doing so went to New York
and is undoubtedly safe in Canada
with his ill-gotten gains. The cause
of Silcott's downfall is attributed to
betting on the races and running two
families at the same time. The com
panion of his flight is a woman who
has been quite notorious around
Washington for some time past. The
defalcation would have been impossi
ble were it not for the loose manner
in which business is conducted at the
Capitol, where no safeguards what
ever are thrown around the disburse
ment of public money. Many mem
bers of Congress are out sums of
money ranging from $500 to $5,000,
they having signed receipts for their
money before it was drawn from the
Treasury, but it is probable a bill will
be passed reimbursing them. Silcott
was a Democrat, and would have
been bounced in a few days.
Since the meeting of Congress the
different departments of the govern
ment have been overrun with mem
bers of Congress looking for places
for their constituents. The Postoffice
Department is visited by a larger num
ber of Senators and Representatives
than any other. The postoffices are
the magnet that draws them there.
It would seem that Cheap John
Wanamaker was bouncing enough
postmasters to satisfy the most impla
cable place hunter, but still there are
Republicans who claim that he is
going too slow. In the other depart
ments the pressure for places is
almost a> great, and the axe of the
headsman is falling right and left.
There was an interesting examina
tion held in the hall of the House of
Representatives Wednesday night. It
was strictly private, and was for the
purpose of selecting two reading
clerks for the House at the nice little
salary of $3,600 per year. The idea
of having the candidates for the
places rehearse their vocal powers in
private was conceived by Mr. Mc
Pherson, the clerk, who has the ap
pointment of the readers. Among
I the many other candidates who
! showed how nicely they could read
| were W. H. Wisner, of Martinsburg.
! and W. W. Meek, of West Virginia.
Nepotism has begun early in the
United States Senate this session.
Senator Moody, of South Dakota, is
the person who did it. He secured
the appointment of his son, Warreu
Moody, to be a page on the floor of
the Senate at $2.50 per day. < >fflcials
of the Senate, some of whom have
been in service a quarter of a century
or more, say that this is the first in
stance within their recollection when
a Senator's son has filled the office of
page. Probably the father could not
support his family on the salary of a
does not talk as much as Corporal
Tanner did, he gets there just the
same. During the month of Novem
ber there were 14.189 pension certifi
cates issued. The number of certifi
cates issued in the same month of
1888 was 10,087; of 1887, 8,002; and of
1886, 7,385.
Miss Jennie Harrison, of Grand
Rapids, Michigan, the daughter of a
cousin of President Harrison, has
been appointed to a position in the
folding room of the Government
Printing Office. If the family can't
get big salaries they are satisfied to
take little ones? but one more rela
tive is provided for, anyhow.
Speaker Heed to-day appointed
committees on Ways and Means, Ap
propriations, Manufactures, Elections
and Mileage. Mr. Wilson is the only
member from West Virginia appointed
as yet, and he heads the list on the
minority representation of the Com

The West Virginia Republican Asso
ciation lias elected John W. Mason,
S. M. Howard, C. M. Shinn and G. W.

Col. Jake Kemple, of Wheeling,
who calls himself "the celebrated

A Slap in the Face.
At Charleston, this State, last Sun
day morning W. A. McCorkle, a Dem
ocrat and prominent attorney of that
city, and the same gentleman who
defended aud cleared J. S. McDonald,
chairman of the Republican executive
committee of the district, in the cele
brated election bribery ease in the
United States District Court, was dis
cussing the case in the dining-room of
Hotel RufTner with Gen. George C.
Sturgiss, United States district attor
ney, who prosecuted the case, and
Gen. Sturgiss made a remark to
Mr. McCorkle about the burial of Jef
ferson Davie, when H. S. White, Uni
ted States marshal for West Virginia,
interrupted the conversation and said
to Mr. McCorkle, who is a Virginian
and whose people were all in the Con
federate army, that Jefferson Davis
ought to be buried in the Potter's
field. Mr. McCorkle remarked that
the Southern people did not intend to
humiliate themselves in the matter
of Mr. Davis's burial and left the
room. White came into the lobby a
few miuutes afterwards, and ap
proachiug McCorkle, the latter told
him that he was surprised at the re
mark, that it was uncalled for and
unkind to hiui, and White not offer
ing an apology, McCorkle slapped
his (White's) face with bis hand.
Friends interfered and prevented
further trouble. The matter has
caused a great deal of excitement,
and whether there will be a hostile
meeting between those gentlemen is
not as yet known. McCorkle, upon
slapping Marshall White, announced
to him that he would grant him any
satisfaction at any time and place he
(Marshal White) might name.

DEATH OF JEFFERSON DAVIS.
Jefferson Davis, the ex-President of.
the Southern Confederacy, died at
12.45 o'clock last Friday morning at
the residence of his Hfe-long friend, J.
U. Payne in New Orleans. The an
nouncement of the event created a
profound sensation, although the
death of Mr. Davis had been expected
at any tinl'e within the last month.
Four weeks ago. while traveling on a
river steamboat, he caught cold and
his condition became so serious that
his physicians refused to allow him to
return to his home in Mississippi.
Mrs. Davis was sent for and immedi
ately joined her husband and re
maiiied with him until the end. Mr.
and Mrs. Davis were as devoted to
each other as when in their youth
they eloped to be married.
For three days defore his death Mr. j
Davis had been getting steadily bet
ter, and was much improved, so the
physicians thought. AH dav Thurs
day the favorable symptoms con
tinued, but at 6 o'clock in the even
ing. without any assignable cause,
Mr. Davis was seized with a conges
tive chill which seemed to absolutely i
crush the vitality out of his already
enfeebled body. So weak was Mr.
Davis that the violence of the assault
soon subsided for lack of vitality ;
upon which to prey. From that mo
ment to the time of his death he sank :
gradually.
At 7 o'clock Mrs. Davis administered
some medicine, but the ex-President
declined to receive the whole dose.
She urged upon him the necessity of
taking the remainder, but putting it
aside with the gentlest of gestures, he
whispered, "Pray, excuse me."
These were his last words. Gradu
ally he grew weaker and weaker, but
never for an instant seemed to lose
consciousness. Lving peacefully upon
his bed. and without a trace of pain
apparent in his features, he remained
for hours. Silently clasping and ten
derly caressing his wife's hand, he
awaited the end.
Finding that Mr. Dav,s was breath
ing somewhat heavily as he lay upon
his back, the doctors assisted him to
turn upon his right side. With his
cheek resting upon his right hand,
and with his left hand drooping
across his chin, he lay for some tifteen
minutes breathing faintly. More and
more feeble became his respirations
until they passed into silt nee. and
then the watchers knew that the
father of the Confederacy had passed
away. After death the facc of the
deceased, though looking slightly
emaciated, showed no trace of suffer
ing.
It is believed that the foundation
of the ex-President's last illness was
malaria, complicated with acute bron
chitis. Careful nursing and skilled
medical attendants had mastered the
latter, but it is supposed that the con
gestive chill, the immediate cause of
death, was attributable to a return
of the malaria.
The news of Mr. Davis's death was
promptly telegraphed to all the lead
ing cities of the South, and thousands
of messages expressive of respect for
the dead Confederate and sympathy
with Mrs. Davis have been received.
Everywhere in the South there were
public manifestationsof sorrow. Flags
were at half-mast on the State Houses
in Atlanta, Montgomery, Richmond,
Jackson, Raleigh, Nashville, and
Columbia, and on public buildings
in many other cities. A fund was
started in Atlanta to erect a monu
ment. Montgomery sent an appeal
to Mrs. Davis to have the remains
buried there under the Confederate
monument, the corner stoue of which
is to be ornamented with a life-size
bronze statue of Mr. Davis, Memphis,
Richmond, Jackson, Miss., Atlanta,
and Macon made similar requests.
The Legislature of South Carolina
adopted resolutions of sympathy with
Mrs. Davis, alluding to her husband
as the most distinguished statesman
of the South and as "one of the ablest
and purest the country ever had.1'
The Virginia Legislature also appoint
i ?ie coniecVeJrate' Survivors' Associa
tion at Augusta and the Society of the
Army and Navy of the Confederate
States at Haltiinore arranged for
memorial meetings in those cities.
Meetings of citizens were arranged
for in other cities. At Augusta.
Charleston. Raleigh. Lynchburg. Nor
folk, Savannah, Memphis, Jackson,
Miss., Columbus, Ga., and elsewhere
shops were draped in black and bells
were tolled.
Jefferson Davis was born on June 3,
1808, iu what was then part of Chris
tian county, but is now Todd county,
Kentucky. His father was a planter,
and moved, while Jefferson was a
bov, to Wilkinson county in Missis
sippi. The boy received some aca
demic education at home, and then
went to Transylvania University in
his native State. At 10 he received
a West Point appointment and en
tered the Military Academy in the
same class with Robert E. Lee and
Albert Sidney Johnston. Graduating
in 1828, he was assigned to the infant- J
ry, and three years later won such
distinction as a staff officer in the ;
Black Hawk war that he was promo- !
ted in 1833 to the rank of First Lieu- 1
tenant and Adjutant in a new regi
ment of dragoons. This gave him i
two vears of active service on the
frontier in expeditions against the 1
Pawnees and other hostile Indians.
Mr. Davis had a taste for military
life and appeared likely to make a
good record in the army, but he was
ambitious of distinction in civil life,
and accordingly after seven years of
service, he resigned his commission in
the summer of 183o. A love affair had
its influence also, for shortly after
leaving the field he married the
daughter of Zachary Taylor, then a
Colonel in the army, and later Presi- j
dent. Returning to Mississippi he
became a cotton planter, a few miles 1
from Yicksburg, and lived for eight
years in retirement, devoting much
of his time to careful study with ref
ence to a public career. His first ap
pearance in politics was as a delegate
to the Democratic State Convention
of 1843, and he at once enrolled him- !
self as a follower of Calhoun.
Mr. Davis made swift progress in
politics. In 1844 lie was chosen a
Presidential elector on the Polk and
Dallas ticket, and in 1845 he was elect
ed Representative in Congress. He
heartily approved the Mexican war,
and he made in May, 1849, a strong
speech in favor of a resolution of
thanks to his father-in-law and the
officers and men of Gen. Taylor's army.
Two months later he joined that
armv, being elected in July Colonel of
the First Regiment of Mississippi Vol
unteers. He promptly resigned his
seat, overtook his command at New
Orleans, and was soon at the seat of
war. He led his troops gallantly in
the storming of Monterey in the* fol- ;
lowing September, being compliment
ed bv Gen- Taylor with a place on the j
commission appointed to arrange the
terms of capitulation, and he espgc- j
iallv distinguished himself at the bat- j
tie of Buena Vista. Feb. 23, 1847. where '
he was severely wounded.
In September, 1847. the Governor of
Mississippi appointed him to fill an
unexpired term in the Uuited States
Senate. The subsequent legislature
promptly re-elected him almost with
out opposition. He became conspicu
ous in the Senate as an advocate of \
States' rights, and at once took a fore
most place aiuong the gpeat men of
that day. In 1851 he resigne4 his
seat in the Senate to become a candi
date for Governor, for which office he
was defeated. jn 13.53 President
Pierce appointed Mr. Davis as bis
Secretary of War, and he held this
place until 1857, when he was again
elected to the Senate. He w^s iij the
front rank of orators and statesmen
in the troublous timet that ensued,
and in January, 1800. he resigned his
seat aud went South. When the 1
Confederacy was fonued he was
elected President by a unanimous
vote. His course as a brave and de
voted leader to the cause he had es
poused is well-known to all. At the
close of the war he was raptured near
Irwinsville, Ga., by Union soldiers.
He was taken to "Fortress Monroe,
where he arrived May 19, and was 1
confined almost two years. On May
10, 1867, he was removed to Rich
mond. arraigned in the United States
District Court upon the charge of ?
treason, and admitted to bail in
$100,000, Horace Greeley heading?
the list of bondsmen. After a brief
stav in Richmond, Mr. Davis went to
Canada. In the summer of 1868 an
offer of a partnership, without put
ting in any capital, in a Liverpool
firm, drew him to England, but he
concluded not to accept it. and after
a brief visit to France he returned.
At the next Democrat term of court
a nolle prosequi was entered by the
Government, and he was discharged,
while he was included in the general
amnesty proclamation of the follow
ing Christmas.
Mr. Davis settled in Memphis, and
became president of a life insurance
company, but after some years of
business life he retired to a comfor
table estate presented by an ardent
admirer at Beauvoir, on Mississippi
Sound. Here he has passed his old
age, spending much of his time in
study, and only occasionally issuing
forth to defend and glorify the "lost J
cause." In 1881 he published an elab
orate work entitled. "The Rise and
Fall of the Confederacy/'
Mr. Davis hasone child. Miss Winnie
Davis, who has been called the "Child
of the Confederacy." She was born
in Richmond during the war and is a
remarkably handsome woman. Miss
Davis is now traveling in Europe
with Mrs. Joseph Pulitzer.
Proceedings of the Confederate Memo
rial Association.
At a late meeting of the Confederate
Memorial Association of Shepherds- j
town a coiiimitee, composed of John
H. Zittle, Rev. L. R. Mason, Joseph ,
McMurran and Col. Win. A. Morgan, I
was appointed to draft a memorial
] and resolutions expressive of the feel- j
iiigs of the old Confederate soldiers j
: in reference to the death of the Hon. j
Jefferson Davis.
i The report of the committee was !
unanimously adopted, as follows :
We have heard with unfeigned sor
row of the death of our late beloved
! chief, ex-President Davis. Our grief
i is natural, and it is right and proper
i that we should feel deeply his death,
! as he has been made a vicarious sac
j rilice for us in suffering for long years
| for the acts of the whole people of
j the South. Hence, our mourning is
! unreserved and comes full from our
? hearts. As a soldier of undoubted
! courage, he turned the tide of battle
: in our favor in the dark hour at
Buena Vista; as Secretary of War, he
honored that office and made im
provements in that department that
, redound to his honoreveu to this day;
[ as a statesman, he was pure, honest,
i faithful to the interest of the whole
: country, and as a debater had few
< equals. Called to the Presidency of
' the Confederate States by the unani
mous voice of the Southern people in
their struggle for the maintainance
of their rights guaranteed to them iu
the Constitution in the only way left
them, he showed that same firmness,
honesty and purity of purpose that
had always characterized his public
acts, and in the long years of suffer
ing and persecution which he has
since endured, and under the intense
hatred and misrepresentation heaped
upon him. lie has maintained that
i same quiet dignity, noble manhood
! and Christian spirit that always marks
the true hero.
We gave him our ready obedience
j when he was our President; we gave
j him our heartfelt sympathy and
i love when he was in prison and in
irons and exposed to all sorts of in
sult for our sakes; when in the re
tirement of his private life, and still
persecuted by liis enemies, we gave
ftitU .ftM* .ftiimijatl^y JWi-esTfrom his
sorrows and sufferings, we would be
untrue to ourselves, did we not honor
his memory. Therefore:
Resolved, 1st, That we, the surviv
ing soldiers of the "Red Cross," will
ever cherish the memory of Jefferson
Davis, as a man of untarnished honor,
a statesman pure and honest, a true
j hero and patriot, worthy of imitation
| by all who would honor their country
| of become worthy of the confidence
I of their tellowiuen.
Resolved, 2(1, That we display the
! national flag at half mast furled and
i draped in mourning, during Wednes
I day December 11, 1S89, the day of the
funeral of the great chieftain of the
i South.
Resolved , 3d, That we extend to Mrs.
i Davis our heartfelt love and syinpa
i thy in her sad bereavement, assuring
her that we, the old soldiers of the
South, unite and join with her in the
common sorrow that has fallen upon
our whole Southland.
Resolved , 4th, That a copy of this
! proceeding be forwarded to Mrs. Jef
' ferson Davis, that it be put upon the
1 record of the Association, and the
papers of the county be requested to
publish it.
Resolved , 5th, That Memorial Servi
ces be held in the Episcopal Church
of this place on Wednesday, the 11th
of December, between the hours of
12 and 1 o'clock, the Chaplain of the
Association, Rev. L. Ii. Mason, officiat

Memorial services for ex-President
Jefferson Davis were held in the Epis
copal Church of Shepherdstown on
Wednesday at 12 o'clock? the hour
when the funeral of Mr. Davis took
place at New Orleans. The services
were conducted by the rector of the
church Rev. L. Ii. Mason; Rev. Charles
(ihiselin, of the Presbyterian Church,
formerly of Virginia; and Rev. J. R.
Van Horn, of the M. E. Church South,
who fought and bled for the lost cause
After the service of the ohurch had
been said. Rev. Mr. Mason, who was
one of the boys in gray himself and
battled fur his principles on many a
hard-fought field, delivered an address.
He made a solemn and impressive
appeal to the living to prepare them
! selves for the last great call. Paying
a high tribute to the character of the
leader who sacrificed so much and
who endured so much, he urged his
hearers to emulate those high trait*
i of manliness and courage and patience
and purity of personal and public life
that were exemplified in the dead
leader. No word of bitterness was
spoken, and the rector pointed out
qqly lesions of love and true manli
ness. Mr. Mason was followed by
Hon. A. R. Boteler, a member of the
Confederate Congress, who added his
tribute of praise, speaking from his
personal knowledge of the ex-Presi
dent. The Confederate veterans of
this community attended the services
in a body, headed by Col. W. A. Mor
gan, Commandant. The church was
filled with people from the town and
surrounding country, and the deepest
interest was manifested. The chancel
furniture was heavily draped in black
and at the headquarters of the veter
ans the flag was furled at half-mast
%nd carried the badge of mourning.
The business houses were closed
during tbe services.
