POINTS FRO THE MESSAGE
President HABEISOX favors
Making offenses against the treaty rights
of foreigners in this country cognizable in
the federal courts Suggested by the New
Orleans affair
A judicial construction of the rights of
I the United States where vessels violate
the neutrality laws in the interest of par
ties not recognized as belligerents This
grows out of tho Itata case
Temporary provision for the admission
or Chinese artisans and laborers in connec
tion with the Worlds fair

the icarauguan Canal company to an
amount necessary for its completion
Legislation to place labor contracts on the I
Vest India islands under the supervision

Improvement of the harbor Pearl river

Noninterference with the present silver

Additional and liberal appropriations for
the army and navy
The adoption of a smokeless powder and
modern rifles
Limitation of the right of the supreme

An appropriation for a female reform

Legislation to remedy the defects in tho
law to prevent Chinamen coming to this
1
country I
A stringent code relating to crimes
against chastity in the District of Colum
his I I
Extension of the free delivery mail sys I
tem to towns of 5030 > inhabitants
Education of Indian children in mixed
schools
Representation of the five civilized Indian
tribes in Congress
A deficiency appropriation to open up I
the Cheyenne and Arapahoe reservations
I I

Relinquishment by the United States of I

Nonsurrender of the power of the gay

Utah
Town governments in Alaska
Adequate appropriation for the civil ser

Legislation to protect the lives of rail
road employees
A constitutional amendment to secura I
uniformity in the choice of presidential 1 I
electorsor to prevent Michiganiziog I I
A nonpartisan commission to consider I
plans to correct evils of our election system 1 I
The President is absolutely silent on the i
subject of reciprocity and this exclusion
extends to the word Itself On the tariff i
and silver questions he contests himself I I
with a substantial repetition in addition i
to n synopsis ot tho treasury report I
of his utterances in his speeches There
I I
is no hint about a veto In case Congress
passe a free coinage act and altogether
Mr HAIUUSON treats the subject in a rather I I
more conservative tone than was to have
been expected
The flaming war declarations toward
Chili that the correspondents huve been
predicting as a startling feature of the
message dwindle down to a few diplomatic
expressions more peaceable than belliger
ent Thero is indeed very littlo Jin
goism in the document which is as spirit
less on the subject of foreign relations s La
the most Quakerish of V s
Pennsylvania constituents could Wish It I I
is quite easy to see that Mr BLAINE in the
construction of the message had very little 1 I
to do Even tho glory of the apothoosis of
the American hog abroad is thrown upon
the agriculturaldepartment I I
Mr HARRISON Is evidently well satisfied
with tho pension business both in Itself I
and in the methods of administration and i I
points proudly to the gratifying fact that
the persons to whom these pensions are I I
given aro men who rendered not slight but I
substantial war service as though there
never was a fraudulent claim nor a bogus
pensioner I
The chief magistrate appears to be very
much exercised about the action of the
state of Michigan in adopting the plan of
choosing presidential electors by congres
sional districts and goes Into < an undigni
fied and unbecoming political argument
relating to gerrymandering and cognate
I I
subjects on which he might if he
chose cot a few pointers from the j I
behavior of his party in New York Penn I
sylvania Iowa and many other states to
say nothiug of that of his own appointees I I
In the territory of Utah The suggestion I
of a commission to propose a plan for the I
correction of tho evils growing out of the I
exercise of the rights of suffrage is right
amusing reading in view of the Presidents
own notion represented by tease pinks of j
propriety and saints of an enfranchised
American people the majority of the Utah
commission I I
I
HOW DO ThEY LIKE IT7
THE HEUALD imagines that Its Republi I
can friends In this territory and especially
those of the Mormon faith will discover a I
bad taste in their mouths this morning be
fore finishing the Presidents message It I
isnt much that HIUHISON says regarding
Utah but that little is sufficient to convey
the Information that ho takes no stock in I
I the political movement which has recently
taken place here and furthermore that he
has very slight faith in the honesty and
sincerity of the Mormon people in their pro
fessed abandonment of polygamy He
gives them no credit for what they have
done but says their compliance with the
law is due to tho fact that they have come
to the conclusion that resistance is un pro St
able and unavailing Ho is emphatic in the
declaration that Congress should not lose
its absolute control over the territory until
it has satisfactory evidence that the peoplo
will not return to their former practices
and says
The question is not whether those peo I I
pie now obey tho laws of Congress against
polygamy but rather would they make I I
enforce and maintain such laws themselves
If absolutely free to regulate tho subject I i
We cannot afford to exporiment with this
subject for when a state is once consti
tuted tho net Is final and any mistake ir
remediable No compact in the enabling
act could in my opinion ba binding or ef i
fective
Of course this cuts no figure iu the af
faire of Utah The casting of doubt by the I
President upon the honesty of the people
will have no effect upon thoso people or at
least not tho effect to make them Insincere
and dishonest As a church tho Mormons
nave forbidden polygamy As Individuals
they have ceased to marry polygamously
These are facts which cannot bo gainsaid
by the President however meanly he may
slur the people who have finally accepted
the laws and conformed their conduct to
the sentiment of the American people
The purpose of the President is apparent
and that aim is inspired by the fact that ho
retains tbe attitude which he and his party
have so long held ref ualag to recognize tho
changed conditions He apprehends a
movement for statehood and would put ob
stacles IB the way Inasmuch as statehood
is something concerning which very fRW
Daaal3 hf5i am in the least exer
cised he is wasting effort Never
theless he confesses his hatred of
the Mormons and In language which we
imagine they will not fail to understand
says to Congress that he regards the Saints
as a band of hypocrites who should be held
under surveillance lest with the freedom of
Americans they turn criminals
THE HERALD does not apprehend that
either its Gentile or Mormon Republican
friends will point with pride to the Utah
reference In the message or that they will
use tho paragraph as a campaign document I
OMINOUS
There is an ominous omission In the
Presidents message It will be recalled
that in a previous message ho took strong
gro und In favor of the admission of the ter
ritories and in his swlngingroundthocir
cle speeches last spring he seemed never to
tire when boasting of the fact that six of
the dependencies had been erected Into
states during his administration In the
abstract it Is something to be proud of and
a little l manifestation of pride on the part of
the President ought not to be regarded as
out of place When we reflect however
on the manner in which those territories
were admitted to the union and on why
they were made states we are less disposed
to give the President credit for laudable
motives in what he did Rather are he
and his
party deserving of censure
Justice and right bad not the
east influence In directing their action
They cared nothing for the people Par
tisan politics alono controlled them They I
did not even take into account the ability
of the communities to maintain state
gov
ernments Would the new states return
Republican Senators Would they choose
Republican Presidential electors These
were tho questions which HARRISON ant
hi s party asked and getting affirmative
answers from six of the territories the half
dozen were rushed Into the union Whereas
tho two which
gave negative replies were
kept out although tho latter wore in every
respect better qualified for the duties and
responsibilities of statehood than were some
of f those which were admitted The
parti
san nature of the business was flagrantly
emphasized In tho cases of Idaho and
Wyoming The former was Demo
cratic so far as the popular vote
was concerned and would therefore
choose Senators and Presidential electors
of that political faith That obstacle must
bo overcome and this was how it was done
Onethird of the population chiefly Demo
crats were disfranchised thus leaving
the Presidents party largely In the major
ity i The excuse for this was that the dis
franchised were Mormons and could not
safely be entrusted with citizenship This
plea flimsy and ludicrous it was might
have 1 passed with some degree of success if
It I i had been employed further but when
the 1 party came to cross tho line into Wy
omlng it found
that
the Mormons were
largely l 1 In the habit of voting the Repub
lican l 1 ticket and to disfranchise them
there would be to make tho state
Democratic The proposition to deny the
ballot to Mormons
in Wyoming was
as abhorrent to
HAKHISON and his party as
it i had been to permit them to enjoy the
privilege of suffrage In Idaho
Thus is loon the bollovrness of the Presi
dents boast regarding the admission of s
he territories
Now it is noted that HARRISON has noth
ing i to say about letting the territories I
notwithstanding his deep solicitude two
years ago Two of the dependencies arA
well prepared for taking on the now and
aud more important conditions and roo I
sponsibilities and it is known that they I
will at once apply for admission to the i
union i but they are Democratic henco
HARRISON has no use for them and say
nothing We say this omission Is ominous
It portends opposition on the part of the
President and his party to tho admission
lof Arizona and New Mexico If tho op I
position shall be
asserted our ambitious
neighbors will bo held bock a couple of
years until a Democratic administration I
can let them in
