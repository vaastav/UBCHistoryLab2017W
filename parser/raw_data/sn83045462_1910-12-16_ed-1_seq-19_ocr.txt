! I BETTER BOOKKEEPING NEEDED
Essential if Municipal Graft Is to Be
Successfully Fought, Says
Prof. E. C. Meyer.
t
djwl-1
KH W*.
MRS. CAROLINE B. CRANE.
It is probable Washington will be
chosen as the permanent convention city
t for the American Civic Association, judg
ing from the sentiment manifested at the
session this morning, when Secretary
Watrous announced that such was the
desire of many delegates. Mr. Watrous
said the final selection for next year's
convention was in the hands of the executive
committee, which was considering
invitations from civic and commercial
bodies in Minneapolis, Portland, Ore.; St.
Louis, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Fla.,
and Birmingham, Ala.
Telling the delegates they could not at
present fight civic graft effectually because
poor systems of city bookkeeping
made it impossible. to confront inefficient
or dishonest city officials with tell-tale
figures. Prof. E. C. Meyer of the census
office advised civic reformers to direct
their efforts first at reforms in city systems
of accounting and bookkeeping.
"Unless you can go to the poor city
servant with figures showing his faults
and say 4you are inefficient.' and can
show through figures printed in the' newspapers
such inefficiency of dishonesty,
your efTorts will be vain," said Mr. Meyer.
Must Have the Figures.
"In most places where civic reform is
needed we are taiking against a stone
wall because we have not the figures and
facts to back up our allegations, but
wherever figures have finally become obtainable
what upheavals have resulted!
For instance, look at Pittsburg."
Prof. Meyer promised his hearers that
if they would see to the installation of
improved systems of bookkeeping and
accounting, the census bureau would see
to it that the figures were obtainable in
time to be of come use to civic reformers.
The talk of Mrs. Caroline Bartlett Crane
of Kalamazoo. Mich., on "Civic Co-operatton
Toward a Clean City" was an
astute analysis and criticism of methods
employed in the care of streets and alleys
in many cities. Mrs. Crane is considered
an authority on this subject. She* explained
the best kinds of pavings for
different s'.reets; she told how to sell
franchises to street railway companies
to the protection of the municipality;
how to collect fearbuge and how to prevent
tiles and mosquitoes.
Mrs. ("ran? advocated the placing of
street cleaning and ash and garbage collections
under the direction of boards of
health. 4?he wants all alleys as well
paved and lighted as adjacent streets.
For Well Lighted Alleys.
"Well lighted alleys," she said, "will
be a great aid to the public morals and
the efficiency of the police deepartment."
Furthermore, Mrs. Crane advocated the
examination of policemen and police court
judges in city ordinances regulating sanitation.
Miss Zona Gale of Portage, Wis., read
a very humorous story entitled "Friendship
Village Improvement Sodality," and
her talc was an eloquent word picture of
the results that could be accomplished in
the general improvement of civic conditions
in small towns and villages.
After reading her paper Miss Gale
pointed still more closely to the moral of
her story when she said that It Is not
leadership that is needed in the smaller
municipalities, because that leadership
already is there, though, she^said, it is
wasting its energies on matters of little
Importance.
"What the towns and villages need,"
said she, "are to be told what they
should do. If they are given the best
of the advanced ideas on civics they will
do for themselves without further outside
assistance."
A letter was read from Mrs. Philip
North Moore, president of the General
Federation of Women's Clubs, expressing
regret at her Inability to attend the
convention, and promising continued cooperation
both for herself and her organization.
Billboard Question Discussed.
I Clyde L. Day, assistant corporation
j counsel of Chicago, addressed the convention
on. "Legal Control of the Billboard."
Mr. Day said in part:
"While the billboard has existed for
several generations, it has not until the
last decade come to be looked upon as
hurtful to attractive surroundings and a
menace to those essential elements of
civic life, safety, health and morality.
"In the great commercial life of today
the billboard may have its legitimate
part as a medium of advertising, but I
confess that I am unable to see where
any community would sustain any substantial
loss if all billboards were blotted
out of existence. But, when we consider
the selfishness of mankind where a
business proposition is involved it is idle
for a moment to hope that the billboarders
will loosen their grip in any degree
until compelled by law to do so.
"It must be conceded that all locations
_ are not improper locations for billboards;
- that matter which is not immoral may
r reasonably be placed upon them; that
they may be constructed of such material
and be of such size and so erected as
e not to be detrimental to public welfare."
e Mr. Day cited instances where state
e legislatures have granted to cities and
^ villages express charter power to con*
trol billboards, notable among those
states being New Jersey, Iowa and lllic"
nois. He said the billboard interests fear
i, such enactments by the state legislatures
T more than any other restriction.-.'
' The Smoke Nuisance.
k
"The Stnoke Nuisance and the Law"
was the subject of an exhaustive discussion
by Cyrus Lecher of the Cleveland
T Chamber of Commerce,
e "That objectionable smoke may be pree
vented has been demonstrated by exl"
perience by careful firing and by mechanical
appliances designed to perfect the
draught," said Mr. Locher.
"The source of power of governmental
authority to abate the smoking nuisance
d is the police power of the state, and the
it sunt of the definitions of police power"
n is that, in its broadest acceptations. It
means the general power of the govern

ment to preserve and promote the public
welfare. A state legislature may. and
frequently does, confer on municipal corporations
the power to declare what shall
be deemed nuisances within the city limits.
Even without special grant or authority
municipal corporations may, as
a common law power, cause the abatement
of nuisances that are such, per sr.
It has been held by courts that the
words 'emission of dense black or gray
smoke' are vague and uncertain, but
these decisions are outweighed by the
trend of later decisions throughout the
country. The ordinary man knows what
'dense' smoke is, and the juryman may
be trusted with such testimony. Juries
and courts will not pretend to be more
ignorant than the rest of mankind.'.'
Extermination of Fly.
The afternoon session opened with the
reading of a report of Edward Hatch, jr.,
of Xew York, chairman of the "fly-fighting
committee." Mr. Hatch was suddenly
called away and-his report was read by
ti. Anorews 01 rsew lcr*. me enure
session this afternoon is being: given over
to the discussion oftlie house fly and
means for its extermination.
The report of Mr. Hatch outlined, as the
most important work for the coming year
in the campaign of extermination to be
waged against the house fly, an educational
campaign in the public scnools
through the medium of prize essay contests.
Discusses "City Beautiful.''
The average citizen's conception of the
"oity beautiful" was ridiculed by Arnold
W. JBrunner, president of the New York
Chapter, American Institute of Architects,
at lite afternoon session yesterday.
"To the average citizen the 'city beautiful'
suggests the city impossible, devised
by the man impractical," lie said.
"This dislocated adjective has heen the
cause of much terrified misapprehension,
and boards of aldermen and city treasurers
are apt to believe that it means an
attempt to tie pink bows on the lamp
posts. Great extravagance Is feared, and
at least a general disturbance of business
is anticipated."
Secretary of the Treasury MacVeagh presided
for a time at the afternoon session.
Mr. MacVoagh, In a short talk on "City
Planning," predicted that soon It would
be the expected thing to draw up plans
for the building and extension of a city
as is done now for a single building.
Frederick Haw Olmsted, chairman of
the Boston commission ot line arts, spoke
on "City Planning,"
"City planning Is not a mere matter of
chic centers, or of boulevards, or of
streets and public grounds," said Mr.
Olmsted.' "It is a matter of successful
correlation of all the elements of the
physical city. It is a work for the whole
community."
John Nolen of Cambridge, Mass., spoke
of planning for small towns and villages.
George B. Dealcy of Dallas, Tex., spoke
on "Getting Into Action for a City Iian,"
and Harold J. Howland spoke of the difficulty
in getting a vote for a city plan.

Swedish Girl to Be Put Under Treatment

Jenny Nielsen, twenty-one years old,
was sent to Washington Asylum Hospital
last night for treatment and observation,
her conduct at the house of Elmer Murphy,

Miss Nielsen came to this country from
.Sweden about six weeks ago, and went
to the Murphy home to visit a friend who
is employed there. Last night she appeared
in the dining-room in a peculiar
costume and persisted in laugliing and
singing while she served the tabic.
The young woman was taken to the
hospital in the eighth precinct patrol
