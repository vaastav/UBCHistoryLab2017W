ATHENS, Dec. 10—The allies con
tlnue their retreat toward the Greek
frontier. Salonika dispatches today
reported the retirement of the French
forces from Demlrkapu and declared
the belief is growing that the expedi
tionary forces may evacuate Serbian
territory entirely. The Bulgarian ad
vance guard is reported to have reach
ed the Greek border.
The Bulgars have changed their
tactics. Instead of using sharp night
attacks they are now hammering at
the Anglo-French forces on the en
tire front, forcing the allies to give
way before sheer weight of numbers
and superiority in metal.
The British are now bearing the
brunt of the fighting. Massed Bul
garian divisions are assailing the
British front near Valandove. Their
plan evidently is to batter in the
British line near the Greek frontier,
thus forcing the hasty retirement of
the entire expeditionary force. The
extremely cold weather strongly fav
ors the success of the Bulgarian oper
ations. The troops under General Sar
rall have suffered intensely from the
cold. The Bulgarians, accustomed to
fighting among the hills In the dead
of winter, find the weather to their
liking.
Not more than 5,000 8erblan regu
lars are now believed to remain on
Serbian soil, exoluslve of those re

BERLIN, (via Amsterdam) Dec. 10.
—The German press today voiced
practically unanimous approval of
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg's
statements on peace before the relch
stag yesterday.
The same endorsement came from
business men, professional men and
men of all classes In Berlin. They
agreed that the chancellor made an
admirable'statement of Germany's po
sition and that he showed conclusive
ly that responsibility for the continu
ance of the war must rest with -^.r
many's enemies.
The Kreuz Zeltung and Boe.'Gen
Zeltung commented:
"The chancellor has said what all
good Germans have thought."
The Lokal Anzeiger declared that
the world must now realize that Ger
many fights not to conquer but for her
own protection, and added:
"The chancellor expressed clearly
the desires of Germany, peaceable
now as before the war. He notified
the world that Germany Is willing for
peace—the sooner the bette if It
brings what we absolutely want."
The Vossische Zeitung laid particular
stress on Bethmann-Hollweg's dtate
ments that the longer the war lasts
the greater will be the secu.-'Hes for
the future that Germany will demand.
V^hlle the chancellor's speech just
now Is the overshadowing topic of
discussion It Is a fact that offloials
and the Berlin public are almost as
much Interested In the attac «nsde
by President Wilson In his message
to congress on oertaln foreign born
citizens of the United States. It Is
accepted here that they were dlrectod
at German-Americans and Austro
Amerlcans. German officlala profess

editor of the Hungarian periodical

charge laid before the attorney gen

The Incident was regarded as paral

of James F. J. Archibald as a mes
senger. Justice department agents
were today investigating whether
Braun used an American passport.
A letter from Baron Zwledinek re

been given by Braun i^ras reported to

American liner Oscar II, now the Ford

papers were found and retained by
British officials resulting in the pres

American passport and this fact was
known by Zwledinek and Von Nuber
tho ouster of the latter two officials
Is considered a foregone conclusion.
