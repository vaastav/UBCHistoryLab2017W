SENATOR MOORE FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE SENATE.
Governor Warfield and ex-Govemor
Jackson have declared for Sen. Moore
for President of the Senate, anil it is
generally conceded that with this in
fluence and the following of ex-Gover
nor Smith combined, all doubt of Mr.
Moore's election has been swept away.
Governor Warfield said:
“1 am not going into jxvlitioal com
binations or playing politics, but I will
say that 1 would like to see Colonel
Moore made President of the Senate,
lb- is a good man and well qualified to
fill the place. Furthermore, I believe
he will be elected.”
Mr. Jackson has gone South on busi
ness. but before leaving on Tuesday he
said: "I shall use all the influence I
possess to secure the honor for Senator
Moore.”
Knowing politicians say that Jackson
and Smith have buried the hatchet and
will, in the future, be found pulling
together.
THE MESSAGE.
The President's message is a very
readable document. There is so much
of the President’s personality in it. and
there is so little of time-honored forms
of official expression, that it has rather
the effect of a speech or a letter than a
State paper. Among the evils to be
corrected he mentions over-capitaliza
tion. He urged more perfect regula
tion of railroads, beacuse he is opposed
to public ownership, and believes that
this can be averted only by preventing
what are now common wrongs. That
private car lines, refrigeration, terminal
roads, elevators and all other adjuncts
of the transportation business should be
under the same control as same the
railroads is insisted upon, and excessive
as well as discriminating rates must be
prevented. The requirement of block
signals is advised.
In the interest of labor there are sug
gestions regarding the protection of
railway employees and employers lia
bility and the investigation of the con
dition of women in industrial establish
ments; but there are no specific recom
mendations. In regard to “government
by injunction,” the President is positive
that the right of the Courts to issue
injunctions in labor disputes should not
be prohibited, but suggests hearing
Imth parties before an injunction shall
lie issued.
Whether insurance companies can he
brought under Federal control without
an amendment to the Constitution he
refers to the consideration of Congress.
The tariff being a subject on whicn the
Republican party is divided, his refer
ence to it is brief and colorless; he in
vites Congress to consider whether the
maximum and minimum tariff may not
be a good thing. He favors economy
except in the navy and the Panama
Canal. Yet as to the navy he is sur
prisingly moderate, in view of his pre
vious expressions and the recommenda
tions of Secretary Bonaparte. For the
present he thinks the navy large enough,
and would only add a battleship a year,
maintaining practically the present num
ber of units, but replacing obsolete ves
sels with modern ones.
He points out the lack of elasticity in
the currency and advises remedial legis
lation, and one of the most important
of his recommendations is the public ac
counting of campaign funds. The pro
tection of neutral rights and property
at sea is urged. He has a very poor
opinion of the extension of the coast
wise laws to Philippine shipping, and
advises the postponement of the appli
cation of the law till litOA, if it is to he
applied at all. In regard to subsidies
he merely commends the report of the
Merchant Marine Commission to the at
tention of Congress. He asks that
citizenship be conferred on the Porto
Iticians and in the interest of the de
velopment of our islands he advises
that the granting of franchise !m* per
mitted. I‘hiladrlf‘liiu lire.ml.
