Next Tuesday is the day set for South
Carolina to meet in convention to consid
er thu matter—of course no other consid
eration than secession will be allowed in
the convention. Magrath, Miles, Rhett
and Spratt, all loud secessionists have
been elected to the convention from their
respective districts. A bill was submit
ted to the Legislature on Thursday pro
viding for public hollidays. It omits the
Fourth of July, It seems that they do
uot care to remember the days of Sump
ter, Marion, Ilayne, Ac. Liberty is not
to their taste —tliey prefer treason and
anarchy.
Itsjr Congress convened a week ago
hist Monday, ar.d went immedietely to
work earnestly aud, in the lluuse, practi
cally. The homestead Bill was called
up by Mr. Grow, so amended as to avoid
the objections made by the President in
his veto message of the last session, and
was passed by the handsome vote of 132
toTti. The Pension Bill, together with the
Military Academy Bill, was also passed.
Thus three important measures are pass
ed in the House in the middle of the first
week's session, and the President's Mes
sage was read the second day instead of
the thiid week of the session. This dis
patch of business argues well for the en
ergy of the Republican members.
A committee was appointed to consid
er the state of the Nation. We -ive the
©
names elsewhere. It wiil not amount to
any given sum, as far a we can judge.
The Southern StlusU'r.
The slave holders have ruled the na
tion so long—have had their hands so
uninterruptedly deep down into the na
tional Treasury, filling all the important
offices with their adherents; that tliev
are enraged at the prospect of being dis
missed from the fat places heretofore
held by them
The Union being no longer under their
control they threaten to destroy it, and
their allies in the North, knowing that
their rule is ended, unless the Republi
cans can be frightened ir.to makii g con
cessions to the Have power, are busv
magnifying the dangers likely to befal
our glorious Union If any considerable
number of leading Republicans can It
frightened into an abandonment of the!
Chicago Platform, the Slave power and
its Northern allies know very well that
the ptople will abandon the R- public it)
party ia disgust, and licnce the furi-. us 1
bluster of the South, and the terribl••
muss in central- If the Republicans will
only stand firm for a few months, the
Slavery question will be settled, peacei
will be restored, freedom will tiiu nph.
and the nation wiil enter on a new era ot
greatness.
But if our friends are friyhtcned by
the treasonable threats of the slave hold
ers into the slightest concession, then the i
Republican party will go to pieces, t!i
Slave-power will resume its control of the
Government, and the opponents of slav
ery will form another party and the fight
will go on fiercer than ever, for there is
an irrepressible conflict between Freedom
and Slavery. Take no step backward
in the true course for all earnest men. —
We coufess to be a little uneasy at the
present danger of the country. But our
uneasiness is all occasioned by the feai
that weak kneed republicans may cave
in to the clamor of the slave holders and
their allies, for a repeal of Northern Per
sonal Liberty Bills, a Slave code for the
Territories aud other like demands ; to
aompromisc is but to commence a new
fight; for anti Slavery is as certain to tri
umph in the end, 3s that virtue is more
onduriDg than vice.
The President's .Message,
i'liis important State document has
oems to hand, and we have carefully read
that portioQ which relates to the ail ab
sorbing qucstiou of secession. Its firm
position and oonei iitoiy tone and temper
had been so much commented uron, as
'
to incline us to look for a calm, dispas
sionate and unprejudiced vindication of
the rights of the States not merely, but
of the stern duties of Federal authority
Making duo allowance however for the
trying position in which the President
finds himself placed in the present crisis
of national affairs, aud much as we desire'
to say something for the retiring Execu
tive which shall commend him in Ins last
moments to the prayers and benedictions
of the people, we give up in despair, and
can do no better than set down this his
... last Message. i disastrous failure The
| Message opens in tlie following words :
" Fellow Citizens of the Senate ami
; House of liepreieiitatices:
: " Throughout the year since our Inst
meeting, the country lias been eminently
prosperous in all its material interests.
| The general health lias been excellent,
our harvests have been abundant, and
plenty smiles throughout the land. Our
commerce and manufactures have been:
prosecuted with energy and industry, and
have yielded fair and ample returns. In
short, no nation in the t.de of time has
ever presented a spectacle of greater ma
terial prosperity than we have done until
within a very recent period."
This glance at the benefactions of the
past, is the ouiy ray of sunshine which
appears throughout the weary mazes of
this cheerless document. After asking a
siugle question, as follows :
4i Why is it, then, that discontent now
so extensively prevails, and the Union of
the States, which is t lie source of all these
! blessings, is threatened with destruction?" ,
This questio # n ho proceeds to answer by
an enumeration of all the grievances un
der which the South is claimirg to suffer.'
Here, again, wo cannot fail to quote from
the Message, the following language :
'•The long continued and intemperate
interference of the Northern people with
the question of Slavery i.i the Southern
States lias at length produced its natural
effects. The different sections of the
Union arc now arrayed against each oth
er, and the time has arrived, so much
dreaded by the Father of his Country,
when hostile geographical parties have
been formed. I have long foreseen and
often forewarned my countrymen of the
now impending danger. This does not
proceed solely from the claims on the part
of Congress or the territoiial legislatures
to exclude Slavery from rise Territories,'
nor from the efforts of different States tc
defeat the execution of the Fugitive Slave
law.
" Ail or any of these evils might have
been endured by the South without dan
ger to the Union (as others have been,)
i.i the hope that tiiue and reflection might
apply the remedy. The immediate peril
arises not so much from these causes as
from the f ct that the incessant and vio
icnt agitation of the Slavery question
throughout the North for the last quarter
of a century, has at length produced its
malign influence on the slaves and in
spired them with vague notions of free
dom. Hence a sense of security no long
er exists around the family altar. This
feeling of peace at home has given place
to apprehensions of servile insurrection.
Many a matron throughout the South re
tires at night in dread of what may befall
herself and her children before the morn
ing. Should this apprehen ion of domes
tic danger, whether 'vai or imaginary,
extend and intensify its If until it shall
pervade the masses of the Southern peo
ple, then disunion will become inevitable.
Self-preservation is the liist law of nature,
'and h s been implanted in the heart of
man by h.s Creator for the wisest, pur
pose ; and no political union, however
fraught with blessings and benefits in all
oth r respects, can long continue, if the
necessary consequence be to render the
homes and firesides of nearly half the par
ties to it habitually and hopelessly inse
cure. Sooner or later the bonds of such
a Union mut be severed. It is my cou
\iction that this fatal period has not \ct
..riived; and uiy prayer to Gud is that lie
will preserve the Constitution and the
| Union throughout all generations."
Thus, shutting his eyes to the fact that,
during the last quarter of a century, there
has not oeen a day when the South and
the representatives of Democ r acy could
be induced to refrain from continued and
persistent agitation of the question —for-
getting, as ho does, that the South, led
on by that great, apostle of Democracy,
STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS, less than six
years since, " settled agitation " by the
repeal of the most solemn compact, (the
Constitution alone excepted,) which was
ever framed by the representatives of a
great people—forgetting all this—lie thus
throws all the responsibility of this whole
question in respect to the peiila of dis
union, upon the people of the Free States
—especially the Republicans.
Rut Mr. HUCUANAN tells us that there
is no difficulty whatever in the American
people settling, at once, and forever, the
Slavery question, and restoring peace and
harmony to a distracted country. To do
this he tells us that.
***** " All that is nec
essary to accomplish the object, and all
| tor which the Slave States have ever con
tended, is to be let alone, and permitted
to manage their domestic institutions
thei rown way. As sovereign States, thew
and they alone, arc responsible before Gud
and the world for the S a very existing
among them. For this, the people of the
North are not responsible, and have no
more right to interfere, than with similar
institutions in Russia or in Brazil. I pou
their good sen*e and patiiotie forbearance
I confess I still rely. Without their aid,
it is beyond the power of any President,
no matter what may be his own political
proclivities, t• restore peace and harmony
among ihe States. Wisely limited and
restrained as is his power, under our Con
stitution and laws, he alone can accom
plish cut little, for good or for evil, on
such a momentous question."
Mr. BUCHANAN does not however half
finish Is is Turssnge before he in effect gives
aflat contradiction to the two essential 1
~ , i
points in tins very programme ot " tma,
settlement." lie suggests the following. .
c I
as an explanatory ameudment of tho Con- •
■ stituticn:
1. "An express recognition of the
right of propeity in slaves in toe States
I where it now exists or may hereafter ex- •
i.-.- . '
, 2. "The duty of protecting this right
;in all the Ten i uries throughout their tor- (
ritoiiul existence, aud until they shili bo I
admitted as States into the Union, with
or without Slavery, as their constitutions
may prescribe."
3. "A like recognition of the right of \
. the master to have his slave, who has es- j I
enped from one State to another, restored
and "delivered up" to iiitn, and of the ;
validity ol the Fugitive Slave law enact- J
ed for this purpose, together with a dec f
duration that all State laws impairing or i
defeating this right a.o violations of the
•.i t i t
Constitution, aud are consequently null '
and void." t
This programme would utterly over- t
throw every vestige of the assumption ,
, {hat for the Slavery existing at the South, i
the North is no more responsible than for J
similar institutions in Russia, or Brazil, t
Who does not discover at a glance, that '
such a constimti jnal recognition ol prop- t
erty in Slaves as is here foreshadowed, ;
would at ono3 make slave-holding every- \
where legal beneath the shadows of Fed- ;
oral authority ? Who can fail to discov- <
cr that such a recognition of the rights '
of slave property, would at once bind the
uution to the protection of that kind of '
property, not only in every State aud Ter
ritory. but equally upon the High Seas?.'
But we turn away with loathing from
. . , 1
a further consideration of the points in t
this, Mr. BUCHANAN'S last Message.—
. . p
Next wec-k we will give a synopsis ot the s
Message—the document is entirely too '
long for our columns, and too uniutercst- .
. . ...
iug to merit its entire insertion. \\ e uiav. ■

relating to secession, in a week or two. 1

THE House of Ecpieseutatives showed
I the right temper yesterday. No time <
was wasted iti useless talk, but the real !
business of the country was begun in ]
earnest. Mr. f rime's Homestead bill ica* 11
pasxcil, and will go to the Senate, whence •
J: we tru,t it will promptly be laid before
Utile Old Public Functionary fur him to:'
t veto it, if lie dares. The bilL for the pay
ment of pensions and the support of West
" Point Academy were also passed. Now,
3 let the House take up and pass Mr. Mor- '
- rill's Tariff bill, and it wiil do more for I
5 the real pacification of the Republic than
can be done by a million new Fugitive
