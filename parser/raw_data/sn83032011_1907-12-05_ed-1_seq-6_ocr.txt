WashlnEtvn, rr 6. The first
se&doii of the Sixtieth Congrats
opened at uoou oil Monday and
there were plenty of Indications
that It will be lively from the start
If toe President decides against
another term this will be
tbe Inst session at which
be can hope 10 accomplish much In

he left to Mm only the short cou
sin;) of r. xt year, which will do
little besides punning tL.e neocnstiry
appropriation bills.
The measure of peneru tcRlsla
Uon which was recommended by the
President In the message Is very
larg-e. It vas more than sufficient
to keep Congress, busy beforo there
was any sIiik of the demand which
has grown out of the money famine
for legislative it-form of the bank

Conr'idi ring tlieo fcts the sten

Coming Just before the Presi
dential campalim pnlMics Is bound
'o cut a large r.ur.; In all that la
Jone. Ordinarily that makes for
deliberation but hi this eaRe It In
"lore likely to make for inaction.
That Is because no o-io Is anxious
to prolong the session. On tho
contrary everybody will want to i)t

sible, so an to got Into th.i polltlrol
game at home.
President Roosevelt s on the
threshold of one of the hardest
'Ights he eer had with Congress.
The reaction against him has set In
at last throughout the country, and
Congress knows it qulie as well an
he does. There will tot be thio
Winter quite the same unqno'Iflcd
enthusiasm over his legislative
schemes that marked the first sua
sion of tho Fifty-ninth Congress.
Eighty-nine Senators arc entitled
to take their seat, of whom four
teen are new to the chamber, and
two others came only at the end
of the last session. Seven of tho
fourteen are Republicans and sevou
Democrats. Among the raven He
publican aro three who succeed
k Democrats. When all tho places
are filled there will bo sixty-one Re
publicans and thirty-one Demo
crats. No business woe transacted by
either House on Monday beyond the
routine of organisation. The ses
sion of tho Senate waa very brief,
adjournment being taket- as soon as
the new members were sworn In,
because of the death of Senators
Morgan and Pettus In the recess.
. . In the House the session was en
livened by tho speech of John
Hharpe Williams protesting against
the adoption of the rules, and by
the drawing of seatu. The election
of five members from Oklahoma
makes the membership of tho House
uow 391, of whom 224 are Republi

Republicaiid a majority of 57.
Congress Renins Work.
Washington, Dec. 4. There was
uothlng unusual or remarkable In
the seenes which marked the open
ing of the Sixtieth Congress durlns
the afternoon, except that the en
thusiasm In the House of Repre
sentatives was more boisterous, if
anything, than on previous similar
occasions. William J. liryan, who;e
visit here is supposed to bo for con
sultation with Democratic Congress
men as to a legislative pol'ey ior
the Congress se.-mion. in which pol
itics will play ar. important part,
appeared on the floor of the Houks
at the opportune moment and gave
the members of his party and gal
leries r chance to show their affec
tion for the "Peerless Leader." The
Senate session was brief but tho
House sat until after 4 o'clock.
. When (Senator Joseph Benson
Foraker, tho latost entry In race for
the Republican Presidential nomi
nation, walked into the Bonate
chamber a few minutes before tho
hour for convening he was mark
ad In minute by the curious throng
la the galleries. "That's Foraker,"
the whisper went around.
Messrs. Williams and De Armond
protested against the rules on the
ground trt.at they vested In the
Speaker more power than any one
man In a government, republican In
term and democratic in spirit should
possess; that It resulted In making
him practically the whole House.
It took a yea and a nay vote to
adopt the rules, 17 to 160.

Rellevernon, Penn., Dec. 4. 'Ihn
greatest mino disaster In the history
of the Mononpaheln Valley was that
of Sunday night, when the Naomi
coal mine, about four miles from

that forty-seven miners have per
ished. There Is no longer hope of
rescue os there cannot be life In the

Eleven were counted but will not
be brought to tho surface until

Washington, Dec. 5. Viscount
Aokl, the Japanettei Ambassador,
has been summoned to Toklo by
cable for the purpose, It was an
nounced at tho embassy, of making
a full report to his Government on
the result of his work In this coun
try. It was explained that such re
ports as he has been able to make
by letter and telegram have been
perforce not so full as he win be
able to make by word of mouth. It
was denied that there Is anything
In the recall to Indicate that It w'll
be permanent, although In other
quarters there Is no expectation that
ho will return.
It was stated explicitly at the
embassy that Ambassador Aokl was
not going home because of any
strain In the relations between the
two countries which, it was declared,
were as cordial and harmonious as
ever.
The principal matters upon which
Viscount Aokl will report to his
Government are the Immigration of
Japanese into this country, with the
attitude of labor organizations here
toward it, and tho difficulty which
the Jpanese Have experienced '.n
handling the questions affecting
their Interests which arose In Indi
vidual States.
