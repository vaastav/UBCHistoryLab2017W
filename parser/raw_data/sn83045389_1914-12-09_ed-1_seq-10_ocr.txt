Brokers are merchants, and their profits
depend upon the rapid turnover of other
people's holdings. For nineteen weeks they
have practically been without means of J
livelihood, and their capital In somo cases i
has been endangered In financing the com- |
niitments of their clients. They are. there- |
fore, unusually keen to resume business and l
encourage trading In stocks, for the bond j
business !s but a small portion of the day's :
work for the members of the Stock Ex- |
change. Commissions on stock and specula- I
tlve operations provide the bread and butter
of the commission houses.
Bonds were quiet to-day. Rock Island is- |
sues were active and strong on buying, at- J
trlbut"d to the copper Interests, which con- i
trol tne property. The recent advance In i
these securities will, it Is believed, bo fol- j
lowed by an active speculation In the shares i
of the Hock Island Company. A lively do- i
mnnd was noted to-day. the common oliang- |
ing hands at 1*4 and the preferreil was
strongly bid at 2.
KOC'K ISLAND WIL.I.
St'KVIV E ITS PUNISHMENT
Speaking of the Rock Island property,
the head of a commission house, who lias
had a practical experience In railroading,
said:
"I believe the Rock Island is- one of tho '
best located roads In the country. It wjll
survive Its punishment. I lived In tho West
for many years, and was prominently active
In railroad management. Union Pacific, and
Northern Pacific survived under clrcum
stnnces In which the country could not so
rapidly recuperate, and I further believe wo
have passed the low period of this depres
sion. It is easily conceivable 'that Rock
Island stocks at current prices will prove
an attractive speculative proposition."
In the outside market notes were firm at
the best prices yet established. Trading
was quieter, with a disposition to watch
the effect of renewal of stock market op
erations.
Copper exports from New York for the
week ending November H were 12,400,000
pounds, the custom-house reported. It is
believed In the trade that the business ex
ceeded these figures. Heavy buying orders
have been In the hands of exporters, al
though every effort Is being made to hide
this business. The activity of foreign agents
in soliciting offers points to a continua
tion of heavy shipments. Domestic man
ufacturers are known to have taken on large
amounts of the metal below 12 cents and. as
many of the big producers have sold their
production for months ahead, higher prices
are anticipated.
The administration evidently Is not going
to kick the prostrato form of business."
was Wall Street'^ Interpretation of President
Wilson's message.
NEW YORK. December S.?Sentiment In
financial circles was heartened to-day by
the decision of the Stock Exchange to re
sume restricted trading in slocks on Sat
urday. This feeling was accentuated by tho
firmer tendency shown by nearly nil classes
of securities. The day's list of stocks sub
mitted for publication showed several ad
ditions to that Issued yesterday, indicating
steady extension of tho demand.
While no apprehension was entertained re
specting the wisdom of the move made by
the exchange, it may be said that every pre
caution to Inspire this success will bo taken.
The fact that It has not been deemed nec
essary to form n money pool to he used as
a backstop against heavy liquidation was
regarded as an Indication that offerings
would find ready absorption. Another safe
guard will be found in the level of prices at
which all stocks over $11 may bo sold.
Further demand for exchange on Berlin
was the solid feature of the market for for
eign remittance, cables to that-centro being
quoted at, 92<>t. with sight drafts at 92.
Private advices from Washington suggest
ed un early decision by tho lnterstnte Com
merce Commission In the Eastern freight
rate caie. ?
Continued ease mark? the local money
situation, call and time loans being made
lit the prevailing low rates. Interior hanks
bought -nore freely of mercantile paper,
these acceptances coinciding with encourag
ing trade advices.
Unofficial news respecting the steel indus
try suggested a better inquiry for special
products, with a continuance of the dead
lock for equipment materials. November

tion. to be published on Thursday, was ex
pected to disclose another decrease In un

COTTON MARKETS
NEW YORK. December 8.?Publication ot
the census cotton ginning figures was fol
lowed by more discussion as to the probable
size of the crop than noted In cotton cir
cles here previously this season. It failed
to stimulate business, and the market was
\ery quiet, with the close steady, net un
changed to two points higher. The opening
was steady at unchanged prices to an ad
vnnci of t\? o points, and at first sight the
census report Indicating 13.006.100 bales ginned
to December 1. or the largest amount on
record, appeared to Inspire some scattered
selling. The market eased off three or four
points right after the call under small local
offerings, with active positions selling two
or three points below last night's closing
?Igures. Prices soon steadied, however, sell
'ng some three to four points net hlglior
luring the afternoon on covering and a
Ittle trade buying.
Notwithstanding the large amount of cot
ton ginned for the Benson to December 1. the
returns for the last period In November
showed a very sharp falling off. as compared

mate of the crop, generally regarded as the
most important bureau report of the season.
Throughout the session offerings were In
small volume. In tho early part of the day
Liverpool was said to bo selling here. Hedge
