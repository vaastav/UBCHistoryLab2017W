President GrautV Annual Message to Con

President, in opening, refers to th« year past
one of general peace and. proHperity. lie
tions the. re-admission of Virginia, Mississippi,
and Texas to repr osent atton in Congre««, the
in Europe, the Cuban Rebellion, the pro
posed establishment of a tribunal to deci le
claims against the Hpauirtli government for
American property seizod by its veuBels of
and our relation« with th? Bouth Amoiloau
Republics.
The propriety of annexing Ban Domingo is
referred to at length, and the President earnest
ly urge« the measure upon the attention of
Congress, giving his reasons therefor.
No progress lias been made in the settlement
of the Alabama Claims, but the message recom
mends Congress to authorize the appointment
of a Commission to hear and decide upon
these claim«, so tint they may bo paid by the
United .States, and thus become a claim of the
nation against Groat Britain.
The course of the Dominion Government

»gainst the American fishermen, in their waters,
it is been arhitr try and unfriendly.
11 regard to our commerce, he say« :
. I would recommeud a liberal policy toward a
lino of American steamers,one that will injure its
success and give increased usefulness. The cost
of building iron vessels, the only
compute with foreign Bitips in tho carrying trade,
is so much greater in the United States than in
foreign countries, that without
from tho government they cannot bo successful
ly built here. There will be sevetal propositions
laid before Congress in the course of the present
session looking to a remedy for this evil, even if
it should bo at
ury. I hope such encouragement will be given
will secure American shipping on the high
seas and American shipbuilding at home.
The average premium on gold in 1869 was 34
per cent ; fur this year it is about 15. While tho
premium Iirh thus declined, it is now very desir
able to take such measures as will return to a
specie basis.
Iu relation to " Ravenna Reform,'' the Presi
dent says !
The tax collected front the people has been
reduced more than eighty millions of dollars per
annum. By steadiness in onr present course,
there is no reason why, in a few short years, the
national tax-gatherer may not disappear from
the door of the citizen almost entirely. With
the revenue stamps disbursed by postmasters iu
every community, a tax upon liquor« of all sorts
ami tobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjust
ment of the tariff, which will put a duty only
upon those articles which we could dispense witli
known as luxuries, and on those which w
more than we produce, revenue enough may be
raised, after four years of peace and consequent
reduction of indebtedness, to failli all our obli
gations. A further reduction of expenses, in
addition to a reduction of interest account,
be relied on to make this practicable.
Revenue reform, if it moans this, has
hearty support. If it implies a collection of ail
the revenue for tho support of the Government,
for the payment of principal and interest of tho
public debt, pensions, Ac., by directly taxing tlio
people, then I am against revenue reform, and
confidently believe the people are with mo. If
it means failure to provide the necessary means
to defray all tho expense« of tho Government,
and thereby repudiation of the publie debt ami
finance«, them I am still more opposed to such
kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform lias
not been defined by any of its advocates to my
knowledge, but seems to be accepted as some
thing which is to supply every man's want« with
• effort on his part. A true reve
nue reform cannot he made iu a day, but

IWiE STRONG
Judge Strong has rendered his decision in the
«*r Minot rs the Philadelphia Wilmington »V
Baltimore Railroad Company recently argued in
tho Circuit Court of the U. S. in the'District of
Delaware.
This action
brought by Mr. Minot, a
strick holder in the above named Company, ami a
citizen of MusHæhiisotlH, to have the State of
Delaware enjoined front levying certain taxes
the I*.. W. and B. Railroad Company, and the
railroad company front paying them.
The Court decides that the tax on tho capital
stock of this Company, and 011 net earnings is
constitutional ; but the tax 011 locomotives, pas
•-eftis, and other rolling stock, is uncon
stitutional. Judge Ht l ong conclude« as follows:
" Tlie case, in any view of it, decides that a
ate cannot directly or indirectly tax person«
■ pushing through or out of it. That is enough
• the ease I have before me. The Delaware
statute of April s. lHii'.l, doe« directly levy a tax
both persons and property for transit
through tlie State, into it and out of it. It is.
y opinion, so far in conflict with
he Constitution of tlie United States.
" I shall therefore enjoin against any steps for
«essuient, collection, or payment of tho
tax prescribed by tlie twenty first section of tho
■t of April sth, 1869, namely, tho tax for the
of locomotives, passenger ear», freight cars,

prayed for to prevent the collection and pay
