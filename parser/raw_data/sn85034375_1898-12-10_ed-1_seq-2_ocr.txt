Digest of the Annual Message
President McKinley to the Con*
greos of the United States.
LAE6ELY A REVIEW OF THE RECENT WAR.
The President Hu Only Words of Prelee
for Those Who Brought the Wur to
HueoeMfal Conclusion, end Looki For
ward CouHentljr to the ^onclnclou of
Uouuruble Treaty of Peeee with Spain*
Washington, Dec. 5.—President Mc
Kinley's second annual message, sub
mitted to congress, contains, about 20,
000 words. Following is a brief synop
sis including some direct excerpts
the more important features of th;
message:
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESEN ATI VEJ8: Notwithstanding
the adde burdens rendered necessary by
the war, our people rejoice in a very sat
isfactory and steadily-increasing degree
of prosperity evidenced by . the largest
volume of business ever recorded. Manu
factures have been productive, agricul
tural pursuits have yiemed abundant re
turns, labor in all fields of inuustry is
better rewarded, revenue legislation
passed by the present congress has in
creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by Its authors; the
finances of the government have been suc
cessfully administered and its credit ad
vanced to the first rank; while its cur
rency has been maintained at the world's
highest standard. Militury service under
a common flag and Cor a righteous cause
has strengthened the national spirit, and
served to cement more closely than ever
.the fraternal bonds, between every sec
tion of the country.
CONTROVERSY WITH 8PAIN
VIEWED.
In reviewing the controversy which led
up to the war with Spain, the president
takqs up the thread or narrative where
it terminated in his last annual mes
sage. He concluded: "It was honestly
due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations of re
l'orn\ to which she had become irrevoca
bly committed."
It became evident, however, that the
proposed plans were barren of good re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
reconcentrados, among whom the rate
of mortality frightfully Increased; the
pi offered expedient of zones of cultiva
tion proved illusory, and it was apparent
that nothing save the physical exhaus
tion of Spain or the Cubans and the prac
tical ruin of the island of Cuba could re
sult from the struggle then in' progress.
DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINE.
At this critical juncture the destruc
tion of the battleship "•Maine" occurred.
Concerning it the president says:
"It is a striking evidence of the poise
and sturdy good sense u.stinguUhlhg our
national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched oy preceding evenfj
in Cuba, did not move them to an in
stant, desperate, resolve to tolerate no
longer the existence of a condition ol
danger and disorder at our doors that
made possible such a deed, by whomso
ever wrought."
Resuming the war narrative* the presi
dent directs attention to the measures,
including the $50,000,000 appropriation for
national defense, taken to plac* the
country on a war footing, and adds: "It
sufficient to say that the outbreak of
war, when it did cone, found our nation
not unprepared to meet the conflict."
APPREHENSION BY EUROPEAN
^POWERS.
Reference Is made to the apprehension
coming strife by the continental puw
era, voiced In the address to the presi
dent through their ambassadors and en
voys. and to the president's reply thereto.
Still animated, however, bv the hope of
peaceful solution of the difficulty, and
obeying the dictates of duty, toe presi
dent relaxed no effort to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne
gotiations with the Madrid government
proved futile, so far as practical results
were concerned, and then it was the
president presented the question to con
gress, saying; "In the name of humanity,
'he name of 'civilization, in behalf of
endangered American Interests, which
give us the right and duty to speak and
act. the war In Cuba must ston,"
THE DECLARATION OF CONGRESS.
The result of this statement of the case
was tne adoption of the memorable joint
resolution by congress, declaring the pur
pose of the United States to Intervene
between the Spaniards and Cuban. Fol
lowing swiftly upon the enactment of the
resolution, came the severance of diplo
matic relations between the two coun
tries, the proclamation of a blockade of
Cuban ports, the call for volunteers, and
the formal declaration of the existence
a state of war. All other governments
were Immediately notified of the exist
ence of war and each proclaimed neu
trality. "It Is not among the least grati
fying incidents of the struggle that the
obligations of neutrality were Impartially
disoharged by all, often under delicate
and difficult circumstances."
THE PREPARATION FOR WAR.
The president reviews at length the
work of preparation for war, referring
particularly to the enlistment of the vol
unteers, to the material Increase of the
navy In both men and ships, and to the
precautionary measures taken for the
protection of the seaboard coast and
cities. "The aggregate number of mine*
placed was l,53o, at the principal harbors
from Maine to California."
RE
g to "the difficult and hn
portant character" of the work ner
formed by the signal corps the president
says: "This service was Invaluable to the
executive In directing the operations of
army and navy. With a total force
over 1,300, the loss was by disease, In
camp and field, officers and men Included.

PRAISE FOR OUR SHIPBUILDERS.
In this connection the president
"Nor-can we-be unmindful of the achieve
ments of our builders, mechanics and
tisans for their part in the construction
of our warships.
TEAR8 FOR THE DEAD.
A* to the success gained by the
of the United States In Cuba, the
dent says that the earnest and lasting
gratitude of the nation Is unsparingly
due. "Nor should we alone remember
the gallantry of the living, the dead
our tears, and our losses by battle,
disease must cloud any exultation
result, and teach us the awful cost,of
however, rightful the cause or signal

CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR.
"The total casualties In killed

with Spain were: Officers killed, 23;
listed men killed, 257; total, 280; officers

"It will be observed that while our

50,000 of our troops were transported
distant lands, and were engaged In
sault and siege and buttle and manv

lost in both arms of the service a total

campaign by land and sea we did not

and with the exception of the crew of
"Morrlmac" not a soldier or sailor

TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO COULD
NOT GO.
The president bears testimony and pays
fitting tribute "to the patriotism and
votion of that large portion of our army
which, although eager to be ordered
the post of greatest exposure, fortunate
ly were not reciuired outside of tho United
States." They did their whole duty
earned the gratitude of the nation.
president then says: "In tracing these
events we are constantly reminded of
obligations to the Divine Master for
watchful care over us, and His safe
guidance, for which the nation makes
reverent acknowledgment, and offers
humble prayer for the continuance of
favors."

THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
The peace negotiations, which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago,
and the preparation and signing of
protocol, are discussed at length. Refer
ring to the work of the peace commis
sioners at Paris, the president says:
"These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be able
to lay a definite treaty before the senate,
with a review of the steps leading to

venge nor passion should have a place in

FRIENDLY WITH ALL THE REST OF
THE WORLD.
The president says that with one ex
ception of tlie rupture with Spain, the
intercourse of the United States with
the great family of nations during the
past year has been marked with cordiali
ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar
gentine government, initiated with a view
lo retnot ing differences In cable rate
charges Imposed upon messages pussing
from and to the United States, the presi
dent expresses his sincere hope for an In
ternational agreement whereby Inter
change of messages over connecting lines
may-be regulated on a fair basis of uni
formity, and adds: "It would be strange
were the nations not In time brought to
