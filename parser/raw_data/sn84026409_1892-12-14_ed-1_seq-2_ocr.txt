NurYost&n: The general feelin?
toward PrwiJent Harrison in these last
months of his term of oSiee. is one of
heart respect and g'od will. There is
nothing in his nieaeaje which will dimin

that the stamps will gJ on sale January 1

demagoguery that it strikes us that the

A Btt.i. has been presented to Congr&s
by Representative lleltzhoover, of Pa
to restrict immigration and is regarded
in tho ilono as pooocaoinc ftotc
w hich make it preferable to any othr
measure on the subject. Among other
things it requires that the immigrant
shall sw ear before the consul of the port
! departure that he intends to rema n
rmanently in the country and beeon e
a citizen of the United Stales. This
intended to prevent the ehipmenls cf
j'oles, Hungarians, Italians and other
labor whii h comes in competition with
American labor by importation with the
sole intention of securing cheap labor,
they returning to their native country
carrying their earnings with them.
The men who managed ( leveland s
campaign committee are endeavoring to
secure the organization of the United
States Senate after March 4 next. Tbat
is the meaning of tbe Iemoontic Senate
caucus held ia New York, Saturday, at
which a strong committee, with Gorman
at the head, w as appointed to look after
the Legislatures in the doubtful Slates
w hich are to elect United States Senators
tips winter. Some of them are the men
wba, doubtless for a consideration, in
duced the Populists and Pemocrats to
combine cn the elrctoral ticket in the
very States in which they now purpose
t attempt to fup;-res the Republican
sentiment in the legislature, and to see
in it that Popu'.i'U shall unite wilh Dem
ocrats in these States to el -ct a Demo
cratic Senator, in order that the lemo
cratsmay control tbs United Sla'.ea Sen
ate. The ine.'liciency of the Democratic ad
ministration of the House was illustrated
in a singular manner Wednesday. It ap
pears that the Democrats adopted a rule
last session that no unfinished bns'nis
of one session should be considered al
the next until af;er the lapse of six darg.
Kilgore, of Tex.i, who has azaia j
nonnce 1 that n? pension bills shall W
passed this sasiion except by a qtiarttm
aad a mj tity, discovered the rule, and
demanded itaenJorcement. The S.ieak
cr ov-.ld not refus? to enforce it. Conse
quently, no unfinished business could be
traimrtedandawetk w as lost. This is
an illustration of Democratic quack econ
omy. In anicipation of trouble with
Mine of the conservatives when the at
tempt at tariff legislation is made in the
l-'ifly-thir 1 Congress, there is considera
ble talk of he necessity of having rales
which will not admit of filibustering. It
is urged that it w ill not do as an excuse
for not doing what they promised "the
people" to s y that a lew men of their
own party blocked the way and made
the majority helpless. The Democrats
themselves confess that they must devise
some more effective means of dealing
with a filibuster, and the Republicans
are predicting that they will be driven
to tie adoption of the Reel rules.
SitAKEa Cuisr, thechief represents' ive
cf Lis party and the third highest officer
in the Government, was openly insulted
at the banquet tendered President-elect
Cleveland by the Ileform Club of New
York, Saturdav night. Mr. Crisp ac
cepted an invitation to the banquet, pre
pared his speech and furnished copies of
w het he intended to say to the newspa
pers before be went to the feast. But
Speaker Crip w not called upon to de
liver speech, notwithstanding loud and
repeated calls were made for him by the
merry banqueters. He was totally ig
nored by the members of the Club whose
guest be was, and his conduct aa presid
ing officer of the Fifty-aecond Congrera
w as severely criticised by other speakers,
without bis being permitted to reply. It
looks very mnch as though the Speaker '
had been dragged to New York for the
ex prea purpose of being insulted by the
free trade friends of Mr. Cleveland. i
Soke of the moM-backed Democrats
bare ln in conference ith represen
tatives i-pringer and Tucker on the sub
ject ol the repeal of the Electoral College
provifiin or the Con-tUution of the Uni
tM States and the substitution of an
amendmen- to elect the President and
V:ce President by a direct vote of the
people. There is not the most remote
probability that this scheme to place tke
sole power of electing these high ffijera
in the people of Texas and a few other
States of the South, w here their majori
ties are as much as the election officers
choose to make the, w ill be adopted.
Under this system, if w were adopted,
with Texas giving a majority of 750,000,
Georgia, Kentucky, South Car dina and
other Southern States rolling cp on the
returns about a hundred thousand apiece
would overcome the fair majorities of the
entire of Northern States from Maine
to California. Kentucky, a State which
produces scarcely anything of economic
value to mankind, would give more ma
jority than the whole New England
States with all their immense resources
and useful productive industries.
Oa the face of this scheme it looks quite
plaaiibie, bat when it is analysed it is a
proposition to wipe out of politi-ail exist
ence all of the States, great or small, with
narrow majorities. It is sale to say inai
the popular method of electing a Presi
dent and Vice President will not be sub
stituted for the electoral college, at any
rate as long as the present infamous elec
toral conditions exist in the South.

not become available until June and its effect
will not appear in this repjrt. lis indirect
ef ect, however. Las manifested itself in
muc'i-needed improvements at the cost of
the district. More teachers have been intro
duced, the term has been lengthened, salaries
have been raised and school bui! jinps have
been mad worthy of the cause. Ia l!,4Sl
schools tbe textbooks were supplied free of
cost while other boards have adopted the
policy of supplying part of the books annu
ally, with a view to a general intrJu:tion.
Dr. Walljr favor3 a single term of 8 months,

O. Harvey, who, together with F. 1. Higby,
of Chicago, has selected Miss Utbmaa as tbe
model for lbs siivar statue of Justice which
is to b tbe one great exhihit of Montana at

months ago, hut a storm of protetu arose
from Montana citisens, who claimed thy
could furnish a fair model in the person of
Misa Dora Hsnser, of Helena.
The statue will cost $iK',. and will rest
upon a pedestal of solid gold worth $2 jO,CC0.
Messrs. Harvey aud Higby conceived tbe

A Strange Bequest.
Mi5ekva, O., Dec. 11. J. C. Marshall of
this piace, tein in failing health, makes
public Lis wiil in order that the principal
beneficiary uccer its provision may be dis
covered. In inroory of his dead wife he
bequeaths real estate worth $12,000 to Mi.'s
Deila S;jiraan, a lady whom he never
kner, but w ho?e name appeared among
those registered as delegates to the state con
vention of societies of Christian Fndoavor
heid at Kat Liverpool la3t year. He doe
this because her name U the same as that of
hia deisrted wife btfore their marriage.
At tba death of Miss Speakrnan, tiroviiiing
she can be found, the legacy is to go to her
husband or next of kin. In conclusion the
will says: "Phis I pi veto an unknown
friend with the LijetLot the will je?ict
ar.a honor the r.anie of mi on'v f&r-.hlr
l. iend."' Mr. Marshall is a prominent citi
zen of this MCtion.
Republican Senators Likely.
Dispatches from California, Montana and
Wyoming claim that the Republicans will
elect Senators in all three states. Senator
PaJdot k"s election in Xebra-ka is said to be
ail but certain and the election of a Repub
lican m Kai.fis seems prohabie. The Re
publicans are not anxious to organize the
Senate, pre ft rring, aa Senator Haie said the
other ilay, tbat the Democrats should Lave
the full power and responsibility, hnt thev
are becoming cocvinoed that the Democrats
will not have sufficient strength in the Sen
ate, and th-y are planning accordingly.
Destitution in Homwstead.
About seventy -five cases of destitution re
sulting from the great strike at Homtsteal
have been reported to tbe relief committee

the number largely increased. The merch

on their books and they say tbat they will
hare to lira w the line sometime, and it is
only a question of time how soon they will
tell these peopie they can no longer carry
them nrwa their bocks. Then will ih.
satfering actually begin, and it will certainly
require outside assistance lo help tide
these people orer until they get work. Con
tribution are coming in, but not as fast as
the relief oomniiUoe would like to see them.
It has been decided not to issue a call for
aid for a few days at last.

Tbe Presidents Message.
Eroru the New York Mail Mid Eijireas
Those who anticipated a dole
ful wail foom the Freeidnt will be dis-
- . i - -: 4 1 . . t
sppoiciea. mere is nui a uw
catrs defeat ; not a word that oenove
eurren-'er. The power of President Har
rison in bis public utterance i marvel
ous. 11 u metftsge ;s concise, cuuij'i cucu-
sive, terse and trenchant.
It opens with the declaration of nis
BatL'faction in being able to say that the
country is favored by tbe greatest pros
perity ever recorded in its Ivistory. Com
menting on the census returns from sev
enty-five leading cities, be shows that
during the decade from 1SS0 to 1S1K) tbe
capital employed increased $1,5.12,000 the
value cf products over f.'.OOO.OOO, tbe
wsgs earned nearly 'J7J,000.100 and the
ramber cf wage-earners employed over
SoC.OOO, with an increase of wage earn
ings per capita from f 3S5 in 1SS0 to $o47
in 1S'.0.
The beat defense of tbe McKinley tariff
is its results, and the President gives a
fow decisive figures showing what these
results have been. The industrial plants
established, the development of new in
dustries, an admitted increase in the
number of employes and in the ratea of
wages, remarkable expansion of our
foreign trade, the development of our
coastwise freight service, and an extra
ordinary increase in savings banks de
posits are marshaled as solid facts on the
side of the McKinley tariff and the pro
tective policy. V. bile agriculture has
been depressed, the general average of
pric es was such aa to give ag iculturea
fair proportion of the general prosperity.
The President says:
"If any are discontented with their
state here; if any believe that wages or
prices, tbe returns for honest toil, are in
adequate, they should not fail to remem
ber that there is no country in the world
where the conditions that seem to them
bard would not be accepted as highly
prosperous. The Enjliah agriculturist
would be glad to exchange the returns of
Lis labor for those of the A meriean farm
er, and the Manchester workmen their
w ages for those of their fellows at Fall
River."
President Harrison believes protection
is a mighty instrument for the develop
ment of our national wealth and a most
powerful agency in prelecting tbe homes
of our workiegmen from the invasion of
want. He speaks with burning words
and declares that the result of the elec
tion must be accepted as an indication of
a new policy, and we must assume that
the present protective tanffmust be sup
planted by one constructed solely with
reference to revenue : "That no duty is
to be higher becanaa the increase will
keep open an American mill or keep up
ths wages of an American workman, but
that in every case each a rate of duty is
to be imposed as will bring to the Treas
ury of the United States the largest re
turns of revenue."
The message adds that it would be
offensive to suggest that the prevailing
party will not carry into legislation the
principle advocated by it and the pledges
given to the people. President Harrison
recommends thai the whole subject of
tariff revision be left to the incoming
Congress, and says: "If a system of
duties can be formed that will set the idle
wheels of European manufacturers in
motion and crowd our warehouses with
foreign-made goods, and at the same time
keep our own mills busy and enable the
American manufacturer to pay his Ainer
ican workingmen from 50 to 100 per cent
more in wages than is paid abroad ; that
w ill reduce the cost cf raiment and food
without reducing wajes, the authors and
promoters of that policy will be entitled
to the highest praise." The present gen
eration must obviously have its expe
rience for itself.
The first pages of the message, devot
ed to the consideration of the tariff ques
tions, are in the President's best style.
The lo-jic is impressive, the facts are un
deniable and the conclusion in defense
of protection is irresistible. The remaind
er of the document is largely devoted to
a resume of the work of the Administra
tion, and the transactions of the past
fiscal year as reported by the several de
partments. Foreign relations are treated
with the customary care.
The President savs that the full bene
fit of the reciprocal arrangements cannot
be realized immediately, but he expects
that within a short time it Will secure
fully one-third of the total trade of Cen
tral and South America for us which
amounts to about $000,000,000 annually.
In 1SS5 we had only 8 per cent, of this
trade.
Figures are given revealing the aston
ishing increase in the value of our domes
tic exports under the reciprocity agree
ments with foreign countries. Consider
able space is devoted to our relations
with the Caadian Dominion, and the
President alludes caustically to the un
reasonable and unfriendly objections
from Canada continuously interposed in
our negotiations with Great Britain. The
unfair rivalry to which tbe Canadian
Pacific Railroad subjects competing rail-
roa Is of the United States is commented
npon, and the message declares that it is
t;me to consider w hetherour interchange
upon lines of land transportation should
not be put upon a different basis by the
construction of an American canal around
the Falls of Niagara and the opening of
ship communication between the great
lakes and one of oar own seaports.
The President then repeats bis recom
mendation of prompt and adequate sup-
isrt of the Nicaragua Ship Canal enter
prise. Ia reference to the international
si.ver conference, now in session, he says
mat very 6O0n commercial conditions
will compel the relu.-tant governments to
unite with us in this movement to secure
the enlargement of the.volume of coined
money needed for tbe transaction of the
business of the world.
One of the nost interesting parts of the
rnefa reiers to thecondition of nation
al finances. The misleading etatemenU
concerning the public icvenue are met
with three decisive facts: First, that the
pnplic.debt.has been reduced since Mar.
4, 1SS3, over $oo),000,0ro and the annual
interest chargcslover $11,CS4,000. Second,
that the per sion pay menu during this
administration up to November 1, 1891,
agg-egated ?432,.)O4,000, m against $m,-
40(.,(H!0 from March, 1S8-5, to rarcb,lSS9.
Third, that tinder the existing tariff up
to the tirst of this month, about $03,000,
000 of revenue, principally on sugar,
which would have been received if the
duty had been levied, has gone into the
pockets of the people. The jeculiar
method ia which the Cleveland admin
istration loaned the surplus public money
to favored bankers is recalled by tbe
comment in tbe President's message :
"If there are any who still think tbat the
surplus should have been kept out of circu
lation by hoarding it in the Tnasury, or de
positing it in favored banks without inter
est, while the government continued lo psy
to Ibese very backs interest npon tbe bonds
deposited as security for tbe depobits, or
who think that the extended pension leaia-
lation was a public robbery, or that the du
ties upon scjar ebculd Lav been maintain
ed, I am content (o leave the arzument
where it now reit, while we wait to see
whither these criticisms will take tbe form
of legislation. "
It is encouraging to note tl at there
will be an estimated cash balance in the
Highest of all in Leavening Power.
Y c '
ABSGHJTELY PURE
Treasury at the end of the fiscal yearof
nearly. ?21,CM),000, instead of the deficit
that has been predicted. The President
suggests tba! the "retirement of bonds ia
the future before maturity ehoul J be a
matter of convenience and not of com
pulsion." The surprising revelation is
made that war claims now pending ag
gregate $100,000,001.
The increase in 'postal revenue and in
postal business is accepted as an evidence
of general prosperity, and the gratifying
fact is announced that during the next
fiscal year the Poet Oibce Department
should show a surplus of nearly $1,000,
000. A patriotic and vigorous appeal for
the maintenance and extension of the
American merchant marine is one of the
significant parts of the message. The
Preeident compliments the Navy Depart
ment on the progress of tbe work of con
structing the new navy. Although there
has been expended during this adminis
tration for the increase of the navy more
than $ij,000,000, beside $$,000,000 for
labor at our navy yards, tbe message says
there was not the smallest scandal or
charge of fraud or partiality. This is a
high compliment to Secretary Tracy.
In reference to the work of the Indian
Bureau, the President calls attention to
the Urge increase in the attendance of
school children, over 13. per cent., and to
the adoption of a uniform eys'em of
school text books on the basis of our co n
mon schools of the State. Judging by the
aggregate work of the Pension Depart
ment, the greatest in the history of the
office, the President feels that the office
has been efficiently organized and the
work efficiently performed. The Com
missioner estimates tbat the maximum
expenditure for pensions will be reached
Jane .TO, 18!4, and will be $l?3,O00,OO0.
President Harrison, despite the clamor of
the Democratic papers in their attack on
the pension system, patriotically defends
the right of disabled veterans to the grat
itude of the nation.
The development of our exports of cat
tle and hog products, largely through the
efforts of Secretary Rusk, of the Agricul
tural Department, is commented cpon
President Harrison favors national con
trol of quarantine wita adequate power
lod,jed in the Executive to protect our
people against plague invasion. He also
favors restriction of immigration.
The moiMage closes with a patriotic ap
peal for pure eletion an earnest refer
ence to the deplorable violence exerci.ied
against the colored people of the South,
and with the declaration "that there are
no new frontiers to our possible develop
ment. Retrogression would be a crime."

Si i years ago Joeie Mallison met a man
named Hobbs and went to live with him.
Soon she married a man named Smith, but
continued her relations with Hobba. Then
Hobbs thought he would marry ; b-rt when
he told her of bis intention, she said that if
be did she would kill him. He married and
she killed him. She was tried on Friday in
Philadelphia and convicted of murder in
the second degree, and as she came out of
the court room tae women, as the report
informs us, "crowded around ber and kiss
ed her 1"
At Crow creek canon. Oregon, fifty miles
from the California line, one of two girls.
who were walking past a trestle in the com
pany of a younz man with a lantern on
Thursday night, discovered that the South
era Pacific tracks had been partly torn from
tbe trestle, 8he grasped tbe lantern, ran
back up the road and swung the light vig
orously, not a moment too soon to check
and save a passenger train of eight coaches
which contained 2o0 passengers. Tbe tracks
had been torn up by bandits, who hoped to
rob the train.
Nothing for Charity.
Au abstract of the will of Jay Gould has
been fuanished to tbe press, although tbe
will has not yet been probated. The will
was dated Dec. 24, l&so, and several codicils
have been added since. All of bis immense
proerty remains in the family, not a single
penny being given to any charitable or
benevolent institution. Hia brothers and
sisters are each given a bequest of $25,000,
with an annunity of $2,000 each year during
their Uvea. Tbe rest of the property ia di
vided equally between bis six children, ex
cept that his favorite son, George J. Gould,
is given $o,G00,ttQ0 extra for past services,
and his grandson and namesake, Jay Gould.
Gaorge's son, is given $500,000.
There is no further distinction between
any of tbechildren except that each of hia
children who are of age are given a house
and certain furniture and pictures and his
daughter Helen is given $6,000 a month un
til the younger children become of age, the
expectation being that they will make their
home with ber. A provisioa is ma le that
tbe estate of his daughters is to be free from
any control of their husiianda. The childn n
who are of age are made executors and are
not required lo give bond.
Tte disposition of his vast estate is in
keeping with his life, as he was never
known to give anything to charity. As his
daughter Helen is known to be very char
itably di.-p At J, aad as all the children have
more of human sympathy than their father,
it f believed that much of these vast pos
sessions, which they cannot possibly apply
to their own comfort, will yet be distributed
in a spirit of generosity and philanthropy
Tbe estate ia estimated to be worth 0,000,-
000.
