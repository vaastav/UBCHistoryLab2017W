they are really the same in substance,

I refused it twice; but owing to the
fair promises made and reiterated to

years, when their State counsel, as a
general rule, were discharged in two

As soon

condition, this soultess corporation at
the instance of its Vice-President,
cooly turned me out to perish, as it
thought, but was careful enough to say
that no charges were made against
me. It thought I was about dead and
treated me as it would a dead horse or
a dead dog threw me aside by abolish

God, my health has almost been restor

.I. II. Conner, a banker and merchant
of Aurora, P.eaufort county, wa9 way
laid, murdered and robbed at 7 o'clock
Saturday night. The body was dis
covered Sunday morning in a lot near
his residence.
Suspicion fell upon William Urant
ley and Pavid Credle, and they were
apprehended and guarded separately,
no communication being allowed.
Credle confessed that he was present
.vheii J. P.. Conner was murdered; that
W.C. Crantley did the shooting; that
I riah Cell and Sberrard Uell, the latter
only hi, were also present; that there
was a band of robbers, to plunder
.lores and people, and to murder if
necessary; that K. F.Cherry and Alex
llndnell, merchants, were also to be
murdered. Credle also confessed that
they met Conner face to face; that
linmfiley spoke to him pleasantly, then
knocked him down on the sidewalk;
that Coniierpleaded for his life, prom
ising not to betray them, but offering
to give them all his property, antt he
also begged them to spare his life for
the sake of his motherless children, but
Crantley paid "Shoot him 1" and shot
him. Young Cell then shot him and
all of them threw his body over the
fence among the weeds, wnere it was
round. All four of the gang lead a
real .lesse .lames life, and organized
their robber gang on that basis. All
were taken to Washington, N.C.,ona
special steamer under guard.
Southern Kailway for nothing. There
is not a shadow of truth in it. It then
said that 1 was a disappointed candi
date for Director of the N. C. K. K. Co.
This too is wholly untrue. This cor
miration seeks to divert public at ten
tion from its gross oppression of the
people of the State by making a per
sonal issue with me. I his is a contes

of its deep-seated malignity towards

'Foreign corporations have no abso
lute right of recognition in other
States. The State may exclude them
entirely. It may restrict its business
to particular localities or exact secur
ity for thu performance of its con
tracts. The whole matter rests in the
discretion of the States."
So that we conclude that the State
of North ('arolina may exclude any
foreign corporation from the State or

pru-rata on its shares of stock, or on its
gross receipts or pledge a specific tav
on its cars or tax it in any other way
it may choose. It is right, it is just
that these taxes should be imposed on
the property of these wealthy corpor
ations. They neither "toil nor spin."
About all the big ollieials do is to lo
cate in the county and kill all the
quails in reach and draw salaries from
$10,0! to $ .V) ,000, while their poor em
ployees have scarcely enough paid
them to keep soul and body together.
Look at the palatial private cars of
these oliicials! It took a newspaper a
half a column to describe the magnifi
cence and luxurious apartments of
Vice-President Andrews' car, in which
he ives i u such gorgeous splendor, as he
rolls along through the State. Liveried
servants await the tap of his electric
bell and while his table is loaded with
the most costly viands, tin finest of
liquors fill the side-board. Yet this
costly mansion, costing perhaps $20,000,
pays no tax, while the farmer pays tax
on ins wagon, ins uog-can ana nis
cabin; nothing escapes. Let apeeitic
tax of $500 be placed on every one of
these cars. It would have been honest
and Christian and just if the money
put in these cars bad been paid to tne
poor creditors of the K. it D. K. II. Co.,
instead of being turned over to its suc
cessor. It would tie more consistent,

Tbe Iegilature ought to lake early

remaining out of their grap and. a
usual, in their greed they are trj ing at
the rame time to destroy ail the
branches feeding this road.
Its plan is to force a sale of tbe main
line and purchase it, and then to bar
rass and embarras tf.e hort feeder
branches by discriminations and de
lays in transportation until the own
ers will be compelled to sell out to them
for whatever price this wicked mono
poly may otter to its victim.
It peems that the Governor of the
State ought, if necessary, call the Leg
islature together that 'Tt may enact a
law to prevent the consummation of
this crime, or the Caltimore syndicate
ought to postpone a sale until the next
Legislature meets in order that it may
take action. It seems that the judges
of the Federal Courts would grant this
delay in order to rescue the citizens of
North ("arolina, who have invested
their whole capital in these branches

year, until the Farmers' Alliance ob
tained control of the Legislature and
forced the Commission upon them.
I had the opportunity to know and
do know that the accidents to life and
limb on the railroads have been re
duced fully one-half if not more one
half is on the safe side. This result
was obtained through the Commission,
which compelled the railroads to keep
their tracks in repair and to take up
the dangerous, refupe, old iron, which
the Kichmond it Danville Kailroad
Company had placed on t tie? Western
North Carolina Kailroad. The Kich
mond it Danville Kailroad Company
had made this road the dumpingground
for all the old worn out rails in their
system. It is now a fine, safe road.
The old trestles called 'spider-Tegged
trestles" have been taken out and
good bridges and viaducts substituted.
This road bail become the nignt-mare
of all travellers and the ridicule of all
strangers, until the Kailroad Commis
sion compelled the Kichmond it Dan
ville Kailroad Company and the South
eru to put it in good repair. Look, too,
at the nice, comfortable depots tney
have been forced to erect and the other
conveniences and improvements. As
you go to Kaleigh, notice the elegant
little depot at tmiversity station
which succeeds the old, worn out, filthy
box-car, which the Kichmond it Dan
ville Kailroad Company forced ladies
and gentlemen to go into for shelter
when it was hardly fit for swine to in
habit. The university road too, was
as bad as the Western with its old
worn out iron, but now it has been put
in order. Look at the improvements

Omaha, Neb , Nov. 27. The commer
cial congress consumed a part of to
day's session in the discussion Of a free
silver resolution. Some hesitation was
exhibited about provoking a discussion
on this topic, but since the ice has
broken, the delegates are becoming
quite enthusiastic. The following ter
egranf to the congress from Governor
O'Connell, of Idaho, has created con
siderable commotion aiuong the dele
gates :
I notice by press dispatches mat
Mr. W'hitmore. in his remarks yester
day said that the silver question had
recently lost ground, anu inai it is no
longer a subject ot interest with Hie
convention. I beg leave to record a
difference of opinion on that subject.
the delegates who constitute your

congress are sent mere noi oy uie
votes of the people, but by appoint
ment, and I suggest to you gentlemen
that you make a mistake if you indorse
anv resolution announcing to ine civ
ilized world that the opinions or llie
thoughtful men in the West have
changed on th"s question. Although
the people of the. West have been in
formed trom day to uay mat times are
improving and that the country is be
coming more prosperous, shipments of
gold to foreign nations ana uieir re
turns from commission houses, houses
to which consignments of the product
of the farm and range have been made
indicate that a crisis has been reached.

KIOHT TO PRKVKNT REMOVAL OK CASKS
III my last article I showed by refer
ence to cited cases in the Reports of
the Sunreine Court of the I'nited
States that
FOREKi N COK I'O U. AT IO NS
had no riijhl to operate a railroad in
North Carolina: that it was only a
t-irih;ir extended to them through the
courtesy of the State and that the leg
islature of the Htate had the power to
withdraw that privilege whenever it
pleased to do so, or it might attach any
conditions it pleased to the exercise
of this privilege.
That the legislature had the power
to pass a law that no foreign corpora
tion either railroad, insurance or ouier
kind, should exercise any of its func
tions or do any business in the State,
as operating railroads, without first
taking out a license and that the Sec
retary of State should revoke that li
cense at any time up n inf ormation
lodged with him that such foreign
corporation had removed or was en
deavoring to remove any of its cases
from the State to the Federal courts,
liovle vs. Insurance Company. Ul V.
S.Keports, page f.:$.' settles this ques
tion. .See also Rector vs. Philadelphia,
21 Howard, page oOO.
Therefore that it was the duty of
the next legislature of 'orth
the example oi
not hear?" "Shall not the Judge of all
the earth do right?"
WHAT OTHER STATES IIAVKDONE.
The State of South Carolina, in the
exercise oi us constitutional rignis,
as heretofore set forth, has by a con
stitutional amendment absolutely
forbidden any foreign railroad cor
poration to do business in that
State and required every rail
road man doing business in its bord
ers to take out a charter from that
State.
Our State might wisely follow that
precedent so as to place all railroad
corporations foreign and domestic, on
a legal equality, and not subject our
home companies to burthens which
these foreign invaders refuse to carry.
In order that our legislators may
carry out these just and reasonable re
forms I will endeavor, in some future
communication, to draft and publish
acts to tie introduced in the next legis
lature by them in order to effect this
purpose, of course subject to amend
ment or improvement such as their
wisdom may suggest. I know that it
often happens that an honest and
faithful legislator wishes to. accom
plish some beneficial legislation, but
has no one to draft an act for him. It
is very necessary that the bills be
drawn carefully and in such shape as
tube sustained 'by the decisions of the
courts, and that the legislature be
warned of the effect of amendments
which the enemies of the people may
endeavor to place upon them.

The corporations always have a few
men in each house to do their dirty
work, and these members receive their
instructions in secret at railroad head
quarters and after night. Corpora
tions are rich enough to employ the
best lawyers and they exact of them
the best of work. These gentlemen do
this work professionally and are not
resnonsible for tbe propriety ot uiese

It is th only power which ever fought

The railroads will curse the Alliance;
but, all the same, they are in terror of
it.
The next legislature should, early in
its session, raise a joint committee on
railroad reform and let it formulate a
code, incorporating the advanced leg
islation ot otber states mat nave

will astonish our people how far they

1 sincerely thank The Caucasian
for allowing me to speak to
the people of '.North Carolina
through its columns. 1 offered to
sneak through a leading Democratic
newspaper, but my offer was declined.
It is all well, However, ior 1 spea& to
20,000 people through Thk Caucasian,
when 1 could scarcely have reached
5,000 through other sources. I will try
to be careful in stating my proposi
tions of law and in sustaining them
by -reference to indubitable authority,
so that in time, if it be desired, these
articles may be printed in a pamphlet
form for the information of the people
and for ready reference in debate.
The field is a wide one and it will
take a while to exhaust the subject. I
may go down personally under my
physical infirmities, or by other mis
fortunes, but the principles I am enun
ciating are as deathless as the law,
and when 1 lay down the discussion,
youuger, stronger, and if possible
more enthusiastic defenders of the
people against licensed greed and cor
porate avarice, will take it up. I have
been amused at some of the means sug
gested by the otlicers of the Southern
to force me to silence. It won't do. -I
am not for sale, nor can 1 be intimida
ted. It is a fight to the finish as long
good friend, to pass unchallenged.1
