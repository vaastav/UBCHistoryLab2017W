COLONEL ZABRISKIE IN ERROR.
*At a meeting of the California Prison Com- '
§ mission in San Francisco on Tuesday night .
Colonel Zabriskie made a speech in which ha '
charged that . the late Prison Investigating '
Commission was a whitewashing job.' In
making thia statement Colonel Zibriskie did '
injustice to the Commission and to himself. '
He , demonstrated incontestably that he did
not know what he . was talking about, to be
gin with, , for no sane and intelligent man
can read the report of tire Commission with
out . being convinced that it was the moat
thorough and . conscientious investigating
body that has ever sat on any public mattef
■". -: in this State. ; Now if Colonel Z -.brisk ie has
, not read the report of the Commission his
conduct in denouncing it was most discredit
able to himself. And if, having read the re
port, he still declared it to be a vrhttewiwhiDg
one, he proves himself either to be deficient
v in intelligence or wanting in honesty. No
; matter ; what the facts may be as ito
;*. his preparation, he baa made . a ccindalon-ly
'also accusation against the Commission I [
-if. he has been reported correctly.
* Had the facta and lonciuMons of the Com- j \
• mission been acted upon there would by this
time have been no serious abuses remaining .
- in the prison administration. That these facts ! '.
and conclusions have up to the present time |
teen ignored is certainly not tho fault of the
Commissioners. If honorable citizens cannot '
undertake publicdutiescf this unremunerative
and disagreeable character, without being ex
posed to gross and malicious aspersions at j
the hands of people who are too lazy or reck
.. less to ascertain the facta of the case, it will
.... so:n become impossible to obtain the services
yot t any but .venal . and subservient men
■ for stiEilaT tasks. The plain truth is that the
late Prison Commissioners went over the
whole ground which has sines been traveled
-* in : a dilettanti : * and purposeless way by
amateur penologists, and that they presented
a report which might , well be adopted as a '
pride to future legislation. Their labors :
havo thus far been unfruitful through no fault
of theirs, and if censure is to be visited it !
should be directed to the responsible parties.
w Assuredly the Commissioners are . under no

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
'- President 'Arthur's firet mes*a*re is ;an ex- (
■eedingly^'comprehensive and business-like j |
locunr ent.i'lt - embraces so many subjects -
.hat it is in" fact » condensed \ review of all ,
ha departments ot the Government. t- Noth- j
ing could be more unlike the elaborate argu- j
nentative state papers which were formerly ;
issued by the Presidents on these occasion*- . j
And next to its comprehensiveness must be
remarked its conservatism. The President
lias apparently refrained as much as possible
from ) the , expression .of ; decided r opinion v
though where he has done so his views are set
forth with satisfactory clearness and force.
As a literary composition the message is de
cidedly praiseworthy. The style is at once
simple 7 and lucid, and sufficiently dignified.
In regard to most of the subjects treated of
tho President indorses the recommendations
of the various '] heads of ; departments; -He
approves the suggestions of the Secretaries of
War and of the ; Navy, looking toward the
increase of the army and the rehabilitation
of the navy. On the latter bead he expresses
himself wit!) commendable decision, plainly
believing that it is impossible for the country
to maintain a vigorous foreign policy unless
it is in a position to enforce whatever reso
lutions it may come to. It is not necessary
to follow him in his comments on our foreign
relations, all of which are peaceful and satis
factory. He holds out hope that the Chilean
difficulty will be adjusted . by the . special
Envoy who has been dispatched to Santiago
for that purpose, and he shows a proper de
termination to maintain friendly relations
with - Mexico, despite the recent efforts of
certain adventurers to foment a quarrel be
tween the two countries.
No doubt President Arthur's views on
civil service reform have been looked for with
interest and curiosity. On this subject he
expatiates at some length. While declaring
himself ia favor of whatever measures will
put the civil service on a satisfactory basis he
intimates doubts whether the methods which
have proved so successful in England cm be
adopted here without such changes as might
materially alter their effects. At the same
time ha earnestly approves the law (latterly
become a dead letter) which provides for the
maintenance of a Civil Servico Commission,
and he calls on Congress to make the neces
sary appropriation. It is not very easy to
define the President's position on the whole
question, for though he is careful to avoid all
suspicions of hostility to civil service reform
he seems to have gone rather out of his way
to suggest difficulties, some of which will not
bear analysis. Thus bis apparent indorse
ment of the objection that the English sys
tem tends to create an official class, and that
it excludes middlo-aged men from the public
service, cannot be seriously defended. For
as a matter of fact all American politicians
do now endeavor to the best of their ability
to make a career of the public service, and a
great number succeed in this. And as to the
apprehended exclusion of middle-aged and
elderly men from the civil service, reflection
shows that if such exclusion came about it
would really be a benefit to the service, since
the presumption must be that men who only
seek in middle life to enter the public service
in subordinate positions, have failed in the
callings which they first chose, and are conse
quently of inferior caliber. . To secure the
best material for the public service the re
wards of that service must be made ade
quate, and there is no reason why it should
be made a place of refuge for incapables.
The President approves the idea of reduc
ing the internal revenue taxes, except those
on distilled liquors and tobacco. He thinks
that even if the debt i * not paid off so rap
idly as heretofore no harm will be done, and
no doubt many will agree with him. Yet we
think he is wrong in this. The best time to
get rid of the national debt is when pros
perity makes the people willing and able to
bear the burden. At present the American
public are in a very satisfactory frame of
mind on this subject, and if the present rate
of payments is kept up, the entire debt will
be cleared off in less than ten year.*, always
provided that the Pension Arrears bill does
not absorb tho surplus revenues. But we
cannot be sure that our present prosperity
will last. A succession of crop failures would
destroy the alacrity with which the people
now meet their fiscal obligations, and in such
an event we may be sure that the spirit of
repudiation, which has recently received
so unfortunate a stimulus under Republican
auspices, would become active and danger
ous again. Besides, the demand for the re
duction of internal revenue taxes comes from
the Protectionists, who desire to checkmate
all attempts at modification of the Tariff,
The President touches the Tariff question
very lightly, merely suggesting the desira
bility of a new Commission to examine
into it.
' His views on the Panama Canal question
are in complete accord with those already ex
pressed by Secretary Blame, and which may
be said to be the prevailing or national posi
tion on the subject. It is, however, obvious
that the .reconstruction of the navy must be
indispensable to tho proper maintenance of
this policy, and that the latter, without the
former, can amount to nothing more than a
blank discharge. The United States can
control the Panama Canal when it possesses
the necessary ironclads, but it cannot do so
without a better navy than it now possesses.
In this connection the President's observations
on ths increase of tbe navy will be found
pertinent and forcible. The business of the
Pension Bureau is summarized, showing the
enormity of the demands made upon tbe
Treasury under the Pension Arrears bill, hut
the President contents himself witb a state
ment of the facts, and makes no recom
mendation on the subject. X It will take neHily
000 clerks three years . to settle the claims
already on file, and it is estimated that $235,
--000,000 will be taken out of the Treasury be
fore the work is completed.
The ! President is strongly of opinion that
polygamy ought ta he extirpated, but ha only
suggests tho propriety of providing by law
that all persons forming marriages in Utah
shall be called upon under heavy penalties to
file certificates, and that plural wives be al
lowed 'to testify. As polygamous marriages
are celebrated in the Endowment Hon**.;, and
in secret, it is Difficult to see how any new
law can force the . Mormon priests to m&ka 1
public what they do. - They jre well aware
that their proceedings are c incealod, and it
is to be feared that they would pay as little
attention to such a law as they have to former
statutes. . We regret .to find [ the President
favoring the extravagant - and l inequitable
ship-subsidy policy, as a means of restoricg
our merchant marine. . This is perhaps the
most indefensible point in his message, and
it is calculated . to ■ produce very serious mis
chief. * For the rest, the message is of a char
acter ta increase public confidence in the
ability and good judgment of President Ar- j
thur, and it exhibits throughout a creditable
disposition to do justice to the entire country,
and to hold the balance a* evenly as possible
between its contending interests.

OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
The President [ does ;' not appear ;to have
studied ; political economy to much purpose,
though - there is ' nothing surprising in this,
seeing that he has all his life been engaged
in '- politics. yy It : is ' however ."■ not a little
curious that he should have manifested so
naire a perplexity as to the cause of the de
cline of our carrying trade, in his message to
Congress. %He observes that ,'.' there must be
" a peculiar hindrance to the development of
"this ; interes Y or the enterprise and energy
"of American merchants i ani capitalists
"would \ have ' kept : this ' country J at] least
" abreast of our rivals in the friendly contest
" for ocean supremacy." // And then' he goes
on to suggest that the decline would not
have ocenrre i. " if ,we had given ■ the navi
" gation - interests ] a** portion of tbe ' aid ' in
"protection * which has* been *■ so wisely (?)
" bestowed upon ; cnr , manufactures." Un- !
doubtedly then is a "peculiar hindrance"
to the* development of ; the American ocean
c-tn-yin**: * trade Ti in fact there is mora than j
one. | The Navigation ' Law.- and \ the Tariff |
folly act-aunt for the phenomena which have j
puzzled the President,* however. One of the j
main causes of the decadence of our merchant
marine has been that very system of Protec
tion which be unfortunately, thinks • "wise.'*
Thero is an old saying ; that"*.' you can
not "* : "eat your * cake :. and f.- keep : . it
to,*," : -r and ;it has an application to
this subject.* Protection to home industry,
his raised the cost of American manufactures
far above those of England. '* The Protection
ists say that this is a good thing, because* it
gives ( our ;. mechanics * better *: wages, among
other results. . : But it also excludes American
manufactures from foreign markets, and it is
very unreasonable and illogical : for the Pro
tectionists to complain of this. Their position
is that whatever sacrifices their . system in
volves are . more than compensated by ; its
benefits". But having taken this position
they arc now stultifying themselves by de
claring that there is no compensation for the
loss ; of foreign trade which is one of - the
effects of their policy. Nor can they by any
possibility undo the mischief they have done
by adopting the ship-subsidy policy. England
can command the carrying trade of the world
because she produces all her manufactures at
rates which enable her to compete success
fully for the trade of the whole world. . But
ships are of no use to * a country which is de
barred from developing a foreign trade.
We i could not put our manufactures in
competition with those of England in
foreign markets, as the case stands. ; Protec
tion has rendered that j impossible. . ' We
may pay J subsidies to steam lines to run
to foreign ports, hut so long as the Tariff
operates to exclude American products
from foreign markets we can never gain any
thing by such a policy. On the contrary, it
would be all sheer loss. We should be pay
ing .people to do something in which there
was no profit or hope of profit outside the
subsidies. ; They would do this something
so long as Congress made it worth their while,'
but we might go on paying subsidies till the
crack of doom without thereby establishing
a self -sustaining foreign trade. Such a policy
in short would be like muzzling a horse,
and then carefully leading it up to a well
filled crib. The only way .to restore our
merchant marine and our foreign trade is to
repeal the Navigation Laws and cut down the
Tariff. The new policy of subsidizing ships
is • only a device whereby the producers of the
country would be robbed to maintain an
a.-titicial and lifeless merchant marine, which
could neither compete with England nor build
up a genuine traffic of its own. "

Resolved, That the fruit-growers in every county,
where .Commissioners have not already been ap

eases, and are accompanied by a clean bill of health
from the Commissioners or Inspectors.
| Resolved, 1 hat all nurserymen shall be required
to disinfect all trees and plants to tbe satisfaction of
the Commissioners or Inspectors before delivering
them to their customers.'
r Resolved, hat we recommend to each and every
farmer and i t -grower, as good citizens < f the
State, to use all practicable means to keep his trees
free from all insect pests, that his orchards may not
become breeding grounds, to the damage of his
neighbors.
Resolved, That we request the transpoitation com
panies not to return fruit boxes or baskets between
the !sth of June and the 31st of December.
Resolved, That we recommend that the study of
entomology be introduced into our public schools, so
that the rising generation may be wiser than their
fathers. '• ■ '.-.
--| A discussion on part of report in reference to
return boxes ensued. V
P. H. Murphy favored return boxes.
J. 11. Ellititt, of Newcastle, said the commission
merchants say they sell our fruit at eight per cent,
comm «.si.;ii, but they give us what they can buy it
for in the market, less the eight per cent.
: M. Cooke said he was placed in a delicate position
in relation to return boxes, being a box-maker. '■ He
referred to the rules of quarantine, in which the
boxes are required to be disinfected in San Fran
cisco at the expense of the grower. ' He instanced
the practice of the late Mr. Saul, of the Oak Shade
orchards. He would not allow a box to be returned
to his orchard. The result was that he kept his or
chard clean, and sold last year 9,500 boxes of pears.'
Others who allow return boxes have their orchards
infested and their crops destroyed. He instanced
the Grand Island orchards, f *om which a few years
a-ro were shipped 4,000 boxes. Last year the fruit on
the whole is'and sold for five hundred dollars, and
this year they couldn't get anything for it, in conse
quence of the introduction of worms.' * -■ .
Mr. Wilson, of Newcastle, said if the boxes are
not returned the commission merchants make the
price of the. boxes, and they should pay the pro
ducer for them. •■'.-; '.'-'-
Mr. Hixon, a commission merchant, said the- boxes
from Oregon are all free or not returned. If the
matter was understood that all boxes were to be
free, then the commission merchant would make
nothing on the boxes, and would charge nothing
for them. Fruit in free boxes was preferred by re
tailers and consumers, because the boxes were not
required to be returned or paid for.
Mr. Fra-zer, of tlmira, said we are- ail here wilh
one object— to get rid of- the insect pest, and we
must stick to this subject. The worms lay their
eggs in all boxes free as well as return, audi hey,
too, go to all parts of the State and spread the worm
as well as the return boxes. It would be a hardship
on these who raise fruit, not infested by worms.
A. T. Hatch moved to amend by the adoption of
a thorough system of d'sinfectiou. Seconded.
K. Williamson was in favor of the amendment, as
it would work a great hardship on.that class of fruit,
growers who produced fruit, as peaches, chti ries,
plums, etc., to require them to send free boxes.
The point he wished to get at is, to have the
Convention recommend a thorough system of dis
infection. . .
Professor Dwinelle hoped the Convention would
have patience and investigate its subjects well, and
would suggest that a committee be appointed to in
vestigate the whole subject of boxes, to report at a
proper time. 5 hat other boxes than the apple and
pear are liable to have worm eggs in them— the
plum curculio might come in the next return box.
. M. T. Brewer said it seemed to him that if the apple
and pear boxes were made free a great deal would
be acc*in-:li9 ed ; he would not require peach boxes
to be disinfected, but go as far as possible without
injustice. * •-.-*■ < -
The substitute of Mr. Hatch was adopted, and the
report as amended adopted. --*-'.. •• *•--.:'*
The Comoiiuee on Fruit Shipping to the Eastern
Stales asked for farther time. Granted.
- The Committee on Shipping West of Omaha was
called, but were not ready to report.
The Committee on Fruit Packing, when called,
presented a communication from the fruit puckers
of San Frtncisco, suggesting the substitution of
tight boxes in place of baskets for peaches. Re
ferred to Fruit Packing Committee. -
;' The Committee on Commission Merchants re
ported through their Chairman, J. M. Hixon. The
committee recommended to " growers to do all they
can to improve their fruit." Me chants will aid them
in any way they can.
The Committee on Nurserymen reported in favor
of having all trees and plants well disinfected before
sending them out. ■ Report adopted.
. President Johnston called attention to the proposed
sale of the late Mr. Saul's interest in Oak Shade Or
chard, and recommended the property as a desirable
•one. Mr. Blowers also recommended the property
as a valuable one to a horticulturist. Mr. Cooke
also spoke of the property as one of the most valua
ble orchard proper ies in the State. .
Mr. Wiihamson moved that a committee cf five be
appointed to draw up a memorial to the memory of
Brother Saul.

bers, and also recommended that the Convention
take steps to have Mr. Cooke get up a more exten
sive work on fruit pests. Report adopted.
Mr. Williamson moved that a committee of five be
appointed to get up a plan ot disinfecting fruit
boxes, applicable to the circumstances of fruit
growers and fruit dealers. The motion was ad:pted.
. Afternoon Session.
The President announced the following members
as a committee on a system of disinfectants: R.

it. Hixon, R. B. Blowers -ind M. T. Brewer.
Mr. Hatch moved that the committee report on
January Ist to the Chief Horticultural Officer, and
publish the report in the Rural Prfss and Patron.
.: The President said he was informed that the re
grits of General Bidwell had been sent to the Con
vention by a delegate, and called on Mrs. Bid-veil,
who was present. - ' -
Mrs. Bidwell said that the General found it impossi
ble on account of private business to attend, and had
requested her to represent him. 1 he announcement
was received with warm applause."
Ths Committej on Fruit Shipped East reported
that over 400 cars of fruit had been shipped to the
Eastern States this year ; that oue of the drawbacks :
to shipping is the rate of freight by the railroad",
and the other the insect pests. These are net the
only drawbacks, but the condition of the weather
and the market on arrival. The last two an; un
avoidable, but the two former are remedial and
should be remedied. ---■'-.';'." > : .*
Mr. Murphy said that this report brought up im
portant' subjects, and something should be done to
get a reduction in freight rates by the railroads. ■ : •

been adopted by the National Grange and slit out
to the several State Granges f :r signatures, directed

The Committee on Shipping Fruit East, but to ter
ritory west ed Omaha, throush W. K. Strong, re
ported that the market was large and rapidly in
creasing ; that the best varieties are demanded ; that
fruit should be well packed and should be picked at
the proper stage. ;. They also recommend uuiformity
in packages, and named the size of the box for each
variety ; also recommend the use of a free box for
this market ; that honesty in packing, would well
repay shippers, and then went into a description of .
the vast markets that were opening up for California
fruits, and ' recommended that growers put their
names on the outside of the box.
: Mr Murphy said this was a new departure in fruit
shipping ; that he bad been requested not to stencil
Irs fruit b *xes by shippers. *~* *" -.. *• y .
Here explanations were mode by shippers Hint

"* Ihe President called on Mr. Wilson to open the
discussion on ) runing. - He excused himself and
called on Dr. Chapin, who responded. '
0 Dr. Chapin saia he preferred tbe saw and prumng
shears to the knife, as more convenient, and ail
wounds made in pruuin*- should be covered with
wax or other material to keep the air f rom the wood.
The cut should be made close to the bud and above
it, and the wound will readily heal over during the
season's growth and not leave a projection of dead
wood. "All trees should be pruned while young, to
as to keep tbem in form and Tender the cutting
away of largo limbs unnecessary. ■ The saw used
should be of a narrow blade, like a butcher's saw,
aud not the ordinary pruning saw. Woulil.recom
uiend summer prunin? by pinching back the tender
ends when the- shoots have obtained about the re
quired length, ard pinching the second or even the
third time, as may be necessary, as will be the case
:;: some instances.
Robert Williamson said that he was decidedly in |
favor of the low training of trees, so that they might j
protect their stems from the sun and be less liable
to blow ■■ over . also recommended covering all
wounds with siting wax or paint ; favored fall
pruning to develop fruit buds, and did not favor
pinching back terminal buds during sumpier, but
would -at off ; gave illustration of benefits of low
training by statin? that the best cherries he had
ever eaten were picked within six* inches of the
ground, and that a first-cla?s cherry-grower said he
could pick six times as many cherries if within six
feet of the ground as he can if twenty feet from the
ground ; had picked peaches from low trees and got
more than from high-trained ones. ; ':.
W. H. Jessup said that Mr. WiHamson had struck
the key-note of the subject in recommending low
training, and to use saw or knife in preference to
shears. - - - ■'- ■■ ■...--.--. •-■■■- *:-.- ■-.-■

During the past fortnight there
has been so much of interest through-
out the general stores to demand bur
attention that we have scarce had .
time to even speak of 31 EN'S AND
BOYS' CLOTHING. The truth is,
all that is needed to increase trade
in this department is not better
materials, more conscientious
making, or lower prices ; but that
more people should become ac-
quainted with the advantages we
offer. Remember
First— We have the largest stock
in Sacramento.
Second— Where the stock is largest
the line of sixes is most complete, and
hence it follows that people can ob-
tain more per feet -fitting garments.
Third— Large sales make large
buying, and large buying \ brings low
prices.
