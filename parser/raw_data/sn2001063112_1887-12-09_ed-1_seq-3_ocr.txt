ii.tr country's development, preventing
iuvesnneiii in productive enterprises,
threatening disturbance, working
schemes of public plunder.
Then lollow the figures of the trea
sury department showing the surplus
at the end of the present fiscal year,
ui.d the president draws deductions
from them in support of his argument,
lie continues:
There scums to lie no assurance that
v. iui such a withdrawal from use of
lae people's circulating medium the
l- :. iiiess community may not in the
n-.ir Iuture be subjected to the same
distress which was quite lately pro
duced from the same cause, and while
the unctions of our national treasury
should lie few and simple, and while
its best condition would be reached, 1
believe by its entiredisconnectiou with
the private business interests,and by a
perversion of its purposes it idly
link's money uselessly subtracted from
the channels of trade.there seems to be
room for the claims that legitimate
means should be devised by the gov
eminent to restore in an emergency
without waste or extravagance such
money to a place among the people. Lf
such an emergency arises there now
exists no clear and undoubted ex
ecutive power of relief.
There follows a suggestion that the
surplus may be used to lake up the
government b.inds—if the holders are
willing to give ihetn up. The presi
dent goes on to say:
1 have deemed it my duty thus to
bring to the knowledge of my country
men as well as to the attention of their
representatives, the gravity of our tin
ancial situation. The failure of the
congress heretofore to provide against
the dangers which it was quite evident
the very nature of the difficulty must
necessarily produce, caused a condition
of financial distress and apprehension
since the last adjournment,which taxed
to the utmost all the authority and ex
pedients within executive control, and
these appear now to be exhausted. If
disaster results from the continued in
activity of congress, the responsibility
must rest where it belongs.
t-'ree Trade Itecoiniuuuiled.
It needs hardly to be stated that
while the present situation demands a
remedy we can only be saved from a
predicament by a removal of the cause.
Our scheme of taxation, by which this
needless surplus is taken from the peo
ple and put into the public treasury,
consists of a tariff of duties levied on
importations from abroad and internal
revenue, taxes levied on the con
sumption of tobacos and spiritous
and malt liquors. It must be consid
ered tnat none of these taxes relating
to anything subjected to internal reve
nue taxes, are strictly speaking neces
sary. Our present tariff laws, the va
rious inequitable arid illegal source ot
unnecessary exaction, ought to be at
once revised and amended.
In a readjustment of the tariff
the interests of American labor
engaged in manufactories should be
carefully considered as well a3 the
preservation of our manufaeturies. It
may ue called protection or by any
other name but relief from the hard
ships ami dangers of our present tarifl
laws should be devised with especial
precaution against imperiling' the ex
istence of our manufacturing interest
•But this existence should not mean a
condition which without regard to the
public welfare or a national exigency,
must always insure the realization of
immense profits instead of moderately
profitable returns.

and at the same tune to emphasize a
suggestion that in accomplishing this
purpose we may discharge a double
dun to our people by granting to them
a means ot relief from tariff taxation
in quarters where it is most needed
aim lrom sources where it can be most
fairly and justly accorded.
lie question thus imperatively pre
sentod tor solution should be-approach
ed in a spirit higher than partisanship,
and considered in the light of that re
gard for patriotic duty which should
characterize the action of those in
trusted with the weal of a corilidinfr
people, but the obligation to a declared
party policy and principle is not want
ing to urge prompt and effective action.
13oth or the great political parties now
represented in the government, have,
by repeated and authoritative declara
tions, condemned the condition of our
laws which permit the collection from
the people ot unnecessary revenue, and
have, in the most solemn manner,
promised us correction.
But the entire withdrawal of such
advantage should not becontempi ated.
rhe question of free trade is absolutely
irrelevant, and the persistent claim
made in certain quarters that any ef
forts to relieve the people from unjust
and unnecessary taxation, are the
schemes of so-called free traders
is mischievious and far removed from'
any consideration for the public good
The simple and plain duty which we
owe the people is to reduce taxation to
the necessary expenses of an economi
cal administration of the government,
and to restore to the business of the
country the money which we hold in
the treasury, through a perversion of
government powers. These things can
and should be done without danger to
the opportunity for remunerative labor
which our working men need and with
benelit to them and all our people, by
cheapening their means of subsistence
and increasing the measure of their
comforts.
The Condition of the Country.
The constitution provides that the
president shall from time to time give
to the congress information of the
state of the Union, it has been the
custom of the executive iu compliance
with this provision to annually ex
hibit to the congress at the opening of
its session the general condition oi the
country, and to detail with some par
ticulars the operations ol the different
executive departments. It would be
especially agreeable to follow
this course at the present time and
to call attention to the
valuable accomplishments of these de
partments during the last liiscal year,
but am so much impressed with the
paramount importance of the subject
to which this communication has thus
far been devoted, that shall forego
the addition of any other topic ami
only urge upon your immediate consid
eration the state of the union asshown
by the present condition of our treas
ury and our general fiscal situation
upon which every element of our
safety and prosperity depends. The re
ports of the heads of departments,
which will be submitted, contain full
mid explicit information, touching the
transaction of business intrusted them,
and sucii recommendations relat
ing to legislation in pub
interest as they deem ad
visable. I ask for these reports and
recommendations the deliberate, ex
amination and action of the legislative
branch of the government.
There are other subjects not em
braced in the department reports de
manding legislative consideration and
which 1 should be glad to submit.
.Some of them, however, have been
earnestly presented in previous
messages, and as to them
beg leave to report prior recom
mendations. As the law makes
no provision for any report from the
department of state a brief history of
transactions iu that important depart
ment. together with other matter which
may hereatter be deemed essential to
commend to the attention of congress,
may furnish the occasion for a future
communication.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The annual
report of the secretary of the treasury
was made public at noon today. It de
votes much attention to the question
of surplus revenue, and the revision of
the tariff and its conclusions and re
commendations are the same as those
contained in the president's message.
Under the title of custom's adminis
tration, definite annual appropriations
for the support of the customs service,
is recommended to take the place of
the present system. The secretary
also says the value of silver in hi3
hands must be kept on a par with gold,
hence the limit to the treasury holdings
of silver should be tixed and coinage
suspended when the limit is reached.
Sold the Message.
Xi-:w YORK, Dec. 7. The Tribune
prints the following prominently:
There was a report in Wall street
yesterday afternoon which some iu
(luiry tended to conlirm, that a steno
grapher in Washington, employed by
Col. Dan Lauiont, the president's pri
vate secretary, had sold a part of the
president's message to some all street
speculators. It was said that a large
part of the president's message had
been dictated to this stenographer from
the president's first draft in order that
he might make a clear copy in type
writing for use in the public printing of
fice. This stenographer was said to
have made three copies of the type
written draft of the portion
of the message, some ninety
live pages dictated to him, and sold
two copitss to speculators in New York.
Inquiries were made of a number of
brokers last night in regard to the
matter. Nearly all of them protested
ignorance of it, but B. H. Preston, on
whom a Tribune reporter called, ad
mitted that he knew of the existence
in this city in the hands of Wall street
speculators of at least one advance copy
of parts of the message.

1 live at -'II Vork siri't-l. Ji-i'Sf-y City, and on
an-lvin l.omo one liiiilit I l'oimd copy ol tlie
Hiiaker Almanac that liad iiruii left during the
(lav. 1 read the article, "What is tills Disease
tiiit is (.'oniint: Upon l.rs'.'" It deseribeil my
symptoms' and lei-iin^s hettcr than 1 could if I
had rit.H ii a v.-imlo hook. Jty trouble was iii
d.-ed "like a thief in the iiiKiit, 'for it had been
stealing upon me unawares for years. 1 :-eni .for
a iiottie of Siiaker lixtract of Hoots, or Seigel's
Syrup, and before I had taken one-lialf of it I
felt the welcome rel'ef. In a few weeks 1 was
like my old self, enjoyed and digested my
food. 5kiv kidneys soon recovered tono an'1
slren^th.'and tlie urinary trouble vanished. I
was well.
Millions of people need some medicine simply
to act ori the h-.wels. To them 1 commend
Shaker Extract in the strongest possible terms.
It is tlie, gent lest, plcasar.test. safest and surest
purgative in this world. The most deleeate
women and children may take it. One point
more: I have all the more conlidence in tills
medicine because it is prepared by the Shakers.
I limv claim to lie a religions man myself and I
admire tho Shakers for their zeal, consistency
and strict business integrity. What they make
may he trusted by the public. \V. II. 1IAI.L.
