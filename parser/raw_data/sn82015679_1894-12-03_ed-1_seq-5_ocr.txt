GREAT i:fJLISII L.AROII LHDCR AXD
31. P. GREETED IS M2V YORK.
With 'Others He Come to the Con
STresa ait Denver and to Study So
ciallam In Thin Country.
NEW YORK, Dec 2. Among the pas
sengers on the Cunard steamer Etrurla,
which arrived here this morning, was John
Burns, M. P., the great Socialist and labor
leader, of London. A delegation from the
labor organizations of New York city met
him at quarantine. The delegation con
sisted of E. F. Sweeney, Assistant Com
missioner of Labor; Samuel Gompers, pres
ident of the American Federation of Labor;
Chris Evans, secretary of that organiza
tion, and William O'Brien, the walking
delegate. Mr. Burns Is accompanied on
his present trip by two fellow-members of
Parliament llr. David Holmes, who repre
sents the town of Burley, in Lancashire,
and who Is president of the Weavers' Asso
ciation and a delegate to the conference
of the Federation of .Labor, and Mr. John
William Benn, member of the London
County Council and Msmber of Parliament
for St. George's "East. Mr. Benn Is deep
ly Interested in temperance affairs.
Mr. Burns, after he had greeted the com
mittee, asked to be excused for a moment,
while he glanced over a letter from a
relative, which had been, handed to him
by Mr. Gompers, pleading that "The solid
arity of labor began in the household."
Then he talked to the representative of the
press.
"It wduld be unfair to American people
for ma to talk about them now.". Mr.
Burns said, "for really I know very little
about them. I was pleased with the result
of your municipal election in New York
city for, as we understood it, the victory
was la the Interest of pure municipal poli
tics and as my principal work at present
is as a county councilor It was particularly
Interesting to me. I cannot talk fairly, of
American affairs for it would take years
of work for me to become familiar with
them in a way that wvuid be satisfactory
to me.. As for the Socialist movement in
England it has come to stay. It will grow
as it adapts itself to circumstances and as
long as it conforms to the conventions
which, have for so ' long made the upper
and middle classas the ruling power,
boclalisin. as U affects municipal matters,
1a not mixed up with other Issues.
WATCHING AMERICA.
"I have been watching the labor move
ment In America as closely as I could from
a distance', and I have concluded that there
must be a little more of the milk of hu
man kindness injected into labor affairs if
they are to progress as I would like to see
them progress."
On the dock were gathered about two
hundred members of the local labor unions,
who cheered loudly for "John Burns" as
he walked down the gang-plank. Then an
informal reception was tendered him, and
Mr. Dumar, of Typographical Union, No.
6, made a brief speech of welcome. In
responding, Mr. Burns said it was an
agreeable coincidence that he who had been
so strongly Identified with the docks in
England should make his first speech in
America on a dock, with the rattle of
trucks and the swash of waters in his ears.
Mr. David Holmes followed with a few
remarks, and then the party proceeded on
foot to the Colonnade Hotel along West
street. On many of the corners were gath
ered groups of dock laborers and cattle
men, who cheered for Burns as he ap
proached, and many of them, who had
oome from London, greeted him with the
old cry of the London dock strike, "How
are you, John?" to which inquiry Mr.
Burns responded by stopping and shaking
hands with them.
Later in the day Mr. Burns received a
cumber of newspaper men and talked for
an hour. After relating how Mr. Holmes
and he had been selected by the labor fed
eration at Norwich to represent that body
In tho American conference at Denver, he
said their duty was to convey the felicita
tions of English labor to that of America,
Of his own visit here he eald he came,
first, to observe the condition of the labor
movement In America and in what respects
it differs from that In England, and, sec
ond, as a member of Parliament, to visit
Congress and get a grasp of American po
litical affairs. The workings of the labor
department under Carroll D. Wright were
of great interest to him, and as a county
councilor he hoped to have the opportunity
of inspecting the various municipal de
partments of the great cities of America,
more particularly of New York and Chi
can'o TRADE UNIONISM.
Mr. Burns is Inclined to believe that
among the cosmopolitan American people
it Is possible to bring about concerted ac
tion for holding the wealthy in check to
prevent them from increasing their hold

devote particular attention to the study
of that problem. But, above all, he de
clared, it was for. trade unionism that he
was to work. He believed that ultimate
ly the principles of the trade union would
be universally regarded as necessary for
carrying out any movement for human
progress. The Pullman strike and the re
port of the Commissioner of Labor Mr.
Burns declined to pass an opinion on until
he had visited Pullman, which he meant to
do. In England the strike had been
watched closely, and the general sentiment
as declared was that It had been successful.
In regard to the differences arising in
the English labor movement, Mr. Burns
said of course they prevailed at times,
but the unions were generally altogether,
and had been singularly successful in sep
eratlng politics and trade unionism. He was
for fusion against faction in affairs of this
kind as applied to international affairs.
It is one of the efforts of socialism in Eng
land, he declared, to lift unskilled labor
out of the industrial hell below.
"Trades unions," he replied to another
question, "do not approve of conservatism
as a rule, though by this course they very
otten lose good men who are too con
servative for the hot-headed enthusiasts."
He believed in the conservative element,
for that type comprised the sincere men
and not the young ones who believed the
hub of the universe was situated on their
doorsteps. Socialists, he added, had to take
advantage of every means and they allied
themselves to the labor movement on the
principle that -the trade union bird in hand
is better than the Socialist bird In the
bush. The eight-hour law in the govern
ment shops, employing seventy thousand
men, Mr. Burns said, had become a fixturo
and was regarded as a great concession.
It is an actual eight-hour law and is rigid
ly enforced, thus helping unskilled labor
greatly. Many individual manufacturers
had also adopted the system without, so
far as he had heard, receiving any great
loss. Mr. Burn3 is an advocate of ma
chinery wherever It can be Introduced.
The question of opening saloons on Sun
day was put to Mr. Burns, and as he does
no: approve of liquor in any form, he op
posed such concessions. When the "side
door" was explained to him he said he con
sidered such an invasion of the law the
"essence of maladministration." After de
claring Incidentally that he was not a uni
versal peacemaker, but a universal fighter,
Mr. Hums grew more personal and he re
ferred to his election from Battersea the
district in which he said he was born, in
whose streets he had played, where he had
worked and where he had been chased
through the streets. He is an engineer and
a member of the Amalgamated Engineers,
the largest trade union in the world.
Of the Trafalgar square affair he said:
"I did what I thought was my duty there
cn two occasions. One of the ventures got
me six weeks in jail and the other almost
resulted in rive years." Mr. Burns's atten
tion was called to a recently published
statement that he had said American
workmen were "no better than African
slaves."
, "That statement," he replied, "is a super
structure of misconstruction, based on a
misunderstanding of what I said." Then he
explained that hit remarks had concerned
the condition of the Hungarians and Italians
of the coke region as depicted in our blue
books, and which, if true, he added, is
a disgrace to any civilized country on .the
face of the globe. Mr.; Burns will leave
New York on Wednesday and will spend six
weeks traveling through the States.
DOLHLE LITERARY LIFE.
31 tide One Success, but Didn't Wear
: and Trie Another Name.'
New York Recorder.
A serial story has been recently accepted
by one of our magazines that will Introduce
a new name to the public. Whether or not
the story will prove a genuine success re
mains to be seen. The editors evidently
thought that It was good. But here is the
interesting part of it. I happened to learn
by accident that this story is written by a
well-known writer an author who has been
before the public for a number of years,
but who writes this story under an as
sumed name.
Why, may be asked.
For a reafon equally Interesting. This
writer scored a very great hit with his
first book, written a long while ago. His
succeeding books did not repeat this suc
cess. He had been too successful at first.
From having his name on everyone's Hps
he gradually fell away from public favor,
other writers supplanting him in the pop
ular eye. until he found himself going about
peddling his work from place and unable
to sell it. The saying about him in the
magazine offices and book stores was. "Oh,
he is dead as a doornail. The people are
tired of him." His name was no longer an
attraction and his work would no longer
sell.
The writer is a sensible fellow, and was
not slow to grasp the situation. When he
found the cold shoulder everywhere, In
stead of growing bitter and finding fault
with the world, he grew philosophical. lie
left off visiting the editorial rooms and
went into the country. There he mused
scmewhat as follows:
"I am called a 'back number. The liter
ary purveyors think I am played out, and
if they think so. it's the same a if I was,
for they won't accept my stories. My name,
far from being an attraction any more, is
actually against me. I was so successful
at first that my first brilliant hit has ob
scured me now. What shall I do? I am
only forty years old, and in full possession
of my powers. They arc at their rlpe3t
now. I wlil test this judgment of the
world. I will see whether I am written
out, and as my name no longer will help
me I will make a fresh start under a new
name." He did so. and the result 13 a story ac
cepted by one of the magazines that had
been steadily declining his work. The ed
itor is quite unconscious of the real identity
of the writer, while the writer himself la
laughing in his sleeve and keeping quiet.
And he expects to keep quiet until he suc
ceeds in making a second reputation.
If he doe3 it will be an example well
worth the attention of not a few of his
fellow-writers.
The French Truvelluf? Schools.
Scientific American.
From early in the spring to late in the
fall there is a succession of fairs in the
different parts of France, some of which,
as the ginger-bread fairs of Paris, are
celebrated. These falr3 somewhat resemb'e
our American circus with its attending side
shows. A large number of caravan wagons
serve to carry the families of the owners
of the booths from place to place, other
wagons carry tents for performances of
various kinds, and in addition to the sale
of trinkets and eatables the dime museum
features are not forgotten. In many cases
the fairs are held without the walls of
the city or town, as then the edibles are
not subject to the municipal tax (octroi.)
In this nomadic kind of life the question
of the education of the children of these
people was a curious problem which wat
not solved until about three years ago.
when Miss Bonnefols founded a traveling
school for thv children of the foralns. as
their parents are called. There are at pres
ent two of the schools for Paris and its
immediate neighborhood. Huge caravan
wagons are used.
These wagons are eighteen feet Ion? and
ten feet wide. The light filters through
the. green linen l.ies, for the improvised
schooihouses have no windows. Black
boards, maus and all the usual parapher
KVrj
the advice of Emer
son and Arnold, and all
apostles of culture. How
shall we know if they
nalia of the schoolroom are provided. The
children range from about eight to fourteen
years, and the hours of instruction are
frorr. 8 to 10 in the morning and from 2 to
4 in the afternoon. The schools follow a
fixed Itinerary from spring to fall, while
in the winter they remain stationary.
As the children would be apt to be trans
ferred from one fair to another, the meth
od of instruction in the schools is Identical,
so that a student may have a lesson In
the school at Greneile in the morning and
recite his or her lesson at St. Denis in the 1
afternoon. The parents of the children rec
ognize the advantages of education, and are
disposed to help the schools as much as
their, limited resources will permit.
THE REIGX OF TUB BICYCLE.
The Present Passion for the Wheel Is
Not Likely Ever to Die Out.
Century Magazine.
What may be called, not improperly, the
bicycle passion has full possession of sev
eral leading countries of the world. Eng
land and France, notably those . parts of
them in and about London and Paris, have
been so given over to it for some time that
a large proportion of their population come
and go on their errands of business or
pleasure "on a wheel." Americans who
have recently traveled abroad have been
astonished at the general use of the bicycle
there, and have been still more astonished,
on returning to their own country during
the last year, to discover what headway
the passion has made here. It i3 said to
be a conservative estimate by competent
authorities that during the year now clos
ing a quarter of a million bicycles have
been sold In this country, and that the
number of riders approaches a million.
There are said to be over 50,000 in New
"iork and its neighborhood and fully half
that number in and about Boston. The lat
ter city caught the passion from Europe
some time before New York did, and has
a larger proportion of its population, male
and female, devoted to it.
Observers of the phenomenon are won
dering whether it is merely a passing
whim, or whether It "has come to stay;"
whether those who have taken It up will
continue it after the novelty has worn off.
or whether they will drop it for the next
new fad that shall come along. There are
many reasons for thinking that its stay
will be narmanent. TTnriMihe-n mn.r
those who take it up because of tits voaue-
win me ui it aiier a wnue. Put these will
not constitute a large proportion of the
whole number. The great body of riders
find in the bicycle a new pleasure in life
a means for seeing more of the world, a
source of better health through open-air
exercise, a bond of comradishlp, a method
of rapid locomotion, either for business
or pleasure, and many other enjoyments
and advantages which they will not re
llnqulsh. The bicycle has, in fact, becom
a necessary part of modern life and cou:d
not be abandoned without turning the social
progress of the world backward. Few who
have used it for a tour through the coun
try would think for a moment of giving
It up and returning to pedestrianlsm In
stead. Aside from the exhilarating joy of
riding, which every bicycle devotee will
assure you Is the nearest approach to fly
ing at present possible to man. there is the
opportunity of seeing a constantly chang
ing landscape.
The bicycle is indeed the great level?r.
It puts the poor man on a level with the
rich, enabling him to "sing the song of
the open road" as freely as the millionaire,
and to widen his knowledge by visiting the
regions near to or far from his home, ob
serving how other men live. He could not
afford a railway Journey and sojourn in
these places and he could not walk through
them without tiring sufficiently to destroj
in a measure the pleasure which he sought.
But he can ride through twenty, thirty,
fifty, even seventy miles of country in a
day without serious fatigue and with no
expense save his board and lodging. To
thousands of men and women the long
ing of years to travel a little as soon as
they could afford it is thus gratified, vir
tually without limit: for a "little journey
in the world" can be made on every re
curring holiday or vacation.
THE AUSTRALIA TICK.
An Insect Thut Sometime Makes Life
n. Uurdeu in the Antipodes.
Sydney Advertiser.
On each of three visits I have made re
cently to the bush I have unwittingly
brought home with me specimens of these
pests. One was industriously boring into
the ear of my little daughter before its
presence was noticed, and it had become
half hidden before the irritation which it
set up led to its being dislodged. A second
fastened on the back of the hand of my
aire, and a third fastened on to my hand,
and in each case Inflammation had set up
as the result of the boring of the insect.
All these specimens were minute black
specimens, resembling splinters of wood.
On Saturday, after returning from a visit
to the bush, I discovered an altogether
different specimen of the tick, whicn had
commenced operations upon my head and
at the back of my ear. This fellow had so
rirmly attached himself to my skin that it
was necessary to use force to remove him.
He was of a light brown, was of the shape
and about the same size as the common
house bug, and his lege were armed with
barb3, which fully accounted for the ten
acity which he possessed.
I narrate my experiences for the sake
of putting visitors, and especially children,
upon their guard against the venomous tick,
so that at the first indication of the pe
culiar irritation it sets up the insect may be
dis!odged. I make it a rule to have in a
handy place a pair of tweezers and a
ohlal of common turpentine. With the oil
1 saturate the section which has been takn
up by the tick turpentine destroys the tick,
and is an antidote to the venom and the
tweezers I- use to drag out the trespasser.
Should a dog be attacked by ticks he some
times suffers from paralysis of the part
tacked by the insects.

Voorlieei's Call for Finance Com
mittee Meeting on Tuesday Gives
Ilise to Speculation.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, pec. 2. President Cleve
land's message will go to Congress at noon
to-morrow. It was completed on Friday
afternoon and sent in from Wood ley to the
White House, where two copies were mads
by trusted clerks. These copies are "the
documents laid before the Speaker of the
House and the President of the Senate, re
spectively. It Is a time-honored feature
of the convening of Congress that a com
mittee from each body proceeds to the
White House and notifies the President
that Congress has assembled and awaits
his pleasure. The President, invariably re
plies that he will communicate to Congress
"a message In writing" and thus, too,- the
executive clerk of the White House, when
he delivers the President's message to the
two Houses, announces it. To carry out
to the letter this statement, Messrs. Young
and Pruden, two veterans of the clerical
force, have been laboriously copying Mr.
Cleveland's fine school-girlish hand to the
extent of some twelve or fifteen thousand
words. The labor is entirely unnecessary
for In neither house Is the manuscript
copy read. The Clerk of the House, as well
as tho Secretary of the Senate, use printed
copies to read from. For ' simultaneously
with the delivery of the message to either
House there are distributed among the
members and Senators printed copies of
the document, printed only on one side
of the sheet so that able statesmen who
read, the message can use the intervening
blank pages to jot down the thoughts which
they afterward launch on the world when
they are asked their opinion by the repre
sentatives of the press.
Mr. Cleveland is extremely solicitous that
thera shall be no premature publication
of the message and the most extraordinary
precautions have been taken at the Govern
ment Printing Office that there shall be
no leak, while the copies intended for the
use of members of Congress and of the
correspondents are being set up and printed.
As a matter of fact there Is little interest
felt In Mr. Cleveland's message thl3 year,
since the only matter of real news the
proposed scheme for currency reform is
practically made public to-night in Con
troller Eckels's report. The message will
be furnished to all the papers in the United
States at the same moment to-morrow
morning by the courtesy of the Western
Union Telegraph Company. Every year
. this company sends out the message from
Washington to every one of its offices
where a paper is published that will print
;he message. This year the Washington
jflice0 of the company did not receive a
!ebpy'fof the precious paper but, Instead, a
' clerk from the White House this afternoon
'left with a copy of tha message for New
' Vork and at 11 o'clock to-night it was put
on the wire at that city and sent out
over the country. The greatest secrecy
has been enjoined on all operators sending
r receiving this messaga and so faithfu
lave the men always shown themselves to
e In the past that there is not the least
fear of a leak. By daybreak the mes
sage will have been sent and the copy
illi then be held "in confldince" by the
Manager of every telegraph cftice until to
morrow when, at the moment that the
.nessaga is taken up by the Clerk of the
fious? to be read, the signal Is flashed over
ihe wires releasing the message, when each
telegraph office manager will promptly
hurry it to every newspaper office in his
territory. . ,
The same course will be taken to-morrow
night with Secretary Carlisle's report,
except that this paper will be handled by
the two grsat press associations. They will
send out their report of the Secretary's
nessage between 2 and 3 o'clock Tuesday
morning and deliver it to their clients about
noon on Tuesday in time for publication
tn tha afternoon papers. Mistakes occur
but very rarely. Last year the members
of Congress read the President's message
on their way to the capital through an
unfortunate error In one of the local news
paper offices and it has always been a
subject of much curious speculation how
t happened that the London Times was
able to print so suspiciously correct a
ivnopsis of the message tweive hours be
fore it was delivered to Congress.
1 LOO It OUT FOR SQUALLS.
Congress Sleets To-Day and There Are
SlKitn of Interesting Times.
WASHINGTON, Dec 2. The second ses
sion of the Fifty-third Congress begins to
morrow at noon. Beyond the passage of
the regular appropriation bills it seems
probable that little In the way of legisla
tion will be accomplished at the short ses
sion, although several important proposi
tions will doubtless be pressed to the front.
Among the members of the dominant party
in the House, over half of whom were de
feated for re-election, there is a great deal
of bitter feeling against the administration
for real or fancied grievances. It will be
the purpose of the Democratic leaders to
curb as far as possible the display of re
sentment, but the Republicans will spare
no pains to provoke and goad their de
feated adversaries into letting loose their
vials of wrath. If the President outlines
a financial scheme In his message to-morrow,
as anticipated, it will probably furnish
the opponents of his banking and financial
views their desired opportunity. In the
course of the session it is understood the
Nicaragua canal project will be brought
prominently forward. At the opening of the
Congress, however, routine matters will be
kept to the fore to stave off. as far as
possible, unpleasant references to the elec
tion, which would prove distasteful to hc
majority, but this policy can be only par
tially successful as the latitude allowed in
debate on appropriation bills will throw
the doors open to remarks on any subject.
Before the adjournment for the holidays
it will be necessary to pass an appropria
tion to carry out the tariff bill provision
levying a tax on Incomes, the collection of
which begins Jan. 1, and while It will no
doubt meet with much opposition and lead
to a general review of the arguments
against such a tax, the general Impression
Is that It will pass by a Urge majority.
The impeachment of Judge Itickj, of the
Northern district of Ohio, will also furnish
a diversion before the holidays, if the Ju
dicial committee which investigated the
charges should present a resolution of Im
peachment and it should carry. The trial
would occur in the Senate, the Chief Jus
tice presiding. Impeachment proceedings
are rare and novel, and this one, the first
since the trial of President Johnson, would
attract national attention. To-morrow, if
a quorum be present In the House, as
seems almost certain, after the calling of
the roll, nothing will be done probably be
yond the reading of the President's
message. No definite programme has been
arranged for tha remainder of the week.
The committee on appropriations, however,
has two bill almost prepared, the pen
sions and fortifications bills, and they will
be reported on Tuesday, so that work on
them can be entered on Wednesday.
Voorhees Hua a Scheme.
WASHINGTON. Dec 2. -The Senate will
be called to order Monday, at noon, when
the last session of the Fifty-third Congress
will begin. The Vice President is In the
city and will preside. The session will be
gin with a full calendar, the result of com
mittee action during the long session, and
it contains at least two hundred Items,
covering a wide range of matters. Nothing
has transpired to indicate which of these
two hundred questions will receive first at
tention, whether they will be taken in their
order or whether the calendar will be fol
lowed at all. Much Interest is felt among
Senators of all political beliefs in the Pres
ident's message and in the recommenda
tions which the Secretary of the Treasury
will make on financial questions. These
will have much to do in directing the
course of the Senate. If there are recom
mendations for radical departures In finan
cial methods they are sure to lead to much
speech making early In the session, and
later to form the basis of committee ac
tions. Significance is also attached to Senator
Voorhees's declaration that he will ask the
finance committee to sit on Tuesday. Tues
day is the day for the regular weekly meet
of this committee, but It does not ordinarily
meet so promptly after the assembling of
the Senate. Chairman Voorhees declines
to state the object of the meeting further
than to say that it Is to be held for the
purpose of permitting an exchange of views
among members. If the President's " mes
sage be received Monday the executive rec
ommendations could of course be taken up.
but as there had been no positive assur
ance as to when the message would come
in when the meeting was decided on it
would appear that the chairman had other
objects in view. It is possible that his
purpose may be to arrange a policy on the
supplemental tariff bills. These bills have
all .been reported by the committee, but it
may be considered necessary to discuss
them further before deciding on a plan of
action. The Democratic majority of the
finance committee is on record in favor of
the passage of the bills, and it is not im
probable that the early action of the com
mittee is sought to frustrate any attempt
to prevent consideration. This is not alto
gether surmise, for it is known that some
of the so-called conservative Senators have
advised that a general party conference be
held soon after the Senate convenes for
the consideration of this question. The ex
perience of the last session showed that
whenever caucuses were held the conserva
tives carried their points. Hence there is
reason for the prompt action of the friends
of the supplementary bills. There appears
to be nothing outside of financial or tariff
questions likely to excite a ripple during
the week, and it is not certain that, what
ever may happen later in the session, there
will be much in these lines to disturb the
general serenity of the Senate during the
next few days. After the receipt of the
President's message, and when it gets to
business, the Senate may take up the cal
endar in regular order, or It may proceed
to consider out of order some of the more
important bills which have been reported,
such as those for the admission of Ari
zona and !New Mexico, or the bankruptcy,
anti-option or Nicaragua bills. In any
event the dally sessions of the week will
be short, with the probabilities strongly
in favor of an adjournment from Thursday
until 'Monday of the week following.
GENERAL SWAIM'S CASG.
President Cleveland Remits Unexpired
Portion of Ills Sentence.
WASHINGTON", Dec. 2. By direction of
the President Secretary Lamont to-day
made an order remitting' the unexpired
portion of the sentence of Brlgr.Gen.Davld G.
Swalm, Judge Advocate-general of the army,
and directing him to take station in Wash
ington city awaiting further orders of the
department. It Is understood that General
waim will take leave of absence and will
be placed on the retired list Dec. 22 next,
when he will have reached the age of slxty
twj years.
Gen. David Gasklll Swalm was born in
Salem, Ohio, Dec. 22, 1834. He left the prac
tice of law to enter the army as a second
lieutenant In 1861. As captain he took part
in the battle of Shlloh. Murfreesboro and
Perryvllle. He was at Washington until
December, 1862; assltant adjutantgeneral to
Generals Rosecrans and Thomas, and was
wounded at Chlckamauga. General Swaim
was on mustering duty . at Wilmington,
Del., and was assistant adjutant-general
of the Department of Missouri till Septem
ber, 1866. He was brevetted major, lieu
tenant colonel and colonel for meritorious
services in the late war and became Judge
Advocategenefal In 1881, which position he
held until 1884, when he was court-martialed
and supended for ten years.
Probably lie u Quorum.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. So few members
of either house of Congress wer to be
found in Washington last week that there
was a seemingly well-founded apprehension
that both the Senate and House might find
themselves without quorums and be unable
to accomplish any business, in the first
week of the session. The hotel registers
to-day Fhow that there will be a quorum
of members of both houses in their seats
to listen to the President's message to
morrow. Senators and Representatives have
been brought to the city on every train ar
riving Saturday and Sunday. To-night they
are flocking in like schoolboys on the day
before a term, and the hotel corridors are
filled with politicians and talk of politics
as they have not been since last August.
Senator Walthall Recovered.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Representative
Catching3, of Mississippi, says that Gen
eral Walthall, who resigned the senator
ship from Mississippi which expires March
3, 1895, but who was elected for the suc
ceeding six years, will probably take his
seat. He has recovered his health, the
condition of which was the cause of his
resignation last spring.
