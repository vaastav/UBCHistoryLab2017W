AEeview of Oar Domestio ani Foreign
Eolations and of Our More

The President Expresses His Sense
of Obligation to All Parties

Washinoto, D. C, December L
To the VonjrriM vfthr, United State:
Since the close of vour last session the
American people In the exercise of their
liltrlipt rlirht of giiffriiire have chosen thelt
Chief MnuistrHte fortlio four.'years ensulnti.
When It Is remembered that at no period In the
country's history has tho lonar political con-
teft winch customarily precedes t lie nay oi me
National election been waged with Krcater
fervor nml Intensity, it Is a subject of con
gratulation that after the controversy at the
poiiH was over, nmi wnue tne hiik'ii prepon
derance bv which the Issue had been deter
mined was us yet unascertained, the publia
peace sunerea no (iisttiorance, Dili ine peo
ple every where pntlently ami quietly await
ed the result. Nothing could more striking
ly illustrate tho temper of the American eitl-
ten, his love of order, and his loyalty to law.
Nothing could more siaiially demonstrate
the strength and wisdom ot our political In
stitutions. TUB ELECTORAL VOTE.
Klsht rears have tmssed since a con
troversy concerning tho result of a National
election snnrpiy caned tne attention oi t on
(tress to the necessity of providing more
ueilnlte regulations for the counting of the
electoral vote.
It Is of the gravest Importance thnt this
tjuestlon be solved before conlllctlng claims
to the Presidency shall again distress tho
country, and I am persuaded that by tho
people at large any of the measures of relief
i mis tar proposed would be preterreu to con
tlnued inaction.
KOHEIOW RELATION-.
Our relations with all foreign powers con
tlnne to bo amicable. With iiclgiuin a con
ventlon has been signed whereby tho scope
of the present treaties has been so enlarged
as to secure to the citizens of either country
within tho Jurisdiction of tho other equal
rights and privileges. In the acquisition and
alienation oi property a trade inarK treaty
has also been concluded. Tho war between
Chill and 1'eru Is at an end. For the arbitra
tlon of the claims of American citizens.whn,
during Its continuance, suttoreu through tne
acts of theC'hilian authorities, a convention
will soon be negotiated.
CHINA.
Tho state of hostilities between France and
China continues to bo an emburrasslng
feature of our Kastem relations. The Chinese
Government has promptly adjusted and paid
the claims of American citizens, whose prop
erty was destroyed in the recent riots at
Canton. I ronow the recommendation of my
last annual message, that the Canton In
demnity fund be returned to China. The
true intemretatinn of the recent treaty with
that country, permitting the restriction of
Chinese Immigration, Is likely to be ugaln
the subject of your deliberations. It may bo
passed at the last session does not violate
tho treaty rights of certain Chinese who left
mis country witn return certincates vanu
under tho old law and now seem to be de
barred from landing lrom luck of certlllcates
renuired hv the new. The recent purchase
by tho United States of a largo trading fleet
neretororo under tne t inneso nag nas con
slderably enhanced our commercial lm
Dortunce In the East. In view of
the large number of vessels built
or purchased by , American citizens in
other countries and exclusively employed in
legitimate traftio between foreign ports un
der the recognized protection of our Hag, It
might be well to provide a uniform rate for
their registration and documentation, so that
the bona tide property rights of our citizens
therein shall be duly evidenced and properly
guarueu.
THE CONOO COUNTRY.
Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the
last session. I recognized the Hag of the In
ternational Association of the Congo as that
of a friendly Government, nvoiding in so do
ing anv prejudgment of conflict. In the ter
ritorial claims in that region subsequently,
in execution of the expressed wish of Con
press, I appointed a commercial agent for
the Congo basin. The importance ot the rich
prospective trade of the Congo Valley has led
to a general conviction that It should he
open to all nations upon eqnul terms. Au
International Conlereneo for tho considera
tion of this subject was called by the huipur
or of tiennanv. and Is now In session at Her
lm. Delegates are lu attendance ou behalf
of the I nited States. Of tho results of the
conference, you will bo duly advised.
I.KOATION I'llKMlSKS IV THE EAST.
The Government of Corea nas generously
aided the efforts of the I'nited states Minis
ter to secure suitable premises for tho use of
the legation. Aspiie conditions oi mo uipio
inatic intercourse with the Kust
era nations demand it hut the legation
premises bo owned by tlio repre
seated power, I advise that an appropriation
bo made for the acquisition of this property
bv the Government. Tho I'nited Slates al
ready possesses valuable premises at Tan
giers as a gilt from the Miltan of Morocco. As
Is stated hereafter, they have lately received
a similar gift lrom the Siamese Government.
The Government of Japan stands ready to
sell to us extensive grounds at Tnklo where
in to erect a suitable building for the lega
tion. Court-house and Jail ; and similar priv
lieges can probably b secured lu China and
Persia. The ow ning of such premises would
not only affect a large saving of present
rentals, out would permit oi tne due asser
tion of extraterritorial rights In these coun
tries, and would the bi tter servo to maintain
the dignity of tne I. nited States.
KUYI'T.
Tho failure of Congress to make an appro
prltitlon lor our representative at tiioAuiou
onions Court of tne Khedive has proved a
serious embarrassment lu our intercourse
with F.gvnt : and in view of the necessary iu
tlmacy oi the diplomatic relationship due to
the participation of this Government as one
of tho treaty powers in all matters of admin
Istration there affecting the rights of for
eigners, 1 advise the restoration of the agency
and Consul-General at Cairo on Its former
basis. 1 do not conceive it to be the w Ish of
Congress that tho I'nited states should with
draw altogether from the honorable position
they have hitherto held with respect to tho
Jvhedlvo, or tluil citizens or tins Kepuono re
siding or sojourning in Kgypt should hereaf
ter be without the aid and protection ot a
competent representative.
TUB IIAUTllllLIiI STATUE.
With France the traditional cordial rela
tionshlp continues. The llartholdl statue ot
Liberty enlightening tho world, the generous
ifltt of tho neoido of France. Is expected to
reach New York in May next. 1 suggest that
Congressional action betaken in relation to
the spirit which has prompted this gift, and
In aid of the timely completion of the pedes
tal upou which it is to no piaceu.
(iKHMANY.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of the
best elements of citizenship, continues to
be cordial. The I nited slates have ex
tradition treuties with several of tho Ger
man states, hut by reason oi the con
federation of theso States under the lin
rierlul rule, the application of such treu
ties Is not us uuilorm and comprehen
sive as the Interests of the, two countries
require. I propone, therefore, to open no
crotiations for a single convention of ex
tradition to cmhrauu all the territory of the
implre.
