The Message In a ul Shell.
We do not know how many of cur reader
will find fault with us for not publishing
President Grant'.- first annual message in
full, but having failed, fr rossona already
given, to lay it before our reader ht3t week,
we do not deem it advisable now. after so
many ol our local cotensporanes have pub
lished it, to devote the requisite space to that
purpose. Hence we fly to th other extreme,
and give,the following brief Fynopsis of the
President's Message as we find it furnished
liy the Baltimore Gazette:
President Grant, in his annual message,
expresses the pmfoundest eratitude for things
generally, and states that though the -rforts
i-f Congress have not been a succt)Sfiil as
desirable, stiil they were quite as much tu
c? could reasonably have been anticir attd.
Recommends that Georgia (which has not
adopted the Fifteenth Amendment) be re
conducted so as to turn out white delates
ami replace them by blacks, who were ille
gally elected.
That Virginia, having done all that was
required, be admitted.
That an immediate resumption, if practi
cable, is not desirable, and that fluctuations
in gold he stopped by authorizing the Treas
ury to enlarge its stork opera' ions by re
deeming legal tendrrs for gold, at a fixed
price, and selling them fc;ain if applied for.
That overdue; Government six per cent,
bomls be swapped for four aud a half per
cen'8., if the thirg can be managed.
That as the revenue is already larger than
is needed, and promises to increase, the ex
herbitant tariff not be interfered with hr the
j-.-seut.
That for the same reason, the Income Tax
at three per cent, be continued for three
j par longer.
Th.it the dignity of the office of Cornmis
iouer of Internal Revenue bo made coin
tuenhurate with the importance of the gen-t'eo-
an who fills it.
That although this Government sympa
thizes with Cuba, belligerent rights can net
be accorded to the Calans until the contest
warracts it.
That an intcr-cceatdc canal be built at
Darien, if it cau bo done by private snter
r.rise. That as he did not feel authorized to de
tain the Spanish gunboats, Le tied them up
iu law courts.
That the Alabama questions be pett'ed
Boon as England appreciates the gravity
of their character and removes the sotii'e of
i.bfr iondlint.-s to this couutry it.anift.etcd
during its struggle for existence.
That for tlie purpose of cultivating our
relations with China, the importation of
Chinese coolies he prohibited.
That to enable us to fulfill our obligations,
the whole public debt 4:cu!d be declared
pavabta in coin.
That as the Ter ure-nf Office c uld not
I ave beeu intended to euibaras the Presi
dent, it had better be repealed.
That to quiet the Indiana, uhom he calls
the nation's wards, and prevent strife, all
the tribes be exiled to remote reservations.
That as the frankinsr privilege is simply
an abuse, it be repealed.
The Message then compliments the mu
nificence of Congress, recommends libetal
appropriations to the Agricultural Bureau
and increased pay to the Judges of the Su
preme Court. It allude gracefully to the
patriotism and statemauship of members of
Gwg'ess. wisely, however, abstaining from
the mention of particular names, and closes
with a promise of rieid adherence to a strict
enforcement of all laws, ibcludiog arasbd
toeuts no doubt.
A Model Pjklor Magazikf. For beau
ty of typography, artistic engravings, and
high-toned literary articles, together with a
large and leautiful display rf tha Fashions,
Donioreat's Monthly Magazine is certainly
unsurpassed. The January number. jtiit
received, ia addition to unusual holiday at
tractions, has a fine steal portrait of both
Mr. and Mrue. Deforest. The rich display
of novelties offered in Demorest's Monthly
would seem to be enough to secure a circu
lation scfiicient to satisfy its publishers, but
in additioa we sie they propose to give a
very large and fine enravin to each sub
scriber, valued at $10. The Engraving
elone would make a very approdriate Holi
day or Birthday Gift ; but when added to
the costiy picture the best Parlor Magazine
is includt d, to be a monthly reminder of the
fjieudly feeling of the tiver, there is cer
tainly no better way of invesring $3. Ad

Thb editor of the Houston (Texas) Times
hasn't a very exalted opinion of the politi
cal affair o! that unreconstructed State. He
begins an article iu his paper of the SOih

The election ccmn.enccs to day. An enor
mous raven, more terrible than I'oo's.spreads
its dark and foreboding wings over the land.
The black snake winds its pitkenins coil
around the white dove. Ciuca.sia and Etho
pia embrace at the Suez of madness. The
lovely goddess who represents the sreinus
sn.! purity of the white race is to s offer rape
by a hidt-ous monster, forced up from the
""d.ttk Plutonian shore." The -child of the
tun" that perched on the American banner
in days of yore is gone to Feme far distant
ciWT. and a foul buzzard pukes iu its place.

WHO ABE THEBS ASH WHAT 13 TO BE DONE.
We find the f Uowin in the Lancaster
luielltgrncer of Friday last, but from whence
copied does not appear. We deem it of
ri'.fficient importance to transfer to our col
umns, and have no doubt that it will prove
interesting to all classer of our readers :
The General Council of the Catholic
Church commenced its session on Wednesday
the Feast of the Immaculate! Concept:on.
No similar convocation of the higher prelates
and fthers of the Church hns taken place
since tho Council of Trent, three hundred
vers ago. and it is therefore an event of
he .greatest importance, not only to Roman
Catholics, but to the inhabitants of the whole
world.
The dtholio hierarchv has often fn'std
the admiration of msnv who were strangers
or pven opponents to t Catho'ic creed. It
is the on'v monarchy am n; the er"t r"
liiiioiip orcjan'zations of the world. Nt'tthrr
t he Grei K c! tirrh, nor a single on of the
Protectant btxlit-s. i or Judaism. norTlfoham
c'antrm, ror any other nop .Ph-i ri forni
of le1:?f has a mnjjvbal head. T e pres
ent Pope. Pins IX.. wa born on Mv 73.
1792. and is ther.f yp now in hij T8'h vear.
In tl.P list of bi.-hops of Jl ime. as is eiven in
the "ffictal Ppal Almpnac. h is accounted
the 2oth." L'ke all of his predecessors Jnr
irg the last 300 years, he is an Italinn by
birth ; the last non-Italian Pope having Iwn
Adrian II.. who was a Hollander, and dif-d
In 1523. Of all the bishop of Rome only
49 were non-Italians, and of the 13 were
Frenchmen. 7 Gernmn, and 2 .Spaniards.
The Pontificate of Plus IX. is one of the
hujet on record. Having been elected on
the 16;h of Junf. 1849. he hss'occupiod the
Papal chair for 23 years and s.'x months. It
is a well known legend tl e correctness of
which, however, oven moft of the Ci'holic
Church historians are not willing to defend
that St. Peter was Biihop of the R 'man
congregation for fu'l 25 years, and with this
legem., common expctathn has connected
it:elf, that no following Pore will occupy
the apostolical ( hair en qual length of time,
until the last Pope, undr whose pontificate
this world will come to an end. Certain it
is that no Pope, so far as documentary his
tory has beeu traced, has ruled for 25 years.
Oidy two have exceeded the length of the
pontificate of the present Pope, namely 5
Pius VI. .-who d:ed in 1779, after a pontifi
tvite of 24 years aud 8 months, and in the
earlier hi.-tory of the Church. Silvester I.,
whr.e pontificate extended to 23 yea- and
10 months. The Pontificate of Pins IX has
been agitated by grreat 6trrrus which more
than once have threatened to sweep away
the whole of the Temporal Power. At the
sitne time, however, the borders (if the
church have been greatly enlarged, and i!s
organizations in many countries consolida
ted. No fewer than 116 new dioceses, or
about one seventh of the tetal number of
Catholic dioceses, have been established by
the present Pope.
The Pope is assisted in the government of
the Church by the College of Cardinals,
which consi.-ts of seventy members nhw
full, but there are sevcr.il vacant hats at
present, which will probably he filled this
winter. The bst known members of the
Holy College, are Luoien B-naparte. a cous
in of the Freuch Emperor; Prince Schwarz
enburg. Archbishop of Spracue ; Prince
Hoheniohe, a brother of the Prime Minister
of Bavaria: Count Rcisach. who is now one
of the six Cardinal Bishops. Of the other
four Cardinals, Archbishop Bon;dd of Lyons.
Archbishop Rauschcr, of Vienne, and Arch
bishop Oullen, of Dublin, have occupied a
prominent position in the recent history of
ths Church, and are widely known.
There twelve piiucipal Arclibi.-hop3, who
re culled Patriarchs. These rule ovr the
branches of the Church in whole nations and
groups of nations. Under these there are
149 arcUbishops and 723 bishopries, and
a large nutnVer of dioctses m jiartilus, or
without heads, mokiug altogether 931 dio
ceses iu thi' hierarchy.
In the United States we have seen arch-bit-hopric.
held by the following prelates ;
Most Ilt v. Martin J jhn Spalding;. Arch
bishop of Baltimore ; conseciatcd Spt. 10.
1819 ; formerly Bishop of Louisville ; trans
ferred to Baltimore May C. 18G4.
Mt llev. John B Purrell. Archbishop
of Cincinnati; consecrated October 13, 1833
Mot Rev. Johu M. O lin, Archbishop of
New Orleans ; consecrated March 6, 1842 ;
transferred to New Orleans iu 18C1.
M st Rev. John McClokey, Archbishop
of New York ; consecrated M itch 10. 1844 ;
transferred to New York. May 6, ltt4.
Most Rev. Francis N. B'.anchet. Archbish
op of Oregon ; conaocrnte'd July 23. 1815.
Most Rev. Peter B. Kenritk. Archbhhop
of St. Louis; consecrated Nov. 30, 1841.
Most Rev. Joseph i5. Alemeny, Archbish
op of Sanfrancisco ; consecrated June 10,
1S50; transferred to San Francisco, July
23. 1853.
Under these thre are forty-six suffragan
bishoprics, one of which is over Philadelphia,
and too Right R' v. James Frederick Wood
is the Poshop. This gentleman and Bishop
Bailev, of Newatk, N. J., are converts from
the Protestant faith.
Besides Cardinals. Patriarchs, Archbish
ops, and Bishops, also the Generals of Mon
astic Orders and the mitred Abbotts have a
right of admission to the Council. Accord
ing to a recent statement made by the Pon
tificate Chamberlain, there are 29 Abbotts
and 22 Generals of Orders. Hardly any
of them has a literary name; hardly any. we
believe (txcept. perhaps. Father Becks, the
General of t tie Jesuits;, will be better known,
even in Europe, than Father Ileckcr, the
Superior of the Am.etican PatiHsts. But,
though well known, these Generals repre
sent a considerable army. Religious orders
of both men and women are again making
rapid p impress. Iu the United States, in
England, in all the States of Germany (es
pecially in Prussia) in Fiance the number
of monasteries is increasing with great celer
ity. The Fraucisians again claim 50.000
members, the Dominicans, 4,000; the Jesu
its. 8.200; the Carmelites, 4,000; the Trap
ists, 4.000 ; the Lazarists, 2.000 ; the Par
Uts. 2 000 ; the Rei'.emptorists, 2,000 ; the
female ord-rs together, 190 090.
This council is called the First Council of
the Yatician, and will pass into history as
the twenty first GE-umenical Council of tho
Church, counting from the first held at Nice
in the year 325 to the last Council of Tint.
