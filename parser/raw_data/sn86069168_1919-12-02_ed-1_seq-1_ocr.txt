The strike of ;the miners of
soft coals, who have been idle for
the past month has brought on
conditions like those prevailing
during the war, in many sections,

production of bituminous coal in
quantities sufficient . to permit
maintamence of present vShm re

READJUSTMENT OF
NATION TO PEACE BASIS
h ''t' ' V. ...-.-, - - ?';' y . :
Is Stirring Message of President
Wilson To Congress Peace
. Treaty To Come Later
(bV Aseoclated Press)
Washington, Dec. . 2 General
recommendations , on legislation
to combat thehigh Cot of living,
radicalism and readjustment of
the nation ito a'peace time basis,
were features of President Wil
son's message to Congress,.today.
The peace treaty and the railroad
question will be discussed in a la
ter separate message.' , ,
The President's principal re
commendations are the establish-'
ment of a budget system for na- j
tional finances; reorganization of
the taxation system with simplifi
cation of income and excess pro
fits; readjustment of, the tariff
system, if necessary, to meet the
changed world conditions and
make the' system conform with
the fact that the United States is
the "greatest . capitalist in the
world;" recognition and relief for
veteran soldiers of the world war
particularly, in the way of govern
ment farms as proposed by Sec
retary Lane ; prqper methods to
foster the dyestuffs industry to
keep the United States independ
ent of Foreign supply ; enlarged
program for rural development in
recognition of the farmers' part
in the war, and measures which
"will remove causes of political
restlessness in our body politic."
,At this points the ' President
made his most extensive refer
ence to the- peace treaty, saying
the causes for unrest "are super
ficial rather than deep seated" ,
and that they "arise from or are
connected with failure on the part
of the government to arrive
speedily at a just and permanent
peace, permitting the , return to
normal conditions from transfu
sion' or. radical , theories .. from
seething European centers, pend
ing such delay from heartless
profiteering from the machina
tions of passionate and malevol
ent agitators, and with the return
to normal conditions this unrest
will rapidly disappear., '
The President renewed recom
mendations for legislation to deal
effectively with "those persons
who by violent methods would
abrogate our time-tested institu
tions." - i ,
-' Several recommendations were
made to cut the cost of living, in
cluding extension of the food con
trol law Ho a, peace time emer
gency; cold storage law and law
to secure ""competitive selling and
prevent unconscionable profits
"by federal license v of corpora
tions selling food in interstate
commerce.
A long portion of the message
was devoted to discussion of con
ditions and rights of labor. "A
definite program to bring about
improvement in conditions of la
bor and genuine democratization
of industry" were recommended
'" "The only.wayo keep men
from agitating against grievances
is to remove the grievances," the
message said. At another point
it declared the "seed of revolution
is present" and asserts .that the
League ( of nations principles of
fers the only way to industrial
pertce and conciliation. ' No oth
er road is open to us. , .
The message declares "collec
tive bargaining is humane and la
bor must not be treated as a com
modity.". "The right of individ
uals to strike is inviolate' the
message says, "and ought not to
be interf erred with by any pro
cess of government, but there is a
predominant right and that is the
right of government to protect
all its people and assert its power
rfrld majesty against the challenge
of any clas9." i This was refer
ring to the recent coal strike in
junction. f , j ' '. ,
The message closed with point
ed reference to radicalism and red
doctrines, and referred Jto Russia
today; with' Its "bViod and terror"
as. painful object lessons of power
bf'minorities. ;
, : "Orderly processes," the mes
sage declared ,'is the only way to
obtain relief and reform; any oth
er, method is enemy mothed. Let
those beware who take any short-j
er road of disorder and . revolu-
tion.

mail from London to Bombay.

ALL READY FOR A
OPENING TOMORROW
Tobacco Men At Lexington To-'.
day Watching Prices At
First Sales Of Season ; -
. Everything is in readiness for the
opening of the. Richmond tobacco
market Wednesday- morning. The
floors of both warehouses are well fill?
ed with, weed, and it all looks good..
The' first weed in this season is said
to grade better than is usually the
case with first offerings. ,
Many Madison county tobacco men;
in fact, tobacco men from all over
the' Blue Grass markets are in Lex
ington today to witness the opening
of the markets there, and get a line
on prices that will be paid. Predic
tions are freely made that the mar
ket is going to start off high
er this year than for many seasons.
The prices that have been paid ' by
pinhookers and other in advance of
the regular market' opening, indi .
cates that there is a feeling in the air
that prices are going to be way up.
The Big, Four will have regular
buyers on the breaks here at Rich
mond, and at Lancaster too, which is
also expecting a big opening. There
will be several new faces on the
local breaks. . Wearen Kennedy suc
ceeds Earl Curtis as buyer here for
the Liggett & Myers. , W. P. Kincaid
will buy here again for the J. P.
Taylor Company, and W. P. July for
R. J. Reynolds.-. So far the names of
the buyers who will be stationed at
Lancaster, have not been learned with
one exception. H. L. Soper, of Har
rodsburg, who is a brother-in-law- of
Senator A. O. Stanley, will buy there
for the J. P. Taylor Company.
Both Richmond warehouses have
well organized staffs-; and are all
ready to get the high dollar for their
patrons. It is understood that Che-.
Liiault Duncan and J. B. Walker will
be solicitor, here for the Home House,
while Percy Reid, has secured a leave
of absence from his. automobile,,
duties, to solicit for the Madison
House.
CANTRILL PREDICTS
RECORD WEED PRICE
On the eve of the opening of the
Burley tobacco market Jn Kentucky' !
Congressman J.. C. Cantrill gave out ;
a statement in which he says 'that
'from every reasonable standpoint the'1
price of tobacco this' year of the
Burley type should break, all previous '
records." ",' ' ' ' '
His statement, no doubt, will have '
a tendency to "bull" the market, as he
is the best known recognized authori-
ty on Burley tobacco. "It is1 well
known," he' says, "that the crop of
tobacco grown in the year 1918 was
an unusually large crop of Burley to
bacco and yet on October 1, 1919, the
stocks in the hands of the dealers
and manufacturers were practically
the same as the average amount
during the past eight years. It is
also well known to every one con- .,
versant with .conditions in the Bur-,
ley tobacco district, that the crop'
grown this year is an unusually short
crop of tobacco and applying the
law of supply and demand there is
every reason to believe that there
will be an unusual demand for the
crop of tobacco which will go on to
the market very shortly and there is ;
every reason why, owing to the
scarcity of Burley tobacco and the
stocks in the hands of the manu
facturers and dealers the crop which
is to be sold this winter of Burley
tobacco should bring a higher ' price
than ever in the history of the tobac
co market.
TO TOSS COIN
FOR OPENING SALE
The two tobacco Warehouses of
Richmond await the tossing of a
coin tomorrow morning as to
which one has the opening' sale.
The coin will be flipped in the air
just as soon as the buyers are as
sembled, to begin their duties on
the local breaks, and no matter
which one happens to be the win
ner, it will be a busy day, as both
floors are groaning under the
weight of Kentucky's weed.
Frank R. Crome, Johnson Building,
Cincinnati, Ohio, former agent, was
in town, on business court day. He
