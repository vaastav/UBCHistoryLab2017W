THE fact has recently been pointed
out by a Bussian geographer that the
shores of Siberia are not flat and
water-soaked as represented in the
text books, and even on the latest
maps, but on the contrary, are high,
and in many places even hilly. With
the exception of the Obi region and
the deltas of a few rivers, Siberia
meets the Arctic ocean with a bold and
lofty coast line.
GERMAN experiments have succeeded
in producing an alloy of aluminum, the
precise composition of which is not re

many respects to pure aluminum. The
statement is made that this alloy, which

weighs only one-third as much, bulk

can be easily polished and does not tar

COXXECTOBS of antique furniture have
struck a bonanza in Havana. In pre

full-length bevel mirrors, valued at

A new experiment has been tried in
the New York penitentiary on Black
well's island, and so far it has proved
wonderfully successful. A thousand
entertaining and instructive volumes
have been added to the library, and
the prisoners are allowed to read from
5:30 to 9 p. m. The privilege is eagerly
embraced. If a man be rebellious he
is deprived of his respite in the read
ing-room, and as a consequence the
number of insubordinates has dropped
pretty nearly 75 per cent.
A NATIVE mendicant, who has been

Paris, Dec. 12.—The treaty of peace
was signed at 8:45 Saturday evening.
The treaty as signed consists of 17 ar
ticles, it having been found advisable
to subdivide two or three of the articles
in the draft agreed upon at. the last
meeting. The commissioners of the
two nations wrote their signatures on
two copies of the treaty, one copy be
ing for the archives. The document
was prepared by Secretary Moore, in
behalf of the United States commis
sioners, and by Senor Villa Rutia for
Spain, on account of the continued ill
ness of Secretary Ojeda, of the Spanish
commission. Each copy contains the
English and Spanish texts of the treaty
in parallel columns. The wording bnd
been approved previously, by the com
missions without a joint meeting, so
there was no controversy on this sub
ject.
Principal Features.
The essential features of the peace
treaty are as follows:
First—The customary preface of treaties
In the nature of an expression of amity and
of hope for perpetual peace.

her sovereignty over Cuba.

troops.

sovereignty over Porto Rico.
Fifth—Spain's cession of the Philippines
8ixth—The withdrawal of the Spanish
troops there.
Seventh—Payment by the United States
of $20,000,000 for the Philippines.

political prisoners.
Eleventh—Mutual abandoning of all
claims for Indemnity.
President Sends Consraialatlona.
Washington, Dec. 12.—The officin!
news of the signing of the peace treaty
was received in Washington a little
later than the press reports. It was
cipher form, as usual, from Judge Daj.
It was at once transmitted to the pres
ident, who was alone at the time, but
within a comparatively short time all
the members of the cabinet had either
called or sent their congratulations.
The president's congratulations were
promptly cabled to the commission.
The news of the signing had been so
thoroughly discounted that the actual
receipt of the official advices created
little stir here. There was a general
feeling of relief, however, that no un
foreseen circumstance intervened at
the last moment to block the peaceful
close of the negotiations.
Expenses of the Commission.
The following figures give the esti
mated expenses incurred by the Amer
ican members of the peace commission,
now spending their seventy-first day in
Paris, up to this time:
Salaries of commissioners, (90,000: salary
of secretary, (10,000 compensation of inter
preters, legal advisers, etc., $20,000 steam
ship passage for party, $5,000 hotel accom
modations, $10,400 personal expenses of
party. Incidentals, etc., $15,000 services of
special employes, $10,000. Total. $100,000.
The American peace commission is
composed of five members, a secretary,
a score or more translators, type
writers, stenographers and a retinue of
servants. In all, 32 persons were in the
party.
Protest Approved.
Madrid, Dec. 12.—The government
entirely approves the memorandum of
protest against the action of the United
States commissioners filed by Senor
Montero Bios at Paris.
The memorandum protests against
the refusal of the Americans to surren
der the securities deposited in the
treasuries of Cuba and Porto Rico by
private Spaniards, remarking thai
"never hps a civilized nation commit
ted such an act of violence."
Secondly, it protests against the ulti
matum demanding the Philippines.
Thirdly, it protests against the posi
tion in which those Spaniards are
placed who desire to remain in Cuba.
Fourthly, it protests against the ref
erence to the destruction of the Maine
In President McKinley's message to the
United States congress. On this point
the memorandum says:
"Spain has proposed arbitration but the
United States refuses to give her the right
which Is granted to a criminal, namely, the
right of defending herself. The Spanish
commissioners leave the care of fixing the
responsibility for the explosion to the en
tire world, which will say whether those
are responsible who desire the truth or
those refusing to seek It"

$827,588,124.80. There was consequently a de
crease of $89,038,869,60 In the general treas
ury balance, which stood at $884,790,237.71
at the opening of the year and at $776,751,
368.11 at the close. Besides the ordinary rev
enues there were receipts on-account ot
the public debt which sweUed the total
Income available in the fiscal operation ol
the government to $481,612,255.20, while cor
responding additions, to the ordinary ex
penditures brought the total on this side
of the account up to $543,561,104:80,' and cre
ated a deficiency of $0,948,849.60 as the net
result These figures, however, do not In
clude any p^rt of the loan of $200,000,000, the,
proceeds of which had begun, to cpms in
before the close of the year,, though 'notae
were formaUy covered into .the treasury^ "5

realized from the sale of the Union Faciflo
and Kansas Pacific railroads, while, in

"A better view of the results

fiscal operations is afforded by the changeS' i*
in the assets of the treasury. The total

"The amount of fractional silver coin
held by the treasury July 1 1897, was $16,-.,
201,960 July 1, 1898, $12,070,690. This stock1
has at present. November 18, been reduced
to $7,122,506, much of which is so worn as
to be unfit for circulation. The amount.
available, distributed among the several.
subtreasurles, gives but small stock to"
each, and some denominations are ex
hausted. The secretary of the treasury
should be authorised to recoln this uncur
rent, stock, and any such coin which may
hereafter accumulate in the treasury the
difference between Its face value and the A
new coin It will make to be paid out of
any moneys In the treasury not otherwise
appropriated. Further provision should ba
made to add to the stock of fractional coin,.
and to that end It Is suggested that the
secretary of the treasury be authorized to
use any silver bullion now In the treasury
for the coinage of such denominations as
may be required from time to time to
meet the demand from the different sec
tlons of the country. With an ever-In
creasing population, which will be added
to in the near future by the acquisition of
additional territory, the demand for frac
tional silver coin will be such as to make
It essentially necessary that the stock
should be increased."
BUSINESS OUTLOOK.
Increased Activity Is Reported, Oe
mind la All Lines Is Growing and
No Feellaa of Uneasiness Exists.
New York, Dec. 10.—R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade says: "The most^JI^
significant thing this week has been theSif
entire absence of the customary nervous
fright before or after the meeting of con
gress, the president's message and the^s
treasurer's report. No one showed ther^|j
least alarm, and nobody could find a rea-^ 5'^
son for any. Money and stock and grain ..
markets moved on exactly as if the gov-'-wv.^,
crnment were automatic, certain to do or^|^
say no more than the people had already de-^|
cided and expected, and so the gradual bet-^fe,.-:
terment since October continues. There is:'.v\f.
a larger demand for products In nearly aUif^p
the great industries, larger export demand$|i||
for foreign needs, a more healthy domestic^M
demand since seasonable weather arrived,^# :,
and a comforting conviction that N«v«m-H
ber business, the biggest ever done In thiss',%
country in any month, was but a s'tepSi&i
toward something better.
"Exports last year in December were^Sf^ J'
marvelous, but this year are starting farS^i1'
ahead. The Atlantic wheat exports, flour
included, have been for the week 5,636,767
bushels, against 4,312.137 last year, and Pa-!!ii
ciflc exports 556,523 bushels, against 973,083
last year, and prices have Reclined 2% W.
cents for cash, but western receipts of 10,
135,169 bushels, against 6,213,471 from last^l^
year's great crop stops argument. Th#^j|$
wheat does not come out at low prices ifil^s.
the people have less to sell than last year|Sp
at 20 cents more per bushel. So the corn
exports were 4,161,981, against 3,313,086 last
year, and such a foreign demand at prices
much higher than last year and with wheal
cheaper, is proof of a state of things abroad
which Americans hardly appreciate. The
price declined only one-fourth cent with
enormous Receipts.
"This week's failures have been 248 In the
United States, against 312 last year, and 21
in Canada, against 29 last year."
