ST. PETERSBURG, Deo. 1 Secretary
Toft an4 party arrived today from Mos
cow. They wer mat by a deputation of
officers representing the minister of war,
th military governor and other officials of
Bt. Petersburg. Among- those at the sta
tion were Count Konltz, who has been ap
pointed imperial aid to Secretary Taft dur
ing his stay in St. Petersburg. The party
took tip their quarters in the hotel De
L'Europc. .
Immediately after his arrival at the hotot
the secretary accompanied by Brigadier
General Clarence R. Edwards, Montgomery
Schuyler, Jr., the American charge d'af
faires, and Captain 8. L, ILiSlocum. tho
American military attache at Bt. Peters
burg; started on a tour of official calls.
He went first to see Foreign Minister Is-wolsky-
and General Rudlger, the minister
of war and then called upon the grand
dukes who are ' at present living here.
. These Induce Nicholas Nlcholalevltch,
Alexander Mlchealovitch, and half a dozen
others. '
The carriages of the American embassy,
with their liveried servants, In which the
secretary drove while ' paying his calls,
were recognized everywhere. Crowds gath
ered In spite of the threatening weather
and "General Taft," as the secretary has
come to be called here, was cheered again
and again.
Party Visits Daaaa.
Secretary Taft and the members of his
suite visited the duma at a late Tiour today.
Baron Ostensuchen met the party at the
portico of the palace and conducted them
to on of the Imperial boxes directly oppo
site ths speaker. Premier Stolypln, Minis
ter of War Rudlger and other members of
the cabinet were In their places. Several
diplomats who formerly had been stationed
In Washington, entered the box to pay
their respect to the secretary.
Blr pons Id M&cKensle Wallace, the au
thor, who opportunely .was present In the
palace, joined Secretary Tart's party aad
Acted as Interpreter of the speeches. He
pointed out tlW the leading .members, of
. the duma. Secretary Taft was Impressed
with the SDaclousness and mamlflcence of
the chamber, which was brilliantly Illuminated-
Curing Mr. T art's stay M. Bhubin
sky, an pctobertat; M. Tymaha, a Pole, and
an Armenian social democrat, took turns in
speaking. The session was not markud
by any special incident.
The news of ths presence pf Secretary
Taft in the chamber spread quickly until
finally the attention of practically every
body In the house, members of the minis
try, senators, diplomatists, newspaper cor
respondents and deputies was centered on
the imperial bos.
- The secretary .and his party stayed for
half an hour and then took their departure.
Visit Gives Rise ta Ramor.
Owing to the extraordinary rumors In cir
culation here regarding the nature of his
mission the visit of Mr. Taft has aroused
the liveliest interest and curiosity. The
Roast a, the official organ of the govern
ment, however, makes an effort to correct
these wrong Impressions. In a leading ar
ticle extending to Secretary Taft an "open
door Russian welcome," the paper says:
"The high position and personal merits
of Secretary Taft explain the heartiness
or his reeeptlon and the honor of an audi
ence of the emperor; but It la a mistake to
suppose that Mr. Taft1 visit is In any way
connected with a change In the Interna
tional policy of Russia, There Is not a word
of truth In the rumors that we are to give
base for an American fleet at Vladivostok
or any other Pacing port; but the visit ot
Secretary Taft will renew and strengthen
the eld bonds of sympathy between Russia
and America.
All the other newspapers devote space
to welcoming Secretary Taft, and the tone
of each and every one is of unmixed friend
liness. Mr. Tart la expected tp allude to
the rumors in a speech h will make at
the banquet to be given him by ths mem
bers of the American colony of this city,
and he will then give the American denial.
The empress of Russia is Indisposed and
she probably will not be able to receive
Mr. Taft tomorrow, consequently the sec
retary will go to Tsarskoe Selo alone.
Tomorrow evening the secretary wtll at'
ton a banquet at Foreign Minister Iswol
skya residence, which will be followed by
a big reception of the dlplomatlo corps
gnd .Russian offiotal society.

to go to Doulogns to catch the sUj ner

Mrs. Taft, accompanied by Mrs. George
Post Wheeler, wife of the seoond secre
tary of the American embassy at Toklo,
will go from here to Vienna and Parla
She will return to the United State sev
eral weeks after her husband.
When questioned regarding the presi
dential situation in the United States
Secretary Taft requested to be excused
from expressing any opinion. He said he
had announced a year ago his readiness
to asuept the nomination In case it was
given to him and that his attitude had
not changed since.
Brief Step la Berlin.
BERLIN. Deo. I. Ambassador Power has
arranged through the foreign office that a
special oar be placed at the disposition of
Secretary Taft and his party when they
reach ths station on the frontier between
Russia and Germany. According to the

changed, the train which will bring the
Taft oar from the frontier will arrive at

CAPTAIN PALMER nOSORED
Elected Vice President of Boad of
Managers of Soldiers' Homes.
GAMBLE-JU'lTULDGE WAS ACUTE
Nebraska Senators Also Have aa lTs.
settled Difference to Settle Over
Colleetorakln of Internal R ev
en for Tkia District.
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. S. (Special Tele
gram.) Captain H. R Palmer was today
unanimously elected second vice president
of the Board of Managers of the National
Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. Cap
tain Palmer arrived in Washington lant
night, having come east with Mr. aud
Mrs. Victor Rosewater, who are now In
Baltimore. Postmaster Palmer wtll remain
In Washington lo attend the Rivers and
Harbors convention.
The armed neutrality which character
ized the relationship yesterday between
Senators Gambia and Ktttredge of South
Dakota was rudely shattered today when
nominations for position in the federal
service In that state were sent to the sen
ate by the president for confirmation. The
name of B. H Wagner, who Is now serving
as United States district attorney through
a recess appointment, was not Included In
the list, and thereupon there was blood in
Senator Gamble's eye, who sow In this
failure a covert attempt on the part of his
colleague to thwart confirmation. It has
been vaguely hinted for some time past
that Senator Ktttredge would not permit
the confirmation of Wagner without a
fight, notwithstanding that the president
had told Gamble that the appointment 'be
longed to him.
Gamble oa Warpath.
It will be recalled tha the White House
for a little while last week was trans
formed Into a lottery rendezvous, with the
president at the wheel of fortune to parcel
out the offices In South Dakota. . In nearly
every Instance Senator Klttiidge won the
call for first choice. The president saw
the uselessness of attempting to get the
two senators to ogre upon candidates and
he therefore took the only means at hand
to settle upon the nominations long, over
due by having the senators draw straws
or hazard their guess upon the turn of a
coin. At the time the drawing took place
It Is stated the district attorneyship mat
ter was gone over and an explanation given
that the place belonged to Senator Gam
ble. At least the attorneyship did not fig
ure in the matter and Senator Gamble
left the White House believing that Mr.
Wagner's name would be sent in with the
rest of those whom he had selected to fill
various positions, together with the other
elections of the senator, and that the
nominations should stand or fall together.
The failure, however, to send to the senate
the name of Mr. Wagner ha suggested
a possibility of a fight and Senator Gamble
has his war paint on to prevent tha con
tlrmatlon of anyone unless a hard and fast
agreement is mad that when Mr. Waff-.
ner's nam does com to the senate It will
be treated wlCA the consideration that he
thinks It deserves. All of which would In
dicate that a long drawn out contest munt
necessarily result over the nomination
which the president sent to congress today
as the choice of the senators from South
Dakota. Senator' Klttridge has selected
Thomas C. Burns of Mitchell as register
of "the land office at that place, John L.
Burke of Rapid City register of that land
office and Lemuel B. Laughlln receiver of
the land office at Chamberlain, all these
being reappointments. Senator Gamble's
recommendations were: Dr. E. B. Alford
for surveyor general, B. D. Kribs register
of the United States land office at Aber
deen, W. H. Irons register of the land
office at Chamberlain and Myron Wlllsle
receiver of the land office at Rapid City.
Contest for Collectorshlp.
In view of the disagreement between
Benatera Burkett and Brown over the col
lectorshlp to suoceed Elmer Stephenson,
who has tendered his resignation to take
effect early In January, it was suggested
by member of the Nebraska delegation
today that if the Iowa Idea for the dis
tribution of pstronsge was good in the
Fifty-ninth congress so far aa its appli
cation went to Nebraska appointments It
would be good In the Sixtieth congress,
and If the whole delegation from Ne
braska was admitted into - a caucus the
successor to Mr. Stephenson bight easily
be selected. The Iowa Idea Is all right
In theory, according to the member above
spoken of, but has little virtue In practice,
the senators relegating to themselves the
right to settle controversies when little
or no pollticK was involved, but called
In the delegation when chestnuts were to
bo p .lied out of the fire. In view of Mr.
Brown's outspoken friendliness to W. B.
Ruse of Lincoln . and Senator Burkett's
equal friendliness for Ross Hammond of
Fremont It will be interesting to watch
the outcome of ths controversy with both
parties equally determined to land his
candidate. It is expected that Governor
Sheldon, when he arrive here, together
with others of the delegation to the
rivers and harbors convention, will take
a hand in the fight and a caucus of re
publican leaders of Nebraska, including
R. B. Schneider, a member of the execu
tive committee ot the national republicau
committee, and Charles IL Morrill, ni
tlonal committeeman from the state, will
be held for the purpose of compromising
on some person satisfactory to both
senators. i
Representative HInshaw of Nebraska
saw the president today. He likewise saw
him yesterday. Also he froze up touuy,
when yesterday he was as rm as the
noon day sun in August.
Hinabaw Mtsnnderstaads President.
Wren Mr. HInshaw pumped the execu
tive arm yesterday he told the president
that all Nebraska was for him and his
policies, wanted him for a third term, and
would not be satisfied with anythlz.g else
or anybody else. To all of which the
president answered:
"I wtll not change a single point of what
I have said."
Mr. HInshaw grieved over what he era
sldered a renewed declaration of the res
ident that he would not accept another
nomination, and on of his newspaper
friends to whom he told the conversa
tion proceeded tu write accordingly. To
rveal inside state secrets la an unpardon
able offense, even in well regulated news
paper men, but It Is sufficient clarification
to say that later in the day Mr. Hlnahaw
got a tip that he had misunderstood the
president; that remark applied wholly to
the queatlon of exeoutlve policies and not
to a third term. Mr. HInshaw called to-
day to explain. He did explain, but no
to the newspaper men. "I haven't a word
to say." he declared a he blushed. H
persisted, despite all inulatenoe, . that the
words would not escape him. And Hln-

WASHINGTON, Dec. S. Ambassador

United States towards ' Japanese Immi

partment, ha rf-ede ' an Investigation of
condition existing not only in California,
Oregon and Washington,-but also in Brit
ish Columbia on the north, upon which he
has based a special report to 'his govern

government In summoning Vlscour.t A."W
to Toklo Is to secure from htm Information
which Baron Ishli could not possibly have
acquired during his short stay In America
regarding the attitude of the administration
here, with particular reference to the
measures which have recently been applied
by the Japanese government to restrict the
departure from Japan for America of the
coolie element. Also the Japanese govern
ment desires a prudent forecast of the like
lihood of congressional action in the direc
tion of legislation providing for the exclu

At the Japanese embassy it is stated that
the ambassador will probably proceed for
Toklo by way of San Francisco or Vic

Shows Methods.
NEW TORK. Dec. 3. Application for the
appointment of a receiver for the Bxoelslor
Fire Insurance company Is about to be
made by Attorney General Jackson, ac
cording to a statement given out by htm
today. The Excelsior was recently organ
ized by Howard Maxwell, William Gow,
John G. Jenkins. Frank W. Doollttle and
others, and was fli.anoed through the Bor
ough and Oriental banks. Maxwell, who
was president of the Borough bank before
the crash of a month ago, killed himself
after he had been ind.cted, following aa
Investigation of the' effatrs of that insti
tution. Gow, who was the principal
stock holder In the Borough bank, is now
under indictment as a result of the same
Investigation described by the attorney
general in his statement as "an Interesting
operation In high finance." He declares
that the company was organised to a con
siderable 'extent on fictitious credits. The
Information upon which the attorney gen
eral will act was laid before him by Super
intendent of Insurance Kelsey. The at
torney general declares that the company's
Incorporation was secured through the fil
ing with the superintendent of Insurance
of what Is charged to be a false report,
and that the full capital stock and sur-'1
plus of $300,000 had not been paid In at
the time as required by statute. Of the

A. F. HATCH PLEADS GUILTY
Follows Example Set by It. W. Mahaf
fey in Land Case.
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FINE
Immediate Payment Saspeaded t
Civ Coavleted Man Cknaea to
Sell HI Cattle at Good
Price.
The example of R. W. Mahaffey tn plead
ing guilty to nonsptrncy in land fraud
transactions seems to be, contagious, and
ks a result, of the epidemic Anthony F,
Hatch, who was indicted at the earn time
by the federal grand Jury for conspiracy,
withdrew his , plea ot not guilty made
Monday afternoon and entered a plea of
guilty to conspiracy Tuesday. Judge T. C.
Munger thereupon sentenced him - to pay
a fine of $300 and stand committed until the
fine Is paid. In view ot the . preseut low
price' of cattle the court was not dlsposod
to be harsh with Mr. Hatch and conse
quently suspended the Immediate payment
of the fine until tjie market conditions were
such as Mr. Hatch might realize from his
cattle without any material sacrifice..
It was at first proposed that Mr. Hatch
should be tried upon the two charges of
conspiracy and perjury, the latter being
based upon his procuring witnesses tn the
rlnal proof, proceedings with certain home
steaders who had mad fraudulent entries
within the Mahaffey enclosure in Hooker
county. Judge II. M. Bullivan of Broken
Bow, attorney for defense, insisted upon a
trial on both Indictments, but the govern
ment sought to consolidate them, as the
evidence was practically the same in both
Indictments. Judge Munger, however, was
disposed to overrule tha motion to consoli
date the Indictments and after a confer
ence with counsel It was decided Hatch
should agree to dlthdraw his plea of not
guilty to conspiracy and enter a plea of
guilty, without the necessity of the case
going to trial. With this understanding
the government nolled the indictment for
perjury and Hatch was sentenced on the
conspiracy charge alone and the perjury
charge was dismissed.
With this conclusion the trial of the land
cases went over until Monday, when the
Perry A. Yeast of Deuel county case will be
taken up. The petit Jury was excused un
til 8 30 a. m. Monday.
Vsratr Take No Chance.
United States Marshal Warner does not
propose to take uny more chances regard
ing tho imprisonment of parties given has
tily sentences In and about Omaha by the
federal courts. In view of the disastrous
results following the six-hour sentence
Imposed on Bartlett Richards and W. O.
Comstock a couple of years a?o, whereby
a lenient construction of the court's orders
accomplished the undoing of a United
States marshal and a United States district
attorney. Consequently when R. W. Ma
haffey was given a Jail sentence of forty-
live days by Judge T. C. Munger Monday
afternoon, the United States marshal could
place no other construction on the sen
tence of the court, and so Mr. Maliaffey
waa plaoed In the Douglas oounty Jail,
pending his removal to Grand Island, where
the sentence will be ultimately carried out.
He was taken to Grand Island Tuesday
afternoon to begin hla sentence.

he went to Gross' store and demanded the
money and alleges that Gross "pulled" a
revolver on him. Kaats hurriedly got out
of range and gi ahbed some other furs as
he rushed out. He says he afterwards re
turned these, but Gross alleged that Kaats
kept a M0 muff, and had him arrested and

HOUSE FINANCIAL COMMITTEE
Speaker Cannon's Announcement
Appointment Caase Bar
prise. of
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dee. I. Tho an
nual message of President Roosevelt wss
read today in both houses of congress, and
practically no business was attempted by
either body beyond listening to the mes
sage. The galleries of both the senate and
house were crowded at the beginning of
the session of each body, but as the read
ing progressed, the attendance diminished
somewhat. In the main, however, It waa
well maintained until the last sentences of
the document had fallrn from the Ilea of
the cmrlKl reader. Senator gnd members
were supplied with printed copies of the
message,, and many of them followed the
reading olerks with scrupulous care. The
eadlng consumed about two and one-quarter
hours In each of the houses.
The house did not today follow' up the
lead of yesterday In the matter of the-Introduction
of many bills, but some meas
ures were presented. In the senate so far
no bills have been Introduced, but there Js
scarcely a senator whose desk Is. not well
oovered with these documents, and it is
proboble that the flood will break out In
that body tomorrow.
Speaker Cannon treated the house to a
surprise In announcing tho membership of
th committee on banking and currency.
This advance formation of that committee
led to the conclusion on the part of many
that it was his Intention to press financial
legislation, but those who are close to the
speaker say that hla only purpose waa to
afford a depository for petitions and letters
bearing upon the currency question. The
membership of the committee was In
creased by ths addition of one democrat,
making seven member of that party on
It, instead of six, as during th fifty-ninth
congress. This is tn accordance with th
request of Minority Loader Williams, but
it is said that It is not to be taken as an
Indication that this request will be com
piled with in all other committees.
The committee retains as Its chairman
Mr. Fowler of New Jersey and in the
main Its personnel was unchanged. There
were only two vacancies on the committee
as it stood last year, one of -these being
caused by the failure of Mr. Shartel (rep.)
of Missouri to seour re-election snd th
other by the voluntary withdrawal of Mr.
Legare or South Carolina, who found the
duties pertaining to his. work on this com
mittee to be In conflict with his service
on other committees. Mr. Burton (rep.. O.)
was designated for Mr. Shatters place and
Mr. Crawford of Nort hCarol'na for Mr.
Legare'a. The additional selection was Mr.
McHenry (dem.) of Pennsylvania. Follow,
lng Is the total membership of the com
mittee as now constituted!

Both the senate and house adjournr-d
almost . immediately after th conclusion
of ths reading of the message. The house
adjourned until Thursday, when It is prob
able that it will again adjourn for the
week.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Owen, tn two gen
tlemen chosen by primary election to rep
resent the new state tf Oklaiioma in thrf
senate, appeared on the floor of the senate
and occupied the stats, set apart for them
for some time, listening to the president s
message. This wag a plain extension of
what is known as senatorial courtesy, In
asmuch aa neither senator ha as yet been
legally lected to serve In th senate.

WASHINGTON, Dec. .-The annual men
sage of the president of- the United States
was received by the senate at 12:13 p. m.
today, and within a mlnut Socretary Ben
nett bad begun the reading of the docu
ment The mesaac was presented to the
senate by the assistant -secretary to th
president, Mr. ' Latta, who had followed
Senators Allison and Teller, the commute
which had made the customary call upon
the president ' We have callnd upon the
president," eald th venerable senator from
1'iwa, standing in the center aisle beetdf" -the
-equally' venerable senator from ' Colo,
rado, In' low And Impressive tones, "and h
Informs us that he will communicate wlti
thaenate In writing Immediately."
A 'message - from the president of th
United States," announced Mr. Latta,
much more distinctly, as the two commit
teemen parted to permit the Introduction 01
the president's representative. The docu
ment was Immediately forwarded to the
desk of the vice president and as soon as
the wrapping could be removed It was laid
beforo the senate.
The secretary read with dellberativeness
and distinctness and was followed closely
by many of the senators, who held printed
copies of the mossage in their hands.
Th message was read In the house with
rlmllar ceremony. It was as follows:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives: ,
No nation has greater resources than
purs, and I think It car. be truthfully said
that the citizens of no nation posses
greater energy and Industrial ability, la
no nation are the fundamental business
conditions sounder thau In ours at thlls
yerj- moment; and It Is foolish, when such
is tij case, for people lo hoard money In
stead of keeping It in sound banks; for It I
such hoarding that Is the Immediate occas
ion of money strlngoncy. Morever, aa a
rule, the business of our peonl Is con
ducted with honesty and probity, and this
applies al'ke to farms and factoilea, to
railroads and banks, to all learlUmate com
mercial enterprises.
In ar.y large body of men, however, there
are certain to be some who are dishonest,
and if the conditions are such that these
men prosper or commit their misdeeds
with Impunity, their example Is a very evil
thing for the community. Where these
men are business men of great sagacity and
of temperment both unscrupulous and reek
lens, and wheie the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or control
and at first wlinout effective check from
public opinion, they delude many lnnooent
people into making Investments or embark
ing In kinds of business that aie really
unsound. When the misdeeds of these suo
cennfully dlshonast men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon theut, but upon
the Innnocent men whom they have mis
led. It is a painful awakening whenever
It occurs, and, naturally, when it does O'v
cur those who suffer bis apt to forget that
the longer it was deferred the more psln.
im ii ttuuiu V9. in ne enorx lo punish,
the guilty It Is both !se and proper to en
deavor so far as possible to minimise the
distress of those who have been misled
by the guilty. Yet It Is not poAHlble to re
frain because of such distress from striving
to put an end to the misdeeds that are the
ultimate causes of the suffering, and, as a
nie: ns to this end. where Pussible. to pun
ish those responsible for them. There may
be honest dlfTerences of opinion a te many
governmental policies, but Surely there run
he no such difference as to need of unflinch
ing perservance In th war against success
ful dishonesty.
Recommendation Two Year Old.
Th president then repeats tha recom
mendations made to congress In December,
W6, in which he first urged legislation
looking to the fedeial control of corpora
tions engaged In interstate commerce. Out
of that recommendation cam th new
federal rate law, ths enlargement of the
powers cf the Interstate Commerce com
mission and the creation of the bureau of
corporation, which has conducted most
of the Investigations resulting In the prose
cution of the beef trust, the Standard Oil
trust and the fining of railroads that have
violated the law prohibiting rebates and
rate discriminations. The message then
continues:
I have called your attention In these '
quotulions to what I have elieady said be- .
rsuse I am aatlsfled that it Is the duty of
ttie national govrrnment to embody In
action the principles thus expressed.
Liberty and Regnlatioa.
No small part of the iiouble that we
have from carrying to an extreme the na
tional virtue of self-reliance, of Independ- '
ence In Inltlat1e and action. It Is wise to
conserve this virtue and to provide for It
fullest exercise, compatible with seeing that
liberty d'ies not become a llherty to wrong
othtrs. Unfortunately, this Is the rlml of
liberty that tha la k of all effective regula
tion Inevitably brewls The founder of
tne destitution provided tlml the national
government should have complete and
control of Interstate commerce. There
