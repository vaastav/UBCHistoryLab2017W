SHOOTING IN THE FIRST.
Two llrutnl Kncountors on Centre Street
Yesterday Afternoon.
Tlio First ward was In an uproar yesterday
afternoon over two encounters betweon fac
tious of tlio Lithuanian pooplo and which
appear to liavo been rained by a feud which
1iai existed between tho factions for years. It
is stated that the nicro accidental meeting of
any of tho factious is a signal for a general
row.
It is alleged that at about four o'clock yes
terday afternoon ono Anthony Burba loft
tho houso of saloonkeeper William Snydor,
at the corner of Centra and Kmerick streets,
and found ono William ltonch and flvo
friends Btandlug at the cornor. llurba, it is
statod, oxclaluied "With tho holp of God"
aud sprang at Roach. Tlio latter is a small
man, but very powerful, and soon had Burba
prostrate on tho ground. Tho latter's friends
then jumped upon Koach and Roach's friends.
For sqvoral minutes a dozen or moro enraged
mon ongaged in bitter conflict in which brass
knuckles played a prominent part. Fluully
Burba was dragged from tho crowd into
Snyder's houso, Ills scalp was cut in many
places and his faco appeared to be beaten
almost to a jolty. Uoach emerged from tho
battle with a long gash along tho side of his
face and uiauy bruises.
About two hours lator thoro was a second
fracas at the cor.Ceutro and Boners streets
in which tho samo factious took 'part and in
which Burba was shot at aud hit, but escaped
with a bruising by tho bullet. Ouo Martin
String was arrested for tho shooting and put
under bail for a hearing befcre Justico Cardin
this ovouing. Stories of tho shooting differ.
Burba says ho bad no hand in the light, but
was about to get on an electric car wliilo tho
tight was in progress when ho remarked to
String that thoro should bo no tight and tho
latter, without replying, drow a revolver and
flred. Tho bullet entered Burba's pants
pocket, on tho right hand sido, glanced oil' on
a silver dollar and passed through tho man's
ororcoat. Tho force of the bullet on tho
silver dollar caused a largo bruise ou Burba's
groin. Had tho bullet entered the body the
wound, in all probability, would havo boon a
very dangerous one.
