NOTICE.
A Bine Mark here is to call attention
the date to which your subscription is paid.
Remittances are desired from those in ar
rears. The week before Christmas.
Oppression of the poor and special
nrivileees for the rich is the kind of
M. w
prosperity the Dingley tariff pro
duces. ,
The "advance agents" continue to
keep a long way ahead of the show.
Mr. Dingley now fixes next June as
the time when his tariff law will bring
in more than the expenditures of the
government. This is one matter m
which seeing will be necessary to
believing.
The cotton operatives at Fall
River, Massachusetts, will experience
a slice of McKinley-Dingley prosperi
ty the first of the new year. AH
wages in the mills there are to be re
duced at that time and it is inti
mated the cut will be not less than
ten per cent. Twenty-eight thous
and working people will be affected
thereby.
With how much authority did
Spain's Premier speak in reference to
McKinley's Cuban expressions?
Sagasta is reported to have said
that he thinks the message is satis
factory "because the threat to inter
vene in Cuba was merely to give
satisfaction to a portion of the
American opinion, without the inten
tion of executing it."
Now it is said that the Spanish
Premier has changed front and Is
ODDOsed to the much-talked of
autonomy for Cuba, which goes to
show that the Cubans are right when
they decline to place confidence in
any promises made by the Spanish
government promises that are
simply Spanish spider webs con
structed to ensnare Cuban flies.
The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune
remarks that "the first four months
the Dingley law, which have just
ended, are extremely gratifying to
Its friends." That's a fact, although
the Tribune did not intend to convey
the xact situation. The trusts are
the friends of the Dingley law and
there is no doubt that the opeia
tions of the Dingley law are extreme
ly gratifying to the trusts. What
about the people? Well, they are
not in it when the Republicans frame
a tariff bill.
Platform utterances do not count
for much with Republicans except to
get in on. The National Republican
platform says, in regard to Cuba
"We believe that the govern sent of
the United States should actively use
its influence and good offices to re
store peace and give independence to
the island." McKinley gave un
qualified approval to the platform,
but his recent message, it must be
admitted, does not evince a very
strong ' desire for independence of
Ouba, or a purpose to aid in bring
ing it about if he can avoid it.
Commenting upon McKinley's re
marks in favor of an economical
administration of public affairs, the
Asheville Citizen, with sarcasm, says:
"This must be whv he advises the
building of three dry docks, the pur
chase of munitions of war, an in
crease in the number of enlisted men,
a liberal appropriation for the Paris
exhibition, the building of a battle'
ship or two and of several torpedo
boats." The Citizen might have in
claded the farcical international
bimetallic junketing tour, to which
the President still claims to pin faith
and hope.
The Republican members of Con
gress from this State do not relish
the civil service paragraph of the
President's message, whatever they
may think of the rest of it. A special
to the Charlotte Observer says "it is
agreed among the Republican mem
bers of the delegation that if Con
gress carries out the President's civil
Bervice policy, outlined in his mes
sage, that North Carolina will not
elect a Republican to the next Con
gress," which is equivalent to an
acknowledgement of the fact that a
large proportion of the North Caro
lina Republican heelers are moved
by what they expect to get at the
pie counter.
It Is quite evident that Mr. McKin
ley Is not blind to the probability of
future bond issues under the gold
standard, bnt his vision is not so
clear as to the preventive. Even if
his suggestion would prove a specific
the time when it would become
operative is so indefinite that several
bond issuing opportunities mayjbe
utilized by the avaricious treasury
raiders before that time rolls around.
The President recommends, and says
he is very earnest in doing so, that
"as soon as the receipts of the gov
ernment are quite sufficient to pay
all the expenses of the government,
that when any of the United States
notes are presented for redemption
in gold and are redeemed in gold,
each notes shall be kept and set
apart, and only paid ont in exchange
for gold." The stupendous failure of
the. Dingley tariff as a deficit pre
venter offers a big barrier to the ful
fillment of the President's Idea, to
say nothing of the baneful effects
that would follow the contraction of
the currency if his idea was ever
enacted Into law. ,
THE PRESIDENT SCORED.
Hon. Hannis Taylor, ex Minister
to Spain, in response to a request
from the Associated Press, gives ex
pression to his views upon that part
of the President's message relating
to the Cuban question, with which
he takes issue in a very forceful man
ner. Much weight attaches to Mr.
Taylor's views because of his close
study of the situation and of his
opportunities for getting at the in
side facts, and we incline to the
opinion that he comes nearer than
the President to expressing the pre
dominating: American sentiment in
reference to the matter.
At the outset, Mr. Taylor says, in
reference to the President's Cuban
policy :
"Putting aside the irrelevant mat
ter bv which it is encumbered, the
substance of the only recommends
tion actually made by the Executive
to CoDgress upon that subject is that
this erovernment cannot venture to
do anything to put an end to the
inhuman strife which, during the last
three years, has reduced the inland
almost to a desert, because there is a
prospect of a settlement between the
combatants upon a basis of a so
called autonomy lately put forth by
the Sagasta Ministry, l Deiieve tnac
Congress should firmly and scorn
fully reject such a policy 01 irresolu
tion and non action, because the
assumtion upon which it is founded
is an empty illusion."
Mr. Taylor refers to the Sagastan
policy as "a craftily incomplete
proposition that carries with it no
constitutional guarantee whatever."
He speaks of Spain s failure to con
quer the Cubans after "three years of
wholesale destruction" and the ex
penditure of an immense amount of
monev. aDd savs that the indefinite
and illegal autonomy now proposed
has been extorted by "the results of
a struggle that has so completely
broken the military and financial
Dower of Spain that a conquest of
the island is now hopeless." Furth
er, he asks who will say that all the
fruits the Cubans "have won through
death by sword and famine, should
in the hour of victory be surrendered
ior an emptv sham, which means
onlv new bondage under their old
and pitiless oppressors?"
Proceeding to score the President,
the ex Minister says "this heartless,
selfish message has not one word . of
encouragement or sympathy for this
suffering people." He says Congress
is politely told to attend to its own
business; that if recognition of
belligerency shall become necessary
in the future the executive power will
act without Congressional interfer
ence. He intimates, also, that there
is a conspiracy to thwart the will of
the nation through an appeal to the
Speaker of the House of Representa
tives, who will so manipulate the
rules as to prevent the passage of the
pending belligerency resolution which
tie Senate has already approved.
Mr. Taylor says the time has come
for popular demonstration to over
rule the administration's selfish and
short-sighted policy He is in touch
with American sentiment in advoca
ting belligerency and says if it is
granted there can hardly be a doubt
that Cuban independence would be
obtained within twelve or eighteen
months without one word of aid or
sympathy from us.
In conclusion, ex-Minister Taylor
broadly intimates that the present
policy may lead to trouble and that
the United States may have to main
tain at the point of the sword the
contention that no European power
other than Spain shall ever possess
Cuba. In this connection, he says :
"Out of such possible difficulties
the w ay is now clear and easy. Let
the pending belligerency resolution
be promptly passed by the House
and Spain's power in Cuba will
collapse like a punctured balloon.
For that reason she is making a
desperate fight against it with the
aid of the present administration.
Only through the triumph of the
revolutionary government can per
manent and lasting peace be estab
lished In Cuba; only through a
prompt and decided expression of
sympathy with that government can
we extricate ourselves from a dilem
ma which is fast growing into the
most shortsighted and disgraceful
episode in our national history."
GO FOR IT.
We fail to see what civil service has
to do with pension appropriations,
but, anyhow, the "Bull of the
Brushes," who has blood in his eye
for the civil service system, took
occasion to gore it savagely, yester
day, during the discussion of the
annual pension appropriation bill.
He reared and cavorted and made
the dust fly and, the dispatches tell
us, "set the galleries in a roar." He
jumped clear off the Republican plat
form and got entirely out of tnne
with the President's policy.
To be candid, we think Mr. Linney
in might near right in declaring that
he believed the spoils belonged to the
victors. A man should be qualified
for a position which he seeks at the
hands of the government and, if
necessary, should demonstrate his
qualification by practical tests, but
further than this we take but little
stock in the civil service.
So, go for it, Mr. Linney, every
change yon have, whether they are
talking about the pensions, the
Pacific railroad, or what not. The
Democrats are going in next time
and we want the ship manned by
Democrats from one end to the
other.
Mr. Linney used Tammany as an
example of sticking to political
friends. "Look at this picture," he
shouted, "The Tiger surrounded by
myriads of little tigers. -How would
the ' Tiger look surrounded by
monkeys and mice?" A grotesque
comparison, but one that hits the
nail right on the head.

AUTOCRACY.
'one man power" is
The "one man power is nearer
exemplification in the Speaker of the
House of Representatives than in
any other official peneonage in this
nonntrv. The opportunities for the
use of this power are greater and it
goes without saying that no man
who has ever occupied the position
has used this power more freely than
the present incumbent, Thomas B.
Reed, of Maine, who is very justly
duhbed "The Czar." "
The following from "the Boston
Herald will convey to the uninformed
an idea of the absolute dictation and
authority lodged in this one man :
"It is oerfectlv plain that there is
an inherent right in the members of
the House to direct their own busi
ness. This is really what govern
ment tv the people means. The peo
ple of the United States do not elect
Thomas B Reed to be Speaker of the
national House of Representatives;
Mr. Reed has had the votes only of
thot-e among them who constitute a
majority of the voters of the fort
land district in the State of Maine.
Yet, under present arrangements,
these voters Irom the Portland dis
trict of Maine control the i ntire vote
of the people of the United istates
outside their limits. Not a Repre
sentative of any district outside this
Maine district has a right even to be
heard on the floor of the House un
less this member from the Maine
district permits it. This is not a
nominal authority in the Maine j
member; it is an absolute one,
actually in exercise, and controlled
by the will of the Maine member.
The members elected from other
quarters do not fully represent their
constituents; they are not permitted
to do so. The whole public business
of the nation is to be transacted, or
not to be transacted, as this Maine
member shall dictate."
In view of, which, it is high time
that some reforms were being in
stituted by this law-making body
and that some limit was placed upon
the power of the Speaker. The pres
ent plan is altogether unjust and,
moreover, it is exceedingly danger
ous to the best interests of a republic
to place absolute authority in the
hands of one individual, and the
more so when that individual hap
pens to be the autocratic type of

A lot of Republican Congressmen
would leave a hole in their national
platform by pulling out the civil
service plank. But this would not
be a circumstance compared with the
holes that will be in it after the next
elections, after the people have in
spected the structure and condemned
the rotten timber used therein.
Regardless of politics, American
citizens admired the devotion of the
President to his eood mother and
sympathize with him now in the loss
which he has sustained. The Wash
ington Post says of Mrs. McKinley :
"She was frugal, industrious, and
pious, and her children not only had
her good precepts and example, but
her incessant efforts to give them
educational advantages and fit them
for good work in the world."
The six day bicycle race is over
and those who are opposed to cruel
ty to animals are glad it is so
Patience and fortitude and self-
denial are admirable qualities when
necessitated by the exigencies of
some noble and worthy cause, but
when a lot of men tax brain and
muscle to the exhausted point for the
sake of dollars and notoriety the
need of guardianship becomes ap
parent, as well as the truth of the
exuamation. "What fools these mor
tals be 1" The winner of the race was
off tie track only ten hours out of
the one hundred and forty-two, and
slept only four hours curing the six
days and night. If you talk about
stopping such foolishness by law
there are a lot of folks ready to
throw up their hands in horror and
lustily protest against abridging the
rights of an American citizen.
So long as the world stands and
any considerable number of its in
habitants abide outside the poor
house, the custom of exchanging
gifts at Christmas time will be in
vogue. It is a beautiful custom and
to arne that it will decrease in
extent or become extinct is to argue
that the milk of human kindness will
cease to fl w and that human grati
tude is passing away, since the ex
change of gifts at this hippy festal
period commemorates the greatest

The anti-civil service conference of
Republican Congressmen, held Satur
day night, indicates a purpose to
pour hot shot into a law which is
admired oy republicans during a
Democratic administration, when it
serves to keep Republicans in office,
but detested by them during a Re
publican administration, when it
may possibly keep a few Democrats

coiference was attended by sixty
members of Congress, representing
twenty-two. States, and after discus
sion of the subject .which brought
them together . a resolution was
adopted providing for the appoint
ment of a committee to examine the
bills pending before the committee
on the reform of the civil service, said

meeting of tht conference. Pearson,
of North Carolina, was named as one
of the seven members of the commit

THE PENSION SCANDAL.
The Probability of Eye-Opening
Ex-
posnres from the Inside.
Atlanta Constitution.
If the people of this country are
ever to escape the spoliation involved
in the increase of the pension list,
there must be an emphatic protest
againsc it, and that protest must
come from the north. The south is
somewhat handicapped in the mat
ter. A protest here, or from south
ern leaders in Washington, would be
easy to misinterpret. We leel that
the government should reward every
soldier who worthilv served it, and
who is now physically or financially
unable to take care of himself So
feeliuer, the southern representatives
in congress have not only tavored
pensions to soldiers who really
lought for the union, but have re
frained from protesting against the
raids which the pension sharks have
been making in the public treasury
during the past ten or filteen years.
There are already sins that public
sentiment at the north is beginning
to make iteelf felt in opposition to

He dec! ires that "'if the

How to Use Celery.
This plant, which belongs to the
parsley family, is in season from
September until April, and should be
in daily use on the family table. It
is one of the best nervines known, is
invaluable as a salad, and is of-great
importance in the kitchen, where it
may be used in rrany ways as a
flavoring, as a vegetable in soup, or
as a salad. Every part of a bunch
of celery is available in some depart
ment of cookery.
For table use, select firm white
stalks, wash them thoroughly then
scrape them and lay them in water
until they are crisp and cold. When
ready to serve dry in a cloth and
split the stalk down almost to the
bottom, allowing a few of the tender
white leaves to remain. Serve in a
celery glass or on a dish, with a
little salt.

MOTHER M'KlXliEY.
A Brief Sketch of Her Life Eighty
eight Years Old.
Mr. Nancy Allison McKinley, who
died at Canton, O., Sunday morning,
was born on April 22d, 1809. She came
of scotch Covenanter stock, or a
branch of the Allison family who left
their Scotch homes to seek religious
freedom In America. . She was mar
ried at the age of 22. and spent the ear
ly years of ber married life at Niles, O.,
where the President was born. He was
her seventh child, coming after David,
Anna, James, Mary. Helen, and
Sarah. Abner McKinley and a child
that died at birth were born after
William McKioley. "Mother" Mc
Kinley brought up her family od old
fashioned principles. She was a wo
man of strong character and strong
religious faith. For twenty years be
fore her son's election to the Pres
idency she had expressed a belief that
he would some time occupy the White
House. She attended the inaugura
tion and listened to ber son's address.
On the 5th of last July, while the
President was visiting his mother at
Canton, she tripped and fell, cutting
a gash in her forehead. She had the
wound sewed up without an atiesthe-
tic. and without complaint. Mrs.
McKioley lost her husband in 1889,
when he died at the age of 85. Her
daughter Helen had cared for her dur
ing her closing years. Mrs. McKin
ley's fatal illness was the result of a
paralytic stroke which occurred ten
days before her death.

A BIG STRIKE OF OIL.
No
Tanks Were Ready and a Great
Quantity Was Wasted.
Fisdlay, O , Dec. 13. Abigstrike
of oil was made yesterday on the
farm of Moses McAnnelly, in Big
Lick township, by the Standard Oi
Company. The well was drilled 129
feet into oil bearing rock, being much
deeper that any other well drilled in
this held. At that depth thete was
no sign of oil, but a large charge of
nitro glycerine was exploded at the
well and the last effort was rewarded
by a big flow of oil.
Owing to the poor prospects no
tanks had been set up, and the oi
poured out upon the ground all
night, and today there is a verita
ble sea of oil around the well for
several hundred feet. This morning
the pipes were connected, and the oi
is now being run into the company's

If your minister is not quite up to
the mark, the more is the reason why
you should stand by him. Were he
a - great scholar and an eloquent
pulpit orator and the possessor of
social gifts and graces, he would get
along without your support. But
he is simply a good, plain man, not
capable ot producing sensational
fleets, but still doing his duty as he
sees it to the best of his ability, he
needs all the help that you can give
him. We beg yon not to weaken him
by talking in such a way as to bring
him into contempt and reproach
b-fore the community. Your
thoughtless words, spoken withont
the definite intent to do harm, may

The President's objection to ex

THE REMEDY.
The Only Agent foi the Rrdrrri of

Raleigh News and Observer.
The Democratic party is the only
agent to which the people look for
redreps of grievances. It is the only
hope for release from nat ional, Sate
and local evils that oppress and
humiliate the people.
In the Federal government, the
money changers, tariff barons, pen
sion grabbers and trusts dominate
as completely as if they constituted
the iulk of the population. The re
result is that the few prosper while
the many toil in poverty and in
want. The remedy for our national
ills is plain and simple. It is to take
the whip cords and drive the money
changers out of the temple which
they have polluted, how can that
be done? The Chicago platform
points the way so clearly that a way

Referring to the report that the
chignon is to be revived, the Greens
boro Telegram suggests that the
ladies who adopt it "might secure
very striking effect by simultaneous
ly going in for a Kaffir ring in the
nose." It's no use, bud. Flattery
threats, ridicule, nothing, will keep
the women from wearing what they
please and wearing it as they please
When they get ready to go back to
a fashion of thirty years ago, and
wear chignons, they are going to
wear them; and then when they ge
ready to wear rings in their noses
they are going to wear rings
in their noses. And the strange part
of it all is that no matter how
ridiculously they rig themselves up
we all get use to it after awhile,
Just as well let them alone.
Distrust the Populists.
Charlotte News.
According to the news from Ral
eigh the Republicans distrusted their
former allies, the Populists, and
amending the election law repealed
the section making the supervisors
of election State officers and requir
ing them to take an oath. Thus
their power was taken from them
The law of 1895 provided lor tri
partisan election boards, and this
worked to the advantage of the Re
publicans as long as the Populists
wtre allied with them, and under
their control. Bat when they feared
that the Populists might fuse with
the Democrats and thus shift the
control of the election boards
against the Republicans, the Radi
cals and their allies in the Populist
ranks had the law repealed.
McKinley on the Tariff.
Richmond Dispatch.
President McKinley, in his refer
ence in his message to the Dingley
tariff, says "while its full effects haye
not yet beeu realized, what it has
already accomplished assures us of
its timeliness and wisdom." Alas I
we fear 'tis all too true that its full
effects have not been realized.
Furthermore, if the deficit in our
revenues that has amounted up
under it is an indication of what its
full effects will be, it is to be hoped
that they never will be realized.
When we consider that the DiDgley
bill has accomplished in five months
a deficit of some $16,000,000, it
takes to see in it any timeliness or
wisdom an optimism past the com
prehension of the average man.
That is the Question.
rhiladelphia Telegraph.
The Republican party was put in
charge of the government by the peo
ple of this country mainly for the
reason that the people believed it
would give them a debt paying and
not a debt incurring administration.
There is a heavy deficit staring us in
the face, and we want Dr. Dingley
and his compeers to tell us what they
are going to do about it. How are
they going to meet the shortage
which exists now and is daily in
creasing? That is the question we
want answered, and Mr. Dingley's
bright anticipations respecting some
period in the dim future do not
afford any satisfactory answer.
To the Rescue, White Men.
Rockingham Rocket.
The present administration
is
worse than a failure, and the desire
that white people alone shall rule
our State was never stronger and
more general. Never in the annals
of North Carolina history have our
good people been more united in
effort to bring about the needed re
form. They see the dangers which
now beset ns on every hand, and
view in the distance the Immense
whirlpool into which we are rapidly
drifting. There is but one remedy,
and that is in the triumph of the
good old Democratic party.. This,
and this alone, will bring the creak
ing, battered ship safely into port.

A Cure for Small Pox.
Charlotte Observer.
Mr. D. Reeves, who has been with
Eccles & Bryan since '71, hands the
Observer a clipping which he culled
from a newspaper 12 vears ago. He
believes in the recipe and as small
pox talk is in the country now, t'ie
Observer reproduces it for what it is
worth.
A correspondent of the Liverpool
Mercury writes to that journal as
follows: "I am willing to risk my
reputation as a public man if the
worst case of smallpox cannot be
effectually cured in three days simply
by cream-of-tartar. This is the sure
and never failing remedy: One ounce
of cream-ol tartar dissolved In a pint
of boiling water, to be drank when
cold at short intervals. It can be
taken any time, and is a preventive
as well as a curative. It Is known to
have cured in a hundred thousand
cases without a failure. I myself
have restored hundreds by this
means. It never leaves a mark,
never causes blindness, and always
prevents tedious lingering. If the
people would only try it, and report
the cures to you, you would require
to employ many columns If you
gave them publicity." In sending
the foregoing to the bhtcago Tribune,
a correspondent remarks that it is

given most attention to the subject
declare that the discovery of the uses
that can be made ol corn pith is one
of thegreateet scientific achievements
of the age, and such large things are
expected of it that the company con
trolling the processes for making
corn pith cellufose is capitalized for
$50,000,000."
