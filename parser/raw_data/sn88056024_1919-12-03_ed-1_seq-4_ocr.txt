THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
LTHOUGH he refrained from pre
tsentlng his views to congress on
line peace treaty in liis message Tuos
I day, one of the few he has not read
jin person to that body, because of his
I Ulness, President Wilson took occasion
I to urge action on some of the more
I pressing domestic problems that con
I front the United Stales, and his recom
I mendatlons will be generally approved.
The president urges that the budget
I system be adopted and moved out ot
the way. This system Is generally in
I dorsed over the country and its pass
age means greater government effi
ciency. President Wilson asks that
I there be a closer audit of expenditures,
very wise suggestion. Had we had
I this before charges of gross negligence
In expenditures would not have been
I made.
Future taxation is also recorn
I mended as needing the attention of
congress including simplification of
the income and profits tax. '-The prob
lem i„ not an easy one," said President
! Wilson in ills message. "A funda
mental change has taken place with
reference to l lie position of America
I in the world's affairs. The prejudice
I and passions engendered by decades of
ontroversy between two schools <>t
political and economic thought Ute one
believers in protection of Ameiman
Industries: the others believers In tariff
for revenue only—must bo subordinated
to the whole consideration of the public
interest In the light of utterly changed
Conditions."
The president is of the opinion that
the brightest possible future Is open

to American business because of the
conditions that exist in Europe, mu
balance of trade had been increased
most favorably, he points out. and
everything that wo have. Europe needs.
If we want to sell, we must be pie-I
pared to buy, says the president and
he urges congress to take no action
that will curtail imports for such
act would inevitably curtail exports.

Speaking of the ^justness future for
the United States, the president points
out:
"The policy of Isolation will sal
isfy the growing needs and oppor
tunities of America. The provin
cial standards and policies of the
past, which have held American
business as if in a straight Jacket,
must yield and give way to tho
needs and exigencies of the new
hope and promise for American
business. If we will but take ad
vantage of the opportunities that
ere ours for the asking. The re
cent war lias ended our isolation
and thrown upon us a great duty
and responsibility. The United
States must share the expanding
world market. The United States
desires for itself only equal op
portunity with the other nations
of the world and that through tho
process of friendly co-operation
and fair competition, the legiti
mate interests of the nations con
cerned may be successful and
equitably adjusted."
The president holds that the un
rest over the country Is due to the
fact peace has not been arrived at
He believes in dealing sternly with the
anarchists. Rather thin Imp,

drastic action in dealing with agita- i
tors he urges location of the
for their actions and its removal. That
may be all right In theory but it tj
hardly practical. U lu correct to re
move the cause for unrest but in the
radical something more than removal
of the cause is necessary. AVe have
in this country today a radical cle
ment that needs to be severely dealt
with, a fact the president will no
doubt recognize.
LADY ASTOR'S VICTORY.
D T Is a strange coincident Indeed that
an Amorican-born woman, Lady
Astor,. should be the first of her sex
to be elected to a scat In Great
Britain's house of commons. There
would not have been quite so much
surprise if this honor had been con
ferred upon one of English birth or
one born in the colonies. But instead,
R fell to a woman descendant of revo
lutionary stock that helped to throw
off the English yoke and lay the foun
dation for thfe great republic of tho
United States. The historical event
should tend to tighten the bonds of
lympathy between Great Britain and
this country.
Lady Nancy, after urgent solicitation
from her friends, agreed to enter the
race for her t|usband's seat as the drat
woman candidate ever to seek member
<WP in the house of commona. The
s l e et I on remitted from euoceeaion of
'Viscount Waldorf Astor, former m«tn
^ fl . uln t i , 0 button division, to lilo
father's title upon the death of tha |
elder viscount. This was a rather dar
ing venture for a woman, particularly
so as there was an inclination among
the voters to ridicule Lady Nancy's
candidacy. However, ehe bravely faced
the political music and made a stirring
campaign. At the outset she sta'ed
that it was. not her election that was
so much at stake as it was the ques
tion of the right of women y> be rep
resented in the great governing body
of the kingdom and that upon the
showing she made, if elected, depended
the future success of women in p oil -
tics.
lady Nancy completed a sensible
campaign with true American spirit.
Slio was quick to turn the satire and
ridicule to her own advantage and was
ever ready to defend the right of her
sex to have a say in public and g iv
ernmental matters. Her election can
be viewed only in the light of a Vic •
tory for the women of Great Britain.
During the war they came Into unusual
prominence when they took tho places
of the men who were called to the front,
in the factories and on tho farms.
Americans it is a source of satisfac
tion to see that one of their daughters
has "made good" abroad.
VILLA'S TERRIBLE REVENGE.
0/1/7 IDLE the report is probably
\'nj exaggerated, no doubt it Is in
substance correct, that Francisco Villa,
leading revolutionist In northern Mexi
co, attacked with a band of his fol
lowers a regiment of the federal army
and practically annihilated it. in re
venge for the execution of Felipe
Angeles, Villa's chief supporter in the
light against tho Carranza govern
ment. It was a terrible revenge and
will drive fear into the hearts
of all föderal troops that Carranza has
in tho northern section.
Villa has not been heard from for a
long time, but his reported outbreak
lot Rancho Espejo, 21 miles north of
Santa Rosalia, Chihuahua, Is probably
his first move to again attempt to drive
the federal troops out of the north of
Mexico and take over complete charge
of that country. There wero reported
j to In en in the regiment that he !
I
his band attacked and but twO|
! 0 f Gte federal troops survived. Dr. L. j
I Gomez brought the first report of I
the massacre into El Paso. |
The trouble has only started ill
| northern Mexico, as the latest bloody I
j battle proves. The United Elates will \

| trouble. 5 111a is now left alone to
j conduct the revolution. It is known |
that he was often held In check by
;
General Angeles. The latter was farj
loss brutal, a man of education and
classed as the world's greatest artil
lerist. He was the acknowledged in
| ventor of the French 7» millimetre gun,
the best piece of artillery ordnance In
the world. AVith General Angeles dead,
Villa will no doubt use bis execution
as a means to fire the revolutionary
element to white fever heat and bloody
battles will likely follow.
The French now have time to build
barracks to accommodate the flood of
tourists who wish to visit the battle
area but of course tho doughboys un
derstand that most of the tourists are
people who made enough money out of j
the war to buy better shelter than is i
afforded by a mudhole.

land where the well known hide

your praise, even if bilking Jays

puts automatic Jacks under my

problems and things like those,
sores on our heads and toes, let's

they have a million sores where we
have one; hark to the foreign howls,
see how the peasant growls, wip
ing his tear wet Jowls—look at the

batting their futile heads on a stone
wall, they have their legions there,
arguing black despair, jawsmlths

proves my looks, dear?"
"I suppose so," said hubby.
"But what makes you look so cross?"
"I'm thinking of the bill for that bat.
You can't expect that to improve my
looks."
PROHIBITING OSCULATION.
After tobacco has been wiped out and
dominoes and tlddledywinks ho.ve gone
the way of all sinful things, it seems
reasonably sure that kissing will be
eliminated from the list of pleasant
recreations.
But there has come from New Zea
land a traveler with the Joyful tidings
that there will still be in existence
chaste salute which may be employed,
at least until it is prohibited by law.
It seems that the Maori women of New
fZenland know nothing about kissing.
Their education has been neglected.
Nose rubbing is their form of saluta
tion. This form of greeting is not con
fined to tho women, but is practiced by
the men and Is also co-educational.
All the joy will not be taken out of
life If sweethearts can still rub noses.
But If the lady is all rouged and pow
dered for the party It may cause a mis
understanding.
The spectacle of two American gen
tlemen meeting on the street and rub
bing noses may be entertaining enough
to repay us for some of the pleasures
we will have lost by the time.
But, so far as the ladies en con
cerned, It is doubtful if anything will
ever take the place of the kiss, and
young women will be smuggling them
in spite of all the revenue officers and
anti-vice commissioners that can be
appointed.
As long as they make kisses some
body will be using them. •
A SLIPPERY TRANSACTION.
As I was slipping along tho street,
it came io mo that I needed some slips
to slip into my card file, so I slipped
into the stationery store, where the
clerk slipped up to me and I told him
the kind of slips I wanted, so he slipped
downstairs and got the slips and slipped
them to me. 1 slipped him the money i
and asked him to give me a slip so t
could slip it to the cashier. Ho slipped i
me the slip and I slipped out, and on
J l, ' r *'' n ' at the office slipped the slip
to the cashier, who slipped me the cash,
SO ^ slipped out, and this closed a very
slippery business transaction,
