PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
McKinley's Annual Communi
cation to Congress.
Many Important Recommendation! Arc
Made In the Dornmrut, Wliloh Dead
Intelligently and In I'laln Laogiiam
With Every Topic In AVliloh the N
Hon la Intorvited,
".iniiLMHiiA, ihc. a. ITesiclcut
McTnnley's niimial message was rend In
both houses of the legislature nt the firsl
rtuy's session today. The message in purl
is as follows:
To th Senate and House of Represen
tatives:
At the outgoing of the old and the in
coming of the new century you be
C!n the last session of the Fifty-sixth
congress' with evidences on every hand
of individual and national prosperity
and with proof of the growing strength
and increasing power for good "of He
publican Institutions. Your country
men will Join with you In felicitation
that American liberty Is more firmly
established than ever before and that
love for it and the determination to
preserve It are more universal than at
any former period of our history.
In our foreign Intercourse the domi
nant question has been the treatment
of the Chlmee problem. Apart from
this our relations with the powers have
been happy.
The recent troubles In China spring
from the antl-forelgn agitation which
for the past three years has gained
strength in the northern provinces.
Their origin lies deep In the character
of the Chinese races and In the tradi
tions of their government. The tele
graph and the railway spreading over
their land the steamers plying on their
waterways, the merchant and the mis
sionary penetrating year by year
farther to the interior, became to the
Chinese mind types of an alien Inva
sion, changing the course of their na
tional life and fraught with vague
forebodings of disaster to their beliefs
and their self-control.
The sect commonly styled the Boxers
developed greatly In the provinces
north of- the Yangtse, and with the
collusion of many notable officiate of
the throne itself, became alarmingly
aggressive. No foreigner's life, outside
of the protected treaty ports, was safe.
No foreign Interest was secure from
spoliation.
The diplomatic representatives of the
powers In Pekln strove In vain to
check this movement. Protest was fol
lowed by demand and demand by re
newed protest, to be met wltM perfunc
tory edicts from the palace and evasive
and futile asurances from the Tsung LI
Yamen.
The increasing gravity of the condi
tions In China and the Imminence of
peril to our diversified Interests In the
empire, as well as to those of all the
other treaty governments, were soon
appreciated by the government, caus
ing it profound solicitude. The United
States from the earliest days of foreign
Intercourse with China, had followed a
policy of peace, omitting no occasion to
testify good will, to further the ex
tension of lawful trade, to respect the
sovereignty of Its government and to
Insure by all legitimate and kindly but
earnest mtnns the fullest measure of
protection for the lives and property of
law abiding citizens and for the exer
cise of their beniflcent callings among
the Chinese people.
Mindful of this, it was felt to be ap
propriate that our purposes should be
pronounced in favor of such course as
would hasten united action of the pow
ers at Pekin to promote the adminis
trative reforms so greatly needed for
strengthening the imperial government
and maintaining the integrity of China,
in which we believed the whole western
world to be alike concerned. To these
ende I caused to be addressed to the
several powers occupying territory and
maintaining spheres of Influence In
China the circular proposals of 1899, In
viting from them declarations of their
Intentions and views as to the desira
bility of the adoption of measures In
suring the benefits of equality of treat
ment of all foreign trade throughout
China.
With gratifying unanimity the re
sponses coincided in this common pol
icy, enabling me to see In the success
ful termination of these negotiations
proof of the friendly spirit which ani
mates the various powers Interested In
the untrammeled development of com
merce and Industry in the Chinese em
pire as a source of vast benefit to the
whole commercial world.
The president then tells In brief the
story of the rescue of the legations,
and proceeds:
The policy of the United States
through a!, this trying period was
clearly announced and scrupulously
carried out. A circular note to the
powers, dated July 3. proclaimed our
attitude. Treating the condition in the
north as one of virtual anarchy, in
which the great provinces of the south
and southeast had no share, we re
garded the local authorities in the lat
ter quarters as representing the Chi
nese people with whom we sought to
remain in peace and friendship. Our
declared aims Involved no war against
the Chinese nation. We adhered to the
legitimate office of rescuing the im
erlled legation, obtaining redress for
wrongs already suffered, securing
wherever possible the safety of Ameri
can life and property In China and pre
venting a spread of the disorders or
their recurrence.
As was then said: "The policy of the
government of the United States Is to
seek a solution which may bring about
permanent safety and peace to China
preserve Chinese territorial and admin
istrative entity, protect all rights
guaranteed to friendly powers by
treaty and International law and safe
guard for the world the principle of
equal and impartial trada with all parts
of the Chinese empire."
Faithful to those proessioqs which,
as it proved, reflected the views and
purposes of the other co-operative gov
ernments, all our efforts, have been di
rected toward ending the anomalous
situation In China by negotiations for
a settlement at the earliest possible
moment. As soon as the sacred duty
of relieving our legation and its de
pendents was accomplished we with
drew from active hostilities, leaving
our legation under an adeouate ruard
In Pekln as a channel of negotiation
and settlement, a course adopted by
others of the Interested powers. Over
tures of the empowered reprcsentatlvea
or the Chinese emperor have been con
slderately entertained.
The expositiou of the resources and
products of the Western hemisphere to
be held at I! 11 flu lo next year, promises
important results not only for the United
States, but for tho other participating
countries. It is gratifying that the Latln
Americnn states have evinced the live
liest interest, and the fact that an In
ternational American congress will be
held in the city of Mexico while the ex
position is in progress, encourages the
Itolie of a lalL'er disiilnv nt TtnfTnl,. tlinn
might otherwise be practicable. The
worn or preparing an exhibit of our na
tional resources is making satisfactory
progress under the direction nf i!iff..rnn
ollicers of the federal government and
lite various states of tho union Lave
shown a disposition toward the most
liberal participation in the enterprise.
In my last annual. measure I dwelt
at some length upon the condition of
affairs in the Philippines. While seek
ing to Impress upon you that the grave
responsibility o? the- future govern
ment of those Islands rests with the
congress of the United States, I ab
stained from recommending at that
time a specific and final form of gov
ernment for the territory actually heM
by the United States forces and In
wnicn as long as insurrection contin
ues military arm must necessarily be
supreme.
Progress in the hoped for directiou baa
oeen ravorable. Our forces have skil
fully controlled the greater nart nf th
lslands.overcomlng the organized forces
or insurgents and carrying order and
administrative regularity to all quar
ters. What opposition remains Is for
1 110 most part scattered.
The president snenks nf thn mmnlnt
uient of the Philippine commission and
uis instructions to that body. He cor.
tinues:
"Coincldently with the entrance of
me commission upon Its labors I
caused to be Issued by General Mac
Arthur, the military governor of the
Philippines, on June 21, 1900, a procla
mation of amnesty in generous terms,
of which many of thn iniire-ont
advantage, among them a number of
important leaders.
The present strength of the army Is
ivu.vuu men, oo.oou regulars and 35,000
volunteers. Under the act of March 2,
1899, on the 30th of June next the pres
ent volunteer force will be discharged
and the regular army will be reduced
to 2,447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men.
We have in Cuba between B.OOO anil
000 troops. For the Dresent our fiwn
In that island cannot be withdrawn or
materially diminished, and certainly
not until the conclusion of the labors
of the constitutional convention now
In session and a srovernmenr nrnuiiioi
by the new constitution shall have
oeen estaonsned and its stability as
sured. In Porto Hlco we have reduced
the garrisons to 1.636. which in.ino
879 native troops. There Is no room for
runner reduction here. We will be re
quired to keep a considerable force in
the Philippines for some time to come.
x rom tne Drst information obtainable
we will need there for the immediate
future from 45.000 to 60.000 men t m
sure the number may be reduced as the
insurgents snail come to acknowledge
tho authority of the United States, of
which there are assuring indications.
It must be apparent that we will re
quire an army of about 60,000 and that
during the present conditions In Pnha
and the Philippines the president
snoule? have authority to Increase the
rorce to the present number of 100,000.
Included! In this number authority
should be given to raise native troops
in the Philippines up to 15,000, which
the Taft commission believes will be
more effective in detecting and sup
pressing guerrillas, assassins and la
drones than our own soldiers. I favor
the recommendation of the secretary of
war for the detail of officers from the
line of the army when vacancies occur
in the adjutant general's department,
inspector general's department, quar
termaster's " department, subsistence
department, pay department, ordnance
department and signal corps.
The president speaks of the rapid
growth of the postal service and ap
proves the recommendation of the sec
retary of the navy for new vessels and
for more officers and men.
The pension roll shows a net Increase
of 2,010 names.
Action Is recommended in the way of
Increasing the number of schools In
Alaska. Progress is noted In the edu
cational, agricultural and railroad de
velopment of the Hawaiian islands.
The civil service commission is great
ly embarrassed In Its work for want
of an adequate permanent force for
clerical and other assistance. Its needs
are fully set forth in its report. I in
vite attention to the report, and es
pecially urge upon the congress that
this important bureau of the public
service which passes upon the quali
fications and character of so large a
number of the officers and employes of
tne government, should be supported
by all needed appropriations to secure
promptness and elliecieiicy. In our great
prosperity we must guard against the
danger It Invites of extravagance In
government expenditures and appro
priations, and the chosen representa
tives of the people will, I doubt not,
furnish an example in their legislation
of that wise economy which, In a sea
son of plenty, husbands for the future.
In this era of great business activity
and opportunity caution is not untime
ly. It will not abate, but strengthen
confidence; it will not retard, but pro
mote legitimate industrial and com
mercial expansion. Our growing power
brings with it temptations and perils
requiring constant vigilance to avoid.
It must not be used to invite conflicts
nor for oppression, but for the more
effective maintenance of tnose princi
ples of equality and Justice upon which
our Institutions and happiness depend.
Let us keep always in mind that the
foundation of our government Is lib
erty: its superstructure, peace.

SAN FKANC1SCO, Dec. 3.-Two
more of those injured iu the Thanksgiv
ing Day accident died yesterday, making
21 deaths iu all. Yesterday's dead are
Lllery Cramluli, aged 12 and IS. P. Tice,
aged 40. Nine of the dead were buried
yesterduy.
The victims were watching a football
game between the Stanford and Univer
sity of California teams wheu the roof
beneath them gave way, precipitating
them to the Moor of the factory. Some of
them fell upm the furnaces and one
man of unknown identity was burned al
most to a crHp.
The crash of the falling roof was heard
a great distance away and thousands of
people hurri.Kl to the scene. Messages
were sent to the city hospital and the
morgue nnd the available ambulances
were hurried to tho spot.
There were more than 200 people on
the roof wheu it collapsed. Those for
tunate enough to be' 011 a side section of
the building, hurried down and helped
remove the Injured. The heat around the
furnaces was so great, however, that to
many no as'stance could be rendered,
nnd they slowly roasted to death. Not
200 yards n vay were 20,000 peon
watching the football gauu and wliej
thp news became known there was In
tense excitem nit ninong them. Tho ujh
ers went through the crowd calling for
doctors nnd many surgeons hurriedly left
the game. The living victims of the dis
aster were taken to various hospital.
The Southern Pacific Hospital, within
two blocks of the scene was soon over
crowded nnd many of the wounded lin-l
to be turned a way. They werp hurr'i!
to St. Luke's, the receiving hospital an J
nearby drug stores. So scattered were
they among l,e various institutions, that
it was at first impossible to tell exactly-
now many were nurt or now serlouViy
tliey were injured.
The mnnager of the glass works realiz
ed the danger before the accident occur
red and had sent for the police to compel
the crowd to leave. Just as- a squad nf
officers arrived the roof went down.
Tho fires '11 the furnaces had been
started for the first time nnd tho va n
were full of liquid glass. It was upon
these that the victims fell. Some wen
killed Instantly and others were slowly
roasted to death.
The few who missed the furnaces roll'
ed off together with workmen in the glass
works saved ti.e lives of many by millinu
them Braj from their horrible resti u
place.

and Robbed.
JAMESTOWN N. Y., Dec. 3. Last
Thursday information was sent out of
the death at Syracuse of George Annls
or Jamestown, who It was reported,
committed suicide by Jumping into the
canal In that city. There were sus
picious circumstances connnected with
the case. The body was brought to
Jamestown and yesterday morning an
autopsy was conducted.
It showed conclusively that the
young man was suffering from a de
ranged condition of the mental facul
ties, and that this condition resulted
from a recent blow on the head. The
scalp was bruised and a clot of blood
had formed between tho scalp and
skull. Under the skull at this point
the brain was congested and blood
clots had formed. Indications were
that the Injury was of very recent or
igin, not more than 48 hours before
death.
The physicians say that injury was
caused by a sandbag or something of
that nature. Annis had evidently been
robbed, a valuable ring had been torn
from the finger and a large amount of
money which Annis should have had
In his possession was missing.

REVigW OF TRADE.
Bradstreet's lteport on Conditions of
Business Throughout the Country.
NEW YORK, Dec. 1. Bradstreet's
review of trade says:
Unsettled weather and holidays ar a
lrawback to retail ami jobbing distribu
tion in many markets but the general
iituation is still a most satisfactory one
ind tl) iron and steel, coal, boot aud
ihoe, hardware and lumber trades are
jonspicuoiisly well situated. The iudus
U'ial situation is also deserving of note
because of the striking absence of coui
pluiut as to idleness or as to pending or
future labor troubles. Bunk clearings,
while naturally smaller than those of
lust week, are considerably ahead of lust
fear, a murk of progression not to be
lost sight of.
The fact that the slight gains shown
jver last year's railroad earnings returns
are still being maintained is nu added
proof that trade as a who! ? i btens con
ducted ou a large scale. T.i ex, M-t l:n !e,
while some lines, nutn' ...or.s nnd
iron, are less active, m w pro-it's i f Am
erican progression are eonsi.:::t'y being
presented.

At New York the infliieuce of this cor
ner one of the few successful corn cor

tive liquidation.
