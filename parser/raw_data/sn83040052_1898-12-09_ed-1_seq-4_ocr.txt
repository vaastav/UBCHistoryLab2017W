REMEMBER THE POOR.
It is especially incumbent upon those who
have plenty of this world's goods to think of
the less fortunate at such a time as this, when
cold weather and heavy snow have added to the
distresses of poverty. There will be much en
ferced idleness among the laboring classes in
Kansas City as a result of the present storm.
Within this class are many who live from hand
to mouth. Consequently, unusual demands
will be made upon the charitable institutions
and upon the charitable branches of the various
churches. Those who can afford t give some
thing for the relief of the unusual distress re
sulting from stvere weather can readily find
mediums through which to minister. Kansas
City Journal.
Is it possible that these conditions exist right
in the midst of a great "wave of prosperity,"
or has the Journal become a calamity howler"?
Where is the "advance agent of prosperity,"
whose election was going to givs steady work,
at good wages, to the laboring man? Would it
not be well for him to shower a few crumbs of
prosperity on the poor souls who have been un
able to lay by enough to tide them over a
stormy day, and have enough to live "from
hand to mouth"?
' What are the facts in relation to the admin
ittration of this boasted "advance agent" np
to date? Here are some of them:
A war, claimed to have been in the interest
of humanity, and ended in a scramble for spoils.
An additional interest-bearing debt, amounting
to hundreds of millions of dolors, piled upon
the shoulders of an already debt-burdened peo
ple. A restoraticn of the old English system
of stamp tax, and tax on tea, under which
over three hundred thousand dollars a day is
drawn from the people. The flattest wool mar
ket known ior years, and cotton lower than ever
known in the nation's history. Wool exchange
closed, and a general shut-down of woolen
mills throughout New England, and half the
cotton mills closed, and tens of thousands of
operatives left without employment, and foiced
to depend largely upon public charity. The
greatest strike of coal-miners the world has
ever known, ending in murdering many miners
and starving the remainder back into the slav
ery of such cold-blooded mine-owners as Mark
Hanna. A tariff law that gives free trade in
saw-logs for the lumber king, and imposes a
high tax upon the poor man's lumber. An ad
ministaation that has surrendered to the money
power the people's option to pay our bonded
debt and treasury notes in silver dollars, thus
forcing us to get the gold, it matters not at
what cost. And this "advance ageut o pros
perity" now asks fot a standing army of ioo,
ooo men, to be supported in time of peace,
mainly by the men who, in the hour of ptril,
are the nation's defenders. And finally, after
borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars, we
are, according to this "advance agent's" mes
sage to congress, confronted by a deficit, at the
close of the, present fiscal year, June 30, 1899,
of $ 112,000,000.
All this, and eve more of like nature, has
occurred under the rule of this "advance agent
of prosperity." No wonder the Journal, when
a little flurry of snow comes to give it the
slightest excuse, sounds the alarm of approach
ing starvation, and tries to put the blame on
the Lord, instead of on the prosperity howlers,
WHERE IT BELONGS:
' THERE are two state treasurers serving the
state of Nebraska. One a Republican is
serving a term in the penitentiary for appropri
ating the state's money to his own use. The
other is a Populist, who is filling the treasurer's
office faithfully, aud has the entire confidence of
.the people. '

THE MESSAGE.
We publish the President's message in our
local edition this week, so every reader can
form his own opinion of it. So far as we can
understand the message, there is nothing in it
aside from a partial resume of the year's inci
dents. McKinley. seems afraid to tackle the
Phillipine question at any rate, he says not a
word about it. He talks favorably to Cuban in
dependence with a string to it.
In looking over the expressed opinions of
prominoat men ot the nation, we hnd very few
who are favorably impressed with the message.
In fact, the message emphasizes the fact that
the President is a weak, willing tool of the fel
lows who want to make money at the expense
of humanity.
HUNGRY AND COLD.
Yes; We Need Expansion.

Shelters for the homeless were overrun last
night. By 10 o'clock every 5 and 10 cent lied
in the Helping Hand institute was occupied,
and the floor of the "free room" was complete
ly covered with the prostrate bodies of penni
less men. They lay as thick as logs in a saw
mill, even the entrance to the door being block
ed by those who came late and found no other
spot so lie down. A small stove in the center
of the room furnished warmth, and several who
had been trudging around through the snow all
day crouched about it, drying their tattered
shoes.

Republicans hoped thus to seat their candidate.
However, it transpires that the Republican can

obeyed, neither man can occupy the seat. This
would, naturally, give the place to Warren Fos
ter, the Populist candidate, who has but one
wife. But, then, it wouldn't do to give the
place to a "crazy Pop," so the law will be ig
nored, and the polygamous Democrat will
doubtless be seated, as he received the most
votes.
Now THAT Andrew Carnegie has seen fit to
oppose McKiuley's expansion policy, the Re
publican papers no longer refer to him as Mr.
Andrew Carnegie, but they call him "Andy
Carnegie, the old iron-monger." These same
sheets now recall the Homestead affair in very
uncomplimentary terms, and warn the working
people against him; whereas, in the years gone
by, they fully endorsed this same affair, and
condemned those who found fault with Carne
gie and his associates. Funny, isn't it?

He went up to the clerk's desk, fumbled in his
vest pocket and produced a greasy nickel. Put
ting it down on the desk as though it were a $5
gold piece, he said:
"Ken I git a bed?"
"SBeds all gone," said the clerk.
The man looked around helplessly; looked
towards the stove, looked toward the door and
hesitated.
"You'll find a 5 cent house around the corner
on Third street," said the clerk.
The man went out.
The next man who came in wore a slouch
hat and an old overall blouse. He stood before
the clerk's desk shivering, and his lace was
blue beneath the several days' growth of dirty
beard.
"Yes, I can fix a place for you," said the
clerk.
"Haven't had any calls?" asked the man.
"No."
"If any comes in to-night wake me up," he
said to the clerk as he disappeared up the nar
row stairway.
"That fellow's all rirht." said the clerk. I

pestilence that walketh at noonday. Nobody
ever got so much for so little money. The de
partment stores can't hold a candle to us, and
the ninety-nine-cent fellows aren't in it. Our
hired men who are negotiating this trade say
that when they get the islands, they will make
them on open door for all nations. The Non
conformist does not favor this, for if the door
is always open, the poor Phillipinos may catch
cold; and besides, we may not be able to keep
an open door. The natives may close and lock
it, and pile up the furniture against it. Be
sides, also, it is doubtful if we will own that
door even when we buy it. Our title may fail.
We may not be buying of the true owner. It
would be a great bargain if we could get eight
million slaves at two dollar and a half apiece,
but does Spain have a right to sell a whole na
tion into foreign servitude? It seems to us that
we have read somewhere that all mtu are cre

is probably a glittering generality, written for.

The government pays for the building of 650
postal cars every year, yet it does not own one
of them. It not only docs this, but it throws in -$500
011 each car for good measure, An ordi
nary postal car costs $5,000, and the governmeMt
pays to the railroad company $5,500 for the use
of that car each year. There are 650 such',
cars in use, for which the railroads get about.
$3,600,000 annually. One of those cars will!
last twenty years, and during that time the rail
roads collect from Uncle Sam $72,000,000 and
have a lot of old iion and kindling wood left.
The cars cost the railroads altogether only $3,
250,000, but in twenty years they got from the
United States stventy-t wo millions. In addition
to this we pay the railroads $30,000,006 a year
for carrying the mail in those cars that w buy
every year, but never own. How long would
the business of a private individual last if he.,
would make this kind of trade? The railroads
carry the express cars for many times less money
than they charge for carrying the mails. Why.
should the government, .be robbed any . more
than an express company? There is no use ia
getting mad over this outrageous extortio, but
we are much to blame if we don't derive from
it a useful lesson in politics. Public ownership
of railways and mail cars will settle this stu
pendous steal, and settle it forever. When that
lime conies, and it is surely coming, the postal
service instead of being a constant expense,
will be a source of prodigious pre fit. When
we build a mail car, we will build it for ourselves
and not for somebody else, and we will transport ;
the mails for six million dollars instead of thirty
millions. How soon will people quit their fool-.
ishness and profit by the lessons of wisdom?
