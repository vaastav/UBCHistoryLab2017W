DRY AN AND ROOSEVELT.
President Boos -volt's message
to congress is said to be the long
est document of its kind ever
presented to that distinguished
law-making body. It contains
manv rood things; many sugges
tions which, if heeded, would be
of great advantage to the masses
of our population.
Mr. Bryan who, it seems be
yond a shadow of a doubt, w ill
be the nominee of the Democrat
ic party for President next year,
endorses nearly everything of
importance contained in the mes
sage: even the Government Pos
tal Savings Banks. . "lotheiel
W lin a tree" it seems that Mr
Rrvan and President Roosevtlt
are running on exactly the same
ticket: the only difference being
that one is named Democrat
and the other "Republican."
They believe alike, they look
alike, thev think alike, they act
alike and they talk alike. The
fact of the business is if Mr.
Bryan is the nominee of the
Republican party there are thou
sands of good Southern Demo
crats would not give a cent which
one was elected, for the whole
- country has come to believe that
both of the 11 are pure at heart
and want to do and see done
that which will be best for the
