President’s Message.
DELIVKRIiD TO CONGRESS ON
DECEMBER 3, 1866
Fei.low Citizens or the Senate and House
of Representatives :
After a brief interval, the Congress of the United
States returns to its annual legislative labors. An
all-wise and merciful Providence has abated the
is-stile-.g- which visited our shores, leaving its ca
famitoi trace? upon some portions of our country.
Peace, order, tranquility and civil authority have
been formally declared to exist throughout the
whole of the United States. In all the states civil
authority has superseded the coercion of arms, and
the people by their voluntary action are maintain
lug their government , in full activity and complete
operation. The enforcement of the laws is no
longer obstructed in any State by combinations too
powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary-course, of
judicial proceedings, and the animosities engen
dered bv the war ure rapidly yielding to the benefi
cent influences of our free institutions, and to the
kindly offers of unrestricted social and commercial
intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal
feeling must be the earnest wish of every patriotic
heart: and we shall have accomplished bur grand
est national achievmeut, when, forgetting the sad
events of the past, and remembering only their in
structive lessons, we resume our onward course as
a free, prosperous and united people.
RESTORATION OF THE STATES.
In my message o. the 4th of December, 1865. Con
gress was informed of the measures which had
been instituted by the Executive, with a view to
the gradual restoration of tho States, in which the
Insurrection occurred, to their relations with the
General Government. Provisional Governors had
been appointed, conventions called. Governors
elected, legislatures assembled, and Senators and
Representatives chosen to the Congress of the
United States. Courts had been opened for the en
forcement ol laws long in abeyance. The blockade
had been removed, custom houses re-established,
and the internal revenue laws put in force in order
that the people might contribute to the national in
come. Postal operations had been renewed, and
efforts were being wade to restore them to their
former condition and efficiency. 3Tie States them
selves had been asked to take part in the high func
tion of amending the Constitution, and of thus
sanctioning the extinction of African slavery as one
of the legitimate results of our internecine struggle.
Having progressed thus far, the Executive Depart
ment found that it had accomplished nearly all
that was within the scope of its constitutional au
thority.
One*thing, however, yet remained to be done be
fore the work of restoration could be completed,
aud that was the admission to Congress of loyal
Senators and Representatives from the States
whose people had rebelled against the lawful au
thority of the General Government. ThU question
devolved uiion the respective houses, which by the
Constitution are made the judges of the election,
returns and qualifications of their own members :
and its consideration at once engaged the attention
of Congress.
In the meantime, the Executive Department, no
other plan having been proposed by Congress, con
tinued in its efforts to perfect, as far as was practi
cable, tiie restoration of the proper relations be
tween the citizens of the respective States, the
States aud Federal Government,—extending from
time to time, as the public interest seemed to re
quire, the judicial, revenue aud postal systems of
the country. With the advice and consent of the
Senate, the necessary officers were appointed, and
appropriations made by Congress for the, payment
of their salaries.
THE ANTI-SLAVERY A MEN II VENT.
The proposition to amend the Federal Constitu
tion. so as to prevent the existence of slavery with
in the United States, in any place subject to their
jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite number
of States, and on the 18th day of December, 1865,
it was officially declared to have become valid as a
part of the Constitution of ti e United State. All
of the States in which the insurrection had existed
promptly amended their constitutions so as to make
them conlorm to tne great change thus effected in
the organic law of the laud—declared null and void
all ordinances and laws of secession—repudiated
all pretended debts and obligations created for the
revolutionary purpose of the insurrection, and pro
ceeded in good faith to the enactment of measures
for the protection and amelioration of the colored
race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any
of these States to representation, and it was not
until the close of the eighth month of the session
that an exception was made in favor of Tennessee.
I deem it a subject of profound regret that Con
gress has thus far failed to admit to seats loyal
Senators and Representatives from the other States
where the inhabitants, with those of Tennessee,
had engaged in rebellion. Ten States—more than
one-fourth the whole number—remain without re-
The seats of fifty members of the
ousc, and twenty of the Senate, are yet vacant:
not by their own consent; not by a failure of elec
tion, but by the refusal of Congress to accept their
credentials. The r admission, it is believed, would
have accomplished much towards the renewal and
strengthening of our relations as one people, and
removed serious cause for discontent on the part of
the people of those States. It would have accord
ed with the great principles enunciated in the
declaration ol American independence, that no
people ought to bear the burden of taxation and
yet be denied the right of representation. It
would have been in consonance with the express
provisions of the Constitution, that each State shall
nave at least one representative, and that no State,
without its consent, shall be deprived of equal
suffrage in the Senate. These provisions were in
tended to secure to every State the right of repre
sentation in Congress, and so important was it
deemed by the framers of the Constitution that
the equality of the States shall be preserved in the
Senate, that not even by an amendment of the
Constitution can any State, w ithout its consent,
be denied a voice in that branch of national legis
lation. It has been assumed that these States, by
rebellion, became Territories; but r.ll departments
of the Government, with great distinctness, icft’sed
to sanction an assumption so incompatible with
the nature of our Republican system, and the pro
fessed objects of thfe war. Throughout the recent
legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes
itself apparent that these ten political communities
are nothing less than States.
INTEGRITY OF THE STATES.
It Is true, it has been assumed that the existence
of the States was terminated by the rebellious acts
of their inhabitants, and that the insurrection hav
ing been suppressed, they were thenceforward to
be considered merely as conquered territories.
The legislative, executive and judicial depart
ments of the government have, however, with
great distinctness and uniform consistency refused
to sanction an assumption so incompatible with
the nature of our republican system and the pro
fessed objects of the war. Throughout the recent
legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes
Itself apparent that the ten political communities
are nothing les than States of this Union. At the
very commencement of the rebellion, each House,
with a unanimity as remarkable as it was signifi
cant, declared that the war was not “ waged upon
our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any
purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor for the
purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the
rights or established institutions of those States;
hut to defend and maintain the supremacy of the
Constitution, and all laws made in
thereof; and to preserve the Union with all the
dignity, equality and rights ot the several States
unimpaired; and that, as goon as these objects aife
accomplished, the war ought to cease.”
In some instances Senators were permitted to
continue their legislative functions, wliile in other
instances Representatives were elected and admit
ted to seats after their States had formally declared
their right to withdraw from the Union, and were
endeavoring to maintain that right by force of
arms. All of the States, whose people were in in
surrection as States, were included in the appor
tionment of the direct tax of $20,000,000 annually
laid upon the United States by the act approved
Bth of August, 1001. Congress, by the act of March
4, 1802. and by" the apportionment of representa
tion thereunder, also recognized their presence as
States in the Union, and they have for judicial pur
poses been divided into districts as States alone
cau be divided. The same recognition appears in
the recent legislation in reference to Tennessee,
which evidently rests upon the fact that the func
tions of the State were not destroyed by the rebel
lion, but merely suspended, and'that principle is
of course applicable to those States, which, tike
Tennessee, attempted to renounce their places in
the Union.
The action of the executive department of the
Government upon this subject has been equally
definite and uniform, and the purpose of the war
was specifically stated in the proclamation issued
by my predecessor, on the 22d day of September.
it was then solemnly proclaimed and de
clared that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be
prosecuted for the object of practically restoring
the constitutional relation between the United
States and each of the States, and the people
thereof, in which States that relation is or may be
suspended or disturbed. The recognition of’the
States by the judicial department of the Govern
ment has also been clear and conclusive in all pro
ceedings affecting them as States, and in the Su
preme, Circuit and District Courts.
QUALIFICATIONS OP MEMBERS.
In the admission of Senators and Representatives
from all the States, there can be no just grounds of
apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be
clothed with the powers of legislation,—for this
could not happen when the Constitution and the
Jaws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Con
fress. Each House is the judge of its own mcra
ers. A Senator or member.. may be admitted or
rejected, or his credentials referred to a proper
committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be on
evidence, satisfactory, that he possesses the requi
site qualifications. If refused admission, and sent
to his constituents for want of due allegiance, they
are admonished that none but persons loyal
to the United States, will be allowed in the
councils of the nation, and the political power and
moral influence of Congress are thus effectively ex
er v< il n P le interests ot loyalty to the Government,
f D u the Union. "Upon this question so vi
tally affecting the restoration of the Union, and
the permanency of our form of government, my
convictions heretofore expressed have undergone
no change, but, on the contrary, their correctness
c °nfirmed by reflection and time. If the
Ju anst, . lon °f loyal members to seats in Congress,
wf.fn'Ji's ancl a year ago, it is no less
timfu vi ®?P edie nt now. If this anomalous condi-

fhZZm, bence, jf these States remain as they are,
the nhhJ r, 'Presentatum will be no stronger, and

*^ UIU justice, than the admission of loyal mem
ber? from the unrepresented State?. It would con
summate restoration, renew.vi"or and stability, al
lay doubt, induce emigration, and open new Helds
of enterprise.
This would consummate the work of restoration,
and exert a most salutary influence on the fe-estab
ment of peace, harmony and fraternal feeling.
It would lead greatly to renew the confidence of
the American people m toe vigor and stability ot
their institutions.—lt would b&d us more, closely
together as a nation, and enable us to show the
world the inherent and recuperative power of a
government founded upon the will of the people,
and established upon the principles of liberty, jus
tice, and intelligence. Our increased strength and
enhanced prosperity would irrefragahly demon
strate tb‘ - lallacy of the arguments against tree in
stitutions. drawn from our recent national disor
ders, by the enemies of Uepublican Government.
The admission of loyal members from the .States
now excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt
and apprehension, would turn capital now awaiting
an opportunity lor an investment, into the channels
of trade and industry—it would alleviate the pre
sent troubled condition of those Suites, and by in
ducing emigration, aid in the settlement of ferule
regions now uncultivated, and lead lo an increased
production of those staples which have added so
greatly to the wealth of the nation, and the com
merce* of the world. New fields of ‘enterprise
would be opened to our progressive people, and
soon the devastations of war would be repaired,
and ail traces of our domestic differences effaced
from the minds of our countrymen.
WASHINGTONS ADVICE.
In our efforts to preserve the unity of govern
ment which constitutes us one people, by restoring
the States to the condition which they held prior to
the rebellion, we should be cautious lest, having
rescued the nation from the perils of the threat
ened disintegration, we resort to consolidation, and,
in the end, absolute despotism, as a remedy for
the recurrence of similar troubles. The war having
terminated, and with it all occasion for the exercise
of powers of doubtful constitutionality, we should
hasteu to bring legislation,within the boundaries
prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to
the ancient landmarks prescribed by our fore
fathers for the guidance of succeedi nggeneral!ons.
The Constitution, which at any time exists until
changed by an explicit and authentic act ol the
whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. If,
in the opinion of the people, the distribution or
modification of the constitutional powers be in any
particular let it be corrected by uu unicud
meui in the wav in which the Constitution cwg
nates; but let there be no change by usurpation
for it is the customary weapon by which free gov
ernments are destroyed. .
Washington spok" these words to his country
men, when, followed by their love an* gratitude,
he voluntarily retired from the cares ol public life.
JEFFERSON.
Keen in all things within the pale of our Consti
tutional powers, and cherish the Federal Union as
the only rock of safety, were prescribed by .Jeffer
son as the, rules of action, to endear to ids country
men the fme principles of their Constitution, and
promote a muon ol sentiment and action equally
audacious to thnir happiness and safety.
Jackson said that the action of the General Gov
ernment should always be strictly confined to the
sphere of its appropriate duties; and justly and
appropriately urged that our Government is not to
he maintained, nor our Union preserved, by inva
sions of the rights and powers of the several.
States. It is true that strength consists in leaving
individuals and States as much as possible to them
selves-in making itself felt, not in its power, but,
in its beneficence—not in binding the States more
closely to the centre, but leaving each to more
unobstructed action in its proper constitutional
orbit.
These are the teachings of men whoso deeds and
sendees made them illustrious, and who, long
since withdrawn from the scenes of life, have lett
to their country the rich legacy, of their counsel,
their wisdom and patriot-term Drawing fresh in
spiration from their lessons, let us emulate (hem in
love of country and respect for the Constitution and
the laws.
TREASURER'S REPORT.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
affords much information respecting the re votive
and commerce of the country, ills views upon
the currency, and with reference to a proper
adjustment of our revenue system, iuteruai.as well
as impost, are commended to llu) .careful consid
eratiou of Congress, in my last annual message
I expressed my general views upon these subjects.
1 need now only call attention to the necessity of
carrying into every department of the Government
a system of rigid accountability, thorough re
trenchment and wise economy. With no excep
tion to so universal expenditures, the oppressive
burdens of taxation can be lessened by such
a modification of our revenue laws as will be con
sistent with the public faith and the legitimate
and necessary wants of the Government. The
report presents a much more satisfactory condi
tion of our finances than one year ago the most
sanguine could have anticipated.
During tlie fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, the
last year of the war, the public debt was increased
$941,902,537, and on the 31st of October, 1865, it
amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 31st day of
October, 1866, it had been reduced to $2,551,310,006,
the diminution during a period of fourteen mouths,
commencing September 1,1865, and eudiug Octo
ber 31.1866, uaving been $306,370,565. In the last
annual report on the state of the finances, it was
estimated that, during the three-quarters of the
fiscal year ending the 30th of June last, the debt
would be increased $113,194,947. During that
period, however, it was reduced $31,196,387, the
receipts of the year having been $89,905,905 more,
and the expenditures $290,539,235 less than the
estimates.
Nothing could more clearly indicate than these
statements the extent arid availability of the na
tional and the rapidity and safety with
which, under our form of government, great mili
tary and naval establishments can be disbanded,
and expenses reduced from a war to a peace foot
ing. During the fiscal year ending 30th of June,
1866, the receipts were "$558.032.620; the expendi
tures $520,750,940, leaving an available surplus of
$37,271,680. It is estimated that the receipts for
the fiscal year ending the 80th of June, 1867. will
he $475,061,386, and that the expenditures will
reach the sum of $316 •128.078, leaving in the Treas
ury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1868, it is estimated that the
receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that the
expenditures will be $350,247,641, showing an
excess of $85,752,359 in favor of the Government.
These estimated receipts may be diminished by
a reduction of excise and import duties; but, after
all necessary reductions shall have been made, the
revenue of the present and following years will
doubtless be sufficient to cover ail legitimate
charges on the Treasury, and leave a large annual
surplus to be applied to the payment of the princi
pal of the debt. There seems now to be no good
reason why taxes may not be reduced as the coun
try advances in population and wealth, and yet the
debt be extinguished within the next quarter of a
century.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR.
The report of the Secretary of War furnishes
valuable and important information in reference to
the affairs of his department during the past year.
Few volunteers remain in the service, and they are
being discharged as rapidly as they can be replaced
by regular troops. The army has been promptly
paid, carefully provided witlj medical treatment,
well sheltered and subsisted, and is to be furnished
with breech-loading small arms.
The military strength of the nation has been un
impaired by the discharge of volunteers. By the
disposition of unserviceable or perishable stores,
and the retrenchment of expenditure, sufficient
tear material to meet any emergency has been
retained, and from the disbanded volunteers stand
ing ready to respond to the national call, large
armies can be rapidly organized, equipped and
concentrated.
Fortifications on the coast and frontier have re
ceived or are being prepared for more powerful
armaments. Lake surveys and harbor and river
improvements arc in course of energetic prose
cution.
Preparations have been made for the payment of
the additional bounties authorized during the re
cent session of Congress, under such regulations as
will protect the Government from fraud and secure
to the honorably discharged soldier the well
earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry.
More than 6,000 maimed soldiers have received
artificial limbs or other serviceable apparatus.
Forty-one national cemeteries, containing the
remains of 101j529 Union soldiers, have already
been established.
The total estimate of military appropriations, is
$25,205,609.
REPORT OP THE SECRETARY’ OF THE NAVY.
It is stated in the report of the Secretary- of the
Navy that the naval force at this time consists of
278 vessels, armed with 2,351 guns. Of these. 115
vessels, carrying 1,029 guns, are in commission,
distributed chiefly among seven squadrons. The
number of men in the service is 13,000.
Great activity and vigilance has been displayed
by all the squadrons, and their movements have
been judiciously and efficiently arranged in such a
manner as would best promote American com
merce and protect the rights and interests ot our
countrymen abroad. The vessels unemployed are
undergoing repairs, and are laid up until their ser
vices may Tie required.
Most of the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in
the vicinity of Philadelphia, a place, which, until
decisive action should be taken by Congress, was
selected by the Secretary of the Navy as the most
eligiole location for that class of vessels- It is im
portant that a suitable public station should be
provided for the iron-clad fleet. It is intended that
these vessels shall be in proper condition for any
emergency, and it is desirable that the bill accept
ing League Island for naval purposes, which passed
the House of Representatives last session, should
receive final action at an early period, in order
that there may be a suitable public station for this
class of vessels, as well as a navy yard of area suf
ficient for the wants of the service on the Delaware
river.
The naval pension fund amounts to $11,750,000,
having been increased $2.750,000 during the year.
The expenditures of the Department for the fiscal
year, ending 30th June last, were $13,324,520, and
the estimates for the coming year amount to $24,-
568.436.
Attention is invited to the condition of seamen,
and the importance of legislative measures for
their relief and improvement. The suggestions on
behalf of this deserving class of our fellow-citizens
are earnestly recommended to the favorable atten
tion of Congress.
REPOKT OP THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.
The report of the Postmaster-General presents a
most satisfactory condition of the postal service,
and submits recommendations which deserve the
consideration of Congress. The revenues of the
Departmenlfor the year ending June 30, 1866, were
$14,386,986, and the expenditures $13,852,079, show
ing an increase of the latter of $935,093. In antici
pation of this deficiency, however, a special appro
priation was made bv Congress in the act approved
Julv 28. 1866. Including the standard appropria
tion of $700,000 for free nail matter, as a legitimate
portion of the revenue yet remaining unexpended,
the actual deficiency' for the past year is only
$265,093, a sum within $51,111 of the amount esti
mated in the annual report of 1861.
The decrease of revenue, compared with the pre
vious year, was one and one-fifth per cent., and
the increase of expenditures, owing principally to
tfio*?nlargeoent of the mall service in the South,
was twelve per cent.
On the 30th of Jane last, there were in operation
routes, wittt an aggregate length of 180,921
miles—an annua! transportation of 71,837,914mi1e5,
and an aggregate annual cost, including all ex
penditures, of SB,-110,184. The length of railroad
routes is 33.093 miles, and the annual transporta
tion 30.(509.107 miles, the length of steamboat
routes is 14,340, miles, and the annual transporta
tion 3.41i.W>2 miles.
The mail service ip rapidly increasing through
out the whole country, mid its steady extension in
the Southern States indicates their constantly im
proving condition.
The growing importance of the foreign service
also merits attention. The Fosloffice Department
of Great Britain and our own have agreed upon a
preliminary basis for anew postal convention,
which, it is believed, will prove eminently bene
ficial to the commercial interests of the United
Slates, as it contemplates a reduction of the inter
national lertet postage to ouc'-half the existing
rates: a reduction of postage with al 1 other coun
tries to and from which correspondence is trans
mitted in the British mail, or in closed mails
throughout the United Kingdom ; the establish
ment of uniform and reasonable charges for these,
and territorial transit of correspondence ru closed
mails, and an allowance to each Postoffice Depart
menr of the right to use all mail communication
established under the authority of the other, lor
the dispatch of correspondence, either in open or
closed mails, on the same terms as those applica
ble to the inhabitants of the country providing the
means of transmission.
ItEPOHT OP THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.
The Deport of the Secretary of the Interior ex
hibits the condition of thpse branches of the pub
lic service l , which are committed to his supervis
ibn.
During the last fiscal year 4.020,313 acres of pub
lic hinds were disposed of, 1,893,510 acres of which
were entered under the homestead act.
The policy originally adopted relative to the pub
lic lands has undergone essential modifications.
Immediate revenue, and not their rapid settlement
was the cardinal feature of our land system. Long
experience and earnest discussion have resulted in
the conviction that the early development of our
agricultural resources, and the'diffusiou of "an ener
getic population over our vast territory, are objects
of far greater importance to the national growth
and prosperty than the proceeds of ihe sale of the
land to tlie highest bidder in open market. The
pre-emption laws confer upon the pioneer who bom
plies with the terms they impose ijie privilege of
purchasing a limited portion of uuoffered lands at
the maximum price. The homestead enactments
relieve the settler from the payment of purchase
money, and secure him a permanent homo upon
the condition of residence fora term of years. This
liberal policy invites emigration from the old and
from the more crowded portions of the now world.
Its propitious results arc undoubted, and will be
more signally manifested when time shall have giv
en to it a wider development.
Congress has made liberal grants of public laud
to Corporations in aid of the construction of rail
roads and other internal’improvements. Should
this policy hereafter prevail, more stringent provis
ions will be required to secure a faithful applica
tion of the fund. The title to the lauds should not
pass by patent or otherwise, but remain in the gov
ernment, and subject to its control until some por
tion of the road inis been actually built. Portions
of them might then, from time to time, be conveyed
to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to
the whole quantity embraced by the grant than the
completed parts near to the entire length of the pro
jected improvement. This restriction would not
operate to the prejudice of any undertaking con
cluded in good faith, and executed with reasonable
energy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw
from market the lands falling within the operation
of such grants, and thus to include the inception of
a subsequent adverse right. A breach of conditions
which Congress jmay deem proper to impose should
work a forfeiture of the claims to the lands so
withdrawn.
Operations on the several lines of the Pacific rail
road have been prosecuted with.unexampled vigor
and success. Should no unforeseen causes of delay
occur, it is confidently anticipated that this great
thoroughfare will be completed before the expira
tion of the period designated by Congress.
During the last fiscal year the amount paid to
pensioners including the expenses of disburse
ment, was 4-13,450,996, and 50,177 names were add
ed to tlie pension rolls. The entire number of pen
sioners on June 30. 1866, was 126,722. This fact
furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the sac
rifices made to indicate the Constitutional authority
of the Government, and to maintain inviolate
the integrity of the Union. They impose upon us
corresponding obligations. It. is estimated that
$33,000,000 will be required to meet tho exigencies
of this brand! of the service during the next fiscal
year.
Treaties have been concluded with the Indians,
who, enticed into armed opposition to our Govern
ment at tlie outbreka of the rebellion, have uncon
ditionally submitted to our authority, and mani
fested au earnest desire for a renewal of friendly re
lations.
During the year ending September 30, 1866, 8,716
patents for useful inventions and designs were is
sued, and at that rate the balance in the trcasiuy
to the credit of the patent fund was $338,207.
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
Asa subject upon which depends an immense
amoimt of the production and commerce of the
country, I recommend Congress to make such
legislation as may he necessary for the preserva
tion of the levees of the Mississippi river. It is a
matter of general importance that early stops
should be taken, not only to add 'o the efficiency
of these barriers against destructive inundations,
but for the removal of all obstructions to the free
and safe navigation of that great channel of trade
and commerce.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The District of Columbia, under existing laws,
is not entitled to that representation in the national
council which from our earliest history has been
uniformly accorded to each Territory, established
from time to time, within our limits. ’ it maintains
peculiar relations to Congress, to whom the Con
stitution has granted the power of exercising ex
clusive. legislation over the State government. Our
fellow-citizens residing in tho District, whose
interests are thus confided to the special guardian
ship of Congress, exceed iu number the population
of several of our Territories, and no just reason is
perceived why a Delegate of their choice should
not be admittc and to a seat iu the House of Repre
sentatives. Ni> mode seems so appropriate and
effectual of enabling them to make known their
peculiar condition and wants, and of securing the
local legisliition adopted to them. J therefore re
commend the passage of a law authorizing the
electors of the District of Columbia to choose a
Delegate to be allowed the same rights and privi
leges as a Delegate representing a Territory. The
increasing enterprise and rapid progress of im
provement in the District are highly gratifying,
and I trust that the efforts of the municipal au
thorities to promote the prosperity of the National
metropolis will receive the efficient and generous
co-operation of Congress.
AGRICULTURE.
Tlie report of the Commissioner of Agriculture
reviews the operations of his department during
the past year, and asks the aid of Congress iu its
efforts to encourage those States, which, scourged
by war, are now earnestly engaged in the reorgan
ization of domestic industry.
OUK FOREIGN RELATIONS.
It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign
combination against our domestic peace and safety
or our legitimate influence among the nations,
have been formed or attempted. While senti
ments of reconciliation, loyalty and patriotism
have increased at home, a more just consideration
of our national character and rights has been
manifested by foreign nations.
INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.
The entire success of the Atlantic telegraph be
tween the coast of Ireland and the province of
Newloitndland is an achievement which has been
justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the open
ing of an era in the civilization. There
is reason to expect that equal success will attend,
and even greater results lollow the enterprise for
connecting the two continents through the Pacific
Ocean by the projected line of telegraph between
Kamschatka and the Russian Possessions in
America. -f *'
VARIOUS SUBJECTS.
The resolution of Congress protesting against
pardons by foreign Governments of persons con
victed of infamous offences, on condition of emi
gration to our country, has been communicated to
the States with which we maintain intercourse, and
the practice so justly the subject of complaint on
our part has not been renewed.
The congratulations of Congress to the Emperor
of Russia upon his escape from attempted assassi
nation, have been presented to that humane and
enlightened ruler, and received by him with ex
pressions of grateful appreciation.
The Executive, warned cf an attempt by Spauish-
American adventurers to induce the emigration of
freedmen of the United States to foreign coun
try. protested against the project as one which, if
consummated, would reduce them to a bondage
even more oppressive than that from which they
have hist beeu relieved. Assurance has been re
ceived from the. Goverment of the State in which
the plan was matured, that the proceeding will
meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It
is a question worthy of your consideration whether
our laws on this subject are adequate to the pre
vention and punishment of the crime thus medi
tated.
THE MEXICAN QUESTION.
In the month of April last, as Congress is aware,
a friendly arrangement was made between the Em
peror of Franco and the President for the with
drawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary
forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in
three detachments, —the first of which it was under
stood was to leave Mexico in November, the second
in March, and the last in November, 1867. Imme
diately on the completion of the evacuation, the
French Government waste ass tune the same atti
tude in regard to non-intervention as held by the
Government of ihe United States. Repeated assur
ances have been given by the Emperor, since that
agreement, that he would complete the promised
evacuation within the period named, or even sooner.
It was reasonable to expect that the proceedings
thus contemplated wouldproduce a cns;s of great
political interest in the Republic of Mexico. The
newly appointed Minister of the United States. Mr.
Campbell, was therefore sent forward on \ jvetnber
9, to assume ins functions. It was also thought ex
pedient that he should be attended in Mexico, bv
the Lieutenant General of the United States armv,
with the view of obtaining- such information as
might lie important to determine the course to be
pursued by the United States, m re-establishing and
maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with
Mexico, Deeply interested in the course of liberty
and humanity, it seemed an-obvious duty on our
part to exercise whatever influences are possessed
for the restoration and permanent establishment in
that country of a Democratic and Republican form
of government. Such was the conditiou of affairs
in regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d day of No
vember, official information was received from
Paris that the Emperor had some time before de
cided not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in
the month of November, according to agreement;
but that this decision was made for the purpose of
withdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensu
ing spring. Uf this latter determination, however,
| the United States has received no notice or intima
| tion, and, so soon as information was received from
this Government, care was taken to make known
t its dissent to the Emperor of France. I cannot
; forego the hope that France will reconsiderthe sub
ject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the
I evacuation of Mexico, which will conform to the
i existing engagement, and meet the expectations of
; this Government. The documents on the subject
I will be laid before Congress. With the evacuation
of Mexico by the French, no subject for serious
differences between Prance and the United States
would remain.
The expressions of the Emperor and people of
Franco, warrant a hope that the traditionary friend
ship between the two countries might in that case
be renewed and permanently restored. A claim of
a citizen of tae United Stated for indemnity for
spoliations committed on the high seas by the
French authorities, in the exercise of a belligerent
power against Mexico, has been met by the Gov
ernment of Prance with a proposition to (Wer set
tlement until a mutual convention for tl adjust
ment of all claims of citizens and subject*, of both
countries, arising out of the ecent wars on this
continent, shall be agreed upon by the two coun
tries. The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable,
but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in
which claims for indemnity by foreigners, as well
as by citizens of the United States, arising out of
the late civil war, shall be adjudicated and deter
mined. I have no doubtthat the subject of all such
claims will engross your attention at a convenient
and proper time.
ORBAT BRITAIN.
It is a matter of regret that no considerable ad
vance has been made towards an adjustment of the
difference between the United States and Great
Britain, arising out of the depredations on our com
merce. and other trespasses committed during the
civil war, by British subjects, in violation of inter
national law an’ treaty obligations. The delay,
however, may be believed to have resulted in. no
small degree from the domestic situation of Great
Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred in
that country during the last session of Parliament.
The attention of the new ministry was called to the
subject, at au early day, and there is some reason
to believe that it will be considered in a becoming
and friendly spirit. The importance of an early
disposition of the question cannot be exaggerated.
Whatever might be the wishes of the government,
it is manifest that good feeling and friendship be
tween the two countries cannot be established until
a reciprocity in the practice of good faith and neu
trality shall be restored between the respective na
tions.
Tin; FENIAN INVASION OF CANADA.
On the 6th of June last, in .violation of our neu
trality laws, a military enterprise against the British
North American coionics was projected and at
tempted to be carried on within the territory mid
jurisdiction of the United States. lu obedience of
the obligation imposed upon the Executive by the
Constitution, to see that the laws are faithfully ex
ecuted, all citzens were warned by proclamation
against taking part in or aiding such unlawful pro
ceedings, and the proper civil, military and naval
officers were directed to take all necessary meas
ures for the enforcement of the laws. The expedi
. tion failed, but it has not been without its painful
consequences. Some of our citizens, whom it was
alleged were engaged in the expedition, were
brought to trial, as for a capital offence,'in the
province of Canada, Judgment and sentence of
death have beer pronounced against some, while
others have beer acquitted. Fully believing in the
maxim of government, that severity of civil pun
ishment for misguided persons who have engaged
in revolutionary attempts, which have disastrously
failed, is unsound and unwise, euch|ropreseutatiouß
have been made to the British Government, in tie
half of the convicted persons, as, being sustained
by au enlightened and humane judgment, will, it
is to be hoped, Induce in their cases an act of clem
ency and a judicious amnesty to all who were en
gaged in the movement. Counsel has noen em
ployed by the Government to defend citizens of the
United States on trial for capital offences in
Canada, and a discontinuance ot the prosecutions
which were instituted in courts of the United
States against those who took part in the expedi
tion has -neon directed. 1 have regarded the expe
dition as not only political in its nature, but as also
in a great measure foreign from the United States,
in causes, character and objects.
The attempt was understood to be made in sym
pathy with an insurgent party iu Ireland, and,by
striking at a British province on this continent,
was designed to aid in obtalng redress
for political grievances which it was
assumed the people of Ireland had suffered
at the hands of the British Government, dur
ing a period of several centuries. The persons
engaged in it were chiefly natives of that country,
some of whom had, while others had not, become
citizens of the United States, under our general
laws of naturalization. Complaints of miagovern
ment in Ireland continually engage the attention
of the British nation, and so great an agitation is
now prevailing in Ireland that"the British Govern
ment have deemed it necessary to suspend the
writ of habeas corpus in that country. These cir
curastances must necessarily modify the opinion
which we might otherwise have entertained iu re
gard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our
neutrality laws. So long as these laws remain
upon our statute books they should 1; 3 faithfully
executed, and if they operate harshly, unjustly or
oppressively, Congress alone can apply the remedy
by their modification or repeal.
THE EASTERN QUESTION.
The political and commercial interests of the
United States are not unlikely to be affected in
some degree by events which arc transpiring in
the eastern regions of Europe, and the time seems
to have come when our Government ought to have
a proper diplomatic representation in Greece.
NATURALIZATION.
The Government has claimed for all persons not
convicted, or accused, or suspected of crime, an
absolute political. right of self-expatriation and a
choice of new national allegiance. .Most of the
European Males have dissented from this princi
ple, and have claimed a right to hold such ot their
subjects as have immigrated to and been natural
ized in the United States, and afterwards returned
on transient visits to their native countries, to the
performance of military service in like manner as
resident subjects. Complaints arising from the
claims in this respect madejby foreign States, have
heretofore been a matter of controversy between
the United States and some of the European Pow
ers, and the invitation consequent upon the failure
to settle this question increased during the war in
which Prussia, Italy and Austria were recently
engaged. While Great Britain has never acknowl
edged the right of expatriation, she has not prac
tically insisted upon it. France has been equally
forbearing, and Prussia has proposed a compro
mise, which, although evincing increased liberal
ity, has not been accepted by the United States.
Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe,
and the present seems te be a favorable time for an
assertion by Congress o, the principle so long
maintained by the Executive Department, that natu
ralization by one State fully exempts the native born
subject of any other State'from the performance of
military service under any foreign government, so
long as he does voluntarily renounce its rights and
benefits.
CONCLUSION.
In the performance of a duty imposed by the Con
stitution, I nave thus submitted to the representa
tives of the States and the people, such information
of our domestic and foreign aftairs as the public in
terests may require. Our Government is now un
dergoing its most trying ordeal, and my earnest
prayer is that the peril may be successfully and
finally passed without impairing its original
strength and symmetry. The interests of the na
tion are beet to be. promoted by the revival of fra
terua' relations, the complete obliteration of our
past differences, and tl e inauguration of all the
pursuits ot peace. Diret Lng our efforts to the ac
complishment of these great ends, let us endeavor
to preserve harmony between the co-ordinate de
partments of the'-Government, that each, in its
proper sphere, may cordially co-operate with the
other in securing the maintenance of the Constitu
tion, the preservation of the Union and the perpe
tuity of Iree institutions.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
Washington, December 3,1866.
Report, of’ the Commissioner of
the Freedmen’s llnreaa.
General Howard's report will show that there is
no special change in the organization of the Freed
men s Bureau, but that the business has been
greatly facilitated by the law of 1800. The districts
assigned to Assistant Commissioners coincides
with the military departments and district com
mands. The new law embraces Kentucky and
Maryland, and these States require the aid of the
Bureau in promoting the interests of justice and
education, fn the Northern cities, employment
offices of little expense to the Government, and
not a source of revenue, have been established,
with a view to obtain work and homes for depend
ent freed people, and to relieve crowded localities.
The importance of self-support has been urged by
proper means upon the laboring classes. Wages
nave been determined, not by the orders of the
Bureau officers, but by the cii umstauces ordinarily
affecting the price of labor in different localities.
The education of freedmen and refugees has been
carried on vigorously, under the immediate patron
age of benevolent societies. A Superintendent of
Education, devoting his whole time to his work, is
stationed at the Bureau headquarters in each State,
and all Bureau offices co-operate with him. It is
estimated that 150,000 freedmen and their children
are now attending school in the Southern States.
Schools for refugees—white children—are also
established. Their formation is everywhere en
couraged by the Bureau. There has been hut
little uniformity of action in the diliereut Slates in
respect to the administration of justice. Assistant
Commissioners have been instructed to transfer
military jurisdiction as rapidly as possible to State
tribunals. This has been done completely in some
States, while in Virginia. Louisiana and Texas,
Bureau courts are still in existence. A claim
division, instituted in March last, and aided by
officers and agents throughout the States, lias
sought to prevent the frauds upon colored soldiers
iu their efforts to collect unpaid claims. One bun
dred and ninety-live claims were paid through the
office of the commissioner; 723 rejected at his
office ; 1,532 are in process of adjustment. The
aggregate amount collected and paid is $10,539.
Detailed reports are given of the operations
of the Bureau iu each State, and the District
of Columbia. Transportation is reported as
furnished to 6,352 destitute freed people,
and 387 refugees ; 13,412,273 rations were issued be
tween June Ist. 1862, and September 1, 1866. The
average number per month to refugees and freed
meu was 894,569; the average number per day, 29,-
819.. The issue to whites iucreased until June 30,
1866, when issues to freedmen and refugees were
about equal. From June 30, 1866, until September
1, the number supported of both classes has dimin
ished. Kigid scrutiny lias been exercised to pre
vent issues to any but the absolutely destitute, and
part of the rations not actually needed were cut
off’. Officers were directed to hold each plantation,
county, parish and town, responsible for the care of
its own poor, to very little purpose, for. with few
exceptions, the State authorities have failed to con
tribute to the relief of the class of persons support
ed by the Government.
Owing to the failure of crops, the requirements !
of the circular of the 10th of August, 1862, couid |
not be rigidly enforced upon the application of
the State officials. Special issues are now being
made certain States- for the support of their pauper
population. Kations are sold to teachers and
agents of benevolent societies, under the same
rules that apply to such purchases made by com
missioned officers. The Bureau hospitals receive
the usual freedmen’s rationt
The amount of land now in possession of the
Bureau is 872.251 acre-, to bo increased by 228
tracts in Tennessee, of gulch the number of acres
has not been reported. The aggregate number of
parcels of town property, not included in the
above, which have been nx possession of the Bu
reau, is 3,724, of which 2,603 have been restored,
leaving a balance of 1,190 parcels of town pro
perty.
The Commissioner estimates the additional funds
necessary for the next fiscal year at §3,830,000.
In accordance with the recent enactments. Com
missioners to assess the value of slaves enlisted in
to the array have been appointed in Maryland, Ken
tucky, Missouri and Tennessee.
Report of the Secretary of War.
In the War Office the work of mustering out
troops has been actively continued. From January
20th to March 9th, 982 volunteers have been mus
tered out, leaving n the service 11,043 volunteers,
white and colored. The reduction of colored troops
has been 75.024, and on November Ist 10.000 officers
and enlisted men remained in service. The reduc
tion of the army has been attended by greatly re-'
duced expenditures. The advanced depot of the
Quartermaster's Department have been broken up
and great quantities of material have h um sold at
advantageous rates, or packed in f.ve principal
depots and arsencls, and all unnecessary employees
discharged.
From May Ist, 1865, to August 2d, 1866. over
207,000 horses and mules wore sold for $15,269,075.54.
About 4,400 barracks and hospitals and other build
ings have been sold during the yearfor $447,883.14.
The sales of irregular and damaged clothing in
store produced, during the fiscal year, the sum of
$902,770.-15. The fleet of 590 ocean transports in
service on July Ist, 1865, at a daily expense of §82,-
400, was reduced, before Juno 30th. 1866, to fifty
three vessels costing §3,000 per diem, and most of
these have since been discharged, ocean transpor
portatiou being now almost entirely conducted by
established commercial lines of steamers. Of 252
vessels, which had been employed in inland trans
portation, at an expense of §3,193.333.28—n0ne
were remaining in service on June 30th, 18,<6: The
sales of river transports', steamers and barges (lur
ing the year, are reported as amounting to $1.152,-
895.92. The rates of wagon transportation in the
Indian country have alsobcen reduced by favorable
contracts. The military railroads which were
operated during the war at a total expenditure of
§45,423,719.15, and which were officially reported to
have reached an extent of 2,63014 miles, and to
have possessed 433 engines and 6,605 cars, have all
been transferred to companies or boards of public
works, upon condition of the adoption of loyal
organizations of directors. Cash sales of railroad
equipments, to the amount of $3 466.939.33 are re
ported, and credit sales of §7,444,073.28, upon the
latter. There have been paid, principal and inter
est, §12,000.858.18, leaving due to the United
States, on June 30th, 1856, principal and interest,
§6,570,074.05.
The Military Telegraph, which attained au extent
of 15,489 miles of line constructed during the pe
riod of hostilities, with a total expenditure of
§3,219,400 during the war, and $507,637 during the
last flsca 1 year, has been discontinued, the material
sold and disposed of, and the employees discharged
only a few confidential operators being still rctaiixed
for cypher correspondence with commanders of
important districts.
General hospitals, hospital transports and rail
road trains, ambulance corps, and a number of
medical purveying departments have been dis
pensed with, and :i! I perishable articles, of medical
and hospital supplies, in excess of the requirements
of a peace establishment, have been disposed of at
public sales at advantageous rates', and the reserved
supplies concentrated at five depots. The proceeds
of old or surplus medical and hospital property
amount to §1,041.261.59.
Annual Report of Use Secretary
oi'tlic Treasury,
New York, Nov. 29,
A epeclal to the World from Washington,
November 28th, says : “ The forthcoming
report of the Secretary of the Treasury on
the national finances has been completed
and printed for distribution to the country
on the day of its presentation to Congress.
The views which it will present will not be
new, in so far as a line of financial policy
will be laid down, yet the resume of the
facta and figures will show the national
financial situation to be in a much more flat
tering condition than at the opening of the
first session of the Thirty-ninth Congress,
or at the close of the fiscal v ear ending J une
30, 1805.
The coming report will show that the fis
cal year ending June 30, 1866, was one of
great prosperity. The balance in the Treas
ury on that day stood as follows : Cash on
hand June 30, 1865, $858,309 15; cash on
hand June 30. 1866, $130,669,815.19—net
gain, $120,811,606 04.
The gold on hand was not estimated at a
currency value, or the balanoa would have
exceeded $150,000,000.
Tne receipts and expenditures for the
years 1865 and ’66, for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 2866, are as follows ; Receipts
from customs, in gold, $179,046,630.64;
from public bonds, $665,031.03 ; from di
rect tax, $1,974,754.12; from internal rev
enue, $300.226,812.81; and miscellaneous
sources, $65,125,966.46; total receipts from
all sources, $556,039,195 06. This revenue,
it is believed, exceeds in amount that of any
other nation on the globe for the same pe
riod.
The expenditures during the same period
were as follows : civil, foreign and miscel
laneous, $41,040,905,96; pensions and In
dians, $16,253,800,44; war, 284,449,701.82;
navy, $23,619,632.21; interest, $;33,074,-
737.27 ; total, $518,347,337.70.
Total receipts, $556,039,196 06. Total
expenditures, $518,347,337 70. Excess of
receipts, $37,091,857.36. This excess of
receipts all occurred during the last few
months of the fiscal year, and it is not a fair
criterion of the ability of the Government
to liquidate its debt. For instance, the
war expenses for the quarter ending Sep
tember 30th, 1865, were $165,000,000, but
during the quarter ending June 30th, 1866,
they were $12,000,000.
The balance in the Treasury on June 30,
1865, was but $858,309.15 The year end
ing Dec 31st, 1865, showed a deficiency
in the Treasury of $619,000,000, but six
months from the time, June 30, 1866, there
was an excess of receipts over expenditures
of nearly $37,000,000.
The estimates of the War Department for
expenditures for the coming fiscal year
would be nearly $240,000,000 less than for
1855, were it not for the equalizing bounty
bill, passed at the last session. But the rev
enue from all sources, for ibe next fiscal
year, is estimated by the Secretary in the
neighborhood of $600,000,000.
The full expenditure for the next fiscal
year is estimated within $350,000,000, in
cluding interest on the matured debt and a
fair sum over for a sinking fund.
The Treasury has withdrawn from circu
lation during tne past tix months the limit
of $10,000,000 of paper money. The total
amount of United States legal tender notes
in circulation is therefore $380,000,000.
The most important and gratifying part
of the report will bo on the reduction of
the public debt. It will be shown that the
public debt has been reduced, during the
past twelve months, fully $200,000,000.
The actual figures of the redaction are
$193,637,721.
Seven millions of compound interest
notes, legal tender for their face, have been
canceled, and temporary loans reduced nine
millions. The full amount of currency au
thorized for National Banks has been issued,
which, with the United States notes, give a
circulating medium of nearly $700,000,000,
not including the fractional currency. On
the first of last November, the total, in
cluding the fractional currency, amounted
to $732,218,038 20 and $95,000,000 of au
thorized National Bank notes rem; hied un
issued.
The Secretary of the Treasury will not
present anew plan for returning to specie
payments. He has changed none of the
views he maintained in his last report. He
believes the Secretary of the Treasury
should have power to control tbe currency
to the extent of being authorized at his dis
cretion to sell bonds bearing interest not
exceeding per cent,, and redeemable
and payable at such periods as may be con
ducive to the interests of the Government,
for the purpose of retiring all United States
bonds.
He will ask Congress to authorize a Jong
five per cent, bond, to be exempt from taxa
tion, with which to fund the obligations
that are soon to mature. He will lay great
stress on the question of urging Congress to
adopt, at an early day, a fixed policy of
contraction, which, when adopted, will
cause business of the country to gravitate
to a specie basis, which can be reached
without a great diminution of the revenues
or a wide-spread financial panic. He does
not propose to state any definite terms for
the resumption of specie payment, but be
lieves that with a proper system it can be
attained with the retirement of over two
hundred millions of United States notes.
It will bo shown that the Government is
on a high road of prosperity in reducing
the national debt, and the Treasury will
cling to the simple and experienced policy
of liquidating the debt by keeping (he na
tional revenue above the national expendit
ures. To this end a draft of a bill, prepared
by Mr. Willis, Special Revenue Commission
er, will be submitted, proposing an equali
zation in internal taxation, and a modifica
tion of the existing tariff.
Important reference will also be made lo
the raw cuttou tax of three cents per pound
imnosed last session
In 1867 and 1808, $830,000,000 of 7-30s
fall due. A large amount of the first series
are now being funded iu 5-20 bonds.
Improvements in the National banking
system will be suggested and urged.
