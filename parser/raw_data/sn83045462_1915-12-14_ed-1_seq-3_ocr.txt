FLEA FOR HOSPITAL
With Cabinet and Japan's En
voy, Attends Meeting for
Tokio Institutiqp.
BISHOP OF BRAZIL TELLS
WHY AMERICA SHOULD AID
Eishop Harding Presides, and Ma
rine Detachment Pays Honor to
U. S. and Nippon's Flags.
President Wilson, Mr. Lansing, the
Secretary of State: the Japanese am
bassador and members of the cabinet,
to say nothing: of a large audience of
others, were told yesterday afternoon
at Continental Memorial Hall that the
best way to prove there is a real and
lasting: friendship between Japan and
the United States and the peoples of
the two countries is to continue the ef
fort to build the International Hospital
at Tokio, already begun, with Ameri
can money.
Bishop Ivinsolving of Brazil, who had
not been announced as one of the
speakers on the program of a meeting
which attracted many persons, struck!
the keynote of the meeting when he
pointed out the slogan of the Rocke
feller Foundation ? "Demonstrate It."
He declared this to be the idea at the
base of everything that is proposed
for {fie Rockefeller Foundation to take
up, and he said that some of the Japa
nese in this country and in Japan are
tired of hearing that Americans are
so foiVd of the Japanese. They want
the fact demonstrated, Bishop Kin
solving said.
Distinguished Audience.
The President, the Secretary of State
and the others listened to the words of
advice that were given by speakers
who have recently returned from Japan.
It was not expected any of the public
men who were present would have any
thing to say. It was understood that
they lent force to the arguments of
the speakers by their presence, and that
in their individual capacities they de
sired to support the humanitarian idea,
which is at the root of the appeal that
there shall be established in Tokio a
great international hospital.
Mrs. Gait, the President's fiancee, was
present also, as well as Miss Wilson,
his daughter; Mrs. Lansing, Mrs. Gar
rison, Mrs. Daniels and .the other wom
en of the cabinet. Viscountess Chinda
accompanied the Japanese ambassador,
and other officials of the Japanese em
bassy and their wives were present.
Every one rose when the Japanese na
tional anthem was played by the Ma
rine Band, as well as .when "The Star
Spangled Banner" was plaj-ed upon the
entrance of the President, and United
States soldiers, sailors and marines
stood at rigid attention upon the plat
form throughout the meeting, in charge
of the Stars and Stripes and the im
perial Japanese flag, both of which were
unfurled with military ceremony and
precision.
Bishop Harding Presides.
Bishop Harding presided, by reason of
the fact that the Episcopal Church i*
endeavoring to aid the project of build
ing the hospital, for which the sum of
1230,000 has already been raised. Its
total cost is expected to be $500,000. No
subscriptions were asked or given at
the meeting, which was solely for the
purpose of drawing attention to the
great opportunity there is to do good.
It was announced that the Emperor of
Japan has contributed $25,000 toward
the fund, and that a group of public
men, headed by Count Okuma, in Japan,
have contributed $50,000 more toward
the project. It was also announced that
citizens of the United States have con
tributed $70,000 or more, and fcnat there
are already pledges which bring the
total sums so far subscribed from citi
zens of both nations up to the $230,000
mentioned.
In addition to the remarks oi* Bishop
Harding and Bishop Kinsolvin?, ad
dresses were made by Mrs. Ctiarles
Rodman Pancoast of Philadelphia and
Dr. Rudolf B. Teusler, a native of Vir
ginia. Both have labored long and hard
in the interest of the hospital in Tokio
and have recently returned to the
United States, to tell at first hand their
stories of conditions in Japan.
Dr. Teusler was highly praised for his
u ruse I fish and devoted work, and in speak
ing of the qualifications and competency
of Virginians, alluding to Dr. Teusler,
Bishop Kinvolving told a story which sent
his audience into roars of laughter. He
jpoke of a John Jasper, a colored preacher
of former days in Virginia, who had de
clared there were four races of man.
These, he said, were '?Hottentots* Hugue
nots, Abyssinians and Virginians."
Bishop Xinsolving's Address.
Bishop Kinsolving said, in part:
"You cannot say in these days that
Japan is so remote as it once was. We
are all, all over the world, nowadays, like
people in the different compartments of
a sleeping car. if you will forgive me for
the illustration, all of us able to hear
each other snore. Why, how the world
has shrunk! We. who receive so much
that Japan has to give the world, to give
us. what shall we say to her, in her need''
Never, perhaps, again will the opportunity
come to us to make such a generous re
sponse, to prove to her that we are her
friend. Is the United States to continue
to boast of her own prosperity, to shine
only in the glitter of her gold, dulled per
haps because it may become tarnished
when hidden away? You cannot be so
mean as to go away from this meeting
without making a generous response, in
the end. Take home the significance of
this meeting, study it, and see what you
have the opportunity to do."
Mrs. Pancoast described some of the
most beautiful lantern slide pictures of
Japan that have ever been presented to a
Washington audience, and held her audi
ence spellbound with views of scenery
that elicited constant applause. She told
of the founding of the International
Hospital in Tokio, and some of the views
she presented Illustrated the units of the
hospital as it is so far in working order.
l?r. Teusler dealt principally with the
practical side of the hospital, describing it
as "a 150-bed hospital."
Hospital Needed for Foreig^netrs.
"Japan," Dr. Teusler said, "is well
equipped with hospitals. They have there
doctors the equal of any in this country
or Europe. Tokio has Just as good prac
tical or theoretical relief as anywhere.
But they are not equipped to take care
of our people?of foreigners. They
should not be expected to do so on the big
scale upon which foreigners visit there."
Dr. Teusler, Mrs. Pancoast, Bish<$ Kin
solving and Bishop Harding all took the
view in their addresses that Washington
Christians will accept what they called
"the challenge" of Japanese toward the
building of the hospital, by reason Of the
great gifts of Japanese toward the hos
pital.

FOR PEACE TALKS
Topic of Addresses at Session
of the Southern Commer
cial Congress.
MESSAGE OF GREETING
BY PRESIDENT WILSON
Speakers Emphasize Advantages Ac
cruing From Lack of Strife in the
Western Hemisphere.
I CHARLESTON, S. C., December 14.?
Today was set asule by the Southern
Commercial Congress, in session here,
as "peace day," with virtually all the
addresses of the various sessions de-!
voted to advantages accruing to Amer
ica from the lack of strife on the west
ern hemisphere as compared with the
warring Europe. James Brown Scott,
special adviser of the State Depart
ment. and Arthur D. Call, secretary of
the American Peace Society, wore here
to deliver addresses. S. Perez Triana of
Colombia was expected to arrive during
the day, and was placed on the pro
gram to speak on "Peace and Pan
America."
Representatives of the league to en
force peace were to have charge of th#? 1
night session, with Phillip H. Gadsden
of Charleston, a member of the board
of directors of the league, presiding.
Among speakers announced for the
night session were Dr. Abbott Law
rence Lowell, president of Harvard
University; Herbert S. Houston, connect
ed with the league; Oscar Straus,
former Secretary of Commerce and
Labor, and John H. Stewart of New
York.
Mr. Marburg's Theme.
An address on. "International An
archy," which was?to have been deliv
ered by Theodore Marburg, former
United States minister to Belgium, it
was announced, will be read to the
congress. It was explained that Mr.
Marburg had sailed for Europe to be
with his son. who was wounded while
fighting with the British army in
Flanders.
"The outlook before the people of the
United States has changed," declared
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president
of Columbia University. New York, in
an address last night. Dr. Butler urged
that the United States prepare to aid
Europe at the end of the war in set- !
ting up its ''overturned political fabric" i
upon democratic principles. "There is]
much earnest speech among us in re- j
gard to national preparedness," he',
said, "and it is urged by many and in- !
fiuential voices that we beware lest i
the calamity that fell so suddenly upon {
Europe should be forced upon us."
The chief task of the United States,
he said, is to prepare to "bind up the
wounds of a stricken world and to lead
the way to that new construction of
the overturned political fabric which,
if it is to endure, can rest upon no
other principles than those of democ
racy, of freedom, of civil liberty, of in
ternational responsibility and honor, tp
which we express such earnest alle
giance and through faith in which we
have grown great."
Plea for Woman Suffrage.
The afternoon session yesterday was j
given over to the woman's auxiliary, j
In a plea for equal suffrage for women j
Miss Kate Gordon of New Orleans de- j
dared that it pleased her that the men
of the Southern Commercial Congress !
had recognized the need of co-opera
tion of southern women in their work, j
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo !
and John Barrett, director general of j
the Pan-American Union,, both of;
whom addressed the congress yester- ;
day, left for Washington after attend- j
ing a dinner given by Gov. Manning in
honor of themselves and Gov. Stuart
and official representatives of other
southern states.
In his address Secretary McAdoo de
clared that "an obvious duty confronts
the nation." The first necessity, he
said, was to provide for the nation's
physical safety, and the second to se
cure its economic safet3'. He asserted
that both could be aided by establish
ment of a merchant marine. Mr. Mc
Adoo brought to the congress the per
sonal greetings of President Wilson.
The President also expressed his good
wishes for tne congress in a telegram.

U.S. NEEDS DYESIUFFS
FOR FFS PAPER MONEY
Bureau of Engraving and Printing i
Chemists Are Experimenting on
Substitute for German Supply.
\
The production of paper currency of
the United States is embarrassed by a
shortage in colors. The situation is
difficult, and prows more so every aay.
The chemists of the bureau of engrav
ing: and printing- are experimenting in
efforts to find domestic substitutes for
the usual and lacking German stock to
meet the situation.
Tills is told of in the annual report of j
Joseph E. Ralph, director of the bu- j
reau of engraving and printing. At the!
beginning of the war in Europe he
cornered the available supply in 1 lie
United States, but this has already been
exhausted and subterfuges employed '
for?the production of printed paper
money. i
Cornered German Supply.
Great difficulty was experienced dur
ing the year in procuring supplies of
standard shades of certain dry colors.
The bases of these colors are materials
made only in Germany. By prompt
action at the beginning of the Euro
pean war, Director Ralph procured all
the available supplies at from 100 to
200 per cent less than the prices thatj
afterward prevailed.
These supplies were not sufllcient for j
the year, however. It was necessary !
to use such other materials as could
be obtained and which approximated
the requirements. By mixture of these
various materials the standard shades
were fairly well maintained.
Still More Trouble Expected.
The embarrassment continues. From
the present outlook it will give greater
trouble during the current year.
Director Ralph complains of the con
dition of the sidewalks and roadways
surrounding the bureau- as in a de
plorable condition and unfit for the
| use of employes and tlie thousands of
visitors that go to the bureau. He
urges that an estimate of the cost of
sidewalks, curbing and grading be sub
mitted to Congress for an appropria
tion.

"? TH EN the day closes and I draw down
y V the curtains it sometimes seems that
a tender little piece is what I want.
So I often take the dainty little 'Humoresque*
of Dvorak's ? a difficult piece perhaps on the
piano ? but on the Pianola?!
"My wife tells me I play the 'Humoresque'
with really delightful feeling?I who never
knew a note of music, whose stiff fingers never
1 could have learned tcr play a note on the old
fashioned pianoforte. A gentle pressure of my
feet upon the pedals and all the pretty tenderness of
beautiful melody is reflected in the sound. Now I
move the Metrostyle lever to the left to keep the slow, slow
languor of it. Now 1 move it to the right, and all the charming,
humorous playfulness of this little gem lilts briskly along. Here the
Themodist, without thought from me, brings the delicate melody out,
not loudly but with just the proper emphasis. Here the Sustaining
Pedal device gives it the lovely singing tone. The instrument sounds
human?so exquisite is its response. There is nothing of the hard, pre
cise quality of the ordinary player piano. It is reflecting absolutely the
subtlest color of my music feeling. It is teaching me to interpret. It
is helping me to gain musical effects too complex for me to think about.
"And my practice on the Pianola has been so short and so enjoyable
and easy. And I have the satisfaction of producing music which is real;
of accomplishing something?of actually playing so that my wife and
friends love to listen to me."

Have you ever stopped to wonder why
the Pianola has become so well-known in
snch a short time? Perhaps you do not
know that in every civilized country in tbe
world it is just as popular as it is here.
It is because the Pianola is a really
marvellous instrument with which you can
not only play the piano ? but play it with
truly musical feeling. This is the impor
tant part, and this is why the Pianola has
been endorsed by every great musician of
the world, and why it differs so immeasur
ably from all the so-called player pianos
which try to imitate it.
We are sole representatives of the genu
ine Pianola in this city, and we handle no
