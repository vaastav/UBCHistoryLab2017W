I'ArTS Anot'T Storm-. A vast amount
0 -idoiiiut.,,11 is constantly being gathered
"J-i-ei:-,', d by the United States S gnal
krrv" '- respecting sfotms, out of which is
11 g gradually built up the true science
' tr,ft eui (, nicteorological phenotoena.
-ttifirig the gtneral observations thus far
'ol may be mentioned the following :
-'J! ins are accompanied with a depres-
'"u -he barouieter near the central line
of the storm, an-i a rise of tho barometer
n the from and rear.
This central l ne of minimum pressure is
generally of a great length from North to
South, and moves side-loremost toward the
sea.
This line is sometimes nearly straight,
but generally curved, and most frequently
.vitn its convex side toward the Ex?t.
The velocity of this line is t-.uch that it
travels from the Mississippi to the Con
uectieut river iu about twenty-four hours,
ind Ironi the Connecticut to i-t. Johu's,
NewfuunJliuJ, in nearly the same tune, or
about tuirty-six miles an hour.
V hen the barometer falls suddenly in the
western part cfJN'ew E jgland, it rises a.
the same time in the valley ot the Missis
sippi, and also at S . John's, Newlbuud
an J.
In great storms the wind fur several
hundred miles on both sides of the line ot
minimum pressure blows towarl that line
directly or obliquely.
Ihe force of the wind is in proportion
to the suddenness aud greatness of the de
pression of the barometer.
In all great aud sudden epresjions of
the barometer there is tnuh rain or snow ;
and in all sudden great rains or snovr there
is a great depression of the barometer near
the center of the storm, aud a rise beyond
its birders.
-Many storms are of great and ur.known
ength from North to S .uth, reaching
beyouJ our observers on the (J u!f of Mexico
nd on the Northern lakes, while their
Hist and West diameter is comparative! v
mall. Ihe storms therefore tnoce side-
foremost.
Most storms commence in the "far
U'est,"' beyond our most Western observ
ers, but some commence in tho Luitcd
States.
W hen a storm commences in the I'nited
rates the line of minimum pressure does
not come from the ' far West," but com
mence with the !-torm, and travels with it
toward the Eistwar l.
Tnere is generally a lull of wiud at the I
ine of minimum pic-sure, and sumetime.- '
calm.
When this line of minimum prc.-.-urc !
parses an ob.-erver toward the Ei-r, ihe!
wind generally soon changes to the West,
and the barometer beg ns to rise.
Tnere is generally Out little wind near
the hue ot maximum pressure ; and on
each sidt of that line the winds are irre 'u-
o
lar, but tend outward from tnat line.
Tue fluct u itious of the barometer are
generally greater iu tho Northern and the
Western parts of the l uite l Siates.
In the Northern parts of t he United
States the wind genera ly, in great storms

that the small heroine should re

in" for one mercy that she should not be
made to endure tho humiliation of going
back iu the same cab 'n whicn she had es
caped. As a punishment for this running
away, her teachers shut her up tor tnrce
weeks in a damp room, wherein was laid
the foundation of asthma, a disease which
has clung to her ever since. "Tnat asthmn
was the guiding star of my life," she sa'd
one day, with a laughing glance of the
brown eyes. It became so in forcing her
to live as much as possible away from the
trying air of Surrey. When she had
reached tho ceremonious "coming-out"
afre, she was taken to Loudon, presented
at court, and introd ced to the most brill
iant society of the time. Her asthma was
comparatively subdued here, while with
ever return to the rectory, it bee? me
inore and more aggrarated. It was with
the oreatest d fficulty that she could breathe
tberd, and it was at last decided sho should
remain with her friends in LondoD.

And now began for the bright young
girl a rich and happy experience. At
those houses where genius and fishion
most did congregate, she constantly met
the men and women most famous in poli
tics, literature, and art. Lord Linsdowne,
the grandfather of the present man, is re
membered as the clever and generous
friend of the licratcures of the time, and
also as an aristocratic radical and an en
tertainer of radicals. At his houe, Miss
raithfull, a young women of decided opin
'ons, still in her educational leading
strings, was known as the little blue lory.
Her eyes aud ears were not less acute than
those of another of her hosts, Nassau Sen
ior, whose propensity for drawb g out his
visitors and journalizing the results, gave
mm tne title ot " the recording angel of his
circle ;" and one of her lectures proves
that 2-he has quite as entertaining, though
more merciful, a mode of recalling her im
pressions. Her leisure she filled with the
writing of gravo political articles and re
views for the newspapers. These were, of
course, published anonymously ; for at
that time it was not the fashion for women
of good family and conservative training
to be known as writers for the public
prints. Casual literary work done for the
Englishwoman's Journal led to an ac
quaintance with its editor, Miss l'arkes,
and with the group of progressive thinkers
who were specially interested in it. Tnese
formed a small sub-society of the Kriti.-h
Social Science Association, and occupied
themselves much with the discussion of
woman's needs. Miss Faithfull began to
study deeply upon the subject, and.her de
sire to do a practical work for her sex
soon became absorbing. Her friends, Lord
Drougham and Lord Snaftesbury, as mem
bers of the society, regularly came to its
discussions, and encouraged the young lady,
who was gradually lorgetit'g that ven
erable I'nihstine commandment which says,
Tou shilt not leave thy drawing-room
and bother thyself about the lower
classes."
At one of these meetings Lord Krougham
fixed her, not with his glittering eye. tmt
with his curiously sharp nose, which he
had a peculiar way of pointing at people, '
and cuddeuly asked her to say something
about the subject which was becoming so
dear to her. S;ie liai not time to feel the
fright of a dtlutante, and it was thus that
she made her small maiden speech. Her
proposal that something should be done
in the way of the practical training of
women for profession was raerlv wel
comed, and in lsf.fj she founded the Vic
toria 1'ies-. a typographical establishment
in winch only women are employed us
compos t'-rs. It is perfectly need.e-s to
say that this foundation was exceeding' v
costly, and that Miss Faithfull made n
.-uevc-sful only by d nt of the most deter
in ne 1 stru.'g es. The queen aided her by
an appointment as Printer and Publisher
in Ordinary toller M ijesty," and the
establishment lias now become as perma
nent as it is ii-elul. In In!:; Miss Faithfull
heg iu l lit- I iitoria Majnzine, which, while
it ad vuc ites ehittlvthe lulustnal claims
omen, has a decided literarv value.
S io is president of several societies, is a
charming lecturer, an excellent and
in delapiraioe writer, and, with ail this,
funis time to ci n.siuer t he apnea's ot count-
i Hi -e at which hundreds of applications
for help in obtaining work of some kind
are received every day. Tne imp ssibi!ity
of satisfying even the half of these sad
petitioners, leads M ss Faithfull to con
st'in'iy increasing etl'irts to find space for
women in the professions and handicrafts.
She has come tothis country partly to make
inquiries into ihe condition of the women
and children employed in factories. The
Dnti.-h i overnmeiit, which has long re
garded her asm authority on the subject
ot woman s work, has recoguizcd her mis
sion in a semt-ollkial manner.
Miss 1'aithtuli's excellent social position,
and the extreme moderation with which
she states her opinions, serve to place her
above the ridicule which is so lavishly be
stowed upon most advocates of woman's
rights." And in truth she does not es
pecially one or struggle for the possession
of the vote. The great desire of her use
' fu! life is that women should have accurate
j industrial training, sufficient work, aud
i just rem .ineration. With politics she has
' it tie to do. One reason for her eminent
j success iipo-i the platform is the perfection
: with which she manages her sweet and
j o wei ful voice.
I In person, .'diss Faithfull fulfills the
traditional idea of the English woman.
! She is tall and large of figure, possesses a
la well-shaped head, and a face which tx-

nature. There is nothing

A Story oi Lovk and Fidelity. Capt.
(Jharles 'iucent Siiled from Boston to
Calcutta in the month of August,
He left, in a quiet town Bangor, Me., a
y ung girl ot 1H, to w.iome he was
betrothed. Cipt. Vincent was but 2o
when, on that August day, his ship
-mxiety was leit lor n.s satety till
nearly i vear unu eiapseu. aua no iiuings
of cither s iip, officers or crew had been
received at borne. Years came and went,
and hundreds ol staunch East Indiamcn
sailed into Amerian harbors, but never a
word regarding the ship " Laura Sheldon ''
was received. In the mean time the
young girl, faithful to tho memory of her
. , . . , . . -
'101" lofer' remained unmarried, refusing
iivinu i fl va n f a rfeAn ntieris from anit.ir
many advantageous offers from suitors her
equals in social position aud intellectual
culture, for she is a lady of superior mind.
Through all the 23 years of silence she has
been hopeful and, indeed, cheerful. She
has never despaired of the return ot her
lover. On the lth of Septembar a let
ter was received by her aged mother post
marked ' L verp ool." The writer was
Capt. Charles Vincent, now a man of 54
years. He asked her to inform him if her
daughter was Still alive and unmarried,
and said if the reply should be that effect
that he should sail at once for America.
The mother immediately aniwered this let
ter, carefully concealing everything from
her daughter. On the first day of this
month Capt. Vincent alighted from the
stage at the door of his betrothed. Of th
circumstances of the joyous meeting of the
long-separated lovers we are not permitted
to speak, they are too sacred for the public
ear. Cap. Vinoent's story would fill a
volume. The " Laura Sheldon " was ship
wrcckod in the Indian ocean and only the
captain and one sailor survived. They
were rescued from their perilous condition
on a raft after two days by a brig bound
to Cnina. In one of the Chinese seaports
C ipt. Vincent lived for years, a clerk in
. . ... . .
an English trading house. He wroto sev
eral letters home, but received no answer,
He gradually becamo prosperous in bui-
nefs, and will return to China in a few
months wi h his bride.

A remarkable instance of the sagacity
of a horse has just come to notice. Mr.
John Fle'cner of Norwegian, owns an
unbroken cayuso mare wnieh runs in a
pasture adjoining his house. The mare,
which is very wild, has a young colt at
horside. A few nights since, after Mr.
Fletcher had returned, he was aroused by
the mare ccming to the window of ins
house, and by pawing, neighing, and in
every way possible trying to get his atten

one to come within reach of her, then
ran on a few yards before him, continuing
her neighing ; then, as he did not fol

against him iu the most demonstrative
manner. He attempted to drive her c if,

saw that he was doing so she ran off be

around to 6ee that he was still following,

O MrLIliE.NT TO IIR. liANCROi'T.
Mr. Ilanci'olt, the representative of this
Government nt Berlin, eouduetid the case
and prepared the statement on the part ol
the United States, with the ability that his
past services justified the public in expect
ing at tus nanus. . memocr oi ine catunet
at the date ut the treaty which has riven
rise ;o the discussion between the two Government-,
as the Minister to Great Brit
ain when the eons'rueti.m now pronounced
unfounded, was first advanced and, as the
agent aim representative of the Government
to prefcat the case to receive the award,
he has fern associated with tho question in
ail its phasis, and in every stage has mani
fested a particular zeal and earnestness in
the maintenance of the claim of the United
states. He is entitled to much credit for
the success which has attended the submisti in
s'.lter a patient investigation of the case and ol
satemeats ot eaea firry. His Majesty, the
F.mpcior, on the :21st day of October last
signed bis award in writing, decreeing that
the claim of the Government of the United
States that the boundary line between the
ten-it iries of Her Britannic M ijesty and the
Uiiitid States should be drawn through the
llaro channel is most in accordance with ti e
interpretation of the treaty, concluded on
the lo.li ot June. IMG, between the "gents
oi II r Britannic -Majesty and of the United
States.
Copies of the case presented on br half of
Mch Government and of the statement in

firms the United States in their claim to
the important archipelago of islands ly
ing between the continent and Vancouver's
Island, which for more than twenty-six
ycrs, ever since the ratification of the treaty
of Great Britain, was contested, and leaves
us for the first time in tho history of the
United States as a tiaitcn without a question
or disputed boundary between our territory
and the possc-aieni of Great Britain on this
continent.

THE ALAS X A BOltVOATlV.
The experience of 'he difhciltips attending
tbs determination uf our a.i-nitted 1in of
bo tndary after the occupation of tbe terri
tory, and its settlement by these owing
allegiance to respective r-nve-nrnenos, points
to the importance of establishing hvnati nal
objects or other monuments the p-elual line
between tho territ rv acquire 1 'v us from
Russia, and tbe adjoining pi-sn-sions of her
Britannic Majesty. Tbe region is now so
sparsely occupied, no c inll cting interest of
individuals or of juris liction are likdy to
interfere to the delay or e n'urrm "i"it of
the actual location of ti e li"e. If deferred
until a populition shall enter and o-eupy
the territory, s iiiic trivial eun'cO. of neighbors
may again array the two ( iyermi-rtt-i ia
antagonism. I, therefore, recommend tbe
appointment of a Commi-sion t act j tintly
with one that may be appointe I on the pirt
of Great Britain to determine the line be
tween the Terr tory of Alaska and the coter
minous possessions of Great Britain.

THE AUSTRIAN W.'SLdV IA!".
Preparations are nuking for the Interna
tional Exposition to lie he d during t ie next
vear at Vienna on a seile of very gre -.t mig
nitude. The tend ne of these espts tions
is in tiie direction oi advaiic d civil zitim
and of the elevation of industry, hii! of
labor, and of the increase of hum to happi
ness as well of greater intercourse and o;ood
will between nations. As this e-xpsit -on is
to be the first which will have been he! 1 iu
t'astern Europe, it is bslieved that Aniericin
inveotors and manufacturers will be ready
to avail t emselvcs of the orpi f mity for
the presentation of their productions :f en
couraged by proper aid aud prot. etion. At
tbe last session of Congress aath irity wis
given for the appointment of one or more
agents t j represent tins (ijvir.im.tit nt the
Exposition. The authority thus given has
been exercised, but in the a' ser.ee of any
appropriation there is danger that ihc impor
tant bemfits which the exposition nff rs will
in a larjre degree u : Jose tj tue citizens oi
the United Stites. I commend the suhject
strongly to vour consideration and reco n-
meod that an adequate appropriation be
in ide for tho j.urp ise to tunn -r any Am--ri-can
exhibitiom at the Vienna cxp fitior s.
I would recommend in ad Iiti q that the
Secretary of the Navy lie authorize J to fit up
two Tessels to transport between our Atlantic
cities and Trieste or the most couvenient
port to Vienna aud back their :trticks for
exhibition.
OUR RELATIONS WITU MEXICO.
Since your last session the l'r. sid mt of
the Mexican Republic, distinguished by ids
high character and by bis cervices to bis
country, has died. Ilts temporary s ice, ssor
has now been elected with great uatiii uity
by the people a proof ol confiience on their
part in his patriotism and wisdom, which it
is believed will be confirmed by fie rc-ults
of his administration. Ic is p r:icalariy
disirab'-e that nothing should be ieit undone
by tbe Government of either R.-pub.ic to
strengthen their relations as neighoirs anu
friends. It it much ti be regretted that
many lawless acts continue t! disturb the
quiet of the settlements on the b irder be
twicn our tcriitory and t.hat of Mexico, and
that Complaints uf wrongs to Aiucieia
citihseiis in various parts of the c mntry are
made. Tiie levolutiuuary condition ia w hich
the nciOIoorine; Kej u hito lias sj 1 mg been
itivolyid lias in eouie degree outnbuted to
this dibturbanee. It is lo be hoped that with
a more settled rule of order through the
Republic, which may be expected from the
present Government, the acts, of which just
complaint is made, will cease.
