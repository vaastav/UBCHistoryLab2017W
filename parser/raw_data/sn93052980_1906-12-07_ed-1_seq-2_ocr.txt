President's Message.
President Koosevelt's messatce to
oongress is one of the most torceful
and remarkable documents ever pre
sented to tbe national legislature. In
every paragraph it reveals the sterling
character of tbe man behind it. It is
clear and positive in iU tone, and
advocates in several directions radical
departures from the policy of tbe
past. Whatever difference <if opinion
may exist as to tbe wisdom ot some
ot the recommendations, no one will
doubt for a moment the high patriotic
and unselHah motives ot tbe president
in their advocacy. The^document is
a lengthy one and deals with a great
variety of subjects, bearing npon our
domestic and foreign relation. Among
tbe prominent features ot tbe message
we may mention tbe following:
The exclusion of the Japanese from
the oommon schools of San Kranoisco
is denouuoaii as wicked and absurd.
The naturalization of Japanese is
advooated.
Government should not part witb
any more public coal lands.
Employers' liability aut to be ex
tended.
tiigbt hours a day to be tbe limit
on railroads, aud a ganeral adoption
of the eight hour day.
Free trade for the Philippines, or
a sweeping reduction of the tariff
charges.
Marriage and divorce laws to be
under tbe control of Congress.
Anti-chila labor laws tor tbe terri
tories and District of Columbia.
inheritance and graded income tax
laws.
Fall citizenship for the Porto
Klcans.
Enactment of ship subsidy laws.
One llrst class battleship to be
added to tbe navy each year.
The right of injunction by the
courts should not be impaired.
Keform in the army aud navy,
abolishing tbe system of promotion on
tbe ground of seniority.
THE PABTT ALL BIGHT.
The L«dger takes no stock in tbe
gloomy predictions that tbe repub
licans of .Amador county stand little
show to sleet any candidate for a
county office for many years. Snon
propb.iies have only tbe disappoint-
Ed hopes of a few disgruntled ones to
rest upon. If it is simply meant that
If tbe party is to be guided in tbe
future id the same devious paths that
marked the late campaign, tbe pros
pects of 8000688 will again be du
bious, we are willing to concede the
correctness of tbe proposition. Like
causes produces like effects. Id oar
opinion, the party bore up remark
ably well under the adverse condi
tions to which it waa subjected. A
ticket composed of good material was
slaughtered, it is true, but that de
feat [was brought about by voidable
methods. Let cs in the future steer
dear of tbe ways tbat were frowned
down Id crashing defeat last month.
Let us I.am the lesson thoroughly
tbat to be successful we must, first of
all, deserve success. The vitally im
portant.lesson ia that those in leader
ship most be tbe most abject follow
ers. Dictation of any kind will not
go witb republicans. At every point
of the game let them keep step to the
wishes! of tbe rank and file. They
must remember tbat they are merely
servants, not masters. To twist tbe
organization to down this one, or to
raise op tbe other one. is not wise.
Authority Is Dot to be made a club tn
emphasize the likes or dislikes of the
wieldera.
Japanese in School.
Tbe action of the authorities in San
Francisco not to permit the Jap
anese to mingle in the schools with
tbe white children, has oieated a
tremendous Harry in diplomatic
circles, in both countries. A very
delicate question has thereby been
raised, which threatens to materially
atfeot the cordial relations heretofore
existing between the two nations.
The exclusion of Japanese, whether
adults or children, from the public
schools, is in conformity witb tbe
universal -sentiment of American
citizens on the coast. It is more than
probable that it is also opposed to
tbe universal sentiment of the people
of th. Japanese empire. There is no
poastbility of reconciling tbe views of
tbe one class with tbe other. In
California the presence of the Jap
anese with white children in tbe
schools would no be tolerated, any
more than Chinese children. And
yet the United States is under treaty
obligations to give to subjects of
Japan in America all tbe rights and
privileges of tbe most favored nation.

JAPANESE QUESTION TO THE FOEE
It is safe to say that the position
taken by President Roosevelt on tbe
Japanese question in his message, will
stir the people of tbe Pacific slope
states as they have not been stirred
since tbe civil war. The same argu
ments were urged in behalf ot tbe ad
mission of Chinese tc ail tbe privileges
aocoided other races some twenty tUt
years ago that are now brought forth
in- behalf of the Japanese. It required
many years to oduoate the eastern
and middle western states to the ex
clusion of Mongolians. The same
light is now on with regard to the
Japanese. Let it be admitted thai
the Japanese are the most enlightened
and progressive of Oiiental nations,
ihey are valiant in war, and equally
successful in tbe arts of peace. They
have fairly earned the right to be
classed witb the most cultured and
progressive nf nations. All this is
not seriously disputed. But that does
not reach tbe core of the question.
There is a deep-rooted prejudice in
tbe minds of American citizens to
any influx ot Asiatics to these shores
This feeling is not a mere sentimental
une to the dwellers of tbe Pacilic
coast. It is based on experience.
We have boen brought in 'contact
with tbe Mongolians, and we do not
want them as fellow citizens, or com
panious iv any way. Other sections
of the Union having no experience
in this direction, have not this pre
judice, and would force an undesii
able population upon us. If they
understood the matter as we under
stand it, they would feel exactly as
we do, and want to shut them out
precisely as we do. If the conditions
were reversed, and Japan were
threatened with an invasion of
Causasiajas to such an extent as to
disturb tbe labor market and the
educational system of that nation,
would there not be some steps taken
in that country to ward off the
danger. Of course there is no danger
from this sourse. The higher paid
laborers are not going to immigrate
in any formidable numbers to a
country were a far-lower wage
schedule exists.
That the little brown men and tbeir
children are accorded free education
in separate schools should be suffi
cient. This ought not to wound the
sensibilities of tbe Japanese. Tbe
same discrimination is lesorted to
toward tbe colored race in the south
ern states. They are not permitted
to ride in the same car with white
folks in some states. Why, insist
that tbe people of California shall
assooiate witb Japanese as with their
own race. The truth is they will not
do so, no matter what the treaty
obligations demand, or the interpre
tation placed therein by the president
or by congress. Japanese ways are
not our ways. They are of different
mental, moral and physical make-up.
We cannot assimilate witb them, aud
would not if we could. Neither can
ther assimilate with American ways.
The trade we have witb Japan is not
worthy of mention as an offset to tbe
admission of Japanese as citizens, or
on terms uf social equality. Far
better that we sell not a dollar's worth
of goods to these island people than
throw tbe gates wide open for their
entrance. On this issue the opponents
ot Japanese citizenship or admission
to this country are standing for tbe
true interests ot the United States.
We have too mucb mixture of races
here already. We have tried to
absorb the hordes not only from
Europe, but from Africa aud Asia,
and the experiment has proved a flat
failure. We realize this, if President
Roosevelt does not. Strict exclusion
of the Japanese, as well as other
Asiatics is the only path of national
protection and safety.

AZTEC ARCHITECTURE.
Wonderful Endurance of the Old
Mexican Buildinga.
The Mexicans or th;? Aztec Indians
can give the people of the United
States lessons in architecture and In
solid construction of buildings. There
are buildings standing today hi the
City of Mexico that have stood for
three centuries and are in an excellent
state of preservation. There is not a
frame building in the city. There are
a few adobe, but most all are stone,
brick or cement. There is a brick
building down in the old part of the
town that was erected prior to 1150.
It shows that so long ago as that the
Indians were experts in the manufac
ture of bricks. Hut probably 80 per
cent of all the buildings are made of
concrete cement. Cement and concrete
have been used successfully in Mexico
for 500 years, and all the cathedrals
and churches are of that material. On
the line of the Vera Cruz Pacific can
be seen the ruins of Toro Bravo, where
there are evidences of a city ruined
centuries ago. There are some twenty
pyramids of solid cement which must
have been erected over 500 years ago.
One of these pyramids is 170 feet in
height, and on the summit rests a
cement ledge thirty feet in diameter.
This, as well as others, Is of filigree
work and carved statuary.
Near this stands another of white
limestone, built in four terraces, witb
carvings aud ornameutatioas which
would put to shame the modern Amer
ican sculptor. It has stood all these
centuries, yet the limestone is much
easier broken thai) the cement. Think
of a town of almost 400,000 persons,
and the fire record is three in one year.
The inside walls of many of the build
ings are as much as six feet through,
and all buildings are built around
courts. There Is no provision in any
of them for fires, ami at the present
time small coal oil stoves arc selling
in the city for $20— the same that sell
for $3 in the states. The floors are of
stone, the collinga of filigree cement,
the walls of coarse plaster and almost
without exception band painted. The
architecture on many buildings In the
republic shows that the Indian of cen
turies ago was ahead of the modern
builder of today. — Hobart News-Re

Elasticity of Spiders' Webs.
Did you ever watch a spider's web
on a windy day? If so, you will notice
how wonderfully it accommodates
itself to the swaying of the twigs to
which it is attached. It is in fact elas
tic of the very finest quality, Were it
not for its elasticity the poor spider
would not long survive. The first
breeze would rend the silken meshes
of the web to atoms aud the owner's
stock of new materal would very soon
be exhausted in repairs and renewals.
Besides its elasticity, tbe spider's web
Is very sticky, a property which ac
counts for the e:ise wherewith it holds
insects when oneo ouuglit.
