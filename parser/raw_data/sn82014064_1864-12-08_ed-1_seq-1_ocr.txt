TUB NEWS,
As to Sherman, nothing further, save con
/ tinned and increasing contortions and colic
pains in the Confederacy. Gov. Brown is
firing minute gnns ol distress in the shape of
proclamations, and the people of exposed
-cities are beside themselves with frenzied
alarm. And ail is din and confusion, which
wc watch from afer, as men gaze when a tor
nado stalks alongthe horizon hiding Us mis
chief In its own murky pall. We have no hint
as yet as to where Sherman is or where he
will emerge! It will come presently to hand,
the news we all await. Meanwhile in this
instance it is the most salutary of all waiting
moods to keep npa gentle simmer of anxiety.
Il Is easily got rid of, and may even add zest
to a realized joy, while It Is the bestofpre
paratlous against disaster. Keep your poise
reader, and stand wall braced. God grant
that you and we may presently make the
welkin ring with cheers for the old fiag,
shining the brighter when it flashes out of
the doubt that now veils Sherman’s march.
Wc are bound to believe the persistent and
repeated statement of the Nashville dispatch
es that Thomas has drawn the uniped rebel
Hood to the precise position where he is, as
a bullock to the ring for slaughter, and it in
deed looks as if there was some semblance of
danger to the rebel forces from the position
of our army at Murfreesboro under Milroy
and Rousseau co-operating in the rear, with
Thomas in front. The next few days will de
clare it, however, and until then we cannot
help the situation by fighting the battle on
IMLjier.
From Grant’s array, resting from before
Richmond at Dutch Gap, to below Peters
burg, there is only an occasional report of
Ticket firing or scattered artillery practice,
but If the weather holds favorable, and pres
cut plans do not miscarry, there will be a
grand choral effect thereaway presently. It
is near at hand. Grant is not asleep, and has
not begun to hybemalc. The campaign be
fore the rebel capital will wind np with one
of the most striking tableaus of tbe war thus
far.
TLc preparations at Detroit and Indianapo
lis against rebel plots are entirely wise. Per
haps that celebrated Chicago circular might
receive its former signatures, assuring the
public that these things are only party dodges,
but we believe that these signers, in one way
and another, are pretty well convinced that
there Is something in them. It will be entire
ly prudent for all our Northern cities to re
member that the rebels haye long and hun
grily coveted a holocaust of Northern homes
The House yesterday killed Thad. Steven*’
gold bill dead, for stirring up the bulls. We
shall sec what way matters now turn, and
truly gold slept a little eavierlast night. The
only permanent way for Congress to end gold
panics is to end the war, by vigorous mea*
Bures at the evils and its roots. Constitution
al treatment, gentlemen, is what is needed.
Don’t waste time in nostrums, however
promising, particularly in expectorants.
We give elsewhere an important and Inter
esting announcement to the friends of paroled
ptisor^rs.
A crack blockade runner, the steamship
Vixen, has jnst been captured, after a mag
nificent little chase by our war vessel, the
Rhode Island. The Vixen was sailed by one'
of our kind British cousins, In her Majesty's
naval service, and made desperate attempts
to get away, but the Rhode Island was too
many knots for her. Great is the delight of
the blue jackets, and a smile of delight will
vurl the venerable beard of Secretary Welles.

The editor of the Jeff. Davis organ in this
city says: “We arise from the perusal of the
Message with intense pain.” That rheumatism
was contracted on a rainy Tuesday early in
November. Rebel aches and alls are very
numerous nowadays, and the Message was not
intended os a Fain Killer.
The rebel Dr. Gwinn has the authority
from MaximQUon to set up a Viceregal
Court as Governor of Sonora. We look to
see the French Imported Mexican Emperor
besieged by countless Importunate rebels for
shining things in his gift: and the affinity is
a close one which draws (hem to him. The
rebel last-ditch will be the far side of the Rio
Grande.
LOUISIANA.
There is ho question likely to come before
Congress more delicate and perplexing than
the return of the representation of the sece
ded States to our national halls of legislation.
The subject Is not a new one before the peo
ple. It was originally opened by one Foster,
a Washington .reporter, who made haste to
go down in a most accommodating manner t:>
be returned for ft North Carolina district, and
fulled, as he ought,the recognition of his
claims to a seat In the House. It has since
been repeated on a scale, broader and of bet
ter seeming, and is now more formally before
Congress In the claim of the Louisiana dele
gation to seats in both bodies. Our reports
of proceedings for the past two days sufficient*
ly declare the temper of Congress in this mat
ter, and indicate that In thelew ol neither
branch does Louisiana present in these gentle
men in waiting, a duly accredited representa
tion from her people. - The motion of Senator
Trumbull, yesterday, however, gives a promise
of the careful dclil>cration the ease deserves,
os the establishment of a precedent by which
future similar applications are to be govern
ed. The Louisiana gentlemen will probably
be returned from instead of to Washington,
and bidden to seek first a constituency os the
true basis of claims like theirs. It will not
do to allow our erring sisters to become
treasure trove for all manner of political ad
venturers. It will he the best proof of the
cure of the disease of rebellion, their return
to their loyal suffrage and until then they are
in treatment, with guardianship, which
should as’ well protect them from the evils of
revolt as from the abuses of bogus represen
tation.
PASSING AWAY.
We clip the following from the Savannah
(Ga.) Jk&y Xeio* t of the 4th instant. It is
one of & mass of advertisement illustrating
certain familiar features of an institution
which our children will soon look hack upon
as we now regard the relics of the barbarism
of the middle ages:
S3OO Reward.
OK the morning of the If>th of August, my girl.
MARV or MARV ANN', left my residence. It
5* rttpposed she Is harbored !u Charleston, South
Carolina. She ie a bright ginger cake color, full
bosom, high cheek bones, projecting eyes, pleas
ing countenance, and a little tonge-tied; fall head
of hair, wear* a palmetto hat with purple ribbon
around it, and dark gingham dress. She was for
merly the property of Mr. John M. Cooper. I
will pay three hundred dollars for her delivery at
Illonnt & Dawson's. MARY DAWSON.
It will be observed that one woman is here
hounding after another as her property , offer
ing a reward sufficient to excite the cupidity
of every slave catching poor white who was
rich enough to own a blood hound. It will
he Interesting to know how fiir Mary would
permit Mary Ann to be pursued by the usual
modes of pursuing fugitive chattels at Jthe
South, and also what mode of punishment or
prevention Mary would regard as adequate to
keep Mary Ann at home in the 4hture after
her S3OO reward had been paid for her return.
It will be noted, also, that “Mary or Mary
Ann” has no more a name than would a dog
or a horse. She had parents, hut her name
falls to indicate tbr»m Either her lather or
her grandfather was white—perhaps both
were, as she is of a “bright ginger-cake”
color, “lull bosom, high cheek bones, pro
jecting eyes, pleasing countenance, full bead
of hair (not a bandaged*- bundle of wool,”
«kc M &c. One would suppose from the de
scription that something very like a woman
was referred to In it. Not only this, but she
has at least as much white blood as black
thus showing thalit Isas lawfulto enslave
one color as the other.* What can remain of
womanhood or Christianity where such a state
of things is regarded as disgraceful to neither?
Yet, It was for this the rebellion was inaugu
rated. •

A valued correspondent at Leavenworth
sends ns an elaborate and careful review of
Price’s recent Missouri invasion and evasion,
especially the latter. We oqjj forbear to give
it place because GeneralKosecrans has passed
beyond censure to the retirement he has rich
ly earned. General Curtis’ share in the work
VOL. XVJLLi
of punishing Price and redeeming the errors
of the Union commanders in Missouri is his
torical and not unknown to the readers of the
Tribune, and Missouri will lon# be grateful
for the gallantry that rushed to her rescue
out of Kansas, and spoiled Apr despoilcr.
Price came into Missouri witoa large force.
Bosecnms permitted him to traverse the half
of the Stale well nigh unmolested. He gath
ered up large numbers of men and great quan
tities of plunder. These, General Cur*is
forced him to abandon before he drove him
over the Arkansas River, after Rosecrans bad
withdrew every man he could command from
the aid of General Curtis. But for Curtis,
the rebels Would now be carousing in blood
and p.undcr over the fields of Kansas, and
the homes o£ a brave and gallant people be
the food of fire and pillage.
To Cnrtis and Kansas are the country in
debted for the glorious discomfiture of Price
and the rebel cause in Missouri—to these are
Price solely indebted for the fights and foot
race between the Osage and Arkansas rivers.
These are the chief points made in the account
referred fo, which wc would publish were not
its positions, in our view, already well sus
tained and of familiar record, and how ofE

ACCOUNTS BT MATT.,
[From the Dcm£ Tribune and Advertiser, 6th.]
As we have previously Intimated would un
doubtedly be the case, the arrest of B. (3. Burley
one of the lake Erie pirates, has disclosed a gl "■an
tic conspiracy to. rob and probably murder citi
zens of this State, which has long been thwarted
by tbe indefatigable exertions of our tnilitarv au
thorities, aided by tbe officers of the Canadian
Government Among the latter, Mr. W. Lambert,
a Toronto detective. Is entitled to favorable men
tion. To his ingenuity and shrewdness we are in
debted for the arrest of Barley, who Is one of the
mobt desperate rebels on record. Knowing his
true character, Mr. Lambert, of course, prepared
himself fur any emergency, but was enabled to se
cure his prisoner with little trouble, and subse
quently landed him safely in Toronto jail. A few
•tacts relative to Burley maynot prove uninterest
ing. We have previously, given a minute de
scription of. his person. Hu was born in Green
ock, Scotland, and at the age of about 15 or
IS years enlisted in what was known as tie
‘‘BritishLegion,”and fought with that orgaaiaa
tion under Garibaldi, in Itnlr. Subsequently he
deserted that brave leader, and fonght against him.
After the close of that war he returned home, and
luting of an adventurous disposition, the present
rebellion affordedanew field of enterprise, and at.
an early stage of the war he took passage oh a
blockade runner, previously built on the Clyde, In
which he ran the blockade of Charleston in safety.
Reasserts that he aided in placing many of the
torpedoes in Charleston harl>or. .Re next turned >
up in Canada, but how he got there wc know not.
lie arrived there early last k spring, and. together
with other rebels, was soon rem'y t > take on active
part in any plundering scheme tuat might be con
cocted. fils first scheme partially Idled, yet be
and his gong did all the damage they thought
proper to do. lie is now. we hope, lo a fair way of
receiving his ieward for the exploit.
About the time the propeller Georgian was pur
chased (by money furnished by the rebel Govern
ment), Burley volunteered his services, but his
rashness in tbe Philo Parsons affair, it appears,
was considered no recommendation fora leader;
therefore he was entrusted with superintending
the operation of providing aims and ammunition
for the Georgian. He attempted to purchase
these materials at several places without success.
Re, however, subsequently called upon Ad«m
Robertson & Son—the former a cousin of hl»—
foundrymen and machinists, at Guelph, C. W M on
what is known as the Eramtva roan, who, being
liberally provided with money, undertook the jos
of casting shot, shell, etc., for the rel>«l cause, and,
unolmtrved, carried on the business np to
the time of Barley's arrest Shot shell,
elc_, Is of no nscwltbunt the necessary ordnance,
but the difficulty was soon overcome. A man
living at Gnelph had a field piece, which had been
cast by Robertson A Son, that was purchased and
packed up ready for shipment at a moment's no
tice. The gun carriage, shot shell and ammoni
um was similsriy (Deposed of, m»j the whole
shipped to Collicgwood, as has since hcuu ascer
tained* for the propeller Georgian. These facts
were brought to light by the arrest o fßurley, who
made no attempt to disguise them. A few days
t ince'a number of fiuspiaou%-lco*ing persons were
arrested at Collingwood, and their carjiet sacks
found to contain revolvers and fixed ammunition.
A search was Instituted, and alirge box containin'*
the identical gun carriage before alluded to, was
found, bat the gnn itscli could not be found.
The Canadian Government officials visited Rob
ertson & Son’s place at Gnelph, and found a large
quantity of munitlons-of war, which was seised,
and the proprietors required to give bonds not to
resume their manufacture. Previous to his arrest,
Burlcy bod been stopping with his cousin, of the
above firm, and was superintending the casting of
shot, etc. After the sclrare of the above muni
tions. ft was ascertained that several bores and
barrels had been shipped to Lexington, Mich.,
consigned to one Baud Smitten. These articles
were also seized, hut nothing of a contraband na
ture found.
The above facts are sufficient to show that the
Georgian was really Intended for a privateer, and
that Burley was entrusted with the arming ofher.
These snspidims are more than confirmed when
we state that her Captain bus, since the arrest of
Burley, mode a proposition to re-sell her to the
former owners, declaring that he was too closely
watched to accomplish anything. They also dem
onstrate that Burley and Robertson A Son have
been guilty of a flagrant violation of tbe neutrali
ty laws; and hare set at naught the provisions of
the Queen's proclamation. Knowing these facts,
imd the evidence against Barley being overwhelm
ing in reference to the part he took In the Philo
Parsons capture, it is to lie hoped that the Cana
dian people will manifest their oft-repeated decla
rations that they would not aid nuy interference
with onr troubles, by Insisting that tbe prisoner
be delivered up for trial.
IMPORTANT AUnVCT.
[From the Detroit TriVan •,
On Saturday, about noon, a saloon keeper
named £. C. Slider, residing at Windsor, wan
taken into custody nj order of Provost Marshal
Flanigan. He has been suspected foreometimeof
supplying the seccsb Canadian raiders with con
trahand(articlcs. On Saturday It was ascertained
tbata quantity of ammunition waalyingat the
American Express office in this city. Subsequent
ly the Express Company were nodded not to let
the ammunition go until the man to whom it was
consigned called for it. About noonSbeley In
quired for the ammunition and was at once taken
into custody and sent to the House of Correetioa
for future examination. His excuse is, that he
purchased the ammunition for bunting and for his
own me. It was eent to him from New York city
bv the American Express line.
"The authorities arc quite certain that these rifle
cartridges were intended for the scccah raiders
and the pirates who flourish and thrive, on the
other side of the river. It is a suspicious circum
stance. to say the least, that this ammunition
should be shipped to this city instead of direct to
Windsor. The authorities are wide-awake and
ever on the alert to thwart the designs of the
. conspirators over the border. Tbelr watchful
ness ha*> undoubtedly nipped numerous rebel
plots In the bud, and prevented both loss of life
and property.

All sorts of rumors pervaded the city when
the news that a flag of truce had come in got
abroad, the general supposition being that
Hood had demanded the surrender of the
city.
Generals Mllroy and Rousseau are at Mur
freesboro, which is amply garrisoned and de
fended against any rebel force which may
attack It.
Yesterday a body of rebels attacked block
houses six and seven, near Murfreesboro.
They were gallantly fought by the garrison,
and soon a body of troops, sent by Mllroy
from Murfreesboro, arrived, who attacked
iiM> rou&ia with such imnelim-dty Mint UiCt
retired.
It Is not now contraband to elate that a
large army Is being concentrated at Murfrees
boro, under Rousseau and Stedman, which
will speedily operate upon Hood’s communi
cations, if it is not already doing so; and
whenever fairly at work, Thomas wul at ones
administer a crushing blow to his adversary,
If the rebel General docs not first begin the
attack by an attempt to take Nashville.
The rebel lines are plainly visible from Cap
itol Hill, from the M Bass Mansion,” and from
one or two other points In this city. They
arc drawn about the city In a serai-circle, anil
the men arc engaged in digging trenches and
throwing up breastworks'. Their lines arc
very thin, but the position they occupy is
very strong, on account of the lay pf the
ground. The land is gently undulating and
very susceptible of a protracted defense.

For some time past it has been well known
to many citizens here that the practice of in
ducing negroes and refugees to enlist at this
point and having them transferred to other
States—Ohio, Massachusetts, and whatever
State chanced to be short has been much
in vogue. They were generally run oil* on
night trains without the knowledge of the
military authorities. The principal agents
have been white men, who have found ft few
colored men sufficiently degraded to aid them
In the frork. This practice has at length as
sumed such magnitude that ihc military au
thorities have been awakened to tho necessi
ty ot preventing it. In thisdistrictond State,
wc having been robbed of thousands of men

The report that the gunboat Cincinnati,

They fought bravely, hut could not bear up

miscalculated their mtm. He drew a bowie

of the same regiment, who was also returning
from the circus, came upon the «cene at the
moment it was done, and not knowing the
cause of the encounter, discharged his revol

New York, Wctjicsday, Dec. 7.— We have
to-day some additional items from rebel sour
ces, showing fright at Sherman’s ap

gia and South Carolina. All the' officials,
civil and military, have issued fierce aud fe
verish proclaraarioas, calling.on every male,
old and young, able to shoulder a musket, to
immediately report for duty. The mayors of
Savannah and Charleston, as well as the rebel
army officers commanding in those places,
have issued to their already terrified commu
nities, documents of this character, probably
by this means adding considerably to the
panic. Governor Brown, of Georgia, has Is
sued three more proclamations on the crisis;
but in Charleston, according to the Jiepubli
can of that city, even these stirring papers do
not bring out the citizens, for it appears a
military guard has to go around the town and
drag them out of their hiding places.
General Dick Taylor has been assigned to
the command of all the Alabama and Georgia
reserves, with headquarters at Savannah.

Sherman’s situation is daily growingmore

somewhat to have disappointed expectation,
for It is regarded as favoring further Issue of

Assembly of Louisiana, in the election of K. C.
King and Chae. Smith as Senators from that State..
Mr. WADE, of Ohio, presented a remonstrance

Mr. MORGAN, of New York, presented the cre
dentials of Chas. Smith and R. C. King, Senators

that when the committee arc appointed that tho

Mr. BLAINE, cf Maine, said that the House yes
terday referred to the- Committee of Ways and
Means the bills of the gentleman from Pennsylva
nia, Mr. Stevens, to prevent gold and silver coin
and bullion from being paid or accepted for a
greater value than their real current value, and.
for preventing any note or bill issued by the Uni-’
ted States from being received for a smaller sum
than Is therein specified. He moved to reconsider
tlic motion of reference. In the twenty-four hours
since this bill was introduced great mischief has
been done, and every day and hotir this bill re
mained where it was, still greater mischief will
result in raising the price of gold. It indicts three
Slates of the Union, and makes every man goilty
of a misdemeanor, and every danse of it commits
this House to an impossibility. Gold rose yester
day 12c for no other reason than this extraordinary
hill. •
Mr. COX, of Ohio, did not agree with tho gen
tleman that this bill would put up the price of
gold. He rather thought the President haspiayed
the Bull by his message.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pa., in reply to Mr. Blaine,
said that the action he proposed had been exor
cised by the moat distinguished statesmen for sev
eral ages. There ought to be some checkout to
gambling when gold was put up a price-anu-a-half
above its real vnioc. This could not be prevented
unless
that England adopted during the great wars with
Napoleon. He moved to lay on the table the mo
tion to reconsider the vote.
Mr. STEVENS’ motion was negatived—yeas 31,
navs 66.
The vote by which the bill was referred was re

The military Situation.
Letters from the Army of the Potomac con*
tain no news. The utmost quiet prevailed
along our lines at the latest dates.
The Macon Messenger, of the 23d ult., says
of the cavalry fight at Walnut creek: *• The
enemy, with four pieces of artillery, was va
riously estimated at from 5,000 to 8,000, com
mandedby General Kilpatrick. The artillery
fire was- opened and kept up quite briskly
about two hours, without loss on onr side.
Their shooting was not creditable. Of their
loss, we saw six dead horses, but know not
what it might have been during the fight.
Captain of the 10th Ohio regiment,
with a very few men, who hod grossed the
creek, mode a daring charge on our city, when
bis horse was shot and the Captain captured.
These arc about the only accidents of the
second attack on our city, and all the injury
done in the immediate vicinity was the burn
ing of a mill and the injuring of a few hnn-
dred yards of railroad. It was very feeble.”
The steamship Fulton, specially detailed,
will leave this port to-morrow with a heavy
■ mall for Sherman’s army. She goes under

Thanksfflrtn" Day t!ic « Soldiers’
Home,”
Editors TribCne At one place onr soldiers
bad reason to feel that on the day of National
Thanksgiving they were forgotten neither by the
friends at home or the friends who had followed
to care for them on their journey to the field. At
the “ Soldiers’ Home rightly bo named—of
Cairo, the “fatted calf” was literally killed, and
open it, with generous mince pies and vegetables
from Egypt—where else do such vegetables grow?
—the soldiers feasted. The four towns, Salem,
Nashville. Hoylton and IMchvlew, of Southern Il
linois, each contributed chickens, apples and veg
etables, while several of our city dealers, thron'd!
(he kind solicitation of Mr. Aiken, Pre&idemTof
the rirs t National Bank of this city, sent a supply
of cakes, crackers and apples. It Is well, that
while onr heart® go c ut in earnest sympathy for the
soldier on the field, the Sanitary Commission re
members the soldier when coming to or
from his home, by the formation of institutions like
this, the admirable superintendence
of Mr. C, w. Shipman. United States Sanitary
Agent at that point, is doing noble work for our
men. Well, too, that onr attention is called to
specific cases whore suffering may be relieved or
pleasure given by efforts trivial In themselves, bat
which will never bo forgotten by the soldier.
