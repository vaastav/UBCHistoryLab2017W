A Oood Idea A Fair Proposition.
The good idea above referred to is
that fit establishing at San Marcos a
newspaper and printing office on a
new and enlarged basis, by means of
a stock company, which wo bear is iu
contemplation and has received tbe
endorsement of some of our loading
citizen. We say tbis is a good idea,
'or several strong and obvious rea
sons, Itf tbe first place, if the history of
tbe newppaper business in this place
bhows anything, it is that more than
pne paper cannot be sustained in San
Marcos. The failure of tbe third
effort to keep up a second paper here
has but just been announced, which
we think ought to be conclusive on
that point But even if two papers
could manage to sustain life hero, it
is clear that both would necesarily be
sickly and half-starved, such as could
reflect no ' credit on their conductors
nnd sirth as no citizen would wish to
send abroad as representatives of
the business, intelligence and pro
gress of the town.
' Jt might well be questioned wheth
er the united support of the entire
county would not be necessory to the
support of a first-class county paper
and its appertaining business. Kyle,
however, in all probability will con
tinue to keep its local paper, but this
would not be a very seriouB draw
back were tbe rest of the .county
united in the support of a good pa
per at ,the county seat, for many of
the Kyle people would find it indis
pensable to lend thoir support to the
latter as well as their home paper.
Leaving this branch of the subject
, we come to another strong reason in
favor of the proposod enterprise,
kindred to tbe foregoing. Without
the co-oporation contemplated, the
business in a pluce like this is so un
remunerative as to necessarily, in or
der to keep it going, devolve on tbe
shoulders of one man. Such, for in
stance, has been our own experience
in San Marcos. Every intelligent
person knows that wo have boon to a
large extent a slavo to the business,
and thus only have boon enabled to
keep it up without actual loss. We
have loug felt the need of an nsist
nnt in local editing and soliciting as
well as in other departments. With
this we could undoubtedly have made
a more satisfactory paper and got on
with comparative ease ond comfort.
Another thing an editor who has
the whole business of a newspaper
and piinting business on his hands
cannot as a matter of course do him
self justice in his own proper Bphero.
Such bos been our position. Yet the
business would not justify tbe em
ployment of tbe needed help without
loss, so we have boon compelled to
worry along pingle handed. Not
only so, but as was to have been ex
pected, we have made some enemies
not very many, it is true, but suf
ficient to prevent that unity of sup
port that 'was essential totbegttat
est success.
Now under the proposed plan of
a stock company, the needed capital
would be had to start right, auJ,
through a division of labor, and tbe
united patronage naturally to be ex
pec ted from the management of new
men against whom there was to
special prejudice, tberecoulJ be but
little doubt that tbe -new departure"
in tbe newspaper business would, as
it surely onght to, be winch more snc- j
ccst.'J than any toMif ffvrt Aod J
it fettas to o that S..o Marcos ha
f ally rtached a sUje of progrea re
quiring and warranting this extension
of tbe business.
So much for the first branch of
our subject. Now as to the second.
. A FAIR WOPOBITION.
For the reasons above statod, as
well as various minor ones, we are
favorably impressed with tbe idoa of
tbe new departure in tho newspaper
and printing business in this place,
and are ready to got out of tho way
st any time, on tbe 6implo and cor
tainly fair condition that tho propos
ed stock company shall take our
printing office, newspaper and print
ing business and good will, at their
fair valuation. Tbis we cannot doubt
they would as a matter of course do,
from the following among other con
siderations :'
1. Whon we came bore wo found
a small printing office and . newspa
per running, though just on the eve
of "playing out." We had brought
with us a much larger offico, and did
not need a great part of the material
of the one here, yet wo thought it
only fair and honorable to buy it out,
and did so. .Are we not, then, fairly
entitled to like consideration T
2. We have continued publishing
a paper here ever since fourteen
years without interruption. Dur
ing this period nearly all the towns
of tbis section have had numerous
changes in the proprietorship or
management of their papers, and as
a consequence many of them have
naturally been inferior. During this
long period it will scarcoly be denied
that we have published a paper quite
is good as tbe market afforded, or
that we have labored steadily for the
best interests of tbis community.
Certainly, therefore, we think we are
entitled to an "honorable discharge"
in the way we have suggested.
3. But aside from these consider
ations, we feel sure a proper appreci
ation as good business men of their
own best interest would prompt the
new management to buy us out.
Because we have a very good office,
considerably larger and better than
is common in towns of the class of
San Marcos. The material with
which the papor is printed speaks for
itsolf, whilo during a long period we
have added new job material every
year until now wo have a good and
complete outfit in that line. In
short, only a power press - (when it
shall be needed) would bo required
to make the office just about all that
the new administration could reason
ably require. And again our office
is in regular running order, with a
fair and steady patronage. The
"plant" of the Fkee Press moy not
be a very imposing growth, but it is
strongly rooted in the regards of the
mass of the people of this county, and
has proved itself very tenacious of life,
We cannot, therefore, for a moment
suppose that the proposed new man
agement would think of the folly of
adding another office here and creat
ing a new business, when they can find
both thus furnished to their hands
at a fair valuation.
We repoat, then, tbab on the sim
ple condition above stated, we are
ready at any time to cheorfully "step
down and out." If there be any,
whether friends or foes, who fancy
we are indissolubly wedded to tho
business of editing and publishing a
paper in San Marcos, we beg to as
sure them they are very much mis
taken. We by no means deem it es
sential to our hopes of happiness
here or hereafter. After tweuty-eight
years of editorial service we ar quite
willing to "take a rest" We need
scarcely say, therefore, that, while
we favor the new movement as abovo
stated, we would not expect or de
sire any position or connection with
it whatever.
Congress met on Monday. Car
lisle was re-elected Speaker. Tbe

(From Our lingular Oorren pondout)
Washington, Nov. 29, 1887.
Already I have reportod to you the
curront capital gosttip concerning tbe
Cabinet, changes that Mr. Lamar
will be translated to tho Suprome
Bench, that Postmaster General Vilas
is to succeed him, and that Mr.
Dickinson of Michigan, will bo the
latter'a successor. Still another ru
mor is that Mr. Whitney expects to
resign from the Cubinot unless bis
hoalth greatly improves within tbe
next two months, bis friends claim
ing that a man of tho vast wealth and
great social prominence of tbe pre
sent Secretary of tbe Navy, cannot
afford to endanger bis existonco by
further devoting himself to the oner
ous duties incumbent upon him.
Many New York Democrats were
extromely solicitous for the President
to go to his old borne at Buffalo and
vote in the late election, and much
disappointment was felt that he did
not gratify publio expectation in that
respect But the President had a
good reason for absenting himself,
as he had learned from trustworthy
sourcos, that his presence at tbe polls
would have been tbe occasion of an
undignified and unseemly demonstra
tion on tbo part of a club of intensely
partisan' Republicans, as it was their
unpatriotic purpose to challenge Mr.
Cleveland's right to vote, on the
ground that ho is not now a legal
resident of Buffalo. In view of tbis
exposed conspiracy, it is doublful if
Mr. Cleveland again votes during his
Presidency, and when his motive is
understood, it will be applauded by
all unbiased minds.
Messrs Carlisle and Randall are
both in the city, and while neither is
willing to take the publio into his
confidence, through the medium of
the press, it is highly probable that
these great leaders may have an in
formal conference before the meeting
of Congress, with the view of making
"the two wings of the Democracy flap
together" on the tariff question, in
the language of Mr. Randall during a
speech in the Forty-ninth Congress
The forthcoming report of Secretary
Fairchild is awaited with no ordinary
degree of interest by tho financial
world, as it is expected that he will
take advanced ground on tho questions
of the Treasury surplus, ond the sil
ver currency. That tbe Secretary is
laboriously and carefully applying
himself to tho important uudetaking
that devolves upon him, is evidenced
by the fact that to accomplish it he
has for several days confined himself
to the privacy of his home, in order
uot to be diverted from his work by
visitors to the Department.
Secretary Lamar iu bis report,
which is completed bub not yet pub
lished, recommends that tho Inter
State Commerce Commission bo de
tached from the Interior Department
aud made directly responsible to
Congress or the President for its acts,
as at present the Secretary of the
Interior only officiates in the capacity
of disbursing officer for the Com
mission it appearing that he has no
jurisdiction over that body at all.
Thero is a greut pressure of bnsi-
ness at tuo uenerai uanu umco in
the way of issuing agricul tural patents,
2400 having been made out during
tho past month, and others iu course
of preparation will increase the num
ber to 5,000 for the month of Nov
ember, which almost outrivals any
previous record.
The balance of power in the United
States Senate is lodged with the rol
lickiug Riddleberger, tbe Senator
from Virginia, who holds in the hol
low of bis baud tho political future
of three Democratic claimants to 6eats
Messrs Lucas & Faulkner, of West
Virginia, and Mr. Turple, of Indiana.
Senator Riddleberger .stales that he
will endeavor to act as conscientiously
in these controversies as if be were
on the Supreme Bench of the United
Stites.
The Republican Senate has more
than enough chiirniansliips to go
around there being forty-seven Sen
ate committees to ouly thirty-eigbt
Republican Senators, and so it is
likely that tho majority party will
very generously beUw the nine sur
plus places on their Democratic
brethren.
After an exciting election in St.
Louis the peoplo have decided by a
m:iioritT of 4.0OO, that tbe English
l.ingnage only shall be taught in tbe J
public schoola, and that tbe teaching
of Germ vn, French, Latin, Greek.,
etc., was j-ecu'iarly the province of
tbe High School.
