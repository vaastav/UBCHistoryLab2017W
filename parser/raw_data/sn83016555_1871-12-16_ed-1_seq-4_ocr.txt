THE TREATY WITH ENGLAND.
Although the President's message
speaks favorably of this treaty, and rec
ommends the necessary legislation to
carry it into immediate effect, it is highly
probable the Senate will maturely con
sider all of its provisions before ratifying
them. Some of the best minds in the
country have already urged objections to
this treaty that must Lave weight with
the Senate.
General Benjamin F. Butler lias ad
dressed a letter to Senator Ames, in which
he freely criticises the treaty an 1 con
demns it. The general touches first upon
the matter of the fisheries, that subject
being of local and special interest to his
constituents, lie reviews our interest in
the fisheries at some length, and con
cludes that the benefits secured by the
treaty, if carried out, to this country,
will not amount to over seven thousand
dollars a year. Upon this subject Gen
eral Butler says he saw it stated, in what
purports to be a protocol to the treaty,
that the American commissioners opened
the negotiations with an offer to pay a
million dollars in gold fi r this right, or
sixty thousand dollars annually for all
time ior a right which Nova Scotia offered
to sell, and did sell, for seven thousand
d >llars a year. For the right which
General Butler is dispossed to think we
already possess that England concedes
to us by this treaty, viz: "The right
to fish within the three-mile line,
with further permission to land
upon the shore for the purpose
of drying nets and curing fish; j.roe'ule.I,
that in so doing we do not interfere with
private property," we are to concede the
right of all British fishermen to fish in
all our waters for all kinds of fish, except
shell and river fish, and to land on our
shores to cure their fish and dry their
nets, from the forty-fifth to the thirty
ninth parallel, or from Eastport to Dela
ware bay. And in addition the treaty
opens our ports to British fish free of
duty. Upon the subject. General Butler
says:
I
It lias been declared by some that this
question of free importation of fish is a
matter of small consequence. The amount
yearly is much greater than any supposed
money value in the Alabama "claim, the
highest estimate of loss from which has
been set at fourteen million dollars, while
the value of our fisheries is over seventeen
millions annually.
In everv view that General
every view that General But Ur
takes of this part of the treaty he con
siders it extremely unjust and ruinous to
the American fishing interests. In con
cluding this part of the subject, he says:
I grieve, therefore, that so complete an
abandonment of American fishing interests
should have been made by our commis
sioners, and I trust the Senate will not
ratify this portion of the treaty unless
there shall be found portions sufficient
countervailing advantages, so that we can
afford this great loss.
General Butler reviews that part of the
treaty which has reference to our differ
ences with England, growing out of the
late civil war in this country, with a great
deal of force and ability. He takes a pa
triotic and statesmanlike view of the sub
ject, and gives Lis opinions freely and
boldly, yet denies that he de-irts war be
tween tLis country and England. lb
says " no true patriot can ever desire war
for his country ; and I am certain that,
with a knowledge of its expenses and Lor- ,
rors, nothing has ever been further from i
my thoughts than a wish for a conflict of ;
arms. I have never dreamed that war be- 1
tween this country and England is now j
possible, while we are demanding only
what is right, with a determination to I
submit to nothing that is wrong." It |
must be admitti d the language of ;

j
land's wrongs to this country at a period
she was plunged into a terrible civil
war, is at times caustic. But that -Iocs
not imply war.
The very recollection of how England
acted when the gallant ('ommodore Wilkes
arrested Mason and Slidell, while they
were endeavoring to escape to Europe in
the interest of the enemies of this coun
try, is sufficient to arouse such a man as
Butler. For having acted like a bully at
that time in threatening a friendly power
with additional war "if the men were not
delivered up and an apology made," Gen
eral Butler would now give England a
chance to apologize. But the treaty
makes no provision for either restitution
or apology, and this displeases him. The
question of wrong done this country,
through aid and sympathy extended to
the rebellion by England, is referred to a
tribunal of arbitration which is to sit in
Geneva, Switzerland. This tribunal is to
be composed ol' five arbitrators one to be
named by the President of the United
States, one by the Queen of England, one
by the King of Italy, one by tin Presidt lit
of the Swiss Confederation and on;; by
his majesty the Emperor of Brazil. This
is certainly a novel mode of settling the
difficulties our country may have with
foreign powers. If it is not successful in
ascertaining to what extent England
wronged this country in the Alabama af
fair and what restitution should be made,
we trust it will not result in any entang
ling alliances with f ireigu powers
something that Washington was particu
lar to warn his countrymen against in his
farewell message. From the tone of
General Bullet's letter in regard to the
"tribunal of arbitration " w- should judge
he is not pleased \\itlr the manner of dis
posing of the wrongs that were thrust
upon his country when she was not in a
condition to resent them. He thinks the
emperor of Brazil not a proper person to
be on that comms.-ion, from the fact that
he is guilty of similar conduct toward this
country that England i, charged with,
lie also thinks that if the Washington
treaty ''is ratified, and the rules of inter
national law are thus established, land
ing us more stringently than do our own
neutrality laws, which can be repealed at
pleasure, then indeed is a great vantage
ground of the United States to regain our
commerce, lost by British depredations, in
any future war, gone forever, and the com
mercial superiority of England on the seas
is indeed assured." General Butler is also
opposed to that part of the treaty which
provides that "all claims from citizens of
the United States against the government
ot Great Britain, arising out of acts against
their persons and property during the
war. not known as the Alabama claims,
and all claims of the subjects of her Brit
anic 'majesty, arising out of acts com
mitted against their persons or property
during the war, which have been or may
be presented" to a board of commission
ers, shall be determined by them and pain
in accordance with their adjudication. He
thinks the admission of such claims must
lead to the admission of the claims of all
loyal men who lost property by the war.
General Butler's letter to Senator Ames
certainly gives many strong reasons why
the Washington treaty should net be rati
fied by the Senate.
LET US SEE THE 0TKER SIDE
The I'rire Current is responsible for the
assertion that the taxes vLich have been
collected by the federal government to
sustain its credit by the reduction (if the
public debt have " crushed " the people
unnecessarily, because the public credit
ors had never made any demand upon the
Treasury for their money. laterally this
is true to a certain extent, but philosoph
ically it is a complaint that will not stand
the test of a statesmanlike analysis. Ad
mitting that the debt was paid before it
was due, and that the taxes to effect this
settlement were prematurely extracted
from the pockets of the people, is the-r
no wisdom in establishing credit, and
have not the good effects of a large reduc
tion in our annual interest account fully
compensated the country for what little
hardships a small addition to its yearly
burdens have indicted ? Secretary Bout
well had three objects to attain in the
course which he has pursued for the last
three years. First, he had to maintain
faith with the public creditors by paying
the interest promptly, and to demonstrate
that the nation intended to do
this at every sacrifice. This he has j
done so satisfactorily that no j
man feels uneasy about the income which ;
he expects from his bonds. Secondly, he I
•had to fortify the treasury with such |
sums of surplus gold as would enable I
him to insure the steady appreciation of
the national currency. This he has done.
for with the coin which he has heh
national vaults the speculators i
have never been able to depreciate green- i
backs below eighty-three cents. The pre- j
sent price of currency, which is of itself !
in th* |
gold j
,
i
;
: an immense economy, i.s due to th- mas
tery which the revenues of the nation
: gave to its financial agent "ver the
I speculators of Wall street. Thirdly,
| he has ever aimed to establish such
j faith in the integrity and abnegation of
1 the American, that when it applied for
j loans it might borrow on the --11110 terms
! with the most favored nations. He Lad
i to overcome the distrust of the financial
i kings, for it will be remembered how Ilotl-s
j child once declared that no man was safe
who lent money to a republic. What credit
is better than ours at present ? Gold
is d predating in value steadily in !ace of
the profound predictions tLut it would
rise, and every- cent that i.s made by the
appreciation of currency i* a cent deducted
from the expenses of the government. The
State buys cheaper as her p -p. r >.p
proaehes a par valuation.
If we have paid a dollar or two m e- of
taxes, me there not results- that repay u
in loyal satisfaction? While 1 >ther nations
are running behind in their yeaily ac
counts. and heaping up liability , -v
alone of all the mighty p '-.vers that
the earth are striking the men . 'a s of
debt from our limbs and stalking into
greatness, with faith untarnished and re
sources constantly multiplying, utnk r tic
magic power of honesty and ability.
Besides, the people are not "crushed. '
The South committed a grievous sin for
which she i- suffering some hardships,
but she is still mounting the upward
plane', and will soon recover Let le d
ground.

THE INTEREST INCREASES.
As we proceed in the work of investi
gating the papers relative to the removal
of Casey, .sent by Mr. Boutwell to the
Senate, we find the interest greatly in
creased. We publish this morning some
rather pointed expressions of opinion
from members of Congress and ol our
State Legislature. Nearly all of the
signers still live. But not all of them
continue steadfast in the faith. Senator
Kellogg has been, appeased, and no more
rages for the removal of Casey. Patrick
O'Hara has forgotti 11 his wrath, and C. C.
Antoine no longer believes the interests of
the government and the ltepublicun
party demand the immolation of the
"neutral Kentuckian." T. V. Coupland
is happy in his deputyship, and has
ceased to pray for the political decapita
tion ol' the Collector. Possibly he now
thinks the country is safe. -ToLr: Bay,
having sanctified the Customhouse ring
by his distinguished approval and fellow
ship. is as happy in tire present situation
as a clam at spring tide. S. B. Packard
no longer recommends the uncondi
tional removal of James F. Casey from
the office of Collector of Customs of this
port. Neither does .John Bay, nor a good
many others, whose hostility has boon
appeased by an easy appointment. But
it is nut the first time in th-- history of
human affairs that Mahomet has yielded
precedence to the mountain. Mr. Casey,
whom these gentlemen one year ago
accused of being a Democrat, would not
come over to the Republicans, nor yet
appoint some of our pensioners b- office,
so they went over to the Democracy, and
having gained the price of tin ir detec
tion, are now ready to swear till ti. -y are
black in the face that "Colonel" Ca- y is
everything a man should be. He is no
longer incompetent. His selection of
themselves for easy positions disproves
that theory. lie is no longer a neutral
Kentuckian, for that must be something
very bad, which they are -urc their bene
factor the colonel is not. As for His be
ing a Democrat, it does not much matter,
so long as his bread and butter are good,
and hold out. We have an example of a
great personage who had five thousand
followers when he had loaves and fishes
to give out, but on the day of his death
there were but eleven, and one of these
tried to deny his status. And although
Mr. Casey bears no resemblance to a
great man ol any kind that we ever
heard of, his followers are actuated by
the selfish motives of the multitudes re
ferred to.
STILL WAITING AN ANSWER.
V»e confess to downright disappoint
ment in Marshal Packard. The word has
gone forth to their followers that while
Speaker Carter, in "ways that are dark,"
would not knuckle down to Mepliis
topheles himself, yet when boldness and
courage and nerve were requisite, Packard
would prove the Cromwell of the combi
nation; still we find him tamely sub
mitting to reiterated charges that stamp
him cither a willful falsifier or the ted of
one who would tear the Declaration of
Independence to tatters rather than per
mit its glorious enunciations to stand in
the way of his personal ambition.
Marshal Packard declares that, should
the people of Louisiana re-elect Governor
Warmoth—or worse, should they fail to
elect Grant's avowed partisans- martial
law shall, by the President's dictation,
subvert the civil rule of the State. He is
charged, without denying it, of uttering
tliis threat in tin* name and by the au
thority of President Grant. Is he pre
pared. with equal complacency, to de
clare that all men are not created equal,
or that governments are not instituted
among men to secure their inalienable
rights ? Is ho anxious that such charges
as these should be sustained against his
chief:
from Washington
He has kept among us. in times of peace,
standing armies without the consent of our
Legislature.
He has affected to render the military in
dependent of and superior to the civil
power.
For quartering large bodies of armed
troops among us.
In common with the mass of Repub
licans in Louisiana, we desire to have
Marshal Packard define Lis position. If
ms platform, and that of his Democratic
allies, is a return to the arbitrary govern
ment which our fathers revolutionized in
establishing this "land of freedom for all
downtrodden peoples," it is best to have
the issue fairly drawn at once. And we
particularly desire to know how far such
a programme is based upon instructions

Here is another sneaking threat that
troops are being sent to tliis city to
meddle with civil authority. We mention
it for two reasons ; The first is to give
President Grant further evid-nce of how
he is represented down here, and if he
don't like the representation to change it.
The licit is to give our judgment of the
wretches who entertain so poor an "pin
ion of the people of this country as to
suppose they will stand idly by and per
mit a President if so inclined to render
the military superior to the civil power.
e care little Kir the "organ,"
or what it says, further than that
it is regarded as the mouth-pieoe
of men who claim to be the true sup
porters and exponents of the views of
President Grant of men ayLo are in po
litical positions Ly the grace of Grant,
anil are supposed to remain in them no
longer than it pleases the President to
keep them there. For the time being.
President Grant is the representative of
the American people in the chief execu
tive branch of the government. If he
fails to represent them pr-.pt.rlv, he can
not expect to continue in the enjoyment
of their confidence. When lie loos- s
their trust in him. he may rest assured
the reign of his political power will be
short. And we know of no more certain
way for a President to damn himself ii
retrievably damn himself than to under
take to convert this free republic into a
a military despotism. The course of the
Customhouse clique has been such, and
i.s such, if not disavowe 1 by the I'r< si
dent, as to make the people belii ve the
President no longer worthy of their con
fidence. The time is fast approaching
when the people will have to pass upon
the im rits of President Grant at the Lal
lot-box.
Accounts has
to say the city

government of tire present administration
of the city. If this is true, the debi that
has been added to tire city's liabilities
since the present city go vermin nt came
into power must have been contracted un
der former administrations, and remained
over for settlement under the new charter.
The discrepancy between the Mayor's
statement of increased debt and the Ad
ministrator of Accounts' assertion, that
the city s indebtedness has not been in
creased, can be, perhaps, accounted for in
this way. If the Committee of Fifty-one
should discover this to be the case, it will
not redound to tho credit of Mayor Flan
ders. who charged that the extravagance
and incompetency of the present city gov
ernment had increased the debt of the city
in two years several millions of dollars.
Can it be possible that the Mayor only
found a "mare's nest" when he discov
ered the rapid increase of the city's debt ?
1'. GTiara (who on this occasion was so
indignant as to forget he had changed his
name to O Hare) writes a card (not marked
pai'ii to the A ntnjitnl Jtepubltrnn, in which
he uses the following forcible and lim
pidly flowing language:
And no statement kingly attributed to
me bv Warniiitli's mouthpiece must satisfy
the public that no means are scrupled at by
tho* journal to prejudice public opinion.
And all Senator O'Hare, or O'Hara, got
angry at, and boxed Lindley Murray for,
was because we spelled wrongly the name
ol' the paper in which he [instructed the
public and worked "lit printing contracts
until the election of Lieutenant Governor
Pinchback.
Under Speaker Carter's reyim* the ex
penses of the House of Representatives,
during the last session, averaged about
nine thousand dollars per head, counting
members of all politics and factions. Who
got the money we are not yet prepared to
say, but may safely assert that Carter's
crowd beat all who preceded them in the
way of extravagance. If this is the style
of "reform " he means when he declaims
to the indignant populace, it i.s to be
hoped Mr. Carter will give us as little as
possible". The Senate, under better regu
lations for contingent expenses, did not
cost half as much per capita.
< >ur neighbor, the Times, is in a bad
wav. It has contracted a disease that,
according to its own confession, is kill
ing it by degrees. It is very restless in
sleep. ^ Can it be possible that the pricks
of conscience h ire caused it to be afflicted
with so terrible a malady as insomnia ?
The 7 iuies had better secure at once the
servi"fS of the fifty-one eminent doctors
w ho are now employed to cure the finan
cial ills that have afflicted this city for at
least a decade of years. If they can't
"minister to a mind diseased," then there
