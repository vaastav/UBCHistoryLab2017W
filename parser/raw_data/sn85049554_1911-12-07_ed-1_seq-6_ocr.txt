JUDICIAL MONKEY WORK.
An attorney for the defense in the
trial of Dr. Kelly at Des Moines pro
pounded a "hypothetical question,"
which required two hours to read. The
question was directed at an "alienist"
and bears upon the sanity of the de
fendant.
Now if this were not so entirely ser
ious it would be comic. Imagine a
question two hours long propounded to
a witness, requiring definite answer
I and to be passed upon by a jury gath
ered from a common citizenship! The
question no doubt calls for direct af
firmative or negative answer. Such
a question is much le«s joke than out
rage of privilege.
Kelly, a drunken drug-besotted type
of degeneracy, shot and killed two men.
For this crime he is on trial. The duty
and desire of the court may be as
sumed to uncover the facts and the
truth that a verdict in accordance with
the law and the facts may be rendered.
The efforts of the defense under the
habitual processes of so-called "crlm
inal lawyer®?' is to befog, embarrass
and confuse the jury, trap the court by
demands that the jury shall be in
struted one way or another and gen
erally weave a barrier of technicalities
and confusion between their client anu
the violated laws. What other purpose
I could a "hypothetical question" of
6,000 words and two hours' duration be
calculated?
Perhaps the judicial monkeywork ap
peals to some as a safeguarding of in
dividual right's but in the minds of
most men it breeds that uneasiness and
contempt of courts which has become
general. Why should it be permitted?
Does anyone believe or imagine that
Kelly's just rights before a court and
jury include such a travesty upon Ju
dicial investigation of his crime and
his condition as a question which re
quires two hours for utterance? It is
monkey work, legal monlsey work, as
Harry Lehr's famous dinner was social
monkey work.
RILEY'S LAST POEM.
James Whltcomb Riley, "the Hoos
ier poet," has laid down the pen. He
has just made announcement that his
work is ended. Impaired health has
caused the creator of homely types of
Indiana to cease his labors.
Riley, distinctly Indlanan, has given
to the world a series of home tales in
poetry which are now regarded as
classic in American literature. These
efforts are so human, so touchingly
realistic, so tender and true, that they
have won for the author a lasting
place in the hearts of his countrymen.
As conditions in America change,
as they must change, and another type
his supplanted the old "Hoosier" type
in Indiana, the poems of Riley may be
come less appealing, but Riley's poems
it would seem, should live for years to
come, despite the dialect in which
they are written, because of the ele
ment of human interest so pronounced
in his work.
Fifty years from now the American
school boy may appear in terror on the
rostrum of the district school house
to recite "The Frost is on the Pump
kin," on exhibition day, and the little
ones, in fear and trembling, will creep
I under the covers at night after mother
has repeated the wierd tale of the gob
lins.
The tomorrow of poetry is an un
solvable problem and a prediction as to
Riley's place In literature in future
years can not be now determined. To
day, however, there is a tendency to
give less thought to the homely poetic
tales of Riley and his kind, and more
attention to the unreal art of Kipling
anrl his type, with their uncanny ramb
lings of "the female of the specie,"
and the "hank of hair."
It is to be regretted that Riley must
halt his work while in the prime of
life—he is but 59 years old, an age
when poets are usually at the com
mencement of their greatest labors—
but he has declared that his last poem
is written and the book closed. But he
has made the world smile and forget
its sorrows and he who can do that
may close his life's book without a
sigh.
ESCAPING THE PENALTY,
Carl Snyder, in an article in a recent
issue of Colliers' Weekly, declares
that "the murderous proclivities of the
United States are simply a horror, and
the administration of the criminal law
in this country is exactly what Presi
dent Taft said of it: 'A disgrace to our
civilization.'"
Despite this assertion from a man
who has evidently carefully studied
the subject, and despite the fact that
every daily paper announces from one
to a half dozen or more murders, the
best statistics to be secured will show
that the number of murders during the
last three or four years, as compared
with the decade previous, show a de
crease. However, on the other hand,
the chances for conviction of criminals
seem to have lessened.
After stimming up the evidence Mr.
Snyder concludes that the chances of

It to better than a 10 to 1 shot that
you will never be sentenced to the
penitentiary.
It Is betted than an 80 to 1 ehot that
you will never be hanged or electro
cuted.
These facte, for as such they muat
be considered, are startling to the per
son who has prided himself as living
in a law abiding country where the
wicked are punished, and the right
eventually maintains. The fact will,
or should cause the opponent of capi
tal punishment or the exponent of the
"unwritten law" to stop and consider.
Another Btartllng fact is that In pro
portion more murders are committed
by native Americans than by our for
eign born citizens. This Is explained
by the fact that the foreigner comcs
to this country with a goodly respect
for the law. As against our small per
centage of convictions the countries of
Europe can show percentages of con
victions from 50 to 90 per cent.
Crime crops out in the second gen
eration of the citizens of foreign ex
traction. Our prison records show that
the prison population is about two and
one-halt' times greater proportionately
among those born of foreign parentage
fhan among-- our native born. This
would prove that crime among the off
spring of foreign born is greater than
among native born, or that our social
condition is such that the native has
greater chance to escape the penalty
of his crimes than the child of a for
eign land.
The condition of affairs in America
today may be largely charged to the
laxity of the courts or to the exist
ence of too many laws by which the
guilty may escape his just deserts.
Captain Peter C. Hains, convicted of
murder, serves a short sentence
and receives a pardon. Dr. B.
C. Hyde, secures a new trial, after
having been convicted, because the
word "the" had been omitted from be
lore the word "State" in papers per
taining to the trial. Mrs. Gerirude Gib
son Patterson was given her liberty
because we have come to recognize a
foolish mythical code known as an
"unwritten law." It is small wonder
that human life is taken when it is so
easy to escape the punishment.
Every man and woman is entitled to
a fair trial and to be Judged according
to the evidence in the case as shown at
trial. But, it Is neither just to society
as a -whole nor to the Individual
who serves his term In the peniten
tiary for petty crime, that the murderer
should be allowed to go unpunished be
cause our laws permit of technicalities
to interfere with the carrying out of
justice, or because the takers of human
life may walk to freedom thru "unwrit
ten laws," or because a woman has a
pretty face and figure
Life is sacred and It Is the duty of
the courts to protect It insofar as they
can remove from society those known
to be guilty of murder.

There Is one thing I want you young
college men to remember aa long as
you live. It Is this:
Whenever you observe a group of
men ordering In the drinks, swilling
down the beer, trading chimney-sweep
stories, spitting out the profanity, be
very sure that these men are rarely
or never Big Business.
They will generaly be found to be a
bunch of small-place Nobodies jigging

Business is sitting out there in the car

and keeps itself away from that kind
of society.
Big Business Is nearly always Real
Religion.
If you have time to sit down awhile
I will try to tell you how I proved this
out last summer. It was a wild chance
that only a harum-scarum fellow like
me would have taken.
Some friends motored on from Chi
cago and we Joined them here at
Coatesville In an automobile trip thru
New England, visiting schools and col
leges.
We came to one college where those
in authority were rash enough to ask
us to address the student body. There
were five of us in the party—William
Peterson, Andrew Stevenson, James
Hardin, of Chicago Charles Huston
and myself, of Coatesville. There were
between four and five hundred bright
young fellows who made up the audi
ence that filled the chapel.
When the rest of the party who
were the real orators of the aggrega
tion got thru, the audience was about

said, "I pity you. Indeed, I do but you

One or two fellows on the front row

The other day one of the big Atlan
tic liners had Its hundreds of peace

crazy drunk In the liner's grog-shop
and drowned himself at sea attracted
more attention than the one or two
thousand sensible people who let the
«tuff alone and kept sober and attend
ed to their own business.
So in the business world. The good
men attract so little attention that the
world forgets that Big Business is al
most all in the hands of godly men.
Those other fellow® who are seen play

bosses." I am going to prove this. But
to begin with I want you to assent to
two propositions.
The Two Propositions.
First.—Any concern that can afford
to pay as much as $4,000 for a single
full page advertisement for a single
time In a big magazine, and then also
to put it In a whole lot of other maga
zines. must do a tremendous big tous
nfFord to pay so much for
publicity.
And any advertiser that can afford
to put big sign boards along all the
railroads, and cover all the dead walls,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific must
have a "elungln" big business to stand
the enormous cost.
Second—The man who can swing a
business of this sort Is certainly no
