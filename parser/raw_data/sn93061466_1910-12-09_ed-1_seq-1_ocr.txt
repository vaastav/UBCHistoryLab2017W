OMISSIONS WILL COST
MANY VOTES
Voters Demands ignored by the
Delegates
The absence of the initiative,
, the Austrajian Ballot, the direct
primary election provision and
the worse thai; absence of a re
ferendum are sins of omission
which will lose for the constitu
tion of New Mexico numerous
votes. Were the amendment of
the constitution anything like
practicable under the terms
thereof, these omissions would
not appear so flagrant, but with
anendment practically out of the
question, the people demand and
should have some recourse. Un
der our present iniquitous elect
ion law, the bosses of the var
ious counties choose the officers,
and not the people. Right here
in Torrance county only a few
years past, almosta score of vot
ers were, practically disfranchis
ed merely because they did not
vote as the bosses directed. In
Valencia county precinct No.23,
under our beautiful system of
elections, the names of voters on
the registration books, several of
the parties having been dead at
the time, were voted in alphabe
tical order, and all voted the
same ticket, In Sam Miguel coun
ty even a3 late as the last elect
ion, the county commissioners
named boards of registration en
tirely from one political party,
no representation whatever.
Of course the bosses do not
want an up-to date election sys
tem, nor the direct primary . It
would be more difficult and remove
expensive for them to control the
common peoole in their vo tm
under some other system t han
we have at present. It is clai; ned
by the bosses that the native peo
ple would be practical y dis
franchised vvere the" Austra lian
ballot adopted as the native peo
ple do not and cannot undersf zmd
that system. Are we to be! i?ve
that our voters are so much 1 nore
dense and ignorant than t hose
of our neighboring states, jqo
rado for example? Colorado has
aformofthe Australion ballot
system for a number of years,
which makes more difficul fc the
control of the voters by the bos
ses, and which has worked iair
ly well, a great deal better . than
our obnoxious system.
The bosses who framed the
constitution were working- for
themselves and themselves on,'y.
After fixing the salaries to .be
paid state officers at fig uros
much hiirher than is paid simi
lar officers in older and wealth
ier states, the bosses the n pro
ceed to fix the election system so
that none except thorns alves car
be chosen for the offices. And
now they are howling '-'a vote a
o-ainst the constitution is a vote
against statehood." Satan him
self never invented a greater lie
than that. The enabling act pro
vides that in case the firnt con
stitution i i turned down by the
voters at the polls, the delegates
shala,;รก'-i ;s-.:mb''! and draft
another cuihiitiuun. and also
provision h ni ! that shouAI the
appropriation or $100,000 by con
gress 'to defray the expenses
prove insufficient, the territory
shall provide the deficiency.
Notice
The school directors of each
school district have been request
ed to ascertain if there be any
needy families within their dis
tricts, and report to the under
signed as soon as possible, and
in :rder that such people may
obtain help f ron this source, the
needy ones will be requested to
bring an order signed by at least
one of the directors of the dis
trict in which they live. And
should there be any such in Es
tancia, they will likewise be ex
pected to bring an order signed
by a member of their school-board.
AtDresenta whole beef has
been donated tobe divided among
the needy, and in order that the
Iwfif mav be divided, I must have
the names of the persons and al
so anorder from the school direct
ors. I may be found at E. Rom
ero's store every Saturday and
at my home the balance of
the time. '
I will be pleased to receive any
donations from anyone, in order
that the needy may be cared for,
for the present, until such time
as other arrangements can be
made.
Now I am aware of the fact
that some are liable to let their
pride stand in the way of mak
ing their needs known, but in
such a time as this people ought
not hesitate to speak up and let
their wants be known. Now if
the school directors will work in
connected with me on this, by
the help of the good people who
will donate, no one will suffer.

Tail's Message
President Taft's message to

No newspaper of which we have
heard has attempted to publisn
the message in its entirely, most

small nortion of it, something
like 20.000 words.. When it
comes to verbosity, Little Willie

his. It would require about fifty
columns of ordinary newspaper
size to contain the whole message
