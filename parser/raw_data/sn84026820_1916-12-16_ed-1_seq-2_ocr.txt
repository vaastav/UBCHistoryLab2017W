STAND.
What They Have To Show After
Two Years Of Hostilities and
Millions Of Lives Sacrificed.
I Germany's move for peace
comes just two years and 133 days
after she declared war on Russia
and two years and 129 days after
England declared war on Ger
many.
German Territory Held by the
Allies — The western edge of
Alsace-Lorraine.
Austro-Hungarian Territory Cap
tured by the Alliei
Galicia and all of Bukowina and
the southern fringe of Trentino as
well as the western border of the

-About half of
Turkish Territory Captured by
the Allies —All of Northeastern

Bulgarla Territory Taken by the
Allies— None.
Entente Territory Occupied by
the German Allies —Northeastern
France, practically all of Belgium,
Poland and Lithuania, more than
half of Roumania, all of Servia and
Montenegro and nearly all of Al
bania, as well as part of Persia
and Egypt. Some of Greek Mace
donia is occupied by the German
Bulgarian forces, although Greece
is not in a state of war.
Germany has lost all her over
seas colonies.
Berlin.—Peace proposals have been
made by Germany and her allies,
Austro-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria,
to Great Britain and her allies, France,
Russia, Italy, Portugal, Serbia and
Roumania.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
announced to the Reichstag that Ger
many, together with her allies, "con
scious of their responsibility before
God, before their own nations, before
humanity," had proposed to the hostile
powers to enter on peace negotiations.
The proposals, which express the
purpose of. the Central Powers "to
enter forthwith on peace negotiations
with a view to lasting peace," are
contained in identical notes from Ger
many, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and
Bulgaria to the representatives of the
neutral powers protecting the inter
ests of the Teutonic Allies in hostile
countries. These diplomatists—in the
case of Germany the representatives
•of the United States, Spain and
Switzerland—are asked to bring the
aote to the attention of the nations at
war with the Central Powers. The
aote has also been transmitted to the
Vatican and all neutral nations.
Terms Not Given.
No terms are mentioned in the pro
posal or the note to the allied powers.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,
before delivering a remarkable speech
In the Reichstag and reading the por
tentious note, received, one after an
other, the representatives of the
United States, Spain and Switzerland
ir.d handed each a copy of the note.
Before the Chancellor entered the
Reichstag the building was surrounded
by an enormous crowd.
THE TEUTONS' PEACE NOTE,
Prepared To Continue War Until
Bitter End, But Desirous To
Avoid Further Bloodshed.
Berlin, December 12.—Following
is the text of the note addressed
by Germany and her allies to the
hostile governments:
"The most terrific war ever ex
perienced in history has been rag
ing for the last two years and a
half over a large part of the world
—a catastrophe which thousands
cf years of common civilization
unable to prevent, and which
was
injures the most precious achieve
ments of humanity.
TELEGRAPH TICKS.
Representative Lewis, of Maryland,
author of the Parcel Post Law, intro
duced a bill in the House proposing
government ownership of the public
telephone system in the capital.
Appropriation Bill;
carrying approximately $9,000,000, first
of the annual supply measures, was
passed by the House without a roll
call.
The Indian
John McVickar, 73 years old, once
president of the International Typo
graphical Union and formerly editor
of the Detroit News, died in Chicago.
The country's manufacturing indus
1914 turned out products
than $24,000,000 and
tries in
valued at more
employed 8,000,000 persons.
The Sena'e adopted the committee
amendment to the Immigration Bill,
which would exclude Hindus and other
Asircics without mentioning them by
name, and which eliminates from the
bill all reference to passport agree
meats.
"Our aims are not to shatter
nor annihilate our adversaries.
"In spite of our consciousness
of our military and economic
strength and our readiness to con
tinue the war- (which has been
forced upon us) until the bitter
end, if necessary; at the same time
prompted by the desire to avoid
further bloodshed and make an
end to the atrocities cf war, the
four allied powers propose to enter
forthwith into peace negotiations.
"The propositions which they
bring forward fcr such negotia
tions and which, have for their ob
ject a guarantee of the existence
of the honor and liberty of evolu
tion for their nations are, accord
ing to their firm belief, an appro
priate basis for the establishment
of a lasting peace.
"The four allied powers have
been obliged to take up arms to
defend justice and the liberty of
national evolution. The glorious
deeds of our armies have in no
way altered their purpose. We al
ways maintained the firm belief
that our own rights and justified
claims in no way control the rights
of these nations.
"The spiritual and material
progress which were the pride of
Europe at the beginning of the
twentieth century are threatened
with ruin.
Germany and her
allies, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria
and Turkey, gave proof of their
unconquerable strength In this
struggle.
"They gained gigantie advan
tages over adversaries superior in
number and war material. Our
lines stand unshaken against ever
repeated attempts made by armies.
"The last attack in the Balkans
has been rapidly and victoriously
overcome. The most recent events •
have demonstrated that further
continuance of the war will not
result in breaking the resistance of
our forces and the whole situation
with regard to our troops justifies
our expectation of further suc
cesses.
"If in spite of this offer of peace
and reconciliation the struggle
should go on, the four allied
powers are resolved to continue to
a victorious end, but they disclaim
responsibility for this before hu
manity and history. The imperial
government through the good
offices of your excellency, ask the
government (here is inserted the
name of the neutral power ad
dressed in each Instance) to bring
this communication to the knowl
edge of the government of (here is
inserted the name of the belliger
ent)."
WHAT THE GERMAN TERMS
MAY BE.
Evacuation Of Belgium, But the
Possession Of Alsace and
Lorraine.
Washington, December 12.—Re
cent dispatches to the German Em
bassy, covering a wide range cf
subjects, indicate a belief that the
general terms might be in sub
stance as follows:
A restoration of the status quo
existing before the war. This in
cludes the evacuation of Belgium
and the restoration of the occupied
portiens of northern France with
the exception of Alsace and Lor
raine.
No authorized expression was ob
tainable from the embassy as to
whether conditions would be at
tached to the restoraticn of Bel
gium and French territory, but it
was understood that the German
idea was to make provision for
the future neutrality of Belgium
and probably propose defortiflea
tion, particularly cf the city of
Antwerp.
It was also understood that no
conditions amounting to economic
control of the mineral lands of -
nerthern France would likely be
asked.
All Germany's lost colonies she
expects to be returned.
Her possessions In the Pacific,
however, are not a subject of great
concern and the Berlin govern
ment is understood to be ready to
relinquish the claim cn Kiao
Chau.
The security of Turkey in pos
session of Constantinople probably
would be insisted upon by the
Central Powers, as well as the re
storation of Albania.
The establishment of independ
ent kingdoms ip Lithuania and
Poland would be one of the factors
. in the German proposal, although
that nart of Poland possessed by
Germany at the outbreak of the
war would not be includéd.
What adjustment would be made
to cover the Trentino region be
tween Austria and Italy, or any pro
visions affecting Egypt, the Suez
Canal, Mesopotamia, or the gate
ways of control to the Indian Em
pire are not made clear in German
quarters here.
$1,000,000 FOR FISH HATCHERIES.
House Bill Provides For One In Mary
land Or Virqinia.
Washington.—Twenty fish hatch
eries In as many states would be pro
vided at a cost of about $1.000,000 by
a bi'l which passed the House. They
would be in Alabama, Louisiana, Flor
ida, Georgia, South or North Carolina.
Maryland or Virginia. Oregon, Texas
Oklahoma, Illinois, Washington, Ari
zona, New Mexico, Michigan, Idaho.
Missouri, Pennsylvania, De 1 aware or
New Jersey, Minnesota and California.
The Swiss government decided to
favor the single-phase system for
electrifying the railways in preference
to the third rail, because it costs 10
per cent, less to make the change.
Melted j>araffin as a dressing for
wounds is used by a Paris sur
open
geon, as it does not burn the flesh, and
when it solidifies retains heat and aids
in healing.
This country produces nearly $5,000,
000 worth of natural mineral waters a
year.
The Balkan situation is consid
ered so delicate it would have to
be untangled in- the peace confer
ence.
Entente Will
Discuss Note
Britain Disposed To Keep On Fighting.
Not Likely Now To Make
Terms Germany Would
Accept.
London.—Peace is a step nearer, but
still far off.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg'a
speech before the Reichstag is no sur
prise to British officildom. It has met
with a cold and unresponsive recep
tion here, however, for no matter how
war-weary the people are, they are in
no frame of mind to accept peace now.
Hollweg Waited Too Long.
Hollweg has delayed too long. He
should have spoken before the political
crisis in the allied capitals. Now the
people interpret it as a request for
and not an offer of peace.
Before the Allies can reply they
must hold a joint conference. This
undoubtedly will be done immediately.
The reply indubitably will contain
terms which Germany will not be like
ly to meet, with the war map in its
present condition. Premier Lloyd
George probably will give the official
announcement of the British attitude
in Parliament. His present views are
well known, and it Is safe to assume
that they will govern the nature of
the reply.
Wilson Eager
To Push Peace
The President Will Await the Formal
German Offer and Feel the English
Pulse Before Taking Chances
Of a Snub.
President Wilson may gladden the
whole Christian world with a message
of peace which will make this Christ
mas memorable in history. It is in
timated in a quarter close to the Presi
dent that he is giving the most earnest
consideration to the form in which
he will present to the allied powers
the proposal of Germany and her
allies for a discussion of terms of
peace.
This intimation—and it was a strong
intimation—gave rise to the impres
sion that the President in presenting
the German communication to the
Entente Powers, might go t much
farther than necessity requires; that
is, he might not merely content him
self with transmitting Germany's pro
posal to the Entente without comment,
but might accompany it with a note in
which he would point out to Great
Britain, France, Russia, Italy and the
other governments allied with them
that the United States was deeply in
terested in the German effort for peace
and request those to whom the com
munication was addressed to give it
their most careful consideration.
SHARK SKINS FOR LEATHER.
Bureau Of Fisheries Investigating Its
Possibilities.
Washington.—Use of shark skins as
a substitute for leather is being in
vestigated by the United States Bureau
of Fisheries as a possible solution \Of
the high cost of animal skins. Al
ready, says a bureau statement, an ac
ceptable leather is being made from
shark skins in some foreign countries
ind in the United States there has
been a limited demand for the skins
is coverings for smaller articles. Flor
ida fishermen will supply large shark
-kins for the experiments. The Gov
ernment is furnishing the fishing
tackle. Men in the lighthouse service
olso have been directed to catch
sharks.
TORNADO HITS LOUISIANA TOWN.
Business Section Of Atlanta Demol
ished And Child Killed.
Atlanta, La.—A tornado, which
swept over this town virtually demol
ished the business section, causing a
loss of about $40,000. Among the
buildings destroyed were the Catholic,
lethodist and Baptist Churches and
the depot of the Louisiana Railway
ind Navigation Company.
NIVELLE TO COMMAND.
Joffre Is Supplanted As First Step To
ward Reorganizing.
Paris.—General Nivelle, commander
of the French troops at Verdun, has
been appointed commander-in-chief of
the armies of the north and north
east. The official announcement of
this appointment says it is the first
step toward the reorganization of the
higher command.

Sinking of Marina Violation of
Promises to U. S.
FACTS IN CASE SENT BERLIN
State Department To Give German
Foreign Office Chance To Furnish
Further Evidence Before
Taking Next Step.
Washington, D. C.—Information as
sembled at the State Department and
believed by some officials to present a
clear-cut violation of German pledges
In the sinking of the British steamer
Marina with the loss of six American
lives has been forwarded to Beylin for
submission to the German Foreign
Office.
It was announced at the department
that the evidence had been sent as a
matter of courtesy, to allow the Im
perial Government to offer any other
facts it may have before the United
States takes Its next step. Officials
Indicated also that any move by this
Government might be delayed until
complete Information concerning the
British liner Arabia, for which Great
Britain has been asked, could be sent
to Berlin.
In response to inquiries, Germany
has admitted the torpedoing without
warning of both the Marina and
Arabia, stating that her submarine
commanders took them for transports
and asking the United States to fur
nish any evidence It might have to the
contrary. In the case of the Arabia,
Great Britain has been requested to
furnish official data to establish
whether the Peninsular and Oriental,
liner was in Government service, al
though all information now at hand
Indicates that when sent down she
was passing through the Mediter
ranean on a regular voyage with pas
sengers and freight.
As to the Marina, officials regard
the case as complete. According to
the evidence, while carrying a cargo
of horses and other freight she was
torpedoed and sunk without warning
100 miles from shore in a high sea,
with no provision for the safety of
those on board. Many horse tenders,
including six Americans, were lost. In
vestigation has developed, it is said,
that the ship had not been under char
ter or requisition by the British Gov
ernment at any time during the war,
but had transported horses at so much
per head for the Allies.
It is generally believed that when
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing are ready to act, the next step
will take the form of a communica
tion to clear up any doubt that may
exist at Berlin as to the interpretation
given by the American Government to
the German pledges given after the
attack on the Sussex.
As In the Sussex catastrophe, offi
cials here point out, the Marina and
Arabia cases have demonstrated the
menace to innocent neutral lives in
the practice frequently followed by
German submarine commanders of at
tempting to ascertain the character of
a ship bv periscope observations. The
United States has demanded that the
character of a vessel be determined
beyond doubt before an attack is
made that endangers the lives of its
citizens and contends that this can be
done practically only by actual visit
and search.
FEDERAL WAGE INCREASE.
Bill Reported To House Carries Appro
priation For Employes.
Washington.—The legislative, execu
tive and judicial appropriation bill re
ported to the House Monday carries a
10 per cent, increase in pay for em
ployes receiving less than $1,200 a
year, and 5 per cent, for those be
tween $1.200 and $1,800. The increase,
first of the kind in almost 50 years,
would be limited to the next fiscal
year and apply only to executive de
partments except agriculture, the
judicial establishments and the library
of Congress.
NO DOUBT AS TO PENNSYLVANIA.
Official Count Of Vote Shows It Gave
Hughes 181,950 Plurality.
Harrisburg, Pa.—The official count
of the vote cast in Pennsylvania for
Presidential electors at the recent elec
tion was completed and shows that
Charles E. Hughes had a plurality over
President Wilson of 181,950. The first
elector on each party ticket received
the highest vote. The vote was as
follows: .Republican, 703,734; Demo
cratic, 521,784, Socialist, 42,637; Pro
hibition, 28,525; Industrialist, 417.
Total vote cast for President 1,297,097.
J. E. OSBORNE RESIGNS.
Assistant Secretary Of State Will Re
turn To Wyoming.
Washington.—John E. Osborne, As
sistant Secretary of State, resigned
and will return within the month to
his home in Rawlins, Wyo., to devote
himself to his private business. His
successor has not been named. He
was appointed in 1913 and with one or
two exceptions held the office longer
than any predecessor.
ADVERTISERS FAVOR IT.
National Association Approves In
crease In Price Of Newspapers.
Boston.—The Association of Nation
al Advertisers at its annual meeting
here adopted resolutions approving
"reasonable increases in the selling
price of periodicals and newspapers"
because of the higher cost of white
paper.

FIVE IN NEW
Lloyd-GeorgeSucceeds In Form
ing New Ministry.
PREMIER ALMOST DICTATOR
Takes Place Denied Asquith—Earl
Curzon, Lord Meiner, Bonar
Law and Arthur Hender
son His Aids.
London.—The official list of the new
Ministry follows the unofficial fore
casts, with two or three
changes. Mr. Lloyd-George, Lord Mil
ner, Earl Curzon, Andrew Bonar Law
and Arthur Henderson form what is
officially termed the War Cabinet,
while the others, who ordinarily have
been designated as Cabinet Ministers,
are called heads of departments.
An important point in this novel or
ganization is that it concentrates far
more power in the hands of the Prime
Minister than the British system has
ever known before. Mr. Lloyd-George's
proposals to Premier Asquith were for
a war council, of which the Premier
should not be a member, although he
should have the power of passing on
its work. Mr. Lloyd-George has not
hesitated to place himself in the posi
tion more closely resembling a dicta
torship than he was willing to give his
predecessor.
The War Cabinet will hold daily ses
sions directing the prosecution of the
war, and the freedom of Mr. Lloyd
George, Lord Milner and Mr. Hender
son from department duties will allow
them to devote all their time to the
War Council.
The complexion of the new Govern
ment is 12 Liberals, 15 Unionists, 3
Laborites and the presidents of the
Boards of Trade and Education and
the Shipping Controller, who have
been attached to no parties.
The most important new officials
are the food and shipping controllers.
Sir Robert Finlay's renunciation of
the pension attached to the office of
Lord High Chancellor will be a popu
lar stroke. The Lord Chancellor
draws £10,000 in office and a pension
of £5,000 after his retirement. There
has been much discussion over the
cost of this largely ornamental office
recently. Three retired Chancellors
are drawing pensions, and Lord Buck
master will make the fourth, having
seen two years' service.
T. P. O'Connor gives notice of a
motion in the House of Commons for
the formation of a series of commis
sions in Parliament on the French
model, for co-operation with the Min
isters in conducting the war.
The measures of the new Govem
minor
ment for the control of food supplies
will be preceded by one for the entire
control of the liquor trade, according
Absolute
to well-informed sources,
prohibition of the consumption of
spirits except medicinally, and restric
tions on the beer trade, are expected.
The whole resources of the spirit
trade, it is believed, will be put under
«täte control early in the new year
and the accumulated stocks diverted
to other purposes than drink. The
distillation of whiskey and gin will be
prohibited.

Burleson Recommends That Tele
phone And Telegraph Systems
Be Taken Over By
Government.
Washington. — Pjstmasteç - General
Burleson's annual report, just issued
declares there was a Postoffice De
partment surplus of $5,200,000 during
the present year and enumerates a3
among the year's accomplishments im
provement of the parcel post, exten
sion oi city and rural deliveries and
development of the Postal Savings
system.
A surplus of $12,500,000 is shown,
says the report, for three years of the
four the administration has been in of
fice, and it calls attention to deficits
under previous administrations.
The department makes many recom
mendations for improvement of the
service. Some of the most important
are these:
That early action be taken by Con
gress declaring a Government monop
oly over all utilities for the public
transmission of intelligence and that
as soon as possible the telephone and
telegraph facilities of the United
States be incorporated into the postal
establishment.
That $300,000 be appropriated now
for acquiring telegraph and telephone
utilities in Alaska, Porto Rico and
Hawaii.
That second-class postal rates be re
vised to make second-class matter pay
more of its share of transportation ex
pense and that the 1-cent rate be ap
plied to all so-called drop letters.
That public buildings erected for
postoffice purposes be standardized
and that their costs be commensurate
with the needs of the service.
That funds be expended in a num
ber of large cities for buildings not
of ornamental design, but designed to
accommodate the postal service be
fore more money is spent in smaller
towns where buildings are not needed
and cannot be justified.
That changes be made in the pres
ent building policy which imposes a
fixed charge on the department that
has grown burdensome.
That the classified service be ex
tended to include the position of post
master at offices of the first, second
and third classes.
That the department be authorized
to bond its employes, so that the
Government may be protected more
adequately and that relief may be af
forded officials and employes of the
service.
That the pay of rural carriers be
equalized by fixing salaries on the
basis of the number of pieces and
weight of mail transported, length of
routes and time required to serve
them, instead of solely on length of
routes as at present.
That $100,000 be appropriated ' for
experiments in aerial transportation
of mail.
Growth of the parcel post will cut
the cost of living to the city dweller,
the report declares. The service is
now handling 90.000,000 packages
month. Liberal changes in its
a
regu
lations have done much to bring about
its extension, it is declared.
CASHIER SHOT BY BANDIT DEAD.

UNITED STATES
]
Production Increasing Faster
Than Population.
THE BEEF SUPPLY GROWING
Secretary Of Agriculture Points To
Further Great Possibilities
Held Out By Till
able Lands.
Washington.—Fears that the popula
tion of the United States is growing
fast that it will outstrip the pro
duction of food are set at rest by the
annual report of Secretary of Agricul
ture David F. Houston, just made to
so
Congress.
The production of foods In the
United States has held Its own in some
branches and has increased in others.
The alarming decline in beef produc
tion which set In some time ago reach
ed the lowest point In 1913, and since
then has increased materially. At the
time there has been a marked
same
increase in the production of swine.
Sheep have declined slightly. More of
these meat animals have been slaugh
tered under Government supervision
during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1916, than ever before, the report
states. The heaviest slaughtering haa
been accompanied by an increase in
the number of living animals, how
ever.
Secretary Houston says that the
situation gives reason for the bright
est optimism, it being indicated that
the United States cannot only supply
its own food needs, but can feed a
large proportion of the people of the
outside world.
The report states that the Depart
ment has energetically worked through
the eradication of disease and the de
velopment of stock raising to increase
the food supply. He recommends the
inauguration of a vigorous campaign
against tubereculosis in hogs and cat
tle, which, he estimates, is causing an
nual losses in the United States of
$25,000,000.
The report states that the secret of
continuing to feed the world lies in
the expansion by the American people
of the acreage of tilled lands. Food
crops should be stabilized and better
regulated, he declares. Crops should
be rotated scientifically, the Secretary
declares, and the entire business of
tilling the soil should be placed on a
more scientific basis.
A marked improvement in the qual
ity of foods and drugs offered the pub
lic has been brought about through
rigorous enforcement of the food and
Drugs act, the report says.
NEW U-BOAT NOTE MAY BE SENT.
Washington Stirred By Activities Of
German Submarines.
Washington.—More definite Infor
mation as to the facts involved in
recent activities by German sub
marines has brought the situation to
a point where a new note to Germany,
designed to clear up any doubt as
to the Interpretation of the Berlin
Government's submarine pledges to
the United States, appears to be
among the possibilities of the near
future.
President Wilson has given careful
attention to the evidence in the cases *
of several of the vessels recently at
tacked, but has given no indication of
what his decision will be. It waB
stated positively that no course had
been decided upon, but beyond this
and a reiteration that the American
Government had not in any way al
tered its stand on the submarine
