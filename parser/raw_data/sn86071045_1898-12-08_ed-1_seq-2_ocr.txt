THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
MEETING OF CONGRESS^
The second or short session of the 55th
Congress of the United States met at
Washington. Monday noon, and the
Congress will expire at midnight of
----- March Bi.
Both halls and the galleries were
crowded, and the President's Message
wu listened to attentively, and then
Congress adjourned until next day.
THE MESSAGE.
The Message gives no idea of the
President's intentions regarding the
Philippines and Cuba. He reviews the
war and the events leading up 1o it, and
seems to be awaiting the final signing
of the Peace Articles at Paris.
Speaking of a Maritime policy he
says:
"The annexation of Hawaii and the
changed relations of the United States
to Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines
resulting from the war, compel the
prompt adoption of a maritime policy
by the United States. There should be
established regular and frequent steam
ship communication, encouraged by the
United States, under the American flag,
with the newly acquired islands. Spain
furnished its colonies, at an annual cost
of about two millions of dollars, steam
ship lines communicating with a portion
of the world's markets as well as with
trade centers of the home government.
The United States will not undertake
to do less. It is our duty to furnish the
people with facilities, under national
control, for their export and import
trade. It will be conceded that the
present situation calls for legislation
which shall be prompt, durable and
liberal.
The part which American merchant
vessels and their seamen performed in
the war with Spain demonstrates that
this service, furnishing both pickets
and the second line of defense, is a
national necessity, and should be en
pfv couraged in every constitutional way.
Details and methods for the accom
plishment of this purpose are discussed
in the report of the secretary of the
treasury, to which the attention of (x>n
grcss is respectfully invited. "
Other extracts from the Message of
general interest are as follows:
Porto Rico and Cuba.
The Porto Rican joint commission
Bpeedl> accomplished its task, and by
October 18 the evacuation of the island
was completed. Tbe United States flag
was raised over the island at noon on
that day. The administration of its af
fairs has been provisionally intrusted to
a military governor until the Congress
shall otherwise provide. The Cuban
joint high commission has not yet ter
minated its labors. Owing to the diffi
inlties in the way of removing the large
numbers of Spanish troops still in Cuba,
the evacuation cannot be completed be
fore the Ist of January next.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the
protocol. I appointed William R. Day,
lately secretary of state; Cushman K.
Davis, William P. Fry and George
Gray, senators of the United States,
and Whitelaw Ried, to be the peace
commissioners on the part of the Unit
ed States. Proceeding in due season to
Paris, they were met on the first of Oc
tober by five commissioners similarly ap
pointed on the part of Spain. Their
negotiations have made hopeful pro
gress, so that I trust soon to be able
to lay a definite treaty of peace before
the Senate, with a review of the steps
leading to its signature.
I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment or the nature of the new pos
sessions which will come to us as th 6
result of the war with Spain. Such dis
—Uß rirtnwr** rn the
meantime and until the congress has
legislated otherwise, it will be my duty
to continue the military governments
which have existed since our occupa
tion and give to the people security in
life and property and encouragement
under a just and beneficent rule.
As soon as we are in possession of
Cnba and haye pacified the island it
will be necessary to give aid and direc
tion to its people to form a government
for themselves. This should be under
taken at the earliest moment consistent
with safety and assured success. It is
' » important that our relations with this
people should be of the most friendly
character and our commercial relations
close and reciprocal. It should be our
duty to assist in every proper way to
baild up the waste places of the island,
encourage the industry of the people
and assist them to form a government
which shall be free end independent,
thns realizing the best aspirations of
the Cuban people.
Spanish rule must be replaced by a
just, benevolent and humane govern
ment, created by the people of Cuba,
capable of performing all international
obligations and which shall encourage
thrift, industry and prosperity and pro
mote peace and good will among all the
inhabitants, whatever may have been
their relations in the past. Neither re
venge nor passion should have a place
in the new government. Until there is
complete tranquillity in the island and
a stable government inaugurated, mili
tary occupation will continue.
With the one exception of the rupture
with Spain, the intercourse of the Unit
ed States with the great family of na
tions has been marked with cordiality,
and the close of the eventful year finds
most of the issues that necessarily arise
in the complex relations of sovereign
States adjusted or presenting no serious
obstacle to a just and honorable solu
tion by amicable agreement.
Great Britain's Friendship.
Our relations with Great Britain have
continued on the most friendly footing.
Assenting to our request, the protection
of Americans and their interest in
Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by
the diplomatic and consular representa
tives of Great Britain, who fulfilled
their delicate and arduous trust with
tact and zeal, eliciting high commenda
tion. I may be allowed to make fitting
allusion to the instance of Mr. Rams
den, her majesty's consul at Santiago de
Cuba, whose untimely death after dis
tinguished service and untiring effort
during the siege of that city was sin
cerely lamented.
In the early part of April last, pursu
ant to a request made at the instance of
the Secretary of State by the British
ambassador at this capital, the Canadian
government granted facilities for the
passage of four United States revenue
cutters from the great lakes to the At
lantic coast by way of the Canadian ca
nals and the St. Lawrence river The
vessels had reached Lake Ontario and
were there awaiting the opening of nav
igation when war was declared between
tne United States and Spain. Her maj
esty's government thereupon, by a com
munication of the latter part of April,
stated that tbe permission granted be
fore the outbreak of hostilities would
not be withdrawn, provided the United
States government gave assurance that
the vessels in question would proceed
direct to a United States port without
engaging in any hostile operation. This
government promptly agreed to the
stipulated condition, it being under
stood that the vessels would not be pro
hibited fiom resisting any hostile at
tack-
It will give me especial satisfaction if
I shall be authorized to communicate to
you a favorable conclusion of the pend
ing negotiations with Great Britian in
respect to the dominion of Canada. It
is tne earnest wish of the government
to remove all sources of discord and ir
ritation in our relations with the neigh
boring dominion. The trade between
the two countries is constantly increas
ing, and it is important to both conn
tries that all reasonable facilities should
be granted for its development.
Our Relations With China.
The United States has not been an
indifferent spectator of the extraordi
jiary events transpiring in the Chinese
empire, whereby portions of its man- j
time provinces are passing under the
control of various European power
but the prospect that the vast com
merce which the energy of our citizens
and the necessity of our staple produc
tions for Chinese uses has built up in
those regions, may not be prejudiced
through anv exclusive treatmeut by the |
new oecupanvj has obviated the need of
our country becoming an actor in the
scene.
Our position among nations, having a
large Pacific coast and a constantly ex- j
panding direct trade with the farther
orient, gives us the equitable claim to ,
consideration and friendly treatment in
this regard, and it will be my aim to j
subserve our large interest in that j
quarter by all means appiopriate to the i
constant pfllicy of our government. The j
territories of Kiao Chow. of Wei-Hai-|
Wei, and of Port Arthur and Talien-1
wan leased to Germany, Great Britain j
and Russia respectively for terms of
years, will, it is announced, l»e open to .
international commerce during such j
alien occupation, and if no discriminat
ing treatment of American citizens and
their trade be found to exist, or be here
after develoi>ed, the desire of this gov
ernment would appear to be realized.
In this relation, as showing the volume
and value of our exchanges with China
and the peculiarly favorable conditions
which exist for their expansion in the
normal course of trade, I refer to the
communication addressed to the speaker
of the House of Representatives by the
secretary of the treasury on the 14th ot
last Jnne, with its accompanying letter
of the secretary of state, recommending
an appropriation for a commission to
study the commercial and industrial
conditions in the Chinese empire and
report as to the opportunities for and
obstacles to the enlargement of markets
in China for the raw products and man
ufaclures of the United States. Action
was not taken thereon during the late
session. I cordially urge that the re
commendation receive at your hands
the consideration which its importance
and timeliness merit.
Meanwhile, there may be just ground
for disquietude in view of the unrest
and revival of the old sentiment of op
position and prejudice to alien people
which prevades certain of the Chinese
provinces. As in the case of the attacks
upon our citizens in Szechuan and at
Kutien. in 1895, the United States min
ister has been instructed to secure the
fullest measure of protection, both local
and imperial, for any menaced Ameri
can interest, and to demand, in case of
lawless injury to person or property, in
stant reparation appropriate to the case.
Warships have been stationed at Tient
sin for more ready observation of the
disorders which have invaded even the
Chinese capital, so as to be in a position
to act should need arise, while a guard
of marines has been sent to Peking to
afford the minister the same measure
of authoritative protection as the repre
sentatives of other nations have been
constrained to employ.
Government Finances.
The Secretary of the Treasury reports
that the receipts of the government
from all sources during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1898. including $64,751,
228 received from sale of Pacific rail
roads. amounted to $405,331,885, and its
expenditures to $448,308,582. _Tiiere
was collected fromcustomssl49.s7s,o6l,
and from internal revenue $170,900,641.
Our dutiable imports amounted to
1324,685,479, a decrease of $58,156,690
over the preceding year, and importa
tions free of duty amounted to $291,-
414,175, a decrease from the preceding
year of $90,524,068. Interanal revenue
receipts exceeded those of the preceding
year by $24,212,067.
The total tax collected on distilled
spirits was $92,546.999: on manufactured
tobacco, $36,230,532, and on fermented
liquors, $39,515,421. We exported mer
chandise during the year amounting to
11,231,482,330, an increase of $180,488,-
774 from the preceding year.
It is estimated upon the basis of pres
ent revenue laws that the receipts of
the government for the year ending
June 30, 1899, will be $577,874,647. and
its expenditures $6*9,874.647. resulting
in a deficiency of $112,000,000.
On the Ist of December, 1898, there
was held in the treasury gold coin
amounting to $138,441,547, gold bullion
amounting to $138,502,545, silver bullion
amounting to $93,359,250, and other
forms of money amount to $451,963,981.
On the same date the amount of
money of all kinds in cirfplption- TJOI
|1,886,879,504, an increase for the year
of $165,794,966. Estimating our popu
lation at 75.194,000 at the time mention
ed, the per capita circulation was
$25.09. On the same date there was in
the treasury gold bullion amounting
to $138,502,545.
Currency Legislation Needed.
In my iudgment the present condition
of the treasury amply justifies the im
mediate enactment of the legislation
recommended one year ago, under
which a portion of the gold holdings
should be placed in a trust fund from
which greenbacks would be redeemed
upon presentation, but when once re
deemed should not thereafter be paid
out except for gold.
It is not to be inferred that other leg
islation relating to our currency is not
1 required; on the contrary there is ob
vious demand for it. The importance
of adequate provision which will insure
to onr future a money standard related
as onr money standard now is to that of
our commercial rivals, is generally
recognized.
The companion proposition that our
domestic paper currency shall be kept
safe and yet be so related to the needs
of our industries and internal commerce
as to be adequate and responsive to such
needs is a proposition scarcely less im-
Dortant. The subject, ir.all its parts, is
commended to the wise consideration of
Congress.
Tbe Message also refers to the Lattimer
riots in this state; the Nicarauga Canal,
the trouble between Great Britain and
Venezuela; the exemption of private
property from capture in war times,
the proposed strengthening of the army
and navy and many minor subjects.
WITH the death of John W. Keely,
one of the most curious delusions of the
nineteenth century passes away. Over
thirty years ago Keely announced that
he had discovered a mysterious power
of immense capabilities of industrial
application, and eyer since that time he
has been more or less in the public eye.
For a generation scientific men have
laughed at the news of the wonders of
Keely's discoveries, but Keely died be
fore he had eyer given a satisfactory de
monstration that his ideas could be suc
cessfully adapted to commercial use.
One part of Kelly's invention was cer
tainly practicable. He understood
thoroughly the art of getting money
upon schemes which would have turned
the head of that early adventurer. John
Law, in his Mississippi Schemes. The
capitalization of the Keely Company
was $5,000,000, and, so far as his counsel
knows, no statement has been left by
Keely that discloses the secret of his
motor, and the only legacy of the corp
oration may be the mechanical appar
atus in the Keely workshop, minus the
secret by which it might be operated.
Scientific American.

one person and the other for another
person, a vote will be taken in joint
convention, and the majority of the
two branches voting together will de
termine the election.
Letter From l amp Haskell.
The following is the major part of a
letter received by a Butler friend of the
writer:
CAMP HASKELL. I
ATHKNS, G.V, Dec. 2. 1898. *
I have been wanting to write to you
ever since we came down here, but
somehow have always been putting it
off. _
We are very comfortably fixed now.
there are six of us in a mess. We have
three A wall tents connected, yon
know, and have a wood stove in the
middle one which keeps them nice and
warm. ~ , . ,
As you have probablj heard we have
had quite a number of changes among
the noncoms. Seargt Moore is now
tirst Sergt John Martin is commissary
sergt, and the other day Hardie Hepler
was also appointed a sergeant and to
night the Captain announced the ap
pointment of Chas. McElvain as a ser
vant. The Corporals are Frank Pierce,
W Collins. Heineman. McKee, Hazlett.
Morgan, John Jackson, Christie. Krug.
Harriugton, McClung and Fen ton
Harrington is now regimental clerk
and Will Ritter assistant. So you see
there have been quite a few changes
since you left
They are kind of pntting the screws
on us how since they got us down here.
Guard duty is getting to be very strict,
vesterday a fellew was put in the
guard house for uot knowing the gen
eral orders. We are not allowed to
leave the camp without a written pass
and we also have a check roll call at
taps to see whether we are all in our
tents or not, an order was also issued
yesterday requesting everybody to give
up their pistols and revolvers to the
regimental ordinance officer, but I
hayn't seen anybody give theirs up yet.
There are only five of them in our mess
and I think they will stay there too
Another order prohibits the use of pro
fane or vulgar language. This I think
will also be pretty hard to enforce.
We were all vaccinated yesterday
morning and 1 think there will be some
sore arms here in a few days. The reg
iment now has a cracker jack football
team They played the University of
Georgia team on the college ground
here yesterday and our fellows trim
med them 14 to 0. Reynolds was the
only fellow out of our company who
played in the team, they were mostly
Co. F. fellows from Grove City, they
play the 3rd New Jersey team in a
fe\v days and they will show those fel
lows up too. There is very little sick
ness in the Regiment now. This seems
to be a very healthy place and we all
like it better than anywhere that we
have been yet. .
Orders were issued last week ordering
the 15th to proceed to Cuba at once, we
were to be there according to them by
Dec. Ist but they must have been re
voked, as we are still here and I don t
think, now that Spain has accepted our
terms, that we wi'.l ever go to Cuba.
The whole regiment was out in the
field this morning pulling out cotton
stalks so as to get a drill gronnd ready,
this is another indication that we won t
leave here for a while yet.
They are also going to drill us three
and a half hours a day from now on.
Dave Ensminger returned to camp on
last Mondav eight days before his fur
lough expired. He thought we were
going right to Cuba, that is why he
came back so soon. A Quarter Master
of the '2o2nd New York Regt. which is
here in our Brigade yesterday shot and
killed another soldier. He is to be
taken to a military prison in Flordia to
be tried; he will likely be shot.
We have been hoping now that more
troops are to be mustered out that we
would be among the lucky ones but
Capt. McJunkin this morning said that
we were to be retained. Where he gets
his information from I do not know, but
we hope it will turn out that he is
wrong.
We have had bean soup for dinner
now fourteen days out of fifteen, don t
you think that's pretty good. We had
■ turkey for dinner on Thanksgiving *
* * * it was bought out of the com
pany fnnds. * * * *
We had rabbit for supper tonight,
Vance Stroup has a shot gun and he
goes out and gets game occassional ly
which we cook up in fine style. Do
you ever see Sam Scott, I have heard
from him but once since he left us. I
hope you are well again 'I saw by last
weeks paper that you had another at
"J-univUt- yss 1
John Alexander before this. * * * *
Well I guess this is all for this time
Dave sends his regards to yourself and
sisters and the other fellows all want to
be remembered to yon, write again soon
Sincerely Your Friend
PTESIDENT MCKINLEY dodges a
question or two in his message, but its
whole import is that we will, (for the
present at least) hold on to all we have
ANDREW CARNEGIE has bought a
large lot on upper Fifth Ave., New
York, for $500,000 and intends to put a
$1,000,000 home on it. Real estate
prices are booming in that neighbor
hood now.
A Remarkable Case.
(Clarion Republican.)
An auditors report filed in the Or
phans Court of this county on Monday
last, has with its whole proceedings a
decided history and involves a question
never before met with in Clarion
county, and but ver> few instances of
the kind in the State of Pennsylvania.
Thomas Brizzle well known to some of
our readers, lived in Highland town
ship, this county, alone and with no
one about him. He died in that town
ship on the 22d day of March 1896,
without a will and letters of adminis
tration on his estate were granted to
James M. Owens of Clarion township
who settled up the estate and filed his
account to August term 1898. The
account was refered to Hon. J. A. F.
Hoy for distribution. At the hearing
it was developed that Brizzle was the
illegitimate son of Nancy Blair and
that he died "intestate, unmarried and
without issue." his mother never was
married and died, prior to him leav
ing no issue but him. His grand
mother also was dead. No person was
left to inherit his estate. Numerous
cousins presented their claims, but
they could not b«j allowed —being illegi
mate. never having been married and
his mother also never having been mar
ried and having died before he died.
He left no heirs and his estate of prob
ably $2,000 in value escheats to the
State, the informer getting one-third
and the State two-thirds. This is a
case the like of which are very few.

JUDGE FINLETTER'S OPINION
It
j Attempt to D«>lav Mattors—Text o.
j the Decision Overruling the Demur-
I rem ami the Motion to Quash In tta«
Conspiracy Indictments.
i The full text of Judge Finletter's de- j
I elslon disposing of the first objections !
I to the Indictments In the famous con- ;
, spiracy case follows:
j All of the questions raised by these
I demurrers and the motion to quash
could have been as fully raised upon
motion in arrest of Judgment after a
trial upon the merits. Such, motions
serve no good purpose. They prolong
the anxieties of the innocent, and they
permit no guilty man to escape. They
do not prevent the commonwealth from
submitting other bills free of the er
rors complained about. Their only ef
fect is to postpone and delay a final
disposition of a case. While the right
of defendants to use these methods
of obstruction and delay may not be
questioned, they are regarded by the
court with disfavor. The common
wealth—the people —has a right, es
pecially in communities like this, to the
speedy determination of criminal cases,
and the speedy punishment of crim
inals. The public good requires It. and
the interests of the innocent defendant
demand it. It is necessary for the pro
tection of the individual citizen, in his
life, his person, and his property. In
considering legal questions we should
never lose sight of the point at issue.
There seems to be an idea that upon
a demurrer all possible questions can
be raised. This is a mistake. A de
murrer raises only the question: Do
the charges and facts set out in the in
dictment constitute a violation of law?
All other questions must be raised at
the trial, or upon a motion for a new
trial, or upon a motion in arrest of
Judgment, or upon an appeal to the ap
pellate court. In commonwealth vs.
Hartman Chief Justice Gibson indicates
the nature and character of such ob
jections when he says: "The counts
before us are so uncertain and bald in
circumstances as to shed scarcely a
ray of light on the charge which the
defendants were required to meet." He
does not intimate that this objection
could have been raised upon demur
rer.
LAW AS TO BANK CASHIERS.
Bills Nos. 328 and 329 may be con
sidered together. Bill No. 329 charges
that the defendant, Matthew Stanley
Quay, conspired with John S. Hopkins,
the cashier of the People's bank, "to
buy and sell stocks through the said
John S. Hopkins." Bill No. 328 charges
a conspiracy "to use money, the prop
erty of the People's bank." The acts
of assembly applicable to these indict
ments are as follows: "Cashiers of
banks engaging in other business." Act
31. March, IS6O, section 64, Pennsylvania
laws, 399: "If any cashier of any bank
of this commonwealth shall engage di
rectly or Indirectly in the purchase or
sale of stock, or in any other profession,
occupation or calling, other than that
of his duty as cashier, he shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and. being
thereof convicted, shall be sentenced
to pay a fine of not exceeding $500."
"Cashiers of banks not to engage in
any other occupation."
"Act 16. April. 1850. section 10. Penn
sylvania laws. 482: It shall not be law
ful for the cashier of any bank to en
gage in any other profession, occupa
tion. or calling, either directly or in
directly, than that of the duties ap
pertaining to the office of cashier, and
if any cashier of a bank shall, directly
or indirectly, engage in the purchase
and sale of stocks, or in any other pro
fession. occupation, or calling, other
than that of his duties of cashier, such
cashier, upon conviction thereof in any
court of criminal jurisdiction, shall be
sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding
$500; provided, that this section shall
not be construed in such manner as to
prevent any cashier from managing
his own real estate or private property
as heretofore, if such private property
be not vested in mercantile, mechanical
or manufacturing operations."
DEMURRERS ADMIT THE FACTS.
The demurrers admit all the facts set
forth in the indictments—that the Peo
ple's bank was a bank: that Hopkins
was its cashier; that the defendant and
Hopkins agreed together that Hopkins
ant's benefit: that they should use the
money of the bank for that purpose.
In addition to this the printed and
oral arguments of the defendant's
counsel aver "that John S. Hopkins was
the cashier of the People's bank, said
bank being a bank of discount and de
posit; that it does not appear in said
indictments that it was unlawful for
the said M. S. Quay to borrow money
from said People's bank."
It would seem to be conclusive that
these admissions and averments estab
lish that the defendant and John S.
Hopkins had conspired as charged in
the bills of Indictment, and that it
would be wiser for me to rest my de
cision upon them than to attempt to
fortify it by reason or arguments. But
a due regard for the rights of the de
fendants would seem to require that
I should consider the objections and ar
guments of their counsel.
It must be conceded that the acts of
1850 and make it a crime for a
cashier of any bank to directly or in
directly engage in the purchase and
sale of stock. It Is argued that these
acts apply under the decision to banks
of issue only. There is no such lim
itation in the acts themselves, which
forbid the cashier of "any bank" to do
the acts complained of, and U is suffi
cient to plead in the words of the act.
If the decisions limit the statute to
banks of issue, the question whether
or not the People's bank is a bank of
issue can be raised at the trial. It is
a question of evidence, not of pleading.
HOPKINS NOT THE CUSTODIAN.
It is undoubtedly true, as argued by
counsel, that Mr. Quay had a right to
borrow money from the People's bank,
but the conspiracy charged Is "to use
unlawfully money the property of the
People's bank for the gain, benefit and
advantage of the said Matthew S.
Quay."
It no where appears in the record or
in the demurrer or in the argument
that Mr. Hopkins had the legal custody
of the money, nor does it appear that
Mr. Quay knew or had reason to be
lieve that Hopkins had the legal cus
tody of the money. It is charged in
the Indictment that they conspired un
lawfully to use the money. Unlawfully
is the equivalent of without lawful
authority, or without the authority and
knowledge of the owner, the People's
bank. It was, therefore, a conspiracy
to appropriate the property of the bank
without its consent: and the blllcharges
a conspiracy to commit larceny, and is,
therefore, sufficient.
This, however, is also a question of
evidence for the commonwealth to es
tablish, or the defendant to explain,
and show that it was a loan from the
bank.
The bills 330 and 331 are substantially
the same, so far as the questions raised
are concerned. They would be as suf
ficient and not subject to objection if
the word "unlawfully" was stricken
out.
GUARDING PUBLIC MONET.
The acts of assembly under which
these bills are founded are as follows:
"If any officer of this commonwealth
or any city, borough or township there
of shall loan out with or without inter
est or return therefor any money or
valuable security received by him, or
which may be in his possession or un
der his control, by virtue of his office,
he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."
Act of March 31, 1860, section 62.
"If any such officer shall enter into
any such contract or agreement with
any bank, corporation or individual or
association of individuals, by which
said officer is to derive any benefit,
gain or advantage from the deposit in
such bank, corporation or individual or
association, of any money or valuable
security held by him or which may
be in his possession or under his control
by virtue of the said office, he shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor." Act of March
31, 1860, section 63.
"If any state, county, township or
municipal officer of this commonwealth,
charged with the collection, safe keep
ing', transfer or disbursement of public
money, shall convert to his own use
In any way whatever, or shall use by
any way of investment In any kind of
property or merchandise any portion
of the public money entrusted to him
for collection, safe keeping, transfer
or disbursement, or shall prove a Ue
ictoiter. or fall to pay over the same |
wh> n thereunto legally required by I
the state, county or township treasurer,
or other proper iilhcer or person author- j
ized to demand and receive the sam<\ j
every such act shall l<e deemed and ad- I
Judged to be an embezzlement of so
much of the said money as shall be
thus taken, conv rt--d, invested, used or
unaccounted for. which is hereby de- j
clared a misdemeanor: and every such
officer and every person or persons ;
whomsoever aiding or abetting or be
ing in any way accessory to said act ;
and being thereof convicted, shall be
sentenced to an imprisonment not ex
ceeding five years." Act of March 31,
IS6O, section 65.
STATE MONEY FOR PRIVATE USE.
The indictments charge that the de
fendants unlawfully and falsely did
combine and agree together by 'mali
cious means to use. and did use. to
make profit, large sums of the public
moneys of the commonwealth. The de
murrers admit all of these facts to be
true, but contend that they violate no
law.
These are three distinct violations of
the law. It is contended by the defend
ants that when the money was de
posited in the People's bank it ceased to
be public money, and therefore there
could be no conspiracy to use public
money. If it be conceded that it ceased
to be public money it is not apparent
how this can make the indictment de
tective, or make the acts of the defend
ants lawful which before were unlaw
ful and a criminal conspiracy.
A conspiracy to steal or appropriate
or to use for private gain the public
money is fruitless so long as It is in
the treasury, or so long as it Is under
the control of the treasurer. Its re
moval from the treasury and control of
the treasurer is necessary for the suc
cess of the conspiracy. The deposit
ing of the money in a bank as a de
posit may be the crowning act of the
conspiracy, which makes it successful.
It may be the means by which the
crime was committed, the means by
which the public money was used for
private gain, and for purposes not
authorized by law.
It is true that as between bank and
depositor the property in money de
posited passes the bank, and from de
positor upon deposits made, but as re
spects parties to a criminal conspiracy,
who use the lawful transaction of a de
posit as a means to crime, their crim
inal intent will follow the money de
posited and their fraud taint an other
wise lawful act. Besides, the conspira
cy may be complete while the money is
In the treasury, and its transfer by
deposit can then have no effect to legal
ize the conspiracy.
It surely will not be seriously con
tended that if the treasurer conspires
with others to convert to their own
use the public money for private gain,
and they employ every means to do so.
and that every element of a conspiracy
is complete up to the time of deposit
in a bank, that the deposit annihilates
the conspiracy and makes the unlawful
acts lawful and prevents the punish
ment of a completed successful con
spiracy.
Bill 331 charges a conspiracy with the
various treasurers since 1888. It, how
ever, also charges a conspiracy with
Treasurer Haywood, and is, therefore,
good as against him and the other de
fendants. So far as the other treas
urers are concerned, it is a matter of
evidence. The court has no authority
to declare upon a demurrer that a
charge Is impossible, as argued by de
fendants' counsel. It might very well
be that a conspiracy was entered into
In 1888 to continuously use the pubic
money, which was completed in 1898.
It is aigued that the means by which
the conspiracy was committed must be
pleaded. Not so, however, in indict
ments charging an unexpected conspir
acy as in one of the counts here: for
the conspiracy may have gone no far
ther than »he mere combination. And
not so in executed conspiracies, where
the unlawful act complained of is in
the end accomplished by the confed
erates and the unlawfulness of the
means is not questioned.
Where the acts complained of are the
unlawful object of the conspiracy, and
have been accomplished, it is sufficient
to plead them as accomplished.
HAYWOOD BILL SUSTAINED.
A motion to quash bill No. 332 has
been made, but it has not been serious
ly argued, and no substantial reason
The bill meets all the requirements
laid down by Judge Bregy, and It is
In accordance with the practice of this
court from time immemorial.
Judge Allison simply announced what
was the practice and law and what
they had always been when he said:
"The returns in the case of Morton et
al. charge conspiracy and state the
overt acts committed in pursuance of
the conspiracy; these overt acts are
in themselves crimes for which one
may be indicted, such'as embezzlement,
fraudulently making and uttering writ
ten instruments, etc. In a bill charging
conspiracy alone these might have been
set out in separate counts as the overt
acts of the defendants in the execution
of a conspiracy, and if they could be
pleaded in that form they may be
separately made the subject of distinct
bills of indictment."
The motion to quash is denied. The
demurrers are overruled, with leave to
plead.
THE House of Representative has
passed the bill to suppress ticket
scalping.
ON* Thursday Judge Finletter of
Phil'a sustained the conspiracy indict
ments against Senator yuay, his son
Richard, and ex-Treas. B. J. Haywood,
and fixed Monday Dec. 13, as the date
for the trial to begin. The defendants
were not present, but their counsel en
tered pleas of not guilty.
