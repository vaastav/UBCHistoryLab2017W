Mr Taft declared that the men who didthe
the hooting on the occasion of the Brownsville
yule raid were guilty of murder In the firsdegree
degree and that their comrades who wennot
I not actually In complicity with them engaged
gaged in conspiracy to shield those whiL
were guilty Ho says also that it In impossible

possible that many of the battalion whcdid
did not actually take part in the conapiracto
to murder were not aware through oniI

tj Further along In his report SecretaryTaft
Taft presents a hypothetical case of treasonI
I lie asks that if during a time of war withI
I iMexIco a dozen men of a battalion staI
I tloned at Port Brown carried plans andi
i ammunition to the enemy on the other sideof
of the Rio Grande and returned under circunutnnees
cunutnnees showing clearly that a number
I of the men in the battalion knew the guiltyparties
parties but would nut tell would a compotent
potent General hesitate for a moment todisband
disband the entire battalion and dischargeit
it from the service In order to prevent arepetitlbn
repetitlbn of the offence Can a real andjogical
jogical distinction bo made Secretarylaft
laft inquires between the crime of treasonunder
under the circumstances supposed and thef
f crime of murder in this case Both areI
I capital offences one perhaps more helnoiiHthan
than the other and more dangerous to theI
I Government itself but In both ases it ceinsoar
cl ar to me that the Government inuntI
I protect itself and the community to whicha
a itJ > respontlble from a recuurence of uthi
i offences not by punishing guilty and InnoCent
K cent alike but by separating both theguilty
guilty and innocent from the service so ilKj
I Jo deprive the guilty of a second opporf
f > unity for such a crime even though thiatnay
tnay result in Inconvenience and perhapsbardrhlp
0 hardship to tho InnocentSecretary
Secretary Taft declares that the suggestion
tion made in some quarters that the actionbad
bad been taken because the men in it wereblack
black hardly merits notice He says thatbe
be only way the matter of color entersj

I In speaking of the penalty Secretary
Taft says that it is a mitttake to supposehat
tht the order of dlsailmal in itself is apunishment

i guilty MA discharge would be an utterlyp
p < inadequate punlnhinont for those whoj

Belule of the great criticism the orderof
of dismissal tins brought forth Seeretary
tary Taft says that I is not improper therefore
fore in this report to review the case andstate
state the reason which not only JustlfleIt <
It Uhfe brder but made It necessaryHe
He then continuesFirst
First Out of a battalion of 170 enlisteemen
men in tIme nnny of the United Statesfrom
from mime to twenty men formed a oreconcerted
concerted plan to revenge themselveiupon
upon the people of a town in which theywere
were stationed for the insults they foil
that the townspeople hiul heaped upon themIn
In accordance with the plan they left theiibarracks
barracks under cover of the darknewsabout
about mnidniglmt and proceeded to discharge
charge their weapons into the houses ofthe
the town for the purpose of killing thosiI
I against whom thev felt 1 grievance TheI
I came very near killing some one or monof
of the three women and seven chlldrciwho
who were sitting or sleeping in two of thilighted
lighted rooms into which they fired TheyIn
In fact did kill one man wound anotherand
and seriously injured the chief of policeThey
They accompanied their firing with expreaslona
preaslona indicating the malice whlclprompted
prompted their action There can be ncdoubt
doubt therefore that the squoti of merwho
who moved together from the fort to thetown
town and did this shooting were guiltof
of murder and murder In the first degreeI
and that Ii they were discovered they culdproprly
I properly be subjected to capital punishmont
mont The purpose of one was the purposof
of allSecondly
Secondly Within ten minutes or morafter
after this crime was committed whetthe
the whole garrison was aroused by thenoise
noise of the fusillade and louse call t
arm which followed it the guilty meireturned
returned to their places and must Imvibeen
been among the last men to take theliplaces
places for the reason that the firing continued
r tinued after the formations had begunThe
The absence of the rifles from the rackicould
could not have escaped tho attention ofthe
the sergeants who bad the keys of theracks
racks if Indeed they had the keys amthe
yet all the sergeants swear the rifles were Inthe
the racks untouched Before the nexmorning
morning all the guns were clean I isimpossible
Impossible that many of the battalioiwho
who did not take part D active memberof
of the conspiracy to murder were notmade
made aware by one circumstance or anotheof
of the identity of the persons who cominitted
initted this heinous offenceThirdly
Thirdly Instead of giving to theiofficers
officers or to the military inspectors whiwerediiected
werediiected to make the examination thebenefit
benefit of anything they knew tending
to lead to a conviction of the guilty personsthere
there was a conspiracy of silence on thepart
part of the men who must have knownsomething
something of importance 11 this regardThus
Thus the murderers were taken back intothe
the battalion and protected entirely frompunishment
punishmentIt
I may be that in the battalion area number
her of men wholly innocent who knowneither
neither who the guilty men are nor anycircumstance
circumstance which will aid in their detection
tection though this can not be true olmany
many Because there may bo innocentmen
men in the battalion must the Governmentcontinue
continue to use it to guard communitiestains
of men women and chlllrll when It cntas
tains so dangerous aif element Impossible
of detection Certainly not When a manenlists
enlists in the army he knows that for thevery
very purpose of protecting itself theGovernment
Government reserves the absolute rightof
of discharge not as a punishment but forthe
the public safety or interest In such I
case as this the inconvenience and hardshipedge
to thoB innocent of participation or knowfdge
edge arising from arbitrarily terminatingthe
the contract or enlistment in accordancewith
with the right which the Government bystatute
statute reserves must be borne by themin
in the public interest It goes withoutsaying
saying that if the guilty could be ascertained
tamed they should and would be punishedbut
but the guilty can not be ascertained andthe
the very impossibility of determining whoare
are guilty makes the whole battalionuseleitH
useless to the Government D an instrument
ment for maintaining law ntul order Thoonly
only means of ridding the military serviceof
of a bund of woildbo murderers of womenand

PRESIttEXT ASKS AVTHORITVOn
On Ills own initiative to Dismiss NavaOfficer
Officer for Gross MisconductWASHINGTON
WASHINGTON Dec 5President Rooseveil >
veil sent a message to Congress todaasking
asking that authority be given to tho President
dent to dismiss an officer of the Navy Thmessage <
message followsTo
To the Senate and house of Representtittt
tittt
I feel it my duty to call your attentionto
to the fact that under the provision ofArticles
Articles 36 and 37 of the articles for thegovernment
government of the Navy the President hoino
no longer the authority to dismiss an officeiof
of the Navy in time of peace unless in pursuance
suance of n sentence of a general cur
martial and even in time of war his rightof
of dismissal is practically subject to reviewby
by a courtmartial to b assembled withlrsix
six months I the accused officer demandithis
this court The articles in question are itthe
the terms followingArticle
Article 3 No officer shall be diemlso
missed from the naval service except by theorder
order of the President or by sentence of ageneral
general courtmartial and In the time oipeace
peace no officer shall b dismissed exceptIn
In pursuance of tlm sentence of a generalcourtmartial
courtmartial or in mitigation thereofArticle
Article 37 When any officer dismissedby
by order of the President since March 3isei
isei makes in writing an application fortrial
trial setting forth under oath that he banbeen
been wrongfully dismissed the Presidentshall
shall as soon as the necessities of the servicetnay
tnay permit convene a courtmartial trysuch
such officer on tho charges on which he shallhave
have been dismissed And If such courtmartial
martial shall not b convened within six1months
months from the presentation such application
cation for trialor if such court being convened
vened shall not award dismissal or deathas
as the punishment of such officer the orderof
of dismissal by tho President shall lie voidThis
o This condition of the law was calledto
to my attention by a recent painful andhumiliating
humiliating incident On May 0 19
an oflcer of the navy won accused of behavior
havior HO indecent and disgusting as toshow
show clearly his unfitness if guilty ascharged
charged to hold a commission or associatewith
with officers and gentlemenThe
The nature of the alleged misconductand
and the lack of compulsory power in navalcourts
courts to enforce the attendance of civilianwitnesses
witnesses D well as the locality wherethe
the offence was said to have been committedcaused
caused l long and very unfortunate although
though quite unavoidable delay in histrial
trial by courtmartial which did not occuruntil
until Jan IS 1006 He was then convictedbut
but the court while imposing a severepenalty
penalty to my surprise as well a thatof
of the Navy Department did not sentencethe
the offender to dismissal from the serviceThe
The failure of the court to rid the navyby
of ono 8 clearly unfit to form a part or Itwal
was commented upon In appropriate tprllby
by the department but it was then and hal
been since a source of profound regret tome
me that the law as above set forth madeit
it impracticable for me t afford a remedyfor
for this failure Moreover it Is to Iro remembered
membered that owing to the Inability ofruxvcl
naval courts as above explained to compel
pel the attendance of civilian witnessesand
and the further fact that they have noauthority
authority to receive as evidence the depositions
sitions of absent witnesses while the exigencies
igencies of the service may often cause officers
oems and men cognizant of tho facts to beemployed
employe in distant places at the time ofthe
the trial there is great danger lest offencesof
of the nature charged against this roanshould
should go altogether unpunishedIn
In this case it was found very difficultto
to overcome the natural reluctance ofsome
some of the witnesses t attend and testifyhave
I am convinced that the President Ihouldhave
have the authority upon his own initiativeand
and responsibility to dismiss any officerwhom
whom he thinks unworthy to remain inthe
the serviceI
servceI
I think there is no danger thatthis
this power would b abused and I
such danger exists at all It is 8 slightas
as to bo altogether outweighed by theconsiderations
considerations of public policy which re
quire this authority to be vested in thoconstitutional
constitutional commanderlnchief of theNnvy
Navy I therefore strongly recommendthat
that article 36 n hereinbefore given beimendod
amended by omitting all of It after thewords
words general courtmartial where thosewords
words first occur therein and that ArticleIT
37 bo repealed
