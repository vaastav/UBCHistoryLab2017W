Washington, Dec. 5".—A federal
budget for the. fiscal y.ear 1921! ap
proximately $500,000,000 below the
$4,000,000,000 figure, which had
been estimated sometime ago as the
mrniuni of government expendi
tures for several years to come, faced
Congress when it reconvened today.
The'exact figures as prepared by
the newly created budget bureau and
transmitted by President Harding in
a special message were 505,745,
727, including an estimated deficit
of $21,509,660 in the operations of
the postal service.
The largest single item in the bud
get rs found for the interest on the
public debt, the $975,000,000 provid
ed lacking only $25,000,000 of the
total expenses of the federal estab
lishment befo.re the world war. In
addition there is an estimate of $369
238,S00 for the war debt sinking
fund.
The federal budget lor the fiscal
year 1923—the first to be complied
shows estimated expenditures of $3,
505,754,727, a decrease of $462,107,
639 as compared to the estimated
outgo for the fiscal year 1U22 end
ing next June 30, and a reduction of
$2,0.32,285.902 from the actual out
lay in the fiscal year 1921.
Estimated receipts for 1923 are
placed at $3,33S,182,750, leaving an
apparent deficit of $167,571,977. In
transmitting the budget to Congress
today, President Harding says,"ways
are provided for the relatively easy
adjustment" of the discrepancy be
tween income and outgo "without
added taxation." As one means he re
commends legislation directing the
reduction of the naval supply account
by $100,000,000.
Actual appropriations asked of
Congress for the various federal de
partments and agencies for- 1923
total $3,224,S75,592 exclusive of
Postofiico Department. This repres
ents a reduction of $122,806,310
from the original estimated as pre
sented tp the budgft burpa^, it is
stilted, but is apgroxHnateljr $27,000
000 more than tile appropriation for
this fiscal year.
Explaining, thp $280,S79,134 ex
cess Of estimated expenditures in
1 923 over the appropriations asked.
for Budget Bureau officials explain
that some of the funds actually to
be put out will be carried over in
continuing appropriations and by
other means. They say that appro
priations for a given year do not ac
curately reflect actual expenses for
the year, pointing cout that whrle
the appropriations for the fiscal year
were $3,197,807,962 the estimated
actual out go will exceed tlie sum
by approximately $770,000,000..
Of the total estimated expenditur
es for 1923, approximately $2,900,
000.000 is to pay for past wars and
keep up the fighting arms of the
government, leaving only about
$600,000,000 for the peace-time
pursuits of the federal establish
ment. The estimate for the army
and navy rs $801,636,107, a reduc
tion of $66,305,299 as compared
with this fiscal year and $956,35.2,
741 as compared with the fiscal year
1921.
The navy estimate of $431,754,000
it is explained does not take into
account any possible reductions that
mighty be brought about as a result
of the arms conference, the total in
cluding funds for continuing work
on the ships of the 1916 program,
most of which would be scrapped
under the proposal made to the con
ference by the American government.
Accompanying the budget as sent
to Congress is a detailed report frota
Director General Dawes as to the po
eration of the budget bureau since
its establishment tfive months ago and
some pointed comments as to means
of continuing its efficient operation.
Discussing the reception, of the bud
get by Congress, General Dawes
says:
"It is to be expected that since
the prelimine^y. estimated have been
made under pressure by. the execu
tive for proper retrenchment where
consistent with efficiency, it will not
be necessary, as heretofore, fpr:
Congress to make radical cuts, upon:
the estimates .of the budget with any
uncertainty as to what will be the
result as it effects effciency. The
President of the United States, when
he sends the budget to'Congress is
presumed to send it with all. the re
ductions in expenditures which can
be effected without due impairment
of govermental. business processes.
In the preparation of the budget hfe
has had at work an authorized a
gency in the burfeau riot only in as-'
certaining the reasonableness of de-i
sired* appropriations, but. in contin
ually imposing pressure upon the de
partment for a reduction the est
imates wherever proper and pos
sible..", ..

General Dawes says be iepls that,
the estimate for expenditures, for
1.92-3 upon which the budget is .based
''willtup.t be.increased except through

Report of Federal Budget Bureau Submitted to Con­
gress Today by President Harding Shows Estimated Ex­
penditures tff About Three and One-fiafi Billion—Re-
guction of Nearly Five Hundred Million on Estimated
Outgo For 1922—Over Twb BilKoi Cut Froiti 1921—
Largest Item Interest on National Debt
for either the executive, Congress
or the Secretary of the.. Treasury to
have before them a true pictifr® of
the fiscal. condition of the govern
ment at any particular time."
"The whole habit of making con
tinuous appropriations to which the
I government has been committed in
the past," he add£, "is only an en
couragement to a lack oT scrutiny of
i public workB by the head of the de
I partme'n't- under which it is carried
on, and ah encouragement to shift
I k.ssness and carelessness, on the part
of the subordinates more directly
concerned witli it. This system of
preparing the budget will confine the
attention of tlie Executive, of Con
gress and of the public to the one
great important question, to wit:
the relation of money actually spent
by the Government to the moiiey act
ually to be received by the Go'vern
nient in any given year, all its out
standing obligations, and indefinite
commitments, projects, and enter
prises considered. This will enable
Congress, with more intelligence, to
determine at any time both the neces
sity for retrenchment and the ability
of the Government to. engage in ad
ditional projects to be initiated by
Congress outside of the budgetary
provisions."
Likening the federal government
to a business Corporation, General
Dawes points to these "faults" which
he says existed:
The president of the corporation
(the president of the United States)
gave practically "no attention to its
ordiiijiry routine business.
The administrative vice-presidents'
(members of the cabinet) were allow
ed to run their several departments
as if each separate department was
an independent authority in all mat
ters of routine business.
because of a lack of any outlined
business plan, no system existed for1
uiaking purchases or in selling ma
terial along business lines under a
unified policy.
1
,*
No balance sheet of the corpora
tion as a whole was ever prep'ared.
The treasurer kept no accurate a
count of the contingent obligations of
the various federal departments,
thus resulting in money being drawn
from him continuously in excess oi'
the estiniated annual running ex
penses.
The corporation, in effect, seldom!
reconsidered an unwise project enter
ed into by any department.
The administrative heads of tlie:
departments w^re selected as a rule
with little reference to their business:
qualifications and were compelled to!
rely largely upon the advice of sub
ordinates "wedjded to the theory of:
the right.of indiependent operation of
the department."
i
Outlining the work of the various
co-ordinating agencies established by
presidential order "to rectify faults
i nthe routine business of the govern
ment," General Dawes says:
"They involve *no transfer of au
thority the location of which has
been fixed otherwise by statute.
"They involve the delegation ofj
no questions of policy save that of|
economy and Efficiency.
"They are created simply to give
the president of the United States,
the same agencies .of contract andi
transmission of authority as obtain
in aiiy private organization.
"Tliey are non-partisan, being com
posed of men already in the govern-:
ment service.
"They are in effect simply a re
grouping under an executive leader-,
ship of certain of the preseift em
ployees of government of such ex-'
perience. contact, and relation in its:
routine business as enables them to1
make possible the application offonir.
mon-sense business methods.
"It cannot be too often reiterated
that this most, important reformation
in the governmental business system
is dependent upon the president of
the United States himself, arid upon
his continued assumption of his re
sponsibility as its business head. Tii-3
minute Jb§, relaxes his attitude of at
teBtjpii to^thia duty there v ili be felt
-the naturaljPi»ll of tlie department*
and estajjli^hni^n Is toward he eld
system of comitate independence arid.

General Dawes concluded his re-j
port with this HtaWtriferit:
"In making thifi repoft the ^llrectori

tion
Eedacing Expens­
es—Attacks Tax Law's.
December 3,*1921—To be or not
to be to live or not to live That is
the question. A new broom sweeps
clean. The new administration starts
with a promise of reducing expenses,
looking after the odds and ends and
frying to avoid and Undo the mistak
es of its predecessors. Those mis
takes were mainly the result pf num
erous bad. laws- passed at the legisla
five session, of J9.19.. The..greatest
wrong lias resulted from booming tlie
assessriients and tax levies so as to
confiscate the rental value of proper
ty. Certain it is that during, tlie
past years farm ,aud city property lias
fiot piid a net sum of two percent on
itis aiiseSsed valuatipn, while railroads
"iiii'd other properties are making and
Jjave a guarantee of six per cent or
jriore. And Svliat is good,-., for the

n e
Under the constitution there can be
i\o levy, of a state tax unless rt is
based oh an Assessed,,valuation, and
tiiq. total state tax must not exceed
tour mills on tlfe dbllar in a year. To
ievade the constitution, in 1919 laws
were passed levying state taxes on
most everything:— .(1) A state tax
on automobiles, amounting to about
a million dollars a year—enough to
pay all necessary experiditures of /the
:^t'ate—atii illegal tax .has been
largely squandered. (2) For the ac
cidental iripu.raiice. Of wage eiarners
there lias, been leviied a..state..tax on
$Kjr iridustrie? amounting to. five
times tlie stiiii necessary.rfor irisur
arice, (3) A state tax of $15. a year
on poor lawyers, to be squandered
by an appointive Bar Board. (4) A
state tax on incomes. (5) A state
'tkx on pool and billiard taibles.
thieatres arid such like, to be com
pletely squandered by a License
Boar4 under the Attprney General.
(6.) Other faxes so that in 1920 tlie
state, tto, amounted to nearly thirt
een million, as per items given in for
mer. lettrs to State Board of Equal
ization ori July, 2, 1921..
7 State Industries a FaUurc
Th£i new., administratipn takes by.
inheritance or succession the State
Bank and staite enterprises, which
have thus.far proven a dismal failure
because the manner of their organ
ization is radically wrong. They are
political waifs like dogs that nobody
owns. The League folks regard and
cherish these things as a political
asset. The hew administration the
I. V. A's., must regard then! as a
political curse arid a drairi upon the
taxpayers. Certain it is that as at
present organized the state in
tries and the Bank can never be
niade ia success, because in the public
service there is no .efficiency. There
in boundless waste and extravagance.
There is no just supervision or ac
counting. In the public service most
every person becolnes a skulker and
a timestealer, which is much the
samevas a thief. He steals his time
and leaves his work undone like the
nine judges of the U. S. Supreme
Court and most all other judges and
high officials. There is no observance
of business principles, no close iac
counting and monthly balance sheets.
To make a state enterprise a suc
cess-it must be conducted by a joint'
stock company with a union of -pub
lic and private capital and control, a
daily, weekly or monthly accounting
similar to that of the Federal Reserve
Banks, At the primary election in
June the people can use the initiative,
procedure and pass laws to reorgan
ize the State Bank and the state en
terprises, to reduce the assessments
a,n dtax burdens and to repeal the bad
laws. Until then it is the part of wis
dprii for the new administration to
cut down ..expenses, issue no bonds,
preserve the state property and cUt
the coat according to the cloth. It
is mere folly to talk of testing or
trying out programs or means that
hav6-proven, and must ever prove, a
disnial failure.
