CLEVELAND LEADER COMPANY,
AV'fcuNESDAY, UECEMBEK 6, 1865.
President Johnson's First Message.
The reader of the first annual message
or President Johnson; which we print in
full tn this morning's Leader, cannot fail.
however much he may differ frfc the
lueas advanced and positions taken therein,
to recognize and acknowledge the con
spicuous ability, moderation and dignity
wbich marks it from beginning to end.
In its language, in its terse yet fluent style
ol expression, in its logical arrangement,
in iu cogent and pithy argument, it is
surpassed by few American state papers
since the days of Jefferson- j The wisdom
of tbe document, is shown not only in what
it says, but in what .it omits to say. Its
recommendations to Congress will meet the
cordial endorsement of all or nearly all
right-thinking IT nionists; while its emin
ent sagacity in remaining silent upon
other topics and leaving the national legis
lature to unembarrassed and unprejudiced
consideration of them is equally to be
commended. Its sense and moderation,
on most of the subject which it discusses,
are so eminent tfiat even those who oppose
the President will be at a loss to find any
thing at which they may cavil ; while its
dignity and temperance, combined with
iu firmness, will call forth admiration as
well a. respectful attention in the courts
of France and Great Britain.
"We shall attempt no detailed review of
the positions, arguments and recommen
dations of the message. They are presen
ted in a form as condensed as is compati
ble with clearness and accuracy in the
document iUelf, and can only be under
stood by reading it. Embracing as tbey
do all the questions arising from our pres
ent position, the momentous history of
the last twelve-month, and the complica
ted Bnd perplexing problems which the
future must solve refuting the heresy of
state sovereignty; declaring the para
mount supremacy of the Constitution and
tbe Federal Government; laying down
with unequalled clearness the great prin
ciples upon which the Union was con
structed ; passing thence to practical top
ics and explaining the causes which
influenced tho adoption of the
present reconstruction policy; discussing
the i subjects of military government
ment, negro suffrage, our duty to the
freedmen, the amnesty, the constitutional
amendment, and indirectly the trial of
Jefferson Davis; turningover to Congress,
without a word of advice, the whole ques
tion of the admission of the rebel repre
sentatives; denouncing all monopolies and
all restrictions on commerce between the
Suites; briefly presenting noteworthy acts
in regard to the operation of the executive
Departments ; grappling ably with the
manifold questions in regard to revenue,
taxation and currency which arise in con
sideration of our financial affairs ; taking
firm and decided ground in relation to our
claims upou England and our duty to en
force the Monroe Doctrine in Mexico; and
closing with a glowing panegyric upon
tbe excellence and glory of our republican
institutions' it would be a hopeless task
to discuss or even to comment upon these
diverse but most important topics in the
limits of a single editorial. ,
On only one point in the whole message
will the radical union men leel constrain
ed to differ with tho President and thiit
is upon the question of negro suffrage.
The President reaflirins his reconstruction
policy. on this subject and sustains it upon
the old argument that the regulation of
the elective franchise is left exclusively to
the States, and that to interfere with it
would be to transcend his duty. The an
swer to this argument has been urged so
often and so conclusively, that wo need
only to restate it in the briefest terms.
AUD Js '(U-3 ltpi 1U1 t-U V VA
over again with the franchise regulations
of the rebellious states. He did'so when
be provided that none but loyal men
should vote. He did so still more em
phatically when he set aside the recent
elections in North and South Carolina. If
he has the right to say: "Kane tot loyal
men sbnll vote," he has the equal right to
sav: "All loyal men shall vote.
But the President fortifies his position
with another argument, which has at Ieasl
the merit of novelty. He declares that
"concession of the elective franchise to the
freedmen, by act of tbe President of the
United States, must have been extended to
all colored men, wherever found, and so
must have established a change of suffrage
tho Northern, Middle and Western
states, not less than in the Southern and
Southwestern." It is hardly credible that
the author of so able a state paper as this
we uro considering should bave deliberate
introduced into it an argument so trans
parently illogical and baseless. It ignores
entirely the fact of the rebellion. It as
sumes-that the South has forfeited
rights or privileges,and that itstandsin pre
cisely the same relation to the Union with
the States of the North. It assumes that
the extension of the elective franchise
would be made to the negroes be
cause they are negroes, not De-
cause they are the loyal citizens of
reliellious communities. It : proves too
much. If it is accepted as true it would
overthrow tbe entire reconstruction policy
the government. If it is accepted as
true, the President has as much right to
appoint a Provisional Governor in Ohio
in South Carolina.
But while we. protest against the Presi
dent's argument on this subject, we are
to observe tbat be uses it only in jus
tification of his own policy, and in defini
tion of his own duty. He . makes no re
commendation to Congress upon the sub
ject, and evidently desires to. leave it sole
judge of what it onght to do and can do
regard to it. Meantime the message
indirectly confirms the position taken
the President, as a private individual.
favor of the gradual and qualified ad
mission of the freedmen to suffrage.
"We have said that this is the only point
upon which the most radical Union men
will find fault with tbe message, in all
other respects, in its declaration of the
national duy to the freedmen, in its as-
ertion of their inalienable rights, in its
uncompromising stand, in iavor oi tne
amendment to the eonstitu-
ion, in its hostility to slavery, and in its
Ermation " that treason is a crime, that
traitors must be punished and the oflense
nade infamous," he is fully up with the
most advanced of our anli-lavery reform
I On these points not even Charles
Sumner could not bave written more rad
ically or more forcibly. We are glad to
nd in these fucts an indication that there
to be no rupture between the President
the party, but that both will act har
moniously together in the grand . work of
making the Union, secure and Liberty

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow dtiinuqf thi. Senate . -
and House of Representatives:
To express gratitude to God, in the
name of the poople, for the preservation
of the United States, is my first duty in
addressing you. Our thoughts next revert
to the death of the late President by an
act of parricidal treason. The grief ot
the nation is still fresh; it finds some solace
in the consideration that he lived to enjoy
the highest proof of its confidence bv en
tering on the renewed term of the Chief
Magistracy, to which he bad been elected ;
that he brought the civil war substantially
to a ciose; mat nis loss was deplored in all
parts of the Union j and that foreign na
tions nave rendered justice to nis memory.
His removal cast upon me a heavier
weight of cares than ever devolved upon
any one of his predecessors. To fulfil mv
trust I need tbe support and confidence of
an wnoare associated with me in tne vari
ous departments of Government, and the
support and confidence of the people.
There is but one way in which I can hope
to gain their necessary aid ; it is, to state
witb frankness the principles which guide
my conduct, and their application to the
present state of affairs, well -aware tbat
the efficiency of my labors will, in a great
measure, depend on your and their undi-
vidod approbation.
THE CONSTITUTION.
The ' Union . of the United States
of 1 America was intended by its
authors to last as long as the
States themselves shall last. " The Union
shall be perpetual " are tbe words of the
Confederation. " To form a more perfect
Union," by an ordinance of tbe people of
tne United states, is the declared purpose
of tbe Constitution. The hand of Divine
Providence was never more plainly visi
blein theaffairsof men than in the framing
and the adopting of that instrument, ll
is, beyond comparison, tbe greatest event
in American history; and indeed is it not,
of all events in modern times, the most
pregnant with consequences for every peo
ple of the earth ? The member of the
Convention which prepared it, brought to
their work the experience of the Confed
eration, of their several States, and of
other Republican Governments, old and
new ; but they needed and they obtained
a wisdom superior to experience. And
when for its validity it required the aji
proval of a people that occupied a largo
part of a continent and acted separately
in many distinct conventions, what is more
wonderful than that, after earnest conten
tion and long discussion, all feelings and
all opinions were ultimately drawn in one
way to its support :
Tbe Constitution to which life was thus
imparted contains within itself ample re
sources fur its own preservation. It has
power to enforce the laws, punish treason.
and ensure domestic tranquility. In case
ot the usurpation of the Government of a
State by one man, or an obligarchy, it be
comes a duty of the United States to make
good the guarantee to that State of a re
publican form of government, and so
to maintain the honiogeneousness of all.
Does the lapse of time reveal defects ? A
simple mode of amendment is provided in
the Constitution itself, so that its condi
tions can always be made to conform
to the requirements of advancing
civilization. No room is allowed even for
the thought of a possibility of its coming
to an end. And these powers or self
preservation have aiwiivs been asserted in
their complete integrity by every patriotic
Chief Magistrate by Jefferson and Jack
son, not less than by Washington and
Madison. The parting advice of the
Father of his Country, while yet Presi
dent, to the people of the United States,
was, that " the tree Constitution, which
was the work of their hands, miirht be
sacredly maintained:" and the inaugural
words of President Jefferson held up " the
preservation of the General Government,
in its constitutional vigor, as the sheet an
chor of our peace at home and safety
abroad." The Constitution is the work of
" the people of the United States." and it
should be as indestructible as the people.
THE RELATION OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT
TO THE STATES.
It is not strange that the frainers of the
Constitution, which had no model in the
past, should not have fully comprehended
the excellence of their "own work. Fresh
from a struggle against arbitrary power,
many patriots suffered from harassing
fears of an absorption of the State Gov
ernments by the General Goveruuiont,and
many from a dread that the States would
break away from their orbits. But the
very greatness of our country should allay
the apprehension of encroachments by the
General Government.' The subjects that
COQie unquestionably within its jurisdic
tion are so numerous, Wat it must ever
naturally refuse to be embarrassed by
questions that lie beyond it. Were ft
otherwise, the Executive would sink be
neath tbe burden; the channels of jus
tice would De cnoKcd; legislation would
be obstructed by excess ; so that there is
greater temptation to exercise some of the
functions of the General Government
through the States than to trespass on
tneir rightful sphere. " The absolute ac
quiescence in the decisions of the mniori-
ty " was, at the beginning of the century.
enforced by Jenerson "as tlio vital prin
pie of republics, and tne events ot tbe
last four years have established, we will
hope forever, that there lies no appeal to
force.
The maintenance of the Union brings
with it "the support of the State Govern
ments in all their rights ;" but it is not one
of the rights of any State Government
to renounce its own place in the Union, or
to nullify the laws of the Union. The
largest liberty is to be maintained in the
discussion ot the acts ot tne f ederal Gov
ernment; but there is no appeal from its
laws, except to the various branches of
that: Government itself, or to the people,
who crant to the members of tbe Lecisla-
tive and of the Executive Departments no
tenure but a limited one, and in that man
ner always retain the poworsof redro-s.
"Ibe sovereignty ot the States is the
language of the Confederacy, and not the
language ot tne Constitution. J he lat'er
contains the emphatic words: "The Con
stitution, and the laws of tho United
States wbich shall be made in pursuance
thereof, and all treaties made or which
shall he made under the authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of
the land; and tne judges in every Slate
suau ue oouuu lueruoy, anyining in the
constitution or laws of any State to the
contrary notwithstanding.
Certainly the Government of tbe United
States is a limited government; and so
is every State government a limited gov
ernment, yv nn us, tnis ideaot limitation
spreads through every form of administra
tion, general, State, and municipal, and
rests en the great distinguishing principle
of the recognition of the rights of man.
The ancient rppublics absorbed the indi
vidual in the State, prescribed his religion,
and controlled his activity. The Ameri
can system rests on tbe assertion of the
eoiifil rip-ht of every man to life, lihert.v
T --3---- . , ,
and the pursuit of happiness; to freedom
conscience, to the culture and exercise
all his faculties. As a consequence, the
State Government is limited, as to tho
General Government in the Interest of
Union, as to tbe individual citizen in the
interest ol lreedom.
States, with proper limitations of pow
er, are essential to tne existence of tr.e
Constitution of the United States. At
the very commencement, when we as
sumed a place among u.a u'ers of the
earth, the Declaration of Independence
was adopted by States; so also were tb
Articles of Cor.fuderatjon ; and when "tbe
People of the United States" ordained and
established the Constitution, it was the
assent of the States, one by one, which
eave it vitality. In the event, too, ofany
amendment to the Constitution, the prop
osition of Congress needs the confirma
tion of States. ithout States, one great
branch ;of the legislative government
would be wanting. And, if we look be
yond the letter of be Constitution

jurisdiction a vast continental empire is
due to tbe system ol states, i lie best se
curity fr the perpetual existence of the
States is the "supreme authority" of the
Constitution of the United States. The
perpetuity of the Constitution brings with
the perpetuity of the States ; their mu
tual relation makes us what we are, and
our political system their connection is
indissoluble. The whole cannot exist
without the parts, nor the parts without
whole. So long as the Constitution
the United .States endures, the States
endure; the destruction of the one is
destruction of tbe other ; the preserva
of the one is the preservation of the
other.

THE EVILS OF MILITARY GOVERNMENT.
Now, military governments, established
for an indefinite period, would have offered
no security for the early suppression of
aisconieni ; would nave divided the peo
ple into the vanquishers and the van
quished; and would have envenomed
hatred, rather than have restored affection.
Once established, no precise limit to their
continuance was conceivable. They
would have occasioned an incalculable
and exbaustimr emense. Peaceful emi.
gration to and from that portion of the
country is one of the best means that ean
be thought of for the restoration of har
mony; and that emigration would have
been prevented ; for what emigrant from
anroau, wnai industrious citizen at home,
would place himself willinirly under mili
tary rule? The chief persons who would
have followed in the train of tbe army
would have been dependents on the Gen
eral Otoveriiment, or men who expected
profit from the miseries of their erring
ienow-citinens. ine powers of patronage
and rule which would have been exercised,
under the President, over a vast, and
populous, and naturally wealthy reirion.
are greater than, unless under extreme ne
cessity, I should be willing to entrust to
any one man ; they are such as, for my
self, I could never, unless on occasions of
great emergency, consent to exercise. The
willul use ot such powers, if continued
through a period of years, would have en
dangered the purity of the eeneral ad
ministration and tne liberties ot the States
which remained loyal.
STATES STILL IN THE UNION.
Besides, tbe policy of military rule over
a conquered territory would have implied
that the States whose inhabitants mar
have taken part in tbe rebellion bad. bv
the act of those inhabitants, ceased to ex
ist. But tbe true theory is. that all pre
tended acts of secession were, from the lie
ginning, null and void. The States can
not commit treason, nor screen the indi
vidual citizens who may have committed
treason, any more than thuy can make
vaua treaties or engage in lawful com
merce with any foreign power. The
States attempting to secede placed them
selves in a condition where their vitality
was impaired, but not extinguished their
functions suspended, but not destroyed.
l
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.
But if any State neelects or refuses to
perform its offices, there is the more reed
that the General Government should
maintain all its authority, and, as soon as
practicable, resume the exercise of all its
functions. On this principle I have acted,
and have gradually and quietly-, and by
almost imperceptible stops sought to re
store the rightful energy of the General
Government and of the States. To that
end, Provisional Governors have been
appointed fur the States, conventions call
ed, Governors elected, Legislatures assem
bled, and Senators and Representatives
chosen to the Congress of the United
States. At the same time, the Courts of
the United States, as far as could be done,
have been reopened, so that the laws of
the United States may be enforced through
their agency. The blockade has been re
moved and the custom-houses re-established
in ports of entry, so that the rev
enue of the United States may be collect
ed. The Post Office Department renews
its ceaseless activity, and the General
Government is thereby enabled to com
municate promptly with its officers and
agents. The courts bring security to per
sons and property ; the opening of the
ports invites the restoration of industry
and commerce ; the post office renews the
facilities of social intercourse and of busi
ness. And is it not happy for us all, that
the restoration of each one of these func
tions of the General Government brings
witb it a blessing to the States over which
tbey are extended ? Is it not a sure prom
ise of harmony and renewed attachment
to tbe Union that, after all that has hap
pened, the return of the General Govern
ment is known only as a beneficence ?

THE PARDONING POWER.
I know very well that this policy is at
tended with some risk; that for its suc
cess it requires at least the acquiescence of
tue otate wnicn it concerns ; that it iro
plies an invitation to those States, by re
newing weir allegiance to the United
States, to resume their functions as States
of the Union. But it is a risk that must
be taken ; in the choice of difficulties, it is
tbe smallest risk ; and to diminish, and, if
possible, to remove all danger, 1 have felt
incumbent on me to assert one other
power of the General Government the
power of pardon. .s no State ean throw
defence over the crime of treason, the
power of pardon is exclusively vested in
the Executive Government of tbe United
States. In exercising that power, I have
taken every precaution to connect it with
the clearest recognition of the binding
iorce of tne laws ot tne united States, and
an unqualified acknowledgment of the
great social change of condition in regard

THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
The next step which I have taken to
restore the constitutional relations of the
States, has been an invitation to them to
participate in the high office of amending
the : Constitution. Every Patriot
must wish for a general amnesty at the
earnest epoch consistent with public safe
ty. For this great end there is need of a
concurrence of all opinions, and the
spirit of mutual conciliation. All parties
the late terrible conflict must work to
gether in harmony. It is not too much to
ask, in the name of the whole people,
mat, on ine one side, tne plan ot restora

willingness to cast the disorders of
the past into oblivion ; and that, on tbe

NEGRO SUFFRAGE.
of '.he General Government
towards the four nillions of inhabitants
whom the war has tailed into freedom, have
engaged my most se'ious consideration. On
the propriety of atemptine to make the
freedmen electors y the proclamation of
-executive, i not tor my counsel the
Constitution itslf, the interpretations of
mat instrument Dyits authors and and their
contemporaries, and recent legistat on by
Congress. When, at the first movement to
wards independence, the Congress of the
United States instructed the several States
to institute governments of their own, they
leu, eacn etate to decide lor itself the condi
tions for the enjoyment of the elective fran
chise. During the period of the Confedera
cy, there continued to exist a very great di
versity in tne qualiucations ol electors in
the several States; and even within a State
a distinction of qualifications prevailed with
regard to the otbeers who were to be chosen.
t he Constitution of the United States recog
mies these diversities when it enmina that
in the choice of members of the Bouse of
Kepresentatives of tha United States, " the
electors in each Slate shall have the quali
fications requisite for electors of the most
numerous branch of the State Legislature."
jiiujr me formation ol the constitution, it re
mained, as before, the unilbrm usa?e for
eacn niaie to enlarge tne bony ol its electors,
according to its own -judgment; and, nniier.
mis sTstein, one elate alter another has pro
ceeded to increase thanniiiber of its electors
until now universal suffrage, or something
very near it, is the general rule. So uxed
was this reservation of power m the habits
of the people, and so unquestioned has been
ine interpretation ot tbe Constitution, that
aurmz the Civil war the late Frnaulant nov
er harbored the purpose certainly never
avowea tne purpose oi disregarding it; and
in ine acts oi congress, during that period,
nothing can be found which, durinz the
continuance of hostilities, much less after
their close, would have sanctioned any de
parture Dy ine executive from a jolicy
which has so uniformly obtained. More
over, a concession of the elective franchise
to the freedmen, by act of the President of
the United States, must have been extended
to all colored men, wherever found, and so
must bave estabtished a change ol suffrage
in the Northern, Middle, and Western
States, not less than in the Southern and
Southwestern. Such an act would have
created a new class of voters, and would
have been an assutnntion of nower hv the
icsiucut wuicu uouuuk in tne consitunon
or laws of the United States would have
warranted,
On the other hand, every danger of con-
uici is avoiaea wnen tne settlement ot the
question is referred to the several States.
They can, each for itself, decide on the
measure, and whether it is to bo adopted
at once and absolutely, or introduced grad
ually and with conditions. ' In my judg
ment, the freedmen, if they show patience
and manly virtues, will sooner obtain a
participation in the elective franchise
through
the States than through the Gen
eral Government, even if it had power to
intervene. When tbe tumult of emotions
tbat have been raised by the suddenness
of the social change shall have subsided, it
may prove that they will receive the kind
liest usage from some of those on whom
they have heretofore most closely depended.
WHAT MUST BE DONE FOR THE FREEDMEN.
But while I have no doubt that now.
after the close of the war, it is not compe
tent for the General Government to ex
tend the elective franchise in the several
States, it is equally clear that good faith
requires the security of the freedmen in
their liberty and their property, their right
to labor, and their right tb claim the just
return oftheir labor. I cannot too strongly
urge a dispassionate treatment of this sub
ject, which should be carefully kept aloof
irom all party strife. We must equally
avoid hasty assumptions of any natural
impossibility for the two races to liye side
by side, in a state of mutual benefit and
good will. Tile experiment involves us in
no inconsistency ; let us then, go on
and make that experiment in good fajth.and
pot be too easily disheartened. Thecountry
in need of labor, and the freedmen are
in need of employment, culture and pro
tection. While their right of voluntary
migration and expatriation is not to be
questioned, I would not advise their forced
removal and colonization. Let us rather
encourage them to honorable and useful
industry, where it may be benelloial to
themselves and to the country ; and, in
stead of hasty anticipation of the certain
ty of failure, let there be nothing wanting
the fair trial of the experiment. The
change in their condition is tbe substitu
tion of labor by contract for the status, of
slavery. Tbe freedmen cannot fairly be
accused of unwillingness to work, so long
a doubt remains about his freedom of
choice in bis pursuits, and the certainty of
his recovering bis stipulated wages. In
this the interests of the employer and tbe
employed coincide. The employer de
sires in bis workmen spirit and alacrity,
and these can be permanently secured in
other way. And if the one ought to
able to enforce the contract, so ought
tbe other. Tbe public interest will " be
best promoted, if the several States will
provide adequate protection and remedies
for the freedmen- Until this is in some
way accomplished, there is no chance for
tne advantageous use ol their labor ; and
the blame ot ill-success will not rent oif
them.
I know that sincere philanthropy is
earnest for the immediate realization of
remotest aims; but time is always an
element in reform. It is one of the
greatest acts on record to have brought
four millions of people into freedom. The
career of free industry must be fairly
opened to them ; and then their future
prosperity and condition must, after all
mainly on themselves. Ii' they fi
80 perish away, let us be careful that
failure shall not be attributable to any
denial of justice. In all that relates to the
destiny of the freedmen, we need not be
anxious to read the futurit many in
cidents which, from a speculative point of
iow, itiigui luiae aiumi, wilt quietly settle

THE EVILS OF SLAVERY.
ow mat slavery is at an end or near
end, the greatness of its evil, in the
point of view of public economy, becomes
more and more apparent. Slavery was
essentially a monopoly of labor, and as
locked the States where it prevailed
against tbe incoming of free industry.
Where labor was the property of the cap
italist, tbe white man was excluded from
employment, or had but the second best
chance of finding it ; and the foreign em
igrant turned away from the region where

denser population than is found as yet In

ture influx of population to them will be

cultivated nations in Kurope. From the

Our Government springs from and was
for tbe people not the people for
Government. To tbem it owes allegi
ance; from them it must derive its cour

Government is thus bound to defer to the
from whom it derives its existence,
should, from the very consideration of
origin, be strong in its power of resis
to the establishment of inequalities.
Monopolies, perpetuities, and class legis
lation, are contrary to the genius of tree
fovernment, and ought not to be allowed,
ere, there Is no room for favored classes

but, as the agent and representative of the

nopolies, which, in themselves, ought
never to be granted, and which, where
they exist must be subordinate and yield

INTERNAL COMMERCE.
The Constitution confers on Congress
the right to regulate commerce among the
several States. It is of the first necessity,
for the maintenance -of tbe Union, that
that commerce should be free and unob
structed. No State can be justified in any
device to tax the transit of travel and
commerce between States. The position
of many States is such that, if they were
allowed to take advantage of it for pur
poses of local revenue, the commerce be
tween States might be injuriously bur
dened, or even virtually prohibited. It
best, while the eountry is still young, and
while the tendency to dangerous monopo
lies' of this kind is still feeble, to use the
power of Congress so as to prevent any
selfish impediment to the tree circulation
ot men and merchandise. A tax on travel
and merchandise, in their transit, consti
tutes one of the worst forms of monopoly,
and the evil is increased if coupled with a
denial of the choice of route. When the
vast extent of our country is considered.
it is plain that every obstacle to the free
circulation of commerce between the
States ought to be sternly guarded against
by appropriate legislation, within the
limits of the Constitution.

from this source are sufficient to cover the

THE PENSION BUREAU.
The lamentable events of the last f.m
years, and the sacrifices made bv the gal
hint men of our Army and Navv, have
swelled the records of the Pension Bureau
to an unprecedented extent. On tbe 30th
day of June last, tbe total number of pen
sioners was 85,986, requiring for their an
nual pay, exclusive of expenses, the sum
of 48,023,445. The number of applications
mat nave been allowed since that date will
require a large increase of this amount fo
tne next fiscal year. The means for th
payment of the stipends due, under exist.

ors, and to the families of such as have
perished in the service of the country
will no doubt be cheerfully and promptly

and tne expenditures to $13,694,723, leav

The revenue system of the country is a
subject of vital interest to its honor and
prosperity, and should command the
earnest consideration of Congress. The
Secretary of the Treasury will lay before

of tbe first quarter of the present
year, of tbe probable receipts and
expenditures for the other three quarters,

30th of June, 18C6. I might content
myself with a reference to that report, in
which you will find all the information re
quired for your deliberations and decision.
tbe paramount importance of the sub

measures which are required for the good
character, and, I might almost say, for the
existence of this people. The life of a
republic lies certainly in the energy, virtue,
intelligence of its citizens ; but it is
equally true that a good revenue system is

ing of Congress since the return of peace,. it
is of the utmost importance to inaugurate a
just policy, which shall at once be put in
motion, and which shall commend itself to
those who come after us for its continuance.
We must aim at nothing less than the com
plete effaceraent of the financial evils that
necessarily followed a state of civli war.
We must endeavor to apply the earliest
remedy to the deranged state of the cur
rency, and not shrink from devising a
policy which, without being oppressive to
the people, shall immediately begin to effect
a reduction of the debt, and, if persisted in,
discharge it fully within a definitely fixed
number of years.
THE CURRENCY MUST BE CONTRACTED.
It is our first duty to prepare in earnest
for our recovery from the erer increasing
evils of an irredeemable currency, without
a sudden revulsion, and yet without un
timely procrastination, f or that end, we
must, each in our respective positions,pre-
pare tne way. I hold it the duty of the
Executive to insist upon frugality in the
expenditures ; and a sparing economy is
itself a great national resource. Of the
banks to which authority has been given
to issue notes secured by bonds of the
United States, we may require the great
est moderation and prudence, and the law
must be rigidly enforced when its limits
are exceeded. We may, each one of us,
counsel our active and enterprising coun
trymen to be constantly on their guard, to
liquidate debts contracted in a paper cur
rency, and, by conducting business as
nearly as possible on a system of cash
pa3-ments or short credits, to hold them
selves prepared to return to the standard
of gold and silver. To aid our fellow
citizens in the prudent management of their
monetary affairs, the duty devolves on
us to diminish by law the amount
of paper money now in circulation. Five
years ago the bank-note circulation of the
country amounted to not much more than
two hundred millions ; now the circula
tion, bank and national, exceeds seven
hundred millions. The simple statement
of the fact recommends more .strongly
than any words of mine could do, the
necessity of our restraining this expan
sion The gradual reduction of the cur
rency is the only measure that can save
the business of the country from disas
trous calamities ; and this can be almost
imperceptibly accomplished by gradually
funding the national circulation in securi
ties that may be made redeemable at the
pleasure of the Government.
THE WAY TO TAX.
Our debt is doubly secure first in the
actual wealth and still greater undevelop
ed resources of the country ; and next in
the character of our institutions. The most
intelligent observers among political econ
omists bave not failed to remark, that the
public debt of a country is safe in propor
tion as its people are free; that the
debt of a republic is safest of
all. Our history confirms and
establishes the theory, and is, I firmly be
lieve, destined to give it a still more signal
illustration. The secret of this superior
ity springs not merely from the fact that in
republic the national obligations are dis
tributed more widely through countless
numbers in all classes of society ; it has
its root in the character of our luws. Here
all men contribute to the public welfare,
and bear their fair share of the public bur
duns. During the war under the impulses
of patriotism, tne men of tbe great body
of the people, without regard to their own
comparative want of wealth, thronged to
our armies and filled our fleets of war, and
neia memseives ready to otler their lives
for the public good. Now, in their turn,
tho property and income of the
country should bear their just pro
portion of the burden of taxation,
while in our impost system, through
means ot which increased" vitality is inci
dentally imparted to all the industrial in
terests of the nation, tbe duties should be.
so adjusted as to fall most heavily on ar
ticles of luxury, leaving the necessaries of
life as free from taxation as the absolute
wants of the Government, economicallv
administered, will justify. N. fnvnred
class should demand freedom from assess-
ment,.and the taxes should be so distrib
uted as not to fall unduly on the poor, but
rather on the accumulated wealth of the
country. We should look at the national
debt just as it is not as a national blessr
ing, but as a heavy burden on the Industry
of tbe country, to lie discharged without
unnecessary delay.
ESTIMATES.
Bv tbe Secretalv nf the
Treasury that the expenditures for the
nscal year ending the 30th of June, 1866,
will exceed the receipts $112,194,947. It
gratifying, however, to state that it is
also estimated that the revenue for the
year ending the aoth of June, 1867, will
exceea ine expenditures in the sum
oi iit,u.i;,nio. xnis amount, or so
much as may be deemed sufficient
lor the purpose, may be applied to tha r.
duction of the public deb;, which, on the
iisi day ol Octouer, 1805, was $2,740,854.

of
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
I have dwelt thus fully on our domestic
anairs because oftheir transcendent import
ance. Under any circumstances, our
great extent of territory and variety of
ciiinnte, producing almost every thing
that is necessary for the wants, and even
comforts of man, make us singularly
independent of the varying policy of for
eign Powers, and protect us agajiisl
every temptation to "entangling alliances,"
while at the present moment the re-estab-lishmeut
of harmony, and the strength that
comes from harmony, will be our best secu
rity against "nations who feel power and
forget right." For myself, it has been and
will be my constant aim ti promote neace
amity with all foreign nations and Pow
; and I have every reason to believe that
all, without exception, are animated by
same disposition. Our relations with
.Emperor of China, so recent in their
origin, are most friendly. Our commerce
bis dominions is receiving new devel
opments; and it is very pleasing to find
the Government of that great Empire
manifests satisfaction witb our policy, and
reposes just confidence in the fairness which
marks our intercourse. The unbroken har
mony between the United States and the
Emperor of Russia, is receiving a new sup
port from an enterprise designed to. carry
telegraphic lines across the continent of
through his dominions, and so to con
us with all Europe bv a new channel
intercourse. Our commerce with South
America is about to receive encours gement by
uirect line ui man steamships to the ns
ng Empire of Brazil. . The diatiDPuishad
party of men of science who have recently
our country to mske a scientific exulo-
ration of the natural history and rivers and
mountain ranges of tbat region, have re
ceived from the Emperor that generous wel
wnicu was to nave been expected
his constant friendship for tbe United
tales, ana nis wen known zeal in promot-
the advancement of knowledge. A
is entertained thatonr onmuierce with
rich and populous countries that bor
der the c-tttierranean sea may be largely

of this Government, to extend the pro
tection of our flag over the enterprise of
fellow-citizens. We receive from the
rowers in that region assurances of 'good
and it is worthy of note that a special

mission from the insurgent States. These
ships, having once escaped from British
porta, ever afterwards entered tbem in
every 'part of the world, to refit, and
so to renew their depredations. The
consequences ' of this conduct were
most disastrous to the States thea in rebel

by the prolongation of our civil contest.

tent, to drive the American flag from the
sea. and to transfer much of our shipping
and our commerce to the very Power whose
suhieets had created the necessity for
such a change. Thee events took place
before I was called to the administration of
the Government. The sincere desire for
peace by which I am animated led me to
approve the proposal, already made, to sub
mit the questions which had thus arisen be
tween tbe countries to arbitration. These
questions are of such moment that they
must have commanded the attention of the
great Powers, and are so interwoven with
the peace and interests of every one ef
them as to have ensured an impartial deci
sion. I regret to inform you that Great
Britain declined the arbitrament, but, on
the other hand, invited us to the formation
of a joint commission to settle mutual
claims between the two countries, from
which those for the depredations before
mentioned should be excluded. Tbe propo
sition, in that very unsatisfactory form, has
been declined.
The United States did not present the
subject as an impeachment of the good faith
of a Power which was professing the most
friendly dispositions, but as involving ques
tions of public law, of which the settlement
is essential to the peace of nations; and,
though pecuniary reparation to their injured
citizens would have followed incidentally on
a decision against Great Britain, snch coin
pensation was not their primary object.
They had a higher motive, and it was in the
interests ol peace and justice to establish
important principles of international law.
The correspondence will be placed before
vou. The ground on which-the British Min
ister rests his justification is, substantially,
ti.at tne municipal law or a nation, and the
domestic interpretations of that law, are
the measure of its duly as a neutral:
and I feel bound to declare my opinion,
before you and before the world, that that
justification cannot be sustained before
the tribunal of nations. At the same time
1 do not advise to any present attempt at
redress by acts of legislation. For the
future, friendship between the two coun
tries must rest on the basis of mutual
justice.
THE MONROE DOCTRINE—FRANCE AND
MEXICO.
From the moment of the establishment
of our free Constitution, the civilized
world has been convulsed by revolutions
in the interests of democracy or of mon
archy; but through all those revolutions
the United States have wisely and firmly
refused to become propagandists of re
publicanism. It is the only government
suited to our condition: but we have never
sought to impose it on others: and we
bave consistently followed the advice of
Washington to recommend it only by the
careful preservation and prudent use of
tne blessing. LIuring all the intervening
period the policy of European Powers and
of the United States has, on the whole.
been harmonious. Twice, indeed, rumors

both occasions the remonstrance of the
United States was respected, from a deep

ernments, that the system of non-inter-
lerence and mutual abstinence from propa
