Another Editorial Change.
By reference to the last number of the
Watchman , it may", he seen that another
change has taken place in the editorial de
partment. -Toe W. Furey lias associated
himself with Mr. Alexander in the publica
tion ot that paper. We were schoolmates
and alwayshave been warm iriends and while
we wish Joe all the success immaginable in a
pecuniary point of view, we beg leave to take
expressions to the views expressed in bis
salutatory, in regard to the cause of the pres
ent war.
la common with the editors of ft certain
class of Newspapers, be throws the blame of
our National troubles attbe.feet of Republi
esns, and attaches all the stigma to tbeir
skirts, wbile he says not a word in condem
nation of the acts of those whim he chooses
to style " our brethren of the South but
who we style the infernal traitors who nre
working for the distruction of the Union
We acknowledge no relation with them now !
Tbey have firfeitod all clai.us of motherhood
with patriots- O. ce they were our brethren ;
Dot so now. The gentleman goes of in a very
" eloquent style" as to who we si all question
about the " cause of all this ? aje the cause?"
Go, says he. ask Henry Ward Beecher,
William Loyd Garrison, Horace Ureely,
Vr'endall Philips, Anson Buningamo, Sal
la in P. Chase, liinfon, R iwan, Helper, " and
eee if they can look you in the face and tell
v>u the cause —aye the cause ? We p resume
that as tbese men are intelligent and learned
USJ tb?y might be able to tell the cause. It
aot, however, we would merely suggest the
Dames of Mr. Jefferson Davis, or Mr. Breck
invidge, a proper person to whom to apply
for the desired information. Or if they tan
,oi be app.o.iched, at present, perhaps Mr
Masjn or Slidell, who are more easy oj access
conld teil the cause!
' XIJ al3o 6aya we iu:iy much fear that Abo
rtion 'K at the b' t*om of it all—that it is the
jrim- ry and main cause of all our war. We
tbir k tbat f ltnetbing there must be whicn is
the cause f Abolitionism, and that something
certai Jy L s accry■ Therefore if we were to
aiix. .'rite 1 Abolitionism, is the cause of our
trouble, we must certainty look to slates as
the trreaifrst cuuje.
The Belief Tax.
That there should be men in the North, in
Pennsylvania—in Centre County, who are
not loyal to this its hour of
sore trial, and seems almost beyond belief;
yet we are sorry to say that'there are such
men in Centre County, and in fact in almost
ever section of the North. Men whose con
duct subjects them to the contempt and de
vision of all honest men. Men who in every
wnv allowable, abuse the Administration and
all th se connected with its effort to put dowu
this unholy rebellion. Men who would rath
er fistht under of the rebels than un
der the flag of the G ivernraent which has
been to them a shield and protection.
There are different ways of distinguishing
these men frura the loyal and liberty loving
portion of the community. One of their
prominent characteristics is their readiness
to assail the Administration and those in
power for every seeming defeat or mistake
which occurs in the management of the aff
airs of the nation. If the army lays at
Washington too long to suit their they
cry, ' on to Richmond." If the army starts
to Richmond via Manassas and is met by
overwhelming membets of the jenemy and
defeated ; they cry, inability" " hot haste,"
&c. Thus they'find something in every act
of the Government to cavil at, and hope to be
able thus to aid in the overthrow of the
Union.
•Lately, however commenced to
show out extensively. A tax has been iaid
for the purpose of raising money to sustain
the wives a id children of our noble volun
teers who are now fi hting to maintain our
liberties and their liberties, wbo are giving
up the enjoyment of home and subjecting
themselves to the privation of camp life, and
risking their lives in order tht this rebellion
may be crushed and the horrors of war kept
from spreading its flighting influence over
the fair valleys of the Keystone^State.
These men in common'with the rest ef us
are called upon to pay their proportion of
this tax, and this has given them Dew cause
for complaint. That the laying"of this tax
was an absolu e necessity, every man can
see. That it is fair ihut U should be laid
without any complaint is conceed"
eJ by every reasonub'e and intelligent man ;
and that it it laid and must he paid these
true hearted .men havo, no doubt, formed out
ere this. What kind of a heart must a man
have, who would see the families of cur vol
unteers suffer during the absence of their
protectors, when he is enjoying the comforts
of the home which the volunteer is protecting.
Such a man i unfit for civilized sociity. He
should be hooted at, wherever seen, and
branded worse than a traitor.
The tax has proves to be unsufficient and
at a meeting held in this town some time
since a committee was appointed to solicit
the citizens of Centre county to loan money
to the county to be applied to the purpose
for which the tax was laid, That committee
is now at work, and it behooves these men
of whjm we have been writing, to get over
the prejudice, which has heretofore influen
ced them, and to loan what monev thev can
to vuuutj, and thus make amends
for the ungrateful manner in which they have
been acting.
On, ye pursy farmers of Pennevslley and
Brusbvalley, consider the condition of your
country. Consider that she is in danger of
bniDg overthrown and that your money may
aid in sustaining her. Go to those old chest s
where for years you have been hoarding your
silver and your gold, turn that strong lock,
open it and take therefrom a portion of your
treasure and put it to use. Let the commis
sioners use it for the benefit of the families
of those poor soldiers who are on the Poto
mac, in South Carolina, in Kentucky, in
Missouri, fighting for your liberties and your
homes. What are your farms, your fine resi
dences, your big red barns worth to you if
the Government fails to quell tbia rebellion
—if the union be destroyed ?
Let the families of the soldiers bd well ca
red for and our battles will be well fought
Let the families be neglected—lst the relief
tax be taken from tbem and what will be tbe
result? Wou'd our volunteers suffer it?—
Would they stay in the field while their fam
ilies starved ? Or would they raise up in
righteous rebellion and come borne to provide
for their,wives and their children ? We be
lieve that Jeff. Davis & Co., could effect more
against the North having this relief tax re
moved, if he had the power to do so, than be
oould do with all the men be can mustar in
the South.
Let the so'diers from Centre countyjbe of
good cheer. There are good men and true
men among us who would spend their last
dollar to insure tbe happiness and comfort of
tbeir families.
The Homicide Case.
The trial of Lipton and Hiys for the murder of
Huston Poorm-u commenced on Thursday the
28th uh. When the Jury was empanelled the
Disrtict Attorney, for reasons, declined to act,
and requested tho Court to appoint James Mac
inanus, Esq., to conduct the prosecution on part
of the Commonwealth, which was conducted with
ability by Mr. Mat-m.-inus and Wm. A. Wallace of
Clearfield. The evidence for the Commonwealth
was introduced, and when closed, then the evi
dence for the defence, the whole occupying until
Saturday afternoon. The argument was e immenc
ed by arrangement of tho council. Judge Hale
commenced for the defence in his usual able style.
He was followed by W. A. Wallace, Esq., for the
Commonwealth, in an eloquent and able speech.
Tho Court adjourned until Monday, the 2d inst.,
when Mr. McAllister addressed the Jury for over
five hours, leaving no point of the evidence and
law untouched. Mr. Macmanns closed, on part of
Commonwealth, in an able and legal argument on
the law and evidence. When he concluded, his
t.on. Judge Linn delivered a lengthy and able
charge to the Jury, stating and explaining tho
law involved in the case, and reviewing the evi
dence pro and con, after which the Jury retired to
their room, and were out all night and until 12
o'clock on Tuesday, when they returned the ver
dict, finding Hays not guilty, and Lipton guilty
of manslaughter. The sentence of Lipton is de
ferred until Tuesday the 24th inst. We should
like to hare given full particulars of this exciting
trial but cannot do so at present.
Tiie Italan army is impatient for action and
demands are made either for war or for dia
banding.

The Barefooted Printer Boy.
Thn Pittsburg " Morning Ariel," gives the
following story of a distinguished citizen of
Pennsylvania. Some thirty years ago a bare
.footel boy floated down the Susquehanna on
an bumble raft, and arrived at Harrishurg.
He came from the North, and belonged to
a large family ; all bis worldly goods were
Med up in a pocket handkerchief. He sough
and obtained employment in a printing ofiice
H* an apprentice. From an apprentice to a
Journeyman, from a journeyman to a report
er, from a reporter to an editor, the printer
boy walked his way, ngainst obstacles which
the suffering poor only know. The perseve
rance with which he followed in Franklin's
footsteps began to realiz; for him the fruits
of toil and privation. The young aspirant
became printer to the- Siate, and by frugal
management was soon enabled to accomplish
the object nearest his heart—the establish
ment ot his m ither in a home above want,
and in posses-ioB of every comfort she could
desire. Ilis brothers were his next care; and >
like Napoleon be had a strong arm with whieh
to aid them—an indomitable perseverence
that nothing could long successfully obstruct
In a few rears, they, too, with his sisters,*
were independent in the world, the once bare
footed printer boy was in possession of afflu
ence and wealth, surrounded by ayouog and
affectionate family. He was a friend of the
friendless, a patron of merit, and encourager
of industry. He rose in honor and office, un
till the barefooted printer boy who entered a
printing office in Harrishurg, hungry and
weary, laid down bis bundle on a pile of wet
paper and ai-ked to become a printer's ap
prentice, was elected a United States Senator,
This man is Simon Cameron, the present Sec
lekury of War.
FAITHFUL MINISTERS OFUBALTB.-ID examining
the vessels at the various wharves we find among
the curiosities of our commerce the~brig Miranda,
just in from Truxillo with a cargo of Honduras
Sarsaparilla for Dr. J. C. Ayer A Co., of Lowell.
So particular are this firm as to the articles used
in eompounding their various remedies, that thoy
have this drug, like some others they consume,
gathered for them by a sßillful agent of their own
in the tropical regions of its growth. He informs
us ihat there are many species of this plant, but
two of which are really valuable in medicere; the
qualites of these are also affected by the time of
gathering, mode of curing, etc, operations which
in'that region of unreliable workmen imposes a
heavy labor upon him. One of the inert verities
ot 1 Sarsaparilla grows wild in our own forests,
while several others, nearly worthless, abount in
Central and South America. The intelligent
agent assured us that the virtues of this drug had
never been fully told, and that the reason of the
low esteem in which many hold it is mainly dee
to the importation of sueh immense quantities of
the worthle.-s varieties. His accouts of his trips
to Honduras and his bu ioess excursions along
the 3ulf of Dulce and the rivers of Montagua and
Santiago and among the adjacent mountain were
of intense interest. We caiinot but commend and
honor his employers for the faithfulness and en
ergy with which they execute their trust a3 min
isters to the public health, and we suspect that
I this course is at least ono of the reasons why their
' medicines are held in such extraordinary favor
throughout the civiled world.— New York City i

ARMY CORRESPONDENCE.
OLD POINT COMFORT, 1
Deo. 2nd. 1861. J
EDITOR CENTRE DEMOCRAT :—Would a short
account of the Centre county boys prove interest
ing to you and your numerous readers ? I know
there are a number that are anxioas for every iota
ot intelligence, that wait with fearful anxiety and
throbbing hearts, to hear of the welfare of the lov.
Ed ones that have left home, friends and all they
hold dear on earth, for the defense of their belov
ed country. But there are others in Centre coun -
ty who would glory in the massacre of her sons ;
who would exult and gloat over their deaths—the
deaths of those who have gone, in fact, to defend
their homes and their liberties. How often havo
I heard the expression in the Regiment, " Let us
crush out the traitors of the South, and then
march through a certain portion of Centre county
and crush it out there." Down with traitors,
North or South, but especially in the North. The
proper plaee for them would be Forts Lafayette
and Warren.
You have already had an actount of our trip
from Camp Curtin to CampjjHale, near Bladens
burg, so it is not necessary to repeat it again.—
After remaining there about two weeks we found
that the health of the Regiment was suffering and
that it was absolutely necessary to remove to a
new encampment. After a search of a day or two,
the Colonel succeeded in finding a suitable piece
of ground, distant about three miles from Wash
ington, on the Baltimore railroad. On Monday
the 18th November, we struck our tents and went
to our new encampment, and commenced immedi
ately in making ourselves as comfortable as pos
sible, supposing we wauld remain there some time.
On Tuesday, the day following, while marching
out to be reviewed an order was received from
Q-n. McClellan to proceed to Fortress Monroe,
Va., via Baltimore. The news was received with
tremendous rounds of applause. Cheer after cheer
rent the air, and amidst the din could be heard,
hurrah for Old Point Comfort! three cheers for
Gen. McClella ! three for Gen. Wool, three for
Col. Welsh, etc. Another knot were singing,'way
down South to the land of niggers ! The sick be
came well, the well felt better, and all were anx
ious 'to? accompany,' us. Wo were ordered to bo
ready to take the cars at 2 P. M. Of course we
were ready at that time, but we wero the only
ones, as the cars did not arrive until one o'clock
at night. What a jolly time the boys had of it, ly
ing out iQ the frosty nigh*, "while the moon shone
bright,?' Ac. . But no complaing was beard ; on
the efHtfrary were marry, and fuH of fun. Huge
camp-fires were built; old pipes were pulled out
of pockets ; puffs of smoke ascended; hunks of to
bacco came out next, and a chaw taken, and then
streams of saliva would take some unlucky fellow
in the eye, while he, perhaps, would draw up his
persuader and put tobacc.-.chetvurs eye in mourn
ing.
So time passed. Capt. J. Irvin Curtin and I,
feeling unwell, proceeded to a farm house about
10 o'clock, where we remained till one, when we
left with great reluctance, as our host was very
kind to us, supplying us with some ,of the sub
stantiate of ' : fj, such as , weil.no difference
what, you know, we wore unwell. We arrived in
Baltimore next day about 12 o'clock, after a very
tedious ride of twelve hours. Had dinner furnish
ed us at the dpot of bread, cheese and coffee,
which the boys went into with a will, and t'< also
went into them. Remained at the depot until 4
P. M-, when we marched for the wharf nnd em
barked on the steamboat .PocaAon fas, a boat that
was built in the year one, as One of boys remark
ed. We set sail about 5 P. M ; sailed all night,
and reached Old Point Coinfbrt about 5 P. M. the
noa t Joy, TturoJoy. Our sail down the bay was
very pleasant, no accident of any kind occurring,
or anything transpiring to make us feel unpleas
ant. When near the mouth of the Potomac we
were stopped by a federal gun-hoat, our papers
examined, found all right, when we proceeded on
our journey, at the same time giving theree cheers
for the American flag that floated over the boa:.
Thousands of dacks covered the bay, innumerab.e
sea gulls flitted over us, while huge porpoises co'd
be seeD in the water. Such expressions as the
following could bo heard on the deck : " Oh ! did
you see that? Whata tremendous sea-hog ! There—
'lll be doa b'ast if that 'aint a shark ! Ualloe,
A djut. Nt Gregg, did you see that whale ?
" Yet in your eye." I think the boys did not
believe that expression of thojAdjutants. We ar.
arrived at the Fortress and marched out about a
mile and a half to Camp Hamilton, which is a
very excellent camping ground; Fortress Monroe
is a magnificent affair—all that it has been repre
sented. Several hundred guns are mounted, while
balls, shells, cannister and grape-shot are piled
up in vicinity of them, ready at all times to give
the rebels a warm reception. When inside the
inside the Fort you think you are in a small town,
as there is quite a number of handsome lesideu
ces, with stores, post ofiice, Government bakeries,
blacksmith shops and other building for Govern
ment purposes.
Gen. Wool occupies a very beautiful residence
within the Fort. The General looks very aged,
though he is quite active, riding about the differ
ent Camps, reviewing troops, Ac. The Union
gun is mounted outside of the Fort on the beach,
and is loaded at all times. Her weight is 52,000
lbs., is rifled, and the ball she throws I think wo'd
test the strength of some of your hardy mountain
eers. She has al2 inch bore and isabout 161 feet
long. The Floyd gun lies on the beach not moun
ted, weight 49,090 lbs,length 15 ft, bore 15inches.
I though I would crawl in her and look out the
touch hole, but I only succeeded in geting in
about two feet when 1 thought it would be better
to back out, as the bore was becoming smaller,
and a person might stick. If we only could get
Jeff. Davis to peep in the Union gun, and then
touch her off. Whew !
The health of the Regiment is middling go id
now—only a few cases of measles. No accident
of any kind has occurred, and the men are all in
good spirits, ready and willing at all times to meet
the enemy. Our Col's., Welsh and Beaver, are
beloved by all the men, and the men will follow
them where'er they lead, knowing they will lead
to victory and not defeat. Our Centre Co. boys
have been very fortunate in securing such excel
lent officers. Dr. Potter is well, and s'ands high
as a Physician. His constant attention, his care
of tbe sick, and his close attention to his duties
has been a subject of daily remark amongst the
commissioned officers of the Regiment. The high
reputation ho held in Centre county is fully sus
tained here.
In a few days we expect to leave for South Car
olina or Florida, and I think it would be advisa
ble, as it was snowing last night and quite cold.
With a list of the Commissioned Officers of our
company, and I willclose. The name cf the com
pany is the " Bald Eagle Infantry." An election
was held at Camp Cartin, and J. Irvin Curtin was
elected Captian, Theodore Gregg First Lieuten
ant, and William P. Grove Second Lieutenant.—
On tho 27th of October, Lieut. Gregg was appoin
ted Adjutant of tho Regiment, and Wm. P. Grove
was promoted to First Lieutenant. Wo held an
election to-day for Second Lieutenant, and Wm.
W. Tyson was elected.
If advisable I may continue my corraspondence.

has esmmcneed to pay the Regiment off. Oar
company will receive about $4,000, being two and
a half months pay from the 16th of August to the

J. W. B.
FORTRESS MOXROB, Dec. 3d, 1861
FRIRRD BRISBIK: —This being a warm and
beautiful day, and having a meager amount of
time, it is no more than just that I devote it your
many readers by endeavoring to give them a cor
rect account of the actions of the Fourty Fi/ih,
which c ntains about three hundred and twenty
Centre County boys—comprising' companies A.
D. E. and part of B. Company D,. being the one
in which the writer is a member, it becomes me
to give our officers a. notice as we page in writing
of the Regiment. Of our Captain we bespeak
fame, he has already won the esteem of bis supe
rior officers, and men, and if an opportunity pre
; sents itself, will prove a hero. Lieuts, Gregg and
Goodfellow are alike worthy of praise for the
soldier-like treatment of their men, who feel
proud of their moral and manly officers.
Thomas Welobour Colonel, a citizen of Colum
bia, wins much esteem by his strict military dis
cipline and for the good behavior of his men.—
' Lieut. Colonel Jas. A. Beaver of Bellefonte, is
quite a favorite with the Regiment and will win
great honor in the field of battle. Major Hil
borße of Tioga County,is just our idea what, a Ma
jor should be—jolly, brave, and immoderate
joker and generous to a fault. Adjutant Tbeo.
Gregg of Bellefoneis highly esteemed as a gentle
men and a soldier; he is well known among your
readers and it would be useless to comment on his
biography further, than, to say that he endured
the hardships of a march to Mexico, and was se
verely wounded at the storming of Chapulteaec.
be is well qualified for a regimental officer, and in
time, for the good deeds he has done will claini a
page in the Future Hiitory of the United States.
Uuder such officers the Pennsylvania 45th Reg.,
after the proclaiming of peace, will return home
covered with honor; the pride of their relatives,
and their actions, a theme for the pen of every
ready writer. Perhaps a rudo sketch of our jour
! nies, since writing four weeks ago, would interest
1 your readers. Wo left our Camp at Bladeusburg
on Sunday, marched through the low sandy bot
toms of Maryland into Carrol County, to the
Countv seat—Prince Fredrick a miserable little
villiage of seven low houses, an old brick Court
House, and an old tumbled-down stone Jail. The
Court House was burned by the British under
General Ross in 1812. We remained in the vil
lage during election day, and being quartered in
the Court room, we had the extreme pleasure of
seeing the clerks tell off 32 of a majority for tae
Arch Traitor Howard, a cann,idat| for Governor,
but now a resident.' t" Hotel Lafayette." On the
walls of the Court. House were many fantastic fig
ures, penciled b-y some crack brained rebel, and
intended for our chief Executive. Among the
gleamings I selected the following verse of ma
chine poetry, which I give verbatum as traced on
the wall:
• ' A. Lincoln, the abolition tyrant,
With the names of union he deceices the aged
and tho yOl ng;
Tbo heedless, thoughtless man belives,
Until he binds his fetters strong."
(Signed,) "A CORSTITPTIORAL THIRO."
But to pass along briefly I will omit many lit
tie incidents that occurred, as it would occupy too
much space in your paper, that may be filled with
more useful readings. After arresting eleven se
cessionists we packed our baggage in the wagoDs
and took up our line of mareh for our old Camp,
which we reached after a hard three days march,
having accomplished our object hnd travelling
about one hundred and sixty-four miles in about
five days. Our prisoners were released some on
taking the osth of allegiauue, and some on paroie
of honor.
A few days after our tramp, while on our way
for review, we again received command of—"pack
knapsacks and prepare for a trip te " Fortress
Monroe. " Cneer after cheer arose from the Offi
cers and men on the reception of this joyful in
telligence. Retracing our stops we soon rolled
up our tents and mounting the old iron korse we
we were soon ne routee for Baltimore. Having
reached the city next morning and regalin, our
selves on bread and cheese, provided us by the
kind Union citizens of Baltimore, we marched to
the wharf and boarding an old freight steamer,
called the " Pocobantas," glided from the landing
into the bay, cheering lustly for the Union. Our
Band playing a national tune, we soon lost sight
of Baltimore.
We had a fine view of the coast, which for miles
is divided into beautiful farms, which, with their
snow white cottages glistening in the sun, presen
ted quite a grand uppearanco. At night the deck
was crowded with our boys, and every nook
that afforded the least shelter was occupied by
eager sleepy soldiers. In the morning the sun
rose beautiful and red, giving crimson tints to the
pillars of the clouds that seemed heaped one on
another, and gave" the Eastern horizon the ap
pearance of a grand glowing fire and was doubly
grand by being reflected on a vast sheet of water
bound on every side, only by the far-off tho blue
sky. Our boys were much amazed by the sight
of the Dolphins, Sturgeons, and other large fish
that floated around the boat. As evening came
on we glided past-the mouth of James River where
were landed the first whooly contrabands, who
were the cause of our present difficulties, and it
was with regretful hearts we looked on this war ;
chiding the white men for their almost unpardon
able crime, pnd wishing them with their victims
a watery erave, ere the polution of American
soil. Casting oureyes to the opposite shore, "Sew
all's Point," the stroDghold mi the traitors came
in view, and with the aid of a spyglass we could
discern their movements. Landing at the Fortress
we wended our way from her gate, down the
beach, and pitched our tents half way from the
Fortress to the ruins of Hampton, which is in full
sight of our camp, her black walls and lone ohim
neys being a true type of man's shrewd desola
tion and reverting the winters mind to the many
once happy homes now reduced by the strong
arm of indignant justice.
Within a few hundred yards of our tents is the
beautiful mansion of Ex-President Rebel Lyler,
now the abode of contraband darkies who are
truly fit successors to the would be proud earl of
secessiondom.
We are awaiting shipping to Port Royal, South
Carolina, and when we make sail your readers
shall again bear from the Forty-Fifth. More

The following is a copy of a private letter re
ceived by one of our citizens from a soldier in the
First Pennsylvania Cavalry :
llosriTAi,, CAMP PIRRPORT, 1
Nov. 30th, 1861. j
MR. B :
Dear Sir :—Thinking that you would
be anxious to hear from our quarters, I have ta
ken the liberty of dropping you a few lines. I
am now engaged on extra duty at the Regimental
Hospital, and have been here for some time, I
} enjoy rcsonable health considering the exposure
j we are subject to.
Our Division, the Fenn'a. Reserve, still occu-
I pies about the same position it did a month ago,
and no likelihood of it soon moving. We had a
| little taste of fight the other day, the first our reg- I
J inient hns had with the rebels. Wo set out fiom !
I camp at 9 o'clock on Tuesday night and proceeded
j out the Leesburg pik about five miles ; then tak-
I ing a circuitous rout came in on tho rear of
Drainesville, haying heard that there were a lot i
of rebels harbored th> ro. Wo surrounded the |
house, and amid the shrieking f frightcaeii we-
men, barking dogs, and a general uproari took 9.
Same of them we took from their beds, and giv*
idg them a limited time, such as two minutes, to
dress, marched them off. We placed tfcem in front
of the column UDder a strong guard and commenc
ed our match home. We had not proceeded over
three miles when, as we were passing through a
pine thicket, some concealed rebels opened a point
blank fire on the head of the column where the of
ficers were riding. At the first charge, Dr. Alex
andar, brother of Lawyer Alexander of your town,
assistant Surgeon of our Regiment was piercedby
three balls, one striking him in the abdomen, one
in the thigh, and one just above the knee. Al
most at the same instant the Colonels horse was
sh t under him, and himself slightly wounded.—
As my place was with the Surgeons I wa- right
in the midst of the muss, and for a short time en
joyed quite as much of the music of whistling bul
lets as was pleasant. The way they flew around
our heads for a few minutes was not slow. When
the tiring commenced I drew out my revolver and
thought I would try a hand in the fight too.—
Presently a secesh made his appearance. I drew
on him, but to my mortification it would neither
snap nor revolve. There I was with a fine chance
for a secesh, and a worthless pistol in hand. I nev
er was in such a fix in my life before—it was like
Paradise lost ; but I was soon relieved by another
fellow dropping him. Our Carbineers dismounted
and rushed inio the thicket, and the rest of the
regiment surrounded the woods so as to cut off
their retreat. In a few minutes we had them all
who did not escape, killed, wounded or taken
prisoners. How many we wounded we do not
know, but we killed two out-right, and brought in
twelve prisoners, one of whom has since died of
his wounds. We had three wounded, two of whom
have died. One of them was our much lamented
Dr. Alexander. He lingered till about 8 o'clock
yesterday morning. They took his body to Wash
ington last night. Our other wounded man is do
ing well. Yours Respectfully,
HENRY BOELL.
The Feeling in Congress on the
Slavery Question
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3,1861,
A single day's observation and intercourse
among toe members of the Congress has led
to the conclusion that with two or three insig
nificant exceptions, the Senators and Repre
sentatives agree in utter detestations of the whole
rebellion, and in the uncompromising spirit of
putting it down at whatever cost. Amongtnose
most urgent and resolute in taking these
positions are Democrats- There is, indeed, a
good deal of difference as to the means of man
er of giving*effect to this policy. Some are for
& declaration o etna.nc ; p vtioa ot the slaves of
insurgents; others for the confiscation of
slave property; and another class ft r levying
a tax upon the slaveholders, so that they may
by such a process feel the heaviest burdens
of the war. But on ad sides, as on the part
of Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Lyman
Trumbull in the Senate, as among'the ultra
Democrats. there is an open expression that
the property oj loyal slaveholders shall be pro
tected or paid for. A goo i deil of unncs
sary clamor has been oreat d by mischievous
men on this subject The ft ends of the' Ad
uiinstration arid the war have only to keep
there eye on the issue on whlc i they really
do agree as above staged, and they cannot
divide. One great truth stands out promi
nently, that the property of the trators is for
feited by the acts of the traitors, and that it
would bo unjust to except properly in slaves
from this rule. All ur loyal people ask t a
houses and lands, and golds and silver, and
stocks and securites, and cotton and powder
and oai non and ships, of Jefferson Davis
ai'd his robber associati s sho'ld be confiscated
and. rather than it should he used to damage
and" fe-troy the Union, should b- 1 annihilated
Would ir not be ran S nus if we exc-pred
from this rj|e the slaves of Davis and his
fo'lowe-s? H>w to di pise of the slaves,
whe her they shall he liberated or armed
whether ths ownership in ihem shall te eon
fisoated or taxed - are maters wisely eft by
tie President and Secretary of war t the
milittry authorises. No doubt Chngie-s
will pass some law hy which these author
iti-s may be guded in ths dispos irion of this
vexed question; hir there action will, in my
opinion, ba regula>ed ly the suggestions of
the President and the reasoning of his resp
ective ccnstitu'ional advisers.
A GALLANT SEAM AN. —At the Navy 11. spi
tal in Brooklyn there is a gillant officer
whose leg was torn offoy a round shot during
the late eit ar Port R lyal This
officer, in whose veins fl iws the good old
revo utionary bh od, was in command nf a
vessel at Llvetp' ol when the news reached
England ot the infamous opening of the war
at Ft. Sum'er. Leaving his snip at Waterloo
docks, he hastened home, < fferd his services
to the goverment. As acting master of one
of t e gunboats he was wounded in the
battle; but as soon as the tourniquet had beer,
applied to his leg he demanded that he shi u'd
be taken on deck again, where, without a
sigh or groan escaping him, he witnessed the
magnifioant ending of the c infest. The only
shot that took effect was tho ODe that made
him acr nple for life- But he says that
•that shot,' which he has preserved, 'is piioe
less. and that he will band it down to his
children as a suggestion to them, if thev
should ever be called upon t> offer th ir
bloo 1 for their country." He is proud, he
says that be loet one leg for the cause, and
is redy to offer the other one if a future
occasion should demand another sacrifice.
The Cnaplain of the House of Repre
sentatives at the opening of the House on
Monday, " prayed especially for the slave."
This is the first time since the organization
of our goverment. that such a prayer was at
temped to be made in the Hall of Congress,
and it is no less significant because it was
made at this time, when those who UDheld
the political and social rights of slavery are
violently attempting the disrupture of the
federal govermert. If such a prayer bad
been made by a chaplain of the House six
years ince, he would have been hurled from
the clerk's desk and doubtless assassinated in
the presence of the Representatives assembled
but now tbe prayer is listenod to witb respect
in Congress, and who dare doubt its merci
ful answer from Heaven. Thus the work
of mighty reform progresses, and thus the
rotten fabric of human oppressers begins to
be assailed. While our armies are arrayed
in battle against its advocares on the field,
the voice of prayer goes up fr >m the Halls
of legislation for mercy, nity, and emanci
pation for the slaves, All this is no miracle,
and yet it is the work of Clod.
Glorious News from Tennessee—
Parson Brownlow Heard From.
By a despatch from Cairo, we learn that a
copy of the Memphis Avalanche of the 2d
inst., received at that potnt. contains the glo
rious and inspiriing intelligence that the
Federal troops under Parson Brownlow had
attacked the Rebels at Morristown, East Ten
nesee, on the Ist inst., and after killing a
large number, completely routtd them. The
battle must indeed have been decisive when
the Rebels themselves not only acknowledge
a rout, but go so far as to say that it was the
" first Union victory." The question has
been frequently asked of late "Where is Par
son Brownlow V The organ of treason in
Memphis has told us a* least where ho was
on the Ist instant, and henceforward a suc
cession of victories over his oppressors will,
we doubt not, enable us to locate him.

ST. LOUIS, Dec, 7.— The Memphis papers of the

ing the appointment of Gen. Heath,of Vaginia, to
command the Department of Missouri, thus vir
tually superseding Gen. Price.
Some of the southern pagers say there is great
excitement at Nashville in regard ty drafting
troops for the rebel service. Some ten thousand
treops have arrived at Columbus, Ky., since the
battle of Belmont, and are rapidly concentrating
there. They dec'aro that seventy-five thousand
men cannot now take the position.
A telegram from East Pensacola reports a fed
eral fleet off Horn Island.
The Exchange of Prisoners.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.
The Government have decided to reieaee
as many Rebel prisoners of war as they will
release of oure. AH those in Boston have
been given permiseion to go to Richmond on
the condition that they do not take up arms
against this Government, unless duly ex
changed or releisted, and the same thing
will be done with all the prisrners of war we
now hold but not to includd the State priso
ners or those taken in the North ; so poisons
having friends in " Sicesh." who have been
taken prisoner, oan soon see tbem back, if
the Rebels nil accede to this mode.
