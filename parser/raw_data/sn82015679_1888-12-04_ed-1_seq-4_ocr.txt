Lord Sackville is called a "person." This
is awful, but suppose the President had re
ferred to him as an object!
The President treats the Sackville incident
as a solemn and momentous international af
fair. He insists on thinking that the govern
ment's toes "were trodden on. "I am the
state."
Secretary of War Endicott thinks too
much is done for the inmates of soldiers
homes and that they ought to be made to work
for a living. Mr. Endicott is right in line with
the President on this point, and would be of
great assistance to the latter in the work of
writing vetoes.
A JUST and sensible revision of our tariff
laws should be made for the relief of those
of oar countrymen who Buffer under present
conditions. Message.
A just and sensible revision of our tariff
laws should be made in the interest of busi
ness and of continued protection to American
industry.
For a man who has been in office less than
a year and has spent the most of that time in
working political wires. Postmaster-general
Dickinson is very free with recommendations
relating to the improvement of the service.
When a Republican, Con gTess wants advice
and information on these points it will call on
more experienced men than Dickinson.
DURING the past year 791 persons employed
in the postal service were arrested for offenses
against the laws. . How many were not arrest
ed who should have been the department re
port doea not say; but the statement that
44,917 jcmplaints were received in regard to
the ordlaary domestic mail and 4,820 concern
ing registered matter, indicates the existence
of a very largo number cf offenders. Turn
the rascals out.
The savage attack and almost murder per
petrated by a blatant Anarchist of this city
on his best friend and benefactor shows the
diabolical spirit that animates that class.
This brute had no grievance or cause of com
plaint against the man he attacked, except a
difference of opinion on the Socialist ques
tion. For this he tried to kill him. The po
lice should make special efforts to capture the
ruffian, and if there are any more vermin of
his kind they should be kept under surveil
lance. In advising the adoption by the govern
ment of a system of postal telegraphy Postmaster-general
Dickinson says the chief diffi
culties in the way are the great cost of pres
ent methods and the absence of safeguards,
which, "according to the theory of the pres
ent mail service, should protect the privacy
of correspondence." "Theory" is good in
thia connection. In practice the privacy of
correspondence is not protected under a Dem
ocratic administration, as thousands of Re
publicans could bear witness during the late
campaign.
Near the close of the month of October
last occurrences of a deeply regrettablo nature
were brought to my knowledge which made
it my painful but imperative duty to obtain,
with as little delay as possible, a new personal
channel of diplomatic intercourse in this coun
try with the government of Great Britain.
President's Message.
Translated into United States language,
thia would read: "Shortly before the election
a letter was published from the British min
ister to one Murchison, which was likely to
injure my prospects of re-election, and I in
formed the minister and his government that
under the circumstances I wouldn't have any
thing mora to do with him."
AMONG the campaign echoes is a reported
conversation between Mr. Cleveland and some
Connecticut Democrats, in which the Presi
dent expressed a doubt of carrying New York,
but hoped to carry Connecticut, Indiana and
Michigan. This indicates that the misguided
man put a great deal of confidence in Don
Dickinson, but the way the Republican ma
jority climbed up in that State must have un
dermined his faith in mankiudin general, and
Michigan "workers" in particular. As Mr.
Dickinson was heard to remark during the
campaign, "the election will be full of sur
prises." At the White House the Michigan
vote seems to have been one of the biggest.
A FEW days ago the Journal printed in its
sews columns a short biographical sketch and
portrait of Senator Colquitt, of Georgia. The
matter was furnished in the regular course of
business, and Senator Colquitt had nothing to
do with it. The Atlanta Constitution pre
tends to regard the publication as having been
procured by Mr. Colquitt, and says: "No
person could believe that he would think it
Accessary to call the President-elect's atten
tion to his peculiar line of politics for any per
sonal benefit, by having this biography pub
lished in the President-elect's journal." This
is not exactly our funeral, but it strikes us
that the Constitution is hitting below the
belt The Journal has no sympathy with
Senator Colquitt's politics, and would not care
if Mr. Henry W. Grady succeeded him in the
Senate, as it is well understood he desires to
do, but it is hardly chivalric for Mr. Grady's
paper to make this kind of an attack on Sen
ator Colquitt,, especially when there is no
foundation for it
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Mr. Cleveland's farewell message is very
Clevelandish in style and temper. If the
most characteristic parts and passages had
been left out it would be a much better mes-'
sage. Its individuality and exhibitions of Mr.
Cleveland's personality mar what would other
wise be a fairly good business message.
The Constitution says the President "shall
from time to time give to the Congress infor
mation of the state of the Union, and recom
mend to their consideration such measures as
he shall judge necessary and expedient" Mr.
Cleveland seems to construe the constitutional
requirement as a license to scold the country
for rejecting his free-trade policy, and lecture
the people for their lack of intelligence and
capacity for self government. Thia is very
characteristic of Mr. Cleveland. He is a
chronic scold and lecturer. The general tone
of most of his utterances is that of a man who
has devoted the best years of his life to trying
to save the American people from self-destruction,
and whose efforts have been crowned
with poor success. His pessimistic style be
speaks great anxiety for the fate of the coun
try when he shall let go of it We do not be
lieve his anxiety is shared by the people to
any great extent.
The solemn and ponderous way in which
the President begins by referring to the
dangers that threaten the government at
the beginning of its second hundred years of
national existence, 'and then lapses into
chronic platitudes about the tariff and sur
plus, seems like a great reach after something
statesmanlike. It only attains to mischievous
demagogy, for that is the size of his talk
about the growth of classes; the gulf between
employers and employes; the exactions of
capital; the WTongs of labor, etc. In all this
jeremiad about the decadence of patriotism
and morals there is not a sound principle nor
healthy idea. No President has ever before
so roundly lectured the American people for
an alleged neglect of duty, or so plainly ap
pealed to class interests and prejudices in
support of a pet policy.
The business parts of the message are bet
ter. The reports of the various heads of de
partments, are summarized in the usual man
ner, and some recommendations made in
regard to legislation which, under other cir
cumstances, might be deserving of careful
consideration. It is doubtful, however, if
the present Congress, in the short time at its
disposal, can give any of them proper atten
tion, and the next one will take its sugges
tions from another source.
The argument against using the surplus
for the purchase and retirement of govern
ment bonds is ridiculous. The President
says the money, if left in the hands of the
people, would have been "worth in their bus
iness at least G per cent per annum," there
fore it was a great loss to use it in the pur
chase of bonds at a saving of 2 per cent But
the money was not left in the hands of the
people. It is in the treasury, and the ques
tion is what to do with it. The President's
argument might be good against creating a
surplus, but as against the disposition of an
existing surplus it is absurd. It is a condi
tion that confronts us, not a theory.
SOUTHERN REPUBLICANS.
General James Longstreot, of Georgia, who
is spending a day or two in the city, was one
of the most distinguished officers of the
Southern army during the late war, and is a
thoroughbred soldier. He graduated at West
Point in the class before General Grant, and
served with great distinction during the
Mexican war. When the civil war came on
he sided with the South, and was appointed
brigadier-general in the confederate army.
He was one of the ablest military men on the
Southern side, and r. hard fighter. The opinion
has been expressed by military critics on both
sides that if General Lee had taken his advice
at Gettysburg the result of that great and
crucial battle might have been different.
General Longstreet fought as long as there
was fighting ground to stand on, was a mem
ber of the last council of war Lld by Lee in
the woods on the night of April 8, 18Go, and
literally covered the retreat of the Confederacy
from Richmond. At the conclusion of the
war he was one of the first to accept the situa
tion and the terms of amnesty proffered by
the government Nothing in General
Longstreet's career was more honor
able than his prompt acceptance of
the situation after Lee's surrender and his
earnest efforts to bring about cordial peace.
Very soon after the close of the war he an
nounced himself as a Republican and has
acted with that party ever since. Though
this has cost him severe criticism from many
of his personal friends in the South and
former comrades in arms.no one has ever
questioned the sincerity or patriotism of his
motives, nor has he ever doubted that the
true interests and welfare of the South lay in
a complete recognition of the authority of
the government and a cordial acceptance of
the principles of the Republican party.
Accompanying General Longstreet are
Hon. E. A. Angier and his brother, native
Georgians, bora and bred Democrats, but
now outspoken Republicans. They are them
selves good witnesses that the Bourbon regime
in the South is losing its grip and that polit
ical liberty and progress are beginning
to assert themselves. The native white
Republicans of the South to-day are
thu pioneers of its future. That section, with
its great natural attractions and material ro
sources cannot much longer be kept facing to
the rear, brooding over an unprofitable past
and forever furnishing grist to the mills of
Bourbon leaders and schemers. Thousands
of intelligent, progressive men in the South,
native and to tha manor born, are getting
their eyes opened to the fact that its real in
terests lie in the future instead of the past,
and that the way to reach them is to join the
march of progress instead of obstructing it.
The recent election showed that there are
enough of these in every Southern State to
form the nucleus of a strong and respectable
party organization, and when it is formed the
solid South will be broken all along the line,
as it is now in places, and the everlasting
Southern question will be solved.
The Russian novelist, Tolstoi, has been inter
viewed on literary topics, and praises a cumber
of French aod English writers of fiction, bat
has never a word for our own Howells. Con
sidering the panegyrics bestowed on the Russian
by the American apostle of realism, this is
sheer ingratitude.
For once the gossips seem to be tight. They
said the Clevelands would go to a foreign coun
try after the 4th of March, and now the report
is that they will live in New Jersey.

ISAIAH V. WILLIAMSON.
I17o ante $12.O0O.O)O to EtahUh an Industrial School
Or liiKJU
A board of trustees, consisting of seven lead
ing men of Philadelphia, have begun work in
the direction of establishing a great industrial
school for boys. Their action is ia pursuance
of the intention, made by Isaiah V. Williamson,
of devoting twelve million dollars for the object
stated. We understand that the advantages of
this notable act of philanthropy will be open to
white and colored boys alike.
Mr. Williamson is a bachelor in his eighty-
sixth year. He was born the son of a poor
farmer, at Tenn's Manor, Bucks county,
Pennsylvania. When he was twelve years old
he was engaged at a country store. Fordingham,
Bucks county. He had been to school a little,
but his earlier years had been characterized by
toil and privation. After nine years of service
at the storo he went to Philadelphia, where he
was engaged by a dry goods house. He learned
the business thoroughly while filling this
engagement, which lasted several years, and
then went into business for himself. Being a
prosperous man, be was considered a good
catch by marriageable girls, one of whom, in the
year 1S37, planned to inveigle him into mar
riage. The plan miscarried, and Mr. Williamsoo
has fought shy of the fair sex ever since. He
continued to make money and to make a
charitable use of it. II i3 benefactions have
been made very wisely, in gifts for educational
purposes, to hospitals and benevolent societies,
and to the worthy poor, maoy of whom have
cot known frOn whom relief, the more welcome
because unexneted, has come, lhe extent of
his bounties uptto the present time is unknown
excepting to himself. Now he crowns tho
V)ntifnl 1ifif. nf n. nnhtn IiFa with thn im
propriation of twelve million dollars, out of his
fortune of twenty millions, to an object which
every good citizen must commend.
The Presidential Succession.
Philadelphia Tress.
Congress has never made provision for the
presidential succession in esse of the death of
both the President and Vice-president-elect
When the new presidential succession law was
pending in the Forty-ninth Congress, attention
was called to the failure of the bill to provide for
all possible contingencies in the presidential
succession, and though the' defect was admitted
by the friends of the bill it was not cured.
Should General Harrison and Mr. Morton, or
either of them be taken away by death on or
before the second Monday in January, the day
appointed for the meeting of the Llectoral Col
lege, the Republican majority of the electors
would be free to choose some other Republicans
to fill the places left vacant The Democratic
presidential electors chosen in 1872, under an
Implied pledge to vote for Horace Greeley for
President, being released from this pledge by
his death, distributed their votes among half a
dozen candidates, except that seventeen electors
mora faithful than intelligent insisted on cast
iug thtdr ballots for their party candidate.
These last were rejected by Congress on the
ground that votes for a dead man aro not ad
missible.
The Democratic I Jo o tile.
Logansport Journal.
Col. C. C. Matson, the defeated Democratic
candidate for Governor, said recently to a cor
respondent of the New lork World, that he
was defeated by boodle. He admitted that the
"Democrats had money as well as the Repub
licans, but we didn't know how to use it as the
Republicans did." The fact that campaign
money was scarce in the Republican party in
tbis State is well known to all who had any
connection with the recent campaign, and the
eorrupt use of such money has cot been traced
to proof ii a single case. On the other hand
Colonel Matson's admission proves that the
Democrats had a large campaign fund. Isoton-
ously a part of it was used in holding the votes
of members of that party, and it has been re
peatedly charged that another large part was
"put up and lost in bets on the result of the
election, by men who were selected to use it in
handling "blocks of five." It was a clear case
of "dog eat dog."
Colored Boys Not to lie Excluded.
ThilAdolphia Times.
The first published outline of the plan of I. V.
Williamson's munificent charity stated that it
was his design to accommodate soveral hundred
white boys and instruct them in some usefnl
mechanical trade. Sir. Gowen, who drew the
necessary legal papers, and 31r. lownsend, one
of the trustees, say not only that discrimination
against the colored race is not in the deed of
gift, but Mr. Gowea broadly acquits Mr. Will
iamson of ever contemplating "any distinction
of color, race or creel in the admission of schol
ars to the institution."

jftwl&l to tb ImJianavoils JTirntu.
Washington, Dec 3. The contest over the
speakership of the Fifty-first Congress opened
ia earnest to-day. Major McKinley was on the
floor before the Hoase was called to order, and.
when asked as to his position, admitted that be
would not decline the honor if it should be ten
dered him. This makes it certain that there
will be at least fonr candidates ia the field, and
they are all present and aetire. Mr. Barrows
has been exceptionally industrious, and has se
cured the support of sereral of the members
from Xew.York State. Among these, Repre
sentative Baker, of the Rochester district, takes
the lead. Mr. Baker buttonholes his colleagues
as fast as they appear, and talks eloquently for
Burrows. He has succeeded in securing semi
promises from several others of the Empire
State delegation that they will vote for the
Michigan man. McKinley and Cannon have
been very much amused over the circulation
of a report by the friends cf Burrows,
to the effect that they (McKinley and
Cannon) are not physically strong enough to
bear the burden of the Speaker's duties. They
dissent most strenuously from this opinion, and
claim they are fully as vigorous as Mr. Burrows.
At the' present writing it is difficult to judge
who has the best of the race so far. Mr. Reed
will have many supporters among the older
members, and nearly all the jounger men,' who
are cot tied to Cannon or Burrows, are heartily
in favor of Major McKinley, and there can be
no doubt that he will prove to be a most formi
dable candidate for the others to cope with.
The canvass will progress with considerable
vigor from this time forward, as the impression
seems to be growing that nothing will be done
with the tariff or internal-revenue laws at this
session, and, as a consequence, it will be neces
sary for the new President to call an extra ses
sion of Congress shortly after his inauguration
on the 4th of March.
AMONG THE MEMBERS.
Nothing of Special Interest in the Opening
of the Session Reading; the Message.
fpecl&l to tne Indianasolis Journal.
Washington, Dec 3. There was nothing of
special interest in the reconvening of Congress
in either branch. The galleries were crowded,
there were universal greetings and much good
humor was everywhere shown. It was observed
that the Democrats had nearly all of the many
baskets of flowers and floral decorations of vari
ous forms on their desks. Before the large and
beautiful floral offering was placed upon the
desk of Mr. Ingalls, the presiding officer of the
Senate, a Senator condoled with him because
be appeared to have been overlooked by his
friends, when he observed: "The Republicans
are not dead, and they need no flowers.''
Another Senator observed that the profu
sion of flowers on the Democratic side
was on account of the death of the Democratic
party. Only a few Senators listened to the
reading of the Presidents message. Soon after
the Secretary began the reading, which occupied
a little over an hour, Don Cameron walked over
on the Democratic side, sat down between Sena
tors Vest and Gorman, and the trio, for nearly an -
hour, told stories and laughed so heartily at
times that the reading could scarcely bs heard.
Mr. Payne was the only man on the Demoeratie
Blue iab ftppeareu tu ueien iu ms cmixo reou-
ing of the message or any considerable part of
it Mr. Sherman held a printed copy of the
document in his hsnd and closely followed the
reading by the Secretary. He evidently an
alyzed the message as rapidly as it could be
read. Mr. Morrill, who occupies the same po
sition in the hearts of the Senators as Judge
Kelley, the "father of the House, does in
the lower branch of Congress, put his left
elbow on the arm of his chair, rested
hts head in the hollow of his hand,
and looked the Secretary intently in the
face from the beginning to the end of the read
ing. The venerable Senator from Vermont is
the chairman of the committee on finance, and
seemed to be amused as well as interested in
the reaffimation of the President's views in
favor of free trade, which principles were so
overwhelmingly defeated at the polls last month.
Mr. Stewart, the silver king of Nevada, turned
his chair so that his back was toward the Secre
tary of the Senate, and read the copy he bad of
the message silently and alone. General Haw
ley and Mr. Frye listened throughout the read
ing. There was very little attention given by
any other Senator.
In the House Mr. Mills turned his profile to
the Clerk while the message was beiag read,
and with his feet noon a chair at an adjoining
dsk, listened intently, but did not join in any
of the demonstrations of approval or disap
proval. The Speaker paid very little attention
to the reading of the document, he evidently
having read it before.
.Indiana's Delegation In the House.
Special1 to the Indianapolis Journal.
Washington, Dec 3. Evidently the election
last month has "set in" on the Democratic mem
bers from Indiana, for their "only" Holman,
and Howard, of the entiro six, were present
when tht House convened to-day. Many in
quiries were heard ,for Colonel Matson, but he
was not to be seen. His successful opponent
for the governorship, General Hovey, was at his
desk ajtout three minutes before the House was
called to order, aod he was given one of the
heartiest receptions ever tendered any man.
Democrats, like Republicans, flocked to him and
congratulated hira with a sincerity and warmth
which was, indeid, gratifying. The General is
receiving the honors conferred upon him with
becoming modesty and grace, and all of his
friends in the House are proud of the manner in
which he bears his victory. A few minutes
after the House convened a floral offering from
the Indiana RepubHt&ns in Washington was
plaeed upon his desk. It was in the form of a
horse-shoe, was about three and a half feet Inch
by two feet at its greatest width, and was made
of roses and ferns. Gene ral Browne was also
the recipient of warm congratulations over his
recovery from his recent i?lness and his re elec
tion by a largely increased majority. Mr.
Johnston was in his seat aod received a warm
welcome. There was universal regret expressed
over his defeat. Messrs. Cheadle, Owen and
Steele had not : arrited whsn the Houie con
vened. There were many inquiries for Mr. By
num, but nothing of his whereabouts was known
among his colleagues.
THE HENET CIKCtXAU.
Frospect That the ItenpotilbiIlty for Its
Authorship Will Uo Eocaled.
tocrtil to the lndun&oolif Jonrnak
Washington, Dec 3. Around Congress to
day there were many conjectures as to what
answer will be made by the Secretary tf War to
Senator Hale's resolution, adopted last October,
calling for an explanation of the issuance of the
notorious Benet circular letter, directing the re
moval of women and 'children in the arsenal
and armories, to "make room for Democrats.
General Beuet told the correspondent of the
Journal that the circular was issutd
cpou the direction or at tbe . sug
gestion of Secretary Endicott, but ho
stated, subsequently, in order to extricate the
Secretary from the hole in which he had
placed him, that he (Benet) was alone reponsi
ble for the order, and that he conceived it him
self. Tbe latter explanation was made, of
course, for the purpose of relieving the adrnin
tration of the odium which the responsibility
would cast upon it. Now there will be no ne
cessity for shielding the administration, and
Benet, itls said, feels like vindicating himself
in order that he may cot be In bal repcte with
the new administration. Some ecrioity is ex
pressed as to whether Endicott o? Benet will
assume the responsibility.
THE DIRECT-TAX BILL.
Its Flonl Disposition in Doubt The Attitude)
of Mr. Oatcs.
Washington, Dec 3. It is still an open
question whst will be done with the direct-tax
bill, over which the famous filibustering oc
curred last spring. The Republican menbers
will await action by the committee on rules be
fore taking any steps to call it up, but it is prob
able they will have to t&ke the initiative. It was
learned from Speaker Carlisle to-dsy that he
considers the situation just the same as it was
at the close of tbe session in October, which
means that the committee on rules will take no
action. Mr. Mills said that he had no idea that
anything would be done. 3Ir. Randall gave the
Speaker notice that he would attend any meet
ing of the committee.
Mr. Cannon, one of the Republican members
of the committee on rules, said he would ask for
a meeting Wednesday or Thursday, audit he
does, one may be held. It is tbe expectation,
now, however, that the Democrats will main
tain the same position that they held at the first
session upon this and other questions.
CoL W. C Oates, of Alabama, leader of the
filibustered against the direct-tax bill last ses
sion, was eeen by an Associated Press reporter,
to whom he explained his position on the mat
ter. Said he: "My position is just this: if the
committee on rule, or any members of the can-
cus who abides by its dictum, asks consideration
for the bill I shall vote to carry out tbe terms
of the. caucus agreement, but if any Republican
or any Democrat, who w.n not in the caucus, or
any one who refuses to be bound by its action,
endeavors to call it up 1 shall object. The
friends of the measure must get it before the
House under the terms of the caucus compact;
tbey cannot get it up any otber way. I do not
believe that the committee on rales will
report an order for consideration of tbe bill, be
cause, when Mr. Randall, in furtherance of the
caucus action, endeavored to have the Hoase
make tbe order, Mr. Reed twice objected to ihn
introduction of the resolution, aod it wns cos
received. That is the reason why the bill is not,
by order of the House, ready to come up wlth
ont further action."
Mr. Springer will make an effort, to-morrow,
to call up the Oklahoma bill. It is said he was
very desirous that President Cleveland shonll
mention tbe measure in b'3 message, and urged
it on the executive, but unsuccessfully. The
bill is the special order for Friday, but Mr.
Springer wants to get it oui of the way before
the direct-tax bill fight which is cow expected
to be precipitated upon the House.
THE FIFTIETH CONGRESS.
An Unusually Full Attendance at the Opening?
of the Second Session.
Washington, Dec 3. It was an unusually
full Senate that responded to President (pro
tern. ) Ingalls s call to order at 12 o'clock to day.
At that time all the galleries were full except
the President's aod the diplomatic departments,
the latter containing only one of the under sec
retaries of the Austrian legation and three lady
friends. The desk of the presiding officer was
deoorated by a very handsome pyramid bouquet,
and Senators Blodgett, Daniels, Pugb, Voorhees
and Beck had before them nature's emblems of
the esteem of friends. Not a flower bloomed on
the Republican side of the chamber. As the
minute-hands overtook the hour indicator on
the dial of the clock facing him, Mr. Ingalls
let fall the , gavel, and Chaplain
Butler opened the proceedings with
prayer. He returned thanks . for
the bountiful blessings vouchsafed for the
land in its material interests, and remembered
President-elect Harrison in his petition. One of
the Senators, woo could cot be distinguished in
the throng, joined with the cbspiain in repeat
ing the Lord's prayer at the close.
A few oiomenrs were spent In greetings among
the Senators, and then Senator Sherman offered
the usual resolution that the Secretary notify
the House that the Senate is ready to proceed
to business. The resolution was adopted, as was
also one offered by Mr. Morrill, for tbe appoint
ment of a committee to notify the President
that the Senate is ready to receive any com
munication he mav have to make. Messrs.
Morrill and Saulsbury composed this committee.
Mr. Cameron offered a resolution that tbe
Senate meet daily, until further ordered, at 12
m. Adopted.
At 12:47, on motion of Mr. Sherman, the Sen
ate took a recess for half an hour.
At the conclusion of the recess, the usual mes
sage from the House, anneuccing the facts of its
being in session, and of its bavin r appointed a
eommittee to wait upon tbe Ppresideni, was de
livered, it having been delayed in consequence
of tbe recess. This was followed by a report
from the committee to wait on the
President. to the effect that it bad
performed that duty, and that the Presi
dent would commnnicste in writing immediate
ly, and then the President's message was deliv
ered by Mr. Pruden, one of bis sec
retaries, and Mr. McCook, the Sec
retary of the Senate, proceeded to read it
The reading of the message occupied an hour
and twenty minutes. The portions of it which
discuss the question of tariff revision, treasury
surplus, fisheries troubles, and the West inci
dent were listened to very closely aod with ap
parent interest by fourteen Republican Sena
tors and about an equal number of Democrats.
The other portions of the message seemed to
have but few attentive listeners, and tbe read
ing had the effect of gradually clearing the gal
leries of the numerous spectators. When the
reading was finished the message was, on mo
tion of Mr. Hoar, laid on the table and ordered
to be printed. Mr. Hoar then said that he was
about to move an adjournment, but he thought
it would be convenient for tbe Senate to learn
from gentlemen having various measures in
charge what was likely to be tbe order of busi
ness for to morrow.
The presiding officer Mr. Ingalls said that
the unfinished busiuess was the bill to reduce
taxatiou (the tariff).
Mr. Hoar At what hour will that bill be in
order to-morrow! f
The Presiding Officer Two o'clock.
Mr. Frye I give notice that I shall call up for
consideration with the consent of the Senate
the bill for the settlement with the Union
Pacific Railway Company, to-morrow morning,
immediately after the routine business of the
morning is completed. That bill was made a
special order for to-morrow.
The Presiding Officer At 2 o'clock.
Mr. Frye Then as the financial bill, or the
tariff bill is, I understand, to be taken up to
morrow, I will move, immediately rfter the
routine morning business, that the Union Pa
cific bill be taken up for consideration.
Mr. Chandler I desire to give notice that, as
soon as practicable, I will ask tbe Senate to take
up and dispose of the resolution for the investi
gation of tbe election in Louisiana in April last.
I am not informed by the senior Senator from
Louisiana Mr. Gibson whether or cot there
will be any objection to the passage of that res
olution. He was cot present when the resolu
tion was taken up on tbe last occasion; but I
suspect there will be na objection to its adop
tion, nod therefore I will cot take up the time
the Senate. I
Mr. Gibson The senior Senator from Louis
iana hai strenuously objected to the adoption
of tbat resolution, and will continue to do so.
Mr. Cbsndler This Is the first time that the
Senator has so informed the Senate.
Mr. Allison I desire to soy, at this time, ia
connection with thoNunfinished business, that,
to-morrow, at 2 o'clock. I expect to a' the
Senate to go on with tbat order. In view of the
notice given by tbe Senator from Maine Mr.
Frye, I think I ought say that if tbe considera
tion of this bill shall be protracted beyond a
day or two, I shall ak the Senate, later or.;
to consider the tariff bill during the morning
hour. Adjourned.
Proceedings f the House.
Washington, Dec. 3. Long before the meet
ing ot the second session of the Fiftieth Con
gress, the galleries of the House, with the ex
ception of those galleries reserved for the Presi
dent and his friends and for the oiplomatia
corps, were filled with spectators, and the
bright dresses of tbe ladies formed a brilliant
frame to the picture presented on
the floor below. Tfcere, band-shaking
was indulged and congratulations on re election
or condolences on defeat were exchanged among
the members.
Of courie, the recent election was the chief
topic of conversation, but there was no bitter
feeling manifested, jocose raillery on the partot
the Republicans and patient resignation on the
tartot tie Democrat being everywhere evi
dent. Tbe Republ'can members who are promi
nently mentioned in connection with the speak
ership of the Fifty-first Congress came In for
