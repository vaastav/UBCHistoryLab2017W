To-Day!
To-day the second session of the 30th
Congress tonvenes and to-day the Presi
dent wilt submit to It his annual message,
wherein, in obedience to the mandate of
the Constitution, be will "give to the Con
gress information of the state of the
Union, and recommend to their considera
tion such measures as he shall judge nec
essary and expedient."
Humiliating It Is, that the majority of
Congress convenes In a temper and frame
of mind that will cause It to pay no heed
to the President's recommendation of "such
measures as he shall judge necessary and
expedient" One year ago, In his annual
message, written., la language the most
courteous and deferential, he called the at'
tentloo of Congress to the fact that the
.Union bad been maintained by the Feder
al arms, so far as It was in the power of
military force, to maintain it; that Us
maintenance brought with it 'the support
of the State Governments in all their
rights;" that It had been his "stead fast ob
ject to escape from the sway of momenta
ry passions, and to devise a healing policy
from the fundamental and unchanging
principles of the Constitution;" that be
had "found the States suffering from the
' effects of civil War ;f that "resistance ' to
the General Government appeared to have,
exhausted itself;" that "the United States
had recovered possession of their forts and
srsenalaj and their armies were In the o'cett
pa
to
.. . . . ' i
pationoi every state wnicn nau attempted
secede;" that whether , the territory
within the limits bf those States should be
held as conquered territory, under military
authority emanating from the Presidents
the head of the army, was the first question
, that presented Itself for decision." Proper
reflection conylnced him that "military
governments, established for an indefinite
period, would have offered no security for
the early suppression of discontent, "would
hive divided the people into the vanquish
era and the vanquished,, and would have
envenomed hatred rather than have restored
affection," which "once established, no pre
else limit to their continuance wasconcelv
able;" that "they would have occasioned an
incalculable and exhausting expense;" that
"peaceful emigration to and from that por
tion of the country is one of the best means
that can be thought of for the restoration
of harmony, and that emigration ' would
have been prevented ; for what emigrant
from abroad what industrious citizen , at
home would place himself willingly Jin
der military rule f that "the chief persons
who would have followed in the train of
the army would have been dependents on
the General Government, or men who ex
pected profit from the miseries of their er
ring fellow-citizens;" that, "besides, the
policy of military rule over a conquered
territory would have implied that the States
whose Inhabitants may have taken part In
the rebellion had, by the act of those In
habitants, ceased to exist;" that he had
"gradually and quietly, by almost imper
ceptible steps, sought to restore the right
ful energy of the General Government of
the States. . To that end provisional Gov
ernors had been appointed for the States,
Conventions called, Governors elected, Leg
islatures assembled, and Senators and Rep
resentatlves chosen to the Congress of the
United States."
He knew that "this policy" was "attend
ed with some risk ;" that for Its success It
required at least the concurrence of the
States which it concerned ; that It Implied
"an invitation to those States, by renewing
their allegiance to the United States, to re.
sume their functions as States in , the
Union." To the end that the "risk" should
not be an unfortunate one, he had felt it in.
eumbent on blm to exercise one other pow
er confided to blm by the "General Govern
ment the power of pardon;" that "as no
State can throw a defense over the crime of
treason, the power of pardon Is exclusively
TMted h Executive Government of the
l-niiea oiaies." iuo next siep ue
ok 'to! restore the ConsUtutional
relations of the States was to Invite "them
fi r Ffilna tai In rliA rtl rrfi rifflnl nt minl I
to participate In the high office of amend
ing the Constitution, In so far as it provided
for the total and continual abolition of sla
very," and he thought In return for the
adoption ot this amendment " a general
amnesty" should be exchanged. He had
cherished the belief that "the adoption of
the amendment" would reunite "us all be
yond all power of disruption." After the
adoption of this amendment only one thing
more. In his judgment, was needed to
"completely the work of restoration," and
wU for Mtho gtateg) whose powert
have been so long in abeyance, to resume
their places in the two branches of the Na
tional Legislature." .
Instead of the last Congress regarding
what the President had sq well done In the
grand work of restoration, they treated It
with contempt and spat upon It. They pre-
vented complete restoration by denying
"the States, whose powers had been so
long in abeyance, to resume their place in
the two branches of the National Legisla
ture." . And to-day Congress meets ani
mated by a determination to indefinitely
put off the completion of restoration. The
line of policy the President pursued has
worked marvelously well. While it
might have been looked upon one
year ago doubtfully, to-day Its wisdom
must stand confessed. The President's
risk "bis putting to one. side the idea of
ruling the South by the military arm, or
through a territorial conditionbas resulted
most fortunately for the good of the country.
Had Congress united with the President
one year ago In taking the " risk " to finijr
up restoration by allowing the Southern
States to resume their constitutional right
representation, to-day the country would
be in a far better condition than it Is,
There would not be In business that depres
sion that there now is. If Congress and
the President shall not start out to-day
with a, determination of finishing up the
work of restoration without any more
ado without insisting upon the adoption
any more amendments to the Constitu
tlon the probabilities are that distress In
business will Increase Instead of diminish.
To-day, therefore, every Interest In the
country demands that the Southern States
should be permitted Immediately to resume
their co-equality in the Union.

Masonic Fraternity—An Act of Justice.
At the sacking and burning of the city
of Atlanta, Georgia, after it had fallen into
the hands of Sherman's victorious army,
the Masonic LodgeNo. 69 was entered by
some of our soldiers, and the Bible and
jewels belonging to the Lodge Were taken
away. The Bible feu Into the hands of a
soldier who was not a Mason, and was sent
by' him to Mr. W. S. Newman, of Toledo
Lodge, No. 144. Mr. Newman presented It
the Grand Lodge of the State of Ohio,
with a request that it be returned to the
Atlanta Lodge. We saw the Bible yes
terday, in the hands of Thomas Sparrow,
Esq., Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of
the State of Ohio, who was about sending
by Adams Express, to Mr. John Harris
Master of Atlanta Lodge, by whom it will
returned to the sacred keeping of Its
original owners. This is but a simple act

which exists among the members of the
