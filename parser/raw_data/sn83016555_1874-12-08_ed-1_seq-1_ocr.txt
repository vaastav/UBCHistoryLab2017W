The Presidrnl'c Aleinrge.
The Annual tnesftage of the President to
Congress was read to that body yesterday
and is published all over the country this
morning. In it are discussed the principal
topic* of interest to the people of the
IJaited States with the wisdom of a states
man and the. interest of a patriot.
Commenciti* with the general condition
of the country, the prostration of onr
financial affairs compared with the abun
dance of labor and capital is noted. The
view* ot the President on this subject will
generally be considered sound. The ne
cessity for the creation of our debt is ac
knowledged, but the equal necessity for a
currency *'good wherever civilization
reigns," and the imperative demand that
there ehould be no delay in returning to
specie basis earnestly advocated. There
must be positive action to redeem our
pledgee to commerce. The principal meas
ures suggested for a return to prosperity,
are a repeal ol the legal tender clause, a cer
tainty of an excess ot revenue over ex
penditures, and iu time a return to a free
banking system. Expansion the President
does not consider honest, and with great
force compares it to the issuing of legal
tender by every debtor to the extent of
his obligations. Th«*se are measures which
it is the duty of Congress to take, and
not his.
Our relatione to foreign countries are in
general satisfactory. Action ie recom
mended on the conditions of the Belgian
convention that < qual advantages may be
doriged by the United States. The use of
the indemnity paid by Japan is tecom
mended for (he education of American* in
the Japanese language, with the obligation
to serve the government aa interpreters.
An assurance ie given that the Formosan
difficulty will be adjusted. In the matter
of Chinese immigrants legislation Is re
commended that the terrible abases, espe
cially as regards Chinese women, may be
removed. A special court is recommended
to hear the claim» of aliens who suffered
daring the late civil war, and is no doubt a
necessity. The difficulty with Newfound
land and the boundary from the Lake of
the Woods to the Bocky mountains between
the United States and the possessions of
Great Britain are Adjusted. By a treaty
with Turkey citizens of the United States
are to be permitted to hold real estate in
that country.
In c« mmentieg on the continued and
obstinate war in Cuba nml our unsatisfac
tory relations with Spain, the message is
suggestive of action on the part of Congress
which Will be satisfactory to the country
Further legislation is recommended in
regard to expatriation, and th» determina
tion of tho status of tusuy persons whose
claims to the protection of the United
Srates frequently give rise to embarrass
frauds in naturalization is referred to, but
without special notice of cases familiar to
the country and especially to Louisiana.
Some regulations to enforce compliance with
tho laws on this subject and punish viola
tions are absolutely needed. It is reason
able to suppose that the mind ot the
President was somewhat influenced by
the heated disemsion on tho jurisdie,
tinn of the Second District Conrt
and that be has carefully examined
the case on both sides. When the
question was first made public in October
the minds ot the people of New Orleans
were too much exoited to consider it
calmly. The carefully digested opinion of
Attorney General Field provoked a storm
of indignation from those who deemed
themselves affected by it. Now that it
hat ceased to be n matter of immédiat*
interest, the arguments of the message
will have their foil force. Whether hon
estly or noth (he alien who sought citizen
ship through that court, the protection
and privileges he desires to obtain by it
are too important to him to have them
depend simply on the popular opinion of
a very small portion of the country. All
will look anxiously for the action ot Con
gres#, that no further technicality may jeop
ardise the rights he seeks.
The President cordially indorses the re
port of the Secretary ot the Treasury, and
in view of the fact that the estimated re
ceipts will ontyexceed expenditures by about
f9.000,000, recommends that provision be
made to increase the revenues to comply
with the law by providing for the sinking
fund of $30,000,000. Reforms in the bank
ing and currency acts, an increase of
tariff aud a docroase of article# taxed, en
eouragement of home manufactures and
harmony of labor and capital afe recom
mended. The condition ot tho navy is
most satisfactory, though reforms are sug
gested in the army. The advances of
scieneo in aid of commerce are carefully
noted, such as the hydrographic surveys,
♦he isthmus explorations and the observa
tion of the transit ot Venus.
A decided opinion i# expressed In favor
of an eduoational qualification for tbo ex
ercise of the electoral irauchise and the fur
ther increase of postal facilities, both being
deemed of the greatest importance to the
welfare of the people. The international
postal treaties and conventions are briefly
referred to.
In presenting the Louisiana case the mes
sage details the v eall of Governor Kellogg
for aid to suppress domestio violence; the
proclamation of Penn and seizure of the
State House; the steps taken to support the
existing and recognized State government,
and the practical abandonment of the in
surrection in five days. There fan be no
mistake as to the position of the President.
Besides tho recognition of the existing gov
ernment by himself and Congress, he ex
pressly says he believes it received a ma
jority ef the vote*. Nor can there be any
doubt of his belief in the loreo of the fif
teenth amendment, and the laws
passed to enforce it. "To take ear»
that the laws be enforced" he pre
vented the government from being
overthrown by an "armed mob;" and ii
Congress takes no action will continue to
recognize it, and prevent men, masked
and armed," from committing murders, to
spread terror around, or employers from
forcing colored'men to vote as they desire.
A recommendation ef a committee of in
vestigatioa concludes th* remark# o» tbié
State.
In regard to Arkansas, the troobl* Is de
tailed, and the reason for noû-interferenee,
that her affairs were already before Con
gress, given. The subject of executive in
terference receives attention, and the re.
l«oto£*e *f President Grant t* «a* th*
ment. In this connection the frequency ofj
fr.nii. in n.fiir.Ii.iiimi i« tnfpm-d ♦». but
power given him is shown in his request to
Congress and the people to devise 4>ther
means to accomplish the purpose. But
while expressing his sympathy -with
tho hardships many States have been com
pelled to endure, he declares hi» inten
tion to enforce with rigor the constitu
tion and the laws.
More judgeships and districts are declared
to be needed, and the Department of the
Interior relieved of some of its duties. The
'peace policy" toward the fndinns has
proved so beneficial that in a tew years the
troubles will have «eased, and the recom
mendation of extending the benefits of the
homestead law to them adopted. Legisla
tion is required to aid some of th* pension
ers ef 1812. The centennial exposition is
commended. The civil service, under the
rules as they now exist, is met with opposi
tion, aud unies# Congress takes some
action the President will abandon the sys
tem, although it will be a aource of mortifi
cation.
The message again urge# on Congress
measures to direct labor into productive
channels and give the country a sound cur
rency. The subjects of cheap transportation
and encouragement of American shipping,
the affairs of the District of Colombia aud
a reference to the boards appointed to sur
vey the mouth of the Mississippi clos« the
message, which, taken altogether, is one of
the ablest ever presented for the considera
tion of Congress and the people.
Th* New City Attorney,
As explained by the Rxi'UBLICaB of Sun
day, Mr. Walsh, the City Attorney appoint
'd by the Governor, took quiet possession
of his office yesterday, witbont opposition
from Mr. Jonas, who was inadvertently
elected by the Council.
The eomments of the other eity journals
are somewhat amusing as no two ot them
are alike. The Timt» details the case of
t o State vs. II. J. Leovy, wheie
the Supreme Court decided io favor
of the appointment of J. B. Beck
with, and expresses no opinion. The Pi»
ayutu talks of the "atrocious law," and the
desire of the city government to disobey it,
and thus obtaiu a City Attorney "truly rep
resenting it» interests." It i», bowtver,
correct in the remark that "the position
Mr. Wal^U holds will render it extremely
difficult for the Council to dispossess him."
That is because he and the Governor fol
lowed the law and the Council disobeyed it.
The Bulletin attempts facetiousness over
the matter, considering an obedience to the
city charter and the tiecisions of the
Supreme Court "manifestly untenable." It
suggest» the office be at once abolished, but,
to be consistent, suppose the Council were
to "abolish" the charter altogether, and
make a new one to suit the BulUtlnt
On taking poeeession of the office Mr
Walsh addressed a note to the Counoq
sti.tiiu? the law* and defining his position- of
stating the law and defining his position, of
which the folio wing is a copx :

There has been for some time trouble
brewing between the taxpayers' a-socia
tion and citiz-ns, and the county officials
Tbe shetifl'was acting without a legal bond
and the board ot supervisors refused to
order a n- w one, though the lime lor pay
ing tbe taxes bad arrived; two or three
otber t.fficiala were under indictment, for
forgery aud ambezziement; and the citizens,
despairing of any relief from paiti-.au
courra, la-t W-xinr.sday held a meeting, and
in a body proi.Oed to tbe courthouse to de
maud the renguation of the sheriff, chan
cery cletk. treasur.r aud coroner. All fled
except Sheriff Crooby. a negro, and be
signed bis resignation.
Go Saturday a curd appeared en the
streets, signed hj Cros*>y, calling on all the
cit Cens ot Warren county. Republicans,
white and black, to come to his aid and
support him iu bis position. Crosby pub
licly and through the papera denied '.he au
thorship of the card; yet this morning

ing on tbe city from six different roads.
Tba alarm waa sounded abont nine o'clock,

Immediately and advanced to meat tbe ne
groes on Baldwin's Ferry Road. Tbe negroes
were met just outside the city on Grove

the firing commenced on both sides.
Tbe negroes retreated about a mile and
again made a stand in the old breastworks,
and in a house, but were soon routed. The
loss in these engagements was one citizeD,
Oliver Brown, killed, and abont twelve or

Baldwin's Ferry road, was captured and
committed to jail. In an interview with a
Herald reporter, Owens said he was or
dered by Sheriff Crosby to come to the city
to-day with all tbe armed men he could get
together. Alexander Stockhouse, from
Newton, one of the captured negroes, says
the order for all tbe negroes to come to
Yicksburg this morning was read in church
on Sunday.
Crosby, who is under guard at the court
house, denies that he gave such orders.
It is reported this evening that the ne
groes are committing depredations in the
country.
The intense excitement that prevailed
this morning has subsided to a great de
gree, yet many citizens are still under
arms, and all tbe roads are picketed.
At a public meeting this evening the fol
lowing was adopted :
Besotted, That while we aro fully satis
fied that peter Crosby has caused armed
negroes to march on the city, and should
therefore be held mainly responsible for all
the blood that Las been shed,_we recoin
mend all good citizens to abstain from in
flicting any personal violence upon him,
and that we use still farther efforts to have
him removed from office in some legal man
ner.
Latest.

lutely certain that Governor Ames and his
Attorney General, George E. Harris, in
cited and advised the invasion ot this city
by the negroes to day. This evidence has
been laid betöre the ablest lawyers of tbe
city, with a view to arresting and bringing
these parties to this eity for trial.
WASHINGTON.
B*preme Conrt Decisions.
Washington, December 7. —In the Su
preme Court the following decisions were
rendered to-day:
Thompson vs. Donaldson et al., claimants
of the steamer Great Republic.—Appeal
from the Circuit Court for the district of
Louisiana. This was a ease of collision on
the Mississippi river, up whioh the steamer
Great Republio and tbe Cleona, a smaller
steamer, were steaming—the latter ahead
and the former behind.
At the time of the areident the Cleona
started across the river, and the Republio.
following in her wake, overtook and collided
with her. The question was whether the
accident was caused by the attempt of the
Cleona to crof s when not far enough ahead
to do so with safety, or whether by the
Republic not keepiug her course or going to
the right when tbe Cleona started to the
ief\
The court below charged the Cleona with
fault, holding that she was not far enough
ahead of tbe faster steamer to warrant her
attempt to cross. Till» court reversed the
decree, coining to the conclusion that the
movement of the Cleona was justified by
the distance sbe was ahead, and that the
Renublic was at fault in not keeping her
eourse when the Cleona tacked. Mr. Jus
tice Davis delivered the opinion.
Iu the ease of tbe Germania and other
Insarane. eorapa des against the steanihoat
Lady P.ke, appeal from the District Court
f r the eastern district ot Wisconsin. In
this case the court below decided that the.
collision ol a barge in tow by the steamer
down the Mississippi with the railroad
bridge, near St. Paul, was occasioned by
unavoidable accident, aöd the decree was
accordingly. The insurance companies up
pealed, ulh'giug unskilllnlnass and ntgii
gence on the part ot tbe officers of the
steamer as the cause of the accident, and
that view is sustained^ here and tbe decree
is reversed. Mr. Justice Clifford delivered
the opinion.

where he |workcd for eighteen days in tho
harvest field, crediting hit employers for
his labor. He then oamo to Missouri and
harvested fourteen duys. at $3 pop day 0
again leaving without his pay. In Bedford
and I.amar, Iowa, he worked thirty two

muscle to the extent ol {fit, $iidaud $43 reo

Harvest over, Welch took the back track
to collect his pay for services rendered,
and yesterday informed a reporter of thw
Gazelle that he had thus far raked in all
