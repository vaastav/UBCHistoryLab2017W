OUR SAVIORS BIRTHDAY

not in one wayor another have a little extra goodwill for some doI
their fellow men on that day A fittla gift to a dear one or at least
an unusually cheerful smile will mark the occasion with all who areI
really human
But after all what a snall thing is this little faint imitation of
Christ which lasts but a moment and reaches only a few feet How
fur from being worthy of the God who gave his life for mankind is
the puny celebration of the average persout How little real love
how little goodwill to mankind there is in the hearts of most of III
And particularly What can be said of men who on this day fall
others put into their mouths the drink that steals away their souls
and go forth full of every spirit that Christ came to fight and subdue
often causing desolation ROll death In place of the goodwill and
blimniug that fits the day f Surely no condemnation can be too deep

for a man who on Christs own day violates the
Let tia lalhur this year set a new mark for the observance of the

POWERS AS DICTATOR
I A number of papers both iu and out of the mountains have been
trying to make out that the result of the recent elections shows that
I Caleb Powera has become a political dictator for the mountains
Till men who write such trash ns that show that they know nothing
I of the mountain people There In no political evil less likely to come
i to the mountains than a boss Powers is loved and respected by
thousands and when he asks for any office be will meet with a ire
I mendous response but the mountain people never bnve and never will
tolerate any man who undertakes to Txploit them Powers attack ou
Golden was natural and expected aud Guldens defeat does not prove I
thnt Powers can run the district but only that a innn who attacked
him will be punished Powers has too much wisdom to attempt the
Impossible especially after the example of Bmdley who lost so
heavily by trying to throw his personal strength to another man No
one need to worry oVer Powers ever being a boss uul < > 8 he moves
