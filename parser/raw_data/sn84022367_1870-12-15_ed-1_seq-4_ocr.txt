Rutland Graded ScUool.
The examination of the musical de
partment ol the Rutland Graded School
District under the charge of Mr. Mietike,
took place yesterday, at the Rutland
Opera House, commencing at tea o'clock
a. ru. The first and second divisions oc
cupied the morning hours. They were
Inspected in reading the scales of C, G,
D, and A Major. They acquitted them
selves well showing plainly what can be
accomplished in training even the young
est pnpil in onr schools in the elements of
vocalizition. Great credit is due to Mr.
Mietzke for his enthusiastic and persistent
efforts to introduce music into the prim
ary departments. He has reason to be
gratified at the eminent success of his
labors, and it seems to be his particular
pride to instruct the younger scholars in
tae art ot music, ins exercises were
closed with gymnastio exercises.
If the afternoon at 3:30 the intermedin
ate and secondary departments were ex
amined in the rudiments of music, read
ing in the scales 0. G. D. A. E. F. B Flat
and E Flat Major. The following choruses
were rendered :
"May Song," written in G Major,
"Modesty Triumphant," " D "
'Change of Seasons," " A "
'Longiog for Spring," " E "
The Three Festivals," ' F "
"The Autumn," " BP"
"How sweet, how heav'nly is the Sight,"
written in E Flat Major.
These exercises also showed the train'
Ing which the pupils had received, and
that good and substantial 'progress had
been made within a year. At the con
clusion the pupils entered npon the stage,
and taking the tier of elevated Boats, went
through with gymnastio exercises, much
to the edifloation of the audience, and
keeping perfeot time.
In the evening a large audience assem
bled at the Opera House to attend the
exhibition and oonoertof the pupils of the
High end Grammar Sohools, which war
carried in aooordance with the following

reference to the various performance?.
The dialogue entitled the "Rehearsal" in
whioh George Merrill, Willie Eddy,
Willie Owen, Frank Haven took part
oansed much amusement, and brought
down the house. The repitition of the
"Sewing Circle" which created so much
merriment on Tuesday afternoon was re
peated greatly to the pleasure of the
audienoe. .The essay by Miss Meldon
wts well written and finely read. The
crowning act of the exhibition was the
recitation of the "Children," a poem by
Charles Dicker s, by Besnio Ripley. Its
recital on this occasion we have never re
membered to have heard excelled. The
full pathos, and sentiment seemed to be
appreciated and understood, and Mies
Bessie exhibits rare power in holding her
' audience spell bound.
After tbo exercises and conoert of yes
terday none of our citizens can doubt the
propriety or expediency of the introduc
tion of mnsio into our public sohools. It
is among the most valuable features of the
schools, end none, we feel sure, would
have it discontinued. If all the school
of the larger towns would introduce mn
sio into their schools under a competent
instructor, they would find it a valuable
acquisition and never regret the move
ment. The system taught is the same as
that of the public schools of Boston, and
Mr. Meitzke has most admirably succeed
cd in Lis efforts to engraft it upon our
school system.

Eating the "Collection." One ef
fect of the dearth of provisions in Paris
has been the closing of a great many
"useless mouths." The beggers, mounte
banks and many others who believed Paris
owed them a living "free gratis for notb
ing,'were removed from the gay capital
ere the seige commenced. Pet dogs have
been destroyed on aceount of tha amount
of food they consumed. The question has
been debated whether or no it is wise to
omtinue feeding the valuable collection
of animals in the Jardin des Flantes. The
meat they consume would keep hundreds
of families ; had the collection better be
destroyed ? This question it appears is
quietly reaching a very conclusive settle
ment. The horned cattle have been gradu
ally dieappearlng from the grounds since
the commencement of the seige. Visitors
have missed the smaller birds and the
tame deer and hares and pheasants, and
at last accounts only a few living eagles
were left, of the onoe large collection of
the feathered tribe. The two young
bears presented by Prinoe Couzi have al
so departed, to feast the stomach instead
of the eye. It is a fight between the "au
thorities" and the '-collection." Hungry
keepers have foraged among the "itre
specimens" until the specimens are "rarer
that ever. Soon there will be nothing left
but a few hungry lions, tough eagles, and
unoonqneratle elephants, and the keep
ers having consumed them, will be the
embodiment of the valuable soologioal
collection af the famous Jardin.

question" at Boston, Sunday night, and
perpetrated the grim joke of repeating it
before the convicts of the State Prison on

oourse is a success. Every seat is occupied
by season ticket-holders, who not only ap
preciate all the good points of a lecture

Accident at Moriah, N. Y. Quite a
serions shooting accident occurred last
Sunday, at the village of Mill Brook, in
the town of Moriah, N. T. A young man
named William Dwyer, attempted
draw a gun loaded with buckshot from
under the steps of the store of E. P. Han
dy, taking hold of the muzzle for that
purpose. The hammer caught discharge
ing the gun, and the charge passed
through the right arm of Dwyer, above
the elbow, and entered the side of the
head of another young man named Wm
Capin. One shot passed through his nose
another entered and put out his eye, and
the remainder entered his skull. Capin
is in a very critical condition. Dwyer's
arm is badly shattered and must probably
be amputated. Both men are reported to
be of steady habits, and much sympathy
is felt for them anion? the citizens of
Moriah.

BY ALICE M. W HIGHER.
How lovely the hills ! each outline dim
Revealed by the setting sun
That gilds their peaks with refulgent gold
"When the day is nearly done;
Majootio and grand ; my beating heart
With a sense of beauty thrills.
But the flickering light is more beautiful far
In the rift between the hills.
Brightly they glow In the morning light,
And tbeir leafy coronal
Flashes back from its dewy gems
The bright sun-rays that fall ;
But they burn and glow in the fierce noon-tide,
While a dreamy stillness fills
The shadows that lie so cool and deep
la the rift between the hills.
More beautiful still are the hills at eve
With llvey radiance crowned,
Anil the bright green tip of each feathery itne
Wooes the breeze in niurmunn sound.
But the light steals softly tbro' arches dim
Far down Irom the summit's gleam
And lovelier far to my watchful eyes
Seems its trembling uncertain beam.
The hills are beautiful well I know.
And I'd love their summits hold
Did they not seem to shut me in,
So firm, to cruel, so cold.
But love will soar o'er the towering peak.
Whose sense of confinement chills ;
The soul may see the light of its home
Thro the rift between the hills.

A better knowledge of Insanity.
It is greatly to be desired that people
in general had a better knowledge of the
facts relative to insanity. The ignorance
on this subject of even quite intelligent
person! is something surprising. The
consequence is serious. I hose who are
mentally diseased are not suspected by
their friends to be so affected, or are not
eared for in a wise and helpful manner
Hence conduct is misunderstood and mis
represented, harsh and false judgments
are expressed, and sid casualties olten
oocur.
It is a common error that real insanity
has but two forms; that an insane person
either must be a raving maniac, openly
striving to do harm to himself and to
others, and needing to be put into a strait
jacket, or to be confined in a room by
himself, or else must be idiotic, and sunk
down into a mere animal. Hence, when
it is reported that any one is suffering
from mental aberration, if he is quiet and
composed, if he manifests sense and judg
ment, if he plant shrewdly and executes
skillfully, the idea, is repelled as absurd.
From similar ignorance, no fear of vio
lence to others or of self-injury is felt, be
cause the person is not excited and fran
tic, but on the contrary is more than
usually inactive and depressed.
Now we claim no professional knowl
edge on this subject but only such an un
derstanding as comes from reading, ob
servation, and the reports of those who
have had muoh experience with the in
sane. What we say, therefore, is in popu
lar and not in scientific form. Speaking
thus popularly we would call attention to
the fact that the oases of frenzy and
idiocy are by no means the most common,
nor are always the most difficult to cure.
Indeed a very violent case sometimes re
recovers rapidly and perfectly while one
of a seemingly mild type lingers unex
pectedly, intermits and returns again,
and finally becomes incurable. Moreover
nothing ta more common than for the
mind to be affected on a single subject,
while it is clear and rational on
all ethers. The pronounoed cases of
this kind are called monomaniacs, and
often exhibit a sudden and marvelous
contrast between tbeir ordinary conversa
tion and their remarks on the subject of
their delusion. A very sensible man, as
one thinks, all at onoe, by some word in
the conversation, is started into the asser
tion that he is Napoleon Bonaparte, or
Jesus Christ! , Yet very many people are
deranged in tbeir judgment on some one
topic or class of topics, without such de
cided oddity. They are simply so weak
ened or so biased as to come always to an
unreasonable conclusion, which others see
not to be warranted by the facts. This is
quite often the case in instances of deep
and seemingly causeless depression on
secular or on religious subjects.
It is also to be remembered that insan
itv mav operate on anv part of the mind
It may disturb the normal balance of the
sensibility, and lead to undue elation or
undue depression. It may unsettle the
reason, so ' that the judgment does not
reach correct conclusions, but deems that
to be wise and right, which others know
to be foolish and wrong. Or it may weaken
and unsettle the will, bo that it is unable
to hold to its decisions, and is governed by
mysterious impulses which urge the vic
tim to strange courses from which he still
feels a degree of revulsion. Thus in 'the
commission of suicide by insane persons,
the act may be from mere frenzy, or from
absnrd reasoning, or from a resistless im
pulse, sudden or permanent. In the lat
ter case the person might see the abstract
sin of tne aet, and yet bo impotent to re
tram from it.
Many do not understand that the lia
bility to suicide is often greatest in eases
of quiet derangement, in which melan
choly is the only symptom. A gentleman
recently told us of his daughter who was
thus depressed, whom he took to an
asylum, when the physician astounded
him by the remark : "She has one of
the most suicidal eyes I have ever seen."
He had not suspected that tendency, yet
in less than three weeks she made an
attempt to drown herself 1 By reason of
.i? i i . t 1 . j t Ai i : . r
mis iac& oi &iiuwicugo ui vun ucouiiaiuioB
of mental derangement those affected are
often kept at borne without proper treat
ment, till the case is incurable, or till they
do harm to themselves or to others. Even
skillful physicians of ordinary practice
will fail to understand the condition of
an insane person, and bence the wisdom
of consulting one who has had special ex
perience in the treatment of such disease.

One of the lareaat and best conducted mono
..i.Mi.hiTinM In the conntrv. so wide
ly and favorably known for tnelr excellent
J,nrir nnra thtir unrcena to the three following
distinguishing characteristics: superiority of
material, artistic execution, auu iuw puves.
The first is Chiefly flue to ineir immrauwytu

ries, and their location on the direct railroad
route westward .from most of the valuable
Granite Quarries of New England, as this im
portant advantage of location over all other
similar establishments is not lost sight of by
tlie proprietor ot tbe Works ; and his patrons
have the lull heneflt thereof in a personal eelec
tion of material from the entire product of the
Quarries. By these eelectlons, customers are
always getting "the cream" of the entire twelve
deposits, whose aggregate stock on hand, from
which choice is made, amounts to at least a
million of dollars.
As under this plan of personally selecting all
the material used, there is and can be no accu
mulation of inferior stock, to be afterwards dis
posed of, parties may always feel assured ol
netting only the very best of etock In tbeir
ninrk. Furthermore, soundness of material is
equally well insured, which is a very Important
consideration, in vol vine, as it does, to ertai
extent, the question of duribllity, which is an
etsenlial requisite to Rood work.
Tee second distinguishing feature of these
works, and which pernapshas most con trlbuteo
tn their renn cation for tuserior work, has been
justly earned by the employ mint of the most
Sauieu artixauo luai ii uo wwi-ntiicw, uu vj
confining the labor of each workman to such
specialty of work as he excelled in.
It mast be apparent to every practical mind
that, let carvers De constantly at carving, lei
terers at lettering, moulding cutters moulding,

through every classification of the labor or a
large and well-ordered manufactory, tne work

erpr cislon and dispatch. In their respective
departments.
It being the determination to sell at the low

ble nroflt- this systematic adaptation of labor.
addea to ineir uxiequtuea lacuuiee ia meeeiev
t.lnn of material, makes inevitable their
Third feature, and enables them to furnish
the very best werk at the lowest possible
prices.
in order to fully meet the demand of the
times, and that the work may add variety and
new attractions to tne several localities in
which It Is erected, the services of the best tal
ent that can be obtained, is emDloved in con
stantly orUinatug fresh and novel designs tor
military ana civic monuments, lomos, nearta
stones, tablets, etc., to which is invited the
critical inspection of parties desiring cemetery
improvements.
The constantly increasing easiness or tne
worts, oi course, is not counnea to any partic
ular locality or Mate, and the several local
dealers witn whom it comes in competition
have no caue of jealousy at tne seeming in
roads UDon tbeir business. For it is a notice
able fact that wherever the work goei it elicits
such an increased intercut in and demand for
good work, as to fui'.y compensate tor any ap-
aretn loss to otner dealers in lucividaai cases,
v the trtneral stimulus given to the traoe:
and it is not possible that tois establishment
will execute more man a minor pomon oi tne
work reo aired throucnout the lan:e and widen
ing field it is being distributed, its products

To this brief announcement of the facilities
and ability of the works, tnere need only be
addtd good and ample evidei.ee oi integrity in
its operations, not only in its monied transac
tions, but in details of mannfactuie with which
tbe customer is ueaaily uutumidar, ana in
which he must to a great extent Oeptnd upon
the faitbfulntss of tbe builder.
Touching this point, perhaps the most satis
factory assurance ttitreot that can be offered
is the Usuoiony of those whose orders have
been already txecnted by these works, tne
deeds of the past being the best guaranty for
the future. Hence, that parties who fivor the
establishment with their urders miy leel as
eured of fair dealing, and of receiving only the

another column, a new extract in each number
of this paper, irom some ol the many aa'.terlng
letters tnat nave been received during the year
or so last past. These will also serve to indi
cate localities where specimens of work may
be inspected.
Moet of thece letters are from customers with
whom there had been no previous acquaint
ance, several being from parlies whom the pro
prietor has never seen, thtir work having been
ordered by letter, and as a matter of coarse no
occasion for compliment beyond a kindly desire
to express a favorable opinion in behalf of the
integrity and superior products of the
