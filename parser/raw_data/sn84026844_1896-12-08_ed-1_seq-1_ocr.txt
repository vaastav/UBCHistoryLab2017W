The argument In favor of such a prop

the Republicans are concerned, they
are pledged to a tariff that will protect

SOME COMMENTS

Sonir CaiiiIIc CrKli'laniit uu till Cuban '
INutttnn,
WASHINGTON* ,\\C., Dec. T.-Com- I
ments in the senate on the* message
were generally fovorable to the tenor of
the message on tho Cuban question,
though thero were some opposing views
expressed. A large number of senators.
Including a majority of the members of
the committee on foreign relations, ex
cused themselves from excpreeslng opin
ions on the ground that they had not
given It careful reading.
Mr. Mitchell, (Republican, Oregon):
'"Tho message seems to leave the Cu
ban situation as he tlnds It, refraining
from Any recommendation as to con
gressional action. The President's qua
si endorsement of the existing tariff act
will scarcely bo acceptable to Ropubli
cans who b?licve In the protective pol
icy."
Mr. Pettlgrew, (Rep. S. 1).): "It I? the
tlr.'t time !:i our History that an execu
tive who Is the representative of u de
feated party ev.-r glorified .is Mr. Cleve
land does in the first paragraph of this
message over the success at the polls o*
his party's opponents."
Mr. Prltchard. (Hep. N. C.): "The onJy
noteworthy part ??f the message was
that devoted to Cuba and 0:1 that ques
tion It reminded me of tae old rhyme:
He w ired in and wired out and left
The public still In doubt.
As to whether the cart that made
The track was coining In or going out.
Mr. Pugli. (I)cm., Ala.): "Th.* message
Is sound on Cub?, eou?ul on tariff and
especially sound on tiusts and monopo
lies."
.Mr. Brlce. (Dem., Ohio): The President
has halndled the questions in as diplo?
inatlc manner ns possible.
Mr. Nelson. (Rep., Mlar..V "It Is -x fhir
statement so far as regritls Cuba."
Senator Chandler, (Rep., X. H.): "Its
treatment of Cuna is elaborate ami
strong 'While not going ns far as I
'.vlshed It. would. It does by Implication
from the last sentences very plainly say
If Spain does not suppress the rebellion
very quickly *the United States will bo
sure to Intervene to secure the Independ
ence of the Island. The most notable
feature In the message Is the omission
to mention the free coinage of silver or
the currency question, except to make
the useless recommendation that the
greenbacks be retired, or not reissued
when they come Into tie treasury. The
brief allusions to the tariff reiterate tho
Cleveland Idea that the amount of the
duty always increase* the cost to that
amount, but his feeble treatment of the
tariff question Is In marked outlast
with the vehement assaults made upon
tho tariff In previous messages.
Senator Tillman. (Dem., S. C.): "It Is
commonplace. After promising not to
go Into details he goes in rather ela
borately. The best tiling about it Is that
It Is the last we will have from that
source, ut lca.it the lait annual mes
sage."
Mr. Morgan: "In the President's re
cital of facts nnd his statement of the
moral duties of the United States to
ward the Cuban belligerents there Is a
response to the sentiment of the peoplo
nnd. I believe, of the senate. In assert
ing t'hat no other nation must interfere
in the affairs of Cuba, there Is the most
decisive and practical declaration of the
Monroe doctrine that has yet been made.
Hut while the pres'-nt government warns
all other natlona the nu*u*:ige calls the
great civil war an Insurrection, and on
this false declaration It Justifies active
aid to Spain In furnishing all kinds of
military munitions, while it refuses our
people the right to send anything,even
bread or medicine, to the insurgents. I
regret that this national action Is ho
Illogical and unjust and that is must
still cost many lives and terrible suffer
ing to a people who are admitted by the
message to be at war for the Fake of I
liberty and not ns a means of gaining
power for personal ends." 1
3Itmlirrinf)lie llomr.'
In Hie house the members also ex
pressed a desire not to be Interviewed.
Mr. Ultt, of Illinois, chairman of the I
commlttteee on foreign affairs, declined
dlplomntlonlly to give any expression |
upon the message. The matter might I
at any time become a subject for the
consideration of his committee and ho
therefore did not think It proper to ex
press nn opinion.
Mr. 11 atwole, (Rep,, Minn.), member
of til" foreign affairs committee, said:
"The President evidently l.-as been Im
pressed with sentiment which lias been
voiced by the people of the country In
regard to Cuba during the congress
ional recess. He seems disposed t.i urge
some action by the 1*tilled States at the
proper time, but falls 10 Indicate when
that time shall aivlve."
Mr. McMillan. (Dein.. Tenn.). mem
ber of the ways and means committee,
said: vi ngre* with the President In
seeing no Immediate necessity or ex
cuse for Increase of tariff duties. The
surpius on hand, outside the gold re
serve, with sirlet economy probably
will meet all dcflcleiwles in revenue
for more than half of Mr. McKlnley's
administration and possibly for the
full four years. To Increase the fax on
tl/? ijecfssarlcs of Jlf" In order either
to squander or purmnhently hoard
this surplus Is wholly Inexcusable."
Mr, Cannon, (Rep., Ills.), chairman of
the committee on appropriations: "The
deficit since the beginning of .Mr.
Cleveland's recent ndmlnlstratKin to
Diveinber fi. ISSfi, Is |178.flK0OO, This

sale of bonds.
"This defl.lt was 12.1,000.000 fur the

the President's confidence that tho pre

tunity will yield a sufllclent revenue, is
not well founded. other words, tin
deficiency in revenues In Increasing and
not diminishing. All of which demon
'trales th" absolute in sslty for reve
nue legislation that will bring Increas
I'd receipts.
"It seems to 1110 to be morally certain
that with such legislation, properly
framed, would conie a permanent re
turn of conlldehee anil that our llnan
elal system would In tho future, as it
did prior to 1RM, take care of llnolf.
"I do not bHleve It Ih practicable to
fund tlwi United Statos treasury notes,
although a provision giving the secre
tary of tho trensury authority tempo
rarily to hold theao notes In the treas
ury?an they tiro placed there In re
demption or received from taxes? would
probably be wise.
"The President Hays we foavo a mir
plun of 912S.1JOO.OOO, which can he de
voted to currcnt expenses. The proceeds
are borrowed money. The baro state
mant of that faot shows tho necessity
for increased revenue; <tnd with reve
nuo equal to expenditure!!, any surplus
In the treasury can be used In payment
of the Interest-bearing debt of the
United States."
Mr. Dolllver, (Hep., Iowa), mernbrr
of the ways and means committee:
"The President's trcntment of the
Cuban question Is hardly satisfactory
either to those who desire to aj?t? Cu
ban . Independence recognized, or the
class who desire the United Stales to
keep clear v<f foreign disputes. Media
tion by the United States would be In
the direction of a settlement honorable
to all partkf.i. but the President's hint
of what h likely to happen In case me
diation be refused Is a little too mys
terious for practical purposes. Tho
President's views on revenue and the
tariff seem to bp taken froin an as
sortment of previous opinions once
current, at least In tho white house and
treasury department."
Mr. Dalzell. (Rep., Pcnna.), member of
the ways nnd means committee: "The
message hi a very fair one In Its treat
ment of routine matters In the depart
ments. It gives 11 u no additional light
on Cuba. The President assumes from
his Information?which la no doubt re
liable?that the Insurgent:) have no
claim to possess a government or a cspl
tol. If this Is true are not entitled
to recognition as belligerents anil It fol
low:* that they certainly could not be
recognized a* possessing Independence.
In hi * treatment of the tariff, the Presi
dent Is a Uttl" unfair In Juggling with
figures. He undt rtakes to compare the
ojH?ration? of the Wilson bill one year
with the name bill another year Instead
of with another bill. He thinks the Wil
son bill is now a higher character than It
was when he refined to sign It. He
seems to fear that th" country may have
too much revenue and become extrava
gant: a fear in which the people will not
Join him."
, Representative Livingston. (Dem.,
Ga.): "The President has made a full
and unquestionable showing In hi* mes
I ?ugc of the necessity for our interfer
' ence in Cuba now. The message will
not be endorsed by this American peo
! ?Its tone Is too foreign."
IGNORANT COMMENTS
Of Englltlt Paprri on ihr JltMngr?The
| London Tlmr* Matin lUrlf Ittdtruton?.
j LONDON. Dec. 7.?All the newspapers
I thjs morning have editorials on Prcsi
: dent Cleveland's message. Most of
| them regord tho meaage as one of rather
j minor Importance, cxcept so fur as It
concerns the Cuban question, to which
I phase the bulk of the comment Is de
I voted.
! The Dally News, the Liberal organ,
j says of tli" Cuban portion of the mcs
j sage: "President Cleveland's argument
Is clear enough that no country possess
es the, rlgjujjo foster a i??rpetual sourco
of trouble. and* Hint Spain must either
grant autonomy or sell. Spain, how
ever. will probably refuse to do anything
of the kind. Europe being very sensi
tive Just now on the subject of the Mon^.
roe doctrine, Spain will probably be"
lntluentlnlly supported If she holds out.
We hope she will not prevail because
autonomy la best for Cuba and best for
Spain."
The editorial in tho Times says: "The
tone and spirit of the message are
worthy of all praise. It Is a pity that
the moderation nnd balance of mind i
which Mr. Cleveland has Just displayed ;
were not more conspicuous Inst year
when ho startled two continents by a
menace of war. If the Venezuelan
question had been handled as Mr. Clove
land now hnndles the Cuban question,
he inlsht have averted the disruption of
the Democracy and have kept Rryan
and Bryanlsm la their previous obscu
rity.
"The present message gives the
soundest advice in the most
unexceptional language, nor can the
least complaint be made of the char
acter of the warning addressed to
Spain. It is not improbable that Spain
will take offense, but clearly Mr.
Cleveland Is actuated by friendly feel
ings. and Spain will do well to ac
quiesce."
The Chronicle. Liberal, in common
with other papers, congratulates both
countries on the prospects the adop
tion of a general arbitration treaty. It
says: "It is clear that the Cleveland
administration means to conclude the
great reform before resigning ofllce."
On the proposed Cuban settlement,
the Chronicle says:
"Spain has to face ? humiliating di
lcmma,but shccouldnoLfight tho United
States Air twenty-four hours. There
fore she should sell Cuba quickly, but
he would be no friend of the United
States who would advise her to buy
Cuba."

WASHINGTON, D. C? Doe. 7.?For
the llr?t tline within -memory of old of
llclaln the secretary of mute ha* made
a regular report to the President for
tranrmltfaton to Congress, like tho re
|Hirt? of other officer* of the cabinet.
This report was laid before CongreHH
to-day us un appendix to the* 'Presi
dent's message, It treats of many de
tails of our relations during the raM
year with foreign government* that
either were not touched upon at all In
the message or were more brolly treat
ed.
Under tho head of Spain, Secretary
Olney has much to say In reference to
Cuba and In his report he sots out In
great detail the history of the growth
of the rebellion; the present evil ?ute
of uffnlrs on the Island and other
facts upon which the President bases
his broad statements and conclusions.
So reference Is made to a report from
Consul General Lee, but tl? secretary
intimates that his Information comes
principally from tho United States con
suls and ho must be regarded us conll
dentlal as to Its source. The socre
tarv's estimate of the present situation
Is disclosed In the following paragraph
made under a preliminary statement
of the destruction of the Industrial re
sources of Cuba:
-From whatever point of view we re
gard the matter, It Is Impossible not to
discern that a state of things exists at
our doors alike dangerous to good re
lations, destructive of legitimate com
merce. fatal to the Internal resources
of Cuba, and most vaxatlous and try
ing, because entailing upon this gov
ernment excessive burdens la Its do
mestic administration and in Its out
ward relations. This situation cannot
indefinitely continue without growing
still worse, and the time may not be far
distant when the United States must
neriously consider whether Its rights
and interests as well as Its Internation
al duties in view of .Its peculiar rela
tions to the Island do not call for some
decided change in tho policy hitherto
pursued." ,
To begin with the secretary makes it
plain that the present insurrection Is
fur more formidable than the famous
"con year Insurrection," which began at.
Vara in ISf.S. He says that, starting
in the same portion of the Island, it
very early took proportions beyond its i
predecessor and therewith assumed an |
aggressive phase. 1'asslng the defen-1
sive llne.1 or troclias traversing the
Inland from north to south, formidable
bodies of the revolutionary forces early
}r. the year established themselves in
the rich sugar-planting districts of.
Panta Clara. Clenfuegos. and Matan- ,
zas. made hostile forays almost in sight
of Havana Itself, and. advancing west- i
ward, effected a lodgment in the fertile t
tobacco fields of Rio d-d Plnar which
has so far resisted all of the Span- i
teh efforts to overcome.
The secretary says that while no |
prominent seaport has been attacked i
bv the insurgents, a large pari of the
?S0O niUcs of seaport is practically in
their hands, and from its rugged ar.d .
wild character Is peculiarly fitted for I
guerrilla warfare and affords easy |
means of receiving land and supplies
of men and arms. The secretary adds:
"While thus In fact controlling the |
larger part of the internal area of the
whole island of Cuba from Cape San |
Antonio to Cape Mais!, ?ntl enjoying ,
practically unlindted use of an equauy
large part of the coast, tile revolution- |
ary forces are scattered, being nowhere ,
united for nny length of time to form |
an armv callable of attack or siege |
nnd lit to -take part In a pitched bat- ,
tie. Assembling suddenly at a given I
point. oft-Aii In a single night, they i
make unexpected sallies or carry de- f
structlon to the tobacco and cane fields
of Cuba, and at the first sign of pursuit .
or organised assault tlicy disperse only
to re-assemble In like manner at some |
other spot." , : |
The :;ecr?Vnry Illustrated his po.nt as
to the Irresponsibility of tho Insurgents I
by citing their destruction of American
plantations and the oppression of Ameri
can planters who grind cave, which he |
characterized as nct? of anarchy.
Recurring to hi* compari-on of this in
surrection with those that hw* preceded
Ir. Secretary Olney makes this signitl
cant statement: . . \
"From every accessible Indication It Is j
clear that the present rebellion is of a
far more formidable scale as to num- |
her?, intelligence nn?l representative fea
tures than any of the preceding revolts
0f this century: that the corresponding
efTort of Spain for its repression ha a been
enormously augmented; and that, de
spite the eonstnnt Influx of frejh armies
'and material of war from the metropolis,
the rebellion, after nearly two years or
successful resistance, appears to-day to
he In a condition to indefinitely^ prolong
the contest on Its present lines."
The secretary says: "A large part of
the correspondence of the state depart
ment with Its agents In Cuba hns been
devoted to cases of assault upon the
rights of our citizens. In no Instance
Iris earnest remonstrance nnd nuergetlo
appeal been omitted, llut the represen
tatives of the Spanish power often find
It easily practicable to postpone expla
nations and reparation mi the ground of
alleged Ignorance of facts or for other
plausible reasons."
Secretary Olney says very I'tile more
than do. s the President In hl? message
ivspectlng the Venezuelan boundary
question, lie announces w*lh salifica
tion that amicable counsels have pre
vailed to Induce a satisfactory result of
the attempts at an undertaking and that
th,* boundary question and It.i associated
phus.'* have been at last eliminated as
between this country and l-.nctind. He

paper ways John D. Rockefeller will
not engage In the Iron manufacture
business. That this did not halt out
before may be attributed to the fact
that Mr. Rockefeller has in the pres
ent case, as is usually his custom,
kept councli with himself and conse
quently the public lias been gulled by
men who, acvordlng t*> Mr. Rockefell
er's representative, have simply taken
advantage of the rumors Unit have
been Hoatkng about to further private
schemes.
Mr. L. M. Bowers, manager of the
' Bessemer Steamship Company, which
i Is the name under which Mr. Rockefel
ler's business is conducted, returned to
I day from New York where for two
days past he Iris been In consultation
with Mr. ltockefellcr and his closest
business associates.
"There Is absolutely no truth what
ever," said he. "in the rumors which
have been floating about for some time
to the effect that Mr. Rockefeller Is to
ngagc In the Iron business In -the vicin
ity of Cleveland, Chicago, or else
where.
"Nothing is further from his Inten
tion. and. in fact, the very opposite
of the report Is true. You could not
drive him or In any way Induce him to
go into tiro Iron manufacturing ln
dustry. His erection of our fleet of
boats was done simply in order to de
velop his iron ore mining interests.
They simply laugh at these reports In
New York. The stories were started by
men who had real estate or other per
sonal schemes to further."

MC7.DERERS LY5CHED.
A Mob nf Pnrmrr? '1'nkr Two 3??n From
JnllMiil ?trlnpThfittU|i,
LEXINGTON, Mo., Dec. 7.?At about
1 o'clock this (Monday) morning a mob
of Hay county farmers broke Into tho
county Jail here and secured Jesse Win
ner and James Nelson, held for the mur
der of Mrs. Winner and her two babes,
and lynched them.
Winner looked weak end dlshearten
ed all yesterday and It is thought ha
would have made an open confession be*
fore long.
The Winners came to Ray county
abAut five years ago, comlns from Tip
ton, Paulding county, Ohio, where h's
wife resided. Both were well connected,
she having two brothers back in Ohio
who are considered very wealthy.
The jail was not heavily guarded, as
no warning had been sent by the au
thorities nt Richmond to prepare for a
mob. The mob was comj>oe?od of 150
men, all unmarked. They were a very
orderly set of men. but clearly showed
that they meant business. So quletlj
dld the lynchers approach the Jail that
no one connected with it knew how the
mob crossed tho river, upon the banks of
wnlch tho Institution stood. They over
powered I he Jailer, James Goodts with
out any ado and demanded the ke>*6 to
the cells of Nelson and Winner. Goodo
had hidden them and when one of the
mob said to him: "Then.*la one way to
make you give them up." the Jailer
coolly replied: ""You can't make a dead
man give them up, eo shoot me If you
want to."
Tho leader? said they were prepared
with plenty of tools to effect an entrance
and displayed a quantity of dynamite,
pledges find chisels. Notwithstanding
Jailer Goode remained firm and the mob
went about to gain their end In another
way. The other prisoner? were told not
to make any break for their liberty, as
they would be severely dealt with If
they did. Then the doors were battered
down and the prisoners tied and led out.
One of the mob acted as captain, direct
ing the lynchers not to shoot as long as
the Jailor "behaved," as they expressed
it.
Tho demolition of tho doors proved
but the work of a few minutes. When
an entrance had been made two dozen
! men rushed direct to the cells of the two
murderers, who cowed and slunk into
the comers of their meagre quarter*,
begging plteously for mercy. None was
shown, but tho two men were led trium
phantly out into the open. Winner, the
husband and father, crone out trembling
with fear and looked tho picture of dis
tress. Nelson stood up bettor than Win
ner under the strain, but said not ft
word. As ho had passed his cell Win
ner told one .>1* the other prisoners that
I ho was guilty. The captain, when the
river was reached, was asked where he
wa< going to hang tne culprits and re
plied that they were going to Ray
county, just across the river. The river
was cirusod at about *J o'clock and the
j men wore quickly dispatched.
