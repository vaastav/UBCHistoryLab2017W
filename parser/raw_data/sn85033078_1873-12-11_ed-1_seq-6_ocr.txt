produced in .Spain by the treaty of Bayonne,
which It'd to the war of independence against
Napoleon. He begged to assure the Govern

giaius would instantaneously cause fright
ful commotion throughout the island, which
would be sure to result in successive catas
trophe-, even if a man of the highest ability
should be in command.

The negotiations between the United Stales
and Spain w ith regard to the question grow
ing out of the capture of the Virginius were
brought to a conclusion in Wellington on
the 29th ult.. Secretary Fish and Admiral
Polo having agreed upon and signed the pro
tocol, which the latter soon after telegraphed
to his government. The terms are substan
tially as follows;
I. The immediate delivery to the United States
-rf the ship Virginius, and all the surviving passen
gers and crew.
3. A salute to our flag on the 35th of December
next, unless in the meantime Spain shall satisfy
She United States that the American flag was im
properly borne on that vessel, and further that
me had no right to the American flag or
American papers. In this event the salute is to
be spontaneously withdrawn, and Spain is to for
autlly disclaim any intentional indignity to the flag
tu the acts committed by Spain against the Vir
jnnius.
3, If it shall thus he shown that the Virginius
ha.i no right to carry the American flag and pa
the United States will institute proceedings
against the vessel and the surviving parties who
have violated the laws of the United States, and
Sixain guarantees to institute proceedings against
any of her authorities who may have violated
airier law or treaty stipulations.
4. The matter of reclamation* for damages is re
served for future consideration.
A Washington telegram of the above date
rutye the words “immediate release,” as ap
plicable to the delivery of the Virginius and
the surving passengers and crew, implies, of
soAirse, a reasonable time for its execution,
i* some days must dapse before Havana and
Santiago de Cuba could be reached. The fix
oi the 25th of December as the time of sa
luting our flag is to allow necessary oppor
tunity to Spain to show that the Virginius
improperly carried the American flag and
American papers.
A Washington telegram of the 3d says Ad
miral Polo and Secretary Fish, since they sign
ed the protocol, had been in perfect accord
concerning the arrangements for the restora
tion of the Virginius and the survivors.
Eveiything so far had been done with calmness
on the part of the representatives of the two
Governments.

According to a Washington Associated Press
dispatch of the sth Secretary Fish was. not so
hopeful as he had been some days before of
the ability of Spain to carry out its orders.
The suggestion of a modification of the
protocol, that the Virginius might be
delivered to a third party to await adjudi
cation did not meet with any ofli
cial favor. A Cuban gentleman states that
he had conversed with Secretary Fish and sev
eral Senators, and they assured him that any|
further diplomacy with Spain on the V ir
ginias question would be declined. They’ be
lievtd the Spanish authorities in Cuba would
refuse to accede to ttie propositions of the
protocol, and war would probably be the con
sequence.
PERSONAL.
Tweed was taken to Blackwell’s Island on
the 29th ult. He was asked the usual ques
tions by the recording clerk, to which he an
swered that he was aged 02, occupation a
“statesman,” no religion; but, as his family
arc' Protestants, he was entered as Protestant.
He was taken to the bath, then had his head
shaved, heard taken off, and was arrayed in
full striped uniform. He had two letters
from New York City physicians, recommend
ing that he be placed in the hospital, but,
after an examination by the Penitentiary
physicians, he was recommended to a
common cell, like all other felons. The
jacket, given Mm to wear is known at the
Penitentiary as a “larceny jacket.” His son
stayed by him till he was led away to his cell,
when he and his friends left the island.
Three of Tweed’s lawyers, John Graham,
Judge Fullerton, and Mr. Bartlett, were on
the 29Mi lined by Judge Davis $250 each for
handing to him prior to the trial a protest
against his acting as Judge in the case, on the
ground of prejudice against the accused.

The Credit-Mobilier suit which was tried in
Hartford, Conn., last October, has been recent
ly decided by United States Judges Hunt and
Shipman. The motion of defendants’ counsel
to dismiss the bill, involving a question of
jurisdiction, was decided in favor of the Gov
ernment on the second point. The Court sus
tains the demurrer, and dismisses the bill
as to parties who demurred. The
ground of the demurrer is that
the damage to the Government by the Credit-
Mobilier frauds is too remote to be reached
by the process pursued, or by any other, and
that the Government has at present
no pecuniary interest to be reached
by the bill. The court takes the view
that there is no trust anywhere raised in
behalf of the Government to be protected.

Weather Report for Farmers
In his annual report the Chief Signal Officer
says:
The office has, under the direction of the Secre
tary of War, continued its exertions to solve, for
the special benefit of the agricultural interests, the
problem of giving promptly the information con
tained in the daily weather reports to the many
farming and other communities not now reached
by telegraph, and for which the copies published
by the press do not arrive in time for use. The
plan adopted has been to divide the territory of
the United States into districts, each district hav
ing a distributing-point at or near the center, from
which two printed copies of the synopsis and
probabilities are forwarded by mail to all post
offices within the districts, and which can he
reached by rail, steamer, or mail-coach by 4 p. m.
of the same day. This plan has been put in opera
tion with the co-operation of the Post-Office De
partment, the bulletins being exhibited in
frames by each Postmaster, at each post-office, as
soon as received, and now provides for the regular
distribution daily of 8.5)82 printed copies of the
weather report, for display at 4,45)1 different post
offices. It will be extended as rapidly as expe
dient. The work has given satisfaction to the
farming and interior population reached. Num
erous communications received at the office evi
dence the fact that iivraany localities farming and
other agricultural operations are conducted with
reference to the atmospheric condition announced
in these reports as probable to occur. The im
mense agricultural interests of the United States,
and the great results to be attained if they can be
thus benefited, have rendered this success pecu
liarly gratifying. The whole number of these
special bulletins so far printed and distributed is
85)''.014.
There are nineteen special river stations from
which reports of the depth of water in the prinrinal
rivers of the United States are daily made, hy tele
graph at particular seasons. daring which danger
from freshets may he anticipated. River reports
are also had froni twenty of the regular stations.
These data are widely published and distributed
along the lines of the rivers. The reports thus have
enabled many dangers which would otherwise fol
low rapid rises in the river to be guarded against,
and contributed, by the constant and accurate
knowledge given of the depth of water in the chan
nels, to the convenience and safety of the river
commerce. The benefits resulting from these re
ports, now in the second year of their issue, have
been fully acknowledged by the various inti rests
they have advanced. The total number of special
river bulletins issued has been 22 210
By the different modes of publication adopted
for the service, each of which haij_ been arranged
with definite purpose, and including that through
the public press, it is estimated that the informa
tion emanating from the office reaches daily one
third of the households in the United States. The
office is in regular communication with 161 estab
lished organizations, as Boards of Trade, Cham
bers of Commerce, Agricultural Societies, and
Commercial Associations. In addition to this
wide diffusion, the works of the office of a more
scientific character, and not intended for daily pop
ular use, have acquired a precision of detail and
fullness of illustration which enables them to com
pare favorably with those of foreign countries.
The plan and arrangement of these works are pe
culiar to this country.
VERIFICATION OF THE PROBABILITIES.
The ascertained comparative accuracy of the de
ductions from reports styled "Probabilities” has
been more clearly presented in this than In pre
ceding years. The percentage of verification has
been mathematically computed for each of the
geographical districts mentioned in the reports.
The annual average of verifications has been as
follows for the following-named districts: New
England, 81.50; Middle States, 81.17; South At
lantic. 79.92; Lower Lakes, 78.90; Eastern Gulf,
77 16; Ohio Valley, 76.42; Western Gulf, (4.40;
Upper Lakes. 75.23; Northwest, 74. VV ith a more
rb-id and scrutinizing mode of calculation than
was before adopted, the percentage of verifica
tions has improved.
HATS AND MISHAPS.
—J. C. Thomas, aged fifty, recently
killed a bear in a hand to hand contest,
in Tioga County, Pa.
—The boiler of the Anchor Mills, of St.
Louis, exploded recently, and two men
were killed by the escaping steam.
—Mrs. A. P. Glazier, of Haverhill,
Mass., while returning from her father’s
funeral, recently, was thrown from a car
riage and received injuries from which
she has died.
—James Moore, of Fremont, Ohio,
while working in his mill in that village,
a few days ago, was caught in the ma
chinery and severely injured. One leg
was smashed to a jelly, one arm broken
and he was also injured internally.
—Not long ago while Joseph Joyce, a
farmer living near Phillipsburg, (>., was
in t lie act of shooting a hog, the ritle was
prematurely discharged, the bail striking
and almost instantly killing bis oldest
son, about fourteen years of age.
—Joseph A. Money, a clerk in a Provi
dence grocery, went *to his lodging-room
one day lately, lighted the gas in a gas
stove and went to bed. The next evening
his room was broken open and Money
was found dead, supposably from as
phyxia.
—A couple of ingenious boys at St.
Cloud, Minnesota, lately amused them
selves by tilling a schoolmate’s mouth with
snow and tying a handkerchief round his
jaws to keep them shut, and t lie coroner's
jury could scarcely agree whether to call
it choking or drowning.
—The kitchen range in a house at Toms
River, N. J., recently refused to burn in
spite of all efforts. Finally, on careful
investigation, a family of hornets were
discovered within two feet of the tire
chamber, busily engaged in plastering
the draft hole with clay.
—Mr. <). B. Hastings met with a sud
den and awful death lately, while work
ing in a mine near Bucks, about forty-five
miles south-west of Lyndon, Kansas. He
was inexperienced in the business of dig
ging coal, and being naturally energetic
and daring, he worked under an over
hanging bana some four feet, against tne
remonstrance of older miners, until a sud
den crash buried and crushed him in an
instant.
—During Mrs. Livermore’s lecture at
Springfield, Mass., the other night, siie
spoke with considerable severity of tight
lacing, and when she had closed her re
marks relating to corsets, according to a
local paper, “a young lady in the gallery,
with great difficulty and much persever
ance, burst her corset strings, and, draw
ing them forth, knotted them together,
and tossing them to some young gentle
man near by, remarked, ‘Here, boys, you
can have this to play cat's cradle with.’ ”
—Certain people in Somerville, Mass.,
have become convinced that human de
pravity is a bottomless abyss. To that
town there recently came a nice young
hero, fresh from deeds of valor on Modoc
battlefields, and as he presented gilt-edged
credentials from a New York church, be
was admitted to the first circles ecclesias
tical and social. Having delivered a lec
ture on Modoc subjects, he incurred a
considerable bill for advertising, and this
was subsequently rudely thrust under his
nose, and payment demanded. Certainly,
he hadn't the amount, but would borrow
it, and he tried, unsuccessfully however,
for the times are hard, and th. t night the
warrior took his flight, and snocking to
relate, it is the current talk that, during
his brief stay, he conquered the hearts of
two Somerville maidens, one of them the
minister’s daughter, and actually engaged
to marry them both.
—Miss Jennie Warner, of Highgate,Vt.,
it is said, is a young lady of literary tastes
and tendencies, and lias recently been en
gaged in writing for the press with so
much assiduity that her friends have been
somewhat alarmed lest she should over
work and make hersell ill. Recently, her
aunt, Mrs. G. W. Foster, was at Miss
Wen when that young lady informed
her tu-c- on the filh of November she
should go to sleep and not wake again
until the 2-id ot November. She charged
her aunt to see that this sleep was not
mistaken for death, that her hair was not
cut off and she buried. Although these
singular predictions were made with
much seriousness, little heed was paid to
them at the time, but sure enough she fell
asleep on the !Uh. and on the 23d awaken
ed, continuing, in the interval, to lie in a
condition scarce distinguishable from
death, save for quiet and regular breath
ing.

Sinking’ of the Steamship Ville du
Havre.
The telegraph has briefly described Un
less of tlie French steamship Ville du
Havre, and tw hundred anil twenty-six
of her passengers and crew in mid-ocean,
in consequence of a collision with the
British ship Locherne. The vessel was
formerly called the Napoleon 111. She
was, with the exception of the Great
Eastern, the largest vessel afloat. Her di
mensions were 430 feet by 48 feet, and her
carrying capacity was 3,500 tons freight
and measurement. She was elegantly
upholstered and appointed, had urbane
and accomplished officers, and was de
servedly a favorite with those who had
occasion to cross the Atlantic.
The Ville du Havre left New York on
the loth of November, under charge ot
Captain Surmont With the exception ol
foggy weather and light variable winds,
nothing occurred worthy of note until
the morning of November 23, when being
in latitude 47.21 and longitude 3-5.41, the
steamer was struck amidships by Un-
British ship Locherne, and sunk in
twelve minutes afterward. The Ville du
Havre went with two hundred and twenty
six of her passengers and crew to the
bottom. Only ninety-two souls were
saved out of that multitude which left
New York so gayly only a week before.
The purser of the Ville du Havre gives
the following account of tae disaster:
The steamer was struck on the star
board side, and tire mainmast and rigging
were carried away. The long boat was
not crushed on deck, but after being
lowered, the mizzenmast falling upon it,
and killing nearly all Its occupants, flu
mainmast fell after lire miz/.en, toppling
sons, in a deck, and killing many per
over on the few minutes the ship began to
sink, amidst great disorder and panic ami
terror. The air was rent with shriek-,
but some were heard saying calmly; “As
we must die, let us die nobly.” The
water rushed into the hold with incredi
ble velocity. 1 undressed myself, and
with a companion jumped overboard and
swam toward the Locherne, then half a
mile distant. As 1 left I heard the ship
cracking, and looking back saw her go
down with one plunge forward. Fora
moment the shrieks were terrible; then
all was silent; it was the silence of death.
The caotain remained on the bridge ol
the Ville du Havre during the whole time,
and went down wi ll the ship. He was
picked up an hour afterward. All the
officers who were rescued were saved in a
similar manner, except the first lieutenant,
whom the captain sent to the Locherne
to see if she were able to receive the p;uv
sengers of the Ville du Havre. 1 swam
hall an hour and finally reached the
Locherne, but missed the ropes thrown to
me. 1 remained in the water another
quarter of an hour, but was eventually
rescued by the Locherne.
Among the passengers on the deck ol
the Ville du Havre was a French gentleman
of remarkable coolness and presence ol
mind. He comforted many by his words.
A priest asked: “Are you a Roman Cath
olic V” “Vcs,” was the answer. “Repent,
then,” said the priest, “and I forgive your
sins.” With tuese last words the priest
sank in the waves. The penitent was
saved.
The boats crossed and recrossed the
scene of the disaster, searching lor sur '
vivors, until 10 a. m. Furthereflorts were
then abandoned as hopeless. The sur
vivors remained on the Locherne until •>
p. m., when they were transported to the
Trimontain. t } ,
Among the lost were Judge R. \V. Beck
ham of the New York Court of Appeal,
and the four children of 11. G. Spafloru,
Esq., of Chicago Eleven of the victims
resided in the latter city-.
