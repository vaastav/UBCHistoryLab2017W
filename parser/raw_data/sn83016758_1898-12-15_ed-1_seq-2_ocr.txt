GEN. GARCIA
DISTINGUISHED CUBAN WARRIOR
PASSES AWAY.
Pneumonia, Brought on the Sad-
den Change From the Warm
Climate o* Cuba to the Wintry-
Weather of New York and Wash-
lngton, the Canse o* DeathIn His
Dying moments His Thought*
Were for His Beloved Country
a nd Its People Whom He Served
So Well.Unconscious Most of the
Time Preceding Dissolution.
Washington, Dec. 13. Gen. Calixto
Garcia, the distinguished Cuban war
rior and veteran head of the commis
sion elected by the Cuban assembly to
Visit this country, died here yesterday
morning shortly after 10 o'clock at the
Hotel Raleigh, where the commission
has its headquarters. The sudden
change from the warm climate of
Cuba with the hardships he had there
endured to the wintry weather of New
York and Washington is responsible
for the pneumonia which resulted in
his demise. He contracted a slight
cold in New York, which did not as
sume an alarming stage until the early
part of last week. On Tuesday night
Gen. Garcia, in eompany with the oth
er members of the commission, at
tended a dinner given in his honor by
Gen. Miles, and it was a result of the
exposure that night which culminated
in his death. During the twelve hours
or more
Preceding Dissolution
Gen. Garcia was unconscious most of
the time. At intervals he recognized
one or more of those about him. In
his dying moments, as all through his
busy and active life, his thoughts were
for his beloved countiy audi its people,
and amongst his last words were ir
rational murmurings in which he gave
orders to his officers on his staff fdr
the battle which he supposed was to
occur to-morrow, and in which he un
derstood there were only 400 Span
iards to combat. Just before he died
he embraced his son. Rev. Father
Magee, of St. Patrick's church, was
called in during the day and was with
Gen. Garcia until the end, administer
ing the last rites of the Catholic
church. Other members of the com
mission and Mr. Rubens, their counsel
in this country, were also in the bed
chamber when the end came. The
remains were immediately
Prepared for Burial
and were placed on a bier in the room
in which he died. A large Cuban flag
served as a covering, and the head
rested en one of smalled dimensions.
The face and bust were left exposed
to public view. The features had) a re
markably life-like appearance and
gave no indication of the suffering
which the deceased had borne. Just
above the head rested a magnificent
floral piece of red and white roses and
cross-palms tied with a pure white
ribbon, By direction of Maj. Gen.
Miles, a detachment of soldiers from
battery F, Sixth artillery, at the bar
racks here under command of Lieut.
Cox, was detailed as a body guard for
the remains. After Gen. Garcia's
death steps were taken to notify tne
government officials here and also the
executive committee of the Cuban as
sembly, which has its headquarters at
Marianao, Cuba. Secretary Jose Vil
lalon, of the commission sent a tele
gram of notification to Mendez Capot,
the president of the Cuban assembly,
who is now in Havana.
Letters of condolence were received
from President McKinley, Secretary of
State Hay, Gen. Miles, Senator For
aker and others. Arrangements for

Dewey and Otis Not a Vast Im
provement.
Washington, Dec. 11.The navy de
partment has received a cablegram
from Admiral Dewey summarizing the
existing conditions at Manila and such
points in the Philippines as have been
visited by his officers. Advices also
have been received from Gen. Otis, the
commandant of the United States mili
tary forces in the islands, and they
both go to show a notable improve
ment in conditions and the growth of
a better spirity among those factions
of the natives which promised to give
trouble. This fact is particularly
gratifying as the United States govern
ment is already giving consideration of
the best means at hand to redeem the
pledge it will be placed under by the
treaty of Paris to secure the release of
the Spanish prisoners held by the Phil
ippine natives. There are about 500
clerical prisoners and the government
is confident that their captors will de
liver them up on proper representa
tions from Gen. Otis and Admiral
Dewey, made possibly through Consul
Wildman. It may be necessary to call
the navy into service in this matter
for the reason that the prisoners are
held in captivity on other islands than
Luzon, which can be reached best and
most effectively by Admiral Dewey's
ships. Besides these clerical prisoners
the Americans themselves hold nearly
15,000 Spanih soldiers as prisoners,
men captured at the fall of Manila.
These are actually on parole about the
city, and the question is how they are
to be returned to Spain. This must be
settled by the peace commissioners at
Paris.

Leading Spirits in the East Confer
ring With the Trust Promoters.
Duluth, Minn., Dec. 11. Leading
spirits in the flour mills here are in the
East, presumably to confer with
Thomas Mclntyre, promoter of the
flour trust Manager Church, of the
Imperial mill, left on Wednesday, and
George Palmer, manager of the Min
kota, left last evening for New York.
Managers of other mills are already in
the East. The trust, when completed,
will take in the Duluth Imperial mill,
the Freeman at West Superior, capac
ity, 2,500 barrels and at Superior, the
Daisy, capacity, 3,000 barrels Listman,
2,500 barrels Anchor, 2,000 barrels,
and probably the Minkota at West Su
perior, 1,000 barrels. The price agreed
upon for the mills named, except the
Mmkota, is $1,750,000 cash. This would
give the trust a capacity of 17,500 bar
rels daily at the head of the lakes, and
1,000 barrels more if the Minkota is
taken. The Minkota managers hold
out for a very stiff price, $250,000 on a
plant that cost about $100,000. It has
been a great moneymaker, but it is
thought that not even the trust pro
moters can afford to pay this amount.

powder was being wheeled into the
room and was accidentally overturnea,
and the car wheels running into the
loose powder caused a friction that set
the powder afire. The explosions very

Paris, Dec. 13.The treaty of peaca

The document was prepared by Secre-1

for Spain, on account of the continued!

Spanish commission. Each copy con

most crushed, and none could with
hold sympathy from Senor Rios, thej
president of the Spanish commission,
who, coming from his bed, was
bundled in a great overcoat, though
logs were burning in the fireplace near
by. The spirits of the two bodiea
were symbolized by the clothes worn
by the members of the commission,
for the Americans were attired in
evening dress for the dinner given
them immediately after the meeting
by the Due de Loubal, and the Span
