Senator Sutherland at Work
Senator Sutherland baa been devoting
his time for some weeks to the work of
the committee on revision of the laws
which has under consideration the codi
fication of the laws relating to the ju
diciary This Js very important work In
volving as it does the whole subject of
iItu1I1tinn nrnttlon nnd nrocedura
of the federal courts The senator hopes
to see it completed and a bill paued by
congress at this session
As a result of information secured
through field examination of areas em
braced within the present withdrawals of
lands thought to contain valuable depos
its of phosphate the secretary of the in
terior has restored to the public domain
approximately 1976360 acres of land in
the states of Wyoming Idaho and Utah
which dojes not contain phosphate depos
its within such a reasonable depfti as to
make them worth working This exam
ination resulted in the securing of infor
mation showing that an area of approxi
mately 391438 acres of land in the states
of Wyoming and Idaho not heretofore
withdrawn contained valuable deposits of
phosphate
The lands embraced within this area
have therefore been withdrawn from all
forms of disposition in aid of proposed
legislation affecting the disposal of phos
phate lands The effect of the above
restoration and withdrawal will be to re
duce the total area covered by phosphate
withdrawals to 2551399 acres of which
1273254 acres are In Wyoming 113963
acres in Idaho and 138567 acres in Utah

OPTION GIVEN ON CHOICE
PROPERTY IN MAIN STREET
Part Payment Made to Newhouse
on 225000 Sale of Bamberger
Corner at Postoffice Place
Before leaving for Europe Samuel Newhouse gave an option on the
property at the northwest corner of Main street and Fostoffice place
and part payment on the sale price of 225000 was made The option
will lie taken upat or before its expiration and the balance paid
Less than three years ago Samuel Newhotise bought the same piece
of property from the Bamberger interests for 150000 That meant
that he makes a profit of 75000 V
The property upon which there is now an unsightly row of one
story buildings has a Main street frontage of 66 feet and a depth in
Postoffice place of 165 feet It is now occupied by the Doull Drug com
pany the Christensen cigar store and the Boehmer tailor shop
Buying this property for 2273 per front
foot Mr Newhouse after holding it less
than three years sells It for 3410 per
front foot
The public announcement of this deal
the largest since the Auerbach coup can
not be complete at this time for the
reason that the name of the purchaser
is kept secret and the transaction was
made through a broker Lafayette
Hanchett Mr Newhouses representative
admitted last night that there was an op
tion out on the property but he would
not give the name of the purchaser
Office Building Planned
It is known however that the purchaser
of the property will build at that choice
corner one of the finest office buildings
in the city It is also known that agent
for the same buyer attempted to purchase
the property owned by Henry Newell ad
joining the Newhouce property on the
north and having the same frontage and
depth No option or sale has been made
on the Newell propertf
When Mr Newhouse bought the Doull
drug store corner from the Bambe rgers
three years ago for 150000 many real es

evinced more madness in that than In his
fortuneplunge across the street where
his skyscrapers now stand Yet he had
foreseen what others did not and cleared
75000 on the transaction It to said by
real estate brokers that had Mr New
house held the property until spring he
could have sold it for at least a quarter
of a million

giving the health officers almost radical
authority and power to separate a con
sumptive mother from her children a
husband from his wife or to take any
member of a family from the home to
a place of Isolation if they do not carry
out its provisions was passed today by
the board of supervisors for the guidance
of persons afflicted with tuberculosis
The ordinance after declaring tubercu
losis a communicable disease sets forth
regulation for the guidance of physi
cians and their patients It invests the
health officer virtually with unrestricted
power He may close up a place if his
orders for sanitation and disinfection are
not obeyed he may punish a victim of
the white plague for carelessness and
if he deems it advisablo he may forcibly
remove a person from his home
After setting forth certain sanitary reg
ulations and rules for the disinfecting of
rooms and apartments occupied by a con
sumptive it provided that the affllcfcc
person may be punished for carelessness
in exposing others to the disease The
ordinance also declares where such reg
ulations are not or cannot be observed
the patient may be removed without the
consent of the sufferer or his family by
force if necessary to such place as the
health department may designate
