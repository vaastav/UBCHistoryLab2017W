Husbands Going Up
1 Philadelphia Ledger
War plays havoc with men. Deep thinkers
are already discussing the effect of a shortage
upon the institution of matrimony, and are even
suggesting polygamy as a solution of the problem.
One aspect of it which just now seems ta concern
many girls who have sweethearts at the 'front is
whether love demands that they should marry
these if they come home crippled. Qerman effi
ciency is already engaged in a practical effort to
meet this issue. An advertisement in a German
newspaper, described as "typical," offers a wife
and home to an injured soldier on easy terms.
The advertiser, who is 22, modestly says that she
is "not bad looking." She lays greater emphasis
on other attractions. She has 14 fowls on her
arm, a large number in these days of food
scarcity, to say nothing of a pony, pigs, cows,
"two hams and some sausages now in process of
curing." These attractions should be sufficient;
but there are besides a piano and a flute, to make
pleasant evenings for a music loving German
household. Even life in war time should be
agreeable in these circumstances.
Nor is this all. This sensible girl, with all The
materials of a successful hausfrau at hand, does
- rot seek to bind a prospective husband by any
liard and fast promise. She has "no objection
to a separation if after six months of married life
incompatibility of character should manifest itself
m either side." It would be cynical to suggest
rliat the large number of injured soldiers and the
small number of girls who can offer them such
vantages gives her the best end of the bargain.
She is doubtless moved simply by the generous
desire to leave the man a loophole of freedom.
'Why don't the men propose, mamma?" The
writer of that once familiar song lived in times
when the women didn't propose at least direct
ly. Is not this frank method of asking for what
you want really the more excellent war? Aftef

Big Work Awaiting Congress.
The' present session for wtich congress has
just reconvened will probably sot be as epochal
as the extra session with which it started, but it
will have a full program of legislative business
to be transacted. Without needing to devote any
time to organization, both houses can buckle
down to the job which is big enough to taVe the
best thought and most strenuous endeavors of
every conscientious member.
One of the first and perhaps the most pressing
questions to be decided will be whether the decla
ration that a state of war exists shall be enlarged
to include Germany's allies Austria, Turkey and
Bulgaria. What was done by the last session was
to push the button and set the wheels in motion
for the prosecution of our part in the great world
war. None of this machinery, so far set up, can
be expected to turn out its work without further
strengthening by improvements or repairs. The
biggest supply of bills ever presented to a law
making body are in prospect and further revenue
raising and bond-issue provisions to make sure
that the money is forthcoming to pay the bills.
The current events in the war arena are also
likely to be reflected in the proceedings of con
gressto say nothing of the ever present incen
tive to the peace makers to start something pre
maturely. The great body of the members of both houses
will without question be found unwavering in the
support of a vigorous war policy as it may be out
lined from time to time by the president. It is
fair to assume also that after feeling pppular sen
timent at home the majority will be less tolerant
of backfiring and obstruction although we may
expect some great debates upon questions which
offer room for honest difference of opinion.
What Next for the Suffragists?
What shall be the next move on the suffrage
chess board in Nebraska? This is the question
expected to consume most of the time and atten
tion of our equal suffrage friends in their state
convention for which they are assembling here.
The Bee knows that its advice has not been
solicited and perhaps is not wanted, but we ven
ture none the less to recall the fact that we
pointed out in advance the complication which
the suffrage adv6cates were bringing down upon
themselves when they insisted last winter upon
pushing their limited suffrage bill through the
legislature. At that time we warned them in
these columns that the initiative and referendum
is a double acting device which may be used by
both sides. We told them then that their limited
suffrage law was a challenge to the antis to in
voke the referendum and that such a referendum
on the ballot in 1918 would make it dangerous
to resubmit at the same time with constitutional
amendment for complete suffrage. What The Bee
then forecasted is precisely what-has happened.
So what the suffrage conference must now
consider js whether it is more promising of suc
cess for the cause to fight it out on the line of the
limited suffrage referendum or by initiating a
constitutional amendment with the attending con'
fusion and divided effort, run the risk of losing
out on the one they want most, if not on both.
In practical politics, as in war, one fight at a
time is usually enough for most folks. There is
one way out for our suffrage friends If they are
ready to cut the Gordian knot suggested by the
recent Indiana decision declaring unconstitutional
a limited suffrage' law , similar to that passed in
Nebraska. If, bravely admitting their mistake,
the equal suffragists would go into court 'right
away and kock out the half measure foolishly
put through the legislature, they could then get
busy with initiative petitions for complete suf
frake by constitutional amendment and have them
filed in time to be voted on at the next election.
It goes without saying that if they' can carry
limited suffrage, they can just as easily with the
same effort carry unlimited suffrage. On the
other hand, another defeat occasioned by trying
to pack a double-header means another four years'
wait to say nothing of the effect on the national
movement 1 ; 1
" Away With Quarreling Pedagogues.
We have the word of 4 candidate for the
presidency of the Nebraska State Teach
ers' association, that the association intends to
elect its president and other officers and to select
a place of meeting in its own way, despite the at
tempts of marplots to prejudice the minds of
members. JOt those who are creating dissension;
we are told by Mr. Dixon: "These men are of
narrow educational vision and of small educa
tional calibre." He makes further observations
which are entitled to consideration by the teachers
as well as by the press and public of the state.
He can see no reason why the teachers should be
called upon to take sides as between the warring
factions of the two competing state, normal
schools. He admonishes the state teachers to
take action "uninfluenced by outside agencies,"
and to run their association affairs in their own
way.
The chief significance of this pronouncement
is that the time has come to rebuke the quarreling
factions within the association, and to clear the
atmosphere for the important work of education
which must ever be its chief concern. These
strictures reveal a state of things within the asso
ciation which calls for the serious consideration of
its leaders whosi duty it is to adopt measures to
promote harmony among the members.
It is difficult to see why the selection of a
meeting place should control the choice of offi
cers. The one hinges upon the question of ade
quate hotel and transportation facilities; the other,
upon the qualifications of men and women as
educators. Is it not patent that the bestowal of
official honors should b,t kept wholly separate
from the rivalries incident to the selection of a
meeting place? Certainly there are men in the
association broad enough to see this, and strong
enough to convince the members of the wisdom
of divorcing the issues.
The reference to "outside influences" no doubt
relates to the underground currents which in the
past have had something to do with the elevation
of men to the chief offices of the association.
However that may be, all Nebraska "will bail
the day when petty quarreling in the association
shall be eliminated to the end that its whole,
energies may be directed j toward the goal of
higher efficiency in school administration. This
is all the more to be desired because the war is
imposing new responsibilities upon our school
authorities and teachers whih must be met if the
youth of the nation is to bej equipped for the se
rious work ahead. ' J
The War and Civil Hospitals
By Frederic J Haskin
Within two days after Ahe declaration of war,
France ordered all alien enemies out of the coun
try and gave them. 48 hots to make the getaway.
Great Britain hesitated lor a week and then re
quired all aliens to rerister. The United States
at war with Germany or seven months, has just
reached the crossroad of registration.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 1. American hos
pitals are now in danger of being undermanned,
undernursed and undernourished as a result of
the war. Thousands of physicians and nurses
have left to join the army and the Red Cross
and more are leaving every day. The Red Cross
is enrolling nurses on the average of 1,000 a
month. Hospital supplies are becoming scarce
owing to the fact that enormous quantities are
being snipped out of the country. Moreover, hos
pital funds never too abundant are threatened
with reduction this year in order that more money
may be released for the sick and wounded of
Europe.
In short, the hospitals are hard hit by the war,
but they are not complaining. On the contrary
the hospital hoards of the country are trying to
figure out how they can possibly release more
men, more nurses and more money to the govern
ment. Perhaps this is because the hospitals know
what war is. They are used to fighting germs,
which is not so much easier than fighting Ger
mans. .
At any rate, trained nurses in many hospitals
are accepting extra duties without a murmur.
When you consider that the trained nurse in times
of peace is always an overworked individual, her
war activities appear all the more remarkable,
junior nurses have suddenly had to take over the
duties of senior nurses while the latter rushed off
to pack their trunks for Europe. Others have had
to become anesthetists, in the place of men who
are now in the medical corps. Still others have
worked straight shifts of 24 hours.
The government has announced that it does
not intend to use the civil hospitals for military
hospitals, unless some unexpected emergency
makes such a step necessary. Under the present
plan the majority of our war hospitals will be in
France, since the return of wounded to this
country entails too many hazards. If a man is
only slightly wounded he will be taken care of
in an American base hospital in France and as
soort as he is recovered, will be sent back to the
front. If his wound is so serious as to prevent
him from being of any further military use he will
be kept in France until he is able to stand the
trip home. Only cases requiring a long period of
convalescence or re-education are, therefore, apt
to be sent back to this country. ,
1 Nevertheless the hospitals are preparing for
the unexpected. Some of the larger institutions
of 200 or more beds have offered their services
to the medical department of the army and are
prepared to receive wounded soldiers at any time.
In this event, the entire hospital, if necessary,
or that section of it devoted to wounded, would
automatically pass under military control
' In the meantime, however, serious problems
must be faced. Many hospitals supported by pri
vate subscription are hav'ng a hard time Retting
along for the reason that the subscribers are show
ing a tendency to withdraw their usual contribu
tions and put them into the more spectacular ac
tivities of the war. The high cost of food reacts
upon hospitals the same as upon other consumers.
Moreover, linen, cotton, steel instruments, acids,
drugs all the articles that go to make up the
equipment of the hospital are not only expensive
but hard to get. European orders are given pre
cedence bv t'e manufacturers, a"H ho- ie or'Ws
are slow in delivery owing to traffic congestion.
The medical department of the army, it is true,
has been as considerate as possible. In accepting
physicians in the medical corps the surgeon gen
eral and his assistants have made every effort to
work as little hardship as possible on the hospitals
of the country. They have exempted men who
were especially necessary to certain hospital
staffs as well as teachers in medical schools.
The importance of keeping up the nation s
medical schools in spite of the war ha9 been
realized by the government. Many physicians
will be killed, it is cheerfully predicted, and others
must be trained to take their places. The prog
ress of science, all authorities agree, must be in
terfered with as little as possible by the war. And
the quicker students are graduated from the medi
cal schools the quicker other physicians may be
released. .. , ,
It is equally important that nurses schools
should be kept open and at a maximum capacity.
There is really an alarming shortage of nurses.
The majority of those who are joining the Red
Cross are those who have, been doing private
nursing, but hospital nurses in great numbers
have been taken, too; especially, head nurses and
superintendents women with years of experience
and training. To add to the difficulties, a much
smaller percentage of young women appear to
be taking up the study of nursing this year. The
probation classes in the hospitals are greatly re
duced, due, it has been pointed out by some. to
the large number of opportunities now opening
up for women in munition factories, offices, banks,
railroad yards and other places that were formerly
occupied by men.
'The fact of the matter is that nursing is one
of the hardest occupations that women can pos
sibly undertake. True, it is transfigured by a
high ideal, but the hard practical work is there
just the same. The first six months a nurse is
on probation she must perform te mnst men al
tasks. Scrubbing bath tubs, mopping floors, car
rying trays and running errands are rarely men-t
tioned as conspicuous features in the nursinst
curriculum, but in many hospital they are. Of
course, during this time the TroMt:oner is beinR
paid for her services by the hospital, but the sum
is one that a husky domestic would scorn.
Manv hospitals are all that any nurse could
wish. They run as smoothly as it is possible for
a hospital to run; there are plenty of nurses;
plenty of accommodations for them and plenty
of servants to do the housekeeping end of the
job, But anyone who has ever been unfortunate
enough to have to spend any length of time in
a hospital can tell you that these instances are
comnarativelv rare.
During the past two years a great deal of
energy and time have been consumed in teach
ing young society women how to make bandages
and to administer first aid to the injured. Such
instruction was too meager, of course, to make
them eligible for the battle front, but they could
be of service now in the present shortage of
nurses in civil hospitals. They are not, however,
applying in any overwhelming numbers for the
chance to become nurses. On the battle front it
is different there exists a certain glamour. But
at home the nursing profession appears to have
lost its glamour for a large number of women.
Thus the hospitals of the country are now
facing a grave danger which threatens to react
upon the whole population. They are meeting it
cheerfully, with the help of patriotic Americans
who realize that the civil hospitals at the present
time also constitute a war problem.

' Hundredth street, two doors from the
police station, recently. At the root
of the stairs a little negro girl was

feather dusters in their coiffures and
were sopranos. The dark mite at the
foot of the stairs wore a partially

A Word for the Railroad.
Genoa, Neb., Dec. 3. To the Edi
tor of the Bee: A few days ago I no
ticed where some cheap ink "slinger"
endeavored to get a cheap advertise
ment for Chappell, Neb., by running
under big head lines "car shortage
may ruin town," almost to the word.
The whole article is misrepresenta
tions in order to boost their town and
gently use the Union Pacific as the
goat. We will admit the car situation
is an acute proposition, but it's not the
Union Pacifiic Railroad company's
fault or any one else. It is merely a
condition caused by our present war.
No railroad is doing more to handle
the freight transportation problems
than the Union Pacific. Then to have
a cheap editor take a slam at a rail
road in order to say something for his
town is disgusting to say the least
Chappell is just a small hamlet up in
Deuel county. The Union Pacific has
done more for this village than they
ever can repay for service rendered
and if Chappell has their elevators full
of wheat they should be thankful and
wait their turn for cars. The great
trouble with Chappell is that when
Mr. Hoover said S2 wheat, they took it
for a Joke and expected to hoard up
their wheat to get an exorbiant
price, but now they realize Mr. Hoover
meant what he said, and now want
to take their spite out on the Union
Pacific because cars are scarce.

Liberty Bonds as Collateral.
Norfolk, Neb., Dec 1. To. the edi
tor of The Bee: The writer received a
circular letter and descriptive
pamphlet from a syndicate promoting
oil wells in Wyoming in which it ad
vised that people could send Liberty
bonds in payment for stock. Also a
store m town advertises it accepts Lib
erty bonds in payment for purchases.
One can deposit the bond, and as pur
chases are made, the various amounts
are deducted irom the face value of
the bond. It appears to me that if
Home restriction is not placed on the
concentration of purchases of these
bonus that their main talking-point,
viz: ownership by the great masses o
the people, will be destroyed. If car
ried to a logical conclusion which is
possible, they can gradually be con
centrated in a few nanus of big banks,
big insurance companies, etc., and it
would place these bame companies in
a position to dictate tuture methods of
the liquidation of tnese bonus. 1 know
you can see tne point I am driving at
Don't you think some action to avert
the possibility I mention is necessary
and ao you not think there is some
feasible plan whereby people may use
these bonus mucn as an insurance pol
icy is used in borrowing money, yet
