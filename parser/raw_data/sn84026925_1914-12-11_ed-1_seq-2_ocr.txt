? Washington dispatches say that the
president has reached the point where
he does not propose to put up any
longer with the conduct of the warring
Mexicans who are so careless about
firing their bullets across the border at
Naco, Arizona. Quite a number of
Americans have at different times been
struck by stray bullets, fired across the
line by the belligerents of one side or
the other and the people down that
way have expressed their impatience in
a manner that indicates that they are
about ready to take action that will
shake things up. There has been seri

the past few days additional regular
United tates troops have been sent to
the Mexican border, and the president
is quoted as saying that while he has
no idea of taking any aggressive action
in the sense of invading Mexico, if the
Mexicans Are across the border again,
troops will be ordered to return the
Are.
? West Orange, N. J., Dec. 10:
Thomas A. Edison last night, watched
the destruction by Are of the greater
part of his immense manufacturing
plant on Vallery road, West Orange,
which bears his name. The several
buildings house his companies which
make phonographs, moving picture
Alms and other things of his invention.
The Are started early in the
evening by an explosion in the Aim
room of one of the largest of the
eighteen buildings which constitute the
Edison plant. Explosions of chemicals
and other substances used in Aim making
and other work followed each
other rapidly and the Aames spread
from one building to another. "Although
I am more than 67 years of age,
I'll start all over again tomorrow,"
said Mr. Edison. "I am pretty well
burned out tonight but tomorrow there
will be a mobilization here and the
debris will be cleared away 11 u is
cooled sufflciently, and I will go right
to work to reconstruct the plant." The
inventor expressed himself thus as he
stood watching the flames lick up
building after building of his mammoth
electric plant. Sixteen of the eighteen
buildings of the plant were destroyed,
entailing a property loss of $7,000,000.

who was convicted of the murder of
Mary Phagan, the 14-year-old pencil
factory girl in April, 1913, and sentenced
to death, and who has been since
lighting for his life through appeals to
the Georgia supreme court and the
United States supreme court, has after
the exhaustion of all legal procedure,
again been sentenced to death. This
last sentence was imposed In Atlanta
on last Wednesday, and Friday,
January 22, 1915, was fixed as the date
Before receiving sentence Frank made
a statement in which he denounced the
mob violence that pervaded the court
room upon the occasion of the trial. He
again declared that Jim Conley the negro
on whose testimony he was convicted
was a liar, and said that although
it was sweet to live with the
love of wife, mother and friends, he
was not afraid to die. He declared also
that the time would come when his innocence
would be vindicated, and it
was too late to remedy the terrible
mistake that had been made the people
of Georgia would realize the horrible
crime that had been committed
against innocence and justice. Those
people who believe that Frank is innocent
will now redouble their pressure
on the governor in behalf of a pardon.

Tuesday, announced that 13,066,105
bales of cotton, counting rounds as
half bales, of the growth of 1914. has
been ginned prior to December 1. This
compared with 12,088,412 bales, or

crop. Included in the ginnings were
36.195 round bales, compared with
86,878 last year, 73,030 in 1912 and
87.996 in 1911. Sea island cotton

? The following is from the Detroit.
Michigan, Free Press, of December
3: In the middle of a lecture by
Speaker Champ Clark of the national
house of representatives, after the
speaker had shown evidences in his
actions and words of being under the
influence of liquor, the board of directors
of the Detroit board of comYVorinpsdflv
nieht. suddenly
terminated the address by turning out
the lights. Mr. Clark had been Invited
to leave the lecture platform
by Secretary Byrfes H. Gritchell of
the board, but refused to listen to
him. The lights then were turned off
and relighted, but the speaker continued
in his rambling talk. Finally
the lights were again turned off and
Mr. Clark was led from the platform.
One-third of the audience of more
than 1,000 had left their seats abruptly
and walked from the hall before
any attempt was made to silence
the speaker. Most of those who left
were women. From the first it was
apparent that Speaker Clark was not
natural in his demeanor. His gestures
were unsteady and halting.
The greater portion of the time his
hand drooped, palm inward, and his
chin was sunk low on his chest. His
voice, too. broke noticebly after the
first 15 minutes and became a hoarse
growl. The longer he spoke the less
coherent his speech and thought became.
After Speaker Clark had been
taken from the building. Mr. Gritchell
apologized to those of the audience
who remained and stated that any
who had purchased special tickets for
the lecture could have their dollars
refunded at the door.
? The German cruisers Scharnhoi st,
Geneisenau and Leipsig, were sunk off
the Faulkland Islands in the South Atlantic
on December 8, by a British
squadron under Vice Admiral Sir Frederick
Sturdee. The German squadron
was under command of Admiral Count
Von Spee. It was the same squadron
that met and defeated the tsntisn
squadron under Sir Christopher Craddock
off the coast of Chili on November
1. In that fight the British cruisers
Monmouth and Good Hope went
down with about 1 500 men Admiral
Craddock also went down with his
ship. Since then British and Japanese
squadrons have been scouring the seas
for the Germans. Besides the vessels
named the German squadron included
the Dresden and Xurnburg. These two
got away more or less badly damaged
and the official report published Wednesday
stated that they were being
pursued. The Scharnhorst and Gneisenau
were each of 11 600 tons displacement.
450 feet in length and were
armed with 8.2 inch and 6 inch guns.
Together they carried about 1 600 men.
The Leipsic was 241 feet long, of 2.250
tons displacement and carried 286
men. She carried 10 4.1 inch guns,
several ten pounders, some machine
guns and a torpedo tube. There is no
mention in the dispatches as to the
number or power of the British ships
engaged in the action. In addition to
the German vessels sunk, two colliers
were captured. The report says that
some of the German sailors were rescued.
but as no mention is made of Admiral
Von Spee, the inference is that
he went down with his ship.

YORKVILLE, S. O.t
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1914
Let us look at things with broad lib- I
erality, and get rid of contemptible I
littleness. There 1b too much of this
contemptible littleness, anyway.
Bet you that when the southern
cotton crop gets out of the hands of I
the producers there will be a further
loosening up of Federal reserve discounts.
What you bet?
The only way to get rid of liquor in
South Carolina is to vote statewide
prohibition. The time was when it I
could be said with truth that such
action would amount to but little; but I
it cannot now be denied that a prohibition
majority at the polls would
make the state as dry as a powder
horn.
They have killed Congressman Hen- I
ry's bill to put 1250,000,000 of especi-l
ally authorized currency into south-1
ern banks for the purpose of relieving I
the cotton situation. The effect of
this measure would have been to en-1
able the producer to get his fair share
of the profit on his product. Of course
it would have made it harder on I
the fellow who is calculating on thel
big profit he expects to make out of I
the crop under present conditions, and I
for that reason it is "bad finance."
If all the southern congressmen
will give their attention to the South
Carolina state warehouse law and call I
the attention of their constituents I
thereto, they will do the south more
good than is promised by all the tariff I
laws that have been prepared since I
the foundation of the government.
What the southern representatives
want to do is secure the establishment
of warehouses and then get
down to the work of seeing that cotton
gets the treatment to which it is
entitled at the hands of the Federal
reserve system. J
Here is an important statute which, I
so far as The Enquirer is able to learn,
Is not observed in York county:
Each county officer shall be required
to purchase and keep in his office open
to public inspection during office hours,
a book in which shall be kept an item-1
ized account of all moneys received by I
or due him, whether received by him I
or due him as salary, fees or costs, or
in any other manner, as pay >o him for I
services Dy virtue 01 ma umvc. *??vided,
That nothing herein shall be
contrued to require any officer to demand
of payment of his fees and costs
in advance. At the close of each fiscal
year each county officer shall transmit
an itemized copy of said account, under
oath, to the office of county supervisor.
There is very little American cotton
being shipped to Germany. There is
no authentic information that any
cotton whatever has reached a German
port. England said she had no
objection; but there is reason to believe
that she only gave that out for
the effect it would have on American
sentiment. She knew that there were
no ships available, or that the available
ships were too few to be of consequence.
She knew also that because
of mines and war conditions generally,
insurance rates would be prohibitive.
If the United States govern
ment would assert Itself, Germany
would have no trouble In getting all
the American cotton she needs.
An interview that Irvin S. Cobb, the
well known correspondent, has had
with Lord Kitchener, has been exciting
world-wide interest during the past
ten days. The interview was published
in the Saturday Evening Post, and
it is a masterpiece from a journalistic
standpoint. Among other things Lord
Kitchener is quoted as saying that the
interview is false; that he did not say
what Mr. Cobb quotes him as saying.
The most objectionable declaration
quoted represents Kitchener as saying
that the war will last three years or
more and that England will certainly
win in the end. The public is not so
incredulous at the opinion that the war
will last three years as it is at Lord
Kitchener's assuming to say how the
fortunes of the belligerents will turn
out aner so long a unit*.
As to whether it is desirable to appoint
a whisky constable in York
county is now a question. Upon the
death of the late James F. Jackson,
Governor Blease was officially advised
that it was hardly necessary to appoint
his successor. The argument
was that the work the constable was
doing could as readily be done by the
magistrates and their constables,
whose salaries had been increased
with that understanding. It was because
of the representations referred
to that Governor Blease refrained
from making the appointment. The
reasons for not making the appointment
are as good now as they were
then. There is plenty of liquor selling
going on in Yorkville, as in other
parts of the county, and it should be
stopped; but as to whether the ap
- . e .. ?i?I
poinuiieni ui a ?|icnai vuusiauiv
will materially help the situation is
an open question. The municipal authorities,
including magistrates, mayors,
police and constables, could do a
great deal more than they are doing.
We are reproducing today a statement
that Warehouse Commissioner
McLaurin has made to the managers
of state warehouses, and we commend
it to the cartful consideration of all <f
our readers who are interested in business
and finance. The subject .Mr. McLaurin
is discussing is one of tremendous
importance to cotton producers
and business people generally; but at
the same time about which a large
per cent of the people who ought to
know, and who are supposed to know
have a very little actual knowledge. In
matters like this the masses of our
o t-A ttpnnti tn era nat far i n _
pru|7ir air *uv p?un? vw p?vr, v
formation but for instruction, to the
people who know or ought to know.
and take what is told them without
even trying to understand. Mr. McLaurin
is trying to make the financial
"mystery" clear to the people so they
may understand for themselves, and
people who will read what he has to
say carefully, studiously and understanding^
will be well repaid for their
labor. What our people need in the
present circumstances is not so much
somebody to do for them; but to understand
thoroughly what can be done
and what should be done. Mr. McLaurin's
admirable article is well along
this line, and it is worthy of the most
careful consideration of all who would
take the trouble to inform themselves
of the matters that are made plain in
this article.
By continuing the planting of cotton
under existing conditions, the
south is slowly and surely falling
back into the old condition of financial
and commercial servitude. Of course
cotton Is an absolutely necessary
crop, more indlspensible today than It
has ever been, and the demand for it in
Europe right now is almost as great
as the demand for bread. Russia is
getting in some American cotton by
way of Siberia and paying thirty-one
cents a pound for it. But we should
remember that there are other things
to be considered. The commercial element
of America as a whole; understands
the present opportunity perfectly.
It knows the value of the
American cotton crop in gold, and It
is going to get that value; but it is
not especially interested in having the
southern farmer reap all the profit, or
any large part of the same. If it were
interested in this proposition, It would
act differently. But the game is to
get the cotton out of the hands of the
producers at the lowest possible prices,
and then let the big profits go to the
investors. As things are now, the majority
of the producers have a poor
way of helping themselves, and about
the only thing in sight is for them to
hold on to their cotton where they can,
and then try to make a living by tne
production of food crops. If the whole
south could and would cut out cotton
next year, It would win this game, and
each individual farmer is going to
win In proportion to the extent that
he is able to substitute other crops for
cotton.
Federal Reserve Money.
The following correspondence explains
itself fully:
Bank of Clover, December 9, 1914.
Editor Yorkville Enquirer:
Noting in The Enquirer today that
you have seen no Federal Reserve
money In the south up to this time, we
beg to hand you herewith a Five Dollar
note, which we have charged to
your, account provided you are willing
to accept it at Its face value.
The Twenty Dollar notes have
Cleveland's picture instead of Lincoln's;
but at present, I think, money
with Lincoln's picture will pass even in
the south.
We have quite a quantity of this
money on hands, and if you wish to
send out a few notes as Christmas
presents to your friends, we will be
glad to supply you.
Yours Respectfully.
M. L. Smith, President.
Yorkville, S. C., December 10, 1914.
Mr. M. L. Smith,
tresiaeiu Dana ot ^juver.
Dear Mr. Smith:
We have your favor of yesterday,
and beg leave to thank you for your
thoughtfulness In sending the Five
Dollar Federal Reserve note.
Because of the confidence we have In
the benefits that will ultimately come
to our whole country by reason of the
establishment of the new system, we
greet the sight of this handsome note
with especial pleasure.
The only present concern we have is
as to how quickly these notes may be
made available for the payment of
debts, the stimulating of trade, and
dispelling the financial stringency that
is now bearing so oppressively upon
the farmers and merchants throughout
our splendid country.
We are glad indeed to know that
you have quite a quantity of these
notes on hand, and beg leave to congratulate
you on your enterprise in securing
them, notwithstanding that we
know that this enterprise is characteristic
of you. We submit, however, that
you can and will make better use of
these notes by lending them to the
farmers, merchants and other mudsills
of productive industry, than we could
make of such a few as we have at our
special order by giving them away as
Christmas presents. And along the
same line, we will remark that after
keeping the one you sent us a few days
for the pleasure of those who desire to
see it, we will again start it along its
way in the performance of its true and
proper mission of paying debts and
helping along trade.
Thanking you again, we are
Very respectfully.
Editor Yorkville Enquirer.
Merchant Marine.
Many readers of The Enquirer will
remember how twelve or fourteen
years ago, this paper argued, urged
and implored the establishment of a
United States merchant marine, how
we begged for it any old way, by
means of subsidy, by government
ownership, or other means. Just so
we had American ships to develop
and take care of American trade, and
how the News and Courier, Columbia
State and certain other papers,
sought to oppose our teachings by
means of ridicule and otherwise.
As we remember, the old Charlotte
Chronicle, and to a less extent, the
Observer, were about the only papers
that sympathized with us and tried to
help along the same propaganda.
About the only "argument" that was
used against any of us was that the
ship subsidy idea was "subversive of
Democratic principles," paternalistic
ana me line, ana n. wus n?iy insinuated
that we were all Inclined to Republicanism.
Now, just suppose there had been
a really serious effort to develop an
American merchant marine in those
days! Before now, our maratime
trade would be fairly established in
all parts of the earth, and so far as
we would be concerned, the only thing
about that great war in Europe that
would worry us would be the horror
of it all.
Although we desire it understood
that we have never had any doubts
or misgivings as to our position in
the matter, it is with some little satisfaction
that we now quote the testimony
of our Democratic president.
In his message to congress last Tuesday,
Mr. Wilson said:
To speak plainly, we have grossly
erred in the way in which we have
stunted and hindered the development
of our merchant marine. And now,
when we need ships, we have not
got them. We have year alter year
debated, without end or conclusion,
the best policy to pursue with regard
to the use of the ores and forests and
water powers of our national domain
in the rich states of the west, when
we should have acted: and they are
still locked up. The key is still turned
upon them, the door shut fast at
wnicn mousanus ui visukius men,
full of initiative, knock clamorously
for admittance. The water power of
our navigable streams outside the national
domain also, even in the eastern
states where we have worked
and planned for generations, is still
not used as it might be, because we
will and we won't: because the laws
we have made do not intelligently
balance encouragement against restraint.
We withhold by regulation.
I have come to ask you to remedy '
and correct these mistakes and ommisslons,
even at this short session of a
congress which would certainly seem
to have done all the work that could J
reasonably be expected of it. The
time and the circumstances are extraordinary,
and so must our efforts j
be also.
Fortunately, two great measures,
finely conceived, the one to unlock ]
with proper safeguards, the sources
of the national domain, the other to
encourage the use of the navigable
waters outside that domain for the
generation of power, have already ]
-lAAOArl tUn Kauqo nf ronrnoonto tlvpa
paOOCU illV tlVUOV V* W|/? VWWMVW.. . |
and are ready for immediate consid-1
eration and action by the senate. I
With the deepest earnestness I urge i
their prompt passage. In them both
we turn our backs upon hesitation
and makeshift and formulate a genuine
policy of use and conservation, in (
the best sense of those words. We
owe the one measure not only to the
people of that great western country
for whose free and systematic devel- g
opment, as it seems to me, our legislation
has done so little, but also to
the people of the nation as a whole;
and we as clearly owe the other in
fulfillment of our repeated promises
that the water power of the country
should in fact as well as in name be a
put at disposal of great industries (
which can make economical and ^
profitable use of it, the right of the
public being adequately guarded the
while, and monopoly in the use prevented.
To have begun such meas- 1
ures and not complete them would I
Indeed mar the record of this con- e
gress very seriously. I hope and confidently
believe that they will be completed.

the United States government to buy
these ships Itself, as the bill now before

Three Times as Much.
Speaking of* the increase In the
amount of wheat and oats sown in this
vicinity this fall, a Yorkville merchant
said Wednesday that in his opinion the
increase is something like 300 per cent.
This merchant usually disposes of 4
eight or nine hundred bushels of seed
oats each year, and up to this season,
most of that seed oats has been bought
from without the state. Continuing the
merchant said that the decrease in his
sales was due largely to the fact many
farmers in the communltv raised a
large surplus of grain themselves and
have been disposing of this surplus to
other farmers. He was absolutely sure,
hnwpvpr that the aereaee devoted to
wheat and oats in this community is
three times as large as last year. ^
In the Hail District.
A gentleman of Rock Hill, who has
considerable farming interests in the
hail district of Ebenczer and Catawba

the July hail storm he planted
a large acreage in corn and "My, but it >4
was certainly fine and it did look
good," he said "At the time I thought
proper, I had it cut and shocked. Last
week's rain just about ruined my
wholo crop. When cut, the com owing
to its quick growth, was not fully
cured and I was depending on the
shocking to finish the curing. Examination
since the rain shows that the
com is rotten?the cob has turned blue
and is rotten through. I put mv negroes
on it at once to shuck out the corn and
pick out the best part of it; but I
doubt if it will be lit to feed to mules
and horses, and hardly think any of it
will do for hogs, even."
