Hick's Forecasts for December.
The month opens warmer with reac?
tionary storms due about the full moon
on the 2nd. Much colder, with heavy
westerly gales from about 2nd to 4th?
beginning in the west by the 2nd, and
reaching the east by the 4th. Mean?
time the Vulcan period will begin its
work in the far west with rising tem?
perature, falling barometer, south
winds, then storms. From about the
5th to 9th the storms of rain and snow
will make their transit across the con?
tinent from west to east. See if there is
a tendency in the storms to center
about moon's last quarter and Perigee
on the 9th. Another cold wave will
bring up the rear of this period.
The effect of the December solstice
will begin about tie 9th, as shown by
the earth's brace in the storm diagram.
From this time to near the close of the
month there will be a constant ten?
dency to storms and threatening
weather. But few causes bear on the
month, but winter solstice alone assures
us of many storms, especially on the
high seas. About the 12th and 13th,
look for warmer, with squalls and visi?
tations of rain and snow. The cold
dash behind the storms will be of short
duration, as the storm period begin?
ning on the 16th is ushered in by a new
moon. The indications are that about
that date it will be quite warm, and
tbat heavy Stomas, turning to snow,
will set in promptly, and cross the
country to the east before the ?Qth. A
severe cold wave will fall in behind
the storms, beginning in the northwest
almost simultaneously with the storms.
The 23d and 24th are reactionary
centers, around which will gather
warmer temperature, ending in more
storms of rain and snow, and followed
by a cold wave for Christmas. Decem
