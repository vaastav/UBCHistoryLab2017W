New York Herald n lire all. )
Wn?liini;1on, D. C., Dec. H. (
President Harding, In his annual
message, delivered in person before a
.ioint session of the House and Senate
to-day, outlined a definite policy
n vital domestic problems, including
i he adoption of a permanent tariff
Jew, and indicated his belief that the
arms conference will accomplish results
which will gratify the whole
world.
' The President's message was heard
not alone by members of Congress and
citizens of this country. Many foreign
diplomats, including all the delegates
to the armament conference, were
present in the House chamber. The
message dealt in part with questions
which affect European nations, especially
the plan of funding the war
debts owed this country, and the
method by which this nation hopes to
spur on the war torn nations toward
normal conditions.
Pecnuse of its fnr renehing effect on
nil Industries the President is anxious
to have the new tariff bill adopted as
speedily as possibte. 11a threw out the
uggestion that as a means to avoid the
delays and vexations In Congress Incident
to the passage o" such a measure it
would be a wise plan to grant more
power to the Tariff Commission. He
argued that that body could prepare a
scientific tariff schedule, but owing to
the unsettled condition of the business
world, not only In this country but In
Europe, he urged that the Executive b-oinpowered
to raise or lower the tariff
schedules within specified limits to
tabilllze business and avoid injustices.
Suggestions ot Importance.
Tn addition to the tariff recommenda ions
there arc three suggestions of
greatest importance to the nation. These
ire the President's proposal for the control
of national strikes and Federal
ictivlty in dealing with Industrial war *rc;
lending a strong arm to American
shipping and creating cooperative and
distributing ngenck-a for helping the
American farmer.
The President's comment on the
\merican valuation plan was followed
with keen Interest. His qualified approval
of the Idea has seriously endangered
its chance of adoption.
While Mr. Harding did not discuss In
detail the plan to fund tho foreign wJr
debt, his suggestions that the President
be authorized to go ahead with negotiations
probably will be carried out at an
early date by Congress, and that mooted
subject will be started on the way to a
satisfactory solution.
Applause from both Democrats and
Republicans greetea tne i'residents proposal
for a constitutional amendment to
end the Issue of tax free Federal, State
and municipal bonds.
His recommendation that Congress
appropriate liberally for food and seed
wheat to be sent to the starving millions
in Russia also stirred his audience to
enthusiastic handclapping.
The scene In the House chamber when
the President delivered his message was
Inspiring and unusual. In the front row
sat the foreign diplomat* and derogates
to the arms conference. Tn a small section
to themselves on the Republican
side were seated the members of the
Cabinet, and the members of the Senate
occupied tho seats right back of the
foreigners.
Establishing a precedent, fifty foreign
correspondents attending the arms conference
occupied chairs on the floor In
the vacant space back of the regular
seats on the Democratic side.
n?mrn nominate uaueries.
The galleries were filled to overflowing
by an animated group, p .weou'dy
K i-vncd women predominating, giving
color and plcturerqueness to the scene.
<tf course, the gallery occupied by Mrs.
Harding wan the cynosure of all eyes.
Site was accompanied by the Under Secreta?>
ot State and Mrs. Henry P.
KVtofirr. Brlg.-Oen. and Mrs. Sawyer,
Miss Laura Harlan and Judeon C. Welllver.
Mrs. Alice Longworth sat a few
eats ?wck of Mrs. Harding.
}b\.??.ely at II o'clock the gallery
floors were thrown open and there was a
grand rush for seats by the holders of
tickets. Soon every available seat wan
taken and crowds Htood at the open
doors. The Cabinet members, headed by
Secretary of State Hughes, arrived n
1f:t5 and received a royal welcome
from the members of the Hou?c and I he
crowd In the galleries. A few minutes
'afer the foreign diplomats and delegates
to the arms conference arrived,
which was the occasion for another outburst
of applause.

In reply to questions, he declared
1 that If the South were going to continue
hostile "it would be better to have It
out now," but If the South really Intended
to act with friendliness, that
would put a different complexion on

LovnoTV, Doc. <5 (Associated Press).
-The centuries old quarrel between
England and Ireland was ended in
he small hours of Tuesday morning
>y the signature in the Primo Misuser's
Cabinet room of "a treaty beween
Great Britain and Inland,"
onsisting of eighteen articles, giving
reland the title of the Irish Free
State and the same constitutional
tatus as Canada, Australia and other
iverseas dominions
The question of allegiance, which
ip to the last moment threatened to
vreck the negotiations, was surnounted
by permitting the members
if the Irish Parliament to swear alegiance
to the constitution of tho
rish Free State and "he faithful to
lis Majesty the King."
The treaty has yet to run the
mntlet of the Ulster government and
