SO THIRD PARTY.
_____* Geobge announces with all
the emphasis of his emphatic nature
that he will not he the labor candidate
for president next year. Nor does Mr.
George stop there, for he expresses
with equal emphasis the opinion that
there will be no labor ticket in the field.
The scales have fallen from Mr.
G___tE ? eyes. lie now sees what he
ought to have seen long ago. that the
labor element cannot promote the in
terests of labor by forming itself into a
distinct political organization. It is ap
parent to every discerning mind that
whatever reforms are to be worked out
in the near future must be done through
the instrumentality of one of the exist
ing political parties. Which one of
them it shall be depends largely
on the way the laboring classes
look at it. Their choice is between the
Democratic and Republican parties, and
they must rely on their own intelligence
to determine which party offers the
greatest promise for the labor interest.
To a man of Mr. George's intelligence
and thorough information on questions
of political economy, there ought to be
no hesitation in reaching the conclusion
that the Democratic parly, under the
leadership of Cleveland, presents the
only hope for the lain-ring classes.
Twenty-live years of Republican su
premacy resulted in building up that
vast system of monopoly which eventu
ally became labor's oppressor, and which
would have resulted in subduing the
workingmen to a most deplorable
condition of vassalage but for the
timely restoration of the Democracy to
power. There is now such a well de
fined issue between the two leading
parties, and one which involves the in
terests of labor in so direct a manner,
there can be no justifiable pretext for
a third party movement. The issue is a
simple question of whether we are to
have a government for the many ac-
cording to Democratic principles, or
whether it is to be a government for the
favored few according to the Republi
can idea. It ought not to take a work
ingman long to make up his mind ou
which side of this question he will
align himself.
_»
TWO STATEMENTS.
Two significant statements have been
made of late. One is to the effect that
there are in New YorK at present 100.
--000 people out of employment. The
other is that the wealthy people of the
metropolis are preparing for a winter's
social campaign on a grander scale than
ever before, and that the amount of
money that will be spent in the pursuit
of pleasure will reach the millions.
Already several journals of socialistic
tendencies have been commenting on
the fact in words of fiery denunciation,
and have made a comparison of the two
statements the basis of a deduction that
it is just such an unevenly balanced
condition of things that justifies the ex
treme doctrines of socialism and an
archism. This is a misleading asser
tion.
So long as it is possible for some peo
ple to pile up great fortunes, while
cithers must earn their daily bread by
the sweat of their brows, discontent will
exist on the part of the latter and econ
omist-, will be prolific in theories for
changing the existing order ot things.
Admirable though their object, is they
will continue to fail in achieving it.
Since then, under the existing order of
things great wealth must exist, it is
well that it should be expended, and in
its expenditure it must naturally occur
that a vast number of m-ople is bene
fited.
So that, even though it might prop
erly be desired that the wealth of the
metropolis be more evenly distributed, it
is a matter of congratulation that some
portion ol it at least will be expended
in a way that will give employment to
some of those who now find the problem
Of existence a very* serious one indeed.

A WISE MOVE.
The Pennsylvania legislature has
made a wise move in appointing a comm
ission to inquire into the advisability
of introducing industrial education into
the public schools of that state. Manual
ration is bound to become a dis
tinctive feature of popular instruction
in the near future. Of its desirability
there can be no question.
A growing evil in this country.it is
frequently asserted, is to be found in
the fact that the children of parents in
straightened circumstances must either
cut short their time of school attend
ance in order to acquire knowledge of
some trade by which they can gain a
livelihood, or else, foregoing instruction
of that meter while receiving men
tal training, finish their school course
without gaining even a rudimentary
acquaintance with some method of sell
support. If there could be a combina
tion of the two kinds of instruction, if
while his mental power were being de
veloped a boy could at the same time lit* |
taught, o use the tools of the artisan, the
evil complained of would disappear. M
It would not then bo necessary . for a
boy to spend several years after finish
ing hi- school course in learning how to
make his own living. He would be
qualified to enter the workshop or the
manufactory at once. 'Without having
been debarred from any opportunity for
mental culture he would be trained to
make himself not only independent, but
a useful member" of the community.
Though, of course, he would not be an
experienced workman, he would have
attained sufficient, proficiency in his
chosen trade to insure his employment,
and with a thorough foundation, but a
brief practice would be required to make
him as good a journeyman as the best.
The Pennsylvania experiment will be
watched with all the more interest by
educators in this state because of the
fact that Minnesota has also given the
subject of industrial training some little
attention. The matter is bound to claim
a good deal of public attention before
lons, and it is well that Minnesota
should take an advanced position re
garding it. ..c :.:.*.":
THAT BUILDING RECORD.
The more one studies St. Paul's build
ing record for the past year, published
in yesterday's Globe, the more con
vinced does he become that tbe city
possesses all the elements of solid pros
perity. The figures are themselves an
argument in favor of the solid condi
tions of 'the city which .cannot be re
futed. In comparison with the record
of other years the building statistics of
this year show a phenomenal growth,
even under most favorable conditions.
But when it is remembered that this
growth was attained in the face of em
barrassments and opposing conditions
of » most serious character, the record
becomes an absolute marvel.
It must be borne in mind that the
Globe's estimate, which Kings the
building record for the year up to the
splendid total of *11,5_,314, is an ex
ceedingly conservative one. Owing to
the fee system in the building inspect
or's office, which regulates the fee for
a building permit in proportion to the
estimated cost of the building, builders
as a rule make it a point to fix a low
estimate on the building they propose
to erect, in many cases not fixing the es
timate at more than 50 per cent of the
actual cost, and rarely, if ever, at over
To per cent. The Globe added the
minimum per cent to the figures ob
tained from the inspector's office, which
brought up the total to the eleven
millions and a half. It is a fair suppo
sition that another million might hay-*!
been added and yet have been within
the limit of the actual amount that has
been expended on buildings this year.
There is another point in the record
worthy of consideration. The great
bulk of the total amount has been ex
pended within the city limits, and the
result of the expenditure is to be seen
in as handsome business blocks and res
idences as ever ornamented a city.
While beautiful suburban villages have
sprung up around us. and manufactur
ing plants, and stockyards and slaughter
houses have been established, still over
19,000,000 of the total expenditure have
been expended right here in the heart
of the city.
The backward spring, the labor strike
and the depression in the Eastern money
markets formed a combination of cir-
cumstances that would have been ruin
ous to the building record of any city
that did not rest on a basis of prosper
ity too solid to be affected by extrane
ous causes or conditions. ' The fact that
in the face of all these adverse circum
stance-* St. Paul shows up at the end of
the year with a building record in ex
cess of any former year, and far in ex
cess of any other city in the world of
equal population, is a most gratifying
assurance that there is to be no limit to
our city's future development. Those
of us who live here are made to feel
that we have built upon a rock
that cannot be shaken. Persons
away from here who desire to Invest
their capital where it will not be im
periled by the fluctuating conditions
which menace other cities will now
turn with longing eyes toward St. Paul.
The evidence of solidity which this
years building statistics present will
convince them that every dollar in
vested in St. Paul will be as safe as if
invested in a government bond, and ten
fold more productive.

HE WON'T COME.
Rev. Mr. Bi.i:i:v won't come over to
this country to accept the pastorate of
Plymouth church, and he is right. With
home associations, as liberal pecuniary
inducements and as broad a field <_* use
fulness in England, it could hardly have
been expected that he would cross the
water to become a stranger in a strange
land. But aside from this fact Ply
mouth church erred in inviting Mr.
Bi:i:i:y to minister to its spiritual needs.
No man who is not by long years of ob
servation thoroughly acquainted with
American institutions and the condi
tions of life in this country can touch
those sympathetic chords a knowledge
of which is essential to a successful
i preacher.
By the very nature nature of things
Mr. I'.i.nr.v. however able he may be,
would have found himself out of sym
pathy with a congregation as essentially
American as is that ot Plymouth church.
There have been numerous importa
tions of foreign ministerial talent to this
country, but it is hardly possible to re
call an instance where the experiment
has been attended with immediate or
conspicuous success. There has always
been a failure to thoroughly appreciate
the American way of looking at things,
and a consequent failure in accomplish
ing the greatest possible degree of use
fulness.
Not only that, but there is another
reason why Plymouth church should
look at home for a successor to _______
It is a matter of general conviction that
the average of pulpit talent in this
country is higher than that of every
foreign land. At very *B 'on wl en
ministers of the gospel from this coun
try have assembled with their brethren
in other lands, the palm of superiority
has been conceded to those who claim
America as their home. Notably was
this the case at the Pan-Presbyterian
council held in Edinburgh ten years
ago. Speaking generally, ministers are
nearer the people in this country, and
are consequently more capable of de
villing their spiritual needs.
Though in finding a successor to
_______ who will not inevitably suf
fer by comparison with his great pred
ecessor Plymouth church has a dif
ficult task, it stands a better chance of
success by confining its attention to
home talent than by looking abroad.
Mr. Bi:i:i:v"s refusal of the invitation
tendered him may serve as a hint of that
fact. And it certainly should.' t "Kit
PROTECTING PURCHASERS.
A number of prominent Minnesota
gentlemen recently forwarded a peti
tion to the interior department asking
for a __________ of the departmental
order vacating the withdrawal of cer
j tain lands within the indemnity limits
of the Northern Pacific railroad, in
order that the rights of bona fide pur
chasers from said railway company
might be properly protected, . In a letter
to Hon. J. L. MacDoxald, Acting
Secretary Mi i.dkow refers to anopin-
THE : SADsT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13, 18S7.
ion of Attorney*. General Ga_,_a_d
dated the lTtli of November, and de
partmental ; instructions i to «. the .: gen
eral land office dated the 2_
of November, to show that the
rights of bona fide purchasers j
will be properly* protected. In the
opinion referred to Attorney General
_▲■____) holds that three classes of
persons are provided for by the act of
the 3d of March, 1887, to wit: "First,
bona fide settlers whose homestead or
pre-emption entries have been errone
ously canceled on account of a railroad
grant or withdrawal : second, bona fide
purchasers of such unclaimed lands; j
_______ fide settlers residing thereon; j
the rights of the several classes to the j
land referred to being successive in the
order stated in the section. The attor
ney general says: "The first in right
is the homestead or pre-emption settler
whose entry has been wrong
fully canceled. If he elects
to assert his right, and has not been dis
qualified by locating another claim or
making another entry in lieu of the en
try erroneously canceled, his right is
absolute, and the successive rights of
the remaining two classes cannot attach
if he lawfully asserts his claim. If he
fail to claim the land, or is disqualified
under the acl, the second class of per
sons, who are bona fide purchasers of the
land unclaimed by him, attach, and have I
precedence over the third class." The j
bona fide purchasers here referred to I
are defined by the attorney general to
be those who, "without >. knowledge |
of wrong or error, have purchased from j
the railway company lands which have j
been previously entered by a pre-emp- !
tion or homestead settler whose entry .
has been erroneously canceled, as de- j
scribed in the first clause of the third i
section, and which land the pre-emption !
or homestead settler did not elect to ]
claim after the recovery by the proceed- i
ings prescribed by the second section of
the act."'
In accordance with this decision the
secretary issued instructions to the gen
eral land office, under date of Nov. •_!.
directing that a report be made to the
interior department of all cases coming I
within the scope of this net. in order
that the proper steps may be taken j
to protect bona fide settlers by confining i
to them the title to their lands, which
will be done upon proof of the purchase
and that the purchaser has the qualifica
tions required by the act, without re- |
quiring of the purchaser any further
payment to the government of the pur- j
chase price of said land.

DRAMATIC NOTES.
It was an ambitious undertaking for a
young actress with less than three
cats' Stags experience to undertake
the interpretation of the leading role in
a play written by the greatest French
dramatist— and a part. too. that the great
Be_xuai:dt had made famous.
But Miss Olcott'si production of
"Theodora" at the Grand last night is
ample vindication of her faith in her
own histrionic ability. As an artistic
piece of dramatic work her impersona
tion of the character is superb. There
is an ease and grace in her style, an
absolute freedom from strain, without
any apparent attempt at staginess. She
gives the part she is playing an intense
realism. MissOi. < _t"> interpretation
of "Theodora"' is different from Beiix
iiaudt'.s in this: the latter portrays
her as the royal courtesan, while Miss
Olcott brings out the finer and better
touches of this remarkable woman's
nature. Miss Olcott plays Theodora
the queen, proud of the position she
has won, imperious in manner,
yet the victim of a tender passion which
tills every woman's heart, It is difficult
to tell where Miss Oi.cott is most suc
cessful, whether in the portrayal of the
finer sentiments of Theodora's nature or
\ in the nroud imneriousness of the ■ wo
'■ man conscious that her elevated station
is due alone to her splendid abilities.
The audience was large and com
posed of St. Paul's most cultured peo
ple, In the beginning the audience
seemed to be severely critical, withhold
ing all demonstration of approval until
fully assured that the performance was
meritorious. But by the time the fourth
act was reached, which is one of strong
dramatic power, the pent-up enthusiasm
burst forth, and from that until the end
of the sixth and last act there was no
limit to the applause, and Miss Olcott
had repeated calls before the curtain.
So realistic was the scene in which
Theodora plunges the dagger into the
heart of Marcellus, one lady fainted
and had to be taken out. and in the last
scene, where Theodora is executed by
command of Justinian, several ladies
screamed when the axe was uplifted
above the neck of the lovely but unfor
tunate empress.
The stage_ setting is probably the
most gorgeous that has ever been seen
here in a dramatic performace, and the
costuming is a marvel of magnificence.
Miss Olcott's wardrobe is rich beyond
description. The dress worn in the
first act is an imported Oriental " cos
tume, the others ___ been made in
Paris according to designs furnished
Miss Olcott by Sabdou himself. The
costuming of the whole company is
elegant, and the armors are i made of
solid metal. • .-f._o
Miss Olcott has a good supporting
company. 8 Mr. Colville, in the char
acter of Adrian, Mr. Raixfobd in Jus
tinian, Miss Sta_oish in the charac
: ter of Autonina and Miss . ______ as .

*"- NATIONAL OPERA. .
.L. _". Scott, manager of the Grand
opera house, says, although he cannot
j complain about a -"rushing" business,
yet he would not care to contract to play
"the National Opera company every week
in the year. All day Saturday he was
simply besieged by prominent persons.,
who wanted him to lay aside seats or
boxes for the National opera pefortn
ances* at the Grand opera house next
week. In this way, Mr. Scott says, he
could have marked off at least ..COO
worth of seats before the opening of
the sale ou Wednesday, if '-he '
j cared to break through his stern ;
j rule on the matter of advance sales.
| Mr. Scott wishes it to be distinctly un
derstood that he will not mark off a sin
gle seat from the plan before the sale |
opens to the public on Wednesday morn- -
ing, excepting those always reserved, a- ,
the use of the press. Mr. Scott regret;., !,
. if any advertising on the part of Sir. r
Locke's agent has misled his patron, on !
this point. Orders which have been re
ceived by mall from persons living in
the country only will bo carefully and j
promptly attended to when the line |
breaks on Wednesday. •> .*,
Several persons who are anxious, tot
get as good a selection as possible, j ■
seats for the National opera perform- j,
anee.s next week will have representa
tives iv line outside the Grand opera
house for nearly forty hours before the j
| opening of the sale on Wednesday
I morning at '.» o'clock, which is believed
! to be unprecedented in the history of |
advance sales in this city. As early as
' 0 -o'clock last evening several boys
! were 'found loitering outside... of
I the Grand opera house, who, on :
j being questioned by Manager
i Scott, said they had been engaged by .
! certain people, naming some of the most .
prominent residents of St. Paul, to look
I out for early places in the line Wednes
j day morning. The boys will of course
j be relieved by other watchers from time
j to time. It is confidently expected by
: Manager SCOTT that the rush for Na
tional open seats will exceed any pre
vious sales known at the Grand opera i
house. _

-A CHICAGO BLAZE.
Complete Destruction By Fire of Valu
able Business Property.
A SHOE FIRM BURNED v OUT.
The General Record of Conflagra
tions and Casualties at Vari- -
, . ous Points.
Chicago, Dec. 12.— A threatening
conflagration burst out about 7:45 p. m.
to-night in the very center of the most
i valuable business property in Chicago.
- The flames were first noticed shooting
i trom the windows of the large whole
sale; boot and shoe establishment of
Phelps, Dxlge & Palmer. Their build
ing is located on the coiner of Adams
street and Fifth avenue, directly across
from Marshall Field _ Co.'s warehouse
at.d the general offices of the Chicago,
; Burlington & Quincy Kailroad company.
The location is but a few squares from
the new board of trade, the principal
hotels and the court house, and is sur
rounded on every side by tall, costly
buildings. Thousands of sparks swept
over these, and great crowds of
excited people speedily jammed the
streets. Phelps, Dodge _*'.■ Palmer's es
tablishment occupied a quarter of a
square and was a solid-looking, five
story pile of masonry and iron, but the
upper floor succumbed with astonishing
rapidity. The building was owned by
E. 11. Sheldon. It was put up in I_7
and cost $70,000. The present value is
$100,000. The structure is a total loss
and the goods in it are to be classed
likewise, lt is hard to estimate the loss
on stock. The firm had sold. out their
winter stock and had filled out every
floor with spring goods. Mr. Phelps
estimates his insurance at between
950U.000 and 1600,00. distributed among
a number of companies.
Late to-night it was rumored that the
great lire in Phelps, Dodge & Palmer's
boot and shoe house was attended by
loss of life. It is said that at the time
the flames burst from the build
ing several persons were at work
on the fifth floor and that the rapid
spread of the flames must have cut oft'
all means of escape. The watchman of
the building is missing. The origin of
the fire is a. mystery*' Alter the flames
had mane a good deal oi headway a
loud explosion was heard. Tire Marshal
Sweiiio says he thinks it was a hot air
explosion.*

CONQUERED AND CONQUEROR
The Contempt in Which the Arabs
Hold Their French Rulers.
All the Year Around.
At that ball, as during the whole of
my stay in Algeria, nothing astonished
me more than the evident contempt en
tertained by the conquered for the con
querors, but they seemed inclined to
make no effort to throw off the yoke.
It is as if they felt that they were
conquered, not by the French,
but by some inevitable . fate to
whose "decree they must bow with un
questioned submission. On the other
hand, the efforts which the French
make to conciliate the Arabs are almost
abject in the fervor of :■ their humility.
That evening, if one of the sheiks con
descended to stroll into the bail room,
half a dozen official personages ad
vanced to bid him welcome; the gov
ernor and his wife overwhelmed him
with attention, and a special officer was
told off to walk by his side and give
him any information he might require.
If this "were done in the hope of excit
ing eratitnde it was labor in vain ; the
skelk received the advance of his enter
tainers with stately courtesy, but evi
dently regarded all homage as his just
due.
Nor is it only in the palace that this
extraordinary inversion of the usual re
lationship between the conquered and
the conquerors exists; in the streets,
public assemblies, everywhere, the
same efforts are made by the French
officials to avoid all cause of offense.
The gendarmerie and the soildiers are
literally hidden away in dark nooks and
caves. ' lest their presence should
wound the susceptibilities of the native
race, and on the few occasions when
they must necessarily be brought to the
fore, apparently they receive private in
structions that the Arabs are not to be
(•objected to any of those petty tyran
nies which it so delights the soul of a
Frence official to practice on his own
countrymen.
An amusing instance of this occurred
at the Algiers races a few days after the
ball. A part of the ground near
the grand stand was surrounded
by a red cord, as a sign that the pub
lic wa-. excluded. Through some mis
n_de**s_u_rf_'_ a motely crowd of
Europeans broke down the red cord ami
crowded into the reserve space. The
geiidrrmes, bristling with fury, rode
into their midst, and striking right and
left with perfectly unnecessary violence
drove the people away. Some half hour
later the same thing occurred; again
the red cord fell and a crowd took pos
session of the reserved ground, but
this time the crowd was Arab, evidently
of the poorest class, but a. 'I Arab. 1
expected a repetition of the former
scene, but to my astonishment one
genda.me looked at another, he made a
sign to a third, who looked for direc
tions to a fourth, but no one ventured
to address the intruders.
At length some oflicial of importance
was sent for. and after considerable de
lay, hesitation and consultation, this
person did summon sufficient courage to
ride up to ihe inclosure, but far from
there being any signs of the violence
and abuse to which the Europeans had
been subjected he bowed to the Arabs as
if they were sovereign princes anil he
the most lowly of their subjects. In the
blandest of tones he apologized for dis
turbing them and entered into the most
elaborate explanation of the why and
wherefore of the case, but all his pray
ers and entreaties were in vain. The
Arabs listened to what he said with a
courtesy equal to his own; the staid
gravity of their faces never relaxed, but
move they would not. and did not, and
at length the officer rode away with a
gesture of despair, and gave orders that
they were to lie left in possession of the
ground. -
PURE GROCERIES.
Such Things Exist, but Are Not
':.*-.;. :.'; Readily Found.
o "Hire flour and white meal can be
mingled with white pepper in reasona
ble quantities, and experts in spices
cannot detect it," said a groceryman to
a St. Louis Globe reporter the other
day. "In truth, there is no trade in
which adulterations for pecuniary
profit can be carried on more
profitably and with less chance of
detection than in spices. Terra
alba, a fine marble dust, is exported
from Italy to this country in considera
ble quantities,' to mingle with white
pepper. Mustard mixes with sago flour
and a bit of aniline coloring without
detriment to the appearance of the mus
tard. Treat the mixture with iodine
and you expose the adulteration, but
the "average consumer of mustard
is not apt to apply that test.
The German and French mustards
are an interesting mixture. They
are compounded of cracker dust, must
ard, venue pepper, with vinegar, oil
and sugar flavoring. Old crackers are
sometimes baked brown, then ground
into dust and mixed with ground cinna
mon and nutmeg, and the whole is sold
for nutmeg at a price that drives pure
nutmeg out of the market. Ground
pepper is frequently sold for less money
than the unground article, whi_i
makes the _____ suspicious sus
pect at once that the ground
goods are loaded with pepper
sudt. which is made from . cocoanut
shells, of buckwheat hulls, charcoal,
white meal and mustard bran. Lack of
taste is as desirable in an adulteration
for spices as adaptability of color. For
that reason the cocoanut shell ground
up very line is desirable. Venetian
red, salt and white meal can be ground
together and made into a valuable addi
tion to cayenne pepper. A dull, red
pepper exported from Africa is often
heavily adulterated with that mix
ture. It is worth about 10
cents a pound pure, but when
well adulterated it can be sold to a green
dealer and a green trade for Natal pep
per, worth -i*» cents to 30 cents a pound.
You can buy ground ginger at almost
any store for 7 cents a pound when the
unground is selling at 10 cents. That
means that the goods offered for 7 cents
is a mixture of white meal, starch.
cayenne pepper and mauilla rope, flav
ored with ginger. The trade, especially
the country people, want to see the
gintrer fibres, and the ingenuity of the
dealer supplies them in the form of
threads of mauilla rope."

A PREMIUM ON VICE.
Hospitals in Russia for Rearing
Illegitimate Children.
One of the most lamentable features
in the multitude of sinful practices of
the Russians is the moral support given
to the bearing of illegitimate children,
writes a New York Mail correspondent.
In the eyes of Russia and Russians it
is neither disgraceful nor sinful, nor is
it unlawful for a girl to become a mother
when unmarried. The emperors of old
set the example and fixed the standard
within respectable limits. Catharine
11., who rode horseback like a man and
commanded or reviewed her own troops,
and who likewise committed various in
delicacies during her reign at Moscow,
founded a magnificent hospital. She set
up a code of rules for its government,
and which are in full force to-day, which
simply gives a premium to illegitimate
childbirth. And under the fast and
loose regime of the country it is hardly
necessary to observe that this institution
is well patronized ; not only this one, but
the various others in the country which
have been founded upon a like principle.
At the Moscow hospital alone between
3,000 and 4,000 children find a home an
nually. It is a magnificent structure,
with a dowry from the empire. No
questions are-asked when admission tor
a foundling is desired; and, further
than this, means are provided for not
only receiving the foundlings without
disclosing the identity of the mothers,
but provisions are made for childbirtlis.
There is also a private entrance to this
hospital, where, at an^our of the day
or night, a child may be brought, de
posited in a basket, and, by *, an auto-
I matic process, carried to the reception
room, and the sponsor may depart un
seen and unknown. A ticket is placed
in the basket, stating the date of birth
and the name desired for the infant.
' The : little o one .-is examined, weighed,
registered, taken the chapel and imme
diately baptized and assigned to a nurse,
It is given the best atttention. and can
be taken away after five years by any
one who claims it, and besides receive a
dowry till it becomes of age. If the
child is a female, and is reared in the
hospital till of age or grown, every ef
fort is made to wed it to a creditable
man. She is educated, shown about,
dressed well and receives a dowry at
the marriage altar. YAY V-
Hatching Machines for Babies.
It may not be generally known that
hatching machines have recently been
introduced in the Paris lying- in hos
pitals for the saving of infants prema
turely born or otherwise deficient in
vitality, says the Pall Mall Gazette.
The system appears to have been emi
nently successful. The object of the
machine is to supply the weak little
things with the heat necessary to attain
to strength, and maturity. New-born
babies weighing from two to two and a
half pounds, instead of four and a half
pounds, the average weight, and which
were condemned to early death, have
been placed in these machines, and in a
short time they have come out strong
and healthy. 'The apparatus is similar
to the egg-hatching machine. It is in
the form of a large wooden box, divided
into two compartments: one is filled
with warm water and the other con
tains a basket lined with wadding, into
which the infant is deposited. The lid
Is supplied with a glass pane to enable
the movements of the little inmate to be
watched. The machine is under the
constant surveillance of a nurse, who re
ports to the medical director the various
phases of incubation. Dr. Pinard, of
the LarilH'isiere hospital, and Dr. Tar
nier, of the Maternite, -have several of
these machines working under their
care at the present moment.
Fun in Burniah.
A favorite amusement of the Bur
i mese, not only on saints' days and holi
! days, but on all evenings when a de
| licious breeze permits, is kite dying,
j says the San Francisco Chronicle. These
kites are made of the thin rice paper
common iv the country, pasted oVv?r
split bamboo frames and shaped into
! the forms of various birds and beasts,
; the kalong dragon being a preferred
figure. They believe that the dragon
I at cue period was a common animal, but
! that it has now become extinct. These
j "counterfeit presentments'' are very
l comical and fantastic in appearance,
being colored with a free hand and a
I liberal allowance of the brightest and
| gaudiest shades. The kites ascend to a
I great height, and on a fine night in the
j vicinity of a town or village hundreds
i may be seen in the sky. There is much
I emulation among them as to whose kite
j will take the highest flight. They seem
to have a superstition with regard to
these kites when they are high up in the
air, and attach small paper effigies to
the string, which, as all boys know, will
travel up the kite-string with rapidity.
They call this sending up messengers
to the kalong, or whatever animal is
represented^ Ay. *..'• ...

SENATORIAL GOSSIP.
A Rough Estimate of the Wealth of
Some of Our Senators ~ »
WHO BELONG TO THE CROWD
Lsland Stanford's Big Fortune-John
Sherman's Real Estate Speculations
aud Henry B. Payne's Wealth.]
The election of John S. Barbour, of
Virginia, to the United States senate
will add another rich man to the golden
crowd, says Frank G. Carpenter in a
letter to the New York World. Bar
bour has been a railroad president for
twenty-nine years, and his law practice
has added to his fortune. He lives
nicely at Alexandria, and he had dur
ing his congressional career the lowest
mileage of any man in congress. He
got only _.'._' a year, while one of the
territorial delegates got $1,000, and
probably rode on passes.
„
Speaking of rich men in the senate,
Paddock, of Nebraska, is a millionaire,
and he has made a great deal of money
within the past few years. He paid
$30,000 for 130 acres of land near Omaha
some time ago and held it for a rise.
Five years ago he offered it for sale at
$500 per acre, and could not find a pur
chaser. Now, this land is worth
from $5,000 to $10,000 an
acre. It has been divided . up in
lots and Paddock has sold about .100,
--000 of these, and has 150 lots left. Then
he has a big pressed-brick building in
Omaha, which rents, I am told, for
about ?*?CO a month, and at his home in
Beatrice, Neb., he has a 300-acre farm
which is nearly surrounded by the city.
He has sold $100,000 worth of city lots
off it, and has nearly the whole of the
200 acres left. He is one of the richest
men of Southern Nebraska, and he has
a large interest in the Omaha Cable
company, in the Omaha Street Car com
pany, in banks at Beatrice, and in other
quarters. This makes the second for
tune he has made since he went AVest.
A friend of his tells me that he was rich
a few years ago, but that at Jay Gould's
advice he went into Wall street and be
fore he got out lost the bulk of his for
tune, lie held on to his real estate,
however, and his faith in Western prop
erty has made him rich.
* *
A rough estimate of senatorial for
tunes made by one of the senators is as
follows: Paddock, of Nebraska, is
worth $ 1,500.000. made in real estate and
stock speculation. Joe Brown, of Geor
gia, is worth -54,000,000, made in real
estate and the careful investments of a
lifetime. Don Cameron has $4,000,000. a
large part of which is in railroad stocks,
and some of which he has made out of
real estate. John C. Spooner is worth,
perhaps, $150,000. Leland Stanrord is
supposed to be worth $75,000,000, and
the bulk of it conies from the Central Pa
cific railroad. Stewart.of Nevada, wants
t__S__l for his house on Dupont cir
cle, and he is probably a millionaire.
Stockbridge. the new man from Michi
gan, is a millionaire. Palmer is worth
$4,000,000 in lumber, salt and specula
tion. David Turpie is worth SIOOJIOO.
ZebulOn V acce, of South Carolina, mar
ried, it is said, some money with his
present wife, and he has 3,000 acres in
his country seat near Asheviile, N. C.
Neither Vest nor Voorhees are rich.
Walthall made $10,000 a year before he
came to the senate as a railroad lawyer,
and his fortune is probably under $100,
--000. The two Wilsons, of lowa and
Maryland, are in comfortable circum
stances. Philetus Sawyer has almost a
dollar for every atom of his big frame,
and he is worth about . 1,000,000.
My senatorial friend says that John
Sherman was worth a million before
Washington real estate began to rise
five years ago. and that he now has $500,
--000 more. Mat Ransom' of North Caro
lina, is poor, but honest. Pasco, of
Florida, is comfortably well off, and
Henry B. Payne is worth "5>.000,000. the
foundation of which is built upon oil,
stocks and real estate. Cullom. of Illi
nois, is not worth any more than when
he entered politics." and he says that
politics ruins a man's money-making
qualities. Allison, of lowa, is worth
several hundred thousand dollars, much
of which came from his wife. Beck, of
Kentucky, is a millionaire, and his
wife's estate, which included some of
the lands surveyed by George Washing
ton. who was a "relative of her ancestors,
brought a part of this wealth. Joe
Blackburn is happy, though he is not
