CONTENDS
JUDGMENT
IS ILLEGAL
Contending that a Judgment en
tered In the circuit court by Judge
Burnett sentencing Frances Rob
erts and Louis Martinez to the peni
tentiary without limitation of time
and without designating the crime
for which they are sentenced, Is
void, Wm. . P. Lord, Jr., today ap
peared before the supreme court and
asked for their release on habeas
corpus proceedings.
The two Incarcerated men are
Mexicans and they were arrested
last spring by Sheriff Harry P. Mln
to on the charge of shoplifting.
When arraigned before Judge Bur
nett they pleaded guilty and were
sentenced to the state penitentiary.
The Judgment does not designate
the crime for which they are sen
tenced, nor does it fix a term, but
sentences them to the state prison
"without limitation of time."
'Illegal," Says Lord.
Attorney Lord questions In tha
first place whether any sentence
reading without limitation of tlnv"
Is legal but concedes that was thi
crime for which sentence was im
posed mentioned In who Judgment
that It might be as the wardon
could then ascertain the penalty by
looking up the law on the subject.
With the ' crime eliminated, he
would have nothing to guide him,
however, and therefore, he is con
vinced the judgment is void.
The case is the first to be insti
tuted under the new Judicial act
giving the supreme court original
jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro
ceedings and was afgued this afternoon.

Melbourne, Dec. 6. From a dis
trict in Western Australia earlier 'n
the present year, a station master
made a report to the government
authorities which . aroused much
speculation In official circles. He
declared that off the coast he had
seen a number of strange steamers,
in appearance resembling wurshlps.
which he Judged were engaged In
currying out maneuvers. Beyond
the speculation aroused by the story,
nothing developed and the matter
was forgotten. Now it has been re
vived, however. The mysterloiu
warships have been seen again fur
ther to the north of tbelr last re
ported appearance. The matter has
been placed before the defense de

New York, Dec. 6. Commenting
on President Taft's message to con
gress, J. S. Bache and company,
bankers, issued the following state
ment: "We do not see much comfort In
the message except that it has th?
merit of not being radical. The
president devotes as much space to
Captain Peary as he does to the
whole subject of banking and cur
rency reform. There Is nothing In
the message to relieve the business
community or help to upbuild con
fidence in capital."

today. It wa Intimated that the
house committee on naval affairs
soon would frame some form of
recognition of Peary's achievement.
The sentiment here In favor of
Peary Is growing and It is believed
that the president's recommendation
that the officer be promoted to the
rank of rear-admiral and retired wl'l

Sewer Committee Report.
A special committee appointed to
make Investigation as to complaints
made against the establishment of
sewers In the city submitted Its re
port. The committee stated that
the most general cause of complaint
was that certain property owners' had
already connected their property with
a sewer, and, therefore, did not feel
like paying for the laying of more in
tbelr district:. The committee rec
ommended that this cause be not
considered, and that no consideration
be given any of the complaints, savo
those where there was an error In' as
sessment. The report was adopted.

THE
PLAN
Sun Francisco, Dec. 6. -A three
cent carfare for strap-hangers Is tho
solution of poor street car service,
according to a bill drawn up by Su
pervisor Oscar Hocks and which will
be submitted to the board of super
visors when that body meets tomor
row. "No seat, no five-cent fare," Is ths
stand that Supervisor Hocks has
taken In his bill.
"I have no quarrel with the
street car company," said Hocks to
day, "but I believe that such an or
dinance would bring about better
service."
The proposed ordinance mukes It
a misdemeanor to collect more than
three cents fare unless a seat is pro
cured and states that a fine of not
more than $600 or Imprisonment
for not exceeding six months shall
be Imposed on anyone who attempts
It. The bill does not provide for
the collection of the additional two
cents, where a passenger obtains a
seat after paying a "strap-hanger
fare."
