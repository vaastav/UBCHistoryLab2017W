THE LION'S AWFUL ROAR.
The country will hear with great
trepidation.that England does not pro?
pose to accept the Hay-Phiincefote
treaty If the Davis amendment Is
adopted. From London there comes
this note of high defiance;
"The report that the British govern?
ment has in any way Indicated Its will?
ingness to accept the amendud treaty
Is utterly false. In fact, the Indien?
tions, such as they are, point to Croat
Britain refusing to consider nny
amendment to what the foreign office
already believes to be d generous con?
cession. To quote a high authority:
??\Yo would hot have abrogated the
Clayton-BUI wer treaty for any other
nation In the world. Unless all the tra?
ditions ,of British foreign policy are re?
versed I fall to see how we can afford
to give away any more ndvant i 1
even to America."
"Generous concession," "give away
nny more advantages, even to Amer?
ica!'' Have British assurance and in?
solence ever gone further than that,
since the English were thrashed for
Impressing American seamen? Is tins
to be the reward 'the country reaps
from all the toadying Mr. McKinley and
Secretnry 'Ay have been doing? Cnh
It be that England Imagines thai hiit
displeasure will out Weigh plain connv?
cratlons of American i iu111s> and inter?
ests with an American Congress?
England has not made any conces?
sions, for 'tho quite Bulllclent reason
that she has never had anything to
concede; slje has never given away any
advantages, because she had no advan?
tages to give. Only an exaggerated
tolerance and a maudlin sentimental
Ism have made possible English nn I
dllng in a purely American affair up lo
this time, in view of her present um?
l?de?which Is her historic attitude, In?
deed?the Senate should pigeon-hole
tho Hay-Pauncefote treaty and pass
the Nicaragua canal bill without delay.
It hau been perfectly plain to evorj
sane person, who knows anything of
English history or English character,
that sooner or later some such mani?
festation of arrogance, as this, would
put a period to tho slobber and hysteria
of the so-called American-English on
tento. And for this precious hit of im?
pudence, this assumption of the rlgh'i
to veto tho canal project, the United
States has forfeited the friendship o?
Russia, of as long standing us the re?
public itself, and one that demanded
no sacrifices and sought to Imp ?
obligations.
CHAFFEE DOES WELL.
Tho Pokln correspondent of the Lon
don Morning Post Is authority for th<
statement that Count Von Waldersoi
has been offended by General Chnffei
the latter having written a letter
protesting against tho looting of the
Chinese Observatory. This letter, we
uw Informed, "was re turned on ac?
count of Its tone," which doubtless
means that Chaffee gol to the point
without unnecessary verbiage. He also,
M seems. Issued orders to the American
guards to keen people out of the Im?
perial palace as far as possible.
The incident, if real, Is distinctly to
tho credit of General Chaffee, Urb army
In which lie is a distinguished officer
and the country of which lie i.-; n citi?
zen. That tiie author-ties at Washing?
ton will sustain hint In doubtful, but
there is no sort of doubt that ninety
nine* out of every hundred of Intelligent
Americans, who do not believe in one
code of morality at home and another in
China, will enthusiastically applaud
General Cliaffee's netlon. He Is plainly
one of those rugged specimens of
American manhood that Is not over?
awed hy the splendor of tlio Ger?
man uniform or the mustachols and
asbestos house of Marshal Count
Von "Waldersce, commander of the
tones in China. It was an out?
rage that American troops should
have been nominally placed under
the command of a foreign officer,
German or what not, in the llrst place,
and was made possible only by the ob?
sequiousness of Mr. McKinley and his
.Secretary of State. The Germans have
taken the lead in all the shameless
vandalism and hideous cruelty 'that has
disgraced the campaign In China. It
will be a source of supremo satisfac?
tion to self-respecting Americans If It
shall transpire that General ChafCee
has In fact spoken out plainly and to
the point to 'the military chieftain who
has countenanced and tolerated this In?
famy, j
WASHINGTON'S CENTENNIAL.
The celebration of the centonnlnl an?
niversary of the formal removal of the
capital to "Washington City not only
directs attention to the capital's devel?
opment from next to nothing to the
present splendid city of a quarter mil?
lion people, hut suggests no less
Btrongty our magnificent growth as a
nation. Indeed, the building up of
Washington City Is in a sense typical
of the building up of the nation. The
capital is not an ill epitome of the re
public. How vastly have the nation
and its capital grown in 100 years!
And yet the nation has not grown
more than It has changed within that
lime. 'When the corner-stone of the
capltol war-, laid Washington made a
speech, after which the crowd Indulged
in one of the barbecues that now linger
only ns an adjunct of political cam?
paigns in tho outlying districts. Th
bavbecue and gumbo age has given
place lo the champagne nnd terrapin
age. Imagine -Mr. McKinley nnd the
august assemblage of statesmen now in
Washington going out to one of the
parks to eat oxen roasted whole!
W? have multiplied the accessories of
life in (hese last hundred years; wo
have also multiplied the accessories of
politics. There are frills that Wush
Ington and those who laid the corner
stone of the capltol. preliminary to
the barbecue, never dreamed of. Are
tie' American people any he better for
It? Is Mr. McKinley superior to Wash
In! ton, who, no doubt, went along with
the crowd and ate his share of ox with
as niuch relish us anybody else? Aie
the men who will fill the hotels and ?
street cars and reviewing stands nnd
drawing rooms of Washington tomor?
row superior in virility, in virtue, Inj
sincerity, in clearness of head, clean
ncss of heart, strength of limb to the
assemblage of our forefathers who
Hooped to the barbecue at Washing?
ton's heels? For all our palace cars,
und palatial hotels, and telegraph nnd
r ? i hones, hurry, swagger and arrant
egotism could we look those barbecue
eating forbears of ours in the eye und
say that vVo have kept faith with them
and have preserved Inviolate all that
was best of ib.- heritage they left us?
There is no doubt that as a people
we have gone forward at a hurricane
pace, but are we not too apt to mistake
the mere accessories of modern civili?
zation for tin individual superiority
over our forefathers that In point of
fact does not exist? Tho American of
today Is more facile, more alert, more
catholic in his Judgments, better In?
formed in current matters than the
American of lGt) years ago. But has he
any stronger grip on the essentials? Is
he a better patriot, a better citizen, a
better man? Is not his moral code
more flexible and his sense of right
more amenable to his sense uf expe?
diency?
We may be all wrong, but wc are In?
clined to the opinion that a good many
things go| themselves done In the capl?
tol as n stands today that would have
aroused the men who met in the old
capltol to a fury of rlghtcoiM) opposi?
tion. Much has been gained In 100
years; much has been lost, it could
not be otherwise, doubtless, but it Is
more or less of a pity for nil that.
l'HE POSTMASTER GENERAL'S
REPORT.
I The most Interesting feature of the
Postmaster-General's report to Con?
gress Is that which deals with the ex?
periment in rural free delivery of the
malls and the feasibility of extending
the system to all the more thickly
population country districts. The Vir
glnlan-Pllot has hitherto referred to
the complete success of the system ns
Inaugurated in Carroll county. Mil.
Bn 1 on this and other experiments,
ib' fostmaster-Gdiicral submits tie'
f< llowlng estimates lot a com pit? to sys?
tem for the country:
ICstimated gross cost .$20,505,600
I leduct estimated snv
ings from dls'con
t mo.ne e of fourth
' .s:? oillces of _192,759,400
l v lud est I mated sav?
ings from discon?
tinuance of star
routes . 2.D0D.0OO
Dedin t increased re
rceeipts . 1,513,976
-S 0,778,370
Net annual cost of iura! free
delivery .$i:!,7S2,22l
When the gn at convenience nnd ben
hflls of a complete system or rural free
delivery of the mails Is considered, $L$.
7S2, 221 seems an exceedingly reasonable
sum to pay f>u- such a system'. In his
report, the Postmaster.General claims
that by abuses of the regulations for
second-class matter the. government
every year losea $12,000.000 to ?2'J,?00,000.
If this estimate be correct, by eliminat?
ing such abuses, free rural delivery
could be inaugurated without mate
rlnlly Increasing tho present postal bud?
get or tho annual dellclt of the de?
partment, which wus 15,385,000 this
year.
An eillclent system of rural delivery
would he a boon to country people, and
the next few years Is llkey to see such
a system as universal in the country
us the population of the several locali?
ties will justify.
THE SUN AND ITS PARTY.
Incredible us It seems, it ia neverthe?
less a fact that the New York Sun has
a good word for the Democratic plat?
form, while It rasps tho platform of
the Republicans. It accuses Hon. John
Hay of Toadyism to England and avers
that he Is responsible for the equivo?
cal canal plank In the Philadelphia
pronouncement and "tho serious em
burrussment of 3Mr. McIClnley's admin
Inistration and the Republican party."
Tho Sun continues:
"These declarations of the Demo?
cratic platform, on the other hand, are
both positive and right, and they com?
mend themselves nt once to Americans
Irrespective of party:
"We Insist upon the strict mainten?
ance of tho Monroe Doctrine in all its
Integrity, both In letter and in spirit,
as necessary to prevent the extension
of-European authority oh this conti?
nent ami as essential to our supremacy
In American affairs."
"We favor the Immediate construc?
tion, ownership and control of tho Nic?
aragua canal by the United States."
"Wo condemn the llay-Pauncefote
treaty as a surrender of American
rights and interests not to he tolerated
by the American people."
Then, swallowing its pride and r.p
j parently recognizing the hopelessness
; of appeal to the Senators of its own
party, tho Sun Importunes the Dcmo
; oratio Senators to defeat tho Ilay
Pduncefote treaty, declaring that they
j cannot "honorably und consistently
i take any other course In view of these
explicit Instructions from Kansas
City." It finds that the power of the
administration is being "exerted for
:he destruction of tho Monroe doctrine
and the surrender of American rights
I and Interests on this continent to a
concert of European powers."
So far as the obligation of Demo?
cratic Senators I? concerned they seem
bound to opposition to the Hay
Pauncefote treaty, in so far as a plat?
form can bind them. Tho Republican
Senators are free to vote as ?:hey choose
on tho treaty. Is It not strange, there?
fore, that the chief organ of tho He
public.in party should have to appeal
to Democratic Senators and invoke the
authority of the Democratic platform
to save "American righ's and interests
oh this continent"? Only a little over
a month ago this same organ was
heaping vituperation and abuse upon
these men because they saw neither
wisdom or justice in the policy Mr.
McKinley was. and is, pursuing in the.
Philippines. They were "flag-furlers",
"aunties", "traitors" because they
held fast by the Declaration of Inde?
pendence In the presence of supposed
material advantages in abandoning It;
now the Sun Is compelled to admit that
only the Democratic platform and the
men who owe allegiance to It can or
will save the dignity, Interests and
prestige of -the United States in this
hemlsphi re. Surely the vindication of
the Democratic party lias been swift
and ample!
The colored population of Newport
News seems to have Indulged In a
quantity of premature Christmas tele-'
b rating.
If Lord Roberts values his life and
his ear drums lie will carefully avoid
London when he lands in England.
The members of the Sernnton, Pa.,

permitted to apologize and resign. That
was harsh treatment for a little thing
like gluing un eye tn the main chain e.
H was a foregone conclusion that the
aiioy bill wound pass whenever u vote
should be taken thereon. Such a meas?
ure Is not only demanded by tho mill
i iry needs of the country, but It Is an
acl of legislation Indispensable to the
safety and welfare of the Republic.

IN LOVE WITH PIIILLirS.
(Iowa State Register.)
A few days ago when George H.
Phillips was nothing but a hardwork?
ing broker, having a difficult tusk to
make a living in Chicago, he would
have had no trouble in counting on the
lingers of one hand those people who
called him their friend, but now, that
he has mad-; a quarter million dollars
on his corner oti corn and has given
every promise of becoming a king
among speculators, his friends are le?
gion, and his every day mall is bur?
dened with missives from "an old
time friend." those old-time friends
having suddenly remembered hin? as
soon ns he had made a fortune. As tot
love letters, .Mr. Phillips now "has
them to but it." and that is w hat he Is
doing with them. Hi-re Is a ."amide:
Peotoue, til., Nov. 2S. 1900.?My Dear
Good Mr. Phillips: Having many lone?
ly hours to spend and having nothing
else to do, 1 have been rending the
newspapers and have followed your
cute work with those board of trade
fellows. Going a Idonde. 27 years old
and unmarried, I decided to write you
Ibis letter to tell you that I am just
the sort of a girl to offer good advice
to a young man who is threatened with
having money, riches, fortune and
wealth.
1 am ti pret'ty good worker on the
typewriter; and, hearing that you are
not married yet, I thought I would
make an attempt to make myself
known. 1 think you need u friend and
adviser more than you need those
board of trade fellows, who are always
looking for corners and bulls and bears
and everything else that a nice young
fellow should have no use for. Yours
in stncerefulriess,
M A CDF, DEMPSET.
Mira Weeks, an admirer from Ne?
braska, writes Phillip-! that he surely
heeds a kind and loving soul to take
care of him. and that she is certain
that She is Just the kind of woman he
need;!.
AT 11 ANNA'S COMMAND.
(St. Louis Republic.)
No more convincing proof of the po?
tency of Mark Hunna's influence in
controlling American public affairs of.
the present time could well be possible
that, is found in the fact that the ship
subsidy bill is the first measure to be j
taken up by the United Stales Senate
in Its resumption of unllnlshed busi?
ness.
The Ship-subsidy bill Is quite gene?
rally understood to have been framed
for the especial and well-nigh exclu?
sive benefit of Ihq ' nria-Payhe-Frye
Standard Ol! syndicate, it was Senator
I lamia's masterful win which com?
pelled thi? Senate to consider this meas?
ure ahead of nil other bills now await?
ing Semite action, it was Senator
Frye, the bill's sponsor, who led In Us
discussion, arrogantly demanding fav?
orable action.
Hack of Mark Hnhna nnd Senator
Frye and the syndicate Interests that
arc to profit from this proposed tax of
}2e V i ",e,i, 1,-vi 'd rpoii the American
people, stands President McKinley, In?
debted to Mark Henna and to the syn?
dicates for his election nnd re-election
to the Presidency. All the influence
possible to the administration win be
exerted in behalf of the ship-subsidy
bill, the word of command for a solid
Republican support having been spoken
in the President's message to Congress.
The ship-subsidy bill Is typically a
party measure.

NO AO' '< H NT I NO.
(Washington Times.)
When Congress, in the fullness of its
confidence, exhubcrarilly voted a sum
"f fifty million dollars to Mr. McKinley
as an emergency fund, to make him
comfortable while in training for his
contest w ith Spain, that great arid good
man was touched, even ns was the
Treasury. He paid that all of the' ex?
penditures from that fund should be
kept In a separate set of books, so that
generations yet unborn might have
the satisfaction 6t seeing JilSt how the
man of the hour handled the cash.
Perhaps posterity may enjoy that priv?
ilege, but the pre -oat g? noiation has
not been permitted to, up to date. At
the first session of the pre ; Mit Con?
gress, the Senate asked the President
for an accounting-. We do not hear
that any has becri made. Why?
THE PARDONING OF KAOAN.
(Philadelphia Times.)
The man who has thus been prac?
tically acquitted <>i all blnrrie and ad
mltted?as far as an official command
can go?to the honorable company of
thi- retire.', olficers of the army, 1? the
man who thus spoke publicly of his
comma ml inc. officer:
"If. arid when General Miles charges
that it (meaning tinned fresh beef)
was furrilahed as a "pretense of ex?
periment," he lies In his throat, he lies
in his luart, he lies in every hair of
ids le-ad nnd every pari of his body,
he lies wilfully, deliberately, intention?
ally and maliciously.
"In denouncing General Miles as a
liar when be .kes this Btritement, l
wish t" make i: emphatic and as coarse
as the statemi nt Itself. I wish to
force the Ho back Into his throat cov?
ered with the contents of a camp la?
trine.
"Unless 1 e can prove bis statement
he should 1 denounced by e ery hott?
est man, hiss* 1 from tin- (dubs, barred,
from the so< tely of decent people nnd
so ostracised that the street boot?
blacks would not condescend to speak
to him."
Such language Is in itself the lan?
guage of n rowdy and :t . blackguard.
The man ennoble of using it, under
any conditions whatever, is unfit for
the association of gentlemen. So a
court of officers of equal or superior
rank unanimously decreed. Yet the
President takes this creature under his
protection and forces him hack upon
the army list. No explanation of this
shame is possible except that the
President or those whom he bad to
protect wore nfrnld of Eagnn's un?
bridled tongue*. It Is a-disgraceful con?
spiracy of silence that brings dis?
honor on all who are a parly to It.
