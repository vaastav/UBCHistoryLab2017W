Morgan joint rule relative to the counting of
the Electoral votes. TliO resolution wf»
adopted without a dissenting vote. The
rations was In session for more than .throe
hours. Senator Anthony was chosen Presi
dent and Mr. Townsend,«(Ohio, Secretary.
The discussion was. In effect, a continuation
of that of last night, the debate proceeding
upon the Baker amendment to the Lapham
resolution.
TUB LAPHAM lIKSOMmON
last night provided that the resistance of the
Republicans to the passage of Ihoruloshould
extend to the last parliamentary extremity.
The Baker amendment provided that The Ro
publicans, after reasonable efforts to defeat
the tide, should bo contented by recording
their votes against It. The Baker amend
ment was voted down will) practical unan
imity, ami the Lapham resolution adopted.
The principal speakers were Senators Blaine,
Teller, and Kerry, and Representatives Robe
son, Conger, Kelfor, Robinson, Hawley,
Lapham, mid Brown.
SENATOR nLAINB
took tho ground that tho rule should bo op
posed to tho Inst extremity. Conger was
equally earnest In recommending this course,
as wcrolCcifor, Robinson of Massachusetts,
mul Lapham. Robeson opposed the rule, but
was not qulto ns radical In his recommenda
tions ns to tho extent to which tho opposition
should go. Hlscock, of Now York, and Sen
ators Teller and Kerry were rattier averse to
iitlbustcrtng. The feature of tho dlschsslou
was
THE SPEECH OF MR. DLAtNE,
which occupied nearly twenty minutes. Ho
took tho ground that tho Republican party
could not assume tho risk of any such rule
ns tbo Democrats now propose. Ho was fre
quently interrupted by questions from tbo
moderate, among whom Robinson, of Massa
chusetts, was conspicuous. One of the ques
tions piit by Robinson was', What would Mr.
Blaine do if, when tho time cutno to count
tho votes, the Democrats should interpose
with their resolution and Insist upon its pas
sage. Mr. Blaine responded with his usual
alacrity,—that It was nono tno lesshisdiity to
escape tho bullet of tho nssasln now, oven
though ho might bo In danger of having his
throat cut on a future occasion.
ROBINSON, OF MASSACHUSETTS,
defended the position taken by him and
others last night, that there was no danger
In tho Morgan resolution, and, therefore,
nothing to bo gained by making a stubborn
and prolonged tight against It. Haskell, of
Kansas, took the same ground.
TUB RESOLUTION ADOPTED
was as follows: -
itoolral, That wo will resist the passage of
tho ponding concurrent resolution by tbo
House by ad tho moans known to parliamentary
practice as long as possible.
Jlr. Baker's substitute, which was first
voted down, was nearly in those words: '
UcmAvu l. That, after full debate and tbo pro
posing of amendments and substitutes to tho
pending resolution, wo will content ourselves by
voting against Its passage.
THE REPUBLICANS
have thus taken tho ground that thoy fear
that the Democrats mean mischief by their
unconstitutional and needless rule, and that
they ore plotting against tho pcaco and pros
perity of tho country, and that their
past record docs .not cutitlo them to
bo believed now, when they declare tlmt
there Is no intention on their part to at
tempt to count Hancock in. Tho Republic
ans Intend to take no risks, and, while it Is
true that tbo leading Democrats deny that
their party entertain such a purpose, the Re
publicans do not propose to placo any
weapons in their hands. Tho Democrats
may bo acting in good faith. If so, tho rule
is needless, and they will lose nothing by
abandoning their contest Fair promises
have been made by tho Democrats before,
and have been broken. Thoy will not boac-.
copied now.
TUB RESULT WILL DOUBTLESS RE
that tho Democrats will bo compelled to
abandon their attempts- to force tho
adoption of this rule. But the contest
may* continue for some days, and will
unquestionably bo a bitter one. Tho
Republicans maintain that, In opposing tho
rule, they are resisting threatened revolu
tion. They think tho purpose is to throw
out Now York and throw tho election into
tho House, and tlmt as a means to this etui
they would unseat Orth, give tho scat to his
Democratic competitor, McCabe, and that
they would unseat Washburn, and in this
way secure tho majority by States.

Umt tho seats of Mr. Washburn, of Minne

uncommonly Industrious. Tho Committee
hastened Us work so much that a year ago tho

had carefully considered the cose of Blsbco
against Hull, of the Second Florida District,
and the Republican members of tbo Sub*
CommUtco had agreed upon a report, the
Democrats refused to hold another meeting,
and to tako the case up and dispose of it at
tbo last session. Why? Because the case Is
a clear one, showing that Blsbco Instead ot

House of Representatives.
SO PLAINLY ARB TUB LAW AND THE FACTS
in Mr. Blsbee’s favor that it Is very much
doubted whether, If tho voto Is over taken,
even the Democratic members of tho Com-

announcement that Mr. Thompson, Secretary
of ilio Navy, has been tendered- and Ims ac
cepted tho American Chairmanship of tbo
Do Lessens Panama Canal scheme,—ln vlow
of tho fact that our Government has so
strenuously Intimated tlmt it disapproves of
that project, tlmt it is disposed to favor a
rival route, and that tho Do Lessops enter
prise Is In violation of tho Monroe doctrine,—
makes it probnblo UmtMr. Thompson has not
been tendered, and. of course, has not ac
cepted, tho place. But it lias been intimated
to some that tho Chairmanship
MIGHT HE OFPEIIIIED HlSf.
Mr. Thompson has long had his attention
directed to canal schemes, and many years
ago was tho attorney for the Thompson who
now claims to have a concession from tho
Colombian Government to Urn narrow tract
of land extending from tho Gulf of Mexico to
tho Pacific Ocean, known as “ Tho Chirlqul
Strip.” There Is little doubt that Secretary
Thompson has the subject under considera
tion, and that ho contemplates resigning bis
Secretaryship to accept It. The salary which
tho Panama Company propose to pay the
Chairman Is $25,000. This Is tho place once
tendered to Qou. Grant

Washington, D.C., Dec! o.—Gov. Claflln, of
Massachusetts, who lias been looking after
tho prospects of tho passage of tho proposed
now Lowell Bankrupt law, in tho interest of
tho Boston Chamber of Commerce, expressed
the opinion to-night tliat there would
ho no action upon the bill at this
session, and that tho Democrats wore prac
tically determined to do nothing about it
Tho unpopularity of tho old Bankrupt act Is
used by tho Democrats to tho disadvantage
of all the now propositions. Tho Lowell hill,
with all the amendments proposed to It, has
been referred to the House Judiciary Com
mittee, of which Proctor Knott Is Chairman.
The Democratic majorityof that Committee Is
OPPOSED ON PIUNCIPLE
to any bankrupt system. The element of
Nationality in it is enough of itself to insure
Its defeat at the hands of a majority of
tho Democrats on tho Committee.
Gov. Clallin says, therefore, that, so far as
his observation goes, ho is convinced tliat
tho merchants need expect no now Bankrupt
act from tho present Democratic Congress,
and, although Sir. Clafiln does not sny it, tho
same may bo said us to all other schemes of
PRACTICAL LEGISLATION
intended for tbo benefit of Uio people. Noth*

Spttial DUpaUh to Tht VMtaoo TVtbuac.
Bt. Louis, Mo., Doe. 0.—’Tho Theatre Comlque,
at one tlmo known as Do liar’s Theatre, located
on PJao. near Fourth street, was completely
gutted by Ore this afternoon. The stanch front
walls nro alono standing. They wore built In
tho olden days of honest masonry whon build
ings wore put up to stay. A defective furnace
started tho llro under tho stage. Tho stngo
wardrobes of tbo performers engaged In tbo
thoatro wore ,on tho stage when tho fire broke
out. Nothing was saved. In tho early stages of
tbo lira tho smoko was so dense as to prevent
tbo "firemen from entering tho building. Tho
employes, who first endeavored to save somo of
tho furniture, were driven out by tho suffocat*
Ipg volumes of smoko.. That was. while tbo
scenery, with Its course canvas hacking, was
burning. Whon tbo Dames climbed to tbo light
wood proscenium,' and than crept around tho
tbreo galleries and sot tbo chairs and benches
on Qro, tho smoko was lessoned. It was while
Uio Arc was nt this stngo that somo venturesome
Dromon wont to tho main entrance mid looked
In upon n blazing, southing hell. Every
part of tbo thoatro was on fire. Tho
flames, carried upward by tbo strong draught
through tbo ventilation In tho dome, converge*!
all ono way, ond when tbo guard to tho ventila
tor was burned away tbo great volume of ilarno
went crackling and roaring upward through tho
root many (cot In tho air.
Tbo work of destruction was going on with In
conceivable rapidity. Vainly did iho Dromon
direct their powerful streams nt tho burning
seats and galleries, until, warned by tbo crack
of tbo latter, us (hoy bogon to fall away In sec
tions, they wore lorcod to retire to tho ouUldo
and fight tho flames through tho windows.
Many of tho attaches of tho thoatro
roomed In tbo small building between tho Thea
tre proper and tho C tlohe-Vcmucrat building.
Tho flro was slow In communicating to this
point, and tbo Salvage Corps, with tbo assist
ance of employes of tho bouse and volunteer
citizens, succeeded in removing nearly all tho
furnlturo In tho moro accessible rooms. It was
Impossible to reach tho rear apartments, and
,tholr contents wont down with tho general
wreck that followed. George W. Reed, stage
manager of tbo thoatro, bad SOOO wortbof ward
robe In ono of tho rooms.
Tbo flremon never worked so bard, or under
such cheerless surroundings. Tbo weather was
Intensely cold, and tbo spray from tho hoso
streams froze ns It (ell. Tbo tlromcn looked as
though clad la mall. Tbo ladders wore covered
with Ice, and tbo benumbed flro-flghtcrs slipped
ns they went up them, several narrow escapes
being noted.
Tbo burning ot tho Comlquo Just nt this tlmo
will provo u partloulurly-sml misfortune to Man
ager Smith. Tho season Is at Us hlgbt, and,
after having been run down by former manage
ment, Mr. Smith had. Just begun to mako sumo
money, 110 has a‘very strong company on
hand, all ot whom loso tbo greater part ot thalr
wardrobes, which In tho caso of tho lady per
formers nro very valuable.
On Sunday night Col. Thomas Snclbakcr, of
Cincinnati, was to have opened with his vaude
ville company of forly-tbreo performers. They
will bo forced to lie Idle next week.
Mr. Smith was unable In tbo excitement that
attended tho event to-dny to state what bis next
move would bo. In nil probability tbo theatre
would bo rebuilt. 110 has bis people engaged
for tho ontlro season ahead, and may, pending
tbo rebuilding of tho theatre, secure somo hall
lu which tho regular entertainments will bo con
tinued.
The Theatre Cmnlquo in Its day was tbo theatre
