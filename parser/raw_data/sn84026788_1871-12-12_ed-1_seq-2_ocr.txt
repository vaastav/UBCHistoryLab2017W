OONGBESS ANDJTHE MESSAGE.
The two Houses of Congress assembled on
the 3d intt., tod u its officers had beeo elect
?d at the la?t session, at once proceeded to
the translation of business. The Speaker of
the House announocd the Standing Com*
mittees aa the fir?t business in order, retain
ing Bauki as Chairman of Foreign Affair?,
and iHwet on the Committee of \\ ays and
Meana. Butler, it U considered, haa been
"snubbed." The proceedings of the week
were only preliminary movements as to fu
tare legialatioo, which will eventuate in
moet angrj and stormy diacuaaion. The pco*
pie of the country, generally, anticipate but
little good result from its deliberations, and
the sooner the "end of the beginning" is re
alised, the more will be enhanced the per*
manont peace and prosperity of the nation.
The Message of the President was sont in
en the first day of meeting. As a matter of
National concern, more than of any intrinsic
merit, we publish it entire on our first page.
Its most important recommendation, after
years of needless and cruel delay, is tbo eugges
tion to Congress of Amnesty, to those who par
ticipated in the Rebellion, baring previously
taken an oath to snpport the Constitution of
the U. S. For the suspension of the habeui
corpus io a time of peacc, and withiu the
confines of what was once, at least, a free
and sovereign State, no word of defence is
made, but simply referred to as though it
might be the exercise of every day authority,
when in the darkett days of England's his
tory it would have coat tho King bis head.
The annexed extracts from comments of
prominent journals of both parties, indicate
the general cbaractsr of expression upon the
Message:
[From ibt Philadelphia Ag*, dim.]
The message is on its face a bid?the lid
of a candidate for re-election. Nor does he
ranch mind that it is at the expense of his
party. He is resdy, he says, to abandon their
tariff doctrine, to abandon the income tax,
which he himself fixed on tho party by a
recommendation in his previous messago; and
he even hints in an ambiguous way that he
wanta a resumption of apecie payments.?
Kven the Ku-Klux law, which he himself
helped to paas by a special message in ita fa
vor, after Butler's bill had been indefinitely
postponed, even that precious scheme for !
military despotism is treated as a law, the
wisdom of which is not to be inquired into.?
The rapid diminution of the public debt,
whioh has hitherto been the boast of the ad*
ministration, is said now to be too rspid, and
the taxes that contribute to it ought to be
lightened. One of the least dignified parts
of the document is a bitter onslaught on tho
late Russian minister, Catscaiy, which is en*
tirely out of place in a rncwage to Csugress.
[From tha New York Time*, rep.J
We have repeatedly pointed out that there
ware three subjects on which the people
asked for a modification of the policy which
haa been pursued of late years. Theso arc,
civil service reform, reveuue reform, and am
nesty. The President's views on these are in
direct aoeord with the views of the most lib*
eral leaders of public opinion.
[From tbo New York Herald, iad }
In a word, whether considered as embody
ing the views of a ?talesman ambitious only
to promote tho material prosperity and moral
advsncemeut of his country, or as as a poIitU
eal campaign document from a candidate for
another presidential term, this message is
well calculated to strengthen Gen. Grant and
te weaken his adversaries throughout tho
United States.
GRANT'S AMNESTY,
The Richmond Enquirer in its editorial
comments on the President's message, justly
observes that no reaaon now exists for the
tardy recommendation by General Grant of
universal amnesty, and the removal of politi*
eal disabilities growing out of the war, which
haa not existed in equal force and measure
einee the cessation of hostilities.
The Enquirer therefore implies that it does
?et feel oal!ed upon to indulge or exhibit any
?xtravsgant grstitudo towards the man, who,
in his high plaoe, has so long stubbornly op*
posed the extension of this righteous clemen*
ey; and who, while he awkardly and tardily
rsoommends it with one hand now at latt, is
engaged with tho other in drsgooning and op
pressing the Southern Stites, in conformity
with the pitiless "bayonet aud broadside"
policy of his administration.
The Fight Against Grant,
The ohief organ of tho Administration, the
New York Timet, says in au editorial in it*
iiaue of Monday laat:
Senator Sumner, of Massachusetts, will in
troduce at the beginning of tho present ses
sion of Congress a bill to amend the Conttitu
lion of the United States so as to limit all
future occupants of tho Presidential chair to
one term. This is to bo the opening of the
programmo, now nearly perfected, by which j
the "disaffected Republicans," or "soreheads,"
hope to defeat the re-election of General
Grant. It is intended, as a sort of signal gun,
or bugle blast, to summon the scattered forces ]
into line of battle, and at the soiue time to j
oall out somo expression of the sentiment of
the country in reference to this cardinal point
in the proposed platform of tho opposition in
the coming campaign. Should it meet with a
favorable response, it is conjcctured that tho
battle will already be half won ; for a geueral
endorsement, by the peoplo, of the one term
principle, would dispose of Geueral Grant nt
the outset.
CUT From the report of Mr. Douglas, Com
missioner of Internal Revenue, we learn that
tbo aggregate receipts from taxation during
the past year were a little over ono hundred
and forty-four millions. The returns of dis?
tilleries show that there is nearly fifty-seven
millions of gallons of spirits produoed in the
United 8tstes yearly. A large poition of the
report \4 occupied with the subject of tobacco,
the Commissioner favoring tho consolidation
of all the taxes on this articlo to a uniform
tax on the raw tobacco, which ho would place
at tweoty-four or thirty-two cents per pound,
aeoording to circumstances.
X2T The Washington Chronicle does not
anticipate any great aohievemonts in the way
ef basinets, this fusion of Congress. It says
?hat this is the session preceding the Presi
dential election; generally one io which there
is almost endless talk and very little work?a I
t tales of buwoBb*.
the oivil service system.
Ctrl Schura mad# a great speech on Civil
Service Riform, in New York,*fewevenings
sioce, doling with the following oompariaon
of the Tammaoy frauds with thoee that ere
perpetrated under the Grant Administration,
lie regards the former u "only ?n incident"
of the latter. He laid:
"The inreitigation carried on by the Ad
[ ministration has been very considerate indeod
u to ittf practical results so far. It haa only
evolved the fact that Tom Murphy, aflcr all,
wu the model oficcr of the country. (Great
applause and laugLter.) I candidly bolievc
that wc arc standing on the threshold of a
great moral revolution in our political life ?
You have commenced it by your magnificent
victory here in the overthrow of the Tammany
jobbers. [Appause.] It wu indeed a splen
did achievement, but it will stand in history
only as an ephemeral or barren one, hkethoso
French revolutions whioh arise one day and
develop into monarchies the next, if it is not
followed until it leads to the oveithrow ol a
system of which the Tammany robbera are
ooly an incident. [Applause.] I tell you this
spoil syttem is worse than Tammany. 4Bo?s
Tweed wu merely a repulsive example. What
the country needs is a general revival of con
scicnce in politics, and this must sweep over
every political field. We want a union of hon
est men against radicals, whatever party names
they may bear, and they must have the moral
couragc to call things by their right names,
aud to strike at the very root of the evil."
Commenting on this speech, which was a
home thrust it "the spoils system" of Grant,
the New York Tribune very lignificactly re
marks :
"The abuses which havo grown up with the
Civil Service or have latterly crept into it,
would not long stand tho tturdy blows which
Senator Schurz delivers, if tej intereit ot lea
itlaluretcat not generally identified with their
defence. The Senator's speech last night needs
no good words of ours to commcnd it< sound
ness and honest purposes. It was a clear and
convincing statement ol tho evils which afflict
the administration ot public affairs, and it
pointed the way to substantial reform."
?^Tho fire at Ilagerstown, Bid., on
Wednesday night of last week, proved less
disasterous than waa feared. The buildings
destroyed were the, court-house. Episcopal
church, and agricultural warebouie ol Rol
lins k Burbank. The losses are, court house,
$50,000; Episcopal churoh $20,000; Rol
lins & Butbank, $9,000- John Fricdingcr
wu killed aud several others were dangerously
injured by the falling of the court-house
dome. The county rcoordi were saved. The
fire is believed to have been the work of in
cendiaries and the mo*t active efforts aro, be
ing used to deeect the incendiaries.
JST By an agreement with the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad, it has been arranged by the
Supervisora of Ohio county for the release of
all taxes, city or county, heretofore or here
after accruing, in consideration of the Com
pany e^pendiog in the city of Wheeling net
less than $100,000 in the erection of Works
shops. The licguter stites that the Company
now employ about 200 hands, and this new
expenditure will give room for about 500
more, thus adding three hundred families,
and an expenditure approximating half a mil
lion of dollars It is promised the work shall
be commenced ft oner.
Jt3TTbe British succession is the theme of
discussion on all sides. The Boston Timet
says: "The second son of Victoria ii much
moro of a man than his elder brother, but is
a'mo^t as net- riously immoral. While the
daughters of the house of Guelph are exem
plary woman is all relations of life the sons
aro as contemptible a lot of blaokguards as
could be picked out of ono family in the Uni
ted Kingdom."
13T A Washington correspondent of the
Baltimore Sun says: The Supreme Court of
the U. S. has decided that real estate sold for
taxes due the Federal Government, and for
which a deed wu given by the Commissioner,
is valid. A eood deal of property in Vir?
gioia and Sooth Carolina is held under these
titles. _
X3T It is reported from Washington to tho
New York Tribune, that there is a feeling
among prominent Senators that the threatening
demonstrations toward Cuba means foreign
war, under cover of which home politics may
be put out of sight, and, possibly, the Santo
Domingo scheme revived in a way that shall
overbear all opposition.
S3T Tho Northern canals hare been closed
for the season, which is full; a week earlier
than usual. It is estimated that &t leoht
half a million dollars worth of grain in ice
bound on them. This will mainly affect the
shipper/", who will have t<i wait uut'l t-pring
for m??ney, except whero advances have been
obtained.
XtT The coudition of tho l'rince of Wales
during the past week, was raprcsonted as
critical in the extreme, and ?11 tho Royal
family had been summoned to bis bedside.?
The news of yosterday represent hii condition
as somewhat rnoro favorable.
f3T According to rumor*, Tom Scott is to
succeed J. Edgar Thompson, as President of
tho Pennsylvania Central, and A. K. Mc
Clure, of Chatnbersbunr,. Pa , is to step into
Tom'e slippers as first Vice Pvchident.
Z3T The carpetbaggers of the South Car
olina legislature increased the State debt
821,.041,350 in sixteen days. Grant pro
poses to pin that sort of a government upon
tho people with bayonets.
t&' Ex-President Andrew Johnson is ut
terly opposed to the passive policy, and is re
ported by an interviewer of the Cincinnati
Commercial us laying that a surrender is as
bad as a defeat.
B&T General Howard, of the Freedmen's
Bureau, will recommend in his report the
entire abolition of that concern. As he has
grown rich off of it he thinks its mission is
ended.
X3T The trial of Mrs. Wharton, for the
nlledged poisoning of Gen. Ketohum in lia!?
tiuiore, is now in progress at Annapolis, Md.
It will occupy several weeks.
New Onr.EANtf, Deo. 6.?The Second Dis
trict Court decided that Mrs. Gaines is not
the legitimate ohild of Daniel Clark nor his
universal legatee, and revokea the probate of
Clark's will of 1818, which was probated in
1855, as valid. Mrs Gaines relied mainly
co this will to mtot*Dtiit? her ?ltin?..
Senator Trumbull as a Conservative
Uandidate for the Presidency.
Somebody, m we learn from the Louis*
villo Courier-Journal, has been poking the
"passive policy" and "now departure" Domi
nation at Senator Trumbull. 1 be reiolt was
not satisfactory. The Senator evidently thinks
and clearly sees, whilo lie greatly undervalue#
its strength, that the regular Democratic
party cau alone make head agaiuBt Republi
oan domination. The correspondent says:
I have just had detailed to me, by a promi
nent Southern politician, the particulars of a
conversation, had within the last day or two,
with Senator Trumbull, of Illinois. My in
formant, who is himself an ex-United States'
Senator, states (hat he met Jud?e Trumbull
in the library of Congress, and that, after ex
changing friendly salutations, he naked the
Senator whether ho would consent to the tuo
of his name as a conservative candidate for
the Presidency against General Grant. The
Illinois statesman replied with more than
usual emphasis:
"No, sir, I would not."
"And why not 7"
"For many reasons." Judge Trutnbull said
in substanco: "In the first placol am satisfied
where I am." * * * *
"The Southern Democracy would support
you with pleasure." w
"You arn mistaken. The Democracy is yet
too strong in numbers tj disband, for that
is the meaning of the passive policy. Three
millions of Democratic voters can not afford
to i-ell themselves to two or threo hundred
thousand Republican voters, 'and that for a
Diets of pottane, which tho Republicans and
not tho bcuioonts are to enjoy. I don't be
lieve they will do it. 1 think the passive pol
icy already a failure."
"Like the New Departure?"
4,N<\ not exactly. Tho oew departure ws
a necessity, win or lose. Had the Democrats
not adopted it, but in its place bad adopted
the platform of 1SGS, they would have beeD
still more disastrously beaten. The new de
paiture made no recruit-', because the people
did not bclicvo it houett. Tho Democratic
patty leaders did what they could no longer
avoid?that \r, accept tho situation?aud
the Republicans have to thank such writers
as Mr. Stephens and Mr. Fnrsythe that the
step in advance did not make further inrouds.
By 1870 issues of the war, the amendments
and the Ku-Klux will bo out of the way, and
there may be a new and complete reorganiza
tion of parties. But n< t now."
"Whatdo you thiuk of the Ku-Klux?" _
"They may be exaggerated. But there is
enough of unpunished violenco at the South
to justify tho newspapers in all tho outcry
they are making. This alono would beat the
Democracy."
"Then you think the fiirht next year will be
a straight-out party affair ?"
"I thiuk it will be as far as the Republicans
are concerned. The patty isnot really divided.
Its internal dissensions merely exhibit the ex
orcise of individual freo will, and do it good
and not harm. It will act as a body, and I
think will poll a larger voto than it did iu
1808, no matter what frame-work or what
candidates aro opposed to it."
I am assured in saying that the opinions of
Senator Trumbull aro also the opinions of
Seoator Sutuncr.
Mohk South Cakomna Aurksts.?The
I'nionville Times repoiti the atrest by United
Stites soldiers of six more citizens, including
Dr. Wade Fowler, "one of the best men in
the State, who had come to tho village from
Gowdeysvillc,nineteen miles, whew he resides,
to transact some busiucss with the probate
judge, and was arrested iu tho street and is
now confined iu jail."
Tho Spartau (Spartansburg) repotts tho
arrest of four more prominent citizens. Sev
eral had been released. Messrs. C. P. Turner
and Dauiel Anthony, after three weeks' im
prisonment, were carried before the commis
sioner for the purpose of investigating their
casos. Not a paiticle of testiuiouy could be
brought agaioft them?not a witness or an
affidavit having been made agaiust them, wc
suppose?but arrested upon mere suspioiau.
Among the lone list confined in jail is one ruin

Gnowni of tub City.?Among tho
prniuiueDt improvements tbut hare been uiado
in Charleston during the fieasou, are (lie new
steamboat landing, tho (Jottoo Opera House,
the Courier building and the new hotel.?
These improvements, io the agi-regato costing
nearly 8150,000, are within a stone's throw
of eaoh other, and are fair samples of the
general growth of tho city. Besides these,
we have two new churches, a largo number
of fine business house?, and private dwellings
almost without number. And theso aro but
the early steps. Next year ami the next and
throughout tho future, capital and outerpriso
will go forward with firmer tread, until a city
worthy of the Kanawha Valley aod of tho

while ago was tho village of Charleston.

Ort/nnfzatioii of the Lajitfoturt.
EJ*. of Billo Sun: Hath houses or tho
Legislature assembled to-day nt 12 o'clock.
Tho SoiutJ was called to order by Lieut.
Governor Maryo, and Sliolton C. Davis, of
Kichmond, clork of the last Senate, was re
elected, Col. Wirt Harrison, of Richmond,
aergeatit-at arms and Col. John W Minor of
Loudoun, ax doorkeeper.
In the House of Delegate*, J. Marshall
Hanger, of Augusta, wan elected speaker, (J.
Hell Rigger, of Kichmond, clerk, and Col.
Critteuden, of Culpeper, sergcant-at-arms.
There is an unusually full attendance in
both houses for tlic first day, only a few mem
bers beiug absent, and they detained by sick*
ness.
The Governor^ message was delivered to
both houses. Tho motit notiecablo feature in
the message is the recommendation fur re
trenchment in every department of tho State
government except tho executive. He re
commends that tho Legislature adjourn at the
end of sixty dnys, and that the members reduce
their pay aud tho pay of all tho attaches. It
is evident that retrenchment and economy
will be the order of the session.
lie also recommends that a State bonrd of
immigration bo organized, and that facilities
for the accommodation of immigrants be estab
lished at Norfolk ; that immigration ogencics
bo established in Europe, and every other
means utdd to encourage immigration to Vir
ginia, aud couscqueotly, also, direct foreign
trade
It is assumed that in a large majority of
cases il.c assessment* of lands in tho State nre
too high, and this is attributed tn the system
of local assessment#. It is therefore recom
mended that three general assessors he ap
pointed, whose business it shall be ti reassess
the property and equal.zo taxation throughout
the State.
The courts are considered one great source
of expense, and it is recommended that nil
the Circuit Courts in the Stnto be abolished,
except the Circa':t Court /or the city of Rich
mond, that the jurisdiction of the county
courts be enlarged, and ono judge appointed
to every twenty thousand inhabitants.
The penitentiary, free school system, and
all ether interest* of the Stnto are noticed,
and rccommemia'ions made in regard to them.
The only important resolution offered to
day was only extending tho time of tax col
lectors to the fir>t of February; referred to a
special committee of thrco, with orders to
repoit to-morrow. Plow.
