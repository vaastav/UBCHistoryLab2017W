.influence, and must a man be slaughtered
'because he seeks Republican indorsement!
Alexander H. Stephens opposed Huff,”
The letter says: “Could Fitzsimmons be con
firmed! Rrk he no Republican influence or
letters? Or docs be and Alexander H. Stephens
stand solidly and alone on their Bourbonistic
record for high claims upon that office* lean
imagine nothing more unique or picturesque in
a political landscape than the national figure of
.Alexander H. Stephens pleading with the bead
of a Republican Administration for a large
shardof its spoils on the ground that he had
always been a consistent Democrat.”
Hoff is
VEST SEVERE UPON STEPHENS.
He describee him as a public character, whose
political eccentricities distinguish him from all
others of his class, who has belonged to all
parties and indorsed all men; a man who has
historic taste, and has loved all countries and
all Governments, except the Southern Confed
eracy, and yet held the second office under that;
and this man, Huff says, now comes to the
front and appeals to a Republican President not
to give office to a man with Republican in
fluence.
It appears from the letter that Huff had
HILL’S WRITTEN INDORSEMENT,
sod that the Georgia Representatives, Blount,
Cook, and Smith, did not wish to indorse any
one for office under Hayes. Huff says: “The
truth is, Gen. Gordon, it was at one time a very
delicate thing to ask for Democratic support in
the procurement of office under this Adminis
tration. You know that there was much fear
and trembling, much hesitancy and diffidence,
©n the subject. You positively refused to give
Alston your support for a week, because it was
considered then by a large portion of the Demo
cratic party a positive want of fidelity to apply
for oflfce under Hayes. Yet to-day there is a
perfect avalanche of Democratic office-seekers
hanging around the White House asking for a
division of the Republican spoils, without fear
of party domination.”
Hull has always
ACTED THIS THE DESfOCHAUC-CONSEEVATITE
PARTY.
It appears from the letter that Senator Hill
\ and Alexander H. Stephens have had serious
‘ differences of opinion, amounting almost to a
; quarrel, udou the subject of this nomination.
Senator Gordon’s reply to Huff’s three
j column letter bears data Washington,
'Nov. 12, 1577. Gordon denies that
{the President promised to appoint
• aDemocratic Marshal in Georgia. The substan-
tial portion of Gordon’s letter is contained in
■ the subjoined passage: The Republican friends
! of Huff had sent a letter to the President in
Iwhlchthey say that Huff's appointment “Would
! materially strengthen Republicanism in Geor-.
i gia in harmonizing conflicting party differences/
and bring much added strength from sources
hitherto dormant or in active opposition.”
GORDON SAYS
“Now, when I found that these Republicans
were apparently your chosen agents to present
,your application, and had assigned these rea
sons for your appointment, and I found the
dettcr of Mr. Dibble to the Attorney-General
/on the next page, in which he states that all
true Republicans in Georgia (italicising the
word true) desire his (your) appointment, it oc
curred to me that it was time to look further
into this matter. I felt it was my duty io the
of Georgia to leant from the President
nfmself the impression on bis mind as to your
political status. X, therefore, asked the PrcsK
dent the direct Question: ‘ls Mr. Huff urged
for appointment as a Democrat?’ I give the
President’s reply In his own words. He said:
‘No; not as a Democrat, but as a man with
Very liberal ideas in politics.’ This information,
given me by the President himself,
supplemented by the- fact that
Messrs. M. C. Burney and Dibble, the
Republicans named, had presented your ap
plication and urged your appointment because
Jt would materially strengthen Republicanism
In Georgia, were the reasons, the onlj - reasons,
and I think sufficient reasons, for my opposition
to your appointment, and I am sure the reasons
which govern the Georgia delegation.”

him to the President not as a Democrat, and
says: “Tour disapproval of such arguments

apprehension as to your political status. 5 ’
These long letters were read in executive
• cession. They furnished the text for a bitter
debate.
THE SPEECHES.
It was to be expected that the debate would
be bitter. Senator Edmunds led the Repub
licans. Hie speech is characterized as one ot
the most powerful and severe denunciations of
which that remarkable speaker is capable. The
speeches of the Republicans, as near as can be
ascertained, were in substance the same as
were delivered in the two principal Republican
caucuses. Edmunds, using these two letters
as Ills text, treated the nomination of
Fitzsimmons as a challenge to Re
publicans, and; as an illustration of
what he has always called the President’s hal
lucinations respecting his Southern policy.
Conkling was not lew severe. Senator Gordon’s
speech was bitter and denunciatory on his side.
He succeeded iu carrying his party with him.
• Ben Hfll also spoke and reviewed in detail his
relations to the appointment as set forth iu the
foregoing letters. The Republicans were
mACTICA.IA.Y SOUP
to opposition. The only exceptions were tbc
two wbo have earned the appellation of apostates
during tnc last week—Conover and Patterson—
and Stanley Matthews. Fitzsimmons was con
firmed by 6 majority.
The only nominations considered in executive
session besides undisputed ones were those of
Fitzsimmons and Clayton as Consul to Callno.
The latter was almost as bitterly opposed as
Fitzsimmons and was confirmed. There re
mains, of course, unacted upon a long list of
dominations, including
THAT OF WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,
to be Collector at Chicago. The nomination of
Harlan will stand unless reconsidered. The ob
ject ol the Republicans in forcing a re
cess until Monday at 10 o’clock instead
of adjourning is to prevent affording the Presi
dent any opportunity for making suspensions
from office before the next session.could begin,
at 12 o’clock Monday. The recess plan is said to
haxc been Contllng’s. He thus far has been
successful in leading the Republicans in organ
ized opposition to the President as to confirma
tions.
X KEW POINT
fa raised to-night by Senators friendly to the
Administration. They say that it adjournment
«n be prevented at 12 o’clock .Monday and the
aesaion made to continue beyond that hour the
result will be that the second session of the
.Forty-flftn Congress trill not then begin, and
that the first session must be legally con
.sldered as continuing. Should this -be
the fact, the nominations not acted
upon would not fall at 12 o’clock Monday, and
require to be sent in again. Some Democrats
wuo still hare nominations upon which they de
sire action would undoubtedly combine to
PEEVE ST THIS ADJOtmssiEST,
If anything was to be gained by it. The matter
fa-being discussed. There will remain two hours
of the present session Monday morning, from 10
to X 2. It is the expectation among Senators
1 tllat th e«o two hours will be devoted to execn
..tive session, but that will depend upon o vote.
Should the two Houses he devoted to executive
session, doubtless the majority would desire to
lure the time devoted to the confirmation of
undisputed cases. Otherwise ity will be
■ possible lor opposing Senators to con
sume the entire time ia debate,
■ sod : thus defeat confirmations. Conkling,
•lor instance, would have no difficulty in talking
two hours In opposition to the removal of his
■New York Custom-House friends? If William
Henry Smith is confirmed as Chicago Collector
before 12 o’clock Monday his confirmation will
-be likely to depend upon the action of Senator
Davis or Oglesby. II either of them should
interpose objections, there would bo little
probability that he would be confirmed then.
A QUESTION ARISES
upon which eminent lawyers in both parties
disagree. 'That is upon the construction of
the Tcuure-of-Oflice act. The practical question
would be, II Smith is not confirmed, who will
be Collector of the Fort of Chicago at five min
utes past 12 ou Monday. The President
Is said to be of opinion that William
Henry Smith will, as his name would be
speedilysent in again. The Attorney-General
is thought to be of that opinion, hut it is cer
tain that some of the most distinguished law
yers in the Senate hold contrary opinions. Some
of them saj* that the very origin and spirit of
the Tcnure-of-Office act would prevent this, but
that act provides that the advice and consent of
the Senate is required for a removal; that a
suspension by the President
IS ONLY TEMPORARY,
conditioned upon the approval of the Senate;
that that approval is manifested by the con
firmation of a successor, and that, when that
successor is not confirmed or is rejected, the
Senate has said, in fact, to the President: “Wc
do not advise or consent to the removal, and as
a consequence the suspended officer is restored
to his post.” There is not likely, however, to
be any difficulties about the construction of
this act longer than the present session, for
the indications arc that, before the adjourn
ment of the regular session, it will have been
removed from 'the statute-book. Gen. Butler
is engineering a repeal movement in the House.
OTHER NOMINATIONS.

INTEREST ON THE FOUR FEB CENT BONDS.
A circular regarding the payment of the in

COIN VS. GOLD.
Secretary Sherman makes public his reply to
Colgate & Sons, of New York, who offered to
purchase $150,000 of the 4 per ccut bonds if the
Secretary would receive in payment silver bul
lion to an amount snilicicut to coin 150,000
silver dollars containing in each 41 'iy>
grains standard silver. The Secretary
gays: “ T am authorized to issue
these bonds only at par for coin, and as gold
coin is only authorized by law, I can only re
ceive gold coin. This department has sold,
within six months, over $75,000,000 of these
bonds at par for gold coin. With $150,000 of
bonds, coin, I can now buy silver enough
to coin 163,330 silver dollars. You offer, or, to
state it differently, you can buy with $137,337 of
gold coin. enough silver dollars to pay, as you
propose, for $150,000 4-per-cent bonds, and
thus, as an experienced broker, can make a
handsome profit of $12,003, It is true, you offer
to take silver dollars for your interest; but Ido
not see how this helps the Government, unless
it makes this a pretext to pay silver dollars to
those who paid gold for their bonds; but vou
would hardly think this fair or honest. The
Government might find this expedient to pay
the cheaper dollar so convenient that it might
think it better to adopt the Latin ratio of lT>h<
of silver to one of gold, and coin a dollar of 400
grains, with which to pay you. I know you
would not think this fair or honest, or do you
thiuk a subsidiary dollar, containing 355 grains,
is good enough to pay a bondholder? This, T
am sure, you would not think fair or honest. I
must, therefore, respectfully decline your offer,
and ask you to pay gold coin as others have done.
With the confident hope that the United States
will never pay you in a coin of less value than it
exacts from you, I am very respectfully,
“John Sherman, Secretary.”

THE MESSAGE.
A BOGUS RfcPORT. f
Soteial Dlerxttch to The Chiraao Tribune
Xew York, Dec. I.—The. .World's Washing
ton special savs the first annual message of the
President was uot read at the Cabinet meeting
to-day because it bad not been completed. A
special meeting is to be held to-morrow or on
Monday, at which it will be read in full. Ac
cording to the present understanding, it
will be mailed from here Sunday and
delivered to the press as soon as
submitted to Congress on Monday. The
President has been somewhat annoved
ay the conduct of a clerk detailed from
one of the Departments to do some copying
who has palmed off as part of the message
some views which the President wrote about a
month ago on the financial situation, but which
will form no part of the message, and which
wai be shown to be unite at variance with the
position which he assumed on the question of
the remonetization dl silver, though quite cor
reet as far as it represents him to be Deposed to
the repeal of the Resumption act. The Presi
dent and Secretary of the Treasury
abb is ZCCOED
on both of these important questions, and the
THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE
indications were to-day that-the .Cabinet was
unanimous in supporting them. In a word, tho
President and Secretary Sherman will earnestly
oppose the repeal or modification of the act of
3575 for the resumption of specie payments.
The President will favor the remonetization of
silver on any basis which will not impair the
public credit, and will therefore favor a restric
tion of its legal-tender character.
The message will take strong grounds m
favor of the protection of citizens and their
property on the Rio Grande border, and of the
settlement of our difficulties with Mexico, it
will also recommend great economy in every
branch of the public sendee, owing to the di
minished receipts of revenue.
The correctness of these foreshadowings of
the message will be confirmed on Monday by tho
message itself. -
NOTES AND NEWS.
RECEIVER GLOVER.
Special Dispatch to The Chicago Tribune,
Washington, D. C., Dec. 3.—The Comptrol
ler of the Currency has appointed Otis K.Glover
as Receiver of the Central National Bank of
Chicago.
Mills, of Texas, submitted for action in the
House an ill-advised resolution as to the reve
nue tariff. It was couched in language scarcely
parliamentary, and apparently designed to out
rage the sensibilities of persons who did not
share fully fiis views. It failed to secure two
thirds, but. tho strength it did receive shows
that any measure proposing a tariff for revenue
simply would receive the support of a very
largo majority.
The Senate Military Affairs Committee to-day
decided that civilian appointments to Second
Lieutenancies in the army (six or, seven are
now pending) should not be reported this ses
sion. They consequently all fall at its expiration.

Careful inquiry among Republican members of

STORMY SCENES IN PARLIAMENT—PERSONALI
TIES—TUE LIE GIVEN.
s' Dispatch to London Times.
Paris, Nov. 17. . . Is it necessary to say
that the Chamber was full to-day, that the Hi
laries were crowded to excess, and that feverish
excitement prevailed among both actors and spec
tators? The drama which had been acting be
hind the scenes for six months was at length
about to come before the public in broad day
light. To-day was to be read the report on the
proposal to appoint a Committee of Inquiry
into the actA of the Cabinet
during the painful period which had
elapsed since the ISth of June, and which, un
fortunately, is not yet closed. The whole inter
est of Paris, as will readily be believed, centered
in the Chamber. The work of the lobbies has
ceased: the work of the Assembly has begun.
'The country, public opinion, the conscience of the
whole world expect justice to be done, law and
order to be re-establish* d, and public pertuba
tors to be overthrown. The Left has nominated
a Committee of Investigation on all that has
happened during the elections, to bring
to light the proceedings indulged
in under the shadow of arbitrariness,
to point out cverv act of violence, and to call
merited punishment on every infringement of
the law.' It is possible the language of the ma
jority is violent, that their recitals contain ex
pressions which seem pointed at the Marshal, —
though this quite contrary to their Intentions, —
and that thev might have been more moderate
and skilful; but they certainly could not have
acted in more consonance with the universal
sentiment; they could not have afforded greater
satisfaction to the claims of justice.
The Cabinet, however, will doubtless take ad
vantage of this attack to misrepresent it, —
above all, to discover in it a pretext fop pro
longing its own existence; and the following
note, issued to-day by the semi-ollicial Agency,
shows that this is the first profit they have de
rived from M. Albert Grow’s proposition;
u The President of the Republic declared yes
terday to the members of the present Cabinet
that, in view ef the violent accusations
of which they had been the
object in the Chambers and which
applied to the whole Government, he could not
accept their resignation, and begged them to
remain at their pos^s.”
What does it signify whether the Marshal has
asked the Cabinet to remain or noil The fact
which underlies the whole situation was the
main point of the admirable speech of M. Leon
Renault, which took up nearly the whole sit
ting, and is that the Ministry of the ISth of
May still sat on the benches yesterday; that it
will still occupy them to-morrow.
At 3 o’clock* M. Loblond, the Reporter, as
cended the tribune, and read a report advising
the adoption of the project of appointing a
Commission of Inquiry into what happened
during the elections. As soon as the report was
finished a loud provincial voice cried, “./<• de
mandela parole!” Every one looked round,
and a peal of disrespectful laughter from the
Left saluted M. Nnma itaragnoo, who rushed to
the tribune. There are some causes which ill
luck pursues. That of the Cabinet is oi the
number. It* would have been difficult to find
among the Right a less popular, less serious, less
authoritative defender of the -Ministry. M.
llaragnon did not belong to the last Chamber,
fie was in the National Assembly, and be made
himself a kind of specialty for ascending the
tribune in moments of great embarrassment,
and extricating Cabinets, not by discussing the
question, but by making some diversion. This
specialty had acquired for him the sobriquet of
u Tcrre*Ncuvc,” and, by dint of having been
made u Terre Neuve,”hc got himself lifted into
an Under Secretarrship of State in the Interior,
underM. do Rroglic, and on the fall of M. de
IJroglie into a similar post in the Ministry
of .Justice, under M. Dcpeyre. The
last elections sent him back to the Chamber,
where he has just resumed his favorite occupa
tion, and it was he who opened the combat by
replying in his strong Southern accent to M.
Leblond’s report. According to M. Raragnon,
the appointment of that Commission of In
quiry is a revolutionary usurpation, and the
hafnber is not invested with the riirht of mak-
, imr laws for itself. Xobody need obey tin's
Commission. This inquiry was a combination
recalling the Convention; “but you are not
the Convention; you are only the phan
tom of the Convention, and it is sulli
cient to march upon you to make you
disappear.” [Cries from the Left, “That
is a threat!” “What do you mean by that”’]
Bon begged the Chamber not to com
irst offense ajrainst the Constitution,
.hat,” said he, in conclusion, “the
>n is protected by the Senate, by the
ic State, who wields the rightand tne
Vociferous applause from the Right.]
>rd of tliis speech, the ultima ratio
A oy the Right, points to its meaning. All these
Conservative Deputies deem that they have the
/right for themselves when they place them
/ selves behind a chief commanding 400,000
bayonets. This is the last word of all
Baragnons who urge coups d’etat, and who hope
they will not be the last-to profit by them.
What will come afterwards does not matter;
they have the might. You arc congratulated,
you think yourself a great orator, a future Min
ister. The rest is not worth consideration.
1 should like to give in extenso the splendid
speech of M. Leon Renault, who spoke for two
hours and a half, amid the uproar of the Right
and the applause of the Left. It can be imag
ined what, on such an occasion, could bo said
by a man whose talent has made him the
authorized mouthpiece of the majority. He
drew up against the Cabinet of the ISth of May,
without reference to the irresponsible Chief of
the State, the most formidable act of accusa
tion imaginable. He described it as dismissing
all agents of all classes directly or indirectly in
the service of the Government, dismissing Sena
tors from their pobts as Mavors, closing the
public thoroughfares to the liberal newspapers,
making the Marshal an electoral agent, dictat
ing to him manifestoes which overturned be
forehand the national will, having the preten
sion to govern with the Senate Alone, which
abolishes the national representation, and
making use of official placards to yilllfy the Re
publican Deputies. lie defended the right of
the Chamber to appoint special Commissions
of Inquiry, and depicted M. de Fourtou accept
ing the responsibility of these calumnies, the
Due de Broglie emulating the Due de Persigny,
the Magistracy degraded into the tool of official
persecutions, the clergy spurred into the con
diet, press prosecutions multiplied beyond
precedent, and, lastly, the Marshal put in .the
front to cover a Cabinet bound in honor tocover
him. In conclusion, be said:
“The Senate, a guarantee of nublic liberties
In the eyes of real Conservatives, is held up as
tbe instrument of a second dissolution, which
would be fatal to every guarantee of sqlf-govcni
meut. The Senate, however, having at its head
a man like the Due d’Audiffret-Pasquier, will
not allow its name to be thus abused. For the
first time the country sees itself confronted by
a Cabinet widen has foreseen and calculated on
tbe refusal of tbe Budget, and pleads that Prus
sia has existed four ’years without a regularly
voted Budget. It is not Conservative to pin the
country in a position without any appear
ance of pacific solution. The true Conservative
policy consists In recognizing what there is lust 1
in the national will. tVlth the fatal spirit or re- 1
Bistanco of the present Cabinet, every Con
servative interest and idea must be profoundly
uneasy.”
During this long indictment, the Cabinet, .
seated at tbe foot of the tribune, seemed really
conscious of the feelings it was exdtin*. The •
ardent apnlause of the Left which accom- 1
panied the speaker throughout hi* speech i
showed what restrained exasperation was in
those men who have been lighting for six
months against administrative aggression; and
when M. Leon Renault concluded, amid salvos
, of applause, it is easy to understand that M. de
Fourtou must have been glad, despite his hav
ing ascended the tribune, of the adjournment
till to-morrow. I have oulv one fault to find in
Jf. Renault’s speech. u The solution of the
conflict,” he said, u would have been very
simple. Had the electors declared the policy
. of the Cabinet right, the dissolution would have
' been, not only legal, but just and reasonable.
M. Jules Ferry, wbo said he had listened to
M. de Fourtou with more sadness than indig
nation, declared the retention ot otllce by the
Cabinet an insult to the country and an outrage
on common sense. Nothing had remained for
it to do but to turn to France, on which it had
pressed its heel for six months, and say, * ft is
you who are the oppressor.” The Cabinet was
a plagiarist of the Empire; but the Empire
addressed an enslaved country, whereas the
present Ministry addressed a free Chamber
and country, which comprehended the disgrace
of the official comlidath system, ft would be
an insult to the Republicans to defend them
against the grotesque imputation of coercing
the electors. It was their glory to have been
excluded, even the most moderate of them,
from an official list of candidates, the success of
which would have substituted M. Rouher for
the Due do Broglie. The adversaries of the
Republicans were implacable enemies of De
mocracy and universal suffrage, aud their do
raestic annoyances could only lead France into
a position unparalleled since Sedan. There
could only be a Republican majority or a Cleri
cal and Monarchist majority. The latter would
entitle the foreigner to consider his interests
menaced. Germany aud Italy, if, indeed, they
had not concluded an alliance against such a
result, had certainly provided against a Clerical
victory.
Here the Due Dccazes protested against such
an assertion; but M. Ferry adhered to it, and
he proceeded to justify the proposed investiga
tion, observing that the Times had described it
as conceived iii a strictly parliamentary spirit.
M. Jolibois (Bonanartfst) reminded him that
in England the House of Commons did not de
cide contested elections; but M. Ferry, replied
that this did nut affect the right of hfvestiga
tfon. Ifc denied the force of M. de Fourtou’s
precedents, remarking that they only showed
tiie difference between a regular Government
aud a Governmentof adventure; and he twitted
the Right, particularly M. do Broglie and M.
Baraguou, with having formerly condemned the
system of official candidates. He denied, more
over, that the 4th ol September practiced it in
IS7I, for it had virtually fallen before the
elections. There were merely Frefcctoral can
didates, and allowance must be made for the
then stale of France. The present Cabinet bad
gone to the verge of declaring a state of siege,
ami, by directing prosecutions for false news as
to foreign alliances, had shackled electoral com
munication.
Here the Due de Broglie, interposing, said
they had simply prevented criminal acts; on
which M. Ferry rejoined that to assert that
the Monarchy would lead to war had
been treated as punishable. The white
paper placards of official candidates he
denounced ns utterly unconstitutional; and, al
luding probably to u recent statement by the
.I [oniteur that the Due de Broglie was outvoted
on tin’s point by his colleagues; he remarked
that the Right sought to attenuate the impor
tance of the white placards, which were really
tantamount to a plebiscite, with this difference,
that the plebiscite was adverse—it was not sub- 1
milled to. From this to the factious language 1
put in tne mouth of the Head of the State'thcre i
was only one step, and that step was taken. 3
Here a storm arose at M. Ferry's use of the
word ‘‘factious”: ami, at the suggestion of tlie
President, he substituted the word “unconsti
tutional.” He then adverted to the theory of
the Chamber being in sr minority against the
Marshal and the Senate, and re • arked that the
Chamber could not seize the Cabinet by the
collar and fling it out; }*et, if it remained
on its bench only to undergo daily hu
miliations and rebuffs, it was a Ministry,
but nut a Government. After ridiculing the
Socialist bugbear as a police device, and declar
ing that the country wouhf have deserved a*
Dictatorship had it subnutted to the preten
sions of the Government, he denounced a sec
ond dissolution as a veiled coup d’etat, and af
firmed that France would not tolerate it, for
she was sovereign, and for six years had main
tained an admirable attitude.
Here the Right murmured, on which the
President reminded them that it was a reflec
tion on the nation to dispute M. Ferry’s tribute
M. Ferry adding that the democracy, from
being revolutionary, had become political, and
looked onlv to universal suffrage.
M. I.aroTbe Joubert (Punapartist) remarked,
“What about the Commune a question which
the President declared to be, in that connection,
insulting to the nation.
After applauding France for its forbearance
under infringements of Us liberties and in
an economical situation, which, if it lasted a
few weeks longer, would throw thousands out
of work, M. Ferry concluded-by saying*
“The attituue’of the French democracy has
called forth the admiration of England; but
when expecting at last to reap the fruits of its
patience, it Is told that its verdict stands for
nothing. Take care: there is blood in its veins.
If it is rebelled against, and threatened with a
second dissolution, not the Constitution mere-
ly, but. the public peace, the country itself, will
be endangered. If there arc men who, to main-
tain themselves in office and their coterie in
places are capable of staking the fate of France,
let them bo denounced to history, if, indeed,
i hev can escape the justice of their contem-
poraries.”
M. Spullcr then ascended the tribune to de
nounce an assertion made by M. Mitchell dur
ing M. Ferry’s speech that an article in a for
eign paper, which he had cited, as to Italo-Gcr
man relations, emanated from a contributor to
tiic Jtepnbiique Franchise. This, he said, was a
calumny worthy of the semi-official press.
Something of a scene ensued,
M. Mitchell—lf it is a calumny
M. A Haiti Targe—l forbid you to doubt it.
M. Mftchell—l do doubt it, notwithstanding
your assertion.
M. Allaiu Targe—Yon hare h*cd.
The President—l call M. AUaiu Targe to or
der.
M. Mitchell—My assertion rests on an official
document, and nobody will believe the contra-
diction.
M. Gambetta—There is no communication be
tween the JlemhUqne FrnneaUe and foreign
newspapers. That is a declaration lam bound
to make for the dignity of the country.
The President—This painful incident would
not have arisen but for M. Mitchell’s interrup
tion. [Uproar, during which M. Cnnco d’Ornano
vociferated.]
The President—l beg M. Cnnco d’Ornano not
to interrupt constantly, notwithstanding tnv
warnings.
The Chamber then adjourned till to-morrow,
when the Ducde Broglie will speak.

•Special I)lffnatch to The. CMcaan Tribune.
London, Dec. I.— The London Economist
says: The open market discount rates further
declined this week without waiting for the
Bank of England, which reduced its minimum
rate of interest to 4 per cent on Thursday. The
market quotation for three-mouths’ bills is now
3# per cent. A depression on the Paris Bourse
last Saturday affected prices in all the specula
tive markets of the Stock Exchange, but there
has since been a recovery, assisted by Increased
hopes of peace, on further successes of the
Russians in the Balkans, bv Lord
Derby’s reply to the deputation from the
Society for Protecting British’lnterests on
■Wednesday, by the reduction of the Bank rate
of discount to 4 per cent on Thursday, and on
Friday by reports of President MacMahon in
clining toward a Ministry irom the Moderate
section of the majority. 4
A desire to buy investment stocks is now no
ticed in many quarters. Colonial, Government,
and Railway stocks, Home Railway and Deben
ture stocks, and United States bonds, of which
the reports of sales from tais side have been
much exaggerated, being in demand. Consols
are now above 97, a point touched in July

THE CHINESE QUESTION.
Ban Francisco, Dec. I.—The Chinese Six
Companies have addressed a communication to
Secretary Evarts, in renly to Mr. Sargent’s
letter. They call attention to the fact that
eince the adoption of the treaty the United
States has received Irom China nearly $500,000
indemnity for outrages on American citizens
and property in China; that for years the
Chinese have heen robbed and murdered in
California, and not in one case in fifty
have the perpetrators been brought to justice;
that the punishment ot the Chico mur
derers is attributable to the influence and
money of the good citizens of San
Francisco, the result being an exception to the
rule; recall the recent anti-Chinese raid in
Placer County, and the July riots In this city, to
disprove .Mr. Sargent’s statement that county
officials have sought to punish offenders against
the Chinese and succeeded; they admit the
courts honest, but officers surrounding the ju
diciary are pledged to persecute them before
they get office; state that in twenty-five years
immigration has not exceeded emigration by
4,000 annually, and reiterate their desire ex
pressed to Senator Morton that the immigra
tion of Chinese should be restricted within cer
tain limits.

THE HURON DISASTER.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 1.--Lieut. Com
mander Green, on duty at the wreck of the
steamer Huron, telegraphs: “Paymaster
Sanders’ and Surgeon Cuthbert’s bodies arc re
covered and buried near this place. Lieut.
Palmer’s body is found. I hear of other offi

The Signal-Service observer at the wreck of
the Huron reports 7:15 p. m.: “Divers have suc
cessfully examined the wreck. The upper works
are all gone. The berth deck floats nearly to
the spar deck. Can’t get into the ward-room.
The spar deck is entirely submerged. The port
side is eight lect under water. The ship seems
legged about four feet. No bodies were recov
ered since the last report.”
The Signal-Service observer at Cape Henry
reports, 0:20 p. m.: “ The messenger sent to
notify the crews of the life saving stations be
tween Cape Henry and Kitty Hawk to patrol
the beach has returned, and reports being In
formed bv the crew of No. 4 Station that the
crews and citizens betweens Stations Nos. 4 and
5 found and buried sixty-two bodies washed
ashore since the wreck of the Huron. The
bodies were horribly mutilated, so much so that
identification will be almost impossible. TTic
messenger passed six graves five miles north of
No. 4 Station, and fragments of the wreck as
far north as No. 3 Station.”
CBATTX/ED A WAT AND DIED.
Special Dispatch to The Chicago Tribune.
Dubuque, la,, Dec. I.—Tbc dead body of a
man was found this morning in a barn situated
thirteen miles west of Dubuque. It was impos-
sible to ascertain his name. All that is known
of bis past life is that- he came from Sioux City,
and had pawned a watch there for SO, as the
check in bis pocket showed. It is thought that
he became sick, sought the barn for rest, and
died. When found," in's eyes were eaten out by
nits and mice, showing that he had been dead
several days.

special Dispatch to The Chicago Tribune.
Montreal, Dec. X.— A special says: gix
train-hands of the Southeastern Railway Com
pany who were engaged running a train loaded
to the Southeastern by the Vermont Central,
were arrested at Newport at the instance of the
Passumpsic Railway Company for alleged tres
pass bv running on the track of the Passumpsic.
An injunction has also been served on the offi
cers of the Southeastern forbidding them using
or running trains upon the Misslssquoi & Clyde
River Railroad, which is the eastern division of
the Southeastern, or upon that por
tion of the Southeastern between New
port and Richford. This action causes fresh
difficulty. The iniunction having been granted
by a Vermont Judge it only has effect in the
United States, consequently the Southeastern
at present operates a certain portion (Iving in
Canada) of the road beetween the two points men
tioned, while those portions lying on the-.othcr
side of the line are operated by the Passumpsic,
A force of volunteers are now guarding the
road at Mansonville, Quebec, and an attack is
hardly expected from the Passumpsic party to
recover possession.

Special Dispatchtn The Chicago Tribune
Ottawa, Dec. I.— Rufus Stephenson, M. P.
for Kent, and Maj. Lewis, of Windsor, Ont.,
have had an interview with the Minister of
Customs, in which they explained the difficul
ties that have arisen on our lake coasts through
the infringement of the coasting regulations
and custom laws of the Dominion bv United
States wreckers. It appears from the proof
they adduced that the Americans arc in the
constant habit or coming on Canadian shores
with tugs and barges to remove vessels driven
on shore or carrying away their caagoes, rigging
stores, etc., to the great Uisaclvantage of Cana
dians engaged in the business, ami at heavy
loss to the revenue. Nine well-established in
stances of American wrcckors haviug made
large amounts by salvage off Canadian
coasts were adduced, it being shown
that the pleas put. forward bv
the Americans that the vessels so salvaged came
under the meaning of the treaty clause
iug “distress” and “humanity” were "alto
gether unfounded.
This is the first occasion that the whole
bearings of this question were laid before the
Department, and the Minister of Customs re
ferred to the Department of Justice for an
exact explanation of the terms of the laws
framed for such cases. The explanation was
submitted and agrees with the views expressed
by the deputation, that the cases cited were
direct violations of both the customs laws and
coasting regulations. It is understood that
immediate steps will be taken to put a stop to
the operations of alien wrecking companies and
steamers on Canadian coasts.

Quebec, Dec. I.—The Quebec Government

are added in explanation of this work, amongst
which are the following: First, that the prohi
bition became necessary on account of wire

cases, by their acts seek to despoil holders of
located tickets of their hard-earned ri°-ht to the

THE RAILROADS.
THE ALTOX TO BE EXTENDED.
All doubts about the immediate extension'ot
the Chicago & AJton Railroad from Mexico
Mo., to Kansas City are note set at rest by tto
official announcement of the managers ot tne
road that the construction of the line will be
commenced in a short time. Mr. T. B. Black
stone has just returned from a visit through
the country through which the new line is to
run, and he brings the cheering intelligence that
he has received the assurance that all the aid
asked for of the towns and cities through which
the uew extension is to run will he forthcoo
ing. Ail that now remains to be done to beda
active operations is to net the consent of The
stockholders ot the road, which has to be ob
twined before further steps can bo taken, and
President Blaekstone issued a circular yesterday
asking their concurrence. But this is merely a
matter of form, as most of the Directors ini
stockholders have already signified their wifi,
ingness to have the improvement made with*
out further delay. The Chicago &
Alton Railroad Company can make no
leases and create no new debts
without the written consent of a majority of its
stockholders, and this will now be obtained
without further delay. It is stated that, bv a
careful estimate, tiie cost ot extendin'* the
Comnanv’s line across Missouri from Mexico to
Kansas City—l 62 miles—will be with the present
low prices of materials, including the bridga
across the Mis.-ouri River, depot grounds at
Kansas City, steel rails, etc., not over 53,000,003,
7 per cent upon which is only $210,000. Bv tia
most cautious estimates prepared by the Presi
dent of the Cidcago A Alton, the benefits of the
results to be derived bv the road from this ex
tension will not be less than $700,000, net. Tba
officers of the Chicago have long since given
facts and figures showing that the road will loso
the money already invested in the Louisiana &
Missouri Road if it is not completed at once ta
Kansas City. But hot alone in this respect vrfll
the Chicago <& Alton Koad be tha
gainer by the completion of the lice.
For years this Company has been
sending its cars to Kansas City over anotber
Company’s track, hauling away more grain

AN IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT.
Mr. George O. Manchester has been appoint
ed Assistant General Superintendent of the Chi
cago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad with head
quarters in this city, the appointment to taka
effect Dee. 3. It has long since been stated in
The Tribune that on the retirement of Mr. W.
B. Strong, the present General Superintend
ent of the road, which will take place on
the loth of tins mouth, Mr. C. E.- Perkins,
the Vice-President would assume the activu
management of the road. Mr. Perkins, whoii
also General Manager of the Burlington &
Missouri River Railroad in Nebraska, will bt
compelled to be absent from the city much ot
the time, and this appointment has been made
with the view of having a man here continually
who is in full accord with the Forbes-Rerklos
interest and who will carry out their in
structions regardless of the wishes of the other
officials of the road who are suspected of being
unfriendly to that interest. Mr. Manchester is
well qualified for the performance of the duties
of his new position. He graduated with Mr.
Perkins on the Missouri River Railroad, and
when Mr. Strong went to the Michigan Central
ay General Superintendent he appointed him
private secretary. When Mr. Strong left the
Michigan Central to assume the position of
General Superintendent of the Chicago, Bur
lington & Quincy Mr. Manchester was again
retained as his private secretary, which position
he has occupied ever since.
It is not probable that other changes in tha
management of the road will be made before
next spring, excent that Mr. Hudson, the Divis
ion-Superintendent at the end of the line will
resign to accept a position on the Baltimore &
Ohio. Mr. Tubbs, the present efficient Superin
tendent of Telegraph, will most likely succeed
Mr. Hudson. What will be done next spring
depends entirely on the result of the annual
election, when a determined fight as to who
is to control will again be made bv the same
factions who opposed each other two or three
years ago, when the Joy dynasty came to grief.
