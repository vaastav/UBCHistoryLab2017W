Gornam Writes a Letter to

Washington, December 9. The
Republican publishes the following:
Office of National Republican,
Washington, D. C , Dee. 8.
Dear General: I had a conversa
tion with the President this evening
in relat on to the statement in to-day V
"Post" and "Star," of this city, at
tributing to him certain views on
the eecatorial election in Virginia.
Ia those statements h is represented
a? expressing a wish for the defeat cf
Riddleberger. I Jearn from him tbtt
this is wholly destitute ot founda
tion. In v the interview which has
been eo grossly misrepresented he
was told that it hail been fctated that
he was taking part in the matter in
behalf of Riddleberger. He merely
stated tnat he has not interferred at
all. He suggested that Senator
Lewis had a friendly talk with you
on the subject.
The President expressed no desire
as to the political antecedents of the
man who shculd be elected; nor did
he say one word, which correctly
stated, would in the slightest de
gree embarrass you or call in ques
tion your course on the contrary,
He desires it understood that he has
no viewd which in any manner con
rlict with friendly sentiments hither
to expresbed by Litn to you. These
assurances are as unnecessary to 3011
as they are to me, but they may be
useful in correcting misapprehen
sion. Very truly yours,
Geo C. Gorhah,
To Hon. War. Mahone.
GUITEAU.
More Experts Heard for the Pros
ecution. Washington, D. O, December 9.
The Guiteau trial attracted a larger
crowd to-day than for several days.
Dr. MacArthur agein took tho stand.
Mr. Scoville addressed the Court and
objected to the character of the evi
dence which had been given by the
witness on the ground that evidence
to any other crimes could not be in
troduced here when the prisoner is
on trial for this particular offense.
H9 desired that all such evidence
should be stricken -out. The Court
ruled that evidence could be admit
ted to show the general character of
the prisoner. . The witness then tes-
tified as to interviews with the pris
oner, and said he never saw any in
dications of insanity in the ' prisoner.
Several other witnesses were exam
ined all of whom testified to the same
effect, and the court then took the
usual recess.
Several witnesses were examined ;
all of whom had known Guiteau in
the west or in Boston, and none
supposed him insane, though all
thought him lacking in moral char
acter. Rev. R. S. MacArthur, pastor of
the Calvary Baptist Church, New
York, testified that Guiteau had
been a member of his church, and
had betn cited before tha coEgrega
tion for immoral conduct.
This witness' testimony irritated
Guiteau greatly. Scoville objected
to the admission of this testimony,
when the District Attorney announc
ed tbat the object was to demon
strate that what the deiendant calls
insanity ia nothing more than devil
ish depravity.
The questions put to President
Arthur and his answers were put in
evidence as follows:
" Do you know the prisoner in this
case :
"Yes."
"How many times and where did
ycu ever see him?"
" I have seen him at least ten times
and possibly as often as twenty times
altogether, mostly in and about the
the rooms of the Republican State
Committee in the Fifth avenue hotel,
New York city, in the fall of 1880,
and two or three t'mes in the streets
of Washingtonin the spring of 1881."
"What conversation, if any, did
you ever have with him?''
"None, excepting to return the
ordinary salutations of the day, and
once or twice in answer to his ra
quests to bo employed in the cam
paign as a speaker by the Republican
State Committee, of which I was
chairman."
"What political services, if any,
did the prisoner render to the Re
publican party during tho last Presi
dential campaign?"
"None that I know of."
"Was there ever anything to your
knowledge in his relations to your
self, or to Gen. Grant, or to Senator
Logan, or to any other leader of the
Republican party socially or polit
icaily furnishing a shadow of a rea
sonable claim on his part for political
preferments?"
"No." .
'Did you or not give him any
reason to think that he had or could
have any political or personal influ
ence with you?"
"1 never did"" I have been re
quested by the counsel for the de
fense to produce a letter written by
the prisoner and inclosed to me by
bis counsel since his indictment.
That letter . was received by me in
the month of October last, but was
not preserved."
"I do not remember its contents
particularly, excepting that it con
tained some claim to have rendered
important services to the Republican
party in the Presidential campaign,
and an appeal for a postponement of
his trial to give him time to prepare
bis defense." '

The Flipper Case,
San Antonio, December 9. Argu
ments in the Fipper case were de
livered to-day, and the court rendered
its verdict, but what it is will not be
known until passed upon by the re
viewing authorities. The question
of embezzlement was dwelt upon at
length by b th sides. Defense
claimed that Flipper could not be con
victed legally under the charge, and
that aside from that, he was entirely
innocent of any guilty intention
or conluct tending to establish
embezzlement. That he had been
carele83 in his manner of selling
commissaries to enlisted men and to
laundries on time; and in not collect
ing money, but not dishonest, That
when he discovered his shortage he
was afraid to speak of it because of
his peculiar position in the army,
and he was then led into making a
false statement, hoping to be able to
raise money to make all counts good

upon certain negroes, and on arrest

took the party arresting him to the
place where the money was buried.
He was placed in jail at

ON THE
lie Takes a Somewhat Gloomy Yiew
of the Future.
Special to New York Tribune.
Washington, D. C, December 7.
"What do you think of President
Arthur's first message ?' asked a
Tribune correspondent of Represen
tative Atkins, of Tennessee, tp-day.
" I have not read the whole f it,
but as far as I have read I have
found it a lucid, modest, statesman
like document. I was greatly
pleased to find that Grant had not
been able to give it a bloody shirt
cast, as I had feared he would do. I
begin to think that Arthur means to
be President himself and of the
whole country."
" What do jtou think of his recom
mentations respecting the tariff and
finances?"
' Oh, of course I do not agree
with him there. I am for a tariff for
revenue only, and cuttiog down the
duty on every article until the blood
is drawn. 'No protection' is my
motto. Then I am for the unlimited
coinage of silver and the abolition of
the National Banking system."
"What about the question of poly
gamy?" " I think I am with the President
there, at least so far as making a
polygamous wife a competent witness
against her polygamous husband is
concerned. That is all Congress can
do, and I am in favor of it. I am
also greatly pleased with the Presi
dent's position respecting the im-
provement of the Mississippi river.
e ought to make the most of all
our water ways. I regret to find,"
continued Mr. Atkins, " that the PreC
sident did not take bold, high ground
against railroad monopolies and in
favor of legulating transportation
rates by law."
" What will or ought to be, in your
opinion, the policy of the DemecraU
hi CoDgress this session f asked the
correspondent. .
"We ought to (and I hope we will)
go in for a modification of the tariff
in the direction I before suggested ;
for the abolition of the National
banks and the unlimited coinage of
3ilver ; for liberal improvement and
against monopolies of every sort. I
do not know whether it will make
any difference what we do, however,''
continued the Tennessee statesman
somewhat plaintively ; "for, no mat
ter what we attempt, we seem fore
ordained to defeat. We ought to
stop our foolishness and stand by
our principles, which are the eternal
principles of truth and justice, po
litically Bpeaking."
"xou do not appear to fifrree with
-Senator Voorhees in regard to what
some of them are; say the tariff,
for example?" suggested the corres
pondent. "Of course I do not; nor with
Randall either. I did not give him
my vote for the speakership. I am
not the same kind of a Democrat
that he and some others are."
"What is the political outlook in
Tennessee?" asked the correspond
ent. -
"Gloomy, gloomy for us," was the
sad reply.
"Will there be an effort to repeal
the law passed last winter for the
settlement of the State debt?"'
"Undoubtedly there will. The
success of the Ileadjuster movement
in Virginia has sadly demoralized the
Democratic party in Tennessee.
Thousands of 'State credit' Demo
crats are now in favor of repudiation
or of scaling the debt. I have
hitherto stood for maintaining
the faith and credit of the
State and paying every dollar she
owes, but I confess that I am now
inclined to support a measure which
will be proposed to scale the debt
down to one half the principal and
two thirds of the interest ; in other
words, a proposition to pay 50 per
cent, of the principal, and 4 instead of
6 per cent, on that."
" How does the Republican party
in Tennessee regard that proposi
tion ?"
" Oh, they are opposed to it. It
will be the main issue in our State
election next year."
"Will all the 'State credit' Demo
crats support it?"
" No, a great many of them will
undoubtedly vote with the Republi
cans to preserve and execute the law
passed last winter."
" Which party will be likely to
win ? ' -
"Oh, I suppose that, as. usual, we
shall be beaten. The Democratic
paity, as I said before, seems doomed
to defeat, no matter what it attempts."

CONGRESSMAN ATKINS
SITUATION.
The PeaitentUry Fire.
The latest estimates fix the loss to Messrs.
Cherry, O'Connor & Co., lerteea; at $2."i0,000,
in round numbers, by the destructive fire at
the penitentiary Monday evening, and their
actual insurance was (99,000; this includes
machinery and material. The low to the
State, in the destruction of buildings, is
placed at $33,000.
Aa investigation by Governor Hawkint
and Comptroller Nolan, Treasurer Polk
and Seeretarv of State Nunn, ex
officio : inspectors of the penitentiary, de
veloped the fact that the fire was entirely
accidental. It seems that one of the con
victs, whose duty it was to black the wagon
irons by heating them and dipping them j
into a kettle of coal tar, heated the iron to
hot, and when it was put in the tar it blazed
up, catching the wall, on which tar had
been dripped, and burning so fast that it
was impossible to check the fire.
It was understood that the rebuilding of
the shops for the machinery, &o., will be
commenced at once, "and Messrs. Cherry,
O'Conner A Co., Lave volunteered to fur
nish the inspectors with the mouey to re
place the buildings, which will obviate the
necessity of an appropriation by the present
special session of the Legislature for that
purpose. The new buildings will be
erected far enough apart to prevent another
auch coi flagration, and will be so arranged
that they can be sold for manufacturing
purposes, in the event of the removal of the
penitentiary.
Speaking of the operations of Messrs.
Cherry, O'Conner So Co., the American says:
Few are aware of the immense business
done by this firm. In the first place they
have had to provide a stock of lumber two
years ahead of its use, They received 100
car loads of lumber by rail per month and
an equal quantity "by river. Betiides, lum
ber is hauled to them out of Davidson coun
ty, as far as fifteen miles. From October 1,
1880, to October 1, 1881, they expended
$815,000 for lumber alone. They have es
tablished a mill near Cclina on the Upper
Cumberland, and this has been sawing out a
large amount of lumber, which was brought
here by river.
The lessees confine themselves to the man
ufacture of wagons, making, before.the fire,
an average of forty-five wagons complete,
per day ; castings, stoves and hollow ware,
making 8,000 pounds per day, and furni
ture, making from $90,000 to 100,000 per
annum.
The Inspectors have advertised for plans
for tho new shops contemplated. They
have received from the Superintendent and
Warden a communication urging that
prompt and immediate action be taken to
replace the buildings. An estimate has been
drawn p fixing the cost of erecting the
buildings that are necessary at f 41,500.

Loxoon, December 9. The steam
er British King, from Liverpool for
Philadelphia, returned to Queens
town to-day, having lost two bladre
of her fan when 600 miles west of
Fastnet.
The steamer Monarch, bound from
Gibraltar for Antwerp, which is a
month over due, is supposed to have
foundered in the Bay of Biscay, and
it is feared all hands, numbering. 40
persons, a-e lost.
The Standard's dispatch from
Vienna says: "The estimated audi
ence in the theater numbered 2,000,
and many persons were trampled
to death in the panic which enpued.
As Boon as the fire waa seen there
was an explosion of
audience wh plunged
gas, and the
in darknes?."
A later telegram from Vienna,
dated this morning, says that two
hundred and Beventy bodies have
been recovered from the ruins of the
Ring theatre. The fourth gallery
has not yet been explored. It ia x
lieved that not a single person es
caped from that gallery, and tbat
very few escaped from the third gal
lery. The corpses last recovered
are little more than charred frag
ments. Gross neglect is charged
against the management of the thea
tre. The law prescribes the use of
oil lamps in the corridors ef thea
ters, 60 that exit shall be discernable
in the event f a failure of the gar.
But this precaution was utterly ne
glected. The person in charge of
the proscenium between the stage
and auditorium appears to have fled
at the first alarm.
The Manchester Guardian in its
commercial article this morning says :
The demand continues slow from &11
directions. Prices are not appar
ently affected by American advices,
indicating a more abundant supply
of cotton than has lately been looked
for.
