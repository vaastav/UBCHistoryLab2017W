tho weather has been milder and the
oldest resident although he never saw
the like before predicts an open

Tho drouth of last summer was more
severo here than in McLennan county
Added to tho terrors of the drouth tho
farmers hero had the chintzbug to
contend with and what the former
would have spared tho latter devoured
As a consequence prices have reached

Washington Decomber 8 Tho
courtroom was again densely packed
this morning Mrs Julia M Wilson
of Ltadville Col was the first wit

was her uncle aud she knew him from
her earliest recollection She gave a
most feeling account of the life and
character of her mother Mrs May
uard who it had been alleged
by the defense had died in
sane who died from pneumonia
in 1850 The witness was her constant
attendant up to her death and never
saw tho slightest indication of llighti

Guiteau during the examination of
witness becamo greatly excited and
interrupted the witness several times
At the conclusion of the witness ex

her testimony and the court took a re

AVlia < irlicltt Meant
As to the translation of Straugula
tus pro Bopublica written by tho
dying president John Hay writes
Tho Lntin straugulare in its literal
sense applies exclusively to death by
choking or suffocation It is derived
without change of meaning from a cor
responding Greek verb which comes
in turn from the noun straggala a
halter So good a Latinist as the pres
ident would scarely have chosen n word
of such narrow aud inappropriate
meaning when the hotter word occesus
to doscribo death by wounding must
have been ready to bis hand But there
is n metaphorical moaning of tho word
strangulatuH which is used by poets
in writers of postclassical prose es
pecially writers upon law which was
probably iu General Garfields mind
as he lay chained to hiu bed in that
long midsummer agony The word in
that sense moans tortured or tor
meiitod Thero is anthority for such
a use of it in Ovid Seneca and Juve
nal All tho evidence we havo indi
cates that on the 17th of July tho pres
idents own hope of recovery as well
as that of his attendants were till
strong May we not then reasonably
infor that this most impressive aed
memorable legend means tortured for

National cotton planters association
continued iu session today and trans
acted regular business F C Moore
head was reelected president George
M Kline treasurer and James N Og
den secretary
The United States commissioner of
agriculture General Loring delivered
an address on tho mutual relations of
American industries in the course of
which he said the relations existing
between the cotton plantation and the
market created by American manu
factures were deeply interesting to
this association which represents that
great branch of agriculture I
learn from the Cotton Move
ments and Begulations eompilted
by R P Salter n member
of the New York cotton oxclmuge that
of the total crop ot 18701 of 1152371
bales 11101 bales were consumed in
the United States Of the total crop of
18JO7 of 3832961 bales 1193005
bales were consumed in the United
States aud of tho crop of 18801 ot
oG05750 bales 1908937 bales were con
sumed in the United States The in
crease of home consumption during
tho ten years from 1870 to 1881
was 828741 bales This increase is
more important considering the fact
that the loss of cotton sold in the
English market is nearly two cents per
pound freight port charges and loss of
weight in bagging etc and the aver
age price in 18801 in Liverpool was
G t8100d and in New York 11 31lD0c
per pound the advantage of
the American niarkot being nearly two
cents a pound to tho producer This
important relation will continue to
increase its value as American manu
facturing extends aud home markets
aro enlarged and will undoubtedly
produce an increose in the average
yield of cotton per acre and au ulti
mate uniformity of the crop of the cot
ton states allowance being made for
difference in the estimates This
added to the wide diversity of farming
which will be adopted will do much
to develop the agriculture of this sec
tion It is undoubtedly true now that
the cotton belt needs varieties of crops
to fill the vast unoccupied areas not
suited to tho cottou plant Applause
Niueteuths of the superficial area of
these states yields no production in
agriculture except in a limited degree
in pasturage and wood products but
three acres in every hundred is planted
iu cottou which occupied onethird
of the breadth of the laud ac
tually cultivated The cotton urea
in 1879 was 144G2t3S acres The area
of tho ten cotton states is 47000000
acres Tho cottou cropis not ovenly dis
tributed in these states It is almost
unknown iu the whole mountain sys
tem of sonth slopes as well as summits
aud broad table lands of high eleva
tion suited only to products of a high
temperature latitude of a mixed char
actor as grain nnd dairy products It
is grown mainly on the limestone belt
of southwestern Georgia central Ala
bama and western Mississippi In
general terms onetenth of tho coun
ties yielding cotton produce onehalf
cf that crop Tho largest average
yield per acre according to tho census
discloses local bolts of greatest pro
ductiveuosa as follows Tho richest
land is iu the states on the Mississippi
and above aud opposite the city of
Vicksburg are tho highest county
nverages The jield in three
states proves the superiority of this
district East Feliciana in Louisiana
Chico in Arkansas and Washingtonin
Mississippi respectively stand for tho
largest rate of productiveness in theso
states and the cotton belt yielding in
1879 but littlo less tisan a bale per acre
Second best district is also in Mississip
pi and represents tho best yield of three
states Dunklinin MississippiLake in
TcnuesseeSand Hickman in Kentucky
In same way are grouped Cherokee iu
Alabama with Polk in Georgia Marl
borough iu South Carolina and Rich
mondin North Carolina Nine counties
north and east of Balleigh North Car
olina part of the state produce half of
the crop of that and adjoining district in

London December 8 The Times
in an editorial commenting on the mes
sage of President Arthur says The
languishing condition of tho Ameri

due to tho effect of protection but
President Arthur ouly discovers in it a
reason for lamenting that this branch
of enterprise has not boen protected
and for suggesting that the
omission bo supplied It is
difficult to see how protection can bo
applied to the carrying trade except
in tho shape of bounties which will
however have an ndvnutage as the
