at noon, proceeded, in accordance with
lav , lo call the roll of the members elect of the
Tl.irty-ninth Congress.
Mr. Maynard (whose name is not on the roll)
w antfd to make a suggestion, but the Clerk relu>ed
to be interrupted.
The roll call was completed, 175 members
having answered to their names.
Mr. Morrill moved that the House proceed
to the election of a Speaker.
Mr Maynard desired to submit a remark before
that question was put.
Mr. Stevens called the gentleman to order.
Mr. M? Pherson, the Clerk, said he could not
recognize any one as a member whose name
was not on the roll.
J>Ir. Brooks hoped the motion wonld not prevail
until it was settled whether Mr. Maynard
was a member ol this House, or entitled to*be
beard, lie hoped the House would not proceed
to any revolutionary steps, as now indicated.
If Tennessee was not in the I'nion and a loyal
State, by what right does the President himself
hold bis seat at the White House J He trusted
the gentleman would be heard, for if the rule
of exclusion should prevail, the Clerk would
have an over hadowing power, in violation of
the principles of republican government.
Mr. Rrooks, in further discussion of the subject,
asked by what law of right old Virginia
was excluded, and why was Louisiana, whose
members at the commencement of the lurmer
Congress, were allowed to vote for Speaker.
He said, in the course of his speech, that the
r? solution adopted by the Republican caucus

Mr. McPherson held the point to be well
taken.
Finally, tinder the operation of the previous
question, the House proceeded to the election
of a Speaker.
Mr. Morrill nominated Hon. Schuyler Colfax
Mr. Win Held nominated Hon. Jas. Brook?.
Messrs. Morrill, Dawson, Smith and Fink
w? re appointed tellers.
The result was announced:
Whole number of votes, 175; necessary to a
choue, ??.
! Of which Mr. Colfax received 139

Mr. Colfax was therefore declared elected

speech, some parts of which were applauded,
and expressed his gratitude for the
honor again conlerred upon him. The speech
is as lollows:
OtHtlrmennf the Tfr/uteof R<pre*entalivet:?The
re-ass* mblmg of Congress, marking, as it does,
the procession of our national history, is al ways
regarded with interest by tbe people for whom
it is to legislate. But it is not unsafe to say that
millions more than ever before, North, South,
East, and West, are looking to the Congress
which opens its first session to-day with an
earnestness and solicitnde unequalled on similar
occasions in the past. The Thirty-eighth
CongTess closed its constitutional existence with
the Storm cloud of ur.ir at 11 1 Inworin rr ftvn*.
And, alter a nine months' absence, Congress
rwcmcs it? legislative authority in those Council
Halls, rejoicing that from shore to shore in
our land there is peace.
Its duties are as obvious as the snn's pathway
in the heavens. Representing, in its two
branches, the State* and the people, its first
and hiphest obligation u to guarantee to every
State a republican form of Government. The
rebellion having overthrown constitutional
State government* in many States, it is yours
to mature and enact legislation which, with
th< concurrence ot the txecutive, shall establi.-h
them anew, on such a basis of enduring
justice as will guarante? all necessary safeguards
to the people, and afford, what our
>I:igiia Charta, tbe Declaration of Independence,
proclaims is the chief object of Government?protection
to all men in their inalienable
rights. The world should witness, in this great
work, themost inflexible fidelity. ih?* most "amest
devotion to the principles of liberty and
humanity; the truest patriotism, and the wisest
statesmanship.
Heroic men by the hundreds of thousands
have dud that the Republic might live. The
inblems of mouru.ng have darkened White
House and cabin alike. Hut the fires of civil
war have melted ev?-ry fetter in the land, and
proved the funeral pyre ot slavery. It n for
you. representatives, to do your work as faithfully
and as well as did the fearless saviors of
iLe Vision on their more dangerous arena of
duty.
'1 lien we may hope to seethe vacant and
once abandoned seats around us gradually tilling
up, until this Hall t-hall contain Representatives
from every Slate and District, their
hearts devoted to the I'uion for which they are
to legislate, jealous of its honor, proud of its
glory, watchful of its rights, and hostile to us
entmies. And the stars on our banner that
paied wh? n the States tliey represented arrayed
th< mselves inarms against the nation
u ill rhine with a more brilliant light of loyalty
than ever before
luvoking the guidance of Him who hold the
destinies of nations In the hollow of his hand,
1 enter again upon the duties of this trying
position, with a heart filled with gratitude to
\oi. for the unusually flattering manner in

'1 he oaths of office was^idmini*tered by Hon.
K li. Wai^hbume, of Illinois, the oldest consecutive
member ol the House. The oaths
were then administered to the members present,
by del?-cat?ons, in order.

the Chief Justices of counties to raise a special

Gov. Hamilton has issued a very sensible

In some of the interior counties the freedmen
commenced making contracts for the next

generally abandoned planting except so far as
was necessary for the support of their families.

CONGRESS. ?
THS OPKWISO S(K!?E8?INTERESTING PROOUDIIOS.
The Capitol was densely crowded by visitors
to-day, for the purpose of witnessing the
opening scenes of Congress. Since last session
considerable improvement has been made to
the interior, and the jails begin to assume their
intended appearance. The old railing and
wall which obstructed the passage from the
rotunda to the Congressional library ha* been
removed, and a neat nrhim m*rhl? raiiin? inh.
stituted. in the rotunda, several new paintings
are displayed, but tbe ceiling is |till unfinished,
a platform, used by tbe artists engaged
in painting tbe upper portious of tbe
arch. obstructing tbe view into the apex of the
dome. The staircase leading to tbe lop of tbe
dome is completed, and a number of parties,
for the first time, climbed to the lofty height, to
obtain a view of the city and its environs. The
pass-age from the eastern portico of the south
wing to the Hall of Representatives is also
finished, adding very mncb to the beauty
of thai portion of the building. The
oid Hall In it3 new dress presents a very fine
appearance. Tbe floor of marble tile is all laid
down, and several busts of distinguished m?*n
are mounted on pedestals within tbe high
bronze railing which borders tbe narrow passage.
A new carpet, imported from France,
has been put down on the floor of the House,
| and new furniture has been added to many of
the adjacent apartments. With the exception
I ot tht? mrrp.wd nnmhor nf fni? mamhuM
the Hall presents, however, th?* same appearance
as last winter, the carpet being light preen,
with small orange.coloreu stars. Xo change is
noticeable in the Senate wing.
Hy 12 o'clock all the corridors surrounding
the Hall of Representatives were blocked up
by the throug, hundreds making strenuous efforts
to force a passage into the reporters' gallery,
which by great exertion on the part of th*
doorkeeper, was preserved exclusively for the
members of the press. Th*? families of r presentatives
ot foreign governments filled th?>
gallery assigned to the diplomatic corps, many
being compelled to stand in tb^ aisle and doorway.
During the call of the roll by the ClTk
of the House, the space in rear of the members'
ureia >vu wiupiru ay a crown oi visitors,
whom the doorkeepers were unable to eject.
There were quite a number of Southern Representatives
present, most of them taking
seats among the other members.
As the Clerk was calling the roll of the members
lrom New York, Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee,
rose to speak, but was prevented from
proceeding by the Clem, who stated that no
remarks at that time were in order. At the
conclusion of the call of the roll, Mr. Morrill,
| of Vermont, moved that the House proceed to
the election of Speaker. Mr. Maynard again
attempted to be heard, hut was silenced by
cries of order. Mr. lirooks, of New York, protested
against the refusal to hear Mr. Maynard.
and spoke at considerable length, claiming that
if Tennessee was not a State of the Union, and
if Maynard was to be regarded as an alien, the
j Pret-ident of the United States, a citizen of Tennessee,
was also an alien and an usurper. He
also demanded that the members from Virginia
and Louisiana shonld be admitted, and
denounced the refusal of the House as despotism.
Mr. Brooks was frequently called to order
during his remarks by Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania,
and others, and finally sliced Mr.
Stevens when he proposed to consider the
question. Mr. Stevens replied that he "proposed
to consider it at the proper time." The
response elicited considerable applause from
the members and spectators. Mr. Brooks then
moved as an amendment to the motion for an
election of Speaker that Mr. Maynard be allowed
to make his statement. This was loudly
I uujcviru iu.
After further discussion of a similar nature,
the election of Speaker was ordered. Mr. Morrili,
of Vermont, nominated Mr. Colfax, and
Mr Winlield, of New York, nominated Mr.
Brooks, of the same State.
THE NATIONAL DEBT.
The monthly* statement of the public debt,
now issued for the month of November last by
Mr. Secretary McCulloch, presents a remarkable
improvement in our financial affairs.
Wise and judicious management, and wholesome
economy, have produced a marvelous reduction
in current expenses, and largely increased
the public revenue. The Secretary of
the Treasury has good reason for congratulaf?rm
on th? \risHnm ha hna
successful management of the financial department
of the Government. Some of his
projects were severely criticised by many who
indulged in evil predictions as to the results.
These persons may now see the signal success
of these efforts by the great reduction of the national
debt in the short space of time which has
Happed since the cessation of the rebellion.
Be'ow is given tne most important items of the
statement fot November:

place ai bis father's residence yesterday afternoon.
Mr. Fort was a third assistant engineer
in the Navy.and hau arrived herein the Stonewall,
lrom which ship he was removed on
Friday evening, being then very sick with a
fever, which was accompanied by symptompronounced
by the medical officers on bo?rd to
be yellow fever, and died on Saturday morning.
This, we believe, is the only case of death
that has occurred among the Stonewall's complement
since her arrival b? re, although one
other died in Havana. Some of the crew were
not in good health when they left Aun&poli* to
join the Stonewall, but when the vessel went
out of commission on Saturday there was no
sickress among them.
The Stonewall has been hauled out in the
stream, tha- she might be thoroughly ventilated
and cleansed betore she is thrown open to
visitors. This order was given previous to the
sickness of Mr. Fort, being deemed necessary
by the Department as aprecautiouarv measure,
as the Stonewall had been lying in the port of
Havana during roost of the summer. It is
report* a that a fireman had died on board, and
that others are sick with fever, but such is not
the case*
Since the Stonewall's arrival the Farragnt
court martial, the officers of the yard, and a few
others only have been on board, ehe lying in the
stream most of the time, (having laid at the
wharl but one day) preventing the public from
going on her.
Nayt Yard?Further Reduction nf the Force.?
This morning. a further redaction of the number
ol workmen in the Navy Yard was made
under the recent orders, by the discharge ot 64
from the boiler shop; 1* from the iron foundry;
and 8 from the pattern shop. The Department
has directed that hereafter, in the employment
of qnartermen, one shall be allowed to every tS
workmen employed out doors, and 40 in doors,
instead of as now, in shop or out.
The Hornet (formerly the blockade runner
I-ady Sterling) left on Saturday for New York,
where she will be sold?about one-half of the
Stonewall's crew having first been translerred
to her, that vessel going out of commission.
The new gunboat Augusta, lately built at the
Messrs. Denmeads ship yard In Baltimore, arrived
on Saturday afternoon in tow of two
tugs, and lies in the stream awaiting an oppor
muiiy 10 usui in ana r*ceiTf' ner micmnerv
and outfit. She is about the eiz?? of the Rhode
Inland, and is a flue looking specimen of marine
architecture.
A Pi rlic Wast.?Edttor Star: Will the Star
please hint to the Washington and G-eorfretown
Kailroad Company the desirability of exteudding
their track from the vicinity of the Wallach
School House to the Congressional Cemetery,
for the benefit of the numbers who desire
to TiEit that place, especially ladies and
children. The want of such a mode of conveyance
is shown by tbe inconveniencew to
which the throngs of visitors there are put, especially
when in bad weather they are obliged
to pick their way along the center of the street,
<orratherroad.il subjected to be run over bv
in>t drivers. The Congressional Cemetery is
much a matter of public Interest, a.?ide from
the nomber of persons resorting there to Tint
the resting place of relatives and frit ids, t&M
the running of cars to the Cemetery would be
a paying invesjment to the com]?any.

cember term of the Criminal Court was couvened
this morning, Judpe Fisher on the bench;
but no jurors having been summoned, there
being no ballots in the boi to draw from, the

Mr. Wm. A. Mulloy, recently one of the Marshal's
deputies, has been appointed crier ot the
court by the entire bench, in place of Mr. l>ennison,
and from his long experience about the
court-house will prove a valuable officer.
It is stated that before the requisite number
of jurors can be procured legally, Congress
must pass s special act: and that an efTurt will
he made 10 procure the passage of an act this

and the business of the term commenced on

New Boat ok the Ai.kxasdp.ta Route.?
The steamer Winnissimmit, designed for the
Washington and Alexandria route, Arrived
here tliis morning at lu o'clock, after a pleasant
trip of twenty-four hours from Baltimore.
Though recently in the use of the Government,
she can be called comparatively new, having
recently undergone a thorough repair, and her
sp*ed, as shown by her trip from Iialtimons
is adequate to the accommodation of the traveling
public. She was brought around in charge
o a special party, invited to undertake the trip
bv our pubic spirited f?*llow-ditizen, Mr. John
Van Ki*wick, and the success of the trip is the
bei t evidence of the fidelity with which they
performed their duties. After an auspicious
entry into Washington, we can only wish the
Winnissimmit a career of success.

was arrested last night by Serjeant Q?asford
on suspicion of setting Are to the stables owned

was destroyed by fire between nine'and ten
o'clock. The property was located at the corner
of 3d street west and V iririnia avenue. The
accused is the wife of one of the owners, and
the evidence so far is simply ihat she
threatened to burn the stables. She is held for
further hearing.
