Ruef Found Guilty on Sixth Ballot Alter 24 Hours

IS EXPOSED

Miss M. C. Ellis, an Oakland
school Teacher, Bares Queer
Dealings of Clairvoyant
Declares J. Hobart Deane, Act»

Worthless Stock Vi
Dual Personality of So Called
Mystic Comes to Light

Poses as Society Man, and Ad
mits Scheme to Dupe
Victims
John F. Neylan
WITH the assertion of Miss
M. C. Ellis, a teacher In the
Grant school, Oakland, that
she has been made the vic
tim of a rnlnlngr stock swindle by J.
Ilobart Deane, "the world's greatest
clairvoyant," who plies his trade at
tl:'e. Adams hotel in the city across the
bay, there has come to licht the strange
story of a man who has trained himself
to. emulate the dual personality of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,. It is a story
t?i?fba-res once again the credulity and
cjiildish simplicity and faith of eager
for wealth. It U a story o*
V::e promotion of dubious mining: stocks
«>y means of the apparently occult and
supernatural, based in reality upon the
pimple apparatus and suave deception
of the charlatan. And it is a story
•which, while confirming: the axiom that
a gullible fool is born every minute,
specifically exposes these facts:
That J. Hobart Deane, clairvoyant In
Oakland, and Jack Coker, society man
tr.d supposed lumber merchant of San
Kranclsco, are one and the same
person.
That In the role of Jack Coker,
Deane has baen Introduced Into local
society by Major George E. Pickett,
paymaster and popular officer at the
Presidio.
That Major Pickett has hitherto be
lieved Deane, In the person of Coker,
to be a secret service agent here on
Important business.
That Deane, by means of clairvoyant
Frances, Induces those of h!s customers
with money to invest In mining- stocks
in which he is interested.
That Deane is paid Jay the promoters
of. these stocks to secure purchasers,
and is paid half of the proceeds as his
commission.
That Deane, by means of a trick
desk. Is enabled to obtain Impressions
of the handwriting of his clients and
can reitd the questions which they have
wrjttcn and supposedly destroyed with
out his having seen them. Finally,
Deane has admitted to me, whom he
supposed to be a man of wealth in
search of Investments, that he Is daily
on the llookoutt t for dupes with money.
Taking me into his confidence, he pro-
posed a. partnership whereby, upon the
> jT-*yment' of $500, I was to become the
sharer of : his spoils -and assist him in
the landing of victims.
Says She Was Duped
So far as the dealings of Miss Ellis
with Deane are concerned, she asserts
tfaat she was cheated out of money
which she paid to Deane for. mining'
dtock, and the clairvoyant himself has
admitted to me that he did sell the min
ing: stock for the men, who now say
that; they know but little about him
and that they agreed to give him half
of what he got. Further than this,- he
has 'admitted to me that he is: laying
plans to induce an Oakland banker to
invest $20,000, half of which is to be
hls.commission and the other half to go
to mining promoters engaged In the
business of peddling worthless stock.
.•Deane, or Coker, has not, only bared
The Inside workings of his own schemes,
but,has ridiculed separately and collec
tively those Individuals who are mak
ing money by Imposing on the credulity
qf simple xnindedTpeople In San Fran
olsco and vicinity, claiming that -the
superiority of his methods gives his
rivals the appearance of three dimes In
a fog. .
Quick witted. a fluent talker, care
ful!^ attired, Deane in talking to me,
who'^he misunderstood for an addi
tional victim, corroborated every state
ment made by the woman who Fays

The law's verdict of guilt, long delayed, has been pronounced
at last against the one time boss of San Francisco.
s''l Abraham Ruef, the' arch dcspoiler of civic decency, stands con
victed after two years of bitter struggle of one of the scores of
crimes that have blackened the record of his public life. His last
criminal resource exhausted, his final effort toward the defeat of
justice spent, Abe Ruef heard yesterday the decision that means
for him long years of penal servitude.
:; : "Guilty as charged!"
The words sounded in a courtroom hushed to a sinister still
ness. Hundreds of ears. caught the ominous words; hundred of. eyes
turned' toward': the table where- huddled the form of .the man in
whose hands once lay enormous power"; yet : in all the throng that
heard and saw there was none to question the right or justice of the
verdict. It was not elation over the ruin of a human life that sent
a thrill of satisfaction to hundreds of hearts; it was a realizaion of
tlie triumph ; of common decency and the vindication of the law.
ONLY HOPE NOW RESTS WITH HIGHER COURT
i Just 24 hours from the time they left the courtroom to consider
the evidence against Abe Ruef the jurors returned once more to the
seats they had occupied during the long weeks of the trial. The
formalities were brief, and on the stroke of 4 o'clock the foreman of
the jury handed to the clerk of the court the paper containing the
irrevocable verdict of Ruef 's guilt. Xo clamor greeted the reading
of the words, for the warning of the court against any form of dem
onstration had been severe, yet so great was the tension that there
were spontaneous cries of "Order, order!" from the bailiffs and
policemen in the room when the formal return of the jury was read.
Before Ruef there lies but a single faint hope. A higher court—
and thie same which once set him free after a confession of guilt
had' passed his own lips— has yet the power to save him from the
disgrace ol a, convict's stripes, but on this hope he can pin scant
faith. Beyond that, the words spoken yesterday marked the ending
of his career. The verdict closed the long battle in which, for two
years, Ruef has fought with every weapon' that unscrupulous power
and unlimited wealth could provide. Rue? alone has stemmed the
tide so long. Others who have joined him in the fight have fallen
before the taint of his association, and as he now goes down it is but
to join those whom he has forced to the depths before him.
MANY ENTANGLED BY RUEF'S WILES
In the* history of Ruefs two years' struggle there swarm the
specters of many blasted lives. There is E. A. S. Blake, convicted of.
bribery in his behalf; there is Frank J. Murphy, once his attorney,
now on trial for offering a bribe to/save his employer; there is A. S.
Newburgh, another attorney, under indictment for the same offense;
there is .Alec Lathan. his former chauffeur, under indictment for
perjury committed in his behalf; there are the Claudianes brothers,
the would be murderers of James L. Gallagher; there is Felix Pau
duveris, dynamiter and fugitive from justice; there is Morris Haas,
whose life was ended by his own hand after his nearly successful
attempt to murder Francis J. Heney. This has been the cost of
Ruef s defense.
• . It \vas rafter hope of a verdict ha<i practically been abandoned
by the thousands of San. Franciscans who -hung upon the closing
scenes-ofthe Ruef trial that the decision. of the jury came. For 24
hours the jurors had remained in consultation, wrangling over the
details of the testimony before them and bound in adeadlock which
it; seemed 'that nothing could break. Then calm reason forced the
issue and brought the scales of justice to a balance. The men -in the
jury, room who had* held out against the giving of 'the verdict of
guilty, were made to see the overwhelming nature of the evidence.
They resolved their last doubts, took their final ballot, and Abe
Ruef stood convicted in the eyes of the law, as he has stood for
months convicted in the eyes of the world.
JURORS UNITE ON THE SIX TH BALLO T
: ; Six^ ballots were taken by the. jury : during the 24 hours that its
members remained locked away by themse.lves. When the first,
ballot was : taken, shortly a f ter the case was submitted Wednesday
afternoon, i eight jurors' voted immediately for ; the conviction of tha
defendant Three others— Harrison, Sullivan and O'Brien— stood
for r an acquittal, and Juror Murphy-; announced himself
