EXPERIENCES IN ESTHONIA
BY MR. AND MRS. BUTTKICK
Feature In Fortnightly Series Was En
joyed By an Appreciative
Audience.
"Experiences in Ksthonla" was the
subject on which Mr. and Mrs. Paul
A. Duttrlck gave a very interesting
talk last evou'ng before the Fortnight
.y Club.
Mrs. Duttrick, who of course needed
no introduction to a Dennington audi
ence told something of tbu geography
of Ksthonla uhowlng on the map which
hung In the front of the chapel Just
the locution of the new country. Then
followed tho rtory of the people, their
hundreds of years of servitude and
finally their freedom which was de
clared four years ago. :
Since that time on account of the
d fferent nationalities of tho people in
such a small country, being pnly about
tMo size of Massachusetts It has been
very dfficult to help them with their
reconstruction work. Almost always
Instruction given on a subject had to
be repeated 'In three different lan
guages to reach all the members of
the class.
Up to the time that Mr. and Mis.
Duttr'ck went tj Ksthonla work had
been done only by the Y. M. ('. A. arid
an appeal was maiie to Amcrlcu for
some leaders to work with the women
and girls and Mrs. Duttrick and one
other young woman , answered Mat
call,, During the year and a half they
were in this country the total enroll
ment of women and girls reached was
3004.
Following Mrs. Uuttrieks talk, a
group of high school girls sang two
Esthonlan -ongs accompanied by Mrs.
Teachout.
Among other things Mr. Duttrick
gave a very intere-.n'ng account of the
exchange of German and Russian pris
oners and of the trip by boat from Stet
tin. Germany, to Norva, a Baltic port
in Russia, passing through the gulf of
Finland which was heavily mined and
on account of which they had to take
ou special pilots.

bor Need Watching De
mands Dry Enforcement
Washington, Dec. 8. President
Harding, addressing Congress In per-
soji today on the state of the nation,
placed tho transportation situation.
prohibition enforcement and fanu
credits In the forefront of the nat'onal
problem preBsfhjj for solution.
Also he took occasion to reply di
roctly to those whom he said had as-
sumed that the United States had
1
taken itself "aloof and apart, unmlnd-;and east are facing fuel famine. .
ful of world oblicatlons". He declared1 Bennington is "better oft than jnost
thesa gave ' scant credit" for the "help-
fnl tuirt" Amprl hurl nsMiimed In in-
ttiraatlonal relations, referring par
ticularly to tho arms conference.
Of the. prohibition situation the ex
ecutive said, there were conditions of
enforcement "which savor of nation
wide scandal." He made no recom
mendations on this score, but announc
ed his purpose to call an early con
ference of the governors of the states
and territories with the federal .ruthor
ities to formulate definite policies of
national and state co-operation in tho
administering of the laws.
Declaring there was no problem ex
ceeding in importance the one of
transportation, Mr. Harding told Con
gress there was need to beg'n on plans
to co-ordinate all transportation rar
ities rail, water and motor.' A to
tho relief of the railroad problem, ho
suggested merger of, lines into sys
tems, a ( facilitated interchange of
freight cars and a consolidation of fa
cll'tles generally.
Turning to the recent railroad strike,
the president proposed that the fed
eral tribunal dealing with disputes be
tween tho carriers and their workers
be given ample authority to enforce
its decisions. Ho voiced a preference
for abortion of the railroad labor
board and the placing ot its functions
under an enlarged Iuterstato Qom.
merce Commission". Should the de
cision be to continue this board in ex
istence, however, ho suggested that
the partisan membership be abolished
to the end that the tribunal ho im
partial and the headquarters moved
from Chicago to Washington so there
might be direct contact with the com
mission. Below are summarized the main
points and recommendations contain
ed in President Harding's message to
Congress:
Recommends substltut'on of a labor
div'elon in the International Commerce
Commission for the Railroad Labor
Board. Merger of railway lines into
systems and an interchange of freight
cars.
Says progress in reconstruction hap
ben hindered by the insistence of
labor on war heights, while the heed
less forces of reaction sought pre-war
levels.
Urges reg'ntratlon of aliens and tho
setting up of boards abroad for the ex
amination of emigrants, so to make

'TIGER" HEARTENED
BY HARDING MESSAGE
Clemeneeau Sees Hope of Co-operation
by America In President's Ad.
dress to Congress.

Clemeneeau, closing his visit to
Washington yesterday afternoon with
a formal address. espressed the hope,
that diplomacy would Und . the way .
to bring America back into European i
affairs through what be interpret4
as an "overture" by President Hard
ing in tho annual message which the
executive had read to Congress'
few hours earlier. :
"I was greatly comforted," said the
wartime premier of Franco, "when 1
read in the message of your President '
the following lines. They are not very
long, but they are very suggestive.
"'The four-power pact, which abol- '
Ishes every probability ot war on tne
Pacific, has brought a new confidence
ln maintained peace, and I can well
believe It might bo made a model tor
like ussurauces wherever in the world
any common Interests are con
cerned.' "
"So you seo," continued tho "Tiger"
"that even those who are supposed to
disagree, really agree tit tho very
bottom of the feeling and reasoning
power. That Is what 1 ask, ond I
hope this Is something like au over
ture, that Heme light will be coming;
and I will bo very glad if it coraw
from America; and I hope that dlplo- '
niary will havo something to say
about it; and talks may he engaged
In w hich. I am sure can bring nothing
hut good for us all."
When Clemeuceau's reference to
iTcsldcnt'a message was Called to the.
attention of the White House, it sv
said that there wos no fommeut to
