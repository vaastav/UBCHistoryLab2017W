The following is a synopsis of the

The president points out the useless
ness of any attempt to secure regula
tion and control of corporations by
state action. Such regulation and su
pervision can only be effectively exer
cised by the national government, and
the president believes proper power
can be secured by enactment of laws
by congress if the Constitution will
not permit: this action, then the Con
stitution should be amended conferring
upon congress full power to enact, ad

"What is needed is not sweeping

the interest, of the public, but. in tin?
interest, of the honest railroad man
and the honest shipper alike, lor it is
they who are chiefly jeopardized bv
the practices ot their dishonest com
petitors."
Labor.
The president devotes considerable
space to the discussion of labor prob
lems. Regarding the demand lor de
priving courts of the power to issue
injunctions in labor disputes, he says:
"Such special limitation of the equity
powers ot our courts would be most
unwise." The president's reniedv is
to regulate the procedure by requiring
the judge to give due notice to the
adverse parties before granting the
writ, the hearing to be ex-pane if the
adverse party does not appear at the
time and place ordered. He renews
recommendations made in his last
message for an investigation by the
department of commerce and labor
of general labor conditions.
Insurance.
"Recent, events have emphasized l'~e
importance of an early and exhaustive
consideration of this question, as to
whether it is not. possible to furnish
better safeguards than the several
states have been able to furnish
against corruption of the flagrant kind
which has been exposed. It has been
only too clearly shown that certain of
the men at the head of these large
corporations take but small note of
the ethical distinction between hon
esty and dishonesty they draw the
line only thin side of what, may be
called law—honesty, the kind of hon
esty necessary to avoid failing into
the clutches of the law. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation ol the vast, insurance
interests ot this country. That slate
supervision has proved inadequate is
generally conceded." The president
concludes this subject by urging con
gress to carefully consider whether
adequate legislation can be had.
The Revenues.
'.'There is more t^eed of stability
than of the attempt ^to attain an ideal
perfection in the-Methods of raising
revenue: and the shock and strain t»
the business world certain to attend
any serious change in these methods
render such change inadvisable un

e^ual the expenditures or else the rev
enues must l:e increased. Last year
there was a deficit.... Unless our ex
penditures can be kept within the rev
enues then our revenue laws must be
readjusted.
The Currency.
The president paints out the need
of the addition of the element of elas
ticity to our currency, so that the cur
rency will contract against specula
tion, and will expand for the needs
of legitimate business.
Reforms in Methods.
Congress is urged to consider the
question of necessary reforms in the
business methods of the various de
partments of the government, so as to
promote the economy, efficiency and
high character of government work.
The president repeats former rec
ommendations for the enactment of a
law directed against bribery and cor
ruption in federal elections. 5U
Hague Conference.
Congress is urged to do all in its
power to further the movement for
another Hague conference and to
make the result of its decisions effec
tive. The president hopes that the
conference may be able to devise
some way to make arbitration between
nations the customary way of settling
international disputes.
Army and Navy.
The importance of providing by ap
propriation provision for maneuvers or
a practical kind to increase the effi
ciency of the army is earnestly
recommended. Increase ^n the coast
artillery force is also recommended.
Of the navy the president says:
"We have most wisely continued for a
number of years to build up our navy,
and it. has now reached a fairly high
standard of efficiency. This standard
of efficiency must not only le main
tained, but increased."
The president does not think it nec
esssary to increase the navy beyond
the present number units, but to'sub
stitute efficient for inefficient units as
the latter become worn out. He thinks
as 1 drew near a canvas which Mr
Whistler was completing.
'That ain't bad,' I said. 'It ain't
bad only here in this corner'—and I
made as if to rub out a cloud effect
with my finger—'I'd do away with that
cloud if I were you.'
"Whistler cried, nervously:
"Gad, sir, be careful, there. Don't
you see the paint is not dry?*
'Oh, that don't matter,'said I've

"After that," adds Mr. Clemens, "we
got on very well together."
7
this result could be attained by add
ing a single battleship to our navy
each year.
There is urgent need of a large in
crease in the number of officers and
enlisted men.
Recent naval history, according to
the president, has emphasized the fact
that, the main strength of the navy
lies?- and can only lie, in the battle
ships. The important part played in
the naval conflict by torpedo boat de
stroyers, submarines, scouts and fast
cruisers is also pointed out.
The importance of revising our sys
tem of naturalizing aliens is strongly
urged, as is also revision ot the crim
inal laws of the United States.
Legislation providing lor suitable
Diinishuient for breaches of trust in
public service is urgently recommend
ed.
Public Land Laws.
The president again calls attention
to the condition of the public land
laws. He says that the iniquitous
methods by. which the monopolizing
of the public lands is being brought
about under the present, laws are be
coming more generally known, but
the existing laws do not furnish effec-

Concluding on this subject, he says:

law or rules are discovered to be un

"During the last year the Philippine
islands have been slowly recovering
from the series of disasters which,
The president earnestly recom
mends that the tariff now imposed by
the Dingley bill upon the the products
of the Philippine islands be entirely
removed, except the tariff on sugar
and tobacco, and that that tariff be re
duced to 25 per cent of the present
rates that after July 1, the tar
ff on sugar and tobacco produced ii,
the Philippine islands be entirely re
moved, and that free trade between
the islands and the United States in
the products of each ceuntry then be
provided for by law.
Admission to Statehood.
The president recommends that In
dian Territory and Oklahoma be ad
mitted as one state and that New Mex
ico and Arizona be admitted as one
state.
The Panama Canal.
"The American people is pledged to
make upon it, and I appeal most ear
nestly to congress to aid in the ful
fillment of the pledge. Gratifying
progress has been made during the
past year, and especially during the
past four months. The greater part
of the necessary preliminary work has
been done. The *ork of sanitation
has been thoroughly accomplished.
"What is needed now and without
delay is an appropriation to meet the
current and accruing expenses of the
commission."
In Conclusien.
In conclusion, the president recom
mends more adequate provision than
has been made heretofore for the work
of the department of state. Neither
at home nor abroad is there a suffi
cient working force to do the business
properly. Improvements in the con
sular service are recommended, in
cluding classification of the force and
readjustment of salaries, which the
president says, are in many cases ut
terly inadequate, considering the im
portance of the service rendered.
