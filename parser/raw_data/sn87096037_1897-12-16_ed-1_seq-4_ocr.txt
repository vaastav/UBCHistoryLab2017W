country of depression after distress and
warfare and of ineffectual settlement to he
followed by renewed revolt. For no endur
ing period since the enfranchisement of the
continental possessions of Spain In the
western continent has the condition of
Cuba or tho policy of Spain toward Cuba
not caused concern to the United States.
The prospect from time to time that the
weakness of Spain's hold upon the Island
and the political vicissitudes and embar
rassments of the home government might
lead to the transfer of Cuba to a contlnen
tal power called forth, between 1823 and
1860. various emphatic declarations of the
policy of the United States to permit no dis
turbance of Cuba's connection with Spain
unless in the direction of Independence or
acquisition by us through purchase: nor
has there been any change of this declared
policy since upon the part of the govern
ment.
The Present Insurrection.
The present insurrection broke out In
February, 1895. It Is not my purpose at this
time to recall Its remarkable increase, or
to characterize its tenacious resistance
against the enormous forces massed
against It by Spain. The revolt and the
efforts to subdue it carried destruction to
every quarter of the island, developing
wide proportions and defying the efforts
or Spain for its suppression. The civilized
codo or war has been disregarded, no less
so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans.
The existing conditions cannot but lill
this government and the American people
with the gravest apprehension. There Is
no desire on the part of our people to
profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We
have only the desire to see the Cubans
prosperous and contented, enjoying that
S?lf control which is the ln-
r,sh.i "an,
protected In their
reaPA e,
benefit of the exhaustless
treasures of their country.
,„'if ?ij=r.made by my predecessor In
riPfll tendering the friendly offices
of this government failed. Any mediation
on our part was not accepted. In brief, the
read: "There is no effectual way
un'ess
it begins with the
actual submission of the rebels to the
mother countrj'." Then only could i-pain
£.«.• 'be premised direction of her own
motion and after her own plans.
Not Clvtllseil Warfare.
jr«eV P°Ucy of concentration was
Initiated February 1G, 189G. The productive
districts controlled by the Spanish armies
were depopulated. The agricultural inhab
itants were herded in and about the gar
VLS0,n .towns» their lands laid waste and
their dwellings destroyed. This policy the
lato cabinet of Spain justified as a neces
sary measure of war and as
a means of cut
ting off suplies from the insurgents. It has
utterly failed as a war measure. It was
not civilized warfare. It was extermina
tion.
1'rotcntn Entered.
Against this abuse of the rights of war
I have felt constrained on repeated occa
sions to enter tho Arm and earnest pro-
l^st
government. There was much
of public condemnation of the treatment of
American citizens by alleged illegal arrests
and long imprisonment awaiting trial or
—proceedings,
de­
pending protracted Judicial
felt it my first duty to malce Instant c.^
mana for the release or speedy trial of all
American citizens under arrest. Before the
change of the Spanish cabinet in October
last 22 prisoners, citizens of tho United
States, had been given their freedom. For
the relief of our own citizens suffering be
cause of the conflict the aid of congress was
sought In a special message, and under
the appropriation of April 4t 1S97, effective
aid has been given to American citizens in
Cuba, many of them at their own request
having been returned to the United States.
Mlntater Woodford'* Iuitrnctloui.
The Instructions given to our new min
ister to Spain before his departure for his
post directed him to Impress upon that gov
ernment the sincere wish or the United
States to lend its aid toward the ending
of the war in Cuba by reaching a peace
ful and lasting result, Just and honorable
alike to Spain and to the Cuban people.
Those instructions recited the character
and duration of the contest, the widespread
losses It entails, the burdens and restraints
It Imposes upon us, with constant dis
turbance of national interests and the In
jury resulting from an indefinite contin
uance of this state of things. It was stated
that at this Juncture our government was
constrained to seriously Inquire if the time
was not ripe when Spain of her own voli
tion, moved by her own interests and every
sentiment of humanity, should put a stop
to this destructive war and make pro
posals of settlement honorable to herself
and Just to her Cuban colony. It was urged
that as a neighboring nation, with large in
terests in Cuba, we could be required to
wait only a reasonable time for the mother
country to establish its authority and re
store order within the borders of the Island
that we could not contemplate an indefi
nite period for the accomplishment of tins
result.
No tlnuililailoii Saffgeited,
No' solution was proposed to which the
slightest Idea of humiliation to Spain
could attach, and Indeed precise proposals
were withheld to avoid embarrassment to
that government. All that was asked
or expected was that some safe way might
be speedily provided and permanent peace
restored. It so chanced that the consider
ation of this offer, addressed to the same
Spanish administration which had declined
the tenders of my predecessor, and which
for more than two years had poured men
and treasure into Cuba in the fruitless ef
fort to suprpess the revolt fell to others.
Between the departure of Gen. Wood
ford, the new envoy, and his arrival in
Spain, the statesman who had shaped tho
policy of his country fell by the hand of an
assassin, and although the cabinet of the
late premier still held office and received
from our envoy the proposals he bore, that
cabinet gave place within a few days there
after to a new administration under the
leadership of Sagasta.

surgents receive from this country The
supposition of an Indefinite prolongation of
the war is denied. It is asserted that the
western provinces are already well-nigh re
claimed: that the planting of cane and to
pacco therein has been resumed, and that
by force of arms and new and ample re
forms very early and complete pacification
is hoped for.
Have Kul Failed In Our Duty.
The immediate amelioration of exlsttns
conditions under the new administration
of Cuban affairs Is predicted, and therewith
all the disturbance and all occasion for
any change of attitude on tho part of the
United States. Discussion of the question
of the International duties and responsibil
ities of the United States, as Spain under
stands them, ls presented, with an appar
ent disposition to charge us with failure In
this regard. This charge Is without any
basis in fact. It could not have been made
if Spain had been cognizant of the con
stant efforts this government has made, at
the cost of millions and by the employment
of the administrative machinery of the na
tion. That it has successfully prevented
the departure of a single military expe
dition or armed vessel from our shores In
violation of our laws would seem to be a
sufficient answer. But of this aspect of
the Spanish note It ls not necessary to
speak further now. Firm In the conviction
of a wholly performed obligation, duo re
sponse to this charge has been made In dip
lomatic course.
Tlie Untrleal Measures.
Of the untried measures there remain
only: Recognition of the insurgents as
belfiqerents: recognition of the Independ
ence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end
the war by imposing a rational compromise
between the contestants, and Intervention
In favor of one or the other party. I speak
not of forcible annexation, for that can
not be thought of. That by our cotlc of
morality would be criminal aggression.
Itecounltlun of Insurgents.

Cuban insurgents has often been can

insurrection possesses beyond dispute the

At that Juncture Grant uttered these
words, which now as then sum up the ele
ments of the problem: **A recognition of
the Independence of Cuba being, in my
opinion, impracticable and indefensible, the
which
Pex* presents itself is
that of the recognition of belligerent rights
in the parties to the contest. In a former
message to congress I had occasion to con
der this question, and reached the con
clusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadrul
and devastating as were its incidents, did
a a
It is possible that the acts of foreign
powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of
this very nature might be pointed to in de
fense of such recognition. But now. as in
Its past history, the United States should
carefully avoid the falBe lights which might
lead it Into the mazes of doubtful law and
of questionable propriety and adhere rlg
dly and sternly to the rule which has been
its guide of doing only that which Is
right and honest and of good report. The
question of according or of withholding
rights of belligerency must be judged in
every case, in view of the particular at
tending facts. Unless justified by necessity
it is always and justly regarded as an un
friendly act and a gratuitous demonstra
tion of moral support to the rebellion. It
Is necessary, and it is required, when the
Interests and rights of another government
or of its people are so far affected by a
pending civil conflict as to require a
definition of its relations to the parties
thereto. But this conflict must be one
which is recognized In the sense of in
ternational law as war.
Recognition Not Justltted.
"Belligerence, too, ls a faot. The mere
existence of contending armed bodies and
their occasional conflicts do not constitute
war In the sense referred to. Applying to
the existing condition of affairs in Cuba
the tests recognized by publicists and writ
ers on International law, and which have
been observed by nations of dignity, hon
esty and power, when free from sensitive or
selfish and unworthy motives, I fall to
find In tho Insurrection the existence of
such a substantial political organization,
real, palpable and manifest to tnc
world, having the forms and capable of
the ordinary functions of government
toward Its own people and to other states,
with courts for the administration of jus
tice. with a local habitation, possessing
such organization of force, such material,
such occupation of territory as to take tlie
contest out of the category of a mere re
bellious insurrection or occasional skir
mishes, and place It on tho terrible foot
ing of war, to which a recognition ot bel
ligerency would aim to elevate It.
The contest, moreover, Is solely on
land: tho insurrection has not possessed
itself of a single seaport whence It may
send forth Its nag, nor has It any means of
communication with foreign powers ex
cept through the military lines of its ad
versaries. No apprehension of any of
those sudden and difficult complications
which war upon the ocean Is apt to pre
cipitate upon the vessels, both commercial
and national, and upon consular officers of
other powers, calls for the definition of
their relations to the parties to the contest.
Considered as a question of expediency, 1
regard the accordance of belligerent rights
still to be as unwise and premature, as I re
gard It to be, at present, Indefensible as a
measure of right.
"Such recognition entails upon the coun
try according the rights which flow from it
difficult and complicated duties, and re
quires the exaction from the contending
parties of the strict observance of their
rights and obligations. It confers the right
of search upon the high seas by vessels of
both parties It would subject the carrying
of arms and munitions of war, which now
may be transported freely and without in
terruption, in vessels of the United States
to detention and to possible seizure: It
would give rise to countless vexatious ques
tions, would release the parent government
from responsibility for acts done by the in
surgents, and would Invest Spain with the
right to exercise the supervision recognized
by our treaty of 1796 over our commerce on
the seas, a very large part of which, in its
traffic between the Atlantic and the gulf
stateB and between all of them and the
states on the Pacific, passes through the
waters which wash the shores of Cuba.
The exercise of this supervision could
scarce fall to lead, If not to abuses, cer
tainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful
.relations of the two states. There can be
little doubt as to what result such super
vision would before long draw this nation.
It would be unworthy of the United States
to Inaugurate the possibilities of such re
sult, by measures of questionable right or
expediency, or by any Indirection."
What Itvcounltlon Would Mean.
Turning to the practical aspects of a rec
ognition of belligerency and reviewing Its
Inconveniences and positive dangers, still
further pertinent considerations appear.
In the code of nations there is no such thing
us a naked recognition of belligerency un
accompanied by the assumption of Interna
tional neutrality. Such recognition will
not confer upon either party to a domestic
conflict a status not heretofore actually
possessed or effect the relation of either
parly to other states. The act of recogni
tion usually takes the form of a solemn
proclamation of neutrality which recites
the dc facto condition of belligerency as
Its motive. It announces a domestic law
of neutrality In declaring state. It assumes
the International obligations of a neutral
In the presence of a public state of war. It
warns all citizens and others within the
jurlslfction of the proclaimant that th«-v
violate those righteous obligations at thf-ir
own peril and cannot expect to be shielded
from the consequences. The right of visit
and search on the seas and seizure of ves
sels and cargoes and contraband of war
and good prize under admiralty law must
under International law be admitted as a
legitimate consequence of a proclamation
of belligerency, while according the equal
belligerent rights defined by public law to
each party In our ports disfavors would he
imposed on both, which while nominally
equal would weigh heavily In behalf of
Spain herself. Possessing a navy and con
trolling the ports of Cuba her maritime
rights could be asserted not only for tho
military Investment of the Island but up to
the margin of our own territorial waters,
and a condition of things would exist for
which tho Cubans within their own domain
could not hope to create a parallel while
Its creation through aid or sympathy from
within our domain would be even more Im
possible than now, with the additional ob
ligations of international neutrality we
would perforce assume.
Resarded, at Present, as I'nwlse.
The enforcement of this enlarged and on
erous code of neutrality would only be
Influential within our own jurisdiction by
land and sea, and applicable by our own
Instrumentalities. It could Impart to the
United States no Jurisdiction between
Spain and the Insurgents. It would give the
United States no right of Intervention to
enforce the conduct of the strife within
the paramount authority of Spain accord
ing to the International code of war. For
these reasons I regard the recognition of
the belligerency of the Cuban Insurgents
as now unwise, and therefore Inadmlssable.
Should that step hereafter be deemed wise
as a measure of right and duty, the execu
tive will take It.
Intervention.
Intervention upon humanitarian grounds
has been frequently suggested, and has not
failed to receive my most anxious and
earnest consideration. But should such a
step be now taken, when it is apparent
that a hopeful change has supervened in
the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new
government has taken office In the mother
country. It Is pledged in advance to the
declaration that all the efforts of the world
cannot suffice to maintain peace in Cuba
by the bayonet that vague promises of re
form after subjugation afford no solution
of tho Insular problem: that with a sub
stitution of commanders must come a
change of the past system of warfare for
one in harmony with a new uolicv which
shall no longer aim to drive the Cubans tu
the "horrible alternative of taking to the
thicket or succumbing In'misery that re
forms must be instituted In accordance
with the needs and circumstances of tho
time, and that these reforms, while de
signed to give full autonomy to the rolony
*nd to create a virtual entity and self-con
trolled administration, shall yet conserve
and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by a
JUBt distribution of powers and burdens
upon a bnsls of mutual Interest, unt«liui1
by mtthodn of selfliti vxptdlency.
Lies In Honorable Paths.
The first acts of the new government lie
In these honorable paths. The policy of
cruel rapine and extermination that so
long shocked the universal sentiment of
humanity lias been reversed. Under the
new milltaTy commander a broad clemency
Is proffered. Measures have already been
set on foot to relieve the horrors of starva
tion. The power of the Spanish armies. It
is assorted, is to be used not to spread ruin
and desolation, but to protect the resump
tion of peaceful agricultural pursuits and
productive Industries. That past methods
are futile to force a peaco by subjugation is
freely admitted, and that ruin without con
ciliation must Inevitably fail to win for
Spain the "fidelity of a contented depend
ency. Decrees In application of the fore
shadowed reforms have already been pro
mulgated.
Should Give Spain a Cliance.
That the government of Sagasta has en
tered upon a course from which recession
with honor Is impossible can hardly be
questioned that In the few weeks It has
existed it has made earnest of the sincerity
of Its professions la undeniable. I shall not
Impugn its sincerity, nor should Impatience
be suffered to embarrass It In the task it
has undertaken. It is honestly due Spain
and to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations, and to
prove the asserted efficacy of the new or
der of things to which she stands Irre
vocably committed. She has recalled the
commander whose brutal orders inflamed
the American mind and shocked the civ
ilized world. She has modified the horrible
order of concentration, and has undertaken

AVIU Not Hesitate to Act.
Not a single American citizen Is now in
arrest or confinement in Cuba of whom
this government has any knowledge. The
ne", future will demonstrate whether
tho indispensable condition of a righteous
peace, just alike to the Cubans and to
Spain, as well as equitable tij all our in
terests so intimately involved In tlie wel
fare of Cuba, is likely to be attained.
If not, the exigency of further and other
action by the United States will remain
to bo taken. When that time comes that
action will be determined In the line of
indisputable right and duty. It will be
faced without misgiving or hesitancy In the
light of the obligation this government
owes to itself, to the people who have con
llded to it the protection of their interests
and honor and to humanity. Sure of the
right, keeping free from all offense our
selves, actuated only by upright and patri
otic considerations, moved neither by pas
sion nor selllshness, the government will
continue its watchful caro over the rights
and property of American citizens and will
abate nono of Its efforts to bring about by
peaceful agencies a peace which shall be
honorable and enduring. If it shall here
after appear to be a duty imposed by our
obligations to ourselves, to civilization and
humanity to Intervene with force, it shall
be without fault on our part and only be
cause the necessity for such action will be
so clear as to command the support and
approval of the civilized world.
ANNEXATION OF HAWAII.
UlKulty Mini Honor Require UonHrm
ntlon of the Treaty.
By a special message dated the lGth day
of June last, I laid before the senate a
treaty signed that day by the plenipo
taries of the United States and of the re
I'Ublic of Hawaii having for its purpose the
incorporation of the Hawaiian islands as
nn Integral part of the United States and
under Its sovereignty. The senate having
removed tho injunction of secrecy, although
the treaty Is still pending before that body,
the subject may bo properly referred to In
this message bccause the necessary action
of the congress is required to determine by
legislation many details of the eventual
union should the fact of annexation be ac
complished, as I believe It shoud be.
While consistently disavowing from a.
very early period any aggressive policy of
absorption In regard to the Hawaiian
group, a long series of declarations through
three-quarters of a century has proclaimed
the vital Interest of the United StateB in the
Independent life of the islands and their
Intimate commercial dependence upon this
country. At tho same time it has been re
peatedly asserted that in no event could the
entity of Hawaiian statehood cease by the
passage of tho islands under the domina
tion or influence of another power than the
United States. Under these circumstances
the logic of events required that annexa
tion, heretofore offered but declined, should
in the ripeness .of time come about as the
jiatural result of tho strengthening ties
that bind us to those islands, and be real
ized by the free will of tho Haw I lan state.
That treaty was unanimously ratified
without amendment by the senate and pres
ident of the republic of Hawaii on the 10th
of September last, and only awaits the fa
vorable action of the American senate to
effect the complete absorption of the
Islands Into the domain of the United States.
What the conditions of such a union shall
be, the political relation thereof to the
United States, the character of the local
administration, the quulity and degree of
the elective franchise of the Inhabitants,
the extension of the federal laws to the
territory or the enactment of special laws
to fit the peculiar condition thereof, the reg
ulation if need be of the labor system
therein, are all matters which the treaty
has wisely relegated to the congress.
Should Be Confirmed.
If the treaty Is confirmed, as every con
sideration of dignity and honor requires,
the wisdom of congress will see to It that,
avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements
perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the
highest franchises of citizenship, and hav
ing due regard to the geographical condi
tions, the most Just provisions for self-rule
In local matters with the largest political
liberties as an Integral part of our nation,
will be accorded to the Hawallans. No
less ls due to a people who, after nearly
Ave years of demonstrated capacity to ful
fill the obligations of self-governing state
hood, come of their own free will to merge
their destinies in our body politic.

action for what I regarded as tho para

developed upon an Investigation by the
secretary of state that the government
of Nicaragua..while not unwflllng to re

was unable to do so because of the coin
pact concluded Juno 20,1S95, whereby that
republic and those of Salvador and Hon

greater republic of Central America, had
surrendered to the representative diet there
their right to reveive and send diplomatic
agents, a he diet was not willing to ac
cept him because ho was not accredited to
'hat body. I could not accredit him to
that body because the appropriation law
of congress did not permit It. Mr. Baker,
the present minister at Managua, has been
directed to present his letters of recall.
The NIcnrnKunn Canal.
A subject of large Importance to our
country and Increasing appreciation on the
part of the people Is the completion of the
great highway of trade between the At
lantic and Pacific known as the Nica
raguan canal. Its utility and value to
American commerce is universally admit
ted. The commission appointed under
date of July 24 last
Mtocontinue
the'surveys
and examinations authorized by the act
approved March 2, 1895." in regard to "the
proper route, feasibility and cost of con
struction of the Nicaragua canal, with a
view of making complete plans for the en
tire work of construction of such canal,"
is now employed In the undertaking. In tho
future 1 shall take occasion to transmit to
congress the report of this commission,
making at the same time such further sug
gestions as may then seem advisable.
MONETARY COMMISSION.
I nnblc to Securc Satisfactory Re
sults from Its Labors.
Under the provisions of the act of con
gress approved March S, 1897, for the pro
motion of an international agreement re
specting bimetallism, I appointed on the
14th day of April, 1897, lion. Udward O.
Wolcott, of Colorado Hon. Adlal E.
Stevenson, of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J.
l'aiiie, of Massachusetts, as special en
voys to represent the United States. They
have been diligent In their efforts to se
cure tlie cooperation ot European countries
In the International settlement of theques
tlon, but up to this time have not been
able to secure an agreement contemplated
by their mission. The gratifying action of
our great sister republic of France in Join
ing This country In the attempt to bring
about an agreement among the principal
lixed and relative value between gold and
diver shall bo secured, furnished assur
ance that we are not alone among the
larger nutlons of the world in realizing
the International character of the prob
lem and In the desire of reaching some
wise and practical solution of it.
The British government has published a
resume of the steps taken Jointly by the
French ambassador in London and the
special envoys of the United States, with
whom our ambassador at London active
ly cooperated in the presentation of this
subject t(i Iter majesty a fovtrnmsnt. Tata
will be laid before congress. Our special
envoys have not made their final report, as
further negotlatons between the repre
sentatives of this government and the gov
ernments' of other countries are pending
and in contemplation. They believe that
doubts which have been raised in certain
quarters respecting the position of main
taining the stability of the parity between
the metals and kindred questions may yet
be solved by further negotiations.
RECIPROCITY.
Step. Taken to Improve Trade Relations
With Other Conntrlea.
In order to execute as early as possible
the provisions of the third and fourth sec
ii L?'."1' revenue act approved July
24, 1897, I appointed Hon. John A. Kas
son, of Iowa, a special commissioner plenl
potentiary to undertake the requisite nego
tlations with foreign countries desiring to
avail themselves of these provisions. The
negotiations are now proceeding with sev
eral governments, both European and
American. It ls believed that by a careful
exercise of the powers conferred by that
act some grievances of our own and of
other countries in our mutual trade rela
tions may be cither removed or largely
alleviated, and that the volume of our com
mercial exchanges may be enlarged, with
advantage to both contracting parties.
THE SEALS.
Progreu or Negotiation Looking to Their
Better Protection.
Tho efforts which had been made during
le two previous years by
to securo better protection
the two previous years by my predecessor
to securo better protection to the fur seuls
In the Northern Pacific ocean and Behring
sea, were renewed at an early date by
tills administration and have been pursued
with earnestness. Upon my invitation the
governments of Japan and Russia sent
delegates to Washington and an inter
national conference was held during the
months of October and November last,
wherein it was unanimously agreed that
under the existing regulations tills species
of useful animals was threatened with ex
tinction and that an international agree
ment of all the Interested powers was
necessary for their adequate protection.
The government of Great Britain did not
see proper to be represented at this con
ference, but subsequently sent to Washing
ton, as delegates, the expert commission
ers of Great Britain and Canada who had
during the past two years visited the
Pribylof Islands, and who met In confer
ence similar commissioners on the part of
the United States. The result of this con
ference was an agreement on Important
facts connected with the condition of the
seal herd, heretofore In dispute, which
should place beyond controversy the duty
of the governments concerned to adopt
measures without delay for the preserva
tion and restoration of the herd. Negoti
ations to this end are now In progress the
result of which I hope to be able to report
to congress at an early day.
INTERNATIONAL, ARBITRATION.
The Subjcct Demands Due Considera
tion by Congress.
International arbitration cannot be omit
ted from the list of subjects claiming our
consideration, lilvents have only served to
strengthen the general views on this ques
tion expressed in my inaugural address.
The best sentiment of the civilized world
ls moving toward the settlement of dif
ferences Detween nations without resort
ing to the horrors of war. Treaties em
bodying these humane principles on broad
lines without in any way imperiling our
interests or our honor shull have my con
stant encouragement.
Olin NAYV.
Present Condition Well Adapted to
Our Necessities.
The present Immediately effectiveness of
the navy consists of four battle ships of the
first class, two of the second and 48 other
vessels, ranging from armored cruisers to
torpedo boats. There are under construc
tion live battle ships of the first class, 16
torpedo boats and one submarine boat. No
provision has yet been made for the armor
of threo of tho live battle ships, as it has
I'een impossible to obtain it at the price
fixed by congress. It is of great importance
that congress provide this armor, as until
then the ships are of no fighting value.
The present naval force, especially in view
of its increase by the ships now under con
struction, while not as large as that of a
few other powers, is a formidable force
its vessels are the very best of each type
and with the Increase that should be made
to It from time to time in the future, and
careful attention to keeping it in a high
state of efficiency and repair, It is well
adapted to the necessities of the country.
I he great increase of the navy which has
taken place In recent years was justified by
the requirements for national defense and
has received public approbation. The time
has now arrived, however, when this in
crease, to which the country ls'committed
should, for a time, take the form of in
creased facilities commensurate with the
Increase of our naval vessels. It ls an un
fortunate fact that there ls only one dock
on the Pacific coast capable of docking our
largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic
coast, and that the latter has for the last
six or seven months been under repair and
therefore incapable of use. Immediate
steps should be taken to provide three o
four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic
coast, at least one on the Pacific coast and
a floating dock on the gulf. This is the
recommendation of a very competent
board, appointed to investigate the sub
ject. There should also be ample provision
made for powder and projectiles, and other
munitions of war and for an Increased
nY5?£er
of
ALASKA.
Material Changes in Territorial Laws
Are Necessary.
The territory of Alaska requires the
prompt and early attention of congress.
The conditions now existing demand mate
rial changes in the laws relating to the
territory. The great influx of population
during the past summer and fall and the
prospect of a still larger immigration in
the spring will not permit us to longer
neglect the extension of civil authority
within the territory or postpone the es
tablishment of a more thorough govern
ment. A general system of public sur
veys has not been extended to Alaska and
all entries thus far made In that district are
upon special surveys. The act of congress
extending to Alaska the mining laws of
the United States contained the reserva
tion that it shouldnot be construed to put In
force the general land laws of the country.
By act approved March S, 1891, authority
was given for entry of lands for town
site purposes and also for the purchase of
not exceeding 100 acres then or thereafter
occupied for purposes of trade and manu
facture. The purpose of congress as thus
far expressed has been that only such
rights should apply to that territory as
should be speciticallly named.
As it is to the interest of the govern
ment to encourage the settlement of the
country and its duty to follow up its citi
zens with the benefit of legal machinery,
1 earnestly urge upon congress the estab
lishment of a system of government with
™ch flexibility as will enable It to adjust
Itself to tho future areas of greatest dod
ulatlon.

auditions are also necessary to our navy
yards for the repair and care of our larger
number of vessels. As there are now on
the stocks five battleships of the largest
class, which can not be completed for a
year or two, I concur with the recommen
dation of the secretary of the navy for an
appropriation authorizing the construction
of one battleship for the Pacific coast,

on the Atlantic coast there are three in

attention of congress. Access to that
country in winter can be had only by the

a most difficult and perhaps an impossible
task. However, should these reports of the
suffering of our fellow-cltlzens be further
verified, every effort at any cost should be
made to carry them relief.
TI1E2 INDIANS.
Needs of White Residents In the Ter
ritory Must Be Considered.
For a number of years past it has been
apparent that the conditions under which
thei live civilized tribes were established
in the Indian territory under treaty nro
vlslons with the United States, with the
right of self-government and the ex
cluBlon of all white persons from within
their borders, have undergone so complete
a. change as to render the continuance of
I'fp^Jh"/ tgll'li^r SftM'e
ls^i,494? an^t"li^ifum*er^B^nof material
ly increased, while the white population is
estimated at from 200,000 to 260,000, which
by permission of the Indian government,
has settled in the territory. The present
area of the Indian territory contains 26.
694,664 acres, much of which ls very fer
"Af, The United States citizens re
siding In the territory, most of whom have
gone there by Invitation or with the con
sent of the tribal authorities, have made
permanent homes for themselves. Numer
have been built in which from
BOO to 6.M0 white people now reside. Valu
able residences and business houses have
been erected in many of them. Large busl
mm snterprtots are carried on in
which vasC sums of money aro era
wwrad, and yit thess people, who
nave Invested tbclr capital in the /*v«lop-
:-t*..^
ment of the productive resources of the
country, are without title to the land they
occupy and have no voice whatever In the
government either of the nations or tribes.
Thousands of their children who were born
in the territory are of Bchool age, but the
doors of the schools of the nation's are shut
against them and what education they get
is by private contribution. No provision
for the protection of the life or property
of these white citizens ls made by the
tribal governments and courts.
An Indian Aristocracy.
The secretary of the Interior reports that
leading Indians have absorbed great tracts
of land to the exclusion of the common peo
ple and government by an Indian aristoc
racy has been practically established, to
the detriment of the people. It has been
found Impossible for the United States to
keep its citizens out of the territory and
the executory conditions contained In
treaties with these nations have for the
most part become impossible of execution.
Nor has It been possible for the tribal gov
ernments to secure to each Individual
Indian his full enjoyment in common with
other Indians of the common property of
the nations. Friends of the Indians have
long believed that the best interests of the
Indians of the five civilized tribes would
be found in American citizenship, with all
the rights and privileges which belong to
that condition.
The Dawes Commission.
By section 16 of the act of March 3,1893,
the president was authorized to appoint
three commissioners to enter Into negotia
tions with the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chicka
saw, Muskogee (or Creek) and Seminole na
tions. commonly known as the Five Civ
ilized Tribes in the Indian territory. Brief
ly, the purposes of the negotiations were
to be The extinguishment of tribal titles
to any lands within that territory, now
held by any and all sucti nations or
tribes, either by cession of the same or
some part thereof to the United States or
by allotment and division of the same in
severalty among the Indians of such na
tions or tribes respectively as may be en
titled to the same, or by such other method
as may be agreed upon between the sev
eral nations and tribes aforesaid, or each
of them with the United States, with
view to such an adjustment upon the basis
of justice and equity as may. with the con
sent of the said nations of Indians, so far
as may be necessary, be requisite and suit
able to enable the ultimate creation of
a state or states of the union, which shall
embrace the lands within said Indian ter
ritory.
The commission met much opposition
from the beginning. The Indians were
very slow to act, and those in control mani
fested a decided disinclination to meet
with favor the propositions submitted to
them. A little more than three years after
this organization the commission effected
an agreement with the Choctaw nation
alone. The Chlckasaws, however, refused
to agree to Its terms, and as they have
a common interest with the Choctaws in
the lands of said nations, the agreement
with the latter nation could have no ef
fect without the consent of tho former.
On April 23, 1S!7, tlie commission effected
an agreement with both tribes—the Choc
taws and Chickasaws. This agreement.
It Is understood, has been ratified by the
constituted authorities of the respective
tribes or nations parties thereto, and only
requires ratification by congress to moke
It binding. On the 27th of September, 1S97,
an agreement was effected with the Creek
nation, but It ls understood that the na
tional council of said nation has refused
to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet
to be had with the Cherokees, the most
populous of the Five Civilized tribes, and
with the Semlnoles, the smallest In point
of numbers and territory.
I concur with the secretary of tne interior
that there can be no cure for the eviis en-
frusts
endered by the perversion of these groat
excepting by their resumption by
the government which created them.
THE PACIFIC RAILWAYS.
Should Uovcrument Uccomc Uldder
for the Kansas Pncllic?
The Union Pacific railway, main line,
was sold under the decree of the United
States court for the district of Nebraska
on the 1st and 2d of November of this year.
The amount due the government consisted
of the principal of the subsidy bonds, J27,
236,612, and the accrued interest thereon,
$31,211,711.7s, making the total indebtedness
S5S,448,223.75. The bid at thfe sale covered
the first mortgage lien and the entire mort
gage claim of the government, principal
and interest.
The sale of the subsidized portion of tlia
Kansas Pacific line, upon which the gov
ernment holds a second mortgage lien,
has been postponed at the instance of the
government to December 16,1897 The debt
of this division of tlie Union Pacific railway
to the government on November 1, 1897,
was the principal of the subsidy bonds,
$6,303,000, and the unpaid and accrued In
terest thereon, $6,626,000.33, making a total
of $12,929,000.33. The sale of this road was
originally advertised for November 4, but
for the purpose of securing the utmost
public notice of the event it was postponed
until December 16 and a second adver
tisement of the sale was made. By the
decree of the court the upset price on tho
sale of the Kansas Pacific will yield to
the government the sum of $2,500,000 over
all prior liens, costs and charges. If no
other or better bid Is made this sum Is
all that the government will receive on its
claim of nearly $13,000,000. The government
has no Information as to whether there
will be other bidders or a better bid than
the minimum amount herein stated. The
question presented therefore Is whether
the government shall under the authority
given it by the act of March 3,1887, purchase
"J,, ^d®e"Llhe r°ad ill the event that a
.bid Is not made by private parties covering
the entire government claim.
To qualify the government to bid at the
sales will require a deposit of $900,1100, as
rollows. In the government cause $500,000.
in each of tne first mortgage oauses
$200,000, and in the latter the deposit must
}e,'n ca?h.
Payment at the sale ls as
rollous. Upon the acceptance of the bid.
a sum which with the amount already
depos ted shall equal 15 per cent, of the
tlie Jbala.nce In Installments of 25 per
cent., 30 40 and 60 days after the contlrma
tlon of the sale. The lien on the Kansas
Pacific prior to that of the government
on the 30th of July. 1897, principal and Inter
est amounted to $7,281,048.11. The govern
ment, therefore, should It become the high
est bidder, will have to pay the amount of
the first mortgage lien. I believe that under
the act of 18S7 It has the authority to do
this, and In absence of any action by con
gress, I shall direct the secretary of the
treasury to make the necessary deposit as
required by the court's decree to qualify
as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum
which will at least equal the principal of
the debt due the government but suggest,
in order to remove all controversy, that an
amendment of the law be Immediately
passed explicitly giving such powers and
appropriating In general terms whatever
sum Is sufficient therefor.
In so Important a matter as the gov
ernment becoming the possible owner of
railroad property which It perforce must
conduct and operate, I feel constrained to
lay before congress those facts for Its
consideration and action before the con
summation of the sale. It ls clear to my
mind that the government should not per
mit the property to bemold at a price which
will yield less than one-half of the prin
cipal of its debt, and less than one-fifth of
its entire debt, principal and Interest.
But whether the government, rather than
accept less than Its claim," should become a
bidden and thereby the owner of the prop
erty, I submit to the congress for action.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Distinct Advancc Made In Operation
ot the Law.
The Important branch of our government
known as the civil service, the practical
Improvement of which has long been a sub
ject of earnest discussion, has of late years
received increased legislative and execu
tive approval. During the past few
months the service has been placed upon
a still firmer basis of business methods
and personal merit. While tho right of our
veteran soldiers to reinstatement in de
serving cases has been asserted, dismissals
for merely political reasons have been
carefully guarded against, the examina
tions for admittance to the service en
larged and at the same time rendered less
technical and more practical and a dis
tinct advance has been made by giving a
hearing before dismissal upon all cases
where Incompetency Is charged or demand
made for the removal of officials In any of
the departments. This order has been made
to give to the accused his right to be heard,
but without in any way impairing the
power of removal, which should always be
exorcised In cases of inefficiency and In
competency, and which Is one of the vital
safeguards of the civil service reform sys
tem, preventing stagnation and deadwood
I and keeping every employe keenly alive
to the fact that the security of his tenure
depends not on favor, but on his own test
ed and carefully watched record of service.
tiOVERNMEKT EXPENSES.
Appropriations Must Dc Kept Wlthlo
the Receipts.
I am forced by the length of this message
to omit many important references to
affairs of the government with which con
gress will have to deal at the present ses
sion. They are fully discussed in the de
partmental reports, to all of which 1 Invite
your earnest attention. Tho estimates of
the expenses of the government by the
several departments will, 1 am sure, have
your careful scrutiny. While the con
gress may not find it an easy task to reduce
the expenses of the government. It should
not encourage their Increase. These ex
penses will, In my judgment, admit of a
penses nm, in/ juuKiiiuiii, uunm ot a
decrease In many branches of the govern
ment without injury to the public service.
It Is a commanding duty to keep the ao
propriatlons within the receipts of the gov
crpment and thus avoid a deficit.

ECKELS' REPORT MADE.
Interesting Information Concern*
in? National Banks.
Comptroller of the Currency Tells of
the Growth of the System, and
Argrnes at Length in Favor of
Dank Note Circulation.
Washington, Dec. 6.—The annual report
of James H. Eckels, comptroller of the
currency, for the year ended October 31.
1897, opens with a brief review of the his
tory of the legislation which constitutes
the present national bank act and Invites
the attention of congress to amendments
to the law recommended In former reports
without specifically repeating them.
On the subject of bank note circulation
the comptroller says: "It ls noticeable that
In all the changes which have been wrought
in the national currency act from Its Incep
tion to the present time the feature subject
to criticism, but which was intended should
constitute the principal benefit to be con
ferred, has remained comparatlvelj' un
changed, namely, the note-issuing func
tion. Whatever justification there was in
the first instance for restricting the Issu
ing of notes against the bonds of the gov
eminent, deposited with the treasurer of
the United States to 90 per cent, of the
par value thereof, long since ceased. In
the report of every comptroller of the cur
rency during the past 20 years the wisdom
of changing the existing law so that the
banks, and through them the communi
ties in which located, might have the ad
ditional benefit of an added loanable capi
tal has been .urged. Despite all this the
law still remains without amendment. Not
only should the bank act be amended in
this particular, but congr-ss should se
riously consider such a change in the meth
od of bank note issues as will enable tho
banks of the country to more adequately
meet the demands of trade and commerce
In all sections of the country. Tlie busi
ness of banking, like every other form of
Investment, must be made attractive to
capital. If It is placed upon a footing
different from other undertakings, embar
rassed through unnecessary restrictions
and deprived of proper sources of -oHt,
the result cannot be otherwise '.han that
lnvestable capital will seek other means of
employment, and to such an extent deprive
the people of tho benefits of the agency
most requisite to commercial activity.
"It is considered by every great commer
cial government except tlie United States
to bo the sole province of banks to issue
the paper wiiich circulates as currency.
The belief in a bank note currency as being
better and safer than a government paper
currency prevailed unquestioned In this
country until, under tho apparent exi
gencies of the war, the government under
took to issue paper currency. Even .der
such circumstances tlie promise was al
ways given, however, that It should be re
tired at tho earliest practicable moment
and the admission freely made that It was
neither a wise measure nor a safe form of
currency. Between the competition of tlie
government note issues on tho me hand
and the unnecessary restrictions imposed
by law upon the other, together with the
increasing price of bonds required to be
deposited as security, the note-issuing
function of the banks has been permitted
to become merely an incident to tho con
duct of the national banking associations
of the country.
"It has been seriously suggested more
than once that the bank note issues be done
away with and all paper be issued by the
government instead. The danger of such
a course Is not to be overestimated, a lie
experience of every government has been
that governmental currency paper is a
source of weakness and danger. In the
United States, where there has been the
nearest approach to success, with tho vol
ume of the federal paper comparatively
limited In amount, tho credit of the gov
ernment has been more than once put In
jeopardy through it and tho business In
terests of the country subjected to unnec
essary loss and confusion.
"The argument that the government, bet
ter than the banks, can provide for the re
demption of paper note issues will .not
stand the test of a careful analysis. The
government has no means for caring for
Its demand liabilities exccpt through bor
rowing and through the levying of taxes.
Upon the other hand, the banks have assets
which can be promptly converted into cash
to meet their outstanding notes when pre
sented. Their ability to command gold has
always been beyond that ,of the govern
ment, for in each financial exigency which
has confronted the government the banks
have furnished to It the amounts neces
sary to maintain its solvency. It Is im
possible to believe that with a system of
bank note issues based in part upon se-4
curities and in part upon bank assets thel
country cannot be provided with a sound,
safe and elastic bank note issue, always
commensurate with and responsive to tlie
demands of trade.
The total number of national banks or
ganized since the system was put into op
eration in 1863 is shown to have been 5.095.
On October 31 last there were In active op
eration 3,617, having an authorized capital
of $030,230,295. Tho total outstanding cir
culation of the banks then in operation was
S22H.199.SS0. of which $202,994,555 was secured
by bonds of the United Slates and the bal
ance by lawful money deposited with the
treasurer of the United States. The total
circulation outstanding of all national
banks on October 31 last was $230,131
.WIS. of
which amount $1,558,800 was secured by
bonds held for account of Insolvent and
liquidating hanks and $26,205,325 by lawful
money deposited for their account and by
active banks reducing circulation. The net
decrease in the amount of circulation se
cured by bonds during the year was $12,
684,334 and the gross decrease in the total
circulation was $4,851,292. During the year
44 banks were organized with an aggre
gate capital stock of $6,420,000. During the
year 71 banks went into voluntary liquida
tion. There was paid to creditors of In
solvent banks during the year $13,169,781 in
dividends.
"The magnitude of this unequaled rec
ord," tne report says, "will more forci
bly illustrated if considered In the light of
what has been accomplished heretofore in
the way of dividend payments to the cred
itors of Insolvent institutions. In 1893 there
was paid in dividends $3,4i3,U46 ii, t6s,4, *.
124,577. in 1S95, J3.3S0.552 In 1890, $2,451,959, and
in 1897, $13,169,781, making a total of divi
dends paid within the five years from 1893
to 1897 of $27,560,515, or 36Vi per cent, of all
the dividends that have ever been paid to
creditors of insolvent national banks
From 1&63 to 1697 there has been paid In
dividends $75,935,925, and in the year em
braced In this report Jl»,l69,i81. or 17 1-3 per
cent, of all the dividends that have been
paid during the period of 34 years of the
existence of the system. Since October 31.
the end of the report year. 17 additional div
idends have been ordered, amounting :i th9
aggregate to about $625,000."
