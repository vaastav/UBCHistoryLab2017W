by a serious illness, has had a unique ox

OUT THE TELEPHONE BATES.
The extortionate natnro of tho Boll mono,

the telephono business, published for tho
first time in Tna Wobld this morning.
Out of aggregate earnings of 810,883,800,
tho subsidiary companies receive only 7.66
per cent, on their alleged capital. Tho

the lion's sharo of the profits.

EXTORTION NOT PE0TE0TI0N.
Whon Mr. Blums has read tho full text of
the President's message he will seo that ho
has done Mr. Oletsl-md an Injustice.
The President doos not objeot to " permit
ting protection to result froely as on incident
to revenue duties." Ho oxpressly says that
the tariff system " must be oontlnuod," and
and that in its readjustment " the interests
of American labor should bo carefully con
sidered, as well as tho 'preservation of our
manufaoturos," though " this may bo called
protection or by any other name."
It Is not incidental protection, but inten
tional and direct oxtortlon from tho tax
payers to whioh tho tariff reformers objeot.
It is stated in the un that Petes Mitchell,
" late of Sntp's oounsol," has beon "men

Paris, Dec T. After reading an abatract of the
President's message, laid before all Kuropo thla
morning, I saw Mr. Blaine ami asked him If he
would be willing to give hla views upon the recom
mendation of the President In the form of a letter
or Interview. He preferred sn Interview, tr I
would sgree to aend him an Intelligent ahorthand
reporter, with aucb questions as should give free
aoope for an expression of his vlowa. Tho follow.
Ing lucid and powerful statement la tho result.
Mr. Blslne began by saying to the reporter:
" I have been reading an abstract of the Presi
dent's meassge and bare been especially Interested
In the comments of the London papors. Those
papera all assume to declare tho niissage is a free
tra e manifesto and evidently are anticipating an
enlarged market for English fabrics In the United
States as a consequence of tho President's recom
mendations. J'erhaps that fact stamped tho char,
acter of tho meassge more clearly than any words
of mine can."
"Ton don't mean actual free trado without
duty ?" queried the reporter.
"No," replied Mr. Blaine. "Nor do the Lon
don papera mean that. Ibey simply mean that the
President has rocommended what In ttio United
States la known as a rovonno tartlf, rejecting the
protectlvo feature as an objeot and not even per
mitting protection to result freely aa on Incident
to rovenue duties."
" I don't know that I quite comprehend that laat
point," aald the reporter.
"I mean," said Mr. Blaine, " that for the first
time In the hlatory of tho United States the Presi
dent recommends retaining tho internal tax In or
der that tnj tariff may ba forced down evon bolow
the fair revenue standard. Ha rooommends that
tho tax on tobacco be retained, and thua that
many millions annually shall bo levied on a do
mestic product which would far better como from
a tariff on foreign fabrics."
Till TODiCCO TAX 8U0ULD UK BKrSALXD.
"Thon do yon moan to imply that you would
favor the repeal of the tobacco tax 1"
"Certainly; I mean Just that," aald Mr. Blaine.
" I should urge tbul It be done at onoe, even be
fore the Chrlatmaa holidays. It would la the first
plaoe bring great relief to growers of tobacoo all
over the oountry, and would, moreover, materially
lessen the price of the article to consumers. To
tiacoo to millions of men la a necessity. The Presi
dent calla It a luxury, but It Is a luxnry In no other
sense than tea and coffee aro luxuries. It la well
to remember that tho luxnry of yesterday btoomea
a necessity of to-day. Watch, If you
please, the number of men at work on
the farm, In tho ooal mine, along the railroad,
In the Iron foundry, or In any calling, and
yon will find ti In 100 chawing while they
work. After each meal the same proportion seek
tho solaoo of a plpo or a cigar. These men not
only pay tho millions of the tobacco tax, but pay
on every plug and avcry cigar an enhanced prtoe
whloh tho tax enables tho manmacturer and
rotallor to Impose, The only exouae for such a tax
Is the actual necessity under which the Government
found Itself during the war, and the years Imme
diately following. To retain the tax now In order
to dcatroy the protection which wonld Incidentally
flow from raising tho same amount of money on
foreign Imports la certainly a most extraordinary
polloy for our Government."
THE WIUBIBT TAX 8II0ULD BE RSTAtNXP.
" Well, then, Mr. Blalno, would you advise the
repeal of the whiskey tax also 7"
" No, I would not. other considerations than
those of financial administration are to ho taken
Into account with regard to whiskey. There Is a
moral aldo to It. To eboapen the price of whiskey
la to Inoreaae Its consumption enormously. There
would be no scnao In urging the reform wrought
by blgh license In many Statoa It the National Gov.
ernment neutralises the good offect by making
whiskey within reach of evory one at so cents a
gallon. Whiskey would be everywhere distilled It
the Hurvelllance of the Goverment were withdrawn
by the remission of the. tax, and Illicit sales could
not then be prevented even hy a polloy aa rigorous

" Whlskoy haa done a vast deal of harm In tho
United States. I wonld try to make it do some
good. I would use the tax to fortify our cities
on the seaboard. In view of the powerful letter
addressed to the Domocratlo party on the aubject
of fortifications by the late Mr. Samuel J. Tllden,
In less, I am amazed that no attention haa been
paid to tho subject by the Demooratlo Administra

has any government allowed groat cities on the

Baltimore, New Orleans and pan Francisco to re
main absolutely defenceless."

" But, " said tho reporter, "yon don't tklnkwe
are to have war In any direction T"
' Certainly not. aald Mr. Blaine. ' ' Neither, I
presume, did Mr. Tllden when he wrote his re
markable letter. But we should ohange a remote
chance into an absolute Impossibility. If our weak
and exposed points were strongly fortified, if to
day we had by any ohance even such a war as wo
had with Mexico our onemy oould procure Iron
clsds In Kuropo that would meance our great
oitteswita destruction or laytnem under contrl.
button."
11 But would not our fortifying now possibly look
aalt we expected warT"
" Why should It any more than the tortlflcatlona
made seienty or eighty years ago by our grand
fathers when they gnarded themselves against
successful attack from the armaments of that day?
We don't necessarily expect a burglar because we
look our d ore at night, but If by any possibility a
burglar comes It contributes vastly to our poace of
mind and our sound alecp to fiel that he can't
get In,"
HOUSED AM) rARMS TAT TOO MUCH TAX,
"But alter the fortification should be con
atructed would you still maintain tho tax on
whlakeyt"
'Yes," said Mr. Blaine, so long as there la
whiskey to tax I would tax It, and when the Na
tional Government should have 110 mo for the
money I would divide the tax among the members
of tho Federal Union with the specific object of
lightening the tax on real eatate. The bouses and
farms of the whole oountry pay too large a propor.
tlon of the total taxes. If ultimately relief could
be given In that direction It would. In my Judg.
ment, be a wise and beneficent polloy, some
honest bat misguided friends of temperance havo
urged that the Government should not use the
money derived from the tax on whiskey. My reply
Is that tho tax on whiskey by the Federal Govern
ment, with lis suppression of all illicit distillation
and coneeqent enhancement of price, haa been a
powerful agent In the temperance reform by put
ting it beyond the reach of so many. The amount
of whiskey consumed In the United States per
capita to-day la not more than to per cent, of that
consumed thirty yeirs ago."
" Beaidea jour general and sweeping opposition
to the President's recommendation, hare yon any
further specific objection T"
"Yea," answered Mr. Blaine; "I should
oerlouBly object to the repeal of the duty on wool.
To repeal that would work great injustice to many
Interests and wonld seriously discourage what we
should earnestly oneoursge, namely, the sheep
culture among farmers throughout the Union. To
breakdown wool-growing and bs dependont on
foreign countries for the blanket nnder which wo
sleep snd the coat that covers our backs, Is not a
wise policy for the National Government to en
force." TUE OLD BCOADOO.
" Do you think II the President's reoommenda
tlon was adopted It would Increase our export
trade!"
"Possibly In some few articles of pecnlar con

port trade tenfold as mnch In tho great ataplo fab
rlca, In woollen and cotton goods, tn Iron, In steel,
In all the thouaand and one shapes In which they
aro wrought. How are we to export staple fabrics
to the markois of Europe unless we make them
cheaper than they do In Europe, and how aro we
to manufacture them cheaper than they do in
Europe, unless wo get cheaper labor than they
have In Europe ?'
"Then you think that tho question of labor un
derlies the wholo subJeotT" "Of conrselt does,"
replied Mr. Blaine. "It Is, In fact, tho entire
question. Whenever we can force carpentera,
masons, Ironworkers and mechanics In every de
partment to work as cheaply and live aa poorly In
the United States as similar workmen In Europo,
we can, of course, manufacture Just as cheaply as
they do In England and Franco. But I am totally
opposod to a policy that would entail such re
sults. To attempt It la equivalent to asocial and
financial revolution, one that would bring untold
distress. "
" Yes, but might not the great farming class be
beneilted by Importing articles from Europe In
stead of buying them at higher prices at home!"
"Tho moment," answered Mr. Blalno, "yon
begin to Import freely from Enrope you drive cur
own workmen from mechanical and manufactur
ing pursuits. In the same proportion thoy become
tillers of tho soil, Increasing steadily the agri
cultural product and decreasing steadily the large
home demand which Is constantly enlarging aa
home manufactnrera enlarge. That of courao,
works great Injury to the farmer, glutting the
market with hla products and tending constantly
to lower prlcesa."
TRYING) TO SCAR! Till PARMEBS.
" Yea, but the foreign demand for farm products
would be lncrcaaed In like ratio, wonld It not!"
" Even suppose it were," aald Mr.Blalne, "how
do you know the source from which It will bo sup
plied. The tendency In ltuiala to-day and iu the
Aslatlo possessions of England Is toward a large
lncreaae of the grain supply, the grain being ralaad
by the cheapest possible labor. Manufacturing
oountrles will buy their brcadstulfs where they oan
get tnem oheapeat, snd the enlarging of tho home
markoi for the American farmer being cheoked, he
would aearch In vain for one of the tame valued
Hla foreign sales are already checked by the great
competition abroad. There never was a time when
the inoreaae of a large home market waa so valu
able to him. The best proof la that the farmers are
prosperous In proportion to the nearness of manu.
facturing oentrca, and a protective tail IT tends to
spread manufactures. In Ohio and Indians, for
example, though not classed aa manufacturing
States, the annual value of fabrics Is larger than
the annual value of agricultural products."
(At thla point Mr. Blaine entered Into an explana
tion ol the low tariff of l&W and Its results, claim
log that Its temporary illusory prosperity was fol
lowed by years of depression and distress. "It
la remarkable, "said Mr. Blaine, "that President
Folk recommended the tariff of IMS on precisely
the same ground that President Cloveland reoom
monds a similar enactment now, namely, the sur
plus in the Treasury was menaolng the prosperity
of the country. History Is repealing Itself. "
UB WOULD HAII MO OniNOE.
Thp Interview oomlnuosi
" Do you mean to Imply that there should be no
reduction of the national revenue:"
"No, what I have said implies the revorse. I
would rednoe It by a prompt repeal of the tobacoo
tax, and wonld make here and there some ohangea
In tho tariff not to reduoe protection, but wisely
foster It."
' ' Would you explain yonr meaning moro fully t"
"I mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that no great
system of revenue like our tariff oan operate with
emclenoy and equity nnleis the changes of trade
bo olosely watched and the law promptly adapted
to those changes. But I would mate no change
that should Impair the protective oharaoter of the
whole body of the tariff laws. Four years sgo, In
the act of 1883, we made changea of tho character
I havo tried to indicate. If sach changea were
made, aud tho fortification of our aeacoaat thus
undertaken at a very moderate annual outlay, no
aurplua would be found after that already accumu
lated had beon disposed of. The outlay of money
on fortifications, while doing great aervlce to the
country, would give good work to many mem"
"But what about the existing aurplua 7"
" The abstract of the message I have seen, " re
plied Mr. Blaine, "contains no referenco to that
point. I, therefore, mako no comment further
than to indorse Mr. Fred Grant's remark that a
surplus is always eaaler to handle than a deflolt.
l'OSSIBLE EFFECT OF TUB PRESIDENT'S POLICY.
Tho reporter repoated the question whether the
President's recommendation would not, If adopted,
give us the advantage of a large Inoreaae In ex.
ports.
' I only repeat, " answered Mr. Blalno, ' ' that It
wonld vastly enlarge our Imports, while the only
export It would seriously lncreaao would be our
gold and allver. Tost would flow out bounteously,
just as It did under the tariff of ma. The Presi
dent's recommendation enacted Into law wonld re
sult, as did an experiment In drainage of a man
who wlhed to tarn a swamp into a productive
Held. He dug a drain to a neighboring river, but
It happened, unfortunately, that the level of the
river waa higher than the level of the swamp. The
consequence need not be told. A parallel would
be found when the Prealdent'a policy In attempt,
ing to open a channel for an Increase of exports
should almply succeed In making way tor a delug
ing Inflow of fabrics to tho deatruotlon of home ln
dustry."
OPR OWN HAHXET FOR OCR OWN PEOrLE.
" But don't you think It Important to Increase
our export trade 7"
" Undoubtedly ; but It Is vastly more Important

I think, reaihed It, SCO, 000,000 any one year. Our

ILLIMITABLE PBBE TRADE AT DOME.
" It la Into this Illimitable trade, evon now In Its
Infancy ami destined to attain a magnitude not
dreamed of twenty years ago, that the Europeana
are struggling to enter. It la the herttsgeof ths
American people, of their children and their chil

trader appears unable to aee or comprehend that
thla continental trade not onr exchanges with
Europe la the great eource of onr prosperity.
President Cleveland now plainly proposes a policy
that will admit Europe to a share of tuts trade. "
A NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY NEEDED.
" But you are In favor of extending onr foreign
trade, are you not?"
" Certainly I am. In all practical snd advantage,
ona ways, bat not on the principle of ths free

thinks tub totrrn needs protection.
"How will the President's mes.age be takonln
lbs South 1" ' I don't dsre to answer that ques
tion. The truth has been so long obscured by oer
taln local questions of unreasoning prejudice that
nobody can hope for Industrial enlightenment
among their leaders Just yet. But In my view the
South abovo all sections of the Union needs a pro
tectlve tariff. The two Virginias, North Carolina,
Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Alsbsma and
Georgia have enormous rcaonrooa and facilities for
developing and handling manufactures. They
cannot do anything without protection. Even
progress so vaat as somo of these States have made
will be cheoked if the President's message Is en
acted Into law. Their Senators and Representa
tives can prevent It, but they are so used to follow
Ing anything labelled Democratic ' that very prob
ably they will follow tho President and blight the
progress already mado. By the tlmo soma of the
Southern Ststes get freo Iron ore and coal, while
tobacco la taxed, they may have occasion to alt

THE rALLAOY OF ADMITTING RAW MATERIAL.
" Will not the President's recommendation to
admit raw material find strong support 7"
" Not by wise protectionists In our time. Ter
bapa somo greedy manufa turers may think that
with fre coal or freo iron ore they can do great
things, bnt If they Bhould succeed In trying will,

If that vast Interest Is crippled In sny direction tho

About two years ago tho Musical Mutual
Protective Union of this city created a sensa
tion through its counsel, Horatio King, by
demanding of Secretary Whitney tho with
drawal of tho Marino Band of tho United
States steamer Now Hampshire from the
Newport Casino, from which J. M. Lander
and his orchestral members of the Musical
Union had been discharged by the Casino
governors for economical reasons.
Appropos of that effort on tho part of the
executive officers of tho Musical Union to put
a stop to the competition of tho enlisted naval
and army musicians with tho citizen musi
cians, a groat doal of discussion has since
arison, and musicians nil over the country
havo communicated additional griev
ances arising out of the employ,
ment of tho naval and military bands
to tho oxpulsion of tho civil organiza
tions' and individuals. Tho matter has
become of rmoh sorious importance that It
has beon taken in hand by tho National
League of Musicians, and that body will en
deavor, through regularly appointed dele,
gates, to bring the matter before Congress
at tho present session with a view toward ob.
tainlng such legislation as will put on end to
tho competition complained of.
A prominent monitor of the Musical Union,
who was on the Exeoutivo Board when the
Newport affair camo up and who was also
delegate to the National League Convention,
held InBt March in Chicago, said to a Would
reporter to-day:
It is not so much about the mere employ,
ment of the military and naval bands that wo
complain, but the fact that they play at rates
much bolow those of tho citizen musicians.
This cutting under our figures by men who
aro in the employ of the Government and
who are fed and clothed and sholtered out of
the funds paid in taxes by the citizens baa
bocome intolerable and must be stopped by
somo moons.
"Wo have complaints from Washington,
St, Louis, San Francisco and right here at
home. The Brooklyn Navy-Yard Band, oon.
trolled by Luciano Conterno and sons, ad
vertiso in a local newspaper for business and
havo, of course, a deoidod advantage in com.
peting with our members for engagements
outside of tho Nnvv.Yard.
"The Fort Hamilton Military Band haa
also filled many private) and publio en.
gagements at rates below those
which we can afford to play for.
"The United States Array Military Depot
Band at David's Island also has been putting
In its time and musio to tho disadvantage of
our members.
"Bandmaster Fred tor Linden, now at
West Point, led the David's Island Bond on
the occasions referred to. Latterly he has
employed tho West Point Band In perform,
ing at publio and private places, notably last
October during the firemen's parade at
Yonkors.
" The Government authorities permit this
sort of competition in order to increase the
pay of the army and navy musicians, who re
ceive but small pay from the Government.
" At West Point a first-class musician gets
$81 a mdtith and one ration a day ; second
class, $20 and a ration, and third-class, $17
and a ration. Tho leader at West Point is
not an enlisted man.
" Men of other professions, trades and vari
ous vocations, who are in the arinv and navy,
aro not permitted to perform work in compe
tition with civilians, a regulation expressly
prohibiting It. Why should the enlistea
musicians be excepted from tho rule V

An Alarming Inrreaee In tho Nnpply of
Children With Maalcal Genius,
Frank L. Pcrloy, Lew Dockstader's new
manager, took a big responsibility upon his
shoulders when ho advertised for n musical
prodigy. Since Mr. Perley's desiro has been
known tho highways and the byeways have
swarmed with prodigies, and " a plague of
prodigies" as virulont as tho ancient invasion
of frogs and locusts have been threatened.
Mr. Perloy devoted himself yesterday to
reading letters and examining photographs.
He took brief intervals for refreshments, but
his temblo task diminished his appetito. He
was a wretched man.
Here was n lotter ho received from Newark)
I think my little boy Willie la lust the boy you
want. He la Just 11 years old and I don't consider
It flattery to say that he plavs Just as well as people
tell me Hoffmann plays. I am sore It was not
necessary to go to Europe to get a mutlc.l prodigy
after hearing my boy play.
This came from the National Hotel, Bow

for a musical prodigy. 1 uUlm to be a musical
prodigy. My fine In mualc do not lay In the piano
or otner Instrument of torture, but in singing. I
nave a beatllul base voice. lr yon heard

so tuey remarked my voice was heavenly snd

Enclosed pleaso find picture of my little daughter

Mr. Perley pointed to this effusion 1
I have read your advertisement regarding a mu

" The next thing to bo dono," said Mr.

children who are not prodigies. I cannot
