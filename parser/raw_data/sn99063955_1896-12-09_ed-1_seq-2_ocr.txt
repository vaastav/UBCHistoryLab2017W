CUBA.
Our wookly review of the Spanish
Cuban war closed with a mere report
of the battle of Rubi Hills, which is
said to have been a desperate in
counter in which General Weyler and
the Spanish officers fought without
food and the Spanish soldiers were
without provisions for 30 hours.
Colonel Reyes arrived in New York
on the 28th ult., and confirms the re
port of the battle fought in the Finar
del Rio district in October, in which
engagement the Spanish lost 3000 men
and the Cubans only 30 men.
Dr. Taylor, a passenger from Ha
vana, says General Weyler has 30,000
sick soldiers on his hands, and that
the cause of Spain is lost in Cuba.
The news comes from Spain that
General Weyler has made requisition
for a regiment of cavalry and they
are to sail from Spain in December.
The Spanish government has bought
a great quantity of war material in
Italy.
On November 27 news reached Jack
sonville of two bloody battles in Plnar
Del Rio between Maceo'a forces and
the royal troops under Weyler. The
victory was with the insurgents and
caused great rejoicing among the
Cubans.
November 28. later accounts of the
battle in the Rubi mountains, about
thirty miles from Havana -show that
while marching Weylcr's army was
attacked by Mnceo's army. Tho
charge was so sudden and played such
havoc with tho Spain troops that the
Cubans were ablo to pour several vol
eys into their ranks boforo tho latter
could rally and return tho flro. It is
reported that General Woyler lost
1000 men and retreated taking his
wounded with him. Tho war is a
very bloody one and cannot b9 said
to bo carried on according to tho
rules of civilized warfare, us thero
1b no record of the wounded on
either sido being cared for.
O. B. Pendleton, a newspaper writer
from Key West, Florida, who has
been In Cuba more or less for 15 years,
has been arrested by tho Spanish gov-,
eminent. It is thought thore was some J
thing wrong about hls passport.
Lieutenant RIos report that In tho
wX 1
province of Camaquay the Cuban gov- j
eminent is in healthy operation. In
the mountains, under the roofs of the
old farm houses, the new government
of Cuba Libre is conducting .schools
for the education of children of the
patriots. The pupils range in age
from seven to thirteen, all the boys of
a greater age being engaged in the
fight for the Island's liberty.
Dec. 7. The effect of President
Cleveland's message Is to suggest to
Spain a reasonable course toward
Cuba. He suggests that they are
capable of maintaining the revolution
and that they are entitled to self
government, and of course he consid
ers that they are capable of maintain
ing a government. He suggests that
any reasonable plan or noine rule
would be accepted and acted up to in
good faith by the Cubans. The presi
dent, in his message to congress em
ploys the word autonomy. This
means the right of self-government
with a suggestion of the power to en
force the demand of that right.
The effect of the president's mes
sage will be to strengthen the feeling
of tho American people in favor of
Cuban liberty. In tho senate a reso
lution is already introduced declaring
our government should recognize the
indopendence of Cuba.
p While President Cleveland employs
kind and considerate language toward
Spain, it is easy to read between the
lines a certain tone of firmness aud
determination that says "we expect
for you to do your duty toward Cuba.
and do it soon." It would bo well for
school teachers to read the mes
sage relating to Cuba to the
children and explain its meanings
The Fence Law.
Editok Journal: Some days since
you published a petition to the com
ing legislature to amend the present
fence laws so that the owners of stock
should be made to care for them in
stead of the neighbors. Several states
have such laws now, and it seems like
a statement of the present laws and
the improvement proposed would be
sufficient to secure the change. As
the present patchwork law, is, the
owner of any fanning or garden land
must fence against all kinds and de
scriptions of stcck, whether he has
any himself or not- The new way is
to put the cost of supporting the
farm stock on the man who is bene
fited by their use. Is there anything
wrong in that? Another thing. The
fence must be just so high and strong
enough to turn an elephant almost, or
it is not a "lawful" fence and there
fore the "law" won't protect your
property. Again, you must not
use barbed wire because it would
"hurt" roguish stock If this
provision must stand, we want an
amendment to one other "law" so as
to provide that no householder shall
be allowed to use glass in his lower
windows, on penalty of paying all
damages and expenses incurred by
any burglar who may get cut or in
jured in breaking into said house.
This little amendment to our penal
code will bring it to a par with that
one compelling men to fence against
everybody's stock and yet punishes
him if the said stock gets hurt on the
fence.
Two Uvea Saved.
Mrs. Phoebe Thomas, of Junction
City, 111., was told by her doctors she
had Consumption and that thero was
no hone for her. but two bottles of Dr.
King's New Discovery completely
cured her and she says it saved his
life. Mr.Thos. Eggers, 139 Florida
street, San Prancisco, suffered from a
dreadful cold, approachlnc consump
tion, tried without result everything
else then bought one bottle of Dr.
King's Now Discovery and in two
weeks was cured. Ho Is naturally
thankful. It is such results, of which
theso are samples, that prove the
wonderful efficacy of this medicine in
Coughs and Colds. Freo trial bottles

The Way to Reform.
D. W. Smith, of Clackamas county
Populist, writes of his party which are
in power in that county:
After the entire people's party
ticket was elected, and the officers
elect had qualified and were sure they
would have the offices, they voluntar
ily held a caucus with the leading peo
ple's party men of the county to see if
it were not possible to inaugurate a
reform right from the start, and not
wait for the legislature to enact a law
reducing salaries. The result of that
caucus was that every conuty officer
pledged himself that he would con
duct his office for the salary provided
by law, and pay all deputies and other
expenses of doing the business of his
office out of his salary, and not ask
the county to bear any portion of it.
Theso reforms the Clackamas county
officers instituted on taking their
offices and are today carrying out;
making a saving to .the county for
the first month (July) over the same
month of tho previous year, in the
matter of salaries to deputies alone
amounting to $258.05.
Previous to the advent of the peo
ples party officers In the county, the
deputies of their Republican predeces
sors were paid by the county, instead
of tho officers out of their salaries.
Permit mo to add that tho prompt ef
forts or the people's party officers to
reduco taxes and expenses, has cem
ented the party together as nothing
else could havo done, and Insures
them an easy victory In 1898. It
dealt a fatal blow to Republican con
trol hereafter. Republicans stand
amazed at the sincerity of Populists
in carrying out reforms, but they have
to admire, Tho Populists or Clacka
mas say that "tho way to reform is
to reform."
