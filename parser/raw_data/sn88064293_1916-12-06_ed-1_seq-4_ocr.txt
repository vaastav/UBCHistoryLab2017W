ROMEO AND JULIET
HERE TOMORROW
The epoch making production of
"Romeo and Juliet" with Francis X.
Bushman as Romeo and the beauti
ful Beverly Bayfie as Juliet, will be
presented in Morgan- City tomorrow
afternoon and evening at the
Evangeline Theatre with the fullest
confidence of its welcome reception
by the public. More than three
months were consumed in the mak
ing of this photoplay and the cost of
production was in excess of a quar
ter of a million dollars. Not even the
lavish stage productions .made by
such wizzards of stagecraft as Henry
Irving and Richard Mansfield has
such magnificience been dreamed of,
much less attempted. The costumes
alone cost $35,000, and the repro
duction of market place of niedevial
Verona, with its euighteen buildings
meant an outlay of $25,000 more.
Director in chief of the produc
tion, John W. Noble, and the star,
Francis X. Bushman supervised the
production. They were assisted by a
number of Shakespearian directors
of the day.
Shakespeare's matchless story of
love and tragedy scarcely needs to
be refreshed in the minds of the pub
lic, since the tale has always been a
favorite one. Romeo and Juliet, who
fall in love with each other at their
first glance are members of the two
great noble families of Verona, the
Montagues and Capulets, who have
for years been at enimity with each
other. That their meetings and their
marriage must be in secret is respon
sible for Jpliets being urged by her
parents to marry Count Paris, and
her taking a potion with feigns
death by the advice of Friar Law
rence, so that Romeo may claim her
unharmed in the tomb. But the let
ter telling Romeo of the plan mis
carries. He supposes her really dead
and after he has killed himself be
side her, she awakens, and pressing
his dagger in her heart, follows his
spirit in death.
The genius of Mr. Bushman and
Miss Bayne has never been so well
exemplified as in the roll of the im
mortal lovers. The Bushman and
Bayne production "Romeo and Jul
iet" brings the soul of Shakespeare
to the hearts of the people.
A special matinee is announced
for school children to begin at 3:30
in the afternoon.

To The Editor of The Review:_
I will write and tell the readers of
your valuable paper a little about
Hegari, the new and wonderful
grain. It belongs to the family of
grain producing sorghums. It is de
cidely a dwarfish plant, not growing
more than four feet tall. It is hard
on land and its roots feed deep,
thus making it the greatest drouth
register of them all. The yield is
from forty to eighty bushels to the
acre. It is very early and two crops
can be made in one season here in
the south. It is extremely blight
resistant. I know that everyone will
be awfully well pleased with results,
both as a forage crop and for grain,
as is is eaten greedily by all live
stock and poultry. I know it is des
tined for a great future.

motor boat.
Almost everybody in Florida must
have been aware of Gloria's disappear
ance except the family of shiftless
paupers named Sipe.
Gloria had lain down to sleep just
about where the Sipe fence would
have been if there had been a fence.
She had not seen their shack beyond
the heavy growth.
When she awoke and yawned and
rubbed her eyes and looked about she
decided that she must have fallen
asl:ep in the horticultural building at
Bronx park. She rose to her feet and
limped aimlessly. She caught sight of
the Sipe hovel. It was a tumbledown
hut, but it looked like the Royal
Poinclana to her. The pigs and the
mangy dogs might have been gazelles
in a park and the ragged man and
woman and boy might have been a
group of royal blood.
She ran toward them for shelter.
They received her with stupid wonder
and with no hospitality.
The woman upbraided Gloria for,
being out in such rags and Gloria of
fered to buy anything they had. Mrs.
which was all she had. The only ex
tra covering was a new suit she was
making for the boy out of some hemp
sacking. Gloria did not want a boy's
clothes, but Mrs. Sipe sneered that
they were more decent than what she
had on. Also that she might pass
some rough characters or even some
Seminole Indians on her way back
and that she would be safer as a boy
than as a girl.
This convinced Gloria. She paid for
the clothes with the ring and went
into the shack to change.
When Gloria was dressed the Sipe
boy was ordered to take her to a path
which would eventually lead her to
the main road.
It was easier walking in breeches
than the skirts she had worn. But
she did not like the manner of the
boy. He began to pay her crude com
pliments and finally grew so impudent
that she boxed his ears. He took his

The family known as the "Cypress
Wolves" was the sole remnant of
revenge by pointing her in the wrong,
direction. He turned back and
laughed. He had an ill-nourished
sense of humor.
Gloria pushed on and on, growing
more and more doubtful of the way
and dismally footsore.
Suddenly a turn in the path re
vealed what she took to be an answer
to her prayers—a horse! It was a
doleful looking animal, yet It was a
horse. She ran forward and spoke
to it soothingly. But it backed and
reared. It was not a white man's
horse and it hated the whites even as
its red master had hated them. There
by hung a tale.
one of the fiercest tribes the paleface
had met in the Seminole wars.
If Gloria Stafford, who was strolling
slowly into the very heart of the
Cypress Wolf region, had come among
them as a young girl in distress,
they would have treated her with
chivalry. But her first action out«
raged their most sacred beliefs.
The old chief Hitakee of the Cypress
Wolf tribe had more dignity than
wealth. But he owned a horse. It
was an ancient mustang and its man
nen were bad; but it was at most
the only horse owned by an everglade
Indian.
At the very time that Gloria had

solving all his problems with the aid
of the medicine man cf his tribe,
died with great dignity.
The young brave Katcalani was the
logical successor to the chiefship. He
had his eye on that horse and
dreamed of himself astride It. The
widow of Hitakee had another idea.
Shonolakee was her name. She did
not intend that her dead husband
should walk all the way to the happy
hunting grounds. In her youth when
the chiefs bad horses and rode them,
they rede also to the far-off paradise.
Each chief's squaw saw to that, for
she cut the throat of his horse and
sent its ghost after its master's spirit.
Katcalani tried to save Hitakee'B
horse from sacrifice, but Shonolakee
grew so fierce and the ether squawa
so fierce that he felt his election in
danger.
Just about the time that Gloria
Stafford was feeling her way through
the thickets about the Cypress Wolf
village Shonolakee led the old horse
out to slaughter. She was weeping
so bitterly that she did not heed when
the sacrificial knife fell from her belt
She tied the horse, said her prayer,
and reached for the blade. It was
Stafford parted the palmetto leaves
gone. She turned back to look for it.
She had not gone far when Gloria
and saw before her the steed she had
prayed for.
She approached it with coaxing
words and untied the halter. The
por.y shied and tried to caress her
with its heels. Gloria had been well
schooled in horsemanship from child
hood. and she soon had her hands in
the mane of the unwilling mustang
and vaulted to Its back.
She had no sooner set her beels
into its ribs than the old squaw re
turned with the recovered knife. She
saw the sanctified charger being car
ried off—and by a ragamuffin evident
ly from one of the white trash fami
lies that even the Seminolbs despised.
She gave a wild cry of alarm, the
fierce "Yo-ho-ee-hee!" that had once
made the Indian-hunters' blood run
cold. The tribe answered in wonder
ing haste. She pointed to Gloria and
the vanishing horse. It was not van

was thick and Gloria did not know
the way. The Semlnoles divided and
ran in various directions to head her
off.
In a few moments the young chief
himself leaped from ambush, and
caught the horse by the nose and ear.
The old squaw was not far behind and
Gloria was dragged to the ground and
threatened with the death of a thief—
a sacrilegious thief.
Old Shonolakee raised her knife and
was about to plunge it into the heart
of the shivering captive when some
thing about the captive made her
pause. She saw that the lad was a
lass. Her rage was forgotten in
amazement for a moment. She
punted: "The boy is one squaw."
The other Indians stared at Gloria
and the pallor of her horror was red
dened with shame. The blush was
very becoming to her. The young
chief stepped forward for a closer look
at it.
Thinking him a possible rescuer
Gloria turned on him one of her
ninety candlepower smiles. The ef
fect was greater than she had ex
pected. Katcalani was dazzled. Ha
blinked, then turned his eyes on th«
smoky Indian maidens clustered about.
Each of them had ambitious dreams
of being his wife. But shabbily as
Gloria was dressed she was a tearing
beauty in any company. Compared
to the unkempt daughters of the ever
glades she was a goddess.
