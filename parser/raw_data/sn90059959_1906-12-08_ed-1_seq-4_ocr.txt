The President did not say anything
about the abuses connected with
Christmas presents. There uro a good
many who would have liked to have
the President make some strong rec
ommendations on this subject. It
would come in. handy about this time
of the year.
A remarkable feature o£ the Christ
mas season in recent years is the small
amount of attention given to tile real
meaning of the day. All sorts of no
tion and fairly tales are rehearsed, but
nothing said of Christ. The world, in
its falsa pride, thinks it is too modern,
too enlightened to pay any attention to
the story o£ the Babe of Bethlehem.
Senator Piatt was in his seat on the
opening day of congress and tells the
country that he will not resign. AVell,
decent people ought not to lose cour
age. His term will expire some time.
Piatt resigned from the Senate oncc,
with the idea that the people of New
York would coax him to withdraw the
resignation. The ilea never entered
their heads and Piatt remembers it.
Tho National Hibernian, published
at Washinglon, recommends it German
Irish Federation in this country. Such
a federation might be useful in pro
venting talk in the future about an
alliance between ho Anglo-Saxon
races. Tho Germans lia.vn liltlo more
reason lor being friendly with tho
English than the irisli. Knglaiul is
today the strongest opponent of tier
man influence in lQuropc. Of course,
the Irish havo long since ceased to
expect anything'from England. There
are, in this country today, according
to the Catholic. Sun, 23,000,000 people
of Irish blood and 24,000,000 people ot
German blood. That number of peo
ple -welded into a working organization
would put an end to all schemes ot
uniting this country and England in
an offensive or defensive alliance.
News comes from what appears an

prising if effort is not made by nar
row-minded persons to deprive the
pioneer priest of the credit that this
discovery gives him. There are few

doctor Crapsey has been convicted
.. .•of heresy by the Protestant Episcopal
.Church. The decision is not remark
able,. ,-for Dr. Crapsey not only has
be '|f,n Episcopal but long
ago 'flexed to jie ,-t Christian. It is
churoli still maintains that, it is neces
sary to believe that Christ was really
the Son nf God, in order to bo a Chris

could not fail to be otherwise. The
ehurcl-.es that allow private interpreta
tion o:' tho Scriptures must, necessarily
look for heretics. It is impossible for
intelligent men to read any document
and all agree upon the same meaning.
.Dr. Crapsey undoubtedly is honest,and
he maintained with a good deal oj
right on his side that ho has as much
right, to believe what he preaches as
tlie ini:iist.e-s who tried him for heresy
havo a right to believe what they
preach. Dr. Crapsey's caso shows the
necessity of authority in religious mat

His reference to the Japanese and
the public schools is likely to provoke
more discussion than any other fea

thoroughly aroused the people of Cal

is up in arms agaiiiit the President.

Our people must appeal to tho con

science, awakened, will sweep every
thing before it. AVe cannot light upon

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's message was
one of tlie most sensational documents
of its kind ever sent from the White
House. Many of the. President's rec
ommendations are radical in the ex
treme. Upon the question of taxation
alone lie seems to be uncertain about
his ground. 11c recommends a. grad
uated inheritance tax, but he lets it
be understood that the country is not
yet ready for a revision of its system
of taxation. About the tariff he has
nothing whatever to say. Tho me:
sage shows Mr. Roosevelt's immense found an independent church for the
personal energy and his ability for Fillpincs. Aglipay's idea was to en
accomplishing things. There never
was a president who allowed liimsclt
to bo interested in so many subjects.
Perhaps the best way to appreciate
what the President is doing and think
ing about is to ^Summarize) the leg

good opinion of the Japanese and they
will never submit quietly to have
Japanese children in the same schools
with hite children. The Japanese
are not even as highly thought of in
California as the Chinese. The Pres
ident's threat to use the United States
soldiers to compel the recognition of
treaty respecting the Japanese has
stirred the "people of tho coast pro
foundly.
The message is thoroughly charac
teristic of the President. It Is
direct and forceful. It is not
only remarkable for what it con
tains, but also for what it does not
contain. In view of the present feel
ing of the people upon the question of
tho tariff, tho country naturally ex
pected some recommendation upon
this question from tho President. His
failure to take, any stand upon this
point lias attracted attention. It may
be that he purposely omitted this
question with tho idea of later on
AGLIPAY FAILS.
A decision of vast importance has
recently been rendered by the Philip
pine Supreme Court. Tho decision
practically puts an end to the schism
lead by Aglipay, the self-appointed,
self-annointed archbishop of the so
called National Catholic Church.
This schism was organized shortly
after the American occupation by a
native prlert who was in the insurgent
army under Aguinaklo. AVhon the
movement lead by Aguinaldo failed,
Aglipny took advantage of tho feel
ing of discontent xisting among the
Filipinos and started the movement
which at- first gathered considerable
support. When the Spanish priests
and friars left the islands the people
were in many districts left entirely
without priests. Aglipay seized upon
the opportunity and urged upon the
Filipinos the advisability of organiz
ing a national church, which should
be independent of the Pope. At that
time the feeling of nationality was
strong and the people felt that they
had been imposed upon by the friars,
and many of them were led to believe
that the church organized by Aglipay
was really the Catholic church under
native prtests, instead of Spanish
priests.
Later on Aglipay attempted to en
list tho Protestant clergy in the move.
Ho proposed that Bishop Brent of the
Episcopal church and the other Prot
estant pastors should join the move
and persuade the American govern
ment to confiscate oil of the property
belonging to the Catholic church, and
drive out the Catholic priests and
list the United States government in
the move. He did not know that the
American policy of government pre
vented any Interference by tho state
in religious matters.
Tho Protestant clergy refused to
join in the movement. Aglipay's char
acter was not such that it inspired
confldcuce. He was far more able as
a political conspirator than a religious
leader. Nevertheless, in the beginning
Aglipay appealed to the people. The
idea that, the Phillipines belonged to
tlie Filipinos commanded .a rather
strong following. In several towns his
followers actually drove out the regu
lar pastors. He had churches in nine
teen of the provinces. When Areh-
of injunction be |,|S|10J) Harty went to the islands he
appealed to tho Philippine commission
to protect him in the possession of all
properties belonging to the Catholic
church. I11 July, !905, the Supreme
Court was given jurisdiction over all
questions involving the title to church
property. The Catholic authorities
brought actions in nineteen different,
provinces to eject the representatives
of tho so-called National Catholic
Church from Catholic churches that
they had taken possession of. In many
cases those in possession immediately
confessed judgment and 110 defense
was made.
The first of the contested cases lias
just Ik-en uisposed of by the Supreme
Court, and tho effect of It is to return
all church property to the possession
of tho regular Catholic, bishops and
priests. Aglipay and his followers will
thus be forced from nearly every par
ish where they aro now installed. If
the .schism is to foe continued, its pro
moters must build and equip their
own churches.
Aglipay's contention was that the
churches and the parsonages were the
property of the people of the parish,
who had the right to use them for
any purpose they desired and employ
any priest they preferred. AV'hen he
found the churches vacant or unused,
he would place one of his priests in
charge.
The court now decides that the prop
erty belongs to the Catholic church,
which built them and occupied them
for many years, it is probable that
this decision will cause the entire col
lapse of the Aglipay movement. The
movement had already commenced to
lose power among the people, chiefly
because of the change of management
of the Catholic church in the Philip
pines since the American occupation.

ish birth or, if born In the Philippines,
were of Spanish parentage. Last June
a native Filipino, the Rev. Father
Barlin, was ordained a bishop. It was
the first time that a native had ever
been made a bishop in the islands.
This failure to promote the native
clergy was one of the chief reasons
why Aglipay at first succeeded in his
movement. The appointment of Bishop
Barlin destroyed the force of Aglipay's
argument.
TILLMAN AND THE NEGRO.
From the manner in which the press
writes up Senator Tillman, a person
not knowing anything about the man
or the subject in which he is so in
tensely interested would be led to be
lieve that he is a thoroughly bad man.
Senator Tillman, in fact, is an intensely
earnest man, highly regarded by all
his associates in the United States
Senate. Like all men of his sterling
character, he is straightforward and
blunt in his speech. His bluntness
sometimes amounts almost to cruelty.
When speaking upon the negro ques
tion he speaks plainly about a subject
that the knows much abotit. On dif
ferent occasions he has attempted to
tell the people of the North the dif
ferences that arise between the two
races in the South. Ho has never
said anything upon a lecture platform
that lie has not dared to say upon the
floor of the'United States Senate. In
fact, his treatment of the race ques
tion upon the floor of the Senate has
on many occasions surpassed in di
rectness of statement anything that
ho has ever said upon his Iccture tours.
Tillman is a. better friend of the negro
race than those who condemn him.
In his Chicago speech he pointed
out that the negro race is now in a
majority in the states of South Caro
lina and Mississippi, and that the
negroes almost equal in number the
whiter in the states of Georgia and
Alabama, and that the proportion of
negroes in the states of Virginia,
North Carolina, Florida, Louisiana and
Arkansas is very 'arge. The people
of the- North can scarcely appreciate
the condition that exists in the state
of South Carolina. It is a condition
that calls for serious consideration and
for high class statesmanship. It is
undeniable that, as the two races are
now constituted in the South, the
whites will never consent peaceably to
bo ruled by the negro. They maintain
that the very existence of the white
race depends upon maintaining its po
litical supremacy. Tillman points out
how ii few "years ago a few bright
politicians gained complete control of
the state of North Carolina by com
bining the negro vote and what is
called the "white trash" of the state.
Tillman is doing a service in educat
ing the people ot the' North upon the
race question. It is a problem that is
sure to demand serious attention in
the near future. The condition in
which South Carolina and Mississippi
ilnd themselves will, very likely, over
take some of the other South Atlantic
and Gulf states. The negro race is
increasing much faster than the white.
Unless a change in the attitude of the
two races can be brought about, some
retried.'' that will Insure white suprem
acy must be provided for or a race
war will s-urely result. Either the
whites must rule politically, or the
slates where the negro predominates
must be entirely abandoned to the
negro race. No matter how unpleas
ant the fact may be, the truth is that
tho white people t'.f the South will
never submit to be ruled by the negro
racc as it Js at present constituted.
Tillman says so plainly and ho doubt
less voices the sentiment of the white
people of the South. He speaks a little
more bluntly than most of them would.
He admits very frankly what others
know to be true, that the whites main
tain their supremacy in certain sec
tions of the South by either prevent
ing the negroes from voting or refus
ing to count their votes when cast,
and yet -we think that the people of
the South know better how to treat
the negro race than do those of the
North. The fact, that the negroes re
main in the Southern states shows
that they prefer to live in the South
rather than take their chances in the
North. More crime against the blacks
is committed proportionately in such
states as Illinois, Indiana and Ohio
than in any of tlie Southern states.
It is only at the Jast election in the
city ot Chicago that a negro, who
was apparently elected Judge of the
Municipal Court on the Republican
ticket, was counted out. The Repub
lican politicians of the North are in
the habit of humoring the negro vote,
in order to help lut the Republican
party. The negro vote is kept solid
for the Republican candidates of the
North by pointing out to the negroes
the manner in which their race is
treated by the Democrats in the South.
The instances, however. In which
negroes are given any political prefer
ment by the Republicans in the North
are few and far between., Republican
leaders on the floor of the United
ptates Senate cry out about the re
fusal of the Southern people to sub
mlt to the .Appointment of negro post
masters and negro collectors of cus
toms. If the tjegro race Is to progress,
it must da so by raising the standard
.*
of its civilization, by learning self
control and by its members becoming
thrifty and self-reliant, rather than by
attempting to gain political supremacy
or by maintaining the senseless doc
trine of social equality.
As the two races now exist there is
an antipathy that makes it undesir
able and even impossible for them to
associate intimately. It is not a ques
tion of which race is the superior,
nor a question of equality before tht
law, but a question of racial differ
ences that makes it impossible for
either race to progress by interming
ling with the other. The best friends
that the negro race has are the Sena
tor Tillman?, who tell the whole truth,
even if it is unpleasant.
THE LESSON OF A MURDER.
A criminal case that has attracted
a great deal of attention, because of
the publicity given the details, has
just been concluded at Herkimer,
N. Y.
A young man, iiamed Chester Gil
lette, has been convicted of murder
in the first degree. The crime con
sisted in luring a girl named Grace
Brown away from iier home to a soli
tary place in the Adirondacks and
murdering her to conceal the evidence
of an illicit intimacy.
Such crimes have happened before
and will happen again. It would serve
no good purpose 10 even comment
upon the matter were it not for the
fact that it is apparent that many
similar crimes could be prevented if
parents would only exercise reasonable
care and control over their daughters.
The American girl prides herself
rightly upon her independence. She
goes about with practically the same
freedom of her brother. It never oc
curs to her that she differs in this re
spect from the girls of other coun
tries. Independence, self-reliance and
the power 10 look out for herself are
all commendable, but it is apparent
that a closer guardianship over their
daughters, by the mothers ot' the
country, would prevent many such
crimes. I11 every community there are
Chester Gillettes otid, unfortunately,
too, there are "Billy" Browns. Mur
der is only the occasional result. The
most frequent outcome Is the blighting
of tho life and the killing of the soul
of girls, whose years and inexperience
need the watchful i.are and guardian
ship of a mother. -The experience of
the murdered girl is the experience
of thousands of young women whom
the stress of modern life forces into
the stores, factories and other pur
suits. It is a subject delicate to treat
and the false modesty that prevents
parents from discussing it with their
children is responsible in a large de
gree for thousands of "Billy" Browns.
When the large number of girls who
throng the streets in every great city
and those who visit the sea shore and
the summer hotels unattended and the
independent young women who carry
their own latch keys' are taken into
consideration, the real wonder is that
so many escape the contaminating in
fluence of the trib of Chester Gil
lettes.
It would not be desirable to destroy
the independence of the American girl.
Tho strict guardianship under which
girls in every country of Europe are
held is unnecessary in this country, but
the extreme freedom, the utter disre
gard of care, the tal abandon with
which girls, still in their teens, mingle
with every class of men is destructive
to that innocence of character that is
the highest possession of womanhood.
Every European ciio visits America
comments on this featuro of American
life. We will always have cases like
that of the murdered girl, but the
prominence given the trial of her be
trayer will not be in vain if it brings
home to mothers the danger of allow
ing too much freedom to their daugh
ters.
ANARCHISTS AND THE POPE.
The' Attempt to Kill the Holy Father
by One of tho Foul Brood.
Apropos of the recent attack on th*
representative and vicegerent of
Christ, the Ogden Journal says
"We haven't any use far an anar
chist, for several reasons. They are,
imprimis, mentally unbalanced, antag
onistic to soap and razors, their
breaths are sour from the effects of
partialy digested beer, and they never
work. They rant and roar about,
abolishing all governments, never
dreaming of the consequences, and are
continually .plotting to end the earth
ly existence of some one, for reasons
they cannot intelligently explain.
"Usually an anarchist lias 110 hope
of Heaven nor fear of hell. Living a
sort of animal-like existence, that con
dition is quite natural. When a. per
son believes that beyond there is
naught but blackness. It is easy to de
termine to take human life for the
accomplishment of a material purpose.
The person who can Ibelieve that and
refrain from doing an injury is one
altogether to be commended. This
statement is made because the writer
knows of several professed atheists
who are kind, gentle, considerate and
humane. Not all atheists Ire anar
chists. but all anarchists areftatheists,
and this assertion is made ljvith due
consideration for the feeling! of athe­
ists who are not anarchists. In the
first place, an ignorant person has no
business to become an atheist, because
when lie does he is liable to become
an anarchist. It takes an intelligent
man to become a successful atheist.
"These anarchists have taken ad
vantage of the discovery and perfec
tion of high explosives to make bombs
and throw them about in an indiscrim
inate fashion. No one is safe from
attack, and in trying to destroy a ty
rant they would willingly wipe out
of existence a hundred innocent wo
men and children, so long as their ob
ject was accomplished.
"Prior to Sunday, the anarchists
have devoted their atention to kings,
queens, princes, presidents and such
like beings. But on this occasion they
attacked the pontiff of the Catholic
church, while lie was saying prayers
for all 'humanity—Including anarchists
—in St. Peter's cathedral.
"Happily they did not get him. A
combination of circumstances pre
vented that result. While we are not
of tlie same faith, and have nothing
in common with it, we should have
viewed the death of Plus with much
sorrow and regret. First, because of
his position second, because of his
personality.
"Pius is the very wise head of a
great organization, the members of
which look upon and revere him as the
vicegerent of God on earth. He is able,
learned and altogether a very conserv
ative and discerning man. He con
ducts the affairs of the church with
sagacity, prudence and zeal. He is an
advocate of piety, love and the prac
tice of the attributes of the Naaarlne.
He regards mankind as the children
of a common father, and, could he
have his way, would bring them all
together in one great family, where
they might be taught to love each oth
er as themselves, and God with all
their hearts and all their souls and all
their minds. In private life he is af
fable and friendly, hearty and some
what jolly. He loves to see every
one happy and has contributed a whole
lot toward making life's pathway
brighter for many.
"To have such a -man slain by the
unwashed hand of a dirty, lousy,
beer-guzzling, licentious, brutal dog
of an anarchist, would have been a
calamity indeed."
Belgium's Marriage Mart.
Two thousand bachelors from all
parts of Belgium, many from France
and some from Germany swept down
on the village of Ecaussines-Lel&ng
recently to find brides.
It was the fourth yearly marriage
mart, as established by the maids of
Eeaussines, and as there are only nine
ty-seven marriageable young ladies in
that quaint little place the supply of
matrimonial partners fell deplorably
short of the demand. All the same,
the proceedings were a great success.
The men began to arrive early in the
morning, but it was toward noon be
fore train loads of them appeared.
There were all sorts and conditions of
men. One man of 72 had traveled all
the way from Luxemburg to find a
wife, to whom he promised a dowry
that would place her beyond want.
There were tradesmen, clerks, median
branch of trade appeared to be un
ics, miners, laborers—indeed, no
represented.
Gay banners of welcome, triumphal
arches with mottoes of encouragement
for 'prospective husbands, figures of
Cupid and hearts pierced by arrows
were to be seen everywhere but the
local authorities had not accepted the
young ladles' proposal to name the
main streets "Place des Fiancailles,"
"Place Conjugale," and "Place de la
Concorde.
At noon the bachelors were formally
welcomed at the gates of the village
by the spinster committee. Last year's
president and several members of the
committee are now married as the re
sult of the festivities twelve months
ago and others liad been elected in
their place.
All marched lo the "Grande Plac%"
where there was an open air concert.
The bands played nothing but nuptial
marches and love songs. At the close
an adjournment was made to the town
hall, where the young ladles took their
places at tables on which stood bowls
of pink roses with such mottoes as
"Hope on," "Love," "Be Trusting,"
and "Have Faith."
A vacant chair was left beside each
girl, and ^t a given signal the men
with matrimonial intent made a. rush
to secure the seats. Then, coffee and a
sweet cake were served, followed by
a bonbon tasting of licorice. When
this was over the lady president made
a speech on "The Art of Pleasing
Man," which was wildly applauded.
Dancing in the open air ended the
program of the festivities.
Hundreds of letters, many of them
very amusing, -were received this year
from intending husbands. A railway
official from Paris anxiously inquired
whether in the event of not finding a
girl to his taste he could refuse to mar
ry and would be allowed to leave
quietly.
some bachelors from Gilly (France)
explained that they were young, good
I'O'jking and earning $60 a month, and
ware anxious to find wives from
Ivivussines, where the girls" are re­
-A •, v.-r'-JiLi-sV-i
nowned for their good looks and quiet
domestic life.
Two friends, a butcher and a hair
dresser, asked to be recommended to
nice girls by the president, but so mix
ed up their qualifications that it seem
ed as if the butcher shaved his ani
mals with antiseptic treatment and tho
hair-dresser slaughtered his customers
humanely.
Bishop Kenny Returns from Spain.
The Right Rev. William J. Kenny,
Bishop of St. Augustine, Florida, re
turned last week from Spain, where he
had ben examining old Franciscan
and -Spanish government archives in
search of authentic records of the
early history of Florida. The Bishop,
whose health has been greatly im
proved during his stay in Europe, was
tlie guest for a few days of the Fran
ciscan Fathers on West Tlilrty-flrat
street He was the celebrant of a
Pontifical Mass at the Franciscan
church, New York, and delivered a ser
mon on the present condition of Cath
olicism in Spain.
Bishop Kenney in the course of his
sermon touched on the threatened up
rising against the church in Spain, and
declared that the Catholic church and
the Catholic school system in that
kingdom were never stronger than to- 1
day, and tlie people generally never
more loyal to the old faith.
In an interview at the rectory the
Bishop told of his visit to Europe.
"I left this country," he said, "on
September 5, and all of my stay abroad
was spent in Spain. I landed at Cadiz
and visited Seville, Cordova, Madrid,
Salamanca, Toledo, Grenada, Madaga,
Valencia and other towns. At all of
them I found interesting records re
lating to St. Augustine.
"St. Augustine is the oldest diocese
in this country. It was founded in
1565 and placvd under the spiritual
charge of the Jesuits. In 15S0 the
Jesuits were replaced by the Francis
cans, who remained in charge until
1763. The peninsula was under Span
ish control from 1784 until 1821, when
it was ceded to the United States. Dur
ing the period of 183 years that the
Franciscans were in charge a great
deal was done for the Church mis
sions and schools were established and
many Indians were converted to the
faith.
"I found records relating to the dio
cese of St. Augustine as far back as
1594, when the Auxiliary Bishop of
Santiago was appointed to reside in
St. Augustine, and he stayed there dur
ing the Spanish occupancy. After the
United States secured possession of
Florida it was placed successively un
der the ecclestiastical Jurisdiction of
New Orleans, Mobile and Charleston,
and was made a Vicariate Apostolic
in 1858."

Wasn't a Box Car.
As the story goes he was an Irish
man, lately over, and was working in
the yards of a railroad, says an East
ern paper. One day he happened to
be in the yard office when the force
was out. The telephone rang vigor
ously several times, and lie at last
decided it ought to be answered. He
walked over to the instrument, took
down the receiver and put his mouth
to the transmitter, just as lie had seen
others do.
"Hello!" he called.
"Hello!" answered the voice at the
other end of the line. "Is this eight
slx-one-five-nlne?"
"Aw, gwan! Phat d'ye think ot
am—a bo* car?"
