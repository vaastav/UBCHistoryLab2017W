State Capito! News 1
EASY TO GET AT IT
Senator Somerville Shows How to
Hit Northern Securities Co.
TALK ABOUT THE EXTRA SESSION
Unusual Powers Conferred Upon Di
rectors by the Northern Secu
rities Company Charter.
Senator George W. Somerville of Sleepy
JDye, waa at the capitol yesterday. He
ta3 given much thought to the railway
consolidation question, and believes that
legal remedies are ample. He said to
day:
The law under which the Northern Securi
ties company charter was issued is unconsti
tutional, in that it confers special privileges.
It permits the corporation to buy stock in
Various railroad companies and carrying that
out, it might under its charter buy up the
Stock of all the railroad companies in the
Country, shutting out all others from owner
ship in railroads. This would certainly be
a special privilege.
If the Northern Securities company under
takes to exercise any control over Minne
sota railroads or to vote at their stockhold
ers' meetings, it must come in under the
Jaws of Minnesota. That could be prevented,
however, by a special act of the legislature.
Our railroad companies receive certain
benefits from the state. In return they are
•bilged to render certain services. This
Consolidation puts them in a position where
they may be prevented from rendering such
Services, and That is sufficient ground to pro
ceede for the forfeiture of the charters of
the railroads. They may also be reached in
the federal courts through the Sherman act.
Senator Somerville hopes the doors will
Hot be opened to general legislation at the
epecial session.
Talked Extra Sesmlon.
Lieutenant Governor Smith had a short
conference this morning with Governor
Van Sant. Said he:
We did not talk extra session much. I am
|iot a member of the legislature myself. For
toy part, I would like to come down for about
ft week, pass the tax bill just as It comes to
Us, and go home. The legislature delegated
Its power to the tax commission, and can
safely trust that body to draw up the right
kind of a law. It can be amended at our
leisure if defects show themselves.
Extraordinary Powers.
The attention of the attorney general
has been called to the extraordinary
powers granted the directors of the North
ern Securities company by its charter.
They have absolute authority to dispose
of or to distribute the profits, and the
question of publicity is in their hands.
The paragraph referring to inspection
of the records provides that the records
•hall be accessible only as directed by the
laws of New Jersey by action of the board
of directors or a stockholders' meeting
Now the New Jersey law only says that
the records shall be made public as the
articles of incorporation direct. This
leaves it all in the hands of the direc
tors and perfunctory gatherings of stock
holders, any of whom may be frozen out
by the directors. The executive commit
tee of the board of directors has all the
authority of the board itself, and it, there
fore, an inner ring in absolute charge.
Wants 11 Share of Bodies.
The Northern School of Osteopathy of
Minneapolis, claims an equal share of bodies
furnished medical institutions under the state
law. It provides for a distribution of bodies
from charitable institutions, that are un
claimed by relatives, to medical schools.
ORE~RATES~FiLED
Roads Submit Their Schedules From
MineH to Dockn.
In accordance with the order of the
state railway and warehouse commission
the Duluth & Iron Range and the Dxiluth'
Mlssabe & Northern roads to-day filed
their schedules of rates from the 1 mines
to the ore docks.
This was the point at Issue between the
commission and the roads, but the attitude
of the commission has changed somewhat
eince the controversy began, owing to
legal advice, and the present filing of rates
is not particularly significant as a con
cession.
S. A. HOTEL PLANNED
Commander Booth-lucker's Idea
for Minneapolis.
AND THIS WAS HIS BUSY DAY
AddregNe* and Meetings Take Up the
Salvation Leader* Time-
Talk at the "U."
Comrade Booth Tucker is planning for a
workingmen's hotel in Minneapolis. It is
probable that as a result of the visit of
the commander and his staff, Minneapolis
will have one of the hotels in the Salva
tion Army circuit.
Said th& commander this morning:
"These transient workingmen know our
ways and we know them. They are ac- |
quainted with us and know our officers.
They like to put up where a Salvation
Army captain is in charge. One of them
will come, up to tht; counter and Inquire
of the clerk if he knows Captain So-and-
So in another city, and is able to talk' of
this and that officer all over the country.
"We really ought to have such a hotel here;
we have the experience. We are able to
help this class with our labor bureau
also."
Another plan which Commander Booth-
Tucker has. in mind is the establishment
of the army in new headquarters. Since
the burning of the former barracks, the
work has been much hampered and the
Commander is conferring with the Lieu
tenant Colonel in regard to a permanent
location.
A council if 100 officers in the north
western province comprising Minnesota,
North Dakota, Wisconsin, Northern Mich
igan and northern Illinois, was held this
morning at the First Baptist church.
With eager, intent faces they listened to
the commander as he addressed them in a
conversational manner, giving them new
ideas and plans of how to keep the work
up to the times. He believes that the
power of the Salvation Army lies in the
fact that all its officers have kept in
touch with the work.
At the meting at 2:30 "What About Our
Own souls?" was the main thought. The
great danger with religious work, said
the leader, is that the workers may lose
the freshnea of their own experience.;
The great thing is tor the officers to keep ,
themselves right and then they can talk j
to their soldiers. ;
Commander Booth-Tucker, with his
staff, will conduct a meeting in English
this evening at the Swedish Temple, Sev
enth street and Tenth avenue B, for the j
Scandinavian Salvationists. The band and >
singers that the commander brought with i
him from New York will assist. Last |
evening the commander delivered his j
lecture on "'Light and Darkness" at the
People's church in St. Paul. A tea was
served at 5:30 this afternoon, which was j
attended by officers. The party will \
leave in the morning over the Chicago
Great Western for Dcs Moines.
Describes Work to Students.
The commander addressed the students
of the university at chapel this morning.
He talked of the work of the Salvation
Army. In an educational way the Chau- i
tauqua or corresponding school method
is being used. One thousand young men j
and women study the art of winning souls
by mail, and are prepared for ministry in
Salvation Army work. Beginning at the ]
age of 12, with the parents' permission, [
the child is put through a regular course ;
of study and graduated. Along the musi
cal line the commander said that the army'
was doing much work — 18,000 brass bands
men are enlisted and many musical com- ;
positions are contributed. The army
turns out 5,000 poems a year, some of
which live. In a literary way the army
publishes a paper with a weekly circula
tion of 1,060,000 and 100,000 books are writ
ten every year.
The commander closed with a reference
to the sociological work in which 209 in
stitutions are managed for. helping the
poor and accommodations are provided
daily for from 8,000 to 9,000.
COURT NEWS
JURY COMES SLOWLY
The Pickett Case Can Hardly Be
Opened Before To-morrow.
All persons interested in the Pickett
murder case hoped to have the trial in
full progress long before noon yesterday.
When seven men were so easily secured
Monday it was not thought that much
time would be consumed in getting the
remaining five.
The special venire of fifty men drawn
by Coroner Williams brought out a fine
lot of jury timber, but nearly all those
examined fell outside the works, and by
noon only three new jurors had been se
cured.
These were S. C. Tooker, 820 Summit
avenue, a broker; Walter S. Jamieson,
1003 Twenty-third avenue XE, a sales
man with Wyman, Partridge & Co.; Louis
R. Schaller, 1608 Aldrich avenue, a fuel
dealer.
It will be some hardship for the trio
secured this morning to serve, as they
are, figuratively speaking, dragged from
their business without much chance to
set matters right or to leave instructions.
The jurors are obliged to remain in the
custody of the sheriff at the courthouse
even though they have heard no evidence
as yet.
Albert H. McClane, 3040 Clinton avenue
a foreman at the Security warehouse and
Henry H. Hall, 1825 Elliot avenue, a prin
ter, were sworn as the eleventh and
twelfth jurors respectively, in the case
this afternon. It was then learned that
S. C. Tooker was too ill to serve and by
agreement of the attorneys he was ex
cused. The panel had by this time been
exhausted however, and there was another
tedious dalay in waiting for another batch
of jury material.
Hanson Must Serve Eight Years.
Alexander Hanson was sentenced to the
Stillwater penitentiary for eight years by
Judgo Elliott yesterday morning. Hanson was
convicted of rape, on the testimony of Hilda
Jsaaison, who said she had been assaulted in
Elliott park one night by Hanson. At the
time of the arrest by Lieutenant. Ginsberg
and Inspector Bahan, Hanson was shot, while
trying to escape and was seriously wounded.
He received the sentence without sign o£ emo
tion.
MORE~BILLS APPEALED
THE CORONER'S HELD UP AGAIN
1
The Other Is That of the Detective
Agency Which Hunted Down
Blind I'lkn.
Coroner U. G. Williams again finds
himself afoul the Taxpayers' League. His
I October bill for $201.50 has been protested
and doubtless will be heard of in the dis
trict court later on. It has been allowed
i by the county commissioners, but the ap
; peal is on the ground that illegal items
I are charged and that Coroner Williams
I has failed to make restitution for fees
which, under the decision of Judge Me-
Gee, are illegal. It is contended by the
Taxpayers' League that before any fur
ther sums are paid to Dr. Williams he
should return the illegal charges. The
' total amount thus illegally held is $336.33,
,as follows: January, $67.83; February,
i $46.90; March, $58.76; April, $55.63; May,
$47.40; June, $51.41; October, $5.40.
Detective Bill Appealed.
An appeal has also been taken on the bill
of $59. yO of the McNulty Detective agency
for services in hunting down "blind pigs."
The bill has had a hard experience. As
sistant County Atorney C. L. Smith re
fused to "0.X." it. The county com
missioners would not otherwise allow it.
Later the bill returned to the county
board with Judge McGee's "0.X." The
commissioners then passed the claim, tn
the petition of appeal it is represented
"That neither the grand Jury nor the dis
| trlct judge had any power to incur this
j expense; that the 'O.K.' of the same by
the judge does not make it a legal charge;
that the county commissioners have no
I power to appropriate monty for such
| services." j
THE MINNEAPOLIS JOURNAL.
THE "AGGIES" ARE OFF FOR CHICAGO
Enthusiastic Send-off to the Party of School of Agri-
culture Students —Minnesota's Great Record
THE PARTY OF SCHOOL. OF AGRICULTURE] STUDENTS THAT LEFT FOR CHICAGO ON THE GREAT WESTERN LAST NIGHT
: nearly one hundred students from the
school of agriculture left Monday night for
Chicago to artend the international live
stock show, which is being held thia week.
Judging from the fact that the students
of the agricultural college have no ath
letic organization other than a basket ball
team, and consequently are less before the
public eye during the early months of
the school year than most other insti
tutions, one might form the opinion that
school pride aud institutional spirit are
not quite up to par out at St. Anthony
Park. The fact is, however, that the boys
oat there are enthusing over another sort
of thing, and now that the football season
is over they are getting their innings in
quite proper shape.
Ever since the opening of the school
year a large number of animals have
been fed and rubbed and exercised under
the direction of Professor Thomas Shaw,
in preparation for the big Chicago show.
Early last week a hundred iind fifty fine
animals were sent down under the care of
eight students who are in training to be
come live stock experts. Late in the week
Professor Shaw and Dean Liggett fol
lowed and are now in charge of the sta
tion's exhibit.
NO- SUBTREAS. I
Mr. Fletcher Compelled to
Abandon His Efforts for
Minneapolis.
Introduces a Bill for an Ap
propriation for Public
Building. . ;
*u™£n?,%Z%?,?&n BttreaU ' R°Om *S '°at
Washington, Dec. ' 4.—Representative
Fletcher has abandoned the idea of se- i
curing a subtreasury for Minneapolis and
he will devote his attention this session
to other legislation. <
"The treasury department is solidly
against the establishment • of that sub
treasury," said Mr. Fletcher to-day. "The
latest official to go on record is Controller
of the Currency Ridge who complained
that largo sums are tied up in subtreas
uries at times when it is needed in busi
ness channels. He advocated the entire
abolition of the subtreasury system and
extension of deposits in national banks.
I think that his views will be adopted
by congress in time and that government
funds will be put in circulation through
national banks under suitable restrictions
to safeguard the government's interests "
Mr. Fletcher introdced a bill to appro
priate funds for the construction of an
addition to the Minneapolis public build
ing. Other measures will be Introduced as
opportunities present themselves.
South Dakotans in and for Office. :
The South Dakota delegation called on
the president to-day, and paid their re
spects. At the same time they introduced
Colonel R. W, Stewart of Pierre, United '
States Marshal Kennedy and Nye Phil
lips of Sioux Falls. R. s. Person of
Howard, auditor for the interior depart
ment, was with the delegation and the
president was urged to send his name to
the senate for confirmation. He was given
a recess appointment by President Mc-
Kinley, and is one of the officials whose
records have been under scrutiny by
President Roosevelt since he entered the
White House. The senators and repre
sentatives stated that Person had made
a good record and their indorsement on
that point is backed up by Secretary
Gage. The delegation also urged the re
appointment of United .States Marshal
Kennedy and District Attorney Elliott
which was decided upon last winter Their
terms will expire in January.
Second Lieutenant Arthur Fuller of
Pierre, recently appointed to■ the regular
army, was recommended for promotion
to a first lieutenancy. Lieutenant
Fuller stood very high in his examina
tion for original appointment, and promo
tion was urged on the ground of merit
alone. Apparently the only objection to
promotion is Lieutenant Fuller's age He
is only 22, and it is unusual to give such
youngsters so high a rank as his friends
want him to have.
He' Moorni With Rising.
Judge Thomas Howard of St. Paul who
was removed from the rural free delivery
service, is in Washington, seeking rein
statement. His case is different from that
of H. G. Rising of Faribault, who can be
reinstated because he was a soldier in
the civil war. Howard was removed be
fore his position was placed in the clas
sified service by the president's order
Postoffice department officials say he can
not get back in the service without pass
ing an examination. He will make his
fight through Senator Nelson.
Postofflce Appropriation.
Representative Stevens called at the
treasury .department to-day and agreed
to have a favorable report made on the
proposition to make a deficiency appro
priation for tire completion of the new
fedral building at St. Paul. The con
tractors completed the building on the
promise of payment from future appro
priations by congress. Mr. Stevens thinks
an , emergency apropriation bill will be
passed before Christmas, even though no
appropriation committee is named by the
speaker. :.'■■ -

It was an enthusiastic crowd that went
to Chicago last night in two special cars,
provided by the Chicago Great Western
road. They were under the organization
and leadership of Professor J. M. Drew,
Andrew Boss and M. H. Reynolds. No
athletic organization has left a Minne

enthusiastic send-off than was given this
crowd, who are to shout for 1 Minnesota
at Chicago during the next three days.
After supper the entire student body met
in the chapel and held an up-to-date mass
meeting. Speeches were made by mem
bers of the faculty; songs were sung by
the students, and dispatches read show
ing that Minnesota is taking a strong
lead in the first day's judging. These
dispatches report the experiment station
as winning fifteen prizes on cattle during
the first day, of which five are first*.
They also win sixteen prizes on hogs;
eight, firsts and eight seconds, making a
premium value of over $70u. This is con

MORRIS AMENDS

Changing the Nelson Act to
Prevent Indian Timber
Abuses.
»
Nelson Law's Good Results
Prevented by Improper
Administration.
From The Journal Bureau., Jtoom 46, l'ott
Building, Washington.
Washington, Dec. 4.—Congressman Mor
j ris of Duluth to-day introduced a bill
j for the amendment of the Nelson law,
which he thinks will correct the abuses
which have crept into the Indian timber
cutting in Minnesota during recent years.
Morris' bill is a direct result of a con
; ference held at the last session of con
! gress between the Minnesota delegation
and the secretary of the interior. At this
conference the question was gone over
carefully and some general conclusions
reached. These conclusions Judge Morris
seeks to present in his bill.
He would amend the Nelson law by re
quiring that Indian timber be disposed of
on bank scale, instead of selling it in
forty-acre lots. He would have it disposed
of in larger quantities in the discretion
of the secretary of the interior, the object
being to get the largest sum possible for
the Indian fund. This plan would also
prevent purchasers from selecting the best
for ties and leaving the others. In other
words, the secretary of the interior
should be able to dispose of good and bad
forties together. After the pine has been
removed the Morris bill provides that the
land be held in the same way that agricul
tural land is held—subject to homestead
laws. Said Judge Morris in discussing hia
bill:
I am sure that the Nelson law, had it been
well administered, as Senator Nelson intend
ed it should be, would have prevented many
of the evils that have crept into the Indian
timber business since it has been in force.
Under Secretary Hoko Smith especially, the
law was improperly administered and the
foundation laid for the evils that exist to
day. Nobody regrets this more than Sena
tor Nelson, for his law would have served
an important purpose in the hands of com
petent officials. Whether my bill will finally
become a law as I have introduced it, I do
not know. There may be changes. I am
satisfied, however, that ita main features will
be incorporated into some law which con
gress will probably pass at this session.

PHILIPPINE GOODS
Mr. Gage Think* Present Tariff I,aw
Needs Little Revision.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The cabinet meet
ing to-day was principally devoted to a
discussion of the insular decisions handed
down yesterday by the suprem court. It
is believed the majority opinions of the
court were in most respects satisfactory
to the administration. It was pointed out
that the ultimate results of the decisions
are in a measure speculative, except that
the customs duties collected in this coun
try on goods shipped from the Philippines
since the ratification of the Paris treaty
■will have to be refunded. It is not
thought, however, that the aggregate will
be large, and Secretary Gage expects that
it will be less than a million dollars.
He called attention to the fact that the
great portion of the imports from the:
Philippines are admitted free under bur
general tariff laws, notably hemp, which
is a leading staple.
The present Philippines tariff, Mr. Gage
thinks, will need little or no revision.
It was prepared after the most thorough
investigation and is said to be highly
satisfactory to the business interests of
the islands. The preparation of a tariff
on Philippine importations into the Unit- !
ed States, however, is expected to con
sume considerable of the time of congress,,
but there, is expectation that, pending a
final settlement congress by joint resolu-;
tion may continue the duties Imposed by
the Dingley tariff and thus, cut off a flood
of Imports which might follow the an
nouncement that all duties were removed.'
WEDNESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 4, 1901.
Yards, Chicago: We most heartily congrat
ulate you ou yesterday's achievements.
To Professor Thomas Shaw, Transit House,
Chicago: Congratulations on yesterday's
prizes. Hurrah for Minnesota.
This trip to Chicago is becoming a fea
ture of the work at the school. Professor
Shaw says: "It is of prime importance
that the boys who are to become the lead
ers in agricultural life have a chance to
see this big show, which brings together
the best that the most expert breeders in
the world can produce. The lessons to
be drawn from comparisons here made as
to ideal types of breeds, will never be
forgotten by the student who means busi- i
ness; and it ought to mean much to the |
,sta.ce that this trip can be taken under
such direction as will make it count for j
the most in the future lives of these farm j
boys." Speaking before his departure for ;
the-show, Professor Shaw said: "We will
get some prizes. But every one we get !
will be earned. It is a big thing to com- !
pete againsi a continent and that is what ]
\\e have to do."
The travelers will be beck at St. An
thony- Park, ready for regular work on
Friday morning.
MESSAGE "IN HOUSE
Salient Points Greeted With Enthu
siasm.
NEW COMMITTEE ON HOUSE RULES
Resolution* Adopted for the Prep
aration of Testimonials to Pres
ident MoKinley's -Memory.
Washington, Dec. 4.—Ordinarily presi
dential messages at the opening of a con
gress are listened to in perfunctory fash
ion, but in the house throughout
the reading the keenest interest was
manifested. Hardly a member left his
seat until the reading was concluded.
There was a slight murmur of applause
when, in concluding the recommendation
for legislation to put down anarchy, the
clerk read: "No matter calls more urgent
ly for the wisest thought of congress."
The murmur when this sentence was read
was followed by a burst of applause when
the clerk read: "The American people are
slow to wrath, but when their wrath is
once kindled it burns like a consuming
flame."
Probably no other portion of the mes
sage attracted so much attention as that
relating to trusts. No demonstration was
evoked by the reading of this portion of
the message, but the recommendation for
the re-enactment of a Chinese exclusion
law drew applause from both sides of the
house.
The reading of the message in the sen
ate was also closely followed by the
members. ,■ ■'.'.

A MONTCLAIR INCIDENT.
Some years ago a Montclair (N. V.) party took a ten-pay
ment life policy for $10,000, not in a Massachusetts company.
He paid nineteen semi-annual premiums but failed to pay the
twentieth. Eight months later he found that his $10,000
policy was worth not one cent. The nineteen payments had
beejo. confiscated because he failed to formally ask for a patd-up
policy within six months.
This could not have happened in a Massachusetts company.
He might have had an absolutely uon-forfeitable asset of over
$9,000 in the STATE MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY
OF WORCESTER. MASS., earning dividends yearly, and pay
able in full at death, or a scientifically just proportion on de
mand.
The policies of nearly all companies are better now than
at the time in question, and the improvement Is due to the in
fluence of the Massachusetts insurance law and the example of
Massachusetts companies; 1 and Massachusetts policy
are stall better than any others. Your age and address to either
of the undersigned will secure a specimen policy with full par
ticulars.

THREATENS DEATH
Crank Letter Writer Attacks Rev.
Mr. Doran.
TWENTY MISSIVES MAILED HIM
%
Persecution Dates From McKinley
Meeting When the l'legr)-man
Uuiuted the Anarchist*.
Special to The Journal.
Rochester, Minn., Dec. 4.—Rev. Frank
Doran, pastor of the Methodist church of
this city, is now the object of attack of
some Individual who says he seeks to
take his life. His life has been repeated
ly threatened in letters received by him.
It was at the McKinley union memorial
service that Mr. Doran went after the
anarchists In no uncertain manner, scor
ing them and their teachings. Later he
learned that some did not agree with the
intelligent portion of his audience, as he
j shortly afterwards received a letter
threatening his life. He paid no attention
to thi3 Letter, and was greatly surprised
a little later to again become the re
cipient of a threatening missive of the
same nature. Since the Memorial Day
exercises he has received twenty of these
letters.
The hand writing appears to be the
same on them all. Some are mailed in
this city and others bear the postmark
of neighboring postoffiees. At first the
letters simply warned him to look out,
but the later ones include his wife, who,
he is told, must not accompany him to any
place, as the writer does not want to kill
her, too, which might be done should she
be in his company when the time chosen
should arrive.
Letters have also been sent to prominent
Catholics in the county bearing Mr.
Doran's signature, containing sentiments
derogatory to the Romanists and alto
gether foreign to any feelings held toward
that sect by Dr. Doran. He has also been
warned that the new Methodist church
would be burned and the glass broken at
an early day.
Dr. Doran Is a very popular man, an
eloquent and fluent speaker, and has been'
pastor of the Methodist church in this
city for nine years. He has not the
slightest idea where the letters come
from, as he has not a known enemy in
this county.
GOOD RICH CREAM
Local Dairymen Stmpeoted of laiug
a Chemical Thickener.
Are milk supply houses of the twin cities
putting a "thickener" Ln the cream they are
selling?
Appearances ar suspicious. Of late the state
dairy, and food department has collected a
number of samples, most of which are de
cidedly "off." The state law requires cream
to contain 20 per cent of butter fat and
in many cases the samples test as low as 13
and 14 per cent Iv appearance the cream Is
all right. It is thick and yellow. This In
Just what makes tha dairy department sus
picious. A certain company, which makes
a business of aiding and abetting dairymen
to deceive aonßumero by preservatives, has a
preparation to help cream look creamy. It
is suppoße4 to be a compound of lime, sugar
and water, and a spoonful of it, added to a
gallon of cream and four gallons of milk,
will make five gallons of beautiful cream.
If this compound . is being, used In • th* twiu

NO WINONA-CHICAGO LINE
No Such Independent Phuuo Exten
■lon Is Planned.
President Eder Moulton of the Rapid Serv
ice Telephone and Telegraph company says
there is no truth In the report from Wlnona
that the company would build a direct line
from Minneapolis to Chicago, competing with
the Bell company. The line to Winona and
La Crosse is not being constructed with that
end in view.
Mr." Moulton, who is also president of the
Consolidated Telephone and Telegraph com
pany, says that at present there is a gap. of
forty-eight mllea In the Mlnneapolls-Duluth
line. One end Is at Barnum and the other at
Pine City. The crew is working at the rate
of five miles a day. At this gait the three
copper circuits will be ready for set-rice
Jan. 1.
The foremen of the construction crews have
instructions from Mr. Moulton to make an
air line to Duluth without reference to inter
mediate towns.
Tall. Man and Short Man—Two hold
up artists, the proverbial long man and short
man thrust a revolver into the face of Ed
ward S. Prince. 420 E Sixteenth street, last
night and rifled his pockets. .Mr. Prince is a
bookkeeper .for the Deer«>-Webber company.
He was hurrying to the office, shortly after 8
clock last evening, to keep a business en
gagement, when he was ' accosted by the two
men at Third avenue N «nd First street
Being covered with the revolver Mr. Prince
could not offer very much resistance. Th«
robbers, however, secured only a cheap watoh,
10 pennies belonging to Mr. Prince's little
child, a Chinese coin and a pocketbook con
taining nothing but papers.
