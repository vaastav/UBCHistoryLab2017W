WHAT'S GOING ON.
FIVE MINUTES WITH THE BIG
NEWS OF THE WORLD.
Congress Begins Its Session.
The first session of the 67th Congress
opened Monday. In the Senate, Senator
Frye, president pro tern., presided and will
continue to do so, owing to the vacancy
caused by the advancement ot Roosevelt.
In the House, Henderson of Iowa was re
elected speaker by the Republicans over
Richardson, Dem. by a vote of UK) to 141.
An attempt to mod'ify the rules of the
House so as to reduce the power of the
committee on rules failed, though favored
by the liemoerats and some of the Repub
licans. Tuesday, the message of President
Kooaevelt (printed on another page) was
read in both houses, the reading requiring
two hours and a half. It wag listened to
attentively. A committee from both
houses was appointed to see by w hut token
res)ect for the late president may tm
shuw u. The houses then adjourned until
Friday.
Mora Insular Cases Decided.
The federal supreme court handed down
a decision Monday in the so-called
"fourtetn-diamond-ring case," by which
it is determined that duties collected by
this government on goods brought from
the Philippines, in the absence of legisla
tion by Congress secially covering it,
were wrongfully collected and must be
remitted. The sovereignty of the islands
passed from Sin to the I'nited States by
treatv, and the Philippines became a jart
of this country. Tariffs, unless Bsx-ially
raised bv Congress subsequent to that
time, cannot be enforced. This decision
was iu line with the Porto Kican decision
of last year. The so-call.-d Kooley case
No. 2, involving the constitutionality of
taxes paid in Porto Kico on goods shipped
from New York was also decided, the tax
being upheld. In each case the court was
divided, 5 to 4.

Twenty thousand people were present.

a game tight. Daly, the ex-Harvard cap
tain, virtually won for West Point by
kicking a goal from the field, then mak
ing a M-yard run and a touchdown and
goal. Annapolis secured one touchdown,
the score ending 11 to 5. Roosevelt and
laly divided the enthusiasm.
