The Presidealn's Message.
As promised last week, we lay
before our readers a synopsis of
the President's message, adopting
for that purpose an editorial review
of the Times-Democrat, which we
believe concisely mentions every
point made by the President:
T1'e message of President Cleveland,
whllich we give elsewiere, is said to oe
the longest public d(tocutnent eve"r sentit
by the Executive to Congress. As the t
tir'st issuing tronl a )Dentoclratic Preri
dent in noi-e tihall a qua;lrter of a ce- I
tury, it has been awaited with tmhe
greatest public itelrest, allnd lnotwith
standing its g'reat hlength, will be lead
by more people th.tn Iiiuali~y wander
flhroutgh these presidential utterances.
Manh y new views have been expected I
in iM'r. Clevwland's inelsage, maniy ut- I
terances quite didifetrt liton those of I
hisi. predcet'sors. lie has had hitherto

iiefolre tihe preaut Coligless, and on all
thlese poiltta Mr. Clevclatla hIas In I
opinion and does not hesitate to ex

'iThe mtessage conmmences with a very
iproper allusion to tile death of Vice I

on the foreign relatliosl of the Un ited

it. Clevi-land has much: to say on1
thie Inlathiuuis qjuealo, atid we refer I
eilsewht.e to hit views, and partict

.Mr. C:leve'l-id is equnally empllhatic
on tlte siulject of entatlgiing allianlcen.
lie doet ilot want to get us involved
witlh oth gove o rlinentd on acollllt t of i
any Ibtiloua route ; and hle sitilarlv
rilio·eu Iso joit in the foundtation o1 tite
tioiol t' teie ltatee, although lie stirnigly
altirti ve at the alttempl t to develop the
Coult~hru-ce of tile interior of Africa.
utin e lt- lilltese qitentioi1 Mr. Cleve- I
land lecogaises the righlt of this guv.
crunitnt to prevent tne imliratioo 1
ot Chinese into the United States, and
calls attention to the fact that Canada
anId ot her countries are adipting the
samine policy. The legislation on this
s:libijct has not been suntllcient, lie
thinks, to fully acctlomplish the end
le-iitdi ; and lie suggests the advisa
bility of still furtlher legislation to pre
vt-unt the illort 'it)on of the Chinese.
I!t while favoring this, lie speaks in
tihe b`evlest denunciation of the out
ir;ges tolAnilitted oil the inffensive
Cinuamen in WVyonin g and Washing
ton Tl'eiritories, which, hlie declares,
were not perpetrated by Aunercau
citizens, but ly foreigners, competing
with the Moigoilians, and lie piomises
all the assistance in his pouer to pre
ventt renewals of these outrages and
imunishi those who were guilty of them.
11ie speaks at length of the fraternal
relations existing between this repub
lic and Mexico, and the part that
American capital and energy have
pla; ed in tiie development of their
ctuliintry. Anld he recommends that
Congriess pass the legislation necessary
to carry into eflet the conuleicial
treaties with Mexico adopted by the
Senate.
Ainluig other imatters of the Depart
lUllet of State lie touches on are the
I.ecessityv of a new extradition treaty
with EL;ianid, the appoinitment of a
fish commllissioner to couftr with the
Cauadiatn govternllneiut as to lisingig in
Canadian waters, the estab!ishmneut of
a boullndaIry line between Alaska and
the United States, the French spolia
tion claiins, the French ordinance
against the i wn aortation of pork, and
the treaty with Corea, etc.
There are lno very strikinug points in
his reference to the Laud. Patent and
l'cnsion ollices. He approves the sug
gtstiol, of Secretary Lamar in refer
ence to the repeal and modilication of
ceitaiU of our laud laws, anud proposes
to call the railroads to account for thy~
honest administration of the large land
grants made themi for the purpose of
buihting their lines.
Oni the subject of the Mormons, how
ever, his message is vigorous and em
phatic, more so thian that of any of his
predecessors, and he pot only declares
that polygamy and the opposition to
the laws of the country must be crush
ed, but points out how\ this can be
doune. The Utah ColInUission has ac
coilmplished nmuch good, lie says, and
plural tiarriages are becoming very
y intrequent in Utah, 3et the country
still remailins in the hinudis of the Mor
moils, sustaiiniiig byV their votes a belief
g wilcl sets at lnught the law of the
land. There must be no relaxation in
tihe form,ni but just execution of the law
e against polygamy; and he promises to
Sapprove anid further discreet legisla
tion, such as will rid this country of
I, the blot on its name. III this connec
Lo tion the President approves a propo
it sitiou made first by the Times-Demo
le crat, and always warmly urged by this
paper, and recounelllleds that Congress
, pass a law preventing the importation
e of Mortuolls into thllis country. This
_ we certainly have as much a right to
d do as to prohibit the importation of
r crimiunals and paupers.
. 'The President wants to extend the
d influence and operations of the De
t_ partmnut of Agriculture, and would
f' have it teach progressive farming, the I
u value and usefulnless of new seeds and
is plants, and distrlitute such as are cul
Ua tatable and protitable among our
, farmte s.
S oni the Indian questions, again hie
S reconumenduatious are eminently wise
and lull3 in accord with the views
,e urged by the 'Timies-Democrat in this
11 matter. lie believes that the govern
n meant, instead of leaving the Indians
alone, should attempt to civilize and
iiilprove them, but as the conditions
y amoig the difltirent tribes vary great
ely, he would not have a uniform rule
htbrf all; but suggests a special coumie
d sion to visit the various reservationus,
investigate the Indians resident on
e them, and suggest what is necessary to
y improve their conudition and to civilize
. them. lie recommends that many of I
d the Indian reservations being much
g too; lare, should be cut down and the
d superluous land sold.
t in respect t the Deplartment of Jus- I
ut tice, his ouly suggestious are tile pay
e unit of tlte United States marshals and
d. istrict attorneuys a tixed salary in
d stead of one dependent on their fees;
t ind an elltlargeienellt of the jurisdiction
r- of Uuited $tat-s commissioners, so its
o to relieve thle district courts oi mauy
e petty cases.
It 'The subject of civil service, whichl
n Mr. Cleveland ihaes made one of the
is ceutral ligures of his policy, hias evi
sI deutly received his most careful atten
y tion and counsideration, lie declares
n that hlie inteuds to continue tlhe eutnorce
ment of tihe civil service reform
t throughout his adminuistration, lie
r believes that experience will suggest
i- ameidtuents to the present law on this
: Iubject, out hlop-s that "we will never
l again be remitted to thle system which
n distribtedt public.positions as rewards
- for partisan services." Hs remarkson
Sthis subject are quite lengthly, and atre
d evilently ueant as a defense of his
policy againist party complaint.
c Mr. ClevelaIud practically indorses
. tbe tariff plank of the Clhicago con
l ventiun, whicha was deemed satislac
if tory to the business and manuthetur
I ing interests of tihe country, ani there
ie s, coutsequ:etly, nothing to lear on
Sthe sulbject.
e Most of the President's recomioenda
tions arc good, and will indoubtedly
. receive the support of Congress and
. the public ; others, like the silver por- I
t ton of hris messamge, will, on the other
hand, give rise to much discussion and
debate, and to a very ardent contest
in Cougress.
The most striking omission in the
message is the failure of the President
to reeolnmmend or to refer in any way I1
to the imilovement of the Mississippi -
and \Vestern waterways. The whole cl
Mississippi Valley will notice with re
gret this failure to Iurge what is one of tl
the most importallt Imatters afCiecting I
thie national comnuerle of this country. Ih
Altogether, the mmessage is an nale ce
State paper, presenting all the chtef a
topics of national immportance to Con
gres. and the country with striking ti
and well put suggestions and recoum
mendations. ti

At the instance and by the ex- p
ertions of Congressman Blanchard In
a new postal route has been estab- m
lished through Grant parish, from p
Colfax to Big Creek. The mail e
will go and come once a week. ,
Three intermediate post offices '
have been established, namely,
Solar, Oction and Shaw. If Mr. r
Blanchard will now interest him
self to have the 15-mile gap, from
Iatt to Winnfield, closed up in the r
Alexandria and Winnfield route, n
Grant parish will have a tolerably p
.completo postal service, and our °
people will be under lasting obli- a
gations to him. Up to about a
eighteen months ago the mail went f
all the way through, when sudden- a
ly it was bobbed off at Iatt, and C
ever since a large number of people
have suffered for lack of necessary c
mail facilities. t
Old Reliables are still selling their a
large stock of clothing at low tignres. f
Don't forget McKnight & McNeely v
when you want a nice suit or overcoat. n
Senator John Sherman, the' bit
torest and most uncompromising I
enemy of the South, has been a
elected president of the U. S. Sen
ate. It was first offered to Logan, j
who declined, thereby evidencing
a trait of manliness of which Sher- t
man seems to be totally devoid. a
The first thing in order with Con- e
gress is to provide for the Presi- t
dential succession, so that the will t
of the people as expressed by bal- c
lot shall be carried out, and not ti
thwarted, as may now be done by }
a member of the defeated party o
getting hold of the governmental t
reins.
The Colfax CRnorcLna says that Mc
Knight and McNeely will have plenty e
of white sugar on hand for the holidays. '.
A little of something else, well stirred up, to
with a few drops of water, would sell well F
in Colfax about Christmas times.-Alex- se
andria Town Talk. d
Come up HIInie, you and Mac, and
we will hunt around for a "little of
something else" to put in your t
sugar and water. It is a little ,
troublesome to get hold of it, but p
we live in a temperance parish and
know how dry you must feel, and
will go to extra expense to accom- n
modate you.

If 'oant of sorts' with headache,
stoumach disorder, torpid liver, pain in
back or side. constipatiom, etc., neg
lect may be fatal. One dose of Strong's
Saanative Pills will give relief. A few
dosesa restore to new health and vigor.

[Our Exposition Correspondence.)
Nzw OaZxaNs, Novembr 0,. 188.
The Republic of Guatemala, the
largest of the Central American States
-with regular and frequent steamship
communications with our own coud
try-has doubled for this Exposition
the list of articles which attracted so
mnch well deserved attention at the
last. I examined this new exhibit
carefully a few days ago, and present
a summary.
For American furniture manufac
turers, dyers, and cabinet makers,
there are 241 samples of vat nish woods,
that is, already sawed atud varnished;
and 2r'3 samples not varnished. .Most
of their names are Spanish or Indian ;
but among them are some in English,
viz: guava, laurel, lignum vitne, watlnut,
willow, evergreen oak, orange, spruce,
mahogany, oak, mulberry, ebony, ap
ples, tamarind, copal, cedar, cinnamon,
medlar, black oak, coco a, plum, red
mulberry, cher'y, olive, cork, almond,
white walnut, capsicum, white ebony,
pomegranate, logwood, lemon. chainco
na, peach, chestnut, black thorn, apri
cot, calabash) quince, cypress, lance,
vegetable wax, blood red, myrtle.
There ale lO3 samples, besides, of
round trees, not sawed, with bark on.
The printed catalogue of these not yet
received.
There are abundant and choice sam
ples of the cocoa bean, coffee, Indian
corn. wheat and flour. barley, rice and
rice flour, beans, peas, spices, sugars,
nmolases, cotton, wool, tobacco in leaf
and cigars, etc. Coffee is the leading
iprHluct·in. Sugar comes next. One
of the samples of cotton is "wild;"
another is "yellow," the thread of
which makes '"butternut" garments,
without the use of dyes. The mann
facturels' hand work is represented by
