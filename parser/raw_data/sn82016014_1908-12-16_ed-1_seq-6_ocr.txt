THE SECRET SERVICE.
Aldrich Resolution to Investigate
Passed Senate Today.
"Washington, Dec. 16. Senator Al
drich today introduced a resolution
directing the committee on appropria
tions to consider the portion of the
president's annual message dealing
with the secret service.
The resolution calls, upon the com
mittee to make a thorough inquiry in
to the subject by a subcommittee or
otherwise. The committee is given
authority to sft during the recess of
congress and to swear witnesses.
Senator Culberson said. he had no
objection to the resolution, but said it
was not positive enough in its terms
and offered a substitute which was
read to the senate. Mr. Aldrich
thought the substitute covered the
same ground aa his own. The two
resolutions were referred to the com
mittee to audit and control the con
tingent expenses of the senate and Mr.
Kean, chairman of that committee, at
once reported back favorably the W&
rich resolution.
Mr. Kean also asked that his com
mittee be discharged from the further
consideration of the Culberson resolu
tion and moved that action be taken
at once on the Aldrich resolution.
Mr. Culberson objected and under
the rules of the senate the resolution
can not be taken up until tomorrow.
Compromise Agreed On.
Washington, Dec. 16. After the
Aldrich and Culberson resolutions re
garding the references to the secret
service in the president's message had
been before the senate a brief time
today. Republican and Democratic
leaders got together and agreed upon a
compromise.
The compromise provides for the
adoption of the Aldrich resolution
with the addition of the provision in
the Culberson resolution requiring the
appropriations committee to report
'what action, if any, the senate should
take with reference to the message."
Senator Crane, from the committee
on contingent expenses, reported this
resolution to the senate at 2:20 p. m.,
and there was every prospect that it
would be adopted.
Adopted Without Revision.
Washington. Dec. 16. The senate
adopted without revision the Aldrich
resolution with a clause from the Cul
berson resolution added to it.

HIS EXPERIENCE. '
INSPIRATION MINES.
The Sale of the Property Attracts Wide
Attention.
The Los Angeles Examiner of Decem
ber 3, says:
"Mining operations in the Globe dis
trict promise to show unprecedented ac
tivity during the next few months, deals
amounting to J6,000,000 having been con
summated within a week. ! Of especial
moment to local people Is the sale of
the controlling interest In the Inspira
tion property to George E. Gunn of Salt
Lake City, and his Boston associates.
"There are in the neighborhood of 100
persons in Los Angeles who own from
1,000 to 15,000 shares of stock In the In
spiration company. Among them are
A. JUverett Wiley, Alonzo Bailey, West
Myers, Thomas and John Pascoe.
. "By the terms of the agreement one
million dollars is to be paid into the
treasury or the company, to be used
for development purposes, the first pay
ment of $250,000 to be made within the
next ten days. Mr. Gunn and his asso
ciates are also to have an ontion on
300,000 shares of treasury stock at $10
par, which if exercised will give the
reorganized company $3,000,000 addition
al, ample to provide the most complete
equipment and -reduction works of a
large capacity.".
In connection with the above, W. (A.
Neiswanger states: "The board of di
rectors met in an informal manner Mr.
Wm. B. Thompson of New York and
Mr. Geo. E. Gunn of Salt Lake City
and their attorney, Mr. Ayer of New
York, last Saturday in Kansas City and
the Impression was created that the
Inspiration stockholders are tying up
with conservative, honest and capable
business men and that the terms of the
contract will be carried out. The pro
position is meeting with the unanimous
approval of the stockholders and it is
believed that proxies necessary to ap
prove the transaction have already
been received by the secretary."
DECLARATION OF WAR.
Made Today by Chief Eaton on Autos
Without Legible Numbers.
Chief of Police Eaton has begun an
active campaign upon automobile driv
ers who disfigure or allow their num
bers .to. remain mud bespattered. City
ordinance No. 2623, section 414 of the
chapter on automobile regulation pro
vides that it shall be unlawful for any
person to propel or run, or cause to be
propeled or run, any automobile upon
any of the streets, or alleys, or thor
oughfares of the city of Topeka without
hanging at the rear thereof the regis
tered number of the automobile in such
"manner as to be readily seen and read
from the rear. Many of the machines
about town are carrying numbers bent
nearly double, twisted or splashed with
mud and grease until they are scarcely
readable.
Two drivers have been arrested al
ready today for violation of the pro
vision. C. B. Metty, a machinist at the
Cowdrey garage was running a machine
without any number whatever. M. V.
Klstler was carrying a disfigured num
ber. . Too much leniency has been ex
tended heretofore and many speeders
have escaped with unread numbers.
Now, however, not only the speed but
the condition of the number on the
machine is of equal interest to the po
lice. .

REPLY OF NEWS.
Indianapolis Paper Answers President
. on Panama Matter.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 16. The In
dianapolis News, mentioned in the spe
cial message on the Panama canal deal
sent to congress yesterday by Presi
dent Roosevelt, today issued a reply to
the chief executive. It says:
"It is difficult to characterize fully,
the latest outbreak of the president,
without resorting to the use of lan
guage as undignified and blameworthy
as that which put the president's ut
terance in a class by itself in the offi
cial literature of the high office he
holds. . Whatever provocation Mr.
Roosevelt may have felt pricking his
soul, nothing could justify or much
extenuate the torrent of invective and
virulence which he poured out in a
state paper upon the heads of private
citizens. No one in his sober senses
can fail .to regard the performance as
a grave derogation to the dignity of
the presidential station, a piliable ex
hibition of lowering rage on the part
of the chief magistrate and the source
of humiliation and chagrin to the en
tire country. It is quite Impossible to
think any- of Mr. Roosevelt's long line
of distinguished predecessors that
could possibly have so forgotten the
dignities and the decencies of his ex
alied position as to transmit to con
gress a message in any way compara
ble with that of yesterday.
"Denunciation and bitterness of speech
are no explanation and no answer. As
sumption that the New York World
and tts proprietor were Influenced tiy
base or unworthy motives in the pub
lication of the reports touching the
Panama affair can not be justified, no
matter who may be the person that
makes it."
The News states that the World un
doubtedly has what it honestly consid
ered sufficient grounds for believing
that everything had not been as it
should have been in the acquisition by
this country of the Panama canal In
terest "from their former owners al
though a paper may be deceived.
The News states that whether Mr.
Roosevelt knows it or not rumors and
reports touching the Panama transac
tion have been numerous ahd persistent
and that in spite of all his asservations
people are not convinced that every
thing is as it should have been. This
without in the least impugning the
good faith of the president or his agents
in the negotiations. The News said
many points have not been cleared up
and they can not be cleared up by
threats of libel suits ana pen lasmngs
of editors that hold the good name and
the interests of the country quite as
dear as does the president.
The paper in concluding says the
Rainey resolution should be adopted
and that congress should make a
searching investigation of all the facts,
circumstances and rumors connected
with the Panama activities of the gov
ernment, i ,-
