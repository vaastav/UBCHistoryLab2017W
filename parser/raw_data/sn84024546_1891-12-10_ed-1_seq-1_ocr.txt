rerZCIAl, TELEGRAPHIC LETTER.!
Bureau or The Dispatch, )
Washington, D. C., Dec 8. $
Xeither House of Congress performed
any public duty to-day beyond the very
perfunctory one of listening to the reading
of the President's annual message. This
was not perhaps very important business,
but its transaction required considerable
time. The President does not send many
messages to Congress in the course of a
year, but judging from the inattention dis
played at its reception to-day, Presidental
message reading would seem to be an event
of very ordinary occurrence.
In the Senate the document was read by
Secretary McCook, who rarely gives the
Senators the pleasure of listening to his
voice, which is a much better one for elocu
tionary purposes than any of his assistants
and that is not saying too much. For the
first hour of the reading the Republican
Senators, as a matter of formal courtesy,
remained in their seats, and nearly all of
them paid attention to what General Mc
Cook was saying.
Senators Too Listless to Listen.
Several of the able Senators, however,
were too preoccupied or too listless to listen
to the reading. Among these were Sena
tors Plumb and Dawes, who read the morn
ing papers; Wolcott and Manderson, who
lay hack in their chairs and told funny
stories; Dolph, who wrote letters, and
J'o- who performed the cry reuiallie ,
set, for him, of burying his head in his
arms on top of his desk and losing himself I
in slumber or thought.
Senator Cameron talked to his clerk for
an hour, and Senator Proctor follow ed the
reading of the message with a wise look of
proprietorship, epecially when the por
tion relating to the "War Department was
reached. The other Senators main
tained their dimity, but looked frightfully
bored, ai they probably were.
Senatorial courtesy does not require that
the Democrats in the Chamber pay polite
attention to the reading of President's
messages, and so it was that Senators Vest
and Pasco were the only Senators on the
Democratic side who appeared to be listen
ing to anything the message contained.
Not Half the Democrats Present.
Less than one-half of the Democrats were
present in the Chamber Mr. Gorman, who
is the recognized leader of his party on the
fioor, sat in his central seat, conferring with
members of the House and others who came
to talk with him. Senator George, the
creat constitutional lawyer, turned his
back squarely on Secretary McCook, pos
bly without any intention of slighting
either the Secretary or the President, and
read a newspaper during the entire dreary
two hours that were consumed in the read
ing. In the House it is not the custom to listen
to the reading of President's messages, and
so while the big-lunged clerks of that un
wieldy body were plowing throuch their
elocutionary exercises the 330 odd members
chatted and laughed, wrote letters and read
papers without restraint, and there were
not a score of the entire number who
heard more than a paragraph or two of the
3C printed pages upon which the President
had bestowed such great care and labor.
A Great La& of Ilero A orship.
It was thought that, as most of the mem
bers are new to Congressional life, they
would be impressed with their own import
ance, as well as that of the President, and
would indicate their feelings by giving pro
found attention to his words of wisdom.
They did nothing of the kind, however.
They seem to have been impressed thus
early with a professional lack of hero wor
ship, and they went about getting ac
quainted with each other and finding out
what their perquisits are in the way of
patronage and documents without heeding
what the President had to say about the
Chilean question, the gerrymandering of
the Congress and legislative districts, and
the other important matters to which he
alludes.
The general public seemed to be as un
mindful of the courtey due to the Presi
dent as the Senators and Representatives
are. The was merely a handful of specta
tors in the galleries of each House, and in
the brown seats ol the diplomatic corps in
the Senate chamber there were five attaches
of various legations, who seemed to be very
much surprised at the cool treatment which
the President's recommendations met with
at the hands of the Statesmen.
The Usual Interviews Fnrnlshed.
Each Houe adjourned as soon as
the last word of the President's recommen-
tions had been delivered to them, and at
once proceeded to bo interviewed in reply
to the question which comes to them year
after year; " 'What do you think of the
medge.'" The Republicans, especially
those who had noHieard a word of it, said
that it was a strong document, and some of
the Democrats said so, too, epecially Sena
tor Morcan, whom Mr. Harrison had quoted
a friend, with him, of the Xicaraguan
Canal Company.
Contrary to all precedents of Congress for

perhaps half a century,the official estimates
of the Treasury Department for the ensuing
year have not yet been presented, although
two days have elapsed since the opening
day. Usually the estimates are prepared
by the various heads of departments and
bureaus, digested and printed in the Treas
ury, and sent to Congress in book form
promptly on the first day of the session.
This year, however.the delay is remarkable,
giving rise to wondering comment among
many Congressmen familiar with the his
toric" custom governing the matter, and
prompting the natural surmise that some
thing serious must be the matter with the
administration.
Speaker Crisp's Present Ardnons Task.
It is the general opinion about the Cap
itol that Speaker CriEp will not be able to
announce his committee assignments for at
least two weeks. He has a very large task
on hand, and one that must be delicately
handled. The pressure upon him is some
thing awful, but it is said for him by those
who speak with authoritv, that, notwith
standing the bitterness and closenessof the
fight which resulted in his nomination, he
nas made no promises whatever that can
arise to his embarrassment now.
Indeed, the Speaker regards his task as a
less formidable one than some of his friends,
and thinks he mav conclude it within ten
days. It is not likely, however, that his
hope will be realized In the Fiftieth Con
gress there was such a preponderance of
Democrats from the South that they neces
sarily monopolized a large share of the im
portant committee places. The situation
being so changed now, a general shakeup
will be necessarv. wherein precedents can
not be followed v ery strictlv.
It will be necessary for the new Speaker
to give substantial recognition to membeis
from the East and West, where he received
such strong support, and he will be obliged,
therefore, to ignore somewhat the long
established custom of yielding everything
to seniority of service. Seniority, in fact,
will not cut such a strong figure in Mr.
Crisp's assignments as ability.
Gsing to Work for a Kecord.
It is the intention of the leaders of the
House to make a record that will stand out
in strong and creditable contrast to that of
the "billion-dollar" Congress. To this end
all possible safeguards will be thrown about
legislation looking to the appropriation of
money, and it is thought that Judge Hol-
man will be the most likely candidate to go
back to his old place at the head of the
Committee of Appropriations.
Judge Forney, of Alabama, who hasbeen
many vears a Congressman and many years
a member of this important committee, will
not, it is said, seek its chairmanship on ac
count of his advanced age and on account of
his disability to perform the arduous duties
of the place.
Whether Mr. Mills is to be Chairman of
the Committee on Ways and Means again,
or not, is a question that cannot as vet be
definitely answered. Undoubtedly, Mr.
Crisp will offer the place to his defeated
competitor for the speakership, but if he
does not accept the place it w ill go to some
pronounced tariff reformer.
Messrs. McMilien, Springer, Hatch, and
the men who so gallantly managed Crisp's
fight, will not be forgotton, although the
Speaker will not give all the places to his
friends, but remain true to the promise
made when assuming the chair,tobe strictly
impartial in the conduct of his office.
MILLS A SUFFERER.
THE DEFEATED CANDIDATE KNOCK
ED OUT ALL AKOCND.
Physically and Mentally He Is Under the
Weather IIls,PIans for the Fntnre In

V
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. Special
Representative Mills is suffring from the
reaction, of the terrible strain of the last lew
days thai resulted in his defeat for the
speakership nomination. He has been be
sieged with inquiries about his future
course, but is not in a mood at present to
take the public into his confidence.
Mr. Mills is physically and mentally a
sufferer, and does not wish to make public
his intentions with regard to his future
political course until he has had time to
think over the situation. The fact that h
was Kulky, yesterda-, and refused to ac
company "the House Committee to wait
upon the President, and the further fact
that he purposely selected a seat in an out-of-the-way
part of the hall, has led to the
report that he intends to accept his defeat
as an announcement that his policy is no
longer to be thrust upon the Democratic
party in the House, and to keep himself in
the background accordingly.
Sir. Mills' Opinion of Liars.
In answer to this reiiort, Mr. Mills de
clines to talk, but contents himself to say
sarcastically that lying seems to be indulged
in by certain persons. The deleated candi
date" for Speaker feels very sore not en
tirely perhaps because of the defeat of his
personal ambition to sit in the Speaker's
chair, but because he is inclined to regard
the election of Mr. Crisp as a significant
rebuke to the policy of which he has been a
conspicuous advocate for many years.
Mr. Mil's, however, is a very impetuous
man, apt to do things on impulse and after
ward regret his actions. It was this char
acteristic which led him to say last spring
that he desired to go to the Senate from
Texas, and consequently w ould not be a
candidate for the Speakership. Had he not
made this unnecessary remark he m;ght
have fared better in the fight that closed
last Monday evening.
Other Texans in the Same Boat.
Whether Mr. Mills could now come to the
Senate if he so desired is a question which
no one in Washington seems able to answer.
Senator Chilton was on Monday sworn in to
fill the unexpired term of Senator Reagan,
which will expire in 1893, and who will be
a candidate for re-election, and there are
other Texas gentlemen who will display a
like ambition.
Mr. Mills was not a supporter of Chilton
for the place, and it is possible that he
might not be able to overcome the opposi
tion of his rivals. The Senatorship will be
vacant on the day that his present term in
the House expires, and the result of next
year's elections may have a controlling in
fluence upon his future action.
ONE MEMBER TOO MANY.
A DEMOCRAT WHOM THE HOUSE MA
JOKITY WOULDN'T MISS.
An Irrepressible Young Man From Masa
chusetts Amazing Effontry of Sherman
Hoar Trying to Do It AH Himself-How
He Hart Mills' Campaign.
Washington, D. C, Dec 9. Special
There is one Democrat in the House
whom the party managers would cheerfully
unload, considering that they can spare
some members without impairing the effi
ciency of this majority. The Democrat re
ferred to is Sherman Hoar, of Massachusetts,
an irrepressible young man who threatens
to flood the country with manifestoes con
cerning what he will do and why he will"
do it From appearances he is filled with
the idea that the whole responsibility for
legislation in the House is upon his shoul
ders, and he would like it known that he
has taken up the burden. His explanation
of why he did not vote lor Crisp for Speaker
disgusted the old Democratic war horses,
while it tickled the Republicans, and they
are encouraging him to go ahead and do it
some more.
Young Hoar's effrontery is amazing, and
thoe who watched the proeress of the
Speakership content got a full iew of it.
His first pronouueiamento was that Mills
must be elected. This was forwarded from
Massachusetts. The unterrified young
statesman followed up his formal declara
tion by coming to Washington to personally
assist the Texas candidate. With his col
league, Williams, he planted himself down
in Mr. Mills headquarters and proceeded to
impair that gentleman's chances of success
by undertaking to elect him with very little
assistance from Mr. Mills' other advisers.
Hoar was rarely absent. He watched like
a hawk for arriving members, and poured
into their ears "the logic of the situation"
before the visitors had even time to pay
their respects to the candidate. In the
same room, perhaps, would be men of
national standing, like Breckinridge, of
Kentucky; Wilson, of West Virginia; ex
Speaker Carlisle and William R. Morrison,
but the Yankee youth desired to do all the
converting, and these older and more dis
tinguished friends of the candidate had to
take back seats in his presence.
In the House he has now started off on
the same lofty mission of doing it all him
self, and he promises to be an amusing
figure for the next two years unless he
learns something in the meantime. The
apology for Mr. Hoar is that he "has the
worthy ambition to show the country that
Xew England has produced a Democrat
with as much, if not more, force and
ability as ex-Speaker Reed.
SEVEN WONDERFUL CURES.
EXCITEMENT AMONG FAITH HEALERS
IN MASSACHUSETTS.
End or a Remarkable Series of Meeting in
a Mission Church Tho Blind Made to
See Incurable Diseases Cease to Bo
Such A Koxbury Molllnger.
Boston, Dec. 9. Special There have
been some remarkable faith cures at the
Triduum held in the Mission Church, Rox
bury, for the past three days, in honor of
Our Lady of Perpetual Help. At least
seven persons who were afflicted with dis
eases that had been pronounced incurable
were miraculously cured at the shrine of
the Blessed Virgin.
More than 20,000 people from all parts of
the Hew England States visited the church
yesterday, and it is estimated that fully
6,000 thronged the sacred edifice at the clos
ing services which took place last evening.
It was a memorable day, and the events
enacted before the shrine of the Blessed
Virgin when Rev. William O'Connor, C. S.
S. R., gave the blessing for the sick will
never be forgotten.
Scarcely had the reverend father breathed
the benediction when the greatest excite
ment prevailed, caused by the fact that
seven people who had been afflicted with
incurable diseases were instantaneously
cured. One little girl, aeed about 15, and
living in South Boston, recovered her sight
after being blind for many years. Her
name is Annie Sullivan. Another miracu
lous cure was that of Mrs. Abbie Cooney,
of Brockton, who hail been afflicted with
paralysis for seven years.
The whole parish "is agitated over the oc
currence, and the strangers who were pres
ent at the time were awe 6truck. Rev.
Father Mavrick, a S. S. R., rector of St.
Alphonsus' Church, New York, was the
orator on this memorable occasion, and con
ducted the Triduum throughout.
LOST LEG AND LOVER.
A Handsome Society Woman of B nlT.il o
Suing a Doctor for Malpractice She
Blames Him for Her Incarceration in an
Insane Asylum Her Marriage Ofl".
BUFFALO, Des. 9. Special. An inter
esting trial was begun here to-day, in the
Supltme Ctfurt; TiSfore Judge Daniels.
Mrs. Dr. Kimball, a society woman, is
suing Dr. Charles Cary, an instructor in the
Buffalo Medical College, for malpractice.
She claims she brokj her leg about two
years aso, and that Dr. Cary, who treated
her, made her a cripple for life and caused
her to go insane, necessitating her confine
ment in the Buffalo Insane Asylum.
She claims, too, that this was the cause of
her losing a lover and spoiling her engage
ment. Just for amusement she corres
ponded witli a number of men on the sub
ject of matrimony, and among the rest was
Charles Edward Pierce, of New York. In
a loving letter he offered himself in mar
riage, and she had neither rejected nor ac
cepted his suit when she was carried away
to the asylum. It was a critical time in
this little afiair of her heart when the rough
men marshaled by Dr. Cary came for her
with a stretcher and ambulanced her away
to the society of lunatics, and it broke up
the whole matter.
This proposition of marriage was the
topic uppermost in her mind, and it was
natural that under the influence of pain
and opiates she should have talked deleri
ouslv about it So she blames Dr. Cary for
the ioss of a very promising husband, as
well as for the uncured injury to her hip
and loathsome incarceration in the insane
asylum.
Mrs. Kimball is a good-looking woman
about 50 years old, She was carried into
the courtroom by two men this forenoon.
She can step on only one foot. Dr. Sylves
ter, a young New York physician, testified
at the "trial this afternoon.
GONE TO SEE HEB GRANDPA.
Sudden Call of a Little Child or a Greatly
Afflicted Family.
Lancastek, Pa., Dec 9. Special
Farmer J. L. Hess' daughter died of diph
theria at his home near here this morning.
About a week ago another child died, while
Mr. and Mrs. Hess were praying for her re
covery from diphtheria, having neglected to
summon a physician.
Last evening the second victim of the
disease, seemingly convalescent, came down
stairs and said: "Mmma, I want a nice
bath, for I'm going to see grandpa." The
child's grandfather has been dead for sev
eral years. She grew worse last night and
died this morning.
ECHMEKTZ'S EASTERN CREDITORS
Hold a Sleeting in Boston to Find Out if
They Can Get Anything.
A meeting of the Eastern creditors of R.
C. Schmertz, of Pittsburg, was held in Bos
ton yesterday. At the time of the failure
Mr. Schmertz confessed judgments to large
amounts in favor of creditors, and if these
judgments arc paid the assets will be ex
hausted and nothing left for the other
creditors.
The meeting added three creditors to an
investigating committee already appointed,
and the committee was instructed to ascer
tain whether or not they will contribute a
pro rata assessment not to exceed 1 per
cent of their claims to make up a sum to be
expended in the interest of the creditors.

EVIDENCE AGAINST CHINESE EEBELS
London, Dec. 9. "When the hearing in
the St. John divorce case was resumed this
morning, the usual crew of actors and ac
tresses was present. The principals in the
case were early in their seats. The one
day's rest afforded Mi6s St. John by the ad
journment of the court from Monday to
"Wednesday had had a good effect upon her,
and had allowed her to recover in a meas
ure from the strain of the cross-examination
she had undergone at the hands of Mr
Gill, who had displayed no hesitancy in
dragging from her every detail of her life
that would show her in a bad light before
the jury.
Miss St. John to-day, as usual, was very
handsomely and becomingly dressed. "When
her side of the case was closed Mr. Gill
made his address in behalf of Mr. Marius.
Mr. Marius, through his counsel,had already
admitted the charge made against him, but
claims that this violation of his marriage
vows was not until a year after his wife had
left him. r
A Deposition to Prove His Gnilt.
The first evidence submitted on the open
ing of the court to-day was a deposition
made by the actress, Nita St. George. This
was read to the Court and jury with the ob
ject of proving that Mr. Marius had com
mitted the statutory offense before the final
separation occurred between Miss St. John
and himself. The deposition waV read
the court and jury by" Sir Charles Russell,
who represents Miss St John. ,
Among other things, Miss St. George, in
her deposition, stated that Marius was in
the habit of visiting the actress, Marie
Luella, in her boudoir and at the Avenue
Theater. Upon one occasion he had told
Miss St George to look after Maria Lucelle,
as she belonged to him.
This concluded the evidence for Miss St
John, and Mr. Gill then addressed the jury
in behalf of Mr. Marius. Mr. Gill de
clared that the court had never been es
tablished to give relief to a woman who
deliberately endeavored to make her hus
band behave in such a manner that she
might find a pretfTft for leaving him.
Mr. ManrWIIad FroTocatioit.
If the responpt had erred it was after
his wife had lethim. She could not Eeek
relief uuder the circumstances. All of the
charges made against Mr. Marius by Miss
St. John, Mr. Gill declared, were of the
most trivial character, and he felt certain
that the jury would never give a verdict
for the petitioner on the evidence she had
submitted.
In dealing with the charges of cruelty
brought against his client,Mr. Gill said that
all the acts which might be construed as
cruel were caused by the unfortunate tem
per of the petitioner. He further said, re
garding the charges of immorality, that it
must be admitted that Mr. Marius, after his
wife had deserted him and after she had
been away from him for more than a year,
had sought sympathy elsewhere. Mr. Gill
declared he would prove that Miss St John
and Arthur Cohen had been together under
circumstances that could only lead to the
conclusion that improper relations existed
between them.
Marios Denies the Crnlety Charges.
Mr. Gill then called Mr. Marius to the
witness box. He denies his wife's charge
that he had never contributed to her sup
port. The witness produced checks for
thousands of pounds which he had given
to tradesmen to meet bills incurred by his
wife. Mr. Marius declared that he was not
a gambler nor a drinking man; neither was
he a man of violent temper. He had
brought Miss St. John home from Monte
Carlo, where she was in the company of
Cohen, and had pawned his jewelry in order
to raise the money to do so. Mr. Marius
was verv emphatic in his assertion that he
is still very fond of his wife. ' The court
then adjourned.
Earl Bussell Demands an Apology.
Truth, Henry Labouchere's paper, says
to-day that Earl Russell has determined not
to allow his wife, Countess Russell, who
failed last week in her attempt to get a ju
dicial separation from him, any money for
her support until she apologizes to him for
the charges she made against him, and
admits that she herself does not believe
them. Countess Russell has commenced a
suit against her husband to recover a por

The French Ministry Determine! That the

Paeis, Dec 9. In the Senate to-day M.
Dide, a Protestant clergyman, interpellated
the Government on the attitude of the
Catholio Bishops. He described the bish
ops as attacking the laws of the
Republic and working to establish
the temporal power of the papacy, and the
priests as evading every obligation of the
concordat It was high time, he added,
that the Government put a stop to such an
archy. M. Goblet advised the Government
to pave the way for the separation of church
and State by legislation, giving further con
trol of public worship.
M. Fallieres, Minister of Justice and
'Public "Worship, replied to the in
terpellation. He said that the Govern
ment favored a policy of appeasement. The
provisions of the concordat were amply suf
ficient to recall the clergy to a sense of the
respect they owe the.Constitution. Should
these provisions prove inadequate, how
ever, the Government would ask Parlia
ment to authorize other measures. Pre
mier De Freycinet said that the
attitude of certain Bisnops was too
insupportable The Government would
never allow it to be said that Pie
lates were not under the authotitr of the
executive in temporal matters. By a vote
of 211 to 70 the Senate adopted an order of
the day, pledging the Government to avail
itself of its rights to compel the clergy to
respect the Republic and to submit to the
laws.

London, Dec 9. The Times to-day pub

Egan and his own telegrams to his own
Government, caused a proposition to be
made that Chile suppress her legation at
"Washington. This proposition was dis
cussed at a meeting of the Finance Commit
tee of the House of Representatives last
nicht in a heated debate.
The Government declined to support the
proposal, and when the matter was put to a
vote those who were in favor of recalling
the Chilean Minister to the United States
and abolishing the Legation at Washington
were defeated. The Government made a
strong fight against the adoption of the
proposal.
NIHILISM IN CHINA.
The Present Trouble There Is Political,
and Not Religious.
London, Dec 10. The Chronicle this
morning publishes a letter from its Shantt
hai correspondent, in which he repeats an
assertion already made that the basis of the
present crisis in the Chinese Empire is
political, not religious. He says:
A revolutionary spirit fills the land. It Is
a species or nihilism. It has seized tho
army, members of the official classes, even
the older families of China and servants in
European houses. The pro-consuls or Gov
ernor Generals hold the situation in tho
hollow of their hands. No revolution is
possible, certainly not a successful one,
without them. Their present interest is
ajralnst rebellion, becanso they llvo by cor
ruption; but if they could be convinced that
a revolution would operate in their favor,
the co-operation of all of them might be
relied on.

STAGE REALISM THAT SHOCKS EVEN
A NEW YORK AUDIENCE.
Bostonlans, Though, Consider It a Triumph
of Naturalism Pictures From Life Pre
sented on the Stage at Palmer's Theater
The Curtain Drops Opportunely.
New Yoke, Dec 9. Special A bold
experiment was made with a drama 'and an
audience, this afternoon, at Palmer's Thea
ter. The purpose was to ascertain the effect
of representing, bluntly and plainly, to an
assemblage of well-mannered people, things
which, if real, those same people would not
have seen or heard voluntarily.
One of the women characters was habit
ually profane. Two of the men cursed
roundly, in outright blasphemy. Several
phrases of maternity and malpractice were
mentioned without reserve The betrayal
of a girl was discussed ireely. A young
mother made preparations to .give nourish
ment to an infant, when the curtain fell in
time to avert a stampede of panic stricken
women from the theater.
The parts of the performance here indi
cated were grossly offensive. Nevertheless,
the play had been acted several times in a
Boston hall, and had received high praise
from literary censors there, as a triumph of
naturalism.
The theme of this work, entitled "Mar
garet Fleming," is that of the social depra
vation which punishes a faithless wife, as
contrasted with the forgiveness ani rein
statement easily obtained by a husband
guilty of infidelity. One law is enough for
man and woman alike, and the piece closes
with the wife's avowal of that doctrine.

tempts Suicide in a Street Car.
Springfield, Mass., Dec 9. Special
Mrs. "War Benjamin, the comely young
wife of a street railway conductor, at

ELKINS' NOMINATION WOULD SETTLE IT
IROX X STAFF COBBKSPOSnEVT.l
"Washington, Dec 9. Now that mem
bers of Congress are here there is a renewed
attempt to get a formal expresy froin
Secretary Blaine in regard to his ro3
respecting the next Republican 'ua -fji
lor tne .Fresiaency. H-J''fc
On one hand, the friends of the ad
lw
tration seem bent upon compelling
Blame to come out and
only whether he is a candidate
whether he would decline a renomination if
it were tendered against his expressed
wishes. There was a story afloat at the
Capitol to-day that the President and Mr.
Blaine had held a conference yesterday, and
that the result of it had been that Mr.
Blaine would now come out with a declina
tion so strong that his nomination would be
out of the question. The basis upon which
this agreement was reached was asserted to
be the appointment of Stephen B. Elkins as
Secretary of "War to succeed Proctor. This
story was asserted with positiveness, but
there was a marked absence of the proof.
Benny Not FnUInc With Blaine.
On the other hand, those who read the
President's message just presented to the
Fifty-second Congress, saw in that docu
ment a feature that would show that the
President and the Secretary of State have
differences of opinion that are not likely to
bring them together so closely as the fore
going story would have them appear. The
message practically ignored the reciprocity
scheme, which is the chief plank in the
Blaine platform. In contrast to this was a
strong indorsement of the McKinley act, a
piece of legislation that Mr. Blaine believes
is particularly valuable in its reciprocity
feature an oninion contrary to that of the
President and the author of the bill.
In the paragraph concerning the entry of
American pork into Germany.the President
says this was due solely to the passage of
the meat inspection bill by the last Con
gress. It was only recently that Mr.Blaine
stated that the action of Germany was
brought about by the fact that beet sugar
is now admitted free into this country, and
used this as an argument in behalf of reci
procity.
Harrison's Coldness for-Reciprocity.
The President has turned the cold
shoulder to reciprocity, and nine men out of
ten who are in favor of Blaine believe that
he belittled it purposely in his message as a
political move. On this account it is not
believed that Mr. Blaine will present the
President with a Christmas gift in the shape
of an irrevocable withdrawal from the
Presidental race.
It may be that Elkins will be named for
Secretary of "War, but the probabilities do
not favor it. If it is not given to ex-Governor
Cheney, of New Hampshire, it will
probably be bestowed upon Assistant Secre
tary Grant, who is now the acting head of
the department
Coupled with the rumor about Secretary
Proctor's successor, the Star to-day indulges
in a prediction, which it says is based upon
"high authority, that Secretary Blaine
will send Mr. Harrison a Christmas present
in the shape of a letter formally announcing
that he will not under any circumstances be
a candidate for the Presidental nomination
next summer at Minneapolis, the inference
being also that he will not accept the nomi
nation if it were tendered him. Senators
and Representatives when asked about the
probability of such action on Mr. Blaine's
part, disagreed so unanimously as to make
their opinions of little value.
Shepard's Paper Prints the Story.
The New York Mall and Express this after
noon published the following from "Wash-,
ington:
Within the last 1i hours Secretary Blalno
and President Harrison have had a most
important conference, and it is stated that
one of the chief topics discussed was the
coming appointment of a Secretary of War.
Mr. Blaine is reported to have told the
President that the appointment of Mr.
Stephen Elkins to tne vacancy would be
most. eminently satisfactory to him, and at
the same time bo a good appointment for
tho country.
In connection with this interview, Mr.
Blaine's friends now say that if Mr. Elkins
gets the War portfolio it will be closely fol
lowed Dy public announcement of Mr.
Blaine of his retirement from the Presi
dental race in 1893.
A Blaine Letter Looked For.
This is confirmed by tho fact that Mr.
Blaine has at last spoken on this subject
In conversation with a friend, within the
last week, he distinctly stated that he was
not now and would not be a candidate for
nomination at Minneapolis next June. This
was the plan Mr. Blaine had adopted in
place of a card, but it is now again made
public, in rumor shape, that just before the
new year Mr. Blaine will issue a letter,
already carefully prepared, giving his
reason for retiring, and strongly declaring
in no uncertain words in favor of Mr. Har
rison. Then, when in reality 1802 is ushered
in, there will be but one candidate before
the Republican party.
Yet there is a feeling airong the Senators
that the man to be selected by the President
for his cabinet is not Mr. Elkins, but ex
Governor Clieney, of New Hampshlie. His
name is still really the only one mentioned
by gossip, but the fact is the President has
not intimated to any one his preference, and
the delay in sending in the name is due to
the fact that the Presidentyhas not yet de
cided on his choice. The recent interviews
may hasten the nomination.

was mad when the warrant was read to him.
In his anger he tore the paper in two, but a
little prompt treatment from the officer
cooled him and he was hustted off to the

MOROANIOWN, Dec 9. Special At
about 12 o'clock last night an unknown per

IW0 MINING COMPANIES SUED
By Stockholders Who Claim They Are LI.
able to Be Frozen Out.
Cleveland, O., Dec 9. Special
Samuel J. Ritchie and others began suit
against the Anglo-American Iron Company
to-day. The capital stock of the company
is 55,000,000, of which 53,100,000 have been
paid in. Judge Stevenson Burke, of Cleve
land, is President The plaintiffs claim to
own 11,000 shares of stock, and allege that
the earnings of the company have not been
sufficient to pay any interest on the invest
ment. They want the company dissolved.
The same parties bring a similar dissolution
suit against the Canadian Conper Company,
with a capital of 2,500,000.
Both of these mining properties are located
in Canada, and are very valuable. The at
torney for the Ritchies states thUt in his
clients' opinion an effort is being made to
depreciate the value of the stock and freeze
them out at a loss. The stock is largely
owned by Judge Burke, ex-Senator Payne
and the plaintiffs. The same partners own
the nickle mines at Sudbury, Ont

YIEWS OF STEEET EAILWAT HAXAGER8
Through the enterprise of the Duquesna
Traction Company residents of Oakland,
Shadyside and the East End will hereafter
enjoy the convenience of night cars. To
night that company ill begin the running
of the cars every half hour between the East
End and Wood street. Notices to that;
effect will be posted in ail their cars this
morning. Two cars will be put on, and, as
they will only run to the corner of Penn
and Center avenues, each car will be able to
make the round trip in less than half an
hour without difficulty.
This information will be welcome news to
a vast number of people. Although the
East End has been for years one of the most
populous districts of the city, and its resi
dents are of a clas3 that would be as likely
to patronize night cars as those of any other
section, it has never enjoyed the con
venience. The demand for the cars has
been repeatedly made, and the advantage
they would be to traction companies by in
creasing the number of residents in thai
section of the city, and thereby the possi
bilities of gain to the company putting them
on, has been frequently stated.
An Advantage to Workers.
Those whose hours of duty keep them at
work until after midnight, as well as those
required to report for duty at 4 or 5 o'clock
in the morning, have been unable to taKe
advantage of the opportunities of acquiring
homes of their own presented in the broad,
undeveloped acres of the Nineteenth,
Twenty-first and Twenty-second wards,
simply because they could not reach their
work in the morning or their homes at
night, as the case might be. The business
man whose engagements were frequently
of such a nature as to make his ability
to "catch the last car" a matter of doubt;
hesitated to move toward the East End for
fear of missing a night at home. The gay
young beaux of eqery part of the city hesi
tated to invite the young ladies of the East
End to parties or the theaters, because1 of
the danger of being compelled to take her
home in a carriage, after a lunch at a down
town cafe, or, if he happened to catch "the
last car," and himself lived in Allegheny
'or the lower part of the city, must contem
plate the necessity of walking home alter
seeing the young lady safely inside her
father's home.
Then many of thearmj of morning news
paper workers have been unable to move ou
ve onjk ti
art ofShg
to get
inio ine clearer air 01 ine eastern part
tne city hecause ot their inability
home when their night's work was done.
The Schedule That Has Been Arranged.
The night cars will run on a regular
schedule. The first car will leave Penn,
avenne. East End, at 12:30 a. m. and come
in to Wood street, leaving the corner of
Fifth avenue on the return trip atl o'clock.
Thereafter on every half hour a car will
leave each of those points until 4:30, when
the last car in will leave East End. The
last night car will leave downtown at S
o'clock. The night cars are to pass each
other near the corner of Craig and Forbes
streets. The last regular day car will leave
Fifth avenne and Wood street at 12:30 A.3L
as at present
The rate of fare on the all-night cars will
be 10 cents, and is not expected to pay ex.
penses even at that The power to run tha
cars will b furnished by a small generatof.
that is used to supply the electric lights for
the company's car barn and power house
This generator will supply power enough
to run four or five cars, if necessary. By
its use the heavier machinery can be al
lowed to rest and cool down each night, and
no extra expense will be incurred except for
the conductors and motormen on each cai
and the wear and tear on the car machinery.
Superintendent George L. McFarlane, in
speaking of the new plan of the company
last night, said: "We have contemplated
this step for several months. We hardly
expect it to pay for awhile at least, as tha
experience of other lines running night
cars has been a losing one, but it will be a
great accommodation to our patrons and
may stimulate people to proving out tolha
East End suburbs. Then we will get theif
patronage on the day cars and in that way
be repaid.
A Feature That Will Help.
"But even if it doesn't pay cash in fares
it will help in the winter months when wa
have a heavy fall of snow to keep C3r$
moving over the road. They will keep tha
rails clear of snow and the ice from gather
ing on the trolley wires, so that we will
have none of the vexatious delays in getting
the road started in the mornings on such oc
casions. The plan is not an experiment,"
concluded Mr. McFarlane, "but will be 4
permanent feature of theDunuesne Traction,
road."
President D. F. Henrv, of the Pleasanl
Valley line, corrobdrated Mr. McFarlaue"9
statement that night cars do not pay even,
when double fares are charged.
"The company that runs on the parsimon
ious principle of. not doing anything for
their patrons unless they see their money
being returned twb-fold,'" said Mr. Henrv,
"will not run all-night cars, for they do no
pav the expenses of the men employed on
them."
