THEODOUI5 ROOSEVELT.
The Whlto House. December 14. 1S0S. j
. Secretary Wright simply submits the ,
report of'llerbert. J. Brov,-no to tho,
president without comment. INLr. ,
Browne makes a general report of tho
case, and thon follows with detailed
statements of those who aided in tho
investigation of tho raid. '
Tost of Browne's Roporfc.
Mr. Browne's' general report is dated
Washington, December 5, and is as fol
lows: Sir I havo the honor to submit tho fol
lowing report relative to the investiga
tion of tho Brownsville raid:
Ex-Private Boyd Convers of company
13, Twonty-flfih Infantry, now at Monroe,
Ga.. told William Lawson. a detective in
tho employ of Captain William G. Bald
win of Roanoke. Va.. that he and three
(or four) other men of the Twenty-ufth
infantry wore tho leaders In tho Browns
ville raid. This information was ob
tained at different dates during the
month of June, 1908.
I- submit the affidavit as presented.
There are certain discrepancies of a minor
character, due to the fact that Lawson
is illiterate and had to depend on hla
memory for details. But it should bo
borne in mind that Lawson was unac
quainted with the details of Uio Browns
ville raid and waa given Information
which could havo come only from one fa
miliar with the Eecrot history of tho af
fair. Lawson's first report included the
names of Convers, John Holloman, John
Brown and "another man." Subsequent
ly ho supplied tho name of James Powell,
but I think tho original name given was
that of Roborti L. Collier, company C, one
of tho relief griard. This information was
corroborated Li tho presence of witnesses,
but before Lawson could finish his work.
Conyers becamo suspicious nnd would
glvo no further evidence incriminating
himself. From then on he furnished to
A. H. Baldwin. Captain W. G. Baldwin
and to myself Information piecemeal and
reluctantly. The namo of Carolina Do
SatiBsure, his bunk mate, was tho last
one obtained.
Attempted Suicide.
Conyers tried to commit sulcldo after
he found that ho had mado his state
ments to a detective, dcclurlng that tho
other negroes would kill him when It got
out. lie finally wrote to Senator Fora
kor and received a reply, a copy of which
is annexed. That reply he construed to
mean that lyj should stick to his orig
inal story told before tho senate commit
tee at all hazards, and there ho stands.
I have every reason to believe that his
confosslon is genuine, ind gives for the
tirst time the true secret history of the
Brownsville raid.
Tho list of participants given in this
report Conyers furnished me personally.
I believe It is substantially correct, but
with the influences shown to be hacking
ojiyorr. to adhere to his false testimony
given before the senate committee still
being exerted he cannot bo veiled on to
support his own confession until It Is
thoroughly sustained from other sources-.
Evidences of similar encouragement to i
ntlrk to the lies told at Brownsville and j
before the senate committee were found
in many places, and subsequent to the I
date, of tho Foraker letter they became
stronger and more obstructive than ever. 1
The Investigation has been conducted !
with strict recognition of the advisability I
of . preserving secrecy, and with discre
tion. Xo promisee of immunity were I
made. The knowledge, on the part of j
isoldlers. thnt the government could j
not punish them after their separation i
from the service, coupled with the pass- i
ngo of the relief legislation now pending
in congress, has added to the difficulty
of securing information. I
Now a Radical Issue.
The issue has evidently become, racial.
These' colored' "detectives would be con
fronted frequently In the smaller towns
where these men are leaving with a de
mand from colored men for Information
as" to their business.
We have located over ISO of these ex
soldiers, and have bc n in thirty states
in quest of Information. The appendices ,
give statements as to the results ob-
tained. They indicate general knowledge i
on the part of ex-soldlers that the raid j
came from inside the fort, and that the !
soldiers of company B were the guilty
parties. ,
We earnestly urge that we be per
mitted to continue the Investigation. Sev
eral detectives are still In the field, and
within the coming week a number of af
fidavits v.'JH be forthcoming;
Story of Conyers.
Boyd Conyers '6 storj is given here
in narrative form:
The rumors of trouble over the assign
ment of -colore troops to Brownsville
were circulated before the troops left for
Fort .N'idbrara. anil preparations wer
made among the men to get even with
the Crackers. " as the whites were called.
Some rartrldges were held out at range
practice, but more en route to Browns
ville. The friction with citizens of Browns
ville hegan at once. In Boyd Conyer's
language-, "whisky, made nil the trouble.
f we hadn't been drinking, we would
not have had the nerve to shot up tlu
town." It was agreed, at a gathering of
a few men In the- saloon of Allison, the
colored ex-soldler. on tho afternoon of
A'ugusl 13, 1006. that the raid should ta.ke
place that night at 12 o'clock. It seems
to havo' been delayed a few minutes to
let Tamayo. the Mexican scavenger, get
away from the B barracKF.
John Holloman. the money lender of
company B. was the chief cons-plrntor and
leader In the raid and custodian and dis
tributor of the cartridges, but his plans
could not have beert carried out hnd not

The number firing from tho barracks Is

one of the witnesses testified to hearing
some one of the groirp of soldiers exclaim,
"Thoro they go! whereupon theso men

Raid Quickly Over.
Less than rive minutes elapsed from tho
time the first shot was fired until theso
men were all back Inside the fort.
Conyera 6tated that Rejd was told that
they were going to shoot up the town,
and he laughed and said: "Don't got out
there and let the Crackers get the best
of you."
When Conyers nnd Dc Saussuro
reached the guard house they ran in the
back way nnd got into their bunks. Ser
geant Rold camo In and swore at them,
but Conyers was so excited and out of
breath that he could hardly stand, so
Reld stationed him nt the rear of tho
guard house In tho dark where ho could
not by scrutinized so closely-
Holloman camo around with extra cart
ridges about daybreak and Reld passed
them out. The guns were all cleaned
before daylight.
William Lawson, being duly sworn, de
poses and says:
"On June 5, 190S, I was sent to Monroe,
Ga.. to interview Boyd Ccmyers, one of
the soldiers who was stationed at
Brownsville, Tex., in August. 190G. I was
sent by Mr. Baldwin to get In with Con
yers and ascertain if he knew who did
the shooting at that point- I was not '
given tho names of any of tho members
of either of the companies stationed at
that point, nor was I given any other In
formation except the fact that a shoot
ing occurred at tho time and place above
montloned and that Boyd Conyers was
suspected of knowing who did' the same.
Securing Confession.
"I arrived at Monroe, Ga.. on June 5,
and stopped at the home of Esther Crews,
colored. I met Boyd Conyers. who Is
known as 'Buddie' Conyers, on the morn
ing of June 6, but had very little con
versation with him. but was Introduced
to him as an old soldier. On the morn
ing of June S. between S and 0 o'clock. I
met Conyers about half way between tho
station house and Main street. We talked
some twenty or twenty-live minutes. I
broached the Brownsville case, nnd men
tioned tho fact that the soldiers had
shown their good sense by keeping their
mouths shut while at Washington. I then
asked him what tho motive was for the
shooting, llf told me that the 'Crackers'
at Brownsville had mado threats that
they would have no negro soldiers at
Brownsville, and tho soldiers had mado
It up In their minds that if they bothered
them they would go In and clean up tho
ground. He also said that they men
tioned this to Sergeant Reld. who was
commander of the guard house, and that
Iteld said, 'All that I have to say is to
Uiku care of yourselves and the boys
when you go down there.' S'. II. Parker,
whose home is at Charleston. S. C, was
present and heard tho samo conversation.
"About then Agent Leman called Con
yers to come and clean some clothes, and
Conyers left, and nothing further wap
said about tho matter at this time. I
was with Conyers nearly every day. and
went to Gainesville. Ga., on an excursion
with him on tho loth of June. 1 did not
mention the Brownsville matter to Con
yers again until the "Dili of June when I
returned from Atlanta, having gone there
on June -7. On this date J met him til
.loe Blasslngame's and. had a. pint bottle
of liquor, offered him a drink ho would
nut drink In the house, but we went up
the street and we slopped under a store
house porch, near Minn street. We took
a drink or two, and I started the
Brownsville c.-iao again. lie told me that
be was doing guard duty at the time of
the shooting at Brownsville, and was sta
tioned ai the outlet toward the town.
Sergeant Implicated.
He said that when the guard was called
the night of tho shooting they mentioned
to Sergeant Reld what had occurred
down town. Ho said, "Boys, If you aro
not satisfied, you will have to go nnd get
satisfied,' and then they remarked that
they were going to get satisfaction that
night. Reld then laughed and said: 'Boys,
don't you go down there and lot them
got the best of you." Ho then assigned
the guard and went away.
"In this conversation, Conyers told me
that John Brown, J. 11. Holloman nnd a
man named Powell and several othec?
came down whoro he was on guurd, and
that they went down town and just gavo
thorn hell, and after they shot out all of
their cartridges they ran back to tho
barracks, and when they got back to the
barracks ihey found that tho alarms had
been sounded and the officers were call
ing the roll. Holloman. Brown and him
telf were late for roll- cull, but somo one
answered for Brown and Ilolloman, but
that he was late and Reld told him that
they had gotten themselves and himself
in a hell's hole, and toll) him to go to tho
guard hoiiMo and pretend to bo asleep,
which he dm.
"Then he told that they had slipped a
few cartridges when at target practice,
and that before Inspection, after the
ahootlng. Rcll gave him some cartridges
to replace the ones ho had shot.
"Pie further said that they had nil
agreed before thoy went out that thev
would keep their mouths shut and ho
would havo told them at tho Investigation
al Washington all about the shooting, but
Hint he was afraid. J naa no further
talk with Conyers. because I now that
I was being suspected by tho negroes
around Monroe. Ga.
"WILLIAM (His X mark) LAWSON'."
Colli fled Statement.
The names of II. J. Browne and
G.eorgo W. Alader, the latter a notary
public, are attached to tho above state
ment as witnesses.
Then follows a deposition, made be
fore another notary, December 0, 190S,
by Mr, Browne, in which tho latter
swears to the truth of the statements
as ful forth in his. report. In this Mr.
Browne, after, mentioniiig haviug htid
several interviews with Couyors, con
cludes: I found Boyd Conyfrs Iti a -disturbed
frame of mind- No claim Is mado that
his original declarations to Wlillam Law
son were other than thone of a criminal
boasting to one of his own race of his
erlme and of his sticcess in escaping dis
covery. His subsequent declarations to
via were given partly during moments of
'outrltion nnd In a desire to unload his
uotMrtSlanoaby a. confession, and partly
as the result of careful and persistent
questioning.
i "I found the effect of the letter from
! Senator Foraker to Conyers extremely
obstructive. He seemed to regard It as
a mandate to adhere to Uio false story
told by him before tho ftenato commlt
I tee on military affairs and as absolving
him from any and all obligations to nld
! In uncovering tho truth. Similar Infiu-
enccs were encountered at many points,
adding largely to the difficulty of ob
taining admission of even tho most ob
vious facts relative to tho raid.
HERBERT J. BROWNE.
Then Mr. Browne gives in much de
tail tho facts already generalized.
"In summary," he says, "there is
ho reliablo direct evidence precluding
a single one of the suspects from having
bocu on' tho raid."
Tho Porakor Lottor.
Tho letter sent by Senator Foraker
to Convers, and spoken of in tho ro
port, follows:
United States Senate. Commlttco on Pa
cific Islands nnd Porto Rico.
Cincinnati, O., Aug... 2, 1006.
Mr. Boyd Conyers, Monroe, Ga-
Dear Sir: On my return here I found
I awaiting mo your letter' of July 21.
I hardly know from what you stato
Just what It la that has transpired, nor
do I know Junt what It is I should do
i to get tho chnractor of information to
which you refer. If you will write me
again at your convenience, giving me a
clearer account,' I will be glad to avail
myself to tho extent that it may" bo
useful.
I remember you very well as a wit
ness before tho commlttco, and I am
sure you did not. there testify to any
thing except only the truth. Very truly
yours, J. B. FORAKER.
Senator Forakor took the floor as
soon as the president's message and tho
accompanying reports had been read
Ho read a letter from Boyd Conyers,. a
discharged eoldior, who is ,allcgod to
havo mado a confession to Detective
Lawson. In his letter Conyers speaks
of the visit of Lawson to Monroe, Ga.,
where Conyers has bcon living. Conyers
says ho learned that Lawson wa8 there
to "pick" him and that ho had tho
"high sheriff-" arrest Lawson. As
Lawson hnd not had an opportunity to
have a private talk with Conyers, ac
cording to tho latter 's letter, it mado
him angry and Conyera Bays Lawson
told "hes" to the sheriff about kim.
Foraker Sarcastic
Mr. Foraker referred caustically to
tho colored detective, calling attention
to the fact that his "high sounding,
smooth, logical report is signed with
his X mark," and then added:
"Oh, Mr. President, when this thing
is gono to tho bottom of all honest men
will bo ashamed of it."
Taking up a second letter from Boyd
Conyers, and beforo reading it. Sena
tor "Foraker eaid:
"This is a littlo tedious, perhaps, but
I think it is due to this soldier, due to
tho truth and due to a common decency
that the story bu told."
Mr Foraker said tho president's
statement concerning this investigation
by detectives showed, the propriety of
adopting such a provision as that em
bodied in his argument.
"It-seems to me," ho said, "that
one of the worst features of this whole
unfortunate business is that, this man
should now be pursued in this way by
secret detectives in tho uiauner I have
described."
Senator Foraker read a letter he had
written to Conyers in which ho said he
(ihe senator) would "look after" the
detectives who were visiting him.
"Thnt promiso will bo mado good,"
declared Mr. Foraker.
"Enough has been shown to make it
the imperative) dutv of the senate to
create a tribunal before which these
men can go and receive a bearing. Is
there anything more atrocious than this
caso against these men? -This is the
sixth time they havo been put on trial
and five times the- have boon acquitted
iir my opinion."
Mr. Foraker concluded by declaring
thnt the president 's statement that tho
espionage against the soldiers of the
Twenty-fifth regiment would be con
tinued was an additional reason for
somo prompt action by the senate.
STEEL MAGNATE TO
DISCUSS THE TARIFF
WASHINGTON, Dec. In draft
ing the now tariff bill to bo intro
duced nt tho special session of con
gress, the house ways and means com
mittee is to give special consideration
to tho steel schedule. Charles M.
Schwab, the steel magnate, will ap
pear before tho committed tomorrow.
Andrew Carnegie, who luta been sub
poenaed, will not appear until, other
steel men, including Ilcnry Frick of
Pittsburg and Judge E. II. Gary, havu
testified beforo tho committee.
The Republican members of the com
mittee who draft tho new tariff bill
will sit as a sub-committee for this
purpose every day after Monday d.tr
ing the Christmas reccs. It is ihe
elcsiro of the committee to havo all
tho testimony before it as soon as pos
siblo, but wherever it is found that ci.i
testimony has been insufficient, it is
proposed to call those manufacturers bo
fore it who can give tho desired in
formation. When tho majority members of the
committee complete their bill they will
submit it to the Democratic mombors.
The latter will offer tho house a mi
nority report, unless the bill roported
by the Kepublicans provides for the re
ductions that the Democrats favor. Tho
main differences of opinion probably
will be on tho lumbor. metal nnd pulp
and paper schedules. Champ Clark, the
minority leader of the house, has
brought out much important testimony
in Ii'ih examination of witnesses ou the
lumber and $leel schedules, and he fa
vors a material reduction in the duties.
Two hearings were held bv the com
mittee todn- one witness appearing nt
each. At the afternoon hearing Col.
J. W. Allison, a cotton-seed oil man
ufacluror of Texas, asked for a. reduc
tion in tho duty on pressed camel's
hair cloth, the present duty on which,
ho said, is prohibitory, and permits a
monopoly ot tho product. This, cloth
is used in crushing cotton seed in tho
manufacture of the oil.

Tho president's message giving tho
results of tho .var department's uves- '

OUR LATEST SHIPS SUPERIOR II
TO DREADNA.UGHT, SAYS EVANS 1H
NEW YORK, Dec. 14. That the
latest battleships built by this coun
try arc vastly superior to 'England's
Droadnaught, is emphatically stated by
Rear Admiral Roblcv D. Evans in a
magazine articlo written bv him, where
in ho strongly defends the Amcru n
navy and replies to criticisms of it
mado somo time ago by Henry Reutor
dahl and others.
"I do not for a moment claim that
tho Indiana and her sister ships drc
equal to the Droadnautrht of the .jj
glish navy," says Admiral Evans,
"only that she is the equal of the
Eughsh ships designed nt the same
time. But I do claim that our latest
ships aro vastly superior to the Drcael
naught, and I beliovo that every fight
ing man who has given the subject, in
telligent consideration will ngree with
me'
Admiral Evans urges the superiority
of tho thirtecu-inch gun over the
twelve-inch gun, and nsserls that. ,1110
change to 'he lesser caliber to conform
to England's tvne was a most serious
blunder. This is char -able, ho says,
to tho seagoing officers o the navy
and not to any staff corps. Regarei-ing-
the warcr-i!ne armor belt, he says:
"I am sure, after many weeks of
closo observation, that the lower edge
of tho armor belt is too high rather
than too low."
Question of Belt Line.
It had been streuuousb' contended by
CTit.ics that the low location of tho
belt was a vital point of weakness.
"As tho upper edge of the belt is al-,
ways even with or abovo tho level of

the -rotcctiye belt," continues Admiral bII
Evans, "tho danger to be apprehended
from a projectile -enctrating above Lhe HTfll
bolt, beyond the wrecking of such pro- XrlH
jeclilc, is that due to the amount of mlH
water that may enter tho hole. It in nfl
tho damage that ma' be done by such. SlH
projectiles entering below that mav Itl
cause the ship to sink by cxplodiig fttl
magazines or boilers, but this is imt,rub- kII

shells on the wator line, or on tny K'l
other, to disable or sink such a ship if &'H
the officers nnd men know their btisi- npH
ncss and want to fight." fi'H
Admiral Evans declares the state- ffH
mcnt "that a wound on a turret may m'H
disable the turret's guns" is abso- fnH
lutely inaccurate, unless by "wound" ft'l
penetration is meant. fr.il
"Of all the inaccurate and mislead- flltH
ing statements in -this wonderful Rcu- j&fll
ierdahl criticism," he continues,-" tho fjiifll
i most incorrect is that the battleships If H
of the United States aro in exactly tho Bll
samo condition as wero tho Eussian ft'SH
shins after tho Itusso-Jnpanese fight in HJH
tho' sea of Japan not temporarily, but if-iH
permanently." r'l
"I assort." says the admiral, "that fljl
tho battleship fleet of tho United States lOII
never was aiidhiovcr will be, never can Irll
be, in tho condition of that Russian B"H
tleet when it -wcut into action for tho r-jl
last time."
The lending features in battleship f&dl
designs, Admiral Evans concludes,! aro Piill
tho battery, tho armor protection and iMI
the motive power. Any one of theso SiMH
