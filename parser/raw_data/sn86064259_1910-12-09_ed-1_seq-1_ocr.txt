the people felt that they would be
glad to honor the gentleman who has
been so signally honored by the na -
tional government.
Dr W A. Lewis was elected pres -
ident; Dr. J. B. Singleton, secretary.
D. A. Hart, assistant secretary.
Several of the gentlemen present
expressed themselves as hn'ghly

in one Wg gathering.
It was not learned which, faction
first started to arrange for a ban

He recommends strongly some 1
form of ship subsidy to increase
American skipping, 'especially to
South America.
The tariff board is not ready to sub

mission of experts. In the past, con-
gress has appropriated too much for
buildings not needed and not enough
for buildings badly needed.
Recommendations for anti-Injunc

are renewed.
It is proposed , that second-class
mail rates shall bo readjusted so as
to charge magazines a much higher
rate on their advertising aect'nns.
Strong representations are made
for the establishment of a new bank
ing and currency system.
Two new battleships and several
auxiliary vessels are urged for the
navy.
The President recommends that
coal, phosphate ind oil lands and
water power sites be disposed of in
the future by leasing.
Estimates for government expendl-
propriations for the current year.
The estimated receipts for th next
fsral year are $G80,000,000.
The President urges the extension
of the civil service principle to all
classes of postmasters and to tho dtp
lomatis and consular "corps, and the
acquisition by the government of
residences and offices for its diploma
tic officers.
Some criticisms ot the Payne tariff
act are just, says the President, but
more are unfounded.
There should be more officers for
the army; the engineer corps should
be increased by sixty.
Regarding the Panama Calan, the
President says: "Tht? progress: nf the
work is most satisfactory. It will be
completed well within the time set,
January 1, 1915, and within the es
timated cost of $375,000,000. The
slides in Culebra cut offer no great
reason for delay."
Interstate railroads should be pre
vented from owning or controlling
shirs trading through the canal.
The President declares the crying
need of the United States in cheapen
ing the cost of litlation by simpli
fying judicial procedure and expedit
ing final judgement. The supreme
court should be relieved from un
necessary appeals. The salaries of
Federal judgs should be increased.
Postal savings banlo will be estab

A parcels post on rural delivery
routes is recommenced.
The President recommends that

NOTE OF THE APPEAL.
To the Editor of the Globe:
Through the medium of your valued
newspaper I desire to say a word to
the colored people regarding the Im
portance of good public schools. It has
been some months since I have had
aniythinig to say on this important
Bubject. I wish to repeat that which
I have tried to emphasize from time
to time, that there are few, if any
subjects, which are of more vital and
far-reaching importance to the masses
of our race in the South at the pres
ent time than that of building up a
good public school system.
Only a very small per cent of our
people can ever go to a large board
ing school, or any kind of college, or
industrial sichool for their education.
The masses must depend upon the:
public Bchool in their neighborhood
for whatever education they get. II
the ptiblic school Is a failure the mas
ses grow up in ignoranqe, and
so I am making this direct appeal to
every minister, teacher and busines3
man and woman throughout the South
to take a personal and deep interest
in the condition of the Negro public
schools.
First of all, we should bear in mind
that we are American citizens and
that we should have our rightful
share nf the nuhlta school fund.
wiiere we are not getting our just
share of the public school fund. . a
direct appeal should be made to the
public school authorities for a more
just aioinutlon of the pubiic school
ties had (lone their duty.
In traveling through the South, I
have observed that wherever a good
public schoolhouse is provided, tn
most cases, the result is, that that
community will have a good teacher
and a school term of respectable
through the public tuna or irom pn
vate gifts in that community a good
public school building. In many
: cases, where people are not able to
give money toward the erection of a
good schoolhouse, they can give the
use cf their teams to haul lumber, or
they can give material, or give with
out charge so many days' work each
week, but in some way, every commu
nity that is now without a comfort-
fble schoolhouse should set to work
luTu,e t. m ,u

which the children are taught are not

' leak- the floors are full of holes, there
,g no g am, ,n many caspSi thQ
benches and other furniture are so
rude and worthless that it is impos-
Eible for teacher and children to stay
, jn slIlCh houses without being in con-
tinual misery.
A schoolhouse is not completed un
til it has been either painted or white
washed on the inside or outside;
neither is a schoolhouse complete un
til it has been ceile1 or plastered on
the inside, and every schoolhouse
should be thoroughly furnished with
good seats; a teacher's desk, with
good blackboards, etc., before It
should be considered completed. It is
almost as cheap to fcuild a good
schoolshouse as it is to build a poor
one.-
