With the good times we are having
under a Republican national admin
istration, it is time for this State to
take a hint.
Since the South furnishes the few
votes the Tammany Democrats might
at least allow them to name the tail
of the ticket.
The Democrats always have a race
problem on hand. This time it is
the race for office, regardless of the
color scheme.
The Greensboro News refers to Ex
Governor Robert Broadnax Glenn as
a "near-statesman." Don't mean
right near, though, do you?
An Indiana paper says that pov
erty is a disease. Now this is a dis
ease on which Rockefeller oan spend
another million to good effect.
A Washington writer Is of the
opinion that Senator Bailey was born
to lead. To which opinion Colonel
Bryan will be sure to dissent.
If Mr. Glenn quits his religious

You can't blame him when you re
member that the former minister
lost his head for talking too much.

Democratic platform was thrown to
gether and then allowed to go to
pieces.
Six fourth-class postofflces in Ar

the postmasterships. Are there no
Democrats In that section of Arkan
sas?
The Charlotte Observer has never
had much faith in the blood hound
hut since one of the Mecklenburg
grand Jurors was nabbed last week
probably the Observer will hare more
faith ia this specie of the eanlme.
ANOTHER ATTACK OX MORE
HE A I).
A Question and Answer: "What
Republicans are Displeased With
Morehead, and Why?" An An
swer That Does Not Answer.
The Asheville Gazette-News, one
of the organs of the patronage ma
chine, in answer to a letter, makes
the following tame reply: "
"Mr. Morehead's Standing.
"We are publishing on this page a
letter from Mr. Harris of Dillsboro,
asking that we 'inform an anxious
reader what Republicans are dis
pleased with Congressman Morehead
and why?'
"As likely ae- not we shall have to
leave Mr. Harris unsatisfied, or alone
In anxiety. In ' far as our personal
knowledge extends Mr. Morehead
may stand Just as high in Republican
circles in North Carolina as Mr. Har
ris thinks he does both at home and
In Washington. In the first place
we are not very well acquainted with
the distinguished subject of Mr. Har
ris' letter, albeit we are not unmind
ful that the admission cannot be re
garded as complimentary to our
selves. What little we know, how
ever, has not had the effect of en
dearing him to us. He was elected to
Congress by Republican votes in spite
of himself. He had no faith in his
own candidacy, and repeatedly said
so. It was only the despised "ma
chine" that felt that he had any
chance, and that Insisted on making
a serious campaign. The 6ingle cir
cumstance that warranted one in con
cluding that he had more than a
passing interest in the result was the
charge that emanated periodically
from Morehead headquarters, in the
form of a slanderous accusation that
he was not receiving the loyal sup
port of the Republican leaders. Fol
lowing the election, the legitimate re
sult of a patriotic and concerted par
ty effort, he was heard to remark, as
we understand it, that he was under
no obligation to the old time party
eaders, and his friends did whatever
they could to push along the allega
tion of the Democratic press that
Morehead would never have received
the support of the Republican organ-
zation had those attached thereto
had any idea he was to be elected.
he Morehead followers fostered and
pushed along that gratuitously false
accusation, Just as it has the latter
day charge, upon which the Demo
cratic press is . now ringing the
changes, that 'the Glasson appoint
ment was to be attributed to the
machinations of E. C. Duncan,
charge which they know, upon no
ess authority than the Associated
Press, to be wlthoaf the slightest
foundation in fact.
"So much for the personal and pri
vate movements of Mr. Morehead, of
which we have any knowledge. As
to his Congressional career, we as
sume that his legislative achieve
ments have not as yet been compiled
He has been represented to us as
one apart, as not being as other men.
This process of reasoning may sound
a bit subtle, but we think the great
mass of unwashed, unrespectable Re
publicans understood what was
meant when they were assured that
Mr. Morehead was a "commercial,"
with what the Charlotte Chronicle
calls "Democratic affiliations." The
one thing that Mr. Morehead particu
larly abhorred and deprecated, along
with his party chief, was any move
ment inside his party household that
suggested an organized chase for
Federal patronage. The eighty thous
and plebs of his own party must,
therefore, have regarded the spec
tacle with some surprise, not unmix
ed with disappointment, when they
observed that the most conspicuous
act of their superior's Congressional
career had taken the form of a pal
pitating chase for. a piece of census
patronage, a chase that, for heat and
singleness of purpose, made the ef
forts of the old-line professionals in
that direction look like a cool, col
lected Indifference.
"But, as we have before remarked,
it Is possible that Mr. Morehead
stands Just as highly in Republican
circles as Mr. Harris says he does.
The Chronicle editorial, to which our
offending remarks had reference,
says that the "machine" is against
him, and Mr. Harris knows as well
as we who constitute the organiza
tion of his party. The Chronicle may
be wrong. Mr. Morehead may be held
by his party in a sort of blanket af
fection. It is certain that this is
one of the things that the future
will determine.
"Congressman Morehead denies
that he ever said he proposed to
resign if he were not permitted to
name the census supervisor in his
district. It was even said that he
told the President that such was his
Intention, should Mr. Taft fail to re
voke the Glasson appointment. In
considering this denial it is of minor
interest to recall that the story was
first set in motion in a special from
Greensboro, we believe It was, by the
custodian of the Morehead Guberna
torial boom."
The letter referred to is as fol
lows:
Mr. Harris Makes an Inquiry.
Editor of The Gazette-News:
I notice in your paper of November
26th that you say or suggest 'that
Republicans are not consumed with
love and affection for Congressman
Moorehead.' I have noted also other

ZELAYA'STROUBLES
Strong Demonstration atNica-
raguan Capitol Against
President Zelaya.
TOO MUCH FOR THE POLICE
President Zelaya Has Promised to
Publish To-day Announcement of
His Resignation From Presidency
Situation Favors the Insurgents
Mob Cheers Insurgent Leader
and Praises United States "Long
Lire Liberty; Down With Oppres
sion I"
Managua, Nicaragua, Dec. 14.
Rebellion has broken out at the
capital. The streets are filled with
unrestrained demonstrators. Shouts
of "Long live liberty; the United
States and Estrada!" fill the air. The
police have made no move to check
the mob. It is said that President
Zelaya has promised to publish to
day the announcement of his resig
nation from the presidency.
For the first time in sixteen years
a street meeting of malcontents has
been permitted without police inter
ference. The demonstration began
last night and continued for hours.
This forenoon comparative quiet has
been restored, but the significance
of the events of the last few hours
admit of but one Interpretation. The
anti-Zelaya feeling is so strong that
the government does not dare to at
tempt its suppression.
The climax was reached last
night when the government attempt
ed to put through Congress a bill
conceding to certain exploiters min
ing rights covering vasts undefined
areas irrespected of the private own
ership of the surface of the proper
ties. Congressman Enrique Corda
opposed the measure in a speech that
aroused the wildest enthusiasm. The
government, seeing that the motion
was in danger of being lost, percipl-
tatedly adjourned the session. It was
too late, however, to head off the
burst of indignation that had swept
over the legislative body, supposed
to have been friendly to Zelaya. The
announcement of the adjournment
was greeted with hisses, and when
Corda left the building he was given
an ovation.
From the meeting place the Con
gressman was followed to his hotel
by a mob which alternately cheered
Corda and cried, "Long live liberty!"
"Down with oppression!"
.THREE WOMEN. BUS VICTIMS.
Savannah Horrified by the Crime of
a Negro Brute Polios Arrested
150 Persons.
Savannah, Ga., Dec. 10. Victims
of a feaful crime, Mrs. Eliza Grib
bell, aged seventy years, and her
daughter, Mrs. Carrie Ohlander, were
found dead in their home, 401 Perry
Street west, here to-day.
A third, Mrs. Maggie Hunter, aged
thirty-two, found Just inside the
front door of the house, is dying at
the Savannah Hospital.
Physicians state that Mrs. Ohlan
der was the victim of an assault be
fore she was killed. A reward of
$1,000 for the capture of the mur
derer has been offered.
Negro men, numbering 150, caught
in the meshes of the police drag-net
through Yamacraw, the negro section
of the city, are prisoners In the
police station, the theory of the po
lice being that a negro, having plan
ned an assault upon Mrs. Ohlander,
was compelled to commit the other
crimes to escape.
Other arrests will be made, until
every negro in the city who in any
way resembles the description of one
who has been seen-frequently about
the premises of- the house of the
murdered woman in the last three
days is a prisoner.
The police believe that this ne
gro, using an axe taken from the
woodshed in the rear of the Gribble
home, beat Mrs. Gribble to death,
strucK down tne unknown woman
and, after assaulting Mrs. Ohlander
in the wide, long hallway where the
bodies were found, finished his work
by beating in her skull with the axe

SOME STARTLING FACTS.
Mecklenburg Grand Jnry Find That
Convicts Have to Eat With Chips
and Pieces of Bark Vicious
Bloodhounds Allowed to Run at
Large and Are a Menance to the
Community.
Charlotte, N. C, Dec. 11. That
the convicts of Mecklenburg eat with
chips and pieces of bark is the start
ing disclosure made by the regular
report of the grand Jury, which late
to-day completed its six months'
term of service under Judge James
Webb, and there Is greate danger In
ettlng run loose the "so-called"
bloodhounds &t Je convfbt camps, Is
another declaration of the grand
ury, following the narrow escape of
k Juror who was attacked viciously
by a dog and was saved only in the
niek of time.
We recommend, says the report
submitted to-day:
"That the dogs at the camp be
held In leash, at least during the
day, as one of the grand Jurors, while
nspecting the camp, was attacked by
one or tne so-caiiea biooanounas,
which was finally subdued after a
fierce fight. We deem it a menace
to the public to let these beasts run
at large In the day time."
In regard to the lack of means for
transferring their food from the lit
tle plates of tin to their mouths at
meal time, at the camps, the grand
Jury says:
"We recommend that spoons be
furnished the convicts to eat dinner,
as we found most of the convicts
eating dinner with chips and pieces
of bark."
What excuse the keepers of the
three camps in Mecklenburg County,
with their seventy-five to one hun
dred charges, will make to this sen
sational report is not known, as the
camps are located out in the country
and are not easy of access. The
grand Jury was perhaps reduced to
state of mind bordering on para
noia by the vicious attack of the so
called bloodhound, and was not in a
frame of mind to hurl over many
boquets at the managers of the
camps and those who look after the
convicts' welfare. It should be said,
however, that this jury, which so
stirred the wrath of the canines
about the camps, reported that the
convicts were well fed and clothed,
and had sanitary advlsary quarters.

all right. She was waiting on
freight to pass and attempted to
cross the track Immediately before
the on-coming train. She Is a sister-
in-law of Mr. S. E. Tucker of this

TAFT UNCHANGED
His Critics Have Modified
Their Views as Regards
His Message
THE ROOSEVELT POLICIES
Special Messages Will Be Sent to
Congress on Subjects not Covered
in His Regular Message Presi
dent Admonishes Census Supervis
ors to Stay Out of Politics Hon.
J. A. Smith Urging Ills Contest
Against Mr. Webb Visitors at the
National Capital.
(Special to The Caucasian.)
Washington, D. C, Dec. 14 Those
who are prompt to criticise President
Taft's message on the ground that
he failed to declare for a continua
tion of the Roosevelt policies In the
three most important respects, have
largely modified their views. They
see that the President's message
squarely declares that very soon
special messages will be sent to Con
gress on these very points.
On the trust question, the Presi
dent naturally wanted to wait to see
what the Supreme Court of the
United States would do with the de
cision in the Standard Oil case. Just
what the highest court in the land
would hold to be the law on this
crucial question would, of course, de
termine what changes, if any, should
be made to strengthen the anti-trust
law.
On the question of conservation of
natural resources, it is understood
that the President was awaiting an
nvestigation as to the differences
that had grown up between the Inte
rior Department and the Agricul
tural Department as .to the best
methods to be pursued to carry out
the Roosevelt policies to further this
mportant movement.
On the question of the regulation
of railroad rates, it is well known
(but a fact which many had over-
ooked) that the President had some
months ago appointed a commission
of some strong lawyers to confer and
co-operate with the members of the
Interstate Commerce Commission in
drafting a bill to enlarge and
strengthen the powers of the Inter-
State Commerce Commission, and If
need be, to create an Interstate court
to hear all such cases direct and with
an appeal only to the Supreme Court
of the United States. Since the Pres-
dent's message was sent to Congress
this commission has made its report,
and a special message will soon go
to Congress from the President on
this subject.
Census Supervisors in Politics.
Last week a meeting of a large
number of the census supervisors of
the United States, Including nearly
all of the supervisors of North Caro
lina, was called to meet in Washing
ton. The Director of the Census
drilled them in their duties and then
took them in a body to call on the
President.
While at the White House, the
President took accasion to emphati
cally warn these supervisors that
they must not be guilty of doing any
political work for any Congressman
or party organization of any kind
while serving the Government as of
ficers of the Census. He further
warned them that if any of the enu
merators appointed by them were,
caught in doing any kind or partisan
or political work that they should
dismiss them at once, and besides,
he said, turning to the supervisors,
"If you do not do this I will dismiss
you, and if I catch any of you doing
any political work you will be dis
missed for that reason also."
It is understood that the President
is very determined on this point, and
that he has let It be known that he
will welcome any Information sent
to him showing that any of the cen
sus supervisors or enumerators have
in any way violated these instruc
tions.
He made it plain that these officers
would not be expected to serve as
delegates to conventions or to take
an active part in manipulating pri
maries or conventions. This infor
mation will, of courae, be very dis
turbing and disquieting to the pat
ronage machine in North Carolina,
which not only appointed all of the
supervisors except in the districts
represented by Republican Congress
men, but which actually tried to grab
the supervisor in Congressman
Morehead's district.
Many North Carolinians Here.
During the last week a number of
prominent North Carolinians have
been in the city. Ex-Congressman
Thomas Settle is hear as the guest of
Congressman Morehead. He Is
prominently spoken of as district at
torney for the western district. He
Is a brilliant young lawyer and would
fill any position with credit .to his
party and to the State.
Mr. Logan, who is the manager of
Congressman Grant's campaign, is
here, and is slated as the marsha
for the western district. Mr. Mc-
Veagh, 'of Alamance County, who
is said to have the endorsement of
the patronage machine for this posi
tion, has also been here, as well as
Mr. McCreary, and other candidates
for the same position.
Hon. John A. Smith, the Republi
can candidate for Congress in the
Charlotte District, has been here
looking after his contest against Con
gressman Webb. Former Senator
Thurston is his attorney, and it is
claimed by Mr. Smith's friends that
there will be enough Irregularities
snd frauds shown In the district to
change the result.
Mr. D. A. Thompklna, the proprie
tor of the Charlotte Observer, and
who was seriously considered by the
President for Minister to China. Mr.
Tlllstt of the Charlotte bar. Es-At-torney
General Walser, and many
other North Carolinians have been
here during the past week.

America in a sense, at least.
The Philippine Islands air th
greatest group or island In the
world. In number, anyway, for there
air at least fourteen hundred Islands
n the bunch. The Japanese group
only contains six hundred. Hut Ja
pan contains more territory, aome or
the island! bein larger. Most or the
arge Islands, the ones Inhabited, air
named so as to distinguish them. Hut
many ov tbe Islands air very small.
little sand, some grass and a few
bushes. Luzon. Fanay, Ngros, Ce-
bu and Samar air by far tbe largest.
Luzon, the largest Island, ii very
much like the larger Japanese Isl
ands, bein' very fertile and great
mountains tower up along hits entire
ength, causln the climate to be cool
and that portion ov the island Is com
paratively healthy.
Back In the palmy days or Bpaln

sbout the same time she planted her
flag In Cuba, I guess. The original
population wus a mixture and hit
soon become Moroes. Hit is now
hiliplno, Spanish, Chinese. Jap-
snese, Russian, with a recent addi
tion ov American blood.
The Phlllplnos, however, air Intel-
lgent, and they air quite religious.
the Catholics and other denomina
tions havln' quite a foothold through
out most ov the islands.
But Spain never had much foot
hold In the Philippines. She man
aged to collect a considerable amount
or taxes from the Inhabitants and
wus compelled to keep a large num
ber ov soldiers at the larger towns.
But even military rules did not reaeh
ar.
Bomethin' like twelve years ago a
chain ov circumstances relieved
Spain ov tbe Philippines and restored
Cuba to the Cubans. For years
Spain had been tryln' to control her
two great colonies, the one In the
Atlantic, the other In the Pacific. Hit
finally ended in real war. Durln' tbe j
war in Cuba, while tbe Spanish gov
ernment wuz tryln' to crush the re
bellion, an American battleship, the
Maine," happened to visit Havana.
Most ov your readers know what
happened. The Spanish government
denied awl knowledge ov the blowln'
up ov the Maine and the death ov
several hundred American sailors.
After failin' to git satisfaction, the
United States decided to give Spain
a thra8hln A portion ov the Span
ish navy wuz tlsn at Manila, the
principal seaport ov the Philippines.
Admiral Dewey, commandln' a di
vision ov the American navy, set sail
for the Philippines. Or course the
Spanish government heard or that.
but the impression seemed to get out
somehow that Dewey wus out fer a
practice cruise." But when he sail
ed into Manila harbor one dark and
stormy night and waded into the
Spanish fleet with his sleeves rolled
up there wuz another tune. In about
two hours hit wus awl over. Every
Spanish warship that had floated so
proudly a few hours before wus at
the bottom ov the bay and Dewey's
fleet had not lost a man. Just a little
