ADDRESS TO MINE-OWNERS
AND PROSPECTORS.
El Paso, Texas.
December 1,
Gentlemen:
The El Paso Chamber of Com
merce extends a cordial invitation
to all mining men and others who
may be disused to attend the
proposed meeting in El Paso,
January 1, 1901, for the purpose
of organizing a mining associa
tion. The Chamber of Commerce
proffers its good offices and assist
ance in every possible way to
promote the purpose of the pro
posed meeting, and assures to all
who may attend a hearty wel
come by the citizens of El Paso.
Mining men who attend the
meeting are respectfully request
ed, where practicable, to bring
samples of the ores from their
properties and place them in the
collection which the Chamber of
Commerce is accumulating in this
city, as a means of promoting the
mining interests of the Southwest,
and disseminating information
regarding the vast undeveloped
resources here awaking the com
ing of investors and operators.
. Fraternally yours,
El Paso Chamber of Commerce,
. S. J. Freudenthal,
Ernest E. Russell, President.
. Secretary. ,
The Chamber of Commerce of
El Pasp is taking tip the question
of railroad freight rates into that
city. The railroads have had a
clear liold in the matter of freight
charges, and will doubtless have
a kick coming agairrst El Paso's1
final request for lower rates. New
Mexico is the victim of outrage in
this matter of railroad charges.
All kinds of merchandise is ship
ped through New Mexico from
border to lorder to El Paso and
other southern and western points
cheaper than they arc laid down
at any point on the railroad lines
in the territory. The New Mex
ico legislature should give the
territory relief in this particular,
but nobody is so lunatic as to ex
pect any kind of economical leg
islation from a New Mexican
legislature. The New Mexican
legislature is a kind of burlesque
on a country debating society,
except that its deliberations arc
edited and published by the New
Mexican Printing Company and
bound in sheep in order that
"Max" may get his alternate an
nual take-off.

THE OSCURA DISTRICT.
;. Some very rich finds of copper
ore hava been made in the Oscura
district lately. Captain D. I)o

in the-vicinity of Schuley's well,
15 miles from Malagra last week
to Colorado capitalists consider
ation not known. A cash pay

greatest copper camp.

In witness whereof,
Teddy in very much concerned
over the fact that President Mc
Kinlev does not want him to ride
with him on inauguration day.
It has always been the custom for
the retiring president to ride in
the carriage with the president
elect. But since McKinley suc
ceeds himself, Teddy desires this
honor. A friend of Kosevelt's
says the governor desires to ride
with president McKinley merely
so that the latter may share the
applause that would greet the
governor along the way.

A FIFTH TERM.
General Porfirio Diaz was in
augurated president of the Mexi
can republic December the 1st,
for the 5th term, at the end of
which he will have been president
of Mexico for 20 years. The
Mexican republic has had won
derful progress and industrial de
velopment in the administration
of Diaz, and the fact that this in
auguration was celebrated all
over the republic shows the high
esteem in which he is held bv the
people of his government. The
governors of all the states in the
republic journied to the city to be
present at the inauguration.

A dispatch to the Bolivian
Minister at Washington gives an
account of a South American freak
of government making and gov
eminent unmaking. The despatch
says: "The announcement of the
existence . of a new tepiibic,; ti
South America and the news .of'
its' extinction come ahuost siiríül
taneously. The republic of Boli
via has conquered the.country .and
wiped out its shortlived govern
ment. The building up and ím
mediately tearing down of govern
ments is becoming a trade in
South America. The United
States and Britain should take an
instructor from some of these
South American countries for
tutorship in their national schools
Experience is a great teacher

The tragic story of the killing
of Joseph Corn reported to have
taken place at Oscar Hyde's ranch
in the White mountains has been
searched out, and found to have
taken place at Central, in Grant
county. Corn was killed in a sa
loon row by Julius Wcllhausen, a
bartender in the Palace saloon of
that place. Corn was said to be
a prominent stockman of Grant
county, and has resided in Grant
county for 25 years. Dispatches
from Central state that he has an
uncle living in Lincoln county
and one at Pinos Altos, being the
only relations he has in this
country.
A THANKSGIVING PARDON.
In accordance with an annual
custom, Governor Otero pardoned
Jesus huhio, whose meritorious
conduct during the 21 years of
his imprisonment was the consul
eration which induced the peni
tentiary commission to recommend
him for pardon. He was the old
est convict at the penitentiary,
having been sentenced for life
from Dona Ana county for murder

A London dispatch announces
that Lord Kitchener has a very

from the outside England woul

for the fact that our own belovei
