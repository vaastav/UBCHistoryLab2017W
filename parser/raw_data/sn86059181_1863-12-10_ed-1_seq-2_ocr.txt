PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate
mmd ZfoM RtpretcrUaUvtt i
Another year of health and of suffi
ciently abundant harvests has passed.
For theae,&Dd especially for an improved
condition of our national affairs, our re
newed and proper gratitude to God is
due. We remain in peace and friend
ship with foreign powers. The efforts of
disloyal citizens of the United States to
involve us in foreignwars, to aid inex
cusable insurrection, have been unavail-
fler Brittanic Majesty's Government,
as was justly expected, have exercised
their authority to prevent the departure
of hostile expeditions from British ports.
The Emperor of France has, by a like
proceeding, promptly vindicated the neu
trality, which he proclaimed at the be
ginning of the contest.
Questions of great intricacy and im
portance have arisen out of the blockade,
and other belligerent operations, between
the Government and several of the mari
time powers, bnt they have been dis
cussed, and, so far as was possible, ac
commodated, in a spirit of frankness,
justice and mutual good will.
It is especially gratifying that our
Prize Courts, by the impartiality of their
adjudications, have commanded the re
spect and confidence of maritime powers.
The supplemental treaty between the
United States and Great Britain fo the
suppression of the African slave trade,
made on the 18th day of February last,
has been duly ratified and carried into
execution. It is believed that, so far as
American ports and American citizens
are concerned, that inhuman and barba
rous traffic has been brought to an end.
I shall submit, for the consideration of
the Senate, a convention for the adjust
ment of possessory claims in Washing
ton Territory, arising out of the treaty of
tne iota ot June, tsw, between the Uni
ted 8tates and Great Britain, and which
have been the source of some disquiet
among the citizens of that now rapidly
improving part of the country.
A novel and important question, in
volving the extent of the maritime ju
risdiction of Spain in the waters which
surround the Island of Cuba, has been
debated, without reaching an agreement,
and it is proposed in an amicable spirit
to refer it tothe arbitrament of a friend
ly Power. A convention for that par
pose, will be submitted to the Senate.
I have thought proper to subject to
the approval f the Senate, to concur
with the interested Commercial Powers,
in an arrangement for the liquidation of
Scheldt dues, upon'prineiples which have
been heretofore adopted in regard to the
imposts upon navigation in the waters of
Denmark.
The long pending controversy between
this Government and that of Chili,
touching the seizure at Silona in Peru
by Chilian officers, of a large amount in
treasure belonging to citizens of the
United States, has been brought to a
close hy the award of his Majesty, the
King of the Belgian'?, to whose arbitra
tion the question was referred by the
parties. Ihe subject was thoroughly
and patiently examined by that justly
respected magistrate, and," although the
sum awarded to the claimants may not
have been 'as large as they expected,
there is no reason to distrust the wisdom
of his Majesty's decision. That decis
ion waspronrptly complied with by Chi

reached that country.
The joint commission under the act of
the- last session for carrying into effect
the convention with Peru, on the subject
of claims, has been organized at Lima
and is engaged in the business entrusted
to it
Difficulties concerning the inter-oceanic
transit through Nicaragua, are in course
of amicable adjustment, in conformity
with the principle set forth in my last
annual message.
I have received the representative from
the United States of Columbia, and have
accredited a Miuister to that Republic.
Incidents occurring in the progress of
our civil war, have forcef upon my atten
tion the uncertain state of fnternation
al questions touching the rights of
foreigners in this country, and of
United States' citizens abroad. In re
gard to some governments, these rights
are, at least partially, defined by treaties.
In no instance, however, is it expressly
stipulated that, on the instance of civil
war. a foreiffter residing in this country,
within the lines of the insurgents,
is to he exempted from the rule
which classes him as a belligerent, in
whose behalf the Government of his
country cannot expect any privileges
or immunities from that character. 1
regret to say, however, that such claims
have been put forward, and in some in
Btances.in behalf of foreigners who have
hved in the United States for the great
er part of their Uvea
There is reason to believe that many
persons born in foreign countries, who
have declared their intention to become
citizens, or who have been fully natural
ized, have evaded the military dntv re
quired of them, by denying the fact, and
thereby throwing upon this government
the burden of proof Jt has been fdlnd
difficult or impracticable to obtain this
proof from the want .of guides to the
proper sources of information. These
might be supplied by requiring the clerks
of courts where a declaration of inten
tion may be made or naturalization ef
fected, to send periodically lists of the
names of persons naturalized, or declar
ing their intention to become citizens,
'.o the Secretary of the Interior, in
whose Department these names must
be arranged and printed for gen
eral information. There is also reason
to believe that foreigners frequently be
come citizens of the United States, for
the sole purpose of evading the duties
imposed by the laws of their native couq
try, to which, after becoming naturalized
here, they at once repair, and though
never returning to the United States,
they still claim the interposition of this
Government aa citizens. Many altera
tions and great prejudices have hereto
fore arisen oat of this abuse. It is,
thetefcr, submitted to tout considera
tion. It might be advisable to fix a
limit beyond which no citizen of the
United States, residing abroad, may
claim the interposition of this Govern
ment The right of suffrage has often
been assumed and exercised by aliens,
under pretense of naturalization, which
they have disavowed when drafted into
tne military service.
I sebmit the expediency of ?uch an
amendment of the laws, as will make
the fact of .voting an estoppel against
any claim of exemption from military
service, or other civil obligations on the
ground of alienage.
In common with the Western Powers,
on relations with Japan have been put
in serious jeopardy, through the perverse
opposition of the hereditary aristocracy
of the Empire, to the enlightened and
liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to
bring that country into the society of na
tions. It is to be hoped, although not
with entire confidence, that these difn
calties may be peacefully overcome.
I ask your attention to the claim of
the minister residing there, for the dam
ages he sustained in the destruction by

I recommend to your Favorable consid
eration the subject of an international
teiegrapn between this uapitai ana tne
National Forts on the Atlantic seaboard
and the Gulf of Mexico. Such constw
tions.established with a reasonable outlay,
would be economical ae well as effective
aids to the diplomatic, military and na
val service. .
The Consular system of the United
States, nnder the enactments of the last
Congress, begins to be self-sustaining,
and there is reason to hope that it may
become entirely so, with the increase of
trade which will ensne when peace is re
stored. Our ministers abroad have been faith
ful in defending American rights.
In- protecting our commercial inter
terfsts, oar consuls necessarily have to
encounter increased labors and respon
sibilities growing ont of the war. These
they have, for the most part, met and
lisclBrged with zeal and efficiency. This
acknowledgment justly includes those
consuls residing in Morocco, Egypt, Chi
na and other" central countries, and are
charged with complications and extraor
dinary powara.
The condition of the several organ
ized Territories jg generaiy satisfactory,
although the Indian disturbances in New
Mexico have not been entirely suppressed.
The Mineral resources of Colorado,
Nevada, Idahoe, Xew Mexico and Arri
zonia are proving far richer than hereto
fore understood. I lay before you com
munications on this subject on ths Gov
ernment ot ew Mexico:
I again submit to your consideration
the expediency of establishing a' system
for the encouragement of emigration.
Althongh this source of national wealth
is Bowing with greater freedom than for
several years before the insurrection oc
cured, there is still a great deficiency of
laborers in every field of industry, espec
ially in agriculture and in our mines as
well of iron and coal as of precious met
als. While the demand for labor is thus
increased here, tens of thousands desti
tute of remuneration and . occupation
are thronging our foreign consulates and
offering to emigrate to the United States
it essential but very cheap assistance can
be afforded them It is easy to see that
under the sharp discepline. 'of ;ivif
war the nation is begining a new life.
This noble effort demands the aid, and
ought to receive the attention and sup
port of the Government
Injuries, nnforseen by the Govern
ment, and unintended, may in some
cases have been inflicted on the subjects
or citizens of foreign countries, both on
sea and on land, by persons in the ser
vice of the United States. Ae this Gov
ernment expects redress from Other Pow
ers when similar injuries are inflicted by
persons in their service upon citizens of
the United States, we must be prepared
to do justice to foreigners. If the exist
ing Judicial tribunals are inadequate for
this purpose, a special Court may be au
thorised, with power to hear and decide
such claims, of the character referred to
as may; nave arisen under the treaties
and the public laws. Conventions for
adjusting claims by your commission
have been proposed to some Govern
ments, but no definite answer to these
propositions has yet been received from
any.
In the course of the session I shall
probably have occasion to request you to
provide indemnification to claimants.
Decrees of restitution have been ren
dered, and damages awarded by the Ad
miralty court, and in other cases where
this Government may be acknowledged
to oe iij.uic iu j,i incline, uuciwucii uv
amoSnt of that liability has been enter
tained byn informal arbitration lliai
The proper officers of the Treasury
have deemed themselves required by the
law of the United States, on the subject
to demand a tax upon the incomes of
Foreign Consuls in this country. While
such a demand may not be an indica
tion of public law, or perhaps of iry
existing treaty between the United
States and a foreign country, the expedi
ency of so far modifying the act as to
exempt from tax the income of such
Consuls, ns are not oitiaens of the Uni
ted States, derived from the emoluments
of their office. o from property not sit
uated in the United States, is submitted
to your sarious consideration. I make
this suggestion upon the ground that a
comity that ought to be reciprocated,
exempts oar Counflabj in all other coun
tries from taxation.
To the extent thus indicated the Uni
ted States, I think, ought not to be ex
ceptionally illiberal to international trade
and commerce.' ' I!M nfni
The operations of the Treasury
during the last year have been suc
cessfully conducted. The enactment
by Congress of a national banking law,
has proved a valuable support of the pub
lic credit, and the' general legislation in
relation to loans has fully answered the
expectatibnV of its favorers. Spme
amendments may be required, to perfect
existing laws, but no change in their
principles or general scope, is believed
to be needed.
Sice these measures have been in op
eration all demands on tho Treasury, in
cluding pay of the army and navy, have
been promptly met arid fully satisfied
No considerable body of troops, it is be
lieved, was ever more amply provided
for, more liberally and punctually paid,
and it may be added that by no people
were the burdens incident to a great war
more cheerfully borne.

wmcn i invite your attention.
It is sufficient to say here that it i not
Deneved that the actunl results will ex
hibit a state of the finances, less favor
able to the country than the estimates
of that office heretofore submitted. While
it is confidently expected that at the
close of the year both the disbursements
and debts will be found very consider
ably less than has been anticipated
i he report of the Secretary of War is
a document of great iatfrMCv fj 1 ii i
It consists ot, 1st, the military opera

to make a valuable summary of this report
except such as would be too extended for
this place, and hence I content myself
witbreferring your attention to the re
port iteelf. The duties devolving on the
nataCbranch of the(T-ervici .during the
year, and throughout the whole of this
unhappy contest, have been discharged
with fidelity and eminent success.
The extensive blockade has been con
stantly increasing in efficiency, as the
navyaas expanded. let on so long a line
it has, so larj.oeen impossible to entirety
suppress illicit trade. From the returns
received at thftrXavy Department, it ap
pears that more than 1,000-Te.ssei.s have
been captured since the blockade was in
stituted, andht the value of the prizes
already sent in for adjudication amounts
to over $13,000,000.
The naval force of the United States
consists at this time of 588 .vessels, com
pleted and in course of construction, and
of these 75 ore iron clad, armored steam
ers. J 1 J2
The events of the war gave an in
creaied interest and importance to the
Navy which will probably expend beyond
the war itself. J?. i . f 2
Thj? armed vessels in onr navy cora-
i pleted and in service, or under contract
ana approacnieig completion, are benev-edt-xeeed
in number those of nny
other power. While they may be relied
upon for harbor defence and seacoast
service, othewof greater strength and
capacity will be necessary for cruising
purpqes and to maintain our rightful pos
ition on the ocean. The change that haa
taken place in naval warfare since the in
troduction of steam as a motive power
for ships .of wardemands either a corres
ponding change in some of our existing
navy yards, or the establishment of new.
ones, for the construction and necessary
repair ot modern war vessels. ro in
considerable embarrassment, delay and
public injury have befcp experienced from
the want of such Gdrrernment establish
ments. The necessity of such a navy
yanrr so famished, at some snitable place
upon the .Atlantic seaboard, has, on re
peated occasions, been brought to the at
tention ot Congress by the Navy Depart-
ment, anu'is again presented in the re
port of the Secretary, -which accompanies
this communication. I think it my duty
to invite yonr special attention to this
subject, and also that of the establishment
of a Yard and Depot, for naval purposes,
upon oe of tho Western rivers. A na
val force ha been created on these in
terior waters, and under many disadvan
tages, within little mote than two years,
exceeding in numbers the whole naval
force of the country at the commence
ment of the present administration. Sat
isfactory and important a3 have
been the performances of the heroic men
of the navy at this period, they are
scarcely more wonderful than the servi
ces of onr mechanics and citizens in the
production of war vessels, which has cre
ated a new form of naval power. Our
country has advantages superior to any
other nation, in our rofioojrfcs of iron
and timber, with inexhaustible quanti
ties of fuel in the immediate vicin
ity of both, and all accessible
and in close proximity to navigable
waters without the disadvantage of pub
He risks. The resources of the nation
have been developed and its power display
ed U-the"con8triction of t navy:ot ioeh
uiajimiiwr, -wmvit iia, . mr "Ty pen-
od of its creation rendered signal service
to the Union. . The increase of the num
ber of seamen in the public service from
7,000 men in the Spring of 1861, to
about 24000 at the present time, has been
accomplished without special legislation
or extraordinary bounties to cromote
that increase. Tt has been found, howev
er, that the operations of the draft with
high bounties paid for army recruits, is
begining to effect, injurioosly the naval
service and will, if not corrected, be like
ly to impair its efficiency by detaching
seamen from their proper vocation and
inducing them to enter the arm-. 1,
therefore, resjectiWy suggest that Con
gress might aid both the army and na
val service by adequate provision on this
subject which would at the same time be
equitable to the communities more es
pecially interested.
1 commend to your coisideratipn the
suggestions of the Secretary of the N.vy,
in regard to the policy of fossrering and
Graining seamen for naval servfee. The
aval Academy is rendering signal ser-
vice in preparing miasnipmen lor highly
responsible duties, which in after"life
they will be required to perform. In or
der that the country should not be de-
prived of the proper quota oUeducated
officers for which legal provision has
been made at the naval school, the va
cancies caused by the neglect or omis
sion to make nominations from the
States. in insurrection,, have been filled
by the Secretary of the Navy. The school
is now more full and complete than at
any previous period, and in every respect
entitled to the favorable consideration of
Congress.
During the past year the financial con
dition of the Post Office Department
has been one of increased prosperity, and
I am gratided to be able to state that the
accounts of Postal Revenue has nearly
equaled the entire expenditure, the latter
amounting to 1 l,ol4.000.84, and the
former to f Il.loo, (8V.-W, leaving a de-'
hciency of bdtf 150,41 i.2T. In 1860, the
Jear immediately preceding the rebel
ion, the deficiency amounted to $5,656,
705.4'J. The posjal receipts of that jear
were f2.645,722.:i!i less than those of
1862. The decrease, since I860, in the
annual amount of tranjportation. has
been only about 25 per cent, but the annn
al expenditures, on account of the same,
have been reduced 35 per cent. It is
manifest, therefore, that the Post Office
Department may become self-sustaining
in a few years, even with the restoration
ot the whole seryico.
The international conference of postal
dolega'es from the principal countries
of Europe and America which was called
at the suggestion of. the Post Master
General met at Paris on the 11th of
May last and concluded its deliberations
on the 8th of July. The principles es
tablished by the conference as best ad
apted to facilitate postal intercourse be
tween nations aud aa the baais of future
conventions, t inaugurate .a general
system of uniform international charges,
at reduced rates of postage, cannot fail
to produce beneficial reeustptrO :
I refer you to the report of the Secre
tary of the Interior, which is herewith
laid before yon, for rae useful and varied
information in relation to the public
lands, Indian, affairs, Patents, Pensions,
and other matters of public concern per-
i tity of lands disposed of during theTast
raining 10 mis uepariment. lnaquan
and first quarters of the present fiscal
ear was o.s41,'5'.' acres, of which 131. -911
acres were sold for cash; 1,466,514
acres were taken up under the Home
stead law, and the residue disposed of
under laws granting lands for nxititary
bounties, railroads, and other purposes.
It also appears that the sale of public
lands is largely on the increase. It has
long been a cherished opinion of some
of our wisest stateemen, that the
people of the United States had
a higher and more enduring
interest
ganiialion of colorea persons m tne war
in th? enrlr settlement and substantial
cultivation of the public lands than in
the amount of direct revenue to be de
rived from the sale of them. This opin
ion has had a controlling influence in
'innin;: legislation upoa the subject of
our national domain. I may cite, as an
instance of this, the liberal measures
adopted. in reference to actual settlers;
the grant to the States of the overflowed
lands within their limits, in order to
their being reclaimed and rendered fit
for cultivation; the grants to railroad
companies of alternate sections of lands
upon the contemplated lines of their roads
which, when completed, will largely mul
tiply the facilities of reaching our distant
possessions. This policy has received
its most signal and beneficial illustra
tion in the recent enactments granting
homesteads to actual settlers. Hi nee the
first day of January last the before men
tioned quantity of 1,450,514 acres of
land had been taken up under its pro
visions. This fact and the amount of
sales furnish a gratifying evidence of
the increasing settlements upon the pub
lic lands, notwithstanding the great strug
gle in which the energies of the nation
haVe been engaged, and which has re
quired so large a withdrawal of our citi
zens from their accustomed pursuits. I
cordially concur in the recommendation
of the Secretary of the Interior, suggest
ing a modification of the act in favor of
those engaged in the military and naval
service of the United States. T doubt
not that Congress will cheerfully adopt
such measures as will, without essential
ly changing the general features "of the
system, secure, to the greatest practica
ble cxtept, its benefits to those who have
left their homes in defense of their coun
try in this arduous crisis.
I invite your attention to the views of
the Secretary of War as to the propriety
of raising by appropriation of the Leg
islature a revenue from the mineral lands
of the United States.
The measures provided at yonr last
session for the removal of certain Indian
tribes have been carried into effect.
Sundry treaties have been negotiated
which will in due time be submitted for
the constitutional action of the Seuate.
They contain stipulations for extin
guishing the possessiouary rights of the
Indiana to large and valuable tracts of
land.
It is probable that the effects of these
treaties will result in the establishment
of permanent friendly relations with such
of those tribes as have been brought in-
to trequent and bloody collision with
our out-lying settlements and emigrants.
The sound poiiev and our imperative duty
to those Wards of the government demand
our anxious and constant attention to
their material well being, to their pro
gress in the arts of civilization and
aboye all to that moral training, which,
under the blessings of Uivioe Providence,
will confer upon them the elevating and
sanctifying influence of the hopes and
consolations of the Christian faith. I
suggested in uiy last annual message the
propriety of remodeling this Indian sys
tem. Subsequent events have satisfied
me of its necessity. The details set
forth in the report of the Secretary will
evince the urgent need of immediate
Legislative action.
1 commend the benevolent institutions
established or patronized by the Govern
ment in this District to your generous
and fostering care.
The attention of Congress during the
last session was engaged to some extent
with a proposition for enlarging the water
communications between the Mississippi
and the Northern Atlantic seaboard,
which proposition failed for the time.
Since which time, on a call of the great
est respectability, a Convention has been
called at Chicago, upon the same subject,
the summary of whose views is contained
in a memorial addressed to the President
Bim oongicsM, mm nincu J uow nave Uic
honor to iay before you. That this inter
est is one which will ere long force its
0 n way, I do not entertain a doubt
While it is submitted entirely to your
wisdom as to what can be done, now,
augmented interest is given to this sub
ject by the actual commencement of
work on the Pacific Railroad, under aus
pices favorable to its rapid progress and
completion. Enlarged navigation be
comes a palpable need to this great road.
Itransmit the Second Annua! Report of
the Commissioner of the Department of
Agriculture, asking your attention tothe
developments in that vital interest of the
nation.
When Congress assembled a year ago,
the war had already lasted nearly
twenty months, and there had been many
conflicts on both land and sea, with va
rying results, j a H
The rebellion had been'pre'ssed back
into reduced limits, yet the tone of pub
lic feeling at home and abroad was not
satisfactory. With other signs, the pop
ular elections just past, indicated uneasi
ness among ourselves, while amid much
that was told and menacing, the kindest
words coming trom England were utter-
j cd in accents of pity that we were too
Olind to surrender. Uur commerce was
suffering greatly by a few armed
vessels built upon and farnished from
foreign shores, and we wer threatened
with such additions from the same quar
ter as would sweep our trade from the
sea and- raise our blockade. We had
failed to elicit from European govern
ments anything hopeful upon this sub
ject. The Emancipation proclamation,
which was issued in September, was
running its assigned period to the be
ginning of the new year.
A month later the final proclamation
came, including the announcement that
.... V 1 r .. 1. 1 . , .
colored men of suitable condition would
be received into the war service.
The policy of emancipation, and the
employment of black soldiers, gave to
the future a new aspect, about which
hopes, fears and doubts, contended in
nncertain conflict According to our
political system, as a matter of civil ad
ministration, the General Government
has no lawful power to effect emancipa
tion in any State, aud for a long time it
bad been hoped tho rebellion could
have bean suppressed without resorting
to it as a military measure.
It was all the while deemed possible
that the necessity for it might come and
that if it should the crisis of the contest
would then be presented. It came, and
i as intended. It was followed by dark
and doubtful days.
Eleven months have been passed. We
are permitted to take an other review.
The rebel borders are pressed still farther
back, and by the complete opening of the
Mississippi River the country dominated
over by the rebellion is divided into dis
tant parts, and practical communication
between them severed. Teunessee and
Arkansas have been so substantially
cleared of insurgent control and influ
ence, that citizens in each, who were the
owners of slaves and advocates of slavery
at the beginning of the rebellion, now
declare openly for emaucipation in their
respective States.
Of those States not included in the
Emancipation Proclamation, in Mary
land and Missouri, neither of which, years
ago, would tolerate any whispering on the
extinction of slavery fn their territories,
the only dispute now is aa to the best
mode of removing it from their own
limits.
Of those who were slaves at the begin
ning' of the rebellion, folly 100,000 are
now in the United States military ser
vice, about one-half of which number
actually bear arms in the ranks; thug
giving the double, advantage of taking
so much labor from the insurgent cause,
and supplying the places which other
wise mnst be filled with so many white
men. So far as tested, it ia difficult to,
say they are not ar good soldiers as any.
No servile insurrection or tendency to
violence or cruelty lias marked the
measure of emancipation, ahdmrmitig
the blacks. Isu . JK fa. -
These measures have been much dis
cussed in foreign countries, and cotem
porary with such discussions the tone of
the public sentiment there was much im
proved. While the same measures have
been fully discassed, supported, critioized
and denounced7the annual elections are
especially encouraging to those whose
special duty it is to bear the country
through this great trial. Thus we have
the reckouiug. The crisis which threat
ened to divide the friends of the Union
is passed. poni' if a leo
Looking now to the present and the fu
ture, and with reference to-a resumption
of the National authority within those
States wherein that authority has been
suspended, I have thought lit to issue a
.Proclamation, a copy of which i here
with transmitted. Upon examination of
this proclamation, it will appear, as is
believed, amplv justified by the Constitu
tion. True, the form of an oath is given,
yet no man is coerced to take it. A nmu
is only promised a pardon in case he
voluntarily takes the oath. The Consti
tution authorizes the Executive to grant
it on terms as fully established by judi
cial and other authority.
It is also proposed that if any of the
States named desire to reunite with the
Government, it shall be in the mode pre
scribed and set up. Such Governuient
shall be recognized and guaranteed by
the United States, and that-under it the
State shall, on subscribing to the consti
tutional conditions, be protected against
invasion and domestic violence. The
constitutional obligation of the United
States to guarantee to every State in the
Union a republican form of government
and to protect the same, is explicit and
full But why tender the benefits of this
proclamation only to a State government
set up in this particular way I liius sec
tion of the Constitution contemplates a
case wherein the element within a State
favorable to a Repubheau government
in the Union may be too feebla
for an opposite and hostile element
external to. and even within the State;
and such arc precisely the case with
which we are now,. dealing. An attempt
to guarantee and protect a revised state
of Government constructed in wlioie or
in a preponderating part from the very
element against whose hostility and vio
lence it is to be protected, ig simply ab
surd. I here must be a test by winch to
separate the opposing elements so as to
build only from the sound one: and that
test is a sufficient and liberal ,oy,e, which
accepts as sound wuoevcr win maKe a
sworn recantation of his former unsound
ness. Uut it it be proper to requixe a
test ot admission to the political body.
an oath of allegiance to the Constitution
of the United States aud the Union uuder
it, why not also to the law and proclama
tion in regard to slavery? Those laws
and proclamation were enacted and put

enacted. Togiveupthis principle would
be not only to rolinquish a lever ol' pow

altogether, or gr.ant upon the terms which
he shall deem wisest fop-pullic intrer
It should be oSservod also that thiTpart
of the oath is subject to the ..modifying
and abrogating power of legislation.
The proposed acjjuiescsiMie of the Na
tional Executive in any honorable tem
porary State arrangement for the freed;
people, is made with a view of possibly
modifying the confusion, distress and
destitution which must at last attend
all classes, by a total revolution of labor
throughout the whole State. It is hoped
the already deeply afflicted in those States
may be somewhat more ready to give up
the cause of their affliction, and to this
extent This vital matter is left to them
selves. While no power of the National
Execntive to prevent an abuse 13 abridg
ed by this proposition, the suggestion in
in the proclamatiou, as to maintain
ing the political framework of the
States on what is called reconstruc
tion, is made in the hope that it may
do good without harm. It will favor
labor and avoid great confusion. But
why any proclamation now, upon this
subject? This question is beset with
the conflicting views that the step might
be delayed too long or be taken too soon.
In some, the elements for resumption have
been ready for action, but remain inactive ;
apparently for want or a rallying point
a plan of action. Why shall A adopt
the plan of B, rather than B that of A?
And if A and B should agree, how can
t.hpv know that the fiener.il (iiivcrnmAni
here will respecttheir plan. By the Pro-
elamation, a plan is presented wL
may be accepted by them as a rallying
rpoint and which they are assured in ad
I r . . . ... ,
vance win not be rejectea nere. ihis
may bring them to act sooner than they
otherwise would. The objection to a
premature presentation of a plan by the
National Executive, consists in the dan
ger of commitments in points which
could be more safely left to further de
velopments. Care has been taken to so
shape the document as to avoid embar
rassment from this source. Iu saying
that on certain terms certain .classes
will be pardoned, with their rights re
stored, it is not said that other classes on
other terms will never be included.
In tayhrg that a reconstruction will
be accepted if presented in a spec
ified way, it is not said that it will
never be accepted in any other way.
The movements by State actions for
emancipation in several of the States
not included in the Emancipation Proc
lamation, are matters of profound con
gratulation, and while I do not repeat in
detail what I have heretofore so earnest
ly urged upon this subject, my general
views and feelings remain unchanged,
and I trust that Congress wiH opiit no
fair opportunity of aiding tnese import
ant steps to the great consummation.
In the midst ot' other cares, however
important, we must not lose sight of the
fact tL-t the War Power is still our main
reliance. To that power alone ean we
look yet for a time, to give confidence to
the people in the contested regions that
the insurgent power will not again over
run them. Cntii that confidence shall
be established, little can be done any-'
where for what is called reconstruction
Hence onr chiefest cake must still be di
rected to our army and navy, who have
thus far borne their harder part so nobly
and well, and it may be esteemed fortu
nate that in giving the greatest efficien
cy to their indispensable arms, we do ,
also honorably encourage gallant men,
from commander to Ren-tineT, who com
pose them, and to whom, more, than .all
others, the world must stand indebted
for tbe home of freedom, disenthralled,
regenerated, enlarged and perpetuated.

PROCLAMATION.
The following proclamation is append
ed to the message:
WiiF.REaa, On and by the Constitution j
of ;iie United Stajtes it if provided thut j
the President shall Lave power to grant
reprieves and pardons for offences against
the United States except in cases rf im-
-peachment? -f
And Whereas, A rebellion now exists
whereby loyal States, and the Govern
ment of several States have, for a long !
tima been subverted, many persons have ,
committed and are now guilty of treason
agninsfc the United States;
Axd Wnwhs.ts, In reference ts said re-'
hellion and treason, laws have been enact- !
ed by Congress declaring the forfeiture
and confiscation of property and the liber- j
ation of slaves, all upon terms and condl-
lions therein stated; and also declaring
that the President was thereby authori
zed at tiriytvme thereafter by Proclama
tionto extend to persons who may have
participated in the existing rebellion, in
any State or- part thereof, pardon and
amnesty, with such exceptions and on
such conditions as he may deem expedi
ent for the public welfare;
v,- ass-.- ii,,-:- Miirf.ii
and v hereas, 1 he Congressional dec
laration for limited and-conditional nar-
don, accorded with well-established judi
cial expositions of the pardoning power;
And whereas, With reference to said
ebellion. the President of the United
States has issued several proclamations,
witJi provisions in regard to the libera
tion ot slaves;
And W hereas, It is now desired by
some persons, heretofore engaged in said
rebellion, to resume their allegiance to
the United States, and re-inaugurate
loyal State Governments within and for
their respective States, therefore. I.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of
the United States, do proclaim, declare
and make known to all persons wbo
haye directly, or by implication,- par
ticipated in the existing rebelliou,
except as hereinafter excepted, that
a full pardon is granted to them,
and each of them, for the restora
tion of all their rights, if third parties
shall have intervened and upon the condi
tion that every such person shall take
and subscribe an oath and thenceforward
keep and maintain said oath inviolate,
and which oath shall be registered for
permanent preservation and shall be of
the tenor and effeet of the following, to
wit : I do solemnly swear in presence of
Almighty God that I will henceforth
faithfully support, protect and defend the
Constitution of the -United States and the
Union of the States therunder, and that
I will in like manner abide by, and faith
fully support all acta of Congress passed
during the existing rebellion with refer
ence to slaves so loug and so far as not
yet repealed, modified or held void by
Congress or by decision of the Supreme
Court And that I will in like manner
abide by and faithfully support all the
proclamations of the President, made
during the existing rebellion, having
reference to slaves, so long and so far as
not modified or declared void by decision
of tho Supreme Court So help me
'(Sod. ,
The persons excepted from the benefits
of the foregoing provisions are all who
are or shall have been civil or dit
lomatio officers or agents of the
so-called Confederate Government; all
who have left Judicial positions under
the United States to aid tne rebellion, or
vho shall have been military or n-jval
officers of the rank of Colonel in the
army or Lieutenant in the navy. All who
left seats in the United States Congress
'o aid in the rebellion. All who resign
ed their commissions in the army and
navy of the United States, and afterwards
' aided the rebellion. And all who have en
gaged in any way in treating colored per-
1 sons, or white persons in charge of such,
oHktwho thfin lawfully as prisoners of
t j ji- 1. . . .
war, aim wnicu persona may De lounu 111
t,,c United States service
as soldiers,
Seamen, or in ahy other capacity. And
I do further proclaim, declare aiid make
known that whenever iu any of the States
ol'Arkansas-jTexaSjLoiiisiana.Mississippi,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida,
Sonth'Carolihii and North Carolina, a
number of persona, not less than one
tenth of the number of the votes cast in
such State at the Presidential slection
in the year of our Lord, 1860, each hav
ing taken the oath aforesaid, and not
having since violated it, and being a
qualified voter by tho election laws of
the State existing immediately before the
so:called act of secession and excluding
all others, Bhall establish a State gov
ernment, which shall be Republican in
form, and no wise contravening eaid
oath, such shall be recognized
as the true government of the State, shall
receive there "under the benefits of the
constitutional provision, which declares
that the United States shall guarantee to
every State in this Union a republican
form of government, and shall protect
them against invasion, ou application of
the Legislature, or Executive, when the
Legislature cannot be convened, against
domestic violence.
And I do further proclaim, declare and
make known, that any further provision
which may be adopted by said State
government, in relation to the freed
people of such State, it shall re
cognize and declare them permanently
freed, and shall provide for their edu
catiou, and which may yet be consistent
as a temporary arrangement with their-
present condition as a laboring, landless
a,1l homeless class, wiil not be objected
to by the National Executive. And it
is suggested as not improper that in
constructing a loyal Stats government
in any State, the name, the boundary, the
subdivision, the constitution and the fed
eral code of laws, as before the rebellion,
be maintained, subject only to modi
fications made necessary by the condi
tions hereinbefore stated and such others,
if any, contravening said conditions which
may be deemed expedient by those fram
ing the new State Government. To avoid
misunderstanding it may be proper to
say that this proclamation, so far as it
relates to State Governments, has core
ference to States wherein loyal State
Governments have all tbe while been
maintained, and for the same reason it
may be proper to further say that when
their members of Congress from any
State shall be admitted to seats constitu
tionally rests exclusively with the
! respective Houses, and not to any
extent witu the .executive; and still
further, that this proclamation is in
tended to present to the people of the
States therein the national authority has
been suspended, and loyai State Govern
ments have been subverted, a mode by
which the national authority over every
loyal State Government may be estab
lished within said States, or any of them.
Aad while the mode presented is the
best the Executive can suggest, with his
present impressions, it must not be un
derstood that another possible mode
would not be acceptable.
Given ander my hand, at the City of i
Washington, this 8th day of December,
Anno Domini, one thousand cijrht 4iun- i
dred and sixty-three, and of the Inde-
penitence ot lite united states ot Amei
ica, eighty-eight.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
