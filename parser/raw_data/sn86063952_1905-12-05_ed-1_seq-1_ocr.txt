The statehood plank of the President's message Is as fet- O
tows: O
I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admit- O
ted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted O
as one state. There Is n. obligation upon us to treat territorial O
subdivisions, which are matUrs of convenience only, as binding, us o
en the question of admission to statehood. Nothing has taken tip O
more time In the congress during the past few years than the O
question as to the statehood to be granted to the feur territories O
above mentioned, and "after careful eensldemtlen ef all that has O
been developed tn the discussions ef the question I recommend O
thaftey be Immediately admitted as two states. There Is no Q
justification for furtlisr delay; and the advisability of makinn, the O
four territories Into two states has bten oltarly established. O
In some of the territories the legislative assemblies Issue O

Is to meet tho dinngcd conditions in
such inannor as will prevent tho com
monwealth abdicating tho power it has
always powoasd, not only in this coun
try, but also In litagkmd before and
since this country beoanie n separate
nation.
Ilnlfroml llnie tiCRlnladou.
As 1 sahl in my message of lec. 0
last, the immediute ami most pressing
med so far as legislation is concerned
is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the" rates charged by -the rail
reads of the country engaged in Inter
state traffic ns shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the imposition of mi.
Juit or unreasonable rates. It must
r..;-.. mil lug ji completo stop to re
bates lu ovary 'Shape n.id form. This
power to regulate ratos, llko nil similar
pof crs over tbw business worH, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint, but it should oxist,
so that It can be effectively exorcised
when tho need arises.
lu my Judgmout, tho most Important
provision which such law should con
tain Is Hint conferring upon somo eom
potent administrative body the power
to decide upo)j tho case being brought
before It whclhor n given rato pro
scribwJ by a railroad Is reasonable and
just, and if It Is found to bo unreason
able and unjust then, nftor full inveslli
gatlou of the complaint, to praccrlbo
tho limit of re to beyoud which it shall
not be lawful to go tho maximum
reasonable rnte, ns It Is commonly call
ed this decbrion to go Into offset with
in a reasonable flmo and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometlmss happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
ored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such oaw the commission would
have the right to fix tills already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and It would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
railroad companies of tha practice of
giving improper minimum rates. I call
your attention to tho fact that my pro
posal is uot to give lite commission
power to lnltiato or ortglnato rata gen
erally, but to regulate a rato nlreudy
llxexl or originated by the roads upon
complaint nnd after investigation, A
heavy penally should be exacted' from
nuy corporation which fa!W to respect
an order or the commlaaiou. I regard
thli power to establish n maximum

Trip.
Fdss, Okla., Dec. 6v The pooplo of
this place an3 vlolnlty were tnectatoB
of a thrilling and halr-raUUng scono
Saturday night that will hold thorn
In awe for a long time. Hundreds had
gathered to witness a balloon ascen
sion by an experienced aeronaut. The
immense air shtp was cut loose and iu
it rose quickly Into npace the people
were startled by the bight of a man
hanging to one of the balloon ropes.
He was Shorty Jenkins, a townsman,
who was accidentally caught In the
tope and carried a distance of 4,000
feet Into the air. The parachute was
cut off at a distar.ee or 2,000 feet and
the aeronaut proeei led to come back
to earth The balloon, however, kept
ou going, with Jenkins clinging to the
rope for his life He managed to hang
on and came down with the balloon
uniujured except for badly blistered
hands, a sprained ankle and a nervous
system. It was an awful experience
for Shorty, and a terrible sight for the
people of Foes

fact that ho again inserted tho capital

though k i , . -ot quite so bitter a pill
as the congressional apportionment. C.
G. Jones has said that he did not care
to go to congress, That is natural, but
he does. Dennis Flynn wants it under

but that is not so, olthsr. Whilo Jones
Is glad that It practically cute Dennis
out of any future attempt, vot it mnkcm
his own chances slim litfrnWo'tn ti.tni

'i ' ,w r
out by Delognto McGulre It is about a
stand-off between tho Republicans and
Democrats, with the chances in favor
of tho Domocratc Jonos has always
noted as tho fathor ot slnglo statehood,
and tho fondest hopo of his life is that
statohood might be granted this win
tor, then ho will claim a big slice Of tho
victory It Is a fact thac he Is ono' of
tho best advocated of Joint statohood
In the torrltory, and has probably
worked hardor for it than tho prosent
dologato hlmsolf. If Jonos could see
his efforts win this winter thero is not
tho slightost doubt but that ho would
asplro for congressional honors, but
now McGuiro has Interferred by mak
ing this district almost sure Demo
cratic, while in his own district he will
have about 4,000 majority Republican
That's what hurts nert, and it hurts
hard, too.
When the single statehood special
leaves for Wnshington Wednesday
evening, Mr. Jones will take with him
petitions lKne'd by at least 50,000 peo
ple of t' two territories asking that
congress let . people decide the cp
Ital and prohibition matters. These
petitions will be presented along with
other resolutions passed by statehood
conventions from time to time. The
delegation Is going prepared to fight
for these concessions, and If they do
not get them, It Is not certain that any
kind of statehood will be secured. This
Is not guesswork, because it Is the sen
tlment of those who are winoere about
wanting statehood, but thty do not
want It with a lot of legislation wrap
ped up and delivered to the people who
are to live under It without as much as
expressing their wishes about It.
Thero are several Republicans here
who would like to play good to McGulre
but that has been given a severe blow
since hie statehood bill was printed In
full, showing how he has fixed things
to suit himself, in fact the delegate
has not considered the Oklahoma City
end with much favor When he wishes.
to hold a conference here he seeds for
Cash Cade from Shawnoe, Chnrloy Fll
son from Guthrie, and John Dillon from
Geary, and with possibly ono txcep
tlon, the fellows here wait on the out
side to gather what bite of Information
come from stories fixed for public use
But It is a forogono conclusion that thu
dologato will not got the support from
now on from tho ones horo who could
do him some good. It Is thought here
that, while Jonos and Flvnn havo nav.
or bg"on on the best of torms, that Mo-
GGuire is making a way whereby both
tho former will combine against him in
any move he might mukp lu the future.
Jones does not want to appear to be a
knocker, and he really wants stato
hood, and he will do his bust to get It
but he- Is sore at McGulre, and refuse
to lie pacified.
