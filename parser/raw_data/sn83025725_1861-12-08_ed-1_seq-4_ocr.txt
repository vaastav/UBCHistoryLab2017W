The fiev. Or. Palmer bein: necesarilr
absent from the city in attendance at the
General As3etnby of the Presbyterian
Uhurcly sitting at Augusta, hie pvupit
was yesterday supplied by the Kev. ;Lr,
Bice, late of Louisville, Kentucky, whence
he has been compelled, on account of his
hearty sympathy in our glonoti cause,
to flee. He will officiate for Dr. Palmer
for two or three weeks to come.
Dr. Bice selected for his text, yester
day morning, the striking ver?o (the
loth) of the 22d chapter of Genesis,
which reads as follows: KAnd Abraham
called the name of that place Jehovah-
Jireh, as it is said to this day: In the
mount of the Lord it shall be seen." The
chapter, it will be remembered, gives that
touching and pathetic narrative of A bra
ham's ready sacrifice of his son Isaac, in
obedience to the divine command, given
to try his faith. The trial over, in accor
dance with the custom of that axe, the
patriarch gave a name to the place of its
occurrence, and that name, J ehovah-Ji-
reh, signifies,' literally, "The Lord will
see;" or, in effect, the Lord will see to it,
and provide. .
;The preacher crave a most interesting
and satisfactory exegesis of this scrip
ture, which ho described as the most sig
nificant and important in the sacred vol
Time. The incident which it records he
characterized as the first visible declara
tion of the great truth that He who made
the world and all it contains sustains
and regulates it by His providence. It
was also the earliest type given in scrip
tural history of that irreat doctrine of
sacrificial; substitution which prefigured
the last great sacrifice on Mount Calvary.
- The sermon was most eloquently de
livered, as well as most logically and con
vincingly conceived, and was listened 1o
by a large congregation with the deepest
interest. .
We have chosen this discourse as the
eubject of a few editorial remarks this
evening, not byway of reviewing or crit
icising it as a whole, but only for the
purpose of referring to one suggestion
which it contained, and that is just now
of peculiar interest to us as a people : the
zreat fact that the Maker - and Euler of
all created things still "sees and pro
vides" for the needs of His creatures. -
The preacher, in this connection, alluded
to the btrikin manifestations of Divine
Providence in behalf of this nascent and
struggling nation, which, from the very
commencement to the present period of
this war, have been so signally display
ed. The finger of God has been plainly
visible in the conduct and results of the
struggle, on our part, and this has been
frequently recognized by the Chief Mag
istrate of the Confederacy, in his calls
upon the people to acknowledge it, by
devoting days to religious observance.
N 1 -t it?- ? A. 1
ajt. race, wxuxe upon vais point, urgeu
upon nis nearers tne consideration mat
there oould be no such thing as a nation-?
al recognition of the hand of Heaven
as guiding its affairs and protecting: its
interests, without personal and individu
al purity of principle and purpose. Ev-;
ery member of tne community snouia
practically evince his belief and trusting
and his gratitude to, an overruling if rov
idenee, by doing to the utmost, every
one his own part, the work of deserving
the favor so signally manifested. This
obligation involves the sacred and para
mount duty of sacrificing self on the al
tar of patriotism. It imposes upon every
one the. duty of submitting to privation,
not only of its luxuries, but even some
of the necessaries of 4ife, if, by such re
linquishment, the cause in which we are
engaged may be benefited and advanced.
This is no time for extravagant expen
ditures for personal luxuries. While our
soldiers are in the field, enduring all the
hardships of camp-life, or meeting the
common enemy, in deadly strife, or ly-
g, sick, wounded, needy, ana percnance
dying, in the crowded hospital, it is
hardly short of criminal in as, who stay
at home by our peaceful firesides, pursu
ing our business and our pleasures, while
these men are fighting our battles, or are
suffering in consequence of having done
so, to indulge in extravagant and need
less waste of money. It is all very well
to pretend to be grateful for the boons
bestowed by a kind and favoring Provi
dence, but it should be remembered that
"God helps those who help themselves,"
and the best way to evince our gratitude
for such blessings is to show that we
inow how to make a proper use of them.

Sautttcru Sentiment And Feeliiijr
The Richmond Examiner, in its comments
on the president's Message, graphically and
truly describe? the sentiments and feelings
of the people of the South upon the subject
of. re-union with the Yankees. Every, word
in the following passage of its excellent ar
ticle, gays the Petersburg. Kxpress, will be
cordially enclor.e'l by every man,' woman
and chili in the Confederate States, save the
tories in Western. Virginia ' and Eat Ten
neiwje. Let the Yankees "read, ponder, and
inwardly digest" what is here written, for it
sjH'aks a purpose of the South which is as
fixed as fate, and that purpose is,. never to
submit, to the-1 degradation of a re-union
with them upon any terms. Should it. be
the will of Providence to inflict upon "us a
succession of ruinous defeats which would
leave no hujc of accomplishing our inde
pendence, wc would consent and propose to
be a dependency of any foreign Power be
fore we would be again in membership with
the Yankee political household. .. . j
Says the Examiner . '. .
"The President does but echo a sentiment
inerradicable in the minds of our people
wheu he announces to the Congress, and
through them to the civilized world, that the
Reparation between us and the North is fin
al, and that no efforts on their part no re
sistency in their wicked endeavors-to sub
jugate us will never bring us again under
a common nag. Of onr ability to maintain
ourselves, unaided ancT alone, we entertain
no sort of doubt. We know, too, that we are
"master of the situation." and that ere we
are prostrated, five millions of British ope-
uves will be deprived of bread, and anar
chy become the doom of their country. But
if our condition were indeed desperate, if
our arms were not equal to the manly 're
solve, to be free with which we set - out; if
indeed Providence seemed to desert us and
to frown on our righteous quarrel, there are
yet alternatives which our people would hail
with joy in preference i to living under the
rule of a race so hated and infamous. Bet
ter the reign of a British or French sover-
eign; better uie rule or the Autocrat of
Russia: be' ter any despot; any rule or any
fate, than to be allied with the wretches who I
are invading our soil, burning our homes,
and polluting our hearths. No fate could
be eo abject, no portion so bitter, as alliance
with them." . .;'.., V
