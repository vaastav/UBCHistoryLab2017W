IN PEACEPACT
UNLOOKED FOR
Administration Leaders to Play
"Watchful Waiting" Game
Believing Popular Demand
for Ratification Is Near.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The attitude
dt the administration today with re
card to the peace treaty waa that of
watchful waiting."
declaring
__________ that a great popular de
mend for ratification will come from
»'• > country within a few weeks. Pres
ident Wilson is keeping "handii off" the
present situation waiting for this urge
to materialise according to numer
ous Indications.
The president refrained from direotly
mentioning the treaty in his message
to congress, it is believed with the idea
that further argument was useless.
The need for it. friends of the ad
ministration predict, will steadily be
come more apparent. They are looking
for events to convince the people that
the treaty Is desirable and that no,
other means of bringing about official
pence will do. The president s silence,
they assert, does not mean that he has
given tip the fight or that he is any
less interested in ratification than
when he toured the country appealing
loi It. Thul ne is 'wrapped up In the
treaty" was the expression used by
some of his advisers In describing the
a.luation.
. Hecommendution of AVilson for a
third term by the state convention at
Pierre, S. I)., was interpreted by the
president's supporters as endorsement
of the treaty and as an answer to the
arguments of those who claim the
pact is iu dead that the Democrats
Mill not want f> exhume it and make
It an Issue in lil-'O.
Opponents of the treaty openly scoff
rt the iriei that the nation will de
mand ratification. Many congressmen
i" turning to Washington after talking
lo their constituents say there is prac
t'cnlly no interest in the treaty and
that the people are rapidly forgetting
i' ami devoting their attention to the
coal shortage and other pressing do
mestic problems.

not favored by American border offi
cials for a showdown, but contributes
to show Carranza's "lack of good
faith," they say.
3. Merc Americans are in Mexico
than at any time since the exodus
which followed President Taft's first
warning to Americans to leave that
revolution-ridden country. Americans
have flocked into the Tampico oil re
gions. The boom in the silver market
has resulted in hundreds of American
returning to Mexican camps and smel
ter plants.
SLEEP BEHIND 8TOCKADE8.
In Parral, the Americans sleep
nightly behind a stockade, heavily
armed and with sentries on guard to
prevent a surprise assauli. The "last
straw" may be another murder of an
American. Kail's charges of the spread
of Bolshevist propaganda in the United
States with the connivance of Mexi
cans and with the knowledge of Car
ranza are said to be equalled by al
leged evidence of Mexican I. \V. W.
plots, pro-Gorman activity, suspicion
directed at Japan and Mexico in the
Magdalena Bay case, witli which the
1-os Angeles hearing will deal and
tostlmony of Carranza's rabid anti
Americanism.
Following introduction of Senator
J'all's resolution in congress lo seevr
diplomatic relations with Mexico the
herder today figuratively rang with
rumors. That tlic marines would "go
in and get Jenkins" and that the war
department's plans for Invading Mex
io were expected at headquarters here
ioday so that preparations could be
made were .products of the rumor
factory.
i-ITTLE ACTIVITY.
The only visible unusual activity in
the border army was arrival of a num
ber of army automobile mechanics who
atartod work of clearing out carbon in
the motors of camouflaged tanks here.
C'andido Aguilar, son-in-law of Car
ranza, Is said to he in Spain pur
chasing arms and ammunition. His
activities are being closely watched
by American secret service men. Ar
rival of a Mexican munitions ship in
gulf waters at a critieul time should
relations reach the breaking point
might mean another Vera Cruz issue.
Non-interventionists, however, still
hoped that President Wilson would
block war; that the maneuvers of the
X.rssldenttsl campaign in the United
Btatea would postpone a Mexican war
•t least until after 1920, or hoped that
an "Iron man" would arise In Mexico
to paclf' ; ' -Itably for America.

London, Dec. 4.—The race between
Crptain Ross Smith, British aviator,
and Etienne Poulet. French, In their
attempted flights to Australia, had
narrowed down to a 46 minute margin
in favor of the British flyer, according
to latest reports received by the air

DEMOCRATS AND
(Continued fiom page one.)
ers deny they have this possibility In
mind In delaying.
Glass, in his annual report to con
gress. declared the excess profits tax
"encourages wasteful expenditure, puts
a premium on over capitalisation and
a penalty on brains discourages new
ventures and confirms old ventures In
their monopolies.
He also puts upon it part of the
blame for high prices.
"I do not think the ways and means
committee Is likely to follow this sug
gestion." was Representative Green's
r.nswer to Glass. Green, next to Chair
man Fordney, Is ranking member of
the committee.
OBJECTIONABLE FEATURES
"There are many objectionable fea
tures connected with the excess profits
tax. but the reduction in rates will
riltlgate its application," Green contin
ued. "It lias one merit that is often
overlooked, namely that only those
who are making a high profit pay It."
To make up for the loss through
abolition of the profits tax Glass sug
rested a raise In the normal Income tax
rate and a raise in the surtax rats on
medium sized Incomes.
To this. Green says:
"It would be extremely difficult to
obtain the amount produced by the
excess profits tax from Incomes. It
is well known that the multimillion
aires are transferring their holdings to
tax exempt securities. I think the
e ,me result would follow if we under
look to establish Intermediate rates
u.i suggested by the secretary's re
port."
GERMAN CLAIM

showed plainly that Reuter had re
ceived communications from hit, gov
ernment.
Copies of von Reuter's sinking or
der also were discovered In the Em
den, the statement said.
One of the communications now In
possession of the admiralty is a letter
dated May 9 from the chief of the
German admiralty to von Reuter.
This letter said the fate of the In
terned German fleet would be decided
at Versailles and that it wag the "duty
of the German delegates to safeguard
tlie ships and to arrive at a solution
in accordance with German traditions
and rights. The first condition is
that the ships remain German. Their
fate will not be decided without co
operation.
"Surrender to the enemy Is out of
the question."
Von Reuter's order for the sinking
of the fleet was quoted In the admir
alty statement as follows:
"Commanding officers are ordered to
make necessary arrangements for the
sinking of ships. It should be en
sured that each vessel sinks as rap
idly as possible after receipt of the
order."
The vessels were to be sunk upon
personal orders from von Reuter or
in event the British tried to take for
cible possession, the statement said. If
the Germon government agreed to turn
over the vessels to the allies then von
Reuter said he would do so.
Commodore Sinclair's statement
pointed out that German ships ar
rived at 8caps Flow on June 1". "Cu
riously enough." he added, "It was on
June 17 that von Reuter Issued his
! sinking orders."
I Von Reuter still is interned St Don
ington.

Sum of $10,000.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 4.—Bench
warrants were being sent throughout
the country today for the arrest of 24
leaders of the United Mine Workers
charged with violation of the govern
ment's antl-strtke Injunction. The tech
nical oharge is criminal contempt of
courL
John L. Lewis, acting president of
the miners was to appear before U. 8 .
Marshal Mark Stören today to givs
bond of 910,000. Other union leaders
who were to accompany Lewis to Stor
en's office and take the same action
were W. E. Green, secretary-treas
urer; Ellis Searles, editor of the Mine
Workers Journal; Edward Stewart,
president of the Indiana district, and
William Mitch, secretary for Indiana.
The basis of the action against the
miners' leaders In 16 specific and sev
eral general charges, is that they failed
10 put the union asal on the order can
celling the strike call. The general
charge against the 24 defendants is
that they "jointly and severally, know
ingly, wilfully ignored, violated and
disobeyed the temporary restraining
order and that they are now further
Jointly and severally, knowingly and
wilfully Ignoring and violating the in
junction."
ATTORNEY GENERAL
HAS MUCH EVIDENCE
Washington, Dec. 4.—Attorney Gen
oral Palmer today had a great mass of
evidence in connection with activities
of leaders in the coal strike,
Assisted by C. G. Ames, assistant
attorney general, Palmer is sorting the
evidence for use when the leaders of
the United Mine Workers will go be
fore Federal Judge Anderson in Indi
anapolis charged with contempt of
court.
Ames will leave here Sunday for In
dianapolis to direct the government's
side of the case. This has not yet been
definitely settled, however. Presenta
tion of the government's case may be
left to Dan W. Sims, of LaFayette, In
dlana. special United States district
attorney.
If Ames remains here it will be be
cause his presence is needed to take
charge of the collection of additional
evidence, officials said today.
Special agents of the justice depart
ment are stationed in end near every
coal field. These men have been at
work since November 8. They have
ctowded several files at the head of
fices here with the story of the ac
tivities of local miners leaders, it was
learned.
The evidence collected, not yet made
public, is understood to be a most ex
act description of the daily lives of the
1 traders.
Coal operators meeting herhjoday
frame a new wage scale in keeping
with the 14 per cent wags advance
recommended by Fuel Administrator
Garfield, expressed satisfaction with
the government's course.
The contempt citation is a step to
ward normal production operators said.
Within the mine workers' organisation
there is a faction they said that has
been against the strike from the start.
These men will be enabled to return
to work without violating union regu
lations as a result of the government's
action, according to operators.
Garfield was expected to go into
conference with Attorney General
Palmer and officials of the railroad
administration immediately upon his
îeturn to AVashington today.
