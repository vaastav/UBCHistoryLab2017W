ville, Dec. B.—Au officer of tlie general

field shows little change, it is stated.

expected here.
LATE WAR NEWS SUMMARY
Official advices from Berlin to-day
confirm the reports that the allies have
assumed the offensive in France and
Belgium, but do not indicate that the
movement has yet grown to formidable
proportions. The attacks, it is said, have
been few in number and have been de
feated. Private dispatches from Holland
are to the effect that fierce fighting is
in progress along the Yser Canal. These
reports' are in partial agreement with
the latest official French communica
tions, which, however, tend to show
that the forward movement of the al
lies is being attempted at points all
along the lines.
Berlin is already looking toward the
possible investment of Warsaw, as a re
sult of the capture of Lodz, Russian Po
land. It was said officially at the Ger
man capital to-day that news of de
cisive results in the campaign against
the Russians may be expected at any
time, and that latest reports from the
military headquarters lead to the belief
that "operations thus far have been
successful." It is reported unofficially

THE STORM CENTER GOES
TRAVELING OUT TO SEA
Weather Bureau Says Precipitation Is
Ended Although It Will Be Cloudy
To-night and To-morrow—Little
Prospect of Cold
While it will take some time to re
pair the damage caused by the Atlan
tic seacoast storm, the fog end of
which has been felt in this city in the
last few days, there is uot likely to
be any further damage iu this vicinity
or throughout the Kast. The storm
center has moved off the Now Jersey
co(|pt and beyond a high surf. Weather
Bureau officials expect no further de
velopments.
There was some belief that following
on the heels of this storm a high pres
sure area from the northwest would
find its way South, but belated weath
er reports coming into the local office
of the Weather Bureau showed at noon
to-day the presence of another depres
sion of moderate strength from the west
which will likely give cloudy weather
here and keep the temperature slightly
above normal for the next few days.
Weather Bureau officials have very
little hope of clear cold weather in
the near future, although there is ao
depression of strength, enough to cause
precipitation, according to the fore
casters.
To-day's forecast for Harrisburgi
reads: "Generally cloudy to-night and
Wednesday. Not much change in tem
perature."
The lowest temperature registered
in Harrisburg in two days has been the
freezing point and that occurred during
last night, the mercury being two de
grees lower than the" minimum mark
of the previous night. Although the

faint hopes of her recovery. She is a

By Associated I'rcas,
Washington, Dec. B.—President Wil
son, in his annual address to Congress
to-day, gave Iris answer to those who
contend the United States is unprepared
for national defense.
"Let there be no misconception, 1 '
he said. "The country lias beeu mis

of national defense. We are not unmind
ful of the great responsibility resting
upon us. We shall learn and profit by
the lesson of every experience and ev

needed will be adequately done.''
Assembled in joint session in the hall
of the House, Senators and Representa
tives heard the President reading his
address in person from the clerk's desk,
outline the administration legislative
program and voice a fervent hope that
the United States might he instrumental

"It is said in some quarters that
