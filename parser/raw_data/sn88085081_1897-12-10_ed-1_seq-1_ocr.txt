SHELTON. MASON COUNTY, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10 1897.
The remedy for these conditions does not
lie in cosmetics. Skin disease is caused by
impurities in the blood, and by nervous
disorders due to weakness and disease of
the distinctly feminine organism. Doctor
Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery is the
greatest of all known blood-purifiers. It
not only drives all impurities from the life
stream, but fills it with the rich, life-giving
elements of the food. Dr. Pierce’s Favor
ite Prescription acts directly on the delicate
and important organs that bear the burdens
of wifehood and motherhood. It makes
them pure, strong, well and vigorous. A
course of these two great medicines will
transform a weak, sickly, nervous, despond
ent woman, who suffers from unsightly
eruptions of the skin, into a healthy, happy,
amiable companion, with a skin th;U is
clear and wholesome. These medicines
are made from herbs and roots, and contain
no minerals of any description. They sim
ply assist the natural processes of assimila
tion, secretion and excretion. Medicine
dealers sell them.
It is a druggist’s business to give you, not
to tell you, what you want.
“ About four years ago.” writes Thomas Har
ris, of Wakefield Station. Sussex Co., Va., “my
daughter Helen was afflicted with eczema in a
distressing form. Dr. Pierce’s medicines cured
her after all other remedies had failed.”
In sending for a free copy of Dr. Pierce’s
Common Sense Medical Adviser, enclose
2i one-cent stamps, to cover mailing only,
if a paper-covered copy is desired, or 31
stamps for cloth - binding. Address Dr.

Largest Receipts of Wheat.
Last week ended the banner month
in the wheat trade in Tacoma, More
wheat came into Tacoma than has
ever been recorded since the grain in
spection law’s went into effect in 1895,
although the 30ths, receipts amount
ed to only 20 cars, against 103 cars
the day before. The receipts for the
past three months were as follows:
In September 1720 cars received.
In October 1922 cars received.
In November the receipts reached
the enormous figure of 2,147 cars,
amounting to 1,618,838 bushels or 48,-
565 tons.
The aggregate amount for the three
mouths in bushels is 4,330,338 bushels.
The largest receipts of any previous
month were in Septernper, 1896, when
1,729 cars were inspected.
More bleached wheat has been re
ceived this month than in the two
months previous. The first part of
the season’s wheat was shipped from
the Walla Walla country, where har
vesting commenced earlier and the
crops thereby escaped the damage that
the grain of the Big Bend and Palouse
countries experienced from the late
rains.
Heavy shipments are anticipated
from near Colfax, in the Palouse coun
try, as large sales are reported from
that district.—Ledger.
Mr. C. M. Dixon, a well know mer

which always affords prompt relief.

One hundred Democrats met in a
love feast in Seattle recently. Al
though J. Hamilton Lewis, who was
made what lie is by Populists, and
though his speech was a cry in the
desert for fusion, yet no Populist was
invited to the feast. It is a case of
“we want your votes, but d your
company.—Hoquiam Washingtonian.
HOW TO FIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
urine and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment indicates an un
healthy condition of the kidneys,
when urine stains linen it is evidence
of kidney troubles. Too frequent de
sire to urinate or pain in the back, is
also convincing proof that the kidneys
and bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO 1)0.
There is comfort in the knowledge
so often expressed, that Dr, Kilmer’s
Swamp root, the great kidney remedy
fulfils every wish in relieving pain in
the back, kidneys, liver, bladder and
every part of the urinary passages. It
corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing it. or bad ef
fects following the use of liquor, wine
or beer, and overcomes that unpleas
necessity of being compelled to get up
many times during the night to uri
nal. The mild and the extraordinary
effect of Swamp Boot is soon realized.
It stands the highest for its wonderful
cures of the most distressing cases.
If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists,
price fifty cents and one dollar. You
may have a sample bottle and pam
phlet both sent free by mail. Mention

Republican conferences are the or
der of the day, as Senators and Repre
sentatives arrive in Washington.
President McKinley having finished
his annual message to Congress and
got it into the hands of the printers,
is devoting a considerable portion of
his time to conferring with prominent
members of the party as to the legisla
tion of the session. He is particularly
anxious that whatever party measures
are brought before Congress shall have
the united support of republicans, and
he is losing no opportunity to impress
that idea upon those with whom he
talks. While not expecting that all
his recommendations, financial or
otherwise, will be favorably acted up
on by Congress, lie believes that by
good management, some of them can
be put through. There are reasons
for the belief that a sufficient number
of feenators will under certain circum
stances vote with the republicans in
the Senate to pass several bills that
will greatly strengthen the adminis
tration and benefit the country. It is
not deemed expedient to specify these
measures at this time, but just wait
and see if the President does not just
ify his reputation as a harmonizer.
It is refreshing after reading the
numerous lingo schemes advanced
just now to find the following sensible
language in the annual report of the
Secretary of the Navy: “Additions
to our fleet may be hereafter necessary
to bring it up, in case of an emergency,
to an extent commensurate with the
growing necessities of the country,
especially in view of the development
of Alaska, which is a continent in
itself, and of the possible annexation
of islands in the Pacific. On the
other hand, it is a mistake not to
recognize that our Naval power has
more than doubled within the last few
years; that the case of any emergency
beyond our present resources is the
very rare case; that until it comes
ships will be gradually taken out of
commission and put into reserve in
order to reduce running expenses; and
that a due regard is necessary to the
relation of the National expenditures
to the National revenues. The de
partment therefore recommends that
the authorization of new ships by the
coming Congress, be limited to one
battleship for the Pacific coast, where,
after the five now under construction,
are completed, there will bo only two,
while on the Atlantic there will be
seven ; and also to a few torpedo boats
and torpedo boat destroyers, both of
which are comparatively of little cost,
and more of which are desirable in or
der to bring this swift, mobile, and
handily effective arm of the service
up to its place in the general scheme
for coast defense.”
Senator Pritchard, of North Caro
lina, Chairman of the Committee that
is, under a Senate resolution, investi
gating the workings of the civil ser
vice law, says the Committee will re
sume work during the first week of
the session of Congress, paying par
ticular attention to the internal reve
nue sea vice, and that its report will
probably be submitted to the Senate
early in January.
Ex-Speaker Keifer, of Ohio, is re
newing old acquaintances in Washing
ton. He says he isn’t in active poli
tics, but tries to know whats going on.
Of Ohio matters he says: “Senator
Hanna will be elected if he lives; no
possible combination can be made to
beat him,” and of the silver question;
“It is a very effete question in my
section. It is seldom that you hear
any mention of the subject in Ohio,
and out in Nebraska, where I visit my
oldest son occasionally, I observe that
there is really but little interest taken
in the 16 to 1 ideas. It is true that
the republicans were beaten this year
in Nebraska, but it was merely a re
buke administered by the voters on
account of the conduct of former re
publican state officials. Later, \ou
will see Nebraska getting back into
the republican column and the same
will be true of Kansas, where the
furore over free silver, has, I think,
permanently abated.”
The pains of rheumatism should be
reminded that a cure for this disease
may be found in Hood’s Sarsaparilla.
The experience of those who have tak
en Hood’s Sarsaparilla for rheumatism,
and have been completely and per
manently cured, prove the power of
this medicine to rout and conquer
this disease. Hood’s Sarsaparilla is
the One True Blood Purifier and it
neutralizes the acid which causes the
aches and pains of rheumatism. This
is why it absolutely cures when lini
ments and other outward applications
fail to give permanent relief. Be sure
to get Hood’s.

Those who Endure
Chat oil Oyster Culture.
A growing industry of Puget Sound
is the cultivation of the oyster. Al
most from time immemorial this de
licious bivalve has been a favorite with
epicures. When it was first used as
an edible is not given with definite
ness by historians, but it is known to
have been an article of food among
the Greeks and Roman. Itisof much
£
importance to the commercial inter
ests of the coast cities of Europe, both
on the estuaries of the Mediterranean
Sea and those of Great Britain and
Holland.
The oyster industry is of incalcula
ble importance to the Atlantic Coast
of the United States, made so by care
ful cultivation and a scientific study
by growers.
Natural oyster beds were found on
Bucfd’s Inlet by the early settlers at
Olympia about fifty years ago and
other beds were found in Oyster Bay,
a few miles from Olympia. The
oysters were small and to all appear
ances a distinct variety of bivalves.
The taste is essentially different from
that of the Eastern article. The story
is told at Olympia that something like
twenty-five years ago two Olympians
went to San Francisco with fiftj 7 boxes
of oysters for the purpose of selling
them to hotels and restaurants. The
oysters were small and uninviting to
look at and no sales could le made.
The promoters were disheartened. But
the American is equal to an emer
gency and while cogitating on the
situation a scheme that is often work
ed occurred to them. . They engaged
several men to go into restaurants and
call for Olympia oysters. Of course
the cder was not filled, but the num
erous calls had the effect of creating a
demand for the oyster and the fifty
boxes were disposed of. Since then
San Francisco became a permanent
market for the Olympia bivalves until
the growth of Portland and cities on
the Sound utilized the supply.
The pioneer oyster growers on the
Sound are J. A. Gale, A. J. Smith,
David Helser, S. K. Taylor H. ,11,
Weatherall and Mrs. Harry Kortjer.
Mr. Gale is at present Deputy Fish
Commissioner and is in the wholesale
oyster business in this city. During
territorial days he was instrumental
in organizing the oystermen for the
purpose of reclaiming the natural
oyster beds and cultivating artificial
ones. Said Mr. ; Gale this morning:
‘•'All the oysters procured from
Oyster Bky, Big Skookum Bay and
Mud Bay are now cultivated and have
been for years. Three-fourths of all
used come from cultivated beds. A
few are procured from natural beds in
Hood’s Canal and on North Bay. The
state owns these latter tide lands and
they can be oy stored by any one hold-
ing a license.
“Thurston and Mason counties pro
duce about 13,000 sacks of oysters an
nually. There are nearly 400 acres of
cultivated beds on Oyster Bay alone.
The natural beds are about all occu
pied, but by changing conditions other
tide lands may be prepared for oyster
cultivation. This year there is a more
perceptible increase in the oyster
acreage than ever before, and it will
in time be one of the state’s great in
dustries. There are many varieties of
these oysters, the Shelton being the
largest.
“We do not have a large enough
supply to can many, but those ship
ped East are fast creating a market.
Mussels are the weeds of an oyster bed
and we work diligently to get rid of
the pest. In themselves mussels are
good to eat and the demand for them
is growing, but they kill the oysters
off and we must cultivate the latter
without interference. When the oys
ters are gathered the beds are raked
clean, put on sink floats, the young
ones separated from those of market
able size, and all kept continually in
water. The oyster season begins Sep
tember 1, although a few are gathered
in every month of the year. One
thing should be remembered in cook
ing: Olympia oysters need to be wash
ed and the liquor is generally not us
ed. With proper care they never have
a fishy flavor.
“I am often asked about the propa-
gation of Eastern oysters on the Pacif-
ic Coast. One man, you know, spent
$30,000 experimenting at Alameda
and found that that kind of oyster
would not generally increase in West
ern waters. But we are constantly
experimenting on that line and every
year with better success.”
Sound oysters do not propagate the
same as the Eastern oyster. In fact
scientists are not wholly agreed as to
how they do propagate. The bulk of
authorities sustain the theory that
the oyster is a hermaphrodite, as is
undoubtedly the case with the East
ern product. Hon. A. S. Bush of
Shoalwater is of the opinion that the
oysters there propagate in the same
way, but both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gale
agree that Sound oysters are not her
maphrodite.
“Our oysters,” says Mr. (rale, “are
sold too cheap and it is the result of
the growers not acting together. The
demand for oysters is pretty sure to
ncreaso faster than the supply, as Mr.
Bush stated in his interview a few
days ago and growers should better
prices than they are obtaining but
until they form an organization and
work together just as producers do in
other lines they will have to be the
victims of the rivalries and price-cut
ting of middlemen. It is sure to be
one of the great industries of. Western
Washington and all material interests
should unite in encouraging its
growth.”—Seattle Times.
Fraterual Insurance.
Of all the remarkable things that
have sprung up during the past twen
ty years, none is more remarkable
than the growth of fraternal insur
ance. True there has been some wild
cat companies which have beaten
their followers out of many years as
sessments. But there are a number
that have met every demand, paid
every just debt and grown stronger as
they have grown older.
From the article in the last Work
man, we learn that there are 6,000,000
carrying policies in the several frater
nal organizations. The A. O. U. W.
is but thirty years old, yet it has 370,-
000 members, and has paid nearly
$70,000,000 to the relatives of the de
ceased members.
The oider of independent Foresters
has 111,772 members and a reserve
fund of nearly $2,500,000 yet this was
founded only twenty-three years ago.
The most marvelous of all fraternal
growths is the Woodmen’of the World,
which was founded only seven years
ago. Today it has 120,000 members
and has paid out nearly $1,500,000 in
death ’benefits.
The Maccabees have 275,000 mem
bers and has paid out in sixteen years
over $7,000,000.
During the past few years there has
been much agitation regarding several
changes to be made in the manage
mentof these societies. Some of these
have merit; some arc worse than use*
less. The great struggle in the A. O.
U. W. has been the graded assessment
plan. This was adopted in Oregon.
As adopted there it is of no value and
should not be attempted in this state.
The W. O. W. has solved this question
very satisfactorily, by grading the as
sessments from age at joining the or
der. It is a-just distribution of the
cost and could be adopted with profit
by the grand A. O. U. W. order.
Another—perhaps the most import
ant matter before these natural organ
izations is the “Reserve fund” ques
tion. We firmly believe that these
great organizations will never fully
raise to the full state of usefulness and
full power of good, until this question
is settled and settled right. A fund
ought to be accumulated, not large
enough to cause strife for its manage
ment, nor to corrupt officials, but
large enough so that after a member
has paid his assessment promptly for
say thirty years, he should be exempt
from further payments. The average
age at joining is about thirty years.
From 30 to 55 or 60 are the best years
of a man’s life, if fie ever accumulates
anything it is in that period, after that
many men are crowded out and the
matter of paying even $2. per month
is a hard trial for them. They ought
to be exempt. The fact must be faced
too that with age the assessments will
increase, this is the history of the
Eastern jurisdictions. And no man
who loves these orders would object
to paying a little higher assessment
while young if he could be certain that
when he had grown old no more would
be asked of him.—Hoquiam Washing
tonian.
How to Prevent Pneumonia.
At this time of the year a cold is
very easily contracted, and is left to
run its course without the aid of some
reliable cough medicine is liable to re
sult in that dread disease, pneumonia.
We know of no better remedy to cure
a cough or cold than Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy. We have used it
quite extensively and it has always
given entire satisfaction.—Olagah,
Ind. Ter. Chief.
This is the only remedy that is
known to be a certain preventive of
pneumonia. Among the many thou
sands who have used it for colds and
la grippe, we have never yet learned of
a single case having resulted in pneu
monia. Persons who have weak lungs
or have reason to fear an attack of
pneumonia, should keep the remedy
at hand. The 25 and 50 cent sizes for
