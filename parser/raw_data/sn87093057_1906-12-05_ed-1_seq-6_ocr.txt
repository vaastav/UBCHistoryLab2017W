The President's Message.
The message of the president of the
United States to the last session of the
59th Congress is one of the best and
moat remarkable messages ever sent to
any congress by any president of the
republic. It is a long but a most read
able document, and will be widely read
because of the great importance to the
country of the subjects discussed, and
because it bears upon every page and
in almost every line the energetic
personality of its author. It is plain
to be seen that the president is fully
aware that he has the people at his
back in his administration of their
affairs, and he not only recommends to
congress what reforms the country
needs, but he insists upon their enact
ment into law. He knows what is
needed and he goes after it with his
usual strenuosity. While he does not
attempt to in any way coerce or brow
beat the congress, he argues and ad
vises and reccmmends with an assur
ance that has not been assumed by any
president in recent years.
Much of the message is given over
to a discussion of old topics, such as
justice to the Phillipines, the rehabili
tation of our merchant marine, the
reform of federal court proceedure,
the control of corporate holdings, the
interstate commerce commission, and
the like, but he informs the congress,
in effect, that he will keep after them
until they do their duty in these mat
ters and that he speaks to them as the
voice of the people. He well knows
that many members of congress owe
their seats in the present house to his
personal efforts in their personal be
half, and the people may safely rely
on their supporting the president in
passing such remedial legislation at
this session. The Tacoma Ledger says
editorially:
"Americans who wish to understand
the issues of the day cannot afford to
ignore the message. It is full of meat
—full of thought, forcibly, clearly and
often splendidly expressed. They may
not always agree with its author, but
in the main they will not only agree
but applaud. Mr. Roosevelt's utter
ances on the preservation of the equity
powers of the courts againit the anti
injunction frenzy, on the relations of
capita) and labor, on the preservation
of the remaining public coal lands from
private appropriation, on the necessity
for national regulation of divorce, on
the revival of lynching in the south, on
the need of national sanity regarding
corporations and wealth, on the crime
on chilil labor, on the national defense,
on currency reform and the call for a
bank currency law, on the duty of
national good manners and observation
of treaties with the Japanese and other
nations, on our wark in Cuba and our
relations with South America—all these
and many other passages show him in
close touch with the best conservative
sentiment of thoughtful Americans in
all parts of the country. The message
is the word of no radical, but of a
strong man speaking for a progressive
nation. It would be a noteworthy
document even if it did not contain
other passages of the greatest import
ance on further national supervision of
corporations and the need of federal
inheritance and income tax."
Washinqton Chat.
Much speculation is rife in all quar
ters as to what Congress may do and
may not do during the three months
session just begun and which will ad
journ March 7, 1907. As there are so
many government supply bills to be
passed it is unlikely that there will be
much of a chance for general legisla
tion. Possibly the river and the har
bor bill carrying about sixty million
dollars, stands the best show. Next
comes the Phillipine tariff bill and then
the immigration bill. Outside of these
three measures and the passage of
general appropriation bills, both houses
will be content to do little else than
talk, thus sustaining the record estab
lished in the first half of the session
in which it is estimated that "hot air"
was let loose to the amount of fifty
million words.
Plenty of material is still awaiting i
discussion and it is probable that con
siderable talk will result from the re- j
recent dismissal by the President of a j
battalion of negro troops. The Smoot
cast' is to be argued in the Senate and !
a vote had if possible. The Santo
Domingo treaty which has been before
the Senate two years, will receive at-'
tention, also the Isles of Pine treaty. !
The bill limiting the hours of contin-!
uous labor for railroad employes will i
come up early in the session. The
question of bigger battleships will be
one of the important subjects discussed
and of course the Panama canal will
always be a lively question.
It is hardly probable that much head
way will be made in measures for re
ferring the currency and it is the con
sensus of opinion that neither the eight
hour law or the anti-injunction measure
both advocated by labor organizations
will become laws until late in the
session, if at all. One thing is certain,
Congress is now open and will speak
for itself.
The deplorable conditions existing in
the public printing office are far from
being settled and the public printer
continues to be the target for all the
criticisms, with the result that he has
asked of congress a complete investi
gation of his management of the office
since taking charge. The employees
are in a constant state of unrest, spend
much of their time in relating real or
fancied grievances and most of them
never know when they report for duty
in the morning whether they will be
discharged "without cause" before the
day is over.
In consequence of this long drawn
out state of restlessness, the sen
ate committee on printing will
shortly take matters in its own hands.
A bill will be devised abolishing the of
fice of public printer and provide that
the administration of affairs be vested
in a resident committee of three, to be
appointed by congress, and which will
act as a court of last resort in the set
tling of differences. It is believed the
establishment of such a board to take
charge of the big plant, will eliminate
all personality and do away entirely
with dissatisfaction, discontent and un
rest among the several thousand em
ployees. Grievances will go before the
three heads and when decisions are
rendered the employees will have no
recourse and cannot resort to the plea
of personal animosity when ruled
against, such as is now the case under
the one man power.
Considerable interest is being man- j
ifested in the preservation of the Key
mansion, located on Pennsylvania ave
nue in Georgetown and in which Fran
cis Scott Key, the author of "The Star
Spangled Banner" lived for many years
and the idea to purchase the property
by a memorial association was sug
gested by the fact that the legislature
of Massachusetts appropriated a sum
sufficient to preserve the home of Dr.
Samuel Smith, the author of "Ameri
ca".
The owners of the Key mansion were
planning to tear it down and build
small stores but the local patriots were
inspired to prevent what they felt a
desecration and prevailed upon the
owners to suspend building operations
for six months, by which time it is ex
pected to have the purchase price
raised by popular subscription.
Public interest have been steadily
increasing in this historic old mansion
ever since President Roosevelt decided
"The Star Spangled Banner" was the
national anthem. This question was
settled at the time that several foreign
governments requested the United
States to furnish a copy of its national
air. The state department officials
were in a quandary. Some held that
' 'America'' was the national song others
claimed that "Hail Columbia" should
be designated but the president de
clared for the song written by Key and
in this way it received official recog
nition.
Simplified spelling, as advocated by
President Roosevelt, has received
its first real set back in the house com
mittee on appropriation. It is the plan
of this committee to influence Congress
to refuse from the Government Print
ing Office all documents and reports in
which the new form of spelling is used.
The estimates for the cost of printing
are submitted to the committee in
question and it now appears that there
will be considerable increase in the
expense of documents if they are set
up and printed with two distinct forms
of spelling. This fact alone will carry
great weight with both Houses as each
is determined to do its best to reduce
the cost of public printing. The opin
ion is universal among committee mem
bers that all reports transmitted to
Congress from the departments that
are to be issued as Congressional doc
uments and that all laws passed by
Congress, should be printed in the old
fashioned way and that Congress should
not tolerate any interference in the
matter.
Visitors at the White House these
days find their interest centered in
Mrs. Roosevelt's collection of Japanese
dolls which she has generously placed
where the visiting public may enjoy
the sight of them. The dolls, which
were the gift of the Japanese Am
bassador, are kept under a glass in a
cabinet in the famous Red Room.
This unique collection of little Japs,
dressed in the ancient native costume
of the country from which they came
is superior in charm and value to any
collection in any museum of the United
States. It is probable that later on,
the collection will be placed in the
National Museum where it will bear a
tag reading "Loaned by Mrs. Theodore
Roosevelt".
SAY CRIMINALS GET Of F TOO EASY.
Chief of Poltcs Wappenstein Declares
Sentences Light.
"When a man gets a sentence of but
two years for beating a victim until he
is insensible and then leaving him on
the floor of his room for dead, the
courts are too lenient," said Chief of
Police Wappenstein of Seattle.
The protest of the chief of police was
against the action of Superior Judge
Frater in giving Paddy Collins and
George Miller two year sentences for
beating and robbing Charles Jenkins in
his room in the Nelson house. Jenkins'
room was entered by the two men. He
was awakened by them and fought off
one of the robbers. The other beat him
down with a beer bottle and almost
gouged out one of his eyes.
The two robbers were arrested
shortly after the affair by City Detec
tives Adams and Phillips. They con
fessed their guilt and pleaded guilty to
the charge against them.
"The news that desperate highway
robbers are getting off with two year
sentences in Seattle travels far," said
the chief of police. ' 'These hobo thieves
who give us the greatest trouble hear
of these things, and are more willing
to take a chance of getting caught in a
i town where there is a short sentence
I judge than thay are in a state like
California, where robbers are sen
tenced to 40, 50 and 55 years. In Cali
fornia, when a man admits he is a rob
[ ber, he seldom gets off with less than
;20 years, and often the punishment is
! for life.
"The thief who goes into a man's
room and beats him into insensibility
with the intention of robbing him is
just as guilty as a murderer. When he
goes into that room and assaults its
occupant he has murder in his heart,
and he is willing to kill if it becomes
necessary."
