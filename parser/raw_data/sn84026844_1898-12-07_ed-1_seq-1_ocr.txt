PARIS, Dec. 6.?The peace of Parte l!
nrnptlcallv an accomnlLshed fact. To
day's session disposed of the essentia
features of the treaty which will be erabodied
in the following eight articles:
1?The customary preface of treatlei
In the nature of an expression of amlt:
and of hope for perpetual peace.
2?The relinquishment by Spain of ha
Sovereignty over Cuba.
a?The withdrawal of the Spaniel
troops.
4?The relinquishment by Spain of faei
sovereignty over Porto Rico.
ii?Spain's cession of the Philippines.
t;?The withdrawal of the Spanisl
troops there.
7?The payment by the United State
of J20.000,000 for the Phillpipnes.
8?The provision: for the "open door*
commercial policy In the Philippines.
The rough draft of the treaty whicl
may be considerably changed covers th<
proposals. It makes a long document
which Senator Cushman K. Davis, of th?
United States peace commission, ?ay<
will be found to be one of the most in
teresting papers in its character evei
written. So completely ore the detalli
of the evacuation of the Philipines slip
uluted that a commission such as arranged
for the Spanish withdrawal fron
the West Indies will be unnecessary
Among the questions not yet settled
however, are the coaling station ant
religious freedom in the Carolines, th<
Spanish commission not having replte<
to the American ofTer. The American
have agreed to transport the Spanis)
prisoners home, including the garrisoi
mid sailors at Manila, captured by Ad
mlral Dewey and Gen. Merrill as wel
as thft soldiers and civilians held by th<
Filipinos, whose return the American:
have guaranteed. As compensation
Spain promises to liberate all Cuban
Porto Rican and Philippine politlca
prisoners. Spanish soldiers electing; ti
remain In the colonies may do so, but i
1s more a matter of economy for thi
Americans to return to theirs as the:
must be fed as lonsr as they are kepi
as Spain is unable.to bear the expense
Also the Americans have rejectei
Spain's request for free shipping for tei
years in Cuban and Porto Rlcan waters
they having given the Spanish commla
t toners such poor consolation as -the lat
ter may derive from the permission t?
re-apply when tht? dlplomutlc relation
have been renewed for shipping coucea
dons under the reciprocity scheme of thi
Dingley law, for which Senor Dupuy di
Lome was negotiating: In Wushingtoi
when war broke out. There- are ?tll
under consideration eight secondar;
subject? which the Spaniards broachci
las: week. Including the statu* of pat
ent* and copyright. The Amcrlcai
commissioners to-day handed to Seno
Montero Rlos a written reply coverinj
these questions. There will probably b
no Joint session to-morrow, as the Span
lard* desire time to consider this docu
mcnt. /
Monday's Stormy Srulou.
PARIS, Dec. 6.?The Joint peace com
mission met at 2 p. m. It ftas develops
chat yesterday's session was of fa
greater importance than generally sup
posed. It resulted in the Americans un
cotnDromlslngly rejecting Spain's re
quest that, for a term of years, th
ships of that country and Its product
be admitted to Cuban and Porto Rlcai
ports under the same regulations an*
customs tariff as American ships an
products.
Tlie Spanish commission for som
days has been playing for time. Th
Americans were anxious for a declslo
on the question of a coaling station It
the Caroline islands, religious toleranc
In the Carolines and the release of pa
litlcal prisoners. The Spaniards Tver
unwilling to answer these points unt
they heard what the Americans pre
posed to do for their industries whlc
Had Deen ouut up uy me vuuuu uu
Porto Rlcan trade.
This is why Spuin Intends that th
article* of treaty .should be disponed c
In (heir order, while the American
wanted to flrst setrtr their pressln
need*. w
The session of yesterday was practic
oily a tlffht on the order of proceduri
Finally the Americans yielded and the
the Spaniards proposed their shippin
and commercial question, which th
Americans rejected in Its entirely. Th
^ session then adjourned, with nelthc
hide in on especially amiable frame c
W mind.
f It Is learned that there were differ
ences of opinion amonff the American
on the shipping question ana numerou
telrfrrams were exchanged with Wasli
lnston. Finally the American commix
ion was instructed to reruse, the prin
rlpal reason being: that Porto Rico I
about to be declared ivlthln the coa*
lino of the United States, while as rc
? irdM Cuba, the authorities at Wasb
ington would make no promises, as th
American occupation there Is not fixe
and the future Cuban government mus
make its own treaties.

As to the other points which our cotn,

of at Paris by the present commissioners,
but the Indications now are that
r they will be left to adjustment In the ;

the Spanish government being
I under no compulsion whatever, save
, as may be zeroised by the Spanish
people who :nay euffer from the lack of
' proper treaty safeguards to regulate
commerce between Spain and the Unl,
ted States. Terhaps consideration, for
this threatened evil will lead the Span

In the peace treaty of a clause
providing for a renewal of the old
treaties of commerce and amity and
extradition at least temporarily and
until other treaties can be agreed upon \
to take their places. If this should not
be the case, however, there will not be
a stoppage of trade between the two
countries, but American merchants will
suffer from the Imposition of maximum
tariffs In Spanish ports and many other
petty charges which will amount to a
considerable discrimination against
them which the United States statutes
already contain clauses that might operate
against the Spanish merchants In
the same manner if not in the same degree.

Maintenance of Fence.
BERLIN, Dec. 6.?The reichstag was
opened to-day by Emperor William,
who, after announcing the Introduction
of a series of social and labor bills and
the completion of the organization of
the army, said that Germany's relations
with all the foreign powers continued
to be friendly, aiid that the principal
object of his policy would be to
contribute to the maintenance of peace.
Therefore, His Majesty hailed with
i warm approval ine czars magnniiunuua
- proposal lor the furtherance of that obl
ject.
is Continuing, the emperor referred to
3 the assassination of the empress of Aus,
trla as a savage and ruthless act, which
. had caused deep pain, and which had
1 evoked the most sincere sympathy
0 throughout T3ermany.
t Alluding to the anti-anarchist oonfrr2
ence at Eome, the emperor paid the
? readiness with which the Invitation had
:t been accepted by the powers justified
.. the hope that its deliberations would
1 have practical results.
1 Alluding to the war between Spain
, and the United States. His Majesty
said Germany's neutrality was consd.
entlously observed toward both belllg?
erents.
3 Then, taking up colonial affairs, Emnotwiw
IVIIIInw nnlnlul nitf hf? menBiiroa
" tuken for the economic development of
, Kla Chao, declaring that while consci^
' entlously respecting the well-acquired
J rights of third parties, the German gov*
crnment would direct Ita efforts to the
\ further promotion of Its economic rela1
tlons with China, which are yearly
* growing more important."
I The emperor concluded with a reforr
once to his visit to Palestine, saying he
* hoped the brilliant reception accorded
6 him by the sultan and the Turkish peo
pie everywhere would prove to b?? of
- permanent benefit to German prestigo
and the national Interests of Germany.
His Majesty's speech was repeatedly
. checred.
Count von Loerchenfcld. the Bavarian
II plenipotentiary, called for three cheera
r for the emperor, after which Emperor
. William and his sons left the hall, and
the deputies proceeded to the reichstag,
" where Hcrr Llngens took the chair as

on him as the winner. The men- weigh"

with a right swing on the jaw. A few
" momenta later both men- went to the

looked then as if Walcott would go out
c with another good blow, but by repeated

8 Smith was unabl?* to get the mark.
5 Walcott was rather slow in his movements
and got In so close to Smith that
' the latter was unable to do much dam '
age at close quartern. Walcott was
n favorite in the betting. His friends bet
6 one hundred to seventy on the colored
c man on the ground that Smith's recent
c light with TVimmy West, at Bridgeport.

Special Dispatch to the Intelligencer.
fti a 13r xra'rnv xv v? tw. ? ?-Mr
Graw's organ, the Charleston Gazette,
came out on Monday In great glee, and
announced that Logan, the Democratic
candidate lor house of delegates in
Monroe county, "had it." The Gazette
was wonderfully tickled over its alleged
belief that the supreme court of appeals
of this state would not hear the
case until after it was too late. This
is a slander on the court. The law Is
Plain. Section 89. of chapter 3, of the
code, says:
"A mandamus shall lie from the supreme
court of appeals, or any one of
the Judges thereof in vacation, returnable
before said court, to compel any officer
herein to do and perform legally
Iinif Antv hr.fr.}n rpnuirod of him. And
respecting the flection of a member of
the house of delegates and state senator.
a writ of certiorari, mandamus or
prohibition shall He from the said supreme
court of appeals, or a Judge
thereof in vacation, returnable before
said court, to correct any error of law
and revietv and correct the proceedings
of any circuit court or the judge thereof
In vacation, or any board of canvassers.
When any such writ of mandamus,
prohibition, or certiorari shall bp
issued by said court or a Judge thereof
in vacation, it shall bo the duty of said
court to convene In special session at
the state capltol. not later than ten
uays irom me uaie ot uju wru, which
matters shall have precedence over all
other business pendlnn In said court,
and be determined within five days
from the assembling thereof, and in
any case, 1n ample time for the case to
be remanded, in order that such board
may perform its duty and issue the certificate
of election before the second
Wednesday In January, then, next following.
In mandamus and prohibition
proceedings under this section thr
same may be upon affidavit alone, and
no rule to show cause, nor alternative
writ, shall be necessary."
Court will not J>elny.
Even if there were no statute, the
court would not delay a hearing. II
could not without repudiating its own
words. In-the case of Flemlnc_i's: Commissioners,
31 West "Virginia Report's, p,
617, decided in November 28, 1888, the
supreme court said: "The resujts of ar
election should be declared as speedily
us possible, and it is the duty of the
courts, when applications are made ?tc
them, to, as far as possible,- facilitate
such results." This very ease ol
Fleming vs. Commissioners was submitted
to the court on November 28
1888. and decided that very day.
The attorneys for Mr. Via did not
niunuer. x ncy uiuutiiu iiic
ceedings, nnd In. the very way. laid
down by the statute and the decisions
of the supreme court Itself. The constitution
(sec. 12 of art. 8), says that "the
circuit court shall have the supervision
and control of all proceedings before
Justices and other inferior tribunals. b>
mandamus, prohibition and certiorari.'
And section 2. of chapter 110, of the
code. Is to the same effect, and enlarge?
the remedy by certiorari far beyond
tvbat it was at the common law. In the
case of Alderson vs. Commissioners, the
supreme court said (.11 West Virginia
633): "The rulings of the commissioners
of a county sitting as a board of canvassers
after an election, to ascertain
the result thereof in the county are
subject to review by the circuit couri
on a writ of certiorari." Even before
section 2. of chapter 110, of the codo was
amended to read as It now reads, the
supreme court decided that certlorar
was the proper remedy. This was in
1879. There are a half dozen decision?
of the supreme court to the same effect
There la no desire to discuss the case
while It is pending before the court, bui
the Gazette says some things ' that
make a few remarks pertinent. The su
preme court onereu 10 near uu- vanwithout
printing the record, but the at
tomcys for Logan objected. They would
agree to no date on which a hearlnp
could be had. Thin, and the gleeful announcement
of the Gazette that th<
case may not be heard till "any time
within the next vear," shows that th?
Democratic machine does not wunt ?th<
case heard. They desire Logan seated
nnd to use his vote, regardless of the
right. Of the seven grounds of orroi
set up by Logan in his petition, nearly
all are purely technical. This and theli
opposition to a hearing show that thej
are nfralil of <he!r case and have Tic
confidence In It. Besides, Logan hai
served notice of contest on Via, thereby
admitting Vla's election.
A llerlcw of til* C'anr.
A review of the facts of the case If
not out of place here. At the electlor
In Monroe county, C. M. Via was thf
Republican candidate for the house ol
delegates and J. D. Lugan was tin
Democratic candidate. Mr. Logan, nt
has been shown in his previous candidacies
for office, Is not a popular man,
This if not laid t<> his humiliation; H
may not be due to any fault of his;
many good tnon are not popular; this h
merely stated as a fact. At each voti
inw place In Monroe county there wen
two Dejnocrntio commissioners and ont
RepubWan. and a clerk of each party,
The returns of the lection made by
theKc officers showed Via elected by flvi
majority. There was talk of a recount
but nil the leading Democrat* opposed
It. Logan agreed not to auk It. The
Democratic lenders said Via was honestly
elected, and to deprive him of hl?
Heat would Injun* tbo Democratic party
Irreparably. At this Juncture. Mr
James H. Miller, chairman of the Democratic
congressional committee, appeared
on the xcene, mm the agent of tlt<
Mcflraw mncblne. with money to pay
attorneys nnd foot all bills. Logan wa?

Under this reversal Locan etune out '
some Are vote* ahead. Thereupon the
Republican attorneys applied <o the
judge or the circuit court for a writ of
certiorari and an order restraining the I
county court from Issuing a certificate
until the circuit court could pass on the
' case. The county court, however, hur- ,
rtedly mued the certificate to Logan,
and It ivas mailed four days before the
certificates were mailed pertaining to
the result for state senator. The circuit
court granted the writ of certiorari,
promptly heard tbe case, carefully
counted the ballots In dispute, and doclded
'Via elected fay four majority.
Thereupon the attorneys at Logan applied
to the supreme court for a writ of
error to the decision of the circuit court.

? at President MjcK in ley's message to
, Congress, with the exception of the
allusion to the Nicaragua canal, which,
to the minds of the editors, does' not
show sufficient appreciation of 'British

. The Pall? Mall Gazette says: "In lan

Referring to the Nicaragua canal, the

The St. James Gazette reads the Xlcr

draws the inference therefrom that

"It would be strange." the article
continues "If the opportunities Just now

WASHINGTON, D. C. DM. I.-Tht i
ftrtt note of the anH-expanelonlst? ?u
sounded In tb? senate to-day by 9<nator
Tat. of MUiouri, who introduced
the following joint resolution:
"That under the constitution ot the ,-i
United States no power is given to the
federal government to acquire territory
to be held and governed permanently "
as colonies.
"The colonial system of IMropeaa na- j
Hon* can not be established under our yi
present constitution, but alt territory
acquired by the government, except
such small amount aa may be neeeesary
for coaling stations, correction of
boundaries and similar governmental J
purposes, must be aoaulred and govern- )
ed with tho purpose of ultimately or-_
ganising such territory into state* agitable
for admission to the Union." ,
A. brief discussion or tee iu.vifs.usa ?
law* was precipitated by th? conaldtratlon
of a bll> amending those law* bjr -J
the addition of a provision that fortlfn 3

country and repaired to the extent of
three-fourths of their value, shall be ,.8(

subsequently In the coastwise trade of ;
the United States.
Ifr. Vest, a member of (ne commutes
on commerce, expressed his opposition M
to the bill, principally because It at- . SJ
forded protection to the coastwise trade. g
whloh needed no protection. Our ten- sf
oral carrylnc trade, Mr. Vest believed. ,?
needed protection. Under the present I'd
system of navigation laws this trad*
bad decreased from 75 per cent to 11 iS
per cent, and this country Is now pay- :j
Ins 1160.000,000 annually to foreign ship '{'a
owners for carrying trade that ought to '.'X
be carried in American bottoms. This .-3
condition of affairs, Mr. Vest declared. g
was "a scandal and disgrace." He said Ms
he had been amused at the suggestion -w
of the President, made In his message.
SUOmiUl'U /CBICIWJ tUBl vol J
trade be encouraged by the payment of X
subsidies.
"In other word*," sajd he, "It Is proposed
to substitute for the present eye- : ?
tern ot navigation laws a scheme of . jj
subsidies that Is even more vicious
than Is the evil It proposes to remedy." -3
"Dnder the proposed policy of the J?
administration." continued. Mr. Vest, A
"we are to build u great navy. We ar? : jS
to cease to be a nation of trader*, and :fj
under the Impulse of the policy of ex- a
pansloa become a nation of warrior*. va
It would appear to me to be better to ^
Ant build up our carrying trade. It ./a
would also let our people, through the 3a
beneficent effects of such trade, buy whore
they can buy cheapest."
Mr. Caffrey. also a member of the
committee on commerce, opposed the Jf
bill. Finally It was made a special or- VJI
der for next Monday. At 1:30 p. m. the
senate adjourned. .J|
