OFFICIAL PAPER OF PEMBINA 00.
i»PTbalf£!iiS!«ry wornlm, «t Pembina
D. T. 8ubicrlptlon.t2.00 per annum. In advance.'
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1886.
The Chicago Inter-Ocean in an able
editorial, shows that the tyranny of
monopoly is being gradually overcome
and large corporations are now more
amenable to public opinion than ever
before.
Our esteemed contemporary, the
Grand Forks Plaindealer, thinks that
there is no difference between the
Republican and Democratic parties.
It reached that conclusion last week.
Bro. Murphy is evidently drifting to
wards the Democratic camp.
General Logan will oppose the con
flrmation of all appointments made to
(ill vacancies when veterans have been
removed without cause. When "Black
Jack's" aboriginal spirit gets fully
aroused the fur will fly in more than
one direction.
The president's message has been
criticized more severely by the Demo
cratic press than that of any former
president by the newspapers of his
own party. This fact may be regard'
ed as creditable to the president but
ominous of trouble in the family. Mr.
Cleveland is too nearly in sympathy
with the best Republican ideas to con
tinue popular with his own party.
The legislature of the state of South
Dakota—to be or not«£o be—met on
Monday the 14tli. Hugh J. Campbell
called the legislature to order and an
organization was regularly effected.
Its representatives, jn the name of
liberty and justice, will ask congress
for a proper recognition and for the
admission of South Dakota to the sis
terhood of states.
It is generally conceded that- the
president's message is a document of
considerable weight, hut its failure to
make any reference to the claims of
our territory has aroused a sense of
keen disappointment throughout
Dakota. We can only forgive Presi
dent Cleveland when lie comes out
with a supplemental message, strongly
recommending the division of Dakota
and the admission of the southern part.
And ho should not delay this duty
long.
We would again call attention to
the petition being circulated for sig
natures, asking congress to open for
settlement the pine lands of the Red
Lake reservation. Let everybody sign
it. It is being sent out at the wish of
Hon. Knute Nelson, representative
from Minnesota, who will again intro
duce a bill to congress providing for
the opening of this reservation and
the sale of land on the stumpage plan.
Every settler in North Dakota is in
terested in this movement. Let Con
gressman Nelson be backed up lu this
light by the largest petition that ever
went to congress from the Northwest.
As it is now, T. B. Walker has a
monopoly in the lumber business for
all this country. He owns a large
tract of pine lauds iu the vicinity of
Red Lake. Steenersou Bros., of Crook'
ston, also own a large area of pine
timber, but it is situated farther up
the Wild Rice than Walker's and the
latter has a system of locks for his
own use, which he can throw open at
the right time to cause logs above to
run aground. Last spring Steeiierson's
were compelled in this way to sell
their logs to Walker. Of course,
Nelson's bill will encounter a strong
adverse lobby influence. He should
therefore be backed by an expression
of public sentiment its direct and forci
ble as possible.
GRANT'S MEMOIBH.
The first volume of Grant's Per
sonal Memoirs" is now beingdelivered
by the agents of the work. The book
will be read with great interest, not
alone by reason of its authorship, but
for the readable style in which it is
written, and the interest that attaches
to the events and incidents narrated,
many of which could by no one else be
so graphically and authoritatively told.
We need not here refer to any of the
remarkable features or circumstances
of Grant's career, such for iustiince as
hauling cordwood to sell in 1858 and
being elected president in 18G8, in the
meantime having become distinguish
ed the world over for his military
success. The events connected with
such a transition must be of deep
interest.
The following letter, written as
late as 1801 sounds strange to us now:
Galena, Illinois,
Col. L. Thomas, May 24,1861.
Adj. Gen., U.S.A., Washington, D.C.
Sir:—Havingserved for fifteen years
iu the regular army, including four
years at West Point, and feeling it the
duty of everyone who has been ed
ucated at the government expense, to
offer their services for the support of
that Government. I have the honor,
very respectfully, to tender my ser.
vices, until the close of the war, in
such capacity as may be offered. I
would say, in view of my present age
and length ot service, 1 feel myself
competent to command a regiment, if
the president in his judgment, should
see lit to intrust one to me. Since
the lirst call of the president I have
been serving on the staff of the
governor of this state, rendering such
itid as I could in the organization of
our state militia, and am still engaged
in that capacity. A letter addressed
to me at Spriuglield, Illinois, will
reach me. I am very respectfully,
Your obt. svt., U. S. Grant.
But this letter was not thought
worth answering at headquarters.
A prominent Democrat of Grand
Forks expressed the opinion a few
days ago that "Greely's Americau
Conflict," "Blaine's Twenty Years in
Congtess" and Grant's Personal
Memoirs will be the three permanent
authorities of that class in American
liteiature.
The Fargo Republican is
out square
ly for division, but Major Edwards is
still unmistakably on the fence. We
have reason to believe that he is pro
foundly studying the merits of the
question as to which side is likely to
win, which being determined, his pon
derosity will get there with lKth feet.
We are informed that Sheriff Hawk
of CavAler county, on the preliminary
examination was found guilty of man
slaughter and released on $500 bail to
appear at the district court. We
doubt the correctness of this, however,
as it would argue more ignorance than
is fair to presume of a justice.
ernes*.
The boys are making grand prepar
ations for their concert to be held during
Christinas week.
A blue ribbon gospel temperance
meeting will be held in Mr. Henry
McGuinn's house. Your correspondent
means to be there and will hope to see
a goodly gathering of the boys.
By the way we understand that Rev.
Macnamara has brought a wife back with
him. We welcome the lady and wish
them all kinds of happiness and succcss
as they sail down the stream of time to
gether.
The tea meeting held in the school
house on Thursday evening was a grand
success. The program was interesting
and entertaining, as we surmised it would
be and the finances mounted up to $50.
Miss Lily Houny carried off the quilt
and Miss Nina Lee appeared as the most
popular young lady for she took the
cake." The Mesdames Henry, Finlay
and Clias McGuinn were the committee
appointed to carry out the arrangements
for the evening and it most decidedly re
flected great credit on their abilitv to
manage.
CROWK CENTRE.
Rev. C. A. Macnam&ra will move into
Mr. Lusk's house on Friday, where he
will live until spring, when the parsonage
will be built. The trustees are away
buying furniture.
The Christmas tree will be held in the
school house on Thursday 24th. All who
want a apod old fashioned time will do
well to attend. Candy and nuts forth*
children §nd the adults will please pay a
quarter entrance fee.
Perfection at last.
Having paid strict attention to the
production of abetter style and quality
of boots and shoes than are commonly
made, I take the pleasure of calling the
readers attention to the fact. Experience
shows that good custom work is appre
ciated by all, and that not low prices, but
the best of material and style is what is
wanted. My price for a good boot or
shoe are not the lowest, because I make
no cheap or shoddy goods the latter of
which is dear at any price. I claim for
iny boots and shoes that they excel all
others manufactured first in style,
second in neatness of fit, third in quailtv
and fourth in superior workmanship.
All woik warranted, and can be sent to
any one per parcel post to any part of
the states or territories at one cer per
ounce. Whenever you may be ii the
city, I would be very pleased to take your
order. Yours trulv,

Winter Reading.
It appears to be a notable fact that the
best farmers, and the best stockmen are
the very best friends of newspapers.
It is generally the old fogy and the
ne'er-do-wells, that scoff at "book and
newspaper larnin," and if they are in
duced to bike their home county paper
they never read it. The progressive
farmers, those who get thirty bushels of
wheat to the acre, and own fine, fat,
sleek cattle and horses, are invaiiably
men whose sitting room table will be
generously supplied with, not only local
newspapers, but agricultural journals,
books relating to stork, to feeding ani
mals, which contain the thoughts and
experiments ot able men, who devote
their time and. energies to advance the
cause of agriculture and to learn how to
product- more abundant crops, as well as
to surround their stock with the best
conditions for raising them Mict.-e.-nfiiily
and profitably.
Every fanner in the Northwest will be
benefitted greatly by subscribing to one
or more good agricultural papers, ami if
one is published near by it certainly
should be a regu'ar visitor in the family.
The Northwestern Farmer, published
at Fargo, Dakota, is doing a good work
throughout the Northwest, and we have
decided to c'Ver it to every old subscriber
