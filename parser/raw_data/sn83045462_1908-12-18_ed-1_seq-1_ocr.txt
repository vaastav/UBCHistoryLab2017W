WiCKERSHAM TO BE
ATTORNEY_GENERAl
New York Lawyer to Head the
Department of Justice.
CONFERENCES WITH TAFT
Result of Next President's Recent
Visit to Gotham.
KNOX FOR THE PREMIERSHIP
Generally Believed That the Senator
From Pennsylvania Is Choice for
Secretary of State.
NKW YORK. December IS.?That President-elect
Taft 'lias selected George W.
Wickersham of the New York law firm
of Strong & Cadwalader, to be Attorney
i ieneral in his cabinet was learned today
from a source that is regarded as reliable.
Numerous conferences were held between
President-elect Tuft and prominent
lawyers of this city during the former's
recent visit here. Prominent among those
consulted were the members of the lirm
of Strong & Cadwalader. including Henry
tV. Taft. brother of the President-elect.
The attorney generalship, it is said, was
one of the chief subjects considered at
these gatherings.
It is known from friends of Mr. Taft
that Mr. "VYickersham has been under
consideration for the post of Attorney
General for several weens. In fact, even
before the result of the election had been
announced he was considered in connection
with the names of Judge Charles
Nagel of St. l.rfHii.s Frank It. Kellogg of
St. Paul and Henry M. Hoyt, the present
solicitor general of tlie Department
of Justice.
An ''Office Lawyer."
Mr. "Wickersham is what is sometimes
termed the "office lawyer"" of the firm of
Strong & Oadwalador. working out the
policy to be pursued on big matters of
litigation. In Martindale's American law
directory he Is rated "very good" In legal
ability and "very' high" under the classification
of recommendations. These are
the highest ratings contained in the directory.
It Is recognized that Mr. Wickeraham
has been particularly prominent in
corporation I^w, and It is said that President-elect
"Taft's only concern in appointing
him was the fact that there might
be some criticism because of the selection
Of a "corporation lawyer."
Known in Washington.
It has been known here for several
days that the name of George W. AViekershanr
of New York has been under
consideration by President-elect Taft for
the post of Attorney General. Among
others consulted by Mr. Taft concerning
Mr. Wickersbam's qualifications was Senator
Knox, former Attorney General of
the United States, and who is believed to
l>e the choice of Mr. Taft for the post of
Secretary of State.
Senator Knox declined to discuss the
question in any way. hut it is understood
lie indorsed Mr. Wickersham fully, and
argued that a man of sufficient capabilities
in the legal profession for the att

i i/i t,* nvi ?,'nuu nui ut; iounu unless
taken from the list of those who have

ers.
Knox for Cabinet.
It is generally believed now that Senator
Knox is the choice of President-elect
Taft for his Secretary of State, although
no authoritative announcement
has been made concerning the proffer of a
portfolio to the Pennsylvania senator or
the acceptance by him of a cabinet position.
That he will be a member of the
cabinet, however, is not doubted here.
For some time it has been rumored that
President-elect Taft had in mind the appointment
of either Senator Knox or former
Senator John Spooner.
The he_--t information obtainable about
t e e'apitol today tended to fix Senator
Knox as the premier of the new cabinet.
The selection would give universal satisfaction
among republican leaders, although
Senator Knox's colleagues would
be sorry to be deprived of bis association
in the Senate and would regard his new
duties as in the nature of a deprivation
to Congress and legislation.
If he goes out. a very interesting political
situation will be developed in Pennsylvania.
A sharp contest to till his
place would ensue, participated in by
several prominent Pennsylvanians, including
George T. Oliver of Pittsburg, Representative
Dalzell. Representative Francis
Rurke and Josiah Thompson of Uniontown.
More Cabinet Gossip.
Gossip of the day mentions Charles Nagel
of St. Louis as the probable recipient
of a cabinet portfolio. Mr. Nagel is a
close friend of Mr. Taft and was active
in the management of his campaign.
I Co J. W. S. Thompson of Brooklyn is being
discussed for the Navy portfolio, in
,ise William Loeb, jr., should decide not
to take that place.
At the Capitol today it was suggested
' hat Representative Overstreet of Indiana
may be made director of posts, if the
proposition to create that office is earned
out. Mr. Overstreet, as chairman
i" the committee on post offices, and a
m tuber of the postal commission, lias
.riven deep study to postal affairs.

MESSAGE FALLS FLAT
I
, Congress Fails to Enthuse
. Over One-Man Rule.

| NO ACTION THIS SESSION
j Several Reasons Why President's
Advice Is Coldly Received.
.
NOT IN THE MOOD FOR IT
M
I
Some Senators Not Even Aware
>
i Change in District Government
Has Been Recommended.
There's not a chance that the Presi- j
dent's recommendation that the three DIs- !
trict Commissioners be replaced by a single
governor will go through at the pres- !
ent session of Congress. There's very j
little probability even that the question j
will be given serious consideration by this !
Congress. And. if the truth must he
known, there's mighty little chance that
this or the next Congress will pay any
attention whatever to the message, in so
far as it treats of a change in the local
government.
It is not at all hard to find out that j
this is the situation at the Capitol. As a i
matter of fact Congress is in no mood
at this time to pay respectful attention to '
what the President may have to say on
any subject. That's one reason for the
condition of affairs with respect to the
message of yesterday 'ransmitting the
Reynolds' report and approving of it. The
other reason is that the idea of a oneman
power, when the one man is to be 1
appointed by the President, doesn't appeal
to senators and representatives on
its merits.
Now. if the proposition were that a j
governor be elected by the people, there '
would be a good deal of support for it. i
provided it should ever come to the front, j
which wouldn't be likely for some time, j
But the President's Ideas on the subject |
ami those of Mr. Reynolds are regarded at
the Capitol as being directly opposed to !
the local self-government proposition. A .
bill granting suffrage to the District 011 1
local matters- would by no means have j
perfectly plain sailing, hut it would most
as2?umii\ rnruunier mum Tairer weaincr
and more favorable winds than the pros- j
ent proposition for greater centralization j
of power in the executive.
Little Interest in Message.
it is an interesting fact that with the
exception of a few members of the District
committee of both branches the senators
and representatives don't know what
was in the message sent by the President
yesterday, and are taking 110 trouble to
find out. Severa! members of the Senate
District committee, when asked yesterday
afternoon for their opinion on
the message, didn't even know that there
was such a thing, although it had just
been read in the Senate chamber.
Tills doesn't mean at all that the District
committees are not interested in local
matters, nor that Congress is not. as a
rule, when they are brought to its attention.
The local street railway questions.
gas. liquor and school legislation,
and even the local suffrage question as a
general proposition, are all occupying Wie
mind of Congress. But the national legislators
are not at this time looking to
the President for advice.
Senator Gallinger. chairman of the District
committee of the upper branch and
the man who has more to say about what
shall be done in the District than any
otiier. has read both the Reynolds report
and the message very carefully, but he is
not willing to express' an opinion before
hearing the evidence in the ease. He is
an exception to the general rule. Mr.
Gallinger never lets anything concerning

Mr. Gallinger Non-Committal.
"My position," he said this morning, "is
really a judicial one, and I do not feel
that I should give my ideas on the subject.
when 1 might have to change thein
after hearings have been held."
He was willing, however, to say this:
"I believe that the proposition to improve
conditions In the District sociologically,
as recommended by the President
and in the Keyno.ds report, should be
considered apart from tlie governmental
proposition. 1 believe they will be when
the time comes. They are not related, as
a matter of fact."
Mr. Gallinger lias long been interested
in "cleaning up" the Capital city, and
stands In favor of any measure that will
accomplish any good along that line. He
doesn't think Washington is especially in
need of being "cleaned up"?thai is to
say, that it is worse off in" this respect
than other cities?but lie wants to see it
as nearly perfect as it is possible to make
it.

Rev. Ozora S. Davis, pastor of the South

BURNING SHIP BOMBARDED.
Singapore Fort Riddles Kaloma
With Shot Till She Sinks.
SINGAPORE, December IS.?The burn- i
ing oil ship Ka'oma was bombarded by the
harbor fort here today and finally sank
with her hull riddled with solid shot.
The flaming steamer, which hails from I
England. arrived in Singapore from 'New !
York two days ago with her cargo of case j
oil on lire. All attempts to extinguish the
blaze were unsuccessful, and an effort ,
was made to scutt'e the vessel.
This failed also, and the danger to shipping
became serious. It was impossible
to go near the craft because of the possibility
of explosions.
Finally the harbor agents appealed to
the gunners of the fort, who sank the
Kaloma with a few well directed solid
, shot from the fortification's six-inch guns.
The distance was two miles.

PORTLAND. Ore., December is.?A T
heavily armed posse headed by Sheriff w
Stevens is following the trail of a band of c
highwaymen today with every possibility
that they will soon catch up with the Jdesperadoes,
who left a plain trail, and T
that a stiff light will ensue. The men
wanted by the posse held up passenger p
train No. 1, bound for Portland over the b
Oregon Railway and Navigation font
pan's road, about 10 o'clock last night ti
and after dynamiting the safe in the fx- d
press car and seen ring $20,U00 they tied a
toward the foothills. %
The robbery was one of the* most daring
that has been committed in many years K
and savored of tin- old days when it was
a fairly common thing for trait; robbers to *
operate and stir up the countryside. Following
as closely as this crirri" dors on I
'he robbery of the East Side Hank a week "
ago. the utmost excitement has been ^
aroused ami the sheriff had no difficulty
in getting together volunteers to follow fi
the gang into the hills. A number of !'
Finkerton men and several city detectives
have also been assigned to the case.
Job Quickly Done.
The robbery of tlie express car was carried
out with such neatness and dispatch
that the gang must have given the most
careful thought to their plans. The men.
all masked, appeared on the train when it Ci
was about twelve miles east of this city sj
and while some covered the engineer and j|
firemen with their revolvers and ordered c
them to stop the train, others went back ii
through the coaches threatening to shoot n
any one who attempted to interfere.
The rest of the gang made for tlie ex- ei
press car. overpowered Express Messenger cl
1 lucid, and. having uncoupled the express fi
and mail cars from the coaches, ran them ' ?
mi the track a short distance and cracked i c
tlic safes with dynamite. About f<
was contained in the safe, according to '
the express messenger, and when the rob- tl
bers had secured tliis they signaled their
comrades, who had remained to see that
no one left the coaches to give an alarm. .
and tlie whole gang made off for the foot- T
hi'le.
Small Army in Pursuit.
Apparently the highwaymen were confident
of their own strength or else count- n
ed upon gaining such a Trad that they can
get safely away before any pursuing
posse can come within striking distance P
ot mem. anei in ?ievens, wnen lie went to
the scene of the hold-up, found such a
a plain trail that it encouraged him to be- ^
lieve lie would soon have the offenders
in custody, and he at once swore in a ti
number of special deputies. Others who J
wished to join in the excitement of the
chase and were not given temporary of- ('
flrial powers by the sheriff mounted their 6
horses and went along with t lie posse l'
any way, so that the sheriff had a for- a
mldable following when lie hit the trail
of the robbers.
Other possts have spread out. in order
to give tlie nearby country a thorough
combing, and it Is thought to be almost L
an assured fact that the robbers will be S
captured some time today. si

J* MUST PAY DUTY ON DOGS.
Fifty-Nine Hounds Imported From
e Europe Assessed at 20 Per Cent.
3, NEW YORK. December 18.?Peter F.
d Collier, master of the Monmouth County
y Hunt Club. Eatontown, N. J., must pay
^ duty on fifty-nine hounds which he imported
on the Uovic from Liverpool. Tlie
customs authorities had them for duties
and a bond had to be given to release
the dogs. The collector assessed duties
5 at 20 per cent. In his protest Mr. Collier
wrote in part to the collector:
"I claim that these hounds are entitled
to frep entry under paragraph 47.". of the
tariff law. The pedigree certificates, which
e we were unable to complete at this time,
i- owing to the difficulty in obtaining all the
,s particulars, are in the process of eomple'
tion. The assessment of duty is submitI
ted to under compulsion to obtain pos
session of tiie hounds. We claim that
the duty exacted by you is not the legal
duty."
In reply to this the deputy collector
3 informed his chief that Mr. Collier had
not taken the oath certifying to his eiti.
zeushlp and had not produced the pedigrees
of the dogs. Acting on this in^
formation, the board of L'niteJ States

this morning. Pi
The court convicted her and sentenced Tl

The peculation was committed by the be
countess while serving in the humble ea- ni
pacity of housekeeper in the household of
Ralph Gait, near 13th and N streets
northwest. The former employer was her to
accuser. . er
The countess is an American. Because wi
of political disturbances in the land of her ^
husband, she recited to the police, she .
was compelled to flee for safety across ,
one of the European international borders
several years ago. and sought safety wl
in the land of her birth. . n
She is a forlorn little woman, about =
thirty-four or thirty-five years of age.
Her face indicated at least mental if not 1,1
physical suffering and is seamed with ar

as she heard the charge read by the jjj
clerk in court or listened in th?

Housekeeper for Gait. Ce
Mr. Gait told the court the defendant
had been formerly employed by him as a ar
housekeeper, and that about Thanksglv- to
Ing time her connection with his house- at
hold was severed. Some days la.ter, he ac
said, the forks were missed from his silver
closet, and later traced to a local ;
pawn shop, where the countess had i
pawned them for j F<
"I don't know much about her," said ly
Mr. Gait after the case was disposed of,
"except that she came to ruy home
through the medium of an employment ,
agency. I understand and know, in fact, W
that the Danish minister knows her and
seems to be interested in her." ^
When all the damaging facts relative
to the theft of the forks had been introdueed
in evidence the defendant was w
called to the stand to tell her story. fe

When I so.d theni I never looked closely

"No," she answered to additional ques- I
tions, "I have not been in Washington ca
long. I came here from Laurel, wnere ; . .
I kept chickens and made a living from
them. The venture didn't pay, so I de- Ka
cided to seek a position as housekeeper." fa
The court inquired carefully into any | al
possible police record the defendant might b
have, and finally imposed a sentence cu lis
ninety days in jail in default of $50 fine. I
When the countess realized what was at
before her she gasped and seemed as ca
though she were about to swoon. Then ht

"You have separated then, from your J

says, because of poverty and sought her at
