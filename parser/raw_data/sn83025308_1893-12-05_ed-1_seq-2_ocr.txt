2,100 mile trip. Her destination is Hono

into diplomatic autho ity is coming here

turned the cutter over to the stare decart

FIGHT FOR A PRISON.
Colorado's Governor and Warden Not In
lharmony.
DET-va, Dec. 4.-Gov. Walte removed
State Penitentiary Commissioner Reynolds
this afternoonon the ground of malfeasance
in office. He is charged with having kept on
deposit in his bank, in Canon City,
prison money that should have been turned
ever-to the state Ieaeury, and with having
been interested in prison contracts. IBy
the appointment of Reynolds' successor
the governor will obtain control of the
Ienitentia'y board and will then attempt
to remove Warden McAllater.
The warden has fortified himself by the
appointment of guards who will anoridcs
their lives if necessary in the defense of his
interests. He says he will not surrender
the p:ison until the courts decide against
him.

1hero was nothing left this morning of the
firmness with which the stock market closed
aEturday. ipeculation was weak and sympa
thized with the heaviness of the London market
for American securities. The publication of the
president's message in London in advance of
delivery to congress gave the street knowledge
if its contents and the fact that it made no
mention of a contemplated bond issue was re
garded a bear point, and helped depreciate val
ner. London was in the market as seller of 1t.
Paul, Atchison, Union Pacific and Louisville &
Nashville, and the west sent in a number of
