for over a year, has informed the ed
itor of the magazine publishing his
story that he will return to the United
States with his wife and children
Dec. 22, if only to spenei Christmas
here.
Dr. Ccok in his story deals with the
psychology of his adventure and says
"Did 1 pet to the north pole? Per
haps I made a mistake in thinking
that I did. Perhaps I did make a mis
take. After mature thought I confess
that I do not know absolutely wheth
er I reached the pole or not."
"This may come as an amazing
statement, but I am willing to startle
iho world, if by so doing I ran get
r>n opportunity to present my case.
By my case, I mean not my case as
a geographical discoverer, but my
case as a man. Much as the attain
ment of the north pole once meant
t 0 me, tlie sympathy and co nfidenco
of my fellow men mean more.
"Fully, freely and frankly I shall
tell you everything. Toll you every
thing and leave the decision with you
Tf. after reading my story, you sav
Cook is sincere and honest, half
crazed by months of isolation and
hunger, he believed hp reached the
pole, he is not a faker, then I shall
be satisfied."
Cook tells the story of his life and
pictures what he calls the overpow
ering ambition of an exploration that
beset him. until it finally culminated
in his effort to reach the pole. Cook
declares that at the time he con
vinced himself that '.e had discovered
the pole he was half mad. He spent
two years in his ouest and during that
time endured hunger and privations
that, he says, would unbalance anj
mind.

hearing of it. When asked whethei
he would have anything to say aftei

that iie did not think he would.
