its Importan^— Never, in
our memory, has there been so mu<|b ado made
by oof' people on the subject of as
at this time, and indeed for a month or so pasjj|
The general and prevailing enquiry of the peo"
pie is, how shall wo put a stop to the sale of
whiskey and other intoxicating drinks to those
who may give us trouble? Every one must
agree that the indiscriminate sale of intoxicating
drinks is not only injurious to the community,
but is risking material and serious danger. The
argument has been used for years past, but
never before has it been so forcibly and strik
ingly exhibited to our people as of late. The
presence in our vicinity of large bodies of stran
gers whose numbers more than double the entire
population of our county, many of whom, as is
the case with our own people, being fond of
‘•'a drop,” coupled with the fact that some of
our people as also some of those very strangers,
not understanding each other, entertain feelings
of mutual dislike, shows us as a reasonable con
clusion that when a little too much of the
“lively” has been indulged iu disorder and some
times unpleasant collisions might result, and no
telling where all this might end.
One of the evil consequences of this state of
things is, that often the entire population on the
one side and the whole military on the other is
held responsible for individual misconduct.
Two, four, or a dozen soldiers, having a mis
conceived prejudice against our people, find their
way to our village and by some means, we wot
not of, either on their road or in town, become
p )ssossod of sufficient whiskey to intoxicate
themselves, and drowning all their better quali
ties provoke an uncalled for misunderstanding
with citizens, in some cases making unprovoked
assaults upon peaceable and unoffending per
sons, frightening families from their homes and
other like reprehensible conduct, as our own
little town can bear witness—all from the effects
of ardent spirits sold them or furnished directly
or indirectly by citizens of the county, in defi
ance of express injunction to the contrary.
This state of things can only have a tendency
to injure both parties. There are many of all
the regiments stationed in the county who can
no doubt bear testimony to the advantages of a
pfoper understanding and friendly intercourse
with the people of Charles county, and we
know that a proper friendship is, to say the
least, pleasant to the people of Charles. Then
why not encourage this sentiment and this in
tercourse? It can certainly do no harm, and
might on many occasions do much good.
There is one way in which this may be brought
about, and we not only suggest the idea but ear
nestly recommend the adoption, and that de
pends upon the acquiescence of our liquor deal
ers throughout the neighborhoods in question.
If they will put their shoulders to the wheel the
car of quietude and peace will move smoothly
f "on. It is for them to say, ceasa, and the fivtl is
over. Gentlemen, will you not do it? ,
In connection with this matter, we will call
attention, without comment, to another matter
of vital importance, and for the benefit of those
concerned we simply publish the law of the
land as found in the Maryland Code,
[extracts.]
Art. 66. See. 19.—N0 person shall sell to any
slave any goods or chatties whatever, without the
permission in writing of the master, employer, or
overseer of such slave.
Sec. 20.—Any person who shall violate the afore
going section, shall on conviction thereof before a
j usticc of the peace of the city or county where the
offence is committed, be fined five dollars, one half
to the city or county and the other half to the in
former.
Sec. 75.—N0 retailer, ordinary keeper, or other
person, shall sell any ardent spirits, gunpowder,
shot, or load, to any free negro, unless such free
negro shall produce a certificate iu the nature' of a
license or permit from a justice of the peace of the
county in which such free negro may reside, di
rected to the person so selling the same; and any
person so offending shall for each offence, be sub
ject to the penalty of five dollars.
Arrested. —Mr. Brown, Principal of Char
lotte Hall School, was taken through our village
yesterdaj', under arrest by the military, to Gen.
Hooker’s headquarters. What the charges a
gainst him are we have not learned.
—.—
Fire. —On Thursday uight last the pen-house
and provender of Benjamin Welch, of Nanjemoy
• district, was burned. Mr. W.’s loss was con
siderable, bis crop of tobacco, fodder, much of
bis corn, all his farming utensils, and a beef
housed in the destroyed. Whether
the work of an intentional incendiary or of ac
cident, is not known. If the latter, it is but
another proof of the necessity for great care in
handling fire near combustible materials,
■
Volunteers Wanted. — We learn from the
St, Mary’s Beacon, that Capt. Randolph Jones
has been authorized by the Executive of this
State to recruit a company of Cavalry, to con
sist of eighty men, from the counties of St.
Mary’s, Charles. Calvert and Prince George’s,
as a portion of the Maryland contingent for the
"United States’ service. The pay, rations, boun
ties, <Src., of the privates will be the same as
those of other Maryland companies now mus
tered into that service.
B@”The correspondent, “Lookout,” of the
Baltimore Clipper, writing from Washington,
says:—“The officers and men of regiment after
regiment, from Pennsylvania and New York,
express themselves as outraged to the last de
gree, at the development of the design, by reck
less fanatics, to trade in their blood. They left
their homes and families, they say, not to pro
mote the policy of Garrison, the Beechers,
Wendell Phillips, and the like, but to maintain
the Constitution and restore the Union, and
when the latter objects become lost sight of by
the Government and some other project—asm:
abolition crusade —is substituted for it, thejjpro
lay down their arms. They, doubtljas/iool
with confidence to the President tmpeep thi
ship of state iu the right track, andspßl leadin'

j Senator Trumbull’s Views on the Sla
very Question. — Washington, Dec. B.—The
following paragraph was unintentionally omit
ted in the transmission of the recent speech o]
! Senator Trumbull:
“Without any special act of Congress, I pre
• sume no one questions that our military com
- rnanders, in the prosecution of the war in insur-
I rcctionary districts, may, for the time being
seize and make use of the property of ti e rebels
and their slaves; but on the restoration of peace
I the right of the owners would revive. Hence
i if we would have uniformity of action ainonf
, the commanders of armies, and forfeit for
ever the property ofrebels and their claims tt
the service of their fellow meu, it must be done
by act of Congress.”

Message of President Lincoln. —For the
want of space to insert the whole of President
Lincoln’s Message, we avail ourself of the fol
-1 lowing summary of its contents from the Balti
. more Sun :
The Message opens with a recognition of ex
isting “political troubles,” but expresses grati
tude to God for the prosperous harvests and
general health.
! In reference to the action of the seceded States,
. the President anticipates the possibility of an
. appeal for foreign aid, or of foreign interposition
and though admitting the non-interference ol
European powers hitherto, it is deemed expedi
, ent to suggest the arming and fortifying of the
Northern ports and the lake coasts to be pre
pared for any contingency in the future.
Suggestion is also made for co-operation witl
C Kentucky’ and certain districts of Tennessee and
f North Carolina against the seceded States, anr
the building of a railroad in aid of the purpose
Indemnity is recommended in the case of the
’ British ship Perthshire, for illegal detention un
t der the blockade.
i The recognition of Hayti and Liberia is ap
proved.
The revenue from all sources fur the fisca
5 y’ear ending June 30, 1801, was $80,830,927
and the expenditures for the same period sß^,-
3 578,834, which-, with, previous balance injb<
3 Treasury, left a balance of two and a qflfmci
- millions. The revenue for the first dfuartei
since, ending September 30, is $102,#82,509
and the expenses $98,239,733. Fupnhe esti
’ mates for the three quarters and foi
' 1863, Congress is referred to the resort of th<
Secretary of the Treasury. It ijpalleged as s
gratifying fact that these expends are not be
yond the resources of a loyal people. It is als(
added that the number of trooter-offered for tlx
s war is beyond the requirementmf Congress.
The recommendations ofJJ*#Secretary of th

‘j Slaves at Hilton Head.—The newspapers.
£ have published most exaggerated accounts of
the coming in of slaves at Port Royal. From
several gentlemen who have recently returned,
from that port, we learn facts which are to be
relied on as true. The negroes have come to the
_ Port to sell provisions, poultry, Ac., and their
- supplies have been bought. Others have come
from curiosity, and loitered around awhile, go
® ing away again when they pleased. About IGO -
,f! remain in the Port, having been employed l.u
:t i work, receiving rations and $8 per month.— -
! The total number that have come in on any and .
every pretext does not exceed three hundred and
. I fifty.. No indication has been gifen of any de
sire liberty as a permanency. Their
I attachmenrTS their masters and the families to :
. j which they belong does not seem to be diminish
e j ed, and there are large numbers, probably thou-"*
- | sands of them in the neighborhood, who
T i not come into the Fort at all. No. reliance is
placed on any information they give. The army
i- j officers appear to think there is some reason tof
- ; the Southern law of excluding negro testimony.
” j The remark is very common that a negro will 1
H answer a question precisely as he thinks you
e { want him to, unless he has an end of his own
3, to serve, when that will determine his reply.—,
g The idea of putting muskets into the hands of
■-! such men as the slaves at Port Royal, is con-C
0 j sidered ridiculous as a military proposition, and
e | can he regarded only in the light of a proposal
; to incite them to murder their roasters and mis
j tresses, which no one who has seen them believes
,( they would do. It is said that a visit to South
, j Carolina has already opened the eyes of many
' i gentlemen, of former abolition inclinations to
a j some new facts in slavery.— N. Y. Journal of
e Commerce.

Jj WAR MOVEMENTS.
s From Missouri.
Syracuse, Mo., Dec. 7.—General Pope has
been assigned to the command of the Federal
. troops between the Missouri and Osage rivers.
s He is busy with preparations for winter quar
s j ters. Gen. Price is still south of the Osage* with
. | his Rebel troops. He is near Osceola, and is los

Kansas City, Dec. 7.—A band of Rebels en

J allegiance to the Southern Confederacy.
r j Major Genera! Hailed-: has issued an impor

1 j found within the lines of the army, in disguise
c 1 as loyal citizens, and giving information to the
’ j enemy, and all those taken from the ranks of
t the Rebels in actual service, shall not be treated
t las prisoners of war, but as spies, and shall be
shot. He further orders that the Provost Mar
shals of St. Louis shall take in charge the num
bers of Union families who are crowding into
that city—having been plundered and driven
_' from their homes by the Rebels—and quarter
d j them upon avowed. Secessionists, charging the

I Another Southern Account of the Fight at
• Pensacola. •
j ! The Pensacola Observer has the following ;
( | While we are not able to give the full par-
j ticulars of the casualties, the fight, we
, ! are prepared to correct soaje errors we were led
g [ into by Madam llunujjMlWt was not the Niagara
i but the ColoradoJJrat was injured in the en-
I gagement, and has ‘‘hauled off.”
Nearly whole of Warrington has been re-
by the enemy’s shot and shell.
! our batteries are injured, and among
fettle buildings destroyed are the St. John’s and
the Catholic churches. The houses occupied by
’g the officers are only slightly damaged. As to
;r the injury done the enemy, any report made is
’ all speculation, and no reliable or truthful state
j merits have come from there yet. All our bat
jj teries have been worked with great credit to
” those in charge of them. On yesterday there
were thirteen of Abe’s vessels in sight, but from
their tardiness in commencing the fight this
morning we arc led to believe that “somebody
is hurt.” A gentleman just from Warrington
| confirms the report that the firing of the enemy
16 iis very bad and of very little effect. Ho says
! he counted over twenty shells lying there on a
street, none of them having exploded.
01 1 The force engaged has been Mcßae’s and
Wheat’s and another battery, all from Loaisi
j_ ana and Mississippi.
From the Charleston Courier, Nov. 29th.
lo Pensacola, Nv. 23 —8 A. M.—Both parties
ie are silent this morning. I walked down to the
or beach this morning and looked at Pickens. She
of seems considerably battered. A long dark place
upon her side, which the men say is shot
of marks, was plainly visible. Poor Fort Mcßae
suffered yesterday far more than we thought,
■ts Six men wore killed by the falling of the cover
of ;of a rest, and ten others wounded. They say
e- \ five hundred shot and shell fell into the fort.—
u-! The damage was dune by the ships, which took
ty position southwest of the fort, where the guns
ns i could not bo very effective, and fired broadside
i after broadside upon her. A battery located
la-!just back of her aided in repelling the attack
>d. and, it is said, struck them fifteen limes. Oulv
is- two’ships are off the harbor this morning. 1
; fear neither party will renew the fight this
morning. If they do Mcßae will probably In
be abandoned during the day, and the battery be
of! hind her worked,- But if she was leveled to th
es sand, nothing would be accomplished toward:
oi- i the reduction of our batteries. We have neve
v counted ber as anything in the fight.

, 'Mr. Ggfusborougli was decided to be duly elec

Mr. Goldsborough was then conducted to the
Chair by Messrs. Smith and Sellrnan, and ad-
I I "dressed the Senate as follows:
-► ADDUESS OF PRESIDENT GOf.DSEO BOUGH.
r Senators, the vote just announced, while it con
l veys a flattering expression of your confidence,
( which I highly appreciate, imposes upon me the
r duties of a position filled with responsibility.
f Called together under circumstances unusually
I 'extraordinary, at a period the most trying since
the foundation of our State, we should gravely con
sider the best course of legislative policy with a
firm determination to adhere thereto. Distinguiah
; cd for a loyalty superior to party, and for a love of
the Union of these Stales unexampled, Maryland
is now called to witness scenes of fraternal strife
from which every patriot’s eye would be gladly
i averted, and to testify anew her devotion to the
emblems of our national pride and honor.
The sounds of martial music, accompanied with
military array of a character never before witness
ed within our borders, attest the fact that those
with whom wc have hitherto lived in peace and
amity have, in tjie madness of the hour, seen fit to
appeal to the sword as the dread arbitrament of
; those questions which have hitherto been so satis
factorily adjusted at the ballot-box. However
much we may have deprecated this solution of our
differences, the sad alternative of disunion or civil
war is now upon us, and wc must meet the crisis
ns men who know their rights, and knowing dare
maintain them.
The Executive of your State, exerting his consti
tutional power, has thus far preserved us from in
ternal strife such as exists in other central States,
while the gieat body of the people elsewhere have
voluntarily rushed to arms for the protection of the
only temple of constitutional liberty now in exis-
L tence. His judicious course, thus sanctioned, in
’ Hicatcs that in the judgment of the people of this
j par tX)Lthis uobi& atxuclure should be dc
■ seroyed, but that our energies should be devoted to
guard, preserve and uphold it against internal as
well as external foes.
Situated in the very heart of this great nation,
Maryland must necessarily exercise a powerful in
fluence on the conduct of the respective parties to
this unhappy fraternal contest. A united and con
servative course may do much lo allay embittered
feelings, and reproduce in the minds of men all
over the country a sense of the importance of that
full, fair and honest recognition of constitutional
rights so essentirl to the unity and perpetuity of
our National as well as State Government.
As your presiding officer, I beseech the cultiva
tion of the most enlarged patriotic feelings—such
as animated the early patriots of the State, the com
panions in arms, the friends of that illustrious pa
triot, the crowning act of whose life, in this cham
ber, admonishes us how utterly unworthy are all
selfish partizan purposes compared with our coun
try’s welfare and our country’s good.
Let u.s cherish his oft-repeated warnings against
sectional strife and geographical parties. The
scenes daily transpiring in our Southern sister
States strongly impress us with the truth of the
motto “United wc stand, divided we fall”—threat
ening, as they do, the dissolvcraent of the most
cherished rights of man.
1 Be prudent—firm—decided. Maryland’s posi
tion is that of a loyal State. Her will must be faith
fully respected in the enactment of laws that will
cause her safety to be no longer endangered by
i fomenters of civil discord, or aiders or abettors of
those who seek for partisan purposes to destroy a
Constitution formed by the wisdom of our fathers,
and a Union cemented by their blood.
Standing as peers in this Senatorial Chamber, I
, shall endeavor to administer this office with cour
, tesy, avoiding all partisan considerations.
Thanking you for this marked manifestation of
your confidence, I now assume the. duties of the
qhair, trusting that our mutual consultations may
. be directed to the welfare of our beloved State and
the perpetuity of that Union transmitted by our
fathers, jvhicl), if ever destroyed, no human
power wilFbe abte.ip reconstruct.
■ The newly elected Senators were then called

Mr. Sellrnan, of Anno ArundeTkoffered the
following order:
Ordered, That Chapman Harwood.of AnnWaun

\ Mr.*Smith, of Carroll, offered the following
order :
Ordered, That the seat of Coleman Yellott, late
1 Senator from Baltimore, be declared vacant, and

Mr. Townsend offered an order of thanks to

r; Gentlemen of ike House of Delegates —l aoSaully
pi sensible of the honor which your vote basest cou
-1 for rod upon me.
, To he elected a member of this Etopse by any '
, portion of tiro people of Maryland, time like |
tin; present, is an honor excregjleiuxnily by the re
sponsibility it imposes.
To he called by the almost unanimous voice of
the Delegates chosen at sqcii a time to preside over
their deliberations, is a promotion which any man
. may recount with pride.Hor the remainder of his
. . - ip
I am fully aware of jllre responsibility of the du
r ties, at once high anfidelicate, which this position :
imposes. jp
, _ I know it Tequilas energy, determination, deci
, sion, so mingled struct impartiality, courtesy
. and prudence, asA he often of' most difficult per
formance ; and knowing these things, and my own
r deficiencies alsegr I must ask that your partiality
- shall not IcaveJmc when it has placed rnc here.—
. Without its cofitinuance I must fail.
, Wc have Jjfeen called to tire highest duty to the
State, at asnourent after the greatest imminent j
• danger harassed, it is true; but at a moment when '
3 prudence_nd patience and forbearance in some |
. things are indispensable as instant riction and the i
cnonjptic blow on other tilings.
We are to debate and discuss and determine tire
j mode in which thataction is to be further carried on.
In such debates, on such subjects, in times like i
these, it is impossible that there should not he wide J
c differences of opinion, leading, in heat of ungarded :
- expression, sometimes to asperity, sometimes to tire
most unpleasant situations.
It is the duty of the Speaker to prevent this if he
can, to check it when he must; and unless he can
have your forbearance, your indulgence, and your
• ready and effective aid at all times, tic cannot suc
ceed in this duty. It is the House itself sometimes
I that he must restrain ; he who is but the agent, and
only one, of the House. In discharging the duties
of this place, iran only promise the sincere en
deavor to aid the labors of this House, so important
S now, when even the duration of a session in antici
. pation of the regular assembly may be too short
for the work before us.
Count upon your end, and with that I feel sure
our success, so far as it depends on the mode of
- conducting our business, will be complete.
, Gentlemen, let us so conduct the business of this
3 House that when we shall have finished it we shall
have nothing to regret, either in what has been
j done, or in the mode of doing it. Let us be able lo
3 say at parting that, notwithstanding inevitable and
. inconceivable differences of opinion as to matters of
\ detail—nay, because such differences were inecon
- cilable —wc continued and ended, as we begun,
f with a determination to work together for the pub
] lie service; to that end sacrificing all personal opin
-3 ions and preferences which did not involve con
r science or conviction of duty and patriotism.
? I thank you, gentlemen, for the honor you have
conferred. I respectfully invite your assistance to
i aid me in my duties.

House of Delegates.—At eleven o’clock
s this morning the House was called to order, and
after the reading of the journal several orders
. were offered.
IL An order was adopted appointing Rev. Mr.
Davenport Chaplain of the House for the present
SCSSlu&fe
Mr.Jjurton, of Cecil, offered an order that
i copies ofkdie Journal of the House be regularly
mailed to Wfc editors of all loyal papers.
1 On motioCThomas J. Wilson was declared
Printer of thiUlouse for the present session,
| Air. Fiudlej'jfcf Washington, offered the fol
lowing order :
Ordered, That a*Wimmittcc be appointed to in
. quire aa to the melafiug of Secretary Cameron’s
proposition for thejpvision and partition of the
State of Maryland, ffclawarc and Virginia
= Air. Johnson, of I*tm iore county, asked that
the matter be laid oVOT,ff ir the present. I e
*5 thought it better to waittftitil we receive an offi
cial copy of the report, ;d then refer it to a
committee. There no mistake as to
3 the purpose of Air. Camel* which purpose he
r had further explained t a to the
. preparation of his report. to give
Western Maryland to Virginia aflßkEastern
. Maryland to Delaware, whilst we welWto be
. tacked on to Central and Eastern Yirgitnibflu d
t as what was left of Maryland would be snrfcer
than that portion of Virginia added to befall
y you may suppose I earnestly opposed it. He
thought its consideration had better be deferred
t fur the present. *
o Air. Coale, of Frederick, thought it ought not
to boa subject of inquiry, but a subject of pre
- test —a iin lignant and emphatic protest.
a | Air. Mathews, of Baltimore, thought that the
subject ought to go to the Committee on Fede
i-! ral Relations for inquiry. There was no doubt
s that the Government had no authority to inter
| fere with the matter, and no right to act iude
- 1 pendent of Maryland. Let it be referred to a
: committee, not for the purpose of consideration,
. ! but for the purpose of emphatic protest.
Air. Findley thought we ought to protest on
;s the subject emphatically without any delay, and
i urged immediate action on the subject,
it Mr. Donaldson said we wore giving the sub
d |ject too much importance. There could be no
doubt that the people of MaryiandUalfoiild not
. for a moment sincerely entertain a project.
The Government lias to interfere in
1 this matter, as Ktiggestwijy my friend from
Baltimore. Wo have qftr boundaries fixed long
ago, and no jiuliticaffWiloring can alter them.,
1 We cannot furgetj*fr*history—we cannot forget,
our we cannot permit our State
I to bo placed, like a piece of cloth, in the hands :
of a polit caljtaiior to shape and fashion to suit
his own purposes—or as a piece of paper in the.
j hands of.a child to be shaped and fashioned ac-,.
cording to his fancy. lie hoped the subject
would not be dignified by reference to a com
mittee, but that it would be laid on the table
and not even honored by a Consideration. It
was worthy only of an emphatic and uncondi
tional protest, if at all coos'dcred. lie would
j therefore move that it be laid on the table, as
| its reference to a committee would indicate that
I we proposed to give it consideration.
i Mr. Cresswell, of Cecil, would say that the ..
'light in which the matter is regarded in his
I comity is that of a pleasant joke—a little scheme
j to extend Mr. Cameron’s Northern Qfen tral Rail
j way to the Delaware Bay. We look upon it as
a joke not to be entertained seriously for a mo
ment. and which should not be dignified by u
reference to a committee.
The House then unanimously laid the subject
on the table.
Dr. Phelps presented an order for the levying
of the direct tax to pay Maryland’s full quota
of the tax debt, which is pretty much in accord
ance with the plan for levying and collecting .
I the war tax. He submitted it with the purpose
| of having it referred to the proper committee
: when that committee should he appointed. '* l^
) A message was received from the Governor''’
by the hands of Mr. Wilson, Secretary of State,
; transmitting the letter from the Secretary of .the,
j Treasury relative to Maryland’s quota of the
' war tax.
j A long and unimportant debate on the sub
ject of providing the members of the House with
copies of the Code and Constitution ensued, when
the action of yesterday was rescinded, and an
order adopted f*r the lurnishing of the members
without any restriction as to returning them at
i the close of the session.
j Mr. Mathews, of Baltimore city, obtained leave
to introduce a bill to repeal that portion of the

OBITUARY.
“Friend after friend departs.
Who has not lost a friend?
There is no union here of hearts
That finds not here an end.”
At the residence of her father, in Franklin coun
ty, Mo., on the 9th of November, after a protiacted
illness, CYNTHIA A., beloved wife of Dr. J. R.
Nalley, (formerly of Charles county, Md.,) and
last surviving daughter of R. R. and Cynthia
j-Gkegory, aged 25 years and 3 months.
r Young, affectionate and beloved, with devoted
parents and brother, an attached husband, and
darling babe, nothing seemed wanting to fill her
cup of earthly happiness, save health, which she
often wished for, though not repiningly. To her
''friends she expressed a willingness to die, and to
her father a few days before her decease, she said:
“Father, I love God, I fear the pain of death, but
all beyond the grave is bright,”—well might he
remark l I would not take thousands for that one
expression, for it g-ives me a certainty of meeting'
my child hereafter. In tire endearing relations of
child, wife, mother and sister, she performed her
duties with respect, affection and kindness; ampng
her friends, sire was justly the favorite,* T and* all vf *
were attracted by her sweet disposition and grace
ful winning manners. Leading - a blameless life,
the smile of a happy, chistian death was stamped
on her features.
Scarce two years ago she stood a happy bride,
receiving tire congratulations of her friends, now
in the world of bliss a welcome angel, overlooking
the sad hearts mourning her early removal from
their midst. To her grief-stricken parents, who
have lost the prop of their declining years, and her
afflicted husband, may heavenly consolation bo
given, and may God, who lias grieved, also cheer
them, and lead them out of trouble, with hearts
renewed with love for Him. —Franklin Co. {Mo.)
