The Sumter Coffin and Casket Co.,
has, at the request of those in charge
of the Sumter County exhibit, pre?
pared a cotefplete exhibit of the pro?
duct of their factory and it is now
ready for i^'ipment. But at this late
day objection bas been raised to hav?
ing this ?ihr?it"included in the Sum?
ter conn ty display.' We do not see that
the objection Is well taken, for if this
county is J to have a complete exhibit
of the protiact of its factories, cof5ns
and caskets must be included, "he
manufacture bf coffins and caskets is
a large and important industry-one
of the mosir important of the coun ty.
The Sumter Coffin and Casket Co* has
expended considerable money and time
on the preparation of their exhibit and
it is but; natural that the members of
the firm do;not want tc lose whatever
benefit ?i8yj^night^derive from having
it on exhibition in Charleston. If
. they had not taken the trouble to pre?
pare the exhibit no question would be
raised, but having incurred the ex?
pense of jiraparing it they object seri?
ously to "being ruled out at the eleventh

Senator*Eodge, who is the recogniz?
ed administration leader-in the Senate,
has intro^ced a Philippine tariff bill
that will ate?t'th? conditions brought
about by>.the recent. decision of the
Supreme^S-kfcrt rn the "fourteen dia?
mond rings" case. This Republican
measure treats the Philippines as for?
eign territory for tariff taxation pur?
poses, arti5leeiex-ported therefrom hav?
ing to pay: itu import tax before enter?
ing the Umteft' States and all articles
imported fr^ the United States must
pay an import before entering any
Philippine port. Nevertheless the
Philippines 'is claimed as American
territory'oy treaty and purchase, and
tfee inhabitants who are in arms
against American fule are branded as
traitors. 3*fee colonial policy - inau?
gurated by vtbe ^Republicans is giving
rise to newr^rdblems all the time and
' the deviotts-measures adopted to avert
the logical consequences of the ac?
quirement of "territory are flatly con?
tradictory of precedents and what
have been.- regarded as fundamental
. principles that should be the basis of
all Americian policies.
The New-York Evening Post is air?
ing a report from Gainesville, Fla.,
that Mrs. J. B. Johnson has been
removed from her position as princi?
pal of the Dade City High School be?
cause she taught nergo teachers in
the summer vacation by appointment
. of the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction. The story may be true,
but we have doubts, because it is so
directly at variance with the policy of
Southern educators. In this State,
as is well known, prominent white
public school teachers and college
professors have, for several years,
taught in the State summer school for
negro teachers and no prejudice was
aroused and no one had ought but
praise for ^the teachers who accepted
this work at the request of the State
Superintendent of Education. Mrs.
Johnson -may have been dismissed
from the Dade City High School, but
it is quite possible that her removal
was due to other causes than the fact
vthat she taught in a summer school
for negro teachers.
Senators McLaurin and Tillman are

The tariff is again the paramount
issue in Congress and the Democrats
have an opportunity to put the Repub?
licans in a hole. A winning fight for
the reduction of the tariff on necessi?
ties will be a victory over the trusts
that will benefit the masses and deal
the monopolists a severe blow.
Cotton Guesser Neill 'maintains that
the horse is seventeen feet high. His
last crop estimate is eleven anda quar?
ter million bales, and this estimate
ho puts out in opposition to and in
contradiction of the government re?
port issued on Tuesday. His estimates
have been so wide of the mark for thc
past few years that he has lost the
almost implicit confidence the public
once placed in his estimates. Some
years ago he had the power to ad?
vance or depress the price of cotton by
simply issuing an estimate, but now
what he says does not go without ques?
tion in the cotton markets of the
world.

THE NEW SHIP SUBSIDY BILL.
Senator Frye Introduces One
Somewhat Different From
Hanna Payne Measure.
"Washington, Dec. 9.-Senator Frye
today introduced the new ship subsidy
bill. It differs in form from the sub?
sidy bill of the past two sessions. It
is divided into four titles and fifteen
sections.
The sections under the title "ocean
mail steamships" are devoted to
amendments to the ocean mail act of
1891. The postmaster general is
required to consider the national de?
fense and the maritime interests of the
United States as well as postal inter?
ests ia providing for the transportation
of American ocean mails. The present
limit of ocean mail contracts, 10 years,
is increased to 15 years. ^ The Frye
bill provides seven distinct classes
with * rate of S6 to 20-knot steamers
increasing from 8,000 to 10,000 tons
the minimum size; S3 for 16-knot
steamers provided the size is increased
from 5,000 tons, the present minimum
to 8,000 tons. The proposed maximum
mail rates per gross ton per hundred
nautical miles are :
Over 10,000 tons-20 knots 2.7 cents;
19 knots 2.5 cents.
Over 5,000 tons-18 knots 2.3 cents ;
17 knots 2.1 cents ; 16 knots 1.9 cents ;
15 knots 1.7 cents.
Over 2,000 tons-14 knots 1.5 cents.
Kates for mail steamers to the West
Indies, Central America and Mexico
cannot exceed 70 per cent, of the
maximum rates.
The second title "general subsidy"
contains the general subsidy for all
vessels, Eiteam or sail, which are not
under mail contracts. This general
subsidy is uniform, 1 cent per gross
ton per 100 nautical miles for not ex?
ceeding 16 entries in one year.
To promote the building of new
ocean vssels an additional allowance
o? one-fourth of a cent per gross ton is
made foi five years.
' Any vessel to receive the general
subsidy must carry mails, if required
and must train in seamanship or engi?
neering one American youth for each
1,COO tons, the vessel to be at the ser?
vice of the government, if required for
defense.
.Any vessel to receive subsidy must
be class Al and at least one-fourth of
the crew must be Americans.
The bill provides an annual bounty
of $2 a ton for deep sea fishing vessels,
and of $1 a month for American citizens
when engaged in deep sea fisheries;
that a vessel shall receive only one
form of subsidy and that a vessel which
has received a subsidy shall not be sold .
to a foreigner except by consent of the
secretary of the treasury.
The bill does nat provide American
registry for foreign ships owned by
Americans.
The Confiscated Liquor.
Columbia, Dec. 9.-The effect of the
attorney generals' opinion in the mat?
ter of the return of liquors seized by
the constables has been to at once
throw upon the chief executive the
consideration and disposition of many
applications that were pending befor?
the State board.
The governor tackled the job yester?
day and disposed of a number of cases.
One interest] ng case was from Abbe?
ville county. Two negroes were car?
ried before Magistrate Ashley and the
wagon they were driving was con?
fiscated. ? One negro was fined and the
other was discharged. The magistrate
asked what to do with the mule and
wagon. It seems that the team be?
longed tc a white man who had abso?
lutely no knowledge of the liquor mat?
ter. The governor ordered the team re?
turned to its owner.
Some men put a team belonging to
Probate Judge Ira B. Jones of Lan?
caster county to the same use in the
same manner and the constable took
the team. The governor promptly or
dreed this team returned also.
A unique case is up from Sumter
county. A gentleman there ordered
a case of whiskey for his personal
use : it was seized by the constables
and shipped to Columbia : the govern?
or ordered it returned. When it was
being boxed up to be shipped it was
discovered that two of the dozen bot?
tles that were there when it was seized
had disappeared. The State board has
been advised that the price of the two
missing bottles must be paid to the
owner.
Several minor applications for the
return cf liquors undoubtedly bought
for personal use were granted, and
some dozen or more for the return of
liquors evidently bought for illicit pur?
poses were refused.-The State.
Mr. Carnegie and His Castle.
The public will regret to learn that
somebody is trying to make trouble
for Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The great
steel king and founder of libraries
owns a castle-Skibo castle as every
ene knows, or ought to know. Mr.
Carnegie bought the place in 1S98 for
$425.000, which wasn't much, but Mr.
Carnegie is democratic and doesn't
care a great deal for castles. He could
have bought a higher priced article if
he had wished to do so. But now
comes Mr. Evan Charles Sutherland
and sues in the Edinburgh court of
sessions to have the sale to Mr. Car?
negie set asido. Mr. Sutherland says
he bought Skibo castle in 1872 and
paid 86.~)0,000 for it, and that he con?
veyed it as security to two concerns
fn?m which he borrowed money. It is
alleged that there were i regularities
and the plaintiff wants the sale set
aside.
We know nothing of the merits of
this suit, but eur sympathies are with
Mr. Carnegie. We dislike to see his
leg pulled, except in the regular way,
the method which he has indicate:! as
most agreeable to himself.--Allanta

Carnegie's Last and Greatest Gift.
Ten Million Dollars For Univer?
sity of Washington-Govern?
ment Will Act as Trustee.
Washington. Dec. 9.-The Washing
ton Post tomorrow will say : *
President Roosevelt has receivd a
letter from Andrew Carnegie, in which
the latter offers to make a donation of
610,000,000 to the United States. The
letter will be referred to congress by
the president in a special message.
Mr. Carnegie's gift is for the pur?
pose of establishing in Washington a
university for higher education. As
far as his idea has been developed,
it proposes a gift after the manner of
the bequest of James Smithson, the
Englishman, who gave 81,000,000 for
the establishment and maintenance of
what is now known as the Smithson?
ian institute. ' Smithson desired the
institution founded by him to be a
factor in "the diffusion of scientific
knowledge." Mr. Carnegie proposes
that the university which he is to en?
dow shall be the greatest institution
in the world for the development of
higher education, fie has consulted
President Gilman of Jones Hopkins
university ; President Hadley of Yale :
President Eliot of Harvard; Former
President White of Cornell, and all
the leading educators of the country.
They heartily endorse his plans. The
proposed university will not interfere
in the least with the educational insti?
tutions already established, but will
supplement them, for, according to the
present plan, its doors will be open
only to those who desire to take up a
post graduate course. Mr. Carnegie
also wants the new university to take
the lead in original research, so that
the United States can eventually stand
side by side with Germany, if not
excel the nation, in scentific develop?
ment.
Mr. Carnegie's plan does not propose
a national university in the sense
that an appproriation will be asked or
needed. The government is simpply
to be the trustee or the magnificent
endowment,.just as it administers the
fund bequeathed by Smithson. It is
probable that a board of regents will
be appointed, as in the case of the
Smithsonian institute, or it may be
that the government will be represent?
ed upon the board of directors, which,
it is contemplated, shall consist of men
of national reputation.
Mr. Carnegie has kept the proposed
endowment a secret until he could
definitely arrange the plans and scope
of the new university. Even yet all
these details have not been arranged,
so that little more than the outline of
his gift can be published. It is known,
however, that he does not propose to
ask from congress a single foot of land
upon which the university buildings*
will be constructed. The entire ex?
pense is to be borne out of his endow?
ment. No site has yet been selected.
It will, however, necessarily be very
large, as it is proposed to erect a
series of magnificent structures.
The amount of money to be given by
Mr. Carnegie equals the sum of the
present endowment fund of Harvard,
and is considerably more than the in?
vested fund of Yale. With the Cath?
olic university, the Methodist univer?
sity and the proposed Carnegie uni?
versity, Washington will be the educa?
tional center of the country.
New Oil Competition.
Russia, which competes with the
United States for the export petroleum
trade of the world, produced in 1900 35
per cent, of all the petroleum offered
for sale in the markets of the world
namely, 365 million gallons, out of a
total production of one billion gallons.
But Russia in the same year produced
three and a third billion gallons of
naptha, while the production of the
United States was only two and one
tenth billion gallons.
The weakness shown by Russia in
supplying the world's petroleum mark?
et was due to the fact that the Rus?
sian freight rates to the seaboard were
too high and the means of transporta?
tion insufficient. The reason usually
given in Russia in explanation of why
producers give more attention to the
manufacture of naptha products than
to the refining of oil is correct only be?
cause of the obstacles to transporta?
tion just mentioned.
At present the means for conveying
the oil from the shores of the Caspian
Sea, where it is produced, to the
Black Sea, where it is opened to th?
markets of the world, is by the Bakn
Batum Railway. This line is 558
miles long and has a double track for
only two short stretches. It is capa?
ble of transporting with its present
equipment only about 400,000,000 gal?
lons per annum, but the amount is
rarely over 300,000,000 gallons, owing
to the frequency of railway accidents.
The Russian Government is seeking
to facilitate the transportation cf oil
by the construction of a pipe line,
which will parallel the railroad. There
have been about 230 miles of this line
constructed so far, and an imperia
order has been issued for the construc?
tion of the rest. This will give an an?
nual output of 625,000,000 gallons per
annum. The cost for transmission for
each pood (five gallons) of petroleum
through the pipe line will cost the
State six-tenths of a cent, the net cost
by rail being two cents.
These statistics, which are taken
from the advance sheets of the con?
sular reports, make it clear that the
Russian petroleum industry will soon
be enabled to compete with the Ameri?
can in the markets of the world, if
other conditions remain favorable, for
the Trans-Caucasian petroleum pipe
line will force Russia into the world's
markets as a seller. This will place,
in Germany's hands a powerful
weapon in the negotiating of new com
mecial treaties with Russia. Courier

Our Senators Nade a Spectacle of i
Themselves Monday.
Conduct Bordering on the Ridicu- j
lous-Reminder of Gaffney.
Washington, Dec. 9.-The spectators
in the crowded galleries of the senate
thought for a time this afternoon that
they were to witness the spectacle of
two Palmetto State senators resigning
their seats. It was one of the most
dramatic scenes witnessed in the his?
toric chamber for many years, when
Senator Tillman challenged Senator
McLaurin to quit the senatein company
with him and to go borne and wash
their dirty linen. One of the amusing
features of the entire affair was that
after the two South Carolinians had
pitched in and lugged at each other,
the grave and sedate Senator Hoar, of
I Massachusetts, got a chance to review
the law and the precedent in such
cases, from all of which he drew the
conclusion that the seats were really
vacant because the two senators after
they had once resigned to the governrr
could not recall their resignations.
The fight started with Senator Mc?
Laurin rising to a question of person?
al privilege. Senator Tillman sat but
a few feet away and scowled fiercely
as his colleague proceeded. Mr. Mc?
Laurin referred to the criticisms of
himself in the public prints and to the
newspaper statements that he had
been denied admission to the Demo?
cratic caucus. He insisted that he
was still a Democrat and was urging
the appointment of Democrats to
office, but when he could not get Dem?
ocrats appointed he wanted to see de?
cent Kepublicans appointed for the ac?
commodation of the people of his State
and for the benefit of the public ser?
vice. Senator Jones, of Arkansas,
took a hand and said he had asked
Mr. McLaurin last spring whether he
wanted to be included in the Demo
j eratic caucus and McLaurin had told
him that he did not wish" to go into
; the Democratic caucus, as it might be
j embarrassing to him, nevertheless he
wished to attend.
Senator Jones added that for two
years Mr. McLaurin had been voting
with the Kepublicans and he (Jones)
had said on the Republican side of the
j chamber that he did not think the
Democrats would like to have charged
to them any committee assignments
that might be given to Mr. McLaurin.
Senator Tillman finally got a word
and while responding, as stated above,
declared that a little later he would
reply at greater length. He said he
hoped the matter of resignations, dis?
cussed by Senator Hoar, might be
taken up by the committee on judici?
ary.*
While Senator Hoar was talking dur?
ing the controversy Mr. McLaurin
tried to break in but did not succeed.
Senator Hoar declared that in 125
years there had been about 200 resig?
nations of senators and Senator Mc'Lau
rin's case was the only one where the
resignation had been withdrawn.
As the wrangling continued the senate
went into executive session. - ^

Winter Service From the Northwest to
Florida, Season I90M902.
The Southern Railway, with its
Florida connections^-the Plant System
and Florida East Coast Railway will,
beginning January 6th, inaugurate its
especially high class class service be?
tween Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburg,
Detroit, Louisville and Cincinnati via
Chattanooga, Atlanta, Macon and Jesup
to Jacksonville and St. Augustine.
The Cincinnati & Florida Limited
will continue to mn as at present
leaving Cincinnati 8.30 a. m., south?
bound and leaving Jacksonville 7:45 p.
m. northbound, this being a through
train with Pullman sleepers, coaches
and cafe cars, running daily between
Jacksonville and Cincinnati. This
train will be supplemented on January
6th by a through sleeping car between
St. Augustine and Chicago via the
Monch Route north of Cincinnati.
The Chicago and Florida Special
which was inaugurated January 15th
last and which made for itself such an
enviable record and was the means of
inducing much travel from Chicago
and the West'to Florida, will begin
January 5th, 1901, this season and .run
until the close of the Florida Tourist
season. This train will have sleeping
cars between Chicago and St. Augus?
tine daily except Sunday via both he
Big Four and Penna, Lines ; between
Cleveland and St. Augustine via the
Big Four ; between Pittsburg and St.
Augustine via Penna, Lines; and be?
tween Louisville and St. Augustine via
Southern Railway. The cars from
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Pitts?
burg uniting at Cincinnati, leave Cin?
cinnati southbound at 9.30 p. m., tak?
ing on the Observation Sleeping Car
from Louisville, Ky., at Lexington,
Ky., passing Atlanta next morning
10:35 a. m., arriving Jacksonville
8:30 p. m., St. Augustine 9:30 p. m.
This train will have complete dining
car service and will be established this
year a week sooner than it was put
on last season, and it is expected will
even be more successful than last sea?
son, which was the first year the train
was operated. The enterprise of the
officiais of the Southern Railway in
establishing this expensive and luxur?
ious service has a great influence in
the directing of tourists from Chicago
and the west and also from the Central
States to Florida as against Califor
fornia. California has in recent
years made a very strong bid
for this tourists business, but with
the superb service, being double daily
and mest, luxurious, from Central
States to Florida and advantages of
Florida as a tourists resort, it is ex
pected that a larger number of visitors
will go to Florida front the west and
northwest this season titan ever before,
arni the entire southwest will be
benefit ted by the increased number of
visitors, cte.
The Southern Railway has also now
in operation through sleeping cars
between Kansas City and Jacksonville
via Memphis, Birmingham and Atlan?
ta in connection with the Frisco Sys?
tem; and continue to operate the all
year round through sleeper between
Cincinnati and Jacksonville via Har
riman Junction, Knoxville, Asheville
Columbia and Savannah.

Municipal Restaurants.
The city of Nantes, in France, has
been recently experimenting in feed?
ing the poor and destitute by means
of municipal soup kitchens. At first
these charities were operated at a
heavy cost to the city, which has now
been reduced to about $1,500 a year.
The kitchens are opened from the
15th of October to the 15th of April,
and two meals are served each day
the morning one from 10:30 a. m. to
1:30 p. m. and an evening meal from
5 to 7:30 p. m. Tickets entitling the
holder to one dish on the bill of fare
are deposited for sale in the various
bakeries and tobacco shops of the city,
where they are purchased for gratuit?
ous distribution by the charitably dis?
posed.
The privilege of taking meals in
these kitchens is not restricted to the
destitute classes. Many laborers take
their meals there on account of the
moderate prices. For example, a meal
costing five cents can be obtained,
which will consist of a plate of meat,
a bowl of soup and a small loaf of
bread.
^ It is interesting to note in connec?
tion with these kitchens that no wine
is served in any of them.-Richmond
Times.
THETRUT SOLUTION.
Representative Kitchen, of North
Carolina, has introduced a joint reso?
lution providing for the repeal of the
Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitu?
tion of the United States.
Here is the simple solution of the
negro problem in politics.
We believe that the great majority
of the white people of the United
States are, at heart, in favor of Mr.
Kitchen's resolution, and if they had
the courage to vote as they think, a
dark cloud which hangs over this
country would be dissipated and the
political atmosphere would be much
clearer. We believe that the very
best thing that could happen tc the
black man would be the repeal of the
Fifteenth Amendment. An honest,
straightforward suffrage law would
then be enacted in each of the South?
ern States and the black man would i
be admitted to the suffrage as he !
showed himself to be qualified to vote I
intelligibly.
But the Northern people haven't the
courage to right the wrong that they
have done.-Richmond Times.
