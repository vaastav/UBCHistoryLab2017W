FINE FALL FOR FARMERS
Conditions in Laporte County Dupli
cated Through Northern
Indiana,
The farmers of Laporte county have
had an excellent fall for getting their
work done ready for winter, says the
Michigan City Dispatch. The weath
er could hardly have been more con
tinuously beautiful. A little more
rain would perhaps have been a little
better for the growing wheat, but the
reports all say it is looking well and
there is no complaint of fly, which has
not been. the case before for several
years. . Husking corn is generally
completed, but there are always a few
who are negligent and anticipate the
demands of the mice and rats for win
ter food. The corn cop is rather
light in quantity, but the quality is
good and the yield is much better
than it was thought possible during
the prolonged drouth of last summer.
Marsh corn is excellent, and now that
the Kankakee marshes are being cul
tivated so generally this makes an Im
portant addition to the crop of the
county. Even potatoes have turned
out greatly better than expected, and
probably enough rjtve been grown in
the county to nearly if not quite sup
ply the home demand. All consider
ed it has not been a bad year for the
farmers despite the unfavorable pre
dictions of last summer.
Marshall County Poultry Show.
The fire t annual exhibition of the
Marshall county Poultry Association
will be held in P .mouth, Dec. 24 to
28, 1901, in the corner room of the
Hoham Block on the corner of Laporte
and Center streets.
The object of this exhibition is to
create an interest for better poultry
and more of it in this county. Every
farmer today in Marshall county
realizes how much more profitable it
is to him to raise thorough bred cat
tle, hogs, sheep and horses, and would
not for a moment entertain the idea
of having none but the best. Com
pare the different kinds of live stock
today with that of twiity-flve or
more years ago. It requires no more
food and care to take care of the best
than it does the poorest. It is the
same in poultry as in other classes of
stock. It requires no more feed or ex
pense to feed and care for a nice flock
of pure-bred poultry than of the dung
hill fowl of hal a century ago. But
from the financial standpoint the
story is entirely different, and from
one hundred to two hundred per cent
in favor of the pure bred fowl. We
earnestly solicit the help of all ad
mirers and breeders of pure-bred poul
try to lend us their assistance iri this
our first exhibition. If you have any
poultry of any variety we will be glad
to have you exhibit with us. We have
employed Mr. D. A. Stoner of Rens-
salaer, Ind., to judge the show. He
has the reputation of being one of the
best poultry judges in this country,
so whatever you have brings it along.
The premium list is now ready and will
be mailed to anyone upon application.
In it you will find all the rules and
regulations of the show, the cash and
special premiums offered.
Again in behalf of the Marshall
County Poultry Association, we ear
nestly solicit your help and patron
age. All communication .should be
addressed to F. B. Caret, Secretary.
AVe are sincerely yours,
Marshall Co. Poultry Ass'n.
The Revival Meetings.
A marked Increase in enthusiasm
and earnestness is characterizing the
Union Gospel meetings. It is indeed
a rare treat to have the privilege of
listening to such a masterful discourse
as given Tuesday evening by Rev. Ot
trom. Iiis powerful arguments, his
logical' reasoning, his vivid illustra
tions, anJ his eloquence appealed both
t the heart and intellect of the au
dience. Reading from his text, "And thou
shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall
save his people from their sins," the
evangelist began his sermon with the
statement, a Christian bible always
represents man as a great creature
except ' when compared with God.
Man is too great to be annihilated, his
capacity for good - is unbounded,: his
capacity'"' for evil- l$ terrific. JBut
though man is a great sinner,' Jesus a
great Savior, offers through himself, a
greatJsalvation. ' . ... . ' -
The afternoon talk was upon Prayer,
a most helpful mealing. - The speaker
brought out so emphatically the
beautiful thought that prayer Is .not
the fulfilling of an obligation to God,
but a privilege, it should . not be con
sidered as compulsory, but as a delight.
The highest honor that can be paid a
man is to be granted the privilege of
making an intercessory prayer, '"he
spirit in which such a prayer should
be asked, should be the spirit of :acri
fice, the spirit that prompted Christ
to give his life for us. There are
three impediments to proficient pray
er, absence of the consciousness of
God, regarding the iniquity in "our
hearts and small expectancy. Re
cognize the authority of God, have the
evil removed from your life, expect
great things of God and your "prayers
shall be ans we'red.
RAH!. RAH! P. H. S.
Plymouth's First Football Game a Victor
Over Warsaw.
The Plymouth high school football
team went over to Warsaw Friday and
walloped the Warsaw high school team
soundly. It was the first game for
both teams and each was confident of
victory. The score was 16 to 0.
The Plymouth line-up was as fol
lows: Clifford Burket, captain, left half,
. Willard Fields, right half,
Ford Reynolds, fullback,
Lloyd Morris, center,
Ray Logan, . quarter back,
John Carbin, right guard,
Wack Harris, right tackle,
Arthur Pomeroy, right end,
George Mead, left guard,
Frank Leonard, . left tackle, .
Ralph Leonard, left end. "
Score: first half, 5 to 0; second half
lltoO; total 16 too.
The team was accompained on the
trip by Lott Losey, manager; W. E.
Jordan, coach, who acted as referee,
and Frank Southworth and Laurence
Carvey, rooters.
The game was swift from the first
kick-off and was marked by several
brilliant plays on both sides. Plym
outh's scores were won by superior
weight and good work, the latter be
ing the result of Jordan's effective
training in practice, the team work
and strategy being especially fine.
There was no jangling during the
game and at no time was the referee's
life in danger. The Warsaw bovs
were perfect gentlemen and took their
defeat gracefully and with great good
nature. N
The Plymouth players cannot say
enough of the splendid treatment they
received at the hands of their Warsaw
brethren And are already planning and
arranging for the return game to be
played in the near future. When the
visitors arrived at Warsaw they were
taken in hand and entertained royally
at the athletic rooms and the White
House until their departure in the
evening. A large crowd witnessed
the game and was judicially impartial
in its very liberal applause.
Union Gospel Meetings.
On Monday afternoon. Rev. Ostrom
spoke to an intensely interested audi
ence, upon prayer, basing his remarks
upon the first thirteen verses of the
eleventh chapter of St. Luke's gospel.
He said that no substitute has ever
been found for prayer, and that it is
essential to a Christian life. He de
scribed various kinas of prayers and
said the prayer was often a religious
gambling. .
The evening addresses was an am
plification of Matthew 16-24, Mr.
Ostrom showed that the Christian
must have self sacrifice, one being that
of Mary Reid, who is devoting her
life to the lepers in the Himalaya
mountains.
Tuesday evening Rev. Ostrom will
deliver an address upon the subject,
"Liberal Religions."
Meeting will be held each afternoon
of this week at 3 o'clock, except Sat
urday, at the Presbyterian church and
every evening at 7:30 at the Methodist
church.
The solo work of Mr. Hillis as well
as his direction of the choir music
adds greatly to the success of the ser
vices. '

SHORT COURSE IN 1
AGRICULTURE.
Dear Tribune:
The Editor of the Tribune has been
kind enough to suggest that the writ
er might wish to keep in touch with
his home county, by writing some
words concerning the Short Course in
Agriculture. '
Most of the readers of the Tribune
may be aware that there are three
courses in agriculture at our State
School of Technology; one, of four
years duration, leading to the degree
Btfbhelor of Science in Agriculture,
of?A of two yearsj and one of eleven
vftfks. These courses of training,
differ, not only In duration, but they
differ in purpose, and in efficiency.
The popular conception of a four years'
course in agriculture is somewhat dis
torted, at least it used to be, even un
derthe enlightenment of Marshall coun
ty civilization. It still remains a "last,
long lingering" hope of the writer,
that he may grow to be man enough
to return to old Marshall County and
spell out the true meaning of a four
years' course in agriculture. lie is
not man enough to do it yet;
But the Editor asked for informa
tion, not about the long course, but
about the benefits of the winter term.
The only objection to be raised against
the short course is that it is not long.
It is impossible to arrange it so that
it may give a full rounded education.
The writer believes that: occasionally,
in this regard, too much is expected
of eleven weeks of-training. But the
fact remains, that eleven weeks of
time propejly spent, may serve as an
eye opener, as to the possibilities of
farm life.
The Winter School of Agriculture,
is arranged for men and women, who
would be benefitted by some college
training, but who cannot spend a
term or years In preparation. The
schedule of studies is almost entirely
"practical," and aims at teaching the
most improved methods of husbandry.
It is a rare opportunity for practical
farmers to make their business more
pleasing and profitable in this lies
its mission, and its efficiency is seldom
disputed.
Tillers of the soil, learn to till the
soil better than they had known. They
learn something about the compo
sition and properties of the rock
beneath their feet, and the
wave by which it feeds plants, and
how it is helped by proper kinds of
fertilizers. They learn what kind of
fertilizers to use and when to use
them.
Raisers of live stock, find out new
things about animal form, and how to
intensify the most profitable points.
They study how and what to feed, so
that for instance when they hear the
word bean, it suggests proteid and
milk fail, and corn suggests carbohyd
rate and lard. As thorough a train
ing as possible is also given in veter
inary science.
The shop work in both wood and
iron is calculated to make the farmer
more adept in the use of tools, so that
he may do work for himself, or super
intend the work of others with great
er intelligence.
The instruction in dairying gives a
satisfactory working knowledge of the
industry. Ample opportunity is given
to students, for actual dairy practice
in the handling ot milk from the pail
to the butter print. A considerable
study is made of testing milk, and of
the changes it undergoes in souring or
developing bad tastes or off colors or
what not.
A special lecturer is provided in
rural law, whogives attention to high
ways, ditches, stock laws and tres
passing. Opportunity is given the
students to ask questions upon any
matter relative to the subject.
The short course has secured the
services of Miss Laura G. Day, as in
structor in domestic science. Miss
Day can tell the girls of Indiana,
some things that have not been dream
ed in their philosophy. A similar op
portunity is not given elsewhere in
our state, and it is one which girls of
city and country cannot afford to dis
regard. . . .....
A little time is devoted to Art, and
the lectures In botany, by Prof., Stan
ley Coulter, and the English work,
under. Prof. Emma Mont McRea are
broadening influences indeed.. -
The. writer believes . that the most
valuable . part of the course are the
special lectures, by farmers of recogni
zed standing. These men know busi
ness methods of farming better than
ahyofie else, because they keep in
touch with them on their farms.
It is impossible to enumerate more
opportunties presented by the writer's
course In agriculture, of which those
above are only examples. - This field
of instruction Is a growing one, and
one whici) is destined to effect some
ridical educational change. Purdue
University with its enlarged agricul
tural equipment proposes to be equal
to the emergency. The winter term
begins Jan. 7.
The undersigned will gladly answer
any specific questions, so far as he is
able, and calatogucs may be had by
addressing Purdue University, La
fayette Indiana. -
Kindest wishes to Marshall Co.

BEVERIDGE OUTRIDES ROOSEVELT
Anticipated Ruffling of Senatorial Dig
bity Fails to Materialize.
While Senator Bevcridgeof Indiana
was making his duty call on the presi
dent a few days ago he happened to
mention that while In the Philippines
he had ridden over a good part of the
island of Luzon on horseback.
"Good horses over there?." asked
Mr. Roosevelt.
The Indiana statesman shook his
head. He added that he was simply
famishing for a good gallop at that
verv moment.
"Just the man I am looking for,"
declared the president in his impetu
ous way. "I want some one to ride
with me today. We'll go just as soon
as I get rid of thee pecple."
Senator Beveridge prides himself
on being a pretty fair athlete for a
man of his size and he accepted the
proposition. At 4 o'clock he was

waiting for the president to make his
appearance. The senator was mounted
on a splendid saddle horse. He had
on the same clothes and high silk hat
that he had worn in the president's
office. Mr. Roosevelt had taken off
his statesman's togs and was attired
in a business suit with the soft felt hat
which he wears when riding.
"There'll be some badly jostled up
senatorial dignity when they come
back," remarked the detective who
follows President Roosevelt on his
outings as the president and the sen
ator started off.
The ride was over the river into
Virginia. An hour and a half was
spent in the saddle and when the two
horsemen returned to Washington
their mounts were covered w ith sweat.
President Roosevelt's hat was pulled
down well ovr his ears, but Senator
Beveridge 's silk tile w as as smooth and
sat as jauntily on his head as when
the start was made. The president
had let out a little on the country
roads, but he did not even ruffle
the senatorial dignity.
