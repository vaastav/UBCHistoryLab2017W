WASHINGTON LETTER.
From our regular correspondent.
"Washington, Dec. 5, 1898.
President McKinley's annual mes
sage to Congress is a thoroughly pa
triotic document from start to finish.
There is not a word of partisanship
In it. The message will not only be
read witli interest, but it will becare
fully preserved, as it is an authentic,
condensed history of events leading
to the war with Spain, of the war,
and of the results of the war, so far as
they are known at this time. It is,
in itself, alone, sufficient to place
President McKinley in the very front
ranks of American statesmen, if he
had not already attained that posi
tion. It is necessarily long, but con
tains no platitudes, no striving after
effect nor bids for popular favor. It
is a plain statement of some of the
most important events in the coun
try's history, -made by a man whose
patriotism has been proven by trials
such as few men have gone tli rough.
It ought to be read in every school
house in the land aud studied as a les
- son in current American history.
Even the most partisan Democrats
find nothing in it to object to, which
is something decidedly unusual in
Presidents' messages.
t t t
The attendance at the opening of
congress was quite up to the average,
both on the floor of tue uuuse aud
senate and in tne galleries. Speaker
Reed opened the house, tiis smiling
face indicating a contentment ttiat
must have been envied by those Dem
ocrats who have for months past been
engaged in overthrowing him, on pa
per. Vice President llobart presided
over the opening of the senate in his
usual urbane and dignified manner.
Among the noted senatorial absentees
were Senators Davis of Minnesota,
Frye of Maine, and Gray of Deleware,
who are detained iu Paris bv their
work as American Peace Commission
ers, but who expect to complete the
treaty of peace and start for home in
a few days, the difficult part having
been accomplished when the Spanish
commissioners agreed to our terms, a
week ago.
t t t
No man is better authority on
things congressional than Senator Al
lison, chairman of the committee on
appropriation. His opinions carry
weight because of his loug experience
and the correctness of his judgment
in the past.' He said of the session of
congress that opened to-day: "In my
opinion, the session will be an inter
est ohe, and many of the debates will
be of great importance." Of the pros
pect of legislation he said: "It can be
laid down as a safe rule that if any
measure proposed is antagonized by
a determined minority, it will be
withdrawn. There will be great pres
sure in behalf of legislation for the
Nicaragua canal, and if any import
ant measure is passed, outside of the
appropriation biHs, it will be the
Canal bill: That subject has been so
thoroughly threshed over that it
ought not to provoke much debate."
Of the Treaty of Peace with Spain he
said: "It will be ratified beyond a
doubt, and exactly as it comes to us
from the Peace Commission. We can
not afford to stultify ourselves in the
face of the world by refusing to ac
cept the work of the commissioners.
They have been very careful and de
serve the endorsement of the country.
I shall be in favor of prompt action,
because we ought to dispose of the
matter and not let it remain in a
state of uncertainty. We want to
settle as soon as possible our relations
to the Philippines, ana this we can
not do until the treaty is ratified.
All our farmer readers should take
advantage of the unprecedented club
bing offer we this year make, which
includes, with this paper, The Live
Stock Indicator, its Special Farmers'
Institute editions, The Poultry Far
mer, The Farmers' Mutual Insurance
Journal and the Humane Alliance.
The subscription price of of these five
publications amounts to S2.80, while
our own paper is $1.00, a total of $3.80.
We are prepared to send them all, in
cluding our own paper, to any farmer
in this county for $1.43, which is only
45 cents more than our own subscrip
tion price. Never before was so much
superior reading matter, of the most
practical and useful character, offered
for only $1.45. The first four of the
naners named are so well known
throughout the west that but little j
need to be said of them. They com- '
mend themselves to the reader's fa
vorable attention upon mere mention, j
The Humane Alliance is devoted to
humane education, and should be in
every farmer's family, so that the boys
and girls on the farm may early im
bibe the principles of a broad human
ity that shall include all God's creat
ures, and learn the wickedness and
brutalizing tendency of cruelty of all
kinds. Take advantage of this great
offer.
Two Pointed Questions Answered.
What is the use of making a better
article than your competitor if you
cannot get a better price for it?
Ans. As there is no difference in
the price the public will buy only the
better, so that while our profits may
be smaller on a single sale they will
be much larger in the aggregate.
How can you get the public to know
your make is the best?
If both articles are brought promi
nently before the public both are cer
tain to be tried and the public will
very quickly pass judgment on them
and use only the better one.
This explains the large sale on
Chamberlain's Cough Ilemedv. The
people have been using it for years
and have found that it can be depend
ed upon. They may occasionally take
up with some fashionable novelty put
fortli with exaggerated claims, but
are certain to return to the one reme
dy that they know to be reliable, and
for coughs, colds and croup there is
nothing equal to Chamberlain's Couah
lieniedy. For sale bv Jones & Gibson.
Chamberlain's Colic. Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy can always be de
pended upon and is pleasant and safe
to take, hold by Jones !c Uibson.
