Eecommnndations of the Pres
ident Discussed.
AS TO RAILWAY RATES
POWER OF POOLING THOUGHT TO
BE FAVORED.
Advocates of Admission of New State3
Pleased?Comments of Leading
Men of Both Houses.
Me n in the House and Senate who are
friendly to the railways commented this
ftfi.irr.oon upon that part of the President's
message which in their op'n'on seemed to
trrnd in the direction of favoring railway
pooling. The paragraph read as follows:
j he power vested in the government to
put a stop to agreements to the detriment
of the public should. In my judgment, be
accompanied by power to permit, under
specified conditions and careful supervision,
agreements clearly in the interest or the
public."
This was construed by friends of the rail
ways to mean that the President would not
oppose an amendment to the railway rate
Mil which authorized railway pooling, it Is
well known that a determined effort will be
made bj the railway men to secure the
adoption of an amendment to the rate bill
which will give to the railroads the priv
ilege desired. They-feel very much encour
by I his apparent sanction of the ex
ecutive and will red'tuhle their persistency
In seeking the amendment. With this
seeming executive Indorsement back of
them they hope to overcome the opposition
Which exists.
A pooling bill was pcisied by the House
? number of years ago, l ut at a time when
t:. *!? w is ,i strong jKjpulistic representation
in the Sei:;ite, iinj i.lll failed of enact
rn*nt.
It is that If this prlvftegp of pooling
should tie granted, the way would be made
very much smoother for the administration
rate bill, and the railroads would go a long
distance in the direction pointed out by the
President
Friends of Statehood Pleased.
The friends of statehood were greatly
pleased and encouraged with that part of
the President's message that refers to the
admission of new states. The President's
distinct recommendation that Indian Ter
ritory and Oklohama be admitted as one
state and New Mexico and Arizona be ad
mitted as another Is clearly in line with
the House bill and with the policy of Sena
tor Beveridge. With the influence of the
President's words It Is believed by friends
o' statehood that the hill will be passed
for the admission of these states in the
present session of Congress. They claim !
that they are confident of having a ma
jority for the passage of the statehood bill
In the fcenate.
Message Clear and Concise.
Senator Hemenway of Indiana said In
regard to the message: "The message Is
remarkable for its cleanness and concise
ness. The President deals with great
state questions Jn a way that the lavtnen
can understand.
"I agree with him on his railway rate
recommendations. We must act cautious
ly. make sure we are light and give both
sides a square deal. That is wiiat the
President wants."
Senator Hopkins si? Illinois: "It la a re- j
marknble state paper and able and char
acteristic of the man who wrote it.'"
Senator Hurkett of Nebraska: I think It
Is a wonderful document. The tone is con
servative throughout and certainly leaves
no ground for the socialist to secure a
foothold. I agree with his railway rate
recommendations thoroughly."
Senator Crazier of Tennessee: "Xt looks
to ir.e a- if there were .1 wid > difference in
the President's rate talk through the south J
Hr:d his language in his message. There j
appears a disposition on his part to be
more conciliatory."
Senator Ruyner of Maryland said: "1
have not hid time to carefully read the
message and have only skimmed over it.
It has t good many good suggestions, hut
I do not atree with the President on his
North American policy, which is the only
part of the message I have read carefully.
All my lifetime I have been absolutely op
posed to hit rfering with our South Ameri
can n-ifchbers. and 1 am obliged to take
issue w ith hlru on that subject.
Morgan's Caustic Comment.
Senator Morgan of Alabama: "The mes
sage Is :< mass of platitudes, latitudes and
the personal reflections of our strenuous
joung President. He gives us. as usual, a
??r.ore holy than thou' dissertation on such
subjects as be dee inn worthy of considera
tion. and expects us or imagines that we
will accept them as gospel."
Senator Beveridge said the message was
characteriz. d by a high and lofty tone such J
as should prove to be a tonic to the body '
politic.
8enatov Gallinger sat I it was an admirable
paper
Senator Burrows thought the message was
k splendid o. e hihJ statesmanlike in every
respei t.
"Courageous and Commendable."
I: - ntatfr* Payne of New York, re
publican lloor leader?"I think the Presl
dent presents an uncommon amount of food
for thought. Many of his recommendations
ere very courageous and most of them are
extremely commendable "
Representative John Sharp Williams of
Mississippi, th.- democratic floor leader: "I
iia>> read only through the parts of the
message concerning railroad rates and In
surant . and I agree almost in toto with
the President's expressions on the railroad
rate matter In regard to Insurance mat
ters. however, I do not see how the Presl- j
dent will make connections, as to my mind I
the decision of the Supreme Court of the
1'nited States tliat tnsuranfe is "not Inter
state traffic makes it impossible of federal
control."
Representative Townsend of Michigan, au
thor of the railroad-rate bill of the last
?ession: "The President's say on the rate
matter shows that he has been in earnest
all tiie lime in his campaign for railroad
rate reform."

GREAT CYCLE CONTEST
TWELVE TEAMS SURVIVED THE
FIBST 30 HOURS OF RACE.
NEW YORK, December 5.?Twelce teams
out of the sixteen that started had sur
vived the accidents and exhaustion of the
first thirty hours of the six-day bicycle race
at Madison 8quare Garden and still re
mained in the race when the sun rose to
day. While twelve of the men rested the
other twelve pedaled around the aaucer
shaped track with drawn cheeks, cracking
lips and eye-3 shielded by dark glasses.
Throughout the night there were occa
sional falls as some tired rider failed to
steer his machine accurately, but there'
were no serious Injuries. Today's crowd
of spectators began to arrive before the all
night watchers had left. In fact, many of
the spectators hive been In the garden con
tinuously since the race started at mid
night Sunday.
The twelve teams left lft the race were
tied for first position at i> o'clock, which
was the end of the thirty-third hour. They
were then a fraction more than eighty-five
miles behind the world's record for thirty
three hours In a six-day race. They were
continuaJly dropping behind the record in
stead of creeping up.
A Notable Withdrawal.
This was partly due to the withdrawal at
midnight last night of Charles Vanonl, the
Italian rider, who was the fighting spirit
of the racers and the leider of nearly all
spurts during the early hours of the race.
This rider was first a me>mber of the
Swiss-Italian team, and after his partner in
thai team had broken a rib, joined the
Mexican team, where an injury left a va
cancy. But at midnight Fred Castro of
Mexico, his new team-mate, became ex
hausted. and Vanoni was compelled to drop
out because he had no one to ride with.
After he left the track the others rode
slowly, resting themselves for several
hours. The other teams which have with
drawn from the race are the German-Amer
ican team, represented by Krebs of Newark
and Petersen of Chicago, and the . Afro
American team, represented by two New
York riders. Dove and Scott.

IN AID OF RUSSIAN JEWS.
The President to Be Asked to Use His
Good Offices.
A resolution offered today by Representa
tive Goldfogle of New York will, by ar
rangement, be read on the floor of tUt
House when the reading of the President's
message is concluded. It is rather unusual
for a resolution to be read on the floor
when first Introduced, and in this case tha
resolution Itself Is' unusual. It calls upon
the President to use his good offices lo
prevent the recurrence In Russia of past
outrages on the Jews. The resolution says
in part:
"The members of the House have learned
with profound sorrow and feeling akin to
horror of the persecution and massacre of
the Jews in Russia. The American people,
ever animated by the spirit of justice and
humanity, and strongly imbued with the
recognition of the brotherhood of man,
which Is the crowning glory of our civili
zation, stands aghast at the base intoler
ance of brutalized men who, without prov
ocation. have in this age of enlightenment,
committed unspeakable atrocities and
crimes against life and property and out
raged every human feeling and evoke our
condemnation and shame the civilization
of the world. The American people hive
been deeply s'tirred with pity for the unfor- j
tunate sufferers who have been plunged j
into a grief that beggars description, and
tender them their heartfelt sympathy.
"Resolved. That the President of the
United States Is respectfully requested to
use such good and friendly offices with the
Russian government as the traditions and
unbroken friendship between the two na
tions may justify and may secure such
action from the Russian government as
may tend to prevent the recurrence of such
outrages in the future."
Speaker Cannon gave his assent upon re
quest to the reading of the resolution on the
floor.

Chicago Today.
CHICAGO, December 5.?Delegates from
all parts of the United States were present
when the fourth triennial convention of the
Council of Jewish Women met today in Si
nai Temple.
The opening hours of the convention were
given over to meetings of committee to
receive credentials, registration and an in
formal reception to the delegates by a local
committee. The formal opening of the con
vention will not take place until tonight.
Mrs. J. Hillman and Miss Hettle Abram

Seattle Exposition Postponed.
SBATTL.E. Wash., December 8.?The
Alaska-Yukon exposition, which Is slated to
take place in this city during the summer
of 190?, will probably be postponed until
1908. This conclusion was reached today
after a lengthy conference of the commltte
on permanent organization. This commit
tee believes that a creditable showing can
not be made in so short a time, especially
as the field Is such a large one and the re
sources of the country so scattered.
Massachusetts Municipal Elections.
BOSTON, December .1?Municipal elec
tions were held today in fourteen Massa
chusetts cities, not Including Boston., Of
these cities, all except Fall River, chose a
mayor, the term of office In that city being
two years. In nearly all of the municipali
ties there were close contests for mayor
and for control of the city government.
The question of licensing the sale of liquor
was the most prominent feature of the
election at several points.
College Rumpus at Tokio.
TOKIO. December 3. 3 p.m.?The friction

FIRE AT MANASSAS
DISASTROUS CONFLAGRATION'
VISITS TOWN THIS MORNING.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
MANASSAS, Va., December 5.?The
greatest tire in the history of Manassas
visited this town in the early hours oof the
morning; completely wiping out the business
section at a loss variously estimated at
from J100.000 to J150.C00. The tire started
about 1 o'clock this morning and raged
fiercely for three hours, during which time
It was stubbornly fought by the citizens,
whose principal apparatus was a small
hand pump engine employing a dozer, men
In its operation and capable of throwing a
good sized stream. Fanned by a strong
northwest wind; the blaze quickly envelop
ed the buildings, most of which were light
frame structures, and spread from house
to house until the entire block bounded by
Main, Center, West and Railroad streets
was a seething mass.
By 4 o'clock this square and a half of the
square opposite, on the west, were com
pletely swept of buildings, excepting the
brick freight house of the Southern raliroad,
on the corner of Main and Railroad streets.
Only by the most strenuous efforts were
the citizens able to prevent the flames from
spreading to the residence section or the
town. Men, women and even children turn
ed out and fought the fire by every avail
able means. In this work the colored peo
ple of the town did yeoman service. When
the Are was at Its height a message was
sent to Alexandria appealing for an engine
and firemen. Chief Petty of the Alexandria
lire department, in response, ordered tiie
Reliance engine, ten men and 2,500 feet of
hose to the railroad station, where the res
cue party, headed by the chief. wa? ready
to start, when word was sent that the
flames were under control.
Though several private residences In
which families lived were destroyed, there
was neither loss of life nor serious injury
to any person. A considerable portion of
household furniture, together with a mass
of merchandise, was saved. The origin or
the fire is In doubt. It started in the sec
ond story of the Blossom building, at the
corner of Main and Center streets. From
there the march of the flames was eastward
until the square and a half had been con
sumed.
TO ERECT BUILDING HERE.
Efforts to Secure Location of Memorial
to C. E. Founder.
About three hundred prominent Christian
Endeavorers attended the meeting of the
executive committee of the Christian En
deavor Union of the District, held on the
assembly room of the new Y. M. C. A. build
ing, last evenning. At the close of the ses
sion those present wfJt'e escorted through
the new Y. M. C. A. btiilding. Through the
courtesy of the Y. M.j C. A. the regular
monthly meetings of this committee, com
posed of the presidents of all the local C.
E. societies and others prominent In the
work, will be held in tli.e Y. M. C. A. build
ing.
The election of Commissioner H. B. F.
Macfarland as chairman of the interna
tional committee for the erection of a me
morial to Francis E. Clark, the founder of
the Christian Endeavor, was announced last
evening by Carlton R, Ball, chairman of
the local committee. A movement has been
started for building a tribute to the great
founder of this society, and it Is planned to
ask every one of the 4,000,000 members In
the 75,000 societies In seventy different coun
tries In the world to -contribute 23 cents
each.
This will be used, It Is advocated, for the
erection of a headquarters building, the
revenue from which will yield funds for the
missionary work of the society. The elec
tion of Mr. Macfarland to the chairmanship
of that committee Is takei. as a good omen
for the location of the headquarters build
ing in the city of Washington, for which
the local members worked so hard at the
convention in Baltimore last summer.
The meeting last evening was called to
order by Hermon C. Metcalf, the president
of the union. The devotional services were
led by W. H. H. Smith, who Is a past presi
dent of the union. After that, Lyman L.
Pierce, general secretary of the Y. M. C.
A., extended the greetings of th association
to the union and Invited them to uso the
building, and he was thanked by the presi
dent. Tlvi union passed a vote of thanks
to the association for the invitation and
accented It.
The reports of departments was the
next in the order of business. F. C.
Schroeder made a report upon the In
terdenominational missionary Institute
which was held in the Metropolitan M.
E. Church in this city some weeks ago
and in which the Christian Endeavor
took an active part.
On February 2, 190<$, It was stated, the
Christian Endeavor will be twenty-five'
years old, and It la planned to have a cel
ebration of that anniversary in the Dis
trict.
A District convention or rally will be held
here in one of the churches, and a feature
of that convention will be a festival of
praise, under the leadership at Percy ?os
ter. In Convention Hall. This will be pat
terned after the festival given in Baltimore
aand Is expected to include from 500 to
1,000 voices. It was announced last even
ing that the rehearsals ifor that entertain
ment will begin this week.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAC
URGES FLOATING DRY DOCK.
Admiral Endicott Would Locate It in
the Chesapeake.
In his annual report Rear Admiral Endl
cott. chief of the bureau of yards and
docks, recommends the construction of a
second floating dry dock similar to the dry
dock Dewey built for the Philippines, and
suggests the desirability of locating 't at
Solomon's Island. In the Chesapeake bay.
Referring to Solomon's Island, the ad
miral says: "This point lies on the west
side of the Chesapeake, about twenty miles
north of the mouth of the Potomac river,
and about eighty miles from Cape Charles.
The depth of the water to the Capes of the
Chesapeake is ample for all naval vessels.
A steel floating dry dock destined for the
Philippines Is now lying In this location,
where It underwent its practical tests In
docking the battleship Iowa and the armor
ed cruiser Colorado. A caroful examina
tion of the situation shows it to be ad
mirable for the mooring and operation of
a floating dry dock of large size, laying
upon the waters of the Chesapeake. It
would afford a very valuable auxiliary to
the naval establishment there, and would
be a relief to the docking accommodations
of the Norfolk navy yard, which are not
ample In an emergency, not accessible for
the deepest draft"vessels at all times, and
entirely Inaccessible to large vessels In
jured and drawing more than normal,
which could bo docked at Solomon's Island.
The dry dock now there is capable of tak
ing up an injured vessel drawing thirty
seven feot of water, but nothing approach
ing this draft could get into the Norfolk
navy yard at any stage of the tide. In case
of hostile operations upon the Atlantic
coast the Chesapeake is more than likely
to be the scene of great activity, and a
large floating dry dock in the vicinity,
capable of beine reached In a short time,
by a vessel In the service. Injured or unin
jured. would be of inestimable advantage.
The bureau accordingly submits the
recommendation for an appropriation of
$100,000 to begin the construction of a dock
which would cost, complete, $1,230,000.
KITSON JOINS NATIONALS.
Popular Pitcher Traded for "Delaware!
Jack" Townsend.
DETROIT, Mich., December 3?Manager
Armour of the Detroit American League
base baH club today closed a deal with the
Washington club for the exchange of
Pitcher Frank Kitson for Pitcher Jack
Townsend. It was an even exeliang- *
neither club getting a honus.
The negotiations looking to the above
trade have been going on ever since the
meeting of the American League In Chicago
between Manager Armour and President
Noyes, but the news that the deal had been
consummated comes first from Detroit.
Some days ago President Noyes wrote to
Manager Armour that he would trad > Town
send for Kitson. but no reply came from the
latter, and the above item evidently makes
It clear that the Detroit manager has agreed
to the proposition.
Jack Townsend has been discontented
for the past two seasons with his berth
In this city, as he believed the town was
a sort of "hoodoo" to him, and he has
frequently asked the local officers to
trade him to another club. . Ills work at
times has been so exceptionally good that
Just as the Nationals would frame up a
deal it was thought best to call It off.
Then Townsend would hit another of his
slumps, and this condition continued all
last season.
At the meeting of the American League
President Noyes, desiring to learn exactly
how the other officials stood as to Town
send's ability, asked for waivers on his re
lease. Immediately New York, Philadel
phia, Cleveland and Detroit put In claims,
and thus It was discovered that the Dela
ware boy was a good tcading proposition.
OfTers of exchange of players came from all
four clubs mentioned, but Frank Kitson
looked the beet, and the trade with Detroit
followed. Jack Townsend has made many
friends since playing In Washington, and
a great number will lament his departure,
but there Is no question but that he was
of little value to the Nationals, and his ex
change can be considered a good business
proposition.
Frank Kitson was one of the jstars of
base hall while with the Brooklynsland was
quickly gobbled up by the Detroifs during
the war between the American and Na
tional leagues. His contract called for |4
000 while with the Tigers and notwith
standing a weak supporting team his work
was good. Last season Ms salary was given
a tremendous cut, which took all the heart
out af Kitson and his work fell off to such
an extent that he decided to quit the game
for good unless a more congenial berth
could be secured. Kitson Is still In his
prime and as he will be satisfied wKh his
Washington salary, the chances are big
that the change will work wonders In his
pitching arm.
He Is one of the most gentlemanly play
ers In the professional ranks, his habits
being above reproach, and In addition he Is
a ball player from every angle, being able
to field his position In first-class style and
at the bat Is something ot a hitter.
The Washington club is to be congratu
lated on the trade, as It will undoubtedly
be benefited, and the Detxolts have made
a wise move, as they get a possible star
and also a gentleman as an addition to their
already strong corps of twlrler*.
Site for & Residence Sold.
J. V. N. & T. B. Huyck, real estate bro
kers, have sold. In connection with Early
& Lampton, the only remaining unimproved
plot of ground on the north side of Mint
wood place, Washington Heights. This plot,
which Is about flfty-one feet front by Irreg
ular depth, contains something over seven
thousand square feet and la especially salt
able for a fine residence. It is understood
to be the intention of the purchaser, Mr.
T. C. 8. Hunter, to build In the near future.
Divorce Granted.
A decree has been signed by Juntice An

SCHOOLS ARE AROUSED
MANY COMMENTS MADE ON THE
FOSTER BILL.
- Consternation at the sweeping changes
proposed in the Foster bill, Introduced into
the House yesterday, for the reorganization
of the District system of education, la evi
dent today In many school centers.
Teachers and many of the officials are dis
cussing the various features of the measure
with approbation or disgust, as their par
ticular Interests are subserved. It is called
"sensational literature, which can never
pass" on the one hand and, on the other
hand, "an extremely wise and adequate
measure."
Commissioner Macfarland declined to
comment in any way upon the bill, stating
that the Commissioners never expressed an
opinion on any bill introduced in Congress
unless they were requested to do so by
Congress or one of its committees. It was
pointed out at the District building that the
proposition made from time to time to have
the President appoint the board of educa
tion was contrary to the present theory of
municipal government, based upon long ex
perience, so as to prevent a division of .re
sponsibility by the multiplication of au
thorities. An additional reason for this
course is the uniform ruling of the United
States Supreme Court that the District of
Columbia Is a municipal corporation of
which the Commissioners are the executive
agents, and that it is not a part of the na
tional government.
When asked this morning what he had to
wirthV new,bI1J' President J. Holds
worth Gordon of the board of education
SHJU I
tZl hMi? fbfolutely nothing to say about
the bilL lie has always been in favor of
bettej pay for the teachers, he said. The
board of education had realized that it is
impossible to hold trained and tried teach

The oster bill leaves nothing to be de
sired in this particular.

the Franklin building this morning, Super
wiVh fil' v-UH',V who WJS in c?nsulia;ion
wlth, Pr? Needham, president of ijeo^v
Washington University, and a member of
the school board, also declined to speak
Both gentlemen said: "We are not pre
pared to make any statements at the pres
ent time, as we are not sufficiently ac
quainted with the details of the bill."
It was inferred that the superintendent
is not pleased with the general features of
the reorganization.
Questioned as to his opinion, Secretary
Connor made many inquiries as to the bear
ing of details of the bill. The clause con
cerning the superintendent of buildings and
supplies causing the most marked curios
ity.
Various officers, although as they main
tain the full bearing* of the new measure
may not be understood, claim that they
are being legislated out of existence.
No provision seems to be made for the
present unique system of supervising prin
cipals. Unless the so-called group-princi
pals are substantially the same, the present
offices and corps are relegated to the attic
as absolute. No provision, it is also clalm

ATTORNEYS EXONERATED.
Indictment Against Them Ordered to
Be Dismissed.
The Department of Justice announces
the exoneration of Mansfield, McMurray
& Cornish from serious charges pre
ferred against them by an Indian Terri
tory grand jury.
Last summer the members of the law
firm of Mansfield, McMurray & Cornish
Qov. Johnston and ex-Gov. Mosely of the
Chickasaw tribe of Indians, were indicted
for conspiracy to embezzle funds of tho
tribe.
No accusation or prior investigation led
up to this indictment, but matters sub
mitted to the grand Jury concerning pay
ments of large sums to the attorneys and
a warrant Issued to Gov. Johnston seemed
to Indicate the supposed conspiracy.
The whole matter could have been ex
plained by presenting the books and ac
counts and checks of the firm, but was not
explained In any way to the grand Jury
As these attorneys had been and are now
employed by the Department of Justice
and have done notable services as attor
neys for the Chlckasaws, their request to
tho President to have the matter exam
ined Into by the department was deemed
reasonable, especially as It was a mere
matter of accounting.
A first examination was made by Assist
ant Attorney General Russell, who was
fully convinced of the innocence of all the
accused. It was then examined Into by the
Attorney General at the request of the
President, and he also was fully convinced
The Attorney General then'caused It to
be looked Into by the district attorney, Mr.
W. B. Johnson, who reported to the Attor
ney General that the evidence submitted
by the ' reused was absolutely conclusive
Accordingly the Indictment has been or
dered to be dismissed.
The Indictment grew out of the fact that
the law firm received a fee of about ?7G0,
000 for services to the Indians. Secretary
Hitchcock declared this fee exorbitant and
an outrage. His view does not seem to
have been accepted by the Department of
Justice.

PRINTERS COMMENT
ON STATEMENT OF TYPOTHETAE
MADE YESTERDAY.
The statement of the employing printers'
side of the eight-hour movement, as print
ed exclusively In The Star yesterday, caused
widespread comment in trades union cir
cles i.i this city. As the eight-hour contest
is to be launched by the typographical
unions in all sections of the country on
January 1. and as the publication yester
day was the flrst clearly defined statement
of the position of the local branch of the
National Typothetae. It was given serious
consideration by the printers of Washing
ton.
The eight-hour committee of Columbia
Typographical Union, No. 101, held a regu
lar meeting last night, during the course
of which the attitude of the Typothetae
was discussed, .as well as the other phases
of the eight-hour situation.
The committee does not anticipate any
unfavorable action by President Roosevelt.
It was stated, against those members of
the union who are employed at the govern
ment printing office.
"The government printers," said a leading
typo today, "In affiliating with the Typo
graphical I'nion are only exercising their
God-given right to protect themselves and
their families from encroachments and In
justice of any sort. X feel, therefore, that
President Roosevelt will embrace them In
his "square deal' and will not take action
against them that may be desired by some
persons."
Secretary George G. Seibold of Colum
bia Union said this afternoon that encour
aging reports continue to be received from
all sections of the country on the progress
of ttie eight-hour movement.
Foreman Berg or the Congressional Rec
ord. who Is president of Columbia Union,
says the recently developed attitude of the
Typothetae will not necessitate the calling
of an extra session of the union. The next
regular meeting will be on December 17.
The printers are gratltled by the recent
statement of President Samuel Gompers.
that the American Federation of Labor will
stand with them In the eight-hour move
ment with all the force at Its command, as
exclusively glvea in The Star several days
ago.
CASE OF SMALLPOX DEVELOPS.
Member of Steamer Crew 111 of the
Disease.
One man 111 of smallpox and removed to
the smallpox hospital and fourteen others
quarantined on the boat Is the record of the
last voyage of the steamer Northumberland,
one of the Baltimore boats which arrived
from that city last evening.
It is stated that one of the members of
the crew of the Northumberland, a colored
man, named Thomas II. Jordan, became 111
a day or two before the boat sailed from
Baltimore for Washington.
He was worse when the steamer tied up
at her berth In the Potomac last evening
and the captain gave to Jordan a certifi
cate to go to a local hospital for treatment.
With the paper In his hand the negro wan
dered into the Marine Hospital. The flrst
physician to examine the man discovered
the nature of his aliment and Jordan was
marooned at the spot where he sat while
a hurry-up telephone message was sent to
the city health department.
The experts of that department confirmed
the hospital physician's diagnosis and Jor
dan was removed to the smallpox hospital
on the shores of the Eastern branch. At
present he is In the early stages of the dis
ease, and from his symptoms the physicians
believe the attack will be a light one.
The certificate carried by the negro
showed that he came from the steamer
Northumberland, and with It as a guide
the health authorities immediately vis
ited the vessel and fumigated every por
tion of the fo'castle and of the hold
where Jordan was known recently to
have been. Fourteen members of the
crew were corralled in quarters, and be
side being vaccinated were quarantined
on the ship.
The Northumberland is due to sail this
afternoon, and the health authorities
state that they see no reason to hold
her. The Maryland authorities will bo
Informed of the circumstances, so that
they can take any necessary precautions
ujjpn the arrival of the steamer at her
home port.
Two deck hands escaped from the
steamer before the quarantine guard was
stationed, and they have not yet been
located.
WAR ON EDISON COMPANY.
Formidable Labor Movement in Chi
cago May Stop Building.
CHICAGO, December 5.?War b- un yes
terday upon the Chicago Edison Company
by the Electricians' Union may develop
into the most extensive disturbance among
the building trades since the great lockout
of 1900. Several small strikes already have
been called, and more will be ordered to
day.
Business agents of the Electricians' Union
visited big downtown buildings in the after
noon and wherever a non-union man was
found employed the union workmen were
ordered to stop work. The same plan will
be followed today. It is the intention of
the leaders to tie up every contract of the
Edison company in which non-union men
are employed.
In the downtown district an unusual
number of buildings, it is said, are in the
hands of the electricians who are making
repairs. All of these jobs, provided they
are being done under the supi-rvlslon of the
Edison company, will suffer from the
strikes. In outlying parts of the city,
aparment buildings, stores and residences
likewise will be drawn Into the electricians'
strike.
Nothing Is said to be behind the strike
except the decision of the officials of the
union to Insist upon the employment of
members of the organization.
The greatest danger of the s-trike spread
ing lies In the attitude of the other unions
in the associated building trades. It prac
tically Is certain that the close alliance
among the various trades will im
pel every union workman employed on a
building to show his sympathy for the elec
tricians on strike. In such a case building
opt'rations would be brought to a stand
still. The .board of business agents of the
associated building trades wlli take up the
strike question today.
FIFTEEN MEN WEBE BURNED.
Three May Die From Injuries in Chi
cago Explosion.
CHICAGO, December 5.?Fifteen men
were burned last night by an explosion In
the International Harvester Company's
plant at 108th street and Muskegon avenue,
three of whom probably will die.
The explosion was caused by a workman
thrusting a cold bar of steel into a furnace
of molten metal. In the Immediate vicin
ity of the furnace at the time sixty men
were working. The more seriously injured
were in the furnace pit.
Following the explosion chaos reigned In
the furnace room for several minutes. Molt
en metal was hurled about the room and
the smoke and fire that shot from the fur
nace filled the room so that the workmen
were unable for several minutes to find the
exits. With the groans of their wounded
fellows in their ears, they groped about
helplessly, stumbled over those who had
been prostrated by the .blast. From the
furnace chimney the flames shot high Into
the air and could be seen for miles.
The plant was not damaged to any great
extent.

Methods Pursued by Presi
dent and Advisors.
HOW WORK IS DONE
M|t. ROOSEVELT TALKS OF PRE
MATURE PUBLICATIONS.
Members Seldom Vot? to Decide Any
Question That ia Under
Discussion.
President Roosevelt's recent persona! let
ter to cabinet officer* directing tljat no In
formation be given newspaper cocrwipond- a
ents as to cabinet meetings has tended to
croato an Impression that cabinet sessions
decide grave and important questions and
that the delltiera'lona are on the order of
legislative toodies. and that votes are taken.
The fact that cabinet meetings are pro
ductive of little of Iir'virtance and that no
votes are taken or even sought by the 1'res
ident was one of the reasons that led to a
mild uprising on the part of the Washing
ton <-orrespondents of out-of-town papers
as well as the representatives of local pa
pers The correspondents unanimously de
clared that they did no! seek to embarrass
the President and ti c administration by de
siring to publish important undetermined
matters discussed by the cabinet, but the J*
did feel that they were entitled, for the
pui-llc benefit, to such matters as had been
passed upon that did not affect the policy
of the administration or would not hurt
any one by being printed.
The President, in tulking to some of the
correspondents later a>>oul the or.ter. stated
thai It was not intended to prevent heads
of departments making public matters con
nected with th-ir respective departments,
but that it was intended to prevent the dis
cussion with news-paper nun of various
questions taken up at the cabinet meetings.
The President pointed out what is true
that cabinet sessions are held to reach ten
tative understandings and to have free dis
cussion. but that the decision of every im
portant question rests with him alone. He
could not afford to have reports going .to
the public that the cabinet had decided
upon a certain line of policy when he ?u
likely to reach some other conclusion after
ward on his own responsibility.
Premature Publication*.
The President dwelt ?with emphasis upon
the proposition that the premature publica
tion of cabinet discussions might often re
sult In harm to administration measures.
The truth of this Is recognized by news
paper men, but their contention has l>eea
that there are many minor matters, ap
pointments, conclusions that have passed
the tentative stage, expressions of opinion
on more or less Interesting matters th?
giving out of which by cabinet officers to
whose departments they belong would do
no injury. They hHve maintained that the
President could trust the discretion of his
cabinet officers in tJiese things
As the President states, a eaWr.et session
reaches no decisions. With the President
sitting at the head of the great taM<\ the
discussion on any given subject is tentative,
merely an expression of opinion Intended to
show the President how his advisers feel.
More often <-atoinet meetings are not that
Important. They are simply held to permit
the heads of departments to tak-s up with
the President questions before them upon
which they do not care to pass themselves.
It is a matter of putting something up to
the President. The State Department lias
the first ca.! in cabinet business. Secretary
Root, thou*li, transacts little business per
taining to his department at the meetings.
He joins in talking about other things, and
he settles matters concerning ins own de
partment at private conferences with his
chief, mostly held a.t night, m'any hours he
ing consumed In talking over foreign ques
tions.
The next call 's upon the Secretary of tha
Treasury, who submits whatever he has for
the President to pass upon. And so it goes
on down the line, the Secretary of Com
merce and Labor being the last man to be
heard. The Postmaster General.?with a big
bundle of post office appointments, is often
the last man to leave a cabinet session.
After the others have gotten tiie Presi
dent's directions as to settling this or that
matter they return to their departments,
while Mr. Oortelyou takes up the question
of postmasterships In the large cities.
Members Seldom Vote.
A vote In a cabinet meeting Is an almost
unheard-of thing. No direct poll of a ses
sion has been made since the Spanish war
period, when President McKinley submit
ted to his cabinet advisers one of the great
questions of that period. lie wanted their
views, which had been qu.ite varied. There
was nothing, though, to bind him to *hn
results of such a vote. A cabinet officer is
merely an adviser. When he has concluded
his advice the President must be respon
sible for the final decision. It matters not
whether that decision Is a mere post office
appointment or a momentum one that
might mean peace or war. The cabinet dis
charges its duty when it has given its chief
the best advice possible
There have been no Imprudent or dan
gerously talkative cabinet officers In any
administration for years, and until recent
years no attempt has been made to impress
a general order of silence upon all of these
advisers. There were several times in the
administrations of President McKinley
when he asked cabinet officers to keep
"mum" upen certain topics before him.
There were some obliging cabinet mem
bers in the McKinley cabinets, layman J
Gage was one of the best and kindest of
these men to the newspaper profession, but
he maintained a dignified caution that was
invariably appreciated by the correspon
dents. He did not go Into details at>out
what happened at. the cabinet table, and
talked little on subjects outside of his own
department. Newspaper men who congre
gated at the White House at the close of
cabinet meetings soon found out the kindly
desire of Mr. Gage to do what he could for
them, and grew so burdensome In the num
ber and variety walking along with him
from the Executive Mansion to tlie tre? ury
that he at last began to avoid this twice-a
week procession. It sometimes resembled a
number of cruisers convoying a battleship.
Secretary Alger, now Senator Alger or
Michigan, was not a bad source of Informa
tion to correspondents, although he was
what many of thein termed "moody." One
day he would divulge a most important
news story. The next day lie would be as
close as a clam. He never otianged his
courteous disposition, though, during the
days when he was under terrific onslaughts
regarding the alleged embalmed beef fur
nished the soldiers of the army. He is yet
as closely associated with many newspaper
men as before.
Trust the Reporters.
Botli Secretary Gage and Secretary Alger
had a number of newspaper friends whom
they trusted lmpllci-tly. talking freely about
anything, but invoking the rule of confi
dence. which was never known to be
broken. The average Washington corre
spondent every day gets more information
in confidence than he gets for publication.
John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy,
never lost his suavity in dealing with the
regiments of newspaper men that constant
ly saw him during the Spanish war period.
He was, like most cabinet officers, a good
judge of what should be published and
what should be kept out of the papers.
The movements of the navy in critical pe
riods were not divulged, but he never
sought to Interfere with the correspondents
securing whatever Information they could
get hold of.
John W. Griggs was prudent In his deal
ings with the profession. He made friends
with those he could trust and talked to
them. So did Charles Emory Smith. Poet
master General.
Until a few years ago It,was a common
practice for newspaper men to walk away
from cabinet meetings with the President's
advisers or go to their offices afterward and
obtain from them whatever information
was not looked upon as likely to trouble
the administration, tout toy degrees this ave
nue has been closed. The centralisation of
news dispensation has narrowed in all de
partments and at the White House until it
is the understanding that all news must
pass through Secretary Loeb except minor
thing* in tbe departments.
