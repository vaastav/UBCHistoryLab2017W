odds the most important Presidential docu

since the days of Washington. A9 i
tomary with Mr. Lincoln in all his official
papers, he is brief, pointed and conclusive
in his reasonings. One of his chiefest neculi
arities is the exhaustive manner in which he
deals with a subject. The Message before
is pre-eminently marked in this respect,
and carries with it, moreover, i
tence, the most undeniable evidences of a
true, honest, sincere desire to serve and save
the country, independent of ull other consi
derations whatever.
