THE MESSAGE OFT IE PRESIDENT.
What;? kr may be the fate of the multitude
of publia documents whioh aooompaay Presi-
dent Grant's second annual message to Con
gress, the message itself has doubtless re
oeivoil by this time the full attention that its
importanoe, real or imaginary, demands.
To ayoid tuo possibility of premature publi
cation, the President refused t3 entrust the
precious docnnaent to the publio printer's
hands, and the representatives of the press
were kept at a distance until it was actually
transmitted to both houses of Congress.
This made it necossary to forward
the message to all parts of the coun
try by tolegraph, and it has doubtless
suffered somewhat by the procoss, as far as
smoothness is concerned, by reason of the
yrent haste that was demanded to satisfy the
anxiety of the publio. But, making due
allowauco for this unavoidable diflloulty, the
document i.s a plain, sensible, straightforward,
unpretentious, and well-written one, and
will compare favorably with similar state
papers emanating from the Executive Man
sion in times past.
Happily for the people of the United
H tat oh, the country Las now so far recovered
from the depression and disorganization re
nulling from 'the war of the Rebellion, that
Prowidout Grant was able to devote the
greater portion of his message to our rela
tions with foreign countries and questions'of
an international character, and that without
ignoring, except in a few instanoes, home
questions which demanded his attention.
Thero oould be no more striking illustration
of the elasticity and perfection of
our system of government than
this circumstance. Only five years
have elapsed since the last army of the
Southern Confederacy laid down its arms,
and within that brief period the great work
of rehabilitation has been fairly accom
plished, the only thing remaining to render
the wotk complete being the election of
Representatives to Congress in a single State.
Wneu Georgia is fully restored to her normal
position in the Union, the task will be accom
plished, and, as the President aptly remarks,
there will then be "no reason why we should
not advanoo in national prosperity and happi
ness as no other nation did after so protracted
and devastating a war."
TUB MESSAGE AND THE WEST.
BENTS POLIO Y.
A i.i none u we are happily almost re
lieved finally and forever of the vexed ques
tion of reconstruction, the great burden of
debt which is the most pertinent legacy of
the rebellion remains; and it is impossible for
either the President or the peop'e to ignore
it and tho necessities to which it gives rise.
The paramount necessity of meeting promptly
all the demands made upon the national trea
sury by tho nation's creditors is the basis of
the only national policy that oan be adopted
by tho Government with safety. The debt of
the nation must ' be paid, interest and prin
cipal, dollar for dollar, as it falls due. Re
pudiation, in any of its forms or phases, is so
utterly repugnant to the American people
that no demagogue can hold his own on such
a platform. The existence of this debt will
render imperatively necessary a large revenue
for years to come, and the manner of raising
this revenue is to be the point on which the
paramount national issues of the next quar
ter of a century mubt hinge. Every question
become subservient to the one grand ques
tion of a revenue sufficiently large to main
tain intact the financial credit of the coun
try. The most rigid economy on the part of
every branch of the public service is im
peratively demanded by the exigencies of the
national situation, and on this point the
President takes deoided ground. Another
position which he assumes is the necessity
for "a reduction of interest account," by
whioh, we take it, he refers to such a con
solidation of onr forms of indebtedness as
will reduce the annual interest on the debt to
the lowest figure consistent with national
honesty and national safety. "Revenue
reform," says, the President, "if it means
this, has my hearty support." But the
President, in common with the people of the
oountry, is in doubt as to what is meant by
the demagogues who are clamoring for "reve
nue reform," and he protests earnestly and
forcibly against any attempt to cripple the
resources, industries, and credit of the coun
try by the pernicious doctrine of free trade,
or the attempt to impone all the burdens of
the war upon the people by direct taxation,
for the benefit of foreign manufacturers.
In the closing paragraph of the message,
the President enunciates clearly what ha re
gards as the true policy of the country. It is
satisfactory, as far as it goes, but there is
cause for regret that he does not dwell with
more force and detail upon the absorbing
question of administrative reform. He de
u an da a "reform ii the whole civil' service
of the country," but gives us no justification
of the neglect on his part to attempt eerioasly
it inauguration; be advocates a reduction
of taxation, "so arranged as to afford relief
to the greatest number," but, unhappily, has
not a word to say against the obnoxious and
inquisitorial income tax, the continuance of
which he again endorses by bis silence on the
subject. On these two points the country
will justly express dissatisfaction, and de
mand, before many days, decided action ,by
Congress, even at the expense of a rupture.
more or less serious, with the Executive.
It cannot be denied that the course of the
adiuinintralion has not received the full en-
dwrsoment of the party which placed it in
power, and the result of the reoent Congres
sional elections has given an unmistakable
evidence of the dissatisfaction whioh prevails.
President Grant stands on perilous ground.
He has failed, In many raspeots, to meet the
expectations whioh were justly formed at the
beginning of his administration; and this
failure has been, in great measure, the result
of the shiftless policy which he has pursued
in the matter of the civil service. From the
heads of departments down to the most in
significant positions, he has not selected, or
cauRed to be selected, a class of men that
merits and receives the confidence of the
peeple. He has been too vindictive, has dis
played too much petty animosity, has too
often attempted to strengthen himself by un
wise removals and improper appointments.
But it is not too late for him to rally around
himself the honest masses of the great party
which elevated him to power, and the serious
inroads made upon the Republican majority
in the next Congress by Democrats, free
traders, and so-called revenue reformers,
make it necessary for the President forth
with to cease his warfare upon any portion of
the voters who placed him at the head of the
Government. The Demooratio party, en
couraged by dissensions in the Republican
camp, is already rallying for the Presi
dential oampaign of 1872. In the preliminary
skirmishes, our antagonists have gained
serious advantages. The mission of the
great Republican party is not yet at an
end; it is the real party of progress, the true
party of "moral ideas." By a united front
alone can it stem the adverse tide whioh has
already set in, and a united front it is very
far from presenting at present. For the dis
sensions which prevail, the President is in
ereat measure responsible. It is around him
that we must rally, if we would maintain our
own. Therefore, wo ory a truce to all
bickerings among ourselves ! Let us have
peace !
THE NATIONAL FINANCES.
Tbk Roport of the Secretary of the Treasury
is a methodical, business-like document,
which will have a good influence in maintain
ing public confidence in the financial condi
tion of the country and in inspiring the
belief that no hazardous experiments are
likely to be attempted at the present sossion
of Congress. Mr. Boutwell's statements and
recommendations are, in a geueral sense, so
satisfactory that he leaves little to desire
except an advocaoy of the abolition of the
relics of the odious income tax; and if he
had inserted a brief paragraph favoring this
just reform his report would havo been
a model document. Although the attempt to
fund tho debt at a reduced rate of intorest
under the act passed at the last sossion of
Congress has failed, for obvious reasons,
the national credit has in no wise been in
juriously affected by this failure. A nation
that appropriated a surplus of more than
$100,000,000 to the payment of the principal
of its debt last year,- and that will have a
surp'us of nearly $70,000,000 this year, in
spite of large reductions of taxation, rapidly
increases its credit by such exhibits; and if
Congress authorizes the proposed new loan
of $:500, 000,000 at five per cent., the interest
to be paid quarterly, there can be little doubt
that this will be taken, even if a continuance of
European distractions confines the bidders
exclusively to citizens of our own country.
Of the general position of the publio debt
the Secretary gives a graphic and satisfac
tory view in his statement that "$800,000, OOO
will remain unpaid, existing either in the
form of Treasury notes in circulatioa without
interest, or in bonds owned by the banks
and held as security for the redemption of
their notes, and that only about $ 1 ,000, 000,000
of the debt is subject to payment." Consider
ing the magnitude of the obligations created
by the war, the fact that they have already
been narrowed down to these proportions af
fords a wonderful proof of the wealth, wis
dom, and integrity of the American people.
THE MESSAGE ON OUR FOREIGN
RELATIONS.
Thk President's Message takes a firm, de
oided, and dignified stand on the many com
plicated questions whioh arise out of our re
lations with foreign powers. Most of these
demand more than the passing notice which
we can now give them. The San Domingo
question, especially, is one which merits
most serious attention on the part of Con
gress and the people. As this matter stood
at the close of the last session of
Congress, the whole thing looked very
much like a "job." Bat the arguments which
the President brings to bear upon the advisa
bility of acquiring a permanent foothold in
the West Indies are extremely powerful, and
as it is possible for the United States to ob
tain possession of San Domingo without
being outrageously swindled, we trust that his
recommendations will receive the attention
they merit.
On the Alabama claims question the Presi
dent has but little to say. The issue is at a
stand-still, and the action of Great Britain is
awaited before any decided movement is
made. But the oountry will not look with
favor upon the President's recommendation
that the Government buy up all the private
claims against Great Britain. There is no
necessity for'auch a course, there is no good
precedent for it, and the imperative necessity
for curtailing our national expenses in every
possible way will not permit its contempla
tion. ADMIRAL PORT MR AS 'A LETTER
WRITER.
Aimikal Poktek has made an addition to
the long list of worthies who have damaged
themselves by indiscreet letters. His official
position at the present moment is peculiar.
He has been considered the confidential naval
friend of the President, and is popularly cre
dited with the nnusnal honor of being able to
run the Navy Department according to his
private notions. After the death of Admira
Farragnt a new seal was placed upon his lofty
pretentions by his appointment as successor
of the heroic captor of New Orleans and
Mobile, and if this appointment U seat to the
Senate and oonfirmed by that body, Porter
will gain permanent possession of the highest
of naval positions. But alas for the vanity
of human ambition t At this oriticat junc
ture old Grandfather Welles is oruel enough
to'send to the mischievous New York World
a letter written by Porter, dated January 21,
18('.", shortly after the captnro of Fort
Fisher, whioh contains sundry
ill-natured complaints of the oonduot of
Grant. It gives full Tent to the spirit of
jealousy cherished by a portion of the navy
against the army. It alleges that Grant "is
always willing to take th credit when any
thing is done ;" that he did not properly ac
knowledge the assistance rendered by the
navy in capturing Vicksburg; that "he wants
magnanimity," and "is so avaricious, as
regards fame, that he will never, if he can
help it, do justioe" to the Navy Department;
that he had acted unhandsomely in connection
with the FortFishor affair by suffering Butler
to have anything to do with it; that his course
provos that he would sacrifice his best friend
rather" than lot any odium
fall on Lieutenant-General Grant," and that
he will take the credit for the final capture of
Fort Fisher, "when he deserves all the
blame for tho fiist failure to take the place."
When this letter first appeared it was an
nounced by the publication of a series of
extracts from Porter's private diary, which
were produced to prove that Porter thought
Grant and Sherman not only great generals,
but very good men, etc. This, however,
does not seem to have been sufficient, and
the Admiral now acknowledges, over
liis own Laud, the gonuiusnoss
of tho letter to Welles. aud
explains it by the assertion that at the time
it was written his mind and body were ha
rassed by extraordinary fatigue, and that he
has since entirely forgotten that he had ever
given utterance to such petulant sontimonts
The necessity of this explanation is mani
fasted by the statement it contains, that
Grant was so unfavorably irapr3ssed by the
"World's publication as to declare that it made
him lose faith in human nature;
and we can scarcely wonder that
it lowered the Presidential , faith
in candidates for first-class naval honors. It
remains to be seen what will be the upshot
of the World's disclosure; but it would not
be surprising if it should lead either to For
ter's rejection by the Senate, or to an aboli
tion of the grade of Admiral in the navy, or
to both, and Porter stands a fair chance of
losing by the maladroit labors of his pen the
honors he had so nearly secured by the
achievements of his sword.
TJ1E MESSAGE ON OUR CANADIAN
NEIGHBORS.
The President uses very decided language in
regard to our difficulties with Canada on the
subjects of the fisheries and the free naviga
tion of the St. Lawrence river; and we believe
that this portion of his message will be cor
dially endorsed by the whole oountry. There
is a point where patience ceases to be a virtue,
and it is certainly high time that our Govern
ment should adopt a line of policy that will
settle the points of controversy with our
semi-British neighbors in a manner that will
prevent any reasonable pretext for difficulty
in the future. The President correctly de
signates the Dominion Government as a semi
independent but irresponsible agent. It
has the power to inflict injury
upon us, while we are obliged
to apply for redress in London instead of
Ottawa a position of affairs that is likely to
be a source of trouble so long as it con
tinues; and it is a serious ' questidn whether
the United States, for their own protection,
have not a right to demand that the Dominion
of Canada shall either be erected into a com
pletely independent State or else that it shall
be deprived of the power of exciting the
animosities of its neighbors and then appeal
ing to the mother country for assistance in
case it is threatened. In nearly every con
troversy the United States have had with
Great Britain concerning her claims upon
this continent, we have, in the interest of
peace, yielded more than dignity and justice
demanded, and it is time now that our rights
were . asserted in a more positive manner
than they ever have been before. In regard
to the fishing dispute there is no difficulty
whatever, except such as has been created by
the Canadians themselves, and the whole
matter oould be settled satisfactorily if the
Dominion Government or Great Britain were
disposed to carry out the provisions of the
convention of 1818 in good faith. In order
to compel the United States to renew the
reciprocity treaty that was discontinued on
account of Canadian bad faith during the
Rebellion, the "Bluenoses" have revived the
fishing dispute solely for the purpose of
annoying us and forcing us to come to terms,
and, for the same reason, they have attempted
to control the navigation of the St. Lawrence
river in such a way as to impede our com
merce. The President says plainly
that in case any attempt is made
to confiscate United States fishing
vessels under the Canadian statute authori
zing such proceeding in event of trespass,
under their interpretation of the convention
of 1813, it will beoome his duty to take such
steps as may be necessary to protect the
rights of the citizens of the United States,
This language is certainly plain enough for
the most obtuse "Bluenose" or "John Ball"
to'nnderstand, and the President, in using it,
we are convinced expresses the sentiments
of a large majority of the people of the
United States.
In regard to the free navigation ef the St
Lawrence the President demonstrates that,
not only by treaty but by recognized inter
. national law, the United States are entitled to
use the river as a highway without impedi
ment, and that the Dominion authorities have
no right to interfere with the navigation of
our vessels except by such police regulations
aa are absolutely necessary for their own pro
tection. We have more than once alluded to
the necessity for the free navigation of the
St. Lawrence being at the command of the
i United States, and to ensure this the whole
of the territory south of the river ought to
be in our possession. This is an even more
important subject than the fishery question,
and the President has done well in alluding
to it if only for the purpose of attracting to
it the attention it deserves and exciting dis
cussion that may lead to important results.
SO V Til CAROLINA FRAUDS.
Hon. C. C. Bowrw, Republican M. C. from
the Charleston district, South Carolina, and
the regular Republican candidate at the late
elections, has furnished the Washington cor
respondent of the New York Tribune a sorry
picture of j carpet-bag management of elec
tions. JMr. Bo wen was opposed by De Zarge,
a colored irregular candidate, who has been
returned as elected by some G00 majority,
and Mr. Bowen will contest the seat. His
report of the ballot-stuffing by the election
officers, if approaching the truth, shows that
South Carolina is Riven over as a prey to
anarchy, and needs rather more regeneration
and watching than New York city or Norfolk.
The following is Mr. Bowen's statement as
given In the Tribune:
'lie bats that the worst election frauds In New
York are not to be compared with those perpetrated
In every part of Sooth Carolina. The SUie election
law. whioh was enacted last March, affords every
facility to dishonest managers and supervisors of
lection. ISf its provlHlous the Governor is directed
to appoint lu each ooaaty a supervisor ef elections,
who, in tarn, appoints three manager in each elec
tion precinct. After the polls are closed, the mana
gers are aiioviea to nave iue custody or the ballot
boxes for three days, at the end of whioh time they
must make a return. In uiany cases la Siuu Caro
lina the manngers of election were candidates for
the legislature or for county offices, and could,
therefore, during the three dajs that the ballots
were In their possession tlx them to salt themselves.
Mr. Bowen says that he can prove that In many pre
cincts the ballots oast by the peoplo vrare taken from
the boxes by the mauagcrs, and others substituted
for them before the count was made, and that when
It was found that even then their opponents would
not oe nereatea, moy scraccneu tno names or tho
Utter from tho ballots In other districts, aud sutmi-
tuted those of their own candidates. The only place
In South Carolina where au honest election wa Held
was Charleston, aud there it took place uuder th
f rovlHions of the new United States election law.
n 186, Mr. Howen's majority la Charleston was
about looo. This year it was more than 8000. and
yer, so great were the frauds in the country, that he
was 'counted out.' lie estimates Lis rightful ma
jority at about 10,00. lie thinks the Republican
majority in the Mtate Is about soon. The majority
returned Is about 80,000. The people of Mouth Caro
lina are very indignant that they have no redress,
and Mr. liowen doubts if the State will go Kepuhli-
caa at the next election."
