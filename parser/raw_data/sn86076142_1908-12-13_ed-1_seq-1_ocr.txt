(By Associated Press.)
' NEW YORK; Dec. 12. Indirect but pointed criticism of Roose
velt's attitude toward the Judiciary was made by Chief Justice
Mitchell of Pennsylvania tonight, in an address at a banquet of
the Pennsylvania Society of New York. The' chief justice did not
mention the executive1 by name but left no doubt through quotations
and all uslons aS to the object of his criticism. "For the cure of
evils 'temporarily prominent it Is impatiently advocated that the
combined powers of. the government be centralized in the execu
tive.' said Mitchell. "The only safety for all is obedience to the
law as it is written, not to a strained and distorted construction
to make it mean what it does not and never intends to mean. Only
criticisms of judges and laws must come ;from & court which
knows the law and has jurisdiction to declare it. Dissent from
this view based upon individual opinion of what the law ought to
be, whether it comes from an executive or p hoodlum, leads di
rectly to anarchy and the assertion of individual will against set
"tled law. The very phrases so prominently put forward of judges
"who have lagged behind the times, betray not only Ignorance but
deplorable incapacity to comprehend the fundamental principles
of the American government."

CARSON,- Dec. 12. Acting Governor Dickerson, who recently
appointed Judge Stevens to the district court bench at Goldfleld,
declared tonight the indictment of Stevens was merely an attempt
to discredit him In an effort to cause the withdrawal of his' ap
pointment. Stevens offered his resignation, but the governor re
fused to accept.
THE INDICTMENTS.
GOLDFIELD, Dec. 12. Owing to his previous connection with
the Bank of Ourfty, Colorado, Judge Theron Stevens, appointed to
serve in this district on the district bench, has been Indicted on
nine counts by a grand jury of that Colorado town. The charge is
receiving deposits at the bank, knowing the institution to be in
solvent at the time.
Judge Stevens came to Goldfleld about two years ago, and the
bank of which he was vice president failed .subsequent to his leav
ing Colorado. As vice president, he had little to do with the ac
tive management of the institution's affairs, his responsibility be-,
coming potent only during the absence of the president. News of
his Indictment came as a distinct shock to himself, and caused
his hurried departure for Colorado several days ago, where he
readily gave ample bonds.
Capiases have been issued also, against George K. Hurlburt,
president of the bank, and Frank P. Tanner, cashier, accusing
them of the offense named. Nine Indictments were returned
against Judge Stevens and Hurlburt, and five against Tanner.
