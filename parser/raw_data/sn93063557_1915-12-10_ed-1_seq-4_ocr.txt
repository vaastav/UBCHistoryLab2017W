FRIDAY, DECEMBER io, 1915.
Speaking of old Thomas Tusser, as we
did a week ago, it was he who said:
"At Christmas play and make good
cheere,
For Christmas comes but once a
yeere."
The National Life Insurance Corn
pany of Montpelier is the most recent
addition to the strong Vermont financial
institutions advertising in the Register.
Mr. Albert C. Laird, special agent, is
finding a cordial welcome for his com
pany in Middlebury.
The editorial in anothercolumn on the
ritrhts of small schools and the wisdom
of keeping them alive issensible, sound,
and well informed as to Vermont con
ditions and the way to promote rural
welfare. It is significant as to the
policy of the present Board of Educa
tion, since the editor of the Randolph
Herald is a member of the Board.
Not only Brattleboro, ' but all Ver
mont, will sufTer a loss in the removal
of Rev. Roy M. Houghton to a large
Congregational church in New Haven,
Conn. A young man of high character
and strong personality, earnestly
religious but broad and tolerant, he has
helped to strengthen the moral and
religious forces of the State. There
are a number of such men in Vermont
who are likely to be appreciated in
larger fields beyond our borders.
President Wilson's message, which
will be found in our issue of this week, is
an important and interesting document.
It marks two new positions on the partof
onr scholarly executive, military pre
paredness and co-operation with the rail
roads. It has surprised the country in its
vigorousdenunciationof disloyalty on the
part of citizens of European sympathies.
It proposes to tax industrv, not to pro
tect it, in order to meet increasing ex
penses. Here it is most open to attack
and it will be interesting to see what
Congress may do as to its revenue sug
gestions. It is not often that a weekly news
papergelsan opportunity to review a
book. We have heard that the big
dailies and national weeklies receive
thousands of copies of new publications,
with the expectation that an announce
ment or criticism of them will be pub
lished. That is not our good fortune,
but we are now in receipt of a drama
of great merit, well printed in a neat
little volume by the "Little Leather
Corporation" of New York. This play
is of thrilling interest. Both in dra
matic power and in literary quality,
it exceeds anything we have ever seen
in the Town Hall, even "The Birth of a
Nation." The title is "Hamlet, Prince
of Denmark." If the Little Leather
Corporation have any more literature
of that sort, we trust they will not for
get us.
GOOD WORK FOR BOYS.
It is a modest story Mr. Morhous
tells in his report to the County Com
mittee of the Young Men's Christian
Association which is printed in another
column, but it U a story ot good work,
the best kind of work, earnestly and
faithfully done. It is good to develop
a paying dairy, to turn a sour field into
a fertile meadow, and to increase the
yield of corn twenty per cent an acre.
Every new well-filled silo, every pros
perous creamery adds to the wealth of
the county. But the greatest item of
wealth in the county is the boys and
girls and the man who helps them most
is the most useful citizen.
Morhous works for boys. He
takes them off camping in the summer
and gives them a good clean time. He
lets them paddle in his canoe and shows
them where to catch pickerel. They
never hear him swear and never see
him smoke. In winter he puts on rough
shoes and machinaw and hikes with a
bunch of three or four ofT to Thad
Chapman's lumber camp, where they
fry bacon and tell etorics about bears.
If a boy is real safe and careful, he can
ride Morhous's colt. How he feeds that
colt with his salary always about two
month's behind is a mystery, but prob
ably the boys know, for the boys know
every thing that Morhous knows, how
to fmd your way in the woods, how to
make a stretcher, how to work over a
pcrson that has nearly drowned, and all
sorts of thlngs they do not tcach in
achool and which fathcrs do not have
time for.
Morhous stnys with tho boys, all day
long nnd every day in the week. Frotn
Ferrisburg to Brandon and Orwell tho
railroad thinks he is worth a pass ho
looks up the boys and gcts acquainted.
He isn't much of a prcacher, and he has
never been nsked to sit for his photo
graph for a fashion magazine, but he is
a big asset to Addison County, and his
salary ought not to be bchind all the
while.

FEDERATED FAIR.
The Federated church fair, held in the
Opera House on Wednesday and Thurs
day was a success in every way, in spite
of the weather. There was a good
crowd yesterday and last evening al
though it stormed continually through
out the day and evening.
There were many attractive booths,
among them a fancy work booth, a food
booth, one for candy, and a Japancse
booth. The latter and a doll booth at
tracted much attention. A "Woodland
Cafe" was especially attractive and
wellt patronized. The entertainment
consisted of various drills, which were
well received by the audiences. One
especially, a blue bird drill by some

SECRETARY MORHOUS MAKES
REPORT.
(Continucd from Pagc 1.)
the fair grounds for some time. Tho
local Y. M. C. A. for the present is
meeting in the basement of the M. E.
church. We still have the Otters of
Vergennes and clubs are organized in
North Ferrisburg and Orwell. Requests
have been received for two other organ
izations which I hope to get started in
the near future.
In the last of September I sVoke
three times at tho Sunday services at
the State Industrial School and on a
Monday spoke to the young people of
the Vergennes High School. A short
time af ter I spoke at the Cornwall Corn
Show and three Sundays ago spoke in
the Baptist church of Lincoln.
During the first part of October Mr.
Carrigan and myself worked together
in completing arrangments in regard to
the Addison County Corn Show. Earlier
in the season we had solicited the mer
chants of the various towns for prizes.
In reply to a question by Judge But-
ton in regard to an old lumber camp
which Mr. Chapman had deeded to the
Middlebury Y. M. C. A., Mr. Morhous
said: "About six miles east of Middle
bury there is a very picturesque spot on
which stands a deserted lumber camp
and saw mill, the property of Mr. T. M.
Chapman. It has been the custom of
some of the local Y. M. C, A. boys to
go out there on hunting and hiking
trips for over night. Since the cold
weather has come on the idea of fixing
up one of the rooms to stay in occurred
to some of the boys. A boy went to
Mr. Chanman for his nermission and he.
undoubtedlymindful of the time when
he was a boy, handed to the boy a cleed
of the building and the land on which it
stands. The boys bought a stove, which
I carried up the mountain in a road
cart with the colt which Professor
Means had given to me, and the boys
have set up the stove, carpeted the
floor with odd strips of carpet from
home and have flxed up a couple of beds
and nearly every week two or three
boys go up to the camp to stay over
Friday night."
Mr. Morhous's report was accepted
and after a careful consideration of the
question of finances the committee at
the suggestion of President Thomas
turned to the consideration of the hos
pital project. President Thomas spoke
earnestly of the need of going to work
at once and showed to the committee a
sketch of the proposed hospital which
had recently been received trom Miss
Proctor's architect.
After a discussion of the different
phases of the undertaking the motion
was made and carried that the commit
tee heartily endorse this course and
that the secretary be instructed to de
vote as much of his time to it as shall
be required by the people interested in
the movement.
RUSSEL CIRCLE INSPECTED.
A meeting of the William P. Russel
Circle, Ladies of theG. A. R., was held
Tuesday night at the home of Mrs. Edwin
E. Jones on Water street, Mrs. Jones

annual inspection of the circle was
made. The president of the State de
partment, Myrtie M. Parker of Burling
ton, and the department inspector,
Clara Rock of Not thfield, were here to
conduct the proceedings. There was a
large number of the local circle present.
Refreshments were served. Remarks
were made by Inspector Rock and
Comrades Charles E. Youtt, James M.
Tracy and Walter W. Martin, past
commanders of the local Russel post.
President Parker and Inspector Rock
went Wednesday to Essex where they
are to inspect the circle in that town.
MRS. ELIZABETH E. DEWEY.

Josiah E. Dewey, who has made her
home with her brother, Henry Ham
mond, on South Pleasant street, died

fast table Tuesday morning and seemed

her age, but after breakfast she com
plained of a headache and a doctor was

trouble. She is survived byone brother,

There is no better managed organ-
lzation m the world than the Commis
sion for Relief of Belcium. which now
includes the section of Northern France
devestated by the war. The needs
were never so great as at the approach
of a second winter. The United States
are responding nobly and Vermont is
trying to do her nart of the work.
Bishop Hall has sent a request that
collections be taken for this cause next
Sunday in every Episcopal church in
Vermont. Other churches are doing
the same.
If all who understand the importance
of giving aid at once to this stricken
people respond. Middlebury can easily
lift her share of the butden.

SMUGGLERS' NOTCH ROAD.
The Montpelier Argus of recent date
contained the following interesting
item: "B. M. Hayward has returned
from Smugglers' Notch where he has
been in charge of laying out a highway
from Jeffersonville to Stowe. The gen
eral contour 4of the highway was map
ped but the fills and cuts were not put
in.
"In speaking of the profiles through
the notch Mr. Hayward says that there
are none in the White Mountains that
equal those in the Notch excepting the
Old Man of the Mountain, while in the
Notch is the elephants head which is
very good. The man and woman and
several animals, as well as some other
profiles, are exceptionally clear. He
expects the elephants head with its
trunk will take a fall some day. Ster
ling lake attracted his attention a good
deal and called to his mind the Crater
lake in Oregon, which also has no visi
ble means of replenishing its waters,
being on an elevation to which there are
no water sheds. The approach from
the Jeffersonville side of the Notch
will be with an eight per cent grade
while the Stowe side will be a little
steeper."
MR. T. J. CORNELL DEAD.
Mr. Thomas J. Cornell of Cornwall
died on Friday, November2G, after an
illness of heart trouble. Mr. Cornell
spent the summer of 1913 in Weybridge
at the home of Mrs. Cornell's mother,
Mrs. W. C. Sturtevant. He had re
cently removed to Cornwall, N. Y.,
where Mrs. Cornell's sister, Mrs. R. W.
Thompson resides. He is remembered
as a kindly and considerate man, of
many estimable qualities.
