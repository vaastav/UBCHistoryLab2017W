The Trnltlc in Chinninen In Culm.
" On Wetluesilny lust onu thousand Chl-
tinmen wero lunik d lui p. They wero fold
J before nrnvnl.'' These arc the wortls of n
recent telegram from Ilnrnnn. Thero nro
J few people, who nro aware of the outmpes
, on civilization and humanity I'otifceeeil and
A foreshadowed In this defpntch.
V Thu majority of O'lihuso laborers shipped
V f i oin China to Cuba nro kidnapped. A
vessel lies In tho Canton river, nnd the
BB rootles nr cnuclit at work on shore or on
HB tho river, forcibly taken on board, thrown
Hff into tho hold, and there compelled to s!pn
a contract expressing their willingness to
t'lnlgrate. Wo have ourselves conversed,
H rn thu plnntatlon of nn American citizen
HV nt Sagua, with a Chinaman who lind been
1 wealthy in his own country, and who was
thus forcibly kidnapped while enjoying nn
Hj , Afternoon salt in his yacht on tho river.
Hi i Borne, howovcr, voluntarily bind them-
fclrcs to nn apprenticeship of eight yeais'
Hi tervieu in Cuba. Hut all such nro cruelly
HJ deceived. Tho monthly wngt'f, four and an
Hi eighth dollars, in consldcmtion of which
HJ those who voluntarily accept the eomll-
Hj Hon of exile, is in China a largo sum of
money to a laboring man; in Cuba it bare-
HJ ly sufllces for their indispensable requlro-
J When they nrilve In Cuba the Chinamen
J nro almost luvnriably sold as Ueld bauds
ft for sugnr plantations. Thero they are set
HP to work nlougsldo tho negroes nnd under
Hft tho supervision of Spanish overseerr, tho
M most ignorant and brutal set of men on
HJ tbo island. Tho physical endurance of n
fl Chinaman, especially under n burning sun
J to which he is unaccustomed, Is Inferior to
HJ that of the negro to whom the troplcnl cli-
K mate is congenial ; but tho overseer looks
HJ only to the result, and tbo consequence is
HJ thnt tho Chluniunn who has hoed less
HJ ground or cut less cnue than tho negro Is
HJ ' punished for his shortcoming without any
HJ i Inquiry iuto the cause.
H , Although tho contract, whether voltin-
HJ tartly or lnvolutitarlly sigued by the Cblna-
HJ man In his own country, is valid before the
HJ -taw ns tar ns conceit tuu power of the
HJ owner over tho serf, tho latter has no re
HJ dress at law against his master, lie is a
HJ .pariah, outsldo tho pale, has no rights, no
H 'representation, no power of obtaining any
HJ remedy. Hut the coolies' cup of misery Is
H) yet far from full. Under the actual rule
Hr of Spain lu; Cuba tho Government reeog-
HJ nizes the validity of the contract, nnd
HJ forces tho Chlnamun to Involuntary tervl-
HJ tude under It. Alt theo contracts are
HJ ' mnde terinlunbblo nt eight years from
Hjb their date, and in them it is expressly stitv-
HJ ' tiluted that nt tiielrtermlnntiou tho coolies
Hj shall enter iuto tho enjoyment of absolute
Hf freedom, nnd shall bo at liberty to devote
HJ themselves for their own bencllt to what-
H ever industry they choose.
H Here tho SpanUh Unvernment steps In
H and Is cuilty, lu thu unmu of law, of the
H most atrocloiu) violation of nil law, bu-
H ' man nud divlno. It compels every Chiim-
H man In Cuba who has hcrveU out tho time
H of his contract to ui'nclave himself for an-
H other terra of eight years, and so on with-
H out end. Failing such new indenture, tho
H cooly ta set to work In the public chain
H gang! An African slave in Cuba may pos-
H Bibly, by extra labor nnd ecouomy, work
H out his own liberation. A Chlnauiuu never
H can, for tho Government will not allow
H blin to become possessed of any property
'. even his accumulated wages. Ho it inev-
' ltnlly a slave for life.
There are no people nn the face of tho
earth who entertain a wanner love of their
.' native country than the Chi into, llut
from the moment they set footou Cuban
foil all hope of returning to Chinn is
banished. Moreover, as thu Chinese cml-
grants to Cuba aro exclusively males, they
find themselves placed between two races,
to either of which they arc objectionable,
and nil fnmlly tie? nud nffcctlous are con
sequently impossible. And even religious
consolation is denied them. They are pro
hibited from worshipping accotdlng to
their own creed; and the Government of
Itia Most Catholic, ilajesty carries ita idea
of Christianity beyond tho grave. A
Chinaman cannot t buried cither in a
1 1 public cemetery or in the negro grave-
' yard of an estate.
Three hundred nnd fifty years ago the
King of Him in Inaugurated the African
slavo trade In Cuba, The pretext under
' which tbo Infamous traffic was then al
lowed was that the Indian aborigines of
Cuba would otherwise bo exterminated.
The clvllied nations of the world have at
; length succeeded In alinott completely
suppressing this atrocious traffic. And
shall Hpalu in lfcT- be allowed to blot tho
fair name of America by tho inauguration
f of a t radio In Chinamen not less heiuou
or less inhuman than that in Africans?
I An Unsentimental Pnrtr
If, after tho President's message, thero
i wero anything lacking to illustrate tho
utter absurdity of the suggestion made by
the oa'.'oTT young politicians who assumed
tliu rriiponclblllty of miming the auti-Ad-
ministration party, that tho Oiikblky
electors should cast their votes forGn.NT,
the course of tho Administration Senator
furnishes It. Tho proposition of those senti
mental young men seems to have been
baMxl upon tho Idea that the late Presiden
tial election was simply a contest between
two men; thnt thero were no principles at
take, no question of government In
volved; but that it was a. pure nnd simple
persounl btrugglo for office. And fco, death
lutvlug como to tho reluforcoment ot one
randWInte'it name and fame, in the hushed
( moment of sorrow over the nation's loi,
ttullo thu Intely warring factions stood
togothur with bowed heads over the opon
tlity could see uothlug but the per-
sonal and sentimental side of tho great
campaign; and becauehloppoti6nUma
ifesttd a decent and becoming rfgtetover
tho victim ot uarlcutura mul ualumuj,
they proposoil to bury with hlu not outy
tho luilmoslty nnd blttcnieBs thai hvl
tiett engendered liy all msant lt tbem
forgotten but to yield sverytUusj HJ
that was phic.ud In Issue.
fil T1 rcommeu1'-tieiiB of the President
In his mrfsage, and tho positions taken, by
tho Administration party In tho Senate,
strip tho situation of sentiment and set
theso things In clearer light. It is manifest
enough that tho nnllon's mourning nt
HoiiAcr. Gmeeluy'h death wns not over tho
cnudhlato of tho Cincinnati nnd Ualtlmoro
Conventions, tho representative of tho
Cincinnati platform, tho statesman for
whom thrco millions of votes wero cast. It
was for tho great journalist, tho pn
tiiot, tho philosopher, the lnrgo-hcnited,
houcrt man. It wm upon this coMn
that the gentlemen in Congress nnd out
who were lntcly nrrayed in hostility
ngaliiFt Iloiucn Ontnt.r.v cast the flow
ers of their rhetoric. They did not roll-act
or qualify a single iota of thelrop
pofitlou to the principles ho represented.
Nor did (Jen. OitAxr, In attending tho
fuueial of tho lamented statesman nud
participating in tho mournful pageant, do
anythlncmoro than wnsdecontly lit tlngnud
graceful, certainly nothing that should en
title him to tho reversion of the dend man's
voles, or rhouhl Induce thrco millions of
voterMo nbnndou their convictions.
HonAcn Ciicli.ev represented certain
living Ideas. Theyltvoon though ho has
depaited. Perhaps his death may mollify
thu nccrblty of his Into opponents; let us
hopusn; but wo may not Hatter ourselves
with the belief that it wilt turn them for
a moment from their purposes. The tight
for nnd ngnlnst centralization nnd corrup
tion nnd iulgovcrument must go on. Tho
President In his message very squarely
raUcs the lssuo. If that document has any
distinguishing feature It is its recommend
ation of policies that aro utterly at war
with tlioso represented In tho candidacy of
Moracr GncEMtr. What Is tho meaning
of tho recommendation of tho postal tele
graph, of continued and increased subsi
dies, of glgnutle schemes of Internal im
provement, of tho expenditure of f6,000,000
n year for flvo years under the pretence of
restoring tho carrying trade, unless It is
that all tho weight of the Administration
nud the party Is to be thrown Into tho
scale In favor of paternal government and
increased facilities for corruption? In so
far as President Gbaxt's mcfsacc says any
thing at all, its positions arc such as mny
well awaken the apprehension, of tho
honest men who miulo tho Cincinnati
movement what it wn. Thero Is enough
In it to furnish cause for the initiation of
just such n movement now, hod it novcr
becu. And yet the young men who re
volved on the Cincinnati wheel and thought
they were the wheel Itself, went big with
the idea that because Horace Gjieklet was
dend the three millions of citizens whoso
protest against Gnintism was registered In
their votes for him should bo turned over
bodily to the man and the measures they
oppoed.
Nothing in the history of our politics
was ever half so absurd as thl. How It
would have been appreciated by tho gen
tlemen who have just received their new
leaao of power u -lilblted lu tho gross
proceedings of the caucus which by a par
liamentary device prevented the offering
of n tribute of respect to tho dend man's
memory nnd afterward kicked off from
the committees everybody who had voted
for hlra.
Thu fact Is thu Administration party Is
strong enough to do as It like, and He In
stincts aro to do it roughly. Thu gushing
young gentlemen who proposed the other
day 1" P' lim-fc Into partv with R
handful of electoral votes as a peace offer
ing would have only becu kicked off the
steps lor their pains.
Lnto Intelligence from Liverpool Is to
tho effect that the English demand for
American coal, which has already assumed
considerable proportions, is likely to be
permanent and to increase. Some ot tho
dealers who have transferred their orders
from Liverpool to the United States aro
shipping American coal to Egypt nnd the
East Indies, as well as to plact-s lying near
er to this country than to Great llritnln.
Coal is certain to asumo shortly a most
Important position nmong our exports, as
South Americn and the West Indleiaresure
to draw heavily on our markets for their
supplies of thla fuel.
President Grant's recommendation that
the I'nlttd States shnulil tak poMeMlon of the
electric te If tTaph lines and npernte them brlniM
to mini) the (act that tlio Ootornraent baa ut
ready bad some practical experience In the
utilization of the electric fluid. In the Capitol
Is an electric apparatus used for llf htlne the gas
burners In tlio dome and th ball of ltcpre
tentatlves. This apparatus supplies no llttlit,
but merely Ijultes the eaa Ixtuhitf (rout the
burners liiftantaueouily, performing the oQce
usually supplied in public buildings br a man
armed with a torch at the end ot a Ionic pole.
Mr. JCKCKra of Iihodo Inland some time ago
made a report on the practical operation of tlili
apparatus which becomes of Interest at this
time. From this report It appears that the arer
ase coul per nl.ht for leultliuc the gas which
Ha-liUil the dome and hall of Hepreeentatlies
Id 1M7 was f tOJS ; lu UC8 was fl.1i.il ; and Id Ml
was $156.40. ny the same report It appear that
In tho year 1871 tbe coat of Itnltlna the gas w
precisely seven and two-tenths cents for each
burner every time it was ll.UUd; and that by
experience and practice In the use of tbe ap
paratus the Government made such progress In
economy that whllo la 1M7 tlic ball and dome
were lighted thirty-three times at a cost ot two
thousand six hundred and fifty-two dollars, In the
year 1871 It was able to llitht up the same por
tions of the Capitol twenty-three times for three
thuuiand six hundred and ninety-six dollars, or
one thoutnml and forty-four dollars moro than It
co.t In 1M7 to light them ten fewer times. This
case affords an admirable Illustration of the eco
nomical methods our UuTcrmueut Is accuntomed
to uie H)ireer there U on occasion for tho ex
penditure of the pulillo money; and accom
plished mathematicians, from the Information
here supplied In regard to the expense of work
ing the electric gaa Ihthtcr, may perhaps be alilo
to figure out approximating what It would cost
the Government per anuuru to operate all the
electric telegraph lines In the country, not
counting the new lines to be built for the benefit
of favored contractors.

Mr. Held liegan his argument In replr, nnd
after a compliment to Mr. Graham, his associate,
as tho head of tlio criminal bar, nnd to the loelc
and force of his argument, ho proceeded to re
inforce his arRiiment that " audit" could not he
held to mean an inquiry Into the original ac
counts, but at most tho comparison of vouch
ers with bills. He Instanced tho many auditing;
board of private corporations which sat merely
to oxatulno and approro bills paid. It wni not
necessary for him to spesk further as to the
lunttcrs Intrinsic to the Indictment, nud ho
paused to tlio other braprh, tlio matten oxtrln
sir to the Indictment. The law provided that
no man slinulillbe- tried for crlmo except on tho
Indictment of a (I rand Jury. And that n (I rami
Jury, not n mob of 23 men, but a part of tlio

without dispute wero that twenty counts of this
Indictment were found without nny evidence -those
relating tu tlio claims of Keytcr. Holler,
Iugcrsoll, Davison, Miller, nnd Smith. What a
pregnant fact was tliatl What a commentary
on tbe fairness and honesty, nay. the profes
sional honor of tboso who procured this Indict
ment 1
Mr. Justice Ingraham Interrupted Mr. Field,
saying thnt It was not necessary to mako any
personal remarks on thl argument.
Mr. l-leld said ho did not propoao to Imputo
bad motives to these gentlemen, but they had
the right to call things by their legal names. It
was admitted by tho absence of dental that
twenty of these counts were unsustalncd by
evidence. It wa admitted that on Mr. l'cok
hain's withdrawal a Action of a name, John
Drown, was put In.
Mr. Justlco Ingraham Was nny name neces
sary 7
Mr. Field Jfo; but It wns Introduced for tho
purpose of concealment. It was admitted that
Mr. l'eckham was under tho most bitter preju
dice against the accused, and had pulilWicd
matter designed to prove tbo accused the worst
man In tho world. Ho Imputed no evil motive,
but even If with the best of motives, a man had
such prejudices, he was until to bo a Judga or
Juror, or to be Uie adviser of Jtlilgo or Juror.
Had this been done bv tho District Attorney
himself, be would have called on the Court to
create a precedent that that office was not fit to
advise tbe Grand Jury.
AN tSTKltltfl'TlOX.
Mr. Field read at some length Mr. rcckhsm'
affidavit, when he waa'lntvrruptcd by tbe Grand
Jury coming lu.
The prisoners who were Indicted were then ar
raigned, and all plead not guilty. They were re
manded, and alter this Interruption Mr. Field
resumed his reading ot Mr. rcckbam'a affidavit
of what occurred while ho was present beforo
tbe Grand Jury. That was what happened up
to the loth of October, when the Grand Jury
minutes showed that on tbo complaint of
wiieeler II. Wckhatn true bills had been found.
Thnt closed tbe Urat net. Then Mr. l'eekbum
said he heard that defendant's counsel objected
to It. He did hear It In open court, and ho
heard Judge Urndy's remarks that the action
was highly improper and should be Investigated.
Then he says that he advliod tho District Attor
ney toadvlae the Grand Jury to tako action iff.
nnro, and tbo minutes of tho Grand Jury of the
1Mb showed they heeded that advice, rescinded
their action, but their new minutes aro a literal
transcript of the former minutes, except that
only five of tho seven wltneycs previously ex
amined were before them.
MR. FECKIIAM Iff Till onAXD JCTtY TIOOM.
Was tho presence of Mr. I'ockhain In tho
Grand Jury room on the sth proper) The
Grand Jury wero to preserve tho counsel of the
peipl and their fellows. How was that to be
preserved If (tho Court would permit the em
ployment of counsel to practice before the
Grand Jury. It would be Introducing a new
class of counsel. Our statutes gave authority to
no one but tbo sworn law officer to appear before
them, and a case lu l'cuiisjlvanta so often cited
as tu be trite condemned lu tbe strongest terms
tbe Introduction of volunteer advice to tbe
Grand Jury, but Mr. l'crkhutn uppuared nut
only as counsel hut a prosecutor. On the com
plaint ft Wheeh r It l'eckham thn minutes
read, "llut third ho forced himself on the
Graud Jury." There Is a little loop ot tlicm
asking him to ctamlue vvltnexscs, but tiny nl

procured by the pressure ot the District Altvr

A famce. . ,

not name a substitute. The statutes provided
that when he could not art the court should

there shall be but three Assistant DUtrlrt Attor
neys: and again another act authorise- him, at
tbe trial, to employ, with tho consent of the
County Judge, assistant counsel. And that con

The Court took the papers, each side banding

Mr. l'eckham then called up the other Indict

plead to that,
Mr. Ilitrrlll answered that they should move
to iptash that on the same grounds and on other
grounds.
Mr. Held thought It was Imposing on the Court,
as the settlement of the iuestlon already

riarnum'e Clre.ua oust .Menagerie.
The class of ontcrtuinnicut afforded by
the combination of circus and menagerie which
Mr. Ilarnum has Inaugurated at the well-known
Iron building In Fourteenth street, though slm
plo In character, la ono which f uruUhes a great
I deal of enjoyment to large uurubers ot people
and very sensible people too.
Great Improvements have been effected In tbe
structure, Tbe auditorium of ths old Iron tent
has been divided Into two circles, of which the
lower Is occupied by "orehestru chairs" and
other reserved seats, and the tipper one devoted
to the general public, Uy till simple contrivance
Mr. Ilarnum has doubled the caiwctty of his
building without tbe addition of n foot of super
Octal area. Tho space beneath the seats ot tbo
auditorium has been floored, celled, and nnkitial,
and Is uow occupied h the cages ot wild beauts,
of which the collsctloi) Is In some particulars
exceptionally Due, We doubt If such beautiful
specimens of the fc'lrpffo or pvlar bear hare been
seen In this country before.
Tho museum pari of tho show Is paltry, and If
It comprises llAouO curloeltles, the count must
have been madn up by Including each button on
tbe clothes of the wax figures and each hair on
the head of the "beautiful Circassian." The

only tells how he, with Dougherty and Mc
Laughlin, both now dead, laid the plot to mur

tho divulging of tho real facts nnd authors of
several mysterious crimes of tho first magni
tude, Including ono murder committed In Chest

terrlblo deed In which ho himself was tho main

charges upon tho Fourth Ward gang and tho
Whiskey King some mysterious connection with
and responsibility for this flro, but he tells It so
vaguely that l;ut few have believed It as mure

The night of Feb. X, lWs was as wild and fear
ful In Its nattiro as Is seldom witnessed tn this
climate. It had snowed and sleeted Incessantly
all day, and at nightfall rain descended In tor
rents, whllo the tcmperaturo modoralcd to such
an extent as to causo a general thaw. Tills,
with tbe rain, converted the six Inches of snow
on tbo ground Into a seething and surging
slush. Nearly every sewer Inlet was choked
through the preceding neglect of the city
authorities, and In tho lower sections of the
city tho streots wero Impassable, while In many
Instances tbe water ran Into tbe cellars of the
dwellings. Travel by foot or horse was almost
Impossible, and nearly every street railway car
i line was obliged to cease running. It was on
such a night as tbls.that four miscreants started
for what they, It Is possible, did not intend to
be as great a calamity as ensued.
At the southwest corner of Ninth street and
Washington avrnuo was a lot of ground en
closed with a paling fence and partly covered bv
rows of wooden sheds. Tho law forbidding the
storngo of coal oil In quantities within tho
built-up portions of tho city was not then tn
existence, and, Indeed, was tbe result of the fire
that followed. Over WO barrels of coal oil were
stored under the sheds, arranged In tiers two
deep. Shortly after midnight Hugh Mara,
James Dougherty, Jamea MrOiu-k, ondMcMcn
amln Fleetwood approached thla lot.

The Incendiaries had plotted to set Ore to this
coal oil. They knew It would crcato a great con
flagration. The oil was stored near dwellings
Inhabited by persons In comfortable situations
In life. They would be startled from sleep at
midnight, and, torror-strlckcn by tho fire, they
would rush from their houses In affright, leaving
their property at the mercy of these thieves,
who would enter their houses under pretence of
being members ot the Moyanienslng Hose Com
pany, which Is one of tbo most notorious organ
izations nt tho old Volunteer Flro Department.
Tho desperadoes had well matured their plan,
and had also another and favorite Inccntlvo-thc
hope of iucltlng a riot between their own and a
rival fire commny, with which a deadly v.ttrfare
had existed for years. Tho four scoundrels
had lounged aruuud the vicinity of Klghth
and FitxwalUr streets, the locatlou of
tho Moyatucailng Hoso Company, sev
eral horns that evening, occasionally leav
ing the hone homo for neighboring bar
rooms. At cildnUbt they started on their
errand. The coal oil depot was thoroughly rc
connoltered, and the vicinity for several Mpiares
inspected, but uot a traveller was to be seen,
and even the pullcoinen wero driven to shelter
from tho raging storm, feeling sure that the
roundsman would neglect his duty on such a
night. They entered an alloy lending to the
depot, and Im-Iiist provided with cotton, tow,
pitch, oil, and other combustible, with plentv
of mntche. Msra, the rhlef ruffian, volunteered
to start the flames. Dougherty stood at the ond
of tho alley to give warning of the approach nt
any one, while ttieother Uo,Mcliurk and Fleet

Washington avenue nnd LJIsworlh street.

It was the work of but moment for Mara to
climb the pickets and gain a concealed corner
In ono of lh sheds. The barrels wero greasy
and leaky, and under ono of tho leakiest Mara
atwtalhU bonfire. He saw Uiat It was fully
under vt ay, with no prospect ot extinguishment,
the oil catching, and then made a hasty retreat
and Joined hit companions. They waited about
ten minutes, when a fucker ot light was seen
against the fronts of the houses opposite. They
ran to the spot as If greatly excited, and gnve an
alarm. Policeman Murray.who was a few squares
off, and several clUterwv who were returning
home from the coterie carnival at tbe Academy
of Music also saw the flames at the same mo
ment, and Joined tbo unsuspected Incendiaries,
lly this time the fire was spreading rapidly, lick
ing up the oil and gaining f rcah vlgur from the
saturated shedding and planking. To sound an
alarm was the 0rt action, and two or thrco pi
llccmen from surrounding beats, who had ar
rived un the ground, ran to an alarm box at
Klghth street and Washington avenue. This
box was out of order, and could not be worked.
It was necessary to run a quarter of a mllo to
reach another box. Travelling was slow on that
night, with the sidewalks aud streets ankle deep
In slusli. Meantime tbe Dames gained fearful
headway,

The cltlsens and policemen who began to ar
rive nn tbe ground saw at onca that there would
be great danger to those living near the liurnlua

them. Hither nil slept with extraordinary sound-
Ream or attributed tbe noises tu thu storm, for
was a task tit great difficulty to arouse tbo
sleeper. Doors were hammered, stonca and
pieces of lee thrown against windows, and at
last all but two families were awakened. The
Fire Department begun to arrive, but found
great tnnildnln procuring water, as tho hvdrauta
wero partly froten. Tbe fire had swept through
the whole depot, and barrel after barrel of oil
burst and tbe accuiuunilited oil finally ran out
and flooded Ninth street. The street was filled
with water, and tb oU floated on It and burned
atthassnio time, Tbe aloiw ot tbe street Is to
tbe south, and tbe blaxlug oil began to flow that
way, extending clear to the walls of thu houses
ontloth sides ot the street. It was a roaring
torrent of fire. Jetting to thu tops of tbo houses,
and travelling aa fast as a man could walk. A
steam engine was located at Lllsworth street,
and was with difficulty saved from destruction,
tbe horses being scorched by the flame. In ten
minutes fifty houses were burning, and the till

l-Vd.-rnl street, branching Into Ellsworth and
one or two smaller streets,

In halt an hour after Mara had tired tho barrel

all In their power. Many cltlxeus appeared, and
houses near the scene uf disaster wero readily
opened to tbe distressed fugitives. The ruth of
the flumes was appalling. A strong wind was
blowing, and carried the flro far over tho roofs
of houses, which melted away as If made of wax.
Many persons only escaped by leaping from rrar
windows to sheds. The Intense heat crumbled
the stones of the street and warped the railroad
tracks and lamp potts, lira plugs, snd other Iron

THI1EE SUIIVIVINU IIABCALS,
Morrow, McOurk, and Dougherty. There can
bo no doubt that they never had an ldcn that
the tiro would assiimo tho character It did, or
rntiso tho destruction of human life, nnd their
first Impulse was to bind themselves by solemn
declaration to stand by one auntller and kovp
the fatal secret. Hut lltUn suspicion of incen
diarism, however, prevailed, and It was only
hinted at as pirwlblo. The fire was generally
attributed to spontaneous combustion, and tlio
agitation culminated lit a universal demand for
a law forbidding tho storage of coal nil within
thn city limits, which was speedily passed.
Time rolled on. and the coal-oil lire passed
from tho public mind, or was only mentioned as
a deplorable visitation of Divine Providence.
The consciences of tlio three Incendiaries, how
ever, smote them often, although they Indulged
In new deeds of villainy. A year or so went by
nnd McOurk could not agree with Dougherty
and Mara In regard to all their villainous plans.
Mara and Dougherty, being older In crime, tried
to drag McOurk still deeper by the hold which
they soemed to have on him, but to tbelr aston
ishment ho retaliated hy suddenly threatening
to dlvtilgo all he knew of the origin of the coal
oil fire to tho authorities, telling them thnt be
could do It with perfect safety to himself, as lie
would be Plate's evidence and receive a free
pardon.

At first tbev wero frightened, and attempted
to enjole him ; but he was on his guard nnd ro
ix'sted his threats. At last the two determined
that, as thero was no safety for them from a
man of his disposition, tbe only resort left was
to mako away with him. Mara met him on
tbe street, and told him that somehow or
other the news had leaked out that he
(McGurk) was the man wbo started the coal
oil flro. and that as no suspicion attached to
tbem he had better leave tho city at once. As
McGurk had been with them so long and was
such a good fellow thev were determined to
belphtm. Mara at last alarmed McGurk, who
promised to leave Philadelphia at once, until
the excitement, It any there was, had blown
over. Mara then proposed that McGurk should
meet hlui and Dougherty on the next night nn a
lot running from Fttzwater to Catharine and
from Seventh to F.lghth streets, well knuwn to
l'hlhuielpbians as "Sweeny's lot," and tbe scne
of several murders and numerous bloody af
frays, robborles. (W. In days guno by. It Is
now covered with buildings. At that time Mara
promised that they would give McGurk a sum
duo him from prooeeds of certain tbeflasand
also tell him haw to met after he had lied.
McGurk promised to be punctual lu attend
ance, and Mara left him aud went In search of
Dougherty, whom ha soon found, and detailed
tu him the arrangement with McGurk. He then
proposed tbat bo would sclie McGurk and slide
Ills erics whllo Doughertv slabbed him. Dough
erty dissented most emphatically from the lat
ter portion of tbe plan, but upon Mara's repre
senting the danger to buthlt McGurk was uot
killed, ho consented.
The appointed night was dark, there being no
miMin. At 11 o'clock Mum and Dougherty met
McGurk In the centre of the lot, near the tenets
ot a row ot small buildings. A rambling eon-
venation ensued, but the would-le murderers !
found that tholr task was not easy, for McGurk
was suspicious, and on bis guard. Heine well
built, he was a match tor either of bis Intended
astallatits, neither uf whom wasa powerful man.
THE DEATH STTtL'OOI.r.
At last Mara became tired of waiting, aud with
a "Now come on" to Dougherty made a grasp
for McGurk'e throat. Dougherty's heuit failed
him. Ha did nnt aid hi companion as promptly
as was Intended, and with a well-directed blow
MrGurk laid Mara out on the ground, and then
struck for Dougberty. Mara quickly arose, and
with Dougberty, whose blood was now up, rush
ed at McGurk. Tho latter fought them well,
and Inflicted severe punishment upon them ;
but Mara or Dougherty, which he did not know,
drew a knife, ana cut hiiu badly several times
about the arms and body. Tho unequal context I
could nnt last long without his receiving a
serious wound, and at last he got a fearful cut III
the nbdotuen, from which his entrails prit
truded. Kven with this terrlblo wound he still
fought, until at last be sank luaeuslble from loss
of blood, but nut before the assailants hnd In
flicted several other wounds. They then, think
ing him dead, fled. Their secret was known to
none but themselves, and they appearod at their
old haunt as usual.
McGurk, however, was not dead. He lay on
the ground for some time, and was at last found
by some iiersons crossing the lot, They con
veyed hint to the Pennsylvania Hospital ut
Eighth and Pino streets, four squares off, where
arorp of experienced surgeons exsmbied his
wounds, snd found tbat although verydanavr
ous they were nnt necessarily fatal. Later, how
ever, fever set In, and there was but little hope i
ot his life,
McGurk, when, younger had been an operator
tu the city police telegraph ofllces, and thera ac
quired an acquaintance with the late Dr. lllack
biim. for many years and until the time ot his
recent death. Fire Marshal of the city. McGurk
had always been a wild youth. Dr. IUackbum
noticed this, and attracted hy certain good
jualltles of the lad endeavored to reform hlra.
McGurk would listen, but bet was apparently
naturally Inclined to evil habits, and coulliiue.l
to associate with n gang til young scoundrels
who were the hangers-on of toe Moyamenslng
Uose Company.

Trom the Interest taken In him by Dr. lllnck

respect fur him. While 111 be had been nursing
his revenge agalust Ida late comrsdes, and
believing ho was abjtit tu dlo ho sent for Dr.
lllackburn, stating that he had an Important
communication to mako tu him. Now Dr.
llhuikburn, front his Investigation Into tlio
causes of the coal-oil fire, bad boen strongly of
tbe opinion that its origin was Incendiary, but
having very littln real evidence of the fact, hml
prudently said but little about It, and theu only
in city officials. He bad had his eya oil McGurk
for a long time, aud nf course uu Mara and
Dougherty also. Ho bad suspected them uf
setting lira to several buildings, and ths recent
confession ut Mara, proves that this susplcltui
was correct. Dr. lllackburn knew that a short
time before thu ull fire McGurk had Borvcd uut a
tonu of two years' Imprisonment lit Now
Jeraey for arson. He believed that somo
clue to the tiro would ha had, snd hastened
at onca to the hospital. McGurk appeared to t
very glad to see lilm. McGurk at once explained
his condition, and gave a succinct narrative of
the plot tn burn Uie oil depot, relating all the
facts mainly as we hive given them, following it
up with tlio quarrel, tho enticing of himself to
tho lot, and tho subsequent stabbing. Ho stated
lu the most posltlvu manner that Mara bod ar

crisis and rapidly recovered.

Dr. lllackburn communicated his intelli

with tbem aa to what should ba done. They

McGurk wns advised by Dr. lllackburn to leavo

to kill him. McGurk, to evade thtin, concluded
to tnko French leavo, and ono cveidng scaled

aided by tho wounds received on Hwcenv r lot.
It was shortly after tho death of McGurk that
the nnooits sitoon.va
occurred, and tlio subsequent capture, con

erty. Afterward the long illness and doatlt of
Dr. lllackburn himself almost effaced tho Mc
Gurk statement from tbo memories of tho half
a score of persons who knew about It. Tho re
vival ot tho notoriety of Mam by the shooting of
McMullln has produced whlspors of his con

many It Is but surmise.
All that we have stated, however, Is contained
In sundry papers, sll of which are yet In exist

have them. Of those who set fire to the nil de

erty having been recently killed by a desperado,
probably acting for some of tho gang Involved
In tho Ilrooks affair. Mara Is the only one
who survives, and ho has Just entered a Jail to

that at times shock and horrify communities
by their daring and utter defiance ot all law.
To the Policy Holders of (he Mutant Life In
surance Company of New York.
Tlio Trustees of this Company having,
after a critical examination of tho thirty years'
experience of the Company, and on mature
deliberation, unanimously resolved once more
to rcduco the rates of premium for Insuranco,
it Is proper In their behalf that tho existing
members should bo Informed of tbe onuses
which have lod to this Important measure, and
of the effect which It will hare upon their
Interests.
The rates of premium first used by this Com
pany were borrowed, of necessity, from English
companies. In the year 1E53, alterations and re
ductions wero recommended by Mr. Charles
GUI, the flrtt Actuary of the Company, and
adopted by the Trustees. In ISO), Mr. Sheppord
Romans, then Actuary, proposed further cor
rections, many of them reductions, In the. Table
of ltaics, whloli, after Investigation, were adopt
ed on his recommendation.
In a recent statement to the public of the
financial condition ot the Company, cm the 1st
nf October lost, In which are given the results
of some thirty years' actlvo business, It is stated
tbat ot all the Cash Premium llocclpts nearly
fifty per cent, of the same has been returned to
th Policy-holders. Far the greater port ot this
large return consisted of payments on the part
of the assured, over and above the actual cost
of the assurance which the premiums were In
tended to secure.
THEor.r.
To understand this, It tn prrnilaed that the
business of tbe Compauylls founded upon what
Is called tho American Table ot Mortality, aud
four per cent. Interest for money. The table does
not materially differ from others tn use, except
In tho assumption tltat of a given number now
living at the age, say 3, none will survlvo tbo
I ago W.
lly the principle of Life Contingencies it Is
found that the true amount to be paid at tbe
beginning uf over)' v car to assure a sum payable
at death is variable, being smaller at the younger
and grsater at tbe older ages. This variable
ranges from f 7.T0 ut age 23, to f W1JH at age M, to
Insure $1,0X0, on the supposition that the man
agement of monoy will be without expenso.
These variable amounts aro called the annual
cost of Insurance, llut aa all business opera
tions are attended by exonses,a certain amount,
usually a percentage at these costs, Is added,
and the result Is another scries of variable
amounts called Office Premiums.
Dut to pay a constantly Increasing premium
very year would ba attended by serious Incon
veniences, and It has become the custom, In
consequence, for the Company to charge and
the assured to nay a fixed sunt every year, of
which the value Is such that Its ultimate effect
will be the same as tbatot the variable payment.
It is a kind of average, being too large at the
younger, and too small at the older ages. The
practice of tho Company has been tu add forty
per cent, of tho net rate to cover ordinary ex
penses. Then taking tbo age 36 as an example,
we may write;

1871, was less than eight per cent.; and the provis
ion uf forty per cent, nf the net premium for ex
penses has therefore bucn much In excess of
what was required. Tho surplus from this
source has been very great.
Tho result Is that large dividends havo been
returned to Policy-holders front tbelr overpay
ments. The majority of the members have left their
Dividends with the Compiiny to accumulate in
the form of Koverslonary Additions to their
folieics.
The Company liw now been In existence thirty
years. In every ono of these thirty years It has
Issued a Tolley to a person Reed Mi, who Is now
living, and who has paid each year's premium tn
full, and has left his dividends or overpayments'
to his credit In the form ot Additions to his
Policy.
The ratio of the present cash value of the ad
dltlons now credited to each ef tbe Policies, to

Thus showlmttho smallest amount returned for
overpayments to be twenty-seven percent, of
tho premium paid, and that even upon tho
Policy which has been but ono year lu force, by
far the most expcnalvo. Whereon, the greatest
reduction In tho proposed new ecalo ot rates Is
less thnn twenty-two per cent.
There can, therefore, bo no doubt nf tho safety
of the proposed measure, or of tho nblllty of
tlio new Policies to tnko enra of lliomjclics, tu
pay thelrown way, and ncctiinulnto n surplus.
It will bo apparent from nn examination of
tho foregoing tahlo that If tlio premiums upon
thoso thirty Policies had been made, twenty-two
per cent, less than they were by diminishing tho
pte-entago addition for otpensos, tho result
would have been that tho Policy-holders would
havo retainer tho difference In their own pock
et. Tim Company would have been Just as
sound, for, as win i , ,I0 fa(;U al)0T9
stated, It would havo he, a. i,e ,,rolH,r te.
serves on each Policy, but tlio diriucx. r 0er.
payments would havo been smaller.
Without disturbing nny old Policies, U Is now
proposed to put In forco a new Table of Hates
for new Policy-holders. In theso now Hates a
change Is mado In the percentage, for ex
penses other than death claims, reducing It
from forty per cent, to ten per cent,
UKn Whole Llfo Policies the effect Is to
reduco tlio premiums twenty-one and four
tenths per cent. Upon other classes of Policies
the reduction Is not so great. No chango other
than a reduction In tbo provision for working
expenses Is proposed or made.
When tho computations for dividend are
made each premium will receive the pre
cise surplus which It earns. Tho low
premium will receive a comparatively small
dividend, because It will have earned less. The
high premium will receive Its surplus upon
precisely tbe same basis as heretofore, nnd Its
dividend, fsr from being dlmlnlshod, will bo
enhanced by tho Introduction of newly-selocted
and younger lives.
Should any of our old or present Policy-hold
ere, having policies capable of being surren
dered, wish to take advantage of the new and
lowered rates, in such case, (as they will mako
a now contract with the Company,) they will, on
surrendering their old Policies, receive from the
Company their suircnder value, In cash. As a
matter ut Information. It may bo stated that ou
Policies Ave years old or lets, the oxcliaugo thus
effected will bo ot some slight gain to the hold
er. On older Policies there would bo no gain.
Tlio Company has made ample provision for i
the fulfilment ot every ono of Its outstanding
contracts. Even If It should ccaao to-day to
Insure any new members. Its fatid would be
sufficient to psy every death claim, as presented,
and to return yearly to Policy-holders a surplus.
Its assets would lu the course ut a few years
begin to decrease, but the last dollar would
be on hand to pay the last legitimate demand.
The surplus accruing under such circum
stances, however, would necessarily be con
siderably less than If Its new business were
continued. New lives, In youth and health, ad
mitted to the Company, bring a reduction In
the proportionate average losses by death.
Present members havo been benefited In tbta
way. New members wilt shortly have the samo
advantage In their turn, and meantime, will re
ceive their insurance at fair and safe, rates,
while the Company is entirely mutual In Us
operations, and both now and old members
must mutually benefit each other.
It Is no less the Interest than the duty of tho
Trustees of the Company to tako core that no
plan or change shall uow or at any time be
adopted which would In the least Interfere with
tbe rights, the safety, or the advantages of tbo ,
old Pulley-holders, as thev and tholr friends are I
themselves Included amoiutlho number.
Tho faith of tho Policy-holders In the sound
ness of the Company and the conservative and
careful management uf tts Trustees ought not, -therefore,
to be shaken by the attacks which are
made upon It by Interested and unscrupulous
persons wbu aro envious of Its position and
great acknowledged, success. 1

W. II. C. Hautlett, Actuary.
Tbe Mnlnnl Life InaurMiteo Company ef Newr !
York.
The uiulertlKneU, us a trusteo of the Mm
tual Life Insurance Company, has received a
communication from Mr. Htepban Knzllsh. 127
llroodwsy, reflecting severely upon the manage
ment of that company and upon tho personal
character ot Its President.
This lottor has been very widely circulated.
and the friends of the company deem It vtitltlcd
to respectful notice.
I have no personal acquaintance with Mr. F.n?
llh, aud con only Infer tho object of tholetttf ,
from the bitter spirit which pervades It. .
The personal reductions upon tho Presided
of the company are but repetitions of rhnrgeC
which hava been made In years pa.t, and am
now gathered up In form calculated to promote!
serious apprehension. They have all been loci
since made tho occasion ot the fullest Investi
gation by the trustees and by legislative com
mittee, and have resulted tu nothing sufflclect '
to Imimlr confidence In hie character aa a safe
custodian of so high n trust. The trustees havs
again and again exprvnswd thla oplulnu ot bis
fidelity.
The present omluent position of the Mutuas
Lite Company Is, In their opinion, the most urn
snswerobte testimonial ot his zeal, fidelity acJ.
cadency as an officer. I can only reaffirm, la
the strongest terms, as an Individual member,
what the trustees havo unitedly done under
their signatures, that the company Is In tls
best posxilile condition for the security of lis
members; Its funds are most Judiciously cared
for and Invested, and are sufficient to meet an
possible liability; and that tho ndmlnlstratlf a
Is guarded by the trustees with the itlmsit
scrutiny which the delicate nature ot tbelr tru.C
demands; and that the entire management I
surrounded by all the chocks and guarantf i
which long and careful experience has suftfesbM
for the perfect safety of the Insured.
With respect to the Important change of pjH
Icy recently adopted by the company, r.suulfl
a reduction ot premiums upon new policies W
be Issued, I can only say that it wasreroaw
mended by the eminent actuary of the rompsny
alter most deliberate Investigation, received tM
maturent review by the appropriate comru!tt"i
and was adoptetf by die Hoard after full dlseui
slonot Its nature and consequences. Thehcl
that for many years the annual dividend return
able to the Insured amounted tu a considers!"
proportion of the premium received, sud tk.t
the company had passed through eiery i i
of experience with the same siihsuntlsl reu t,
led to tho Inquiry whethor It was not sale
company and Just tu the Insured, and IlierefftS
the soundest policy, to diminish the annual CsH
payments, rather than to exact more thiu
absolutely required, for tho sake of sutt
quetitly returning a portion of It to tbe payer"
It was clearly shown that this chance ,u i
be effected without prejudice to old ,ll','
holders, who would receive upon tbo siuxitj
adjustment of profits tholr pro-rata slisr1'
their contributions, and that tlio business ft 11
company would gradually lapse from the sld
system Into the new, with equal Justice t'
concerned. H would bo manifestly Intproi"
fer me, an Individual member, to dlsenes
question which the Hoard has thus tlellherat I
adopted; but It It shall bo found thnt the c"
pany havo taken a step iinwaiT.uited by "f"
rleiiee, they will as promptly rotract It. I
