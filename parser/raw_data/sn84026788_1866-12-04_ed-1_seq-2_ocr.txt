' We suppose, though we hare no informa
tion on the subject up to the honr of going
to press, that the ramp Congress assembled
in Washington yesterday. There i? much
. speculation in regard to the policy to be pur
sued towards the non-rccouetructcd States,
particularly as it is evident that they mean to
reject the proposed constitutional amendment.
It was thought in Washington on Saturday
afternoon, that the President's message would
not be sent in until to-day, Tuesday. Wo
?xpeet to give our readers the main portions
of this document in our next issue.
Thad. Steven swill doubtless be the rulinp
spirit during this session of the rump, as ho
was in the last. A correspondent writing
from Washington, says of him :
" Sinee the arrival of Thad. Stevens at the
seat of Government, increased interest in po
litical afiairahas been excitcd. 1 do not think
any great importance is properly to be attach
ed to his personal wishes and Intentions. If.
however, the actfon of Congress :s to be con
trolled by his dictation, then, indeed, there
will be stirring times this session. I under
stand he enters at any "bargain," as he calls
the conference beiween the President and Mr.
Chase, in which ij^e South is to be a party
?denounces "universal amnesty," thongh
eoupled with "uuivereAl suffrage," and deems
the aotion of the Southern States altogether
unnecessary to make valid the Constitutional
amendment. I also learu be has prepared a
bill, the purpose and operation of whieh are
to ronder null all the appointments made, bv
tho President during-the recess of Congress.
Further, Witt reference to this mountebank
?'his co-adjutors, a telegram dated the 1st
instant, says:?
*' Judge Kelley and Hon. Roswell Hart had
a long interview with Thad. Stevens to-night.
Judge Kelley has prepared an act to create
and organize a department, to be called the
Department of Internal Revenue, It vests
the ^appointment of Commissioner in the Su
preme Court, upon the nomination of the
Chief Justice, and allows the Commissioner
to appoint all bis subordinates. This bill will
be pressed at once to immediate passage. *
THE FREE SCHOOLS.
In another column will bo found a commu
nication from Joseph Barry, County Super~
intendent of Free Schools, in reference to the
Gtrictnrcs of last week's Spirit in regard to
the manner of tho misappropriation of tho
school fund of tho connty and the derelict
manner in which the officials of the West Vir
ginia school system had performed theirduty.
We have no wish or intentiou to get into a
controversy with Mr. Barry. What we stated
in our last issue in regard to the disposition
of the school fund drawn from the tax-payers
of Jefferson county, and pocketed or distribu
ted elsewhere, was done (or the purposo of
drawing the attention of the people to one
among the many outrages they have to sub
mit to arising from the corrupt legislation of
the bogus State. The individual opinions of
Mr. Barry, his impartiality or his wish to "do
something" has nothing whatever to do with
the matter. Ilis action in the premises, will
not lessen the enormity .of the crime that
filches from tfie pockets of our people, pretty
much in the same manner that a free-bootcr
would appropriate the purse of a "traveler,
nine thousand dollars of their hard earnings,
and the only satisfaction vouchsafed is that it
is the price demanded to insure the "success*
ful march of intelligence."
It will seem from Mr. B's communication
that he does not deny any ot the statements
made in our editorial. The facts as we stated
them are incontrovertible.
A PHILANTHROPIC "WORK.
An organization has been formed in Rich
mond, - designated as the "Medical Jcurnal
Commission,",with the benevolent design- of
ascertaining " the names and number of the
mbimed and*mntilated soldiers of the Confed
erate army in the Staterbf Virginia," so that
their shattered limbs, where possible, may be
substituted by the artificial jnventions of the
age. To accomplish this, tbip Secretary of
tho Commonwealth, at tho- iifctance of the
committee^ and request of Governor Pier-,
point, addressed circular Iettei%^Uu*freflf>cc
tive clerks of the one hundred and three?
counties composing the State, requesting the
needed information, so easily obtained, in be
half of the poor and disabled soldier. The
Committee reported a few days ago, to their
" surprise, mortification and regret," that
nearly one-half (forty^nine) of the clerks,
have failed to respond. Among this number
^we regret to see, aro those of Clarke, Fau
r, Loudoun, Page, Rockbridge, Booking
Ac. The returns received from the
fifty seven cities and counties show that there
are ;?
Amputations below the knee, .... 100
Amputations above the knee, .... 01
Amputations below the elbow, .... 85
Amputations above the elbow,.... 132
Making a total of' COO
Taking this as a basis for estimating the
number in the whole State, it is put down at
seven hundred jind fifty. Of this number the
Committee'argue that one-third arc indepen
dent of any aid from the State, end fur the
remainder they propose to memorialize tl.e
Legislature for an appropriation of $25,000,
to be expended under the direction of the
committee, of which Dr. JTunter McGuire,
of the Stonewall Brigade, is a member.
The okL.State, surety, will not refuse this
small boon to the patriotie heroes who iui per
illed life an a l|n>b in her defencc. We envy
not the heart or the head of that representa
tive who should prove so derelict to tho no
bler instincts of humanity.
? A mystery which quite surpasses the
sphinx is astonishing the New Yorkers. It
is a living human-head, resting upon a very
.6 mall cii^tuun and floating in mid air under a
strong light. It laughs, talks an(T recognizes
persons in the hall, but there is no obvious
bedy , and it floats at least four feet from the
floor, ceiling and walli. It is the greatest
puzzle yot.
THB CONTESTED ELECTION CASES.
During the last week, the Board of Super
visors mot at the county seat for the purpose
of hearing the contested oleution eases to
which we hare heretofore referred'in our col
umns. The first case taken np was that of G.
Leisenring who contested tho right of Wm.
A. Chaplinb to the certificate of election, as
Clerk of the circuit court of Jefferson county.
The counsel of the contestant moved a con
tinuance of tho case, which was rofused by
tne Board, and tho cause came on ior final

Whereas, The Constitution of West. Vir

the fourth Thursday of April, 1803 ; and
whereas, the convention "which framed said
constitution, did on the 10th of February
lbOrf, pass an ordinance to provide for the or
ganization of tho State of West Virginia
prescribing the terms of all persons toboclec
ted underbid constitution, but expressly con
ning 'he provisions of said ordinance ex
olusi\ely to the forty-eight counties then em
I raced within this State; and whereas the
counties of Berkeley :l?d Jefferson were an
nexed to anil made part of the State of West
\ irginia, since the adoption of said constitu
tion ana ordinance, and being cmbrnc d with
in the provisions of said ordinance, it became
necessary for the Legislature of the State
to make temporary provision by law for the
election of Sheriff^ during the 'first constitu

such elections having been held in pursuance
of acts passed by the Legislature, and not

THE FUTTJEB OP THE BODTH. |
We utter but a trite, centinien'. says tho
National InTclligencer, when wo f>Jy that the
future of the Sooth is in the hands of its i
youDg men. ? How many of them are quali
fying themselves to manage Ha factories, con
trol its railroads, mine its ore, v?rk
chine-shops, and cultivate its plantations?? j
Professional men it has in abundance?able
lawyers, accomplished physicians, eloquent
speakers. These have their 'ttscs, but the
growth of a State depends less on them than
on the character of the men who manage its
industrial enterprises. What is most needed
in tbe South to-day is that the young" blood
which fought for it so gallantly should work
it as determinedly. On the plantation,in the
shop, in the factory, there ?he South is to ef
fect its truo restoration. Tho young men ?
! v, ho dug trcnehes and fed on hominy and
pork, who w#nt clad in homespun gray, and
slept in cold or rain or ehihe under the cano
py. of tbo heavens to further the fortune^, as
they believed, of their native land, can now
?dc noble service by laying hold of its plough
handles. turning its lathes, guiding its spin
dles, handling its locomotives. But there is
want of capital. No matter. They have
youth, health, hope, ambition, and good abil
ities. They have every Incentive for which
to work. Begin with a will and success will
crown their efforts.
EDITOMAL BBEVITIES.
Don. Samuel B. Ruggles stated in
bis speech at tho Cyrus Field banquet in
New York, that there is in the United States
36,000 miles of railway, and 00,000 miles of
telegraph lines.
There are many indications that the
present session of the rnmp Congress will not
be os harmoniously radical as was anticipated.
There are many indications of a rumpus among
the rumps.
Gold has been discovered in Canada
at a place called Madoc. There is great ex
citement over it.
There is just now a great influx of
emigration into Texas, mostly from Arkansas
end Missouri.
A bill has passed tho Georgia Legis
lature, providing for the education, at the
State University, of all soldiers under thirty
years of age maimed in the Confederate sor
"vice.
The great suspension bridge over tho
Ohio at Cincinnati, two thousand two hun
dred und fifty feet long, has been completed.
It is the longest single span in the world.
The banks in New York city have
materially contracted their loans, and there is
just now a great tightness in the money mar
ket.
A radical paper published iu Boston
says that the work of tho radical party will
never be successfully accomplished until Bi
ble worship is overthrown, and that God is
no more to bo found in the Bible than iu a
geography !
Mr. George Watt, of ltichuiond, has
invented a plow, which he calls tho "cuff
brace," that widens und deepens the furrow
at will by tncans of a screw and key." By
means also of a flange running to the edge of
the mould-board, it prevents tho plow from
choking. Experienced farmers, who have
tested Its capabilities, pronouiyo it superior
to all other implements of the kind. i
Salmon P. Chase is tho presentChief
Justice of tha United States, and his highest
ambition seems to be to figure at colored ab
olition pow wows. What an immeasurable
difference betweeu him and Roger B Taney?
j But then this is radical progress.
. ? A bill has been prepared, and will be
introduced during the first week of the scs
| #
sion of Congress, repealing the act of Julyfl
? 1S02, which empowers the President to grant
full or conditional pardons to persons engaged
in the rebellion. If it becomes a law it con
fines the President to the Constitutional power
to pardon after trial and conviction. It is a
part of the radical programme.
West Virginia.?Condition of Her
People.
Tlic Wheeling Register presents the fol
lowing picture of the deplorable condition oi
the people under the rule of radicalism. It
is not over wrought, but on the contrary what
is said to be the condition of the Southeast
ern counties is more than paralleled in our
own and other counties this side of the Alle
ghenics:
"Id some of the Southeastern counties
nine-tenths of the people are under the radi
cal ban. They have been insulted, wronged,
oppressed and persecuted almost beyond for
bearance. They have been deprived of ev
ery civil and political right; they are denied
oven the |>oor privilege of expressing an
opinion distasteful to their radical and intol
erant masters. They arc excluded from the
courts, cither as suitors or attorneys, and the
efforts of their Kadical neighbors- have been
continually to oppress and never to protect.
About one man in ten in Monroe county is
permitted to vote, and that one man is gen
erally the meanest, lowest and most despica
ble creature in the community. They are j
under the despotic sway of a Judge who was j
once a rebel, is now a radical, and has always ;
been a scoundrel, no matter with what party
he professed to act or what disguise tie as- |
sumed. This man has been vested'with the j
power of appointing the tools he^desires for |
the consumation of his pujpc&cs, and elec- ]
tions by the people hava bcen abolished or
set aside by his ordprf'ln some instances,
paving been .nnnbtifto procure cit zens of the
State sufficiently versed in villainy to exe
cute his behests, lie has brought in strangers
from other States and appointed them to hold
important offices not legally within his gift,
and which not even the people themselves
could rightfully bestow upon any person who
is not a citizen of the Stale."
?At a school in Connecticut a boarder
owed his landlord 8-0, and as a receipt for
820 or over requires a two cent stamp, the
man gave the boy a receipt for 810.99 cents
and gave him back one penny, thus saving
one cent. If anybody can beat that in mean
ness, let's hear of it.
?The new Baltimore police commissioners
and Sheriff Thompson are about instituting a
suit against Judge Bond and others for false
imprisonment.
LOCAL MISCELLANY.
Installation.?The installation of Key.
A. 0. Hopkins, as pastor of thaiPresbyterian
Church of this place, is appointed for next
Sabbath, at 11 A. M.
Rev. J. W. Luptos is appointed by the
Presbytery to preside, to preach the sermon
and propose the constitutional questions; Rev.
R. T. Beret to charge the pastor; and Rev.
E. W. Bedinokr to delive^ the charge to tho
congregation. Preparatory services will com
mcnce on Thursday evening. There trill also
bo services on Friday morning and evening,
and on Saturday morning and evening.
Sale? and Improvements.?We have
learned of several sales of Land, Lots, &c., in
fown and neighborhood, recently, and* from
the figures, we should judge at pretty big
price? for even our good old county.
? The property known as the "Hopewell
Mills," on the Opequon dear Leetowa, was
sold on Tuesday last by Mr. Helm, as execu
tor, for $10,000. Isaac Strides, Jr., pur
chaser. _
? Thomas Rutherford has purchased
of E. M. Aisquitii one-half an acre of tho
eligible lot at the eastern end of town, known
as the Dr. Cramer property, for which he pays
8800. It is Mr. R 'a purpose, we learn, to
erect a handsome building in the course of
next season. -
? Less than one acre of the lot onwhich
formerly stood "Spotts' " blacksmith shop,
adjacent to the railroad, was sold a lew days
ago by Humphrey Keyes, to a gentleman
from Pennsylvania, for the stfug sum of
$1500 ! This lot cost 550 some twenty years
since, and has on it no improvements what
ever. It is the design of the purchaser, we
learn, to erect a spacious Ware-house, for the
deposit of grain and other produce, of which
he expects to become an extensive buyer.
? The fine residence on Main street, ad
joining the Rank property, belonging to the
heirs of the late William Stephenson, has
been sold for 83,000. Henry O. Talbot,
of Maryland, purchaser.
? An unimproved lot of 3| acres, adjoin
ing the residence ot Robert T. Brown, has
been purchased of John 11. Flag a, by Dr.
W. F. Lippitt, for the siyn of 8400. Tho
situation is a most commanding one for build
ing purpcfrcs, and it is the Dr.'s intention, as
we learn, to improve it handsomely the next
year.
? The fine residence of Dr. G. F. Mason,
destroyed accidentally by fire during the war,
is now in progress of erection, and hopes arc
entertained of having it under roof in a few
weeks. Messrs. Phillips & Lanodon, as
sisted by Lt. C'ockrill and his force, have
tl:e Carpenter's woik in hand, and the Messrs.
Tutwiler the Masonry. The house, we
learn, will be when completed, of tnorehand
ome structure aud convenience of arrange
ment, than previous to its destruction.
? We learn that Messrs. Ranson & Duke
intend erecting as soon as a suitable site can
bo obtaiued and the proper lumber secured,
a massive Ware-house, 25 by 75 feet, as an
adjunct to their already so well established
Agricultural Depot. All things considered,
we are inclined to believe with our friends of
the Shcphcrdstown Key inter, "there is life in
the old land yet."
MlDDI,E\VAY.?In a recent hurried pere
grination through the Northwestern part of
our county. We sojourned an hour or two in
this ancient village, hitherto of high repute
and renown. Its general appearance we rc
grct to say, was decidedly dull, its people ap
parently not having awakened to the new era
of things, or the spirit of progress and im
provement necessary to its development. The
several diuretics, school houses, masonic hall,
&c., remain in tact, and regularly used for the
purposes desigued. There are three dry
goods stores in operation, with respectable
stocks on liand, and a netr hardware store,
greatly needed by the people, just com
menced. Of hotels there are none, that old
Patriarch who had lived in the comuiuiiity
since the beginning of tire present century
having at last "gone the way of all flesh."?
Loug will the memory of old IIkkkt Smith
be held in kindly rewcmbrance! Of the
"Farnsworth Hotel," always the hom^-of hos
pitality aud good cheer, its propVietor, Mr.
Farnsworth, has converte4j(ifc"-into ? house of
private entertainment, a?d still ministers to
the weary traveller ijte accustomed good offi
ces. There license here or at Lcctown
to sell liquor, save at the restaurant kept by
H. Farulworth, jr., in the former place.
Thertf have been several sales of land re
cently, as we learned at liberal prices. Mr.
Wm. J. Grantham having become the pur
chaser of the .property known as-"Watson's
Mill," the entire buildings of which were de
stroyed by Sheridan in his brutal raid through
the Valley, is erecting a large aud substan
tial three-story merchant mill which is great
ly reeded by the community of Smithficld
and all its neighborhood. Among other
farms to which our attention was called as
being in market, is the upper end of the
home-place of Mr. John F. Sliaull, adjoin
ing the town. Ile offers 165 acres, (or it can
be made 200 in all,) of which 4GI is in tim
ber, situated immediately on the turnpike
leading to Shepherdstown and running down
to near the Opequon. It is represented that
this land is all good quality of limestone, save
about 25 acres, is divided into eight fields,
with three never failing.springs thereon.?
The improvements are moderate, but as hand
some a site for bnilding purposes, as can be
found in the county. The contiguity of this
land to market,-with turnpikes leading in all
dir ctions, churches, schools, &c., at hand,
and licalthfulness of location,renders it ope of
the most desirable investments we know of in*
the eounty. The price asked fur the land we
regard as nfry /otc, but m&re satisfactory par
ticulars could be arrived at by consultation
with Mr. S.. of Middleway and its environs.
Moreanou.
Last Chance.?To accommodate numer
ous requests. Smith, the Photographist, has
consented to remain until the 1st ef January.
In doing this, he is making a heavy sacrifice
for the public, which we hope will be timely
appreciated by all who desire Photographs of
the first order. .
'Acknowledgments.?We have hereto
fore omitted to return thanks to our esteemed
friend Mr. James M., Johnston, of the Shan
nondale Factory, for a piece of nice home
made cloth, sufficient to robe lis in a comfort
able winter suit. We hope it is unnecessary
to say that -we feel particularly grateful to Mr.
J. for so liberal an act of kindness, which is
the more acceptable, since it is bestowed it a
time of not only apparent^but real need. As
Ancmns Ward has it, our old clothes " are
slightly burnished by adversity," and we may
add, by long and very faithful service. As
they are rather thin for the present frosty
weather, we feel very much inclined to give
them a furlough until a change of season.?
This piece of cloth was sent to us nearly two
months ago, but the impoverished condition
of our exchequer?on ^account of the tardi
ness of our patrons?would not allow suffi
cient surplus from business demands, to have
the suit trimmed and -* made up " to our sat
isfaction. Now, however, the skies are be
ginning to brighten a little, and ther? is some
prospect that the cdit r will appear on Sab
bath next, or some time previous, arrayed in
his new suit, the donation of a benevolent
friend. To some extent, we ore bothered as
to what our feelings will be. We don't think
we shall fuel proud, although good clothes
have a very elevating tendency with U3 ; but
if we' should feel any. inclination to haughti
ness, we will only have to look at our old hat
and muchly-worn shoes to bring tu back to
the proper spirit of humility. But then, ifho
knows but that a hat and pair of shoes (new
one? we mean") nny reach our sanctum before
Saturday night. In such an event there may
be some of that vanity of which the preacher
speaketh. We may add that we wear a 7}
hat. Like our head, our feet are well de
veloped as to size, and for comfort, we wear
10'a when we have them. Oar overcoat is
not much to boast of, but it will have to go
through the winter, uuless bunevolenco should
provide a better one. On this point, we may
remark that we are rather tall?measuring
over six feet without shoes?and we always
jultnired long overcoats.
To a kind lady, th<> wife of an industrious
young iaruier of this county, we are under
obligations, for a pair of fine, fat ducks, which
we are sure we shall enjoy when we get
through with the padding and sausage which
we cxpect our friends to send us during the
present butchering season.
Mr. George W. Cockrell has sent us a
half bushel of the Guest potatoes wo havoseen
this season. We do not think they can well
be beaten?but we have heard that our friend
j'ackett raised the finest grown in the coun
ty. Of his we only speak fiom hearsay. Iu
the case of Mr. Cockrell we have direct evi
dence as to quality and size.
? ... ?
TtlASKSOIVlNO.?In rcapcct to the pro
clamation of President Johnson, and the re
quest of our municipal authority, Thursday
last was kept by the people of our town as a
National holyday. The day was observed
throughout the country generally, so far as
we have noticed, even in the God forsaken,
Constitution-breaking, rebel-hating Union
prating lit-*/ Virginia.
Declined.? We learn that the Kev. Hen
ry A. Wise, now located in the Upper Val
ley, has declined a call to the pastorship of
the Episcopal (Zion) Church of this town.?
Kev. Mr. Ambler, the former estimable shep
herd, is officiating whenever the state of his
health will admit.
Derate.?The next debate before the
Christian Association's Debating Society, will
come off on Monday night, the 17th instant.
The public are cordially invited to atien(j.
The question for debate will be: "Should
Ancient Languages be embraced in a Course

School Commissioners, in place of those who,
from inefficicucy or imbecility, have been
made to vacate their offices. ' The loyal few
will keep an eye to the matter, we presume,
and if they have any material in our midst
worthy of the position, at least select the best
they can get.

next, and in securing a "habitation" for him
self, Mr, Staley has erected a large and fine
brick dwelling, with a. large back building,

a severe and painful wound on Friday morn

The following letter was found }a the
streets of Columbia immediately after the j
army of Gen. Sherman had left. The ori- |
ginal is still preserved, and can be shown and
substantiated if anybody desires. We are
indebted to a distinguished lady of this city
for a copy, sent with a request for publica

comment on such a document. It speaks for
itself; "
"Camp near Camden, S. C., }
February 26, 1865. J
"JJj/ dear YTiJc:?I have no time for par
ticulars. We have had a glorious time in this
State. Unresisted license to burn and plun
der was the order of the day. The chivalry
have been stript oi moat ot their valuables.
Gold watches, silver pitchers, cups, spoons,
iorks, &c., &c., are as common in camp as
blackberries. The terms oT plunder are as
| follows: The valuables are estimated by com -
plies. Each company is required to exhibit
the results of its operation at any given place
one fifth aud first choice falls to the share
of the commaudcr-in cbiet and staff, oue-fitth,
to the corps commanderand stuff, one-filth to
field officers of regiments, and two-filths to
the company.
Officers are not allowed to join these ex
peditions without disguising themselves as
privates. Ono of our corps commanders bor
rowed a suit of rough clothes from one ol my
men, and was successful i i this placc. He
got a large quantity of silver (among other
things an old time silver milk pitclier) and a
very"fine gold watch, from a Mr. Lte Saus
sure at this place. Do Sauasure is one of
the i'\ P. V's. of South Caroliua, and was
made to fork over liberally. Officers over the
rank of captain arc not made to put their
plunder in the estimate for general distribu
tion. This is very unfair, and for that rear
on, in order to save themselves, subordinate
officers and privates keep back everything
that they can carry about their persons, such
as rings."ear-rings, breast-pins, cct., of which
if i over live to got home, 1 have about n
quart. I am not joking?I have at least a
quart of jewelry* for jou and all the girls?
aud somo No. 1, diamond riugs und pins among
them. Gen. Sherman has silver and gold
euough to start a bank. His share in gold
watches and chains alone at Columbia, was
two hundred and seventy-five, (-75.)
"liut f said 1 could not go into particulars.
All the general officers and many besides, h id
valuables of every description, down to la
dies' embroidered pocket handkerchicls. (I
have my share of thetn too.) We to<>k gold*
and silver enough from the d?d rebels to
have redeemed their infernal currency twice
over. This (the currency) whenever ne came
across it, we burned as we considered it per
fectly worthless.
?'1 wi.-h all the jewelry this army has could
bo carried to the "Old Hay State. It would
dock her out inglorious style, but alas; it
will be scattered all over the North and Mid
dle States. The d?d niggers, as a general
rule, prefer to stay at home?particularly af
ter they found out tha* we only wanted the
able-bodied meu, (and tell you the truth, the
younge-t and best looking women.) Souic
times we took off whole families aud planta
tions of niggers, by way of repnying the se
cessionists. But the useless part of these wc
Boon managed to lose?sometimes in crowing
rivers?sometimes by other ways. ^ ^
"I shall write to yoa again from Wilming

The Fenian* Rising in Ireland? The United
Stale* ond England.
. Londox, Not. 27?P. M.?The Fenian
troubles io Ireland have assumed considera
ble proportions, and there is no dotr&t that a
serious outbreak has occurred. Two regi
ments of national troeps were urgently or
dered to Ireland yesterday morning, and trans
ports were being prepared during all of last
night at Portsmouth. A large detachment
of marines have been sent over to Queens
town on the war steamer Plymouth. A gun
boat at Chatham, has been ordered to sail for
Qoeenstown immediately. Mp&i alarm is I
felt at 'Cork,- *nd throughout Ireland gen
erally.
The London Times this morning believes
that the cbicf organizer, Stephens, will soon

A telegraphic diapatch was received yester
day from Washington, by the United States.

hours in transmission. It is believed that it
"relates to the American question.
? A dispatch from Toronto, dated the
27th ultimo, says:?"Mo decision has been
given in the Court of the Queen's Bench or
Common - Pleas to-day as to granting a role
for new trials, as applied for by the counsel
of the Fenians under sentence of death. It
is rumoredthat a heavy concentration of troops
in this city is about to commence, in view of
the near approach of the 13th of December,

John H. Surratt and the Conspiracy
Against the Government.
A dispatch by the cable informs us" that
the presence of John U. Surratt, under an
assumed name, in the Papal army?
has been more than fainted at in severa^Te
cent speeches by Mr. Boutwell?has been
definitely ascertained, and that a formal de
mand fqr his extradition was made a few days
ago by tbo American Minister ; that the crim
inal was arrested, but afterwards broke from,
his guards, leaped down a precipice, and es
caped. If ever Americau hands again hold
control of the life of John 11.' Surratt. we
trust that the case may be mure ."kiliful'y
managed than at the trial of his fellow-assus
sins. Lie stands as the only known re|.nr-'
sentative of a conspiracy which, though it
was formed and culmiuated witfflti the l:?l

oj the middle The extent of the pen-,
eral ignorance about it may well be gau-jred
by the fact that of the two well known gen

the chief conspirator, while tho other stake*
his reputation on the shocking and incredibjC
accusation that the present "President of tJM
