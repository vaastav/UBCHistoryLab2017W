Senators Did M Find It Full
of Surprises.
CALL IT VERYCONCILIiTOEY
Tlio itepiibllcan I.Ike tbc llltij: of tlio
Venezuelan Advice mid I'mmlnc to
IlucU. Up the President If He Meiinn
IhlxIneMK They Swy He In lilddluK
for I'ubllo Approval.
It teas not a message or surprises. At
least that hfis "tee smeral Idea on the
Senate side.
Mr.l'ruden was on the floor GttbeEcnale
at niton ready to deliver the message.
He had to wait until tie morniic; prayer
was offered and Ibecummlttee apiiolnted
lo wait on the President bad reported.
Senator Vilas reported on j art of tLc&e
scntlemen. He bore the message of the
President's "respectful Animations," aid
the Senate smiled. The mi!e m i n dlsap
peared, fur the reading of the n.esage
began.
'tne rceouimcudation lo retire green
back and Treasury notes was cxK.tted
It Is not known wtut aetlon the Uepjbli
eaus will take on this. They are divided.
Tticre Is a strong senliiucnt fur the green
backs. They Saved the country in its time
of iierll.
"Oreeubaeks are not djngerous under
Republican rule," wild .i Kcn.itor. "They
arego. id money when we lure the Im lance of
trade hi our favor, when ciiMoiunare coming
hi, and there Is no deruienLy In revenues.
So long as Imports do not exceed exports
greenbacks are all right.
fne gold-reserve eouidu't help but go
down under a Democratic inlnilnlstralli.il.
When we are buying more than i e lire sill
ing gold must go abroad, and v. lien we
siend more than we make the reserve must
dwindle. There will be little trouble on
Treasury notes but greenbacks will not
go without a flgblt."
t STRONGEST MOVE MADE.
The recommendation on Venezuela is
looked on as the strongest move it made
In foreign affairs by this Administration.
It is thought the President Is trying to re
trieve his blunder in the Hawaiian episode.
Republicans say he will racctwllli a hearty
support In any reasonable action he may
take on "Venezuelan arralrs. Great Britain.
Ihcy hold, la too greedy, and it is time to
tall a halt.
. There will be no difficulty in securing an
appropriation for an Alankan conimitolou
If it 1 accompanied with some such utter
ance as In the Venezuelan question.
The Jeding in favor of Cuba is so strong
that bis recommendation of continued neu
trality fell flat, lathe HouteSpeakcrUced
will choose his man to present a resolution
sympathizing with Cuba. In the Senate
action can be looked for at most any time.
The recommendation to appropriate
S-TJS.OOO to pay Bering Sea damages was
not received with the best of grace. The last
Congress refused to pay the bill. This Con
gress may do the, same thing. There is a
large opinio n that these claims arc of no ac
count. HlsTecotrirncnciation on the padrone sys
tem is held to be a bid for liopular support.
The Republicans say the President wants
togctlnoulortberain. His entire message
lsuiougbl lb be more conciliatory tnan any
be ever wrote. Ho seems unxious to please
public opinion.

"" "" Pension Checks.

has'lnlil aside Si 0,000 for the convenience
of all persons drawing pension checks who
with to get them cashed. Anyone is wel
come to go there and get their checks

Klackwnll Tnnnel.
The uoder-water section of the Blackwall
tnnnel under the Thames has Just been fin
ished, tbe occasion being celebrated hy a
lunch In the tunnel Itself, to which 2,000
persons sat down.
The tunnel connects Greenwich on the
sooth side or the river with Poplar on the
north, and is Just errer a mile in length.
Three thousand nine hundred and sixty-four
feet had to be driven by ceimprcssed air.
Or this length 1 ,200 feet on tbe north bank
remains to be done, so that the tunnel will
not bejipen for traffic until the spring of
1897.
It was begun in March, 1892. While
driving the shield under tV river bed, at
one time only five feet two Inches of gravel
intervened between the top of the tunnel
and the water, and loads of clay were
dumped into tbe river tu prevent tbe water
from bursting through.
Tbe diameter of the tunnel Is twenty
seven feet, six feet-more tban that or the
St. Clair tunnel, hitherto tbe largest ever
built.
