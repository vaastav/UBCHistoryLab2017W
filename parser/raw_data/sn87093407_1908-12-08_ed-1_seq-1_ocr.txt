How far op In th« ros!«r of (ir«a|
Northern railway officials Is th«
Root .tinmlon committee goto*
to reach?
li thin- aovthlnit In the bands
of those who hold the Gordon let*
• tera and documents Implicatlsß oth

than General Counsel H«>Kg?
Apparently reliable information
given to The Star Indicates that
President Lnuls W. Hill knows
something of the Gordon Root trans
actions, ana that there are tetters
In existence tending to substantiate
this statement
Kept a Secret.
ljut Tuesday night, when the
Root Investigation committee wa«
In session in Spokane, President
Mil! arrived In that city on bis ap*
clal car on the delayed 6: IS train,
reaching Spokane at 7: JO. Every
J effort M-.m.-.l to be mad- to k*«p
his •M-ncc in Spokane a secret.
jTb« train was met by U. C. Gilman,
jgenrnil western counsel of the
Great Northern. After a. •••nfvreaeat
with President Hill, Mr. Oilman re
j turned to the Spokane hotel, where
th* committee was In session, and
was for some -...- closeted with th>«
committee.
I. - Couldn't Reach Him.
Couldn't Reach Him.
Efforts of the one or two now*.
spsp<»rmen who knew of President
f Hill's presence In Spokane to reach
< him wer»« fruitless, and no : on*
;aside fpun Mr. Gllmsin and other
local officials of the Great North
ern spoke »lin him daring his stay.,
He remained In Spokane only a tew
hours, going north on the Spokane
VuV.% A Northern road.
Today the Root Investigation com
mittee Is holding Its first session
In Seattle, and this morning Presi
dent Hill arrived In this city. Thl»
morning hi- was in conference will)
Mr. Gltman.
Oilman Is Helping.
If Mr. Hill has had anything to
lay before the committee It has
probably •en transmitted through
Mr. Glhnan, who has apparently
! txen <lolnic all in his power to aid
the committee In Its work. It was
Gilman who went with the mem
bers of the committee to the of flea
of the Great Northern western
|eoMM*)l In Spokane and secured the
private correspondence note books
of Judge Gordon while ho was In
that office, which Dots book* are
said to have been of great assist
ance to the committee.
People familiar with the situation
In the Great Northern general of
fices In 81. Paul are of the opinion
that General Counsel IVc;;. who is
implicated by the correspondence
held by Gordon, would be unlikely
to do anything of as ecrlous a na
ture as I* charged attain*) him with
out consulting President Hill, who
Is not alono his superior in the
Great Northern service, but is ftlsq
a close personal friend.
In College Together.
Hill and H.■«« were voting men
tosHhrr In college. Hill sent for
He:; to come to St. Paul and gave
him ft loMltion in the Great North
ern local department that permit
ted htm to attend the law school
of the University of Minnesota.
After Ills graduation he was «d
--vanced by easy gtagca until, short
ly after I .mils Hill became president
of the Great Northern, his boyhood
j friend IU-kjc wus made general coun
|m.<l. They have nlw&ys continued

Correspondence which Is wild to

into this . Gordon.Root-supremo
court affair—nnd not In connection
With the Harris en»e —Is reported,
to bo now iv the hnuds of Gordon's -

to save him from prosecution at
Hi. hands of the Great Northern.
Sullivan Has Them. '
