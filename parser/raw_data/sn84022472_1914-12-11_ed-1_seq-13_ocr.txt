7 IN LONDON DECREASED
(Correspondence of Associated Press.)
, London, Dec 11.- There is now less
unemployment among male workers
than there was before the war, due
largely to the vacancies created in the
industrial ranks by those who have
joined the- fighting- forces. ' But there
has -been a very great increase of un
employment among women. In Lon
don alone. 10,406 registrred with the
Central Body in the last four months
as needing employment. In the same1
period last year only 586 were reg
istered. . Among dressmakers, mil
liners, laundresses " and ' charwomen
distress Is keenest." For tils relief of
unemployed ' workwomen 1 twenty-two
workrooms- have been opened- In as
many London- boroughs and they are
under the control 'of the Central Un
employed Body. It is estimated that
the cost p"f running them will be
$509,000 a year. Of this $320,000 will
le provided out of the queen's fund
the balance being met by grants jfrom
the local government boards. '

POLAND INVASION
LOSING STRENGTH
Petrograd, Dec 11 The attack of th
Austro-German army In Poland ap
pears to have lost its impetus with
the exception of General MacKenzjen's
army which is unofficially reported
between Lowicz and Warsaw and only
about -15 miles from the Polish capi
tal.
The other armies are advancing but
little if any and the attempt from
the south of " Cracow seems entirely
repulsed, according to reports. Neith
er the siege of Cracow nor of Przemysl
has been relieved, t is stated, which
was the main aim of the Austro-Ger
man offensive. " '
'The situation now ' appears to hinge
on the Russian or German ability to-
rush in reinforcements first since four
weeks of incessent and hard fighting
has told severely on both sides.1 - -

GERMANS FEED SOLDIERS
AND SEND GRAIN TO HOMES
FROM FRANCE WHEAT FIELD
Headquarters of a certain German
army in France, Dec 11 Forwarded
by automobile courier to Berlin, thence
to London, 4:11 a. m. A correspondent
of the Associated Press spending a
week in the field - of operations, also
has been the guest of Gtenerals Von
BTeringen, formerly war minister and
now commanding, the Seventh army;
Von Zwehl, the capturer of Maubauge.
and "Von Etmich, the conqueror of Liege
and Namur.
Several hours ' were spent in the
trenches in the picturesque old . town
where German ' riflemen and : French
leglonaires plan and . play grim ' prac
tical -jokes on each other from posi
tions a scant 100 yards apart. A race
of German trogoldytes was found In
one place on this- front ' Men, horses,
supplies, hospitals and so forth, were
housed ' in hillside caverns, - formerly
stone quarries which were absolutely
protected by a 60 foot stone roof fiom,
even ".the most powerful shellfire. The
morning-- was passed in an artillery
observation stand , opposite Rheims
where - a powerful telescope -by means'
of which -the , fire of the artillery Is
directed, brought "the observer within
100 yards of - the city and the cathedral
and enabled him to see that the cathe
dral and "its towers were standing fair
ly intactT although blackened by Ore."
A trip o inspection was made
through, a; labyrinth of ; fortifications
and approaches all along the Aisne at
its nearest; point to Paris, where the
lines are normal two or three hun
dred yards apart. -- The soldiers are
well supplied with blankets, food, wat
er and clothing and are in good spir
its despite their long residence in the
trenches. Desultory mf antry fire . Is
always in progress and machine guns
break out now and then. Artillery
on .both sides has thrown tons otf
iron but there have been 'no great
fights lny this section, of the front.
Of all of the Impressions of the trip
one of the . most striking is that left
by the countless stacks of -unthresfaed
grain .stretching for miles in every
direction throughout this granary of
northern France. Over a hundred
German threshing machines, the larg
est size, are working in the region

cannon. The army Is not only 11-rmg-on
the supplies of flour and meat de

but is actually sending wheat and flour !
back to Germany.
The German soldier at the front is j
smiling and well fed' as he has one '
more meal daily than in peace times.
The lean greyhounds seen after the
dash on' Paris are again rounded out i
into portly Germans. i
The normal' soldier at the front does ,'
not sing as much as formerly partly !
perhaps because he has song himself
out and partly because the singing is
at to draw the enemy's fire, but he la
neither discouraged nor exhausted. ,
There is . no indication whatever that J,
his nerves are breaking ' under the
strain of the protracted war, .:
No trip to the front would be aom- i
plete without a visit to the hospital. J
Health conditions are remarkably -?
good, the surgeons state, even better
than In peace times. There , has been I
considerable typhoid but this la now;
