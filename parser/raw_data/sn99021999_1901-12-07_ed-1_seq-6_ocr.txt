AN EMEUaEXCV THAT MUST HB MET.
The constitution of Nebraska limits
the stnte Indebtedness to $100,000 and
this limit Is not to bo exceeded ueept
for repelling Invasion, suppressing In
surrection or defending the stnte In war.
Instead of keeping the .debt within the
constitutional bounds every succeeding
legislature hus nindo appropriations
largely In excess of the Income, nnd the
aggregate liabilities of the state have
been growing until they have "reached
enormous proportions.
It was thought that high water mark
was reached at the close of tho second
term of Treasurer Hartley, when by his
peculiar financiering the outstanding Interest-bearing
state warrants were
raised above $1,000,000. Hut according
to the semi-annual report of Stnte
Auditor Weston, Just made public, the
total of outstanding warrants December
I." 1001, was $2,llK!,o:n.:i2. Of this co
lossal debt, while no exact figures are
available, It Is ktiow'n that between
$1,'J00,000 nnd $1,500,000 of these stnte
obligations nro held as part of tho In
vestment of the. permanent school fund.
While tho delinquent unpaid taxes, If
collectible, would perhaps pay off the
greater part of this debt, the fact re
mains that the state has overreached
tho debt limit fixed by the constitution
by fully $2,000,000, and the permanent
school fund, which Is supposed to rep
resent over $1,000,000 of nvnllablo as
sets, In reality represents moro than
$1,200,000 of liabilities which tho state
nnfst sooner or later meet, either by In
creased taxation or by the issue of fund
ing bonds.
It goes without snylng that tho tax
payers of Nebraska are not prepared for
the Imposition of $1,500,000 to $2,000,000
of additional taxes to meet the deficit In
the state treasury. On the othgr hand,
tho warrant Indebtedness cannot be
funded Into bonds without a constitu
tional amendment authorizing it. The
question that confronts us Is, Shnll the
state continue to pile up a mountain of
debt and pay premiums out of the school
fund on Its own warrants or shall It
pursue the only rational course left open
through the submission of the necessary
constitutional amendment?
Wo believe wo voice tho sentiment of
tho great mass of Nebraska taxpayers

that calls for decisive action.
FAVOltAULE HEl'UHT OA' TREATY,
The sennto committee on foreign re
lations having voted to favorably report
tho new lsthmlnu cnnnl treaty and to
urge Its early ratification, there Is
favornblo promise that It will soon be
disposed of, perhaps beforo the adjourn
ment of tho sennto for tho holiday re
cess. Two of the democratic members
of tho committee objected to tho neu
trality provision and to the clause re
lating to tho policing of the canal, but
they did not vote against tho treaty and
doubtless will not when It shnll come,
up for ratification.1 Indeed, they aro
said to have expressed themselves as
desirous that It be ratflled, so that there
may bo no more unnecessary delay lu
legislating for the great enterprise.
There nppears to bo no doubt, there
fore, that tho convention will be rati
fied and there certainly Is no sound
reason why it should not be. Tho neu
tralization principle which tho trenty
redognlzes Is us much in tho Interest of
tho United States ns of any other cduu-
try and It is manifestly absurd to argue
that It would place this country at a
disadvantage under any circumstances.
Tho Idea, also, that the clause relating
to the policing of the canal places a
limitation upon the power of this coun
try to absolutely control it Is without
force. Tho United Stntes has secured
In this treaty- all It nsked and there
ought to bo no question as to the duty
of ratifying It.
THE IMMlUItATlOX LAWS.
There appears to bo stroiig proba
bility of radical amendments to tho Im
migration laws. President Hoosovclt
said In his message that tho existing
laws are unsatisfactory and suggested
that there should be a comprehensive
law enacted to excludo believers in an
archistic principles or members of an
archistic societies, also persons of a low
moral tendency or of unsavory reputa
tion; to secure by careful educational
test "some Intelligent capacity to appre
ciate American institutions" and act
sanely as American citizens, and to ex
cludo all persons who aro below a cer
tain standard of economic fitness to
cuter our Industrial field as competitors
with American labor. Ho urged that
"there should bo proper proof of per
sonal capacity to earn nn American liv
ing and enough money to lnsuro a de
cent start under American ccmdltlons."
Senator Lodge "has again introduced
his Immigration bill, which he failed to
have pasSed. in the last congress, the
principal feature of which provides for
an educational test. Tho Massachusetts
senator, who it is understood will bo
tho chief representative1 of th,o admin
istration in tho senate, may bo expected
to push ids immigration bill and with
favorable chance of carrying It through.
Another bill relating to Immigration has
been Introduced by Senator IVnroso of
Pennsylvania, which contains the extra
ordinary provision for n duty of $11 per
head ou nil persons coming Into the
United States from foreign countries,
except thoso who are citizens of this
country or of Canada or Mexico. 'No
such prepostprous proposition ns this, It
is entirely safe to predict, will recelvo
serious consideration. It would not only
encounter the most vigorous protest
from European governments, lint such
legislation would create a bitter hns
tlllty to tho United States of tho people
of South and Central America, whose
friendship nnd trade wo are most
anxious to cultivate.
It Is thus evident that tho linmlgra
lion question Is again to become proml
nent In tho nttentlon of congress and
tho dnuger Is that somo foolish or un
necessnry legislation will be enacted
that will prove jt future detriment.
Thero was a considerable Incronso In
Immigration during the past year and
this fact hus caused u renewal of the
demand for making the law more re
strictive, though It does not appear that
this Immigration lias been an injury
to any Interest.
UECEVTIOX OF THE MESSAOE.
Hnrely has a president's messnco been
received with such general and cordial
commendation ns has been accorded
President Itoosevelt's first communica
tion to congress. Tho leading news
papers of tho country, Including those
which aro not favorable to republican
policies, hnve spoken In terms of praise
of tho original character and the fine
literary stylo of the message, as well ns
of Its clear and strong treatment of the
subjects discussed anil Its elevated and
patriotic tone. Hepubllcnu statesmen
have spoken of It as a most statesman
like pnper-Msiso, conservative and
having the characteristic directness
and earnestness of Its author. Those
who feared that the message
would contain some radical ut
terances that might prove disturbing,
politically or otherwise, have been grati
fied that there Is nothing of this kind lu
If, while at the same time It conveys
the assurance that tho president enn be
relied upon to protect and maintain, to
tho extent of his authority, American
rights and interests everywhere. It was
of course Inevitable that there would be
some criticism of so Important n state
paper. The vigorous advocacy of
republican principles nnd policies could
not escape adverse comment ou the part
of tho opposition. Hut this- has been
for the most part moderate In tone.
The message has made ns favoroble
an Impression nbroad as at home. The
comments of the London press are gen
erally appreciative and In some In
stances warmly commendatory. The
references In the message to foreign af
fairs are regarded as showing an excel
lent spirit. "There Is nothing In the
message," commented the London
Standard, "that Is revolutionary, noth
ing to alarm property owners or to dis
turb tho Innnte American respect for
tho sanctity of Individual rights and
nothing that need In tho smallest degree
excite anxiety or apprehension abroad."
nother paper observes that the refer
ences to trusts nnd reciprocity coutnln
nothing that is calculated to Increase
the European dread, but that on the
contrary the president says much which
should help to diminish that Inllnltely
exaggerated panic. Tho London Times
describes the message as "distinguished
by clearness, firmness nnd reserved
strength, which do not require tho aid
of rhetorical pyrotechnics or populnr
platitudes."
It Is certainly a most notable success
thnt President Itoosevelt has achieved
at the beginning of his administration
in having his first communication to
congress, dealing with questions of great
national and International Importance,
so genernlly and heartily approved at
home and abroad. It Is n most aus
picious start for the administration
upon which tho president nnd tho" coun
try aro to be warmly congratulated.
Tho American peoplo nro warranted in
feeling that they have nt the head of
tho government a wise nud safe execu
tive, who understands tho country's
needs, who will respect the popular will
as did his lamented predecessor nud
who in nil his feelings nud aspirations
Is thoroughly American. Popular con
fidence In President Itoosevelt has been
greatly strengthened by his nblo and
statesmanlike message.
Tho fight Is now on between the live
stock men nnd the dairymen. The dairy
men Insist thnt all-artificial butter shall
be taxed out of existence, but they want
to reserve to themselves the privilege to
unload stale cow products re-worked and
disguised in attractive colors. On the
other hand, tho live stock men want to
supply the constantly Increasing demand
for butter by substitutes made out of
fats and oils which are certified to as
healthful and equally nutritious ns tho
dairy product and can bo supplied to
consumers at lower prices. In tills
struggle between the dairymen and the
cattle raisers tho average Nebraska
farmer can look ou with equanimity. If
tho dairymen have their way ho will got
u higher price for his milk; if the live
stock men win he will get n better price
tor his meat. It Is different, however,
with tho muss of peoplo who have
neither cows to milk or steers to mar
ket. Their Interest lies In competition.
When tho legislature of 1895 In viola
tion of all precedent took tho power to
appoint a fire and politic board for met
ropolitan cities from Governor Holcomb
and conferred It upon an appointing
board, In which the attorney general and
land commissioner constituted tho con
trolling majority, the World-Herald was
highly gratified. Now that municipal
homo rule, which thnt paper has been
pretending to advocate, has been
knocked lu tho head by the decision In
tho Itedell caso and the appointing
power exercised by tho mayor nnd coun
cil under two former decisions ngaln
transferred to tho governor, tho World
Herald exhibits now gratification. When
It comes to a question of principle the
double-ender organ can change Its col
ors as often ns a chameleon.

Stories of the Increasing distress among
tho working population of Germany con
tinue to be renorted from all sources. Tho
lack of employment Is being felt moro nnd
moro severely week by week. Dr. I round
who Is tho chairman of a commlttco repre
senting tho different German labor bureaus
Is In favor of a resolution providing that
work shall bo given to natives only, which
would rnlso tho Immigration question In nn
acuta slinue. It oppears that Russians
Crontlans and Italians are largely em
ployed as navvies, In tho construction, for
example, of tho Teltow canal, nt tho very
gates of Uerlln. Dr. l'rcund has directed
tho attention of tho Prussian ministers of

circumstance nnd hns also recommended
thnt facilities bo given for tho return to
their homes of thoso who have moro re
cently migrated from n dlstnnco to Ilcrlln
nnd other cities In tho liopo of finding work
In spite of the stntlstlcs of tho unemployed
which, on tho lowest estimate, bear witness
to a very serious stnto of affairs, Dr,
Freitnd does not admit the cxlstenco of
ncutc distress nt present, but confesses
that thero are serious grounds for nnxlety
with regard to the Immediate futuro. Tho
gcucral trade depression Is already affect
lug tho lower middle classes, who have con
tracted habits of unwonted cxtrnvaganco
during tho golden period of prosperity, nnd
tho papers arc beginning to preach about
tho evils of luxury and to ndvpeato a ro
turn to tho old German traditions of sim

During tho nctlve movements of tho

when It was decided permanently to occupy

tion of rcvlctunllng tho garrisons thero as
mimed tho utmost Importance owing to tho
expense nnd waste. At first it was decided
to employ requisitioned convoyB, the
ramels being pnld for nt tho rata of .1
francs per day, with liability for tho full
value of tho benst In enso of death. Rut
this was nn cxponslvo operation, ns tho
mortality, natural arid, It is alleged, de
signed, amounted to nearly 40 per cent,
which not only meant that tho government
must indemnify tho owners for tho loss of
their animals, but loso tho stores they
wero bearing ns well. Tho Algerian ad

In the recent trlnl of Polish students nt
Poscn, which euded lu tho sentencing of

tho attainment of this object would Involve
tho detnehment of districts thnt wero for
merly Polish from their present nlleglnnco
to Prussia and to tho German empire, tho
operations of tho league, of course, wero
treasonable. The court based its conclu
sion on tho fact thnt n so-called "Polish
notional treasure" existed in Rnpperswyl,
toward which contributions wero collected
from Polish students. It assumed for the
benefit of tho accused that they wero Ig
norant of tho ultimate alms of tho league,
and accepted their explanation that thoy
considered Its object to bo the promotion
of a Polish national sentiment. Tho plea
thnt It was merely In order to ovoid at
tracting the attention of tho Russian au
thorities that secrecy had been observed In
tho conduct of tho lenguo and of the so
cieties dependent on It wrs not considered
valid. Secret societies nro forbidden by
Prussian law If their object relates In any
way to public affairs, and It was clear from
tho'ovldcnco that tho soclotles to which tho
accused belonged camo undor this prohibi
tion. Prominent Gorman newspapers np-
provo tho action of tho authorities ond it
Is plain that tho Polish question Is begin

They say that tho Poles must not be al

At tho trial of the two editors of the
Stuttgart Rcobachter, who were prosecuted
for libeling tho German troops In China,
Lieutenant General von Leascl, who com
manded tho German forces In Chi LI, de
clared In his evldcnco that although de
fenseless persons, such ns old peoplo,
women and children, wero killed It was
owing to their being mistaken In their
Chlncso dress for men. He further ad
mitted that on order had been Issued ac
cording to which It was permissible to
shoot any coolies who might bo found out
sldo their quarters after 9 o'clock at night.
After roundly denying that tho 'Ocrman
troops had over been guilty of murder, ptl
lago or robbory, General von Lossel refused
to answer, "from feelings of esprit do
corps," tho question as to whothor soldiers
of other nations who wero represented in
China could bo accused of BUch crimes. In
answer to a further question ho admitted
that in ten or twclvo cases excesses had
been brought to light, but asserted that the
guilty soldiers had been severely punished
and were now confined In tho fortress
prUon In Cologne. Tho defense was handi
capped by not being ablo to obtain proper
witnesses.
As has nlroadv been announced by cable,
the .International sugar conferonco will bo-
gln In llrussels December 10, where will uo
represented England, Germany, Roumanla,
Russia, Ilelglum, Italy, Austria, Holland,
Franco and Spain. At tho conference of
1898 tho congress did not havo tho desired
result through tho difficulty of coming to
rmn with thn Krcnch nnd Russian dele
gates and thn members separated doputlng
the Belgian government to prepare inu way
for an International treaty on tuo hudjcci
through direct diplomatic negotiations, and
it Is as a rosult of theso negotiations that
tho forthcoming conforenco has been ar
ranged. The actual situation of tho sugar
market Is characterized hy a surplus pro
duction. Tho stocks of sugar in j;urope
and Ncrth America, as well as floating car
irniH. nrn much moro considerable than thoy
wero a year ago, for thoy attain a total of
800,018 tons, against 559,823 tons last year.
On tho other hand, extremely low prices
aro quoted. Tho cano sugar of tho West
Indies, It 1 said, suffers most from this
fact, for It does not onjoy the compensating
bounty of beet sugar. As far as Franco Is
concerned, the first nlno months of this
year show a deficit of 28.000.000 francs on
tho score of sugar, and this is subject to
taxation, being ono of France's main Indus
tries. Hut, Instead of tho government tax
ing tho manufactured article, It taxes the
amount of sugar which It considers tho
beetroot ought to yield. Every hundred
kilograms of beetroot sent to tho factory
is supposed to produce soven and three
quarters kilograms of sugar, and Is taxed
accordingly. Therefore, s Ut usually the

Whntover wo think of tho deelslors It Is

Tho second Dooley caso emphasizes this
dlsquletthg aspect of tho decisions. It will
be remembered that In tho cases decided
ast May different judges reached similar
conclusions by different courses of reason

second Dooley caso on tho ground that It Is

tho scalo agnlnst them, dcclnrcn the deci

duties.
A very useful servlco Is rendered by
Chlof Justtco Fuller In correcting tho popu

concerning that Is worth repoating. In tho
