MM GOAL MINERS KILLED
Gas- Explosion Wrought De
struction at Carbonado.
CAUSE SHROUDED IN MYSTERY
Deadly Blackdamp Followed the Ex
plosion, hut the Mine Was Easily
Ventilated List of the Dead.
Tacoma, Deo. 12. A mine explosion
at Carbonado, 40 miles easterly from
Tacoma, at 11 o'clock this morning,
killed 82 men. Identification of the
dead men is. almost impossible. The
scraps of clothing that still cling to the
bodies of the men are . carefully ' pre
served, laid aside and labelled to aid in
the- identification. Frenzied relatives
of tie missing men . gathered at the
mouth of the mine and watched eagerly
to catch a glimpse of the forms as they
were hurried by to the coroner's office.
"The work of rescue is being rushed
forward, but it may be days before the
last blackened form is taken from the
mine, for many men are believed to lie
buried under masses of earth and rock.
To extricate them will take time, and
thus far the work of rescue has been
pushed forward at the extreme endur
ance of the workers, for the black
damp and noxious gases have driven
the rescuers back repeatedly.
When the explosion occurred a rush
of the inhabitants was made in the di
rection of the mouth of the tunnel.
Women, the wives of the men supposed
to be in the shift, ran to and fro,
screaming and wringing their hands
with anguish, crying children clinging
to their skirts. A .
It was all that D. T. Davies the
superintendent of the mine, could dc
to stop the wives and friends of th
doomed miners from plunging madly
into the tunnel's mouth. : '
A revised death list follows:
Company ' men Leonard Johnson,
Henry Soni, Matt Rehela and Victor
Ruhinaki (formerly given as John Hill)
all Finns; Michael Kichinko, John
Mellon and Andrew Gecey, Poles;
John H. Jones, David X. Thomas,
Howell Meredith, sr-, Watkin Jones,
Evan M. Lewis, Daniel Davis and Rees
Jones, all Welsh; William Wilson,
Joseph Lee and Richard Dare, Amer
icans, and Ben Zeidler, jr., German.
' Contract . miners August ; Hainut
and Emil Hainut, Belgians; Paul Cur
tiss, Adam Pavoll, John Flota and
Stephen Kraunoga, Poles; Ben Zeidler,
sr., Germans; Matt Nuland and Jacob
Lands, Finns. The cause of the ex
plosion is a mystery to every one.
Only safety lamps are worn when at
work. Governor Rogers will con
duct a searching examination as to the
cause of the explosion. He has tele
graphed State Mine Inspector Owens,
now at Spokane, to attend the inquest
and examine witnesses himself. The
question of the ventilation of the mine,
in conformity with the state law, will
be thoroughly gone into.
The total number of men in the un
fortunate shift was 76, of whom 44 are
alive, all of them having escaped or
been rescued. .
The mines are owned by the Carbon
Hill Coal Company. They give work
to 400 men, and have an output of 300,
000 tons annually, and are situated 40
miles from Tacoma, on the Cascade
division of the Northern Pacific. The
mines are in a deep ravine, through
which the Carbon river flows. : The
mines are supplied, with every appli
ance for safety. They are largely tun
neled, and the tunnels are so big that
locomotives are run into them.
In 1890 an explosion at this same
mine cost two lives, and John Hartman
and some others were severely burned.

THE DEBATE OPENED.
House Takes Up 'Consideration of the
. Currency Bill.
? Washington, Deo. 13. The feature
of. the opening day of the debate on the
currency bill in the house was the
speech of Dolhver of Iowa. It was
characterized by all the wit and elo
quence for which the Iowan ". is noted,
and held the members, without regard
to party, for more than an hour. Dol
liver declared that the least "doubt in
the Republican party as to the wisdom
of enacting the gold-standard law had
been removed by the experience of the
business world during the past three
years. He scored Mr. Bryan and gen
erally ridiculed the alleged false pro
phecies of the Democrats in 1896. -
DeArmond of Missouri was the
heavy gun on the Democratic side. He
warned the Republicans from the West
that they could not deceive their con
stituents in the coming congressional
elections by claiming that they had
yielded to the wisdom of their col
leagues in caucus. Overstreet of In
diana opened the debate in support of
the bill, and Maddox of Georgia re
plied to him.
McClellan of New York was the only
other speaker today. - He announced
his opposition to the bill on the ground
that it would contract the currency,
extinguish bank notes and enhance the
value of coin bonds. He appealed to
those of his Democratic colleagues from
New York who it is reported intend to
vote for the bill not to do so.
lighthouses for Alaska.
After a conference with the chief of
the lighthouse board, Representative
Cushman of Washington has concluded
to introduce a bill appropriating $500,
000 for the erection of suitable light
houses and signals along the Alaskan
coast. While this sum will not begin
to supply a sufficient number of aids
to navigation, it will be a starter, and
it is hoped that further appropriations
will follow. Mr. Cushman intends to
insert a provision in the bill ' making
the Alaskan coast, together with the
Puget sound shore, from Cape Flattery,
around to the boundary line, a sepa
rate lighthouse district, to be known as
district No. 17.
Sympathy for the Boers.
Washington, Dec. 13. An appeal by
Mason for an expression of sympathy
for the Transvaal republic in its war
with Great Britain was the feature of
the senate proceedings today. It was
the first formal address delivered in
the senate this session, and was listened
to with thoughtful attention by both
the members and by a large gallery of
auditors. The resolution upon which
Mason based his address was referred
to the foreign relations committee.
Lodge, considering it too delicate a
question in view of the position of this
government to pass upon without seri
ous consideration. No business of im
portance was transacted by the senate.

BATTERIES SAVED GATACRE
His Artillery Arrived in the
Nick of Time.
fAS TREACHEROUSLY GUIDED
British Set at an Impossible Task and
Against Superior Numbers Opinions
of the Press England Depressed.
London, Dec. 13. Later details re
garding the disaster to General Gat
acre's column show that but for the
magnificent work of the British artil
lery the disaster would; have been far
more extensive, as the incessant Boer
fire in the midst of . repulsed infantry
ultimately led to disorder, which only
escaped developing into rout through
the batteries of artillery occupying suc
cessive positions, covering the- retreat,
thus drawing a portion of the Boer's
galling fire.
Apparently, the British were set at
an impossible task, and were treacher
ously guided. After a trying march
and being under arms 16 hours, they
attacked the wrong part of the Boer po
sition, where the hill was impregnable,
and the burghers were estimated to
number 6,000 men instead of 500, as
spies.had reported. There is little in
the story to mitigate the immense hu
miliation caused by the episode, which
as almost 'an exact counterpart of the
battle of Nicholson's Nek. The war
office was besieged by anxious relatives
today, and successive editions, of the
newspapers were . eagerly scanned.
Men and women are equally persistent
in pleading for information, but the
authorities either do not possess any,
or are not prepared to publish it at
present.
The affair has caused a most de
pressing influence everywhere, not ex
cepting the stock exchange, where
consols were at the lowest price in
many years, and South African securi
ties slumped, not so much on account
of the military reverse, which is re
trievable, but owing to profound appre
hension as to its political effect. No
great surprise would now be felt in
Cape Colony's becoming aflame from
end to end.
ENGLAND IS DEPRESSED.
London Papers All Regard the Defeat
as a Most Serious One.
London, Dec. -13. Discussing the
defeat of General Gatacre at Storm
berg, the Daily Mail says:
"Quite apart from the loss of 600
fighting men, the unexpeted Boer suc
cess will probably cause a more gen
eral and serious movement among the
Cape Dutch. The government must
promptly face this by the immediate
dispatch of further troops."
The Daily News says: "The reverse
General Gatacre has suffered is a sadly
emphatic commentary on the. peculiar
difficulty of military operations in a
semi-disaffected country. The en
emy's spies are everywhere, and no
where can we rely confidently on any
counter information. General Gatacre
seems to have been completely trapped.
Of course he will immediately be rein
forced." '
The Daily Chronicle says: "There
is only too much reason for fear that
this is the worst illustration we have
had yet of inadequate equipment and
insufficient scouting. How far this
disaster was due to lack of judgment
on the spot and how far to lack of ar
tillery is not quite clear, but the pa
tient public cannot help reading that
General Methuen's victory at Modder
river was won by artillery reinforce
ment at the critical moment, and all
they would like to know is how many
times this particular lesson is to be
learned." ':
, The Standard says: "The event is in
the highest degree deplorable. It
will tell against us unfavorably in the
Free State, among the colonial Dutch
and even among the natives. A great
deal of evidence has been accumulat
ing during the past weeks to show how
deeply the colony, or at least the north
ern and western portions of it, are
honeycombed by dissatisfaction. . Our
generals have to cope with a rebel col
ony as well as hostile republics, and
must take measures to lay their plans
in accordance with the details."
-SHERMAN REGRETS, v
Says the President's Phillplne Policy Is
. Wrong. , ' :
Philadelphia, Deo. 18. In response
to an invtation to attend an anti-imperialist
mass meeting to be held at the
Academy of Music,, on the centennial
anniversary of the death of Washing
ton, December 4, the following letter
has been received from ex-Secretary of
State John Sherman, dated at Washing
ton: .
"1 have a strong conviction that the
president erred in sending soldiers to
the Philippines to take possession of
their country. The United States had
wisely, as I think,: assisted the Fili
pinos in driving the Spaniards out of
the Philippine islands, and should, : I
think, have aided them in . protecting
their country against all assaults. He
no doubt was advised to adopt the
measures taken, and all I can do is tq.
express my regrets. Yours very truly,
"JOHN SHERMAN." .

NO HESITANCY IN TRADE.
Usual Shrinkage at End or the Kea.
Not Apparent.
R. G. Dun & Co. 's weekly review of
trade says: The approach of a new
year usually brings so much of hesi
tancy in business that the small shrink
age this year is surprising. Probably
never before have the productive forces
of the country been so largely covered
by contracts at this date, inducing
employment and profit far into the
coming year. This results not from
any mere speculative excitement, but
from actual demands for consumption
running far beyond the producing ca
pacity hereafter, and pushing it to re
markable expansion. The increase in
foreign trade has been significant, com
pared with the increase of $24,000,000
in payments through clearing-houses.
For the week the payments have been
20.3 per cent larger than last year, and
88.1 per cent larger than in 1892.
Demand for cars and other railway
equipment is enormous, and alsb for
shipping, both lake and ocean. Tin is
weak at, 2740, and copper declined to
16o, ' but lead and spelter are
stronger.
Wool has advanced further, with
much speculative buying, though most
manufacturers have supplied wants for
the present, and are less disposed to
purchase at - prices now averaging
higher than at any time since June 15,
1891.
Wheat has risen 8c, and corn a frac
tion, with a decline in Western re
ceipts of both. Atlantic exports of
wheat this week, flour included, were
only 3,859,667 bushels, against 5,636,
767 last year, and Pacific exports 886,
172 bushels, against 556,523 bushels
last year.
. Failures for the week have been 221
in the United States, against 248 last
year, and 33 in Canada, against 22 last
year. . --
