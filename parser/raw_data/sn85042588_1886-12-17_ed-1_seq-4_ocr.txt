THE report of the Dakota railroad com­
mission for the year ending Jane 30,1886,
iB now in press. The report shows an in­
crease in the railroad mileage of 551 miles,
making the total of completed road 2,897.
Begarding the regulation of elevators the
report says:
The provision of law compelling trans­
portation companies to allow shipment of
grain in car-load lots was a great relief
from the actions of the elevator pools and
had beneficient results. But the influence
of this law is circumscribed by existing reg­
ulations of railroad and' elevator com­
panies. Elevator companies should be
compelled to deliver the storage wheat on
demand on surrender of receipts. In this
event storage receipts would be negotiable
and the farmer thus could send them to any
place for sale and be relieved of the
necessity of accepting the price of the
local dealer. There are in Dakota 344
elevators and 306 warehouses, hav­
ing the aggregate capacity of 18,
843,000 bushels. Of these there are
in North Dakota 200 elevators, 64 ware­
houses, 9,012,000 bushels, and in South Da­
kota 188 elevators, 252 warehouses, and
4^81,600 bushels. Among the recommend­
ations are the following: That the law re­
quiring railroad companies to make annual
reports to the commissioners, be amended
so as to include telegraph, telephone, ex­
press and sleeping car companies that the
'transit system" be prohibited in Dakota
unless accompanied by an option to the
shipper to ship at a "pro rata'' local rate,
or unless the carrier guarantees to redeem
transit tickets at par: that .the commission­
ers be authorized to bring suit against any
ublic corporations over which they have
to enforce aright or to correct
any abuse that all elevator^, warehouses
and storehouses wherein grain shall be re­
ceived from the public for storage or ship
meritfbe declared public warehouses, and
owners or proprietors be required to give
bond and be licensed by the territory, and
that all grain tickets aud receipts therefor
he made and issued in form negotiable.
!urisdiction
HON. Louis K. CHURCH, associate jus­
tice of the Dakota supreme court, has
been appointed governor of this territory.
In the New York Hegislature three years
ago, President Cleveland, then governor
of that great state, had a warm and con­
stant friend Judge Church. That
friendship contributed to the making of
Cleveland president of the United States
—it made Louis K. Church an associate
justice and now it culminates in his be­
coming governor of Dakota. Judge
Church is only 39 years of age and will
be the youngest governor Dakota has ever
had—a fact that will extend rather than
decrease his popularity. As judge he has
given entire satisfaction in his district
and has kept aloof from all sectional
strife. His judicial training will be of
great service to him in dealing with, mat­
ters brought by the legislature and it can
be expected of him that he will give a
•wise and successful administration.
GOVJSHNOR PIERCE Bent the following
congratulatory message to the newly ap­
pointed governor last night:
Hon. L. K. Church, Huron, Dak.:
Please accept my congratulations and
kindest, wishes for an administration hon­
orable to yourself and successful to the
people of Dakota. GILBERT A.. PIEKCK.
Governor Pierce will deliver his mes­
sage and the reports of other territorial
officers to the legislature the first day of
its session and then turn the affairs of
state over to his successor.
IN the telegraphic reports from Wash­
ington Delegate Clifford speaks of Judge
Church not being a tyikotan. There
seems to be a difference of opinion on
this point. Judge Church, himself, has
repeatedly said that he was a Dakotan
to the core, had come out here to live,
liked it and, as the years rolled around,
would in due time become an old settler.
A CAB LOAD of coal from the new Dick­
inson mine has been sent to the Mandan
shops to be tested, and several car loads
have also been shipped to Bismarck for
trial. If it comes up to the expectations
of the operators of the mine, it will be­
come immensely as well as immediately
popular.
A COBBESPONDENT of the Chicago
Tribune says that Gresham, of Indiana,
and Roosvelt, of New York, will be the
ticket that will win in 1888, and the
other politicians may as well climb on
to the band wagon.
THE Steele Herald, a very complete
newspaper establishment, is for sale.
EditorjBritton, it is said, desires to go to
Canada.
THB Journal urges the people of Pierre
to meet the members-elect of the legisla­
ture from that district, and discuss the
matter of needed legislation. The Jour­
nal winds up a column editorial on the
•abject as follows: "This district does
not desire any more handioaps in the
•hape of a presiding offloo in the council
or a speakership in the house, but it
wants its, representatives to go to Bis­
marck unembarassed by political obliga­
tions, inspired solely by a determination
to work for the welfare of their constitu­
ents, and we are well enough acquainted
with our representatives to assure our
readers that this is exactly the line they
will pursue."
THE extremests in the South Dakota
"state" movement have- finally come to
the conclusion that seotion 32 in the con­
stitution adopted at Sioux Falls can be
abrogated without submitting the ques­
tion to a vote of the people- This seotion
restrains the setting in motion of the
state machinery until sanctioned by oon
gress. The Sioux Falls Press and some
other South Dakota papers, whose loyal­
ty to division and statehood cannot be
questioned, object to this sudden assump­
tion of authority by the radicals and be­
lieve, rightly too, that the cause will be
injured by suoh a move. Why this un­
willingness to submit questions of so
much importance to the people? It
doesn't matter how the northern seotion
of Dakota stands upon the subject of di­
vision that is not the question. They
simply want to be recognized as apart of
Dakota—a people who have paid half the
taxes in years gone by and done their
share to make Dakota prosper and the
name f^aous. They especially want
something to say about so important a
matter as the dividing of this ter­
ritory into two states. The question
never has been presented to them. They
may want it and they may not—a vote
will determine. They certainly do not
want division, if it means territorial vas­
salage for the northern half. So long as
Dakota is one territory all her citizens
have aright to be heard upon all ques­
tions of legislation affecting their pres­
ent or their future. The northern region
has had no voice whatever in the division
question. Human nature is the same the
world over people disregarded, who
ought to be recognized, are sure to be
dissatisfied. The people of the southern
part of the territory who have met, for­
mulated their constitution and resolved
for division have not asked anything for
the northern half. They have not asked
tor statehood for both Dakotas, but sim­
ply for division and admission of one
the southern—Dakota. It is not the
proper soheine for one-half of the people
of a commonwealth to assume to speak
and act for the whole. Let congress pass
an enabling act and the whole of Dakota
will vote upon it. The minority will sub­
mit gracefully to the majority.
THE government printing office at
Washington has turned out a number of
public documents lately that are fright­
ful examples of typographical inaccuracy.
The law has evidently been disregarded
in the selection of a public printer. Ster­
ling P. Bounds, who had to get out to
make room for a democrat and reform,
was one of the most practical printers in
the country. The "Rounds Printer's
Cabinet,"* as it was called, was a prefect
pictnre, typographically nothing to
equal it has ever been published.
Bounds knew a good printer by his
work, and had none others in the great
government establishment. The present
public printer is incompetent, and at
least one-third of the men he employs
are second-rate printers.
COL. WABKOOK, of the leading demo­
cratic daily of the territory, the James­
town Capital, in a recent interview with
Hon. E. A. Williams, expressed the opin­
ion that its some of the members of the
South Dakota state legislature were
elected members of the territorial legisla­
ture, it would be proper and appropriate
for the territorial legislature to refuse
them seats until they take an iron clad
oath, such as was required of members
of congress from the southern states in
the days of reconstruction.
HON. T. M. ELLIOTT, member-elect of
the next house from the Valley City dis­
trict, proposes to know what the people
want before coming to Bismarck. He
publishes an open letter to his constitu­
ents asking them for advice, particularly
on the following subjects: freight and
passenger rates, the readjustment of tax
laws, regarding the territory paying the
cost of killing animals inflicted with in­
curable diseases, the establishment of a
marriage license law, and any other legis­
lation that may be desired.
IT is hoped that congress will afford
Dakota's over-worked judges some relief
this winter. Two more judicial districts
should be established—four would be
better. No where in the United States
is so much required of the district
judges as in Dakota. In the interest of
justice and a long-suffering humanity,
congress ought to give relief.
ATTOBNEY GENEBAL ENOLB stumbled
onto another reporter in St. Paul while
on his way from Bismarck to Aberdeen,
but not with such disastrous results as
heretofore. Mr. Engle talked about the
new governor—thought he was a good
man—a good friend of his, and he saw
no reason why he Bhould not continue to
be attorney general.
THE TBIBUNE acknowledges the receipt
of an invitation to attend the "Dakota
Statehood Reception" at Huron this
week. No doubt Huron will entertain
her guests right royally.
A WASHINGTON dispatch of the Uth
contains the information that Congress­
man Springer has prepared another oom
bination in the Dakota admission ques­
tion. He now has a bill to admit New
Mexioo, Washington territory, Montana
and Dakota. If the Dakota question can­
not be disposed of on its meritp, it will,
perhaps, be just as well to remain a ter­
ritory a couple of years longer. It has
come to a pretty pass when 500,000 peo­
ple have to be tos9ed around and
"bunched" with the seventy-five or a
hundred thousand of some other terri­
tory in order to get justice.
THE poor fellow who gives a chattel
mortgage gives it because he needs the
money. He is willing to pay good in­
terest—and is usually accommodated to
this extent. If the poor man is not able
to pay the interest when it comes due,
nor the principal either, and the loan
agent is forced to sell the property, as he
has aright to do, then certainly the im­
poverished borrower needs all the money
he can get out of the sale. It is very
seldom that a chattel mortgage equals
the real value of the goods. Frequently
the mortgaged property is worth several
times the amount of the mortgage, but
how little is usually left for the bor­
rower after the eale. The money loaner
is satisfied to get his due and that is
about as far as he takes any interest in
the matter. Very few men attend a chat­
tel mortgage sale. Why? Because it is
only the lounger alxuit the side streets
and alleys who knows anything about
the sale. The notioes of the sale are
posted by the sheriff all right enough,
but a day's wind or storm comes and the
notices are gone. The day of the sale
arrives and the lawyer, the money-loaner
and the sheriff are there. That's all.
Property worth say $500 is bid in for the
face of the note—about $50 or $100 and
the expenses of the sale. No one knew
of the sale. Neighbors might have been
glad to have paid four or five times the
sum realized, if they had only known
about the sale. Nearly all in­
telligent farmers take and read .their
county paper. The notice of a chattel
mortgage sale ought to always appear in
print—where the sum loaned amounts to
over $50. The money loaner ought not
to oppose it, for he gets his money just
the same—and surer—and the debtor,
instead of losing everything, would get
the advantage of competing bids and
nine times out of ten realize something
besides liquidating a debt, whereas, un­
der the present law, this is an exception.
The law in relation to chattel mortgages
should be speedily changed. The "notices
should be published in newspapers circu­
lating among readers most likely to pur­
chase the articles offered for sale. This
is not a selfish desire on the part of the
newspapers—for the small fees there
would be in it for them—but in the inter­
est of justice to the disappointed and un­
fortunate debtor.
IN THE the state legislature, whioh
Governor Mellette called to meet at
Huron on the 15th inst., are sixteen
members who are also members-elect of
the territorial legislature which meets at
Bismarck on the 11th of January. Five
are in the council and eleven in the
lower house. Those in the council are:
E. C. Ericson, of Union county T. O.
Bogert, of Bon Homme F. R. Aikens,
of Lincoln John Cain, of Beadle, and
F. J. Washabaugh, of Lawrence. The
house members are: J. V. White, of
Clay J. P. Ward, of Turner F. A. Mor­
ris, of Hutchinson John Hobart,' of
Moody J. H. Patten, of Miner W. N.
Berry, of Clark John R. Dutch, of
Faulk A. S. Stewart, of Fall River S.
P. Wells, of Pennington J. D. Patton,
of Lawrence J. G. Jones, of Charles
Mix. George S. Cross, of Hyde, a mem­
ber of the lower houser is a member of
the constitutional convention. In view
of the fact that so many southern gentle­
men are members of both legislatures, it
might be well for the Huron organiza­
tion to adjourn to meet in Bismarck on
the 11th of January.
EX-GOVEBNOB PENNINGTON advises
the "state" makers at Huron to go ahead
and declare themselves. He says after
the state is declared it cannot be unmade,
and, in or out of the union, it will be a
state all the same, and it is a state, more
than the union the people want. Fortu­
nately for all Dakota, there are but few
such extremists as Mr. Pennington in
the south.
HURON proposes to make this a gala
week. District court is in session, the
constitutional convention meets on the
15th, the "state" legislature meets the
same day, the Dakota Press association
will hold forth, and now comes the infor­
mation that the fire department will give
a five days' fair.
THE. president's message has called
forth all manner of comment, but the
boldest assertion yet made is that of the
Sioux Falls Argus. It says every word
of it was written with the president's
own hand, which probably accounts for
the recent rheumatic affection.
A SOUTH DAKOTA fcaper—the Sioux
Falls Argus—is cruel enough to suggest
to the "state" legislature that among
legislative matters needing moBt urgent
attention is the enlargement of the Yank­
ton insane asylum.

rapidly by the Pullman management.
However, the sleeping car tariff does not
interest the masses so much as the rail­
road fare. The people of the northwest
will travel more—now that the fare has
been reduced—over the Northern Pa­
oifio.
THOSE FELLOWS down in the Yankton
Press and Dakotaian office are of a too
serious and anxious turn of mind to com­
prehend a joke. Recently Hon. E. A.
Williams and Colonel Warnook, of the
Jamestown Capital, met and in the ex­
change of gossip something was said
about members of the territorial legisla­
ture being also members of the South
Dakota "state" legislature —had taken an
oath to support the constitution of the
latter and would soon be required to take
the oath of allegiance to tlie former—and
supposing the iron-clad oath of southern
reconstruction times should be de­
manded? No sooner did the P. & D. see
this in print than it opened up on Mr.
Williams and spoke about his having out­
grown the "jack rabbit proportions as to
ears," or something of that kind. The
P» & D. is not very consistent. Lt is a
warm supporter of the Huron "state"
movement—believes in repealing the re­
straining clause—believes there has been
foolishness enough, and now statehood—
for the south—should be demanded. If
the P. & D. is sincere in this latter ex­
pression and really believes in setting up
a state government regardless of con­
gress, and standing by it, why should it
object to the iron-clad oath, even if it was
"suggested" in earnest instead of jok­
ingly? If there really is to be a state
government put in motion, it will be im­
possible for the members of one legisla­
ture to be' members of another at the
same time, and it would seem that the
P. & D. would be in for applying the test
of allegiance to the southern cause early
in the session.
OFFICIAL returns from all the counties
in the territory have been received, and
the table in another column is the first
correct statement of the vote for delegate
yet published. The total vote of the ter­
ritory was 104,811, of which Mr. Gifford
received 66,932 and Mr. Day 37,879, a
majority for the republican nominee of
29,053. In North Dakota Mr. Gifford re­
ceived 23,538 votes and Mr. Day 15,508.
In South Dakota Mr. Gifford received
43,394 votes and Mr. Day 22,371. In
other words, Mr. Gifford received 60 per
cent, of the total vote in North Dakota
and 66 per cent, of the total vote in South
Dakota. Reckoning five inhabitants to
each voter, the usual ratio, the territory
has a population of 524,055. It is abso­
lutely safe to reckon on half a million
disfranchised souls in the territory. Da­
kota casts more votes than the following
states and territories" Arizona, Col­
orado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Mon­
tana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South
Carolina. Utah, Washington and Wyo­
ming.
IT IS astonishing what fools enterpris­
ing newspaper reporters are making of
ordinarily intelligent and shrewd men.
Governor Church's entire policy has al­
ready been mapped out by more than a
score of Dakota politicians—in print.
The new governor has been in the terri­
tory, however, long enough to learn the
peculiarities of many of her citizens, and
will pay little attention to gratuitous ad
vioe. His dispatch in reply to one of
congratulation sent by Governor Pierce
is a neatly worded and peculiarly appro­
priate document, and shows a cleverness
in the new executive only excelled by
that of the retiring incumbent.
EDITOR WHEELOCK will be in Bismarck
himself this winter and send some
mighty newsy letters about the legisla­
ture to his paper. The TBIBUNE is under
obligations to Mr. Wheelock for courte­
sies extended Mr. Fowler, the TRIBUNE'S
traveling correspondent and canvasser
for legislative subscriptions. The TBIB­
UNE will be quite numerously circulated
in Mitchell this winter, notwithstanding
the fact that "that there is no occasion to
take any out side paper to know what is
going on at Bismarok."
A JOINT debate is to be Held in Sioux
Falls on the 17th between a number of
prominent young people on the question,
"Shall the tariff of the United States be
increased rather than diminished?" In
the list of speakers on the negative side
appears the name of Miss Maud Caldwell,
the charming and accomplished daughter
of the territorial auditor. After the dis­
cussion comes a piano solo by Miss Cald­
well aud then the decision of the judges—
which cannot be against Miss Caldwell—
she plays so nicely.
GOVEBNOB HOUBEB, one of the oldest
and most popular democrats of Montana,
has been suddenly bounced by President
Cleveland and the name of Preston H.
Leslie, of Kentucky, has been sent in for
confirmation. No reason is given in the
dispatches for this move, but undoubt­
edly it is beoause of Governor Houser's
severe criticism of Land Commissioner
Sparks in his report to the president. It
seems that this man Sparks is a chip on
President Cleveland's shoulder.
THB Sioux Falls papers are all op­
posed to the repeal of the restrain­
ing clause in the state" consti­
tution, as advooated by the Hu­
ronite, exoept it first be submitted to
a vote of the people, as was provided or
understood when the constitution was
first adopted. The Argus, whioh is
against the whole scheme, speaks as fol­
lows about the matter:
The Huronite has discovered a patent
method by which the territory can make a
fool of itself. Its theory is this: The re­
straining clause is merely the basting
threads of the constitutional garment.
When the garment is done—it should cer­
tainly be cut in the Mother Hubhard stvle
—of course the basting threads are to "be
taken out. They are not an integial part
of the garment. They are useful
vonly
while the garment is in process of con­
struction. So with this restraining clause.
According to section 1, article 28, the con­
stitution can only be amended by a vote of
the people. By refusing to recognize sec­
tion 32 as a part of the constitution the
people can be deprived of voice, and as to
whether or not the state government now
organized shall be set in motion. The the­
ory is ingenious, but not ingenuous, lt is
unique and technical. It is fraught with
feat
unfairness to the people of Dakota,
proposes to make the territory the butt
and laughing stock of the whole nation,
and to refuse to the people the right of any
voice in the matter.
OPINIONS ON THE OOVKRNOKMHIP.
The Dakota presB is practically a
unit—in its expression—regarding the
governorship. The following opinions
have been dipped at random:
Judge Palmer: A splendid appointment
Church is abroad man, and will be gov­
ernor of the whole territory. He will not
belong to any faction, and will make a
magnificent governor.
Valley City Times: While the Times re­
grets to see Governor Pierce leave the office
of governor of Dakota, which position he
has filled most honorably and acceptably,
we voice our welcoine to Governor Church,
who, though a comparative stranger to Da
kotans, has lived among us long enough to
warrant the formation of extensive public
opinion Highly creditable to him as a man,
as a citizen and as a friend.
MaiiQan Pioneer: Judge Church, the
new governor, seems to give general satis­
faction to all parties in Dakota. His dig­
nified and high toned course as a judge
will especially commend him to the high
office of chief executive. He has uniform­
ly abstained from taking any part in local
partisan movements and this fact too will
assure him -the full and complete confi­
dence of all the people.
Fargo Republican: The fact must be a
pleasant one to Governor Pierce that every
newspaper, and every individual, in refer­
ring to the appointment of Governor
Church, takes occasion to endorse" in warm
terms of praise the administration of the
outgoing governor. It is a fact admitted on
all hands that Governor Pierce has made
an admirable executive, ami. it will add
much to the warmth of Judge Church's re­
ception as his successor that he has the
confidence of a man whom the people have
tried and proved true.
Grand Forks I'laindealer: The appoint
mentof Judge Church as governor of the
territory of Dakota seems to be quite gener­
ally well received by the press and the peo­
ple of the territory. IIis qualifications,
abilities and character are not generally
known. Except, perhaps, in his own ju­
dicial district, he is almost an entirely un­
known quantity. What is known of him.
however, gives reason to believe that he
will make an able, conservative governor.
He has been a resident of the territory for
the past year and, as judge of the Fifth ju­
dicial district, has commanded the respect
and good opinion of all with whom he has
come in contact.
Fargo Republican: While it is perhaps
a fact that a majority of the democrats of
Dakota would have preferred the selection
of M. II. Day as the successor of Gov. Fierce,
after him there is probably no man in the
territory whose appointment will meet
more favor than Judge L. K. Church. He is
one of the ablest men in Dakota: with un­
blemished reputation is in harmony with
the policy of the administration, and is the
representative of no clique or faction, and
therefore his appointment will bring no
bitterness except of that of disappointment
to those who aspired to the place, or who
expected to profit by the appointment of
someone else.
Sioux Falls Press: There will doubtless
be some who will not at first feel satisfied
with the appointment on the ground that
.Tudgt Church is not an old Dakotan. But
it is to be remembered that more than half
the people of Dakota have come here dur­
ing the past four years, and that it should
not be considered a very great crime to be
anew comer. It should also be born in
mind that Judge Church is not identified
with any of the factions which exist in
both parties, and that he is therefore better
qualified to become the governor of the
whole territory. Taken all in all, the pres­
ident has made a good choice,'and the Press
will be disappointed if Judge Church does
not make an excellent governor.
Press and Dakotaian: The appointment
of a democratic governor in place of a man
who was made governor by a republican
president is in accordance with political
expectation and political right. The dem­
ocratic party is entitled to the spoils. South
Dakota will not objeet to a change of any
sort. Since the present incumbent took
possession of the office one-half of the ter­
ritory lias been without a governor, and it
is generally believed that this section can
fare no worse than it has under almost any
dispensation. Exact and equal justice to
all of Dakota is the sum of the expecta­
tions of the people, and if Governor Church
accomplishes this his administration will
prove a successful one. Dakota is very
tired of sectional favoritism in high places.
Minneapolis Tribune: Governor Pierce
has made a remarkable record. His con­
scientious devotion to the interests of the
territory, his great tact and good sense, his
intelligence and ability^ and his unfailing
courtesy, have made him a model execu­
tive. President Arthur made wise appoint­
ments as a rule, and the appointment of
Pierce has proved to have been one of his
best. Governor Pierce has, indeed, shown
himself possessed of many of the very
qualities which made President Arthur so
successful an executive. The Tribune
criticized the appointment of Colonel
Pierce because it came shortly after
the Chicago convention of 1884, which
declared that the territorial offices ought
to'be filled with residents. But Pierce's
mild yet firm sway was not that of a stran­
ger. He has rendered very great, services to
Dakota In the two years of his incumbency,
and will deserve high honor from one or
the other of the two Dakota states when
admitted to the Union. Governor Church
may and may not have as trying a place to
fill during the approaching session of the
territorial legislature as Governor Pierce
had in the last session. But he will find
the governorship of Dakota under present
circumstances no merely^ominal office. If
South Dakota should coimude to set up a
state government of its own. there might
follow complications that would subject
Governor Church to a very severe test.
Quite apart from agitation for division and
admission there are many matters of large
importance to occupy the attention of the
governor of such a province as Dakota.
The Tribune can wish the territory no bet­
ter fortune in the new governor than that
he may prove as acceptable in all respects
as his predecessor.
One of the big projects now being talked
of by capitalists and property holders is the
construction of abridge over the Missouri
river that teams and foot passengers may
cross between this city and Mandan. If
Bismarck intends to be the business center
of the upper Missouri valley she must de­
vise some means for the free transporta­
tion of the west Missouri farmers across
the Missouri. As the cities of Bismarck
and Mandan are hardly prepared to put a
million of dollars into a bridge, a free ferry
will be the next best scheme. There is no
reason why a free ferry should not be sus­
tained at tuis point

been called—excels even itself. The
beaty of its embellishment and the high
character of its original stories are be­
yond all praise. "Is the Squire In?"
the leading steel plate, is one of the very
best we have seen the First Grief,"
another steel plate, is almost as good, if
not quite. The colored design for paint­
ing on silk or satin, or to be worked in
embroidery, would cost at a retail store
fifty oents, yet is furnished gratis to sub­
scribers for "Peterson" as a New Year
gift. The fashion plate is double size,
engraved on steel, and colored by hand.

Volume IV. of Alden's Cyclopedia of
Universal Literature is out. -This cer
I tainly is a work of extraordinary popu.
lar interest, and it would be very strange
if at its low price it should not receive an
immense circulation. Though it is to ex­
tend probably to fifteen volumes, and
will include representative selections
(with biographical sketches) from nearly
2,000 of the most famous authors of the
world, of all ages and all nations, yet it is
easily within the reach of any one able to
invest so small a sum as ten cents a
week.
"The general excellence of this valuable
work is fully maintained in the volume
just received. The marvelous cheapness
of this edition has placed it within the
reach of many who are overjoyed to oall
such a work their own."* Oregonian,
Portland, Oregon.
"The prssent volume has eighty sub­
jects, of whom twenty are American,
which shows the attention given to Amer­
ican literature. The undertaking should
receive the support of every one having
occasion for reference to authors, and
the favor of the great public, that by
means of it can secure the best general
view of the world's literature." The
Globe, Boston, Mass.
The aboye are examples of the good
opinion expressed on every hand. Fur­
