TAFT FAVORS EXPOSITION.
President Ask3 Authority to Appe : nr
Commission to Outline Plans.
President Taft has given his cord';*
indorsement to the projnjsed semicen
tennial exposition suggested for 1913
to mark the progress the Negro has
made in the tifty years of his freedom
and to indicate the wonderful advance
the race has made since its landing in
this country nearly 300 years ago. The
movement was tailed to the attention
of the president not long ago by Dr.
Booker T. Washington.
In his first annual message to con
gress President Taft said of the pro
posed demonstrative exposition:
“The year 1913 will mark the fiftieth
anniversary of the issuance of the
emancipation proclamation which gave
freedom to the Negroes in the United
States. It seems fitting that this event
should be properly celebrated. Already
a movement has been started by prom
inent colored people and newspa
pers not only in the south, but in oth
er parts of the country. The south
especially is manifesting its interest
in such a celebration.
“It is suggested that a proper form
of celebration would be an exposition
which would show the progress which
the millions of Negroes have made not
only during their period of freedom,
but which would also Indicate their
progress from the time of their com
ing to this country.
“I heartily Indorse the proposed ex
position and suggest that the execu
tive be authorized to appoint a pre
liminary commission of not more than
seven persons to consider carefully
whether or not it is wise to hold such
an exposition, and. if so, to outline a
plan for the enterprise. I further rec
ommend that such preliminary com
mission serve without salary except ns
to their actual expenses and that an
appropriation be made to meet such
expenses.”

commercially tiwarnng mem. in ner
section of the country there are hun
dreds of A fro-America u young women
who are especially qualified to bring
something real tangible to pass, but
they await the opportunity to become
pedagogues, else they are dependent
upon their parents.
Mrs. Buchanan graduated from the
millinery department of Tuskegee and
with marked success made a specialty j
of teaching millinery after graduating
from this noted Institution, She has
had twelve years of experience as a :
pedagogue in the states of Indiana.
Ohio and Alabama and in all instances
endeavored to teach her students the!
gospel of “self help.” Her presout es |
tabiisument is an inspiration to any,
one who admires the kind of pluck and
energy that result in helping others to!
develop qualities that are uot deterrent j
to a progress that is synonymous to!
success. There are employed six in
telligent and ambitious young womeu
in this establishment, and through the
training they have received from Mrs. I
Buchanan they are proving themselves j
capable of holding positions in any first!
class millinery store. One upon enter- j
ing this beautiful store would not read
ily conceive the Idea that such an es
tablishment was strictly owned by an
Afro-American woman and largely pat
ronized by womeu of her race, but
would think It was for an exclusive
element of the other race. 8he is a
worthy example for young women to
emulate. GEORGE F. KING.
Charitable Work of Mra. C. H. Turner.
The Howard Industrial Building as

ganized about eight months ago by
Mrs. C. H. Turner for the purpose of
raising funds for the erection of the
new home for the Howard Orphan

There are ninety-four members of the
association‘at present, and during its
short reign $2. r i(5.i>4 has been raised by
voluntary contributions. Mrs. Turner
is a hard worker and has the co-opera
tion of the members in this worthy
cause.
