FEDERAL GRAND JURY
Bank President Will Appear Be
fore Court Commis
sioner.
Charged with Misappropriating
Funds and Aiding and
Abetting Allen.
President of State Fish Com
mission and Former
Senator.
Madison, Dec. 8.
■ alvert Spensley, president of tne
F.i, National bank at Mineral Point,
> rstwhile state senator and at the
present time president of the Wiscon
sin fish commission, is the bank offi
cial who was indicted by the federal
grand jury at La Crosse on evidence
adduced during the examination of
Philip Allen, Jr., vice president of
ilc bank, who has been sentenced f o
ill" Leavenworth prison for ten years
by Judge Sanborn.
Ft was learned from reliable
sources last night that Mr. Spensley
would arrive in the city this morning
and appear before a United States
court commissioner. The warrant
covering the counts of the indict
ment was issued at La Crosse and
charges Mr. Spensley with three vio
lations of the national banking laws,
as follows;
Misapplication of the banks funds.
Aiding and abetting Philip Allen,
h ,jn the misapplication of the funds
nl the bank.
Aiding and abetting Allen in mak
ing false reports of the condition or
the bank to the comptroller of tne
currency.
Several offenses under each charge
are alleged in the counts. The o:-
fenses cover a period of only three
y(ars, the federal officials being
barred under the federal statute ot
limitations for taking up alleged
frauds previous to mat period. The
indictment covers 58 pages of type
written manuscript.
The report that Mr. Spensley was
arrested or surrendered himself to
tin United States marshal spread like
wild lire last night. Telegrams came
pouring in from newspapers in tne
state and from cities outsfffe of wis
cousin. They had been advised that
the hank president surrendered rum
self. A systematic search for Mr.
Spensley was at once begun by tne
local newspaper men. Every incom
ing train was watched and all of the
leading hotels in the city were visit
ed All efforts to locate Marshal
Flint were made but he was not at
horn*' nor at his office in the federal
building. Accompanied by Judg
Sanborn he arrived yesterday noon
from La Crosse. He said during the
afternoon that no arrest would be
made during the day but that a mar
shal would go to Mineral Point to
day. Deputies John Kelly and W. T.
Pugh were not in the office yesterday.
At HazM Green?
Late lust night it was reported that |
Mr. Spensley had gone to Hazel !
Green, Grant county, to spend the
night.
Communication with Mineral Point ,
revealed that Mr. Spensley left that
city during the day. It was the gen
eral understanding there that he met
a marshal in some small town be- .
tween that city and Janesville and 1
that he would be brought to Madison
this morning. It was also reported
that Mr. Spensley notified the mar
shal’s office that he would surrender
himself this morning in Madison.
At Janesville it was learned that
no marshal passed through that city
on his way to Mineral Point.
Another Official Indicted.
From La Crosse conies the news
that a lesser official of the bank also
was indicted.
Allen Blames Spensley.
Mr. Spensley was indicted on Al
len's testimony. It is understood that
the convicted banker testified before
The grand jury that the first wrong
was committed by Mr. Spensley 20
years ago, he having misapplied $35,000
of the bank’s funds. Some time after
that, it is said. Allen stated to the
jury that he made the first forgeries
to cover up the wrongs.
Mr. Spensley is one of the most
prominent men of the slate and the
news of his indictment by the grand
jury is greatly regretted among his
friends. In his home city, be has
held the esteem of the citizens ana
they have honored him with a num
ber of public offices.
Honored With Public Offices.
Mr. Spensley was born at Stockton
on-the-Tees, England, on January 2.
1 >.4*l. and came with his parents to
Wisconsin in 1849. They settled at
Shullsburg and removed to Mineral
Point in 1857, which city has been
Mr. Spensley’s home ever since. He
received his education in the common
schools. Mineral Point seminary West
ern Cnion college at Fulton, Illinois,
and was graduated from the Columbia
college law school at New York in
1869. He was mayor of Mineral
Point in 1877-78, chairman of the
board of supervisors of lowa county
in 1575-76 and was elected to the state
eesiate in 1892. Mr. Spensley repre
sented lowa and La Fayette counties
and the towns of Cassville, Clifton,
Ellenborough, Harrison, Hazel Green,
Jamestown, Liberty, Lima, Paris,
Platteville, Potosi, Smelser, Waterloo
and Glen Haven in Grant county. He
has been a member of the fish com
mission for some years.
It is understood that on a recent
visit in Madison Mr. Spensley con
fided to a friend that because of the
wrecking of the bank he and the mem
bers of his family practically have
lost their euure fortunes.
Mr. Spensley will be arraigned be
fore Commissioner Fred W. French or
Commissioner Chauncey E. Blake.
When Allen was arraigned, his bail
was fixed at $60,000, and it is believed
that the same bail bond will be re
quired of Mr. Spensley. It is expected
that he will be able to furnish bail.
The friends of Mr. Spensley are of
the opinion that he will fight the case
to the bitter end.
Walter L. Houser, formerly secre
tary of state, was the foreman of the
jury which indicted Messrs. Spensley
and Allen.

PRESIDENT’S WINONA SPEECH TO
GO INTO CONGRESSION
AL RECORD.
Washington, Dec. 8. —Having re
ceived the president’s message, con
gress yesterday found itself “out of
work” and l>olh houses adjourned un
til Friday, when if some of the com
mittees fail to provide something to
do an adjournment will be taken until
Monday.
Th" reading of the message con
sumed an hour and a half in each
house. The house then adjourned and
the senate afterward htdd an execu
tive session. The republicans seemed
to agree that the message was as sat
isfactory a document as the president
could prepare and remain consistent
with the party’s campaign pledges.
The democrats approved the presi
dent’s effort to economize, but depre
cated his suggestion that the Monroe
doctrine practically has become obso
lete. Representative Clark, the min
ority leader, thought that about all
that could be said about the message
was that it was comparatively briet
“as the discussion of almost all im
portant matters is relegated L> special
message.”
In both houses the printed message
was subjected to a careful scrutiny,
but the members paid little attention
to the perfunctory reading by the
clerks. In both branches the message
will be prepared for “vivisection” by
the various committees whose busi
ness it is to deal with various sub
jects discussed.
Won’t Interfere With MacVeagh.
i
While the impression prevails
among the members of congress that
there should be a thorough investiga
tion of the customs service as a re
sult of the sugar frauds discovered,
there seems to be no disposition to
take the matter out of the hands of
the treasury department and the de
partment of justice.
Senate Wants to Know.
The senate called upon President
Taft yesterday to furnish information
concerning the action taken under the
treaty of March 1, 1905, for the sup
pression of the “white slave” trade.

Taft's speech, delivered at Winona,
wherein he sustained the Payne-Ald
rich tariff, will be printed as a sen

Ni'VEAGH’S^REPQRT
BY MISTAKE CREATES CON
STERNATION IN REPORTORIAL
CIRCLES.
Washington, Dec. 8. —Senator Root,
presiding in the senate yesterday in
the temporary absence of Vice Pres
ident Sherman, unknowingly created
a sensation among newspaper men
whose effects were even internation
al. Copies of the annual report ol
the secretary of the treasury were in
the hands of the newspapers through
out this country and Europe, to oe
held in confidence for publication this
afternoon. The report itself still was
unsigned by Secretary McVeagh.
By some undecipherefi means, two
printed copies of the report came to
the desk of the president of the sen
ate. Senator Root handed the treas
ury report over the desk, with tiie
routine announcement customary in
such cases. Instantly reporters on
the senate floor flashed to the wires
the news that the report had become
a public document, and “release” was
clicked off to Chicago, San Francisco,
New York and Europe.
It was nearly two hours before the
fact that the blunder was made was
realized; upon the secretary's insist
ence an effort was made to recall
the release but he soon appreciated
that the release was irreparable and
consented to confirm it.
An amusing feature was that tne
report, in accordance with the law, is
addressed only to the speaker of the
house and does not properly go to
the senate.
WAGES IftCREASEC

Detroit, Dec. 8. —General Superin
tendent Brown, of the Michigan Cen

“Our conductors and brakemen were
given an increase in wages of approx

“The operators were offered an in

TAFT'S
VIEWS
Hands Off the Tariff Till After
a Scientific Inves
tigation.
Ship Subsidies Endorsed and
Sugar Swindlers
Denounced.
Favors Postal Savings Banks
—For War on White
Slava Traffic.
Washington. Dec. 7- —President Taft
in his annual message to congress
deals with the tariff, the Nicaraguan
question, sugar frauds, white slavery
and other questions. ‘‘Perhaps the
most important question presented
to this administration is that of econ
omy in expenditure and sufficiency of
revenue, says the president, who
discusses the methods taken to meet
the deficit. The president declares
it unwise to attempt revision of the
tariff until the facts are at hand upon
which such revision can properly be
undertaken.
Speaking generally, he says the
country is in a high state of prosper
ity. He notes the increase in the
cost of living but says the tariff is
not the cause. In those products of
the factory and farm there has been
no increase in the tariff or in many
instances a very considerable reduc
tion, the President declares. Mr.
Taft says that conservation of natural
resources, among other things, and
proposed amendments to anti-trust
and interstate commerce laws will be
discussed in special messages to be
sent to congress.
Bad Zelaya.
President Taft refers to Central
American affairs, declaring that the
Zelaya government of Nicaragua has
kept Central America in constant ten
sion or turmoil. He says:
“I need not rehearse here the pa
tient efforts of this government to
promote peace and welfare among
these republics, efforts which are
fully appreciated by the majority of
them who are loyal to their Interests.
It would be no less unnecessary to
rehearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression al
leged to have been committed by the
Zelaya government. Recently two
Americans were put to death by order
of President Zelaya himself. They
were reported to have been regularly
commissioned officers in the organized
forces of a revolution which had con
tinued many w r eeks and was proceed
ings an orderly fashion in control of
about half of the republic, and as
such, according to the modern en
lightened practice of civilized nations,
they would be entitled to be dealt
with as prisoners of war.
“At the date when this message is
printed this government hat' termin
ated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government, for reasons made
public in a communication to the
former Nicaraguan charge d’ affairs,
and is intending to take such future
steps as may be found most consist
ent with its dignity, its duty to Amer
ican interests, and its moral obliga
tions to Central America and to civil
ization. It may be necessary for me
to bring this subject to the attention
of the congress in a special message.’’
Chinese Railway Loans.
Concerning the far east, the mes
sage says this government preserves
unchanged its policy of supporting the
principle of equality and opportunity,
and that the equal participation of
Americans in the Chinese railroad
loan seems assured.
“Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continues cordial as
usual, ’ it is declared. “The arrange
ment of 1908 for a cooperative cen
tre. of the coming of laborers to the
United States has proved to work
satisfactorily. The matter of a revi
sion of the existing treaty between
the United States and Japan which is
terminable in 1912 is already receiv
ing the study of both countries.”
Economy!
“Perhaps, “continues the message,
“the most important question pre
sented to this administration is that
of economy in expenditures and suf
ficiency of revenue. The report ot
the secretary shows that the or
dinary expenditures for the current
fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will
exceed the estimated receipts by $34,-
075,620. If to this deficit is added
the sum to be disbursed for the
Panama canal, amounting to $38,000,-
000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the
public debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditures will be in
creased to a total deficit of $73,075,-
620. This deficit the secretary pro
poses to meet by the proceeds of
bonds issued to pay the cost of con
structing the Panama canal. I ap
prove this proposal.”
Canal To Cost $375,000,000.
Tne president says that the cost of
engineering and construction of the
canal which will be completed Jan
uary 1, 1915, will be $297,766,000 in
stead of $139,705,200 as originally es
timated. Other expenses increase the
cost by $75,435,00 ,to a total of $375,-
201,000.
Surplus Revenues.
•The estimates of the expenses of
the government for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1911, are less by $42.-
000,000 than the total of appropria
tions-for the current year. “So far as
the secretary of the treasury is able to
form a judgment as to future income,
and compare it with the expenditures
for the next fiscal year, ending June 30
1911, there will be no deficit in the year
ending June 30, 1911, but a surplus of
$53,931,000. This does not include
canal expenditures.
“In the present estimates the needs
of the departments and of the govern
nien thave been cut to the quick, so
to speak, and any assumption on the
part of congress, so often made in
times past, that the estimates have
been prepared with the expectation
that they may be reduced, will result
in seriously hampering proper admin
istration.” Efforts being made to re
duce the cost of governmental admin
istration and the question of dismiss
ing useless employes are discussed.
Civil Pensions.
Mr. Taft notes the objection to the
establishment of civil pensions, but
says he is convinced that no other
practical solution of the difficulties
presented by the superannuation of
civil servants can be found than that
of a system of civil pensions.
Sugar Frauds.
‘I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds in the
collection of the customs revenue at
New York City, in which a number of
the subordinate employes in the
weighing and other departments were
directly concerned, and in which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining company and others. The
frauds consisted in the payment of
duty on underweights of sugar. The
government has recovered from the
American Sugar Refining company all
that it Is shown to have been de
frauded of. The sum was received in
full of the amount due, which might
have been recovered by civil suit
against the beneficiary of the fraud,
but there was an express reservation
in the contract of settlement by which
the settlement should not interfere
w ; th. or prevent the criminal prosecu
tion of everyone who was found to be
subjpct to the same.
“Criminal prosecutions are now
proceeding against a number of the
governmetnt officers. The treasury
department and the department of
justice are exerting every effort to
discover all the wrongdoers, including
the officers and employes of + he com
panies who may have been privy to
the fraud. It would seem to me that
an investigation of the frauds by
congress at present, pending the prob
ing by the treasury department and
the department of justice, as proposed,
might by giving immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment in se
curing conviction of the guilty par
ties.”
The Tariff.
President Taft discusses the tariff
and the operation of the maximum
and minimum clause in the act. He
says that in the working of this, fear
has been expressed that the power
conferred and duty imposed on the
executive is likely to lead to a tar
iff war. “I beg to express the hope
and belief that no such result need
be anticipated,” Mr. Taft says. “I
conceive that this power was reposed
in the president with the hope that
the maximum duties might never be
applied in any case, but that the
power to apply them would enable
the president and the state depart
ment through friendly negotiation to
secure the elimination from the laws
and the practice under them of any
foreign country of that which is un
duly discriminatory. No one is seek
ing a tariff war, or a condition in
which the spirit of retaliation shall
be aroused.”
The new* tariff board is discussed.
“I believe,” he continues, “that the
work of this board will be of prime
utility and importance whenever con
gress shall deem it wise again to re
adjust the customs duties. If the
facts secured by the board are of such
a character as to show generally that
the rates of duties imposed by tne
tariff law are excessive under the
principles of protection a- described
in the platform of the successful
party at the late election, I shall not
hesitate to invite the attention of con
gress to this fact and to the necessity
for action predicated thereon. Noth
ing, however, halts business and inter
feres with the course of prosperity so
much as the threatened revision of
the tariff, and until the facts are at
hand, after careful and deliberate in
vcstigation, upon which such revision
can properly be undertaken, it seems
to me unwise to attempt it.”
‘ln the interest of immediate econ
omy and because of the prospect of a
deficit, I have required a reduction in
the estimates of the war department,
which brings the total estimates
down to forty-five millions less than
the corresponding estimates for last
year. This could only be accom
plished by cutting off new projects
and suspending for the period of one
year all progress in military matters.
For the same reason, I have directed
that the army shall not be recruited
up to its present authorized strength.
These measures can hardly be more
than temporary—to last until our reve
nues are in better condition and until
the whole question of the expediency
of adopting a definite military policy
can be submitted to congress.” The
president concurs in the judgment
of the military and naval joint board
in favor of making an extensive naval
base at Pearl harbor, near Honolulu,
and not in the Philippines.
Navy Reorganization.
“Early in the coming session,” he
says, “a comprehensive plan for the
reorganization of the officers of all
corps of the navy will be presented to
congress, and I hope it will meet with
action suited to its urgency.” The
appointment of an eminent astrono
mer as head of the naval observatory
is recommended.
Costly Litigation.
President Taft says that in his
judgment, a change in judicial pro
cedure, with a view to reducing its
expense to private litigants in civil
cases and facilitating the dispatch of
business and final decision in both
civil and criminal cases, constitutes
the greatest need in our American in
stitutions. “I do not doubt for one
moment that much of the lawless
violence and cruelty exhibited in
lynchings is directly due to the un
certainties and injustice growing out
of the delays in trials, judgments, and
the executions thereof by our courts.”
A commission to consider reforms in
the judiciary is recommended.
Injunctions.
The president recommended that
appropriate legislation relating to the
issuance of injunctions be adopted.
Previous notice and a reasonable op
portunity to be heard on behalf of
the parties to be enjoined are urged
by the president, with certain excep
tions.
President Taft refers to anti-trust
and interstate commerce laws which
he says will be discussed in a special
message.
Postal Deficit, Postal Banks.
The president says that the actual
loss growing out of the transmission
of second class mail matter, which
includes not only newspapers but
magazines and miscellaneous periodi
cals, at 1 cent a pound, amounts to
about $63,000,000 a year. Congress
may well consider whether ladical
steps should not be taken to reduce
the deficit in the postoffice depart
ment. A higher rate of postage it is
suggested, might be imposed upon
magazines and periodicals.
“The second subject worthy of men
tion in the postofflce department is
the necessity and practicability of es
tablishing postal savings banks,” the
message continues. President Taft
says he is convinced the people de
sire such banks, and that they will be
productive of the utmost good. “They
will furnish a satisfactory substitute,
based on sound principle and actual
successful trial in nearly all the
countries of the world, for the system
of government guaranty of deposits
now being adopted in several western
states, which, with deference to those
who advocate it, seems to me to have
in it the seeds of demoralization to
conservative banking and certain fi
nancial disaster.”
And a Ship Subsidy!
“I earnestly recommend to con
gress the consideration and passage
of a ship subsidy bill, looking to the
establishment of lines between our
Atlantic seaboard and the eastern
coast of South America, as well as
lines from the west coast of the
United States to South America,
China, Japan, and the Philippines.
“The profits on foreign mails, “he
says, “are perhaps a sufficient meas
ure of the expenditures which might
first be tentatively applied as a sub
sidy.”
Same Old Territories.
In recommending separate statehood
for New Mexico and Arizona, Presi
dent Taft urges deliberation in the
selection of members of the constitu
tional convention of each territory,
and earnestly advises that after the
adoption of a constitution, it be sub
mitted to the people for approval at
an election.
Alaska.
“With respect to Alaska, I recom
mend legislation which shall provide
for the appointment by the president
of a governor and also of an execu
tive council, the members of which
shall during their term of office re
side in the territory, and which shall
have legislative powers sufficient to
enable it to give to the territory local
laws adapted to its present growth. I
strongly deprecate legislation looking
to the election of a territorial legisla
ture in that vast district.”
The president mentions the neces
sity for legislation looking to the fur
ther conservation of natural resources,
and announces that a special message
on this subject, including that or
waterways, reclamation, irrigation
and reforesting, wil be sent to con
gress.
White Slavery.
White slavery is discussed, the
view being that there is urgent neces
sity for additional legislation, and
greater executive activity to suppress
it. “I believe it to be constitutional,"
the president says, “to forbid, under
penalty, the transportation of persons
for purposes of prostitution across
national and state lines; and by ap
propriating a funft of $50,000 to be
used by the secretary of commerce
and labor for the employment of spe
cial inspectors, it will be possible to
bring those responsible for this trade
to indictment and conviction under a
federal law.”
Health.
There seems to be no reason why
all the bureaus and offices in the gen
eral government which have to c.o
with the public hearth or subjects
akin thereto should not be united in
a bureau to be called the bureau of
public health. This would necessitate
the transfer of the marine hospital
service to such a bureau, says the
president.
The year 191 C will mark the fiftieth
anniversary of the issuance of the
emancipation proclamation granting
freedom to the regroes. It seems
fitting, he says, that this event should
be properly celebrated.
Cost of Living.
It is well to note, says the presi
dent, that the increase in the cost of
living is not confined to this country,
but prevails the world over, and that
those who would charge increases in
prices to the existing protective tar
iff must meet the fact that the rise in
prices has taken place almost wholly
in those products of the factory and
farm in respect, to which there has
been either no increase in the tariff
or in many instances a very consider
able reduction.
As to the Alsop claim against Chile
the president says: “Happily, as the
result of the recent diplomatic nego
tiations, the governments of the
United States and Chile, actuated by
the sincere desire to free from any

MARTIAL Li
RULES HONDURAS
Washington, Dec. 8. —The govern
ment of Honduras, apprehending
armed invasion, has proclaimed mar
tial law throughout the republic. This
information reached the state depart
ment. yesterday, but no indication is
given as to the source from which
the invasion is expected.
It is believed that Bonila, a former
president, who was deposed by Pres
ident l>avila *hrough the help of Ze
laya, may be taking advantage of the
situation in Nicaragua to seek re
venge. It has been suspected among
Central Americans that Davila was
in sympathy with Zelaya in his ef
forts to crush the revolution under
Estrade and thought that Bonlla’s
threatened invasion of Honduras
would serve the double purpose of
preventing aid being given Zelaya and
at the same time render possible the
overthrow of the Davila government.
Bonila at present is said to be at
Belize, British Honduras. If he has
any considerable following it ,is
through a compromise with Hondura
nians dissatisfied with the Davila
government,
