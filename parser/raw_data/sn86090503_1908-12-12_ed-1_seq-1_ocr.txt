friends last evening at his pleas
ant home in the eastern part of

a host in himself, no matter what

last evening went home with the
impression that as an entertainer
of his friends he fairly sur
passes himself. However, the
irursts last evening could not,
even if they would, be unmind
ful of Mrs. Martin's exceedingly
important contribution to the
evening's enjoyment. Mrs. Mar

skill. Appetizing

STATEHOOD FOR NEW MEXICO
In His Message to Congress President Roosevelt
Recommends the Immediate Admission of New
Mexico and Arizona as States of the Union.
That great progress has been made to
ward the desired goal by the agitation for
statehood for New Mexico is shown by the
following paragraph from President Roose
velt's message to congress, read at the as
sembling of that body the first of the week:
"I advocate the immediate admission of
of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This
should be done at the present session of con
gress. The people of the two territories have
made it evident by their votes that they will
not come in as one state. The only alterna
tive is to admit them as two, and I trust that
this will be done without delay."
