Washington, Dec. 7.—President Wilson »
*today delivered his annual message at a
joint session of the two houses of con
gress. He said in part:
Since I last had the privilege of ad
dressing you on the state of the Union
the war of nations on the other side of
the sea, which had then only begun to
»disclose its portentous proportions, has
-extended its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within its flame some
.portion of every quarter of the globe, not
excepting our hemisphere, has altered the
•whole face of international affairs, and
•now presents a prospect of reorganiza
tion and reconstruction such as states
men and peoples have never been called
upon to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neutral.
It was our manifest duty to do so. In
the day of readjustment and recupera
tion we earnestly hope and believe that
we can be of infinite service.
In this neutrality, to which they were
bidden not only by their separate life and
their habitual detachment from the poli
tics of Europe but also by a clear per
ceptiôn of international duty, the states
of America have become conscious of a
new and more vital community of inter
est and morai partnership in affairs, more
clearly conscious of the many common
sympathies and interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
We have been put to the test in the case
of Mexico, and we have stood the test.
Whether we have benefited Mexico by
the course we have pursued remains to
be seen. Her fortunes are In her own
hands. But we have at least proved that
we will not take advantage of her in her
distress and undertake to impose upon
her an order and government of our own
choosing.
We will aid and befriend Mexico, but
we will, not coerce her; and our course
with regard to her ought to be sufficient
proof to all America that we seek no po
selfish control.
Not Hostile Rivals.
The moral is, that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-oper
ating friends, and that their growing
sense of community of interest, alike in
matters political and in matters econom
ic, is likely to give them a new signifi
cance as factors in international affairs
and in the political history of the world.
It presents tfiem as in a very deep and
true sense a unit in world affairs, spir
itual partners, standing together because
thinking together, quick with common
sympathies and common Ideals. Separat
ed, they are subject to all the cross cur
rents of the confused politics of a world
of hostile rivalries; united in spirit and
purpose they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This is Pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire in it. It is the em
bodiment, the effectual embodiment, of
the spirit of law and independence and
liberty and mutual service.
Tnere is, I venture to point out, an espe
cial significance just now attaching to
this whole matter of drawing the Amer
icas together in bonds of honorable part
nership and mutual advantage because of
the economic readjustments which the
world must inevitably witness within the
next generation, when peace shall have
at last resumed its healthful tasks. In
the performance of these tasks I believe
the Americas to be destined to play their
parts together. I am interested to fix
your attention on this prospect now be
cause unless you take it within your
view and permit the full significance of
It to command your thought I cannot
find the right light in which to set forth
the particular matter that lies at the
very front of my whole thought as I ad
dress you today. I mean national de
fense.

lltical suzerainty
Might to Maintain Right.
Out of such thoughts grow all our poli
cies. We regard war merely as a means
of asserting the rights of a people against
aggression. And we are as fiercely jeal
ous of coercive or dictatorial power with
in our own nation as of aggression from
without. We will not maintain a stand
ing army except for uses which are as
necessary in times of peace as in times
of war; and we shall always see to it
that our military peace establishment is
no longer than is actually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of days in which

do believe in a body of free citizens ready
and sufficient to take care of themselves
and of the governments which they have
set up to serve them. In our constitutions
themselves we have commanded that "the
right of the people to keep and
arms shall not be Infringed," and our
confidence has been that our safety in
times of danger would lie in the rising of
the nation to take care of itself, as the
farmers rose at Lexington.
But war has never been a mere matter
ef men and guns. It is a thing of disci
plined might. If our citizens are ever to
fight effectively upon a sudden summons,
they must know how modern fighting is
done, and what to do when the summons

available and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant In
this matter, must supply them with the
training thev need to take care of them
selves and of it. The military arm of their
government, which they will not allow to
direct them, they may properly use to
them and make their independence

secure—and not their own independence
merely but the rights also of those with
whom they have made common cause,
should they also be put in Jeopardy.
They must be fitted to play the great
role in t lie world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened ambi
tion to plav
It is with these ideals in mind that the
plans of the department of war for more
adequate national defense were conceived
which will be laid before you, and which
I urge you to sanction and put into ef

the essential first steps, and they seem

strength of 7,136 officers and 134,707 en
listed men, or 141,843, all told, all serv
ices, rank and file, by the addition of 52
companies of coast artillery, 15 com
panies of engineers, ten regiments of in
fantry, four regiments of field artillery,
and four aero squadrons, besides 750 offi
cers required for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all-important duty
of training the citizen force of which I
shall presently speak, 79& non-commis
sioned officers for service In drill, recruit
ing and the like, and the necessary quota
of enlisted men for the quartermaster
corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance
department and other similar auxiliary
services. These are the additions neces
sary to render the army adequate for its
present duties, duties which it has to
perform not only upon our own conti
nental coasts and borders and at our in
terior army posts, but also in the Phil
ippines, in the Hawaiian islands, at the
isthmus, and in Porto Rico.
Force of Trained Citizens.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale, should
occasion arise, the plan also contemplates
supplementing the army by a force of
400,000 disciplined citizens, raised in incre
ments of 133,000 a year throughout a pe
riod of three years. This it is proposed
to do by a process of enlistment under
which the serviceable men of the coun
try would be asked to bind themselves to
serve with the colors for purposes of
training for short periods throughout
three years, and to come to the colors
at call at any time throughout an addi
tional "furlough" period of three years.
This force of 400,000 men would be pro
vided with personal accoutrements as fast
as enlisted and their equipment for the
field made ready to be supplied at any
time. They would be assembled for train
ing at stated Intervals at convenient
places in association w'ith suitable units
of the regular army. Their period of
annual training would not necessarily ex
ceed two months in the year.
It would depend upon the patriotic feel
ing of the younger men of the country
whether they responded to such a call
to service or not. It would depend upon
the patriotic spirit of the employers of
the country whether they made it possi
ble for the younger men in their em
ploy to respond under favorable condi
tions or not. I, for one, do not doubt
the patriotic devotion either of our young
men or of those who give them employ
ment—those for whose benefit and protec
tion they would in fact enlist. I would
look forward to the success of such an
experiment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely imperative now. We Cannot do

Program for the Navy.
The program to be laid before you con
templates the construction within five
years of 10 battleships, 6 battle cruis
ers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers, 15
fleet submarines, 85 coast submarines,
four gunboats, one hospital ship, two
ammunition ships, two fuel-oil ships and
one repair ship. It is proposed that of
this number we shall the first year pro
vide for the construction of two battle
ships, two battle cruisers, three scout
cruisers, 15 destroyers, five fleet subma
rines, 25 coast submarines, two gunboats,
and one hospital ship; the second year,
two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten
destroyers, four fleet submarines. 15 coast
submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel
oil ship: the third year, two battleships,
one battle cruiser, ÿvo scout cruisers, five
destroyers, two fleet submarines, and 15
coast submarines; the fourth year, two
battleships, two battle cruisers, two
scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet
submarines. 15 coast submarines, one am
munition ship, and one fuel-oil ship: and
the fifth year, two battleships, one battle
cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroy
ers, two fleet submarines, 15 coast subma
rines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship
and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy is asking
also for the immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors.
2,500 apprentice seamen, and 1,500 marines
This increase would be sufficient to care
for the ships which are to be completed
within the fiscal year 1917 and also for
the number of men which must be put in
training to man the ships which will be
completed early in 1918. It is also neces
sary that the number of midshipmen at
the naval academy at Annapolis should
be increased by at least 300 in order that
the force of officers should be more rap
idly added to: and authority is asked to
appoint for engineering duties only, ap
proved graduates of engineering colleges,
and for service In the aviation corps a
certain number of men taken from civil
life.
if this full program should be carrjed
out we should have built or building in
1921, according to the estimates of surviv
al and standards of classification followed
by the general board of the department,
jin effective navy consisting of 27 battle
ships of the first line, six battle cruisers,
25 battleships of the second line, ten ar
mored cruisers. 13 scout cruisers, five
first-class cruisers, three second-class
cruisers, ten third-class cruisers, 108 de
troyers, 18 fleet submarines, 157 coast sub
marines, six monitors. 20 gunboats, four
Supply ships, 15 fuel ships, four trans
ports, three tenders to torpedo vessels,
eight vessels of special types, and two
ammunition ships. This would be a navy
fitted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions.
Trade and Shipping.
But armies and instruments of war are
only part of what has to be considered
if we are to consider the supreme matter
of national self-sufficiency and security
in all its aspects. There are other great
matters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. There
is,- for example, a very pressing question
of trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy,
is necessary for many weighty reasons of
women grown far into the years, for
example, and yet who have maintained
their communion of dreams and con
fidences unbroken and unspoiled.
There is little more refreshing to con
template than friendships between
middle-aged or old men that have ex
isted in strength and harmony from
boyhood days. Other friendships have

some of them true, some of them
tried, but none of them as richly re

Into every sea, and who were the pride
and often the bulwark of the nation, we
have almost driven out of existence by
inexcusable neglect and Indifference and
by a hopelessly blind and provincial pol
icy of so-called economic protection,
is high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial independence on
the seas.
For it is a question of Independence.
If other nations go to 'war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce, oui* mer
chants, it seems, are at their mercy,
to do with as they please. > We must use
their ships, and use them as they deter
mine. We have not ships enough of our
own. We cannot handle our own com
merce on the seas. 6ur independence is
provincial, and is only on land and with
in our own borders,
to be permitted to use even the ships of
other nations In rivalry of their own
trade, and are without means to extend
our commerce even where the doors are
wide open and our goods desired,
a situation is not to be endured,
of capital importance not only that the
United States should be its own carrier
on the seas and enjoy the economic in
dependence which only an adequate mer
chant marine would give it, but also that
the American hemisphere as a
should enjoy a like independence and self
sufficiency, if it is not to be drawn into
the tangle of European affairs. Without
such independence the whole question of
our political unity and self-determination
is very seriously clouded and complicated
indeed.

Question of Finance.
The plans for the armed forces of the
nation which I have outlined, and for
the general policy of adequate prepara
tion for mobilization and defense. In
volve of course very large additional ex
penditures of money—expenditures which
will considerably exceed the estimated
revenues of the government. It is made
my duty by law, whenever the estimates
of expenditure exceed the estimates of
revenue to call the attention of the con
gress to the fact and suggest any means
of meeting the deficiency that it may be
wise or possible for me to suggest. 1 am
ready to believe that it would be my duty
to do so in any case; and I feel particu
larly bound to speak of the matter when
It appears that the deficiency will arise
directly out of the adoption by the con
gress of measures which 1 myself urge
it to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to
speak briefly of the present state of the
treasury and of the fiscal problems
which the next year will probably dis
close.
On the thirtieth of June last there was
an available balance in the general fund
of the treasury of $104,170,105.78. The to
tal estimated receipts for the year 1916,
on the assumption that the emergency
revenue measure passed by the last con
gress will not be extended beyond its
present limit, the thirty-first of Decem
ber, 1915, and that the present duty of
one cent per pound on sugar will be dis
continued after the first of May, 1916,
will be $670,365,500. The balance of June
last and these estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand total of $774.535,605.78.
The total estimated disbursements for the
present fiscal year, including $25,000,000
for the Panama canal, $12,000,000 for prob
able deficiency appropriations and $50,
000 for miscellaneous debt redemptions,
will be $753,891,000; and the balance in the
general fund of the treasury will be re
duced to $20,644,605.78. The emergency
revenue act. If continued beyond its pres
ent time limitation, would produce, dur
ing the half year then remaining, about
forty-one millions. The duty of one cent
per pound on sugar, If continued, would
produce during the two months of the
fiscal year remaining after the first of
May, about fifteen millions. These two
sums, amounting together to $56,000,000.
If added to the revenues of the second
half of the fiscal year, would yield the
treasury at the end of the year an avail
able balance of $76,644,606.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have spok
would, as at present estimated, he
for the fiscal year 1917. $93,500,000. Those
figures, taken with the figures for the
present fiscal year which I have already
given, disclose our financial problem for
the year 1917.
How shall we obtain the new revenue?
It seems to me a clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that In what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled to
know just what burdens of taxation they
are to carry, and to know from the outset,
now. The new bills should be paid by in
ternal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall we turn?
We would be following an almost uni
versal example of modern governments
If we were to draws the greater part or
even the whole of the revenues we need
from the income taxes. By somewhat
lowering the present limits of exemption
and the figure at which the surtax shall
begin to be imposed, and by Increasing,
step by step throughout the present grad
uation. the surtax Itself, the income taxes
as at present apportioned would yield
sums sufficient to balance the books of
the treasury at the end of the fiscal year
1917 without anywhere making the bur
den unreasonably or oppressively heavy.

The Danger Within.
I have spoken to you today, gentlemen,
upon a single theme, the thorough prep
aration of the nation to care for its
own security and to make sure of entire
freedom to play the impartial role in this
hemisphere and In the world which we
all believe to have been providentially
assigned to it. I have had in mind no
thought of any immediate or particular
danger arising out of our relations with
other nations. We are at peace with all
the nations of the world, and there is
reason to hope that no question in con
troversy between this and other govern
ments will lead to any serious breach of
amicable relations, grave as some differ
ences of attitude and policy have been
and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry
to say that the gravest threats against
our national peace and safety have been
uttered within our own borders. There are

it necessary that we should promptly

we may be purged of their corrupt dis

thing like this before. It never dreamed
it possible that men sworn Into Its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great free
stocks such as supplied some of the best
and strongest elements of that little, but
how heroic, nation that in a high day of old
staked its very life to -free itself from
every entanglement that had darkened
the fortunes of the older nations and set
up a new standard here—that men of such
origins and such free choices of allegi
ance would ever turn in malign reaction
against the government and people who
had welcomed and nurtured them and
seek to make this proud country once
more a hotbed of European passion. A
little while ago such a thing would have
seemed incredible. Because it was in
credible we made no preparation for it.
We would have been almost ashamed to
prepare for it, as if we were suspicious

neighbors! But the ugly and incredible

Such creatures of passion, disloyalty
and anarchy must be crushed out. They
are not many, but they are infinitely ma.
lignant, and the hand of our power should <
close over them at once. They have
formed plots to destroy property, they
have entered into conspiracies against the
neutrality of the government, they have
sought to pry into every confidential
transaction of the government in order
to serve interests alien to our own. It is*
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the terms
in which they may be dealt with.
I wish that it could be said that only a
few men, misled by mistaken sentiments
of allegiance to the governments undei
which they were born, had been guilty ol
disturbing the self-possession and misrep
resenting the temper and principles ol
the country during these days of terri bL
war, when It would seem that every mar t
who was truly an American would in
stinctively make it his duty and his pride,
to keep the scales of judgment even and
prove himself a partisan of no nation but
his own. But It cannot. There are some
men among us, and many resident abroad
who, though born and bred in the Unit
ed States and calling themselves Amer
icans, have so forgotten themselves and
their honor as citizens as to put then
passionate sympathy with one or the oth
er side in the great European conflie!
above their regard for the peace and dig

preach and practice disloyalty. No laws
I suppose, can reach corruptions of the
mind and heart; but I should not speak
of others without also speaking of these
and expressing the even deeper humilia
tion and scorn which every self-possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American must
feel when he thinks of them and of the
discredit they are daily bringing upon us
Transportation Problem.
The transportation problem is an ex
ceedingly serious and pressing one in this
country. There has from time to time
of late been reason to fear that our rail
roads would not much longer be able tc
cope with it successfully as at presenl
equipped and co-ordinated. I suggest
that it would be wise to provide for a
commission of inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole question
whether our laws as at present framed
and administered are as serviceable as
they might be in the solution of the prob
lem. It is obviously a problem that lies
at the very foundation of our efficiency
as a people. Such an inquiry ought tc
draw out every circumstance and opinion
worth considering and we need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to
do anything in the field of federal legisla
tion.
For what we are seeking now. what in
my mind is the single thought of this
message, is national efficiency and se
curity. We serve a great nation. We
should serve it in the spirit of its peculiar
genius. It is the genius of common men
for self-government, industry, justice, lib
erty and peace. We should see to it that
it lacks no Instrument, no facility or vigor
of law, to make it sufficient to play its
part with energy, safety, and assured
success. In this we are no partisans but

Old Bill's Gift

Bill was a character. The towns

enjoyably he had
laid his plans.
These were now
perfected. A week
back Bill had
"gone to house
keeping." He had
discovered an old
abandoned barn
just beyond the
town limits. The
lowe ■ part had
lost doors and windows and was bleak
and cheerless indeed. A rickety
stairs, however, led to a room in on«
corner of the loft. It was cozy and
warm and at one time had been a har
ness room. Here Bill had "camped."
He had fished out an old oil stove, a
cot, a table and chair from the town
dumping heap.
A particulai housewife had present
ed him with a roasted chicken because
one side was slightly charred. On the
rude table beside it were half a dozen
homemade doughnuts and a real
mince pie.
Bill took a last look at the goodly
array of comfort then went out to seek
a branch of arbor vitae which would
serve as a Christmas tree.
As he neared the barn on his return
he came to a speedy halt.
A light glowed over at one corner of
the place. It proceeded from a lantern
set In the feed box of a manger. In
the manger itself across the stale hay
It contained a blanket was spread,
and, swatted In coverings upon this,
as jevçaled by the lantern rays, Igy a
little sleeping babe.
Near by a serious-faced man was
shaking the snow from his shoulders.
Beside him, seated on an old suitcase,
was a comely but care-worn woman.
The man began to speak. Bill, agape,
drew Into the shadow and listened. It
was to hear enough to learn that bad
luck was driving these homeless ones
from their former
home, penniless,
on foot, to the fa
ther of the wife,
ten miles further
on. The storm had
driven them to
temporary shelter.
The husband
and father had
taken a well
thumbed volume
from his pocket.
He began reading aloud. It was of
"an upper room," of a master and his
beloved disciples, of a supper never
to be forgotten in the memory of man
kind.

Bill stood like one transfixed. What
tender chord had been struck that he
closed his eyes! He was back forty
years in memory, at his mother's knee
How vivid, how appealing—a picture
she had shown him of the Christ-child
In a manger, of the devoted father and
mother, as here before him. a proto
type of that holy eve so real so touch
ing—the First Christmas!
A mighty thought moved him as he
quietly spoke:
"Friend, upstairs you will find com
fort till the storm is over. Call it a
Christmas greeting—see?" and was
gone.
"I'll strike out for Farmer Dale's
haymow," shivered Bill, after half an
hour's desultory wandering, and he
turned about—to start, to shout out,
and then to run.
For there in the distance the fa
miliar farmhouse showed r-.o illumina
tion within, but beyond it a glare shot
up—a haystack on fire!
Bill reached the farmyard. The
wind t^d blown the flames against one
gable of the house and it was burn
ing. He ran to the stable for a pitch
fork. Then began a fierce battle.
Bucket after bucket of water he car
ried. The last spark was dashed out.
and Bill sank exhausted to the ground
as the farmer and his family, visiting
at a neighbor's and attracted by the
blaze, came rushing upon the scene.
"Yes," declared Farmer Dale, two
hours later, as he showed Bill up the
stairs and into a comfortable chamber,
"this is your room, and you will sleep
here, and you're a free boarder long as
you like, understand? Why, there'd
be no house to sleep in if it wasn't for
you!"
Old Bill was a long time getting Intc
bed. Like to a child he sank Into a
peaceful slumber, his softened spirit
in radiant dreams wandering througt
that "upper room" filled with the souls
of those, however humble, who har
helped to make true "Peace on earti
good will to men."

"Our baby weighs eleven pounds,"
confessed Proudpap, "and I am almost
worn out walking the floor with him

"H'm," returned old Balderson, the

weighs but six pounds?"

grass beside him was the ass that car

donkey was old, and, as Doyle would
say, "as cute as himself." One day"
an English tourist Aanced to come
the way, and the ass, seeing him ap
proach, began to bray loud and long.
The tourist, coming up to Doyle,
asked:
"Why does that old ass bray at see

HARD TO DROP
But Many Drop It.
"It was hard to drop Mocha and
Java and give Postum a trial, but my
nerves were so shattered that I was a
nervous wreck and of course that
means all kinds of ails.
"I did not want to acknowledge cof
fee caused the trouble for I was very
fond of it. At that time a friend
came to live with us, and I noticed
that after he had been with us a week
he would not drink his coffee any
more. I asked him the reason. He
replied: T have not had a headache
since I left off drinking coffee, some
months ago, till last week, when I be
gan again here at your table. I don't
see how anyone can like coffee, any
way, after drinking Postum!'
"I said nothing, but at once ordered
a package of Postum. That was five
mdnths ago, and we have drank no
coffee since, except on two occasions
when we had company, and the result
each time was that my husband could
not sleep, but lay awake and tossed
and talked half the night. We were
convinced that coffee caused his suf
fering, so he returned to Postum, con
vinced that coffee was an enemy, in
stead of a friend, and he is troubled
no more by insomnia.
"I have gained S pounds in weight,
and my nerves have ceased to quiver.
It seems so easy now to quit coffee
that caused our aches and ails and
take up Postum." Name given by
