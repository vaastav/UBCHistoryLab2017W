The message says congress is called to

elevated, while his public career was even
distinguished by large capacity, stainless
Integrity and exalted motives.
FINANCIAL CONDITION.
Our Commerce Mi own Cireat Increase
Itecummi-nd the Gold Standard.
The country is in a condition of unusual
prosperity, of universal good will among
the people at home and in relations of
peace and friendship with every (joveru
ment in the world. Our foreign commerce
has shown threat increase. Combined im
ports are the largest ever shown by a sin
fc'le year in all our history. For 1:'9 a-o;ie
they exceeded by more than $l,(M,Au-eo
our imports and exports combined in 1S7U.
Of manufactured products we exported
f33i?,5KM-tii. The only years in all our his
tory when the products or our manu
factories sold abroad exceeded thofce
bought abroad were 1S and isHl.
Government receipts, including $H -71M.31-i.14,
part payment of the Central Pa
cific railroad indebtedness, aggregated
til0,!S2,W)4.3f. Customs receipts were i"2iri,
12S.481.75, and those from internal revenue
were $273, 4:57,101. fd.
For the fiscal year the expenditures
were $70U,533,504.U2, leaving a deficit of
111,50.67.
The secretary of the treasury estimates
that the receipts for the current lineal
year will leave a surplus of SH),W0.uu0. t or
the year ended June 30, lv.-i), the intern;;!
revenue receipts were increased about
JIOO.OOO.COO.
The present gratifying strength of the
treasury is shown by the fact that on De
cember 1, ISittt, the available cash baluue
was $27S,(HM,7.72, of which $23:,7i l.TOiW
was in gold coin and bullion. Customs re
ceipts are now almost entirely paid in
gold.
Receipts exceeded expenditures for the
first five months of the current iiscal year
by $1C,-I13,asi.91, and the secretary of the
treasury estimates that there will be a
surplus of $40,Oi.O,UUO at the end of the year.
It was deemed advisable to resume com
pliance with the sinking fund law, ig
nored for eight years because of deficien
cies. The treasury department purchased
during November SiS.l'JS.OOO cf bonds, ma
turing 1!04 and 11)07.
The premium paid was S2,2-"3.321, nnd t '.te
net saving in itHerest was about $2,SSi,'W0.
Increased activity in industry, with its
welcome attendant, a larger employment
for labor at higher wages, gives to the
body of the people a larger power to ab
sorb the circulating medium. Congress is
Invited to ascertain whether or not sucli
reasonable modilications can fie made in
the national banking act as will render its
service more responsive to the people's
needs. The president again urges that na
tional banks be authorized to organize
with a capital of $2S,000, and that to
support the existing gold standard and to
maintain "the parity in value of the coins
of gold and silver and the equal power of
every dollar in the market and in the pay
ment of debts," the secretary of the treas
ury be charged with the duty to sell Unit
ed States bonds and to employ such other
effietive means as may be necessary io
these ends. While there is now no com
mercial fright, the present is the most
liting time to make adequate provision to
insure the continuance of the confidence
In the ability and purpose of the govern
ment to meet all its obligations in the
money "which the civilized world recog
nizes as the best."
"The financial transactions of the gov
ernment are conducted upon a gold
basis," the president says. "We receive
gold when we sell I'nited States bonds
and use gold for their payment. We are
maintaining the parity of all the money
issued or coined by authority of the gov
ernment. We are doing these things with
the means at hand. Happily, at the pres
ent time, we are not compelled to resort
ta loans to supply gold. It may have had
to De none in tne luture. it behooves us,
therefore, to provide at once the best
means to meet the emergency when it
arises. Those now authorized have the
virtue neither of directness nor economy.
"In this connection, I repeat my former
recommendation that a portion of the gold
holdings shall be placed in a trust fund,
from which greenbacks shall be redeemed
upon presentation, but when once re
deemed shall not thereafter bo paid out
except for gold."
The value of an American merchant ma
rine to the extension of our commercial
trade and the strengthening of our puwi-r
upon the sea invites the immediate action
of congress.
The past year has recorded exceptional
activity in our ship yards. ur coa.it
trade shows results for the past year
ur.equaled in our records or those nf anv
other power. We shall fail to realize
our opportunities, however, if we blind
ourselves to the necessity of securing our
share in the valuable carrying trade of
the world.
"Last year American vessels transported
n. smaller share of our exports and im
ports than during any former year in ail
our history, the president says, and the
measure of our dependence upon foreign
shipping was painfully manifested to our
people. The other great nations have not
hesitated to adopt thy required means
to develop their shipping as a factor in
national defense, and, as one of the surest
anil speediest means of obtaining for their
producers a fhare in foreign markets.
I.ike vigilance and effort on our part can
not fail to improve our situation, which
Is regarded with humiliation at home
and with surprise abroad. Kven the seem
ing sacrifices which at the beginning may
tie involved will be offset later by more
than equivalent gains. I am satisfied t'te
judgment of the country favors the policv
of aid to our merchant marine."
OUR RELATIONS WITH lUK I.
We Must See That Free Cuba be a Kealltj,
Not a Hasty Experiment.
In Ihe joint resolution adopted by the
congress on April 1'.', ISisS, the l'nlte-1
States disclaimed any disposition or in
tention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdic
tion of control over Cuba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted its de
termination when that was accomplished
to leave the government and control of
the island to its people. "The pledge con
tained In this resolution," the president
Bays "is of the highest honorable obliga
tion, and must be sacredly kept. I "be
lieve that substantial progress has been
made in this direction. All the adminis
trative measures adopted in Cuba have
aimed to fit it for a. regenerated exist,
ence. This nation has assumed befoie
the world a grave responsibility for the
future good government of Cuba. We
have accepted a trust, the fulfillment of
which calls for the sternest integrity of
purpose and the exercise of the highest
wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from
the ashes of the past must needs be bound
to us by ties of singular intimacy and
strength if its enduring welfare is to be
assured. We must see to it that free
Cuba be a reality, not a name, a perfect
entity, not a hasty experiment bearing
within Itself the elements of failure. The
greatest blessing which can come to Cuba
is the restoration of her agricultural and
industrial prosperity, which will give em
ployment to idle men and re-establish the
pursuits of peace. This is her chief and
Immediate need. The census of the isl
and was completed on November 30. By
the treaty of peace, the Spanish people
on the island have until April 11. 1M0. to
elect whether they will remain citizens of
Spain or become citizens of Cuba, lit
that time the results of the census will
have been tabulated, and we shall pro
ceed to provide for elections, which will
commit the municipal governments of the
island to the officers elected bv the peo
ple. The experience thus acquired will
prove of great value, establishing a gen
eral system of independent government
for the island. So long as we exercise
control over the island the products of
Cuba should have a market in the United
States on as good terms and with as fa
vorable taxes of duty as are given to the
West Indian Islands under treaties at
rMtttrtttity which shall b mada,"

The Story of Mt 1'her Were Ac
quired Ui-latrd, and the Part
Attninaldu Has 1'lnyedi
The treaty of peace between the Vnited
States and Spain provided that Spain
should ced to the I'nited States the arelr
ipelaeo Known as the Philippine island?,
that the United States should pav Bpaia
$20,000,000, and that the civil rights and
political status f the native inhabitants
of the territories thus ceded to the United
Btt:s should be determined by congress
"I had every reason to believe," the pres
ident says, "and 1 still believe that this
transfer of sovereignty was in accordance
with the wishes and the aspirations of
the great mass of the Filipino people.
From the earliest moment no opportuni
ty was lost of assuring them of our ard
dent desire for their welfare. In my orisr
of May 1, IS'js, the commander of tne mil
itary expedition was instructed to say
that we came not to make war upon the
people of that country, 'nor upon the
purty or faction among them, but to pro
tect them in their homes, in their em
ployments, and in their personal and re
ligious rights.' That there should be no
doubt as to the paramount authority
there, on the 17th day of August it waa
directed that 'there must be no joint oc
cupation with the insurgents,' that the
United States must preserve the peace
within the territory occupied by their
military and naval forces; that the in
surgents and all others must recognize
the militaiy occupation and authority of
the United States.
On the 21st of December, after the
treaty was signed, the commander of the
forces of occupation was instructed 'lo
announce and proclaim in the most pub
lic manner that welcome, not as invadern.
as conquerors, but as friends, lo protect
the natives in their homes, in their em
ployments, and in their personal and re
ligious rights.' On the same day, while
ordering (Jen. Otis to see that the peace
should be preserved in Iloilo, he was ad
monished that it is most important lhat
there should be no conflict with the in
surgents.' On the 21-st of January 1 an
nounced my intention of dispatching to
Manila a commission comjiosed of three
gentlemen of the highest character and
distinction, thoroughly acquainted with
the orient, who, in association with Ad
miral Dewey and Jlaj.-Gen. Otis, were in
structed 'to facilitate the most humane
and effective extension of authority
throughout the islands, and to secure
with the least possible delay the bcu?!Us
of a wise and gem-rous protection of lu'e
and property to the inhabitants.
I'roiuiKcM In Avui.taldif.
"While the treaty of peace was under
consideration in the senate these commis
sioners set out on their mission of go j l
will and liberation. I!ut before their ar
rival at Manila the sinister ambition of a
few leaders of the Filipinos had created a
situation full of embarrassment for us and
most grievous in its consequences u
themselves, 'the claim of the rebel let-tier
that he was promised independence by
any officer of the United States in rtturn
for his assistance has no foundation in
fact and is categorically denied by the
very witnesses who were called to j.reve
it. The most the insurgent leader liopcd
for w hen he came back to Manila wus
the liberation of the islands from the
Spanish control, which they had been la
boring for years without success to throw
off. The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
gave him other ideas and ambitions. Mild
insidious suggestions from various quar
ters perfected the purposes and intention.;
with which he hail taken up arms. No
seoner had our army captured -Manila
than the Filipino forces began to assunu
an attitude of suspicion and hostility
which the utmost efforts of our olUieis
and troops were unable to disarm or
modify. Their kindness and forebearauce
were taken as proof of cowardice.
The America .-is AllncUed.
"The aggressions of the Filipinos con
tinually increased until, finally, just be
fore the time set by the senate of the
United States fur a vote upon the treaty,
an attack, evidently preparti-d in idv::u:"
was made all along the American iin s.
which resulted in a terribly destruetiv:
atld sanguinary repulse of the iiiourgeijis.
Ten days later an order of the insur
gent government was issued to its adher
ents who had remained in Manila. i:i
which lieu. Otis justly observes that "for
baibarous intent it is uin-iualed in
modern tim.-s. It directs that at 8
o'clock on the night of the lf.tii cf Feb
ruary, the 'territorial militia' shall come
together in the streets of San IV.fr i,
armed with their bolus, with guns and
ammunition where convenient; that Fili
pino families only shall he respected, but
that all other individuals, of what.-ver
race they may be, shall be exterminated
without any compassion after the exterm
ination '-f the army of occupation, and
adils: 'llrofhers. we must avenge our
selves on tile Americans and exterminate
them, that w- may take chip revenge tor
the infamies and treacheries, which til y
have committed upon us. Have no com
passion upon them: attack with vigor.'
"A copy of tiiis fell by good fortune in
to the hands of our officers, and ihy were
able to take measures to control the ris
ing, which was actually attempted on the
night of February 22. a week' l.-it-r than
was originally contemplated. Omsid -cable
numbers of armed insurgents entered
the city by waterways an.l swamps, and,
in concert with confederates inside, at
tempted to destroy Manila by tire. Th- y
were Kent in cheek during the night au'l
the next day driven out of the city with
heavy loss.
The Commissioners' Story.
"This was the unhappy condition -if af
fairs which confronted our commission
ers. Wtiat they actually found can best:
be set forth m th' lr own words:
" 'Deplorable as war is, th- one in which
we are now engaged, was unavoidable b'.'
us. We were attacked by a bold adven
turous and enthusiastic army. No al
ternative was left to us except ignomin
ous retreat.
" 'It is not to be conceived of that anv
American would have san tinned the sur
render of Manila to the Insurgents. Our
obligations lo other nations and to the
friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and
our flag demanded that force should i,c
met by force. There has been no time
since the destruction of the Spani: h
squadron by Admiral Dewey when it was
possible to withdraw our force.-" f'r.m the
island, either with honor to ourselves or
with safety to the inhabitants.'
"The course thus dearly indicated tias
been unflinchingly pursued. The- rr-bd-lion
must bo put down. Civil government
can not be thoroughly established until
order is restored.
"The unfavorable circumstances con
nected with an active campaign have nat
been permitted to Interfere with the
equally important work of reconstruction.
A notable beginning has been made in t:ie
establishment of a government in the is

prices are unduly- enhanced to the gen

to the common law, but also to public

possesses over this most important sub

asserted. An act to protect trade and
commerce against unlawful restraint and
monopolies was passed by congress n

in the restraint of trade or commerce
among the several states or with foreign

A definite project for a permanent inter

the instructions to the peace delegate of
the United States. The convention for tho
pacific settlement of international con
flicts embodies the ieading features of the
American plan with such modification as
were rendered necessary by the great di
versity of views and interests represented;
by the delegates. The mediation provided
for by the convention is purely voluntary
and advisory. The delegation of the Unit
ed States was not unmindful of the in
convenience which must arise from an
obstructive exercise of mediation, and in
signing the convention carefully guarded
the historic position of the United States
by the following declaration: "Nothing
in this convention shall be so construed
as to require the United States of Ameri
ca to depart from its traditional policy
of not intruding upon, interfering with,
tir entangling itself in the political ques
tions or policy of internal adminint ration
of foreign ftutcs; nor shall anything con
tained in said convention be construed
to imply a relinquishment by the Unite!
States of America of its traditional atti

On the 3Jth of June, lSl't', the pension rll
of Hie United States numbered Sial.id'..
These include the pensioners of the army
and navy in all our wars. The number
added to the rolls during the year was
40,1)111. The number dropped by reason
of death, remarriage, minors by egal
limitation, failure to claim within three
years, and other causes, was 4".lSfi, ami
the number of claims disallowed was li7 -!10.
Durlntr the vear 811.051 pension certi.i-
cates were issued, of which 32.077 were for
new or original pensions. The amount
disbursed for army and navy pensions
during the year was $138,355,052.95, which
was $l,G51.4';i.i:l less than the sum of I ho
appropriations. With the approval of tho
secretary of the interior, the commission
er of pensions recommends that, in order
to make the practice at all times uniform
and do justice to the dependent widc-v,
the amount of income allowed, independ
ent of the proceeds of her daily labor,
should not be less than $250 per annum,
ami he urges that the congress shall s
amend the act as to permit the pension
office to grant pensionable status to
widows under the terms of the third sec
tion of the act of June 27, l!i;0, whose in
come, aside from the proceeds of daily
labor, is not in excess of $250 per annum.

The domestic postal service continues to
grow with extraordinary rapidity. The
expenditures and the revenues will eacn
exceed $ioo,DeO,oOO during the current year.
Since the revival of prosperous timer., the
revenues have grown much faster than
the expenditures. Some classes of mail
matter wrongly exercise the privilege of
the pound rate which it should have paid,
instead of a postal deficit for the last hs
cal year of S'i.iilO.Oiw, there would Have
been on one basis a surplus of $17,037.57'',
and on another of $5,733.0. The reform
thus suggested, in the opinion of the port
master general, would not only put the
postal service at once on a self-sustaining
basis, but would permit great and valua
ble improvements.

The navy has maintained the spirit nnd
high efficiency which have always char
acterized that service, and has lost none
of the gallantry in heroic action which
has signalized its brilliant and glorious
past. The officers have shown peculiar
adaptation for the performance of new
and delicate duties which our recent war
has imposed. It can not be doubted that
congress will at once make necessary pro
vision for the armor plate for the vessels
now under contract and building. Pro
vision of the act of March 3. 1:!.. limit'e.g
the price of armor to $300 per ton sh.iulj
