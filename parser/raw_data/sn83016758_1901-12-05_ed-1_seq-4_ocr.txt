HE farm institute season has opened
and the milk-maid and the cow will be
star attractions for awhile.
HE Minneapolis Times has much
improved the appearance of its face
by anew head which is more metro
politan, and is clean cut and neat.
THE Braham Journal this week pass
ed into the hands of Wilbur Folsom,
who founded the paper. Braham is a
lively little town and Mr. Folsom is
going back to his first love with the
best of prospects.
FOLLOWING close on the heels of the
St. Louis world's fair in 1903 to cele
brate the Louisiana purchase will come
the centennial celebration in 1905 of
the Lewis and Clark expedition into
Oregon territory. Portland will do
the honors.
HE postal department of the gov
ernment is thinking of having its own
free rural delivery mail boxes and
renting them to patrons of the service
at a reasonable rental. This is proper.
The way it is now farmers are bored
to death with the box solicitor and
then there are all kinds, shapes and
conditions of boxes with no uniformity
whatever. One good serviceable box
should be selected and used by the
government in the free rural service.
ACCORDING to the record of Indian
Agent Simon Michelet of White Earth
who paid the Mille Lacs Indians last
week, there are 923 Indians located at
Mille Lacs lake, or who make their
home there. We thought last week
when our Vineland correspondent said
that 700 Indians would be paid off that
the number was somewhat exaggerat
ed, but it seems that the estimate was
close to the truth. No wonder that
the Mille Lacs lake people want the
Indians removed.
IT IS not every Minnesota editor that
bmallpox cares to tackle, but it seems
that Pea&e of the Anoka Union was
not immune and contracted the disease
a short time ago while on a trip to
Minneapolis. He is now about re
covered. No one would have ever
suspected that the veteran editor of
the Union had been laid up with small
pox as he did not allow the columns of
his paper to suffer any from the effects
of his illness It would take something
worse than smallpox to knock Pease
out of the editorial chair.
HE international live stock exposi
tion which was opened at Chicago on
the first and continues this week is the
biggest live stock event of the times,
and Chicago has done herself proud in
putting up such a big show of the finest
types of live stock in the country.
Here the range and the blue grass
pasture, and the feed lots and meadows
of the middle west place their live
stock on exhibition that the world may
see what great strides we are making
in ln stock production. The agri
cultural experiment station of Minne
sota sent down some cattle, hogs and
sheep and carried off second honors in
Shorthorn steers or spayed heifers,
"Crimson Babe" a choice chunk of a
Shorthorn taking the honors for the
State in this class. In hogs Minne
sota secured five firsts and five second
prizes. Canada carried away the hon
ors in the -Shropshire sheep exhibit,
though the American breeders gave
the old time Canadian breeders with
their many trophies a good hard rub.
HE awful railroad wreck in Michi
gan last week which resulted in the
death and injury of so many persons,
adds another blood-curdling chapter to
railroad horrors. It does seems as if
such accidents could be avoided. There
is not enough check and counter-check
in vogue by railroads in running trains.
It is often the case that .an order is
handed to the conductor who hastily
reads it, and gives the engineer a copy,
who in his haste may misread it, or
from illness or fatigue may misinter
pret or forget it. There should be a
rule compelling the conductor and en
gineer to verify and compare their
orders, and in the presence of a third
partya brakeman or a fireman. In
this manner many an important train
order would be thoroughly impressed
upon the mind of both the engineer
and conductor, and it would seem that
many expensive railroad wrecks and
terrible loss of life could be avoided.
In trying to annihilate time and space
without more thorough precautions,
the railroads are paying very dearly at
times, and making veritable slaughter
houses of their trains.

CONGRESS AND THE MESSAGE.
With the senate and house chambers
newly decorated and re-fitted and an
air of freshness and newness to bright
en up the halls where our law-makers
sit, the fifty-seventh congress ,con
vened at noon on Monday and the great,
law-making body soon settled down to
preliminary business. Speaker Hen
derson was re-elected as presiding
officer of the house, receiving 190 votes
while Richardson of Tennessee, re
ceived 149 votes from the opposition.
Representative Bingham, "father of
the house," administered the oath to
the speaker, who in turn swore in the
members-elect.
Senator Foraker offered a resolution
that a committee of eleven senators
be appointed to join with a committee
from the house to consider and report
"by what token of respect and affec
tion it may be proper for the congress
to express the deep sensibility of the
nation to the tragic death of the late
president, William McKinley." The
house adopted a similar resolution and
will name a member from each state
to serve on the committee.
On Tuesday the president's message
was read to congress, and a condensed
report of this message will be found
in this issue. The president refers to
the taking off of the late president and
pays his predecessor a grand eulogy.
He bitterly denounces anarchy and
says it should be made an offense
against the law of nation, like piracy
and that form of man stealing known
as the slave trade. He refers to the
tremendous and highly complex in
dustrial development of the latter half
of the past century that has brought
us face to face with very serious social
problems. Old laws and customs are
no longer sufficient to regulate and
govern trade conditions and the amas
sing of corporate wealth and influence
and present conditions call for new
methods of controlling corporation
power. "The creation of these great
corporate fortunes are not due to the
tariff or governmental action, but to
natural causes in the business world."
The president says it is not true that
the rich have grown richer and theJustice
poor poorer, but on the contrary the
average wage earner is better off now
than he ever was before. One of the
great evils at the present time is over
capitalization and efforts should be
made to correct these abuses. He
suggests that if there is not sufficient
federal power to properly control the
large corporate interests and their ex
panding trade which is all the result
of State and federal license and lawthe
that a constitutional amendment be
adopted that will give congress and
the federal government all due power.
The president says that the first essen
tial dealing with these big interests
is publicity which will give the proper
officials a knowledge of the true facts.
There is as much necessity to rid the
business world of the crimes of cun
ning as to rid the entire body politic
of the crimes of violence.
President Roosevelt is in favor of re
enacting the Chinese exclusion law ia
the interest of American labor, and in
his treatment of the labor question he
deals in a very fair and equitable man
ner with all interests. He belives that
our immigration laws should be amend
ed so as to keep out all classes of a low
moral tendency, as well ns anarchists
As to tariff he is not in favor of any
general tariff change at the present
time as he believes it would disturb the
business interests of the country. In
the matter of reciprocity he believes it
should be treated as the handmaiden
of protection, and the welfare of our
home industries should be the first and
most important consideration. He is
in favor of building up our merchant
maritfe and would not be against the
proposition of a ship subsidy of the
proper kind. The navy should be
strengthened by adding 4,000 addition
al seamen and 1,000 marines, as well as
by building more ships. He does not
think it necessary to increase the army
beyond its present size.
As to currency and finance the pres
ident is of the qpinion there is need of
bettor safeguards against the derang
ing influenceof commercial crises and
financial panics. He is strongly in fa
vor of &] system of irrigation lor the
arid lands of the west and thinks that
the government should put these lands
in a condition that would permit the
settler to cultivate them. He is also
strongly in favor of forest protection merce and industry, and the bill will,
and the construction of storage works in all probability, pass congress this
session. President Roosevelt is in favor
necessary to equalize the flow of streams
in flood and replenishing them in the of establishing a bureau of this char

ports into the United States. For the

As to Cuba he refers to the vital need Jooking after the commercial and in
of providing for a substantial reduc- iustrial affairs of the country. We
have grown to be a nation of such vast
commercial resources that a bureau of
people of the Philippines he says that this kind is needed. Our commerce and

before been done for any people of the gress must do something to cacth up
tropics, and that is to make them fit with present conditions.
It will thus be seen that notwithstand
ing Porto Rico and the Philippines are
domestic territory, that the supreme
court has left plenty of room for con
gress to act in the matter of raising rev
enues and controlling the foreign trade
of our insular possessions. Congress
can now see its way clear to go ahead
and legislate for the Philippines, and
opinions of the supreme court have
established a working basis for the
government. The framers of the con
stitution never dreamed of any such
contingencies arising as have arisen in
the last two years, or they would have
made matters a little plainer when the
great document wa drafted. But as it
is the nation is perfectly able to meet
all the exigencies that arise.
THE PRINCETON UNION:^ THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5,1901.
for self government after the fashion
of the really free nations. He defines
the Monroe doctrine as civil and com
mercial freedom of all countries on the
western hemisphere. The isthmian
canal and the Pacific cable are recom
mended, and he strongly urges that the
merit system be extended to all the
branches of the government.
The message while lacking in cer
tain radical features which the public
had been expecting, and while not a
finished State paper, is a well balanced
and good, sound and conservative mes
sage. It smacks of honesty and sincer
ity and goes as far as existing condi
tions would seem to warrant.
PHILIPPINES DOMESTIC TERRITORY.
HE Hubbard County Enterprise is
sued a handsome industrial edition
the week of Nov. 22d. It consisted of
eight pages, printed on heavy book
paper and lavishly illustrated with
handsome half-tone cuts. The edition
is the finest ever turned out by a north
ern Minnesota weekly, and we are
pretty safe in saying that no one-color
edition of any Minnesota newspaper
ever excelled it in point of artistic
merit. Henry R. Cobb who founded
the Enterprise years ago, but who af
terwards sold out to W. J. Conrad, has
again assumed entire control of the pa
per. The writer recalls with a smile
the time twenty years or more ago
when with the present publisher of the
Enterprise we ran a little amateur
shop in the rear of an old frame shanty
which stood where now towers the
Boston block in Minneapolis. We dis
tinctly remember of leaving a fifty-cent
piecethe entire financial assets of the
firmin the office over Sunday for
weal or woe, and it proved the latter,
as some evil genius stole the piece of
silver. Perhaps he wanted it worse
than the firm of Cobb & Wright, and
if he did, he needed it very badly and
for our part we forgive him, and pre
sume our old partner has long since
done the same. The Shell prairies
have proved a good stepping stone to
Mr. Cobb and may the Enterprise en
ter for more prizes.
SENATOR NELSON has Introduced a

The supreme court of the United
States in a decision handed down last
Monday says that the Philippines are
domestic territory. In his opinion
Justice Fuller said that the Philippine
islands ceased to be foreign territory The Schley-Sampson controversy has

was signed.
The decision was the result of a case
that went to the supreme court, and
which involved the right of the cus
tom officials at Chicago to sieze four
teen diamond rings which a North Da
kota volunteer had brought back with
him and on which the duty had not
been paid. Justice Brown read an
opinion concurring in the result, but as a matter of fact it was only one of
differing from the conclusions drawn
on minor points. Justices Gray, Shi
ras, White and McKenna dissented.
Another case disposed of by the su
preme court was one where a New Yom them up while the tariff gate is open,
firm shipped to its agents in Porto Ri- for we are to enjoy a brief spell of free
co a bill of goods and on which the ex
port duties were collected at the port
of entry in Porto Rico under the pro
visions of the Foraker act, providing
for revenues for the island. The New
York firm refused to pay the duties
and took the matter to the supreme
court which decides that the law was
good, though the chief justice and jus
tices Harlan, Brewer and Peckham dis
sented. Justice White concurred, but
delivered his own opinion, arriving at
his decision along different lines than
Brown who delivered the opin
ion.
I RUM'INATIONS. I
llWWWW irt'M'*WrtWinwkw*wii
A forger is most always in a pensive
mood.
China is preparing for war again.
Who can tael what the result will be?
The president's message was not on
the bucking broncho order that many
supposed it would be.
Look out for foul weather in St. Paul
next month. The annual poultry show
will be held at that time.
G. O. P. stands for "get out. please,"
to the Democrats and the political pig
mies that stand around looking for
spilt milk.
The Philippines are declared to be
domestic territory, but then they are
so far away that they will always have
a foreign flavor.
yet. Why not pass it on to the Smith
sonian institute?
The eastern people do not take kind
ly to western irrigation. They think
a pond or two way down east is enough
water for the whole nation.
People in Chicago are averring that
they saw a big comet recently, when
the city water microbes in a flying ma
chine.
If you have any Christmas presents
coming from the Philippines hurry
trade.
The Dingley tariff will not be taken
to the repair shop this time, as the ex
perts say it does not need any new riv
ets, screws, bolts, ball bearings or any
thing of the sort.
Congressman Tawney has again been
made the party whip for the present
session of congress. The statesman
from Winona always was more or less
of a crack-a-jack.
When Mrs. Murphy went over into
Mrs. Flannigan's back yard with a big
wash and proceeded to use her neigh
bor's line she remarked to herself that
this merging business was the spirit of
the age.
It is said that J. P. Morgan, the
husky financier who welds trusts and
deals in "octopi" spends $200 a day on
his table. How some tramp would like
to trade stomachs with Mr. Morgan
just for an hour or two.
"What are you in here for?" asked
the bad looking prisoner of a pale-faced
little woman, who replied: "For shop
lifting." "Well, mine is a little heav
ier occupation," answered the bad-themselves
looking man, "I hold up trains."
It is amusing to see the many ways
that are taken by game dealers and
shippers to evade the game laws. We
believe they have shipped game in
about everything except coffins, and
we expect to hear of some game war
den breaking through the crowd of
mourners at the union depot in St.
Paul some time and exposing the game
corpse of northern Minnesota.
Briggs, the Minneapolis slot machine
artist, whom Sheriff Megaarden got
after and caused Briggs an awful lot
of trouble, which sent him to the work
house for six months and compelled him
to pay a heavy fine, is now fireman at
the "works", while as a sequel to the
pernicious activity of the sheriff is the
spectacle of Megaarden being obliged
to cough up several thousand dollars
of fees illegally appropriated to his pri
vate bank account, and to-day standing
suspended under orders of the govern
or, pending a hearing that may oust
the sheriff from his office. Megaarden
refuses to give up his office and has in
trenched himself in the county jail,
while the coroner who is supposed to
act as sheriff is trying to find the polit
ical corpse in order to hold an inquest.
Political sensations in Hennepin are
at present lively enough for the aver
age student of civic affairs.
