The Democratic Advocate.
WESTMINSTER, MD.
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 14.1906
Resident's Message to Congress.
The message of the President at the
opening of the present session of Congress,
is a document which presents a queer ad
mixture of good and bad. There are
many recommendations in the message
which an- highly commendable, and we
would not, in any partizan way, adversely
criticise that which we belive is good.
But there are positions assumed by the
President that smack so much of centrali
zation of power, that the American people
should be alarmed at his utterances. His
course since he became President has
been to gather within himself powers which
rightfully belong to other co-ordinate
branches of the government, and these
have been so pronounced as to raise oppo
sition upon the part of some of the more
conservative members of his own parly in
Congress.
Our Fathers in framing a constitution
for the government of the country, wisely
divided the federal powers into three dis
tinct general classes—the Executive, the
Legislative and the Judicial. And the
history of the country, especially under
Democratic administrations, shows a scrup
ulous regard for these distinctions, so that
the one might not encroach upon the other.
It is the province of the legislative depart
ment to consider and pass all laws. These
are sent to the President for his approval.
If he disapproves, he is required to send
the bill back to the House in which it
originated, when if two-thirds of both
Houses agree to the bill it becomes a law,
notwithstanding the President’s disap
proval.
The Judicial department of the govern
ment, upon application, passes upon the
constitutionality of laws passed by the
Congress. Where there is no application
to the Court for legal construction, or
where legal construction is had and the law
is upheld, it simply remains for the Exe
cutive to see that it is properly executed.
Any attempt upon the part of the Presi
dent to take to himself the functions of
either of the other departments is a usur
pation of power, not contemplated nor
permitted by the Constitution and danger
ous to the liberties of the people.
The True Basis of Peace Among
Nations.
Physical force never settles any ques
tion of right or wrong, either among men
or nations. It may settle the question of
mere brute force, but leaves the real ques
tion in the controversy, untouched.
The position of President Roosevelt upon
this subject is rather anomalous.
. He has done much to promote the work
of the Hague tribunal, which was organ
ized in the interest of peace, and the set
tlement of all disputes among nations, by
arbitration. He took a conspicuous part
in the final settlement of the war between
Russia and Japan, and merited and re
ceived the praise of his countrymen for so
doing.
Notwithstanding this attitude toward
peace, his idea seems to be that this nation
of ours should be thoroughly equipped for
war, and that this state of preparation is
a means of promoting peace.
In line with this idea, he suggests in his
message that “we should establish shooting
galleries in all the large public and military
schools, should maintain national target
ranges in different parts of the country,
and should in every way encourage the
formation of rifle clubs throughout all parts
of the land. ’ ’
In other words he would make our
country a vast camp of young riflemen,
and all in the interest of peace. We think
the position of the President is utterly
fallacious. Instead of promoting peace it
would, without doubt, promote the spirit
of Jingoism. Men generally, and espec
ially young men are taken with the mili
tary idea. No hero is so worshipped as the
military hero. And when a nation feesl it
self strong and ready for war, that nation is
very apt to go to war upon the slightest
provocation. We would not underestimate
the necessity for having a proper and even
a strong Navy, for the protection of our
seaboard cities from attack by a foreign
foe. But our experience in the past has
proven that for inland defence and protec
tion we need a very small standing army.
And President Roosevelt had better coun
sel our boys to go along with their geogra
phy and grammar and mathematics and
let the rifles alone.
The true basis of peace among nations
is to be found in reason and common sense.
In all wars, after the horrible slaughter
has done its work of desolating homes and
making widows and orphans, the contend
ing parties must come to this tribunal for
terms of peace. Why not go there first,
and let disinterested persons settle the dis
pute without going to war?
In the opening of this twentieth century,
the dominant thought of the nations should
be, —Arbitration of all disputes in the
forum of reason. It is a shame upon our
civilization, that after the lapse of two
thousand years since the angels from heaven
sang out the sweet notes of * ‘peace on earth
and good will to men” we find, nominally,
Christian nations still ready to go to war
and cat each other’s throats.
