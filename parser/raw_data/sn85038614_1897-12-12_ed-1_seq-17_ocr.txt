JOIIX FOX, JR., AND SAM JOXES.
The Antlior anil Evniiorell?. Apprnr
in Richmond To-Morrow Evening.
To-morrow evening at H:'A> o'clock the
third entertainment ot the Lyceum Course
will be given at the Academy of Music.
Mr. John Vox. Jr., of Kentucky, will
make, his appearance before a Richmond
addiaaes for the first time. Mr. Fox Is
a BOW star, and n very bright one, which
has burst forth In the lit? ra'ry firmament
Through his delightfully entertaining BBd
strong ?tortea of life among the Cumber?
land mountain? of hi? native Stat.
has become an inmate and a friend at
the fireside of many households through?
out this country. "Hell fer Sartaln" and
"A Cumberland Vendetta" are among
hi? best-known stories. They have given
him a secure position among the best
family of literary workers of to-day.
They are full of movement, brimming
with a strong portrayal of human nature
In Its more rugged phases, all faithfully
told In the dialect of the persona of
tlu-m. He will r?ad from his own best
works, embracing: 1. "The Kentuckluns."
? ?uvul; 2. "A jVuwLu'iuuU. .Yk-U-.U*'' juid
other stories (Harp.r & Brother?;, In?
clining "A Mountain Europa," "A Cum?
berland Vend'tta," "The I.ast Stetson";
3. "Hell fer Bartaln" and other stories
(Harper & Brothers), Including "Hell fer
Si i tain." "('ourtln' on Cutshin," "1'reach
In* on Kingdom Come." "A Trick o'
Trade," "The Mensng?. In the Kami," "The
F.i.-slng of Abe Shivers," etc.; 4. from
stories yet unpubllsh? d.
I?r. Thomas Nelson Page says of Mr.
Fox: "He ha? a eb-ar, musical voice, of
great ?-sweetness as well as carrying
power; he understands the ?lialeot of the
mountaineers of Virginia and Kentucky
as few people in this ? ountry do, and he
[fei (?y natural. I feel BUTS that he
\iill prove one of the most popular read?
ers In this eouitry."
.Mr. Fox Is quite a young man y t. BS
w.i- at Harvard College, where
h.? was known as an all-'round athlete.
They learned ?.. regard him as such, not
knowing the hard, serious work which
Bs ?ll'l when once in his room. It was
their surpris?? when he took honors In
lea and had honorable mention In
Kri/li-h. His first lit.-rary work was
?lone on the local staff of the New York
Sun, un?! lroni his BSWepapor work he
turne?l to th?? more durable dialect story.
As s reader and lecturer Mr. Fox has
!.. b a pronoun -. Ills render?
ing of the mountain dialect Is simple and
unaffected, and rings as true as Mr.
PsgVa Bagro talk. Although immensely
dramatic in his Btort - not "elo
enti " nor hidalga in the blstrtaale, yet
there is a gaattty of sympathy In his
ami a magnetism about him that

BERDIX, December 11.?Throughout the
week a peculiar condition of affair? has
prevailed, so far as tho press Is con?
cerned. Tho "Chinese adventure." as the
Socialist Schoenlanck termed the seizure
of Kiao-Chau Hay, In tin? Keichstag, has
engrossed public inter?:st, yet the gov?
ernment has not deigned the least ex?
planation u3 to what hua been done or
88 to what Is intended lu the future.
What spanse information tho Foreign Of?
fice has furnished proved to be mislead?
ing or stale. This was especially the
case with the- Ha?tien Incident. The very
day the German sehoolships at I'ort-au
Priaoa aaeaxad oba?wmao to tba ultima?
tum, the government, through its various
organs, proclaimed that a naval demon?
stration was not likely, and that In any
.1 could not be reached for
several Weeks.
In regard to China, although the Eng?
lish praSS has bOSfl Itshdlty furnishing
ci' tails, the government liere claimi.-d not
t') have any advices from I'ekin as to
the r?-al condition of affBltB. As the
??erman Minn t- r to ?'hi?a, liaron Von
lle-yklng, had full power to deal with
the Ch?nese fllUBIIIBISHl as hO thought
b- it, this was a str?ng." condition Of af?

liaron YOB BUSIOW, the- Minister for For?

the Ret? hatag.
The various attempts of tho opposition
members of the Relohotag to draw out
the gOT? riitne-nts coursd during the week
Wale utihi-eelecl. The correspondent here
of the; ?BBOflSlSd Press, however, has
: aine,l from reliable aoofoes several
important facts. First, since Von Bue
losv has taken tho Foreign Office, tho
Emperor has not been penalttsd to med

losty was only lnl'ormeel of each Impor?

words, the Pkaparor has "approved," and

AXXF.XATIOX OK HAWAII.
Matter Mill He Considered Behind
< loieil ll'iora.
WASHINGTON. DeottasbOt 11.-The sup
porters of Hawaiian annexation have de
llnltely decided to consider the question
In executive session of the Senate. In
orlr to do this It will be necessary for
th. m to take up the annexation treaty
and introduce a Joint resolution proving
for annexation.
Some few of those who support Hawaii
In this matter were at first inclined to
believe that unless it became evident
that the two-third? vote necessary to
secure the ratification of the treaty was
assured from the beginning, It would be
a waste of time to take the matter up at
all upon the basis o( the treaty, but they
upp' ar to have changed their minds, or
to be at ! 'd to defer to the
opinion? of the majority, who oppose
this course.
It Is now stated, on behalf of the pro
annexutlonlsts, that to abandon the
treaty at the present time would create
the Impression that they had surrendered
the light entirely. Th?*y also think that
the consideration of the question in
secret session will ?erve to bind tho??
who profess to be favorable to annexa?
tion, and make sure of holding at least a
majority of the Senate for a resolution,
If it should In the end be made evident
that it 1? neces?ary to resort to thi?
m*BUM of aecuring favorable legislation.
There la also a still broader reason for
?eelrlng to have the treaty considered
***a>aiawa, ei?ee<L ill"*-* jrhlal* tf - - u '**ii JJfta
Committee on Foreign Relation?. Thl? Is
the fact that Japan's attitude toward
annexation I? auch as te involve some
delicate question?, which trie member?
of the committee think it not advisable
to air before the public in the way that
they might be aired if the matter ahould
be taken up for debate In open Senate.
The ?taunchest friends of annexation
admit that It will be well-nigh impossible
to ?ecure the two-third? vote necessary
to ratify the treaty, but they contend
that they will come very near reaching
the necessary number. Of the ?lxty vote?
Marp, they claim to have tirty-four
pltdged, and think it possible that they
might secure two or three m..,re vote?.
Their plan, however, contemplates a full
debate of the question of the treaty in
executive se?slon, and the subsequent
transfer of the matter, if necessary, to
the open Senate on a resolution similar
to thu by which T?*xas was annexed,
and the pressing of this resolution to a
speedy vote.
The resolution will require only a ma?
jority of the votes, but to be effective It
will be necessary that It should also
pass the House, where delay is feared.
