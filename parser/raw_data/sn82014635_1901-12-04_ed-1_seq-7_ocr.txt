COAL HAS BEEN FOUND
In Thin Veins Around This
City.
Ther has been a great deal of specula
tion lately over the prospects of find
ing ooal near Wichita, as well as oil or
gas. in tho last day or two this specula
tion has taken a little more definite form.
Mr. f; orgre Hayford has decided that
Irom all indications, there Is coal to be

Dr.
librarj-. He stated that the rooms had
been rearranged and that a number of
new improvements were under way. A
full report later. He gave it as his opin
ion that a good deal might be saved by
buying new books in preference to hav
ing oid ones rebound in a good many
cases. It was then moved that a number
of books that were at the present time in
bad condition should be sent to the dif
ferent schools which are maintaining li
braries at the present time. The mo
tion carried.
The committee on finance then reported
the bills that they had O. K"d. and they
were accepted by the board and ordered
paid. The total amount of expenditures
or the month were $3,7(2.81.
Principal Knight then made his report
which vf as accepted. He said in part:
The total enrollment of boys was 2,161;
of girls 2,402: total, 4.862. making a total
gain over last year at the same period of
226. The average attendance of the boys
is 1.891 ; of the girls. 2.1S7.3. The Fairmount
school takes the first place in the rank
of promptness, Washington second. In
the matter of attendance Fairmount and
Washington stand first with a record of
97. High school, Franklin and Lincoln?
second with a record of 95. Principal
Knight stated that he had visited all of
the schools four times during the month
and had found the work satisfactory.
It was then moved that steps be taken
to have the children subscribe to the fund
to erect a monument at McKlnley's home
in Canton.
Messrs, Rice, Jackman and Dr. Horner
were appointed as members of the visiting
board for the next three months, after
which quite a discussion was started by
Mr. Bell, who remarked that steps ought
to be taken to prevent the display of
goods that are being displayed daily on
the sidewalks of the city. He cited the
fact that a great many children when
passing along the streets see these things
and are tempted to take an apple or some
other little thing that pleases them ano
from this they are very apt to go to larger
things of a more valuable nature.
The last taing discussed was the ap
pointment of a truant officer. By motion,
however, it was agreed to ask the mayor
to have the entire police force on the
lookout for the children who are not in
school and o see why they are not in
school. There are some parents in this
city who ought to be prosecuted on the
ground that they do not send their chil
dren to school and it Would be a good
thing to do so was the sentiment of the
board. After some further discussion on
the matter the meeting adjourned.

WICHITA PET STOCK SHOW.
Annual
Exhibition to Be Held Here
next Week.
The third annual exhibition of fancy
pet stock is to be held In this city the
second week in December and it promises
to be the largest exhibition of its kind
held this year west of Chicago and the
biggest show ever held In Wichita. Last
year's show was a big success and was
visited by thousands of people who were
more than pleased with the highly enter
taining exhibit. The show Is given under
the auspices of the Arkansas valley
Pigeon Fanciers' Association, composed of
Wichita and Kansas pet stock fanciers.
The management will be under the per
sonal supervision of Mr. Charles Payne,
who has made the show business a study
and It is not necessary to say that lie
will put the enthusiasm in this to make
it a howling success. The secretary has
' already leceived entries of pets from
' some of the largest cities in the west,
j Oit Society of Chicago has taken a
deep interest In this exhibition and some
' of? the .finest cats from the ast are fix'
I iMx-tedihere. Sultdre.'Y.the great Persian
' cat from New Jersey is to be here and
he is considered one of the swellest cats
in cat society. He is a large black cat
with white points. Golden eyes and a
wry large bushy tail. This cat has won
laurels wherever shown. Among the
swellest soei-ty in the east "Augora cats"
are very fashionable and at all the pet
j .stock shews the society people take their
cats to the show, and it is expected that
i ono Udy from Chicago will send more
than a dozen different varieties to mis
exhibition.
Small dogs, that aro termed by the
fanciers "Toy Specimens" will also be
here and one man has said that he would
send a tine specimen imported from Eng
land that is valued at a $L0a.
'Ament in Bgle" the carrier pigeon
that brought the first message to Ameri
can soil, of the victory won at Santiago,
during the Spanish-American war, is also
expecte d to bo here. The managers have
asked the owners to shew him and they
have consented to do so.
There will also be an exhibition of over
ion different varieties of birds from Cuba,
Germany. China. England and America,
taking in all size's from the Cuban v ren
to the African Parrot. Mr. Carl Franz,
' of Milwaukee. Wis., win De nere mm
j forty Parlor Tumbler pigeons and give
an exhibition every afternoon in the show
room. These tumblers possess wings the
same as any other bird, but are consti
! tuted bv careful breeding so that they
have no use of them. They perform by
jumping up in the air about two or three
feet and turn over and over like an acro
bat. Mr. Franz thoroughly understands
the nature of this variety of pigeon and
will explain why they cannot fly. Mr.
Lane, foimeny o
hi Collection Of
England, win exniou
fancy rats and mice.
harnessed ana nueneu uj w m
I waeon which they araw iiKe a spjui oi
horses, fms will
be a great curiosity
that is worth going miles to see.
There will be an exhibit of taxidermy
and curies that have never been seen in
th west before.
Mr. Walter Jones will have on exhl
tion his collection of bird's eggs which
number over W and there are among
them some very rare specimens.
Here is a chance for every Wichita
person who has a pet to show them and
it should be done, as it is almost entirely
gotten up by Wichita fanciers. Mr. !.
E. Ward, the superintendent of the show,
will gladly give any information to those
who would like to show their pets. He
can be seen at HO North Emporia avenue
any day during the week. Entries for
competition for prises will close Monday
evening, December 10.

FOB ROUS REEHTS
Mr. Howard Teiis of Fight for
Better Rates,
HMP FROM ROOSEVELT
Power for Interstate Com
merce Commission,
Mr. J. E. Howard of the Union Mills
company has returned from Washington,
where he attended "The Reciprocity Con
vention" held there. He is not greatly
impressed with the work done at at
convention, as the high tariff element in
vaded it in great numbers, and hence
prevented an open and positive declara
tion for reciprocal trade relations with
other countries. But he is feeling good
over the prospects of congress passing
amendments to the inter-state commerce
law which will give the inter-state com
mission the power to enforce any order
they may choose to make.
Mr. Howard is enthusiasticlly in favor
of the measure, and is using his utmost
influence -to have its passage accom
plished. He thinks the Santa Fe favors
an amendment such as is proposed, but It
Is possible that it does so only on the
condition that a bill shall also be passed
legalizing pooling among common carri
ers. It is said that the railroads contend
that if pooling is made legitimate there
will be no necessity for discrimination.
The Millers association is divided on this
question, many of tbe members being un
compromisingly opposed to "pooling,"
regardless of its effects.
Mr. Howard is secretary of the commit
tee having in charge the campaign in fa
vor of giving the inter-Etate commerce
commission power commensurate with its
responsibility, and he believes that it is
important that all shippers, regardless of
their business, should become Interested
in the matter, and make their will felt
in Washington.
The millers want something that is to
the benefit of every citizen and of every
industry except, possibly, the railroads.
They are opposed to the discrimination of
the railways in favor of wheat against
flour. In other words, they want Ameri
can wheat made into American flour and
the manufactured product sent to Europe
for sale. As conditions now exist the
railroads, with their steamboat connec
tions, want the raw material taken from
the wheat fields to Europe that .they may
get that much more tonnage, Mr. How
ard,, and others, think that the American
railways are mistaken in their policy in
this respect; that it would be eventually
better for the railroads to have food
products made at home, by American
millers American machinery and Ameri
can coal. He cannot see how it can profit
the railroads to have Sedgwick county
wheat made Into flour in France and
shipped to England. They do not haul
the coal that makes that flour, as they
could do if it was made here In Wichita.
If the manufacture of Kansas wheat
builds up a town in France, with in
creased population and Increased pros
perity, the railroads do not benefit by It;
whereas they would, by encouraging the
manufacture of flour at home, build up
Wichita, giving it more population and
prosperity, they would benefit their own
business permanently.
The bill proposed by the millers Is to
give a friendly inter-state commission the
right to order, if they deem proper, that
the railroads should at once cease dis
criminating in favor of wheat and against
flour, and to give them the power to
enforce that or any other order when it
is made.
Mr. Howard, while ho had not then read
Fresldent Roosevelt's message, felt confi
dent that ho would prove friendly to the
proposition to clothe the commission with
more authority, and his coiJdenco has
been justified by the president's message.
A coated tongue, foul breath and
clogged condition in the bowels suggests
tho use of Prickly Ash Bitters. It is just
suited for such ailments.
WICHITA COURSING MEET
All About the Great Sport Lately In
troduced. Many peoplo havo been waiting for the
announcement of the coursing meet to
be held at Wichita, soon. -Tew people
know what a coursing meet really is.
Some think it is a Jack-rabbit race:
others suppose that all tho dogs run at
once. To begin with a coursing meet is
one .of the most refined kind of sport
known to exist, and is followed by the
most refined ladies and gentlemen of the
decade or two ago, with what had scarely
present day. Starting for the first but a
more than a local interest, and with no
perstige in this country to appeal to.
there were to be faced the doubts and
scoffs of the skeptical who predicted that
the attempt to Introduce the sport would
be entirely futile. Others suspicious and
arrayed against a new thing also pessi
mists and sore-heads, forever seeing only
shadows and gloom, while at the same
time even advance carried with it the
difficulty of being on new and untried
territory and with a large amount of
failure sttra to be realised. Overcoming
all these things, pushing steadily to the
froat the development has been without
parallel, taking on a national and even
mtematioaal importance. For surpass
ing tbe horse cr tho circus in the clean
and manly way It is conduc ted, what can
be more exciting, mors exbilirattng than
a cloeely contested race between two
hounds, bred, raised, and conditioned
until erary muscle and curve is the very
picture of grace. Each exerting every
particle Of strength asd cunning to out
wit his opponent to capture the little
monarch of the prairie, known as the
jackrabbit. In coursing, there is no delay
no scoring or waiting. The dogs run tw o
at n time anfi very means of escape is
afforded to the rabbit, the race course
being entirely surrounded by a high fenc
of a burlap, inside of which the rabbits
are kept and trained to lind the t stupes
which the dogs know nothing about. The
grounds are usually a quarter of a mile
in diameter from every point. A ltirge
anipl theatre being built to accommodate
the spectators affords a fine view of every
race, which axe ran one after another
the entirs day, and usually taking about
three days t each mctt.
All this taks money to carry it on suc
cessfully, which must le raised in ad
vance, returning again with the entrance
fee of ths dogs an the gate receipts,
which in a town like Wichita, ought and
would be . a day a twenty-rive cents
apiece. Tb does aJoce are worth twice
tbe smontt of admission to see. being the
best from every stats in the Union, also
England and Ireland. How many have
seen a dog whose actual value was from
$2.eJ to S.Wt Is not a dog like th.t
worth seeing? Every other t" l ;n t".
state is holding cvursdrtg me. : io
three times a year. Even Nebraska ran
a coat wing meet, giving a purse of K .
