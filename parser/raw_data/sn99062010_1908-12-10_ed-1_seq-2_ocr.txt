THE_ CITIZEN-REPUBLICAN
P. A. BLISS, Editor and Proprietor.
SCOTLAND, SOUTH DAKOTA
Says the South China Morning- Post:
"A snake Btory comes to us from the
Kowloon side. A few days ago a brown
adder, measuring some two feet and a
half, was killed by Mr. Coke, bund mas
ter of tiie Rajputs, under rather curious
circumstances. The reptile was slain
right in the open road upon the water
front, where the Kowloon children aro
wont to play, and Mr. Coke's attention
was first drawn to it by an animal
duel, which was {joins on between the
snake and a cat. Poor Thomas, with
bristling hair and tail on end, was
gradually being fascinated by the ad
der, and must have eventually suc
cumbed but for the timely assistance
of the club. While wo. do not suppose
that snakes are too numerous in Ko
wloon, we think that amahs in charge
of children might safely be warned to
keep their small charges upon the
grass lands near tho Kowloon wa
ter front."
An entirely new design in the con
struction of electric lamps has been re
cently brought out, the novel feuturo
of which Is the entire absence, so far
as the eye is concerned, of all wires.
One-half of the transformer is fas
tened to the underside of a table, while
the other half of the transformer is in
corporated in the base of the lamp
standard. By proper transformer de
sign, it is possible to supply the lamps
on the standard with electrical en
ergy when both parts of the transform
er are placed one above the other. The
advantages of such an arrangement aro
that no holes need be made in the table
or coverings for the passage of wires
while the lamp itself can be removed
from the tabic when so desired with
out disconnecting any wires.
Dr. Charles Perrler, in an article
based on observations made in French
penal institutions, says that criminals
*ro for the most part of medium height.
Thieves, he says, he found to be almost
exclusively of smalt stature and beg
gars nearly always of medium or
slightly under that height. "It is sel
dom," he says, "that a fully developed
beggar nature can be found In a large
frame." Murderers, on the other hand,
his observations prove to be above the
average in size. All the prisoners un
der punishment for arson and for coun
terfeiting measured by him came under
•the head of "small." These details, the
writer says, while they may establish,
certain facts as to French criminals,
may be valueless when applied to thoi
underworld in other countries.
Some of tho great estates of Eng
land are held by curious rents. The
duke of Atholl holds certain possessions
conditionally on' his supplying a white
rose whenever the sovereign visits him.
Queen Victoria and her consort visited
him years ago when roses did not
bloom in the garden, and great was
the difficulty In procuring a couple. A
trickier rent was that upon which the
^lunros, of FVulls, held their property,
ft was that a snow ball should be pre
sented upon any day of the year that
it was demanded. Happily for the own
er, snow lies In the form of a glacier
tn the chasms of Ben Wyvis all the
•rear, and there seems no danger of]
forfeiture by failure of the quaint
rent.
'Mjr, Good news for hunters comes from.
A_ llalne. The Kennebec Journal says
that all reports from the men who have
been In the woods indicate one .of the
wYiost successful hunting seasons' for a
long time. The Journal quotes an old
woodsman as saying: "In all tho
years I have been going to the Maine
woods I have never known deer to be
more plentiful than they are now. I
have been In the Rangeley region all
summer, and have seen deer on all sides.
They are not only numerous, but they
are In excellent condition. They have
passed an excellent summer, have had
plenty of food and are now sleeker than
they have been for a number of years."
The Musical Home Journal of Lon
don tells a story of George Grossmith
xnd the income tax authorities. Long
after his father's death the commis
sioners. by mistake, sent the younger
Grrosarmith a notice assessing the In
come of the deceased at $10,000. Mr.
Orossmitb returned the document tq
the proper quarter, with the following
oot« written across It: "I am glad to
learn my father Is doing so well in the

Canada's minister of canals has pre
sented to the Canadian House of Com
fflons a suggestion that something
should be done by the dominion to pro
ride a water route to compete with

3oot canal be dug to connect Lakes
Brie and Ontario. It Is estimated that,
a canal of depth sufficient to accommo

cost *25,000.000 to 130,000,000. Such a*

will probably undertake within a few

ROOSEVELT'S FINAL
ADDRESS TO CONGRESS
President's Message Reiterates
Need of Reforms He Has
Previously Advocated.
URGENT APPEAL TO PEOPLE
An Effort Will Be Made to Get Labor
and Capital Together for the
Sake of the Publio
Welfare.
Washington, I). C„ Special: Presi
dent Roosevelt's final message to con
gress, advocating strongly the enaction
of the reforms to which his adminis
tration has been devoted, was read in
both houses today. The message in
part, follows:
I To the Senato and House of Repre
sentatives: The financial standing of the
nation at the present time is excellent,
andthe financial management of the na
tion's interests by the government daring
the last seven years has shown tlie most
satisfactory results. But our currency
system is imperfect, and it is earnestiy
to be hoped that the currency commis
sion will bo able to propose a thoroughly
good system which will do away with
the existing defects.
During the seven years and three
months there has been a net surplus of
nearly one hundred millions of receipts
over expenditures, a reduction of the
interest bearing debt by ninety millions,
in spite of the extraordinary expense of
the Panama canal, and a saving of near
ly nlno millions on tho annual in'erest
charge. This is an exceedingly satisfac
tory showing, especially in view of tho
fact that during this period the nation
has never hesitated to undertake any
expenditure that it regarded as neces
sary. There have been no new taxes and
no increases of taxes: on tho contrary,
some taxes have been taken off there
has been a reduction of taxation.
Corporations.
As regards the great corporations en
gaged in interstate business, and espe
cially the railroads, I can only repeat
what I have already again and again
said in my messages to the congress. I
believe that under the interstate clause
of the constitution the United States
has complete and paramount right to
control all agencies of interstate com
merce, and I believe that the national
government alone can exercise this right
with wisdom and effectiveness so as both
to secure Justice from, and to do justice
to, the great corporations which are the
most Important factors in modern busi
ness. I believe that it is worse than folly
to attempt to prohibit all combinations
as is done by the Sherman anti-trust
law, because such a law can be enforced
only Imperfectly and unequally, and its
enforcement works almost as much hard
ship as good. 1 strongly advocate that
Instead of an unwise effort to prohibit
combinations, there shall be sub-
stltuted a law which shall expressly per
mit combinations which are in the inter
est of the public, but shall at tho same
time give to some agency of the national
government full power of control and
supervision over them. One of the chief
features of this control should be secur
ing entire publicity hi all matters which
the public has a right to know, and fur
thermore, tho power, not by judicial but
by executive action, to prevent or put a
stop to every form of improper favoritism
or other wrongdoing.
Tho Railroads.
The railways of the country should be
put completely under the Interstate com
merce commission and removed from the
domain of the anti-trust law. The power
of the commission should be made thor
oughgoing, so that it could exercise com
plete supervision and control over the
issue of securities as well as over the
raising and lowering of rates. As regards
rates, at least, this power should be
summary. The power to investigate the
financial operations and accounts of the
railways has been one of the most val
uable features in recent legislation
rower to make combinations anO traffic
agreements should be explicitly conferred
upon the railroads, the permission of the
commission being first gained and the
combination or agreement being published
In all Its details. In tho interest of the
public the representatives of the public
should have complete power to see that
the railroads do their duty by the public
,a palter of course this power
should also be exercised so as to see that
JJu injustice Is (pone to the raflroads.
lne shareholders, the employes and the
shippers all have interests that must be
guarded. It is to the interest of all of
them that no swindling stock specula
*!°n «'iould be allowed, and that there
should be no improper issuance of se
curl ties.
The guiding intelligences necessary for
the successful building and successful
management of railroads should receive
ample remuneration but no man should
be allowed to make money in connection
M1 J?l,roads out of fraudulent over-
ens and business men who ship freieht
or callous disregard of the rights and
needs of the employes. Tn addition to
this, the interests of the shareholders, of
the employes, and of the shippers should
all be gu::rded as against one another
To give any one of them undue and im
proper consideration Is to do Injustice to
the others.
Kates must be made as low as is com
patible with giving proper returns to all
the employes of the railroad, from the
highest to the lowest, and proper returns
to the shareholders: but they a-mst not
for Instance, be reduced In such fashion
as to necessitate a cut in the ttages of
the employes or the aboil t'.o of the
proper and legitimate profits of honest
shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies er
gaged in Interstate business should be
put under the Jurisdiction of the Inter
state Commerce commission.
APPEAL TO PEOPLE.
where"at-| our neop?ef thro^h'fhiir re^rlsemat'veV
at large would come from entire failure
on the part of the public to supervise
and control the actions of the great cor
porations, or from the exercise of the
necessary governmental power tn a way
which would do injt'itice and wrong ct
the corporations. Both the preachers o"
an unrestricted individualism, and the
preachers of an oppression which would
deny to able men of business the Just re
ward of their initiative and business sa-
A
whole country. To permit every lawless
capitalist, every law defying corporation,
to take any action, no matter how in
iquitous, in the effort to secure an im
proper profit and to build up privilege,
would be ruinous to tho republic and
would mark the abandonment of the ef
fort to secure in the industrial world the
spirit of democratic fair dealing. On the
other hand, to attack these wrongs ln
that spirit of demagogy which can Bee
wrong only when committed by the mar.
Of wealth, and is, dumb and blind in the
presence of wrong committed against
men of property or by men of no prop
erty, Is exactly as evil as- corruptly to
defend tho wrongdoing of men of wealth.
The war we wage must be waged against
misconduct, against wrongdiong wherever
it is found: and we must stand heartily
for the rights of every decent man,
wlwsVker he be a man of great wealth Or
a man who earns his livelihood as a
wage worker or a tiller of the soil.
It Is to tho Interest of all of us that
there should be a premium put upon
Individual initiative and individual capac
ity, and an ample reward for the great
directing intelligences alone competent to
manage the great business operations of
today. It is well to keep in mind that
exactly as the anarchist Is the worst
enemy of liberty and the reactionary the
wofst enemy of order, so the men who
defend the rights of property have most
to rear from the wrongdoers of great
wealth, and the men who are champion
ing popular rights have most to fear Jrom
the demagogues who in the name of pop
ular rights would do wrong to and oppress
honest business men, honest men of
wealth: for the success of either type of
wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent
reaction against the cause the wrong
doer nominally upholds. In point of dan
ger to the nation there is nothing to
choose between on the ono hand the cor
ruptionlst, the bribe giver, tho brlbo
taker, the man who employs his great
talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a
large scale, and. on tho other hand, the
preacher of class hatred, the man who,
whether from ignorance or from willing
ness to sacrifice his country to his am
bition, persuades well meaning but wrong
headed men to try to destroy the instru
ments upon which our prosperity mainly
I rests.
Let Each Beware.
Let each group of men beware of and
guard against tho shortcomings to which
that group is Itself most liable. Too often
wo see the business community in a spirit
of unhealthy class consciousness deplore
tho effort to hoid to account under the
law the wealthy men who in their man
agement of great corporations, whether
railroads, street railways, or other indus
trial enterprises, have behaved in a way
that revolts the conscience of the plain,
decent people. Such an attitude can not
be condemned too severely, for men of
property should recognize that they jeop
ardize the rights of property when they
fail heartily to. Join in the effort to do
away with the abuses of wealth. On tho
other hand, those who advocate proper
control on behalf of the public, through
the state, of these great corporations,
and of the wealth engaged on a giant
scale in business operations, must ever
keep ln mind that unless they do scrupu
lous Justice to the corporation, unless
they permit ample profit, and cordially
encourage capable men of business so
long as they act with honesty, they are
striking at the root of our national well
being for in the long run, under the
mere pressure of material distress, the
people us a whole would probably go back
to tho reign of an unrestricted individ
ualism rather than submit to a control
by the state so drastic and so foolish,
conceived in a spirit of such unreason
able and narrow hostility to wealth, as
to prevent business operations from be
ing profitable, and therefore to bring
ruin upon tho entire business community,
a,.d ultimately upon .he entire body of
citizens.
The opposition to government control
of these great corporations makes its
most effective effort in the shape of an
appeal to the old doctrine of states'
rights. Of course, there are many sincere
men who now believe in unrestricted Indi
vidualism in business, just as there were
formerly many slncero men who believed
in slavery—that is, in the unrestricted
right of an individual to own r"other
Individual. These men do not by them
selves liavo great weight, however. The
effective light against adequate govern
ment control and supervision of indi
vidual. and »apcclaHy of corporate,
wealth engaged in interstate business is
chiefly done under cover and especially
under cover of an appeal to states' rights.
It is not at all infrequent to read in the
same speech a denunciation of predatory
wealth fostered by special privilege and
defiant of both the public welfare and
law of tho land, and a denunciation of
centralization in the central government
of the power to deal with tuis centralized
and organized wealth. Of course, the
policy set forth in such twin denuncia
tions amounts to absolutely nothlag, for
the first half is nullified by the r^cond
half.
Basis of Union.
The chief reason among the mac?
sound and compolUnx reasons, that led
to the formation of tne national govern
ment, was the absolute need tliet the
union, and not the several states, snould
deal with interstate and foreign com
merce and the power to deal with inter
state commerce was granted absolutely
and plenarily to the central government
and was exercised completely us regards
the only instruments of interstate com
merce known in those days—the water
ways, the highroads, r.s well as the part
nerships of individuals who then con
ducted all of what business there was.
Interstate commerce is now chiefly con
ducted by railroad**, and the great cor
poration has supplanted the mass of
small partnerships or individuals. The
proposal to make the natior.al govern
ment supreme over, and therefore to give
it complete control over, tho railroa/ls
and other Instruments of interstate com
merce is merely a proposal to carry out
to tho letter one of the prime purposes,
if not tho prime purpose, for which the
constitution -yas founded. It does not
represent centralization. It represents
merely the acknowledgment pi the patent
fact that centralization has already come
in business.
If this irresponsible outside ousiness
power is to bo controlled in the interest
of the general public it can only ie con
trolled in onq way by giving adequate
pewer of control to the one sovereignty
capable of cxerclsing such power—the
nationcl government. Forty or 60 sep
arate state governments can not exercise
that power over corporations doing busi
ness in most or all of them first, be
cause they absolutely lack the authority
to deal with interstate business in any
form and second, because of the inev
itable conflict of authority sure to arise
in the effort to enforce different kinds of
state regulation, often inconsistent with
one another and sometimes oppressive in
themselves. Such divided authority can
not regulate commerce with wisdom and
effect. The central government Is the
only power which, without oppression,
can nevertheless thoroughly and ade
quately control and supervise the large
corporations.
To abandon the effort for national con
trol means to abandon the effort for all
adequate control and yet to render likely
continual bursts of action by state legis
latures, whiert can not achieve the pur
pose sought for, but which can do a
great deal of damage to the corporation
without conferring any real benefit on
the public.
Corporations Sue Mistake.
I believe that tho more farsignted cor
porations aro themselves coming to rec
ognize the unwisdom of the violent .Hos
tility they havt, uisplt-yed during the last
Low years to regulation and control by
iho national government of combinations
engaged ln Interstate business. The truth
is that we who believe in this movement
of asserting and exercising a genuine
control, In the public interest, over these
great corporations have to contend
against two sets of enemies, who, though
nominally opposed to one anoiher, are
really allies in preventing a proper solu
tion of the problem. There are, first, the
big corporation men, and the extreme
individualists among business men who
genuinely belie/o in utterly unregulated
business—that is, the reign of plu
tocracy and, second, the men who. being
blind to tho economic movements of the
day, believe in a movement of repression
rather than of regulation of corporations
and who denounce both, the power of the
railroads and the exercise of the federal
power which alone can really control the
railroads. Those who believe in efllcient
national control, on the other hand do
not in the least object to combinations
do not in. the least object to concentra
tion in business administration. On the
contrary, they favor both, with tho all
important proviso that there shall be
such publicity about their workings, and
such thoroughgoing control over them
as to insure their being in the interest'
and not against the interest, of the gen
eral public. We do not object to the
concentration qf wealth and administra
tion but we do believe In the distribution,
of the wealth in profits to the real own
ers, and in Securing to the public the full
benefit of the concentrated administra
tion.. We believe that with concentra
ti°n in administration there can come
both the advantage of a larger owner
ship and of a more equitable distribution
of prontB, and at the same time a better
service to the commonwealth. We be
lleve^ that the administration should be
for the benefit of the many and that
greed and rascality, practiced on a large
scale, should be punished as relentlessly
as if practiced on a small scale.
-We do not for a moment believe that
the problem will be solved by any short
and easy method. The solution will come
only by pressing various concurrent rem
edies. Some of these remedies must lie
outside the domain of all government.
Some must lie outside the domain of the
federal government. But there Is legis
lation which the federal government
alone can enact and which Is absolutely
vital ln order to secure the attainment of
our purpose. Many laws are needed.
There should be regulation by the na
tional government of the great Inter
state corporations, including a simnls
method of account keeping, publicity,
supervision of the Issue of securities
abolition of rebates and of special privi
leges. There should be short time fran
chises for all corporations ^engaged in
pora*
fghts.

:«pp
Use ths Power.
To accomplish this, means of course a
certain increase in tho use of—not the
creation of—power, by tho central gov
ernment. The power already exists it
does not have to be created: the only
question is whether it shall be used or
left Idle—and meanwhile the corporations
over which tho power ought to be exer
cised will not remain idle. Let those who
object to this increase in the use of the
only power available, the national power,
be frank, and admit openly that they pro
pose to abandon any effort to control the
great business corporations and to exer
cise supervision over the accumulation
and distribution of wealth: for such su
pervision and control can only come
through this particular kind of increase
of power. We r* more believe in that
empiricism which demands absolutely un
restrained individualism than we do in
that empiricism which clamors for a
deadening socialism which would destroy
all individual initiative and would ruin
the country with a completeness that not
even an unrestrained individualism itself
could achieve.
Tho danger to American democracy lies
not in the least in the concentration of
administrative power in responsible and
accountable hands. It lies in having the
power Insufficiently concentrated, so that
no ono can bo he'd responsible to the
people for Its use. Concentrated power
is palpable, visible, responsible, easily
reached, quickly held to account. Power
scattered through many administrators,
many legislators, many men who work
behind and through legislators and ad
ministrators, is impalpable, is unseen, is
irresponsible, can not be reached, can not
be held to account. Democracy is ln
peril wherever the administration of po
litical power is scattered among a va
riety of men who work in secret, whose
very names are unknown to the common
people. It is not In peril from any man
who derives authority from the people,
who exercises it in sight of the people,
and who is from time, to time compelled
to give an account of its exercise to the
people.

THE LABOR PROBLEM. $
11
There are many matters affecting labor
and the status of the wage worker to
which I should like to draw your atten
tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the
problem in all Its aspects is not no-w
necessary. This administration is
Hear­
ing its end and, moreover, under our
form of government the solution of the
„\i
LLLV
states as much as upon the action of the
nation. Nevertheless, there are certain
considerations which I wish to set before
you. because I hope that our people will
more and more kcop them in mind. A
blind and ignorant resistance to every
effort for the reform of abuses and for
the readjustment of society to modern
Industrial conditions represents not true
conservatism but an incitement to the
wildest radicalism: for wiso radicalism
and wise conservatism go hand in hand,
one bent on progress, the other bent 011
seeing that no change is made unless in
the right direction. I believe in a steady
effort, or perhaps it would be more ac
SH£ate
to say
'n steady efforts in many
different directions, to bring about a con

F^chlnery, organization, and division
or labor, accompanied bv an effort to
at)OUt
a larger share In the owner­
ship by wage worker of railway, mill and
factory. In farming, this simply means
th»* we wish to see the farmer own his
own land we do not wish to see the
farms so large that they become the
property of absentee landlords who farm
them by tenants, nor yet so small that
the farmer becomes like a European
peasant. Again, the depositors in our
savings banks now number over one
tenth of our entire population. These
are all capitalists, who through the sav
ings banks loan their money to the work
ers—that is, in many cases to them
selves—to carry on their various Indus
tries. The more we increase their jium
ler, the more wo introduce the principles
of co-operation into our industry. Every
Increase in the number of small stock
holders in corporations is a good thing
for the same reasons and where the
employes are tho stockholders the result
is particularly good. Very much of this
movement must be outside of anything
that can be accomplished by legislation
but legislation can do a good deal. Post
al savings banks will make it easy for
.Poorest to keep their savings in
absolute safety. The regulation of the
national highways must be sufrh that
tney shall servo all people with equal
justice.
Corporate finances must be supervised
so as to make it far safer than at pres
ent for the man of small means to in
vest his money in stocks. There must
be prohibition of child labor, diminution
of woman labor, shortening of hours of
all mechanical labor, stock watering
should be prohibited and stock gambling
so far as is possible discouraged. Thero
should be a progressive inheritance tax
on large fortunes. Industrial education
should be encouraged. As far as pos
sible we should lighten the burden of
taxation on tho small man. Wo should
put a premium upon thrift, hard work
and business energy but these qualities
ceaso to be the main factors ln accumu
lating a fortune long before that for
tune reaches a point where it would be
seriously affected by any Inheritance tax
such as I propose. It is eminently right
that the nation should fix the terms upon
which the great fortunes are Inherited.
They rarely do good and they often do
harm to those who inherit them in their
entirety.
Protection for Wage Workers.
The above is the merest skeion. nardly
even a sketch in outline, of tho reforms
for which we should work. But there is
one matter with which the congress
should deal at this session. There should
no longer be any paltering with the ques
tion of taking care of tha wage workers
who, under our present Industrial system
become killed, crippled, or worn out as
part of the regular incidents of a given
business. The majority of wage workers
must have their rights secured for them
by state action but the national govern
ment should legislate in thoroughgoing
and far reaching fashion not only for all
employes of'the national government, but
for all persons engaged in interstate
commerce. The object sought for could
be achieved to a measurable degree, as
far as those killed or crippled are con
cerned by proper employers' liability
laws. As far as concerns those who have
been worn out, I call your attention to
the fact that definite steps toward pro
viding old age pensions have been taken
In many of our private Industries. These
may be indefinitely extended through
voluntary association and contributory
schemes, or through the agency of sav
ings banks, as unaer the recent Massa
chusetts plan. To strengthen these prac

I renew my recommendation made in
a previous message that half holidays be
granted during summer to all wage work
ers in government employ.
I also renew my recommendation that
the princlplo of the eight horir day should
as rapidly and as far a.- practicable be
extended to the entire work being carried
on by tho government the present law
should be amended to embrace contracts
on those publio works which the present
wording of the act seems to exclude.
THE COURTS.
I most earnestly urge upon the congress
the duty of increasing the totally inad
equate salaries now given to our judges.
On the whole, there is 110 body of public
servants who do as valuable work, nor
whoso moneyed reward is so inadequate
compared to their work. Beginning with
the supreme court the judges should have
their salaries doubled, it is not belitting
tho dignity of the nation that its most
honored public servants should be paid
sums so small compared to what they
would earn in private life that ihe per
formance of public service by them
implies an exceedingly heavy pecuniary
sacrifice.
It is earnestly to bo desired that some
method should be devised for doing away
with the long delays which now obtain
in the administration of justice, and
which operate with peculiar severity
against persons of small means, and fa
vor only tho very criminals whom it is
most desirable to punish. These long de
lays in the final decisions of cases make
ln the aggregate a crying evil and a
remedy should bo devised. Much of this
intolerable delay is dtie to improper re
gard paid to technicalities which are a
mere hindrance to justice. In somo noted
recent cases this over regard for techni
calities has resulted in a striking denial
of justice, and llAgrant wrong to the
body politic.
At the last election certain leaders of
organized labor made a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary
of the country, an attack couched in such
terms as to include the most upright
honest and broad minded judges, no less
than those of narrower mind and more
restricted oi'rlook. It was tho kind of at
tack admirably iltted to prevent any suc
cessful attempt to reform abuses of the

of the unjust judge their eagerly desired
opportunity to shift their ground into a
championship of just judges who were
unjustly assailed. Last year, before the
house committee on the Judiciary, these
same labor leaders formulated their de
mands, specifying the bill that contained
ihem, refusing all compromise, stating
they wished the principlo of that bill or
nothing. Diey insisted on a provision
tnat in a labor dispute no injunction
should, issue except to protect a property
right, and specifically provided that the
right to carry 011 business should not be
construed as a property right: and in a
second provision their bill made legal In
a labor dispute any act or agreement by
or between two or more persons that
would not have been unlawful if done bv
a single person. In other words, this biil
ary boycott which the
:rlke commission so un-
forms of secondar
anthracite coal string i_uiunii»atuu so un
reservedly condemned while the right to
carry on a business was explicitly taken
out from under that protection which tho
law throws over property. The demand
was made that there should be trial by
jury in contempt cases, thereby most
seriously impairing the authority of the
courts. All this represented a course of
policy which, if carried out, would mean
tho enthronement of class privilege in its
crudest and most brutal form, and the
destruction of one of the most essential
functions of the judiciary in all civilized
ianas.
Attack Too Crude.
The violence of the crusade for this leg
islation, and its complete failure, illus
trate two truths which it is essential our
people should learn. In the first place
ihey ought to teach the workingman, the
3aborer, the wageworker, that by le
manding what is improper and impossible
Jie plays into the hands of his foes. Such
la crude and vicious attack upon the
•courts, even if it were temporarily suc
cessful, would inevitably in the end cause
a violent reaction and would band the
jgreat mass of citizens together, forcing
them to stand by all the judges, com
petent and incompetent alike, rather than
to see tho wheels of justice stopped A
movement of this kind can ultimately re
sult in nothing but damage to those in
whose behalf it is nominally undertaken
This is a most healthy truth, which it Is
wise for all our people to learn Anv
movement based o,. that class hatred
which at times assumes the name of
"Class consciousness" is certain ulti
mately to fail, and if it temporarily suc
ceeds, to do far reaching damage. "Class
consciousness," where it is merely an
other name for tho odious vice of class
selfishness, is equally noxious, whether in
an employer's association or ln a work
lngman's association. The movement in
question was one in which the

Every time they interpret contract, prop*

which means the possession of such elei

fairmindedness. The judge'who owes hies
election to pandering to demagogic senti

and the judge who owes either his elec
tion or his appointment to the money or
the favor of a great corporation, are
alike unworthy to pit on the bench, are
alike traitors to the people and no pro
fundity of legal learning, or correctness,
of abstract conviction on questions of
public policy, chn serve as an offset, to
such shortcomings. But it is also true,
that judges, like executives and letris
lators, should hold sound views on the
questlons of public policy which are of
vital interest to the people.
The legislators and executives aro chos

sense. Theit function is to interpret th»*
laws. The legislators are responsible for

they should strive to.find out what thosei
interests are, and, so far as they corisei-*
entiously can, shuuld strive to give effect'

The courts are to be highly commended^
