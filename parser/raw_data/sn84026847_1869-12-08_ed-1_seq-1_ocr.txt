G it AST and Congress will probably
differ somewhat with regard to the
Snpreme Coorr. Grant wants the
salaries of tbe Judges increased. Con
I gress indicates a disposition to abolish
the whole tribunal. Grant tells the
: law-givera they ought to raise the
wages of tbe Conrt once, when they
raise their own twice. The law givers

The piesent Admiuistration-is exceed
ing modest. It claims eredit for a geod
part of the financial success which at
tended the last year of Johnson's Ad
ministration. The report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury shows a surplus of
receipts over expenditures for the year
ending June 30tb, 1869, of abont $50,
000,000. Eight months of that year
were covered by the Johnson Adminis
tration; four months by Grant and
Boutwkll. And yet BofTWELL would
assume the glory of eatning and saving
what was earned and saved before he
came into power. Indeed, the Grant
Administration did not get fairly to
wo: It before the close of the last fiscal
year. The assessments, collections and
disbursements of that year, its whole
| financial management, was controlled
almost entirely by Johnson officials.
The impndenco of the Massachusetts
financier is apparent.
Krtrrurhuiral.
V.'irb all the fuss made about tbe ro
i! action of the debt wilder Grant's Ad
ministration, there is little prospect of
a induction in taxation, The estimates
of expenditures for tbe coming year,
made by the beads of Departments, are
footed tip by tbe Washington corres
poudent ot the Pittsburgh Commercial
to a totnl of $21 0,1*70, 653. To these
must be added aboat $13 600,000 for de
ficiencies from last year.making a grand
aggregate of not far from $225,000,000,
exclusive of intorest on the public debt.
! For thin latter item a fair estimate
would be $150,000,000, currency valua
tion. So it will be seen that tbe public
expenses for next year will be $375,000,
00i?, and by rt-asou of extravagance may
reach $1 '0,000,000. Last year the sum
tot n.1 of experse was $321,000,000; just
! win ro the retrei.e ment comes in we fail
i to perceive, nor does it clearly appear
bow taxation is to be lightened, if the
expouses of the Government are to be
placed upon the basis assigned them by
Giunt'8 officials.
The Drake Rill.
U:> Monday morning Senator Drake,
of Missouri, introduced into th# Senate
a bill depriving the Supreme Court of
the lluited States of jurisdiction over all
case* involving the constitutionality of
j nets of Congress. That is to say, if
' Congress chooses to subvert the Consti
tution in its most important and vital
provisions there is to bo no remedy
agaiokt the usurpation. The Le;;isla-|
tive will thus be made, in effect, the
only Department of the Government,
because it will have jower to abolish
both the others at its pleasure.
Radicalism seems indisposed to cease
its attacks upon our system of Govern
ment. During the war tbe violent
usurpations thai were carried into effect
were dt feuded under the plea that the
safety of the nation demanded them.
Now, without even the poor pretext of
military necessity, a more dangerous,
j malicious and revolutionary proposition
, than any made duiing tho lieated term
of the rebellion, is proposed iL tbn Sec
ale cf the United States. Of course, we
cannot tell what suppeit thu Diiakk
bill may receive. We only know that
j it proposes to completely change oar
system of Government, aud change it
for the worse. To plaoe any Depart
ment above tbe Constitution is simply
to establish a despotism.

A Virginia delegation interviewed
Gkakt yesterday. The Virginians
thanked him for recommending the
admission of their State. Ihey hoped
they might continne to have his good
will. Ulyssea hoped they might con
tiua.< to deserve. The Virginians re
quested the President to appoint Alex
Rives United States Judge for the
Fourth Distriei. The President replied
that Ai.xx. was "too old." Thu delega
tion explained that Rives was only
sixty-three, bnt in vain.
This is comforting to the West Vir
ginia candidates. Rives is too old at
sixty-three. That lays Maxwell out.
What a pity ! And a bachelor at that.
Eft win, Edwin ! IIow your castle crum
bles when the President announces that
he don't respect gray hairs! Judge
Tom Harrison is another '"exempt."
If the liuiit could be raised "a
leetle,'' he might make it. Nat Har
rison may be within range. If not,
let Graxt hold on until after the Leg- 1
islatnre meets. Nathaniel will ba "set ,
back" enough thon for all practical
purposes. Any how he would be a
younger man at sixty five than almost
anybody else at forty. He has taken !
such exceeding good caro of himself.
Never dissipated. Never applied "hot
and rebellious liquors to his head." i
Never set np o' nights getting his for- !
tune told by Phakaoii. Never Biack 1
Crooked the pregnant hinges of the
knee, to any pernicious extent. Men- i
tally, physically and morally perfect,1
Nathaniel's the man for the place. Al- !
though in tLe Stockholm matter
I lt 88es could not swallow a Camtuell, '
let us hope that in this judicial business !
I he will not strain at a NaT?
The Diriea I'mrI.
The New York Herald has been calling
upon President Grant to bnild a ship
canal across the Iethmns of Darien,
promising him in the event of his sac
cess snch an immortality of fame as
could not fail to be gratifying to the de
parted spirit of Grant several thousand
years hence. "Before oar late civil war,"
says the Herald, "one hundred millions
of money as an investment in anything,
was an amount too enormous and foo
awful to Ui thought of. Bati^tha war,
in developing oitT financial capUbilitiea
has reduced the matter of a hundred or
five hundred million* to n mfeie baga
telle."
The President's message shows hiir
nibbling at the Herald 't bait. I5ur we
venture the opinion that both Grant
aud his tyigh flying adviser will find
tbat the people are uot disposed to run
wild after f. -b risky enterprises as that
suggested.
The present financial burthen, wo
opine, is about as heavy as they care to
carry. Such undertakings as building
caDals across isthmuses are expensive
on?a, and entail a vast expenditure of
meaus. It is doubUd if the one across
Darien could be constructed (or less
than two hundred miilious, and that
amount, just now, our Treasury cannot
spar* very conveniently, from the very
essential fact t'aat it hasn't got the
money. At a time when the Govern
ment itself is uucoilain where to raise
the meaus to meet the liabilities now
piessing against it, to enter upen auch
schemes as this Darien canal, and thus
almost dwuble the burthen of taxation
?inder which the country already groans
and bends, would be worse than folly ? j
it would be criminal.
We do not underestimate the import
ance of the work to the needs of the
commercial world. We fully realize all
the advantages to be derived lrom such
a canal. But we submittbat now is not
the proper time to undertake it. The
country is iu no condition to stand the
expeoso. Oar immeusa dsbt is as much
as can be haudled at present, and is more
than the Administration gives token of
ability to handle. After we have ex
tinguished the warjd' bt w;ll bo time
enough to t-lk about adventuring iu
schemes, involving the expenditure of
hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Tenure ot Oilier Act.
The old controversy between the
President and the Senate about the
Tenure of Office Act nee rns likely to be
revived Grant in his message de
mands the repeal of that Act, and his
demand is couched in terms that will
teud rather to revive the aucient wrath j
of the friends of the measure in the,
Senate thnu to seonre compliancc with
the President's wishes.
As a matter of abstract right this
Tenure of Office Act ought never to
have been enacted. Its enactment was
a violent encroachment npon the right
ful powers of the Executive. But as it
has bten passed, passed for an avowed
partisan object, and as it subsequently
received the approval of Grant himself,
it is not remarkably unfair that ho
thould enjoy its beDetits. This thiDg of
special legislation for special cases, this
policy of enlarging or limiting tho Ex
ecutive power according to tho political
j views of the Executive, is too abomina
ble for patient consideration. Let Pres
I ident Grant groau awhile under John
son's shackles. There is poetic justice
in the idea. The Senate, however
wrong in originating the Tenure #t
Office principle, will give geueral satis
faction by continuing its application.

Kd.lvrt of tlto lU^istei :
As you solicit oar reap on deuce from
various parts of the conntry, I will, in
compliance, drop you a line from this
point. One of the ilia of life is travel
ing. and my recent experince has not
changed the opinion I long since formed
regarding it. I arrived here wearied
and disgusted with railroad ho tela.
Oue of them 1 wish my friends to avoid ?
I mean that at Paris, Tiun. Let not the
savory smell of beefsteak and coffee
lure them within the walls o I that pine
board edifice. Au ? xorbit.mt charge
aoU a feeling of mortification at not
possessing sufficient "muscle" to ltreak
the biscuit is the only return for the
effort.
Memphis is doing a large business in
cotton, and her Cotton Brokers are now
leaping a rich harvest. Almost every
boat arriving at thisport brings mor^or
less of the staple of the Sonth, especial
ly the Arkansas and White river boats.
It is not an unfreijuent sight to seq wag
ons laden with it froui the country sur
rounding the city, bringing to market
the prooeedeof the pant Summer's labor,
reminding one of the Northern farmers
"taking their wool to town." And the
irrepressible "Caff* with h amall wagon
and one malo hauls to the oity his crop,
and in return takes to the plantation a
supply of bacon, tobacco and clothiug.
Cotton i9 now soiling for twenty-three
cents per pound. At this rate the pro
ducer realizes largely from his capital
and labor, and soon the Sonth will be
richer than bofoie the war.
If the expectations of the Sfemphians
are bntbalf realised, theirs will be a great
oity. A number of railroads are pro
jected; among others I may mention a
Southern Pacific, extending from this
place thrsugh Arkansas, Northern Tex
as to ?1 Paso, Mexico, and thence to the
Pacific coast. Already they claim cap
ital enough has been secured in Europe,
through the influence of John C. Fre
mont, to complete the road. It will
extend to the Atlantic coast by way of
Knoxville and the Virginia Central
railroad. At present the project looks
as though it would succeed. At this
time there is war bet ween the Fremont
partf and Governor Clayton's rin^over
the Memphis A Littlo Rock railroad.
Clayton having the power, i? evidently
the winning man. As I have business
in that country, I am compelled to uu
dergo the miseries of steamboating np
the Arkansas, the railroad not being
yet completed. No doubt this place
"ill increase rapidly is population and
business, as she possesses great natural
advantages : a surrounding conntry rich
and varied in its products; a great river,
affording communication with the North
and extreme South; numerous railroad*
completed and projected, and a climate
ansurpaased. The weather U clear aH
bright, and reminds me of a pleaaa?t
day in April at home. The magnolia
and other trees in the Park and ptivflk
yards am green and beautiful.
The United Statea Circuit Court if
now in session, Judge J. S. Trigg pre'
siding. He is a fair lawyer and a tber
oagh gentleman. Most of the cause*
ou the docket relate to cotton tr?ns?*
tions during the war. To-day the trial
was closed in the ease of Martin rfc
Bridges & Co. It was for a large qoan
tity of cotton burned in Arkansas dncv
ing the war. Quite an array of legal
talent is employed in the cause. A large
amount of business in all tbe Courts
accumulated daring tbe war and ih yet
undisposed of. To give you an idea of
its extent I may say that then* arp inltflb
Law Court of "the connty of Shelby "bp
wards of three thousand cases on that
('.?cket.
Among the names on the register of
tliis hotel (tbe Peabody) I notice those
of Jefferson Davis, ex-Oevernor Harris,
General Ewell and some others, who
took a prominent part in the late rebel
lion. Davis is here looking after tbe
interests of some insurance company of
which ho is now President. He is very
unassuming in his manner, and yon
might pass him a dozan times a day
and never once think he occupies such
a prominent position in the history of
| the couutry.
I tind a few Wheeling men engaged
in business here ? among others, our
genial yonng friend Charlie Brues, who
is in the house of Jas. Cole, 267 Main
street. He appears to be very popular.
I have made very nany pleasant ac
quaintances bore, yet there ieoae pecu
liarity belonging to the citi
zens? I mean that of bestow
ing gratuitous military titles.
For instance, they persist in intro
ducing me to their friends as Col. .
Fighting is not in my line, and I never
was even corporal in tbe militia. Be
fore closing I may eay that a duel is on
hands, growing ont of an article in this
morning's Aralanche. Mutual friends
are making an effort to reconcile tbe
parlies.
In politics Tennessee is experiencing
a great change. The present Legisla
ture is repealing most of the laws so ob
noxious to the people. Many offices
created for the purpose of supportivg
mere adventurers are being abolished,
many of tbe officers are resigning, and t be
people are being governed by officers ac
ceptable to them and who are acquaint
ed with their wants and necessities.
Under this changed state of things, I
find the people satisfied with the Fed
eral Government and having no desire
for the independsuce of the South.
With a wise and moderate policy toward
them, I believe that in a short time the
t?eople will be more attached to the
Union than ever before. A Constitu
tional Convention soon meets to amend
the organic laws of the State. I will,
perhaps, describe more fully the pro
posed changes in a future letter. B.

Krport of Hrcrelary lUuKrtll.
Trkasoby Department, )
December 0, 160U- }
I have the honor to sabmit herewith
the annual report of the doings and
conditions of the Treasury Department.
In this report I naturally treat, first,
I the matters of adminibtration and their
i measures of public policy. The officers
| in charge of the varions bureaus aud
divisions of the Treasury Department
havH faithfully performed their duties,
aud I commend their several icports to
the consideration of Cougress.
The Treasurer of the United States
has prepared an elaborute report sotting
forth tb?> present condition of the Treas
ury and furnishing a resume of the
business of the Treasury office from lb(il
to the present time. Long and faithful
servic?s of the present Treasurer enti
tles him tp the gratitude of the country.
The report of the Commissi?ner of
Internal Revenue is respectfully com
mended to the attention of Congress.
Since the appointment of the present
Commissioner the administration of the
offic-e has been constantly improving.
The increase of receipts tor the lirst live
uiouihs of the present fiscal year m the
sum of $14,431,333 66 over the amount
collected in the first five months of the
last fiscal year is satisfactory testimony
to the ability and integrity of the per
sons employed in that branch of the
public service.
The amount paid by warrants for col
lecting the revenue lrom customs dnr
iug the fiscal year endlfig June 30, 18SA,
was $(i,378,385 -13. and for the year end
ing June 30, 1868. $3 376,738 13, showing
a decrease of Sl,U01,('<47 30. The de
crejiJ?o iu the cost of collecting revenue
has not been attended by any lost* of
efficiency in the service. On th? other
hand it is believed that the means for
the deteotiou of smuggling are better
than ever before and that the custom
house service is also constantly improv
ing. It ought to be understood that
the chief means of collecting revenue
and enforcing the reveuut> laws must be
found in tht administration of the Ap
praiser'* department.
The frauds and losses arising from
actual smugglingare unimportant when
compared with the losses sustained
through the incompetent or dishonest
examiners and appraisers. Assuming
that honest men may be obtained for
these important positions at the present
salaries it is yet true that incompetent
appraisers or examiners may daily sub
ject the Government to lswes far ex
ceeding the amount of their salary.
Dnder existing laws certain Revenue
officers and other persons appearing as
informers are entitled to shares in tinea,
penalties and forfeitures. During the
fiscal years of 1^66 and 1S69 the Treas
ury Department distributed the sua of
t2t?,6?7,36l to such officers or to inform
ers in various cases arising under the
customs and revenue laws. A large ad
ditional sum was also paid through the
Internal Revenne office.
The reason on which the laws grant
ing such allowances is based is, that
officers of the Government are stimu
lated to greater activity in the discov
ery of frauds and in btinging offenders
i to pnnisbment. Therp can be no doubt1
that such is the etiect of this policy, but
the experience I have had in the Treas
ury Department lias convinced me that |
the evils attending the system are
greater than the beuetits derived from
it. It often occurs that revenue officers
?re l.d to a>*ert claims in behalf of the
Government which 'Lave no jost four
datioa in law or iu the fact* of respect
ive cases, and where real claims exist it
is often the ot^eet of the informsr and
officers who share iu the penalties to
misrepresent the case to the Govern
ment so as to secure the greater advant- !
age to themselves. Cuba's more sen- 1
ions evil is fonndin the practice quite]
general of allowing persons a fraudu
lent course aatil a result is reached
which will insnre to the beac-Bt of the :
officers and informers, instead of check
ing criminal practices at the outset. It ?
is impossible to s?t forth in exact lan
guage the character of the evils that
grow out of the prtssnt system. I am, i
however, clearly of the opinion that the
Government ought to rely on public ;
officers for the proper performances of (
tbeir duties without sLimalating tbem ,
by any contingent advantages. 1 have I
recommended an increase of salaries of
eostom officers, and the abolition of the '
system of g?v ing^t? them a share of
fines, penalties and forfeitures will be i
an additional reason for an inorease of J
salaries. In this department of the
public service it has become a practice
for clerks and other persons who have
held office in the Treasury Department
to accept employment as agents or at
torneys for parties having claims
against the Department, ana there is
reason to believe that in some instances
the information obtained wbile in pub
lic service has been nsed in aid of
claimants. Withont detailing all of
the objections to this practice, I re
spectfully suggest a law debarring per- j
sons from practicing before the Treas- 1
ury Department as agents or attorneys 1
in behalf of claims thet were pending'
when such persons were officers of the
Department.
In March last there were employed in
the Treasury Department, at Washing
toil, 8848 cie/ks, messengers -and labor
ers at a monthly cost of $*??,921.61.
At present ibe whole number ?f such
employes is 2441, and their monthly pay
amounts to $238,280.00, showing a de
crease of eiptnsos ar. the rate of $57,
168.64 per annum. It was found neces
sary, however, daring the periods men
tioned, to increase the force in the
Iutemal Revenue Ofliie and in tbeoffice
of the First Comptroller. This increase
in the aggregate in at the rate of $804.40
per annum. This statement does not
relate to the force in employment in the
bureau of eograving and printing. In
March last there were sixty-two special
agents in the service of the Department,
receiving in the aggregate for their ser
vices the sum of $371.10 per day. Each
of these agents made his report to the
Department and acted under its direct
orders. The number at present employ
ed is fifty-four and their daily pay
amounts to $369.95. The pay of the
agents has been increased generally in
Ibe hope that more efficient service
might be obtained.
The sea coast and frontiers of the
country have been divided into sixteen
special agency districts, and a superin
tendent appoiuted for each. Assistants
have aUo been appointed and detailed
to act under the several district agents.
The orders of the Department are in all
oases sent to the agent in charge of the
district, and reports of his assistants are
made to him. The agent is required to
make a monthly report of his doings
and of the doings of his subordinates.
The results thus far obtained appear to
justify the organization.
Arrangements have been made for the
manufacture of paper for the currency,
and other obligations of the United
States, and for the printing of the same,
with increased security of the Govern
ment against the unlawful issue from
the genuine plats. Under the 11th sec- 1
tion of an Act approved June 30th, lb*>4,
entitled "An Act to provide way and
means for the support of the .Govern
merit, and for other purposes," a pecu
liar paper has been designated as the
Government paper, and by that Aot it
is made felony for asy person to have or
retain in bis possession any similar pa
per adapted to the making of any obli
gations or securities of the United
States, except under authority of the
Secretary of the Treasury or somc'other
proper officer of the United States. Ar
rangements had beoti made for the raati
1 factors of this paper by Messrs. Wil
>x & Co., near Philadelphia, and the
mills owned by them, which are exclu
sively devoted to this purpose, have
been placed ouder the supervision of of
ficers of the Government, and such pre
cautions have been taken for the cus
tody of the portions of the machinery
as to reuder it impossible for the paper
manufacturers to obtain it by dishon
esty; it is received by agents of the
Government stationed at the mills, and
upon the requisition of the department
it is shipped to the National Bank
Note Company, tho American Batik Note
Company and the Punting Bureau of the
Treasury Department, as tho c.ise may
require. Arrangements have also been
made with each of the two companies
mentioned, for the propoBiug of the
plates 'for every issue of currency or
other obligations the Engraving and
Priuting Bureau at Washington pre
pares a third set and each office places
an imprint upon every obligation of
the Government. Notice of the trans
mission of paper from the agent at the
mills, and its receipt by each ot the
several offices of tho deliveries there
from and the Sealing Bureau in the
Treasury Department and also of de
li vcries to the Treasurer of the United,
States is given each day by telegram or
by letter and on the following day ac
countauts in the Treasury Department
prepare a statement showing the
disposition of ever v sheet of pa-!
per manufactured. In the month of
November the paper at the null
and in each of thesever.il printing es- .
tatilishments, was carefully counted I
and the result compared with the ac
count in theTreasuiyDspartment. Iuai1
aggregate of about, seven millions of
sheets, in receipts by the ngent at the
mills, discrepancies were found to the
extent of sixty sheets of fractional cur
rency paper and for the money value of
which thecouipaniesdoing the work are
responsible. It is believed that these
arrangements furnish better security
than has heretofore existed against the
fraudulent issueof currency, or other ob
ligations of the Government. By the use
of(orif>inal diesor plates, and thesystem
of the several establishments entrusted
with work, will disclose at once any
discrepancies in the accounts. It is not
probable that the changes made will
diminish the expense; indeed, the cost
is greater than it would be if the work,
in all its branches, were done in the
Treasury Department, lu my judg
ment, however, the additional security
is of more consequence to the Govern
ment than was the economy in the ex
pense of engraving and printing.
i Terrible Death ?r? Railway Condur
l?r.
As freight train No. C, coming east,!
which left Logan s port at 3:45 A. M., on
Monday, in charge of Condaotor Loan |
Arzt, was rounding the first curve this ,
; side of that place, a carcoopling broke, |
j dividing the train into two section*. As
soon as the fact was discovered. Mr. |
Arzt, who was on the section att.i.bed 1
to tbe engine, directed the engineer to
i back up, is order to re-anite tb" train, ,
i and then started back orclr the tops of i
1 the cars to superintend the matter per- (
'sonally. When be reached the end of
I the last ear of th? sectiou npen which
J he was he either fell, or accidentally
?topped off, lighting upon t?!9 track, and
I the wbeehi of the par passed over his I
neck, completely severing the head from '
| the body. The engineer, ignorant of'
, what bad occurred, continued backing
the train fortnme distance, until, being
noable to discover thrflight of tbe con
duct "t's lantern, be stoppad the train
and started down tbe track to ascertain
why no signals had b?en given. Upon'
| reaching a cattle-gnard h? fennd the
? mangled and headless body of Mr. Arzt.,
It seems that after the bead bad been
\ dissevered tbe train bad passed over the
I body, until it w n# caught by the ash* ;
pan of the engine, by which it was!
dragged a considerable distance over
tbe tie*, and finally deposited in the'
cattle guard, which being lower than
tbe level of tbe track gave room for the|
pan to paesover it. The deceased was
a single man, of tbe most exemplary
habits. ? F?rt Wayne Dtmffrrat.

IF VOl' SUOI I.D E'BR OUT M4B

If you should e'er get married, John.
I'll tell yon what to do
Go get a little tenement
Just big enough for two.
And one spare loom /or company,
And one spare bed within it ?
If you'd begin love's lile aright.
You'd better thus begin it.
In furniture be moderate, John,
And let the stuffed chairs wait:
One losking-giass will do both
Yourself and loving matt :
And Hrusaels, too, aud other thing*
Wbicu make a tine appearance.
If yon cm well afford ft, they
\Vill better look a year heuce.
it iino think they matt hare picture*, John,
Snperb and costly, too.
Your wife will be a picture, John.
Let that suffice for yoa.
Remember that the wise man said,
A tent, and love within it.
Is better than a spleudid house
With bickerings every minute.
And one word as to rooking, John,
Your wife caa do the best;
For love, to make the biscuit rise,
Is better far than yeast,
No matter if each day you don't
Bring turkey to your tails,
'Twill better relish by and by,
When you are better able.
For a'.l you l>uv, pay muney, John,
Mousy that very day?
If you would havo your life run smooth
There is no better way;
A note to pay is an ugly thing
(If thing you pleas? to call it)
When it hangs o'er ? man who h;-s
>'<> tuoney iu his wallet.
And one thingimore remember, John.
To ke?p aloof from strife,
And never, never, ncvkr speak
A orosa word to vour wife.
Bat if yon cannot Wp it back.
And burnings still iccjuireit,
Go whisper it into vonr gnn,
And then? go on', rnd tiro it.
And now w'uen you cot married, John,
Don't try to ape the rf<;b,,'
It took them many a a tedious year
To gain their envied niche.
And if you'd gain the summit, Jehn
Look well to your beginuing,
And then will all you win repay
The caie and toil of winning."
