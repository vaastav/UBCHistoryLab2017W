TO SUBSCRIBERS.
This is the last paper we
will forward to subscribers
who have not paid their
subscription in ADVANCE.
Those failing to receive
their paper will thus know
what is the matter. Many,
no doubt all, of our sub
scribers are good, but the
trouble of collecting small
amounts scattered through
the country is such as to ren
der the credit system terri
bly unprofitable. Those in
arrears for the Journal will
please forward the amount
due AT ONCE, thereby sav
ing trouble.
The President's Message.
We confidently expected to famish
our readers with the President s Mes
sage this morning, or at least with an
abstract of it Owing, however, to some
trouble with the "repeater'' at Vin
cennes, our expectations were disap
pointed. The failure to get the Message
is our apology for a " short" paper.

Sunday covered with American flags
from stem to stern. The Charley has a
passion for the American flag. The
boat left yesterday with a fine trip. The
Bowen is now, one of the neatest packets
on the river, having been thoroughly
overhauled, reuovated and painted. Ev

Pork Packing. Having thoroughly
renovated their large warehouse on Lo

are now engaged in cutting and packing
pork quite extensively. They are also
"trying out" large quantities of lard
daily. Of course, there is quite a rush
to seenre "tender loins," bones, &c, and
a stream of baskets is kept going to aud
from the warehouse, at almost all hours
of the Uav.

Oow Richmond is to be Taken.
From the l'Mlad-lpM rrese, Not. 27,1
Our advices from the Army of the Po
tomac to-day indicate a heavy increase
and continued re-enforcement of the reb
el army on the Ilappahannock about
Fredericksburg, and this fact will, no
doubt, be used as an alarm signal by the
enemies of the Government to create di
visions among the people, and detract
from that confidence in our military lead
ers which has been gaowing in every
State rapidly for the past few weeks. In
view of this cruel and most unpatriotic
action on the part of our real malcon
tents, it is only necessary for us to say
that General Burnside's private dispatch
es have created a hopeful feeling among
those who have the destinies of the coun
try in charge for the time. The move
ment of then rny has been very satisfac
tory in its conception and execution;
and while its results are already partial
lv opparent, and will be creditable, no
one can look at the histoay of the present
week and say that this concentration of
the rebels has not been one of the results
of this movement
The rebels, in making a stand at Fred
ericksburg, are only defendini? their capi
tal, depot of supplies, fortified base, and
entire Southern communication. The
Rappahannock River is the main line of
defense before Richmond. To cross it
with our array, in force, Bumside is now
ordered; in the event of which the rebels
must fall back behind the James River,
their second line of defense. Appre
ciating the importance of the strategy
evinced in our movement to the Rappa
hannock, the rebels are concentrating
about Fredericksburg, and Gen. Lee s
army is now defending Richmond. We
could do nothing better than meet the
enemy in an extensive pitched battle
just where he is. We believe that Gene
rals Bumside, Sumner, Hooker, and
Franklin are anxious and able to "try
conclusions" with Lee, Longstreet, Jack
son, and Hill, right upon that beautiful
series of slopes between the Rappahan-
nock and Massaponnax, in eight of the
ancient town now beleaguered fcy the
opposing armies of the Umon .-.nd rebel
States. .
That a battle will be fewght near this
spot we have no doabt, aad the heavier
it is, the worse witt be the result for the
rebels. Lee's army is the sole defense

lying quietly before Fredericksburg.
From tien. Burnside's Army.
The Falmouth correspondent of the
Philadelphia Inquirer, under date of the
2utli, says:
The presumption is that in a very few
days we will have a battle in this vicinity
that will 'eclipse all others of this war
in regard to ferocity and fierceness.
There is not the slightest doubt but
thnt the enemv is in creat force on the
other side of the river eqnnl if not su
perior to our own in point of nnmbers.
I have reason to believe that General
Lee is in command, in person, of the
whole rebel army of the Potomac ex
ceeding without doubt. 125,000 men.
Their camp fires can be seen extend
ing at least ten miles along the river,
and from observation five miles back
into the country. This is no fancy of
the brain. This is a powerful army to
intercept another army in crossing a riv
er. Although neither as wide nor deep
as the Schuylkill, yet it is an almost im
passible barrier to' artillery. There are
fords that can be waded by infantry, yet
a caisson would be floated if an attempt
was made to get it over, except by a
bridge.
The enemy, as usual, have picked out
an almost impregnable position, and
have been for a few days past working
like beaver3in throwing up fortifications.
Morniti". noon and night they are hard
at it with spade and pick, the dirt flying
until the walls or rifle-p:ts are com
pleted. Their prese.it position is on the
brow ot a range oi nign uhim. some ui
tmnm hack of the river, with a heavy
wood in their rear, and very probably
some of their works have been erected
in the timber, as this is their usual cus
tom. They have invariably Uk)B ad
vantage of hilly and wooded positions
places that nature has already made se
cure from assault
It is my opinion that back of the pres
ent range of hills where their works are
now erected, there is another range
which they will occupy if driven from
their strong position.
The railroads will, very likely, be fin
ished this morning sometime. This will
be the means of supplying the troops
with rations in abundance. As it now
is, with the wagons, it is an utter impos
sibility to get rations accumulated two
days ahead. Our army should at least
have twelve days rations ahead, so as to
meet an emergency at any time.

upon Van Dorn s army wherever it may

the services of his victorious cohorts may

they cannot maintain themselves in that

that, at the end of a very few weeks, all

Thanksgiving Day at Crescent City
Sabbath School.
Mb. Editor . It was our privilege to
wituess the fifth anniversary exercises of
this school, held on Tuesday, 27th ult.
It occurred to us that more than a
nassmff nonce is
notice is due this interesting
Sabbath School. There were over six
hundred officers, teachers, and children
present, besides a large representation
of our good citizens, among whom we
were pleased to notice Mayor laker,
Messrs. Samuel Orr, M. A. Lawrence,
Win. P. Iglehart, Dr. Jones, Ashby,
S. E. Gilbert, with many others.
The military was well represented by
Col. Baker, Col. Foster, Capt. Hurd, and
quite a number of other military gentle
men whose names we did not icarn.
After a number of "voluntaries" sung
as only the boys and girls of this school
do sing, led by the renowned Tileston,
the programme was opened by Rev. Mr.
Blythe, chaplain of Hospitals Nos. 1 and
4, who led in prayer. The assembly was
then addressed severally by Rev. W. H.
McCarer, Col. Foster, Capt Hurd, and
John Glover, Esq., a song intervening be
tween each speech. The teachers had
prepared ample refreshments, including
lots of " goodies," which were distributed
amongst the children by the teachers
and citizeni.
We never in our life saw a more smil
ing, laughing, happy set of young folks,
than we met on this occasion. Col. John
W. Foster assisted in the organization of
this school, and was for years its very
popular aud efficient superintendent.
When the Col. volunteered in the service
of his country, and exchanged his office
in this school for one in the 2oth Regi
ment Indiana Volunteers, we entertained
great fears that this excellent institution
would suffer by the change, and perhaps
" go under."
But we are. happy to know that our
fears have not been realized. Mr. H. F.
Blount, who succeeded Co!. Foster in its
management, tills the bill, and is perfect
ly at home at the head of this Division of
the great S. S. army.
ini-Jaii! 4Vi ' he, J,ae jovial
almost worship their teacher. The fe
male division is taught by two very nice
young ladies.
In his arduous duties, Mr. Blount is
assisted by many of our prominent busi
ness men and a host of good ladies who
serve most faithfully as teachers. Our
youngjfriend De Witt Lanphere is Secre
tary, and furnishes each child every Sab
bath with a beautiful S. S. paper. From
his annual report, we learn that no less
than fourteen thousand nine hundred
and seventy-six numbers of this paper
were distributed amongst the scholars of
this school during the year ending on
Thanksgiving day.
Infidels and scoffers may look upon
these things with contempt, and endeav
or to "laugh them to scorn," but no
branch of christian enterprise has been
more signally owned and blessed of God
than the Sabbath School.
We never enter this hall that we do
not in our imagination meet the full
round pleasant countenance of a boy
who now sleeps in death.
(. Uarles Canstadt was a German lad,
of over sixteen summers, was a good boy
naturally, but the religion of Christ.
which hejhad embraced, made him better.
He was a "regular" in this School al
ways when well to be found in his class.
We knew Charley well and had witness
ed the trial of his virtue and honesty.
He was also a patriot and when his
country called for help in the hour of
her danger and humiliation. ClinrW
, j
responded and joined Captain Willard's
Company, 14th Regiment, Indiana Vol.
unteers. For months he served his
but countryjfaithfully in Western Virginia,
contracted camp fever and died. Capt
Willard (who brought his remains home)
in reply to our inquiries about the gen
eral conduct of the boy soldier, said " he
was one of the best boys I ever knew
I loved him as my own son." Peace to
thy ashes brave youth, 'tis with a melan
cholly pleasure we call thy memory from
oblfvion and record thy MANLY deeds!
May thy surviving school fellows emulate
thy nobleness of character.
We command this School to the foster
ing, care of a liberal Christian public
and bespeak for it the prayers of all good
people.

truth shine through:
Army of the Potomac
Oct. 10, Br..
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secy of War:
In the execution of a long-conceived
plan, I have decoyed the pestiferous reb
el Stuart across the Potomac for the pur
pose of capturing him and his horse
thieving, coat-stealing, rear-driving clan.
The meshes of my net have been admir
ably laid, and the poor flutterer cannot
possibly escape. By a sort of poetic in
spiration, this Scotch descendant of some
cattle-lifting Mac was decoyed over at
Mac (Joys Ferry. JNoming nan so nap
py, or ingenious, was devised at Sebasto
pol. Let me in- anticipation of the certain
and joyful result, congratulate the glori
ous Cnion on the capture of this High
land cateran. He has been a " stench
iu the nostrils and smoke in the eyes"
of the Union troops ever since his tramp
arouud my rear in June last He, too, i
has been ever the avant-courier of the j
motley crew of rebels on my right flank, j
We have him now and there will be
" no more Bull Runs.
Respectfully,
G. B. McClellan,
Major General Commanding.

THIRD DISPATCH.
12 M., Oct 10, 1862. Stuart is rob
bing the Dutchf armers of their horses,
and giving tlejn orders, for payment,
upon me. He cannot travel with led
horses. We are drawing the meshes
around him. G. B. Mc.
FOURTH DISPATCH.
7:20 P. M., Oct. 10, 1863L Stuart has
entered Chambersburg and captured the
Dutch burgesses. They are too fat to
ride. Have a special train to take him
on to Washington; or would you prefer
to have him on exhibition at Washington?
Mr. Lincoln would, doubtless, like to
crack a few jokes upon him.
FIFTH DISPATCH.
6:15 A. M., Oct., 11. 1862. Stuart is
off from Chambersburg so heavily laden
with blankets, overcoats, shoes and boots
that he can hardly travel. Have the
train waiting at the Relay House.
SIXTH DISPATCH.
7:25 A.M., Oct. 11, 1S62. Stuart is
making for Frederick, just as I had
planned. I am tightening the net All
ri"ht He is bagged certain.

his horses are well blown and bag the en

been driven across the Potomac, Dutch
Burgesses, stolen blankets, overcoats,

ing feat without losing a man. This was
mainly owing to his great prudence in
not engaging the enemy. According
to my original plaD, Stuart was allowed
to cross back without molestation In
the language of my illustrious friend,
Mr. Seward, uin view of the waning pro
portions of the rebellion and the non-im-portance
of the individual, I give him up
with great cheerfulness."
And so this dangerous raid has been
suppressed without bloodshed. Surely
nothing of the kind was ever known at
Sebastopol.
