teachers of French, music and drawing.
-The Countess You Bismarck went after her
eldest son, a lieutenant of the Drat "dragoon
guards, who was wounded In a late battle, and
has Just returned with him to Berlin.
-When the victory of Metz was celebrated at
Berlin, a wealthy house-holder displayed, along
with the national colors, four Hags of black crape.
They were intended to commemorate the loss of
his four sons-ail kil e l in the present war. .
-It is rumored in Berlin in operatic circles that
Locei has temporarily retired from the stage on
account of the illness of her husband, which ia
likely to be prolonged for several months, as he
recovers but slowly from the effects of his wound.
-Sixteen rosy-cheeked maidens of Be:lin, em?

-The German. Government ls making ont a Hst
or objects of-art confiscated by the French In 1806,
and never restored. -Among them ls specified the
Sarcophagus or st. Elizabeth, which was enriched
with precious stones to an almost fabulous ex?

-Threeyoung Ap??ese were lately admitted
to the University pf Berlin. One of them ls the
son of thc chler physician tothe Tycoon, and ls fo
study law. The two others have chosen medicine.
AU three are said to converse fluently in German,
having peen ror some time residents or Berlin for
the purpos? of making themselves familiar with
the language. ' .
-Rewards for special acts or courage are ad?
vertised in the German papers. One paper has a
hst of these prizes which extends through several
columns. The rewards comprise recompense in
money, amounting in some cases to many thous?
ands cr thalers, besides gold medals, rifles, gold
watches, carriages, thousands bottles of wine
and innumerable other articles.
-The latest dramatic sensation In New York is
the introduction of a prizefighter In thc splendid
Shakespearean comedy, "As You Like lt." Jem
Mace, the pugilist, appears as Charles the wrest?
ler, and It ls found that more people go to see
him than to witness the play. During thc scene
in which he figures, the sensation, we are assured,
causes "little shrieks from the ladles," and the
triumph or the champion was greeted with "a
ripple of gloved applause throughout the house."
-The New Yoik Tribune pays its respects to
Senator Whittemore in the following words: "We '
hear of the Hon. B. P. Wnlttoniore, who was
hustled out of the House of Representatives for
selling cadetshlps. He ls elected to - the Stalte
Senate of South Carolina, and ls made chairman
of the' comm itt ee ou engrossed birts-a place tn
which he will be. reasonably free from tempts
tlon. Of course, the touching confidence which
this man's constituents still entertain In his in?
tegrity ia at once- gratifying to him'and to our?
selves. His neighbors are at full liberty to be?
stow upon him. au the merely local trusts of
which.they have the disposal, but the seat lu Con?
gress was a national matter, in which every ct ti -
zen in the. United States hadan interest. Sb long
as Mr. Whlttemore's constituents keep him '
severely at home, we promise not to complain a
great deal."
-Before tho war in Europe there was a large
and continually increasing emigration Into this
country from the French and Italian ports In the
Mediterranean. This emigration, which embraced
generally a thrifty and energetic business class
of men, has, since the war, almost ceased. The
Arcadian, which arrived at New York last week,
from the. Mediterranean, had only twenty-six
passengers, though, calculated for two hundred
and fifty at least. . The fact shows that this class
of persons among'the italians and French prefer
to stay at home, as It is not probable that the
reasons for -uch a remarkable Tallin? off aro alto?
gether, if at all, compulsory. The total foreign ,
immigration- or this year will rall very much ,
short or that of last year, and of the general !
average. As this Immigration contributes to
national wealth as Woll as to the increase of pop-. 1
ulatlon, an Indefinite but large pecuniary loss In" 1
this respect win be attributable directly to the j
European war.
-WendeU Phillips did not exhaust his vials or
wrath against the Radical party during the late
Massachusetts campaign, as appears by the text
of an article from bis pen in this week's National
Standard, entitled "Protests Against the Republi?
can Party." He says the "divisions among Re?
publicans In various States are no signs of hostili?
ty to the party; they are only protests agaiust
Its inactivity. Atalanta lost the race by stopping
to t?ck np the golden apples. Hannibal's sol?
diers lost Rome by walting to enjoy Capua.
And these leaders, many of them, once so earn?
est, aw now unmanned and demoralized by a
taste of the plunder. While they nearie down
to cosy enjoyment or squabble about office, the 1
country suffers.*' Elected on one question, they 1
I shut thetv ^eyea to t?pvefy. other. The bald,
h-?lvll rights^Se?t^S. will BO longer serve as
I'the vital principle .?f a party; there can be no
' tolerable politic0 which dote not stand as a hand'
maid to the religious sentiment of the hour. Of
this change the leaders o? the Republican party
do not seem to be aware. He describes the fit
tempt la Massachusetts to secure recognition of
temperance and worklngmen's claims, and holds
that the effect has been good and only good. Be
prophesies that wi'.hln ten yeare this country is
to be t led as never before, except by the slave
power, by the associated wealth and selfish ?inion
of corporations, which will do Its utmott to un?
dermine o sTanglc political liberty, and that the
self-contro born of temperance and the organiz?
ed ranks of labor arc t o be the bulwarks again* t lt
-The report of the comptroller of thc currency,
about which so much has been sn ld. is at last
printed. It ls brief and unimportant, containing
but one new positive recommendation, and that
is the placing under legislative restrictions of all
the deposits which centre in New York from the
country banks, and on which luterest ls paid
them, ne says these should be placed under
such restrictions as would obviate i he necessity
fo.- use by thc depository ban v. Ho adds that he
does not think a sweeping enactment would have
mach effect, as the city banks would find some
way to avoid lt, while private bau;:s would be
unrestrained. Regarding the new law of last
session for giving the West and Sooth increased
banking facilities, the comptroller speaks as fol?
lows: "The amonnt of capital to the Western ami
Southern Staus not permanently invested or ac?
tively employed In business of various kinds, but
available Tor the purpose of organizing national
banks, cannot be lnrge, and the Impression that
many millions of cash capital were awaiting the
opportunity of investment in national banks has
not been fully sustained. The provision made by
the late act Is undoubtedly ample for the supply
of those States whtoh have less than their propor?
tion, and would suffice to snpply all reasonable
demands, even ir not restricted in Its distribution.
The propriety of providing for the removal of
such restrictions after the expiration ot one year
rrom the date or the passage or the act Is recom?
mended." The report then adds that there are
1731 national banks in operation, and that thirty
one have been organized under the new law, tour
or which are gold banks.
The President's Message.
.Time was, in the better days of thc Re?
public; when a President's message had
something of the signiOcance and impor?
tance of a speech from the Throne in the
constitutional monarchies which the para?
doxical American both envies and derides.
Then, the words of the Chief Magistrate
were carefully weighed and deliberately ut?
tered, and Congress, looking to the good of
the country and not to the salvation of party,
lent a respectful attention to the matters of
pith aud moment which were submitted to
them. Nous avons chang? lout cela ! The
Radical revolution in the practice of the gov?
ernment; the concentration of power in the
hands of a factious Congressional majority;
the change from mea like Monroe, Jefferson
and'Mums to taciturn mediocrities of the i
Grant variety-these account for the little
respect which ?3 now paid to the vaticina- ]
tions and speculations of the Executive head ,
of the State. No wonder, then, that Presi?
dent G nm t's inaugural prattle about "thc '
"strong box locked up in the sterile moan- j
".tains of i he Far West," of which lie was '
symbollicaliy "forgiag the key," should have i
caused a titter at both cods of the Atlantic 1
Cable; or that his message of Monday last,
poking fun at the Revenue Reformers, should ;
cause no other sensation than broad grins j
and feeble applause. The public understand, i
however, that Congress will do what it ;
may choose, and they care very little for the
jest or earnest of his Excellency, Pr?sidant
Girant.
Yet, in some respects, it is a passing good ;
message. The country asks for the- aboli- ?
tion of the franking privilege, and a reform ?
in the civil service. But the reform should .
not be restricted to "the mode of appoint- j
"ing subordinate officials." The public ser?
vice requires reforming all the way down, bc- ,
ginuing with President Grant. When we have,
once more, a President who, by his dignity
and ability and the spotless purity of his
official character, is a worthy exponent of
the thought and vigor of the country,.then,
and not before, will the President's message
be accepted as something loftier and better
than au expression of the whims and fancies ,
of a knot of scheming politicians.
The most pregurtnt portion of the message i
is that which refutes to the Alabama claims j
and the fisheries. Taken in connection with .
the speeches of Geueral Butler in the East
and of General Hooker in the West, and j
with tho significant circumstance that the .
war speech of General Butler has been sent,
in pamphlet form, to all the foreign minis?
ters under the frank of the State Department, j
the recommendations of President Grant in?
dicate, with sufficient clearness, a desire to
conviuce the people that they have a sub- '
etantiul grievance for which they must ex?
act a full reparation. The proposition thal j
he be adowed to suspend certain laws, at his
own sweet will and pleasure, is what might ,
be expected from a President who has wit- j
ncssed the course'of Radical reconstruction
in the South, and has nobly done his part in i
violating the law and the constitution. We 1
doubt, however, that Congress will be wil?
ling to entrust so much power to a vaiu, '
weak man, and we know that, whatever the
temper of the Radical politicians, the masses i
of the people oppose war and love peace.
The Radicals cannot more surely nail down
thc lid of their political coffin than by squiut- .
ing at a foreigu war. ??
The President seeui3 to be ignorant of i
what tho people desire. They do approve of
the abolition of all restrictions upon the
ownership of foreign-built vessels. They do ?
desire revenue reform But they go farther I
than this. They a3k that the expenses of the
government be reduced; that the tariff be j
arrangeu fer revenue alone, and that this I
generation bc not culled upon to pay a war ?
debt which \va3 contracted-according to 1
the Northern idea-for the benefit of poster- \
ity, and which was heaped up-according to !
the Southern idea-during the process of .
overrunning and subjugating the fairest
States of the South. Honesty, Economy, '
Low Taxation-these are what the people f
Jemand, and. what they do not hope to ob- j
Lain from any administration of which Pre3- ?
ident Grant is the leader and responsible \
head.
The State Lunatic Asylum.
We print an article from tho Columbia
Phoenix, to whicli a brief reference has al- ?
ready been made, containing a statement of :
facts in connection with the terrible abu3es
said to exist in the management of the State j
Lunatio Asylum-an institution in which \
the people have taken a deep interest, and
whose philanthropic purposes commend it c
to the care and regard ot the public. It is 8
not doubted that Dr. Ensor is doing the beat.:
he can with the material' at his command;
brit the brutal tyranny of the neg^Tlarrte;
as described-bv*'the Phoenix, is' an outrage
upon decency abd propriety.-'
Governor Scott seems inclineoTto support
such measures as will increase the efficiency
of the institution and insure tho comfort
and well-being of its inmates, and we trust
that the General Assembly will require that
the existing condition of affairs be thorough?
ly investigated, with the object of protecting
the unfortunates who cannot care for them?
selves, and are, ns it were, the warde of the
State. If the coloredjunatics prefer to have
a colored keeper, we have no right to object,
bot we must protest against the practice of
submitting jvbite men and white women to
the capricious insolence and constant ill
treatment of a cruel and malignant negro.
Harris is, we believe, the secretary and
treasurer of the Asylum, a3 well a3 the head
attendant, and to keep him in a posilion for
which be is, by nature and temper, wholly
unfit, i3 only to prove that it is determined
to make use of the helpless and the afflicted
as a means of rewarding the hangers-on of a
political part}-. The man Harris was ap?
pointed, we presume, because he is a negro
Radical, and for that reason alone can he be
retained. _ r _
The Cherubic Kimpton.
A resolution has beeu offered by Sena?
tor Arnim requiring the Financial Agent of |
the State to make a full report of the mone?
tary transactions of which he bas bad charge.
This was necessary to be done. Governor
Scott says not a word of Mr. Kimpton in
bis annual message; nor does tbe Treasurer
or the Comptroller-General; as far as we
know, describe the involutions and evolu?
tions of the millions which have been com?
mitted to the Financial Agent's caro. The
circumstance that Mr. Kimpton i3 out of ]
favor at this time is, if true, no reason why
his accounts should not be exposed to the
public. Wo want to know what has become
of the .S2,700,000 in bonds of the State which
Kimpton held one year ago, according to the
report of the Comptroller-General. And we
should like to- be told, without circumlocu?
tion, what were the terms upon which Henry
Clews & Co., of New York, were willing to
take the $4,000,000 of Blue Ridge Railroad
guaranteed bonds, and whether the Franco
German war is the only reason why the ne?
gotiation fell through. Wo hope that Sena?
tor Arnim will push his resolution.
