# An tu?tier or?oformau'on fot our raa-V
, - dera, we give, ?/i ex?en*?, ID OUT precept
iuuc, the Annual Message of Gov.
SCOTT to the Legislature of the 6tato
DOW ?D 80<!8?OO.
Its tone is temperate nnd conciliatory,
nod in striking contrast with his former
State papors. U has previously been
, hi? h?bil to ?eise the opportunity winch
Buch papers afforded, to abuse and de
. noonee the respectability and intelli?
gence of the State, the inspiration find?
ing existence, no doubt, iu the fact that
all that clues of our people ignored and
contemned his udmini-tration. And thia
action und feeling, on tho part ot' tho
people, was inspired aa the very
natural result of the course pursued by
him as Governor of tho State. The
whoie course of his administration, up
to thia time, has bcerTin violation oi the
feelings and in hostility to the rights
.nd iutcrost of all that class of the peo
plo. One oluss or raeo was fostered,
. petted and upheld, even to a departure
from tho spirit aud letter of the law,
whilst the other class, which held th0
mass oP the property, and was th
source from wbioh the Stute Govern?
ment was financially sustniued, was
trampled upon aud discriminated
aguitist un ail occasious- And, to cul?
minate und on tot co this extraordinary
. discrimination, arms were placed in the
hands of tho favored race and denied to
the other. This, more than anvtbiug
else, probably, was calculated to excite
burning indignation aud bring constant
irritation aud collision. The effect of
such a oourse, as must have been ex
- peoted by Gov. SCOTT, have been to bring
the State to the very verge of oivil war
And that it did uot, in fact, burst out
in every part of tho Stato, was duo en
tirely to the forbearance and extraordi?
nary putieneo-of the whites. Such a
oourso of oppression and discrimination
against a particular class, and that the
belter olass, in auy State of tho North
or West, would have lighted tho fires of
civil strife and blood, aud a righteous
vengeance- would have been visited
upon tho usurper?.
But Gov. SCOTT now proposes a dif?
ferent course. He promises to be the
Governor of all the people, and to know
DO class or party in his administration
of the Government of tho State. He
also culls upon tho people, from the
spirit of bis words, to forget the oui*
mositics of tho past, and to inculcate
peace and harmonious co operation for
the general good. He also points out a
number of tho abuses of Government as
now administered, recommend* ccouomy
and retrenchment of taxation, and reform
in several special departments. If he be
in good earnest, and second his words by
aots which carry them forward, to all of
this, we doubt not, tho better class
will respond, and a day ol more law and
order, and peace and harmony aud
prosperity may dawn upou tho oom?
mouwcalth. In his hands and those ol
his party, is tho Government. If IK
and they wish pcaco and seek to attain
it, peace will no doubt prevail.

HALEIGH, November 29.-At 12
/clock M. to dav, io joint meeting of
the Legislature, ex Governor Z. li.
Vance was elected United States Sena?
tor. The vote Btood-Vaooe, 94;
Abbott, 43.
Governor Vance was serenaded at bis
lodgings this evening, at 6 o'clock, at
the Exe li ange Hotel, aod in response
to vocif?rons calls from an immenso
multitude delivered the following ad
dress. Having ju-* prepared to leavo
tho city, the address was necessarily
short:
FELLOW CITIZENS : I hardly know
what to say, how much to say, apd how
much not to say. I should be either
more or less than human if I did not
feel grateful to you and the people of
North Carolina for many kindnesses. I
am unable to account for the kindness
of the people in honoring meso often.
I know it cannot be for any superior
merit of my own. . I oat; onjjy attribute
it to one thing. Human nature is a
very common thing, and there isa great
deal of it in humanity. (Laughter.)
A great deal has beon said of tho hypo?
crisy of politicians, of the ingratitude
of republics : but it is a principio in
human nature that the man who serves
the people faithfully in any position
where that people place him,* be the
cause right or wrong, will be honored
by them. I must say that I feel that I
have done HO. I was reared a Whig ; a
I party devoted to the Union ; as a Whig
I fought disunion, and stood by the
Union even until in thc South general?
ly, feeling itself aggrieved, Unionism
became very unpopular. I still adhered
tu it until my State, in* her sovereign
capacity, attempted to' dissever her
connection with that Ua>iuD. I then
elected to go with my State, uiy kith
and kin. I laving joined' the army 1
determined to serve the new eause with
the sumo unswerving zeal with which I
had served that of the Union. I was
called upon to support ao'.s which hud
not beforo, and did not then meet my
approval for the general good. I served
us your Govornorj. I clung with you to
the cause, and did not surrender my
authority until tho last hungry, ragged
Confederate had laid down his arms.
Alter thc war terms upon conditions
wore held nut to thc people of the South
I would not accept terms that would
separate me fronfyou and thc brave boys
who went at your bidding. Thc longest
road hus a tum. I did not wish to rise
until I could rise with you. Thank
God, that time hus arrived. We go up
now. Wo may go down again, but will
go down together ; and I will ho ve with
mc good company - the best and bravest
hearts in thu lund with me. Jiooouse
our party han been triumphant there
are some who urge retaliation. This
should not bc no. Thebes^ antidote fur
tyranny, thc strongest weapon against
it, itt thc enactment of just and whole*
-oine laws. Now that wo havo the
government of North Carolina in our
hand?, we should not aim to avenge our
selves for the overriding of ci vii liberty
among us, hut wo should so arrange
that it cannot happen again-should
sec to it that no executive or other
authority cnn nguin attempt to destroy
our liberties. From the obtaining ol'
Magna Chart.? to tho present Jay no
attempt to override or abridgo it hus
been made that has not moro firmly rc*
established liberty. May it be so here.
It is truo that in the Inst five years we
have felt what is to bo without trial
by jury, to have arrests among ua with*
nut warrant, and th? freedom of thc
press abridged. All tho people under?
stand it now. lt behooves us now to
hutld up the great principles of our
liberty on the eternal rook of our great
country. Let unger, revenge ?nd re
tnlintion be ignored, und let the luws on
your statute boo'; bear tho impress of a
(Vee people, determined legitimately lo
maintain their I rc et ru tn- in my pince
io tho Senate I fdinll on&envor to serve
my gi out State und my country with

The President's message, it is said, will
foreshadow amnesty, and, tho recent
elections show tho. h.md writing on thc
wall. There are many great ?tciesmoii
among tho dominent party in Congress

OUR C?II?TO^'LETT?R.
COLUMBIA, S. C., Deo. 3.
C?rrente ?alamo this letter must be
written, and it is not difficult to dash off
an epistolary morceau Jrotn this ancient
capita). For Columbia is now a sweet
pluuc- redolent, glossy, and pungent
as a nosegay. Spend^a week hero ii you
want to get happy. Such a picture of
high lifo below stairs you never did see.
I can't take timo to write it out, but iu
few words for short, I rfu say, as afellow
citizen of this great universal sprcad
englo society, I never did and never
expect to, seo auytbing which eau como
pitl.in two miles and a half of such a
State Government Show Company.
Stick a pia thero, or make a chalk mark,
and then read on.
Big Bob Graham is to be Judgo of
the Charleston Circuit. Glory onough
for ono administration-Selah.
Moses (the eujd gentleman) it is
openly announced, has pot seventy-five
thousand dollars into the oanvass for U.
S. Senator (O whore did it como from ?)
and besides, has pap enough left to
merit a oontinuod puffing of himself and
son from tho Courier's "ipeoial."
Pearce, it is said, is backed by Spraguc,
with a still heavier pile. Others are
also in the field, and tho highest bid
will secure tho highest vote, and olect
the U. S. Senator. It is a blessed thing
that the most of the members hnv'nt
brains enough to run tho risk of insani?
ty-or such audden wealth you know,
ko.
In considering the etute of the country
this week, members of the 'Ouso made
most violent speeches. To hear them,
cue would suppose that nothing but
blood and brimstone would satisfy thom.
They may punch up thc lion too much,
even if they have him iu chains.
Joe Crews and his campaign in Lau?
rens are notable in thc record of the
week. With a large force of infantry,
cavalry and artillery, he succeeded
(what a constable or sheriff alone could
have done) io in resting and bringing
here some twelve of the prominent oiti*
aens of that county, on trumped up
charge?. The; were bailed out, but ut
once were re arrested on charges made
by Hubbard, and some of them arc
still iu jail. Tlte effort sectus to bc.
whether they cun't possibly force or
kick the up country ?uto a fight.
Whilletuure, the saintly, has a Bill
to stop the Ku Kluxing, by levying a
heavy special tax on "thc real estate"
of any county where rt is practiced.
Nothing lu the Bill to stop negroes
burning barns, by taxing eery black
mah where- such outrages occur. Thc
party, yuu know, only legislates in fa*
vor of one side. They spend uur money
here like water, whilo IcgiMlntiug to
oppress and torturo still more tho white
peoplo of the State By this means,
they ozpeot to m?ko this a grout couu*
try, and induce enterprise and CM pi i al to

The honorables adjourn over from
