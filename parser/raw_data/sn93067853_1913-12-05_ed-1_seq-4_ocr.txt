FRIDAY, DECEI
ELECTION BY PRIMARIES
President Wilson further urpes in
his messape the nomination of presiflpntinl
nonrli/lnlAr. :? 1 *
vuuuiuoics uy primaries, DUl
would retain conventions for the purpose
of framing platforms. He expresses
the view that there is a wide
tendency towards the direct vote. In
this he is certainly correct. The age
of true democracy is at hand. In the
next few years this will be seen by
the blind politicians as it is now seen
hy the seers of the nation.
PRESIDENT WILSON WOULD
HELP THE FARMER
President Wilson in his recent message
to Congress, urges measure of
currency reform that will prove of
lasting benefit to the farmers of the
country. He urges that special provision
be made for facilitating the
credits needed by the farmers. He
sees in the currency bill, now before
Congress, a measure which puts the
farmer upon an equal footing with
other business men. The exact dey'Is

WILSON'S
PHILIPPINE POLICY
President Wilson's Philippine policy
is in line with his other utterances
going to emphasize the principles of
democracy. He would lead the people
of the Philippines upward to self
government. He urges that they be
given more and more control of their
affairs and ultimately that they be
given complete self government. This
also is democracy. Then too. this
policy will not keep us in constant
turmoil with the other nations. The
land-grabbing policy is the policy
that leads to wars and rumors of
wars. Our country is so great in area
that we have no need of adding new
territory. Development of our vast
resources, not new conquests, should
be our aim.
\ NATIONAL HONOR
AND OBLIGATIONS
President Wilson in his first annual
message, says: "There is only
I one possible standard by which to de
termine controversies between the
A United States and other nations, and
V that is compounded of these two eleI
ments?our own honor and our obligations
to the peace of the world."
This utterance is the utterance of
a statesman far removed from the
plane of the demagogue. It is just
this high idealism in President Wilson
that is so confounding to his enemies
and harsh critics. The general
lack of sincerity and the presence of
no little hypocritical cant are too
often the chief elements in the utterances
of our public leaders. The
straightforward utterances of President
Wilson are so astounding that
they utterly disarm the carping critics,
and carry conviction to the hearts
of the people. Honesty, not falsehood,
is and will always he the foundation
upon which a nation can build permanently.

A tree peddler was here the other
day delivering a lot of fruit trees
and strawberry plants. Quite a num
ber of people were getting strawberry
plants and paying four dollars per
hundred for them?a little bunch
that would not more than fill a hall
gallon cup. The tree man claimed
they were everlasting strawberries
and some of them had blossoms or
them. Well, here is my experience
with ever lasting strawberry plants
I bought a hundred plants a few
years ago and I found out they hac
he wrong name, instead of beinp
ever bearing they were never bearing
for they never bore a pint of fruil
during their whole existence. Mj
berry plants have plenty of bloom:
on them now and I would have eiver
all who bought plants from the ped
dler, more than they bought anc
charged them nothing, but people wil
be humbugged in spite of all thai
can be said or done. My berries ar<

NEW HOPE, Dec. 12.?As I have
been absent so long I will come again

much. .The teachers deserve a lot of
credit for getting up such a play for
the community, but the teachers all
said they had such good material for
the play they could not help but make
it a success, and it sure was. Miss
Pardue is principal, her assistants
are the Misses Engle and Holman.
These teachers are very attractive
looking young ladies and the old
bachelors and widowers will want to
join the old maid club, I guess. One
has already said he wanted to be a
member of it. There was a very large
crowd to witness the play and the patrons
all appeared to enjoy seeing
their children act their parts so well,
and to know they had been trained b^
fully experienced hands. Have
another play young ladies and Moxy

us know.
