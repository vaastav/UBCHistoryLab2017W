A wild ride with murderers and rapists as their
overlords was the terrorizing experience of four
Ottawans late last night, when a band of thirteen
convicts who escaped
from the Joliet peniten
tiary yesterday morning
took possession of the 12:42 C. O. 4
P. car, held up and robbed the past
engers at the point of guns, divested
men of their clothing, and then drove
the car at a terrific rate over twelve
mile to, a point where they consider
ed they could make their escape.
Not content with robbing their vic
tims of their valuables, the convicts
assaulted two of the passengers and
tired a shot in an attempt to kill'
Motorman Kiel B. Richards, then
drove him from his cab and one of
the motly crew took hold of the con
trollor and operated the car as skill
fully as any veteran motorman.

rtui the president's wishes.
President Wilson In his address to
congress recommended an immediate
declaration of . war, on Austria-Hungary,'
So far as "Turkey and Bulgaria
are concerned the president said that
they were merely tools of Germany
and a declaration of war is not need
ed at this time.
THE MESSAGE.
The following is President Wilson's
address In part:
"Gentlemen of Congress: Six
months have elapsed since I last had
the honor of addressing you.
"They have been months with ev
ents of grave significance for us. 1
shall not undertake to detail or even
summarize them. The practical par
ticulars of the part we have played
in them will be laid before you in
the reports of the executive depart
ment.
"I shall discuss only our present
outlook upon these vast affairs, our
present duties and the immediate
means of accomplishing the objects
we shall hold always in view.
"1 shall not go back to the causes
of the war. These Intolerable wrongs
done and planned against us by the
sinister master of Germany have long
been too grossly obvious and odius to
every true American to need to be re
hearsed. "Uut I shall ask you to consider
again and with a very grave scrutiny
your objectives in the measures by
which we mean to attain them; for
the purposo of discussing here in this
place and our definite ends. Our ob
ject is, of course, to win the war;
and we shall not flatter or suffer our
selves to be diverted until it is won.
But It is worth while asking and ans
wering the question, 'When shall we
cousider the war won?'
"Prom one point of view It is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. I do not doubt that tho Am
erlcan people know what the war is
about and what sort of an outcome
. they will regard as a realization of
their purpose 4n It. As a nation we
are united in spirit and In person. 1
pay little heed to those who tell mc
otherwise. I hear the voices of dis
sent, who does not? I hear the critl
oIbiii and the clamor of the noisy
thoughtless and troublesome. I also
see men hero and there fling them
selves in impotent disloyalty against
the calm, Indomlnable cause of the na
tion. I hear men deface my peace,
who understand neither Its nature
nor the ways is which we obtain it,
with confident eyes and unbroken
spirit. But 1 know that none of these
speak for the nation.
"They do not touch the heart of in
nocenBe. They may be safely lead
to state their uneasy hour and be for
gotten. But from another point of
view I believe that It Is necessary to
say plainly that we here at the seat
of action, consider the war to be for
and what purt wo mean to play In
quitted himself of every duty he had
accepted and to which he willingly
dnvcied, every energy at his command
for the glorious cause of God in his
high office for the salvation of souls.
The preacher showed the great loy
alty of the late Father to the cause
of God by the evident surviving
monument in the splendid church
parish building he left behind him, in
the great religious and moral monu
ments of enduring piety and devo
tion Ife has nurtured in his great
charge the love of truth and charity
which he ever instilled into all heart?
with whom ho came 'in contact; hi
splendid patriotism and love of coun
try with love of God and souls, likv.1
the True Master, a pastor, a leader, a
guide and a father whose memo;
shall last forever in the splendid and
cnnsDling work of this priest.
Father Conway congratulated the
people of St. Patrick's, Ottawa, in the!
appointment of the successor to
Father Quirk in the person of the
Rev. Father Hackett, a close friend
and admirer of Father Quirk for many
years and one who would keep the
memory of Father Quirk fresh and
lasting as a worthy successor and a
worthy pastor who would lead them
as the devnled Father Quirk led them
in all the way of God under his gen
ie administration.

The only thing I must tell you is

MISS RIBBS BRIDE
OF PAUL WEEDEN
Miss Luclle Ribbs, daughter of Mrs
William Ribbs, of West Jackson
street, and Paul CI. Weeden, or Chi
cago, were quietly married thin after
noon at 2:3i at the First Methodist
church in the presence of their imme
diate relatives The couple were un
attended.
The bride was beautifully gowned
'lit n taupe colored traveling suit with
u taupe colored hat to match. 1 he
being the only woman among the pas
sengers. Mr. Reynolds is a former
Pbiladelphian and came here last
spring to change positions with Rob- .
ert Hayward, who had a R. F. D. route
northwest of town. The Reynolds
3pent the day in Chicago and were re
turning by interurban after they had
missed their train at Joliet. , .
The first evidence of trouble came,
when the crew stopped to take on
passengers at Dupage crossing, three
miles east of Mlnooka. The thirteen "
men, garbed In nondescript layouts,
came aboard. Tho men scattered
about the car, some of them going
into the smoker, other remaining at
the dividing partition and the. rest -hanging
about the rear vestibule.
The first warning of a hold up came
when one of the prisoners at the en
trance to the smoking compartment
shouted, "Don't move or I'll shoot."
The startled passengers looked up to
find themselves facing a menacing re
volver. Behind the gun was a deter
mined face that bore every evidence
of ninth degree vilany. The rest of the
convicts came to the aid of their com
panion and in a few seconds had the
motorman, conductor and other occu
pants of the car entirely subdued.
Motorman Niel Richards was com
manded to leave his cab after a shot
plowed thru the door and struck the
wall near his head. The bullet flat
tened against the steel wall and la now
being kept by hlin as a souvenir.
Needless to say he obeyed the com
mand, crawling thru the small door to
the smoker, where one of the men
stood guard over him.
Conductor Herman Kammerer was
commanded to sit in the corner of the
car, where the convicts began empty
ing his pockets of whatever money
lie had. They obtained something
like $2:.0 from him, the bulk of which
was company money. Unfortunately
he had Saturday's and Sunday's turn
ins in his pockets, besides a goodly
sum of his own money. A diamond
ring In wore on his finger he 6lipped
from view by' dropping it onto the
Moor behind his seat. The robbers
did not get this Jewel and it was
recovered after they abandoned the
1 1 .'.
Joe O-orgas, agud 32, an Austrian,
was hit over the head with a beer
bottle, when he fought against giving
up his clothes. He said he willingly
turned over what money he had $30
but he wanted to keep his clothing.
One of the men grabbed him by the
throat and started to choke him. An
other came up from the rear and
crashed the bottle down on his head.
