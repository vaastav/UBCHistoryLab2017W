...companiia for campaign purposes, but
:."I hav*' heard nothlng of Mr. Cortelyou
*."or any one else paying back money
?ttbat is due to these companies and
ti^vhich belongs to widows and children.
;;It wlll be recalled that the President,
":;in his message to Congress last year,
^recommended that railroads be for
? Mddden to contrlbute to campaign
funds, but he was very careful not to
prefs upon his party in Congress the
passage of such a blll."
