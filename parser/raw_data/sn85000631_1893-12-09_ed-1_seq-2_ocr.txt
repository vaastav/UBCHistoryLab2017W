Old Fort Crawford, below Ouray,
Col., Is shortly to be demolished. The
fort has an interesting history, being
the vicinity where the Utes committed
their many crimes.
The cheese mite is more tenacious of
life than any other insect. Leuwen
tioeck glued one to a pin in order to
make a microscopical examination, and
in this situation it lived eleven weeks.
A high stone wall shuts in the garden
of Gray's Inn, London. The municipal
authorities have ordered that the wall
be removed and an open iron fence
substituted, in order that the passerby
may enjoy the beauties of trees and
flowers.
The largest gasometer in the world
is at Kast Greenwich, England. When
full it contains 12,000,000 cubic feet of
gas. It weighs 2,220 tons, is 180 feet
high, 350 feet in diameter, requires
1,200 tons of coal to till it with gas,
and cost $:00,000.
The navigation of the Dead sea is the
latest step in Oriental progress. The
sultan has sent two sailin gboats there,
one for freight and one for passengers.
Abdul Humid is suing to try to make
money out of lb'' salt, bitumen and
sulphur of the lake.
If Hi." Hawaiian kingdom wire put
up at auction it would not bring as
much money as the newspapers of the
United Stales have paid for setting the
type from which the correspondence re
lating to that interesting group of vol
canic excrescences has been printed.
It is not characteristic of the pious
and peaceful French-Canadians—this
blackguard attempt to destroy the Nel
son monument at Montreal with dyna
mite. The odium of the act should
rest on the three law students who
eomniitled it.
The largest, tish caught in the Colum
bia river so far this season was a stur
geon measuring 11 feet 5 inches long
and weighing 705 pounds, which was
landed at Ivnappton, Wash., a week or
so ago. The head alone weighed 151
pounds, and the lish yielded 427 pounds
of edible meat.
The government of Nicaragua has
brought suit against the Nicaragua Ca
nal company for failure to complete the
iitch between the two lakes within the
.time specified in the international agree

consist mainly of Warner Miller's nerve.
Nicaragua will not pay her national
debt with the proceeds of her suit.
It Was hardly necessary for Miss
Phoebe Couzins to announce a short
time ago that she had been practicing
law for twenty-two years. The fact
that she presented a bill for $2,000 to
the treasury department for services
as secretary of the board of lady man
agers of the world's fair was evidence
enough of her profession and her ex
perience therein.
French doctors are minifesting much
IMirest in the American discovery of a
cure for consumption. They are not
inclined to rccept innovations upon es
tablished practice, but the results of
teste applied in the iiospjtals of Paris
have staggered them. It seems proba
ble that Europe will have to .look to
the United States for new theories in
medicine as well as in otter iields of
research and invention.
A negro in Floyd county, Georgia,
dressed himself in a sheet a few days
ago and started out. at dusk to "scare
the-life out'of a white womanP against
whom he had a grievance. He inter
cepted her as she was returning to the
house frcm the well and she came
near beating the life out of him with
the iron bucket Bhe carried. He is in
the hospital seriously injured.
A number of merchants have intro
duced a new gas burner and fixture re
sembling in appearance a lamp and giv
ing a strong, white light. The con
trivance is constructed upon the prin
ciple of a Bunsen burner. In the flame
is suspended a gauze bag of some ma
terial which when heated becomes In
candescent. These little ba^s will burn
for 000 or 700 hours, when they are
replaced by new ones.
As a result of the successful photo
graphic experiments recently made at
the heighth of a mile above Philadel
phia, an English paper suggests that to
each army corps there should be at
tached a staff of photographers. It
points out that more effective work can
be done upon the reconnoissance with
the camera than with the sketch book,
and that the staff could readily be made
a part of the engineers.
The Armenians are the most lntelll

unlike most orientals, they educate girls
as well as boys. Even the humblest
classes'have a thirst for education.

Washington. Doe. 4.—President Cleveland's
annual message, which was read in con
grt'SH KOOII lifter t.lint body convened nt
noon for its tifty-tliird regular session, is
as follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
Tlii! coiislititti.inal duty which requires I lie
president from time to time to give thecon
gress information of the state of the Illicit
and recommend to their consideration fetich
matters as lie shall Judge necessary Is fit
tingly entered upon by commending to the
congress a careful examination "f the
detailed statements and well-supported rec
ommendations contained in the re|Hris of
the heads of departments who are culefly
charged with the executive work- of the
government. In an effort to abridge this
communication as much jis is ciuislstent
wlih its purpose, I shall supplement a brief
reference to the con tents of these depart
mental reports by the mention of such
executive business and incidents as are not
embraced therein, and by such recoinuieiid
tions as appear to be at this particular
lime appropriate.
While oirr foreign relations have not. at
rill limes during the past year been entirely
free from perplexity, no embarrassing situ
ations remain that will not yield to the spir
it of fairness and love which characterize
a truly American foreign policy.
of lie outbreak In Itrazll the president
siivs: The struggle is between the estab
lished govi rnment. which controls the nia
chinerv of administration, and with which
we maintain friendly relations, and certain
officers of the navy employing the vessels of
their command in an attack upon the
national capital and chief seaport, anil
lacking, as it does, the elements of divided
adiuUiislratlbn, I have failed to see that
the insurgents can reasonably clnjin rec
ognition its beHgerents. Thus far the posi
tion of our government has been that of an
allciilive but impartial observer of the uu
fortunate conflict.
The questions affecting onr relations with
C.rcat I'.iltaln have been treated in a spirit
of friendliness. Negotiations are ill progress
between the two governments with a view
to sneli concurrent action as will make the
awaril and regulations agreed .upon by the
Iteriiig sea tribunal of arbitration prnctl
callv effective, and it is not .doubted that
tlrc'at Itritaiu will co-operate freely with
this country for the accomplishment of
that purpose*. The dispute growing out
of tho (UxM.iuoniary tolls imposed in the
WMhiwI rnnn! upon cargoes of cereals
bound lo ami from tho lakti ports of tho
Vniteil States was adjusted liy.the substitu
tion of a more equitable schedule or
charges, and my prclecessior thereupon s'iSj
pended Ids proclamation impuslng discrim
inating tolls upon liritish 'transit' throhgh
our canals. A request for .additions to the
list of extraditable offenses covered by the
existing treaty between the two countries
is under consideration.
A *i»oclal Hawaiian MOHMIKC.
•It is hardly necessary for me to state
that tlie questions arising from our rela
tions with Hawaii have caused serious em
barrassment. ,,
JUKI: prior to the installment of tlie pres
ent administration tlie existing government
of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown
and a treaty of annexation had been ne
gotiated between the provisional
liient of the Islnnils and' the I, lilted States
and submitted to the senate for ratification.
This treaty I withdrew for examination,
and dispatched Hon. James II. lSlount of
(ieorgia to Honolulu as a special conunis-.
sinner to make an Impartial investigation
of the circumstances attending the change
of government and of all the condition^
hearing upon the .subject of the treaty.
After a thorough and exhaustive, examina
tion .Mr. Blount submit ted to me his re
port. showing lieyoijd all question "that the•
constitutional government of Hawaii hail
been subverted with the active aid of our
representative to 'that government and
through the intimidation caused by the
presence of an armed naval force of the.
United States, which -was landed for that
purpose at the instance of our minister.
Upon- the facts developed, it seemed to tiie..
the only honorable course for our govern
ment to pursue wgs to' tlnilo the wrong that
had been been done by those representing
lis. and to restore us far us practicable the
status existing' at. the time of.our forcible
intervention. With a"' view of accomplish
ing this result within- the constitutional
limit of executive power and recognizing
all our obligations and responsibilities grow,
ing out of any ••hanged condition brought
about, by our unjustifiable interference, our
present minister at Honolulu .has received
appropriate instuctions to that. end. Thus'
far no information of the accomplishment
of any definite results has bpen. received.
When received they will be promptly sent.
to congress, togetlmr with all othev Jtifopma

Silver I'dri-liuxe Itcpeal.
The recent re|ieal of the provision of law
requiring the purchase of silver bullion by
the government as a feature of our mone
tary scheme has made an entire change in
tlie complexion of our currency affairs, and
1 do not doubt that the ultimate result of
this action will be most salutary uud far
reaching. In the nature of things, however,
it Is impossible to know at this time pre
cisely what conditions will be brought ubout
by the change, or what, if any, supplement
ary legislation may in the light of such
conditions, appear to be essential or ex
pedient. Of course, after the recent finan
cial perturbation, time Is necessary for
the establishment of business confidence.
W'lien, however, through this restored con
fidence the money which has been fright
cued Into hoarding places Is returned to
trade and eiiterprUe, a survey of the sit
uation will probably disclose a safe path
leading to a permanently sound currency,
abundantly sufficient to meet every require
ment of our Increasing population and of
business, lit the pursuit of this object we
should resolutely turn away from alluring
and temporary expedients, determined to be
content with nothing less than a lasting
and con.prehensive. financial plau. In these
c'.icuinstances 1 am convinced that ii rea
able delay In dealing with tills subjeet,
instead of being 'Injurious, will increase tiie
piol ubilitles of wise action.

The report of the postmaster general con

Atooliab the Fee System.
The report of tlie attorney general con
tains the usual summary of fhe nfTalrs nhdi
pMceedings of tbe departine.it .of justice foe
the past year, together with certain r&diri
roenilatlons as to needed legislation on vari
ous subjects. I cannot too heartily Indorse
the proposition that- the fee system, as
applicable to the compensation of United
States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal
courts aud United States commissioners,
should be abolished with.as little delay an
powlble. It Is clearly In the Interest of the
community that the business of the courts.
t-
both civil and criminal, shall be as small
and as inexpensively transacted as tile
ends of justice will allow. The system is,
therefore, thoroughly vicious .which imtkeS'
the compensation of court ofllclalH defrend
upon the volume of such-business, aud thus
creates a conflict between proper exe utlon
of the law uud private gain, whlc'i cannot
fall to be dangerous to the rights and free
dom of the citizens, an Irresistible tempta
tion lo the unjustifiable expenditure of
public funds.
I also heartily Join the attorney general
in recommending legislation fixing degrees
of federal Jurisdiction, us lias been done In
many of tlie states, authorizing writs of
error on behalf of the government in cases
where final judgment is rendered against
the sufficiency of an indictment or against
the government upon any other question
arising before actual trial limiting the
rlgiit of review in cases of felony punish
able only by fine and imprisonment to the
circuit court of appeals, uud making speedy
provision for the .construction of such pris
ons and reformatories as may lie necessary
for the confinement of United States con
victs.
Aarrlcnlture.
The report of the secretary of agriculture
will be found exceedingly interesting, es
pecially to that large part of our citizens
Intimately concerned in the agricultural oc
cupation. On the 7th day of March, 1893,
there was upon its pay roils 2,430 employes.
This number has beeen reduced to 1.850 per
sons. In view of a depleted public treasury
and the imperative demand of people for
economy In the adminlstratlon of their gov-,
eminent, tiie secretary .has entered uponi the
tusk of rationally reducing expenditures by
the elimination from the pay rolls of all
persons not. needed for un efficient conduct
of the affairs of the department. During
the first quarter of the present year the ex
penses of tlie department aggregated $345,
970.76, as a-gainst $402,021.42 for the corre
sponding period .of the. fiscal year, ending
June 3Q, 1*S)3. The secretary makes appar
ent his intention to continue this rale of re
duction ly submitting estimates, ior. the
next fiscal year J(.sf1.by.$Ml4,280 than those
fjr .the present'year.?
The amount of the appropriation for the
bureau of animal industry' for the current
fiscal year is $856,000. The estimate for the
ensuing year is $700,000, The regulations of
1S92 .concerning Texas fever have .been en
forced during the lust year, and the large
stock yards of the country have been, kept
free from Infection.
The total number of Inspections of cattle
for export during the past fiscal y.ejir .Wig,
611,542. The exports show a falling' off' Or
about 25 per cent
from'the
preceding y«ft¥
the decrease occurring entirely in the. last
half of the year. This' "suggests that
pounds,
for the prccediu'g year. Tiie falling off in
'this export was not confined, however, to
inspected pork, the total quantity exported
ill 1892 being 065.490.616 pounds, while In
1893 it was onjy 527,308i695 pounds. i,
The exports of agricultural products from
ilie United States for .the fiscal j'ear ending
June 30. 1892, attained the enormous fig
ure 6t $800,000,000 'in rbund numbers/ibelog
78.7 .per cent of. our total .exports. In the
last fiscal year'this aggregate' was gi'oatjy

Tariff Reform
Economy In public -xpenditufe is a duty
that cannot innocently be neglected by
those entrusted with the control of money
drawn from the people for public uses.
It must be confessed that our apparently
endless resources, the /amlllarlty of our
people with immense acciimul itions of
wealth the growing sentiment among them
that the expenditure of public money
should lu some manner be to their immedi
ate und personal advantage the indirect
and almost stealthy manner In which a
1
ftntf
falling off may have been largely due to an
increase in the price, of American export
from
Jhe ^patent
of ftroseciithig agrkiult'
Viral investigations and procuring agricult
ural statistics. From this small beginning
tiie seed division of the department of agr
riculture lias grown to Its present unwieldy
and unjustifiable extravagant proportions.
'During tlj'e last flseal year the cost.of seeds
purchased was $66,548.61. The remainder
of dii appropriation of' $l35,p.'0 wjis ex
pended In. putting-them up. and distributing
•bln"each state and tirrltpry„8U. agricultural
experiment station has been .established.
a a a
urgent have been revolutions,.' .These -Stations,, by their ,very character. ?ml
,g
large part ol' our taxes are exacted, and
a degenerated sense of official accountability
have led to growing extravagance in gov
ernmental appropriations.
'. 'Hie duty of public economy is also of
immense importance in its intimate and
necessary relation to the task now in hand
of providing revenue to meet government
expenditure and yet reducing the people'*
burden of crate taxation. After a harii
struggle tariff reform Is directly before
us. Nothing so important claims our atten
tion and nothing so clearly presents itself
as both an opportunity and a duty—an op
portunity to observe the gratitude of our
fellow citizens, a duty imposed upon us by
our oft-repeated professions and by the
emphatic mandate of the people. Alter full
discussion, our countrymen have spoken In
favor of this reform, and they have con
fided the work of Its accomplishment to
the hands of those who are solemnly pledged
to It.
If there is anyi".lng In the theory of a rep
resentation in public 'places of the people
aud their desires, if public officers are really
he servants of tiie people, anil If political
promises und professions have any binding
force, our failure to give I he relief so long
awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing
should interfere to distract, our attention or
disturb our effort until this reform ..is. ac
.'coniplished by wise and careful legislation.
While we should staunchly adhere to the
principle that oul.v the necessity of revenue
justifies the imiiosition of tariff duties and
other federal taxation, and that they should
be limited by strict economy, we ..cannot
close our eyes to the fact that conditions
have grown up among us In which justice'
iind fairness call for discriminating care'in
the distribution of such duties and taxation
as the emergencies of our government
•actually demand. Manifestly, if we are 'to
aid the people directly through tariff re
form one of the most obvious features
should be a reduction in present tariff
"charges upon the necessaries of life. The
benefits of such a reduction would be pal
pable and substantial, seen and-felt by the
.thousands who would be better fed and bet
ter clothed and belter sheltered. These gifts
should be the willing benefactions of a gov.
eminent whose higher function Is the pro
motion of the people. Not less closely re
.Iateil to our people's prosperity and well
•Tieing Is the removal of the restrictions
..upon the importation of the raw materials
necessary to our manufacturers.
The world would be open to our ingenuity
anil enterprise. This caunot be while fcdrul
legislation through the imposition of high
tariff forbids to American manufacturers as
icheap material as those used by their compe
titors. It is quite obvious that the enhance
ment of the price of our manufactured pro
ducts resulting from this policy not only
confines the market for these products with
in our own borders to the direct disadvan
tage of our manufacturers, but also 'In
creases their cost to our citizens. The inter
ests of labor are certainly, though Indirect
ly, involved in this feature of our tariff
system. The sharp competition and active
struggle among our manufacturers to supply
the limited demand for their goods, soon till
the narrow market to which they are con-,
.fined. Then follows a suspension of work in'
mills and factories a discharge of employes
and distress in the homes of our worklng
men. Even if the often disproved assertion
could be made good, that a lower rate of
wages would result from free raw material
and low tariff, does the Intelligence of our
workliigiuen lead them quickly to discover
that their steady employment permitted by
free raw material Is the most Important
factor In their relation to tariff legislation.
A measure lias been prepared by the ap
propriate congressional committee eniobdy
ing tariff reform on the lines nerein sug
gested. which will be promptly submitted
for legislative action. It is tlie result of
much patriotic and unselfish work, and I
believe It deals with its subject as consist
,ly and thoroighlv as existing conditions
permit. I am satisfied that he reducd tar
iff duty provided for In the proposed legis
lation. added to the existing internal reve
nue taxation, will in the near fiiure.
bough, perhaps, not Immediately, produce
sufficient revenue to meet the needs of th
government. The committee, after full con
sideration. and to provide against a tempo
rary deficiency which may exist before the
business of the country adjusts Itself to
the new tariff schedules, have wisely cm
braced In their plan a few additional In-,
ternal revenue taxes, including a small tax
upon Incomes derived from certain Corpo
rate Investments.
The new assessments are not only abso-.
lntelv just and easily borne, but they have
the furtliernicnt of being such as can be re
mitted without unfavorable disturbance
whenever the necessity of their imiiosition
no longer exists. In my great desire for the
success of this measure I cannot restrain
the suggestion that if success can only be
attained by means of unselfish counsel on
the part of the friends of tariff reform, and
as a result of their willingness to subordi
nate personal desires and ambitions to the
general good. The local interest affected by
the proposed reform are so numerous and
so varied that if all are Insisted upon the
legislation embodying the reform must in
evitably fall.
In conslusion my intense feeling of re
sponsibility impels me to Invoke for.,the
manifold Interests of a generous and con
fiding people the most scrupulous care and
to nledfje my willing support to every legis
lative effort for the advancement of the
greatness and prosperity of our beloved
country.

If nobility may be estimated in dollars,

code. Is with a fence rail- or a lniard. The
man who collected horse and mule 'statistics
for the census report shows that the'average
price of a mule is ¥7 more than, the average
price of a horse. The ordinary mule in
South Carolina, which owns about (5.000 of
the long-eared beasts, is worth shout $00
the average price of a horse in the same
state Is about 170. Texas prqftably, has
more mules (about 200.000) than Any other
state. The average price is about $41i or
nearly twice the value of a Texas horse..
In Missouri mules are worth about $7 more
and in Kentucky about $3 more .than houses.
Only a few states have no mules, or so few-'
that tbe statistician didn't make a note of
them. One of these states is Rhode .Island,
which the inuie driver of Texas doubtless
would think is not any too large a pastur
age and play ground for a festive muie of
Southern birth. Oregon is the otjly state
where horses bring higher prices 'than
mules. The ordinary mule out there Is
worth $40 and the horse S51. The figures
for alCallfornia are, Mules, $67 horses.
$46. In Pennsylvania, where mules, famous
for longevity, are much uBea in the mines,
they bring about "$80: horses. $67. In this
state there are seventy times as man*
horses as there are mules, which number
about 14,000. A New York mule Is worth
$01 and a horse $76. Mules are prized more
in New Jersey than in any other state the
average price being about $100. or $30 more

VVasliuigtmi,. Dec. 4.—Interest in the
.regular session oif congress, wiiich con
yeneii* to-day. will center at the house
wing of
7tlie:
capitol, where the new tariff
bill is on the way. An enormous pressure
for legislation of all kinds will exist from
the first, but as son as the decks can be
cleared the tariff bill will have the right
of way. Tlie extraordinary session
showed the purpose not o.nly of eliminat
ing tbe stiver, ijtiostipn but advancing
the., tariff problem fotlr months on the
road ,of solution. ...The Wilson bill will
be intro'diiced in "the house tbe latter part
of the week, probably Thursday. On that
day the ten days allowed by the rule
under which the tariff bill was filed dur
the recess will" expire. The McKinley bill
was not reported to the house until
April 18. If the Republicans attempt
to prevent the reporting of the bill this
week on the ground that the ten days
allowed them shoiild not be: deemed to
have beguii until the Democrats of the
committee furnish the estimates, as yet
not havinjj been completed, the claim can
and .probaiblyj will be set up in opposition
that the order under which the Repub
licans wore allowed the ten days In
wliicli to make their report was a recess
order, -and:'its-. terms having been com
plied with the orders fail at the opening
of the regular session and the statue quo
is restored. The estimates of the revenue
to be .derived from the tariff bill are com
pleted 'and will' be submitted toi-inorrow.
They show, that the deficit in the reve
nues on the. basis of a governmental ex
penditure of $550,000,000 a year will be
raised to $.05,000,000, which, might be
raised from* iiici-oased internal revenue
(axes or an income tax. It is not proba
ble that the tax on whisky, will be in
creased more tliaii 10 cents, per gallon,
which will increase the revenue from this
sOtifcce" $10,000,000. Although jt was at
one timp last week practically decided in
an-mfbrihar way to impose a tax on the
incomes. of corporations and legacies,
there has been a change of sentiment,
and it is almost certain that a. straight
.ta^ .ou^ndividwal incomes of over $5,000
will be recommended. liven if the Wil
son bill is reported this week, it. is not
expected that debate can begin until next

great rapidity, the flames having swept
through the entire length of the building
before the firemen arrived. Warehouse
No. 2 next caught fire, and, being a one

mass of flaiiics. Both buildings were en
tirely destroyed, with all their contents,
consisting of a largo quantity of cement,,
salt, starch, sugar, canned goods, brooms,
kerosene, tar paper -and machinery. The

policy of the new ministry, which will

as that of the Dupuy cabinet against an
inccmc tax. a revision of the constitu

to pursue a democratic policy, and will
agree to the proposal to establish a su

Baking Powder the highest honor® i)
the recent Worid's Pair, the *xamina

which was the best, and which has
been made public, skows the leavening

The Royal, therefore, was found of 20

however, in the quality of the food It
makes, as to fineness, delicacy and
wholesomeness could not be ineasnred
by 4gures. It lg these high qualities,
known and appreciated by the women

to exceed the sale of alt other baking
