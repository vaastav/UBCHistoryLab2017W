THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Jo thr Congress of the United States: ,
you are confronted at the threshold of your
Illative duties with a condition of the na
tional finances which imperatively demands
4,mpdiate and careful consideration.
The amount of money annually exacted, j
through the operation of present laws, from J
the industries and necessities of the people, j
largely exceeds the Mini necessary to meet the j
-xpnses of the Government.
Wh-n we consider that the theory of ourin
,titnti"ns guarantees to every citizen the full i
-njovnient of all the fruits of his industry and j
ntrpri'-e, with only sti-h deduction as may !
lv hi-- share toward th'j careful and econom-
leal maintenance of the Government which
or tect-s him, it is p!ain that the exaction of
more than this is indefensible extortion.and a j
-jpah!e betrayal of American fairness and
-l-cJcp. This wrong inflicted upon those whc !
bear the burden of national taxation, like j
other wrongs multiplies a brood of , evil con- ;
acqunces. The public treasury, which should j
nly exist as a conduit conveying the peo- !
pie's tribute to its legitimate objects of ex- i
peniiture, becomes a hoarding place for j
money needlessly withdrawn from trade and j
'Ji" ipieV u-e. thus crippling our national j
..neries. suie!;duig o:ir country's develop -
iu"Mf. preventing investment in productive '
nterprise. threatening tinancial disturbance, ;
and inviting schemes of the public plunder.
Tins condition of our Treasury is not alto- ;
anther i.evv, and it has more than once of late
been submittal tothe peoples representatives I
in the Congress, who alone can apply a j
reniedv. And yet the situation still continues, 1
n it h aggravated incidents, more than ever ;
presaging financial convulsion and wide- j
pr'ad dis.'1-ter. I
' It will not do to neglect this situation be- j
. nise its dangers are not now palpably ;
imminent ; and apparent. They exist none the j
4..-.s ertainly, and await the unforeseen and j
un-xj. -ted occasion when suddenly they will j
ho piecinated on us. I
i n the 'Mh day of June, lv", the excess j
of revenues over public exjenditures, alter
.'omplving with the annual requirements of j
rue sinking fund act. was 17,8 V.,7.T).X4; dur- j
i rig the yar ended .June 30, 1S8, such excess j
.r,,nt ti. 4? 1AT ;".4." .'20. and duriner the i
year ended June .TO, 1'K7, it reached the sum
f m, V7,S40..54.
The annual contributions to the sinking
fund during the three years above specified,
amounting in the aggregate to .SlSS.OoV
ttJO.94, and deducted from the surplus as
rnted, were made by calling in for that pur
pose outstanding 3 per cent, bonds of the Gov
ernment. During the six month prior to
June SO, 1S87, the surplus revenue had grown
o large hy repeated accumulations, and it
was feared the withdrawal of this great sum
:f money nettled by the people would so affect
the business of the country, that the sum of
?7J.S4.1(X) of such surplus was applied to the
payment of the principal and interest of the
.; pr cent, bonds still outstanding, and which
'.vri then payable at the option of the Gov
ernment. The precarious condition of finan
cial affairs among the people still needing
relief, immediately after the 'AOih day of
June. lS7. the remainder of the '6 per
cent, bonds then outstanding, amount
ing with principal and interest to
he sura cf 18,877,600, were called in and
ipplied to the sinking fund contribution for
rhe current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operations of the Treasury Department
representations of distress in business circles
not only continued but increased, and abso
lute p?ril seemed at hand. In these circum
stances the contributions to the sinking fund
for the current fiscal year was at once com
pleted by the expenditure of '37,G84,'J35.55 in
ibe purchase of Government bonds not yet
ue bearing 4 and 4..' per cent, interest, the
premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per
Cht. for the former and 8 per cent, for the
latter. In addition to this the interest accru
ing during the current year upon the out
standing bonded indebtedness of the Govern
ment was to some extent anticipated, and
banks selected as depositories of public money
were permitted to somewhat increase their
deposits.
While the expedients thus employed, to re
Imso to the people the money lying idle in the
Treasury, served to avert immediate danger,
ur surplus revenues have continued to accu
mulate, the excess for the present year
-unounting on the 1st day of "December to
o5.iVi,7ol.l, and estimated to reach the
sum of 113.000,000 on the 30th of June next,
t which date it is expected that this sum,
added to prior accumulations, will swell the
.surplus m the Treasury to $140,000,000.
l ne re seems m uoiioiwuimu.o man, "nu
such a withdrawal from use of the people's
circulating medium, our business community
may uot in the near future be subjected to
the same distress which was quite lately pro
duced from the same cuws?. And while the
functions of our National Treasury should be
few and simple, and while its best condition
would be reached, I believe, by its entire dis
connection with private business interests.
. w.r hv n ruif it:rM of its numoses. it
dlv holds money uselessly subtracted from
the
channels of trade, mere seems lu ue
reason lor the claim that some legitimate
means should b3 devised by the Government
to restore in an emergency, without waste or
extravagance, such money to its place among
the peop:e.
If such an emergency arises there now
exists no clear and undoubted executive
jower of lelief. Heretofore the redemption
f three per cent, bonds, which were payable
t the option of the Government, has afforded
a moans for the disbursement of the excess of
iiir revenues: but these bonds have all been
retired, and there are no bonds outstanding
the payment of which we have the right to
insist u'uon. The contribution to the sinking
fund which furnishes the occasion for expen
diture in the purchase of bonds has been al
ready made for the current year, so that
there is no outlet in that direction.
Tn the present state of legislation the only
pretense of any existing executive power to
restore, at this time, any part of our surplus
revenues to the i?ople by its expenditures,
ronsists in the supposition that the Secretary
of the Treasury may enter the market and
purchase the bonds of the Government not yet
due, at a rate of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such a
,Hwer could be derived is found in an appro
priation bill passed a number of years ago;
and it is subject to the suspicion that it was
intended as temporary and limited in its ap
plication, instead of conferring a continuing
discretion and authority. No condition ought
to exist which would justify the grant of
power to a single official, upon his judgment
of its necessity, to withhold from or release
to the businti of thepeople; in an unusual
-maimer, money held in the Treasury, and
"thus affect, at his will, the financial situation
of the country; and if it is deemed wise to
lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury the
authority in the present juncture to purchase
bonds, it should le plainly vested, and pro
vided as far as possible, with such checks and
limitations as will define this official's right
-and discretion, and at the same time relieve
him from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
txnds as a means of restoring to circulation
the surplus money accumulating in the
Treasury, it should le borne in mind that
premiums must of course be paid upon such
f-irchase, that there may be a large part 9t
these bonds held as in vestments which cannot
be purchased at any price, and that combina
tions among holders who are willing to sell,
may unreasonably enhance the cost of such
bonds to the Government.
It has been suggested that the present
bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate
of interest, and the difference between the
old and new securitv paid in cash, thus find
ing use for the surplus in the treasury. The
success of this plan, it is apparent, must de
pend upon the volition of the holders of the
present bonds; and it is not entirely certain
that the inducement which must be offered
them would result in more financial benefit
to the Government than the purcha-e of
bonds, while the latter projoition would
reduce the principal of tne debt by actual
payment, instead of extending it.
The proposition to dejosit the money held
by the Government banks throughout the
country, for use by the people, is, it seems to
me. exceedingly objectionable in principle, as
establishing too close a relationship between
the operations of the Government treasuiy
and the business of the country and too ex
tensive a commingling of their money, thus
fostering an unnatural reliance in private
business upon public funds. If this scheme
should be adopted it should only be done as a
temporary expedient to meet an urgent ne
cessity. "Legislative and executive effort
should generally be in the opposite direction
and should have a tendency to divorce, as
much and as fat as can safely be done, the
Treasury Department from private enter
prise. Of course it is not expected that unneces
sary and extravagant appropriations will be
made for the purpose of avoiding the accu
mulation of an eccessive revenue. Such ex
penditure, Inside the demoralization of all
just conceptions of public duty which it en
tails, stimulates a habit of reckless improvi
dence not in the least consistent with the
mission of our people or the high and benefi
cent purrioses of our Government.
I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to
the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as
to the attention of their representatives
charged with the responsibility of legislative
relief, the gravity of our financial situation.
The failure of the Congress heretofore to pro
vide against the dangers which it was quite
evident the very nature of the difficulty must
necess-arily produce, caused a condition of
tinancial distress and apprehension since your
last adjournment, which taxed to the utmost
all the authority and expedients within Ex
ecutive control: and these appear now to be
exhausted. If disaster results from the con
tinued inaction of Congress, the responsibility
must rest where it belongs.
Though the . situation thus far consid
ered is fraught with danger which should be
fully realized, and though it presents features
of wrong to the ieople as well as peril to the
country, it is a result growing out oi a per
fectly "palpable and apparent cause, con
stantly reproducing the same alarming cir
cumstances a congested national treasury
and a depleted monetary condition in the
business of the country. It need hardly be
stated that while the present situation de
mands a renredv, we can only be saved from
a like predicament in th? future by the re
moval of it3 cause.
Our scheme of tax ation, by means of which
this needless surplus is taken from the people
and put into the public treasury, consists of
a tariff or duty levied upon importations
from abroad, and internal revenue taxes
levied upon the consumption of tobacco and
spirituous and malt liquors. It must be con
ceded that none of these things subjected to
internal revenue taxation are, strickly speak
ing, necessaries; there appears to be no just
complaint of this taxation by the consumers
of those articles, and there seems to be noth
ing so well able to bear the burden without
hardship to any portion of the people.
But our present tariff laws, the vicious, in
equitable and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation, ought to be at once revised and
amended. These laws, as their primary and
plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all
articles imported and subject to duty, by pre
cisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the
amount of the duty measures the tax paid by
those who purchase for use these imported
articles. Many of these things, however, are
raised or manufactured in our own country,
and the duties now levied upon foreign goods
and products are called protection to these
fiomo manufactures, because they render it
possible for those of our people who are manu
facturers to make these taxed articles and sell
them for a price equal to that demanded for
imported goods that have paid customs duty.
So it happens that while comparatively a few
use the imported articles, millions of our
people, who never use and never saw any of
the foreign products, purchase and use things
of the same kind made in this country, and
pay therefore nearly or quite the same en
hanced prieo which the duty adds to the im
ported articles. Those who "buy imports pay
tho duty charged thereon in the public treas
ury, but the great majority of our citizens,
who buy domestic articles ol iuo sjhu
pay a sum at least approximately equal to
this dutv to tho home manufacturer. This
reference to the operation of our tariff laws
is not made by way of instruction, but in
order that wo may be constantly reminded of
the manner in which they impose a burden
upon those who consume domestic products as
well as those who consume imported articles,
and thus create a tax upon all our people.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve the
country of this taxation. It must be exten
sively continued as the source of the Govern
ment's income ; and in a readjustment of our
tariff the interests of American labor engaged
in manufacture should bo carefully consid
ered, as well as the preservation of our manu
facturers. It may be called protection, or hy
any other name, but relief from the hardships
and dangers of our present tariff laws should
be devised with especial precaution against im
periling the existence of our manufacturing
interests. But this existence should not mean
a condition which, without regard to the public
welfare or a national exigency, must always
insure the realization of immense profits in
stead of moderately profitable returns. As
the volume and diversity of our national
activities increase, new recruits are added to
taxes which they conceive the present system
those vho desire a continuation oi me twan-
..'Ffiii(mn HirootlV AUOrdS t hem. SO
Ui vaii"- iuAunvi ... . j
stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those ot
our fellow-citizens thus engaged, that they
(.an hardly complain of the suspicion, enter
tained to a certain extent, that there exists
an organized combination all along the line
to maintain their advantage.
We are in the midst of centennial celebra
tions, and with becoming pride we rejoice in
American skill and ingenuity, in American en
ergy and enterprise, and in the wonderful nat
ural advantages and resources developed by a
century's national growth. Yet when an at
tempt is made to justify a scheme which per
mits a tax to le laid upon every consumer m
the land for the benefit of our manufacturers,
quite beyond a reasonable demand for govern
mental regard, it suits the purposes ot advo
cacy to call our manufactures infant indus
tries, still needing the highest and greatest
degree of favor and fostering care that can be
wrung from Federal legislation.
It is alo said that the increase in the price
of domestic manufactures resulting from the
present tariff is neces?arv in order that higher
w ages nviy be paid to our workingmen em
ployed jn manufactories than are paid tor
what is f ailed the pauper labor of Europe. All
will acknowledge the force of an argument
which nvolves the welfare and liberal com
pensation of our laboring people. Our labor
is honorable in the eyes of every American
citizen; and as it lies at the foundation of our
development and progress, it is entitled, with
f out affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost
regard. The standard of our laborer Ufa
should not be measured by that of any other
countrv less favored, and they are entitled to
, thir full share of all our advantages.
By the last census it is made to appear
that of the lT.rXtt.U'.'J of our population en
gaged in all kinds of industries 7,J70,4:3 are
. employed in agriculture. 4, '74,8 in profes
sional and personal service, (-J.'.c.nTo of
whom are domestic servants and laborers.)
while 1,10,-V; are employed in trade and
transportation, and :J, 87,1 12 are classed as
emp'.ovtd in manufacturing and mining.
For' present purposes, however, the last
number civen should be considerably re
duced. Without attempting to enumerate
all, it will be conceded that there should be
deducted from thoe which it includes '775.14-3
i caryK?nters and joiners, 'Ji,401 milliners,
drcsrmakers, and seamstresses. 1?2,7 black
smiths. 1:,7.V tailors and tailoresses, 102, 4 7:
masons, 76,241 bntchers, 41.30 bakers. 22,s:;
plasterers, and 4.8J1 engaged in manufactur
ing asricultural implements, amounting in
the aggregate to 1.214.2:;, leaving JJVJ.SJ
persons employed in such manufacturing in
dustries as are claimed to be l.enefited by a
high tariff.
To these the appeal is made to save their
emplovment and maintain their wages by re
sisting a change. There should be no dispo
; sition to answer such suggestions by the
' allegation that they are in a minority among
those who labor, and therefore should forego
an advantage, in th interest of low prices
for the majority: their compensation, as it
may be affected by the operation of the tariff
laws, should at alf times be scrupulously kept
, in view; and yet with slight reflection they
will not overlook the fact that they are con
sumers with the rest: that they, too, have
their own wants and thos? of their families
to supply from their earnings, and that the
; price of the necessaries of life, as well as the
amount of their wages, will regulate the meas
ure of their welfare and comfort.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should ba so measured as not to necessitate or
justify either the loss of employment by the
working man nor the lessening of his wages:
and the profits still remaining to the manu
facturer, after a necessary readjustment.
- should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of
j the interests of his employes either in their
! opportunity to work or in the di
1 munition of their compensation. Nor
can the worker in manufactures fail
! to understand that while a high
j tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the
i payment of remunerative wages, it certaiuly
! results in a very large increase in the price of
i nearly all sorts of manufactures, which, in
I almost countless forms, he needs for the use
! of himself and his family. He receives at
the desk of his employer his wages, and per
j haps before he reaches his home is obliged,
i in a purchase for family use of an article
' which embraces his own labor, to return in
i the payment of the increase in price which
! the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensa
tion of many days of toil.
The farmer and the agriculturist, who
I manufacture nothing, but who pay the in
creased price which the tariff imposes upon
every agricultural implement, upon all he
wears and upon all he uses and owns.except the
increase of his flocks and herds and such
things as his husbandry; produces from the
! soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the
.resent situation: and he is told that a
high duty on imported wool is necessary tor
i the benefit of those who have sheep to shear,
' in order that the price of their wool may
I be increased. They, of course, are not
: reminded that the farmer who has no sheep
I in by this scheme obliged, in his purchase of
clothing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute
to his tellow farmer as well as to the manu
I facturer and merchant; nor is any mention
1 made of the fact that the sheep-owners them
! selves and their households, must wear cloth
i ing and use other articles manufactured from
i the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as
i consumers must return their share of this in
: creased price to the tradesman
i T rhinV it. mav lie fairlv assumed that a
large proportion of the sheep owned by the
farmers throughout the country- are round
in small flocks numbering from twenty-five
to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported
wool which these sheep yield is 10 cents
each pound if of the value of 30 cents or less,
and 12 cents if of the value of more than o0
cents. If the liberal estimate of six
rvMmria K nllowpd for each fleece the
duty thereon would be
and this may be taken
atilianpomanf nf ita nrifrt
CO or 72 cents,
as the utmost
to the farmer by
reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars wouiu
thus represent the increased price of the wool
from twenty-five sheep and thirty-six dollars
that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at
present values this addition would amount to
about one-third of its price. If upon its sale
the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit,
the wcol leaves his hands charged w ith pre
cisely that sum, which in all its changes will
adhere to it, until it reaches the consumer.
When manufactured into cloth and other
goods and material for use, its cost is not
only increased to the extent of tho farmer s
tariff profit, but a further sum has been
added for the benefit of the manufacturer
under the operation of other tariff laws.
In the meantime the day arrives when
the farmer finds it necessary to purchase
woolen goods and material to clotho him
self and family for tho winter. When fie
faces the tradesman for that purpose he
discovers that he is obliged not only to
return in the w ay of increased price his tariff
profit on the wool he sold, and which then
perhaps lies before him in manufactured form,
but that he must add a considerable sum
thereto to meet a further increase in cost
caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture.
Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that
be has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a
result of the tariff scheme, which, when he
sold his wool seemed so profi table, an increase
in price more than sufficient to sweep away
all the tariff profit he received upon the wool
he produced and scld.
When the numbers of farmers engaged in
wool raising is compared with all the farmers
in the country, and the small proportion they
bear to our population is considered: when it
is made apparent that in the case of a large
part of those who own sheep the benefit of. the
present tariff on wool is illusory,and above all.
I the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes
whph it. must i L-uiituneii iiiau uhicojc ui
a hnrden upon inose witu iuuueiaie means
I and the poor, the employed and unemployed.
; the sick and well, and the young and old. and
: that it constitutes a tax which with relentless
i grasp fastens ujon the clothing of every
1 man, woman, and child in the land, reasons
, are suggested why the removal or reduction
of this duty should be included in a revision
; of our tariff laws.
In speaking of the incread cost to the con
! sumer of our home manufactures, resulting
i from a duty laid upon imported articles of the
' same description, the fact is not overlooked
that competition among our domestic prr--:
ducers sometimes lias the effect of keeping the
I price of their products below the highest limit
! allow ed by such duty. But it is notorious that
I this coiup?titiou is too often strangled by
combinations quite prevalent at this time,
and frequently called trusts, which have for
: their object the regulation of the supply and
price of commodities made and sold by m?m
i nLrL nf th rombination. The people can
hardly hope for any consideration in the
operation of these selfish schemes.
If, however, in the absence of such combi
nation, a health v and free competition re
duces the price of any particular dutiable
article of home production below the limit
which it might otherwise reach under our
tariff laws, and if, with such reduced price,
its manufacture continues to thrive, it is en
tirelv evident that one thing has been discov
ered'which should be carefully scrutinized in
an effort to reduce taxation.
Th necessity of combination to maintain
the price of any commodity to the tariff
point, furnishes proof that some one is willing
to accept lower prices for such commodity,
and that such prices are remunerative; and
lower prices produced by competition prove
the same thing. Thus where cither of these
conditions exist, a case would sem to be pre
sented for an eay reduction of taxation.
The considerations which have been pre
sented touching our tariff laws are intended
only to enforce an earnest recommendation
that the surplus revenues of the Government
be prevented by the reduction of our customs
duties, and, at thesame time, to emphasize a
suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose,
wo may discharge a double duty to our people
by granting to them a measure of relief from
tariff taxation in quarters where it is most
needed and from sources where it can be
mot fairly and justly aocopled.
Nor can the presentation made cf such con
siderations be, with any degree of fairness,
regarded as evidence of unfriendliness
toward our manufacturing interests, or of any
lack of appreciation of their value and im
Iortance. These interests constitute a leading and
most substantial element of our national
greatness and furnish the proud proof of our
countrv's progress. But if in the emergency
that presses uion us our manufacturers are
asked to surrender something for the public
good and to avert disaster, their v-atriotism. as
well as a grateful recognition of advantages
already afforded, should lead them t twilling
co-operation. No demand is made that they
shall forego all the benefits of governmental
regard: but they cannot fail to le admonished
of their duty, as well as their enlightened self
interest and safety, when they are reminded of
the fact that financial panic and collapse, to
which the present condition tends, afford no
greater shelter or protection to our manufac
tures than to our other inqortant enterprises.
Opportunity tor safe, careful and doliberate
reform is now offered; and none of us should
Ik? unmindful of a time when an abused and
irritated people, heedless of those who have
resisted timely and reasonable relief, may in
sist upon a radical and sweeping rectification
of their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a, wise and fair re
vision of our tariff laws is not underesti
mated. It will require 01? the part of the
Congress great labor and care, and especially
a broad and national contemplation of the
subject, and a patriotic disregard of such
local and selfish claims as are unreasonable
and reckless of the welfare of the entire
country.
Under our present laws more than 4,0.0 ar
ticles are subject to duty. Many of these do
not in any way compete with our own manu
factures, and many are hardly worth atten
tion as subjects of revenue. A considerable
reduction can be made in the aggregate, by
adding them to the free list. The taxation
of luxuries presents no features of hardship;
but the necessities of life used and consumed
by all the people, the duty upon which adds
to the cost of living in every home, should be
greatly cheapened. ... ,
The radical reduction of the duties imposed
upon raw material used in manufactures, or
its free importation, is of course an important
factor in any effort to reduce the price of these
necessaries; it would not only relieve them
from the increased cost caused by the tariff on
such material, but the manufactured product
being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff
now laid upon such product, as a condensa
tion to our manufactures for the present price
of raw material,could be accordingly modified.
Such reduction, or free importation, would
serve beside to largely reduce the revenue. It
is not apparent how such a change can have
any injurious effect upon our manufacturers.
On the contrary, it would appear to give
them a better chance in foreign markets with
the manufacturers of other countries, who
cheapen their wares by free material. Thus
our people might have the opportunity of ex
tending their sales beyond the limits of home
consumptiou saving them from the de
pression, interruption in business, and loss
caused by a glutted domestic market, and af
fording their employes more -ertain and
steady labor, with its resulting quiet and con
tentment.
The question thus imperatively presented
for solution should be approached in a spirit
higher than partisanship and considered in
the light of that regard for patriotic duty
which should characterize the action of those
intrusted with the weal of a confiding people.
But the obligation to declared party policy
and principle is not wanting to urge prompt
and effective action. Both of the great political
Earties now represented in the Government
ave, by repeated and authoritative declara
tions, condemned the condition of our laws
which permit the collection from the people
of unnecessary revenue, and have in the
mosusolemn manner promised its correction;
and neither as citizens nor partisans are our
countrymen in a mood to condone the delib
erate violation of these pledges.
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be improved by dwelling iqon the theo
ries of protec tion and free trade. This savors
too much of bandying epithets. It is a con
dition which confronts us not a theory.
Relief from this condition ma3- involve
a slight reduction of the advantages
which we award our home productions,
but the entire withdrawal of such
advantages should not be contemplated. The
question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant;
and the persistent claim made in certain quar
ters that all efforts to relieve the people from
unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes
of so-called free traders, is mischievous and
far removed from any consideration for the
public good.
TV.. cimn.n-iml nlttin lllltV which We OWe the
people is to reduce taxation to the necessary
expenses of an economical operation of the
Government, and to restore to the business of
the countrv the money which we hold in the
treasury through the perversion of govern
mental powers. These things can and should
be done with safety to ail our industries, with
out danger to the opportunity for remunera
tive labor which our workingmen need, and
with benefit to them and all our people, by
cheapening their means of subsistence and
increasing the measure of their comforts-.
The Constitution provides that the Presi
dent "shall, from time to time, give to the
Congress information of the state of the
Union.'' It has b-en tho custom of the Ex
ecutive, in compliance with this provision, to
annually exhibit to the Congress, at the
opening of its session, the general con
dition of the country, and to detail, with
some particularity, the o orations of the
different executive departments. It wouid
be especially agreeable to follow this course
at the present time, and to call atten
tion to the valuable accomplishments of
these departments during tho last fiscal
year. But I am so much impressM
with the paramount importance of the
subject to which this communica
tion has thus Ur leen dpvoted, that I shall
forego the addition of any other topic, and
only urge upon your immediate considera
tion the -'state of the Union"' a shown in tho
present condition of our treasury and our
general fiscal situation, upon which evry
element of our safety and prosj-erity de
pends. The reports of the heads of departments,
which will I e submitted, contain mil and ex
plicit information touching the transaction of

Of the free delivery system th report says
that ''there should U no hesitation in pro

States with this service, whose busi

are such as to make it of an advantage
comjxMisatory to its cost. The special
delivery system has not commanded any in

an average ; of $10. 'Js for delivering letters
within twenty-one minutes, on the average,
after they were received.
One subsidy is recommended, the payment
of fci,000 or 14,000 a month for a monthly

Annual Report of tlic; ComtiiU-
Tin
sioiier of Agriculture.
The Commissioner of Agriculture, in his
annual report, recommends substantially the
aUUition of the seed division of tho depart
ment, and the transfer of its duties to the
State and Territorial experiment station.
The directors of these institution, ho says,
ought to know what kind of seed tho
farmers of their resistive neighborhoods
are interested in. and what kinds are !est
adapted to each locality. "If," he says, ' thU
work of testing and distributing seed could
1h? done bv the stations, and the department
be relieved of this duty, it would enable it to
work in other directions of great important
to the agricultural interests of the country."
The Commissioner discusses the hcojo and
functions of the dejartmenti in a way which
leaves room for the plain inference that U"
disapproves the efforts to make it an execu
tive department, with a memter of
the Cabinet at its head. The de
partment's position, he. thinks, should l
that of an adviser in tho. investiga
tions and enterprises which bear
upon the agricultural interests of the coun
try. 4'In the leginning,v he say, "the de
partment may have l-en an experiment, but
its condition now should leuve no doubt a to
the precise relation which tho department
should hold to the Government. The de-
e'opment ha lieen natural, and there may
be a valuable lesson in tho history of it ev
lution.1"
The Commissioner says it is yet too early to
make an official statement of the result ia
detail of the present year s exi4?riinenU in th
development of sorghum sugar manufacture;
'but," ho aIds, "enough is known already to
enable this country to anticipate at an early
day the production of a suar supply from a
plant as easy of cultivation as com, but little
circumscribed by climatic influence, and one
whose by products havo a value equal to the
cost of raising."
On the subject of our wheat Kurplu he
says: "The comparative prominence of tbia
country in it wheat suqIus nny not 1h
popularly realized. Whil our export
nave exceeded J W bushel p?r
annum for ten year. thoyj of Kusia
were alout ;,(XM.o0 bu-hei and
those of India 24.k , bishd in round
numU-rs, for the last decade.. Oth?r lands
contribute onlv a very small surpi us Aus
tralia, Chili, .the Argentine Republic, and
other, only a few million each an 1 th
combined surphi of all nation does not
equal that of this country."
The report treat of the work of the Uureau
of Animal Industry in preventing the spread
of pleuro-pneumonia from infected counties,
and says that there has not been time "
years when this malady has been confined to
i such restricted areas as at present. If the State,
their cooperation and
Congres makes an appropriation equal to
that of the present year, the Commissioner
believe that this dangerous disease can bm
exterminated by the end of the next LUc&L,
year.
