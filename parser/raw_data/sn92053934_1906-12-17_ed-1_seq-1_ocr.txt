Another Message Asks Enact
ment of Naval Person
nel Bill.
Washington, Dec. 17. In a message
to congress today the president urges
the repeal of the timber and stone act,
demands the radical. amendment of the
desert land act. and urges the repeal of
the commutation clause of the home
stead act, all of which he declares now
serve to turn great tracts of land over
to speculators and corporations.
Mail Comply With I.nw.
To prevent fraudulent acquisition of
public lands, the president says he di
rected the secretary of the interior to
allow no patent to be issued to public
lands under any law until by an exam
ination on the ground, actual compli
ance with that law has been found to
exist. For this the general land office
is urgently required.
Heati-let Mineral ltIKhM.
The president believes that there
should be provision for keeping coal,
oil and gas rights under proper restric
tions. He urges a revision and reeif
actment of existing laws affecting
rights of way and privileges on public
lands and reservations in one compre
hensive act, providing that regulation?
now in force in many cases may be ex
tended to all.
'onolIlate Korf( nrarrrni.
Legislation is recommended in line
with the proposal to allow the railroads j
to consolidate their holdings of timber
within forest reserves by exchange,
after deeding their lands to the govern
ment. The president recommends that
the secretary of the treasury be au
thorized to advance to the forest serv
ice, upon security of standing timber
an amount, say $5,000,000, sufficient to
provide for a reasonable working cap
ital, for national forests, to bear in
terest and to be repaid in annual in
stallments beginning in 10 years.
Would Tmnxfcr Parka.
The transfer of the national parks
from charge of the secretary of the In
terior to the secretary of agriculture is
recommended. Power to create na
tional forests by proclamation should
be extended to Indian lands, Indians to
be paid full value for land thus taken.
The president recommends legisla
tion which will provide for government
control of the public ranges through
the department of agriculture, to in
sure to each locality rules for grazing
specially adapted to its needs and to
authorize the collection of a reasonable
grazing fee. He says he will see to it
that illegal fences are removed unless
congress takes steps to legalize proper
fencing by government control of the
range.
Change ia Naval rrrmnnrl.
Washington, Dec. 17. The president
sent a message to congress today ear
nestly recommending the early consid
eration of the naval personnel bill, say
ing that, should it be enacted into law
it will cause officers on the seagoing
list to reach the grade of captain at
48 and rear admirals at 55, and will
assure their serving seven years in the
grade of captain and seven years In the
grade of rear admiral, thus enabling
them to become thoroughly skilled and
efficient in these grades.
Ktablihra Vice Admiral.
The bill also establishes the grade
f vice admiral. On occasions of offi
cial importance of international coun
cil, or of combined naval action, the
interests of this great nation demand
that our naval representatives shall
rank as the equal of naval represent
atives of other powers. The president
says that, if the proposed plan of pro
motion is carried out it will ,as com
pared with the existing law, make a
saving of more than $5,000,000 during
the next seven years.
Mop Rrlirtmnl.
The principal part of this saving is
made by stopping the involuntary re
tirement of young lieutenant command
ers with the rank and pay of command
ers upon the retired list. The president
is firmly of the opinion that unless the
present system is rectified by judicious
legislation, the future of our navy will
be greatly compromised.

Washington, D. C, Dec. 17. Repre

sociation had an informal hearing Sat
urday before the interstate commerce
commission in regard to the ruling
which the commission has made de
claring, in effect, that under the
amended interstate commerce law rail
roads cannot enter into contracts with
newspapers for advertising and give
in return therefor railroad transporta
tion. To the remarks of one of the
members that the railroads preferred
the old method, Chairman Knapp de
clared that on the other hand promi
nent railroad men had applauded and
commended the action of the commis
sion. The chairman declared that the com
prehensively, explicitly and unqualified
ly prohibited transportation by rail
roads of persons or property except in
accordance with the precise terms of
the tariffs filed for that purpose, and
that every tariff provided for the pay
ment of services rendered in money.
Paul, Dec. 17. A special to the
Dispatch from Grand Forks, X. D.,
says: The fuel situation today pre
sents the most critical condition that
has existed in the history of the state.
Careful inquiry in every portion of the
northern half of the state shows there
is not a town in which coal can be had
except in small quantities and to sup
ply immediate needs in dozens of
places' there is not a pound to be
bought, dealers having been out of
fuel for days and in some cases for a
week or more.
Sold in Qunrtrr Ton I.otx.
At Larimer, one carload of coal re
ceived Saturday was sold out in quar
ter ton lots. The electric light plant
is running on half time.
At Lanton no bituminous coal nor
lignite has been received for weeks.
There is plenty of lignite at Bismarck,
but it cannot be gotten here. At La
kota dealers are out and individuals
are sharing with their neighbors.
These illustrations could be multi
plied indefinitely, and the same con
ditions prevail in the southern half of
the state and in northern Minnesota.
Snow 1 Frnroil.
One of the most serious features is
the possibility of a snow blockade.
There Is now more snow on the ground
than at any time since 1S9G. Thus far
the state has escaped, high winds and
bad drifts, but a storm such as is us
ual at any time in winter would pile
up immense drifts and tie up roads
completely for many days and crippla
them for the entire winter.
Suyu Public W aa Warned.
Washington, Dec. 17. In response to
telegrams of inquiry addressed to pres
idents of several western railroads by
the interstate commerce commission
as to the causes of the reported short
age of cars for the transportation of
fuel, by reason of which great suffer
ing has been entailed. President How
ard Elliott . of the Northern Pacific
Railway company telegraphs the com
mission from St. Paul as follows:
"There is a scarcity of fuel in some
parts of the country served by our line,
but we do not know of any shortage of
other necessaries of life. Our corn-
Washington, D. C, Dec. 17. Foreign
contractors are to be barred from com
petition for the completion of the Pan
ama canal. Chairman Shonts of the
canal commission makes this announce
ment. .Many changes have been agreed
to in the form of a contract to be en
tered into for the construction of the
canal, but the most important is the
limiting of the proposals to American
firms. In case none of the bids are
satisfactory, the commission will eith
er throw the competition open to for
eign bidders or proceed with the work
without contract.
Huiul Are l.ltcht.
A substantial reduction in the bond
of the successful bidder was also made
by the commission, in compliance with
the request of prospective bidders
The bonds will be only $2,000,000, and
the total liability of the contractor is
to be limited, less the percentage and
premiums otherwise payable to the
contractor, and $3,000,000 in addition.
pany has done and will continue to do
all it can to prevent suffering. The
company realized in July the supply
was likely to be inadequate and that
the great increase in general business
would probably produce congestion in
the autumn. We therefore urged all
dealers at that time to look ahead and
provide a stock of coal eauiy and try
to find new sources of supply.
Xot KiiotiRh I'rolu-el.
"I think the reason given in your
message, namely, extraordinary delays
in moving, is incorrect so far as this
company is concerned. The difficulty
in Montana, Idaho and Washington is
that not enough coal is produced to
supply promptly the increased domes
tic trade and at the same time furnish
railroads with fuel for the operation of
their trains."
Elliott says floods and blizzards have
contributed to delay in moving cars
and freight.

Washington, Dec. 17. In a special
message to congress today on his visit
to the canal zone President Roosevelt
takes occasion to use the big stick on
those who have seen fit to publicly
criticise the canal management in the
yarious phases of the work. In the
course of his comments he says:
"An inspection on the ground at the
height of the rainy season served to
convince me of the wisdom of con
gress in refusing to adopt either a high
level or a sea-level canal. There
seems to be a universal agreement
among all people competent to judge
that the Panama route, the one actual
ly chosen, is much superior to both the
Nicaragua and Darien routes.
"The wisdom of the canal manage
ment haft been shown in nothing more
clearly than in the way in which the
foundations of the work have been
laid. To have yielded to the natural
Impatience of ill informed outsiders
and begun all kinds of experiments in
work prior to a thorough sanitation of
the isthmus, and to a fairly satisfac
tory working out of the problem of get
Ing and keeping a sufficient labor sup
ply, would have been disastrous. The
various preliminary measures had to
be taken first; and these could not be
taken so as to allow us to begin the
real work on construction prior to Jan.
1 of the present year. It then became
necessary to have the type of the canal
decided, and the only delay has been
the necessary delay until the 29th day
of June, the date when the congress
definitely and wisely settled that "we
should have an 85-foot level canal. Im
mediately after that the work began in
hard earnest and has been continued
with Increasing vigor ever since; and
it will continue so to progress in the
future. When the contracts are let the
conditions will be such as to insure a
constantly
formance.
"Just at present the health showing
on the isthmus is remarkably good so
much better than in most sections of
the United States that I do not believe
that it can possibly continue at quite
its present stage. Thifs. early in the
present year a band of several hundred
Spaniards were brought to the isthmus
as laborers, and additions to their
number have been made from time to
time; yet since their arrival in Feb
ruary last but one of those Spaniards
thus brought over to work on the canal
has died of disease, and he of typhoid
fever.
r
"It is Impossible to avoid some mis
takes in building a giant canal through
Jungle covered mountains and swamps,
while at the same time sanitating trop
ic cities, and providing for the feeding
and general care of from twenty to
thirty thousand workers. The com
plaints brought to me, either of suffi
cient provision in caring for some of
the laborers, or of failure to finish the
pavements of Colon, or of failure to
supply water, or of failure to build
wooden sidewalks for the use of the
laborers in the rainy season, on invest
igation proved, almost without excep
tion, to be due merely to the utter in
ability of the commission to do every-,
thing at once.
"It is not only natural, but Inevit
able, that a work as gigantic as this
which has been undertaken on the
isthmus should arouse every species of
hostility and criticism. The conditions
are so new and so trying, and the work
so vast, that it wonld be absolutely out
of the question that mistakes should
not be made. Checks will occur. Un-
forseen difficulties will arise. From
time to time seemingly well settled
plans will have to be changed. At
present 25.000 men are engaged on the
task. After a while the number will
be doubled. In such a multitude it is
inevitable that there should be here
and there a scoundrel. Very many of
the poorer class of laborers lack the
mental development to protect them
selves against either the rascality of
others or their 'own folly, and it is not
possible for human wisdom to devise
a plan by which they can invariably
be protected. In a place which has
been for ages a byword for unhealth
fulness, and with so large a congrega
tion of strangers suddenly put down
and set to hard work there will now
and then be outbreaks of disease.
There will now and then be shortcom
ings in administration; there will be
unlooked for accidents to delay the ex
cavation of the cut or the building of
the dams and locks. Each such inci
dent will be entirely natural, and, even
tho serious, no one of them will mean
more than a little extra delay or trou
ble. Yet each, when discovered by
sensation mongers and retailed to tim
id folk of little faith, will serve as an
excuse for the belief that the whole
task is being badly managed.. Experi
ments will continually be tried in hous
ing, in hygiene, in street repairing, in
dredging, and in digging earth antr
rock. Now and then an experment
will be a failure; and among those
who hear of it, a certain proportion
of doubting Thomases will at once be
lieve that the whole work is a failure.
"Doubtless here and there some minor j
rascality will be uncovered; but as to
this. I have to say that after the most
painstaking inquiry I have been unable

Chicago, Dec. 17. Chicago's street

immediate and complete rehabilitation
of the service, with th city as a part

ownership. All lines will be operated
as one system with through service to
all parts of the city for 5 cents.
The value of the existing street car
properties ,and unexpired franchises
was fixed at $50,000,000, which amount
the city, whenever it undertakes mu
nlcipal ownership, must pay the com
panles in addition to what is expended
for rehabilitation. Of this amount the
Union Traction coirpany will receive
$29,000,000 and the City railway $21.-

demanded $74,000,000 for their present
properties.
