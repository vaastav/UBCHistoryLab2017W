-?JASON COUNTr?OIL.
W??inviio attention to the article ta
?kon from ilio New York Times, giving
(in account of the miners! ri sources cf
tho Great Kanawha Vallny. There is
no doubt ol the richness of this entire
region in minerals, and its agricultural
resources are abundantly capable for the
support of a population adequate to the
developmrnt of these varied an I inex
lmustnb'e hidden tr asures. Probably
?no.portion of our entire country of equal
area, possesses superior advantages fi.r
easy access, for facilities lor transporta
tion, for diversified productions and fur
salubrity of climate, to litis Great Kana
wha -Valley, and we aro gratified to fir.d
it is beginning to attract tho attent on
due its unrivalled capabilities.
In our brief no ice in our last issuo of
the Coal an 1 Silt productions of U ? sou
rounty, wc omitted in mention I lie item
of petroleum, nnJ, therefore,in this con
n xion, sta'e, that oil has been demons
tratcd to exist in very nutty loeali ies in
tbisoouuty, indeed all our salt inanufao
turcrs, and espucially those of Hartford
City, have al'.vays experienced great dif
fcully in consequence of its pt osonca in
their salt wells?many barrels of oil be
ing drawn from their cisterns of salt wa
ter, after sufficient time bad be>n allow
ed for the oil to partially separate and
Ti*e to the surface.
Time permits us only to mention in
this article, that rainy of our citizens
ore "boring for oil" in varions parts of
our county and with the most gratifying
results. We are confident that when
fully tested,Mason county will bo found
to equal any county in West Virginia ia
-its yield of Petroleum.

Permit mo lo insuro ihoao of your
readers who tako Ihe slightest interest
in llio (icvelofimeiit of tho natural re
tourers of our great and common conn
ii y, whether for honor or for prolit, thai
the little Stetc dI West Virginia is now
offering hureelf as ihe richest prize of
nil in the present yranil schemes of oil
venture. If California is first, Weal
Virginis mu>t lia second; tint Cn]ifi>rnia
is not first, either in the vaiiety or >-xtoiit
or value of her mineral i!epoai:a. 1 lins
?ril nothing in the prophecy, thst West
Virginia i< destined, and ilmt soon, to
absorb the attention and capital of our
Imding citizens, lo n grenter extent than
the same amount of territory in sny otli
er pur', uol only of this continent, but
of the known worlil. It is no lunger a
question of probability ?? to the vust
ness r.f her possessions, nor as to tha
certainly Hint her future will be grnnd
?nd important, but simply, who are the
men among us all that nr? to immortal
ize tluiir numes and enrioh posterity, by
I e<oinini? tbo pioneers in this great lield
of cnterprinu?
A sojourn hero in (he Kanawha Vul
lev during the past eight work*, in con
nrction with a former visit, lias nnde
me familiar with lier inexhaustible min
eral wealth, and as they now oocur to
me, I chrotiiole herein a few of the lead
ing features of this part of tho country
for tho bancSt of "rrliom il may con
cern," be it the State itself, its citizens
or your readers, who have now become
60 numerous as lo constitute "tho woild
iu general." An air lino drawn from
New York to tliia plaic would probsbly
measure le>s than six hundred miles,
consuming only n day end a half of mil
road travel; but the present tnoile of
reaching h.-ru is far mote circuitous, the
iiMtil routes, smon! the several wnich
may bo taken, hefrii? vin lialtiiuoro and
Ohio Railroad to I'arliersburp; or the
Pennsi Ivania Central to Pittsburg and
Wheeling, ittitl tlitnoe from either place
by steamboat down the Ohio Kivor to
this point. But let tho traveller come
by what route bo will, as soon as -his
destination is known, the common ob
solvation mndo lo him is. "Are yon in
scaieh of colli or oil?" The fact is (Jinf
petroleum has been discovered in more
than fivo hundred places throughout the
State alone lite range this fide of the Al
leghany Mountains and its spurs ho
tween tho colebrated oil wells in Penn
sylvania and those of Cumberland in
Kentucky. Your readers will remember
that attention had only just been called
to tho great value and utility of rock oil
when Ihe war broke out, and it ha3 been
ascertained that arrangements woio be
ing made at that tima for tho epeedy
borin?f of more than a thousand tvulls in
different localities, but tho old Statu of
Virginia went hand in hand with her
"wayward tiaters"into secant in, and the
proprietors of these old land?, knitting
their fortunes lo those of the mother
State, gave a "ticket of 'eave" to their
then Northern associates, and tho drill
and tho pump were generally abandoned
for the sabre and Ihe rifle. The rebel
lion is riot yet entirely crushed, it is true,
fur like n ontit stems to have several
lives; but it is pretty universally conce
ded to be "ployed out" as to this State,
and to I.e going to satan generally.?
Such is the security left at any rate, that
tli: ro is beginning to be a stir; the wells
on Little Knnawha aro being unplugged,
and boring has commenced to a consid
arable degree in this valley and other
comparatively new fields with the most
promising symptoms that "dad toiVfstrike
ilo" in this grand basin.
Very many New Yorkers think their
salt works at Syracuse sti immense
thing, and so they ara until one begins
lo nuke comparisons, for, contrasted
with those above Charleston in tliisval
by, they would rai.k as littla aiit-hi|l?
by the side of great mountains. One
sees, at least, seventy five "live'' der
ricks in the short space of three miles,
pumjiine up the saline deposit by the
bvcketfu'. and, ir.-Jacd, -?.o abiudnnl it. it
llw> the nous u#? in operation are
paying "dead rentas they call it, on
perhaps n hundred neighboring salt
wc'la, i. e., so much per year lo keep
them plugged up and thereby enable the
others to "bull" Ihe piice of sail. Thus
one marks the difference between Syra
cuse arid Kanswha?ihe former being
constantly drained to hor utmost capac
ity, while the latter Is losing but a mero
drop from her great ocean of tal /uac
Tho deposit of bitutnous, splint and
crbcsI coul ir. this port of the Stale is
also truly astonishing. All the high
hills are full of it, some of them contain
ing half a doscn S3a;:ii retrying fromfoar
to us high aa fifteen f> o' in thickness.?
As wc go up tho great Kanawha River,
the first liuli mountain range which
"strikes the beholder" is that bordering
on the Pocatnlico River. It is under
atond that this property, cons'gtinjj of
between three nnd four thousand aires,
has teconily been purchased bv Mr. II.

KANAWHA.
Petroleum.
Wo ?re not surprised at tha interest,
which seems aiill on the increase, now
felt in the positive indications of the ex
tstonoe of Petroleum in the Kannwlm,
valley. Several companies have nlrea
'7 been ill work on iho Kanawha and !
us tributaries, Elk, Poca, Coal, e^c., in
leasing up all the country which gave
"surface" indirutiotn of oil. One com
pany, ed the ink River Oil Association,
is already ut work boring?on Elk River
?having three wells in progress, which
Jliey expect io have sunk by Christmas.
I lie^re arc other companies which aie
leasing up the land on speculation; which
should be discouraged. We ought and
want to know as soon as may be wheth
er oil really exists hero in quantities to
pny. It coilainly does exist in very
many pi, ces, and every indication fa
vors the belief that the Great Kanawha
and tributaries will bee mo as noted for
I elroleum as are the waters of the Lit
ile Katuwhs.
But capitalists who wish to work can
not be disappointed in coming here. If
tney dou't BUceeed in oil?though thoy
have as favorable a chance for that here
ns anywhere c-lse where wells have dot
actually been sunk?they are sure of'
coal, iron anil suit. There 1*3 no longer j
any danger about here from guerrillas,
for our scouts are keeping the oouhtry I
clear. Certainly there is no place which I
so much needs, which will so richly re
pay the investment of capital as" tlic
Kanawha Volley. There nro many lea i
ses lor oil yet to be obtained on favora
ble terms by those meaning work, and
many who are anx'ous to sub lease to
men having inpital to sink wells. We
know there is oil here, and though we
are not geologists, we know of one who
is, thai is working with unabatingae.il in
in trotting all the leases he can.-- Wet!

W. W. II,
The Vietoi'y in Tennessee,
Na?iivii.ik, Dec. 1.?I am now able
to give you a more correct account of
the battle at Franklin, than that which
1 forwarded this morning, f should be
! glad if I could send you a map ol th"
situation at Franklin, so that you might
better understand the operations The
1 plan of ba't'e was very simple indue 1.?
We had no time to gut up a complete
plat), as the enemy pressed us too s^re
ly, anoHi.geil us to light olf hand, as I
have already stated. Our plan otigin
ally was to with-lraw the force of lien.
Sohofield until meeting our re-enforce
monts, we should give battle in the vi
cinity of Nashville. Dut the 1 ver san
guine rebels pressed us ton i.ard, and
when fies.Schofield perceived lie could
not well avoid a contest, he drew up l is
little army in lino of battle in front of
Franklin, and prepire.1 for the enemy's
onset. South Iiarpelh river, rattling
northwestwardly, makes a bend to the
north In the neighborhood ol Frauklin.
and within this bend the town is si'ua
ted. Acroes the neck of the l'triiusula
formed by the bed of the r vert our lino
ofba'.lle was formed, cousistinz of four
divisions only. Cox's and Ruber's of
the twenty third corps, and Kimball's
ami Wagner's of th.e fourth corps.?
Kimball was on the right of the fne,
Cos in the center and Rugor on the left,
Wagner's had nothing of any coi.so
quence to protect them, hut. the other
three divisions had a tolerably good line
of earthworks behind whioh to light.?
The rebels begun press ng us (is early as
two o'clock.
By three wo wore in position behind
out-works, and at half past three the its
sault commenced When the enemy
first advanced to attack, he had Che.v
tham's corps on the ri^'bt and Stewart's
on the left S D. L'f's corps was held
as a reserve on the center, ready to as
sist Cheatham or S'.ewart, is occasion
might require. It was half past thr.e.
as 1 have said, when Cheatham threw
his corps upon Wngner with great itn
petuosity. Wagner's xen fought dos
perately for half an hour, until the stipe
rior numbers of the enemy compelled
them to fall back in some haste to a seo
ond line. Halting behind this line, they
bocame to some extent mingled with
Cox's and Ruger's men on our loft and
center; but this did not prerenl them
from fighting witlf obstinate and distin
guished bravery until the end of the
battle. The rebels, encouraged by
seeming success in driving Wagner
back, advanced with ardor and loud
cheers to the assault on the soeond line.
The order in which they advanced to
the assault was very peculiar. A semi
circle, two regiments in depth, exteuded
hi! aiouud out iine, end buhitia each ai
ternate regiment wero placeii four others,
so that the assaulting columns were re
ally six regiments deep. Hood himself
appeared, about-1 P. AI., at the beads
of bis columns. Pointing toward our
lines, he said, "Creak those lines, boys,
and you have finished the war in Ten
nessee?break them, and thore is nothing
to oppose your march from Nashville to
the Ohio river." Loud cheers answered
the rtbel leader, an.I immediately the
whole space in front of our lines was
crammed with the advancing multitudes.
Capt. Lyman, commanding the artillery
brigade of the 4th Corps, had placed his
eighth battery in the most favorable po
sitions around our lines, and frotu these,
storms of shot and shell woto hurled in
to tho charging ranks. With most reck
less bravery the rebels rushed on, and
when they wore within a few hundred
yards of our works our boys opened 011
them with so terrible a tiro of musketry
that it seemed us if tithing tjo'iltl li.*?
before it; bin no nave ting v. w pcrcei.iid
in theso advancing linos. On they came.
They rushotl up to the vory parapet of
our wotks, and stuck their heads under
tho heads of tho logs 011 our battlements.
On tho Columbia piko tho prelsuro 1
j was so groat that some ol Cox's and
I Wagner's men temporarily gave way.?
Up to this limit the brigade oumnianded
by tho gallant Col. Opdyke, of the 12?tii
Ohio, bad been hrhl in n mnnnor in re
j servo. When our lino gave way along
the Columbia pike, it remained in re
| sorvo not long. ' Col. Opdyki'," said
Gen. D. S. Stanley, "our line is broken
yonder; it must bo restored." "It thall
lie restored," replied Op lyke, and bis
hrignde rushed bnldly into the opening.
The rebel.", who bad crowded over oun
works had not time to rotire, ond Cox's
