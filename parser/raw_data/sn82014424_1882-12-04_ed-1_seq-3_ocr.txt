tho death nnd burial of Errlckson nt n o Int
whoro thoy supposed thoy woro about forty
flvo miles from liulun. Ho enld that on tho
morning of tho Oth ot Cctohor, whllo
lbo men wero out seeking wood, Do Long
asked him It ho felt strong enough to nmko n
march across country for about twonty-ilvo
miles. Witness ngrood to go, nnd soloctod

they wcro talking, Errlckson, who had
been asleep, nwoko nnd cried out
tbat It wns all up with him and died. Wltnoss
suggested burying him In a bole, or to leavo
hint In tho hut. Do Long said, howovor, that
a seaman's gravo was tho water, nnd thoy
should bury Errlckson in tho river. Tho body
wns sewed In tbo canvass naps ot thotont,
welgbls ot sods ot dirt attached to tbo foot
and It was covered with n ring and tbo burial
prajcr lead. Tbo body was subsoquontly
shoved Into tho river through a

flrod over tho gravo. Returning to tho) camp

ErrlekBon on an old board and hung It up at

they could And to fasten It. Thoy thou ro

"Ileporl or tho Secretary or Iho Navy,
Tbo annual roport ot tho Socrotary ot tho
Navy shows that tho Navy luclndos 1,817

Promotion by selection to tho gradoot roar

boing tho amour Is nocessary for all tlio work

Concluding, tho Socrotary says i " If tho naval
