THE IRISH FREE STATE
IRELAND IS FREE!
In the placS of a province, governed almost entirely from London, the
Emerald Isle takes its place upon the Dominions of Gre(at Britain and its
prime minister will rank with that of Canada, Australia, South Africa and
New Zealand. Truly the world moves on.
For generations the "Irish question" has been one which has affected
not only the British Empire but also the other gTeat English speaking nation
of the woijd the United States. Ireland has suffered during the centuries,
but in the last few years many people have become convinced that a part or
Ireland's trouble was to be found In Ireland, among Irishmen.
The creation ot the Irish Free State, however, should eliminate the trou
ble. Ireland will govern itself under a true dominion status. It will stand
in the same position as does Canada. It will find it necessary to prove its
capacity for real self government.
Ulster, too, is protected. If the northern part of Ireland refuses to agree
to the terms of the settlement, it Is provided that another parliament may
sit in the north.
If history repeats itself. Ireland will become a loyal part of the great
British Empire. It may take a few years before the old rancor disappears.
It may be several years before the north and the south of Ireland are In com
plete accord. Ifwill come, however, and when it does it will mean a further
stabilization of world conditions.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
LLOWING the precedent set by Woodrow WUson, Warren G. Harding,
Tuesday, appeared before a joint session of congress and personally de
livered his message to the sixty-seventh session of that deliberative body.
While devoid of glaring headline material, the message Is indicative of the
period and of the necessities which confront the country at the present time.
Doubtless, there may be found in the message features that fail to meet the
approval of all but, on the whole, the recommendations of the president are
solid, substantial and worthy of ; the most serious consideration of the congress
. :.). u ' :. r . . . .. ." 'T".H
. While fiarfjing ppsoposM for a flexible tamr is not new; tne proposed
manner of application would be a novelty for it is based on, the "American
valuation plan," which has been so thoroughly condemned in many quarters
of the country. It is, undoubtedly, the greatest desire of the American people
that the tariff be taken out of politics-and placed upon a sound economic
basis. Congress, however, refuses to have it otherwise than as a political
football and one of the first of the president's recommendations is probably
doomed for the scrap pile.
Samuff Corners, president of the American Federation of Labor, im
mediately criticizes the proposal to enact legislation creating an industrial
tribunal. This being the case,- it would ap'pear to be a very substantial rec
ommendation in favor of the passage of such a statute. Mr. Gompvs prates
of protection for the public but his actions speak loudly and the results he
secures are purely and simply in favor of the organized class of labor in the
United States. Strikes and economic hold-ups by labor are equ?JIy offensive
to the government and to the people. Mr. Harding, undoubtedly, recognizes
this and his proposal, in consequence, should be taken most seriouslv.
Tax free securities are fairly driving the industrial Investment bond to
cover." On the other hand, the surtax, imposed by the government, is the un
derlying cause. Remove the tax exemption ''given municipal securities, by
constitutional amendment, and the states ot the union w.ould be forced to
pay higher rates for loans. '
Such action might involve the market for industrial securities, but it
also might depress the market for every kind of securities. What is most
needed is a decided curtailment of the sur tax provision of the revenue bill,
to the end that industry be not crippled and that business go forward. This
would do more toward lightening the general tax load than anything this gov
ernment could offer. Mr. Harding is heading his'party for trouble when he
attempts to revise the sur tax or eliminate tax free securities. The Demo
crats in congress have already protested against the reduction of the sur tax,
in spite of the fact that the San Francisco platform practically pledged the
party in favor of such action. '
The president seeks food for Russia. A laudable request. He expressed
the hope that the conference on disarmament would result in actua.l world
peace. He touched other subjects, both Internally and internationally, but on
the whole confined his attention to those few subjects. Whatever we may
think of the president from a partisan standpoint, it is to be hoped that the
congress will indulge in more constructive legislation than it did in the spe
cial session and aid, directly, in the return of that famous "normalcy" upon
which the president rode into office.

Increased Development Urged
In Both Army, Navy, and
Civilian Flying Fields
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Presi
dent Harding transmitted to congress
today the annual report of the na
tional advisory commictee for aero
nautics with the recommendation
that a bureau for the regulation and
development of air navigation be es
tablished in the department of com
merce as proposed by the committee.
"I think there can be no doubt."
the president stated In a message,
"that the development of aviation will
become of great importance for coxa
imerce as well a national defense.
White the material progress In air
traft has been remarkable, the use
has not as yet been extensively de
veloped in America."
A bill to create a bureau Is pend
ing before the house commerce com
mittee. '
The report which supplemented one
made- last April recommended con
tinuation of the air mail service and.
development of aviation for military
1 and naval purposes. Liberal prov l-
Blon should be made, the committee
said, for maintenance of the army
and navy air services, and for train
ing of their personnel.
the report emphasized the necessi-
of treatment given Gardner there In f r J " " " " :7,f,""

"Man-Woman-Marriage," : presented
at the Lyri.: theatre yesterday creat
ed a furore. It is said to have cost
half a million dollars to produce and
that over five thousand people ap
pear in the scenes.
The story is of universal appeal. It
has beeu pronounced by literary crit
ics to be amazing in the ragniture of'
us theme.
It traces the ascendancy of woman
through the opalescent haze of mym
olcgy and the confusing reality of
the medieval period into the amaztog
whirl of the modern day. Customs
una haoits are strangely contrasted
in this engrossing drama of "Man-Wo-man-Marriage"
through the ages past.
. In the screen s early days, girls
became stars because of physical pul
chritude. It was not so much a que3-
I tion of talent. Today great pictures
demand a star with talent tor act
ing, personal magnetism and mat al
most undet'inable characteristic call
ed screen personality. Man-Wonpn-alarriage"
combines at once a story
wuh a plot, punch, a mighty lesson
and new screen ideas. . entertains,
it stamps an indelible impression up
on the mind, it creates a desire to
see more pictures of its remaraaoie
calibre.
"Man-Woman-Marriage" will be
shown for the last time at the Lyric
today.
A DEADLY WEAPON
JN some sonsible and enlightening remarks yesterday on the demoralization
of German currency and finance, Mr. Paiy Warburg spoke of the printing
press as a "deadly weapon." It is such when ffight and day it manufactures
government obligations and bank-notes. In all the discussions ot relief for
Germany in the way of long-term credits or even a moratorium, the bankers
of England and France and the. United States make one fixed stipulation.
The floods of paper money In Germany must be checked. The printing press
must cease to turn out illusorp and derisory symbols of vain j.
Germany has been in this respect a financial sinner, but it is Soviet Rus
sia that has done the most terrible execution with the doadly weapon. In
the Bolshevist organ, the Pravda, of Sept. 23, the Coinmissary of Finance,
Krestinsky, states that the total number of paper rulis issued up to that
date was something more than three trillions. Theue are veritable astrono
mical figures. But do they suffice? Not a-crrdins to Commissary Krestin
sky. To meet "all the requirements" of th ) viet Government he reports
that some thirteen or fourteen trillions more i rs needed. But the printing
presses, using plates for small denominations ol bills, are far behind with
'their work. Hence it is proposed that new i"-j'js be or one, five and ten
million ruble notes. In that way the dizzy Inch's could be more quickly
reached, and a 5.000.000-ruble note would come in handy for car fare.
iimh financial folly seem us uubelievablo as it is colossal. Yet to add
one more touch to it tln Foviet authorities are gravity talking about nego
tiating Iohiix !!!" and an gravely stating that a "moratorium" wilf have
to be granted n lue old Russian debt. They would probably make a solemn

Describes Crime '
Gardner, under cross examination
today, related for the first time how
be got into the mail car in which he
was captured at the Atichiison, Tope
ka and Santa railway station here on
November 15 by Herman Inderlied of
Phoenix, mail clerk in charge cf the
car.
Gardner said he went to Hie mail
car while it was standing in the rail
road yards here during the afternoon
of the 15th, bored a bole in tne aoor
of a closet in the car, returned to his
room where he1 left the gimlet with
which he bored the hole, and got his
gun. Then he said he went back to
the car, got in the closet and stayed
there while the car was switched
alongside the station and coupled on
to the train, of which it was to be a
part. He was in the closet until ne
approached Inderlied and ordered him
to put up his hands, he said.
The prisoner today testified that
the only things of value that- he got
out of the mail he toon at Maricopa
were a ladies wrist watcn, an avia
tor's pin, in the shape of a pro'pellor,
and some money, "maybe 1 50 and
maybe only J40 or I'iO," he said.
Gardner's most serlouB clashes with
the district attorney occurred when
the latter tried to find out wnere
three mail sacks that were taken from
Maricopa were lef by cirdner, and
when iFlynn tried to discover Jthe
object of a trip Gardner said he made
to Tucson about October 28 or 29.
Interrupts the Court
It was during the discussion ot the
mail sacks that Juuge Sawtelle In
terfered. While the judge was ad
dressing the jurors explaining why
he did not punish Gardner for refus
ing to tell where the sacks were,
Gardner jumped to nis feet, turned
toward the judge and exclaimed:
"Judge, I told Fred Weage (deputy
United States marshal), over in the
county jail, that when this trial is
over I'd tell him where those sacks
are. I won't tell him (pointing to
Flynn) nor Chance (E. D. Chance,
post office inspector here.)" Turn
ing toward Weage, who was sitting
in the court room, Gardner asked:
"Didn't I tell you that, Fred?"
"Mr. Weage says trial's right," said
Gardner, turning and addressing the
jury. Then the judge resumed his
remarks to the jury.
Again Argues With Flynn
Later, in reply to queswou by
Flynn regarding what he had done
with the ti'ne he arrived in Phoenix
on Octobc 22, until he committed the
robbery at Maricopa on November 3,
Gardner told ot the trip to Tucson.
"I didn't intend to tell you what 1
did in Tucson or who I saw there."
he said in reply to one of Flynn's
questions. "1 weut there ou .e.k
sonal business."
"Legitimate?" asked Flynn.
"Yes."

Unlimited Development
WASHINGTON, Dec. v. (By the
Associated Press.) The American
attitude toward aviation appears to
be that it should have unlimited de
velopment. ' .
This attitude, it was learned today,
was Informally developed in the first
meeting ot the sub-committee on avia
tion.
The instructions of the delegation
heads to the sub-committee were ex
tremely brief, being "to report on the
number, character and use of air
planes,". fc,.v.
All members of the sub-committee
consider the Instructions to be too
brief and decided? to ask the commit
tee for more specific directions.
