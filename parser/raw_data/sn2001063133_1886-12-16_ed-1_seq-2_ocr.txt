A Washington correspondent says
that there was a [hitch in the proposed
marriago between. Miss Mitchell, the
daughter of the Oregou senator, and
the Duo de Rochefoucauld, who met
her in Paris and was deeply smitten
by her charms. It seems that the Due
demanded a larger settlement upon his
bride than the senator could afford to
give, and therefor the engagement was
broken,
The men who want to whip the editor

kicked the men under the table, took
the cowhide from the woman, and then
drove the whole party into tho street.

A curious agency has beon started in
Paris. It is a model agency, where
painters may go and pick out new
models for thoir work. The demand
for models for some reason always ex

indeed, is he in New York. The
agency in Paris is recruited from the
ranks of unemployed workmen and
women, and supberb specimens of
physical beauty have already been
found in its ranks.
Art lovers will be gratified to hear

that date, by order of the Secretary of

Tho New York Stats Dairy Commis
sioner has submitted to the general
counsel, Messrs. Risley, Quin & Perry
of Utica, questions as to the legal effect
on the statutes of tho State of the law
of the United States taxing oleomar
garine, etc. Aftor a full examination
of the whole scope of tho matter an
opinion was arrived at which was sub
mitted to Attorney-General O'Brien for
his views. After examination the
opinion was returned with tho Attorney
General's indorsement.
Assuming this to be correct it would
seem that any state laws are fully
operative so long as they do not con
flict with the laws of Congress. The
opinion is important, especially in its
last clause, and is as follows:
1. No substitute for dairy butter
made from the substances prohibited by
Sec. 7 of Chap. 188 of the. laws of 1885,
as amended,
"in imitation or semblance
Of natural butter," can be made in this
I.
State nor kept for sale or sold within
this State, whether such article was
made or produced within this State or
within any other State or Territory
within the United States.
2. If imported from a foreign country
and tho duties are paid thereon, it can
be brough there, obtained, and sold by
the original importer in its original
packages, and by no one else, on his
complying with the provisions of the
act of Congress, provided ho also com
plies with tho statutes of this State in
reference to marking, branding, de
livery of, labels, etc.
3. The act of Congress docs not af
fect the laws of this State, except as re
gards the imported article. It is the
duty of the Now York Stato Dairy
Commissioner to enforce the existing
laws of tho State according to the fore
going views.
M'Whacker as a 1'olltlcinn.
Rev. Joel McWhacker tapped the
tosselated pavement of the Palace hotel
lobby with his well-developed loft foot,
and gazing reproachfully at a crack in
the side of his boot remarked that lie
guessed he'd ambulate out of town till
tho election was over.
"You don't seem to liko politics any
more," remarked Count Smith to the
man of God.
"No, Smithy, I don't," said Rev.
Joel, carelessly.
Now, if tliero is ono tiling on this
earth that will put the placid count in
a violent temper it is to bo called
Smithy, but- ho knew Rev. Joel's reputa
tion as a gun lighter, and contented
himself with saying in a sneering tono:
"I suppose you soured on the gamt
whon you wore tarred and feathered at
Lincoln, Cochiso county, for falsifying
the returns."
Rev. Joel looked at the count for an
instant, and said: "Who told you that,
lie? It was nothing of tho kind."
"Oh I hoard it from a drummer,"
said the count, carelessly.
"Well, I guess I'll tell you about it,
as you havo heard an incorrect version
of tho affair,"
said the Rev. McWhacker,
his brow clouded with thought,
"It was a good many years ago, and
I'd almostforgottcn the matter till you
spoke of it, but it all comes to'my
mind now: You see. 1 was chaplain
of tho legislature down there, and a
galoot from Lincoln got the boys to
cut down my pay from $20 to $10 a
daj'. He said he,thought the Lord
would answer tho prayers of a $10
man as well as a $20 one, anyhow, and
if He didn't he guessed the legislature
could stand it. Of course I was bound
to get even, and when I heard ho was
running for office again I went over to
take a hand.
"Ah said Rev. Joel, as ho reached
for the count's cigar-case. "It was an
old trick, but a good ono. Just as the
count began I stopped out into the
street, and, as luck would havo it, an
eastern drummer was passing. I pull
ed my gun and dropped liiin. Of
course, all the boys rushed out to get
his boots off, and before they got back
1 had tho box iixed, and my economi

swore that ho had voted at least seven

thought I had gono iu little too far, so I

and left town. That's all there is in

Silk-Culturo in Mexico.
The following figures on silk-culture
in Mexico compiled from Consul Gen
eral Porch's report to the state depart
ment will be found very interesting
reading: Tho places where silk
worms are raised at present are Oaxa
ca, Tetla, Puebla lxmiquilpan. Hidal
go, and in various parts of the states
of Jalisco, Tlaxcala, Michoacan, Quer
etaro, Vera Cruz, and Chihuahua. Mul
berry trees exist and flourish in the
states of Puebla, Oaxaca, Tlaxcala,
Michoacan, Zacatccas, Hidalgo, and
VeraCruz. It is estimated that iu the
course of the next five years more silk
will be manufactured in Mexico than
can bo consumed by the people. The
supply of raw material is at present
very limited, not sufficient to supply
tho threo or lour factories in the repub
lic, which aro compelled to import a
great quantity of their silk in skeins
from China: several states, however,
are doing everything they can to stini
ulato silk-worm culture, and tho result
is that theindustry is rapidly increasing.
The chances for successful silk manu
facturing aro very good on account of
extreme cheapness of labor, th
the
average wages of women, who are tho
best operatives, being 37 cents a day,
and it is stated by competent authori
ties that silk can be manufactured in
Mexico for 50 per cent, less than is
possible in Franco
Gray Heads in Congress.
Indianapolis Journal: There is a
great deal of old materml yet in Con
gress, despite the fact that many of the
statesmanic landmarks have been re
moved during the last few years. In
tho Senate Morrill, of Vermont stands
out as tho oldest man, being 76 years of
age, while his colleague, Edmunds is 68.
Payne of Ohio is also 76 years old, but
falls short of Morrill by seven months.
Dawes of Massachusetts is 70, although
ho does not look 65. Wade Hampton
of South Carolina, Evarts of Now York
andSawyer of Wisconsin have withstood
the blasts of 68 winters and the heat of
as many summers. Evarts looks much
the oldest of tlio trio. Conger of Michi
gan is spry, but has worn 69 years.
Wilson of Maryland and Browu of
Georgia aro each 65, while Beck of Ken
tucky is 64. Pugh of Alabama is 66,
and Saulsbury, the rusty bachelor from
Delaware, is 69, and looks it.
There is no one in the House so old as
the two oldest Senators. Judge
Kelley, the Father of tho House, tho
venerable Pennsylvania protectionist,
leads tho list, He is 72, but Eldredgo
of Michigan, it is said, is quite as old.
Plumb of Illinois is 70, while the
directory records Wait of Connecticut
as 75, which must be an error. Curtin
of Pennsylvania is 69 Roagan, the ex
Confederate Postmaster-General and
Treasurer, the pride of Texas, is 60, as
is also Singleton of Mississippi. Bar
bour of Virginia is 66 ditto Lindsley of
Now York. Charley O'Neill of Penn
sylvania is 65, Wadsworth of New York
the same, and Geddes of Ohio makes
up a good 62. Tho old men in the
Senate seem t« be much more aged in
actions than those the Houso.

True Meaning of Christinas.
Christmas is the greatest day in the
year. Is there a feeling that there is
getting to be too much of it? not too
much of it in tho way of kindliness and
brotherly love, but in the way of worry
and expense, The weeks before it are
full of feverish excitement, of nervous
expectation, of perplexity the days fol
lowing it, of exhaustion. Childhood is
on tiptoe in two hemispheres, and
childhood lias become so conscious of
its deserts that it is next to impossible
to surprise it, except by small gifts.
Tho day has to carry a tremendous
load. The obesity that might bo dis
tributed in healthful streams through
out tho year ispouredout in it in prodi
gal waste by some, who seem glad to
relieve themselves of obligation by a
single act. In point of cost it is equal
to half a dozen weddings. Year by
year the expense of gifts increases. Is
this tho dictate of fashion, or owing to
the growth of kindly feeling?
Ls it a spontaneaous response to tho
spirit of the day, or do any people make
gifts because they aro expected to, and
because ever}' body else does, and be
cause there has grown up of late years
a rivalry in this matter? Since tho
Puritan distrust of this great feast-day
abated, the American people, who are
the most generous people iu the world
have taken up Christmas with the same
enthusiasm that lately almost buried
funerals under a weight of floral trib
utes. We readily incline to excess, to
an excess that, destroys the object wo
seek. Even for our pleasures and
amusements wo work harder than any
other people, and probably get less rest
and entertainment. At the rato'wo are
now rushing Christmas wo are in dan
ger of wearing it out. in a decade or
two more, It is already a period from
wjiich too many people date nervous
prostration. Instead of making the
season a simple and enjoyable holiday,
we aro in danger of making it an in
tolerable burden.
It is because the Drawer desires to
preserve this Christmas season as one
of gayety and frolic and simple plea
sures, and widening and deepening
Christian charity, that it makes these
unwelcome observations. There are
no more engaging croatures than chil
dren, unless it be maidens at the ago
when, on holidays, they pose as first, or
second cousins, or serene and lovely
elderly people in tho midst of an affec
tionate family. But it cuts across the
spirit of the holiday when the children
are more eager for a costly gift than
for a game of blind-man's bull', and tho
maidens do not value the salute under
the mistletoe unless it is accompanied
by a diamond bracelet and the elderly
people, disturbed by this cultivated
habit of greedy expectation, are grum
bling about the expense of the season.
There is small danger that charity to
the poor will be overdone, that the
spirit of the day in regard to inter
family and interstate and international
good-will may go to excess, or that the
leaven of the Sermon on the Mount will
work too powerfully in a society that
would be a mass of selfishness without
it.
It is incalculable what Christmas
and the spirit of Christmas has done
and is doing for tho world. The sun
that rises on that day in our Northern
latitudes may not, melt the ico iu the
streams or the frost on the window
panes, but there is no sun like it for
•thawing the human heart throughout
Christendom. There is no day like it
for assuaging enmities, and reviving
lender memories, ami drawing together
the estranged, and narrowing the gulf
between classes. During this day the
world is a brotherhood. In the won
drous Birth of a Child all the world re
news for some hours its childish faith
and simplicity. The spirit of this
event prevails far beyond the circles
where it is regarded as a reality.
Why overlay it with artificiality?
Why make it an expense hard to be
borne? Why put into the preparation
for it an amount of labor and worry
that ends in weariness and exhaustion?
Costly gifts are the least necessary part
of it, worry is foreign to its spirit, and
both together may make it in time a
burden, ami as distasteful as the noise
and.incendiarism of the Fourth of July.
The perpetuity of tho best institution
depends upon moderation. Childron
are. the hope of tho worhk We should
not undervalue them because they are
plenty. Home Rule is just now tho
most popular doctrine in tho world.
But it may bo just as well for the next
generation if tho children aro not now
all Home Rulers. Give tho parents a
chance they will be all tho better for
it. Let us ease up a little
on the worry and cost of Christmas
and keep the best holiday of the ages
in tho old spirit of unostentatious
charity and tho exercise of mirth and
good-will that refreshes and does not
weary.—Charles Dudley Warner, in
Harper's Magazine for December.
Sitting Down With Preachcr.
In a Western town dwells Elder R—,
a clergman very well known through
out his State for ability and shrewdness,
It is pretty generally believed, on ac
count of his evident knowledge of the
ways of the world, that he was rather
"rapid" in his youth. Among his
skeptical neighbors is a hotel-keeper of
jovial disposition and libera] heart.
Whenever the elder hits a specially
convincing and swooping discourse pre
pared it is his wont to give special in
vitations to his doubting friends to -be
present, and tlieso are sometimes ac
cepted with tho proviso that the dominie
and his lad}' shall meet tho party at
the hotel at dinner on an appointed
day during tho week, so they mav have
an opportunity to defeud themselves.
On these occasions dinner often lasts
tho whole afternoon, and the elder is
obliged to parry |the combined blows
of tho opposition.
On ono occasion mine host found his
match in the clergyman in a worldly
way, and it was this circumstancc that
I sot out to relate. The landlord re
turned on a certain Saturday evening
from a trip to tho far West, and next
morning found him, with his wifo.
seated in a front pow. When tho plate
was passed, ho felt in all his pockets,
but could find only a comb, jackknife,
and a circular piece of ivory marked
"5," which is supposed "by poker
players to represent value. This latter
was dropped in the plate under the vig
lant eye of the pastor, but unnoticed
by tho sexton, whose eyes had been
dimmed by age. On receiving the col
lection, the psistor missed tho "chip,"
and asked the sexton for it. Tho latter
had thrown it away, supposing it to be
a mark of disrespect from some scoffer.
Elder R—knew his man, and caused
the representative of value to be re
covered. Next morning, as the landlord
was diluting upon his trip to a crowd of
friondB Jin his oflico. Elder K— appeared,
and advancing to tho counter, placed
the chip down with tho click so familiar
to connoisseurs, and ftsked, "Can you
UtsSfic
•redeem' that this morning, Bro
ther— SP."
Of coui^se S. could not do less than
handout a five-dollar bill, and the elder
departed, after expressing the hope that
ho might always be as lucky. Mine host
says he shall not "sit down" with a
preacher again.—PET R. O'LF.UM.

but the amount of suffering
I have endurod
since that time, I feel to be sufficient for a
life-time. I had a severe attack of sciatic
rheumatism, which completely prostrated
me my limbs and feet, and in fact my
whole body, was so drawn out of shape that
it was impossible to movo without assistance.
I was unable to straighten my limbs or to
stop on my feet for more than a year and
my life was dispaired of. I was treated by
three good physicians, and they and my
friends did all they could to relievo my suf
fering—but with no avail. My hips were
blistered, and my limbs rubbed, bathed and
bandagoa, but nothing they conld do af
forded mo even temporary relief. ,Tongue
cannot describe my suffering. urged them
to lot me try Dr. Pardee's Remedy, as I had
read so much about it, and of those who had
been cured by its use, that it gave mo confi
dence in it, although I confess I had little or
no faith in so-called patent medicines. The
remedy was procured, and I commenced us
ing it as
directed, and after taking it a short
time could see that it was helping mo.
I began to perspire freely, and as the per
spiration increased tho pain decreased, but
my clothing and bedding was a sight to bo
hold, being nearly "as yellow as saffron."
I had taken the Remedy but a short time,
•when I could sleep like a child, and relish
my food like one. Thank God it has- cured
me, and I am to-day as healthy and strong
as before, and can wclk and have as free use
of my limbs as over. I havo recommended
your Remedy to very many who wore af
flicted, and I do not know of a caso that if
has not cured. I am confident thnt it will
cure young people, if it will cure at my ago.
You are at liberty to use my name, if it will
be the means of inducing any poor sufferer
to use your excellent Remedy. I am very
gratefully yours,

l'altll Cure.
At the meeting of tho Baptist con
ference in Baltimore, Dr. Van Meter of
Rome, Italy, gave the audience his ex
perience in faith cures.
"I was walking briskly in the streets
of the Eternal City," he said, 'some 1(1
years ago, when I slipped and fell
violently on the pavement. When I
recovered my senses I found I was
unable to move and was carried fo my
home, where llav for a long time under
the care of able physicians. After a
time I was ordered to hot baths in Ger
many. I went, but experienced no re
lief, I then went, to London and took
rooms in tho same house with Dr.
Smith one of tho editors of the Loudon
Standard.
"One day I heard of afaith healcrand
said to Smith: 'Here is a chance fo get
a story for your paper. I'll go wilhyou
to this man and lot him try Ids hand on
mo, and when he fails you oari expose
thelnnnbug.' He agreed and! crawled
there with him on my crutches, and on
arriving threw myself on the sofa, and
presently tho healer entered and 1 began
explaining my case, but in a moment he
stopped me and said: 'Wait 1
feel the
healing power upon me.'
"I smiled at Sihitli amused at what I
considered his charlatanism. In a
moment, after an earnest prayer, he said:
'Stand up,' audi did so. 'Leanoverand
touch the floor,1 I obeyed. Run up
stairs.1 I did so without trouble or pain
of any kind. How do you feel he asked
on my return to the room. 'Likea fool,'
was my reply.
"1 left my crutches it his' house and
walked home, und have continued walk
ing ever since. I do not attempt! to ex
plain it. I simply know it is so. I
went there nn unbeliever in faith cure,
and a cripple, and I came away a per
fectly well man. I only know that
what I want I pray my Heavenly
Father for, and am certain that if it is
right for me to have it it will be given
mo by him."
