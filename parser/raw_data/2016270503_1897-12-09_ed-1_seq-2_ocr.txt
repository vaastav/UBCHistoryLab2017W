Democrats and populists are not be
hind tho republicans in joining in the
general sympathy extended to Mr Mc
Kiuloy because of the great sorrow
xv-tiloh hao come upon him through the
agonies of his dying mother. For the
time, tho strong opposition to the
recommendation's of his annual mea
saX) is held in abeyance, and the criti
cism to which the message is open re
mains unspoken. In tha presence of
the angel of death, as it were, any dis
play of partisanship would be unseem
"T. The opening of the session of
congress was, owing to the circum
stances, quieter than usual, although
the crowds were there as usual. There
woro numerous empty seats in both
Uor.se and senate, although the attend
ance was, on the whole, about up to the
average of opening days.
The trading stamp scheme received
quito a shock yesterday by the decision
of the court of appeals at Washington,
when it was decided that the business
was illegal and that the merchant giv
ing them out as well aa the company
behind the scheme were liable to arrest
anI fine for enga-ging in the business.
This was the third trial of the case, and
those who have been looking for the
outcome, are satisfied from this last de
cision that the trading stamp has re
ceived its death blow. It would seem
that the merchants of Hartford, Nor
wich, Waterbury and other cities, who
have been looking for a means to fight
the trading stamp companies have the
weapon at hand in the form of this re
cent decision. If it is illegal la one
state it surely is in all, and the out
come in this locality will be awaited
with interest.
President McKinley is now In the
fourth quarter of the first year of his
term as president, and the reports sent
out for the first nine months are not
as encouraging as we were led to believe
they would be. The deficit under the
Dingley tariff bill does not grow
smaller, all of which leads an exchange,
which has been carefully following the
administration, to remark: "It is in
teresting to note that the completed
quarter shows no Improvement over the
first or the second. The completed
third Quarter, indeed, I is even more
striking In Its demonstration of this ad
ministration's inefficiency. Earlier in
the year it might have been claimed by
the partisans of the administration
that the McKinley policy had not been
duly tried; that the plans of the new
president and his managers had not had
opportunity of experiment. At the
end of the second quarter, there being
no chaage for the better in the manage
ment of the country's affairs, it was
warmly asserted by the partisans that
the Dingley law, product of the admin
istration, had yot to prove its efficacy
as a panacea for the nation's alleged
ills and the party's admitted weak
nesses. The law was new, said the par
tisans, and uatried. Once well under
way it would sweep aside the treasury
deficit and put plumes of glory Upon the
republican war wagon. Now that we
have reached the end of the third quar
ter of the first year of the administra
tion of Hannaism and Biagleyism, the
adherents of the high tariff policy as
exemplified in the Dingley law, have
nothing to say. Newspapers that warm
ly advocated the McKinley idea are
close-mouthed. Public men on the re
publican side who, honestly or not, put
faith in the bill of Mr Dingley three
months ago, are silent. The hopeful
Mr Lyman J. Gage, who is sitting up
nights thinking of new currency pol
icies, ambles forth in a declaration that
early in the next year the Dingley law
will begin to turn the tide In favor of
tho treasury. Mr Gage is but para
phrasing the expressions of republican
statesmen who predicted great things
fw this bill before it became a law.
Even more than they did, Gage knows
that the Dingley bill will not supply the
deficient revenue. The bill's prophets
were guessing. Mr Gage bases his
statements upon figures gathered from
the custom house. Those figures tell
him as truthfully as figures tell every
thing that the deficit grows apace under
the operations of the Dingley regula
tion. Thus we have seen that the third
quarter of the first year of Major Mc
Kinley's first and only term as presi
dent has developed absolutely nothing
In the direction of good government.
CURRENT COMMENT.
It is dollars to doughnuts that Jo
seph Benson Foraker won't chip in a
cent to pay that $20,QOO note given by
the Ohio republican state committee.
According to tho latest news, the
Cubans are taking the ending of the
war into their own hands, by taking
forts away from the Spaniards. When
they no longer need help, Mr McKinley
will probably promptly recognize their
independence, and ask the country to
tive him credit for it.
CUBA. IN TOE SENATE
Senator Allen of Nebraska Springs
a New Besolution,
WANTS CUBA RECOGNIZED
He Declares Tbat tlie Commercial
Spirit of the United States Is Pre
venting Action Honse Holds a
Fifteen-Mlnnte Session.
Washington, rec. 9. Mr. Allen (Pop.,
Neb.), introduced in the Senate yester
day a resolution declaring; it to be the
sense of the Senate that Congress
should, with all due convenient speed,
acknowledge the independence of
Cuba. He followed It with a speech,
declaring- that the commercial spirit
of he United States was preventing
?c ..on.
He said that he had long urged rec
ognition of the independence of the
Cubans. He would not be content with
the recognition of belligerency, but
would insist upon the acknowledgment
of absolute political liberty. He was
satisfied that the people would not be
content with the course advised by the
Administration. Inasmuch as the Cu
bans, for more than two years, on
many battlefields, had demonstrated
their valor and love for liberty, he felt
that they had earned a recognition of
their political liberty, and that it ought
to be accorded to them Without fur
ther temporizing. If necessary, this
recognition should be backed by a fleet
of American vessels in Cuban waters.
He expressed a belief that the owners
of 'Spanish bonds in this country,
American citizens holding property in
Cuba which had been injured or de
stroyed by the insurgents, and the car
rying trade of the country, which
might be affected by such a step, had
Joined to prevent th recognition of
Cuba's independence.
Mr. Allen said that"he believed that
President McKinley's statement in his
message that the recognition of the
belligerency of the Cuban insurgents
is now unwise and therefore inadmis
sible, would be a great disappointment
to the Republicans throughout the
United States. The national conven
tion of that party had declared in fa
vor of the independence of Cuba, go
Ing farther than the simple recognition
of the belligerency. He thought that
the President was under obligations to
carry out the pledge which his party
had made a pledge which had been
made to seventy-three millions of peo
ple. The President, Mr. Allen thought,
had been lulled to sleep by the decla
ration of Spain that she would . give
Cuba a semi-political existence. He
expressed the belief that the Presi
dent's neglect to take such action as
would insure the political Independence
of Cuba was an exhibition of "rank
hypocrisy" and a "flagrant neglect of
public duty," which would be corrected
by the "all-ruling power in His own
good time."
Mr. Davis (Minn.), reported from the
Committee on Foreign Relations, a bill
prohibiting the killing of fur seals in
the North Pacific Ocean. He asked im
mediate consideration for the bill, but
Mr. Hale (Maine), objected on the
ground of the importance of the meas
ure and asked that the bill be printed.
Senator Gear introduced a bill autho
rizing the Secretary of the Treasury to
enter a bid for the United States on
bond-aided railroads and to clear off
liens paramount to those of the United
States and appropriating the amount
necessary for this purpose. The bill
is understood to have been framed by
the Attorney General, and it is Intend
ed to open the way to settlement of the
Kansas Pacific debt.
SHORT SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
Pension Appropriation Bill Reported
and Adjournment Taken.
Washington, Dec. 9. The session of
the House yesterday lasted only fifteen
minutes. W. A. Stone (Rep., Pa.), re
ported the pension appropriation bill,
the first of the appropriation bills, and
gave notice that he whould call it up
Immediately after the reading of the
lournal to-morrow. The Committee on
Election and the Committee on Bank
ing and Currency were given leave to
Bit during the sessions of the House.

To Consider the Honse Rules.
Washington, Dec. 9. The Committee
of the Rules of the House, of which
Speaker Reed is chairman, will get to
gether during the holidays to consider
such change of the House rules as has
shown to be desirable. It is not ex
pected that these will touch any vital
points, but will be rather In the nature
of routine changes to facilitate the dis
patch of business.
The three House committees on elec
tions are beginning to map out their
work with a view to determining contested-election
cases at the e&rllest pos
sible day. There are twenty-one of
these contests pending. Some of these
will require extended hearings, but
quite a number can be disposed of
without muoh delay.
The House Committee on Foreign
Affairs will hold its first meeting' to
day, when Chairman Hitt will name
the sub-committees which will consider
the several questions of Cuba, Hawaii,
etc. Thus far there has been no con
sultation on the general line of opera
tion on the numerous foreign Bubjects
before the committee.
France la Aronsed.
London, Dec. 9. A special dispatch
Just received from Paris says that the
French cruisers Jean Bart, Isly, Alger
