WHERE THE SHOE FINCHES
James Creelman, a famous news
paper correspondent and successful
magazine wfiter, says that one of
the reasons for the financial trouble
S> that a billion dollars is constantly
loaned in New York on stocks held
for speculative purposes, and that as
stock speculators are notorious for
being willing to pay exorbintant
rates for money the cash is kept in
New York to supply them with
"chips" for their same.
The law against usury does not
apply to loans on stocks payable on
demand, and when the tide sets
In against them the speculators will
pay almost any amount for ready
cash rather than forfeit their seats
fn the exchange and get out of the
•ante.
Mr. Creelman, a thoroughly sea
soned New Yorker, joins hundreds
of thousands of Westerners in be
lieving that stock gambling is re
sponsible for a large share of the
country's financial woe.
