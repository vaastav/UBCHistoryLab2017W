Hogs.? A drove of hogs, numbering about
three hundred, came to this place last
week. Some of them were sold hero and
the remainder In the neighborhoods bolow.

Chester at 7| cents.
Appointments to the Military Academies?Among
tl\e .late appointments to the
Military A.cndenjjps, wo tind the following
from Lancaster appointed to the Arsenal:
J. Brown, J. J. Mcllwnin, It. W..GousArt,
Delegates to the State. Convention.
?In the few Districts yet heard from, delegates
have been elected to the jjLite Onvention
who favor tho immediate and unconditional
secession of the State from tne
Union. The Stale will in all probability
secede as soon as tho Ordinance uf Seers,
sion can be framed. Tho Convention meets
on Monday next.
Congress.?A brief summary of Congressional
items published elsewhere will
be read with the highest inbirosi. The determined
spirit manifested by Southern
members is iruiy gratifying. Th.it the
Union is <ibout t?> be dissolved scarcely admits
of a doubt. The suggestions of Mr.
Clingmsn, of North Carolina, are sensible
and present an equitable and peaceable
means of effecting the terms of separation >
between the two sections.
The Election.
At the election for delegates to the State
Convention held on Thursday last, Dr. R.
I*. Crawford, Dr. VV. C. Cautiif.n and
Rev. D. P. RopiNsott, (the nominees of the
District meeting) were elected for this District.
Wo regret exceedingly that the vote
was so small and hope that it is no indication
of the interest which our people feel
in the. important issues before the country.

The President's Message.
This anxiously looked for document is
at length before the country. The Presidents
position upon the secession question,the on>
Iv one iu which South Carolina is now partic
ularly iuterested, tins been pretty correctly
foreshadowed in the telegraphic despatches
received from Washington before the Message
was submitted to Congress. He denies
that a Stute possesses the Constitutional
right to secede and argues this at considerable
length. He says : "This Government,
is a great and powerful Government,
invested with all the attributes of sovereignty
over the special subjects to which
its authority extends. Its framers never
intended to implant in its bosom the seeds
ot its own destruction, nor were they at its
/creation guilty of the absurdity of providino
for i(h own dissolution. It was not in.
r?0 ' " "" ""
tended by its frnmers to be the baseless fab-iic
of a vision which, at the touch of the
enchanter, would vanish into thin nir, but
a substantial and mighty fabric capable of
resisting the slow decny of time aud of defying
the storms of nges. Indeed, well may
the jealous patriots of thai day have indulged
teara that a (government of such high
powers might violaUt the reserved rights ,
of the States, and wisely did they adopt
the rule of a strict construction of these
powers to prevent the danger! But they
did not fear, nor had they any reason to
imagine, that the Constitution would ever
be so interpreted as to enable any State, by
Iter own act, and without the consent of liei
si-tor States, to discharge her people from
all or any of their Federal obligations."
But while he denies the right of a State
to accede, he admits that tho people are not
without redress against the tyranny and op
pression of the Federal Government "The
right of resistance 011 tho part of the gov
1 : , ,, J 1
uriiru nj^uiiisi me oppression 01 uieir gov
ernmvnla cnnnot bo denied. It exists inde.
pendenlly of nil constitutions, and has been
exercised nt all periods of the world'* history.
Under it old governments have been
destroyed, nnd new ones have taken their
place. Jl is embodied jn strong and express
language* in our own Declaration of Indepeixiunce.
ljut the distinction must ever
ue observed,-thnt this is revolution against
in established Government, and not a voluntary
secession from it by virtue of an inlersnt
constitutional right. In short, let us
ook the danger fairly in the face : Seces
lion is neither more nor less than revolution.
It mny or it may not be a justifiable
'evolution, bul'still it in revolution."
He says that in the meantime, the Execuive
is bound by solemn oath before God
md his Country to see the laws properly
ixecu'.eo. Hut adds : "What if the per fornance
of this duty, in whole or in part, has
>een rendered impracticable by ^vents over
vhich be could have exercised no coutrol ?
Such, fit the pregeol moment, in the case
hroughout the Slulc of South Carolina, so
ar as the laws of the'United States to neure
the administration of justice by means
>f the Federal Judiciary are concerned. All
lie Federal officers within Us limits, through
chose agency alone these laws can be curied
into execution, have already resigned.
iVe no longer have a l)bt/.et Juige, a I)isrict
Attoruoy, or a Marshal, in South Caro
iuu. In fact, the whole machinery cf the
federal Government, necessary for tlie disributiou
of remedial justice aiiu ng the penile,
has been demolished ; and it would he
litlicult. if not impossible, to replace it."
In respect to the collection of customs,
le says: "The sains insuperable obstacles
io not lie in the way of executing the lnws
for the collection of the customs. The
'ovenue still continues to be collected, as
heretofore, at the custom-house in Charles*
ton ; and should the Collector unfortunately i
resign, a successor may ho sppointed to perform
this duty." Then in regard to the Gov
jrnnient property in South Carolina he says:
''J'hi* has been purchased for a fu'-r equiva
lent,by the consent of the Legislature of the
State," "for tho erection oi forts, mngnzlnsa,
trsenala,'-' &.C., end over these the authority
to exercise exclusive legislation'' has been
expressly grunted by tho Constitution to
Congress. It is not beljeved that any at- |
tempt will lye made to expel tho IJnitod
States from this property by force; but if
in this J should prove to be mistaken, the
oHicer in command of thja forts bus received j
orders to act strictly on the dt Tensive. In I
such a contingency, the responsibility for
consequences would rightfully rest upon
the heads of the assailants." |
Tho President says that lie his no power |
under the Constitution La coerce into sub*
mission a seceding Jdtate. Ilo submit,* to
Congress the whole question in ail ol its
benrings, and intimates that the emergency
may soon arise when that body will be called
upon to decide the momentous question
whether it poaaesaes tSo power, by force
of arins, to compel a Stale to remain in the
IT-:.... U. >.k? .c- -i <
uiiiuii. cio Minrn ifiw |>?>?llinn UIBl l>Ull- j
gress has no such power :
lias the Constitution delegated to Congress
the power to coerce a State into sub
mission which is attempting to withdraw,
or hiui actually withdrawn from the Corded
>/?ey ? If answered in the affirmative, it
inuat he on the principle that the power
hae been conferred upon Congresa to deciire
and to niaito war against a State.?
Aftfer much d^.rfous reflection I have arrived
at the cobcluslon that no ouch power has
been delegated to Congress, or to any other
department of JJ.fc Federal Government.
It ia ruanifeat, upon an inspection ol the
Conatitution, tfiat this Is not among the
|>eciflc arid enumerated powers granted to
Congress ; and it is equally apparent lhat
its exercise is not "necessary arfd proper for
carrying into execution," any one of the?e
powers. Ho far from this power having
been delegated to Congresa, it was expreaaly
refused by the Convention ulijch framed
Ihe Conatitution.
Without descending to particulars it may
>e safely asserted that lite power to make
var against a State is at variance with the
vhole spirit and intent of the Constitution,
{oppose auch a war should result in the
onquest of a Htute, how are we to govern
t afterwards T Shall we hold it as a provace,and
govern it by despotic power ' In
he nature of (binge we could not, by physial
force, control lha will of the people,
ud compel theai to elect Senators and Hepsentatires
to Congresa, and to perform
I i
all the other duties depending upon their
own volition, and required from the free j
citizens of 11 free ?Si?te ns :i constituent i
member of the Confederacy.
Hut if we possessed this power, would it !
be wise to exeieise it under existing oircum
stances '? The object would doubtless be
to preserve the Union. War would not
only present the uiost effectual means of '
destroying it, bnt would banish all hope of;
its peaceable reconstruction. Hosides, in
the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood
and treasure would be expended, rendering j
future reconciliation between the States
impossible. In the meantime, who can
foretell what would bo the sufferings and
privations of the people during its existence
?
The fact is, that our Union rests upon
public opinion, and can never be cemented
by the blood of its citizens Bhed in civil
war. If it cannot live in the affecljons of
the people, it must one day perish. Con
gress possess many means ot preserving it
by conciliation, but the sword was not
placed in their band to preserve it by force."
Hut he solemnly invokes his country men
to pause ami deliberate before they deter*
initio to destroy this, the grandest Tempi?
which litis ever been dedicated to human
freedom since the world began ; and insists
that this ought to be the last desperate rem
?dy of a despairing people, after every other
.constitutional means of conciliation had
been exhausted. He recommends that hefore
the remedy of dissolution is resorted
to, there be a Convention of the people of
all tile Mtates to obtain an explanatory
amendment of the Constitution on the subject
of slaveiy ; and suggests that the
amendment be confined to the final settle*
merit of tLe true construction of the Constitution
on three special points ;
1. All express recognition of the right of
property in slaves in the States whvrc it
now exists or may hereafter exist.
2. Tli? duty of protecting this right in
ull the common Territories throughout
their territorial existence, mid until they |
shall be admitted as State* into the Union,
with or without slavery, jia their coiistitulions
may jircscribe.
X. A like recognition of the master to
have his ala\e, who lias escajiod from one j
State to another, restored and "delivered I
uto him, and of the validity of the f'ugi ]
live Slave law, enacted for this jrirjio.se. to- !
getlivr with a declaration that an Stale laws
impairing or defeuling this light, are violations
of the ('onstituiiyii. and nre cotisefluently
null ai;d void.
Tho above embraces the material points j
in tho Message on the question of Secession
and remedy tor the grievances of the
South. The Pri ident, according to Mr. j
Buchanan's views, has no power l" coerce 1
a Slate into Hubuiistuoii; neither has t'l.n- I
gress the power, and if that bvdy should ,
attempt to rc-ciinct tlio l'\>ree Bill, jiassed |
under the recommendations of (jeneral '
Jackson, lie would be compelled to veto it |
He aecuis, however, to coiitein|dalu retain- |
itig possession of lli** Forts nt Charleston j
in any event, and In continue tlio collection i
of customs for the support of the Federal |
Government. The Officer in commando/,
the Forts has instructions to act strictly on
the defensive. This condition of things
cannot be submitted to b) South Carolina. 1
The possession of these Forts aro essential
to her well being as a separate Government
and in the event sf secession she will bo
bound to attempt to regain possession of
them nt all hazards. It the secession move,
niont a general one, we believe that U.e
Government property in each of the seceding
States will be ahnndoned ; otherwise
there would ensue a general w ar, which it
is evidently the policy and the purpose ol
the Government to avoid, lint should
South Carolina he the only State t*> feeedc
(a contingency not likely to happen) the
course of thr Federal Government in respect
to her, wc believe will be such us is
foreshadowed in ill" Message. I'poll iho

the probability of civil war.

Columbia, Dec. 3, I860. |
1 I Permit me to call your attention to the
1 J I30lh See. of the Act of 1811, which no'
; thorize* Beat Companiee to adopt a uniform,
' and to paae audi by.law* a* may be necessary
for their government 4o., and to reI
quest you to convene your companies at
* once, and to urge upon them the tie. essity
r ot availing Ihemeclvtia of theee provision*
of the law. 'J'1'? unitunu ahopld bo plain,
potpfortable, unoatentati >u? ; for the old
** notion of dressing up eoldiea like scare9
crown, in gaudy color* and buckram suits,
has csploded, and men prepare lor lighting
now-a daya as they do fornny other work,
1 by throwing off all unnecessary and uncom
furlable clothing.
I would recommend for uniform, pantaloons
and roundabout of dark gray cloth,
filling loosely nnd comfortably, and a bisck
I glazed cap?ail of which may be obtained
al a coat uot exceeding live dollars, and
may be worn on all ordinary occasions by
I all who are unwilling or unable to incur
>, extra expeuae for this purpose. I would
. also recommend the paasuga of such byf
laws as would require attendance at company
drill at least once in every two weeks
7 fur the next three months.
I make these recommendations because
I feel assured that In a short tin)? we will
| be involved in a war with the Federal Gov
I eminent, and that it will be a general one.
' And if so, it it obvious that the Bta'.e will
need the services of all her sons.
The ltill before the Legislature for rais|
ing an armed mi'ltary force, and which is
likely to becouht a law, provides for the
raising of a Division of Volunteers; and
to them will be awarded tha honor of be.
ginning tbe fight j but tfie duty of eootin*
, umg it, and oobduoting it to a fuocessful
i termination, will devolve upon the great
r body of the cilixena, the most of whom are
now eorolled in the Boat Comp votes.
