Washington, Deo. 8, i860.
Settlement of the BpanUh Gunboat QueMtion.
The Spanish gunboat question la In course or set
tlement by diplomacy. It Is known tbat they have
been detained by government on complaint of the
Peruvian Minister, his representation being that they
were designed to relieve other Spanish vessels
wiilch were to be employed In hostility
against i'eru. Hence the proceedings instituted
to determine whether or not our neutrality
laws were to be thus violated. But it
is ascertained from an unofficial, but altogether reli
able source, that the Spanish Minister to-day pre
sented a paper to the Secretary of State denying tne
premises of the Peruvian Minister, and giving the
pledge that the gunboats are not to be the means of
carrying on a war with Peru, or any other nation with
which the United States are at peace. This commu
nication was somewhat similar to that heretolore
presented by the Peruvian Minister to remove
the objections of Spain, the object of which was the
release of the two monitors purchased in the United
States for the Peruvian government. The Peruvian
Minister, on receiving a copy of the paper, expressed
himself satlsiled with the explanation and assurance
of i he Spanish Minister. Therefore, the cause of the
detention of the Spanish gunboats is removed. Dis
trict Attorney Pierrepont has already or. Boon
will be made acquainted with these diplo
matic proceedings, and it Is anticipated tbat
his action In the premises will forthwith
lca4 to a judicial order for a release of the gunboats,
wuen they will'be trans'erred oy the oontractor to
the authorities of Spain. The Spanish Minister
takes a view similar to that of the Peruvian Mm
ister to Jlr. steward nearly two years since, namely,
that the war between Spain and Peru and other
South American republics long ago ceased with 110
Intention to renew the hostilities. This is the pres
ent condition of affairs, although not formally an
nounced in the communications between these gov
ernment; but when the representatives of Spam.
Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador assemble In
Washington next January, In joint conference, it is
eonUdentiy expected they will give emphasis to the
fart that peace has been restored among them, with
a desire to cultivate the most friendly relations.

Nlonnl legislation Tor Indians*
Tho Home Committee on Indian Affairs hod a
meeting to-day ami, instructed their chairman to
report a bill providing that hereafter no treaties
shall be negotiated with the Indians under
any circumstances whatever. The bill pro
vides ^at whatever legislation Is necessary
for the Indians shall come directly from Congress,
and that existing treaties sball be annulled as soon
as possible. The bill was prepared by Sidney Clarke,
chairman of the committee, and is understood to
have the approval of tne Senate Committee on In
dian Affairs. It 1s generally conceded now among
Congressmen that it would be better both for tho
government and the Indians if the treaty system
was abolished and the Indians dealt with directly by
Congress.

only two speeches were delivered. In addition to
nearly all the members or the committee several
gentlemen have prepared soeeohea which they are
anxious to deliver. When the bill comes to be con

amendments will be offered, all of which will give
rise to debate.

without touching the matter of compensation. The
Attorney (icncrai had given a decision on that law,
but the heads of the departments had not executed
the law in accordance with that densiou. The law
1 taeir, he believed, was not satisfactory lo the work

tended to demoralize every governmental institution
in which laborers were employed.

TUB TEST OATII.
Mr. Ferry (rep.), or Conn. Introduced a bill to
repeal all laws requiring what was known a* the
administration of tne test oatli. He said that the
proposition to remove ttie disabilities imposed under
the fourteentn ainendmeut would fall short of the
accomplishment of uie object designed, unless ac
companied by the repeal or tbe test oatli The
necessity lor legislation 01 this character, be believed,
had now gone ty. lhe policy of tne removal of
tliose disabilities was one w-hich the experience 01
last summer, and the universal experience of all
parties lu the Southern .state.-., had decided to be a
policy unit ougbt to be adopted by Congress, and as
tue republican party originally enacted those laws
for the security or the government ana the preserva
tion cl 1 lie lire ol tbe nation, ro now, when the
necessity had gone of, it seemed to the vpeaker
best idui tbe same party should remove them.
The bill was then reierred.

remarked that he nail understood tnat a statute ex
isted by which rormer slaves who had serve ! in t!'e
arniv of tne Uuiteii states were excluded irorn the
enjoyment of the military bounty. As li had been
tne objiot 10 give equal rights to all who served un

tno presence of Hun. William McDougall In liacotah
Territory, aud tho opposition of the Inhabitant.* ol
Winnipeg to IiIk assumption of the oillce of Gover
nor was taken up.
.Mr. Uowahp, (rep.) of Mich., said lie thought the
resolution unnecessary, Inasmuch an the interests of
t:ie I'nlteU States were not involved in the local (lis
turbauce wtilcu hail arisen In the Hed Ulver country.
1 he disturbance was confined to one or the remote
possessions of the nonunion 01 Canada, lie had
been iniorincU that Mr. McDougall nan received no
appointment to exercise authority in tne lied Kiver
country, but was acting mh h private citizen, (IioukIi
having received an assurance or lutnre appointment
an coventor ol thai ponton ol BrlU^i Aincrica Known
as the lied Kiver country. M*uyt>r the net tiers on
the northern border of Mfnnesotu wer.?, perhaps,
greatly dissatisfied with some arrangement recently
made by which the Hudson Hay Company had sold
out tbeir interests: and one great object with them
was the erect Ion 01 a local government of i heir own
to look alter their own special interests. Tlie dlrti
cult.v was apparently or a pure.'y local nature.
Mr. Kahsky said a portion ot the people ho repre
sented enjoyed a considerable trade with the lied
Kiver country, and that ttic people of the latter
locality were in a stute or discontent and revolution,
'llie United states was represented tUere uy 11 col
lector ol the revenue and other oltlclals. and it
seemed important that the exact condition ol affairs
there should be ascertained. Agreed to.
CANADIAN KKCIt'KOL'ITV TREATY.
Mr. Thirman, (dem.) or uhlo, offered a resolution
requesting the fresident to intuitu the Senate
waether since the ia?t session of Congress any nego
nations have taken place or been proposed between

laws 011 the subject of Hade and commerce between

Mr. Simnkk : iiiiacsHM the insertion ol theu-uat
clause, "ir iu the discretion 11 tne President the

The resolution us modified uy tlie stlJKCUiou thus
made was agreed 10.
PROTECTION OF CITIZENS.
The resolution bv Air. 8TBWAKT, (rep.) or .Vev.. re
questing the Judiciary Committee to inquire If auy
Mates were denying to any class ol persons the
eipiai jirotectlon or tlio laws, in rioiutiou of treaty
obligations aud of the fourteenth amendment, was
taken up and agreed to.
oi.i:\Ki.vi the maw or run senate.
A resolution ottered by Mr. Drake, (rep.) of Mo.,
providing iliut hereulter the Moor ol the -Senate shall
ne cleared of persons not entitled to IN privileges
ten minutes belore lhe meeting of the body, was
taken up and agreed to by a vote or 19 to 17.
RELIEF FROM DISABILITIES.
The bill to relieve certain persons therein named
from the disabilities imposed by the lourtcenth
amendment to the constitution came up in order.
The bill contains tne names of 400 or 600 persons.
Mr. Sr.MNKK moved toreler tlie bill to a committee,
but after discussion withdrew hw motion, aud the
Dill passed.
The Joint resolution for the relief or person?
engaged in lhe late rebellion, providing that upon
tlie tlual adoption of the filieeuth amendment ail
disabilities sliall cease, was taken up.
Mr. Stew ARTsald he believed the time had arrived
to make the declaration here proposed. No danger
need be apprehended in the immediate removal 01
these disabilities; but, on tne contrary, continued
imposition would have the effect which Con
gress desired to prevent? that of throwing
the former reool states into rebel hands.
That such was tne effeet was evidenced
rrom day to day, becausc beside themselves having
tho power to vote ihey were enabled to excite the
sympathy of their neighbors by appealing to them to
aid in removing their disabiliwcs. Now that uni
versal suffrage hud been secured it would be politic
to close the reconstruction work with universal am
nesty. In (he matter of individual ease" of reiiei
there was much room for imposition upon tee gen
erosity of Congress, and the disabilities of many
persons hud been removed upon unfair and lucor
, rect representations to members ot Congress. Ne
cessarily it was impossible for Congress to exercise
au intelligent discrimination in passing apon these
I cases In detail, aud tne more advisable course was
I to deal with them as a class. Uy means of this de
: duration, that the adoption of the tlttecnth amend
ment would relieve the disabilities now imposed,
1 the cause of reconstruction would be strengt.ieued
aud the adoption of the amendment Itself materially
hastcued.

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
Constitutionality of the Cottou Tax of JSHti.
SO. U8. iVilhutn M. Farrtngton, Plaintiff in
Error, rs. Rotfe S. Saunters. Error to the Circuit
court for the District of IVest Tannessee.?Ttio
plaintiff m error was the owner of 160 bales or cot
tou on which (lie tax of three cents per pound, im
post-it by the internal revenue act of July, 1860, was
laid, lie refused to pay the tax, but Anally did so,
under protest, tn accordancc with the practice in
such cases under the customs revenue laws, to save
t he sci/jire of the cotton; and this suit was brought
to recover back the sum paid, the plaintiff alleg
ing that the tux is a violation of those provi.
slons of the constitution which prohibit the
laying of capitation or other direct taxes, unless in
proportion to the census, and the laying or duties
on articles exported from any State. The lodgment
below was iu favor of the government, and w.ltnf
error was taKeu to this court, where it was now
heard. The plaintiff in error maintains that by the
established law, as derived lrom the constituti* n a
1 ax on lands and nouses ami a capitation tax ate
direct. Taxes on specific articles of consumption or
i xpense are iudirect. and that on ad valorem tux on
personal property, without reference to consti'iip
uon, is of the same character as an ad valorem
tax on land, botn being direct. These conclu
sions are arrived at niter an elaborate ex
amination or the subject of taxation, and
nicy arc submitted to the court as suillclcnt
to show iliat tne tax in question, levied as
it is directly upon production, without rciereuce to
Its use or consumption, is, in Its nature, a direct
lax, winch can no levied only by the rule of appor
tionment. <>u the other branch of the argument it
is Insisted that cotton is uu article produced for ex
portation; and coiton statistics are quoted to show
the iHct From ltuu to 1864 three-fourths to Ave
sixtns oi the coiton raised In the United States was
exported; and In tne years 1*66, lstw and ls?7 the
exports were two-Hums to tliree-lourths. For the
yeur ending June1*1;;, ??7,i:t7.s7B pounds, 01 the
value of $'.'(K2,H07,S10, were exported. Of the por
tion not exported 1ro.11 the United States it, is
asserted as a known lact tnat but an lusignt
c.tnt traction is consumed lu the states
where the conon is produced, the great bulk of it
being exported to other .states in the Onion. It Is
Contended mat nils is a legislative declaration mat
coiton shall not be exported without paying a tax,
and that. If the constitution can be defeated because
the tax is not named an exportation tax. the admira
tion once felt lor its power must be changed into
contempt for tts impoiency. Tne same rules of in
terpretation musii.ts applied to this restriction im
posed upon the leuorai goverumem, as have uni
lormly been to Hie like restriction imposed on t..e
States. Wntle the former is prohibited from laving
any tax or duty on articles exported, the latter" are
prohibited from laying any imposts or dutv on im
ports ?r exports, the ts\ In this case bus
no precedent in ttie past action of the
government, aim no warraut. in the provisions
Of the constitution. If it can be main
tained 1i1ena.il the objections made in the contention
which framed the constitution on granting the tax
ing power are fully realized and Mil the arguments I
by which they were answers proved to be laise. 1
The Attorney General, on behalf of the government,
maintains Mist the power of taxation Is unlimited,
and the extent of it.< exercise rests wholly in the dis
cretion of the legislative branch of tne government,
except m the ihrce pai tictuiars specified in 1 tie con
silium?that direct taxes shall be apportioned; (hat
that ail duties, imposts and excises shall ne uniform
and no tax shall be laid on articles exported from
any stale. The tax objected to must, therefore, be
plainly and clearly shown to be wltniu Hie excep
tion of the constitution or the objection cannot
prevail, hvery presumption is in lavor of its valid
ity. The tax uere complained of is not a direct tax,
being neither a tax on laud, nor a lax 011
slaves, or other capitation tax. The caso
of Hylton vs. The Dinted stales (:i Dall., 171i is j
cited as an authority us to tlm notion of a direct lax,
in Which it was held that a direct tax Includes only I
such a tar as In IW nature capable of apporflon
tneut. witnout creating great uieuualitv ami injus
tice in the application. This tax on cotton is not
capuij.e ol apportionment ainoiif the S tit tea, oh
required in tne cone ol direct taxation, nor h it in
auy respect a tax on land, but a strictly ami pro
perty a duty laid npon a specific commodity or arti
cle ol con--uinpLion. Nor la this u tax on exports,
because it ib laid alike on all cotton, nneiii -r
exported or not, and without regard to exportation.
Articled exported from any State within tUe mean .ng
01 the constitution are articles exported from any
state to loreign couutrtea. 'I lie distinction between
a.i ex, ort Uutv aud an excise is tnat in tlie one c??e
tne tax can oaiy atiacti upon me happening of a
particular event?to wit, the exportation oi the ar
ticle on attiion it ia laid?while 111 the ot.ier tne tax
may auacn to tiie article generally aud irrespective
of tiie happening of sucu an eveiu. Where a tax of
the Utter description is laid upon a commodity,
wiietner grown or manufactured, win e in tha hands
ol the producer or manuiacturer. and without re
gard to its future destination, Its character ceitainly
does not become changed into a tax of the lormer
description uy the mere tact tnat a part, or even the
whole, of the article thus taxed is afterwards entered
lor export to a toreign couutry. That would make
the legality of the tax depeutf not upon tne clrcum
Btauces to which it was adopted oy the I.egu.a
ture, and which c\mted at the Uuie of Ita
collection, but upuii those subsequently transpiring
at the mere will ot individual*, in other words the
law imposing the tuxes, though periectly vulid
wnen it took effect upon the article taxed, would i>e
rendered voin by events happening after its purpose
nail been fully accomplished and its operation in
reference to the article had altogether ceased. The
pr.ncip.e. if admitteu, would render ol little avail
all excise taxation upon articles oi commerce. A
state cannot tax itnoorM in the hands o( the importer,
but can tax merchandise Imported alter it has
passed out of the hands of toe tmoorter, or, II in ins
naiius after the packages are orotceu. On the same
principe, Congress can tax, as a commodity, mer
chandise In the hands of its producer, wlncn may
afterwards be exported, the tax being iaid upon the
prcdaction and not upon any person wnu may ex
port any part of it, and m cousequence of such
exportation. Tne fact tnat mora Am tall me
cotton produced In the country is exported to a
foreign country has nothing to do with the con
Htituality ot the law. If Congress cannot
constitutionally lay a tax upon the production of
manufacture of a commodiiy. because moie thuu
one-half ot it Is exported, it cannot upon any com
modity of which less than one-half is exported, l ue
constitutionality of an act of Congress cannot de
pend upon ilu: state of trade; and u Congress cauuot
constitutionally tax afl.v commodity it some part oi
it is annually exported it cannot lay any excise tax
on commodities at all without providing for a draw
back in case ot exportation, Such a constitution
nullities the power ol Congress to lay excise taxes.
'J?ae tux is an excise tax and is umiortn throughout
tiie i uited states. '1 ne lact that cotton or any otner
article Is not produced or foand alike in all parts oi
the country docs not affect the question. There is
no product of agriculture or inanuiacture which Is
louuu in all the States in quantities exactly propor
tionate to the population or anything else ol all the
Status. It has been the opinion of Coogress irom
tae first, ns would appear from its legislation, tuat
taxes on personal property kept for use were excise
taxes as much as on personal property made lor
sale, aud that the tax upon such products as to
bacco, inaiiniactured or made lor sale, was an ex
cise tax.
The questions were argued at great length on both
sides, no less thau live different, brieis being filed.

is a rooiless enclosure, covers half tho block be

great advantage in bGlug close to tlio centre of a
very fashionable neighborhuoi. The ice yesterday
wan about four niche* thick an 1 straight and level
as a billiard tame. Tho arrangements inado t>v
McMillan were not quite Complete, bat wtieu they
aro there win oe nttij to desire and
nothing to apprehend bat o/ercrowdlng. A
flight of steps lean* down from the sidewalk on
Forty-slxtn street to a Ions, low wooden structure
stretching across one end of the rink. The visitor
having paid hla admission feu at a .-uiall semicircu

ample room warmed by a stove, wr.ere skates are
procured and put oil and cumbrous clothing Is taken
charge of. A bar for refreshments stand-f in ou#
corner, where inild beverage* oniy Will bo provided.
A partition divides tins room from another of eqn.il
size, which la intended to be U3cd by tlio New Yortj
Skating Club. When the floor is iaid with niartmg,
tbe walls papered and pictured uud a stove of rea
sonable size introduced It will make a comfortable
and h&udsotue headquarter.-). A t>ajid of music num
bering eleven pieces was present yesterday,
and blew 01T some pretty airs in v^ry good stylu.
".Sweet Spirit, Hear My 1'rajcr " appeared to be i*
splendid measure of music lor tho .iKaiers, its long
Swelling notes harniouizwig altiiiraoiy With tlio
graceluiiy sweeping curves performed ou the suites.
The riiiic is surrounded by a low railing, over wuiolt
loins can lean and watch the movements of tne
people on the Ice. At nigiit it wi.i be lit b.v a chain

stopped to look and watch the tmidui piroueulng of
some of the lady skaters, l he class 01 persons who
may be expected to patronize this place of amuse

ol base ball, and thousands of men aud maidens sit
lor hours watching with aellguiei attention the
shifting fortunes ol the play, tue skill of mo boy at
the bat or the wonaerf.il fleetness shown in a suc
cessful home run. in the winter it undergoes a
traiiBiormatiou, but it does not lose its

ol' the shin, lie Is dropped iu a lively way on an ice
floor four or six inccs thics because of knocking un

there was room lor ai>out ten times as many more.
Everything Is in readiness lor me season, The

When the nights are dry and dark nil the lamps will

will be taken iu preierence to keruseae, as uemg
much more romantic aud conireui.il to ihe souls of

JUSTICE MOCK-D.
The Convict Mart Allen Still in the City?
Writ of Error 1 tailed by JuJie t nruo-/.u iu
Ilia Cose.
On the 27th of last month, at eleven o'clock
at night, City Jnuge <>unmug S. Lied ford, Jr.,
sentenced the notorious panel thief Mart Alien, the
well known leader of the Eighth ward gang, to tlvo
years' imprisonment In the State Prisoa. The crirnu
lor wliich the ruffian was trie I and condemned was
robbery by tUe extra contemptible "panel'' game.
Tiie defence was persistent, and tho Jury found
much difficulty in agreeing to a vsrdict. indeed, it
was rumored in ilie court room on that even
ing tli&t a "friend or the faiiu'y" or the
Aliens, who, curiously enough, happened to i*
one of the jury, refused to hear anything
or see anything in the ca.-e against tho jeopardized
Mart; and it is said *o confident wore his friends of
acquittal that they offered bets 01 $5 >) to one dollar
that he would not he convicted. The Judge ex
pressed satisfaction with the verdict of guilty which
was finally returned by the jury, and paid no atten?
tlon wnatever to tiio pressure ol certain ward politi
cians who sought to save from his jast doom their
valuable coadjutor. Judge Bcdiord, addressing the
prisoner, said:?do not see any palliating circum
stances in your case, imd therefore deem it simply
my official duty to mate tho severest pautilty," and
then impressively pronounced the sentence.
The verdict gave crest public satisfaction, and
produced an excellent eOecl ou the large class of
thieves of which Mart Allen was the acknowledged
head. The peopie had not forgotten that through
the Influence of wily politicians, titomse.ves liable to
criminal ludictiueui, certain persons who were
taniy tried, convicie 1 aud sentenced for the highest
crime known to the law were walking the streets in
perfect freedom, wlale a large uuuiber
of others wuo had committed offences that
merited severe punishment, were never
brought to trial. But the firmness, energy and
ability dlsplavcd by city Judge iiediordon tho bench
oi tiie (teueral sessions inspired the hope that,
henceforward the transgressors of tho law would
receive fitting punishment aud that justice would
not be mocked durlug las term of oifice. Pntor
nateiy, however, lor the popular wish, tho City
Juugc's duty ends when he semeuces a prisoner.
The influences whicu were attempted to be ex
erci-ed on tne City Judge during tno trial of Mart
Alien, a.id wntch he Indignantly repeued, do not
appear to liave failed of effect in other quarters.
The public will oe astonished -if. indeed, It can be
astonished at any tiling doue oy New iork poli
ticians?thai Mart Allen is not at work in htng Sing
Prison, doiug the State some service ior his many
crimes and misdemeanors, out is in tne quiet enjoy
ment of Ills oti'tm rum di'y. in the city Prisou,
awal.lug with calm coufldeuce the time when soma

it will be remembered that Allen's counsel at
tempted to obtain an arrest of Judgment alter the
rendering ol the verdict, out that Judge BedforJ
promptly refused. The case was clear against th?
prisoner, aud it was impossible to see auy exteuuat
mg circumstances, liadled for tae tliue being, iho
prisoner's counsel determined on taking other
means ol securing the release of tho convict, and tie
succeeded. Tne convict was given over to the
sheriff, who was responsible ior his safe keeping
until lie was securely placed inside the gates ol sing
?Sing. It was sis" tlie duty of the Mieriff to see
that tne convict wa*> sent in charge of
ins deputies to the state 1'rlson as suou
possiole after the rendition of I ha sentence, Hut us
It is custom ary.for the Sheriff 10 put prisoners in the
l'ombs ior safe keeping uiitu ihe deputies are ready
to take them to tln ir designated puce of impnson
nient M;irt Allen ws< conveyed liout the Court <>r
General Sessions and safely locked up for the night
wiiniu the granite walls ol the City Prison. Tins
was mi fsatiiiiiay night, and it could scarcely be ex
pected of the Snerifi's deputies to go up tne river
with the convi ton that day; but Monday was very
I fine and Might, and it would not have injured the
delicate fellows m tne least if the* took the
train ior sing Sing with the much commiserated
Alien. Hilt the Sheriff did not see it and so they did
not. That somebody saw and believed there cau be
no doubt. but who was "seen" is uuothcr matter.
Allen did not go to Sing Slug, and iu all probability
will not. Ills counsel is very adroit, and the Alien
family are not verv poor.
No preparation was made to take Allen to sing
Sing on Monday morning, and t he explanation was
found to be in tiie shape or a "writ of error and a
stay of proceedings 'iu his case issued by Judge
Cardozo, of the Supreme Court of Hie statu of Sen
York, which was duly served on the keeper oi the
City Prisou. This extraordinary conduct was made
known to a few only, and the order of the Judge or a
copy of It is not iu tne Sheriff's oillee.
