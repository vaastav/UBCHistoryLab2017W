PITTSBURG. FRIDAT. DEC. 6, 1869.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE "SEES.
Pittsburg had its fire yesterday, and the
main feeling it one of congratulation that it
occurred when it did and that it resulted no
worse, particularly when one reflects how
terrible, under other circumstances, It might
lave been. Ahotelfirein the daytime inevi
tably suggests how much greater is the
horror of a hotel burning at night, Bo
tinted is the old Mouongahela House with
the history of notable events in Pittsburg
'that a particular and personal regret will be
felt by the community or any serious dam
age to it; but since it liability to disaster
las been so effectually demonstrated, there
is a distinct feeling of relief that the acci
dent occurred when there was a chance for
the guests to escape and for the firemen to
do their work by daylight
This local event will unite with the fires
at Lynn, Boston and Minneapolis in im
pressing upon the owners of property, and
upon insurers, the need for constant vig
ilance. Investigation yet remains to show
positively the origin and causes of the
'Monongahela House conflagration. It is
safe to say beforehand, however, that they
were such as could have been prevented by
proper care on the part of somebody who
did not exercise that care. There is hardly
a fire which occurs or which this unpleasant
iaet may not be stated with an almost abso
lute eertainty that inquiry would bear it
out.
tththi OK THE DEMOCRATS.
The discovery that the cashier of the Ber-geant-at-Arms
of the House in the last Con
gress 'is missing, together with over $70,000
of the pnblic tunds is an unfortunate one
for the Democrats. "While it may not be
fair to impute the dishonesty of the levant
ing official to the whole party, it is never
.theless a fact that he was the personal choice
of the man who waB selected by the assem
bled wisdom of the Democratic Congress
men to take charge of the money used in
.the House expenditures. Less complete and
Wholesale disappearances on the Republican
side have been used by the Democrats to
impeach Bepublican honesty; and the com
pliment is likely to be returned with inter
est. The party cauens which results in ap
pointing men who wind np their accounts
by running away with the cash, will have
to bear the brunt of the criticism.
TJISEHTANGUHG THE H00E.
The impetuosity which is very generally
accepted by the pnblic as one of Governor
Poraker's characteristics has led him into a
most uncomfortable position in the ballot
box forgery matter, as the detailed telegrams
in -yesterday's Dispatch sufficiently
showed. But what his friends most regret
it that his candor did not lead him out of it
as earlyas wonld have been desired. Wood
is an arrant scamp who deserves punish
ment for bis fraud, and he seems to have
been ingenious enough to have thoroughly
imposed on Foraker. Still, the telegrams
which the Governor himself furnishes, show
that he was far more eager to believe "Wood,
and to think ill of, and plot damage to, his
Democratic opponent, Campbell, than is at
all pleasant to contemplate in the attitude
and feeling of one public man to another.
Foraker took the bait so greedily that it is a
case in which there will be little sympathy
for the pain which he now suffers in disen
tangling himself from the decidedly awk
ward and sharp-pointed hook.
Governor Foraker by his boldness and
dash has often won friends and admirers.
The present, however, is an instance in
which these qualities, stimulated by an un
generous impulse to believe the worst of an
antagonist, have served him in bad stead.
He has so much vitality that hitherto he has
quickly recovered from mistakes. This
latest embarrassment, however, he evidently
takes to heart. It will serionsly affect any
political plans or high ambi tions that he may
etill entertain as to the future.
THE EUHIKATIOB OF DEMOCRATS.
It is a remarkable but not altogether
serious state of affairs that is disclosed by
tibe assertion of W. L. Scott that Sir. Dana
of the New York Sun has not a drop of
Democratic blood in his body. This asser
tion concerning the newspaper man who
regards the declaration "I am a Democrat"
as the most thorough epitome of political
"wisdom, is calculated to create donbt
whether there axe any Democrats.
' Tha doubt is strengthened by the fact that
Mr. Dana has led in the discovery that
several prominent men supposed to be Demo-
-crati are not 60. Some time ago the atten-
tention of the nation was arrested by the
declaration of the Sun, that Jndge Reagan,
of Texas, was not a Democrat. The opinion
of both the Sun and Governor Hill has
been for some time decided to the effect that
President Cleveland is not a Democrat. Mr.
Scott's epistolary revelations recently made
establish the fact that while he may be
nominally a Democrat, he is really a corpor
ation man. "With Mr. Dana's addition to
the list, there is ground for fear that if the
.process of elimination keeps on, there will
'soon be no Democrats left.
The last election justified the belief that
the Democratic party was a little too small.
But the energetic way in which its members
are reading each other out of the party indi
cates their conviction that it is altogether
too large to suit them.
OLD MAIDS.
It was hardly to be expected that the will
of the Indiana man who left $3,000 to found
a home for old maids would be permitted to
stand. The court howled over the will, and
declared the testator to have been crazy. It
may comfort the old maids to think what a
very small home (3,000 would have built.
Everybody, including the elderly spinsters,
knows that it takes a pretty big home to
hold more than one old maid at a time. The
fact is, that old maids are not gregarious. If
tihey were fondof company they would not
be old maids, for we hold that no woman,
unless she be insane in mind or body, need
remain in singleness. In an eight-roomed
ilhouse, such as S3.000 might serve to build.
litis difficult to say exactly how many aged J
virgins micht be stowed. It it a question
for experts to decide.
But we do not appro re of encouraging
celibacy in the sex which shines eo brightly
and usefully in the matrimonial relation,
whether by three-thousand-dollar homes or
more substantial prises. Those who have
money to spars for such 'purposes had better
bestow it upon worthy wives and mothers,
or leave it to form a fund for the encourage
ment and reward of wifely virtues, or to en
dow an asylnm for widows. Not that the
spinster is altogether undeserving of assist
ance if she be needy, suoeor if sick, a home
if homeless; there is no sight in the world
more pitiable than a homeless, friendless old
maid, and none more provocative of charity.
But the old maid is too often a burden and a
disturbing element io be held np as a good
example to the rising generation. Pelicans
in the wilderness are well enough, but at the
fireside they are inconvenient and too picturesque.
A GOOD 6H0WINO.
"Water proves a more reliable liquid for
city revenue than whisky. The same fact
has often been observed in the respective
effect of the two fluids upon private revenue
and expenditure; but the result in munici
pal finances is notable and novel. In other
words, while the receipts of the city from
liquor licenses fall 23,000 below estimates,
the "Water Bureau more than makes up the
loss by an excess of receipts over estimates
of $75,000, and shows itself to be nearly self
sustaining. This is a good showing for the energetic
and business-like management of the "Water
Bureau; and justifies the faith of those who,
during long years of discouragement, mis
management, and even worse, held to the
belief that when run in accordance with
business principles, the water works could
be made to vindicate their existence. The
present state ot affairs demonstrates that
truth; the old chronic break-down of pump
ing engines a thing of the past; a clean and
adequate supply of water is furnished with
out interruption, and the public generally
are able to recognize that all the honest and
legitimate expenditure on the water works
was an excellent investment of the public
funds.
The satisfactory nature of the showing is
increased by the fact that when the city is
able to refund its 7 per cent water works
bonds which will probably not be before
the maturity of the bonds the revenue
from the water works will fully balance its
expenditure.
AIT IDEAL CONGRESS.
Suppose Congress were really able to do
something positively good for the people It
represents, that by some Providential dis
pensation it were endowed with supernatural
powers, for with merely natural powers
experience has taught us Congress can do
precious little, what an expectant, excited
nation would be fastening its eyes on "Wash
ington! Look at the single, simple, no complex,
item of the weather. THe Bepublican
majority would vote a dry, frosty winter for
us, with a seasonable snow storm about
Christmas, and enough of the soft and
beautiful to make pleasant sleighing till
1S90 would be a month or two old. This
done, of course a number of smaller bills
would have to be passed to provide
for the national needs in cold weather.
To cut legislation short, an omnibus
bill wonld be the thing; a bill
enacting that after such and such
a date every one should be well clothed,
lodged and fed. "What President would be
cranky enough to veto such a popular
measure, or what party headstrong enough
to oppose it? Then the Congressional
Record would be read in church as a part of
the services. It would be cheery reading,
too. And Congress being supernaturally
wise, wonld clear off the work post haste
and adjourn as soon as possible. Every
body would revere and love a Congressman
then, and even the candidates for the post
offices wonld have a kind word to say about
them.
But this is idle talk. Congress is the
same old human machine it always was.
"We must bear with it and be long suflering
and charitable toward it, for we are human,
too, prone to err, and to talk too much, and
to waste time, and squabble and fight about
trifles just like our selected and representa
tive wisdom in "Washington.
FATTEHIKG ON AIE.
A St. Louis physician has elaborated a
theory, based on the alleged tact that every
body is getting fat this year. This he ex
plains on the theory that this has been a veg
etable year, and the oxygen, nitrogen and
hydrogen being in almost equal proportion,
the people are all gaininir flesh on it. The
theory would seem to indicate that the allu
sion in "The Lady of Lyons" to the diffi
culty which a man would find in being a
chameleon and living on air is unnecessary.
The man might be expected to get fat over
it if the air was in right proportion.
But we are much more interested in the
act than in the theory. Is it trne that the
people are all getting fat? "We certainly
hope not An increase of healthy avoirdu
pois might be all right; but an epidemic of
adipose tissue would be much to he de
plored. Investigations might give different
ideas on the point; but we do not believe
that the coal miners of Spring Valley, 111.,
Brazil, Ind., or even np the Monongahela
river have observed any general increase of
fatness. Bank accounts may have swelled
somewhat; bnt the bank depositors up sbont
Lawrenceville will be apt to consider this
a lean year. Street car horses might have
got fat where their work has been under
taken by cable and electric motors; but so
far as their manifest presence in this city
shows, they are still a bony and angular
race.
"We fear that the St Louts scientist has
been founding his theories on one of the fat
women shows which form one of the leading
amusements of that cultured city. Else
where the increase of fat has not been visi
ble to the naked eye.
The declaration of the Bev. Howard

folk. Bnt another view is possible of it A

ple in other cities mages it assume the natnre
of an indorsement of the Cinclnnatlans, when
it is not alleged that they would plunge to the
bottom of that bottomless locality in order to
get hold of the dollars that have dropped in.

THE TOPICAL TALKER.
A Fllsbl With the Rooks Over American
River Hills, EnglUu Glades nnd Gar
dens, nnd Heme Again.
Somethwo was said in The Dispatch tho
other day about crows being good weather
prophets, bnt not half enough credit was given
them, Besides, (f I am not mistaken, the
writer meant rooks rather than crows. Rooks
are gregarious in their habits, living together
in colonies of hundreds, or even thousand:,
while crows prefer to have individual homes.
But rooks are called crows as often as not by
most people, and it Is their habit of foretelling
changes in the weather which has been so often
remarked.
There is a rookery among tho trees on a lofty
bluff above the Ohio river which has often
given me amusement to watch. The rooks
there, as tbelr fellows all over the world, per
form regular evolutions at daybreak and sun.
set and they are wont to move out to observe
the weather at any time of day when soma
warning Indiscernible to man of approacnjng
atmospheric change is at band. When you see
rooks wheeling slowly around and around In
the air, high above the (ops of the tallest trees
on a fine summer day, you may be certain that
a storm is approaching. And in a storm there
is no more sure sign of the weather clearing np
than these lofty gyrations of the crows.
The behavior and domestlo economy of
rooks have always seemed most interesting to
me. As a schoolboy I remember watching
them performing their morning exercises in a
great grove of elms in the park; a glimpse of
which could be had from our dormitory win
dows. They had a good deal better time than
I had, I used to think; free to fly where they
pleased, and safe from 'any danger moro for
midable than tne missiles hurled from slings
in theneigbboring playground, which a wall of a
height which in those days appeared to me stu
pendous I suppose it was IB feet high divided
from tho park. The old dowager to whom the
park and thefturreted house behind the elms
belonged was devoted to her rooks, and wonld
allow no one to harm thorn. No tender rook
lets came from that rookery to roost In pies.
Tom Hughes makes one of his characters in
Tom Brown's SchooldayB" tell how the rooks
in the Rugby school ground used to have call
ing over or prayers when the locsung-up bell
rang, and I remember how regularly the rooks
used to come borne from their foraging expedi
tions just as the sun was sinking every evening
when I was staying awhile two years ago
within sight of the historic trees in Lord North
brook's park, near Micbeldever. There must
have been a conple of thousand rooks
in that great rookery, and flying in regular
squadrons, with distancos properly preserved,
officers in front and on the flanks, they wonld
take ten minntes in passing over the old-fashioned
garden, where I was dividing my atten
tion between the landscape and a pipe of birds
eye.
Rooks Tho word recalls a hnndred pleasant
things to me. Abopso all gables; gables all
roses and honey suckles, or black satin-glossed
ivy; a house whose mellow red roof and
weather beaten chimneys rise from a nest ot
green toward a sky of softest sunniest bine and
clouds as white as the breast of tbe dove teeter
ing on the comb of the roof. And not only tbe
sight of the vine-wrapt honsa and the summer
sky, the beds of sweetwilliam and stocks, the
hollyhocks, like sentries, mounted by
the crazy gate, and the squares
of green and pasture land between
tbe bithermost hedge of box and ihe blue
green woods that close the picture in, but the
scent of tbe honeysuckles and tha mignonette,
the sound of an old skyo terrier whining wist
fully at my feet, the patter of beech nnt shells
two saucy squirrels are tossing to tho ground,
all come back to me, at no more potent sum
mons than a single word.
Why the millionaire with his princely cottage
in Florida or his hotel in Southern California,
his villa at Cannes, or what not, can't do better
than this. It takes days or weeks to get to
those delightful scenes, but one can look out
on treeless hills and cold gray skies in Alle
gheny county and then in a second, if imagina
tion and memory are willing, conjure up the
loveliest rural scenes, the warmest skies, and
all the odors and sounds tbe senses crave for.
ffOEK OP THE WOOL GEOWEKS.
Officer Elected and Plans Formed for the
Ensnlnc Yenr.
WAsnrscTox, December 6. At tbo wool
growers' convention to-day the National Wool
Growers' Association of the United States was
reorganized by tho adoption of a constitution
and the election of the following officers: Hon.
Columbus Delano, of Ohio, President; Hon. J.
T. Rich, of Michigan, Vice President; C. H.
Beall, of West Virginia, Treasurer; George H.
Wallace, of Missouri, Secretary, and Davis
Cossitt, of Ncvr York, Assistant Secretary. E.
N. Bissell, of Vermont W. L. Black; of Texas,
and John McDowell, of Pennsylvania, were
elected to act with tho officers of tbo asso
ciation as an executive board. Tbe committee
appointed to draft an address to tbe
wool growers of tbo United States hav
ing reported to tho convention that it
required additional time in which to prepare
the address a resolution was introduced and
adopted, granting further time and authorizing
tbe Executive Board to revise and publish tho
same at its earliest convenience. All matters
pertaining to legislation were by resolution re
ferred to a committee to bo hereafter desig
nated by tbe President One of tbe principal
subjects of discussion to-day was the under
valuation of so-called ring waste. It was
shown that during tho last year the importa
tion of this so-called wasto equaled the entire
wool clip of either Ohio or Texas; that it is
superior for nearly all wool manufacturing
purposes to tho finest scoured wool in this
country, and yer, it was said. It paid a duty
of only 10 cents a pound when it should
have paid, upon a proper and business classifi
cation, from 30 to 69 cents per pound.
It was stated that last year about 24,000,000
pounds of this wool was Imported principally
from Bradford, England, and sold in the mar
kets of this country at from 63 to 65 cents a
pound, whllo.in tho same markets, tine scoured
California wool sold at 63 cents per pound.
Quotations from the Philadelphia market were
read in support ot this assertion. It was also
stated that this fine grade wool was manipu
lated by machinery, before shipment especially
constructed, to coil it into small rings, in imita
tion of waste, for the sole purposo of evading
tbe law and avoiding tbe payment of just cus
toms duties. A committee, consisting of Messrs.
Lawrence, McDowell, Harpster, Cossitt and
Wallace, waited upon Secretary Wlndom this
afternoon and protested against the admission
of this so-called waste at a rate less than is
charged upon wool scheduled as partly manu
factored wool. The Secretary stated to the
committee that ho was then engaged in a
thorough investigation of this subject, and ho
assured them that full justice would be dono
tha wool-growing interests of theUnltea States.

will be held at Chicago on the second Wednes

MILLER fOE REFORM.
The First Keport of the New Attorney
General United Slates Courts Ham
pered by Outside Interference,
Washinoton, December 5. Tbe annual re
rcrt of Attorney General Miller wad made pub
lic to-day. During tbe year 2,287 civil salts and
H&sS criminal proiecoticris were terminated
and there gre cepSlpg S.f?0cObB former and.
7,E12 of tha latter class. Mr. Miller recommends
that prevision be made for a United States pen
itentiary and a United States reformatory, ihe
latter being intended for the confinement of
the milder class of criminals.
It is also urged itat a prison bureau ba estab
lished in the Department of Justice, where
conld be gathered, collated and recorded in a
permanent form the criminal statistics of tha
United States.
A Reform la Elections. ,
In a chapter on law business the Attorney
General says; ''Very soon after the 4th of
March last It was brought to my attention that
at the then recent Congressional elections
there were very numerous and far-rech(ng
violations of (he Federal laws relating to such
elections. It was charged that by intimidation
of voters, by seising and destroying ballot
boxes, by substitution of false ballots, by false
returns, by bribery of voters and election offi
cers, and by various other means well known
to those engaged in this nefarious business,
the popular will was stifled and falsified, and
retnms obtained wholly at variance, with what
would have been the result of a free and fair
vote honestly counted.
'In every case where such charges were
brought to the attention of this department,
instructions were given to the district attor
neys to investigate and prosecute to the utmost
of their power every person Implicated in such
violations of Federal laws, and I am happy to
be able to report that in a number or States such
prosecutions have been successful. A large
nnmber of indictments have been returned;
upon some of them, trials have been bad; In a
number of cases convictions have been ob
tained, and in some cases the culprits have
pleaded guilty and asked for mercy at the
hands of the Court
A Large Number of Cases.
"A large number of these cases are still
pending, and the instructions to the district
attorneys are still to push them to the end. It
is proper to say that in some cases the efforts
have been made. Some of them very recently,
to prevent and cripple these prosecutions, the
attempts to intimidate the marshal ffom
serving propesa and witnesses frpm giving tbefr
testimony, such intJmfdatf on going to the ex
tent of actual assassination, lint it must not
be supposed that hostility to tbe United States
Courts and United States officers is confined to
election matters.
njn ina contrary, tbo recoras oi tne uepart
mentof Justice shows that in some districts
tha civil proceedings of these courts, and
criminal prosecutions wholly disconnected
with the elective franchise cannot proceed be
cause the lives of necessary witnesses are in
snch danger that it would be Bimply inhuman
to enforce their attendanqe and the giving of
their testimony; while the evidence is abundant
that in certain localities no occupation is so
dangerous as a faithful performance of d uty by
United States Marshals.
"Of coarse such lawlessness cannot be toler
ated. In every caso the instructions to prose
cute have been coupled with the assurance
that no means within tbe power of this depart
ment will be spared to protect officers and wit.
nessesin the discharge of their duties, and iq
bring to ounishment every man who illegally
attempts to thwart Such prosecutions."
Somo Changes Necessary.
Tbe Attorney General speaks of the Im
portance of same changes in the judicial sys
tem which will enable the courts, and especial
ly the Supreme Court to dispose of accumu
lated business, and in this connection calls
particular attention to the "Davis bill," which
was fully set forth in the report of bis prede
cessor for 1885.
Tho Attorney General calls attention to the
fact that the court In Oklahoma, tbe pourtin
the Western district of Arkansas and the court
recently provided for at Paris, Tex., require an
expenditure of money. In the payment of wit
nesses, that very largely depletes tha appro
priation made by Congress for that purpose,
and he says that tbe demands of these three
courts aro such that if they are mettberesnlt
will be a very large deficiency, or else the
conrts m other districts will be obliged to stop
for want of funds.
In view of these f lets the estimate for the
payment of witnesses for the next year has
been made in tbe sum of 51,000,000 Instead of
5300,000, appropriated for the current year.

Anna Swlptdnv who conducted the celebrated
SIB baby swindle, were engaged to-day to ap
pear all winter rn a Bowery dime museum. Tbo
manager of another museum tried to engage
them for his establishment to-day, and Was so
anxious to forestall all competitors that ha
waited for them at the door of thi court room,
a friend having given htm a tip that they would
ba discharged. Mrs, Swinton, however, upset
his plans by fainting as soon as she was set free,
and getting sa upset that talking basines was
out of tbe question. Whan her called upon
her this afternoon sua hid already agreed to be
the "freak"' of the manager's rival. Josh Mann
refused at first to be Mrs. Swhrson's- com
panion freak, but was won over by the man
ager's offer to -'pay him more than a Congress,
man got." The competition for Mann's and
Mrs. Hwln ton's services is explained by the fact
that a dlmo museum manager mads his fortune
immediately after tbe Atlantic City scandal by
exhibiting Nuris Donnelly, the woman Eva
stabbed. Mr. Dana at Done Again. '
Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Dana returned home

Tho Italian Rioters a Coarr.
All the survivors of yesterday's bloody Italian
riot in James street were to-day marched into
tha Tombs police court They were as dirty
and worthless a lot as has been in tha dingy
court room for many months. Asanto Boento,
the woman who killed Amelia Verallo, was the.
most prominent prisoner. All tha prisoners
testified a? length, and told snch conflicting
stories that it was difficult to make up a com.
plaint Tbe principal witness was Antonia
Verallo, the 7-year-pld child of the murdered
woman, who told the clearest story of the
tragedy. She saw Mrs. Bocuto fire two shots
at her mother. Mrs, Bocuto was committed to
the custody of the Coroner.

in saying anything," he said; "all that could be

Recorder ordered the prisoners remanded for
sentence. They have been in prison since

tried on tbe same charge and convicted. Mrs.

bodies disinterred was that of a 12-year-old boy,

When the lid was removed, the body was
