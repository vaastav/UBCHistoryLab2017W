JUST A FIT OF "TEMPER"
Governor Withycombe has refused to pay the bonus
promised ex-Superintendent Crawford of the prison flax
plant, if he made a financial profit of the business. As
governor of the state, and as such being in charge of the
flax plant, he is quite within his rights and certainly is
only doing his duty if he actually believes what he says,
that Mr. Crawford has not made good. That he does not
believe it is shown by his admission that, leaving the seed
out of the calculation, that there is still a profit of $4,188,
and by his offer to pay him $400.
The governor goes out of his way to assert that Mr.
Crawford's predecessor grew the crop and intimates that
he should have credit for the value of the seed, and that
Crawford should not. The governor knows better than
this. Mr. Crawford's predecessor did not grow the crop
of flax from which the seed was produced, lhat crop
was crown under contract by farmers. The state had
absolutely nothing to do with the growing of it other than
to furnish the seed for planting. The state had nothing
whatever to do with the crop untli its harvesting began.
Mr. Crawford took charge in August and every bit of
work done on the crop was under his direction. He
harvested the crop, threshed, cleaned and sacked the seed,
put the straw in the sheds and did whatever else was done
to or about the crop by the state. " .
However leaving out the flax seed Mr. Crawford's
statement, which he says is checked up with the figures
of the board of control, shows cash on hand $10,668.07, or
$114.51 more than enough to repay the money loaned by
the legislature. It shows the sum of $2,091.40 due from
material sold. It shows improvements, paid for by Craw
ford from sales, improvements, sacks on hand, lumber,
twine, etc., amounting to $6,315.08. It shows fiber and
tow baled and ready for market valued at $5,681.60. There
is retted straw ready to manufacture valued at $15,250.
There is unrettcd straw, threshed and bundled ready for
rettiffg valued at $10,400. Besides these and other items
there are 90 tons of straw in the sheds harvested and paid
fflr by Crawford and which cost $1,980.
Yet his excellency the 'governor, inppanuy remancs
that he has figures which show "he, is lucky if he breaks
even." ,
The governor admits there is a profit of $4,188, but inti
mates this profit will vanish under the manipulations of
his pencil. No doubt unassited and unchecked, the gov
ernor might reach this solution, but we doubt anyone else
doing so. He could reach it easily as he counts the labor
and "time" that will be required to manufacture the "250
tons of straw" he says are on hand, but does not count the
value of the finished product from it.
The governor admits he does not like Crawford and
did not want to make a contract with him. There is the
whole reason for the gubernatorial dispaly of childish
temper.

i'lood had read to the house an inter
view of yesterday with Bulgarian Min

asked that the president's message to
congress be transmitted to his country.
He said there were particularly strong
reasons why the United States should
remain on friendly terms with Bulgaria,
"Hello, Margaret I I find I have miss

"There is no 'But' about itt I ean't

I wept until I had a horrible head

to think. Should I tell Bob of what

ledge without telling I had followed
him. He would be angry perhaps worse
disgusted, and that I feared far more
than his anger.
I finally decided that I would not
let him know I had seen him, or knew
anything of the party. I would ques

me.
Without warning there leaped into
my mind the telephone call. The worn

The home garden movement last summer is estimated
to have produced foodstuffs of the value of $;50,000,000.
That the same plan will bring a much larger return the
coming season is reasonably certain. Many who had
never tried gardening found it not only a pleasant recrea
tion, but a healthful one, and their experience last sum
mer will cause them to take hold with renewed vigor next
season; There is no good reason why the gardens next
year should not produce an even billion dollars worth of
foodstuffs, or enough to pay the interest on a twenty bil
lion dollar war loan.
An increase of a million and a third dollars in the banks

ing it wss a j-ear of light crops and heavy car-shortage.
With the situation reversed the banks could not hold the

Washington, Dec. 0. The resolution
calling for a declaration of a state of
war against Austria was favorably re
ported to the house by the foreign rela
tions committeo today.
"The state of war "between the Unit
ed States and Austria has been "an
actual fact for many months." tho com
mittee's report declared, "and very
little readjustment of affairs," be
tween the countries will therefore bo
involved.
"Deportations of American lives and
rights by Austrian naval forces has
1'jvn small, compared with those of !
Germany, but they have been indulged
in in an extent to constitute war on
tliia couui.ry," the report declared.

Austrian resolution, urged that Turkey
aud Bulgaria be included.
lie scouted the idea that by with
holding such action the United States
miglit "wean these countries from Ger
many." 1 ' The presence of the Bulgarian and
Turkish representatives in Washington
is II menace," Miller declared. "Many
adliel diplomats feel this. Information
of our affairs is daily reaching Berlin
How, .1 shall not attempt to say.
"The Turkish sultan belongs on tho
bosom of the German knitter," Miller
shouted. "The Turks must live or die
with Germany. I hope they die with
her."
Miller charged that failuro of the
I'nitod States to get supplies and funds
and war materials to Italy for months
resulted from the fact thnt this coun
try was not at war with Austria. Much
of the Italian disaster may bo charged
against the I'nited States, ho said.
"We cannot hope to separate Bulgar
ia nmt Turkey from Germany and Aus
tria except bv force of arms," said Mil
ler. "We must throw away these intel
lectual theories and go in wholehearted
ly with our allies in common cause
against the enemy."
'Miller, while emphatically demand
ing war on Bulgaria and Turkey, de
clared his willingness to accept the
president 's decision. He was repeatedly
applauded throughout his address.
Possible Intimation that the adminis
tration's counsel against an immediate
declaration again Bulgaria and Turkey
is ill reality n play for time until Am
ericans in these countries can leave if
(war should ultimately be deemed advis
able, was g-veu hr Kepresentative
I'lood, chairman of the house foreign
relations committee, who took the floor
after Miller.
"A great number of Americans
would be in great danger should the
I'nited States declare war on 'Turkey
at this time. If we are to declare war
we must at least give them time to get
out." he said.
At 1h same time, enumor?,ting rea

what was her name.
I bathed my eyes for an hour before
I dared lie down. Had I done so with

the next day. As it was Delia was sym

shouldn't she .take the babies out when
she finished her breakfast dishes, so I

I agreed. I had looked into the mir

happier.

Now I had an excuse for my paleness,
