WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1873
Bourbonisni.
Not the kind which takes its Dame from
the celebrated county of Kentucky, but the
find that lives and learns nothing. Cham
bord is not to-day the best representative of
it ; bound up by traditional cob-webs, he
did not perceive the temper of the French
nation, but he had the excuse that he had
been for years an exile. The Democratic
representatives went up to vVasbington last
week, and coming straight from among the
people, performed an act that needs to be
understood to be appreciated.
Democratic newspapers and Democratic
conventions have denounced the salary grab
as specially the work of the republican party
Some of them have in an outspoken manner
denounced members of their own party who
voted for the bill. The odium of the act
has, however, been cast mainly upon the
party in power. This was all ri;ht: when
a party is in a large majority in Congress, it
ought to be held responsible for lezishtion.
A large part of the criticism of the Demo
cratic press hae been foaming at the mouth
about republican corruption ; the words of
independent republicans have been seized
upon as proofs that nearly everything was
rotten m the ruling party. Men who de
plored the acts of republican members of
Longrcs3, are told that there is no reform
possible within the party; that'the only way
out of our difficulties is to walk in at the
ever open doors of the unterrified and pure-
minded democracy.
The argument has been, " the representa
tives of a party must be taken toba the party ;
toe men it elects to office arc its spokesmen
and exemplars; behold Credit Mobilier,
look at the Salary Grab, and see what your
boasted republican organization has come
to. And there was force in the suggestion.
If pra-tices that have obtained among many
representative men were to be continued,
and the men themselves kept in powsr by
party machinery, then the republican party
had nearly outlived its usefulness.
The resolutions of republican conventions
were treated as mere baits by the democracy,
and for pure and cutting denunciation of the
salary bill, the resolutions of democratic'
conventions were uisiirpassed. When Con
gress came together it was seen at once that
such resolutions were deemed by the repre
sentative men of the national democracy to
be put up to deceive, not the elect, but un
suspecting voters.
Straightway coming together in caucus,
these men nominated Fernando Wood for
Speaker; a salary grabber, and this after all
one of the few comparatively meritorious
roles which he has played in life. Tried by
the same standards which they have been
applying to the republican party for the last
few months, with what show of fairness can
the democracy appear as a party of retrench
ment, as a party that rebukes wrong doing
in high places ?
That this blunder is one of the worst in
the loDg line of highly loolish actions which
the democratic party has been guilty of, is
admitted by many honest journals in its own
interest. And the danger from it to the
party success which was seen coming :n the
near future, lies where the danger to that
party has always been for the last twenty
years in critical periods. It is this, that
every now and then this old organization
shows its true character. Figuratively and
truthfully speaking, it preaches well and
prays well, but it will get drunk ; and then
comes truth.
If the reform3d Tammany Hall sachems
like Tilden could get control of the machine
ry throughout the Union ; if the democratic
press could beat honesty into the heads of
the leaders, and sense into the heads of the
led, there might be some hope that in some
future time such performances as that in
ne congressional caucus would become im
T l m.
pueMuie. iiiere arc honest men .nm,,h ;
the democratic party, and such are no cTouot
pained at the action of their renrescntativr.
For they cannot invite mcn.who do not realty
iifce all the food set out by their own eojk
to sit at their table, served as it is with stale
pieces of the grab.
It lie Cuban Affair.
The dispatches of the last four weeks have
a great resemblance to some that are not yet
wholly forgotten which used to be current
in war times, lhe news of to-day disputed
by that of to-morrow, and the news of to
morrow not to bo believed till that of the
next day was at hand. The erjidemic of It-
A. -
ing has broken out in as violent a manifesta
tion as we remember to have seen.
The number of persons executed after the
killing of the four generals was forty-nine,
malting fitty-three in all. There remain at
Santiago de Cuba one hundred and two of
the persons captured on board the steamer
So it seems that two thirds of the crisOners
a.
are yet living, whereas the reports of the first
lew days Ie!t but a dozen that had not per
ished.
The last week has given us a new supply
of sensational dispatches on this subiect.
The inhabitants of Havana were greatly ex
cised in mind over the terms of the protocol
by which the virginius was to be surrender
ed to the United States. The Car tain-Gen
eral, Jouvellar, issued a proclamation coun
seling moderation. The next heard was the
text of a dispatch in which Jouvellar resign
ed his position and requested a new govern,
or appointed. Following this was the state
ment that the volunteers never would give
up the Virginius.
The feeling in Havana is indeed intense
on the subject, but the Castelar government
has not yet received any proof that its de
crees will not be obeyed in Cuba. The Vir
ginius is now said to be lying in Havana har
bor under protection of the guns of the Span
ish Navy and there is not any disturbance
lookei for that will prevent her delivery.
Zueluta, president of the Casino Esnanal.
and the representative man of the violent
siavetioiaing interest, advises that course.
Jouvellar has had no thought tf resigning.
Minister Sickles is 6aid to have resinned
his position of embassador at Madrid. The
troubles which led to this have been not so
much with Spain as with the American Sec
retary of State. Mr. Fish has seen fit to
communicate too directly with the Spanish
government to suit the notions that Sickles
has of what is due to him. The dignity of
his office or of himself will not permit any
talk between the high contracting parties
that is not carried on, as to the Yankee of it,
by his agency.
There is some excitement in Spain as well
as in Cuba relative to the position taken by
Castelar and his ministers. Castelar is ac
cused of pandering to the United States, and
no doubt the Virginius aff.iir will injure his
influence at home for a time. His presiden
cy has so far saved the two countries from a
war. it has done this at nc expense of dis
honor to his own country but in pursuit of a
liberal statesmanship.
The situation may be to-day summed ur
by saying that notwithstanding the conflict
ing rumors of the week there is no reason to
suppose that the terms of the protocol will not
be carried out.
Thj Message. President Grant's commu
nication to Congress at their meeting has
met ine approval of the country. There are
parts of it that are criticised, but as a whole
it is regarded as a common 6ense document.
The financial question he discusses to some
extent, and is evidently anxious for a return
to specie payments, but a few of.his senten
ces look as though he was thinking about
running back a few steps "to getagjoJ
start" His wish that the nation shall have
a worthy capital will not necessarily need
'or its accomplishment that the several States
go into house-building enterprises there.
Neither will the Great American Desert "
be made to blossom like the rose, oy irriga
tion just yet.' The message shows that The
administration endeavors to carry on the
government as a business man would con
duct t ny important interest ; of course mis
takes are sometimes made, but on the whole
things are going very well.
Hon. George U. Willums, whose name
the president last week sent into the Sen
ate for Chief Justice, was born in Columbia
county, New York, March 23d, 1823, of
parents who moved from Pittsfield. Mass.,
received an academical education; studied
law; removed to Iowa in '44; three years
later was elected district Judge; received
and accepted an appointment as territorial
chief-justice in '53 ; sat in the Oregon con
stitutional convention ; and was elected to
the United States Senate in !5. His later
record is as attorney general of the United
States.
Mr. Edmunds and several other prominent
senators, are understood to be opposed to his
confirmation. He is said, by all, to be an
honest gentleman of fair ability with " pos
sibilities " in him, but his late conduct of
the Credit Mobilier suits, did not ,
Connectiflut people a very high opinion of
mo taieuia us a lawyer or orator.
But it isn't every one that can satisfy the
critic's eye in the land of wooden nutmeg.

Tin Ocean D sajtkr. Capt. Suruunt of
the Ville du Havre blames thesacoud officer,
Lieut. Anduvand, for the collision with the
Loch Earn. The lights of the latter vessel
were seen some minutes before the disister.
She being a sailing vessel kept on her course
as was proper, but the steamer was so man
aged as to get directly in her path. The
lieutenant committed suicide seeing the
trouble he had brought upon the ship.
The Loeb. Eirn wajj bo badly iD-jurcd thut,
on the2'Jth, when she fell in with the Brit
ish yueen, her crew were transferred. Tac
Loch Earn was in a sinking condition, ami
the British Queen brought her crew into
port at Plymouth, England, on the 7th.
The captain of the Loch Earn makes the
following statement of facts attending the
collision with the Ville du Havre: He says
that after first sighting the steamer and tee
ing that she was coming dangerously near,
he rang the ship's bell and put his helm
bird aport. The helm of the steamer was
put to starboard, but the steamer came ri'ht

thought Congress should take advantage of
the present circumstances to return tn tnnpio

obstacles to free banking would be removed
by a return to specie payments. Ho favored
the plan instructing the secretary of the

The House considered the case of another

far, and it is not probable that the future
discussion of the important question he con
sidered will draw;out anything that will at
tract more attention than what he said last
Wednesday. The Senator's effort meets the
approbation of men of all parties, and the
democratic press speak as highly of it as do
the republican. We give elsewhere an arti
cle from the Boston Globe, which shows
what leading republican papers say of it.
ine Tale bavins Service of the United
States Government has gradually grown to
De a considerable branch of the various in
terests confided to the Treasury Department.
It is in its infancy, as compared with the
admirable systems which have girdled the
British Isles with life-savingstations. shelters
and apparatus. The Report of the Chief of
the Bureau exhibits a frightful number of
wrecks that have occurred on the limited
coast-line covered by the operations of the
service : out it also shows the beinninf of
greater things .- and, among the numerous
governmental institutions that claim the
fostering care of Congress, few have so pa
thetic and touching an interest as this which
cares for the lives and property of those who
navigate our rock-bound coasts.
Richard Yates, the " war governor " of
Illinois, died suddenly in St. Louis on the
1st. Mr. Kates was a native of Kentueiv
He was first elected to Congress as member
of the House of Representatives from Illinois
in iooi, ana retained his seat until 1355.
In 1861 he was chosen Gov. of Illinois fur
four years, and in 18C5 he was elemd tn tw
United States Senate, his term expiring in
1871. Since he left the Senate he has not
figured prominently in public life. Mr.
l ates was a man of ability and commanding
presence, lie was celebrated in his own
state as an effective speaker and known as a
genial man. His love of good fellowship ran
into a love of drink and he became a merp
drunkard, trying at times to rid himself of
the nabit but ever tailing. He had lately
oeen engaged in railroad enterprises.

evening at the room of Gen. Gordnn tn

the vacant Louinana Senatorship. Senator
West appears as the counsel for Gnv. Pinh.
back, and Gen. McMillan speaks for himself.
Lach contestant has a delegation of fripnria
at work outside of the committee, and there
is a third delegation from Louisiana which
urges the setting aside of both Pinchbaek
aud McMillan, and the ordering of a new
election in the House.
Ihe Committees. Speaker Blaine has
made up his committees as found elsewhere.
The list meets with general approbation as
being a pretty good selection. The Speaker
has made many changes, transferring men
from committees with whose duties thev were
tamiliar to others of about like importance
This, though it mny prove a good way to get
nsw ideas ou some questions, promises to
have the effect of rather retarding the work
of the House.
We 6ce th3 make up of the committee on
the Reform of the Civil Service commented
upon in the daily papers quit; fully. Mr
Kellogg of Connecticut, is chairman, and
Mr. Willard 6econd. Butler is on thr
mittee, and it seems to be made up in the
interests ol the old doctrine of " to the vie
tors belong the spoils." The plan is proba.
bly to continue the system of dispensing offi
cial sops to " working " constituents. This
beingthecasc.it is certainly as well that
the chairmanship went to a man whose inter
est in the proposed reform seems to be suf
ficiently small to qualify him for the place.
lue .free Press thinks that Mr. Willard
will have work enough to do on four com
mittees. Wedou t know how it is. but ere
sumeMr. Willard of Michigan will not shirk
his duties on two of those committees. Well,
the population of the ' pleasant peninsula"
lying to the north-west of Ohio has grown
so fast that we can't blame the Free Press
for not keeping track ot all the families out
there, and knowing whether aay of :hem
have been sent to Congress or not.

They therefore have undertaken to regulate
