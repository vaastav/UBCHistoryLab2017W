251,680,914. These figures show that
our country may be as populous as Eu
rope now is, at some point between 1920
and 1930, say about 1925 our territory,
at 7.ni persons to the square mile, being
of the capacity to contain 217,lo,OiJt,
and we will reach this, too, if we do not
ourselves reliimnish the chances bv the
folly and evils of disunion, or by long this plan, the recommendation that Con
and exhausting war, springing from the gress provide by law for compensating
onlv great element of national discord any State which may adopt cmancipa
among us. While it cannot be exactly tinn before this plan shall have been

doubt that the extent of it would be very
great and injurious.
The proposed emancipation would
shorten the war. nernetuate peace, in-
sure this increase of the population and .
proportionately of the wealth of the
country. With this we should pay all
the emancipation would cost, together
with our other debts, easier than we
tdiould pay our other debts without it. If
we had allowed our old national debt to
run at 6 per cent, per annum, simple in
terest, frcm the end of our Revolution
ary struggle till to-day without pay
ing anything on either principal or in
terest, each man of us would owe less
upon that debt now than each man owed
upon it then, and this because our in
crease of men through the whole period
has been greater than 6 jcr cent, and
has run faster than the interest upon the
debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor
nation so long as its population increases
faster than unpaid interest accumulates
on its debt. This fact would be no ex
cuse for delaying the payment of what is
justly due, but it shows the great import
ance of time in this connection, the great
advantage of a policy by which we shall
not have to pay until we number a hun-
dred millions, what by a different policy
we should have to pay now, when the i
number is but 31,000,000. In a word, it j
shows that a dollar will be much harder i
to par for the war than will be a dollar
. . . . , Ill
for emancipation ou the proposed plan
and then the latter will cost no blood;
no precious life. It will be a saving of
both.
As to the second article, I think it
would be impracticable to return to
bondage the class of jcrson3 therein con
templated. Some of them doubtless, in
a property sense, belong to loyal owuers,
and hence provision is made in this arti
cle for compensating such.
The third article relates to the future
of the freed people. It does not oblige,
but merely authorizes Congress to aid in
colonizing such as may consent. This
ought not to be regarded as objeetiona- .
tile on the one hand or on the other, in
somuch as it comes to nothing unless by
mi, t ml consent of the people to be de
ported and the American voters, through
their representatives in Congress.
I cannot make it better known than it
already is that I strongly favor coloniza
tion, and yet I wish to say there is an
objection urged against the colored per
sons remaining in the country which is.
largely imaginary, if not sometimes ma
licious. It is insisted that their pres
ence would injure and displace white
labor and white laborers. If there ever
could be a proper time for mere argu
ments, that tirau surely is not now. In
times like the present men should utter
nothing for which they would not will
ingly be responsible through time and
eternity.
Is it true, then, that colored people
can displace any more white labor by
being free than remaining slaves'.' If
they stay in their old places, they jostle
no white laborers. If they leave their
old places, they leave tin m open to white
laborers. Logically, there is neither
more nor les of it. Emancipation, even,
without deportation, would probably en
hance the wages of white labor, and very
surely would not reduce them. Thus the
customary amount of labor would still
have to be performed. The freed people
would surely not do more than their old
proportion -of it, and very probably, for
ft time, would do less, leaving an in
creased part to white laborers, bringing
their labor into greater demand, and
consequently enhancing the wages of it.
With deportation, even to a limited ex
tent, enhancing wages to white labor is
mathematically certain. Labor is like
any other commodity in the market; in
crease the demand for it, and yon in
crease the price of it. Reduce the sup
ply of black labor by colonizing the
black laborers out of the country, and
by precisely so much you increase the
demand of, and wages for, white labor.
Iiut, it is dreaded that the freed people
will swaim forth atid cover the whole
land. Are they not illicitly in the land?
Will liberation make them any more nu
merous ?KqualIy distributed among the
whites of the whole country, there would
be but one colored to seven whites.
Could the one ill anyway greatly disturb
the seven?
There are many communities now hav
ing more than one free colored person to
seven whites, and this without any appa
rent consciousness of evil from it. The
District of Columbia, and the States of
Maryland and Delaware, are all in this
condition. The District has more than
one free colored person to six whites;
ami yet in i:s frequent petitions to Con
gress, I believe it has never presented the
presence of free colored persons as one
of its grievances.
Hut why should emancipation South
send the freed people North? People of
any color sel.lt m run unless there be
something to run from. Heretofore, col
ored people to some extent have fled .
North from liondage, and now perhaps
from both bondage and destitution; but
if gradual emancipation or deportation '
be adopted, thev will have neither to tlee
from. Their old masters will give them
wages, at least until new laborers can be
procured, and the freed men in turn will
gladly give their labor for the wages till
new homes can be found for them in con
genial climes and with people of their
own blood aud race.
This proposition can be trusted to the
mutual interests involved, and, in any
event, cannot the North decide for itself
whether to receive them? Again, as
practice proves more than theory in any
case, has there been any irruption of
colored people Northwurd because of the
.iliolL-lmieiit of slavery in this District
last spring?
What I have said of the proportion of
free colored persons to the whites in the
I District is from the Census of 1S60, hav
ing no reference to persons called con
. trabands, nor. to those made free by the
. Act of Congress abolishing slavery here.
The plan consisting of these articles i.i
: recommended, not but that a restoration
i of the national authority would be ac
' cepted without its adoption, nor that the
war, not the proceedings under the
! proclamation of September 22d, 186
will be stavod because of the recommcn
, dation of lias plan. Its timely adoption,
I doubt not, would bring restoration, and
therebv stay both. And notwithstanding
This plan Is recommended as a means,
not in exclusion of but additional to, all
others for restoring and preserving the
national authority throughout the Union.
The plan would, 1 am confident, secure
peace more speedily than can be done
by force alone, while it would cost less,
considering amounts aud manner of pay
ment, and times of payment, and the
amounts would be easier paid than will
be the additional cost of the war, if wc
rely solely upon force.
It is most likely very likely that it
would cost no blood at all. The plan is
proposed as permanent constitutional
law. It can not become such without the
concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Con
gress, and afterward three-fourths of the
Stnt.'K. The requisite three fourths of the
States will necessarily include seven of
the Slave Spites. Their concurrence, if
obtained, will give assurance of their
severally adopting emancipation at no
distant day upon the new constitutional
terms. This assurance would end the
struggle now and save the Union forever.
I do not forget the gravity which
should characterize a paper addressed to
the Congress of the nation by the Lliiet
Magistrate of the nation; nor do I forgot
that some of you are my seniors, nor that
many oi you nave more experience uh
I in the conduct of public affairs; yet I
trust that, in view of the great rcsponsi-
i i:
bility resting upon me, you will perceive
no want of respect to yourselves in any
undo earnestness I may seem to display.
Is it doubted, then, that the plan
I propose, if adopted, would shorten the
war, and thus lessen its expenditure of
money and of blood? Is it doubted that
it would restore the national autho-ity
and national prosperity, and perpetuate
both indefinitely?
Is it doubted that we here, Congress
and Executive, can secure its adoption?
Will not the good people respond to a
united and earnest appeal from us? Can
we, can they, by any other means, so cer
tainly or so speedily assure these vital
objects? We can succeed only by con
cert. It is not, ' lan any ot as imagine
better," but " Can we all do better?"
Object, wheresoever it is possible, still the
question recurs, ''Can wc do better?"
The dogmas of the quiet past are in
adequate to the stormy present. The
occasion is piled high with dilliculties,
and we must rise with the occasion. As
our case is new, so we must think anew,
and act anew. We must disenthrall
ourselves, and then wc shall save our
country.
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape his
tory. We of this Congress will be re
membered in spite of ourselves. No
personal significance or insinilicancc
can spare one or another of us. The
fiery trinl through which we pass will
light us down in honor or dishonor to the
latest generation.
We say that we are for the Union.
The worltl.will not forget that while we
say this, we do know how to save the
Union. The world knows we do know
how to save it. We, even we here, hold
the poner, and bear the responsibility.
In piving freedom to the slave, wc as
sure freedom to the free, honorable alike
in what we give and what we preserve.
We shall nobly save or meanly lose
the last, best hope of the earth..
Other means may succeed. This
could noi tail.
The way is plain peaceful generous
just a way which, if followed, the
world will forever applaud, and God
must forever bless.

Patent Pipe.
PATENTED Jan. 21st, 1862.
Requires only a trial to prove Its incomparable
superiority to any other Hi now in use. It may
be ruck d without ANT PKLKTaaaua OB fKPI.K
AST Ki rrnw, as the oil of tohacoo Is not drawn into
the mouth and the tongue does not lieecm furred
or coat,-.! from inhaling ite jKiisonous properties.
The ltowl is made of the aneat Devonshire Clay, mid
giv.s to 1 Ite tobacco a peculiarly pleaaant fra
grance. The tobacco cannot r.ooir Msy). as in
ordinary pipes, because the drip beneath receives
tbeaaliva that uarnsibly escapes into the stem;
henoo the pijie never he omes onenaiv ly rank, and
the br at h of th aamk r doea not proclaim to every
me uemictt that he has been "tpMalgiatg in a
pipe."
. A hen the bow l become clogged, or the drip be
neath requires cleansing, the piic may I taken
apart bv removing the riui. The clav bowl may at
any time lie restored to Its original whiteness by
burning iu the Are. (first dryinglt thoroughly,) or
anew Iwtwl may lie procured of the dealer.

profits and strict attention to business, to merit
