nally 'lliistrute the impolicy of en

the present adininslratioii the existing
government of Hawaii was stiddenb
overthrown and a treaty of annexa

l ulled Stales and submitted to the
senate for ratification. The treaty was
subsequently withdrawn for examina
tion and lion. James 11. Blount, of
Heorgia, was despatched to Honolulu
as a special commissioner to make im
partial investigation. After a thorough
• vainination Mr. Blount submitted a
report showing beyond all question
'hat the constitutional government had
Is-eu subverted with the active aid of
our representative to that government
nd through the intimidation caused
by the presence ot an armed naval
force of the United States which landed
for the purpose at the Instance of our

seemed that the only honorable course
for our government to pursue was to
undo the wrong done by those repre

the expenditures s 155.121,dd0. resulting
in a deficiency of S'JS.tHHi.ObO.
The recent repeal of the provision
pp| law requiring the purchase of silver
bullion by the government as a feature

entire change in the complexion of our
eiirrem-y alTalrs, "It is impossible Op

legislation may appear to be essential
or expedient,” says the president.

pursuit of this object wp- should re

pediem-y. determined to be content
with nothing less than a lasling and
’comprehensive financial phut. In these
■circumstances a ivascnanle delay in
dealing with tie- snbjc.l, instead of be
ing injurious, x/ill ncrease probably
wise action. The considerations just
stated and the fact that a definite pro
position from us seemed to be expi-cted
upon the reassembling of the Brussels
monetary conference led to an expres
sioii of willingness to have the ad
journed meeting which was t have
met November .’id, still further post
poned. It would be wise to give gin
oral authority to flic president to in
vile other nations to such conference
at any time when there should be fair
prospects of accomplishing an interna
tional agreement upon the subject of
coinage.
The wisdom of amending existing
statutes iu regard lo the issuance of
government In mis is suggested, as the
authority now vested in the secretary
ul the treasury for the purpose is not
as clear -is it should be and the bunds
authorized are disadvantageous to the
government both as to the lime of their
maturity and the rate of interest.
A more general and harmonious sys
tem of national quarantine than now
i xists would add greatly to the safety
of our people.
THE FEE SYSTEM,
I The proposition of the attorney gen
■ oral, that the fee system as applieahi
to the compensation of United Stales
attorneys, marshals, clerks of the feder
;tl court and United States eoininissiou
! ers should be abolished with as little
delay as possible, is heartily endorsed.
|lf another form were inaugurated
. which would give to United Slates com
missioiicrs the final disposition of petty
| offenses iu the grade of misdemeanors,
especially those coming under the in
i let-mil revenue laws, a great advance
would be made toward a dt-cent admin

OTHER HKI’ART.M ENTS.
| The postottice deileleiicy would dis
iippear or be immensely decreased if
less ma I ter was curried through the
mails, an item of which is upwards of
; three hundred tons of seeds and grain
from the agricultural department, fctpe
, elal iittentlou is culled to the sugges
tions of the postmaster general ielating
to a more sensible and business-like
organization and a better distribution
of responsibility in his department.
The report of the secretary of the
navy is reviewed at length and special
attention is invited to his reeommenda
, lions. While distinctly favoring the
policy of building up a thorough and
; efficient navy the president cannot te
rrain from suggesting that congress
, should carefully take into account the
number of unfinished vessels on our
hands ami the depleted condition of
i the treasury in considering tin* proprle
, ty of appropriations at this time to be
gin new work.
The report of the secretary of the in
ferior is likewise reviewed at length
and the recommendations endorsed.
PENSIONS AND LANDS.
The discovery having been made that
many names had been put upon the
pension rolls by means of which whole
sale and gigantic frauds have been
perpetrated, the commissioner suspend
's! payments upon a number of pen
sions which seemed *o lie fraudulent
or unauthorized pending a complete
examination, giving noth’- to pension
ers in order that they might have an
opportunity to establish if possible the
justice of their claims not withstanding
their apparent invalidity. Those who
attempt in the line of duty to rectify
these wrongs should not be accused of
enmity or indifference to the claims
of honest veterans, says Mr. Cleve
land.
The vast area of land which but a
short time ago constituted the public
domain is rapidly falling into private
hands, The beneficent intention of the
government to supply homes to indus
trious and worthy home-seekers should
not be executed through the speculator
who stands with extortionate purpose
between the land office and those who
with families are invited by the gov
ernment to settle on the public lands.
These outrageous incidents ■ cannot be
‘entirely prevent,si without a change in
the laws on the subject and the recom
mendations of tlie secretary of (be in
terior on litis point are especially in
dorsed.
The time will ,suite, says the presi
dent. when efficient measures should
be taken for the preservation of ottr
forest. The report of the secretary of
agriculture is reviewed and indorsed.
Surely it never could have entered the
minds of those tvht tirst sanctioned
.•in appropriation of public money for
the purchase of new and improved
varieties of seeds for gratuitous dis
tribution that from this would grow
tin* large appropriations for the pur
chase and distribution by members of
congress of ordinary s,*eds. bullis and
cuttings which everywhere are easily
obtainable at low prices. Vet the in
discriminate and wasteful distribution
by legislation and legislators contin
ues, answering no purpose unless it be
to remind constituents that their repre
sentative is willing to remember them
with gratitude at public cost.
The continued and intelligent execu
tion of the civil service law and the
increasing approval ~y the pimple of
it- operations are most gratifying.
Economy in public expenditure is a
; duty that cannot innocently be neg
lected by those intrusted with the con
trol of money drawn from people for
public uses. At this time when a de
pleted treasury confronts us. when
many of our people are engaged in a
hard struggle for the necessities of
life, and when forced eneoaomy Is
pressing upon tlie great mass of our
countrymen, 1 desire lo urge with all
the earnestness at my command that
1 congressional legislation be so limited
by strict economy as Is consistent with
tlie condition of treasury and sym
pathy with tin' straightened eirettin
stances of our fellow citizens.
TAUIFF It 10 FO It M.
■After a hard struggle,” says the
president, "tariff reform indirectly be
fore us. Nothing so important claims
our attention and nothing should inter
vene to disturb our effort until this
reform is accomplished Ivy wise and
careful legislation, While we should
staunchly adhere to the principle that
only the necessity for revenue justilies
the imposition of tariff duties and fed
eral taxation, we cannot close our
eyes to the conditions that have grows
tip among us which cull for discriminat
ing carts in the distribution of such
.duties and taxation as the emergencies
'of our government actually demand.
A measure lias been prepared by the
appropriate congressional committee
| embodying tariff reform on lines here
in suggested which will be promptly
submitted for legislative action. 1 am
satisfied that the proposed legislation,
added to the existing internal revenue
; taxati, n, will in the near future pro
due,• a sufficient revenue lo meet the
1 needs of the government. To provide
a possible temporary deficiency the
committee wisely embraced in the plan
a few additional internal revenue taxes,
including a small tu.c upon incomes
derived from certain corporate invest
ments. These assessments have merit,
being such its can be remitted without
unfavorable business disturbances
I win never the necessity of imposition
re longer exists. In my great desire
for the success of this measure I can
not retsrain the suggestion that its
success can only be obtained by means
'of unselfish counsel on the part of the
, friends of tariff reform and as a re
[suit of their willingness to subordi
nate personal desires and ambitions to
tin* general good.”
"In conclusion, my intense feeling of
responsibility Impels me to invoke for
[the manifold interests of a generous
and confiding people tlie most scrupu
lous care, and 1 pledge my willing sup
port to every legislative effort for the
advancement of the greatness and pros
perity of our beloved country.

IBSEN AND HIS MAYS.
j It is said tb it Ibsen reads very little;
he declares that he "will not be drawn
away from himself." He has been
afraid of the judgment of Paris,
j "Parisians,” he said, "are so refined
thill it is strange they should take any
[ interest in my ways,” He doesn't un
derstand why they should indulge in
■philosophical speculations concerning
bis felicitous personages, who are very
real and perfectly simple to him. 'T
live in tin l reality of my characters,”
lie says, "and lo such an extent that
I could count the number of buttons
[they have on their coats.” One who
knows Ishen well says that ho has no
Intimate friends; that the only person
who has any authority over him is his
wife. He lias a high opinion of women
and a very poor one of, men. He
doesn’t care to engage in a crusade of
social changes. "I am a spectator,
and no more,” he says.
