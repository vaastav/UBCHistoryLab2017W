M. Tail ?ores has found the work of forming
a Ministry too d?licult and has abandoned it.
President Carnot has ??.\? ieijupstcd Senator
Stari to try hi? hand. Perhaps he may bo
inoro successful ; but a Cabinet formed under
such circumstances, composed as it must bo
of the reiiiescntativcs of conflicting elements,
can hardly be expected to enjoy a prolonged
k-ase of life.
Preparation! for tho convention of Repub?
lican (tubs here this ?TfJflk are well advanced.
The gathering will possess peculiar signifi?
cance. It ie expe- ted that every State and
Territory will bo represented by delegates.
Renatm? Bratti is ipokea of as most likely to bo
made permanent chairman. His acc-cptanc?
of the position will be a guarantee of tho entire
success of the convention.
An interesting and timely talk with Chair?
man Jones, of tho Hi publican National Com?
mittee, is printed in another column. Natur?
ally he bas a good deal to say about the ???,????
interview, whit?h he pronounces a spontaneous
reply to the President's message and a telling
answer to that Free-Trade tract, Air. Jone? is
confident of Republican success and rejoices
that the issue has been so clearly made. While
he personally favored Philadelphia as the place,
for tho iN?tional Convention, he is satisfied
that the selection of Chicago will be generally
approved. ,
Pong island has been the scene of another
horrililr ctime, not unlike many of those which
have rendered that region notorious on account
of their peculiarly repulsive character. There
eeems to In* little reason for doubting that Mrs.
lirow'er was the victim 0? her husband's brutal
??afa? His story that burglars entered the
house and periietratcd the crime has not a
particle of evidence to support it. Tbe cir?
cumstantial ?vidence against him is strong
enough to render his fate certain should the
womut, die, as appears altogether likely. The
latent verdict m a murder case on Long Island
furnLshes reason for hoping that crimes of this
ftoit will not hereafter be more numerous be?
cause of the failure In inflict due punishment
on guilty men in the past.
Mr. Hcrry'a declination of tho call to Ply?
mouth Church will be a serious m aback to Mr.
Ilee.her's congregation. That the society was
able to unite as easily as it did upon the invi?
tation to Mr. Berry was a surpr'se to many
who realized the diverse elements which were
drawn and held together so bmg by Mr.
Beccher's strong personality. So emphatic was
the unanimity of tho church's action that it
aeemed as if it? career of prosjierity waa hardly
to be interi upt(*d by the severe blow it had ?e
?eiv?(L aigreAitient upon another minister
?will probably bo lota easy. Wltetb?. ? h?v ??!*
will seek a foreigner tho next t?ruc h in'i-r
lain, bttt it seems likely that an American I
be the second choice. Mr. Berry may bo wise
in vielding to tho pressure P'U upon hiro to
stay in Wolverhampt'in. He nas ?rtoinly
gained /ame through the actioa of Plymonth
Church. If America has not enough nttme
tive pf.wer to draw him from his present parish,
perhaps in a few years London may offer
stronger induci ment*. ,
Full details of th?? afcnipt in assassinate M.
Ferry .no contained in oui spe< ial cable dis?
patch from Paris. While the* injured man's
wounds are seemingly in no danger of result?
ing fatally, the latest bulletins concerning liiui
are less favorable than the earlier one?. The.
wmild-lie assa.-'sin. Aubertin. appears to Ik* a
dangerous ?rank, if he is not actually insane.
He has had a varied career, having patented
many inventions, written school-books, made
stained bJbm and been a milliner and a pho?
tographer. (V late he is said to have been a
professional blackmailer. In some resp' ? kg he
resemi lei t?uiteau closely. Ili.?* motive in at?
tacking M. Ferry is not made clear. He claims
It be the agent of a secret society. After Ihe
sho't'ng h exclainiid that he had avenged
Lorraine and wnt happy. Whether an exten?
sive plot, against political leaders exista or
not, this occurrence ? ill only increase the agi?
tation to which the ch utfCtj in the French Gov?
ernment have given lieo. That is a result to
1m? deplored, whatever the ultimate effect may
be on M. Ferry himself._ l I ; >
XO MOR?' Dl SOUSES.
The Piesidont's message has been hailed by
British manufactuicis und traders as quite the.
grandest thing of the age. His friends have
been calling on m'Hiknid to fall down and wor?
ship his supeiiiuman murage. Hut now some
of them whisper that it was never intended to
pass a bill on the ??nes of the message; tho
object w^.s only to get ready for some moderato
compromiso.
There ought to be some understanding about
this. Mr. Cleveland can hardly be entitled to
praise at the same time for lofty scorn of con?
sequences and for tricky demagogism?for ex?
alted courage and for cunning pretence. Ho
wants what ho says, or he dorn not. He is
welcome to a r?putation as a Free-Trade
Champion. Hut if it is proposed to siiig
hallelujahs to him as the Free-Trade-Pro?
tectionist of his age. who can beat Mr. Facing
both-wa.vs in dodging, and any waterman on
the river in looking one way and pulling an?
other, the applause frill toper off into the thin?
nest kind of a squeak. Americans have other
demagogues whose eminence in that field they
do not forget. Indeed, they declino to bo
unjust to the memory of Mr. Hendricks.
What tho President has said in his message,
unfortunately for him, bears but ono interpre?
tation. If ho meant something else by it,
either he lacks the sense to know what his
words mean, or the honesty to u-11 the people
what he thinks Not a single one of his politicai
opponents will bo so uncharitable a> to attrib?
ut? to him a different intent or meaning from
that which he avows They are cnlinly will?
ing to give him full credit for what he has
said. If any of his party friends think they
tan better his case by representing him as a
dishonest knave, they aio much mistaken.
There is a largo body of citizens who think
a protective tariff huit lui and unjust. They
hold it wrong to build up by legislative en?
couragement a now industry which gives em?
ployment to thousands, if in the process other
individuals aro made to sacrilicc temporarily a
cent for the common good. They consider it
right to feed a million pesons in idleness at
public expense, after Great Britain's fashion,
but the basest of turpitude to pr?vido them
with honest industry in which they can cam
their own living.
These citizens have a right to be heard
through the President, and at the polls. Other
citizens ask nothing better than to meet them
in a square ballot on that issue. What tho
President has said puts the opinion of fico
traders distintily. If his party will now frame
a bill on the same principles, cutting pro?
tection out of the tariff whciever they
can. it will distinguish itself by its liist
honest act on the subject of tho tariff, for
twenty-six years. It has earned tho conten ,-t
of tho country long enough by trying to de?
stroy the protective system while pretending
before the voters to have no such intent.
THE PLOT AC, tl.SST FERRY.
Target-practico in halls of legislation is so
unusual an incident of Pailiamcntary govern?
ment that the importance of the attempt upon
If. Ferry's lifo will probably be exaggerated.
One week there is an exciting election in which
ho is a prominent candidato! and the next he
is fired upon by a dastardly assassin. Kupor
Gcial observers will be apt to concludo that tho
end of republican institutions in Fiance Is ap?
proaching since faction feeling is already in?
stigating deeds of murder and bloodshed. Ten
days ago feara were entertained by faint?
hearted friends of the Republic lest barricades
should be erected in tho streets and the signal
for revolution be given by a Paris mob. The
attempt of a member of a secret society to as?
sassinate M. Ferry will revive this feeling of
insecurity and uneasiness. The oft-repeated
moral that government in France is danger?
ously unstable will be pointed once again in
circles of London, Herlin and l*aris society
where tho downfall of the Republic is secretly
hoped for, if not openly plotted.
The assassin's act seems to have been iire
sponsil'l?? since ho appeared indifferent respect?
ing the choice of a victim. When he entered
the Chamber of Deputies he inquired for both
M. Goblet and If. Ferry, and fired upon the
latter only because ho was unable to find the
former. The assailant's youth and {national
bearing preclude tho assumption that there
was a formidable plot against M. Ferry or that
faction feeling or ? liticai excitement insti?
gated this act. In spite of his reported declar?
ation that other conspirators had drawn lots
for the privilege of creating a scene In tho
Chamber, it is probable that be was acting
without associates and that like the Ameritan
Guiteau he was in search of notoriety. Possi?
bly the only serious effect of tho pi>tol firing
in tho ( mmber of Deputies will be the adven?
titious ani which If, Ferry will derive from it
in rogai-ling a political authority that has been
m tollt!J impaired. This effect will become
inoro marked if the assassin succeeds in con?
vincing either the p? lice or the Deputies that
he had accomplices and that the plut Is to be
accounted a Radical famib affair.
M. Ferry, while a political leader by nature
am. .n exceedingly %\Ab nun--lerbaps with the
singlo exception of If. Clemenceau the
strongest man in Fremii public lifo?has been
surrounded during his career with venal asso?
ciate? and stock-jobbing statesmen. For this
?eason his reputation for probity and the more
robust qualities of moral statesmanship has
been impaired. He is tho only Republican
leader who has contrived to excite the enmity
of large ? lasaos of the community. This cow?
ardly assault upon his life may create a strong
feeling of sympathy lor him and thereby
Till s? E8i r nf ?: AG ?.
Ono of Mr. Rhum'?. Lrongest pa riti in his
criticism of the message is his reference to
cheap labor. American inaniifact.r? require
tho maintenance of a protettive torM be? .?
hibor costs BOte h?*re than in England. It'the
tariff iron :?1??1?'.??!?? ?. (heir -nily hope of COm
p'ling with foreiga ma ? ufa? tillers WOOld lie in
effecting a gen???!! reiinction of wages. If
their workmen were to be paid the EttgH-ah or
Continental rites of wage?, they wou'.d have to
live :. i European workmen do and give up
n.any ol ?M OOmftftS BAU pi?\ ?leges t?? which
they h ? ve accustomed th? ni?elves. It would
be. M Mr. PI mS siys. nothing less than a
social and financia' re,'dation and would in
v It? untold diaire?. Are Americaa mann
facture! 1 j.iepared for the conflict with unions
and operatives which would l>e involved by a
renerai reduction of wages to the European
?Cafo? Ar? Americas W< ?kingiii<n willing to
live as English and Gorman artisans do and to
be content with greatly rediu ed wages ? ? h< so
;..e practical Qimtioa? that underlie the w ok
subject of free trade.
At lidi point tin- free-trade theorist, whose
rash .'K-ii'iiplions have been accepted by tho
President as canons of economie science, inter?
venes with the answer thai the w?. rkllIg people
would be as well ofl'iindei* the redi,? ? d ?chcdulc
because (1,1'ir wages would have increased pur?
chasing power. To take an illustration fur
nish?'d by a sewing-machine manager in yester?
day's ???p?'?'?:. opeiatives who are receiving
$"?1 a week inic for a grade of work for which
$7 is paid in Beo, land would be expected ? ?, buy
as much under fico trade for vT as they now
do node protection for ?~l ! This may tic an
extreme case, as marking the differonc in
wages between the United States and Kng' md,
but the principle is known to be true, ss a
matter of common experience among working
men, thut the purchasing power of their 9 I
wages greatly exceeds that of the wecklj
wages paid in Europe. If the tariff be sbobahed
and English Manufacturers arc allowed to com?
peto on even terms with home manufacturers,
wages would accessaiilj be heavily reduced
and tho g;iin in purchasing power would be in?
considerable, fur protection has powerfully
stimulated production and brought in an era
of low piice-i.
THE PROPOSED NEW ItTEBBT.
It is an important question which the Board
of .Street Openings is to consider to-day-ono
of the most important that cui come beforo
that body for decision. W'i'h the question in
? general way the pt-O] le o? this city arc by this
time tolerably familiar. It has not bed, long
under consideration, but there has been time
enough for those interested to obtain a good
idea of what is contemplated. This is nothing
less than the opening of a new street touth
wardly from a point between Frankfoit-st. and
tho Bridge, cutting through the middle of the
Plucks between Nassau and William sts., and
extending aa far down town as Maiden-lnnc or
l.ibei-ty-st. The little alley known as I lieh?
et., between Fulton and John st?., woiul be
swallnw'ed up in the new thoroughfare.
Thai some additional means of travel In this
direction is needed no one can dispute who has
observed the overcrowded condition of Na Bara?
tt, and lower Broadway. The pi.in proposed
by tho committee of Ihe Hoard of Street Open?
ings is clearly preferable to an attempt to
Widen rfaasan-St. This might have been done
once, but is now out of the o_neatioa oo account
of the huge and cosily pues that have been
erected at many points along this narrow
street. To widening Willimn-st. ther?-? ?vould
b" lens objection, ; I though the cost in that ease
would be great; and, besides, means of con?
necting the widened street wi'h the City Ila'l
Bqoara would remain unprovided. With the
new- street it is proposed to cut off the corner
where French's Hotel stands, the junction with
I'ark How* being made at an easy angle. Per?
haps a better plan woul 1 be to tear away all
the buildings between Frankfort-st. and ihe
Bridge for some distance from Parie I?ow,
making an open plaza and facilitating the ap?
proach to the Bridge,
? rich an undei taking as this will necessatily
involve the expenditure of a large sum of
money. The city has done nothing of this
?Oft) we b( lieve, since the opening of New
Chambors-st. and the New IJowcry. Il i> plain
that no decisive action should be taken until
the cost has been carefully e>t ?mated.
? OX E Y ANV BUSINESS,
Those who say least about the President'"
message, as a ilei ting their business, arc apt to
be those who feel it most. Hut there is no
room to doubt that its effect has been unfavor?
able. The Joliet Steel Company gives notice
that its works are to be dosed indefinit? ly | a
year ago orders were booked for SU.fXMJ tons
for tho next year, but now the mills have
orders for not a ton. Mr. Claike, ot tho
Thomas Company, Is qaoted as saying, "Most
of tho stee! rail mills will shut down beforo
Christmas. The demand was growing lighter,
and ihe President's message drives another
nail in our coffin*" G? to December 1, ho
states, tho association had orders for only
75,(XX) tons for next year, but not an order
since. " Tho lion Age"' states that " the new
furnaco plants in the South, with few excep?
tions, have been bud: to aid real estate Speco
lations." and that '"some of tho later enter?
prises have already Suffered from a sharp de?
cline, and the older and stronger spedii itive
ventures are being hi Id by main strength of
money accumulated by past ??0008?0?.? Hut,
whether prosperous or not, if they make iron
tho market will feel it. The vast quantity of
iron used in making rails last year already
begins to be offered at prices which affect the
market for other iron.
The protest of the National Wool Growers'
Association and the movement of growers iu
Texas call attention to the fact that the manu?
facture has taken less both of domestic and o?
foreign WOOl this year than last. Tlicil'p has
been .?.mailer, the number of sheep having
diminished 3,700,000 acoording to the asso?
ciation, and importi for ten months ending
with October were less by 2-,???,??? pounds.
With a great industry in this position, the un
ceriainUes of tariff agitation in Congress can
hardly be of no effect. In general, the proa?
peel of change leads many bf-jem to hold off,
and the session is to run on with its unccttaiii
tica into next summer.
Home weeks ago. when stocks were booming
and the Street was seoot-Bg the possibil ly of
a decline, then were large sale?.. The avenge
of prices had then lisi ? since Novemlier 1
about %M per share and has since fallen ?3 per
share, Including UO cents during the *>ast week.
The promise that a great uplifting will coiuc
in January?w ill: Congress in session? may be
profitably c?>nipai?-d with the fact that last
year the avenge of prices was 872 when Con?
grios met and >?<?7 (?2 when it adjourned: in
1881 it was Hiii, Ml to ?i?.r,8 in January, and
to |8I :.'8 by May ; in 1MH1 it was ?17 Uwhea
Congres? met, fell to "??llfi'J, and barely re?
covered to $1K by March 4. The tariff agi?
tation for three winters past haa not .sti? ngth
SS-Sd securities; whether it will this winter,
people ruu-at guo?_ lot themselves. The earn

Hour, packed meats and refined sugars BJC not

piii-ons.
Foreign imports last week wore light, and
exports above last year's, For November the
PJew-YOTk dedine 0? 10.1 per cent in erpoftl
and increase of 8.4 in imports would indicate,
if changes elsewhere were similar, an fSttXmr
for tho month "f ?'bout $8,000,000 in expmts
bearla?? about 9300,000 specie. If so, the
movement of foreign capital to this l ide in

building, tho remainder of which can al<o 1)0 advan?
tageously let. Is an extremely different matter. I have
