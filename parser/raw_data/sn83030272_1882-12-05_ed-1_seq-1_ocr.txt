1110nsFJRII JILA TONS
I first call your attention to tho gratifying
ondltlon of our foreign affairs Our Inter
course with other powers has continued to be
of the mot friendly character Buch slight
differences as havo arisen during tho year have
boon already settled or are likely to roach an
4 tarly adjustment
Lie The arrest of citizens of tho United States In
Ireland under recent laws which owe tholr
origin t the disturbed condition of that coun
try has led t a somewhat extended cor re
ipondonoo with the Government of Great
Prltaln A disposition t respect our rights
has been practically manifested by the release
tt tho arrested parties
The claim of this nation In regard to tho su
pervlilon and control of any Intoroceanlo canal
across the American Isthmus has continued t
b the subject of conference I Is likely that
Limo will b more powerful than discussion In
removing the divergence between the two na
tions whoso friendship Is so closely cemented
by the Intimacy of their relations and the com
tnunlty of their Interests
Our longestablished friendliness with Rus
sia has remained unbrokon I hn prompted
0 ri me to proffer tho earnest counsels of this Qov
Brnmont that measures b adopted for sup
Efi pressing tho proscription which the Hebrew race
00 In that country has lately suffered I has not
nr transpired that any American citizen has boon
ED subjected to arrest or Injury but our courte
ous remonstrance has nevertheless boon cour
teously received There Is reason to bollovo
oNe that tho time II not far distant when Russia
will b able to secure toleration to all faiths
within her borders
At an International convention held at Paris
In 1880 and attended by representatives of tho
United States an agreement was reached in ro
spool t the protection of trade marks patented
articles and the rights of manufacturing llrms
ali corporations Tho formulating Into trea
ties of tho recommendations thus adopted Is
receiving tho attention which It mortis The
protection of submarine cables a subject now
under consideration by an International con
ference at Paris Believing that It Is clearly
tho true policy of this Government to favor
tho neutralization of this means ot intercourse
I reiiuestcd our Minister t Franco to attorn
tho Convention n a delegate I also doslg
natod two of our eminent scientists to attend
a our representatives at tlio meeting of an
international committee at Paris for consld
snug the adoption of a common unit to metis
erng
uro electric force
In view of the frequent occurrence of confer
ances for the consideration of Important mat
tore of common Interest to civilized nations I
respectfully suggest that the Executive b in
vested by Congress with discretionary power
to send delegates to such conventions and
that provision b mado t defray the expense
expnles
Incident thereto
Tho difference between the United States and
Bpaln us to the effect of it judgment and cer
tlllcato of naturalization has not yet been ad

tabllshmont of the position which seems t
S this Government so reasonable and just I
have already called tho attention of Congress
to tho fat that in parts of Bpaln and Us colo
nlns onerous linos have lately boon Imposed
upon vessels of the United Htates for trivial
technical offences against local regulations
Efforts for tho abatement of these exactions
oxnctons
have thus far proved unsuccessful I regret
to Inform you alto that the fees demanded by
Bpanlsh Consuls American ports are In some
eases so largo when compared with the valuo
of tlm cargo an to amount In effect to a consid

founder of South American Independence in

THE SOUTH AMERICAN WAR
The war between Peru and Bolivia on the one
side and Chi on tho other began moro than
three years ago on the occupation by Chill In
1B80 of all the literal territory of Bolivia Ne
gotiations for peace were conducted under the
direction of the United States The allies ro
fused to concede Inv territory but Chill has
slnco become master of the whole coast of
both countries and of ibis capital CI Peru
A year since as you havo already been advised
by correspondence transmitted to you In
January hist this Government sent a special
mission to the belligerent powers to express
tho hope that Chill would b disposed to
accept 1 money Indemnity for the expenses of
tho war and to relinquish her demand for a
portion of tbo territory of her antagonist This
recommendation which Chi declined to fol
low this Government did not assume to en
force nor can it b enforced without resort to
measures which would b In keeping neither
with tho temper of our people nor with tho
spirit of our Institutions Tho power of Peru
no longer extOl 8 over Its whole territory and
In tho event of our Interference to dictate
peace would need to b supplemented by the
armies and navies of the United States Much
interference would almost Inevitably lead to
the establishment of a protectorate a result
utterly at odds with our past policy Injurious
to our present Interests and full of embarrass
ment for the future For effecting tho termina
tion of hostilities upon terms at once just to
tho victorious nation all generous to Its ad
versaries this Government has spared no ef
forts nave such as might Involve tho complications
complca
tions which I have Indicated It Is greatly to b
deplored that Chi seoms < resolved to exact
such rigorous conditions of peace and Indis
posed to submit to arbitration tho terms of an
amicable settlement No peace Is likely to be
lasting that Is not suftlciently equitable b
3ust to command tho approval of other nations
THE PEACE ONO S
About a year since Invitations wore extended
to tho nations of this continent to send repre
sentatives to a Pouco Congress to assemble at
Washington In November 1882 The time of
mooting was fixed at a period then remote in
the hope as Ibo Invitation Itself declared that
in the mean time the disturbances between tho
South American republics would b adjusted
As that expectation seemed unlikely to b re
alized I asked In April last for an expression of
opinion from tho two Houses of Congress a to
the advisability of holding tho proposed con
vention nt the time appointed This action
was prompted In part by doubts which mature
reflection had suggested whether the diplo
matic usage and tradition of the Government
did not make I lilting that the Executive
should consult the Itoprosnntatlves of the peo
ple before pursuing a tine of policy somewhat
novel In Its character and far reaching In Its
possible consequences In view of the fact that
no action was taken by Congress In the prem
ises and that no provision had been made for
necessary expenses I subsequently decided t
postpone the convocation and so notified the
several Governments which had been invited to
attend I am unwilling t dismiss this subject
without assuring of of
MurlnK you my support any
measures the wisdom of Congress may devise
for the promotion of peace on this continent
and throughout tho world And I trust that
tho time is nigh when with the universal assent
of clvlllred peoples all International differ
ences shall b determined without resort to
arms by the benignant processes of arbitration
Changes have occurred In thedlplomatlc rep
resentation of several foreign powers during
the past year New Ministers from the Argen
tine RepublIc Austria Hungary Brazil Chlla
China France Japan Mexico The Nether
lands and HiiBsla have presented their creden
tials The missions of Denmark and Venezuela
at this capital have been raised In grade
Switzerland has created a plenipotentiary mis
sion to this Government and an embassy from
Madagascar and a Ministry from Siam will
shortly arrive Our diplomatic Intercourse halt
been enlarged by the establishment of relations
with the nol kingdom of Survia by the crea
tion of 1 mission to Slam and by the restora
tion of the mission to Greece The Shah of
ton has expressed his gratification that a
Charge dAffalros will shortly be Bent to that
country where the rights of our citizens have
been hitherto courteous y guarded by tho rep
resentatlves of Great IJrltaln
I renew my recommendation of such legisla
tion as will place the United States In harmony
with other maritime powers with respect to the
International rules for the prevention of col
lisions at sea

G5G 418 I commend to your attention the Sec
retary views In respect to tho likelihood of a
serious contraction of this circulation and
to Ibo modes by which that result may in his
judgment b averted
In respect to the coinage of sliver dollars and
the retirement of silver certlllcntcs I have
Icon nothing to altar but much to confirm the
sentiments t which I nave expression last
year A comparison between the re
spective amounts of silverdollar circu
lation on Nov 1 1881 and and Nov
11882 shows an increase of a million and
a bal of dollars but during tho Interval
thero had hen in the whole number coined an
Increase of twentysix millions Of tho ono
hundred and twentyeight millions thus far
minted little more than tblrtrnvo millions aro
In circulation The mass of accumulated coin
has grown so great that the vault room nt pres
ent available for storage Is I scarcely sufficient
to contain I I Is not apparent why It it desir
able to continue this coinage now so enor
mously in excess of tho public demand As to
the silver 1 certificates In addition to the
grounds which seemed last year to justify their
retirement mar b mentlonedthe effect which
Is likely t ensue from the supply of gold cer
tificates for whose Issuance Congress recently
mado provision and which are now In active
actve
circulation
tonTE SURFLUB RETZNtlB
You cannot fall to note with Interest tho dis
cussion by tho Secretary as to the necessity of
providing by legislation some mode of freeing
the Treasury of an excess of assets In tho
event that Congress falls to reach an early
agreement for the reduction of taxation I
rlduton
heartily approve tho Secretarys recommenda
tion of immediate and extensive reductions In
the annual revenues of tho Government It
will bo remembered that I urged upon the at
tention of Congress at its lost session the Im
portance of relieving tho Industry and enter
prise of tho country from the pressure of
unnecessary taxation It In one of the truest
maxims of political economy that all taxes are
burdensome However wisely and prudently
Imposed and though there have always ben
among our people wide differences of sen
timent as to tho best methods of rais
ing tho national revenues and Indeed a
to tho principles upon which taxation should
bo based there has been substantial accord
In tho doctrine that only such taxes ought to
b levied as are necessary fore wise and eco
nomical administration of the Government
Gf late the public revenues have far exceeded
the limit and unless checked by appropriate
legislation such excels will continue to In
crease from year to year For tho fiscal year
ended Juno 30 1881 tho surplus revenue
amounted t IIOOOOOOCKI For the fiscal yen
ended on the 30th of Juno last the surplus was
morn than tl43000000 The report of the
Secretary shows what disposition has been
made of these moneys They havo not only
answered tho requirements of tho sinking
fund but have afforded a large balance applica
ble to other reductions of the public debt Hut
I renew tho expression of my conviction that
such rapid extinguishment of the national
Indebtedness a is I now taking place Is
by no means a cause for congratulation
I Is a cause rather for serious apprehension
I It continues It must speedily followed
byone of the evil I results so clearly set forth In
the report of the Secretary Either tho sur
plus must Ho Idle 1 in tho Treasury or the Gov
ernment will < forced to buy at market rates
a
Its bonds not then redeemable and which un
der such circumstances cannot fall to com
mand an enormous premium or the swollen
revenues will be devoted to extravagant ex
penditure which as experience has taught Is
over the bane of an overflowing Treasury
I was made apparent In the course of the ani
mated discussion whichthJ j > ucstlon arousod
at the last session of Congress tat the policy
of diminishing the revenue by reducing taxa
tion commanded the general approval of the
members of both Houses I regret that b
cause of conflicting views as to the best meth
ods by which that policy should b made opor
atlve none of Its benefits have as yet been
reaped In fulfilment of vhat I deem my con
stitutional duty but with little hope that I
can make valuable contiibutlon to this vexed
question I shall proceed to Intimate briefly
my own views In relation to I
REDUCTION or 1NTB11NAL REVENUE
Upon the showing of our financial condition
at t the close of the last fiscal year I foal justi
fied In recommending to Congress the abolition
of Internal revenue taxes except those upon
tobacco In Its various forms and upon distilled
spirits and fermented liquors and except also
the special tax upon the manufacturers of and
dealers In such articles
1 vonturo now to suggest that unless It shall
be ascertained that the probable expenditures
of the Government for tho coming year have
beon underestimated all Internal taxes sivo
tliosn which relate to distilled spirit can bo
prudently abrogated
Much a curse I accompanied by a simpllfl
cation of tho machinery of collection which
would then be easy of accomplishment might
reasonably b expected to result in diminish
ing tile cost of such collection by a least
f 2600 000 and In the retirement from office of
from 1500 to 2000 persons
Thin p6lem of excise duties has never com
mended itself to the favor of the American
poopl and hn never been resorted tn except
for supplying deficiencies In the Treasury
when by reason of special exigencies tho
duties on Imports have proved Inadequate
for the needs of the Government
rite sentiment of the country doubtless de
mands thut tho present excise tax shall bo
abolished as soon as such a course can safely
DO pursued It to however for
IJ purlld I seems me va
rious reasons so sweeping a measure as the
total abolition of Internal taxes would for tho
present b an unwlso step Two of these rea
sons arc deserving of special mention First
It Is I by no means clear that even If the existing
system of duties on Imports Is continued with
out modification those duties alone will yield
sulllclent revenue for all the needs of the Gov
ernment I is I estimated that one hundred
millions of dollars will b required for
pensions during the coming year and I may
well bo doubted whether tho maximum annual
demand fo that object has ret been leached
Uncertainty upon this question would alom I
justify In my judgment tho retention for tile
present of that portion of the sv stain of Inter
nal revenue which Is least objectionable to tile
people Second a total abolition of excise
taxes would almost Inevitably prove a serious
if not an insurmountable obstacle to a thor
ough lovl lon of the tariff and testIly consider
able reduction In Import duties
TiE TARIFF STSTUM
The present tariff ttystem is In ninny respects

burdens and Its hciicHts Jilts fact wasprae
tlcnlly recognized by a majority of each House

has prevailed In all other parta of the country
line permitted such an addition to b made to
the military force In tho region endangered by
the Apaches that thero reI Ito reason to ap
prohond trouble In the future
Those parts of the Secretary leport which
elate t our seacoast defences and armament
uggnst the gravest reflections Our existing
fortifications aro notoriously Inadequate to tho
ofonco of the great harbors and cities for
hose protection they woro built The ques
tion of providing an armament suited to our
present necessities has boon tho Aubjoct of con
deration by a Hoard whoso roport was trans
milted to Congress at tho last session Pend
Ing tho consideration of that report the War
opartmont has taken no stops for the nianu
acturo or conversion of any heavy cannon
but the Secretary expresses tho hope that au
horlty and means to begin that Important
work will b soon provided I Invlto the atten
lon of Congress to the propriety of making
more adequate provision for arming and equip
ilng tho militia than is afforded by the act of
rln
lSOo which Is still upon tho statute books Tho
matter has already bon the subject of discus
Ion In tho Senate and a bill which seeks t
supply tho deficiencies of the existing laws Is
now upon its calendar
The Hcroi ty4kLWir calls Attention to the
fact that an embarrassment exists growing
out of the recent act of Congress making tho
retirement the officers of the army conipul
ory at the ago of 64 years The net of 1878 Is
till In force which limits 1040 the number of
hose who can be retired for disability or upon
heir own application Those two acts when
construed together seem t forbid tho rellov
ing even for absolute Incapacity of officers
who do not fall within the purview the latter
statute save at such tme as there chance to
h e loss than 400 names on the retired list
Thero are now 420 I Is not likely that Con
gress Intended this result and I concur with
he Secretary that the law ought to bo amended
Tho grounds that Impelled mo to withhold
my signature from the bill entitled An act
making appropriations for tho construction
repair and preserratlon of certain works on
Ivors and harbors I which bocnino a law near
ho close of your last session prompt me to
express the hope that no similar measure will
deemed necessary during tho present see
stan of Congress Indeed such a measure
would now bo open t a serious objection In
addition to that which was lately urged upon
jour attention
I am Informed by tho Secretary of War that
the greater portion of tho sum appropriated
for the various Items specified in that act roo
mains unexpended Of the new works which
It authorized expenses have been incurred upon
two only for which the total appropriation was

I Is I apparent by this exhibit that so far as
concerns most of the Items to which the act of
Aug 2 18M2 relates there can bo no need i of
b
tinner appropriations until after tho close of
the present session I howover any action
should seem to bo necessary In respect to par
ticular objects It will be entirely feasible to
provide for those objects by appropriate
legislation I Is possible for example
that a delay until the assembling of tho
next Congress to make an additional pro
vision for tho MissIssippi River Improvements
monte might b attended with serious
consequences I such should appear to b the
cae just bill relating tn that subject would
command my approval This leads me t offer
a suggestion which I trust will commend Itself
to the wisdom of Congress It Is not advisable
that grants of considerable sums of money for
diverse and independent schemes of Internal
Improvement should b made the subjects of
separate and distinct legislative enactment
I will scarcely b gainsaid even by those
who favor the mom liberal expenditure
t for nb purposes lbral upndlturl
Or accomplished by what Is I commonly called the River
Intl larLor bill that Ih prclc 01 r In eIi a

to do without being called upon to sanction other im

aftorded thereby a full opportunity to noel his con
tltutlontvl prerogative of opposing whatever

success of other which commended themselves to hi
Judgment I may be urged In opposition to these sag
SectIons that the number nf work of internal Improve

whether It be or not the advantage which would be

THE POSTAL HERVICS
The report of ths Postmaster General gives evldsnee ot
the sstlsfsctory condition of that department and con
tabs many valuable data find accompanying suggee
lions which cannot fall to be of Interest The Informa
tion which II affords that Ihe receipts for the fiscal year
have exceeded the expenditures must be very ratify
log lo Concrete and to the people of the country
At matters which may fairly claim particular alien
lion 1 refer you lo lite obssrvaflons In reference to the
advlsabllltr of changing ths present basil for fixing sal
aries and allowances ot extending the money order sys
tem and of enlarging the functions of the postal estab
lishment so as to put under Its control the telegraph sys
tem of the country though from this last and most Im
portant recommendation I must withhold my concur
rent
At the last session of Congress several bills wet Intro
duced Into the House of Representatives for the reduc
tion of letter postage to Its rate of two cents per halt
ounce 1 have given much study and reflection to this
subjectand am thoroughly persuaded list such areuluc
tlon would be for the best Interests of the public It has
been ths policy ot the Internment from lie foundation
to defray as far as possible the expenses of carrringtha
malls by a direct tax In the form ot postage H has
never been claimed however that this service ought to
be productive of a net revenue
As has been stated already the report ot the Postmas
ter General shows that there Is now a very considerable
surplue In hts department and that henceforth the re
ceipts ars likely to Increase al a much greater ratio than
ha necessary expenditures Unless some change Is
mad In the existing laws the profits of the postal ser
vice will In a very few years swell the revenues of the
Government many millions of dollars Ths tIme seems
auspicious therefore for some reduction In the rates
of postage In what shall that reduction
consist t A review of the legislation which
has been had upon this subject during the
last thirty years discloses that domestic letters con
stltuts the only class of mall matter which has
ever been favored by a substantial reduction of rates
I am convinced that the burden at maintaining the ser
vice falls most unequally upon that class and that more
than any otherlt Is entitled to present relief That such
relief may be extended without detriment to other pub
lic Interest will be discovered upon reviewing the re
sults ot former reductions
FACTS AND TIOUnES
Immediately prior to the act ot 1B41 ths postage upon
a letter composed of a single sheet was as follows If
conveyed miles or less 0 cents between W and BO
mtlee lUcentst between BO and ISO miles I2K cents
between ISO and 40O inllee 18 cents over 4111 miles a
cents By the act of 1845 the poPlar upon a single let
ter conveyed for any distance under KKJ miles was fixed
at 5 cents and for any greater distance 10 cents
By the ut of 1H51 It was provided that a short letter
If prepaid should bs carried any distance not exceeding
30UO miles for three cents and any greater distance for
six cents It will bs noticed that both of these reduo
tons wet of a tadlral character and relatively quite as
Important as that which Is now proposed In each case
there ensued a temporary loss of revenue but a sudden
and large Influx ot business hlch substantially repaired
that less within three years Unless the experience of
past legislation In this country and elsewhere goes for
naught It may lie safely predicted that the stimulus ot
K per centum reduction In the tax for carriage would at
once increase tha number ot letters consigned to the
mails The advantage of secrecy would lead to a very
general substitution of sealed packets for postal cards
and open circulars and In divers other wa > s the volume
of first class mallet would be enormously augmented
Such Increase amounted In Kngland In the llrst year
after the adoption of jieliny postage to more than I3A
per cent As a result of careful estimates the details of
which cannot be here set out I have become convinced
that the deficiency for this first year after the iroposed
reduction would not exceed 7 per cent of Ill expeliull
lure orfJKMlun while tlio deficiency after the reduc
tion of Irut was more thai M per cent and after that ot
taIl was 27 per cent
Another Interesting comparison Is afforded by statis
tics furnished tne by the tost Office IlcMiartment The
act of IfHA was passed in face of the fad that there ex
isted a deficIency of more than 510uell i Tint of IHM
was encouraged by the slight surplus nf niixi The
excess of revenue tn the next fiscal v car is likely to bs
Smut
ft Congress should approve these suggestions It may
be deemed desirable to suiiplvto some extent the de
ficiency which must for a time result hv Increasing the
charge for carrying mrrchnmllsv which Is now emly
sixteen cents pemound Hntf ven veltlinut cactI an In
crease I am confident that tha recriiits under the
diminished rates would equal the expenditures after lit
lapse of three or four years
THE STAR ROUTE SWINDLES
The report ot the Department Justice brings anew
to your notice the necessity of enlarging the prevent
svslem of Federal Jurisprudence so as effectually to
answer Ihe requirements of the ever Increasing litiga
tion with which II Is called upon to deal
Ths Attorney leneral renews ths suggestions ot his
predecessor that In tho Interest of justice belter pro
vision than the existing laws afford should be made in
certain Judicial districts for fixing the fees ot witnesses
and Jurors
In my message ot December last I referred to pending
criminal proceedings growing out of alleged frauds In
what Is known aa the Star routs service of tile 1ost
Office Department and advised 3011 that I had enjoined
upon the Attorney leueral and associate counsel to
whom the Interests of the Government were In
trusted the duty of prosecuting with the utmost
vigor of the law all persons who might be found
chargeable with these offences A trial of one of these
easss has since occurred It occupied for many weeks
the attention of the Suprm Court of this District anE
we tutueud with great lest end abIlIty It resulted
tat a disagreement of the Jury but th eo h k u
again placed upon the calendar and will shortly be re
tried It any guilty persons shall finally escape punish
uent for their offences It will not be for lack ot diligent
and earnest efforts on ths part of the prosecution
I trust that soms agreement may be reached which
will speedily enable Congress with the concurrence of
the Executive to afford the commercial community the
benefit of a national bankrupt law

A KZUKDT WANTED
In the judgment of not a few who have given study
and reflection tn this mailer tha nation has outjrrown
the provisions which the Constitution has established
for filling the minor offices In ths public services But
whatever mar bs thought of Ihe wisdom or expediency
of changIng the fundamental law In this regard It Is ocr
sin that much relief may ke afforded not only to the
President and the heidi of the departments but to Sen
ators and Itepresentatlves In Congress by discreet legis
lation They would be protected In a great measure by
the bill now pending before the Senile or
by any other which should embody Us Im
portant features from Ihs pressure of personal
Importunity and from the labor ol examining
conflicting claims and pretensions of candidates
I trust that before the close of the present session some
decisive action may be taken for the correction of the
evils which Inhere In the present melhodi of appoint
ment and I assure you of my hearty cooperation In any
measures which are likely to conduce to that end As
to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official
life of the subordinate employees ot the Uovernmentlt
seems to be generally agreed thai whatever their extent
or character the one should be definite and the other
stable and lhat neither should be regulated by teal In
the service ot party or fidelity to the torlunes of an ludl

It matters little to ths people at large what competent
person Is at the head of this department or of that bu
reau If they feel assured that tile removal of cue and
ths accession of another will not Involve the retirement
ot honest and faithful subordinates whose duties are
purely administrative have legitimate connection
with the triumph of any political principles or the suc
cess anypolitical party or factleiii It Is I to this latter
class of officers thai the Senate bill to whIch I have al
ready referred exclusively applies while neither that
bill nor any other prominent scheme for Improving the
civil service concerns the higher grade of officials who
are appointed by the President and confirmed by the
Senate
REMovALS TOOK OTT1CE BY HATES OABFHLD
AND ARTHUR
I feet bound to correct a prevalent misapprehension
asm the frequency with which the present Executive
has displaced the Incumbent of an office and appointed
another In his stead It has been repeatedly alleged that
he has In this particular signally departed from the
course which has been pursued under recent adminis
trations of the lovernment The facts are as follows
The whole number of executive appointments during
the tour years Immediately preceding Mr Oar
fields accession lo the Presidency was 26l
ot this number 244 or nine per cent
Involved the removal ot previous Incumbents
Ths ratio of removals to the whole number of appoint
ments was much the same during each of those four
years In the first year with Ito appointments there
were 74 removals or 93 per cent tin the second with
tin appointments there were H3 removals or R 5 per
cent In the third with 40 appointments there were
48removals or 10 per cent In the fourth with 4J1 > ap
pointments there were 37 rcmov ale or 6 6 per cent in
the four months of President flarfields administration
there were ew appolnlmente and Ml removals or tl 7
percent Precisely the same number of removals 89
hss taken place In the fourteen months which have since
elapsed but they constitute only seven eighths of one per
cimt of the whole number of appointments ills within
that period or less than twosixths of the entire list of
officials o4si > exclusive of the army and navy which
are tilled by Presidential appointments
POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS
I declare my approval ot such legislation as may be
found necessary for supplementing the existing pro
visions of law In relation to political assessments In
July last I authorlred a public Announcement that em
plnvees of the lovernment should regard themselves as
at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or re
fusing to make political coutrlbutions and that
their action In that regard would In no manner affect
their official status In this announcement I acted upon
the view which I had always maintained and still main
tain that a public tiRlcer should be as absolutely free as
any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution
for lIme aid of the political party ot his choice
It has however been urged and doubt
less not without foundation In fact that by
solicitation of superiors stIll by other modes
such contributions have at times been obtained from
persons whose only motive for uric in has been the fear
of what might befall them If they refused It goes with
out saying that such contributions are not voluntary
and tn my judgment their collection should be prohib
lied bv law A bill which w 111 effectually suppress them
will receive my cordial approval
D1RTBICT OP COLUMBIA
I hope that however numerous and urgent may be the
demands upon your attention the Interests of this Dis
trict will not be ftirirnllen The denial to Its residents ot
the great right of suffrage In all Its relation to national
Slate and municipal action Imposes on Congress the
duty of affording them the best administration w lOch Its
wisdom can devise
The report of the District Commissioners Indicates cer
tain measnres whose adoption would seem to be very de
slrsbie t Instance In particular those which relate to
arrears of taxes to steam railroads and to assessments
of real property Among the questions which have been
the topic of recent debate In the halls ot Congress none
are of greater gravity than those relating to the ascer
tainment of the vote for Presidential hlectors and the
Intendment of the Constitution in its provisions for de
vlvlnir executive functions upon the Vice President
when the President suffers from inability to discharge
the powers and duties of his office I trust that no em
barrassments may result from a failure tu determine
these questions before another national election
The closing year han b en replete with blessings for
which we owe to the liver of all good our reverent ac
knowledgment berth uninterrupted harjnnuy of our
rote rn relation foe the decay of eectlcinal ani
mosities for the exuberance of our harvests
and the triumphs of our mining and manu
facturing Industries for the prevalence of health the
spread ot Intelligence and the conservation of the pub
Ito credit for the growth of the country In ail elements
of national greatness for these and countless other
blessings we should rejoice and be glad I trust that
under the Inspiration of this great prosperity our coun
sels may be harmonious and that the dictates of pru
dent patriotism justice and ecunotnv mav cnd tr the
adoption ot measures in which Ihe Congress and the
Executive may heartily unite CuxsTsa A AHTUCR

to bo tn no humor for anything but contompla

boon talking about the message hut nobody
seemed to care to hoar It read Tho public
reading of It Is an empty formality but mem
bers have been giving It a very careful study
tonight It has caused a good deal of talk
and on the whole Is well Broken of First ot all
every one Is laughing at Ulnlno Through his
faithful friend of the Iist ho cuitaed an Inter
view to bo published thus morning attacking tlte
Nicaraguan Canal sUnino This was done be
cause It was confidentially reported lust night
that the President would recommend the bill
which provides for guarantor a three per
cent Interest on tho bonds of tile Company
lllalne Intended to head off tile President
lien Arthur however dismisses tho mattci
with a comment that meets general approval
It may bo said hero that the friends of the
canal are pushing tho plan with vigor
It will be calledup In tlm Senate nn the
lUthoy Senator Miller of Colorado and If the
bill does not KO through It will not bu for lack
of vigorous lobbying within and without the
two Houses Ono enthusiastic friend nf thi
bill paid the Democrats tIle compliment of say
Ing that It must bo put through this wlnU or
burst That part of the message which deal
with the tiut81 Ion of tax reduction onuses
surprise rue Presidents courage In express
log views so radical as well ns tho skilful
manner ho has adopted in advancing them are
spnken of with commendation
Congress Is at sea In this matter This
has been forcibly demonstrated tonIght
In the comments members are making
about this part of the message Everybody
says that tuxes ought to bo reduced But
everybody poems to havo his own idea about
till amount the manner and tile time of re
duction and tn lie obstinately sure that every
one who ban admcient vlmv Is wrong Tills la
BO plain that It leads Illscoek Kaxgnn and
others to despair of iiiy action nt all The
recommendation which the Ptusldent nuikes
that tho lllvor and lltti bun appropriation

comment Many members have not rend It yet
