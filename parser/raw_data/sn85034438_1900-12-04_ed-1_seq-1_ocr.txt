AVASHINGTON. Dec. 3.?President ]___
ivlnlcy, in the opening paragraphs
ol hts message, reviews the pro
Cress of the country 'Irom the assembling
of the Sixth to that of the Fifty-sixth
Congress, and says:
"Education, religion and morality have
kept pa.ee -with oar advancement in other
directions, and while extending its power,
the Government has adhered to its foun?
dation principles and abated none of them
in dealing with our new peoplos and pos?
sessions."
Chinese Question.
Tiie first topic considered is the Chinese
question, regarding which is said:
"In our foreign intercourse the dominant
question has been the treatment of the
Chinese probiem. Apurt from this our
relations with the Powers have been
happy."
The President then reviews at length
the causes of the Boxer uprisings, their
growth and results, and treats with the
part taken hy the forces of the United
States in the recent troubles in the
Chinese Empire, saying: "'The United
States soldiers, sailors, and marines, of?
licers and men alike, in those distant
climes and unusual surroundings, showed
the same valor, discipline, and good con?
duct, and gave proof of the sume high de?
gree of intelligence and efficiency, which
have distinguished them in every emer?
gency,"
Mr. ?McKinley also ??ays: "The policy of
Uie I'nited Stales through all this trying
period was clearly mmouiiced and scrupu?
lously carried out. As was then said,
'The policy of the Government of the
"United States is to seek a solution which
may bring about permanent safety and
peace to China, preserve Chinese terri?
torial und administrative entity, protect
all rights guaranteed to friendly Powers
- by treaty and international ?law, and safe?
guard ior-tbe world the principle of equal
and impartial trade with all parts of the
Chinese Empire. ?Faithful to those pro?
fessions, which, as it proved, reflected the
views? and purposes of the other co-operat?
ing governments, all our eff 3rts have been
directed toward ending ihe anomalous
situation in China by negotiations for a
serttiement ut the earliest possible mo?
ment.
An Kssonlial Factor.
"I regard as one of the essential factors
of a durable adjustment the securement
of adequate guarantees for liberty of
faith, since insecurity of those native
who may embrace alien creeds as a
???.arcely less effectual assault upon the
rights of foreign worship and teaching
lhan would be the direct Invasion thereof.
"The matter of indemnity for cur
. wronged citizens is a question of grave
cor.-ccrn. Measured in money alene, a
sufficient reparation may prove to be
beyond the ability of China to meet. All
*he Powers concur in emphatic disclaim?
ers of any ^purpose of aggrandizement
through the dismemberment of the
empire. I am disposed to think that
due compensation muy be made in part
by Increased guarantees of 'security for
foreign rights and immunities, and, most
Important of all, by the opening of China
to -the equal commerce of all the world.
These views have ?been and will be ear?
nestly advocated Dy our representatives.
"The Government of Rysrfa has put
forward a suggestion, that in the event
of -protracted divergence of views in
regard to Indemnities the matter may be
relegated to the Court of Arbitration at
The Hague. 1 favorably incline to this,
believing lhat high,tribunal could not fail
to reach a solution no less conducive to
tho stability and enlarged prosperity cf
China itself than immediately beneliclal
to the Powers."
With Other Countries.
The President then considers our rela?
tions with other countries, referring par?
ticularly to the securing of patent rights
in foreign countries for American invent?
ors, the extension of postal facilities with
South -American countries, and mnprocal
trade rights with Brazil. He also refers
to the good-will existing between this
country and Prance, as displayed in the
Paris Exposition, the American exhibits
ranking second only.to those of France,
and entered In 100 out of 121 classes,
American exhibitors ?having secured:
Grand prizes. 240: gold medals, 597: siiver
mt?t?als. 776; 'bronze medals, 541; and hon?
orable mentions. 322?2,476 in all, being the
greatest total number given to the exhibit
of any exhibiting nation, as well as the
largest number in -each grade. ?Good?
will also prevails In our relations with
Great Britain and the German empire.
In referring to the Canadian and Alask?
an boundary disputes, Mr. McKinley
says:
"The work of marking certain provis?
ional points, for convenience of adminis?
tration, around the head of Lynn Canal,
in accordance with the temporary ar?
rangement of October 1R9??. was compl?*
ted by a joint survey in July last. The
modus vivendi has so far worked with?
out friction, and the Dominion Govern?
ment has provided rule? and regulations
for securing to our citizens the benefit
of the reciprocal stipulation that the citi?
zens or subjects of either power found by
that arrangement within the temporary
jurisdiction of the oilier shall suffer no
diminution of the rights and privileges
they have hitherto enjoyed. But however
necc-sary such an expedient may have
been to tide over the grave emerg.ncies
?of the situation, it is at best but an un
?satisfactory makeshift, which should not
be .suffered to delay the speedy and com?
plete establishment of the frontier line to
which we are entltkd under the Russo
__mer-caa treaty for the cession of Alaska.
IHltuite Boundary,
"la ?this relation I may refer again to
the need of definitely marking" the Alask?
an bouraiarv where it follows the one
hundred and forty-first meridian. A c?.n
vention to that end has been before the
Senate for son.* two year?, but as no ac?
tion hmm heen tak.n I con-empiate r.ego
tia.in? a new ?conventS-ii tor a Joint deter
mlnatlon of the meridian hy telegraph?
ic observations. These, It is ?believed, will
give more-accurate and usquestlonable re?
sults than the sidereal m&hods heretofore
independently .oltow-ed, which, as is
known, ?proved discrepant at several
points on the line, although not varying
at any place? more than TOO feet."
"Satisfactory progress has been made
toward the conclusion" of a general treaty
of friendship and intercourse with Spain,
in replacement of the old treaty, which
passed into abeyance by reason of the late
war. A new convention of extradition is
approaching completion, and I should be
?much pleased -were a commercial arrange?
ment to follow.
"A bill is now pending to elfect the re?
commendation made in my last Annual
Message that appropriate legislation be
had to carry Into .execution Article VU of
the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which
the United States assumed the payment of
certain claims for indemnity of its citizens
against Spain. I ask that action be ta?
ken to fulfil this Obligation.
The oniy reference to our present rela?
tions with Turkey reads: "We await the
fuiliiment of the promise of the Sultan to
make reparation for the injuries suffered
by American citizens in Armenia and
elsewhere in the Turkish Empire. His
Majesty's good disposition In this regard
has been evinced toy the issuance o? an
irade for rebuilding the Americla col?
lege ut Harpoote."
The reference to trade relation., with
foreign countries reads: "The policy of
reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the
principles of international equity and has
been so repeatedly approved by the peo?
ple of the.United States that there ought
to be no hesitation in either branch of the
Congress in giving to it fui! effect. This
Government desires to preserve the most
just and amicable commercial relations
wJth all foreign countries, unmoved by
the industrial rivalr.es necessarily de?
veloped in the expansion of international
trade. It is believed that the -foreign gov?
ernments generally entertain the same pur?
pose, although in some instancias there are
clamorous demands upon them for legisla?
tion specifically hostile to American inter?
ests. Should the.?-*e demands prevail I shall
communicate with the Congress with the
view of advising such legislation as may
be necessary to meet the emergency."
The President also refers to the good
acco-mp.'is-ied by the Bureau of American
Republics and the practical utility of the
consular service in obtaining a wide range
of information as to the industries and
commerce of other countries and oppor?
tunities afforded Americans. He a'.?o pre?
dicts the accomplishment of much good
through the Pan-Ame'rlcnn Exposition.
As to Lynching..
The President urges that Congress con?
fer on the Federal Courts jurisdiction in
cases of mob-violence, where the Federal
Government may be involved. He states
that in the lynchings of five Italians at
Tallulah, La., though repeated Inquests
have been held, successive grand juries
have ?failed to indict, and in view of the
fact that no indictments will likely be
made, that Congress make "gracious pro?
vision for indemnity to the Italian suf?
ferers."
Says tho President: "In my inaugural
addrc.-?*, I referred to the general sub?
ject of lynching in these words:
" 'Lynching must not be tolerated in a
great and civilized country like the United
States; courts, not mobs, must execute
the penaities of the lu.w. The preserva?
tion of public order, the right of discus?
sion, the integrity of courts, and the or?
derly administration of justice -must con?
tinue eforever the rock of safety upon
whieh our Government securely rests.'
"Tliis I most urgently reiterate and again
invite ,the_ atten.'?_e__a,__Df .iny countrymen to
this reproach*"upon our civilization."
Tho Nfcaragaat* Canal.
President McKinley says: "The all-im
portant matter of un interoceanic canal
has assumed a new phase. Adhering to
its refusal to reopen the question of the
forfeiture of the contract of the Maritime
Canal Company, which was terminated for
alleged non-execution in October. 1S99, the
Government of Nicaragua has since sup?
plemented that action bv declaring ttie

BATTLE BEFORE ~~
BOARD TO-NIGHT
Aldermen to Consider Ordinance Al?
lowing Traction Company's Cars
to Run on Main Street.
The Board of Aldermen will. meet to?
night to consider the ordinance granting
the Richmond Traction Company ohe
right to operate cars on the Main Street
tracks of the Richmond Passenger and
Power Company. No boisterous demon?
strations, such as were -witnessed1 last
Tuesday night, when the matter was be?
fore the Common Council, will be per?
mitted.
""If there should be any hissing or
other demonstrations to-night, I shall
have the hall cleared," averted
President Turpin yesterday. "Wo pro?
pose to have an orderly session, and the
business shall be conducted in a business?
like way."
"No. 1 cannot tell whether arguments
by counsel representing the J.wo com?
panies will be heard. That matter will
be determined ?by the Board when it
meets. I am not advised as to how any
of the members of the body are going to
vote on the question ot* allowing the Rich?
mond Traction Company to run its cars
over the Main Street tracks of the Pas?
senger and Power Company."
lt is thought by most persons who have
looked on without being interested in the
fight, beyond the interest felt as a citi?
zen, that the contest in the Board will
be very close. Some of those working for
the Traction Company make the claim of
14 to 4 for the ordinance, others say It
will be 12 to 6. Passenger and Power
Company representatives say this is
mere talk, but will nof give out any fig?
ures.
There Is some talk of other amend?
ments to the ordinance, but no definite
idea as to their purport has been obtained.

HOUSEBREAKER
CHARLES DAVIS
Makes a Desperate At?
tempt to Break Jail.
CAUGHT IN THE ACT.
Broke Through the Crumbling Ceiling
of His Cell.
WITH SHACKLES ON HIS ANKLES,
Would Probably Have Made His
Escape from tho Old Prison hut
for Prompt Action on the
Part of the Guards and
Deputies? Details
of the Attempt
?Charles Davis, the housebreaker and
burgler, who has been confined in the city
jail for about two weeks, pending trial
for breaking into a number of business
houses, made a desperate attempt to breuk
jail last night, and but for prompt ac?
tion on the part of the guards and sev?
eral of his fellow prisoners he would
probably have succeeded.
Davis was placed in his cell, one of tho
most secure in the old, broken down pris?
on, on the second floor, and on the inside.
He was .shackled, as he has been since it
became known that he was such a des?
perate character.
-VU seemed well in tho cell on the early
rounds of the turnkey, until at 7:t0 o'clock
when the guard made his rounds.
MADE THE DISCOVERY.
He looked into the cell and observed on
the floor an object that in some respects
resembled a human figure, _but its outlines
were unnatural. He sho'ved his light
nearer and ?saw a lot of plaster on the
floor in the extreme corner near the win?
dow lhat opened into the inner court.
His heart beat faster and he opened the
door and hastily examined the mass on
the floor. This turned out to be the cell
bucket and the blanket, rolled so as to
give some natural semblance to u human
ligure, and in the ceiling he found a
large hole made by Davis by climbing up
the ?bars in the window.
The alarm was at once given by the
guard, and Deputy Taylor, who was on
duty, summoned Sergeant Smith. The
Chief of Police was notified and the vari?
ous station-houses were called up and put
on the alert.
Then a force was organized of the
guards, the trusties and one or two pris?
oners who could be depended upen. A
large hole was knocked in the ceiling and
a number of men were sent upon the roof.
Several men volunteered to get up into
the hole nnd crawl over under the tin
roof to search for the missing man. The
alleged bunco man, "Lowery, was one of
the latter, and he worked harcl?
EXCITEMENT _-_E-.i-_.ED.
All the time the greatest excitement
reigned among those in the jail. The
news that Davis hr.d escaped spread rap?
idly, und strange as it may seem, all the
prisoners appeared anxious to help re?
capture him.
For an hour the men under the roof
worked ln dust and lime, and finally
Davis was located crouched away back
in the farthest corner. When found he
made no resistance, but came down all
cowed und disheartened, and covered with
soot ?o that he resembled a darkey or a
chimney sweep.
He ivas carried into the office for awhile.
Detective Gibson was standing near him.
"You can't blame me for trying to get
awuy," he said to'the Detective.
"Xo; 1 admire your nerve," he said.
MADE MORE SECURE.
Davis was then placed in the most se?
cure cell in the jail, that in which mur?
derers are usually kept. He refused to
talk, but lapsed into stolid indifference.
?He was indicted by the grand jury yes?
terday, and it is probable that he will be
tried to-day in the Hustings Court so that
he can be taken away from the insecure
building that is a bad excuse ?for a jail.
It is a question whether he could have
made good his escape even had he gotten
on the roof or into the street, for he car?
ried heavy shackle.s on his ankles.
"He is a desperate man," said Detec?
tive Wren, "and the sooner they get him
away from this place the better it will be
for the community."
?By 9:30 o'clock everything at the jail
had assumed its normal condition.

COUNCIL ADOPTS
THE CURFEW LAW
Mr.' Glenn's Bill Passed
by That Body.
VOTE IS VERY CLOSE.
Mr. West Changes on Roll Call and
the Ordinance is Agreed Upon,
TO ABATE THE DOG NUISANCE.
Mr. Bloomberg Submits a Paper iu
This Connection, Which Is Refer?
red to Finance Committee?Pro?
position to Let City Employes
Stop Work at 2 P. M?
Saturdays,
The Common Council, during the course
of a long and tedious session last night,
adopted the Glenn curfew ordinance, re?
quiring all .children under lifteen years
of age to be off the streets by S:30 P. 31.
in winter time and by 9 P. M. in summer
time. When Clerk August finished the
roll-call on the measure the vote stood
thirteen to thirteen, and would have been
lest iuad not Councilman John T. "Wast
changed his vote from no to aye. Mr.
West was promptly followed in this re?
spect by Mr. S. H. Cottrell, and the ballot
as announced was fifteen ayes to eleven
nays.
The Council first heard the report of the
Committee on Streets authorizing the hear?
ing of a. number of allegations for street
improvements, which were authorized.
After some discussion the resolution pro?
viding for the r?-establishment of a grade
on Pleasants Street was recommended to
the Committee on Streets."
The City Attorney was directed to take
such action as he might deem necessary
to re<M*>ver from the Richmond Traction
Company and the Richmond Passenger
and Power Company such sums as these
companies hare caused in damage to city
property during ?the current year.
FOR STREET WORK.
From the Street Committee also came
some resolutions providing for street im?
provements and making appropriations for
the same as follows:
Appropriating .$261 from the fund for
paving alleys for owners to pave thi alley
on the east slide of First Street, between
Main and Franklin Streets.
Appropriating $140 from the furd for
paving alleys for owners to pave the alley
on the south sido of Clay Street, between
Twenty-third Street and Church Hill Ave?
nue.
Both these were adopted, but ar. ordi?
nance from the Committee on Relief of
the Poor, providing compensation lor the
cook of the colored almshouse, was, on
motion of Mr. Canst; referred to the Com?
mittee on Finance. This ordinance does
not create a ne>w position, but allows pay
for a. old one, which he heretofore has
tilled without pay.
The Council agreed to .resolutions ap?
propriating $1,500 to purchase coal to be
distributed through the city mission to the
poor of the city, and appropriating $500
to purchase coal and fuel for the colored
poor of Richmond.
A resolution appropriating $450 from the
contingent fund for the purpose of satis?
fying a judgment recently obtained by F.
H. Jackson against the city in the Law
and Equity Court, was adopted.
The Council agreed to give forty trees
from the city nursery to the Masonic
Home of Virginia.
F. ?M. Conner was paid $100 for the tres?
pass of the city upon his property at No.
320 West G-race Street by the location of
a tool-house upon the same.
INCREASE FOR LIGHT.
From the Committee on Finance also
came the recommendation that $12.000 be
appropriat??d for the coal and oil account
of the gas works, and appropriating $350
to the electric light account of the same
department. Mr. Caskie explained that
the deficit in the coal and oil account of
the gas-works was due to the fact that
oil had gone up from about 2% cents per
gallon to 7 cents per gallon since the
budget for 1900 was made up, and that the
cemmittee had also had to contend with
the fact that the consumption of gas this
year had exceeded that of last year by
about IS.000,000 cubic feet. The recommen?
dations of the Finance Committee were
approved.
FONDS FOR NEW HOUSE.
At the solicitation of the Committee on
Water, through chairman C. W. Tanner,
the Council recommended that the Com?
mittee on Finance, in making up the an?
nual budget for the year 1S01, reappro?
priate, for the purpose of erecting a house
for the keeper of Marshall Reservoir, the
sum of $n.5K), set aside for this purpose in

mit To-Night.
It ?seems almost certain the "Brother?
hood Home," which has beeu contempl?t-,
ed by the local chapter of the Brother?
hood of St. Andrew, will be established in
Richmond within Uie next few months.
At the last meeting of the Brotherhood,
held a few weeks ago, a special commit?
tee was appointed to investigate and to
report concerning the advisability of such
an undertaking. This committee, which
is composed of Messr.s. H. L. Valentine,
Bugen? C. Mass?ie, Power., Cook and
Hardwicke, has held several meetings and
is now ready to make a complete report
and recommend that the '"Brotherhood
Home" be established.
Ttie location of the home is not yet de?
cided upon, but it will be centrally lo?
cated in one of three buildings which the
committee has ln view. Th*.?*. committee
will report to a called meeting of the
Brotherhood to be held to-night in the lec?
ture-room of Grace "Episcopal Church.
A member of the committee stated last

(By Associated Press.)
*WA"__i_NGTO_-, Dec. 3.?The opening of
Congress at noon to-day drew great
crowds to the Capitol. On June 7th last
the 'first se-sion of the fifty-sixth Congress
a.jciirned. and the second session began
to-day with many momentous questions
awaiting the attention of the national law?
makers. Early in the day the tide of
travel turned down Pennsylvania Avenue
toward the Capitol, and by 11 o'clock the
galleries were overflowing.
There were a number of early confer?
ences among the Senators and Representa?
tives as to the week"s programm?. Speak?
er Henderson arrived at 11:15, and was
?oon surrounded by members. Most of the
army of spectators ilocfet. to the House
side.
BRILLIANT SCENE.
Desks of Members Freighted Down
AYitli Flowers.
(By Associated Tress.)
WASHINGTON, December 3.?Girded by
overflowing galleries, bathed in light from
the stained glass windows overhead, the
hall ot Representatives presented a bril?
liant spectacle when Speaker Henderson
called the second session of the Fifty-sixth
Congress to order at noon to-day. The
desks of half the members were freighted
with flowers. The wealth and beauty of
the capital, gow'ned in smart winter frocks,
were in the galleries. The fiorai pieces
were of infinite variety. The great pro?
portion were on the Republican side.
As the hands of the clock, opposite the
Speaker's desk, pointed to noon, the
Speaker ascended the rostrum and called
the Hcuse to order. Then the blind chap?
lain lifted up his voice in prayer. The
?chaplain referred feelingly to the deaths
of-tho late Representatives Daly, of New
Jersey, and Hoeffecker, of Delaware, which
occurred during the recess.
GREAT CONFUSION.
After'the prayer the clerk called the roll.
The confusion became so great that the
clerk could not hear the responses and the
?Speaker ivas obliged several times to call
for order. The usual notifications were re?
ceived from the Senate that it was ready
for business and had appointed Senators
to wait on the President.
The Speaker announced that 2.5 mem
?bers had responded to their names, a
quorum, and the House was ready for busi?
ness. The following members-elect then
appeared at the bar of the House and
took the oath o*_ allegiance:
Albert D. Shaw, who succeeds the late
Representative Chickering, of New York;
Allen F. McDermott, who succeeds the late
Representative Daly, of New Jersey ; Wal?
ter O. Hoeffecker, who succeeds the late
Representative Hoeffecker, of Delaware;
Edward DeX. (Morrei!, who succeeds the
late Representative iHarmer, of Pennsyl?
vania; William -Richardson, who succeeds
General Joe Wheeler, ot Alabama; W. H.
Jackson, who succeeds Governor Smith, of
'Maryland; Sawuel D. Woods, who succeeds
Representative DeVries, of California.
-BAILEY ON HIS FEET.
(Mr. ?Bailey, of Texas, questioned the
form of the resignation of Representative
?Dolliver, whose successor, Mr. J. P. Con?
nor, was present. He said- he doubted the
right of a member to resign at a future
fixed date. He said he would not raise
the point formally, but merely call atten?
tion to it, so that in future it could not
be used as a ?precedent.
Mr. Dolliver's resignation, he said, had
been tendered to take eirect December
1st, so that Mr. Connor had been elected
to fill a vacancy which did not exist at the
time of the election. He cited a court de?
cision to show that a resignation, in fact,
was but a notification of a resignation
to be made in the future.
The speaker stated that inasmuch as ob?
jection had been made Connor would step
aside until the protest had b-en disposed
of.
The Speaker announced the appointment
: of Mr. Babcock, of Wisconsin, on the Com
; mittee on Ways an?? -.?.eans, to succeed
Mr. Dolliver.
The Spsaker appointed Messrs. Payne
(Rep.), Grosvenor (Rep.), of Ohio, and
Richardson (Dem.), of Tennessee, to join
the committee cif the Senate to wait on the
President.
The clerk of the Hcu.">e also was directed
to give similar notice to the Senate, after
which recess was.taken until 2 o'clock.
NO DEMONSTRATIONS. ?
On reassembling Mr. Payne announced
