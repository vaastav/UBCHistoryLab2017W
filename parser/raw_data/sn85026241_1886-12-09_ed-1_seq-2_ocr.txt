The movement to abolish spring elec

In lb southern and western portions
of the State, especially the corn regions,
tt-ere is a marked decrease in acres of
wheat sown, occasion! by tbe corn be
in badly blown down, and not cut up
and 800. ked, to make re-tdy for wheat.
In the grass regions of the State, w here
much : the pasture was killed by
drouth and the grub worm, and where
fall seeding for" timothy failed, wheat
has been soa and repealed, thus in
creasing the acreage corresponding to
the loss in the corn districts, so that, on
the whole, the wheat acreaafl for the
St:tfi is estimated as very slightly in
creased over lust ye.tr. The condition
of the wbnat plant is a little below a full
average. In some parts it is small and
tender, but on the whole, generally
healthy and goes into "Winter in good
conditiou.
Of other crop9 there is nothing eoecial
to report, except that given in the Az
ures and in rormr reports.
The condition of live stock, except,
bogs, is generally good. The low aver
age condition, (90 p?r cent ,) is due al
most wholly to cholera among Imga, the
disease prevailing in 23 counties of the
State. In some of the more important
bog growing districts, the loss is estitna
&d as high as 50 percent.
Congressâ€”The Message.
The 49tu, Congress began its second
session on Monday. In both houses
mo.st of tbe tiiiiO was consumed by tbe
reading of tbe Presidents Message.
The doenment is more notable for its
length and straddling, than for its
strength. Below are extracts from the
paper, of special interest to the people
of this section :
In my last annual message to Con
gresa attention was directed to the lact
inat the revenue of tbe government
exceeded its actual needs, and it was
suggested tbat legislative action should
be taken to relieve the people from tbe
uLnecesary burden of taxation made
appaieut. In view uf the pressing im
portance ot tbe subject I deem it my
duty to again urge its consideration.
The income of the government by its
increased volume, ana through econo
mies in its collection, is now more than
ever in excess of public necessities. Tbe
application of the surplus to tbe pay
inent of such portion of tbe public debt
as is now at our option subject to extin
guishment, if continued at tbe rate
which has latelv prevailed, would retire
tbat class of indebtedness in less than
one year from this date. Thus a con
linuation of our present revenue system
would soon result in tbe receipt of an
annual income much greater than nec
essary to meet government expenses.
with no indebtedness upon which it
could be applied. We should then be
confronted with avast quantity of mon
ey, the circulating medium of tbe peo
ple, boarded in the treasury, when it
should be in their bands, or we should
ue drawn into wasteful public extrava
gance, with all the corruption national
demoralization which follows in its
train.
But it is not tbe simple existence of
this surplus and its threatened attend
ant evils which furnish tbe strongest ar
gument against our present scale of fed
eral taxation. Its worst phase is tbe
exaction of such a surplus through a
perversion of tbe relations between tbe
people and tbeir government, and a dan
gerous departure from the rules which
limit tbe right of federal taxation. Good
government, and especially the govern
ment of which every American citizen
boasts, has for its object tbe protection
of every person witnin its care iu tbe
greatest liberty consistent with the good
order of society and his perfect security
in the enjoyment of his earnings
with the least possible diminuatton lor
public needs. ben more uf the peo
ple's substance is exacted through the
form of taxation than is necessary to
meet the just obligations of the govern
ment and the expense of its economical
administration, such exaction becomes
ruthless extortion and a violation of tbe
fundamental principles of a free gov
ernment Tbe indirect manner in
which these exactions are made has a
teudency to conceal their true charac
ter and their extent, but we have arrived
at a state of superfluous revenue which
has aroused the people to a realization
f tbe fact that the amount raised pro
fessedly for the support of the govern
ment is paid by them as absolutely, if
..tided to tbe price of the things which
supply their daily wants, a3 if it wa3
paid at tixed periods into the baud of
the tax gatuerer. Those who ton for
daily wages are beginning to understand
that capital, though sometimes vaunting
ts importance and clamoring for tbe
protection and lavor of the gov-
rument, is dull and sluggish, till, touch
ed by tbe magical hand of labor, it
springs into activity furnishing au occa
sion lor teiie rat taxation ana gaming
the value which enables it to bear its
burden. And . tbe laboring man is
thoughtfully inquiring whether, in these
circumstances, and considering the trib
ute be constantly pays into the public
treasury as be supplies bis daily watitf,
he receives his fair share of advantages.
Ihere is also a suspicion abroad, that
the surplus of our revenues indicates
abnormal and exceptional business prof
its which, under the system which pro
duces such surplus, increase without
corresponding benefit to people at large
and are the vast accumulations of a few
among our citizens whose fortunts, riv
aling the wealth of the most favored in
anti-Democratic nations are not tbe nat
ural growth of a steady, plain and in
dustrious republic. Our farmers, too,
and those engaged directly and indirect
ly in supplying the products of agricul
ture, see that day by day, and as often
us the daily wants of their households
recur, they are forced to pay excessive
and needless taxation, while their prod
ucts struggle in foreign markets with
the competition of nations, which, by
allowing a freer exchange of productions
than we permit, enable their people to
sell for prices which distress the Araer
lean farmer.
As every patriotic citizen rejoices in
the constantly increasing pride of our
people in American citizenship and in
tbe glory of our national achievements
and progress, sentiment prevails that
the leading strings useful to a nation in
its infancy, may well be, to a great ex
lent discarded in the present stage of
American ingenuity, courage and fear
less self-reliance; and. for the privilege
of indulging ia this sentiment with true
American enthus'asro, our citizens are
quite wiping to forego an idle surplus
in the public treasury. All the people
know the average rate of federal taxa
tion upon imports is toJay, in time of
peace, but little less, while upon some
articles of necessary consumption it is
actually more than was imposed by the
grievous burden, willingly borne, at a
time when the government needed
millions to maintain by war the safety
and integrity of the Uuion.
1
is
REVISION OF REVENUE LAWS.
It has been tbe policy of tbe govern
meet to collect the priucipal part of its
revenues by a tax upon imports, and no
cbange in this policy is desirable. But
the present condition of affairs con
straius our people to demand tbat, by a
revision of our reveuue laws, the recipts
of tbe government thall be reduced to
the necessary expense of its economical
administration, and this demand should
be recognized and obeyed by the peo
ple's representatives in the legislative
branch, of the government.
In readjusting tbe burdens of federal
taxatiou, a sound public policy requires
tnat sucn of our citizens as have built
up large and important industries un
der present conditions, should not be
suddenly, and to their injury, depiived
of advantages to which they have adapt
ed their business; but if the public good
requires it. they should be content with
such consideration as shall deal fairly
and cautiously with their interests,
while Hie just demand of the people for
relief from needless taxation is honestly
answered. A reasonable and timely
submission to such a demand should
certainly be possible without a disastr
ous shock to any interest; and a careful
concession sometimes averts abrupt and
heedless action, often the outgrowth of
impatience and delayed justice.
Due regard should be also accorded in
any proposed readjustment to the inter
ests of American 1 ibor go far as they
are involved, We congratulate oui
selve3 tbat tb-re ia among us no labor
ing class fixed iu unyielding bounds and
doomed under all conditions in tbe inex
orable fate of daily toil. We realize in
labor a chief factor in the wealth, of tbe
Republic, and we treat those who have
it iu tneir keeping as citizens entitled to
the moiit Careful regjrd and thoughtful
attention. Thie regard and attention
should be awardad them, not only be
cause labor is tbe capital uf our work
ing men justlr entitled to its share of
govern noeuf favor, but for the further
us
n
and not less important reason that the
laboring mau, surrounded by bis family
in his bumble home, as a customer, is
vi ally interested in all liiat cheapens
the cost of living and enables him to
onng within his domestic circle addi
tional comforts and advantages.
This reialiou of the workingman to
tbe revenue laws of tbe country and tbe
manner in hich it palpably influences
the question of wages, should cot be
forgotten in the justifiable prominence
given to the proper maintenance of tbe
supply and protection of well-paid labor,
and these considerations suggest such au
arrangement of government revenues as
shall reduce the expense of living, while
it does not curtail the opportunity for
work nor reduce the compensation of
American labor and injuriously affect
its condition and the dignified place it
holds in tbe estimation of our people.
But our farmers and agriculturists those
whom from tbe soil produce the things
consumed by all, are perhaps more 01
rectly and plainly concerned than any
other of our citizens, in a just and care
ful system of federal taxation. Those
actually engaged in and more remotely
connected with this kind of work, num
ber nearly one half of our population
None labor harder or more continuously
than they. No enactmeuts limit their
hours of toil, and no interposition of the
government enhances, to 1 any great
extent, tbe value of tbeir products, and
yet for many of tbe necessaries and
comforts of life, which the most scru
pulous economy enables them to bring
into tbeir homes, and for tbeir imple
ments of husbandry, they are obliged to
pay a priee largely mcreased by an tin
natural profit which by the action of tbe
government is given to the more favored
manufacturer.
l recommend tbat, keeping in view
all these considerations, the increasing
and unnecessary surplus of national in
come annually accumulating, be releastd
to the people by an amendment to our
revenue laws which shall cheapen tbe
price of the necessaries of life and give
freer entrance to such imported mate
rial as by American labor may be manu
factured into marketable commodities.
Nothing can be accomplished however.
in tbe direction of this much needed
reform, unless the subject is approached
in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the
interest of tbe entire country and with
willingness to yield something for
the public good.

The maxt feiexds of Miss Airgie Beall (who
sustained severe injuries a month since hv be
ing thrown from her horse) will be glad to
learn that she is now able to walk about the
house, and that hopes are entertained that she
will soon regain her health and strength. Xo
one stands higher at a young lady of true worth,
and all regret the painful injuries whh-h she
has suffered from the accident.
Miss Mart Ci lbertson, after a long and pain
ful suffering, died at her home in this town on
Saturday evening, and the funeral took place
on Mondav at 1 1 o'clock. She was a member
of the Presbvterian congregation at Crabapple,
and her pastor. Rev. G. S. Uackett, assisted by
Rev. J. C. Scouller, of the C. P. church, con
ducted divine eervice, ana Mr. Dawson, of New
Alliens, acted as funeral director. The burial
casket wa verj handsome, and kind hands had
spared no pains to p.epare the boJv for its last
resting place and dress it iu a rich, neat and
becoming manner. Miss Culbetrson was a
sister of Mr. James Culltertsun, of Harrison
county, and was also well known to many in
the vicinity of Oak Dale. She bore her suffer
ings patiently.
Miss Mattik Bell, who has been seriously
ill for ome time, at the home of Mr. John
Stewart, near St. Clairsville, came up to her
sister's, Mrs. Caldwell, on Thanksgiving day.
Although not suffering so much pain, her con
dition is not improved, and her recovery will
be tedious. Miss Bell is a popular and suc
cessful teacher, and was forced by illness to
give up a pleasant and profitable position She

Missouri, whose front name is John, sent a
pair of wild deer to his friends a few months
since, and then came up to the ''old neighbor
hood" to see how his dear was getting along.
Being popular among his friends, a number of
them were invited to the hospitable home of
Mr. P., at Oak Dale, and a grand hunt for
phessants, quail, rabbits and ground squirrels
was to come off on Thursday last. The clergy,
the law and the grange shouldered their guns
and repaired to the place at the hour appointed,
but "Rude Boreas" was out hunting for fresh
ears and noses that day, and under these cir
cumstances fhe gentlemen concluded that
"flight was the better part of valor," and re
paired to a warm fire iu the parlor where they
cnccrtully awaited the air:val ol the rabbits

A Common Cold
Is often the beginning of serious allec
tious of the Throat, Bronchial Tubes,
and Langs. Therefore, the importance
of early and effective treatment cannot
be overestimated. Ayer's Cherry Pec
toral may always be relied tion for the
speedy cure of a Cold or Coujjh.
Last January I was attacked with a
severe Cold, which, by neglect and fre
quent exposures, lt-anie worse, finally
nettling on my lnnt'S. A tcrriMe cougii
soon followed, accompanied by pains in
the chest, from which I suffered intense
ly. After trying various remedies, with
out obtaining reliefi I commenced taking
' Ayer's Cherry Pectoral, and was
Speedily Cured.
I am satisfied fi-at this remedy saved my
life. Jno. Webster, Pawtncket, It. I.
I contracted a severe cold, which
suddenly developed into Pneumonia,
presenting dangerous and obstinate
symptoms. My physician ordered the
use of Ayer's Cherry Pectoral. His in
structions were followed, and the result
was a rapid and permanent cure.
II. E. Stiinpson, Itogers Prairie, Tex.
Two years ago I suffered from a severe
Cold, which settled on my Lungs. I con
sulted various physichms, and took the
medicines They prescribed, but received
only temporary relief. A friend induced
me to try Ayer's Cherry Pectoral. After
taking two bottles of this medicine I was
cured. Since then I have given the Pec
toral to uiy children, and consider it

Robert Vanderpool, Meadyille, Pa.
Some time ago I took a slight Cold,
which, being neglected, grew worse, and
settled on my Lungs. I hail a hacking
cough, and was very weak. Those who
knew me Inst considered my liu; to bo
in great danger. I continued to suffer
until I commenced using Ayer's Cherry
Pectoral. Less than one buttle of this
valuable medicine cured nie, and I
feel that I owe tlie preservation of my
