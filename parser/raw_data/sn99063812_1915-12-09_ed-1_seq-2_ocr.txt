through the ancient of the Qardea of
Eden to tbe Perslaa Oulf.
Tho lirltlsh defeat around llagdad,
lint Indicated In dispatches from
United Press Correspondent Acker-
titan at Berlin, came at a time when It
seemed the city must fall Into British
hands. The Germans ssM tbe defeat
wiis due to a revolt of the Arabs; tbe
British as a result ot overwhelming
forces of tbe enemy, i'robably both
versions are to aa extent true.
For the moment the British are safe
in tbe strongly fortlrted town ot Kut-ot-Tmara,
160 miles r.oith ot tho Per
sian Oulf. Now tbe British are In po
sition to ship supplies la large steam
ers to tbe Gulf, and theace ta small

while the Turks must ship their sup
ylles from Constantinople, 1,600 miles
to Bagdad, via a- railway which baa a
