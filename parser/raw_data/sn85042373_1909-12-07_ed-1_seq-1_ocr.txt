Washington, Dec. 7.—The first an- original and ad1

delivered to:congress today. It was
presented in both houses by Assistant
Secretary Latta and in both cases
was received shortly after 12 o'clock.
In the senate, when the reading of
the message- began at 12:12 p. m.,
great interest was manifested by
both Republicans and Democrats.
There was a full attendance of sena

as. soon as copies of the docunlent
had Un furnished the senators rivet

pages. While the secretary of the
senate read the president's words
many senators hastened over the
pamphlet hunting for the subject in
which the' senators were especially
interested. Others proceeded in the
more orderly way of following the

President's Message.
To the Senate and the House of Rep
resentatives:
The relations of the United States
with all foreign governments have
continued upon the normal basis of
amity and good understanding, and
are..very generally satisfactory.
Pursuant to the provisions of the
igeneral treaty of arbitration conclud
ed: between the United StateB and
-Greiftt Britain, April 4, 1908, a special
.agreement was entered into between
.the, two countries on January 27, 1909,
for the submission of questions relat
ing to the fisheries on the North At
lantic coast to a tribunal to be formed
.from members, of the permanent court
of arbitration at'The Hague.
In accordance with the provisions
of the special agreement the printed
case of each government
waB,
on Oc­
tober 4 last, submitted to the other
and to the arbitral tribunal at The
Hague, and the counter case of the
.United States is now in course of
preparation.
The American rights under the fish
eries article of the treaty of .1818
have, been a cause of difference be
tween the United States and Great
Britain for nearly seventy years. The
interests involved are of great im
portance to the American fishing in
dustry, and the final -settlement of
the controversy will remove a source
of constant "irritation arid complaint.
This is the first case involving such
great international questions which
has been submitted to the permanent
court of arbitration at The Hague.
The convention' providing for the
settlement of international differences
between the United States and Canada,
including the apportionment between
the two countries of certain of the
boundary waters and .the appointment'
of commissioners to adjust certain
other questions, signed on the 11th
day of January, v.1909, and to the rati
fication. of which the senate gave its
advice and consent on March 3, 1909.
has not yet been ratified on* the part
of Great Britain.
Negotiations for an international
conferenceto consider and reach an
arrangement providing for the preser
vation and protection of the fur seals
lit the north Pacific are in progress
with the governments of Great Brit
ain, Japan and Russia. The attitude.
of the governments Interested leads
me to, hope-for a satisfactory settle

outcome of .the negotiations.
Congo Trouble.
The ^question arising out of the Bel
gian annexation of the Independent
atate of the Congo, which has so long
and eiarneitly preoccupied the atten

the sympathy o( our citizens, is still
open, but In a more hopeful stage.
This government was among the fore

ability of the governments^ of Peru consultation,

partment of state and the foreign ser
vice, is lending all proper support to
legitimate and beneficial American
'enterprises in foreign countries, the
degree of such support being measur
ed' by the national advantages to be
expected. A citizen himself can not
•by contract or otherwise divest him
self of the right, nor can this govern
ment escape the obligation, of his
protection in his personal and proper
ty rights when these are unjuBtly in
fringed in a foreign country. To
avoid ceaselesB vexations it is proper
that in considering whether American
enterprise Bhould be encouraged or
supported in a particular country, the
government should give full weight
not only to the national, as opposed
to the individual benefits to accrue,
but also to the fact whether or not
the government of the country in
question is in its administration and
in its diplomacy faithful to the prin
ciples of moderation, equity and jus
tice upon which depend international
credit, in diplomacy as well as in fi
nance.
The pan-American policy of this
government has long been fixed in its
principles and remains unchanged.
With the changed circumstances of
the United States and of the republics
-to the south of us, most of which have
great natural resources, stable gov
ernment and progressive ideals, the
apprehension which gave rise to the
.Monroe doctrine may be said to have
nearly disappeared, and neither the
doctrine as it exists nor any other
doctrine of American policy should
.be permitted to operate for the per
petuation of irresponsible government,
the escape of just obligations, or the
insidious allegation of dominating am
bitions on ihe part of the United'
States.
BeBide the fundamental doctrines
•qf our pan-American policy there have
grown up a realization of political in
terests, community of institutions and
Jde&is, and a flourishing commerce.
.All these bonds will- be greatly
strengthened as time goes on and in
creased faclities, such as the great
bank soon to be established In Latin
.America, supply the means for build
ing- up' colossal intercontinental com
merce ot the. future.

^ore Hague tribu-
nal.
On July 30, 1909, the govenment of
Panama agreed, after considerable
negotiation, to indemnify the relatives
of the American officers and sailors
who were brutally treated, one of them
having, indeed, been killed by the
Panaman police this year.
The sincere desire of the govern
mrit to do away with a situation whre
such an accident could occur is mani
fest in the recent request in compli
ance with which this government has
lent the services of an officer of the
army to be employed by the govern
ment of Panama as instructor of po
lice.
Cuban Sanitation.
The sanitary improvements and pub
lic works undertaken in Cuba prior
to the present administration of that
government, in the success of which
the United States is interested under
the treaty, are reported to be making*
good pfogress and since the congress
provided for the continuance of the
reciprocal commercial arrangement
between Cuba and the United States
assurance has been received that no
negotiations injuriously affecting the
situation will be undertaken without
Central America.
Sihce the Washington conventions
of 1907 were communicated to the
government of the United States as a
consulting and advising party, this
government has been almost continu
ously called upon by one or another,
and in turn by all of the five Central
American republics, to exert itself for
the maintenance of the conventions.
Nearly every complaint has been
against the Zelaya government of Ni
caragua. which has kept Central
America in constant tension or tur
moil. The responses made to the rep
resentations of Central American re
publics. as due from the United States
on accoynt of its relation to the Wash
ington conventions, have been at all
times conservative and have avoided
so far as possible, any semblance of
intereference, although it is very ap
parent that the considerations of geo
graphic proximity to the Canal zone
and of the very substantial American
Interests in Central America give to
the United States a special position
in the zone of these republics and the
Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace arid welfare among 'these re
publics, efforts which are fully appre
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true interests, it

would be no less unnecessary to re
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression alleg
ed to have been committed by the Ze
laya government. Recently two Amer
icans were put to death by order of
President Zelaya himself. They were
reported to have been regularly com
missioned officers in the organized
forces of a revolution which had con
tinued many weeks and was proceed
ing in an orderly fashion in control
of about half of the republic, and as
such, according to the modern en
lightened practice of civilized nations,
they would be entitled to be dealt with
as prisoners of war.
The Far East.
In the far east this government pre
serves unchanged its policy of sup
porting the principle of equality of
opportunity and scrupulous respect
for the integrity of the Chinese em
pire, to which policy are pledged the
interested powers of both eaBt and
west.
By the treaty of 1903 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising
of the customs tariff along with cur.
rency reform. These t-eforms being
of manifest advantage to foreign com
merce as well as to' the interests of
China, this government, is endeavoring
to facilitate these measures and the
needful acquiescence of the treaty
powers. When it appeared that Chi
nese likin revenues were to be hy
pothecated to foreign bankers in con
nection with a great railway project,
it was obvious that the governments
whose nationals 'held this loan would
have a certain direct interest. In the
question of the carrying out by China
of the reforms in question. Because
this railroad loan represented a prac
tical and real application of the open
door policy through cooperation with
China by interested powers as well as
because of its relations to the reforms
referred to above, the administration
deemed American participation to be
of great national interest. Happily,
