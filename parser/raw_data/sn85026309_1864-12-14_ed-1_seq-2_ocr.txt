A Ureas,
Tbe Cstos of nearls Ibc Union of Hanfli
The Union of State none can never;
The Union of Lakes tbe Union of Ln!a
And the Flas Of Oca L'mos Forever!
The President's Message.
Thi Message to Congress at tlie open
ing of tie session has tbe merit of Icing
shorter ihan usual, and in the main it is
zplicit. The moat BBpltie poiat ia it,
and the one whieh most cvaetrna the en-
during people, U tha declaration that tha
war is to go oa, till tha state shall be
tubjugatod and that the suppression of
Slavery is a paramount object. In con
section with it, he expresses satisfaction
that despite of slaughter and death by
ether meaDs, we Lave- plenty of men left,
as the election proves by the number of
rotes cast.
. The first point in the message ia, that
Le has observed strict neutrality between
the belligerents in Mexico, where hue
pariy.hss overturned toe government, and
the other is seeking to restore it.
Next-he complains that Great Britain
and Brazil have done the like towards
our Insurgents.
The message abounds in false law. lie
el aims that he has power under the law
of Nations, to exclude enemies of the
human race from an asylum in the Uni
ted States. The laws of nations give
lim no power wha te ver of internal police,
and the people of the United States have
generally supposed that our Ports were
open as a refuge to people of all nations,
and sojong as they obey our laws they
may remain in peace. Tbe passage is
perhaps meant as a cover in advance for
the case of Argucllcs.
lie proposes to givo notice to Great
Britain to terminate the treaty which
prevents both parties from keeping arm
ed vessels on the Lakes. The reason as
signed is the insecurity of the Border.
H? thus confesses a long duration of the
war, and he forgets that England had
great cause to complain of incursions
from our side in the "Patriot War of
1S33."
In connection with the Public debt j
and as a means of promoting loans to the
Public he proposes that Congress shall
provide by law that persons may hold a
certain amount of U. S. bonds free from
seizure for debt. It will be a new turn
of the Usurpation screw, for Congress to
regulate the States in their collection
laws, and to make rules of decision for
State Courts.
' 'He tells us that the Public Debt last
July, was 1740 millions and that
Should the war continue another year,"
it will be increased 5G0 millions more,
that is, it will be 2240 millions. Why
speak of last July ? The debt was this
very day 2100 millions, and July was
yet seven months off.
I
Secretary Fessenden's Report.
So MI of the regular party papers in
jfiance of their duty to cry all's well
Lave aesailed this report as too long, too
vague, too timid, and undecided. The
Secretary seems to- write honestly, but
under an evident embarassmcnt, as to
what can be done or should be done for
raising money to meet the public wants.
He- admits that the issue of notes has
been pushed to its limit, and that an in
crease will produce depreciation, in the
. form-of higher prices. The sale of bonds
does not go fast enough to meet our wants,
and taxes can be made to go but a small
way towards yielding s supply, but he
recommends an increase of taxes to the
amount of Fifty Millions.
The expenditures for the year ending
1st July, 1864, were 865 millions. The
revenue for some time was 260 millions
and the remaining 618 millions were bor
rowed and so makes that much increase
to the debt on the books, for one year.
For the year now running and which will
and 30th Juno 1865 the expenditures
cannot be less they must be greater,
and the revenue cannot be increased more
than the increase of the expenditures, and
so, the Secretary will need COO millions
more money in some form. If Congress,
drive him into the issue of more notes,
he is alarmed for the result. If they
oompel him to rely on the sale of bonds,
he fears the result of combination among
the bidders. So he intimates that, in ad
dition to a sale of bonds, he shall have a
reserved power of making notes, if the
bonds do not get high enough and go
fast enough.
. The Secretary comes near saying that
the Great Financier had gone over the
field before him and gathered all the dew,
leaving him the dry blades and stalks.
But he will in the end be cheered by
learning that all the people who never
read his report and who say that they
tried to do so, and could not understand
it, are firm in the belief that there is
money plenty, and we "owe it to our
selves." And all the able financiers,
who live on subscription papers and coun
ty fees, say that the money is sure to
come for an indefinite number of years.

Will Opposition Cease?
Some of the leading agents of the
Desolation Party, hastened after the elec
tion to mke speeches of affected mode
ration. They had succeeded bo well in
misleading their own party with false
hood and calumny, they supposed, that
they might cajole the other with the
simulation of candour, end the pretense
of respect for opposition. In this, they
may possibly delude themselves, they
can delude no one else. Th contest
cannot be ended, for the conflict between
truth and error is eternal. The cham
pions of Law, and of Justice and of Hu
manity neither swerve from their course,
nor yield their purpose, because the
spoliation ranks, have been recruited into
a majority by fraud. and intimidation.
The seventeen hundred thousand men
who voted against Abraham Lincoln and
the bad principles of his party were none
X ihea coerced to do so, by the dread of
losing position, or by the greed of con-
tinned gain from the continuance of the
War. They were then, as they are now,
for maintaining the constitution and the
laws passed in pursuance thereof. They
swerve not from their position, and if tbe
Desolution party desire a Union with
them and to have the support of Union
men, it may be had, but only on the terms
of seeking a Restoration of the Union,
by lawful means.
Will Opposition Cease? The Times---The Times.
The most striking thing in the great
body of the American public, is the quiet
submission to whatever is done. The
same pcnple who have divided into par
ties on the construction of powers and the
extent of powers in the government, who
have maintained on one hand and denied
on the other, the power to make a road
or improve a river or to make a Bank,
now submit to every kind of power and
every form of its exercise, without a ques
tion. Indeed, the person who offers to
discuss such questions can gain no hear
ers, and even if he is listened to, long
enough to state his views he is quietly
told, that iu time of war, things are dif
ferent, and that the people in power know
what is best. The people are uncon
sciously adapting themselves to new forms
of action, to new modes of thought, and
consequently to new modes of Govern
ment. It is the will that rules and the
body is only the instrument ef its action.
It is so in man : so-it is in nations.
How Times Change.
We have an old pamphlet printed in
1829 at Baltimore, 'entitled" Experi
ments on Rail Roads in England, illus
trative of the Safety, Economy and speed
of Transportation, which this system as
now improved, is capable of affording."
It was meant to convince the people of
this country that Rail Roads would real
ly do.
At page 4, it contains the following:
From the London Courier, November 1S26.
"About a fortnight since, a number of
experiments with the locomotive engines.
Were performed at Killingworth, near
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, by order of the
Committee of the Liverpool & Manches
ter Railway.
On the 22d ult. a superior engine, of
eight horse power, being employed, the
diameter of the wheels being four fee,
five different trials of its power and speed
were made. The weight moved, exclu
sive of the engine, was 48 tons, 15 cwt.
The inclination of the road was 1 in 840
the greatest rise in any part 11 inches
in 100 yards, or 1 in 327. The engine
and load being moved in both directions
along this inclined plane, the total result
may be considered as upon a horizonta
plane. The average velocity teas nearly
seven miles an hour, ana tne greatest
speed nine and a half miles an hour. ' As
this engine was not of the best construc
tion for speed, no doubt can be entertain
ed, that with proper engines, goods and
merchaudise may be conveyed with a
very considerable increased velocity."
Lost: The proceedings of a Military
Commission held at Indianapolis for the
trial of certain persons accused of treas
onable practices. Tbey were last seen in
the columns of the Cincinnati Commer
cial and Gazette,bnt since about the time
the late election they have been entire
ly lost sight of. Any information re
specting them will be thankfully received
by au anxious and " loyal" people.
Even.
Brick FomeuOT, of the La Crosse
Democrat, takes the result of the election
good naturedly, and makes out that the
Democrats have done as well as the Abo
litionists, lie says :
Not so Bad. Election- is over, and
all who are sensible people will once more
be friends. The Republicans will say we
abused them and their candidate. So we
did. And they abased us and our candi
date. Ilere we are even. They voted
against us. We voted against them. Ilere
again we are even. They spent time and
money. So did we. Ilere again we are
a 1 i s a 1 Ta
even. Ana Desiaes it cosi me xiepuDu-
cans more to elect their President than
will ever benefit them. LTere vr have
the advantage. And again thousands
who have worked for Old Abe beauti
ful Abe, in hopes to be rewarded with
office, will be disappointed and for years
feel sore at heart. Here we have them
again. And still another ! They began
this war let them be responsible for its
ending.
It is a bad time to iwap horses when
crossiug a fctreum. Let u rather crown
the horse. Make him carry his load
through ! The Republican party has
disarranged our finances. Let it remedy
them. Republicans are holding U. S.
Bonds. Let them hold them ! In four
years from now no one else will want to I
Republicans want to free the negro. Let
them do it. They want to do the black
cuss a kindness by sending him to war.
All right. Let none but negroes go to
war. We can stand it. Here we are
even. Republicans do not intend to go
to the war. We do not intend to. Here
we are even' again ! They won't goto
the war. And we won't. Here again
we are even with them. The Republi
cans win have no more dralts. Ana we
will have no more 1 Even again ! They
intend to stay at home to watch copper
heads. We intend to remain at home to
watch them ! Here we have them again.
Over two million of men in the North
voted for McClellan. Quite a moderate
band of brothers. Here we have them
again.
A Different Spirit.
The following, from the New York
Times, edited by Henry J. Rayuiond, the
Chairman of the Republican National
Committee, affords a very fair contrast to
the mad and insensate ravings of such
men as Rev. Boynton. It says :
To honest opponents those who real
ly believe that the re-election of Mr.
Lincoln would imperil the liberties of the
country, and who, believing it labored
earnestly and ceaselessly to compass his
defeat, we can, and do extend a brother's
hand, and with it goes our sympathy.
To err in judgment upon measures, and
especially political ones looking to a fu
ture policy, is but human. All of us
stand in the category of humauity in that
particular. But when we have each done
our best and stand approved by our own
judgment and conscience, we can cheer
fully leave the great issues settled yester
day to the unfoldings of tbe future.
Lincoln's Majority on tiie Fopu
lar Vote. Lincoln's majority on tbe
popular vote will be about equal to the
number of new civil fJRcers he has created
since he has been President ! The Demo
cratic vote will be about one million and
a half I With the amount of patronage
against us, with the Treasury, the ''Green
back" presses, the shoddy contractors,
the civil officers, and the influence
brought to bear with the Army and Na
vy, it is surprising that the Democratic
Party was able to muster so- large an ar
my of voters. With no responsibility
upon them now, they can look on and
see Shoddy play its fantastic tricks.
General Scott presented his book to
General Grant with the inscription, "from
the oldest General, in the world, to the
ablest." This is correct, except in two
particulars, viz : 1st General Scott is not
the oldest General in the world, and 2J.
General Grant is not tbe ablest General
in the world. Otherwise it is all right,
with the trifling qualification that it is
not original, as General Washington, in
his day, received a sword from a European
General bearing the same inscription!
25.000 Votes. The New York Times
says :
"As tbe I'residentiaT majorities are
now reported, a change of 25.000 votes
in the States, giving Lincoln the smallest
majorities, would elect General McClel
lan.
This is not a very overwhelming result
nor one that indicates the annihilation of
the Democratic party.
The New York World and the Nation

of Mr. Chase, as Chief Justice.

Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, in his
Thanksgiving speech, alluding to the re
cent election, said : " The minority did
not imitate the damning sin of the South
and fly to civil war. This noble acquies
cence is worthy of all praise. I am proud
of those I opposed. Their conduct is
noble. Whether right or wrong before
they are all right now. - .- ..
The Meanest Man in Citation.
J cdgb Adbot, of Boston, a Democrat who
we believe has tost two sons in tb'rs war, in a
recent speech expressed iii opinion thn
plainly ;
: Let me ask lor a moment who (hose men.
are wbo denounce those who appeal to the
better part of man's nature. For twenty
years past they have endeavored to destroy
the Union. These are the
men who denounce you and me. They don't
want the Union. They are the men who
talked about war, war that w tolant always,
but who never have nor never will risk a hair of
their own miserable heads, When they talk of
war they mean the lives of your children and
mine, while they remain at home. They be
long to the class you have heard of before,
who are willing to sacrifice all their wives'
relations and even consent to sacrifice their
first cousins to the war, but not even a moth
er's son ol them will ever get within sound
of a bullet Their patriotism
expends itself in buying negroes, and in send
ing to Germany for recruits to fight in a war
they don't care anything about
Do you want :o know who is the meanest,
most dispieable creature animal, I will not
call him man thaterawls? It
ia the man who constantly appeals to the
worst passions of our nature ; who is con
stantly urging us to battle and who has not
courage, al'ility, or enpacity to risk a hair of
his own head. Think of that, and when you
have found such a man, you have found one
of the most miserable wretches that crawls.
This is one class. There is another : those
who are constantly denouncing us if we say a
word for peace and union. If you ask these
men to turn their pockets inside out, you will
find tl:em stuffed with greenbacks; the spoils
of your industry and mine. They want war,
because in means power and spoils. Of course
these patent patriots don't want to end the
war. These are the men who find fault with
us because we want to restore the country.
A Good Reason.
A couple of medical students disinterred a
subject on a cold winter's night, and having
dressed it, placed it, sitting upright, on the
seat of a covered boggy, and started for home
Coming to a tavern, and seeing tlw bar-room
lighted up, they left the wagon and went in
for a drink. The hostler, observing the man
sitting alone, in the cold attempted some con
versation, but receiving no answer, he discor
ered how the matter stood, and instantly re
solved to have a little Inn of his own on the
occasion. So taking tlie corpse to the stable,
he dressed himself in its clothes, and seated
himself in the carriage. The students soon
returned, and took their seats by the side ol
the supposed dead man, when one of them in
merriment gave him a slop on the face, say
ing, "How would you like some flip, old fel
low?" then remarked tremulously to his com
panion, "he is warm, by heavens !" ''S J you
