The President's Message.
—o—
B_ln the discussion of the reference of
the President's message to appropriate Com
'mitteea in the House of Representatives Mr.
Richardson of Illinois, took occasion to re
view that document, in which he says, '-it is
remarkable for what it says, and still more
remarkable for what 'it omits. The one half
of the twenty-one pages was devoted to the
nd&ro There was no page, sentence or line
as to the bravery of cundfcct cf those in the
field endeavoring to maintain the Union, and
No sorrow was expressed for
the lamented dead, the maimed and wounded;
no sympathy was expressed for the widow or
the orphan made by the progress of this war,
which could have been avoided by honorable
compromise, if the President and his friends
had desired peace. The President proposed ;
to tax the white man forever for the benefit of !
flic negro. This was the substance of (he
message. Tears of blood arc to he shed and j
countless millions of dollars spent for the j
black man, and when the public ask the Pros- j
ident to know what hrfee there wftseff the res
toration o'f thb Umofi, by 'inference they are \
told, if yon carry out my *6l tins and schemes j
yofi ibay hope to have the Union restored.—
Every argument for a change of the constitu
tion is for the negro. No benefit for the white
man. But the people in duo time Will com
promise for the benefit of white men, not for
negroes." In the course of his remarks con
demnatory of the administration,he spoke in
opposition to the bill passed to day indemni
fying the President and others from tho con
sequences of suspending the habeas corpus, j
saying the courts will not sanction tho reck- '
less and tyrannical exorcise, of power, The!
party in power, he argued, had violated the'
constitution and the laws.
The committee rose and at hclf past four
o'clock the House adjourned,

i®" The A'<w which his been proposed in,
aud will no doubt be thssed by Congress, in
demnifying the President hnd his tools against
prosecution by an outraged people for the
wrongs inflicted upon their persons and prop
rty, in illegal searches, arrests, confinement,
&c., is the last struggle of a condemned and
'dying party.
Entrenching itself within a "magic circle of
terror," —closing up, by an arbitrary majority
in Congress, all sources of investigation—with
the Press hand-bound and tongue-tied, this
Administration has ridden rough-shod over
the people, regardless of legal; moral or social
rfghts, and now when the day of reckoning
looms up in the misty distance, they seek to
shield themselves from the people's indigna
tion by an act of Indemnification.
In this country, where men arc born of in
dependent mind, and draw their ideas of free
dom with their lacteal fluid from the fount
maternal; such Invasion of right—sttrh libuso
of powor and trust as lias been practiced by
this Administration, however disguised an
rendored plausible by pretence, will not for
any great length of time he submitted to, and
must be aceofiiitcd for at soriie time or other
and in some way. An act of indemnity may
serve to shield them for the present, but the
sensation produced throughout the country has
been too violent to be thus easily quieted. '

Green-Backs that are not a Legal Ten
der.
TBgAlthough Congress has declared the
Greenbacks issued under their authority to be
a legal tender, there is an opposition variety
in circulation, issued by some ambitious char
acter which need not be so belong
ing, as they do, to the bogus order TlnSy arc
of the denomination o'f five dollars, photo
graphic, and according to the Chambersburg
Valley Spirit, arc well calculated to deceive,
and would not be detected at a pasual glance
by one man out of five hundred. Compared
closely with the genuine bills, they are found
to be about a sixteenth of an inch longer, and
the paper harsher and stiffyr. The signatures
show more plainly on the back of the bills
than in good money, and tho shading of the
engraving is heavier and darker. Other de
fects would probably be disclosed on a very
critical examination. It is likely these coun
terfeits have obtained a wide circulation here
and elsewhere ; and it will become necessary
for the pcoplo to bo a little more careful in
handling "greenbacks" than they have hereto
fore been.
It also appears that, there arc counterfeit
fifty cent notes of tire new postage currency
in circulation. They arc said to be well exe
cuted, and should be guarded against. Tho
following easily-noted marks will enable hol
ders to detect them 'i
1". Thy paper is thinner than the genuine.
3. The five faces of Washington vary consid
erably from each other in the counterfeit—so
much so that two or three if them, if standing
alone, would hardly be taken to ba portraits
of Washington—while on the genu;no they
all closely resemble each other. 3. The link
ed letters "U. S." under the middle faco of
Washington, in the counterfeit do not show
the lower end of the "S," inside the lt'g of tho
"U," while in the genuine they do. This
mark is easily seen. 4. The border round the
lettering and "50" on the back of the counter
feit is dark, and the lines are crowded, while
in the genuine the border is open, with a line
of light dots running through the middle all
tho way round. In the counterfeit this mid
dle lino is almost invisible, while in the genu
ine it is so distinct as to catch the eye at once

HAGERSTOWN, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 19, JB2.
From the Albany Argus.
ARRESTS BY THE WAR DEPART
ME NT,
LETTER OF JUDGE GOULD.
We charged long since, that the arrest of
persons in the city of New York, accusod of
frauds upon the Quartermaster's Depnrtmeij
was made for the purposo of concealment, is
order to shield the guilty parties, and to do
stoy the evidence of a mammoth fraud.
One of tlio parties arrested, C. Golden Tra
cy, is a relative of Judge Gould, of this Dis
trict, who, believing him innocent, appeals!
to the President to know the ground of his ai*
rest, and to demand.* trial. ,1
The President has been deaf to.this appeal; and
this has elicited the correspondence which we
publish. The language of the Judge is high
toned and resolute:
NEW YORK, NO>\ 14, 1802.
To His Excellency, ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
President of the United S'ates;—
Sir—On my arrival in this city, from my
residence in Troy, N. Y., I find that a cousiu
ol'mine, G. Golden Tracy, a broker of this city,
has been, first, arrested and sent to Fort La
fayette, and secondly, to-day takeu as a pris
oner to Washington. The newspapers say—
and so far as I can learn by all inquiries of
authorities I can hear nothing different—that
the cause of the arrest is some dealings he has
had in contractor's drafts on government offi
cers for moneys; and, it js said, some frauds
were co'mniitfedm or by the drafts, and he is
charged with complicity therewith.
If this bo so, it is a crime cognizable by the
courts, and only by the courts. And lam
amazed at tho fatuity of public officers who
can take lis warning from the distinct uttered
voice of a free people.
I am, and always have Seen, an unwavering
enemy of this rebellion—(cursed in its origin,
most accursed its progress)—and a supporter
of the administration. lam a judge of the
highest court of this State. And if no honest
voice has yet reached tho ears of our govern
ment, I wish to say, and to be heard in say
ing, that Star Chamber process and Secreta
ry's warrants are dangerous instruments to
play with, and that, among us, the true
staunch supporters of the government, who
would crush treason with the iron heel, but
who know the law, arc compelled to hang
hruuls in silcncp at mention of cases
which have occurred m bur midst.
Spies arc hardly cautioned when tlicy arc
where they can do infinite harm; but a pow
erful hind and an oppressive one, is laid on a
person here, who is not iii a p'osition for doing
mischief, if he would, and who is supposed to
have no friends.
In this respect, I thank God, there has been
a mistake. It is true that he is a young man,
of not much means or influence; it is also true
that he lias a young wife (married not long
since;) and for no assigned cause, anil for no
assignable cause, that those in power dare to
give breath to, he is taken away from home,
without giving to his wife an instuut's inter
view or a chance to see him. Is this country
the France of a century ago?.
The young map is the grandson of that Uriah
Tracy, who lived and died a Senator of the
U. States from Connecticut, who was the first
man buried in the Congressional burying
ground at AVashiugton, and whose ashes arc
insulted by this atrocious invasion of the lib
erties of the people in the person of his des
cendant.
f afn trot only speaking my own opinion of
such arrests. I know the opinion and tho
feelings of many of my brethren of the bench.
And if the government is really desirous of so
proceedings as to make it our duty to make
public our opinions, they will bo heard, not
merely in the writ of habeas corpus, but in
open declaration to the world. e
. Hud I been a few hours earlier made aware
of this case, I should not havo troubled you
with a word; but I would have seen that the
process of tlio Supreme Court of tho State was
so executed as to protect its citizens accused of
such offences from any arrest, other than oho
under the appropriate profess of courts'
I beg again to assure you in all sincerity,
that t! is kind of proceeding has gone too far
already, and that, while to the last of our men
and our means we are ready and' determined
to sustain the luw, and the government in en
forcing the law over tho whole land ah one
country, we arc also determined to be judged
by the law, and not by any Secretary or any
one who is hot commissioned for that purpose.
AVc know and acknowledge tho rules of war,
where tho necessity of the caso requires the
existence of martial law. But we know, also,
the common law of liberty, and the broad,
great charter of the Constitution.
I write warmly, zealously, because I cannot
bear to think of our cherished government's
taking any course to injure itself; at a time,
too, when our only hope of escaping tho eter
nal disgrace ar.d humiliation of letting the
cause of htitnan- liberty perish in our hands is
to sustain the government of this Union, and
to hh've'it a government worth sustaining.
AVith great respect, yours, drc.,
GEORGE GOULD.

PREPARATIONS FOB THE ATTACK.
A letter in the New York Tribune from the
scene of action, dated Wednesday night, (a
few hours before the engagement,) notes the
following preparations for tho attack :
A bright, clear day has been followed by a
glorious night. Since sunset the rumbling of
artillery is being heard from all directions.—
The long ponderous pontoon trains arc slowly
rolling over the roads to the river. Long col
umns of troops are everywhere In motion. —
At three o'clock the engineers w dl begin their
work, and with daylight five bridges will be
laid. Every hill commanding, tho opposite
side is crowned with artillery, at)d every shel
tering ravine near the river crammed full with
infantry.
As soon as the fog wiil have sufficiently
cleared away in the morning to give aim to
our artillery, the troops , will commence mo
ving over tho bridges, with Gen. Sumner's
command in the advanco. Those hundred
guns will be in position to sweep away every
obstruction with a hurricane of shot and shell
such as never bofort resoundod on this conti
nent.
About dark a number of signal rockets were
observed ascending on the other side, and gave
riso to the apprehension that the enemy were
apprised of the" impending movements; but
as a fog settled upon the river and valley early
in the morning, and the banks aro strongly
picketed for Jnilos, it is, hardly possible that
such information has already reached them.
From the uppermost pq'nt selected for Crea
sing it is only two miles to the lowest, and
hence the sanguinary spectacle wili be enacted
With concentrated intensity. The army wag
never in better condition and moro eager for
battle.
COMMENCEMENT OF THE ATTACK..
The poontoon t rains arc being laid under a
tremendous fire of artillery and musketry.—
the first shots were fired from the rebel right,
a short distance below Fredericksburg. The
boats for the bridges at Falmouth and in front
of the Lacy Ilouse, wore nearly all floated into
their proper positions before the enemy open
ed his (ire. The first volley was fired upon
the Lacy Ilouse bridge, and was very severe,
creating much confusion among the horses,
.out roi a moment delaying the Work upon the
bridge. The rebels are under the protection
of the liou,ses in Fredericksburg, aud are
firing from 'the windows aud roofe of nearly
all located near tbo joints of crossing.
DETAILS OF THE JjATTLIh
HEADQUARTERS.
Opposite Fredericksburg, Dec. 11—3 P. Jf.
Between four und five o'clock this morning
the pontoon train, in charge of the Seven
teenth and Fiftieth New Vork Engineers, and
under command ofGon. Woodbury, proceeded
to the river bank, where, with infantry sup
ports, an attempt was made to throw three
bridges across tho river—one at the point,
where the railroad bridge formerly crossed,
and two more opposite the city, but nearer
Falmouth.
A dull haze so obscnrcd v thc movement that
for a time it was not discovered by the rebel
pickets. The pontooners had succeeded in
partially constructing the liridgo when the
rebels suddenly opened a very brisk and
deadly fire of musketry from along tho banks
of the river and the windows of the houses,
compelling the cessation of the work. Some
of onr men were shot midway in the streafo,
aud falling overboard from tho boats, floated
down the river. . . .
lieturning to tlio cover of tho surrounding
hills, the men were again formed, and about
six o'clock tlio attempt to bridge the river was
renewed; but the rebels had now been thor
oughly aroused to a sense of what was going
forward, and with reinforcements of sharp
shooters swarmed tho opposito banks and hou
ses. Nothing daunted by tbo hot tiro which
they potirod in at the reappearance of our
troops, the pontooners wcut gallantly to work.
But in vain. A storm of bullets enveloped
tbem. Tho air was alive with the leaden mes
sengers of death. The planks and boats were
riddled by every volley.
Once more tlioy were compelled to with
draw, and they fell back to tho cover of th 0
ridge of hills running parallel with tho river.
As it was evident that the rebels were deter
mined to use the houses of tho city for n de
fense, contrary to an implied agreemept in tho
correspondence which recently passed by flag
of truce, orders were given to our artillery
men to open fire upon the city. Accordingly
Benjamin's Edwards', Muhicnburg's and oth
cr batteries of the Ninth corps, together with
tho batteries of tho corps to tho right and left
of the city, commenced an almost simultane
ous bombardment The fog was so dense that
it was impossible to see but a short distance
beyond tho edge of the river. The houses,,
however, in which the rebel sharps hootors had
ensconsed themselves, were plainly visible,
and to them the fire was for a time particular
ly directed. The effect was thoir partial de
molition in a short timo. After the jirst lire
they became untenable by the rebel riflemen,
who retreated to the rear of tho town, where
tlioy took shelter behind the as yet unharmed
buildings.
By soven o'clock tho bombardment bad bc
como general, and from that lime until one,
o'clock the roar #f artillery was incessant,
while the shot and shell tell fast und thick in
to the doomed city.
From tlio vicinify of the Lacy House, a brick
building overlooking the centre of tho city,
the batteries of tho Nith corps, raked the
streets with shelf, sehrapancl and grape.—
Though the fog still continued to obscuro in
a measure the results of these discharges, yet
the walls could be heard crumbling and tbe
timbers crashing. The rebels, with the great
est stnbborness, still kept within the city,
and at times parties of them could be seen go
ing from one point to another on the doable
quick. The carnage cannot but bo fearful
amongst them.
It is somewhat singular that tho rebel bat
teries did net return the fire of our guns, tip
to the present time they have not oponod in res
ponse.
About ten o'clock the engineers were formed
for a third attempt to construct the bridge.—
The Eighth Connectisut, under Major Word,
was lying at this time near the river bank; in
support of one of our batteries, After the pre
vious ineffectual attempts on the part of tho
engineers to cross, a pnrty of eighty inen from
if.o regiment, under Captain March, volun
teered to assist in this new endeavor to finish
laying the bridge, and once more tho column,
with this reinforcement; started down to the
river. • - •
Under the direction of General Woodbury,
they seized tho planks and carried out terns
dozen to tho en! of the etrir.g of boats, placed
a part cf them, and wore then compelled to
retire, very galling fire from tho reb
el sharpshooters, who were ensconced secure
ly in riflo pits, bolow tho range of the artille
ry, and within fifteen or twenty feet of the
river edge. Two of tho Eighth Connecticut
were wounded in this attempt, and the engi
neers suffered severely.
The movement having thus been interrupt
ed, the whole party were ordered back to their
original position.
At eleven o'clock it was discovered that one
of tbe houses was 011 fire. Tko flames, which
commenced in the westerly part of tho city,
toon spread, and Fredericksbarg is now en
veloped in fire and smoke.. .~. .. .... ...
An enfilading fire has been opened upon the
rebel rifle pits from our batteries up the river.
Xt has been successful, so faT, in driving the
sharpshooters from the vicinity of the railroad
depot. :
AQUIA CREEK, Doc, 12—midnight.—Intel-
ligence from tht front to-night states that our
forces havo crossed the river, aud are now in
possession of Fredericksburg.
The enfilading tiro from our batteries on the
right succeeded in driving the rebels from the
rifle-pits on the river's edge, thereby permit
ting an easy and rapid construction of the pon
toon bridges.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE FOTOMAC,
Friday Morning, 10 o'clock.—After occupying
the river front of the city last night, we lost
about one hundred men in Wlledrtnd wounded
while drjving the rebels through ths city,—-
They fired on, our nieut as they - advanced
through the streets while" secreted in and be
hind houses. Not much mercy was shown to
those who wore caught. ,
This morning a dnnsu fog hid everything
from view, but at this hour it is gradually
lifting and passing away.
Our troops commenced moving at an early
hour, Gen Sumner's grand division leading
the way over 111 front of the city, to ho follow
ed.by Gen. Hooker's gfand division. -
General Franklin's grand division, which
crossed nearly thrco milos below the city, is
nearly over. T ,
At a quarter past nino o'clock the first gun
was fired. The firing lasted for about half an
hour, the rebels not making a very spirited
reply.
It is thought the troops will all he over the
river by noon.
Information received during the night aud
this morning from deserters, arid prisoners,
show thAt the rebels have two jtrong lines of
batteries in the rear of the city, the first one
being about one mile back and the second a
mile from the fifst.
The whole army is in rapid motion and well
concentrated. The troops are ill excellent
spirits and anxious to be led against the ene
my's. works.
Tlio enemy have concentrated their forces,
and it is believed will give battlo. Much will
depend upon the result of to day. All feel
sanguine of stwecss.
HEADQUARTERS ARMT or THE POTOMAC,
Friday Evening, Dec. ltl. —At ton o'clock this
morning the fog began to clear away, but be
fore eleven the atmosphere was again thick
and it thus continued until 2 o'clock when it
entirely disappeared. v .'
At quarter past 2 o'clock the rebels opened
all their guns p r sl *1 oil the first ridge of hills.
Their main fire wr.s directed Upon the city,
which v.-.as filled with our troop.-!. Those guns
which were posted on the left of the ridge
were opened on the large body of troops which
crossed on the two-lower bridges, and had
formed in line of battle and were moving
obliquely down.thc river, fronting the Messa
panox, Although sovcral of their shells ex
ploded over our troops, no one was injured, j
General Bayard's cavalry, which crossed on
the lower bridge, had fivo men killed while 1
endeavoring to ascertain tho enemy's posit
ion.
The troops hicb crossed below are sleeping i
on their arms to night, tho advance being i
within three quarters of a mile of tho Messa- |
panox Creek, and tlioir left resting on tho :
ltappahannock. The enemy occupy tho op- !
popitc side of tho creek in force. „ .
Our guns po;ted o-j'tlio . b.-inlj ch this tide j
of the river .silenced the enemy's artillery, '
after an action of some half hour's duration.
This ended the filing for the day.
Tho ouly damage done by tho rebel shells;
thrown iutp the city was to add just so much!
to i(s destruction.
Twenty-five of our men .were killed last j
night in the streets of the city while driving
tho enemy out.
Nearly every bouse iu the city bat been
more or less damaged hy the Cannonading of

TWO DOLLARS A YEAR
the pnst two days. - Several splendid rosiden
ccs have been completely riddled. The sarna
may also he said of the churches. 1
The tiro appeared to be directed on the most
prominent edifices. In several cases, acts of
wanton destruction of property were commit
ted by our troops when tlioy first entered the
town—property which could bo qf no use tC the
enemy.
In many of the bouses the furniture all re
mained showing that tlieir occupants had left
iu haste.
Some of (fur troops in their impetuosity mis
took tho British flag flying from the residence
of tho British Consul for a rebel flag, and toro
it down. This morning the owner came over
to recover it, and the same was returned to him.
Tho main body of tho army is now over tho
river, the balance beiug in a position to cross
at any tin So.
There is 110 indication of the enemy pvaciv

Ludicrous Effects of the Appearance of
a Comet in 1719
la tliC year 1712, Mr. \\ histon, having cal
culalcd the return of a comet, which was tc
make it? appearance on Wednesday, the 14th
of October, at live minutes after five in the
morning, gave notice to the public according
ly, with this terrifying addition, that a tqtsij
dissolution of tho world by firo was to take
place on the Friday following. The reputa
tion which Mr, Whiston had long maintained
both as a divine and a philosopher, left little
or no doubt with the populace of the truth of
his prediction. Several ludicrous events now
took place. A number of persons in and
about London, seized all the barges and boats
i they could lay bands on in tho Thames, very
rationally.concluding that whqn the conflagra
tion took place there wpgld bo the most safety
on the water. A gentleman, who had neglec
ted family prayer /or better thau five years,
informed his wife that it was his determina
tion to resume the laudable practice the same
evening ; hut his wife, having engaged a ball
at her house, persuaded her husbaud to put it
off till they saw whether the comet appeared
or not. The South Sea stock immediately fell
to 5 per cent., and tho India to 11 ; and the
captain of a Dutch ship throw all his powder
into the river, that the ship might not be en
dangered. The next morning, however, tho
comet appeared.jtcjjoyding to prediction, and
before noort the belief was universal, that tho
day of Judgment was at hand About this
tinfe 126 clergyman, were ferried over to Lam
beth, it was said, to petition that a short pray
er might be planned and ordered, there being
none in tbe Church service on that occasion.
Three maids of honor burnt their collections
of novels and plays, and sent to the booksel
ler's to buy oach of them a Bible and "Tay
lor's Holy Living and Dying." The run upon
the bank was so prodigious, that all hands
were employed from morning till night in dis
counting notes and handing out Specie. On
Thursday, considerably more than 7,000 kept
mistresses were legally matrted in the face pf

The Waves of Ocean.
... . o
Thus, according to the joint testimony of the
most eminent naii&al authorities, the waves
in the open sea never attain the man tain
height ascribed to them by the cxhuborant
fancy of poets and exaggeration-loving travel
lers. But when the tempest surged beats
against steep crags or rocky coasts it rises to
a much more considerable height. The light
house of Bell Rock, though 112 feet high, is
literally buried iu foam and spray to the very
top during ground swells, eveu when there is
no wind. On the 20th"November, 1827, tho
spray rose to. the height cf 117 feel aboTTThf.
foundation ot lower water mark, which, dc
ducting 11 feet for tho tide that day, leaves
10G feet for the height of the wave. The
strength of that remarkable edifice may be es
timated fi*.m the fact, thai power of sucli
a giant billow is equivalent to a pressure of
three tons per square foot. Speaking of the
force of waves on coasts, Dr. Lyell -mentions
the transportation of a block of stone 00 feet,
from its bed, which was 8 feet 2 inches by 6
feet, and 5 feet 1 inch in its dimensions; and of
anothor still larger one, up nn acclivity, to a
distance of 100 feet. Mr. Stephenson nho
tells us that a block of gneiss at Skcrryvorc,
containing 601 cubic feet, and upwards'of 40
tons in weight, was carried by the waves fivo
feet from tho place Where it lay. Such are
tho alimentary powers which man has to en
counter in the erection of his harbors, his break
waters and his lighthouses,'and over which his
architectural skill achieve, so many glorious
triumphs. During tiro most violent galea the
bottom of tbe sea is said, by different
authors, to be disturbed to a depth of 300, to
860, or even 600 feet, and Sir Henry dc la
Bechc remarks that When the depth is 16 fath
oms, the water is very evidently discolored by
tho action of the waves on the mud and sand
of the bottom.' But in the deep caves ofoccan
all is tranquil, all is still, and the most dread
ful hurricanes that rage over the surface lcavo
these mysterious recesses undisturbed.— Dr.
