together by rapid moana ?tf communica?
tion M to be hardly known to one another,
and with historic traditioan extending over
very few yean; now intercourse between
the States ia swift and intimate; the ex?
perience of centuries has been crowded
into a few generations, and has created an
intense, indestructible nationality. Then
our jurisdiction did not reach beyond the
inconvenient boundaries of the territory
which had achieved independence; now,
through cessions of lands, first colonized
by Spain and France, the country has ac?
quired a more complex character, and has
for its natural limits the chain of lakes,
tho Gulf of Mexico, and on the East and
tho West, and two groat ocoans. Other
nations were wasted DV civil wars for ages
before they could establish for themselves
the necessary degree of unity; tho latent
conviction that our form of Government
is the best ever known to tho world, has
enabled us to emerge from civil war within
four years, with a complete vindication of
the constitutional authority of the General
Government, and with our local liberties
and State institutions unimpaired.
Tho throngs of emigrants that crowd to
our shores arc witnesses of the confidence
of all peoples in our permanence. Here is
the great land of free labor, where industry
is blessed with unexampled rewards, and
tho bread of tho workingman is sweetened
by the consciousness that tho cause of tho
country "is his own cause, his own safety,
his own dignity," Here every ono enjoys
the free uso of "his faculties and the choice
of activity as a natural right. Here, under
the combined influence of a fruitful soil,
genial climes and happy institutions, popu?
lation has increased iifteen-fold within a
century. Herc, through thc easy develop
rueut of boundless resources, wealth has
increased with two-fold greater rapidity
than numbors, so that wo have become
secure against the financial vicissitudes of
other countries, and, alike in business and
in opinion, are scif-centred and truly inde?
pendent. Here, more and more care is
given to pr?vido education for every ono
born on our soil. Here, religion, released
from political connection with thc civil go?
vernment, refuses to observe the craft of
statesmen, and becomes, in its indepen?
dence, tho spiritual life of the people.
Herc, toleration is extended to every opi?
nion, in the quiet certainty that truth
needs only a fair field to secure the victory.
Kere, the human mind goes forth un?
shackled in the pursuit of science, to col?
lect stores of knowledge and acquire an
ever-increasing mastery over tho forces
of nature. Here, the national domain is
offered and beld in millions of separate
freeholds, so that our fellow-citizens, be?
yond the occupants of any other part of
tho earth, constitute iu reality a people.
Here exists the Democratic form of govern?
ment; and that form of government, by the
confession of European statements, "gi^i s
a power of which no other form is capa" d i,
because it incorporates every man with ?he
State, and arouses everything that per?
tains to tho soul.
Whero, in past history, does a parallel
exist to tho public happiness which is
within the reach of tho peoplo of the
United States? Where, in any part of the
globe, can institutions be found so
suited to their habits, or so entitled to
their love, as their own freo Constitution?
Every one of them, then, in whatever part
of the land he has his home, must wish
its perpetuity. Who of them will not now
acknowledge* in the words of Washington,
that "every stop by which tho people of
thc United States have advanced to the
character of an independent nation, seems
to have been distinguished by some token
of Providential agency." WhoJ will not join
with me in the prayer that the invisible
hand which has led us through the clouds
that gloomed around our path, will so guido
us onward to a perfect restoration of fra?
ternal affection, that wo of this day may?
be able to transmit our great inheritance
of State Governments in all their rights,
of the General Government in its Constitu?
tional vigor, to our pesterity; and they to
theirs through countless generations?
ANDREW JOHNSON.
WASHINGTON, December C, 1SG5.
COLUMBIA.
Saturday Morning, Dec. 9, 1865.
The President's Message.
Wo present to oar readers, this morn?
ing, (twenty-four hours ahead of any other
paper in the State,) the complete message
of President Johnson, delivered before
both branches of Congress on Tuesday
last. This document has been looked for,
and will be read with intenso interest by
all classes, as it gives a pretty distinct in?
dication of tho policy of the President.
We shall reserve our comments on the
message until our next publication.
Cotton.
The correspondent of a Northern paper
says: "At the close of the war there were
about 200,000 bales of cotton in Georgia,
of which seventy-five per cent, belonged
to private individuals and the residue to
the Confederate Government and subjects
of foreign powers. Of this number 50,000
bales were shipped North and to Europe
direct, leaving 150,000 bales unsold and
waiting transportation. The United States
Treasury Agents have been nosing out
that belonging to tho Confederacy, but
with very indifferent success. The ac?
counts and operations, financially, of tho
Confederate Government, anterior to tho
administration of Mr. Memminger, were
upon snell a looso principle, that it was
bard to tell whether it owned a great deal
or nothing at all. And bereit may bo re?
marked, that one of the primo causes
which lcd to the downfall of Jeff. Davis'
Government was the peculations of its
quartermasters and other parties holding
its fonds. As sn instance, there ir ss s
msn acting as quartermaster, in a Sonth
ern city, for four years. He was not worth
the second shirt to his bank when appoint?
ed, but when turned out bf office by Major
General Wilson, XT. 8. A., he was worth
half a million. And another is now one of
your chief Wall street bulls, who made all
his money hero in the same way. These
cases might bc summed up and enume?
rated indefinitely. They first caused the
people to lose confidonco in the currency,
which was the entering wedge that split
up the whole concern."

vertising and job work are cash. We hope
all parties will bear this in mind.

SOUTH CAROLINA RAILROAD.-We are
highly gratified at being able to state, that
from and after this day, the trains over
tho South Carobna Railroad will run to

to one and all. Drivers of teams will take
due notice hereof, and govern themselves
accordingly.

CITY IMPROVEMENTS.-A casual visit at

be a neat and tasty affair, and will afford
tho architects an opportunity of display?
ing their abilities. We bavo been informed
by these gentlemen, and record the fact
with pleasure, that they are preparing
plans for over twenty buildings on Main
street, principally first-class houses. The

than of old. So mote it be.
