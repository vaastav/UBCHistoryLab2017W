ills first annuel report to Congre-s. It is a
Very lenglny nnd comprehensive document
and will tie of general Interest
Mr. loung, who w as nominated. md con
firmed by Congress to be Librarian at Con
gress, tooi the oath of office and vu'.ered
upon his duties July 1 last.
lie reports that the amount of copy
right fees received by Mr. Spofford during
the year ending June 30 was $55,370. Of
this sum the months of May aud J mm were
estimated at $1,100, as no accounts there
for had been rendered.
The i pt iiallures were as follows: Sal
aries', Library of Congress, $54,020.47;
Increase of library, purchase of books,
$5,980.02; contingent expenses, Library
of Congress, $1,003.77. Total, $01.-
004 20.
It 1 Impossible, in the present condi
tion of tlie library classification, to give
an cicl iiumbtrof books in the Library,
but It It. estimated that the library is com
posd of 767.715 Looks, aud 218,340
pamphlet.
On the 1st of Novemlier the number of
books icrortcd as loaned out "In the
hands of readers" was 3,320, of which
1.410 were rhared to Senators and
Members no longer In Congress, and no
others entitled to take out books. The
dally aerage of books in the hands of
readers -nay l placed at 3,000, but this
arle, as the number taken out during
the sesi.iu of Congress is much larger thin
during ths recess The percentage of
books lost In thirty years Is about .lve
lo a thousand. The privileges of the
Library hiu been abused in the keeping
lKiok out !)eyoi.d the time allowed more
than in not returning them.
Mr. Young states that the strengtli of
the Library is oerestlmated when placed
at 787,715 volmres, as from 33 to 40
per cent are duplicates. In the law de
partment, for instance, there are In some
cases fourteen copies of the same work
on the sheles.
On July .11, 1897, the old Llbriry was
closed, aud on the 2d of August the
transit of the books to their new tiutrters
was begun nnd accomplished In ten weeks
without the loss or misplacement of a
single volume. The books were arrange J 'n
tin- new Library with regard tocoaeu!e ice
of access and speedy service. Books which
experience had shown to be most sought
"for were placed on shelt.es near the r, ad-
ingroom.
Of thctrntterof appointments, Mr. Young
says that none was made until after "he
books had all been removed to the new
building, and that all so made were proba
tionary, subject to the tests of experience
and evimiiiation. Tbis was done In ordi r
thattbeLlbnry in its reorganization raig'.t
haie efficient serice. To aid In this a
boa rd consist Ingot Mr. Sporford, Mr. Ilutcn
inson, superihtendent of the reading rocm,
and Mr. Solberg, the head of the copyright
department, were a ppol nted a s represent ing
the l-st a.illablo experience in determin
ing aptitude for the various forms of Li
brary woik. It is expected that the boird
will complete Its examinations this present
mouth.
The dutv of selecting well qualified
persons, possessing special aptitude for
library work, has been attended will
many embariassmcnts. rortlons of the
library service require technical knowl
edge, as much. as the duties of the medi
cal or enginrer corps. Each of tho 11
visions of the Library, music,
graphic
arts, the reading room, the catalogue
bureau, the hall of maps and charts, the
manuscript, tie law department of the
Library, the periodical mil newspapers,
necessitated, apart from a general kno.vl
edge of library work, a special kuowle lge
of the department to which the candidate
was assigned What increised the em
barrassment was that, .is a rule, the
thousands of applications represen'ed
meritorious and accomplished peopli,
'lth the lifcrheM. rruiinn cndaliun", frjiu
all duss-s, and c.ipahlc or good service
In many stations of public duty, but lack
ing in requisite experience.
It vas tecause of the desire lo maintain
the traditions ami the integrity of the
Library that few changes were made in
the old stEff. Of the forty In service upon
taking office, but five have thus far been
changed three because of superannuation,
and this with regret, because the gentlemen
In question had in their day done gii'id
service, and should have retired on a pen
sion, such as superannuation and faithful
work receive In other national libraries.
The rrmalmng changes seemed for the in
terest of the Library. Twenty five per
cent of the appointments consisted of wo
men. With few exceptions, women had lot
hadserviceintre Library and, therefore, the
nominations were an experiment. It was
believed that as there were various features
of library work apparently suitable icr
women, they were entitled to recognition.
In the administration or other libraries the
exper'ment has ljeen successful, bu' so far
as this Librirv is concerned, the appoint
ment of women Is still an experiment. This
may result from the present exceptional
conditions.
Tho Library Is In a slate of change. Its
new departments created by the new law,
Involving the handling and organization
of tho vast mr.terlal outside of books, now
is first brought to view. The classification
and removal of this material is manual la
bor, with little opportunity for rest, as a
rule hard and exacting. In a year or two.
when these new departments are arranged
and In good working order, there may be
gentle and useful office for women.
Slncethe reorganization or the Library a
fiscal system of bookkeeping and account
lng has been arranged, ho that an adequate
record may be kept of .ill money passing
through the copyright branch of the LI
brary. Mr. Young deems thit a more rigid
enforcement of the statute which makes
the deposit nf two of the articles copy
righted essential to the validity of a copy
right, would bo an advantage. The Li
brarian Is disposed to believe that the fail
ure or publishers to comply whh,tlie(law
arises from neglect rather than from othr
causes. Iicsuggetsthatit would be wisp

Mr. 1'ouLf recommend-i that Congress
should take some action toward the gath

determine what are of historical and not
of administrative value.
The act of Congress makes provision
for attendants In a national reference li

Until Congress determines th3 uses to which

The opening of the Library at night Is
strongly urged by Librarian Young, who
calls attention to the firt that evirr

to the shelves can bo had as eisllyai In
the day. Everything is so well arranged
that the Library could be opened wlthoit

permission to open the Library it once.
Tiie hours for reading would bo from 9 In
the morning to 9 in tlie evening, the re id-
Ing room available alone it night.
Librarian Youngdnells.it considerable
Icngtii upon the subject of those that have
access to the 1,1 brarry.and advises that the
access to tie same should be more rigid
than it now Is. He gives the list of those
who are new entl tied to obtain books frcm

Announcement He'Curding the Lduca
lloiiul Convention.
Mr. Tlwmas W. Smith, chairman of the
finance commute- of the general commit
tee In clwrgeof the arrangiments for th
convention of the National Educational
Association, which will meet lu Wash
ington rext July, today made the follow
ing announcement:
Thcdeciskinor the National Educational
Association to hold Its next annual assem
bly In Washington, July 7 to U, 180S, iaa
to arrange for the discussion of educational
suhjectot general reiolcing not only among
thecultured, hospitable citizens of this Dis
trict, but among the educators of the whole
country, who have greatly desired this
Hinting in the Capital of the United States.
Eight general sessions will be held, nnd
thirty department meetings In seventeen
separate sections, representing every great
phascofeducational Interest.
Holding the convention on such dates as
will iusurc to the delegates a fcabbath in
this city Is a new depirture, and Is a so
cial compliment to Washington. On Sun
day, July 10, It is the expressed desire of
the national executive committee that the
churches in the National Capital be invited
memes in tneir palpus.
Fourteen sessions of the convention will
beheld before Sunday, July lu, and twenty-four
afterwards.
It Is believed that the competing cities
hich have in idesuch herculean endeavor
to secure this convention, disappointed
though they arc, will roll up large delega
tions for Washington.
Los Angeles, at the recent meeting of
the nation tl executive committee In Chi
cago, pledged 5,000niembershlps to the
National Educational Association rrom
California it It assembled there, while
Omaha had already secured ljsuo member
ships andpledged 2,300 by April 1.
Tbe final decision In favor of Washing
ton, D. C, renders it imperative that the
local committee should at once proceed to
make active preparations for the most in
teresting and Important ev ent to occur here
within the present century.
Since this great national Ixidy assembles
In Washington unon Invitations from nr
District government, our universities, col
leges, public schools aud our citizens, our
present duty to make suitable preparation
for that assembly Is obvious.
Generous citizens have already made
liberal subscriptions, but not sufficient to
meet this great emergency. "
The amount necessary to be raided for
local expenses Is $10,000. If loo jier
sons should contribute $100 each, the
entire amount would le eaily secured.
But this is neither probable nor desirable.
Everv citizen of Washington is interested
in this assembly, and the flmncc committee
desires a large numlicr to testify their
interest by practical co operation.
One contributor sends $10, Faying ''one
thousand contributors at $10 each will
suffice. Call on me again if necessary."
Let every man, woman and child who
feels the desire or ambition to aid In this
excellent work scud a contribution ac
cording to Individual ability, and It wjll
lie recognized, appreciated and gratefully
received.

Havana, Culm, Dec "In spite of the
ef'ect or President McKlnley's message,
the attllude of the Havana volunteers con
tinues to cause considerable anxiety to the
govern meet.
During the last week' there has been a
large force of regular troops concentrated
In the forts and barracks, prepared to
suppress a demonstration. The volunteers
arc In a sullen mood, but their animosity,
it Is now lielleved, is directed rather ut
uutonomj than at Americans.
Another grievance or the -volunteers I

of utilizing the vast idle .force of -voluu
tccrs by putting theuirln the fit Id, or, it
least, on gurrlsou duty. To this the vol

Is lielieved they will proceed to any length
ratlwr than surrender the ol erlhed prlvl

occa.4onal parndco ind guard duty nt the

American rule, but they will never submit
to be ruled by Cubans-tin this movement
Carllst influences are apparent, as the lr
reconcilables have declared their intention
of wetting a white Carllst badge in their
hats.
W Idle lu Havana no open opposition has
yet developed. Gen. Blanco Hn-tnUirrassed
by the Mllure of the autonomists and re

Mr. Dlngley Denies Thut the lle-
duction Is Chargeable to tlie Tar
iff Law Passed at Kstru Sesl.jii.
Fall Elver, Muss., Dec 9. At a general
meeting of the Cotton Manufacturers' As
sociation yesterday it was voted unani
mously to reduce all wages lu the mills of
the city, the amount aud time of t he reduc
tion being left to a committee which for
some time has had charge of the matter.
It is ULderstood thtit the cut will amount
to about "0 per cent, and will go Into ef
fect on January 1. It will affect 28,000
operatives of this city, who are paid an ag
gregate week wage of $180,000.
Theattltudeofthccmploytsouthcmatter
can hardly be stated until they have had
a chance to talk it over. None of the labor
leaders will say very much about the sub
ject until such meetings are held.
Secretary Whitehead, of the weavers,
said that that union would hold a meeting
without delay. Secretary McCarthy, of
the loom flxeis, believes that his union will
not actept the reduction, and Hecretary
O'DonneU. of tl e spinners, said that his
union would also meet at once.
Secretary Tansy, ol the carders, said
that no action would be taken until the
union met next week, while Secretary
Jackson, nf the slashers, said that the
executive rommlltee ot the union had Leen
called together.
The feelh t; is prevalent that before the
mutter Is suited there will be a strike,
but liow large a proportion of the oper
atives will take part, it is Impossible to say.
Chairman Dinglev,of tlrWavsaiidSliaus
Committee, sees nothing slguifcant In
the proposed reduction of wigcs by the
Fall llivct manufacturers.
''I havo a desk full cf cllpj.iiigs from
newspapers all over the country, saying
that wages have tveen reduced in diffir
ent Hues of trade," said Mr.Dingiey, ''bat
these reductions are not traceable to the
present tariff law."
'It is clear to my mind why the Fall
Uiver n auufacturers wen- compelled to
cut wages. An overproduction of cotton

8 cent cotton cannot be nold on the
market for a penny more than goods
made cut of 5-cent cotton. You can
see, tbi-refore, that a net loss of 3 cents
per pound on lach pound of cotton bought
last year Is entailed. I repent, that the
present cut In prices Is doubtless trace
able to a temporary over product ioa of
cotton.
"As time passes, manufacturers of
coarse cotton goods move their factories
Southward, so that they may be In closer
proximity to the cotton fields, md with
cheap labor in tbe South. Manufac
turers or coaise goods can put their pro
duction ou the market cheaper than
manufacturers In the New England States.
The New England manufacturers, as a con
sequence, have lieen forced to the extrem
ity cf temporarily reducing wages. In or
der to compete with the manufacturers of
cotton goods In the South.
"Had there been 9,000,000 bales of cot
ton proouced thr- season instead of 11,
000.UOO, cotton would be surely worth as
much today as it was last year. Supply and
demnnu, as B'yun tells us, regulate the
price of commodities, and as the supply
exceeds ihe demand thore Is naturally a
reduction in tlie price of cotton, and the
manufacturers who have 8 cent Mtton on
their bands are the sutferers."
Mr. Jjlnglcy's Information that th cot
ton crop tlI- year is "som'thlng 'ike II.
OOO.COO bales" seems to be exclusive. The
highest estimate In any Government report
is 9 000,000. while the cotton statistics
outside put It at only 7,000,000.

Mrs. McKinley Was Weaker Wlieu
tho Morning dime.
Canton. Ohio, Dec. 9.-Mr. McKuil-y is
reported weaker, 1 ut still clinging to life.
When the final dlsolution w III come no
one seems to. -are to venture an opinion.
Morning found Mrs. McKlnh-y still alive,
but very low and with indications or eirly
dissolution. A serious sinking spell oc-
diiring he early lours of the corning,
following a rerlod or wakefulness aim it
midnight, when there were some Indications
that the patient wns partially conscious
of her surroundings, but too weak to give
any sign.
During the sinking spell the patient
seemed almost Inanimate, and It wai
feared the end was at hand. Palsied
sleep, deep and undisturbed, succeiiled
the spell in tho early hours of the i. orn

dawn found her.
The President kept the nyit vlg I,
and the whole family were near the Led
side all the while, each feeling that the

MILLER'S MARVELOUS PACE
He Keeps It Up Witliont Showing
Signs of Weariness.
Hlce Is Riding; n Wonderful Race,
uud Niine Suy He May 1'yilul
in a Wlnuer.
New Yolk, Dec 9. The real fight -.f Ihe
six-day's race is now on. The time for
the heartbreaking work has coin.;, when
everything but the will is protesting
against the Incessant strain. Eyes have
nink deep and red in their -ockets, legs
are without sensation, and wrists and
backs ache to distraction.
Tlie trainers who handle the lower mn
are the ones who encourage the fat in -n
to ilo tlie sprint 'ng. The reason for this
Is that they v-nut the fast men to tire
themselres out and take a rest, and there
by give the slow men a clian-e to make up
a few lap.
T-ddy Hale Las lieguu to show the form
which hi- trainer, Dudley Marks, promi-vd
last Monday morning he wouldshow when
the race sl-ould have been half fini-itu-d.
It wns In the neighborhood or 3 j"cIock,
arter a ftfteei -minute nap, tint he cam.
upon the track lu J thick green sweater an 1
started rt killing pace. Two laps were
required to warm him up, and th-n he
drew cwoy from thruck. IClvierie.Elkes.
Waller, Miller, Golden, Johnson and Gan
non wcrn bunched behind ilm, plugjlog
away muuotoouusly. IVnller ,sunl Milter
had- ben righting- over the laps, so they
wcra not, r,u!te prepared to put after Hale.
But Itlvleitt thought himself fresh enough
to essay tide's new pace, and did finally
catch him In the south stretch.
He boosed in lhind tlie Irishman and
held him for four laps. Hale then left
him essttV, and Rivierre subsided into a
Jog along the pole. The other was riding
high on the track, with Milter, Wilier aud
the rest In thfe middle roadway. For a
full hour Hale held the tcrrille pace.
Tierce had a tumble at 4 o'clock at the
MadU-ein avenue end of the track. H
was riding high onthecurve, and his wheel
slipped. A few minutes later Moore turn
bled off In a similar way. His pace was
not enough to keep him s-cured en the
high side of the track, to bo slid dowa
and bounced lianl on his hip. lUith men
said treygufsx.d they wete asleep. They
were not l.urt.
A matter of great comment istheremark
blc showing that Elkes, the Great Falls
youngster, is nuking. Although he his
lieen aler.t from the track foi fullv twenty
hoar-, his mi'tage was more thin 1,000
this mornleg.
KIcc did hard riding after 1 o'dock.
Some say he miy pedal ina winner. Miller
keeps up his marvelous pice, with little
sign 31 weariness. He is still gol for
twenty miles, an hour, but it Is hard to be
lieve he can keep it up. The crowd his
taken to whistling, "All Coons Look Alike
to Me" t' see Gray sprint. He ilwiys re
sponds. The two Frenchmen, Slephane
and Uiv :crre,.ire In fair condition, and keep
well up in the list. At 9 13 the last score

Tlv wis a big spill on the Twenty -sixth
treef s'cle of the track just before 11
o'clock. The toe piece ot Schinn r's -vhcel
got oat of oner and he lost his pedal,
which caused him to swerve into Rivierre.
The two went down with a hard bump.
Hale, Mcore, Pierce, Elkes, Golden, and
Etitermun, who were coming at tup speed,
ran Into the pro-trate pair, increasing tho
contusion. The others saw their danger
md stepped lu time to avoid the tangle.
Schinuer was nruised and had to retire for
a time. Tlie others resumed the race none

LIVELY R0USE BERATES
The First Aroused Iy a Printing
Resolution.
THE PENSION RILL ATTACKED
Mr. Cannon Announced His Approval
of the 3Iciisiire, But Mr. UeAr
tuoiul Vigorously- Assailed It ami
Was Give; l K truest Attention by
AH the Members).
The first affair in the House to ruffle the
spirlt-iotsoiiicof the members today Came
upon a resolution offered by Mr. Perkins,
chairman ot the Committee on Printing.
Theresolutlou was objected lo by the Dem
ocratic side ot the House because the
wording of Ut resolution gave the com
mittee unlimited power of expendltiue.
After some debate, Mr. Perkln- consented
tC a modification of the r.,!i.il , .-.ml it:
I was adopted.
On motion of Congressman Stoneof Peuti-
sylvanU the Iloue resolved Itself into a
Committee of the Whole ou the Mate of the
Union rr the purpose or taking up the eli
sion a piiropri.it Ion. Speaker Reed relin
quished his scat, and it was filled by Mr.
l'avne of New York. The debate was
opened by Mr. Stone, of Pel u-ylvauia Tho
claimed tliat there was nothing lu ihe
appropriation to Justify any reduction.
itr. Cannot', chairman ot the Loiuiiutt-
on Appropriations, said the bill rwjlves
his indorsement. He ituide an earn-st
pU-a for economy; denounced the pre.'jt
system ot forming estimate", and de
clared in most positive- terms that if s
tlmates were made- now as tliey were in
former years, than Instead of there beais
u deficit ot -l.O00,Ouo there would I
a surplus of $8,000,000.
Congn ssman Allen of Mississippi fol
lowed Mr. Cannon in a witty spnycii, in
which li dnounced the present sys'em of
granting pensions and the attorneys who
secure them. He said In regardto theieu-
slou bill his people la Mississippi igr-ed
with the little girl In Georgia who rjo-it.-ly
endd a prayer by saying:
"And, now. Oh, Lord, take care of
Yourself fur You and McKmley are all
we have now tu depend ou. anil It doen t
look as if HcKlnley would de much.'
Mr. I)e Armond ot Missouri, followed
with objections to the enormous amount
of $4s2,0OO,0uu, estimated for the pen
sion appropriation. Hi believed that
certain pensions stmuld lie paid, but that
there vv ere many that ought not. He con
sidered it remaikahle tint aftr so imuy
years after the war si many pen-sio-is
sliould be lssjed, and the amount needed
to pay them j constantly increaed-
During Ids speech many Republicans leftff
their seats and wentoverto the Democratic "
side of the House and listened attentively
to the remarks of the speaker. They were
particularly Interested in his query as to
why lawyers, doctors, and mllUouaiies
should he made dependants ami draw from
the Government a pension of froni $tj a
month upvard. The law requires proof
tint the uiht, Is liable to !e a charge
upon a community, becau-e of InaLihty
to perform niancal work, befori a pension
Is granted, and such being tlie case Mr.
De Armood asked again why millionaires
sliould be pensioned.
Mr. De Armond declared that the law
could easily be so amended that tho-e prop
erly entitled lo pensions "-hould receive
them and to others, thereby sa.iug to
the country many millions- Expenditures
ouhtalways Vj be kept within bo indsand
In regard to pensions it could be- done, by
denying them to those who lo not need
tliem.
"1 an aware," said he. "thit this is a
ck licate subject to touch upon- I niawars
that the gentlemen express opinions in
the cloak loom that do not flutl expres
sion on th - floor, but I commend to you
the advisability of such action that mn
who ilc not ured pensions shall be re
mitted to rtceive them."
