The Message.
PRESIDENT HARDING'S message delivered
in person on Tuesday, is his ' first to a
regular session and therefore of broad and
inclusive scope as to national affairs. To the
man of the street free from partisan prejudices
and so the best judge, it. will leave a very satis
factory and gratifying impression. It reads as the
judgment of a man blessed with abundant common
sense, peculiarly tolerant, free from any marked
prejudices and with that impartial balance which
is natural to the thorough American who is of
all classes and no class.
It is a very quotable document, its discus
sions of each question being plainly stated, making
clear cut issues and quite unmistakable statements.
But it is not contentious, censorious or critical;
quite the contrary, it is eminently fair in its tone
and method, giving due credit to others; seeking
party harmony and team work. Because of the
armament conference and the many reports as to
new foreign relationships which may come from
it. the parts of the message relating to foreign
affairs are apt to be most closely analyzed. Cer
tainly they are not narrow, and they indicate a
growth in grasp and a broadening of view, which
may be a quite inevitable consequence of responsi
bility and having to look from the inside, out,
as well as from the outside, in. Such statements
as the following, have no little significance:
Our tasks would be less difficult if we
had only ourselves to consider, but so much
of the world was involved, the disordered
conditions are so well-nigh universal, even
among nations not engaged in actual warfare,
that no permanent readjustments can be ef
fected without consideration of our inescapable
relationship to world affairs in finance and
trade. Indeed we should be unworthy of our
best traditions if we were unmindful of social,
moral and political conditions which are not
of direct concern to us. but which do appeal
to the human sympathies and the very be- 1
coming interest of a people blest with our
" national good fortune. ? ? ?
They (the powers immediately concerned)
must themselves turn to the heroic remedies
ior the menacing conditions under which they
are struggling, then we can help, and we mean
to help. We shall do so unselfishly because
there is compensation in the consciousness of
assisting, selfishly because the commerce and
international exchanges in trade, which marked
our high tide of fortunate advancement, are
possible only when the nations of all continents
are restored to stable order and normal re
lationship.
There will be great interest in that portion
of the message referring to merchant marine and
promising a distinctly stated program for its pr*
motion in the near future. This can hardly be
other than some form of a subsidy so that it
would seem the war time white elephant, may be
about to force this policy for its support which
had been persistently rejected as a means for its
gradual development and logical growth. As tHe
President says, denouncing all commercial treaties
to put into effect discriminating tariffs, is im- ,
possible, while some form of subsidy is used by I
every other country that pretends to be a sea j
carrier.
Of kindred interest and good sense is the
plea for a flexible tariff act. Protective tariffs
we must have. They were never so essential to
the maintenance of American wage scales, Ameri
can plane of living and the home markets, as
against a flooding by goods based in price on
almost valueless money and extreme exchange
fluctuations. The President recommends that au
thority be given him to permit the Tariff Com
mission to revise specific schedules from time
to time and adjust them to changed monetary,
economic or labor conditions, which will be in
a constant state of flux in foreign countries. It
would seem that this would have to be granted.
It is self-evident that any tariff schedule, based
on present conditions may six months, or less,
or more, from now either act as an import pro
hibition. or to the contrary, flood this market.
The antics of the German market are enough
to point the moral. Of course, action would
not be by the commission, but by the Presi
dent on the commission's findings.
The portion relating to agriculture will be
generally commended. No one can well deny
the economic soundness of the proposition that
the farmer should have a larger share of the
price of his products to the consumer. The spread
between the farm price and retail price is entirely
too wide, and unnecessarily so. Mr. Gompers
has already jumped with hob-nailed boots on the
section relating to the relations of employers
and employes. "Capital and labor" has become
a misnomer for economic and social relations
in this country, since, as the President points
out, so many employes are capitalists and so
many capitalists arc employes. The line' between
capital and labor has become indistinguishable for
most of its distance.
It is probable, too, that Mr. Gompers will
find he was more scared than hurt when he reads
that part of the message more carefully. The
Danbury hat case is now to be followed by a
suit of the clothing workers against their em
ployers for violation of a labor contract. Rights
and liabilities are being fixed as between employer
and employe and the public is getting mighty
tick of being the perpetual goat. The President
is everlastingly right that "in an industrial society
such a* ours the strike, the lockout and the
boycott are as much out ot place and as dis
astrous in their results as in war or armed revo
lution in the domain of politics." Either Mr.
Gompers and his 'fellows must find a way to
end strikes, or a way will be found for them.
Reclamation of public lands, both arid and
swamp, is broadly recommended. Here is the
place and way to regulate and end unemploy
ment. Here are projects widely scattered, capable
of exact planning and organization, where opera
tion could be undertaken on nearly any scale
at any time, and almost abandoned without material
hurt when the emergency ended. It is also grati
fying, especially so to The Herald, that the Presi
dent recognized the auiful plight of Russia for
a specific gift of food materials. America cannot
afford to harden its heart to suffering bccause
of political differences. As a whole the message
has been well received. It fits present day public
sentiment and responds to the popular desires.
It is a notable event for a Philadelphia
orchestra leader to produce fourth dimension
music in Washington. He knew where to
come to obtain an understanding audience.
Delayed Wixlom.
THE apt though inelegant proverb concerning
the disparity of "foresight" and "hindsight"
is highly applicable to about all the doings of
the human race, but particularly to international
affairs.
How clftarly we all now descry the inevita
bility of the world war, how certainly its train
of economic evils! But we saw far too late to
modify conditions which produced the unparalleled
struggle and again we behold too tardily the bale
ful effects of its prosecution to do more, immedi
ately, than apply palliatives.
After all, the man in the street can't be
blamed for not rising with the strident voice of
prophecy when this tough old world may seem
to be galumping ,along to another fall. It's the
scribes who are to blame, that is, if one is per
mitted to gauge their deductive powers as to
future events from their writings on world politics,
and the like, of the recent past.
Specifically, we refer to 'the vast mass of
printed matter offered daily, weekly and monthly,
as ?.o the woeful condition of our friends, the
Germans, and the dire effects of their present
dilemma on the whole civilized world.
When, not so very many months ago, the
reparations commission of the league of nations
announced Its findings, loud hurrahs were heard
on every hand, in type and out. The well-known
"staggering total" of gold marks which the van
quished foe was called upon to toss into the coffers
of the allied nations was a string of figures over
which the expert economists gloated for column
after column. So far as our reading disclosed,
there was not one protest registered against a
finding which the consensus of informed opinion
today condemns.
The allied troops occupied three important
Rhine cities to supervise customs and compel the
payment of an indemnity installment, and again
there were cries of approbation. It was only after
the peaceful but determined invasion that the ex
perts discovered an industrial paralysis was liable
to be the result.
So things moved on to the apparent definite
schism between French and British policies, to the
accompaniment of unemployment explosions from
the latter and the jingling of sabers and peal of
trumpets from the former. Now, with Germany
all laid out, hardly knowing whether she is a corpse
or a subject for further major operations, to hear
her statesmen and bankers tell it, the experts '
have about decided that things have indeed been
handled wrong.
They advance thesis after thesis of length
and profundity tracing with unimpeachable clarity
the mistakes that have been made in the handling
of the Gerhian situation. It makes great reading
and gives one a sense of being uncommonly erudite
when one has assimilated the most recent crop of
findings. But the troublous thought continues to
recur: "Why didn't they think.of all these things
before they turned to direful consequences?" Er
rant ministries might have been turned from their
courses, economic losses of millions averted, the
resuscitative methods about to be employed ren
dered unnecessary.
The plain truth is, that the proverb previ
ously noted is most everlasting true, in the cases
of both layman and expert. Both stand astounded
at developments of which the portent was written
on the skies. The difference is that the experts
are much more adept at dissembling their surprise.
Washington presents the anomaly of pro
viding excellent office buildings without hav
ing sufficient schools in which to train citi
zens to manage the offices efficiently.
Germany as a Buyer.
STATISTICS of the Department of Commerce,
covering' the first eight months of the 'year,
indicate a buying power in Germany that is worth
considering.
Wheat, cotton, copper, bacon, lard and con- ]
densed milk lead among the commodities pur
chased from America, and their total value is fixed i
at nearly $100,000,000 more than our sales to them
in the corresponding period of 1920.
Wheat shipments to Germany this year were
32,920,000 bushels as against 2,364,000 last year;
our cotton sales, up to August 30, aggregated
964,165 bales, as against 334,026 in the first eight
months of 1920.
Full payment may be delayed, bu} Germany
has persuaded American business of her ability
and her desire to purchase raw materials. This
certainly is evidence of improving conditions on
both' sides of the Atlantic.

Poland and France.
To the Editor. The Washington Herald:
All the charges of imperialism
and militarism hurled against
France and Poland are nothing but
organized Russian Bolsheviks and
German propaganda
Germany hat^s her eastern neigh
cloth over a military armor, which,
though not quite as thi<-k as before
the world war. is still very stronc.
Until Europe becomes stabilized the
French and the Poles are as one.
A weakened France means weak
ened Poland. A France endangered
, by Germany i" a PfWnnd threatened
by the Prussian junkers. Nobody
I can separate one from the other.
Germany hates her esatern neigh
bor just as much a* and pernap*
more than her western nelirhbor.
This is a natural condition and not
an artificial arrangement Tt is a
situation growing out of the very
geographical position in which the
three countries And themselves, and
this is augmented by the prist re
lations between these countries, the
long years of suffering heaped upon
France and Poland by their com
mon enemy in his day of power and
their weakness.
That is why on this proposmon
of land armaments France an?r r*o
land are as one and they will re
main as a unit until such a time
when the course of human events
will carve out for them separate
channels.
Poland, therefore, though she Is
not an active participant in the de
liberations of the conference, is
nevertheless a vital part of the sub
ject matter before the Conferees.

Ancient Concepts of Savior.
To the Kditor. The Washington Herald.
Perhaps some readers wonder why
the writer thinks it sensible to write
so often about Christianity. Mont
people do not care to investigate.
I as "faith, without investigation." is
! their only hope of a hereafter. Our
poor, illiterate ancestors really did
hrt\e a God, the Sun born of the
Virgin Dawn, who had his star of
the East, the morning star, without
whom they as well as we. could not
live, who looked down from such
heights, nothing could be hidden from
him, so they bowed before him ask
| ing him to forgive their sins, or
j vindicate their innocence, as he
i sailed up his course in the skies.
They asked him for their dail>
bread. 'He strangled the serpents of
night" (Hercules strangled the sei -
! pent in his cradle), did battle with
| storms (St. George killing the
i dragon). "Sometimes he burst
I forth at the end of his course.

Reason and Faith.
To the Editor. The Wahhiagtoe Herald:
In Monday's Herald Paul Mor
ris employed a convincing line of
reasoning to prove that the infal
lible route to the truth is through
reason, and that common senae. In*
! tuition and feeling are children or
[ superstition and brute ancestry, a
, thorough analysis of the numerous
i forces which make up our mankind.
as well as of the factors which de
| termine truth in all its phases, is
apt to lead but to the same con
clusion. That is freely granted.
There is. however, but one char
; acter in history who is the exponent
I of perfection, of truth: and he is not
a human. I refer to the Son of Oo?.
The salvation of mankind lies in the
endeavor to approach the truth in
| human conduct as exressed by re
j ligion. There Is no disposition
toward perfection nor is there any
! known example of it other than the
one mentioned above. I cannot but
believe that we who are humans
and human are infinitely wiser than
our Schopenhauers when we accapt
things as they are and endeavor to
, live according to our ideals, our
| common sense, our intuitions, as
well as our reason Faith in Oo<?
and in humanity, which are very
much alike, are worth more than
all the "scientific" discoveries bf
j our time.
