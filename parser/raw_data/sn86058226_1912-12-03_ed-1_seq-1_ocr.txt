ject. ' '
j The President stated that the rela

friendship." He pleaded, however, for
an extension of the diplomatic system,
stating "that Congress should fully
realize the conditions which obtain in
the world as we stand on the thres
hold of our middle age as a nation."
j Many important suggestions were
raade to Congress in the President's
message. Chief among them was his
'espousal of a more elastic tariff roeas-
tire for use in dealing with foreign
countries showing discrimination
against theproducts of American man
ufacturers.

CAR TRACKS TO
BE MOVED! ROAD
Commissioners Give Traction
Company Right to Move
to Middle of Road.
After thorough consideration the
county commissioners in a meeting,
which lasted until late, yesterday af-
(ot the Terre Haute, Indianapolis and
Eastern Traction company and resi-
' dents on the National Road east, to
i move the street car tracks from the
: south side of the road, to the middle,
! from Twenty-third street to the old
fair grounds
j The work of removing the tracks
j probably will not be attempted until
i late in the spring. At any rate this mat
; ter will be up to the officials of the
traction company and not to the coun
! ty as the present franchise which the
j company holds gives the company the
; power to determine Just when such
: matters are to be taken care of.
j However, the company will not of
I fer any obstacles to this work. Possi
) ble future objection was forestalled by
residents on the road by first placing
the matter before the company's offi
cials and then petitioning the county
commissioners.
The petitioners believe that Rich
mond will soon annex the suburb to
the east and that the tracks will be
moved, sooner or later, to the middle
of the road. Residents on the south
side of the road object to the cars be
ing operated directly in front of their
lawns.
TRUSTEES WILL

The trustees of the fifteen townships

at the office of the county superin
tendent, at the court house, Thursday.
The principal address will be deliv

subject, "Why Pupils Quit High

been given at the last meeting, but
Mr. Bond was unable to be present.
A CITY OFFICIAL
INVESTIGATES GAS
Kennepohl Says the Quality
Given Dayton Patrons Is
an Excellent One.
President B. A. Kennepohl, of the
board of works returned last night
from Dayton, Ohio, where he investi
gated the quality of natural gas being
used in that city. The source of the
natural gas being used in Dayton is
the same as that which will be used
by the company endeavoring to have
it installed in this city. He found the
gas to be of excellent quality and in
many cases it was used for heating
purposes'. His report is very encourag
ing to the city officials and citizens
who are interested in having the gas
installed.
President Kennepohl said it would
not be advisable for the city to give
the Richmond Light, Heat and Power
company the right to control the natur
al gas as it already has the artificial
gas monopolized until April, 1915,
when the franchise expires. The agent
who talked of bringing the gas here
refused to tell who was backing his
scheme and wished his name kept sec

LONDON MARKET CALM
Decision of Supreme Court,
in Face, Boosted Rail
road Stocks.
fVailon; Nowa Association)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. The direct
effect of the United States supreme
court ordering a dissolution of the
Harriraan merger of the Southern and
Union Pacific railroads was today de
clared so sweeping that the advocates
of a change in the Sherman anti-trust
law probably would curb their activi
ties and not press at the present time
any campaign for an amendment to
the measure. The decision was of such
strength that those who have feared
that the law was too weak after the
Tobacco and Oil trust decisions are
now wavering.
Lawyers who practice before the su
preme court say that the decision will
be far reaching in its general effect
upon the railroad situation. It fore
shadows the decree of the court in the
anthracite case in which the .govern
ment alleges that the Reading Railroad
unlawfully acquired control of the
Central of New Jersey and that the
Erie violated the Sherman law by ac
quiring control of a competing coal
road running from New York harbor
to the anthracite fields. It may even
extend to some of the New York, New
Haven & Hartford acquisitions.
Among the members of congress
the decision is of great interest par
ticularly to those who have been try
ing to amend further the anti-trust
laws. They infer from it ' that each
case of alleged illegal combination
will be held to stand on its own bot
tom and the facta in each subject
shall decide whether it is a restraint
of competition.

SOFIA, Dec. 3. Official announce
ment was made here this afternoon
that Kins Ferdinand has gone to Cha-
talJ'a to conduct the armistice negotla-

sonally to remove the Greek govern
ment's objections to the terms thus
far proposed. It is now stated that the

PESTILENCE STARTS.
BELGRADE, Dec. 3 Pestilence has
broken out in Albania and fears are
felt that ft will spread to Durazzo and
other Albanian towns where large bod
ies of Servian troops are stationed.
Hundreds of Albanians are falling vic
tims to smallpox, which disease is be
ing fostered by severe winter weather.
Few of the stricken receive any medi
cal attention.
TURKEY WANTS MORE.
BERLIN, Dec. 3. Turkey is rushing
the completion of armaments for a
continuation of war against Greece, ac
cording to a Constantiuople telegram
received here this afternoon.. It says
there are indications in the . Ottoman
capital that Bulgaria may on behalf
of herself and the Balkan states prop
er conclude peace to the exclusion of
Greece.

cret troop movements Austria has
massed 100,000 soldiers around Sera
blin, Hungary, which is across the
Danube river.
This practically completes Austria's
preparations for war with Servia.
- All the troops are equipped for ac
tive service. Troop trains which are
moving southward from Austrian mili
tary depots contain heavy ordnance.
For the first time today it was inti
mated that European diplomacy may
have been exerted through hidden
channels to start dissension among the
Balkan allies and weaken their
strength and prestige.
A Cause For Dispute.
This, it was pointed out, may have
been responsible for the dispute be
tween Greece and Bulgaria over ar
mistic terms.
The press of Vienna contained a
great amount of comment today on
the speech of Herr von Bethmann
Hellweg, the German chancellor in the
relchstag yesterday when he declared
that Germany will draw her sword if
any of her allies are attacked. This,
was agreed in a number of quarters
as an attempt to sooth Austria with
strong words rather than a declara
tion from the official spokesman of the
triple alliance as to the attitude of
that group.
While the matter of concluding a
general armistice between Turkey and
the allies was, hanging fire on account
of Greece's protests indications rose
to the surface that Roumania, the only
neutral Balkan state, may prove a big
factor in the final peace terms.
Roumania has declared that she will
secure some of the spoils of the Balkan
war as the price of her neutrality "if
she has to take up arms to get them."

The request of Superintendent DiH
of the Richmond City Water Works
that the water furnished in case of
fire through the automatic flushers in
business blocks be passed through a
meter and paid for, will not be granted
according to President Kennepohl of
the board of works. Mr. Dill made the
request on the grounds that the seal
on the flushers could be easily broken
and water stolen from the flushers.
The flushers are installed In nearly
all the business blocks of the city.
They are sealed with soft solder
which is so soft that it can be melted
by the heat of a match and water
thrown about the building where the
flushers are installed.
According to the president of the
board this will aid the water works
company financially as it win lessen
the amount of water used by the de
partment and will stop the advance

CHICAGO. Dec. 3 Lucile Cameron,

the negro heavyweight champing
pugilist.
This was the announcement made to
day by the prizefighter.
Johnson has been accused of entic
ing the girl from her home to this city.
Exposures that followed resulted in
Johnson being indicted by the United
States grand jury under the Mann act. !
The impending marriage will not af
fect his case before the federal court.
Johnson declared that he talked to
the Cameron girl over the 'phone and
that she was willing to marry him.
"We went over the matter," said John
son, " in a long talk we bad."
"I explained to her how we had got
mixed up together in the public prints,
how I had been blamed as if I had ill
treated or deceived her. and how, to
my mind, there was no reason why we
should not be married, legally and
properly.
"We have decided that the wedding
shall not be secret, though only a few

San Francisco to Win
$8,000 for His Father.
Harry Danes, Wisconsin's pride and
joy, is right here with us. He blew in
this morning from New Paris, and
with him came a military outfit that, is
nifty. Khaki suit, cavalry hat, a sav
age looking revolver and canvass leg
gings. Harry looks his part.
He isn't a soldier of fortune. Not this
chap. He will leave Richmond tomor
row for Indianapolis on his way from
New York to San Francisco to win a
$8,000 wager for his dad who lives
in the big city. If he succeeds In ne
gotiating the distance in record time,
$2000 of the pile, he says, will be bis.
Here's hoping. Harry!
Behind somewhere in Pennsylvania
is Walter Standow, ertswhile compan
ion of the continental pedestrian.
Danes says Standow is "chickenheart
ed." Standow got cold feet east of
Pittsburg, and decided that the flesh
pots of New York were more alluring
than prairie dogs in the great Ameri
can desert.
Back in New Jersey lies a dog that
started out with the outfit. "That do
did not have the nerve for the trip,"
is Danes' verdict on the canine. "He
laid down and died for no reason."
So, unattended and alone. Danes is
hoofing it westward. He says he'll get
there in record time. "See the gun."
said he pointing to a vicious looking
revolver. George R. Beecher, a Colum
bus merchant, gave me that popgun
for smashing the world's record in
walking fifty miles in ten hours."
Has a Register.
Like countless other long distance
hikers. Danes has a register with him.
Noteworthy mortals are permitted to
inscribe their names in it. Two repor
ters got their John Hancock's in the
book today. They felt honored, and
Danes liked their penmanship.
But to come back to Harry. Danes
says he worked on the farm. How he
got from a Wisconsin dairy farm to
New York matters not. neither does it
boot a farthing how he got the idea
of taking the jaunt. If dad gets the
$8,000, and Harry eays he surely will,
papa's boy is getting the youngest
son's share if he only makes $2000 for
impressing himself on all the weary
miles between New York and San
Francisco. But he has the consolation
of seeing some mighty interesting sce
nery, especially in level Kansas and
in dust and alkali covered Arizona and
New Mexico.
Harry looked fresh this morning and
was far from jaded when he strolled
into the Palladium office. He is inspir
ed with the promise of two pack mules
that are awaiting him on a western
ranch. "Mr. Beecher i a good sport.
He gave me the gan and a cane, and
those two jacks will have to carry the
grub and water when we hit the des
ert." Harry was on the streets today. Ev
ery kid in town envied the smart look
ing chap. Some mothers had their
hands full to dissuade youngsters from
following the indubitable Harry from
Egypt to the Promised Land. WelL
Harry still has the wilderness ahead
of him. here's a pleasant journey, old
chappie! .. .
And Now They Must Go to

They Should Not Pay for

A COSTLY ONEj
United States Amusement
Company Caught Many
Unsophisticated Investors!
in Richmond.
Several of the forty-two residents ofj
Richmond and Wayne county, involved j
in the case, or their attorneys, will go'
to Logans port Friday morning where j
they will be heard on motion for sepJ
arating the causea of action in the
case of James H. McKernan. receiver,
versus George Moriarity, et al. .
This case is the culmination of a!
farce played upon a number of Wayna
county people and othera in the state.
The suit was filed about one year ago
in the Cass circuit court by the receiv
er of the United States Amusement'
company. The receiver of the com
pany is attempting to collect money
alleged to be due on subscriptions of
stock taken by local people. It ia al
leged that people in Wayne county
who subscribed to stock owe from $1
to $100 each on their stock.
Some time ago agenta of the United
States Amusement company literally,
covered Wayne county in aelllng'
stock. The shares sold for $10 each.
The plan, aa outlined by the agents,!
was to sell shares throughout the
state and to erect moving picture (
theaters in the larger towns of the
state. The stockholders were then 1
to share in the dividends.
Geldbrlck Scheme.
No, it wasn't really a "goldbrick"
scheme but some of the "stock" hold-,
ers, locally, at least, believe that it;
could be classified under such a head.
-JLtJfcaa, re prompted that option on e:
lot at Tenth and Main and on a build
ing at Sixth and Main had been secur-1
ed. Aa soon as the stock waa cub
scribed a nice, new "Nickelodeon" was
to be erected, and each of the stock
holders was to be permitted to Tiait
the show aa often as he desired. No,
they wouldn't have to pay admission.
The fact la one or two picture
shows were opened in as many cities
in the state, but local stockholders
realized nothing. Consequently they,
refused to pay all of the stock for
which they had subscribed.
The "officials" of the U. S. A. com-,
pany "skipped" out It ia said. "It waaj
something like the old game of snipe
huntin. said one stockholder today,!
"You see we were left out in the!
cold, hold in' the bag. We never caught'
any snipe, however."
Following the unceremonious de-.
parture of the officials a receiver was
appointed and he has filed auit against
the stockholders to collect on stock
subscribed.
