THE WEEKLY DEMOCRAT.

President's Message.
On our outside will bo found the
message of the Preeiderit, which
is a plain unpretending review of
the condition of public affair.',
and contains no suggestions to
. Congress, that is either new or
- novel. After dealiug another of
the blows At the fiauking privi
lege to which that venerable a---,
ibuee has become very well used,
. the President declares his appro
val of Postmaster General Ores
-" well's postal telegraph scheme,
but does not think the subject
. can be disposed of in the present
session of congress. The appre
hensions of those who recognize
in this scheme not merely a vast
job for private aggrandizementat
the expense of the country, but a
dangerous interference of govern
ment with the most private affairs
of the people, were not at fault.
President Grant is now fully com
mitted to this enterprise, and
- ; may be expected to sustain it with
. all the power of his administra
tion. Supported by a powerlu
lobby supplied with abundant
means of persuasions, it will be
next to impossible to defeat this
scheme in the coming congress.
It will be a partial realization .cf
that paternal policy of govern
ment which has found so many
admirers in the recent political
... 4 history of the country. Railroads
and canals will next be absorbed
and finally all the busiuess of the
people will be conducted by dif-
ferent bureaus of administration.
This scheme will give tothegov
ernment the control of not les9
than 60,000 new office holders.
and supervision of the entire tele
graphic correspondence of the
country. In an exciting campaign
; At ia easy to conceive bt the ad.
' ' vantages it would give to the par
ty manipulating the wires. Louis
Napoleon has already shown the
world what terrible uses he could
make o! a government telegraph
when he throttled the French Re
public. Bat his example-will
doubtless powerfully recommend
this telegraph scheme to the lea
ders of the oblican party. A
measure of legislation more par
tial and unjust, more completely
"'"in .the interest of the few at the
expense of the many could scarce
ly be devised. In a boundless
einntry like this, the annual de
ficit to the treasury under a re
duction of rates, would be enor-
: mous, and that burden would fall
on the masses of -taxpayers ( who
makes exceedingly small use of
the telegraph. Of the farmers
and mechanics of Ohio how-many
are there who usethe telegraph
wires and who in their correspon-
-. dence cannot await the. course of
th e mails? Of the 800,000 negroes
who voted for Grant how many
send a dispatch in a year? Yet
the vast majority-of the people
are to bo inflicted with this bur
den for the advantage of the few,
The scheme, however, has been
recommended by th President
and it, therefore, becomes a por
tion of the policy of his party.
General Maxwell committed
suicide in Dayton last week, by
shf oting himself through the
head. Financial embarrassment
is supposed to he the cause. ; His
1 'funeral took place on Monday
last, and is said to have been the
largest seen in that city since
that of Mr. Vallandiham.
A series of 'well defined gold
bearing veins have been discov
ered near Kelley's Ford, Virginia,
five miles from the Rappahan
nock station. The surface rock
of gold bearing quartz yields
lrom sixty to one hundred dollars
per ton. Three tunnels are now
.being worked through a rich rock,
'and everything gives evidence of
permanency.
The Electoral College. The
Presidential Electors re-assembled
in the Senate Chamber Dec.
4 at 12 a..m., and with a proper
amount of solemnity all cast their
votes for U. S. Grantlbr President
and Henry Wilson for Vice Pres
ident. Dolly Vardeu, though popular
as a name, has proved very un
profitable to manufacturers and
dealers in dress goods, many of
whom have been driven to the
verge of bankruptcy by investing
la large stocks of this class.
S.
Presidential Clemency!
From Washington comes the
very ttartlirg news that Presi
des! t Grant has pardoned Hodges,
the paj master who swindled the
Government ou of some 400,000
although he has not yet strved
ono-seventh part of the period
for winch he was sentenced. A
year ami a haif ago, when this
polished robber vs doomed to
ten years in State prison, the Ad
ministration orgaiis exulted in
glowing eulogies of Grant and
his determination to stamp our
Tweedism in Federal offices by
making terrible examples of cul
prits caoght and con victed. Ever
since then the case of Houges
has been held up as a sample of
the administration of Federal
justice in contrast to the taso of
Tweed in Nev York. 4iTi:er?,"
poiuting to llodgs, "is what -we
do with our rascals,'' the Federal
orgaus were never tired of shout
ing. They never forgot to add,
in the next breath, "There,"
pointing to Tweed "is the way the
Democrats tried their thieves."-
The argument of the comparison
uuaouDteaiy naa yeiut tin
many people. When, during the
campaign, a report gained circu
lation that Hodges was to be
pardo.ned, it was judignautly de-
niedby the Administration press,
It will now be interesting to note
how these same journals will ac
count for the President's clemen
cy (!) in ordering the criminal's
release so soon after election and
before Hodges ha3 Berved one

tner or ins eon, Ulysses, nas got
the President into a very un
pleasant position. Like a good
son (no matter what may be
thought of the act as President.)
he made father Jesse a postman
ter. Jesse drew the pay with
out doing the duties. Finally
Jesse got sick and continued ill
so long that scandal compelled
a new appointment. A Mr,
Eastern was chosen, Jesse got
well, got his venerable backup,
and Easton was compelled, to re-
sign. To Mr. Grant's credit, as
President, he wrote back beg-
ging Easton to euspeu i action,
and expressing regret that his

will have 199, and the Democrats

will have more than a two-thirds
majority in that body after the

The Grant party having been
fairly beaten in New Orleans and

The California election law has
feome novel features. According
to an act passed by the Lcgisla-
ture, the ballot is printed in long
primer Capital letters, ';on paper
of uniform size, color, weight,
texture and appearance, twelve
inches long by four inehr-s wide,
and folded crosswise four times
from the centre bo as to make the
ballot three fourths of an inch in
size and pressed Hat." The law
ah?o provides that "uo ballot must
be used having any mark or thing
on the back or outside thereof
whereby it might be distinguish
ed from any other ballot legally
used." Also-v that "all erasures
of names of candidates and sub
stitutions of others mnft be made
with a lead pencil or common
writing ink. All nthei orations
or substitutions will be n-jected."
This does away with "pasters'' al
together. 2Jo person is allowed
to exhibit the contents of a bal
lot within 100 teet of .the polls
nor reqneft any one else to do so
under very severe penalties of
the code.
There was a noble youth, who,

derment and surprise.
