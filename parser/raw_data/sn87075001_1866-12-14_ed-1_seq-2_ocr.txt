The Political Aspect in Washington.
.
. A special corrssponrJentoC .the Cin.
rinnati Enquirer -writes ft follows :
WASHINGTON, December 6.
1 came to the Capital this day
week. ago to witness the inauguration
of the revolutionary nob that was call
ed to meet here, for the ostensible pur
poso of giving a welcome to the Iladf
cal Congress, but for the real purpose
of overawing tlie President,' and stiff
ening the backbone of such Radical
members as folt disinclined to ' depose
that official from the office of Chief
Magistrate. I expected to witness, a
re-enactment of some of the scene of
ta French Kevolntion, where the mob
gave tone and direction to the Assem
bly, and demanded and received' the
life of the King., '
The mob did not tome off, and aim
ply for the want of funds to bring the
bad clcrnent hero. , The bad material
expected to bo here by the managers
did not como, because they had not
the means to ooms:' The numbers
that did come were too small to run so
large a macbino, and hide the 'leaders;
Im-iico it was determined to make the
affair assume a Tery peaceful and in
ifnifiennt appearance. A little show,
a little pcakin, eating and drinking,
closed tvbnt was intended to be ft very
'formidable and tnisebievons concern.
Many I lnay eny a large majority
cf the Radical members, on their
advent here, Verb either opposed to
the impeachment of tho President, or
were very indiffercnton the suljoct.
Doubts of the propriety,' and fear of
the consequences, indisposed a major
ity of them to meddle with the Presi
dent bimj)oachminghim. But.sinco
tho 'caucuses, ajjd withina, day or wo,
there has been quite a change of tone
among the Radicals, and the President
i In more danger of Impeachment to
day than be was on monday last; and
tbo feeling in that direction isgrowing
and strengthening. I am satisfied
that fear alono of financial troubles
will prevent , this . Congress deposing
the President leforo the 1th' of .March
next. . Mr. Johnson may ;iot be aware
of Ibis, but it is nevertheless the true
state of the case.
The Radicals will try a guerrila war
on the president for a white. They
believe Uiey can scare him into sub
mission to their demands. I know
they believe him to" be destitute of
physical courage, and hence they think
that he will not have the moral courage
oppose what they are pleused to cul'
"the will of the people as expressed at
the late State elections." Of course,'
if tbey can accomplish their purposes
with Mr. Johnson as President, it would
be great foil y in them to risk all by at
tempting his deposition. They will,
therefore, commence by Tiiaking tho
Presidential office of (is1 trifling account
as possible. - They will curtail his pa
tronage, limit his influence; and make
'all who desire Federal favors look more
to Congress than ' the Exeotive for
them. The Assembly of the JSjople.
as some of them now call Congress,1
must now'be regarded as tho fountain
of power and patronage, and the Pres-"
i Jent of small account. That i simply
pelting the boy in the apple-tree with
sods.. If they do not bring bin. &wn
harder missiles will be used. If the
President will not yield to these guer
rilla measures, the more formidable
oi. e of impeachment will be resorted
to regardless of consequences.
For, murk you, if the President is
firm, tbo Radicals cannot succeed in
carrying out their programme. , lie
will, to the cikT; be the lion in their
path. Thoy must have negro suffrage
tarried out. It is necessary to the life
of tho Kadical, party. vfl It will die un
less it secures negro' BuiTrago. Hon.
Ren. Stanton, formerly ofOhio, .s.nd a
leading - Republican, :. "demonstrated
that fact in ft recent speech ftt Phila
delphia. " He B')dv6d that the govern
ing political party is in ft large- mlnori
tj of the people of all the States, ex
cluding the blacks; and that it is abso
lutely neoessary to count the blacks
on the side of the Republicans to give
that political organization'" the moral
prestige of including in its folds ft ma
jority ol the whoU people. He, there
fore, urges Congress to declare -very
cHiserf of the Unfted States to be enti
tle U like political rights and priv.
leges
. His views are those: of ft largo
majority of Congress, affl as itrequlres
a tnaioritr onlr of the members f tho
House to prefer articles 'cf ' impch-that
ment. Ton mar dereftdiUDoa it. J Mr.
Johnson will be impeached nnlops he
lots down, and allows Congress to have
its own way in reconstructing the late
"rebellious States."
Wirl the Pi evident lot down? Can
ho be frightened Into submission?
TL ere are two, opinions'' prevalent-
Thoie who know Mr. Johnson best sny
that he will never yield an iota of his
policy, nor t arry out any imposed on
him that he believes to be unconstitu
tional. If such is his determination,
the Radicals can not succeed in carry
ing out their programme, and will be
compelled to depose him to succeed.
Others believe that he will jield to the
pressure and make his penco with the
Radicals, by submitting to their policy
after they shall havo parsed it over his
veto; and this opinion is foanded on the
fact that the ' President has not the
moral courage to carry out bis own
convictions, .us expressed in his official
messages and popular addresses, by
issuing a proclamation of general am
nesty, and relieving the people of the
South of military rule, not enforced on
him by any law of Congress.
There can be no doubt of one thing
t: t Mr. Johnson is cither too timid or
too indifferent to the porils'of his own
situation for the crisis in which he is
placed. . lie seems to act as if ho was
not manter of the sitoatioa, and did
uot know his own power. The" Radi
cul s arc aware of tho dubious stato of
Mr. Jolinson'smind,and will, therefore,
crowd him the harder. ,
Iho poii.ts the Radicals will aim to
carry out. are these, so far ns ' the
w
Southern unrepresented Strtesare con
ccrned: .....
1. Tho exiHting State governments
Sonth must be declared ( to be illegal
The States must be declared to bo .ter
ritories.
i. A law must bo passed called an
enabling act," under which new govern
rnouta lor eacu ct those states can be
formed, the constitution of each of
which muk Resubmitted to Congress
for its npproval.
3. -That enabling act unist declare
who shall vote for delegates to . the
convention to mako tho new constitu
tion. It must disfranchise those who
took part in the war for the South,
and declare all others to bo voters,
without regard to race or color.
That law carried out, it is supposed,
would put the control of each of the
unrepresented States in the lmnda of
the Southern loyalists. And, if ii
hhould happen that the freedmen
should be influenced by their old. mas
ters, and vote delegates not of theright
stripe, Congress has the power to re
ject the constitution framed by such
delfates, though approved by those
entitled to vote on it.'
Such an enabling act will be passed,
unless the Radicals are suro of secu
ring the" next President. If sure of
that, they will wait; for their whole ob
ject is to perpetuate the power of their
party. If not sure of that; then the
counsels of Ren. Butler will be followed
and the President impeached and de-
poi
osed, if not previously gotten rid of
bv death;
A joint resolution will be pased de
claring that the votes of none of tho
unrepresented States for ! elector of
President and Vice President y 1868,
shall be co anted (.That will be a nest
egg for a new civil war. But there
will be no necessity for it. if President
Johnson, after vetoing the enabling
act, and it shall bo passed over his veto,
shall cary it out. If be will execute
the law, the peoplo of tho South will
hK at the mercy ot tno Kauicais. it he
will not execute it, the law cannot be
carried into operation without terrible
scenes of blood, in which the blacks
will be the main sufferers.
The conclusion of my mind is, that
tno luture is luilxit doubt ana uncer
tainty; that there is no prospect of n
speedy harmonising of tho' country;
that strife and sectional bitterness will
be increased; that mercantile embar
rassments -will multiply; that trad
will languish; that general distrust
will take hold of the pubhc inind, and
that a genoral financial and political
crash will close the ' cloudy and con
stantly darkening scene. 11 '
Some sensation has been created bv
the unnouncement that Surratt,' one of
the" alleged Accomplices of the assassi
nation of Mr. Lincoln; has been arrest
ed in Egypt, and is on his wuy to this
louit'try. ' It is hoped that thelreport

.1 tl.t'lAt ' '' '
muBu iDsinuaiions. j ,
., However, it is not doubted by many
here, who know the malignity of the
leading Radicals to the President, that
efforts will be made to induce .Surratt,
on promise of Congressional .influence
to save him, to accuso President. John
son with being accessory to the mur
dor of Mr. Lincoln. If Surrat can be
made a tool of for that parpose, no
scruples will be mado tonso him by the
Ben. Butlers, Forneys, Wades and that
class of Radical leaders. Good men
will rejoice that a regular judicial tri
bunal will try Surrutt,whcre testimony
can be sifted, and weighed by legal
scales, and where such perjured wit
nesses as Conover, and the pregctico'et
Judge Advocate Holt, will have no in
fluence on the court and jury. There i
now some prospect of getting at the
correct history of this horrid and de
plorable transaction. .
Theroison evident storm brewing
between the Secretary of the Treasury
and tho Radical Members of Congress.
The latter accuse the former of playing
into tho hands of JcvHuin gold und
stock operators, and declare that more
certainty must be imparted to the
money market, or a financial crash and
guat mercantile disaster cannot long
be averted. The Secretary of the
Ireasury is for a return to specie pay
meets as soon an possible. - Leading
Congressmen declare that specie pay
ment will come of "itself whenever the
country is . ready JVr. it, end , that to
force it' will ruin Lundrcds of thous
ands of peoplo by producing sudden
fluctuation! in Varkct value?. There
is'. no doubt about cue thing that ft
healthy mercantile and trading busi
ness cannot be oixliK.-ted on .an irre
deemable and price fluct framing curren
cy. I he secretary or tue lreasnry
sees that, and wjints to come down tr
the specie basis the basis of the final.
cial operations of the whole world
But he is chargetfwith workingitytftfy
to aid his friends,Jay Copko and others.
His power in that respect is immense,
and if what is charged iu private cir
cles against him is correct, he " should
bo immediately removed. " '
Canada and the Fenians.
The New York Freeman's Journal,
that has alwayB opposed . Funianisni,
says of the late proceedings of the Ca
nadian Courts
; Do the Canadians dream so idly as
to suppose that such a systom of out
rage, under the mockery of lawi will
be endured on the borders of the United
States ? TFe can assnre them that hun
dred of thousands of Americans who
opposed the Fenian raid last summer,
will appland and further a conquest of
every foot of Canadian soil, if one man,
of tho' late raidors is hangod by so' ex
ecrable, and unjust a process as they
have been subjected to in Toronto I
Canada will, most assuredly, be inva
ded, and overrun; and no judge, or
juryman, or 'officer of any kindwho
promoted; ohelpod on the conviction
of theso prisoners, will be able to find
any hiding place from Fenian ven
gonuce, in Cauada or North America.
The next two years' are to bo do
voted, by American politicians, to se
curing the Presidential election in No
vember, 1SC8. The Feniau vote, and
the vote of their sympathisers, is going
to bo unscrupulously, sought by both
parties. The States of New York and
Michigan, and Illinois, with their Gov
ernors, will strive to prove themselves
more Feniun thaa the General Govern
ment at Washington. Seward's obse
quiousness to British interests, in the
last raid, will not be repoated. In fact,
a foreign war would be a God send, just
now, to the Washington Government
and no war would bo so popular, or so
desirable, as one with England and her
possessions. . ,
XTnjcrupulousnbHs is the modern law
p '2 :,"...r.'.' ' t. '
vi jj v uii.int oi . t is non
sense to, fumble over precedents of law,
or moral dicta, when the urgent in
terests of a' great power bespeak a war.
The pext visit of a' United States' army
to the Canadian, frontier,. njayr .nioet
probably, not be to repres a. Fenian
raid, tut to demand aoconptof trucu
lent and ' insrncere.i Government, why
