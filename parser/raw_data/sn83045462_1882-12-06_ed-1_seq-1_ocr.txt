Mr. P. McNbrhanv has been appointed to a
clerkship in the Quartermaster General's office,
made vacant by the death of Gen. G. C. Thomas.
This Is an excellent appointment.
Governor-elect Butler Dines With the President.?The
President entertained Governor-elect
Butler, Mr. M. W. Cooper, of New York, and Private
Secretary Phillips at dinner last evening at
the Soldiers' Home.
The Postaoe on the double-sheet Star Is two
cents. Thfi-Post Office department requests persons
sending newspapers by mall to write their

the President to-day were Senators McMillan,
Sewell, Harrison. Blair and Miller, of New York;
Speaker Keifer, Representatives Van Horn, Pound,
Fisher, Ketch tin, Kelley. Speer, Page, Lacey. Anderson,
Hardenburg. Reed, Post, Van Arnurn,

The Following Bid for terra cotta work was
received at Gen. Meigs' office on Monday last. It
appears that it came as a registered letter on the
1st of December. The notice of Its reception at
the Washington post oftlc-? was sent by mistake to
the Quartermaster General's office, and did not
reach Gen. Meigs until Monday morning. Therefore
the bid, which arrived In proper time in
Washington, was not received and read at the
opening of bids on Saturday, December 2d: Boston
Terr* Cotta Co., for terra cotti, according to
specifications and drawings, $16,038. The bid suggests
many other applications of terracotta In the
new Pension building, which are offered for $16,342
additional. '
The Vacant Army Paymasterpiiip.?Who will
be appointed to the vacant paymastershlp In the
army is a matter of considerable speculation In
army circles Just now. The name most prominently
mentioned at present In connection with
the appolntm?nt Is that of Lieut. Alexander Rodf
ers. or the 4th cavalry, son of Admiral Rodgers.
f tnls appointment 13 made it will create a good
deal of ill reeling in the ar:nv. The officers don't
squirm as much when a civilian Is given a p aymastershfp
as when a young lieutenant Jumps
over the heads of his seniors to a position of major.
Then It hurts.

The Utah Commission, In its report to the Secretary
of the Interior, recommends that a marriage
law be cnact ed by Congress declaring all future
marriages void unless witnessed by certain designated
persons and registered in specltle Dublic
offices. Female suffrage is regarded by the commission
as an obstacle in the way of the efforts
for the suppression of polygamy.
TnE Annual Opening of Bids to furnish the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing with supplies
needed In Its work took place at that bureau today
at noon. There were 145 bids received, and
schedules covering 455 different articles. It will
take some time to tabulate and comptre the different
bids on all the articles. This work has been
placed in the hands or a committee, and will be
completed as soon as practicable. Notices will be
given out to all Interested, Includingsuocessrul
and unsuocessrul bidders. The items of most local
int. rest are Cumberland coal find lee, and on the
former Mr. John Miller, at $4.94 per ton, Is the
lowest bidder, and on Ice the lowest bidder, the
Knickerbocker Ice Company, at 39140. per 100
pounds.
Why Col. Laidlry Askbd to be Retired.?
The retirement of Col. Theodore T. 8. Laldley,
which was announced yesterday, was caused by a
feud or several years standing between that officer
and Gen, Benet, chfer of ordnance. The ill-reeling
began when.Gen. Benet w is promoted to be chief
or ordnance. Col Laldley was seven years his
senior, and naturally feP slighted when his junior
In experience was made his superior In authority.
The official relations between the two officers did
not Improve with time, and only a short time ago
Gen. Benet exercised ills authorliy by causing the
removal or Col L-ddlcy from the command of the
Watertown arsenal, near Boston, and having hi in
assigned to the command or the insignificant
Piecatinny powder depot. Here hi? principal duty
would be to see that the men rolled the powder
barrels around to keep the powder from caking.
Col. Laldley was powerless to help matters, and
rather than be so humbled he demanded to be retired,
having served over forty years.

Mr. Johnston offered a resolution for the printing
of 10,000 copies of the report of the proceedings
of the Yorktown Centennial commission; rej
ferred to committee on printing.
THB ARLINGTON ESTATE.
Mr. Edmunds offered a resolution Instructing
the committee on the Judiciary to inquire and report,
by bill or otherwise, whether any further
legislation Is necessary to secure the title of the
United States to the national soldiers' cemetery at
Arlington. He explained that this was mado
necessary by the recent decision of the Supreme
Court In relation to the rights of Gen. Lee. The
J resolution was unanimously agreed to.
j THE PENSION ROLL.
At the close of the morning hour Mr. Piatt called
up his resolution, offered yesterday, asking the
Commissioner of Pensions to furnish certain information
in reference to the pension roll and the
probable effect upon It of the passage of the pending
bill to increase the pensions of persons who
have lost an arm or a leg in the service or are
suffering from equivalent disabilities.
Mr. Berk moved to amend by further Instructing
the Commissioner, without delaying the Information
called for In the resolution, to transmit also,
as soon as practicable, a complete list of all persons
borne on the pension roll, and claimants for
pensions, with their addresses and the amounts of
their pensions respectively. Adopted.
Mr. Logan said that the Information called for,
so far as It related to one-armed and one-legged
soldiers, was already In possession of the committee
on pensions, and he therefore moved to except
that class. The Commissioner of Pensions
had already Informed the committee that
the proposed Increase of pensions to
one-armed and one-legged soldiers would amount
to $2,2-10,48 X.
Mr. Piatt said that the bill proposed to
Increase the pensions not only of this class but
also or persons suffering under equivalent disabilities;
and the committee desired to ascertain what
additional expenditure this would make necessary.
Mr. Voorheesagreed with Mr. Logan that the Information
already m pos-esslon ot the committee
on pensions was sufficient to enable the Senate to
art upon the pending bill for the relief of onearmed
and one-legged soldiers.
GEN. FITZ JOHN PORTER.
Mr. Sewell gave notice that he would call up at
an early day the bill for the relief of General Fltz
J John Porter.

POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS AT THE LATE ELECTIONS.
j Mr. Willis, of Kentucky, offered a resolution In
the House to-day directing the committee on civil
service reform to inquire whether at the recent
congressional election money was raised by assessment
or otherwise from federal office-holders
or employes for political purposes, and If so by
whom, and what amount was so raised and how
the same was collected and expended,and whether
such assessment was not In violation of law?
Tlie District in Congress.
FIRST MEETING OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE?THB
UNION DEPOT BILL?THE QUESTION OF TAXES, ETC.
The Senate district committee will hold Its first
meeting of the session to-morrow and will establish
Thursday of each week as Its regular day of
meeting. This being the short session, the committee
will take up only such questions as are of
real Importance to the District. It Is the purpose
to press the union depot bill, flrlth the view of
making It a law. The municipal code will also be
pressed for consideration, In the hope of getting it
through at this session. The committee also regard
the subject of the assessment and collection
or taxes as one calling for special attention. They
consider the existing laws as very defective and
the prevailing opinion among the members seems
to be that the best plan will be to enact a new law
to supersede all existing laws and to regulate the
whole matter ot the assessment and collection of
taxes. The Idea seems to be to frame a law rigid
lnalllts provisions for the collection of taxes; alaw
that wll> compel the rich man as well
as the poor man to pay his taxes.
The Senate committee will probably wait
to see what measures the House committee proposes
before Introducing a new bill. It Is quite
Erobable that a new tax law will be passed, and it
t likely that It will contain a provision for tax
sales; a provision authorizing th^sale of property
for taxes, and making a tax certificate a lien on
the property sold.
CLAIMS AGAINST THB DISTRICT.
In the House this morning Mr. Rosecrans, of
California, Introduced a bill to amend the law
creating the Court of Claims so as to extend Its
Jurisdiction to and give the court legal and equitable
jurisdiction of all claims now existing against
the District of Columbia arising out of contracts
made by the late board of pnbilc works and extensions
thereof made by the District Commissioners
since the passage of the act of June 20th,
1874, and of all claims for work done by direction
or order of the Cctmmlssloners and accepted by
them tor the use or benefit of the District and
prior to the 14th day of March, 1876; also, all certificates
of the auditor, all claims based on contracts
made by the levy court, all s?wer certificates
not converted Into 3-65 bonds, all measurements
made since February 21st, 1871, for wnlch no
certificates have been issued, and all claims based
upon contracts, oral or written, made by the vice
president of the board of public works alter the 8th
of October, 1871. The bill was referred to the District
committee.
THB DISTRICT APPROPRIATION BILK
Gen. Ketchara, of New York, who will have In
charge the preparation of the bill for the support
of the government of the District ot Columbia,
will at once enter upon that duty. He finds himself
considerably embarrassed, however, because
In many instances the Commissioned have lumped
their estimates Instead of setting them out In detalL
This will delay him In his work until he receives
such Information more specifically.
Capitol IVoUHi*
Senator Beck expects to get a vote to-morrow on
his resolution to investigate political assessments,
and he thinks it wilt be adopted.
The debate started in the Senate to-day on the
bankruptcy bill will continue ror several days at
least, as several Senators want to speak on that
subject.
It is evident now that the Senate Is not inclined
to take up the subject oi tax redaction until after
the republicans shall have consulted together as
to what should be done.
The indications are that the Senate will vote to
take the usual Christmas holiday.
Two Senators have been re-elected within the
last few days?Messrs. Morgan, of Alabama, and
Butler, of South Carolina, senators Coke, of
Textis, and Harris, of Tennessee, will be re-elected
to succeed themselves shortly, as both are practically
without opposition.

THB GOVERNMENT'S TITLE TO ARLINGTON CEMETERY.
Mr. Elmunds introduced, Ih the Senate to-day,
a resolution directing the Judiciary committee to
Inquire into the matter of title to the U. SL cemetery
at Arlington. He referred to the recent decision
of the Supreme Court, and said that If Gen.
Lee holds title to the property- It Is necessary for
the United States to acquire its title, and to

Senator Anthony today Introduced a bill pro,
hlbitlng any letting or the Capitol, except for the
' uses of Congress and the Supreme Court, with the
exception that during the reoesaes of Congress
. the President may permit the Capitol to be used
for funerals only. The occupation of the Capnol
by the late fair and the delay In removing the
booths, etc., have been the subject of complaint
by Judges of the Supreme Court and by members
of Congress, and this bill Is to prevent anything of
the kind la future.

had a meeting this morning and assigned the bills
before It to sub-committees. Messrs. Singleton,
Lewis and Cook were appointed a sub-committee
to report on the bill for the purchase by the
government of the house in which President Lincoln
died. The committer appointed Mr. W. I.
Reed, of Beaver, Pa., to be clerk, In place of Jas.
L Andrem, who resigned to go as clerk with the
tariff commission.
CLERKSHIP OP THB NEXT HOUSE.
Representative Atkins, of Tennessee, has signified
a willingness, at the request of his friends, to
be a candidate for the clerkship of the House. Mr.
Atkins Is quite popular among southern and western
members. He is prominent In the councils of
his party, and served for two years as chairman
of the committee on appropriations.
THE BILL TO ENLARGE THE WHITE HOUSE.
Representative Shallenberger, chairman of the
House committee on public buildings and grounds,
Is of the opinion that the bill which has passed
the Senate to enlarge the White House will not be
passed by the House. He says there seems to be
no public sentiment In Its favor, and chat the
President Is not specially anxious to have It become
a law.
THE COMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
of the House met this morning and discussed the
Pendleton, the Kasson and the Dawes bills touching
the subject. The committee has the floor on
the 12th Inst, to report a bill to reform the service.

litigants as well as oppressive.
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.
The sub-committee of the House appropriations
committee, Messrs. Burrows, Robeson and Cox,
had a meeting this morning and further considered
the diplomatic appropriation bllL
It Is now determined to await further action on
the pensions appropriation bill until the report of
the commissioner of pensions Is printed. This
will make the consideration of the diplomatic bill
the next work for the full committee and probably
the next appropriation bill to be reported to the
House.
MR. CAINB'S CLAIM TO REPRE :ENT UTAH.
Representative Moulton, of Illinois, speaking Of
the claims of Mr. Calne to occupy the seat as delegate
from "Utah, vacated by the ousting of Mr.
Cannon, said that though Calne was voted for to
All the vacancy, and received 16,000 votes, no election
was ordered. Governor Murray refused to
order an election on the ground that he doubted
his authority to do so under the Elinunds act.
The matter will be referred to the sub-elections
committee, of which Mr. Moulton is chairman.
Mr. Moulton says that in view of the existing feelIns
Against the Mormons, he thinks that the
technicalities in the case will be recognized, and
the irregularity of no election having been ordered
with others of a like character, will defeat Mr,
Calne's claim to a seat at the present session.

How Torn Ochiltree Got Elected.
A Texas Congressman was asked by a Star re- i
porter how it was that Tom Ochiltree was elected
to Congress in his state from a democratic district
He replied that It was a surprise at first, but that
after looking over the field those acquainted with
all the facts could account for it Said he, "CoL
Flnley, who ran against Ochiltree, Is a clever 1
and smart man, but our state committee adopted
a tarlff-for-t^venue platform. Flnley tried to carry
water on both shoulders by claiming to be a protectionist
In the wool-growing section of the district
The democrats concluded that a man who
would not stand to his platform was not entitled
to their support and voted for Ochiltree.n

The Lehigh Valley Railroad Diaaater.
horrible fate of railhoad men?narrow escape
of passengers.
Elmira, N. Y., Dec. A?The fatal and destructive
collision of yesterday on the Lehigh Valley railroad,
at Rummersfleld station, 45 miles south of
here, occure l at four o'clock in the morning. The
road Is double-tracked north of Rummersfleld, but
has only a single track south thereof. On Wie east
track, north of the junction, stood a south-bound
freight train, waiting for the north-bound express
train to pass. Owing to a confusion of signals the
engineer of the latter train, which had been
slowed up, was thrown on the east track, and
a frightful crash followed. The locomotive
mounted the wreck It had caused, and was
In turn mounted by the express car in its rear,
which broke squarely in two, almost on top of the
pile, throwing the baggage man and mall messenger
IntoUie air without, however, inflicting
serious Injuries on either. Two sleeping cars,
which followed the express, remained on the
track, and none of the passengers were hurt. In
the rear coaches only one man Is said to have
been injured. The air brakes prevented a fearful
loss of life. On the engine of the express train
were Engineer Wharen and Fireman Davis,
neither of whom had time to jump after turning
on the a?r brakes. The latter was taken from the
wreck with probably fatal Injuries, and conveyed
home. Wharen, although pinned In the wreck,
was rescued before being seriously burned or
maimed.
thb most terrible fatb of all
befel Freight Engineer N. Fauske and Fireman
Leander Kinsman, both of Wuverly. The latter
was burled near the lire pot of his own locomotive
nnd probably killed Immediately, although he may
liave been burned to death, as his charred remains
were subsequently discovered ard removed. The
wreck was in flames five minutes after the crash,
as some of the cars were loaded with hay. Engineer
Fauske was pinioned In the cab of his own
wrecked locomotive. He saw the flames spreading
around him and called the train hands to cut
away the cab. His riirlit leg could not oe extrisated,
and he knew he must roast alive
unless the cabl n coul 1 be cut away. Several men
tried with the utmost energy to relese him, but
the flames grew and spread so rapidly that they
were driven off. and no one could get near enough
to work with axes. No water was at hand to sul>lue
the lis rues, and he met death by Inches In tue
flames, but bravely and comparative calmness.
Hours afterwards the bones and ashes of the engineer
were removed, at which time nearly all the
express, baggage and mail matter had been consumed
in the flames. The superintendent and bis
assistants, who were summoned from Sayre, are
now clearing away the wreck as fast as possible.
The Weavers* Strike in Canada.
Montreal, Dec. The weavers, who lately

THE TALK AT THE CAFITOU
The tone of comment among members of Con*
gress Is generally favorable to the President*
message. The democrats are inclined to sneer at
the civil service portion of the message, but
upon the whole they seem willing to admit that
the message is a very creditable paper. Representative
Carlisle says the President's recommendations
for tax reduction are too sweeping for
the democrats to accept; that the pension list It
going to require a much larger expen inure than
Is anticipated, and if reductions of taxation are
not carefully made there may be a d -flctt hereafter
where there is now a surplus. Representative
K<dley, of Pennsylv inla, is willing to accept
the Presldeut's recommendations, and says he
Intends to introduce a till at once to abolish all
internal revenue taxes, except inose on d stilled
spirits. Mr. Kelley thinks the ways and meant
committee will readily agree to such a bill. Mr.
Kasson, It Is said, will oppose the abolition of the
tax on malt liquors an l a reduction of the tobacco
tax. There are not a few republican Congressmen
who express themselves as opposed to the abolishment
of the tax on malt liquors and tobac4-o. Representative
Hewitt,of New York,thinks the President's
civil service declarations are only a deathbed
repentance. Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, is not
willing to abolish the malt liquor tax. Representative
Thompson, of Kentucky, agrees with
him, and thinks the President's plan would be too
sweeping.
