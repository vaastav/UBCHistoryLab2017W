SATURDAY DECEMBER 16, 1893,
The death of Bishop D. A. Payne
Senior Bishop of the A. M. E.
Church, is a great affliction to that
connection and another loas of a
treat man to orlr race. Bishop
Pajne gave his life for the eleva
tion of his race and now at the com
mand of God lays down the work
at a good ripe old aga. The deaths
of so many sagacious leaders of the
people at this time is unfortunate
and lays greater responsibilities
upon those who are left behind.
Land Acres Decreasing.
It strikes us as rather peculiar
that the number of acres of land
listed for taxation this year should
Ioq nearly, one million less than last
year. We dont know how to account
for it, but it seems to us to show
gross carelessness or negligence on
the part of those charged with the
duty of taking the tax lists.

Republican Senators.
The 'News and Observer" of this
city says : "It i3 stated that the
Republican Senators have agreed
not to resort to obstructive tactics
against Democratic measurers." Of
course it can be easily seen that the
wish is father to the thought in
this instance, but we dont think
our contemporary can really hope
that Republican Senators will sit
idly by and see humane, just and
benificent tariff, financial and elec
tion laws uprooted and repealed
without even mildly protesting
against such injurious action. How
ever as the session advances and
the days become longer and the de
bates fiercer our Democratic friends
will probably see the wisdom of
changing their views as to the tac
tics of Republican Senators. The
repeaters looking to the Republi
can minority to save them from the
threatening Democratic legislation
that now menaces the prosperity
. .. . t 1
of our great and growing country
and they know that the Republi
cans will save them now as they
have so nobly done in the past.
The A. and M. College.
. The Agricultural and Mechanical
College for the . Colored Race is
"now opeirind prepared to receive
students as js stated by the adver
tisement elsewhere in this paper.
The cut of the building shows it to
ba a very handsome on, and we
are informed that it is well adapted
for the purpose for ' which it was
built. We hope ".that the young
men will avail themselves of this
opportunity to get an industrial
education. For years we held un
contestedly the mechanical trades,
but the white boys are now turn
ing their attention to these pur
suits, and if we would win in the
race, we must be equal to the
emergency. The expenses for pri
vate students are very cheap, while
for Statestudents, are furnished
free. We hope to see this mshtu-
na
State, ancTas one of the means of
doiDg so, we" hope the next legisla
ture will increase the appropriation
for building and maintenance. . .
Congress.
Congress assembled' in regular
session last week, but did not have
to go through the work of organ
ization, for tliat much had been
done by the special session. The
silver repeal bill having become a
law the tariff, election and curren
cy questions will be the ones that
must be settled by the regular
session. As to the tariff question
there is so much dodging and
hedging on it by the Democrats,
and so much opposition to the bill
as framed by the Wilson Commit
tee, by members of his own party,
that we think it is safe to predict
that the bill may pass the House
but will never get through the Sen
ate, therefore, the McKinley law
will not be repealed, or in other
words, the promises of ihe tariff
reformers will hot be kept. ' The
bill repealing the federal election
laws ha3 already passed the House,
and now comes up in the Senate,
but we do not believe that the Re
publican Senators have yet reached
the point where they will surrender
everything and tamely submit to
the passage of this repeal bilL We
are free to confess that the laws"
have been a dead letter upon the
statute books for some years, but
this is no reason why they should
be allowed to be repealed, simply
to please those why are trying to
thwart and destroy every means by
which honest elections are to be
held in this country. It is an open
question as to whether their repeal
would not serve best after all to
arouse the Republicans of the coun
try, to the dangers that threaten the
prosperity of its institutions. We
believe that the result of the last
election was an emphatic response
to the vote of the House repealing
these laws and that it was intended
to show in unmistakable terms the
disapproval of such action. On
the currency question the Demo
crats have struck down silver and
it now lies with them to remedy
f the matteryegislatiojiythis
Congress. The President has not
yet outlined his policy nor stated
how he will meet the increasing de
ficiency in the Treasury. The res
ponsibility is upon the Democrats
and the issue must be met squarely
andXintelligently, or they must ac
knowledge their incapacity to meet
them. We take it that the republican
minority in both the Senate and the
house, will be alive to the issues
and will force the righting all along
the line. For years the Democrats
have said what they would do if
they had tne power, now they have
it, let's see what they will do for
the people. Watch them.
The Presidents' Message.
The message sent to Congress
last week by President Cleveland,
was a very tame affair, in fact it did
not come up to his former stats
paper, nor did it meet , the ex
pectancy of his friends. It reviews
briefly American relations with va
rious foreign countries. It sum
marizes salint portions of the Re
port of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, stating that more than $108,
000,000 of gold was exported during
the year, the largest amount on rec
ord and estimating a Treasury defi
ciency for the current year of $28,
000,000. It disapproves the further
extension of free postal deliveries.
It reports 33,690 pensioners
dropped from the rolls.
It professes a new devotion to
Civil Service Reform and economy
in public expenditure. It finally
declares that the work of tariff re
form must go on, and strongly com
mends the Wilson bill and urges
its adoption by the Congress.
There is nothing in the message
to give encouragement or hope to
the men who have their means in
vested in the various enterprises of
this country, nor to the toiling
masses who are dependent upon
these investments for the necessary
means with which to sustain their
families. The people have asked
for bread but have been given a
stone.
On the great and all absorlpi
fluostion of finance, the Presi
tion made, one of usefulness to the
advises Congress to do nothin-fnd
present, notwithstanding the dis
tressed financial condition of the
varied interests of our country at
present. He frankly admits that
ha does not know what to tell them
to do in regard to the matter. If
he will consult Senator Sherman
againi he will as quickly lead him
out of the wilderness as rra did dur
ing the extra session of ) Congress.
The President il trying1 to concen
trate his forces pn the Wilson tariff
bill and begs them very earnestly
to pass it- He realizes that he has
a hard crowd to manage, and does
not give them but one job at a
time, for fear that they -may not
accomplish "anything." - . He . sajs,
"his great desire for the" success of
this measure, and his intense feel
ing of responsibility impels him to
invoke'' their aid in this work,. He
seems to tmuK mat tne wnoie
weight is upori; him instead of upon
his party, in other .'words, he re
cognizes the fact that he is bigger
than his party. The message is as
dumb as an oyster on the question
of the "Infamous Federal election
laws'' and of course we can but con-
elude that the President forgot to
mention it for we guess he is as
anxious now as in the past, to have
them repealed. The Southern mem
bers of : his, cabinet ought to have
reminded him of that "paramount
question" .for , if ear that the next
Congressional election will come
before these laws are repealed.
The "Charlotte Observer," "Wil
mington " Messenger" and , "News
and Observer." which are the rec
ognized leading Democratic Organs
of the State, talk as follows about
the message :
The "Charlotte Observer says :;
"It is, upon thejwhole, a disappoint
ment. It is not as strong in its
structure as Mr. Cleveland s pa
pers usually are, but the chief dis
appointment is found m what it
A, A
does not say. His announcement
that it is too early to say what
financial-legislation is needed, fol
lowing the repeal of the silver pur
chase act, is not responsive to pub
lic expectation, nor is it consistent
with his declaration in connection
with, the tariff, that "if political
promises and professions have any
binding force, our failure to give
the relief, so long awaited will be
sheer recreancy." The Chicago
platform promised other things
than the repeal f the Sherman act
and the revision of the tariff.
It is strange that the President
-overlooks the fact!!
The
"Messenger" says: "On
the whole the message is rather dis
appointing in that it lacks in some
particulars that honest, straight
forward drive at main facts that
heretofore characterized Mr. Cleve
land's public writings and smacks
more of the politician than of the
true statesman that was heretofore
the prominent features of our Presi
dent's utterances
The "News and Observer'' says r
."There is a great deal of unrest
among the people of this State, and
the Presidents message is not cal
culated to allay it. It will fall as a
wet blanket on those who had
hopes that he would offer some
recommendation on which the
Democratic people of the State
could all unite, ignoring past differ
ences." ; To the Gazbtte.

giving.- tho proper and necessary

people of this country as objects
worthy of your sympathy and bene

These appeals are the finger of
God pointing to a field where you
may cultivate and enlarge the spirit

This is a good opportunity to test
the faithfulness of God in adher
ing to his promises to those that
manifest their compassion for the
afflicted by charitable deeds.
In every town and city in the
State, are those who would gladly
contribute of their means to assist
in relieving these sufferers. If they
had the cause properly presented
to them. Food, clothing as well as
money are thankfully received by
these sufferers. Our liitle town
with a population of less than four
hundred, in response to an appeal
in behalf of that people, by the

BISMOP IiYMAN DEAD.
Aloug with a nnmb.r of great and
eminent men, The lit. Rev. Theodore
B. Lyman passes away and takes up his
abode in a more congenial and peaceful
clime in the realms above, resting from
his earthly labors sweetly in the pres
ence of God, in whose service he has
worked so faithfully on earth. Thus a
great and good man has quitted
earth and all its troubles' and gone to
swell the numbers of the angelio hosts
in Heaven. The eloquent -voice that has
electrified thousands . from hundreds of
pnlpits both in : this country and Eu
rope to every nation and tongue is
hushed ; and it is this fact that carries
sadness to many hearts. Bishop Lyman
was charitable and philanthrophio and
his whole life while in the ' ministry was
devoted to relieving suffering humanity.
The colored people who he was just be
gining to better know, and brought into
closer relations with this venerable man
of God are especially grieved at hu
death, for he had manifested great in
terest and concern as to their welfare and
redemption in educational and christian
work. We sincerely hops and trust
that the plaoe made voi J by his death
may be filled by one like him in chris
tian spirit and kindly feeliogs towards
the colored people of his faith. We ex
tend to the bereaved family our full sim-
pathy and condolence. The Bishop's
death took place at 8 o'clock on .Wed
