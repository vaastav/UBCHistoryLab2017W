A fiUautge 8trr
Oo tb 18th of April, 1868, in tha
rioo of Villarica, (.Province of Mi
ne tieraen, in Brazil, two men nnin
d Arerio and Car i lies woro executed
at the bam litno. in Brazil, exe
cution take place with cloned door,
tu the interior of tho prion. Dr.
Lorenao y Curino, of Jiio Janeiro,
vuli knowu by cervant for his re
markable works on electricity ap
plied to physiology, hie eurgical
tkill, and his ucce in autoplastic
operaliona, obtained pormission to
profil by this ovent, in order to ex
periment on the power of electrici
ty, and to illuDlruto its analogy with
aume of the phenomena of lifo. The
uaraerou exporiments hitherto ut
tanipted have been undo ou tho
bead and trunk aepurately. Dr. Lo
re u coy Carnio's dexign was, il'possi
bU, to uoile lb head after decupi
tation. The head of tho two criminal
(II. within a few minutes of ench
ether, into the namo baskot first
that of Carincs, then that of Avciro.
Immediately after this second exo
cation a compression was effected
by a pupil of Dr. Lorenzo on tho
carotid artery of one of the beadH,
eo as to stop the hemorrhage. The
body was thon placed on & bod al
ready prepared, and Dr. Loronao
atnek the bead as exactly as possi
ble en the section, and kept it in
tbat position. The cells of a powor
ral electric pilo wore applied to the
base of the neck and en the breast.
Under this influence, as in former
experiments, the respiratory movo
nents were at once perceptible. As
tb blood which penetrated in abun
dance through the surface of the
tear threatened to stop the passage
f tbe air, Dr. Lorenzo had recourse
to tracheotomy. J(epirntion men
.naned reinilarlv. I ho head was
batened to the body by stitchos and
by a special apparatus. The physi
uliwin wished to ascertain for how
long a time this appearance of life
avuld thus be artificially maintained.
His astonishment was groat wbon
ksaw at the end of two hours not
slid respiration still continue under,
tfae influence of tho electric current,
but that circulation hnd even re
canted cetain regularity. The
palie beat feebly but Bonsibly. The
tperiment was continued without
iotermission. At the end of 72 hours
it was evident, to tho astonishinont
f every rno that a process of cica
trization had commenced on the
lips of the section. A little later
aigna of life manifested themselves
spontaneously in the bead and
limbs, till then deprived of motion.
At this moment the director of the
prison, arriving for the first time in
the experiment room, observed that
by a singular mistake duo to tho
baste of the operation, the head of
Cannes bad been taken for that of
Aveiro, and bad been applied to tho
kody of the luttor. The experiment
was continued notwithstanding.
Thro days luter the respiratory
movements reproduced themselves,
end electricity waa suppressed. Dr.
Lorenzo y Carmo ana bis assistaut
wer stupefied, frightened at a r
aU so unexpected, and at the power
of In agent which, in their band,
bad restored life to a body whoso
right to exist tbelaw had lorfeited.
?Th learned surgeon, who bad
only had in view a aimplo physiol
ogical experiment, employed all his
skill to continue this work, which
science, aided, against all expecta
tion by nature, bad eo singularly
commenced. He assisted tb pro
re of cicatrization, which progress
ed ander th mst favorable condi
lione. By means of an orspphagian
probe, liquid nourishment waa In
troduced into tb Btomach. At th
end of about l roe month th cica-
inn was complete, and motion.

wonder of all Europe. Scarcely an ax

is fled the spirit of tbe fathers snd found
ers of tbe Republic? Is tbe jsalous spirit
rendered negative by tbe influx of tbe
plebeian rabbis of foreign lands, whose
naial instincts lead them to tolerate aris
tocracy aad delight in the glittering show
of sccptrs and crown? Be il as il may, a
strange inertia seems to possoss lbs mass
es. There seams to be no end to their
tame submission to tbe most outragoous
cots of the bald villsius who are enriching
themselves by taxing tbe property of'lbe
poor everywhere, aud heaping tbe most
onerous hardens upon both rich and poor
in the manacled South.
Who that feels the throb of freedom in
hie heart sitys not that the people of the

I left New Orleans last week, and bade

maaly proprietor, Mr. Mono, who has
mads bis house tha home of Texians for so
many years. It ie par excellence a Texas

suck a genuine, courtly welcome aa makes
