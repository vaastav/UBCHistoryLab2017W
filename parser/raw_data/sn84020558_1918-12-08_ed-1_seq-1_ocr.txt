NEW YORK. Dec. 7. The United
Slates government will have as its
guests, in the near future, President
Poincalro of France, Kin? George of
England, Kins Albert of Belgium, King
Victor Emanuel of Italy and the heads
of any other nations President Wil
son may visit during his visit to Eu
rope, ptepliane Lauzanne, editor of the
Paris Matin, declared today, Just he
fore he sailed for France. M. Lauzanne
has been in the United States several
months on an official mission.
"It has been a diplomatic custom
from time immemorial," M. Lauzanne
said, "that the head of one govern
rnt who entertains the head of an
other, invariably repays the visit."
While no official announcement of
plans has been made, II. Lauzanne de
clared it was certain President Poin
raire would come to the United States
within the next year, as his term of
office expires in 1920. No official an
nouncement of plans will be made, he
added, until President Wilson has ar
rived in France and visited the capi
tals of the various nations.
United States statesmen probablj
will have to brush up on precedents
and formalities for state occasions,
Mr. Lauzanne added, as the United
States never has received the heads
of a foreign government with the ex
ception of King Ktlakaua of the Sand
wich Islands.

umnmiY to sell
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. The charge
that A. Mitchell Palmer, exceeded his
authority as alien property custodian,
in siezing the Botany Worsted mijls of
Passaic, New Jersey, and Stoehr and
Sons, Inc., of New York, -was made by
Louis Marshall, counsel for the com
panies' stockholders, in federal court
here today. His argument was on a
writ of prohibition to restrain Mr.
Palmer from selling 24,900 of the 36,000
shares o the Botany company's cap
ital stock.
The writ wa obtained by Max W.
Stoehr, a stockholder in both compan
ies, in behalf of all the stockholders.
Judge John C. Knox reserved decision.
Mr. Marshall contended' that under
the amendment of last March, to the
trading with the enemy act, the power
of the alien property custodian had
been abridged, to permit selling of only
perishable propel,-, and thus prevent
useless waste. Under this amendment.
he declared, the custodian is directed to
com an other property, until directed
as to its disposition by act of concrresi.
Mr. Palmer had advertised for sale
the assets of the company, placed by
air. juarsnau at sj.uuu.uuu, and the
stock. The sale was deferred because of
the issuance of the writ.

BISBEE, Dec. 7. That Arizona's
output of copper for 1918 i)vill ex
ceed that of 1917, the previous high
record, by one hundred and nine
teen million pounds is the state
ment made by Joseph E. Curry,
secretary of the Arizona chapter
of the American Milling congress,
in his annual report. Mr. Curry's
figures, based upon carefully gath
ered and segregated figures, show
this year's output to be 819,000,000
pounds as against 700,000,000
for last year. This record has
been made in spite of labor short
age and shortage in materials.
"Not included in the production
figures might be estimated con
servatively 500,000 pounds of cop
per produced by Arizona miles,
from shipments of ore to smelters
outside the state," says the report.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.
William Denman, former chairman
of the United States shipping
board, today declined appointment
by Secretary of Labor Wilson as
special representative of that de
partment in a county grand jury
investigation of alleged irregulari
ties, charged in a report published
here over the signature of John B.
Densmore, dealing with the case of
Thomas J. Mooney.
Densmore's report charged irregu
larities in connection with the trials
of Mooney, his wife, Rena Mooney, and
others indicted for murder as a result
of a bomb explosion here July 22, 191o,
in which ten persons were killed. It
was presented to Secretary Wilson, as
whose behest Densmore said he made
the Investigation.
Mr. Denman, In a formal statement
to the Associated Press, said he de
clined the appointment because he
lacked "experience in criminal law
and procedure," and because of the
want of the criminal investigators o,
prosecutor's temperament." The state
ment follows:
'I have no personal familiarity with
anv of the facts involved in Mr. Dens-
mores report or of the conditions of
the district attorneys office, or the
Mooney case. The first intimation
that my name was tinder consideratw
came yesterday through the press.
After careful consideration of the
position I am asked to accept, I feel
that my lack of experience in crim
inal law and procedure and want or
the criminal investigators or prose
cutor's temperament, make it Improper
that I should take it. My high per
sonal regard for Secretary Wilson
adds to my disappointment in declin
ing to assume a responsibility in a
matter of such serious importance to
the state, as is set forth in Mr. Dens
more's reports."

LONDON, Dec. 7. (British wireless
service) Herbert H. Asquith, the for
mer prime minister, speaking at Roch
dale, Lancashire, today, ranged himself
alongside those who have declared that
the men responsible for the war and
the atrocities shall receive adequate
punishment.
"We ought to Insist that Justice be
done," declared Mr. Asqnith, "and that
not only the forms, but the spirit of
Justice the meting out to the wrong
doer of his due, not less and not more
should be scrupulously observed."
Referring to the significance of the
visit of President Wilson to Europe,
Mr. Asquith said, that for permanent.
purposes the world was a new one.
These purposes, he contended, would
not only not have been achieved, but
there would have been no advance to
ward their achievement, unless, before
the president returned, a league of na
tions had begun to be translated from
formula into fact
In his judgment the best geenrity
against the dangers which beset the
coming conference was the main
tenance, in its fullest and freest sense,
of real understanding between the al
lies and the United States.
"There are all kinds of hints and
suggestions to upset and confuse us,"
Asquith continued. "We are warned
of the- growth, rapid and unprece
dented, of the United States, of the
vast development of their mercantile
marine, and of possible American eco
nomic penetration of Siberia and east
Russia. It should be clearly under
stood that a league of nations does not
mean the cessation of industrial and
mercantile rivalry."

LEEDS, Eng., Dec. 7. "I shall never
forget that morning when I sent a
cable message to President Wilson,
telling him what the facts were, and
how .essential it was, that we should
get American help at the speediest
possible rate, and inviting him to send
120 000 infantry and machine gunners
to Europe," said Premier Lloyd George
in the course of a speech to 3,000 per
sons today. .. . ..
"The following day," continued the
premier, "there came a cablegram from
President Wilson:
"Send your ships across ana we
will send the 120,000 men."
"Then I invited Sir josepn aiatuay,
the shipping controller, to Downing
street and said: 'Send every ship you

"They were all engaged in essential
trades, because we were cut down
right to the bone. There was nothing
that was not essential. We said: 'This
is the time for taking risks.'
"We ran risks with our food, and
we ran risks with essential raw ma
terials. We said: 'The thing to do
is to get these men across at all

"America sent 1,900,000 men across,

WASHINGTON, Dec 7. Postmaster
General Burleson wrote Captain Benja
min Lipsner today, in accepting his
resignation as superintendent of the
Aerial Mail service, that charges made
public by him in leaving the office
were, "from beginning to end, a tissue
of misstatements upon matters of
which you should have been fully con
versant." Captain Lipsner was quoted last
night as saying he resigned because he
had been informed that novices were
to be placed in charge of important
branches of the service, ana war. spe
cial aeroplanes are to be built for car
rying mail.
"The statement that the postoffice
department has considered or author
ized extensive alterations on military
airplanes, which the war department is
turning over to it, has no foundation.
except in your imagination," Mr. Burle
son said in his letter to Captain Lips
ner. "Except for the application of
skiis to the running gear of planes, to
facilitate landing in snow, as recom
mended by you, and for experimental
modification of three de Haviland
planes, to decrease landing speed, and
minor modifications to facilitate load-1
ing of mail, nothififf has been author
ized.
Rebuke Is Scathing
So far from ordering new construc
tion, the letter adds, Assistant Post
master General Prager refused to au
thorize the construction of a fleet of
twin-motored mail planes, recom
mended by Captain Lipsner. His asser
tion that novices are to be employed in
the service, Mr. Burleson said, "is on a
par with the other statements, since
the two new officials appointed are av
iators, which you are not."
In connection with Captain Lipsners
retirement, Mr. Burleson announced
the creation of two departments for the
air mail service, one headed by Lieu
tenant J. Clark Edgerton, as chief of
flying operations, and the other by Dr.
L. T. Bussler, as chief of maintenance
and equipment Both have been in the

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. (By wireless
to the Associated Press) At the pres
ent rate of speed President Wilson will
not land at Brest before Friday. He
probably will reach Paris Sunday. His
conferences with the French statesmen
are expected to begin promptly Tues
day, after an exchange of official visits.
It was expected that the Azores would
be passed tomorrow, but the George
Washington and her convoy of war
ships are plowing through one squall
after another, which are heavy for the
southern course. As a consequence,
the Azores will not be reached before
Tuesday.
Pennsylvania Mile Ahead
The Pennsylvania is steaming more
than a mile ahead of the president's
ship. The destroyers which make up
the remainder of the convoy often are
hidden from sight in the valleys be
tween the great rollers which are
washing them so frequently that the
crews scarcely can cling to the decks.
The George Washington, however, is
keeping a comparatively steady course
in the heavy sea, and none of the offi
cial party has been seasISk thus far.
The president took a constitutional on
deck after his morning's work, after
which he again took part in a boat
drill and then retired to his suite for

PAPJS, Dec. 7. The town house of
Prince and Princess Joachim Murat,

Mrs. Wilson, during their stay in
Paris, at the request of the govern
ment, will soon be completely reno

The Rue de Monceau, in which the
house is located, while one of the
most fashionable neighborhoods of
Paris, contains all sorts of houses.
Adjoining the Murat house on the
right, is tho Ste Marie institution, a
large school for children, consisting
of many buildings and a playground.
Across the street lives a woman artist
and a doctor, and there are a group
of officers and a butcher store. On

French cafe, with a few iron tables
and chairs on the; sidewalk in front.

Although the Murat mansion is rap
idly becoming known as "La Maison

a dull brown tint. The house itself
is hidden from the street by a stone
wall, 10 feet high, in which there are
two narrow wooden gates and, in the
centre, a big double door for vehicles.
Grounds Are Spacious.
Inside the gates is a large gravelled
space. Here the guard of honor will
be stationed. A low ornamental iron
fence on the side, away from the
school, separates the court from the
spacious grounds and gardens stretch
ing away for half a block, and en
closed by a stone wall giving complete
privacy.
Broad gravelled walks wind through
green lawns, under trees of great size.
A stroll around the gardens gives a

EIGHTlils OF
Rule Of Discharge Within
Four months After Peace
May Have To Be Modi
fied By
Congress
WASHINGTON, Dec 7. Eight of
the thirteen divisions, comprising the
American third army now approaching
tho Rhine, either are national guard or
national army troops, and there is
every reason to believe that they will
be on American soil again by midsum
mer. General March, chief of staff, an
nounced today that he anticipated no
difficulty in getting these units home
within four months after peace has
been established formally by procla
mation. President Wilson, in his re
cent message to congress, said the ses
sions of the conference probably would
be concluded by spring, and based on
this estimate of time, General March's
statement was accepted to mean that
these forces would return during the
summer.
Two national guard divisions, the
32nd and 42nd, and two of the national
army, the 89th and 90th. now are in
the front line of Major General Dick
man's army of occupation, which was
within 20 miles of the Rhine last
night, according to General Pershing's
report. Tne 2th and 43rd national
guard and the 79th national army are
in the second line, constituting the re
serve which is occupying Luxemburg
and various rail centers in France, in
cluding Montmedy, Longuyon, Etain,
and St. MihieL The 1st, 3rd, 4th and
5th regulars comprise the remainder of
the advancing army, while the 2nd and
7th divisions are with the reserve.
' May Modify Draft Law
The estimate as to the possibility
that all except regular 'divisions will
have been withdrawn from France by
midsummer is based on General
March's reply to a question as to steps
necessary to obtain an extension of the
enlistment period for men in the army
of occupation.
The law about the men who were
raised in the national army is that they
must be discharged four months after
the declaration of peace," he said.
"That, I think, also was extended to
include men who made voluntary en
listments in the regular army. I will
not have any difficulty in bringing
back from France the so-called na
tional army divisions in four months
after the declaration of peace. It is
entirely possible that we will have to
ask congress for some modification of
the law" to provide a longer period for
the units which will remain in Europe.'
A total of 533 officers and 125,515
men. General March said, have been
specifically assigned for early return
by General Pershing. Included in the
additional units reported today are 1,
426 officers and 29,381 men, the largest
organizations mentioned being the
field artillery brigades of the 8th (reg
ular) and 92nd (national army negro)
divisions, and the 345th and 346th in
fantry regiments from the 87th (na
tional army) division. The remainder
of the list consists largely of motor re
pair units and auxiliary divisional
troops.
Largest Unit Ordered Home
The 34Gth infantry is numerically the
largest unit yet ordered home, show
ing 77 officers and 3,182 men, while
the 345th, with 14 officers and 734 men,
has apparently been stripped by re
placement drafts. The full strength of
an ijsfantry regiment is approximately
3,609 men.
Discussing demobilization of the
ferces at home. General March said
aSege men, other than those in offi
cers' schools, which were being aban
doned, would receive no preference as
to the time of their discharge. The
order of demobilization providing that
the combat divisions be disbanded last,
he said, has not been altered.
The system Is working at a very
much greater speed, General March
said, referring to demobilization, "and
I have initiated a system by which I
get a daily record as to officers and
a weekly record as to enlisted men.
The actual number of officers dis
charged at the time of the last an
nouncement was 113; the number dis
charged last -week, up to yesterday,
was 7,658. The number of men dis-
charged in the United. tatea-last neekj
over 200,000.

WILSON
OVER WIRELESS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Charles
M. Schwab, director-general of the
Emergency Fleet corporation, who laid
aside his own shipbuilding plans, eight
months ago, to help build ships for
the government, received word by
wireless from President Wilson to
night that his resignation had been
accepted.
It had been understood here for
some time that Mr. Schwab was anx
ious to be relieved of the office, so
that he could again take up extensive
interests he relinquished when asked
to become the directing force of the
pnnnlrv'o war-timo Khinhnilriine' Tirn-
gram, although it was not known that
his resignation was placed in the
hands of the president before the lat
ter departure Wednesday for Eu
rope. Mr .Schwab was not in Washington
tonight, but it was stated that he
would retire and that Charles Piez,
vice president and general manager
of the Emergency Fleet corporation,
would carry on the work exactly as
heretofore.
President Wilson, in accepting the
director-general's resignation, in a
message sent to the White house
from the transport George Washing
ton, with instructions that it be con
veyed to Mr. Schwab, said:
"I accept your resignation only be
cause you wish it, and because I feel
I must do so, in fairness to you. Ton
have been exceedingly generous in
giving your services and they havfi
been invaluable. Want to thank you
very cordially, indeed, for all that you
have done. Shall always remember,
as I am sure your associates in the
government will, a service of unusual
value and distinction.'
Bainbridge Colby, vice president of
the United States shipping board,
who has been closely associated with
the director-general, said tonight that
Mr. Schwab had rendered service of
the greatest value and had contributed
precisely what was expected of him.

NEW-YORK, Dec 7 Unemployment
is the greatest daneer confronting the
united States during the next four
months, the labor reconstruction con
ference of the academy of political sci
ence was told at its meeting here today
Dy jsathan A. Smyth, assistant direc
tor general of the United States em
ployment service. Thousands of sol
diers are being discharged daily, he
said, at the beginning of. winter, wnen
outdoor jobs are few; war time plants
are being closed because of army can
cellations of contracts and manufac
turers are hesitant in employing more
labor because of uncertainties of tax
ation, high prices of materials and
"timidity" of credit.
. Eventually, Mr. Smyth said, the prob
lem of placing America's soldiers and
war workers will be solved through an
abnormally high emigration of Euro
peans to their native lands, the proba
bility that immigration will continue to
be slight, and especially by co-operation
of American agencies in connect
ing jobless men with manless jobs. He
warned the members of the conference,
however, that these agencies could only
enable men to find open jobs, and could
ndt create work.
Turning Up "Broke"
"Soldiers are being discharged by the
thousands daily, on the basis of mili
tary units, with no reference to wheth
er or Tt they are now needed in indus
try." said Mr. Smyth. "They are being
mustered out on a few days' notice and
given in money the cost of transporta
tion to their homes, free to buv tickets
wherever they please. Alreadv thev
are turning up in the cities improvi
dent, 'broke, away from home, without
work, applicants for civilian relief.
Many others are unwilling to undertake
the "day labor jobs which alone they
can find. There is every prospect that
unless remedial measures are promptly
taken, the sight of stranded, workless.
moneyless soldiers will be common
throughout the land.
"The great danger in the coming four
months is that there will not be jobs
enougn to go around; that unemploy
ment will come with attendant misery
and social unrest at a time when an
archistic tendencies are contagious.
Up to Manufacturer
"The remedy of building public
works is not available on a large scale
until spring. The farms will not call
urgently for men until frost thaws out.
Chiefly must we look to our manufac
turera to carrv the burden. But they
are hesitant. Taxes are not yet detej"
mined. The cost of money is high and
credit timid for a while. The primes of
raw material ana labor are high. The
producer hopes they will fall, and man
ifests a tendency to wait till they do.
To meet each of these deterrent fea
tures is an immediate national task."
Mr. Smyth urged that the manufac
tnrer "iret. his wheels movincr with th
utmost speed, even if there be a remote
Chance -at lower- coats."

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7 Further
chapters in the story of the efforts ot
Count von Bernstorff, the former Ger
man ambassador, aril other German
agents, to influence sentiment in Amer
ica toward Germany, and to prevent
the shipment of war supplies to the al
lies, were revealed in documents laid
before the senate investigating com
mittee today by A. Bruce Bielaski' ct
the department of justice.
Wreck of the propaganda system
built up by Bernard Darnbuc, the
kaiser's personal agent in the United
States, by the sinking of the Lusitania,
and the rebuilding, of- it hv von Bern
storff, in a manner which "cannot hurt
us if it becomes known, also were
dealt with in communications from the
former ambassador, to the Berlin fo;
eign office.
There also was evidence relating ta
the organization, in. 1915 and subse
quent activities, of the American Em.
bargo association, with the hope of
stopping shipments of war supplies to
the allies so arousing feeling among;
the voters, as to compel legislative ac
tions. One of the communications of
fered by Mr. Bielaski, and purporting
to have been written by P. Rciswit,z,
German consul at Chicago, dealt with a.
mass meeting of the association soon
to be held, and said that among those
who had "agreed to co-operate" were
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, chair
man of the senate foreign relations
committee; former Representative Bu
chanan of Illinois, who was connected
with labor's national peace . council;
William Bayard Hale, and Dr. Akel,
minister of San Francisco.
Hitchcock Supported Principles "j
Another communication, relating io
and said to have been written by G. to.
Jacobs of Chicago, acting chairmen.
a meeting of the embargo association
said that former Senator Works ot
California and Senator Smith of Geor
gia, as well as Senator Hitchcock, sup
ported the principles of the conference.
Mr. Bielaski read a document signed
by Senator Hitchcock, stating that the-'
senator would do all in his power, both
as a senator and as editor of the Oma
ha World-Herald, to bring about an.
embargo on arms. Reiswitz's letter
regarding the embargo association
made this reference to Senator Hitch
cock:
"Hitchcock seemed to be very strong
for the plan. He told our representa
tive at a conference in Omaha: If this
matter is organized in the right way,
you will sweep the United States.
Consul Reiswitz, in a letter believe4
by the department of justice to have
been written to Dr. Heinnerich F. Al1
bert, a former German agent, outlined
a plan for the acquisition of the Wright
air-plane factory at Dayton, Gaio. as a
means of preventing the export of fly
ing mchines from the United States.
Mr. Bielaski also testified that ta
make provisions for the dissemination
of pro-German news to smaller news
papers, the German agents contem
plated the purchase of the American
Press association, which furnished
matter in type to papers, but he said,
there was no evidence that the deal
was carried through. In this connec
tion, the witness read an option, drawn
up presumably by the agent of Albert,
whereby the association was to "place
its whole organization at the disposal of
Albert, in order to spread pro-German
news and suppress anti-German news.
900,000 For A. P. Assn
The option was to be valid between
July 15 and October 15, 1915, and dur
ing that time, Albert was to decide
whether he would purchase control of
the property for $900,000.
Late today the state department
made public the full text of the Bern
storff documents, read into the comr
mittee records by Mr. Bielaski. They
were taken from the mass of evidence
in the department's files, disclosing
German intrigue before and after the
United States entered the war. i
The dicument relating to the shlS-
wreck of the Dernburg iropaganda was
dated November 1, 1915, and said:
"As you will have learned from my
previous report, we have since tne
Lusitania case endeavored to wind tip
all the so-called German propaganda,
and especially to get rid of all dubious
individuals. I can now say with
good conscience that we are no longer
compromised. Some of the old affairs
still hang on, but we are more or les
settled, although they will cause some
future expenditures.
At the beginning of the war many
things were undertaken by the Dern
burg propaganda which never would
have been undertaken if we could bare
seen that the war would be so long,
because nothing can for long be kept
secret in America. . i
"Since the Lusitania case we hav
propaganda as cannot hurt us If it be
comes known. The sole exception is, ,
perhaps, the peace propaganda, whidx -has
cost us the largest amount, but .
which, also, has been the most aud
cessf uL
"Latterly I have been using the em
bargo association and some entirely
reliable private intermediaries.
"I have also made use of the Ger,-,
man university league, founded since
the war. This has done its best to take
the place of" the German association
(word not decipherable) which has
been of no use during the war, on ac?"
count of its management. The league
has published under my collaboration
an excellent collection of reports on :
the war which will be of great service
to our cause. 5 i
"The support which I nave already
given the league is entered In the in-;
stallments to them, I will refer to this'
report
"I ask that this may be sanctioned. '
