Purhase Made by the VcritvOnt

wns nfTlrihillv ntjit.pil vpntfA-ilnv
enfral Mnnager W. W. Voodof tlie
Urandon Italiau Marble conipauy that
the property of the company had beeh
nold to the Vermont Marble company of
Proctor, but the amount paid was not
given out.
It had been rumored about town for
nenrly two weeks that negotiations were
on foot tending to a transfer of tho
property but up to yesterday tho oillcials
were veri reticent concerning the mat
ter. What eiTect the sale will have on the
buaineBS life of Middlebury is not known
as nothing has been given out which
woiild 8how whcther the businoss will
be continued liere or a portion of the
work done in Proctor. It Seems to be
the general inipression that only a por
tiou of tho worka will be operated, but
on the other hand it has been strongly
intimated that the mill would not only
ccntinue in operntion but the working
force be inaterinlly increased at no dis
tant date. If the latter is the fact Mid
dlebury people will rejoice as the re
nioval of the works lneans much to the
coiiimuiiity,
Tho plant here is modern and up-to-dato
and it would seem to the unlnitiated
that the purchabcrs could ill utTord to let
it remaiu idle
