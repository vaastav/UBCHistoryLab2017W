OFFICIAL CITY & COUNTY PAPER
Tbe New York Sun does not seem to
have, a verv exalted opinion of the qualifies
tiona of Grant for the position he occupies,
and the editor was in a poBiiion daring the
wr u nave a mil Knowledge of his coarse;
ter and the motives ht prompted him. In
notioing the President's message tha Sun
thns comments upon it ;
The first thonsrht that occurs after read
iiiif the inessae is that it is a poverty
stricken document. It tells as much that
we already knew, bat loaves us in the dark
ou subjeoti which we would like to be in
formed. The President has an original mode of
accounting for the decline of Republicanism
io the Southern Stats, as shown in the result
of the recent elections. He says the
elective franchise has by violence and inti
midation been denied to their citizens, and
tbe "veraict ot the people has thereby
reversed. e are not aware ot the exist
ence oi any faots that justify ao sweepicp an
assertion. VVethiuk these results are to be
aocoanted for on threefold grounds of the
intuncy of the Hepublican party in that seo
tion of the Union, of which it is composed,
and the unpopularity of Orant's Administra

Republican party-
liarnmn is ain to stait in the show
business He is to eclipse everything bere-
toiore started out in the circus and menage
rie business. This is probably his fiscal
climax in humbuggery. Jn this line,
barnum baa been the most fortunate of
Americans. Somebody has said ho made
one fortune by humbugging the people, and
then turned round and made another by
telling how he did it. While out west, a
short time ago, he discovered one of the
greatest curiosities yet know, viz : an editor
who had money to loan. The account says
he will form one ot the curiosities, and
hence Davenport will lose one of its citizens
Tii e Republicans of Boston have nomina
ted a staunch Democrat, fm, Gaston, for
Mayor. The Journal says :

choose men who represent our political
opinions upon the great questions of the
day ; at a municipal election we seleot men
who will not indulge to extravagance, but
wna, with honesty and efficiency, will look
after the security of life and property, and
see that the money taken from our pockets
is not sriaandered or misappropriated.
Ve imagine that " at national and State
elactions" ft would be well also to choose
men of honest and efficiency. -

representing f 85,000 were circulated ac
cording to the confession of Brockway, who

Washington. Dec. 14. The Grand .Inrv
of this district to day, found a true bill of
indictment against Representative Bowen.
of South Carolina, for bigamy. He was j
married here on the 29th of last August, '
and about a week after a Louisville oaDer !
published an abstract from the records " a
court there, showing an application for a
divorce there on the part ot a person claim
ing to be his wife. It appears that Bowen
was married to Miss Tibia Parks in January,
1860, in Awaukella oounty, Florida, and
lived with her some years. On
the 4tb of February last M.-. Bowen
then residing in Louisville, filed a petition
for a divorce which is still pending. In
August last be visited her in Louisville it is
said, and on the l!th of the month the rec
ords in Indiana show that a petition was
filed in the name of Tabitha Bowen against
Wm. Bowen and that an answer was filed
on the same day and in thirteen days after
wards Bowen was married to Mrs. Pettigore.
It would appear that this marriaee occurred
prior to the decree of divorce. In this In
diana case the petitioner charges the bus- j
nana witn cruel treatment and a failure to
provide her support. It is further asserted
that Mrs. Bowen alleges that Bowen em
ployed the counsel on both sides
in this Indian case, and that she aia
not sicn or swear to the petition, and
farther that the decree in this case was
passed.
On testimony taken prior to the filing of
the bill, on behaif of Mr. Bowen, it is
alleged that this whole charge of bigamy is
me wors ot political maiice, ana comes
from interested motives. It is asserted in
his behalf, that the records of the Indiana
Court will show that he was legally divorced
before the marriage with Mrs. Pettigone,
and tbatthe documents to prove the fact are
on the way to this city.

lution, notice of which be gave yesterday,
proposing an investigation with a view of
restoring tbe Arlington estate to the widow
of General R. Lee; removal of graveyards
on premises and restitution for incumbrances
placed by or for the government. A debate
ensued which took a wide range and was
somewhat acrimonious. Republican Sena
tors took grounds against any disturbance
of tbe bones of the loval dead at Arling
ton.
Mr Edmunds said that General Lee was
dead; the only regret right minded people
could have was, that he had not died earlier
io his youth, or earlier than he did by the
hand of the law.
Mj. Sumner said the resolution was a
representation of the sentiments of the dem
ocratic minority.
Mr. McCreery replied he clone originated
it and was responsible for it. The debate
was the abstract question of the right of the
Senate to prohibit a member from introduc
ing any legislation of whatever kina. Ibe
debate lasted three bours. A vote was then
taken on leave to introduce tbe resolution
and was denied, yeas 4, cays 64.
