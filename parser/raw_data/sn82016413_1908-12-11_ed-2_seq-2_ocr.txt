That portion of the inessageltal jh'tf $rth tho'gecrcl Service, in part,
was: "Laa year an ninendment Ttasinpo'rpOrntcd' in the measure provid
ing for the Secret Scrvide, which prnvftcd that there should be no detail
from the Secret Service nnd no transfer therefrom. It Is not too much to
say that ills amendment has been of benent nnlv "nuil rnniit i.o nt i.n,,ni
only, tfl tho criminal classes. If, dej IbTrajeJy, lntoduced for the purpose
of diminishing tho effectiveness of w;tr ngal,hs( crima,''it could not luivo
been better devised to this end.',- ( t t ," "in its present form the le
strlctlon operates only to thCvndvan tage of the crlm'lnal, of the wrong
doer. The chief argument. In favor of the nruvlslon wan Hint tim ('n,.r,.M
men. did riot themselves wish to be lu vestlgatcd by Secret Service men.
Very little of such Investigation Ims been dono In thc'pastj btttjt is title
that the Work Of the Secret Service agents was partly responsible for
the Indlctnient and conviction of a Senator nnd aCongressraan for land
frauds In Oregon. I do not believe tUaflt Is In the nubile Interest In
protect criminals lu any branch of the public service, am) exactly as v
havo again. and again during the'pust seven years proseruted and con
victed suoh criminals who were In thb executive branch of the (lovern
meut, so. In my beller, we should be given ample means . to prosecute
them If found in the legislative branch, lint If this Ik 'not considered
desirable a special exception could be made in the law urohlhltlnc the

It would be far better to do this tha

Ho Went on to sty that (hero was

speak of the plans for the future, rucIi

whlah the Institution was established

based on thoso practical subjects.
After dwelling on tho manner In
which funds wero derived for theso
colleges, especially that of Hawaii
Professor (lllnmrn stated that tliq
money rould not bo expended for the
purchnso of ldnd or tho erection brrie

up to tho Territory to proude for such.
Tho Territory had iilrtndy in ule sum

and a building foi the (liglnroilug. de

Tho College bad certain deals Plr't
that the College must bo of direct
service to the community. In some
counties people studied for scholar
ihlps, lu othois for ctllttiro nnd In oth
era fo,- eeivlce. The hitter wus tho
American Ideal. A second Ideal was
that all subjects whlcB men took up
