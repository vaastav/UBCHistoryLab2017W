TUESDAY, DEOEMBEB 7, 1880.
ASSAULTS UPON THE EXECUTIVE,
The nets of every 'publio official when
fairly ond truthfully stated are always
subject to just criticism by public jour
nals, but wlieu the manager of a news
paper wlioso whole outfit lias boon paid
for by rich corporation, composed of
men living outside of the territory, and
thus evading just taxation upon millions
of dollars worth of the beet paying prop
erty in Dakota, deliberately and willful
ly misrepresents the well known publio
acts of the executive, with the manifest
purpose of bringing the incumbent of
that office in,to disrepute, it becomes the
duty of respectable journals *o turn the
sunlight of truth upon such baso sland
ers, and put the seal of their condemua
tion upon such disreputable practices.
Wo are led to make these comments
from reading three editorials in the Dead
wood Press, of Nov. 29th, 30th and Dec.
1st, charging Governor Ordway with
abusing the pardoning powei.
From a casual reading of these articles,
the public would be led to infer that
pardons had recently been granted by
the wholesale although tho writer
limgly avoided specifying particular
cases.
In order to ascertain the exact facts and
give the public accurate information in
regard to the vague charges and insin
uations against the executive, put forth
by the Press we have taken pains to ex
amine the records and petitions in the
executive office relating to pardons.
The result of this investigation shows
that but two pardons have been granted
by Governor Ordway since he assumed
office. The first was Frank Furlong,
poor insane boy, who shortly after being
sent to prison had thrown himself upon
circular saw with the purpose of self
destruction and thus crippling himself
for life—after which he was removed to
the insane asylum upon an order from
Governor Howard, who at that time
assured Furlong's father that he would
be pardoned whenever he was sufficient
ly recovered to leave the asylum.
These facts having been communi
cated to Governor Ordway in writing,
by tho superintendent of the asylum,
with a statement that the father of the
young man was willing to take him away
and bo responsible for him, the pardon
wns granted.
The other case was that of William
Gay, whose sentence had but a short
time to run, and whose case underwent
a most thorough and searching examina
tion before action was taken upon it.
petitions bearing the name's of nearly
every business man and attorney in
Deadwood and vicinity were laid before
Gov. Ordway by a committee of thirty
leading citizens, who went personally to
plead for Gay's release. During a pub
lic hearing at Deadwood, lasting several
days, while many persons, called upon
the governor to plead Gay's cause, not
one person appeared to oppose the pray
er of the petitioners. The officers who
prosecuted Gay,"and the judge who sen
tenced him, all joined in the request that
he be pardoned.
With such a record, proving that Gov
ernor Ordway has guarded the great
boon oi executive clemency with won
derful care and discretion, considering
the large number of cases before him, it
would seem that he would have the right
to expect the approval of all good citi
zens. As to the hypothetical case of a
poor women, whose husband and brother
are imprisoned for stealing one hundred
and sixty bushels of oats, the ostensible
manager of the Press knows very well
that all he has to do, if these cases, and
the others hejhas.named, are meritorious,
is to get a recommendation for mercy
from his father, the judge who sentenced
them, asking for executive clemency in
their behalf, and these cases would re
ceive immediate consideration.
The case of E. O. Adams, convicted in
the United States court of embezzle
ment, and sentenced by Judge Moody,
has heretofore frequently been paraded
for the purpose of casting discredit
upon Secretary Hand, because he grant
ed a respite to Adams while his case
could be heard before the president.
The organic act invests the executive
with the power to grant reprieves in
United States cases, after sentence, until
an application for pardon can be heard
by the president. A numerously
signed petition, asking for a respite of
thirty days for It. O. Adams, in order
that application might be made to the
president for his pardon, was presented
to Seeretary Hand during the governor's
absence, and for good- and sufficient
reasons the respite was granted. Owing
to the prolonged absence of the presi
dent from Washington, the case was un
determined when the thirty days ex
pired, and upon a formal application by
the bondsmen of Adams, and others,
Governor Ordway extended the respite
thirty days, "unless the president should
sooner mako known his decision."
If there is a man with a heart within
him, who could with fiendish delight
wish to seo B. O. Adams compelled to
don a prisoner's garb while his case wail
being heard before the president, or
when perhaps, an unsigned pardon might
be awaiting him at the department of
justice, let such condemn these slight
acts of clemency, but let not personal
malice, envy, or hate attempt to speak
for ]ustice. Neither Secretary Hand or
Gov. Ordway made any recommendation
to the president in Adams' case, but
simply exercised a wise discretionary
power conferred upon them.
The flings in the editorials referred to,
and tho insinuations that Gov. Ordway
had been speculating in the townsite at
Pierre with a view of removing tho capi
tal there, wo are authorized to state, are
ore as maliciously false as the portions
referring to pardons. Tho governor has
not speculated to the extent of one dol
lar in the town site of Pierre, nor has he
ever expressed an opinion favorable to
tho removal ot the capital from its pres
ent location.
The organization of Hughes county
has undoubtedly caused him great
anxiety and annoyance, on account
of his desire to secure a strong
and honest board of coi
sioners, who would work in harmony
in putting down lawlessness which had
gained Buch a strong foothold. In .com
mon, with others, we thought an early
organization of that county desirable,
but recent developments make it
appear that the governor has
acted for the best interests of the bona
fide settlers and property holders, in se
curing tho recent organization, nud we
shall be very much disappointed if the
new officials in Hughes county do not
prove to bo among the most efficient and
trustworthy of any iu the territory. A11
our advices from Hughes county go to
show that the entire list, of officers se
lected bv the new commissioners are
men of character, firmness and integrity
and highly acceptable to the commu
nity.
From advices received from other
counties which Governor Ordway has
organized we are led to believo that he
has been singularly successful in secur
ing commissioners free from all taint of
corruption or jobbery. If any one
knows aught to the contrary let him
speak.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
A. Clour antl Concise DocuiiH'nt from a
Purely Iteptiblican Standpoint.
Washington, Deo. 6—President Hayes'
annual message, delivered to-day to cou
gress, is as follows:
CONGRATULATION'S.
Felloic Citizens of Iks Senate unit House
of Representatives: I congratulate you
on the continued and increasing prosperi
ty of our country. By the favor of
Divine Providence we have been blessed
during the past year with health, with
abundantjliarvests with profitable em
ployment for all of our people and with
contentment at home and with peace and
friendship with other nations.
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth
election of a chief magistrate has just af
forded another opportunity to the people
of the United States to exhibit to the
world a significant example of peaceful
and safe transmission of the power and
authority of the government from
public servants whose terms of
office are about to expire,
to their newly chosen successors. This
example cannot fail to impress profound
ly the thoughtful people of other coun
tries with the advantages which republi
can institutions afford. The immediate,
general and cheerful acquiescence of all
good citizens in the result of the election
gives gratifying assurance to our country
and to its friends throughout the world
that a government based on the free con
sent of an intelligent and patriotic peo
)le possesses elements of strength, sta
jility and permanency not found in any
other form of government.
FRAUDS IX THE SOUTH.
Continued opposition to the full and
free enjoyments of the rights of citizen
ship conferred upon the colored people
by the recent amendment to the consti
tution still prevails in several
the late slave holding states. It has
perhaps not been manifested in the re
cent election, to any large extent, in acts
of violence or intimidation. It has, how
ever, by fraudulent practices, in connec
tion with the ballots, with the regula
tions as to the places and manner of voting
and with returning and canvassing the
votes cast, been successful in defeating
the exercise of the right. The preserva
tion of all rights, the right of suffrage,
which the constitution expressly confers
upon our enfranchised citizens, is the de
sire of the good people of the whole
country and that
THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.
Happily the history of the late elec
tian shows that in many parts of tho
country, where opposition to the fifteenth
amendment has heretofore appeared, it
is diminishing and is likely to cease alto
gether, if firm and well considered ac
tion is taken' by congress. I trust the
house of representatives and the senate,
which have the right to judge of the
election returns and the qualifications of
their own members, will see to it that
every case of violation ol the letter or
spirit of the fifteenth amendment is
thoroughly investigated and that no be
nefit from such violation will accrue to
any person or party. It will be the duty
of the executive, with sufficient appro
priations for the purpose, to prosecute
unsparingly all who have been engaged in
depriving,citizens of the rights gurantoed
to them by the constitution. It is not,
however, to be forgotten that the best and
surest guarantee of tho permnancy of the
rights of citizenship is to be found in that
capacity for self protection which can
belong only to a people whose right to
universal suffrage is supported by uni
versal education. Wherever general
education is found, peace, virtue and
sooial order prevail oud oivil and religious
liberty are secure.
crvjli SERVICE REFORM.
In my former annual messages I have
asked tho attention of congress to tho
urgent necessity of a reformation of the
civil service system of the government.
My views concerning tho dangers ot pat
ronage, or appointments lor personal or
partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and ex
perience in tho executive office, and I
believo the dangers threatening tho sta
bility of tho government, from abuses
so serious in their nature, cannot- be
permanently tolerated. They tend to
become more alarming with tho
enlargement of administrative ser
vices. As the growth of the
country in population inoreases, so
increases the number of officers and
placo for men employed. The reasons
aro imperative for the adoption of fixed
rules for the regulation of appointments
—promotion, pay and removals, estab
lishing a uniform method, having exclu
sively, iu every iustanoe, tho attainment
of the best qualifications for the position
in question. Such a method alone is
consistent with.the equal rights of all
citizens and tho most economical aud
efficient administration of the public
business.
Competitive examination in aid
of impartial appointments and pro
motions have been conducted for
some years past in several
of the executive departments aud bv my
direction this system has been adopted
iu the custom lionses aud post offices of
the larger cities of tho country. In tho
city of New York over two thousand
persons in the civil servico have been
subjected for their appointments and
term of place to the operation of pub
lished rules for tho purpose. During
the past two years the results of these
practical trials have been very satisfac
tory aud have confirmed my opinion in
favor of this system of selection. All are
subjected to the same tests, and the result
is free from prejudice by personal
favor or partisan influence. It securos
for the position applied for, the best
Qualifications altaiuaolo among the com
peting applicants. It is an effectual
protection from the pressure of importu
nity, which, under any other course pur
sued, largely extracts the time and at
tention of appointing of officers, to their
great detriment in the discharge of other
official duties, preventing tho abuse of
the service for the mere furtherance of
private or party purposes and leaving
the employe of the government freed
from the obligations imposed
by patronage, to depend
solely upon merit for retention and ad
vaucemeut, aud with a constant incentive
to excite exortion and improvement.
These invaluable results have been at
tained in a high degree iu the offices
where the rules for appointment by com
petitive examination have been applied.
A method which has so approved itself
by experimental tests, at points where
such tests may be fairly considered con
clusive, should be extended to all subor
dinate positions under the government.
I believe that a strong and growing
public sentiment demands immediate
measures for securing aud enforcing the
highest possible efficiency iu the civil
service and its protection from abuses,
and that that the experience referred to
has demonstrated the feasibility of such
measures.
The examinations in the custom houses
and postoffiees have been held under
many embarrasments and without oom-
Ey
SECTIONALISM
as a factor in our politics should disap
pear. They prefer that no section of the
country should be united in solid oppo
sition to any other section. The disposi
tion to refuse a prompt and hearty obe
dience to the equal rights amendments
to the constitution is all that now stands
in the way of a complete obliteration of
sectional lines in our political contests.
As long as these amendments are flag
rently violated or disregarded, it is safe
to assume that the people who placed
them in the constitution as embody
ing the legitimate results of the
war for the union, and who believe
them to be wise and necessary,
will continue to act together and to
insist that they shall be obeyed.
The paramount question still is as to the
enjoyment of the right by every Ameri
can, who has the requisite qualifications,
to freely cast his vote and to have it
honestly counted. With this question
rightly settled, the country will be re
lieved of the contentions of the past,
by-gones will indeed be by-gones, and
political and party issues, with respect
to economy and efficiency of administra
tion, internal improvements, the tariff,
domestic taxation, education, finance
and other important subjects, will then
receive their full share of
attention. But resistance to
and nullification of the re
sults of the war will unite
together, in resolute purpose, for their
support, all who maintain the authority
of the government and the perpetuity of
the union and-who adequately appreci
ate the value of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no
hostile sentiment or feeling to any part
of the people of otir country or to any
of their interests. The inviolability of
the amendments rests upon the funda
mental principle of our government.
They are the solemn' expression of the
will of the people of the United States.
The sentiment that the constitutional
right of all our citizens must be
maintained does not grow weaker. It will
continue to control the government of
the country.
ensation for the extra labor performed
the officers who have couducted them,
and whose commendable interest iu the
public services has induced this devo
tion and labor without pecuniary re
ward. A continuance of these la
bors gratuiously ought not to be ex
pected, and .without an appropriation
by congress for compensation, it is not
practicable to extend the system of ex
aminations generally throughout the
civil service. It is also highly important
that all such examinations should be con
ducted upon an uniform system aud un
der general supervision. Section 1,753
of the revised statutes authorizes the
president to prescribe the regulations for
admission to the civil service of the
United States and further the purpose
to employ suitable persons to conduct
tho requisite inquiries with reference to
the fitness of each candidate, in respect
to age, health, character, knowledge
and ability for the branch of service
into which he seeks to enter. But the
law is practically inoperative for want of
the requisite appropriation. I therefore
recommend an appropriation of §25,000
per annum to meet tho expenses of a
commission to be appointed by the pres
ident, iu accordance with "the terms
of this section, whose duty it shall be to
devise a just, uniform Bystem of com
petitive examinations and to supervise
the application ot the same throughout
the entire civil service of the
government. I am persuaded that
the facilities which such a com
mission will afford for testing the
fitness of those who apply for office will
not only be as welcome a relief to mem
bers of congress as it will be to the presi
dent and heads of departments, but that
it will also greatly tend to remove the
causes of embarrassment which now ine
vitably and constantly attend the con
flicting claims of patronage between the
legislative and executive departments.
The most effectual check upon the perni
cious competition of influence and offi
cial favoritism is the substitution of an
open competition of merit between ap
plicants, in which every one can file his
record with the assurance thatjhis success
will depend upon his qualifications.
I also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving any officer as free as any
other citizen to express his political
opinions, and to use his means for their
advancement, shall also enable him to
feel as safe as any private citizen iu the
refusal of all demands upon his salary
for political purposes. A law which
should thus guarantee true liberty and
justice to all who aro engaged in the
public service, and likewise
contain strin
gent provisions against the use of offi
cial authority to coerce the political ac
tion of private citizens, or of official sub
ordinates, is greatly to be desired.
The most serious obstacle However to
an improvement of civil service, and es
pecially to a reform in the method oi ap
pointment and removal, has been found
to be the practice under what is known as
the spoils system, by which the appoint
ing power has been so largely encroached
upon by members of congress. The first
step in the reform of the civil service
must be a complete divorce between con
gress and the executive in the matter of
appointments. The corrupting doctrine
toat "To tho victors belong tho spoils,"
is insepernble from congressional
patronage. As the established rule and
practice of parties in power, it comes to
be understood by applicants for office and
by tho people generally that representa
tives and sentators are entitled to dis
burse the patronage of their, respective
districts and states. It is not necessary
to recite at length the evil resulting from
this invasion of the executive function.
The true principles of government on
the subject of appointments to office, as
stated iu the national conventions of the
leading parties of tho conntry, have
again and again been approved by
tho American people and have
not been called in question
in any quarter. These authentic expres
sions of public opinion upon this all-im­
portant subject ore the statement of
principles that belong to the constitu
tional structure of the government,
Under the constitution the president
and heads of departments are to make
nominations for office the senate is to
advise and consent to appointments, and
the houso of representatives is to accuse
and prbseoute faithless officers. The
Ijest interest of the publio service de
mands that these distinctions be respect
ed and that senators aud representatives
who may bo judges and accusers
should not dictate appointments
to office. To this end the co-operation
of the legislative department of the gov
ernment is required alike by the necessi
ties of the case and by publio oxigency.
Members of congress will not bo reliev
ed from tho demands made upon them
with reference to appointments to offico
until, by legislative enactment, the per
nicious practice is condemned and ior
biddeu.
It is therefore recommended that an
act be passed defining tho rotations of
members of congress with respect to
appointments to office by the president
and I also recommend that tho provisions
of section 1,707, aud of the sections fol
lowing, of tho revised statutes, com
prising tho tenure of office
aot of March lid, 18(i7, bo repealed. Bo
lieviug that to reform tho system and
methods of the civil servico in our coun
try is one of the highest and most imper
ative duties of statemnuship, aud that it
can be permauently done only by the co
operation of tho legislative aud executive
departments of the government, I again
recommit the whole subject to your con
siderate attention.
SUPPRESSION OP POLYGAMY.
It is the recognized duty aud purpose
of the people of tho United States to sup
press polygamy where it now exists iu
our territories, aud to piovout its exten
sion. Faithful and zealous efforts have
been made by tho United States
authorities iu Utah to enforce
the laws against it. Experience
has shown that legislation upon this
subject, to be effective, requires exten
sive modification and amendment. The
lougei action is delayed tho more diffi
cult it will bo to accomplish what is de
sired. Prompt and decided measures
aie necessary. The Mormon sectarian
organization which upholds polygamy
has the whole power ot making and exe
cuting the looal legislation of the territo
ry. By its control of tho
grand and petit juries it possesses
large influence over the administration
of justice. Exercising, as tho heads of
this sect do, the local political power of
the territory they aro able to make effec
tive their hostility to the law of congress
on the subject of polygamy, and in fact
do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy
will uot be abolished if the enforcement
of law depends on those who practice
aud uphold the crime. It. can only bo
suppressed by taking away the political
power of the sect which encourages and
sustains it. The power of congress to
enact suitable laws and protect the terri
tories is nmple. It is not a case for half
way measures. The political power of
the Mormon sect is increasing. It con
trols now one of our wealthiest
and most populous territories.
It is extending steadily iuto other terri
tories. Wherever it goes it establishes
polygamy and sectarian political power.
The sanctity of marriage and family
relations are the coiner stone of oiii
American society and civilization. Be
ligious liberty and separation of church
and state are among the elementary
ideas of free institutions. To re-estab
lish principles which polygamy and
Mormouism have imperilled, aud fully
re-open to intelligent and virtuous im
migrants of all creeds that part of our
domain which has been in a great de
gree closed to general immigration by
intolerant and immoral institutions,
it is recommended that the govern
ment of tho territory of Utah be reorgan
gauized. 1 recommend congress to pro
vide for a government for Utah
by a governor and judges, as
commissioners appointed by the
president and confirmed by the sen
ate forming a government aualagous
to the provisional government establish
ed for the territory northwest of Ohio by
the ordinance of 17S7. If, however, it
is deemed best to continue the existing
form of local government, I recommend
that the light to vote and'hold office anil
sit on juries in the territory of Utah be
confined to those who neither practice
or uphold polygamy. If thorough meas
ures are adopted, it is believed that with
in a few years the evils which now afflict
Utah will be eradicated and this territo
ry will in good time become one of the
most prosperous aud attractive of the
new states of the union.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign coun
tries have been those of undisturbed
peace and have presented no occasion
for concern as to their continned main
tenance.
My anticipations of an early reply
from the British government to a de
mand of indemnity to our fishermen for
injuries suffered by that industry at
Fortune bay, in January, 1878, which I
expressed iu my last annual message
were disappointed. This answer was re
ceived only in the latter part of April,
in the present year, aud when received
exhibited a failure of accord between the
two governments, as to tho measure of
in shore fishery privilege secured to our
fishermen by the treaty of Washington,
of so serious a character that I made it
the subject of communications to cou
gress, in which I recommended the adop
tion of measures which seemed to me
proper, to be taken by this government
in maintenance of rights accorded our
fishermen, under the treaty, and
towards securing indemnity for in
jury which these interests had suffered.
A bill to carry out these recommenda
tions was under consideration
by the house representatives
at the time of the adjournment
of congress, in June last. Within a few
weeks I have received a communication
from her majesty's government review
ing consideration of the subject, both
of indemnity for injuries at Fortune Bay
and of the interpretation of the treaty,
in which the previous correspondence
had shown the governments to be at
variance. Upon both of these topics a
disposition towards a friendly agreement
is manifested by tho recognition of our
rights to indemnity for the transaction
at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure ol
suoh indemnity to a further confcrence,
and by nn assent to the view of this
government presented in previous cor
respondence, that the regulation of con
flicting interests of shore fishery of
the provincial sea coasts and vessel fish
ery of our fishermen should be made the
subject conference and concurrent ar
rangement between the two governments.
I sincerely hope a basis may bo found
for a speedy adjustment of the very ser
ious divergence of views in the interpre
tation of the fishery clauses of tho trea
ty of Washington which, as tho corres
pondence between the two governments
stood at the close of tho last session of
congress, seemed to be irreconcilable.
In an important exhibition of arts and
industries which was lield last year at
Sydney, New South Wales,as well as that
now in progress at Mclbourne,the United
States have been efficiently and honora
bly represented.
Exhibitors from this country at tho
former place received a largo number of
awards in soma of the most considerable
departments, and the participation of
the United States was recognized by
special mark of distinction. In the ex­
hibition at Melbourn tho share taken by
our country is no less notable au|l an
equal degree of success is confidently
expected.
The state of peace and tranquility now
enjoyed by all the nations oi the conti
nentofEuropeliasitsfavorablo influence
upon our diplomatic and commercial re
lations with them. Wo have conoluded
and ratified a convention with tho French
republic for tho settlement of claims of
the citizens of either country against
the other. Under- this convention a
commission presided over by a distin
guished publicist, appointed, in pursu
ance of tho request, of both nations, by
his majesty, the emperor of Brazil, lias
been organized aud hnB begun its ses
sions in this city.
A congress to consider means tor tho
protection of industrial prosperity has
recently been in session in Paris, to
which I have appointed the ministers of
the United States in France and in Bel
gium as delegates.
Tho international commission upon
weights and measures also continues its
work in Paris.
I invito your attention to the necessity
of an appropriation to bo made in time
to enable this government to comply
with its obligations under tho metrical
convention.
Our friendly relations with the Ger
man ompiro continue without interrup
tion. At the recent international oxh,
bitiou of fish and fisheries, at Berliui
the participation of the United States,
notwithstanding tho haste with which
the eommision was forced to mako its
preparations, was extremely successful
aud meritorious, winning, for private
exhibition, numerous awards of a high
class, and for the country at large tho
principal prize of honor offered by his
majesty, the emperor. Tho results
of this great success caunot
but bo advantageous to this
important and growing industry.
There has been somo question raised
between the two governments as to the
proper effect and interpretation of our
treaties of naturalization but recent dis
patches from our miuister at Berlin show
that favorable progress is making to
wards an understanding, in accordance
with tho views of this government, which
makes and admits no distinction what
ever between tho rights of a native and
naturalized, citizen of tho United States.
In practice, tho complaints of molesta
tion suffered by naturalized citizen
abroad have never been fewer than at
present.
There is nothing of importance to note
iu our unbroken friendly relations with
the governments of Austria, Hungary,
liussia, Portugal, Sweden and Norway,
Switzerland, Turkey aud Greece.
During last summer several vossels be
longing to tho merchant marine of this
country, sailing in the neutral waters of
the West Indies, were fired at, boarded
and searched by an armed cruiser ol the
Spanish goverument. The circumstances
as reported, iuvolve not only private in
jury to persons concerned, butall seemed
to be little observant of the friendly re
lations existing for nearly a century be
tween this country and Spain. The
wrong was brought to the attention of
the Spanish government in a series of
protests aud remonstrances, and tho mat
ter is undergoing investigation by the
royal authorities with a view to such ex
planation and reparation as may be call
ed for by the facts. A commission, sit
ting iu this city for the adjudication of
the claims of our citizens against the
government of Spaiu, is, 1 hope, ap
proaching a termination of its labors.
Claims against the United States,under
the Florida treaty with Spain, were sub
mitted to congress for its action at the
late session and I again invite your at
tention to this long standing questiou
witli a view to a final disposition of the
matter.
At the invitation of the Spanish gov
ernment a conference, has recently been
held at the city of Madrid to consider
the subject by foreign powers of native
Moors iu the empire of Morocco. The
miuister of the United States in Spain
was directed to take part in the ilelib
orations of this conference, the result of
which is a conveution signed on behalf
of all tho powers represented. This in
strument will be laid before the senate
for its consideration. The government
of the United States has also lost no
opportunity to urge upon that of tho
emperor of Morocco the necessity, in
accordance with tho humane aud cu
lightened spirit of the age, of putting
an end to persecutions, which have been
so prevalent iu that country, of persons
of a faith other than Musselinun, and
especially of Hebrew residents of Mo
rocco.
A consular treaty concluded with Bel
gium is not yet officially promulgated,
owing to the alteration of a word on the
text by the United States, which occa
sioned delay, during which the time al
lowed for ratillcation expired. The sen
ate will bo asked to extend the period
for ratification.
An attempt to negotiate a treaty of
extradition, with Denmark failed on ac
count of the objection of the Danish
government to the usual clause providing
that each nation Bhould pay tho expense
of arrests of persons whoso extradition it
asks.
Provision made by congress at the last
session for the expense of a commission
which has been appointed to enter upon
negotiations with the temporal gov
ernment of China on subjects of great
interest to the relations of the two
countries, enabled the commission
ers to proceed at once upon their mis
sion. The imperial government was
prepared to give prompt and respectful
attention to the matters brought under
negotiation, and the conferences pro
ceeded with such rapidity and success
that on the seventeenth of November
last two treaties were signed at Pekin,
one relating to the introduction of
Chinese into this country, aud one rela
ting to commerce. Mr. Prescott, ono of
the commissioners is now on his way
home and will bring the treaties, and it
is expected they will bo received iu
season to be laid before the senate early
in January.
Our minister in japan lias negotiated
a convention for the reciprocal relief of
ship wrecked seamen. I take occa
sion to urge once more upon congress
tho propriety of making provision for
the erection of a suitable fire-proof build
iugs at tho Japanese capital for tho use
of the American legation and a court
house and jail connected with it. The
Japanese government, with great gen
erosity and courtesy, lias offered for this
purpose an eligible piece of land.
In my last annual message I invited
tho attention of congress to tho subject
of indemnity funds received somo years
ago from China and Japan. I renew lie
recommendation then made, that what
ever portions of these funds are
due to American citizens should
bo promptly paid aud tiie
residue returned to the nations, respect
ively, to which they justly and equitably
belong.
An extradition treaty with tho kingdom
of Netherlands, which has been for somo
time in coursn of negotiation, has, dur
ing the past year, been concluded and
duly ratified.
Belations of friendship and amnity
have been established between tho gov
ernment of tho United States and that of
lioumania. We have sent diplomatic
representative to Bucharest and have re
ceived at this capital a special envoy,
who lias been charged by his royal high
ness, Prince Charles, to announce tho in
dependent sovereignty of Rotuoania.
Wo hope for the speedy development of
commercial relations betweou tho two
countries.
In uiy hist annual message I expressed
the liopo that the pi
ovulenoo 'of quiet on
tlio border betwoon this country and
Mexico would soon become so assured as
to justify a modification of orders thou
in force to our military commanders, iu
regard to crossing tho frontier without
encouraging suoh disturbances as would
endanger the peaoeof tho two countries,
liivents moved in accordance with these
expectations and orders were according
ly withdrawn, to tho entire satisfaction
our own oitizous aud the Mexican gov
ernment. Subsequently tho peace of
tho border was again disturbed by a
savage jforay under tho command of
Chief Victoria, but by tho combined
action of the military of both countries
his band lias beou broken up and sub
stantially destroyed. There is reason to
bonovo that obstacles which have so
long prevented rapid and couveuicnt
communication betwoon tho United
States and Mexico by railways
1110
tl'e point of disappearing,
that several important ou-
and
terprises of this character will soon
bo set oil foot, which cannot fail to con
tribute largely to the prosperity of both
countries.
,New envoys from Guutamala, Colom
bia, Bolivia, Venezuela aud Nicaragua
liavo recently arrived at this capital,
whose distinction and enlightenment af
ford tho best guarantee of tlio continu
ance of friendly relations betwoon our
selves and tlieso sister republics.
Belations betwoon this government
aud that of Colombia have eugaged
public attention during tho past year,
mainly by reason of the project
of an interoceauic canal across
tho isthmus of Panama, to bo built
by private capital, uudcr ooncossions
from the Colombian government, for
that purpose, in treaty obligations sub
sisting betweeu tho United States aud
Colombia. This project makes it neces
sary that tho conditions under which so
stupendous a change in tho region em
braced iu this guarantee should bo ef
fected, transforming as it would this
isthmus from a barrier between the At
lantic and tho Pacific, oceans, into a gate
way and thoroughfare between them for
tho navies aud merchantships of the
world, should receivo the approval of
this government.
The relations of the United States
with the empire of Brazil continue to be
most cordial and their commerciifl inter
course steadily increases, to their mutual
advantage.
Internal disorders with which tho Ar
gentine republic has lor some time past
been afflicted, and which have inoro or
less influenced its external trude, are un
derstood to have been brought to a close.
This happy result may bo expected to
redound to the bouelit of the for
eign commerce of that republic,
as well as to the development of its vast
interior resources.
In tho Samoa goverument, King Mal
ictoa, under the support aud recognition
of the consular representatives of tho
United States, Great Britiau and Ger
many, seems to have given peace aud
tranquility to tho islands. While it does
not appear desirable to adopt as a whole
the scheme of the tripartic local move
ment which has been proposed, the com
mon interests of throo great treaty pow
ers require harmony iu their relations to
the uat-ivo form of government, aud this
may be best secured by a simple
diplomatic agreement between them.
It would be well if tho
consular jurisdiction of our representa
tive at Asia were increased in extent and
importance so as to guard American in
terests in the surrounding aud outlyiug
lands of Oceanica.
Tlio obelisk generously presented by
the khedive of Egypt to the city of Now
York lias safely arrived in this country
and will be erected iu that metropolis.
The commission for the liquidation of
tho Egyptian debt has lately concluded
its work, and this goverument, at tho
earnest solicitation of the khediyc, has
acceded to the provisions adopted by it,
which will be laid before congress for its
consideration. The commission for the
revision of the judicial code
of the reform tribunal of
Egypt is now in session in
Cairo. Mr. Forniau, consul general
anil J. M. Batchelder, esq., have been ap
pointed as commissioners to participate
in this work of the organization of reform
tribunals and will probably bo continued
for another period of tivo years.
In pursuance of au act passed at the
last session of congress, invitations have
been extended to foreign maritime states
to join in a sanitary conference, in Wash
ington, beginning the first of January.
The acceptance of this invitation by
many prominent powers, gives promiso
of success in this important measure.
It is designed to establish a sys
tem of international notification, by
which the spread of infectious or epi
demic diseases may be more effectually
cheeked or prevented. Tho attention of
congress is invited to the necessary ap
propriations lor carrying into effect the
provisions of the act referred to.
The efforts of the department of state
to enlarge tho trade and commerce of
the United States, through the active
agcucy of consular officers and through
the dissemination of information obtain
ed from them lias been unrelaxed. The
interest in these efforts as devel
oped in our commerce, and the
value of the information secured by this
means to the trade and manufactures of
the country woro recognized by congress
at its last session, and provision was
made for the moro frequent publication
of consular and other reports by the de
partment of state. The first issue ot
this publication has now been prepared
and subsequent issues may regularly be
expected. The importance aud interest
attached to the reports of consular
officers aro witnessed by the general
demand for them by all classss of mer
chants and manufacturers engaged in
our foreign trado. It is believed the
system of such publications is deserving
of the approval of congress, and necessary
appropriations for its continuance and
enlargement will commend itself to your
consideration. Tho prosperous energies
of our domestic industries and their im
menso production of subjects of foreign
commerce invito and -even require
active development of the wishos and
interests of our people in that direction.
Especially important is it that our com
mercial relations with tho Atlantic and
Pacific coasts of South America, with
tho West Indies and the gulf of Mexico
should bo direct and not through a cir
cuit of Enropean system and should bo
carried on in our own bottoms,
Full appreciation of the opportunities
which our front on the Pacific ocean
gives to connect with Japan, China and
the East Indies, with Australia and tho
islund groups which lie along tlieso
routes of navigation, should inspire
equal efforts appropriate to our
own shipping, and to administer by our
own capital, a duo proportion of this
trade. Whatever modifications of otir
regulations of trade and navigation may
be necessary or useful to meet and di
rect their impulses to the enlargement of
our exchanges and onr carrying trade, 1
am sure tho wisdom of congress will bo
ready to supply an initial measure.
However, it seems to mo so clearly useful
and efficient, that 1 vciituro to press it
upon your earnest attentiou.
It seems to Ijo very evident that the
provision of regular steam postal com
munication by aid from tho government
lias beou a forerunner of oommercial prom*
inanco to Great Hritian. On all these
coasts and seas, the greater, share in
whose trade is now tho desire and intent
of our poople. It is also manifest that"
the efforts of other European nations to
oontend with Great Britian for a shnro
of this oommorce have beon successful in
proportion with their adoption of
regular steam postal connection
with markets whoso trado they sought.
Mexico and tho states of South America
aro anxiouB to receivo Such postal com
munications with this country, and aid
in their development. Similar co-opor
atiou may be looked for in due time
from eastern nations and from Australia.
It is difficult to sco how a lead iu this
movement can be oxpected from private
interest. In respcct to foreign commerce,
quite as much as in internal trade, pos
tal connection seems necessary, and tho
matter demands publio attention. I ro
speotfully recommend to your prompt
attention suoh just and efficient measures
as may conduce to tho development of
our foreign commercial exchanges and
tho building up of our carrying trado.
FINANCIAL.
Tho condition of tlio financial affairs
of tho government as shown by tho re
ports ot the secretary of the treasury, is
very satisfactory. It is believed the
present fiuaneial situation of the United
Slates, whether considered with respcct
to tlio trado, ourreucy, orodit, growing
wealth or exteut and variety of our re
resources, is more favorable than
that of any other country of our
time and has nover been sur
passed by that of any country at any
period of its existence. All onr indus
tries are thriving, the rate of interest is
low, now railroads are being coustruoted
—vast, immigration is increasing, our
population, capital, labor, now enter
prises iu great numbers, are iu progress,
and our commercial relations with other
countries are improving..

for the premium on bonds purchased,
$2,795,320. Total ordinary expenditures
$207,612,957, leaving a surplus revenue
of $65,883,053, which, with an amount
drawn from the cash value in tho trea
sury of $8,084,434, making $73,908,087,
was applied to tho redemption of bonds.
For tho sinking fund, $73,G52,900 of
the loan of 1858, $-105,900 of the tern
porary loan, $100,000 of tho bounty land
scrip, $25,1)00 of compouuil interest

The amount duo the sinking fund for
this year was $37,931,043. There was
applied to this the sum of $7,394,017, be
ing $35,972,973 in excess of the actual
requirements for the year. The aggregate
of the revenues from all sources during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was
$333,520,010, an increase over the preced
ing year of $59,099,420. The receipts
thus far of tho current year, amount to
$350,000,000, which will be sufficient
to meet tlio estimated expenditures
of the year aud leave a surplus of $90,
000,000. It is fortunate this largo sur
plus of revenue occurs at a period wlieu
it may be directly applied to the pay
ment of tho puplic debt, soon to bo re
deemable. No publio duty lias been
more constantly cherished in the United
States than the policy of paying the na
tional debt as rapidly as possible. The
debt of tho United States, less cash in
the treasury and exclusive of accruing
interest, attained its maximum of $2,
750,441,571 in August, 1855, aud has
since that time been reduced to $1,
880,019,504. Of tho principal of
the debt, $108,758,100 has beon
paid since March 1, 1871, effecting
an anuual saving of interest of $6,107,
593. The burden of interest lias also
been diminished by the sale ol bonds
bearing a low rate of interest and tho
application of tho proceeds to the re
demption of bonds bearing a higher
rate. The annual saving thus secured
since March 1,1877, is $14,290,452. With
in a short period over $600,000,000 of fivo
and six per cent bondB will become re
deemable. This presents a very
favorable opportunity not only
to further reduce the principal
of debt, but also to reduce tho rate of
inteiest on that which will remain un
puid.
I call the attention of congress to the
views oxpressed on this subject by the
secretary of the treasury in his annual
report and recommend prompt legisla
tion to enable the treasury department
to complete the refunding of the debt
which is about mature.
The continuance of specio payments
has not been interrupted or cutlangered.
Since the date of resumption it has con
tributed greatly to tho revival of busi
ness and to our remarkable prosperity.
The fears that preceded and ac
companied lcsumptiou have proved
groundless. No considerable amount
of United States notes have beeu pre
sented for redemption, while very large
Bums of gold bullion, both domestic
nud imported, are taken to the mints
and exchanged for coin or notes. The
increase ot coin and bullion in tho
United States since January 1st, 1879, is
estimated at $227,399,'128,
There are still in existonce, uncan
celled, $310,681,010 United States legal
tender notes. These notes wore
authorized ns war measures, made neces
sary by tho exigencies of tho conlliet iu
which the United States was then en
gaged. The preservation of the nation's
existence required, iu the judgment of
congress, the issue of legal tender paper
curreuoy. That it served well the pur
pose for which it was created is not now
questioned, but the employment of tho
notes as paper money indefinitely, alter
the acoompliBhment of the object for
which tlioy wore provided, was not con
templated by the trainers of law under
which they were issued. These notes
long since became like any other
pecuniary obligation of tho government,
—a debt to bo paid and when paid to lie
cancelled as more avidenco of au indebt
edness no longer existing. I, thorofore,
repent what wits said iu my
annual message of last year,
that rotiroment from circulation of
United States note* with tho capacity of
legal tender in private contracU is a step
