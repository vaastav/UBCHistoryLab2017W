IEAST INDIANS
ARE FLOCKING
QVERTHE SEA
Immigration Department Is
Busy Trying to Frustrate
Plans of Secret Organiza
tion at Manila.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 3. Immi
gration officials of the United1 States
are busy with efforts to frustrate the
plans of a secret organization with
headquartors at Manila to flood the Pa
cific coast stateB with Hindu laborers,
according to Anthony Cnminotti, com
missioner eonoral of immigration. Mr.
Caminotti loft here today for Seattle
after having conferred yesterday with
British Columbia officials at Victoria
on immigration problems,
Advices had reached the immigration
service, Mr. Caminotti said, that ar
rangements had been made at Manila
to send the Ea6t Indians from tho Phil
ippines with certificates obtained from
tho insular government. On the
strength of these certificates a party of
five Hindus gained admission to the
United States at San Francisco, estab
lishing a precedent, he said, and prep
arations were made immediately for
sending forward an army of laborers in
the same way.
Ilji Barred by U. S.
Cots were purchased by tho Manila
h agents for the use of Hindus on ship-
- board on route to Pacific coast ports so
If that they might sleep on deck when reg-
fl ular accommodations were overtaxed.
If; The American immigration department
If; became active, Mr. Caminotti said, as
It; soon as the plan became known and tho
, majority of the Hindus applying for
admission at San Francisco were aft-
! orwards rejected as liable to become
, public charges. The 6arno treatment
I met them at other ports.
If ! Mr. Caminetti said he had arrived at
J: an agreement with the Great Northern
I and Northern Pacific railroads restrict
I ing the transportation of Hindu labor
ers and hoped for similar agreements
. with other transcontinental lines.
: Canada's Problem.
: A dispatch from Ottawa today says
V the Dominion government is considering
:. a new solution of tbo Hindu problem in
t British Columbia. This plan has been
4 suggested by the imperial and Indian
executives and it proposes that tho ex
i : cess Hindu population, instead of going
!' to Canada and South Africa to embar
rass those countries, hall bo sont by
: way of the emigration service to the
Soudan.
. Japanese immigration, as well as the
Hindu movement to Canada, is showing
I signs of increasing, and close watch is
being kept upon it.
For the first six months of the fiscal
1 year 571 Japanese immigrants entered
I Canada. Of this number 289 were fe-
I males, 235 males and 7 children.
! In the last few yoars an increasing
number of Japanese women have been
coming to Canada. For the year 1912
t 1913. of the total Japanese immigration
P of 724, -124 were women and 48 chil-
I drcn.

VIHAUH
1 MEXIC1 CAPITAL
(Oontiiiued from Pago Ono.)
treatment of tho Mexican problem 1b soon
to bo rewarded by a solution brought
about by operation of tho great lntornnl
forces now engaged In a final Btruggle
In Mexico. Such a conclusion has been
the one principal object of the American
administration
Among the facts which form the basis
of tho oellef that tho closing chapters
of the Huerta regime are now being
written 1b n report to tho state depart
ment, from agents In Mexico, that tho
federal troops are no longer In receipt
of their pay, without which, cxporlenco
has shown, their loyalty cannot bo de
pended upon. Other reports regarded as
Indicating the speedy triumph of the con
stitutionalist forces related to the pre
cipitate flight of tho heads of tho fam
ilies which have controlled vast estates In
northern Mexico, employing thousands of
peons in agriculture, stock raising and I
mining. Their Hlght and the abandon
ment of their properties deprives the
Huerta government of a source of revc
nuo much needed at present.
Inquiry that has been made unofficial
ly Into tho reports that large shipments
of arms and ammunition hnd been or
dered by the Huerta government, and
were now on their way to Mexico, has
developed the fact that such orders as
are being filled were placed many months
ago, in the early days of the present
revolution when it seemed Insignificant.
There was no change recorded today
in the disposition of American military or
naval forces In Mexican waters.
Tho navy department announced that
the 700 marines which arrived at Fensa
cola, Fla., yesterday on the Prairie had
been kept aboard ship because there were
not sufficient quarters ashore at present
for all of them. Tho plan Is to keep some
of the men permanently aboard ship.
UNITED STATES IS
DEFIED BY HUERTA
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 3. The enun
ciation of Washington's policy appears
not to havo alarmed President Huerta,
especially as ho long ago abandoned
liopo of anything but opposition from
the United States. Ho said today:
,4I have no intention of yielding.
Should this fighting in Mexico continuo
for years I shall continue to do my
part in it if 1 am still alive."
General Huorta declared that the
country was self -supporting and that
forced" loans, if made necessary, would
enable him to resist indefinitely. So
long a6 he was able to obtain Ameri
can oil he did not regard tho shutting
off of native oil from the railways as
vital.
An outline of tho message delivered
by President Wilson to congrosB at
Washington was prominently displayed
by all tho Spanish morning newspapers
today. The only paper printed in Eng
lish, however, buried it on an inside
page. In commenting on the message
the Indepondionte. which is controlled
by the government, says:
"Tho man at the White house has
dared to affirm (against the truth uni
versally conceded) that Provisional
President Huerta is losing sympathy
every day and that his fall is to bo ex
pected. It was hardly believable that
President Wilson would havo the tem
erity to assert such a thing. Ho there
by gives testimony of his bad faith to
ward things Mexican."
H. S. Kidder, general traveling sales
agent for tho Waters-Pierce OiT com
pany, was released on a bond of $2500
at San Luis Potosi today, after submit
ting to trial by the fodoral authorities
on a chargo or sedition.
Apparently tho only evidence against
Kiddor was that while riding on the
railroad he had talked with employees
regarding prevailing conditions and
frequently looked through his field
glasses at tho landscape. He was mar
ried on November 25.
Tho war department today published
an order transferring General Porfirio
Diaz from the retired list to tho active
list. The order bears the date of Sep
tember 20.
REBELS EXECUTE
WEALTHY MEXICAN
HERMOSrLLO. Sonora. Mexico, Dec. 3.
A wealthy Mexican resident of Slna
loa was shot to death here early today
by a firing squad of Insurgent soldiers.
He was Antonio V. Caballero, convicted
of plotting against the constitutionalist
government of his state.
It was at the darkest hour, Just bo
fore dawn, when Caballero was placed
against a wall of sun-baked brick fac
ing the cemetery where his body now
rests. A group of army officers and a
few curious civilians stood by.
The prisoner walked alone to the wall,
received the blessing of a priest and
placed the executioners' bandage over
his eyes with his own hands.
"Mark well the heart," ho said.
Nothing was visible to the marksmen
except the silhouette of his shirt sleeves
and the white bandage over the head.
The firing squad moved to within ten
feet of their human mark and the Avo
rifles fired as one.
According to the findings of tho court
martial Caballero had been confronted
with letters signed by his name which
gave details of the Insurgent strength
in Cullacan recently taken by the con
stitutionalists. Moved to pity by tho presence here
of the doomed man's wife and two chil
dren, a score of women of Hormoslllo
called on Oenernl Carranza at tho laBt
moment to ask mercy. The constitu
tionalist commander told them they had
come too late.
General Carranza declined today to
comment on the news from Juarez that
soveral federal generals were sending
commissioners to treat with' the revolu
tionists. "You will sco whothor I receive them
when the time comes," said the consti
tutionalist commander.
Tho news that Chihuahua had offered
Itself as a rebel prize was received with
satisfaction by constitutionalist leaders
who considered It proof of tho failing
of General Huerta's military power.
If the peace commissioners to Gen
eral Villa attempt to offer any propo
sition bordering on a compromise with
tho Huerta government, It was consid
ered improbable that General Carranza
would hear thorn. In this connoctlon
those closely In touch with the situa
tion referred to Carranza'u frequent ut
terances regarding an uncompromising
stand toward the party which ovorthrew
tho Madero government,
Thore was Borne doubt as to Carranza's
attitude should tho federal commandcin
wish to ally themeelves with tho revo
lutionary movement. At the beginning
of the revolution Carranza allowed thirty
dnys In which he would accept such of
fers, and It was thought hero that re
cent successes of the Insurgents would
reinforce this attitude.
Tho only former federal army officer
prominently connoctcd with the revolu
tion is General Felipe AngeleB. secre
tary of war in Carranza's provisional
cabinet. Ho was one of tho few regu
'ar army generals who upheld President
Madero and novor recognized the Huerta
government.
EL PASO. Tex., Dec 3. On Informa
llon that the refugees from Chihuahua
wcro within thirty miles of OJlnaga on
tho faordcr, a squadron of the Fifteenth
United States cavalry tonight was or
dered to Presidio, Texas, opposite OJIn
"ga. The military authorities were In
structed to arrest any Mexican federal
officers who might attempt to ctobs the
border.
Five Moxlcan officers, including two
colonels, who had been held at Fort
Bllsn for violation of tho neutrality law.
were released today.

ORDINANCE PASSED
TO CONDENSE WORK
The long-contemplated consolidation
of the poll tax department and the
special license department into one, and
the creation of the office of city license
assessor and collector, was effected yos
terday by tho city commission. Ordi
nances woro passed abolishing tho poll
tax dopartment, creating tho new de

PERSISTENT RUMOR
IS DENIED BY MACK
"I cannot understand whore the rumor
Btarted or why, but you can say for mo
that there Is absolutely nothing to It.
Wo are booked for plays woeks and weeks
ahead. Wo are happy In our home and
professional life, and Salt Lake Is our
homo and tho Utah theater Is where
w will play until the houso closes for
tho summer."
This statement was made by Wlllard
Mack, co-star with Marjorle Rambcau
at tho Utah theater, laBt evening after
a score of Inquiries were received as
to the length of the Mack-Ilambeau en
gagement at the State street playhouse.
There have been persistent rumors that
tho J4ack3 were about to lenvo Salt
Lake. Whero they started and why could
not ho ascertained, but they aro without
foundation in fact, as stated.
"Manuscripts are hero now," continued
Mr. Mack, "for tho weeks boglnnlng De
cember 7, 14, 21 and 2S. They are all big
succcssea."

Ho was at one tlrm: connected with the

Alfred E, Duncan, president of the
Fmnklln Innuranco company, who died

Ml WAY TO
EIDJpATISi
Ease Stiff, Sore Joints and Mus
cles. Makes Pains and Back
ache Promptly Vanish.
"Most all rheumatism is duo to ono
cause weak kidneys," says a noted
authority. Tho kidneys bocomo clogged
up. Ret sluggish and filler or strain out
only a part of the poisonous waste mat
tor and uric acid, all tho rest remains
in tho blood and circulates through the
system, and causes all tho trouble,
The only way to ovcrcomo this, i'b to
mako your kidnoys work properly. You
can easily and surely do this hy taking
a little Croxouo, which never fails to
act promptly.
Cro.vone not only cleans out tho
clogged up kidneys, strongthenn them
and maUes lhem active, but it neutral
izes and dissolves the poisonous waste
substances, and uric acid, that scratch
nnd irritate and causa rheumatism, so
tho kidnoys can filter thorn from the
blood and drive them out of tho Bystem.
Croxonc is believed to bo the most
remarkable preparation over known for
the prompt relief nnd cure of rhouma
tism, kidney troubles, and bladder dis
orders. It is entirely different from
other remedies. It is so prepared that
it is practically impossible to take it
without results. Relief follows the first
few doses, and you will be surprised
how quickly stiff, soro, swollen .loiuta,
nnd muscles, rheumatic pains, and all
such misory ends.
An original packago of Croxono costs
but a trifle, and every druggist recom
mends and sells it on a positive money
back guarantee. Three doses a day, for
a few dayB aro often all that is ever
needed to overcome tho worst backache
or most annoying urinary disorders.

'TIS PASSING SAD,
'TIS PISSED IS!
Hotel Roller Towel of Long
Acquaintance Gone Way of
All Old Friends.
That mysterious rag the germ-laden
roller towel which has hung for many
months In various local hotels after the
law against It was passed, undisturbed
by tho fell hands of the state hotel In
spector, but disturbed by many hands of
the traveling public, lias at la3t disap
peared. Its passing was promoted by the op
erations of J. J. Myers, state hotel In
spector, who, after causing all tho hos
telries through tho state to conform to
tho various clauses of the hotel laws,
has made a Salt Lake- campaign. As
a result, all the local establishments have
dispensed with the roller towel and have
acquired various other necessities, such
as six-foot sheets and sanitary flro es
capes. Tho demise of the hotel roller towel Is
a sad affair. The popular at times too
popular face-drying apparatus will be
missed by various traveling men, who
took a gambler's delight In securing a
chance to find a clean place on the cloth.
It will bo missed In sadness by n few
hotel proprietors who, since It was laid
away, have been forced to provide In
dividual towels for their guests at a
somewhat higher laundry upkeep. In
nearly all cases Individual towels, rather
than those made of paper, have taken
the places of tho dear departed, and there
Is joy In the laundrymen's hearts.
