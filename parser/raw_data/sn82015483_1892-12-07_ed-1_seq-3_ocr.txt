United States port to another is not pro

foreign port shall be carried from ono port
to another of the United States. The bill
provides that tbe president may. by proc
lamation, suspend the right of carrying
merchandise in bond through the United
States, provided for in the bill in care the
dominion shall at any time deprive the
citizens of the United States of the use of
the canals in the dominion on the terms of
eqaalty with Canada, as provided by the
thirty-seventh article of the treaty of
Washington. It is also provided that in
case any report or other duty continnes to
be levied on lumber or timber of any kind
cnt on that portion of the American terri
tory in the Btate of Maine, watered by the
St. John and its tributaries and floated

may suspend all rights of carrying pro
vided for in this seotion so long as the ex
port duty is levied.

ASPHYXIATED
Two
Swedes
Found
Dead In
Hotel.
Jew York, JJeo. o. Two men were
found this afternoon asphyxiated in
room of the Nomenade hotel on Green
wicn street, xney were registered as
"Henry Burg and Peter Lund of Canada."
The deceased came to the hotel with 'three
others on Monday. The three men re
ferred to left the hotel to-day at 1 p. m
The police are looking for them. The
room in which the men were found was
full of gas, escaping from an open burner.
The room bad no outside windows. The
only means of ventilation was by means
of a small transom. Tbe dead men and
their companions were undoubtedly
Swedes. It is thought that they were en
ronte from western Canada to their homes
in Sweden.
PROFESSOR BR1GGS1 THEORY
Cotubatted by Dr. Birch Citing
Scripture Argument of tile Prose-
cation.
New York, Dec. 6. In tbe Briggs trial
to day Dr. Birch continued his argument,
He joined the two charges 1 and 2, which
set forth Dr. Briggs' theory that the
church and the rea9on are sources of
divine authority equal with the bible and
attacked them contrary to the teaohings of
the Presbyterian standard that the bible is
the only source of divine authority.
Dr. Birch said: "The inaugural ad
dress co-ordinates the authority of the
bible, the church and the reason. It
avails nothing to say that the authority of
the church and the reason are fallible,
while the bible alone is infallible, for if
all are from Ood they stand or fall to
gether." Dr. Birch then read nine passages of
scriptures to whioh, be asserted, Dr.
tinges' doctrine of salvation through the
light of reason is iu direct conflict. The
texts are recorded in Isaiah 8:20, Matthew
34, Luke 16:29-31, John 5:39, John 14:6,
Galations 5:10. II Timothy 5:15-17, and
II Peter 1:19-21. These citations, the
speaker declared, proved the charges be
yond question.
Dr. Birch then summoned, as he said.
four scriptural witnesses to the stand and
examined them on the question at issue.
The witnesses were the Ethiopian eunnch,
the centurion Cornelius, the soholarly
Bereans and Apollos, the friend
and coworker with St. Paul. All
these found the scriptures essen
tial for salvation. To deny the
necessity of the soriptnres, said Dr. Birch,
is to deny the integrity of God. Having
attacked the authority of the scriptures
there is no escape from the heresy that er
rors may have existed in the original text
of the scriptures and this forms the basis
for charge 3. The higher criticism as
represented bythe inaugural nses the game
processes as those rebuked by Christ. The
bible frequently speaks cf itself as the ora
cles of God. The ohurch is only the trus
tee and guardian of the bible. If Dr.
Briggs alleges that errors exist in the
bible he denies the principle that God can
not lie; Dr. Briggs says that tbe
bible is inspired by God, therefore, he must
believe tiod capable of double dealing and
misrepresentation. The autocracy of the
scripture is so absolute that we cannot
add to nor take from it anything without
destroying its unity and completeness.

THE SMITH TRIAL.
Cincinnati, Deo. 6. Dr. Lowe closed
his argument for the prosecution in Pro
fessor Smith's trial for heresy, and Profes
sor Smith began his last speech in his own
defence. The main question he deolar.d
to be inspiration of such a natnre that
the holy spirit overcame the natural bias
of the human writers of the bible so
as to preolude all possibility of error, even
of faot. The committee held that it was of
such a nature, but he maintained that the
confession of faith did not require such a
belief. lie quoted from Warheld and
Hodge to show that the scriptures bore in
delible traces of human error.
The argument will be continued to-morrow.
COIN FRENCH TALK.
Educational Value of the English
Scheme Fears of a Repeal of the
Sherman Act.
Brussels, Deo. 6. Dana Horton, inter
viewed yesterday, by the representative
of the Associated Press, in speaking
of the monetary conference, said: "It
would be difficult to overestimate the edu
cational value of Alfred De Rothschild's
proposals. This conference is only a step
in a long series. It is a lesson in the edu
cation of the nations of the advantage of
co-operation In common interests."
Telegrams from Berlin say that there is
talk of the silver question being raised in
the reichstag before the conference ad
journs with a view to inducing the govern
ment to authorize the German delegates at
the conference to go beyond the proposals
Germany presented at the Paris conference
of 1881.
The next meeting is expected to be of
unusual interest. Congressman James B.
McCreary, one of the United States dele
gates, is expected to make an important
statement with reference to the American
program and the probable future policy of
his government.
Tbe possibility of the repeal ot tbe
Sherman act was much discussed among
members of the conference yesterday.
The opinion was that it wonld be a serious
blow nnleBB accompanied by some other
legislation in support of silver.

Sprinovield, Msbs., Do. 6. The city
eleotion to-day waa qnie) and the expected
happened In the election of . P. Kendrick
(rep ) over K. H. Mather (dem.) by a plur
allty of 1,436. . Mr. Kendrlck Ia a lawyer
and has served three years In the legislat
ure, three years In the oommon council
and one year on the board of aldermen.
The siae of the plummy against Alderman
Mather is largely owing to the faot that bis
nomination was scoured by the democratic
ring which ousted Mayor Sibley. Tbe re
publicans also elected their entire alder
mania ticket and eleven republican conn'
oilmen to six democrats. The no license
campaign which has been waged for tbe
past few Weeks by tbe central temperanoe
board aroused the license men and the oity
went for lioense by 1,003, against 843 last

choice of H. H. Harris (rep.) over Dr. Hellen

GEOBGE W. CHILD'S LOSS.
Fire mad Water Destroy the Public
Ldrtr Balldlne Flamee Sweep
From Cellar to Roof Damage
About 150,000.
Philadelphia, Deo 6. The Public Led
ger building at the corner of Sixth and
Chestnnt streets was badly gutted this
evening by fire and water. The damage by
fire was confined almost entirely to the
composing room, situated on tbe top floor.
but a torrent of water pured down through
the building, flooding every floor.
The building 1b 88 front on Chestnnt
street and 233 feet deep on Sixth street
and is a five-story brownstone with
mansard roof. About 5:45 this evening
one of the clerks in the business office
detected the odor of smoke. One part of
the callar was nsed by workmen to store
toois engaged on tne bnudlng and was
filled with rubbish. The firemen turned
in the alarm and began to fight
the flames. The rubbish fed
the flames and the fire swept
through to the baok and burst out
into alight well in the center of the build
ing. The flames sprang up this chimney
and bnrst into the composing room on the
fifth floor tbrongh the windows. The few
compositors at work had already escaped
to the street. Meanwhile a dozen steamers
and hose carts and trucks were arriv
ing at the scene. On the floor
beneath the composing room the rooms of
the city department were situated. City
Editor McWade, who was making out
assignments, beating snouts of fire, pnt in
ma pocKSts tne copy turned in bv report
ers during the day and also obituaries of
men of local prominence and hastened to
tne street. As tne fire gained head
way everyone aronnd the estab
lishment, volunteers from other
newspapers and the police began
to carry perishable articles out of the
burning structure. The files were all
saved and many rare and costly artioles in
Mr. Ubllds' omoe were carried out. A
dozen streams of water were turned on
the fire in the cellar and the flames were
soon extinguished. The flames in the com
posing room, however, created great bavoo
nd at 7 o'clock the fire burst through the
roat and snot up in a great column.
At about this time Mr. Childs and his
friend, Anthony J. Drexel, arrived. Mr,
umios watoned ms building go up In
flames. He told his employes what to do
in the way of providing for publishing
paper to-morrow. Engine after en
gine arrived and a deluee of water
began to fall upon the roof. For
tunately the wind was light and the
flames did not ppread very rapidly. A
high cornice on the Sixth street front acted
as a wall to prevent the flames spreading
along tne root to tne sontn, and on the
west tbe Bolid wall of the Land TruBt
building obstructed the flames. The fire
men got the flames under control by 7:30,
and all danger of the total destruction of
the building had passed. Torrents of
water, however, had poured through the
building and the interior was flooded. The
water ran down through every floor into
the presB room, and ten inches of water
rose abont the presses, which had been
thoroughly wetted by the dripping from
above. While the fire was still burning
and the water ponring throush the
building Mr. Drexel made his way
to tne nftn floor. When he came
ont he announced that but little damage
had been done in the rear. The firemen
were spurred to greater efforts by the an
nouncement that Mr. Childa intended to
distribute $5,000 among them for pre
venting the total destruction of his
building. The greatest destruction by
fire was done to the composing room,
which was completely burned ont, and the
roof went with it. The local department
beneath also suffered from the fire, but the
greatest damage was by water. The third
floor was taken up with the editor
ial rooms and the second floor was
occupied by Benjamin F. Teller & Broth
ers, real estate brokers. Tbe ground floor
front was occupied by the business office
and Mr. Child's paivate office. The hand
some business office suffered badly from
water. The rear portion of the build
ing on Sixth street, occupied princi
pally by lawers was only damaged by
water. The stores next to the
office were badly damaged by fire and
water. Becently Mr. Childs had made
extensive alterations and repairs to the
building. While the fire was still burn-
ng the city department was removed to
the board of trade room in the Drexel
building and the reporters turned in copy as
usual. With the exception of presses the
Ledger has a complete newspaper plant at
415 Locust street, and the compositors are
setting type there. Mr. Childs accepted
the offer of William M. Singerly to print
his paper from the Record's presses. The
business department is operating to-nlgat
in the Drexel building. The cause of fire
is unknown.
Joel Cook, business manager, said to
night that the Ledger's loss was about
$150,000 on building and $50,000 on the
contents. The loss of tenants is estimated
at $50,000. The perfecting presses, engines
and other machinery ia the cellar aie
valued at $250,000, and their only damage
is by water, $25,000 being an outside esti
mate of loss. The insurance on building
is $160,000; on contents, $SO,000.
JAY GOULD' BURIAL.
Only tbe Family and a Few Friends

Willi ambbridgk, N. Y., Dec. 6. At
12:10 o'clock the solemn toll of the bell at

then as soon as tne lamily and Immediate
relatives had grouped themselves within
the tent shelters Chancellor MoCracken
tepped to the head of the casket and all
heads being bared be read the commital
service of the Episcopal chnrch. At the
words, "dost to dost, ashes to ashes,"
Undertaker Main sprinkled a handful of
earth npon the casket. The service was
conolnded with a simple invocation for
DlviDe strength for the afflicted ones."
The simple service over the undertaker's
assistants hermetically sealed the lead
oasket, and then, after the oaken oover
had been Becureiy fastened, the remains
were carried into the mausoleum by four
of the undertaker's stalwart assistants.
The case was rolled into the crypt just op
posite to Mr. Uonld's wife, and tben the
family entered. Chancellor MoCracken
leading the way. Aa-they grouped around
the month of the crypt no word was ut

Pall River Advances Its rials to
Have tbe Case Ceadaeted Tker,
Mir. Moras Retaraa to Iowa.
Fall River, Mass., Deo. 6. Specula
tions in the Borden cases have Increased
to day and it waa more generally talked of
than the oity eleotion. Regarding the
place of trial the Fall River News says to
night: "On the ground of economy, hotel
ana oonrt oonvenlenoe ana tbe accommo
dation "of a msjority of all interested in
the ease Fall River haa the strongest claim
to have the trial condnoted here. To say
that the sentiment of this community would
be prejudicial to an impartial trial la non
sense. The trial onsht to take place In this
city. The defense has already intimated
tbat It prefers that the trial should be held
here, and quotes the broad laws of the
constitution to show that it ahonld take
place aa soon as possible and as near the
place of commission as convenient. The
dress whioh is alleged to have been burned
ia believed by defendant's friends to have
become, through newspaper reports, of
more than warrantable importance in estab
lishing the guilt of the prisoner. The evi
dence given before the grand jury, they
say, waa necessarily tinged with a govern
mental flavor, bnt it mnst be remembered
that the defenoe has not vet been sub
mitted, nor were their many strong points
brought ont to the best advantage; besides
much of the testimony given by govern
ment witnesses oan be contradicted br
witnesses yet to be called."
The News says further: "Mr. John V,
Morse intends to leave for his home in
Iowa to-night, where neglected business
interests demand his attention. He goes
witn the foil consent of his bondsmen
and will be within call whenever his pres
ence is desired."
