POLYGAMY AND KU-KLUXISM
i
TEE WASHINGTON TREATY
Washington, Dec, 4. —The following
is the president’s messnge delivered to
Congress to-day, at noon .
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In addressing my third annual message to
the law making branch of the Government, it
is gratifying to be able to state that during
the past year success baa generally attended
the efforts to execute all the laws found upon
the statute books. The policy nas been not
to enquire into the wisdom of laws already
enacted, but to learn their special intent and
enforce them tccordingly.
The xiast year has, under a wise Providence,
been one of general prosperity to the nation. I
It has, hovever, been attended with more than
the usual chastisemc n s in loss of life and
propertyby storm and fire. These disasters
have served to call fortn the best elements of
humar nature incur country, and to develop a
friendship for us on the part of foreign na
tions, which goes far towards alleviating the
distress occasioned by the calamities. The be
nevolent who have so generously shared their
means with the victims of these misfortunes
will reap their reward in the consciousness of
Laving performed a noble act, and in receiving
the grateful thanks of the moo, women and
children whose sufferings they have relieved. ;
Foreign Relations.
The relations of the United States with for
eign powers continue to be friendly. The year
has been in eventful one in witnessing two
great nations, speaking one language, and
of one line ago, settling, by oeaceful arbitration,
disputes of long standing, and liable at any
time to bring these nations into bloodshed r all
a state of conflict
An example has thus been set which, if suc
cessful in its final issue, may be followed by
other civilized nations, and be the final means
of returning to productive industry millions
of men maintained to settle the disputes of
nations by the bayonet and broad-sword.
The Washington Treaty.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty al
luded to, which has been concluded since the
adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic
Majesty, and a copy of the protocols of the
conferences of the Commissioners by who&a ic
was negotiated.
This treaty provides methods for adjusting
the questions pending between the two na
tions. Various questions are to be adjusted
by arbitration. I recommend to Congress, at
an early day, to make the necessary provi
sions for the tribunal at Geneva, and for the
several commissioners on the part of the
United States called for by the treaty. His
Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the
Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty the
Emperor of Brazil, have each consented, on
the joint request of the two powers, to name
an arbitrator for the tribunal at Geneva.
I have caused my thanks to be suitably ex
pressed for the readiness with which the joint
request has been complied with by the ap
pointment of gentlemen of eminence and
learning to those important positions. His
Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been
pleased to comply with the joint request of
the two governments, and has consented to
act as the arbitrator of the disputed Costar
boundary between the United States and
Great Britain.
The controlling parties in the treaty have
undertaken to regard as settled, between them
selves, certain principles of public law for
which the United States have contended from
the commencement of their history. They
have also agreed to bring these principles to
the knowledge of other martime powers and
to invite them to accede to them. Negotia
tions are going on as to the form of the note
by which the invitation is to be extended to
the powers.
I recommend the legislation necessary on
the part of the United States to bring into
operation the articles in the treaty relating to
the fisheries, and to the other matters touch
ing the relations of the United States towards
the British American possessions, to become
operative as soon as the proper legislation
shall he had on the part of Great Britain and
its possessions. It is much to he desired that
this legislation may become co-operative be
fore the fishermen of the United States begin
to make their arrangements for the coming
season.
I have addressed a commnication. of which
a copy is herewith transmitted, to the govern
ors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Indiana,
Michigan. Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon
tee governors of those states, respectively, the
necessity of activity on their part to carry into
effect the object of the article of the treaty,
which contemplates the use of the canals on
either side, connected with the navigation of
the lakes and rivers, forming the boundary,
in terms of equity, by the inhabitants of both
countries; and it is hoped that the importance
of the object, and the benefits iu flow there
from, will secure the speedy approval of the
legislatures of the states concerned.
Tile Northwestern Boundary.
I renew the recommendation for an appro
priation for determining the true position of
the 48th parallel of latitude, where it forms
the boundary between the United States and
■ the British North American possessions, be
i t ween the Lake of the Woods and the summit
■of the Kocky Mountains. The early action of
! Congress on the recommendation named,
i would put in the power of the War Depart-
I ment to place a force in the field during the
! next summer.
Protection of Germans iu Paris.
The resumption of diplomatic relations be
tween France and Germany have enabled me
to give directions for the withdrawal of the
protection afforded to Germans in France by
the diplomatic and consular representatives of
the United States in that country. It is just '
to add that the delicate duty of this protec ion
has beeu performed by the minister and con
sulate in Paris, and the various consuls in
France, under the supervision of the
latter, with great kindness as well
as with prudence and tact. Then- course has
received the commendation of the German
government, and has wounded no suscepti
bility of the French. The government of the
Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a
friendly feeling toward the United States, and
a desire to harmonize with the moderate and
just policy which this government maintains
in its relation* with tho Asiatic powers,as well
as w ith the South American Republic. I have
given assurance that the friendly feelings of
that government are fully shared by the
i United States.
Slelations wills Austria.
The ratification of the consular and natur
alization counectionwith the Austro- Hungarian
Empire has been changed.
Italian Unity,
t have been officially informed of the annex-
I ation of the States of the Church to the King
; dom of Italy, and the removal of the capital
jof that kingdom* to Rome. In conformation
with the established policy of the United
| States 1 have recognized this change.
Treaty of Commerce with Italy.
Tho ratifications of the new treaty of com
merce between the United States'and Italy
have been exchanged. Tho two powers have
agreed in then- treaty that property at sea
shall be exempt from capture in case of war
between the two powers. The United States
have spared uo opportunity of incorporating
this rule into the obligations of nations.
American Claims Against Spain.
The Forty-first Congress, at its second ses
sion, made an appropriation for the organiza
tion of a mixed commission for adjudicating
upon the claims of citizens of the United
States against Spain, growing out of the in
surrection m Cuba. That commission has
since been organized. I transmit a copv of
the correspondence relating to its formation
..
and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that
this commission will afford the claimants s>
complete remedy for their injuries.
Jt has_ been made the agreeable duty of the
United states to preside over a conference at
Washington between the plenipotentiary of
Spain and the allied South American republics,
which has resulted in au armistice, with the
reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.
Relations with Russia.
The ultimate friendly relations which have
so long existed between the United States and
Russia continues undisturbed. The visit of
the tliird son of the Emperor is a proof that
there is no desire on the part of his govern
ment to diminish the cordiality of those rela
tions The hospitable reception which has
been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that
on our side ve share the wishes of" that gov
ernment.
The inexcusable course of the Russian Min
ister at Washington rendered it necessary to
ask his recall, and to decline longer to receive
that functionary as a diplomatic representa
tive. It was impossible; with a just regard fer
tile dignity of the country to permit Mr. Cac
acazy tojeoutinue to hold interviews with this
government after bis abuse of government
officers,and during his persistent interference,
through various means, with the relations be
tween the United States and other powers. In
accordance with my wishes, *our gov
ernment has been relieved of further
intercourse with M. Cataozy and the man
agement of the affairs of the imperial legation
Las passed into the hands or a gentleman en
tirely unobjectionable
Relations with Japan.
With Japan we continue to maintain inti
mate relations. The cabinet of the Mikadahas,
since the close of the last session of Congress,
selected citizens of the United States to serve
in offices of imuortant depart;; ents of the
government.
I have reason to think that this selection is
due to an appreciation of the disinterested
ness of the policy which the United States
I have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire
i to continue to main tain! this disinterested and
just policy -.nth China as well as Japan.
TJc tovcan Troubles.
The correspondence transmitted herewith
shows that there is no disposition on the part
of this government to swerve from its estab
j lished course, prompted by a desire to put an
end to the barbarous treatment of our a hip
wrecked sailors on the Corean coast .
I instructed our Minister at Pekin to en
deavor to conclude a convention with Corea,
for securing the safety aud humane treat
ment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was
! instructed to accompany him.
! with a sufficient force to protect him iu case
of need. A small surveying party, sent out on
5 reaching the eoaat, was treacherously attacked
at i disadvantage Ample opportunity was
gi' an for explanation aud apology for the
insult, and neither came. A force was then
.landed, and after an arduous march over
a rugged and difficult country, the
forts from which the outrage had been
committed, were gallantly assaulted and were
destroyed. Having thus punished the crim
inals and vindicated the honor of the dag. the
expedition returned, finding it impracticable
, under the circumstances to constitute the
desired convention.
I respectfully offer the correspondence re
lating thereto therewith submitted, and leave
the subject for such action as Con
gress may see tit to take.
Relations witi* .Mexico and Soutli
America.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed
the very objectionable law establishing' what
is known as the Frozen Zone, the frontier of
the United States. It is hoped that this may
yet be done, also that more stringent measures
may be taken by that republic for restraining
lawless persons on the frontier. I hope that
Mexico, by its own action, will soon re
lieve the government of the diffi
culties experienced from these causes.
Our relations with the various republics of
Central and South America continue,
with one exception to be cordial and friendly.
I recommend action by Congress regarding "to
the overdue installments under the award of
the Yonezula claim commission of 1866.
The internal dissensions of this government
presem no justification for the absence of ef
fort to meet their solemn treaty obligations.
The ratification of an extradition treaty with
Nicaragua has been exchanged.
Emancipation in Brazil.
It Ls a subject for congratulation that the
great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory
steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our
relations with that empire, always cordial,
trill naturally be more so by this act. It is not
too much to hope that the government of Bra
zil may hereafter find it for its interest, as
well as intrinsically right, to advance toward
entire emancipation more rapidly than the
present act contemplates. Its true prosperity
and greatness as a nation are to bo found in
the elevation and education of its laborers.
Slavery in Spauish Colonies.
It is a subject of regret that the
reforms in this direction, which were volun
tarily promised by the statesmen of Spain,
have not been carried out in its West Indian
colonies. The laws aud regulations for the
apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba and
Porto Rico have left the laborers in bondage
with no hope oi release until their lives be
come a burden to their employers,
Americans Owning Slaves.
I desire to direct your attention to the fact
that the citizens of the United States are
large holders, in foreign lands, of this species
'of property, forbidden by the fundamental
law of their alleged country. I recommend
to Congress to provide, by stringent legisla
tion, a suitable remedy against the holding,
owning or dealing in slaves, or being interest
ed in slave property on foreign lands, either
as owners, hirers, or mortgagers of the
United States.
Cuba.
It ia to be regretted that the disturbance in
the island of Cuba continues to be a source
of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence
of a protracted struggle in such close prox
imity to our own country, without apparent
prospect of an early termination, cannot be
other than an object of concern to a people
wiio, while abstaining from interference in the
affairs of other powers, naturally desire to
see every country in the undisturbed euioy
ment of liberty and the blessings of free insti
tutions.
Our naval commanders in Cuban waters
have been instructed, in case it should become
necessary, to spare no effort to protect the
lives and property of bona tide American citi
zens and to maintain the dignity of the flag.
It is hoped that all pending questions with
Spain, growing out of the affairs in Cuba, may
be adjusted in the spirit of peace and concord
which has hitherto guided the two powers in
their treatment of such questions.
Diplomatic lieiatioiis with. China and
Japan.
To give importance and to add to the efli
ciency of our diplomatic relations with Japan
and China, and to further in retaining the
good opinion of those people and to secure to
the United States its share of the commerce
destined to flow between these nations and the
balance of the commercial world, I earnestly
recommend that an appropriation be made to
support, at least, four American youths
in each of these countries to severe
in the official family of our minister there.
Our representative would then be placed on
an equality with the representatives of Great
Lni 1 am, and several other powers. Vl now
; situated, our representatives in China and
Japan have to depend for interpreters and
tianslators, upon the natives of these coun
i tries ’ who know our language imperfectly, or
proeme lor 4 he occasion the services of em
i proves of foreign business houses, or the in
terpreters to other foreign ministers.
Facilie Steamship Tunes.
I would also recommend libera] measures
for the pur-pose of parting tho American line
or steamers now plying between San Fran
cisco and Japan and China, and the Austral
ian lure, at most our only remaining lines of
ocean steamers, and of increasing their ser
vice.
The Tariff on Taxes.
I recommend that all taxes from internal
sources be abolished, except those on spiritu
ous, vinous and malt liquors, aud tobacco in
its various forms, from stamps. In read
justing the tariff. I suggest that a careful es
timate be made or the amount of surplus rev
enue collected, under the present laws, after
providing for the current expenses of the
government, the internal account, aud a sink
ing fund; and, that this surplus be reduced
in such manner as to afford the greatest reve
nue.
There are many articles not produced at home
suck :.s medicines and compounded essences,
from which hut little revenue is derived, but
which enter into general use. Such articles I
recommend to be placed on the free lists.
’ Should further reduction prove advisable, I
would then recommend that it be made up on
1 articles which can bear it without disturbing
WATERTOWN, WIS., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1871.
Home productions, or reducing the wages of
American labor.
I have not entered into figures, because to
do so would be to repeat all that is laid before
you in the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury. The present laws for colleetin;
revenues pay collectors too small salaries, but
provide for shares in all seizures, which, at
principal ports of entry particularly raise the
compensation of these officials to a large sum.
It has always seemed to me as if this' system
must at times work perniciously,
It holds out an inducement to dishonest men,
should such get possesion of these offices, to
be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered’ to
enable them finally to make large seizures.
Your attention is respectfully invited to this
subejct.
Tile National Debt.
The national debt has been reduced to the
extent of $86,057,126.80 during the year, and
by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower
rate of interest, tbe interest of the public
debt has been so far diminished that now the
sum to bo raised for interest account is nearly
817,000,000 less than on the Ist of March
1869.
It was highly desirable that this rapid diminu
tion should take place, both to strengthen the
credit of the country and convince its citizens
of their entire ability to meet every dollar
of liability without bankruptcy; but
in view of the accomplishment
of these desirable ends, of the rapid develop
ment of the reso -irces of the country, and its
increasing ability to meet the large demands,
and the amount already paid, it is not desira
ble that the present resources of the country
should continue to be taxed in order to con
tinue this lapid payment. I therefore recom
mend the modification of both tariff and inter
nal tax laws.
Gold and the Cuixency.
Continued fluctuation in the value of gold,
compared with the national currency, has a
most damaging effect upon the increase and
development of the country, in keeping up
prices of all the articles necessary im every
day life; it fosters a spirit of gambling preju
dicial alike to national morals and to national
finances. If the question can be met as to
how to get a fixed value to om - currency, that
value constantly and uniformly approaching
par with specie, a very desirable object will
be gained.
Tlie Army.
Fox - the operations of the army in the past
year, the expense of maintaining, estimates for
the ensuing year, and for continuing sea
coast and other improvements conducted un
der supervision of the War Department I refer
you to the accompanying report of the Secre
tary of War.
I call yonr attention to the provisions of the
act of Congress, approved March 2d, 1869,
which discontinues promotions in staff corps
of the army until provided for by lav/. I
recommend that the number of officers in oach
grade of staff corps be fixed, and that when
ever the number in any one grade falls below
tbe number so fixed, that the vacancy may be
filled by promotion from the grade below.
I also recommend that when the office of
chief of corps becomes Vacant, the place may
be filled by a selection from the corps in which
the vacancy exists. The report of the Secre
tary of the Navy shows improvement in the
navy, and efficiency of the naval force,without
material increase in expense of supporting it.
This is due to the policy which has been
adopted and is being extended as fast
as our material will admit of using smaller
vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By
these meaxrs we have been enabled
to occupy at once a larger ex
tent of cruising ground, to visit more
frequently the posts where the presence of
our flag is desirable and generally to discharge j
more efficiently tire appropriate duties of the
navy in time of peace without exceeding the
number of men or tbe expenditures authorized
by law.
Dining the past year, the navy has, in ad- ,
dition to its regular service, supplied ihomen i
and officers and the vessels of tho coast sur
vey, and has completed the surveys authoriz
ed by Congress of rhe Isthmus of Darien and
Tehanutepec; and under like authority has
sent out an expedition completely furnished
and equipped to explore the unkuown ocean
of the North.
The suggestions of the report as to the no
cessity for increasing and improving the ma
terial of the navy, and the plan recommended
for reducing the personnel of the service to a
peace standing by the gradual abolition of cer
tain grades of officers and reduction of others,
and the employment of some in the service of
the commercial marine, are well considered,
and deserve the attention of Congress.
I also recommend that all promotions in the
navy above the rank of captain be by selection
instead of by senority. This course will se
cure in the higher grades greater efficiency
and hold out an incentive to yonr officers to
improve themselves in tho knowledge of their
profession.
The present cost of maintaining the navy,
and its cost compared with that of preceding
i years, and estimates for the ensuing year, are
contained in the accompanying report of the
i Secretary of the Naw
The Post Office.
The enlarged receipts af the Poet Office De
partment, as shown by the accompanying re
port of the Postmaster General, exhibits a
gratifying Increase in that branch of the pub
lic service. It is the index of the growth of
education and of the prosperity of the peo
ple, two elements highly conducive to the
vigor and stability of republics, with a vast
territory like ours, much of it sparsely popu
lated, but all requiring the services of the mail.
It is not at present to be expected that this
department can be made self-sustaining but a
gradual approach to this end from year to year
is confidently relied on, and the day is not far
distant when the Post Office Department of
the Government will prove a much greater
blessing to the whole people than it is now.
The suggestions of the Postmaster General
for improvements in the department presided
over by him are earnestly recommended to
your especial attention, especially the docu
ments favorable to the consideration of a plan
for uniting the telegraph system of the United
States with the postal system.
It is believed that by such a course the cost
of telegraphing could be much reduced, and
the service as well, if not better, rendered.
It would secure the further advantage by ex
tending the telegraph through portions of the
country where private enterprise will not con
struct it.
Commerce, trade,and above all the efforts to
bring a people, widely separated, into a com
munity of interests, are always benefitted by
a rapid communication; and education, the
grand ground-work of Republican institutions,
is encouraged by increasing these facilities, to
gether with speedy news from all parts of the
country.
The desire to reap the benefit of such im
provements will stimulate education. I refer
you to the report of the Postmaster General
for full details of the operations of last year,
and for comparative statements of results with
former years.
Tlio Public Landi-.
I renew my recommendations that the pub
lic lands be regarded as a heritage to our
children, to be disposed of only as required
for occupation and to actual settlers. Those
already granted have been, in great part, dis
posed of in such a way as to secure access to
the balance by the hardy settler who may
wish to avail himself of them; but caution
should he exercised even in attaining so de
sirable an object. Educational interests may
well be served by the grant of the proceeds of
the sale of public lands to settlers.
Educational.
Ido not wish to be understood as recoin -
mending in the least degree a curtailment of
what is being done by the general government
for the wwwuegement of education. The re
port of the Secretary of tho Interior, submit
ted with this, will give you information, col
lected and prepared for publication, in regard
to the census taken during the yeai 1870, the
operations of the Bureau of Education for tho
year, the Patent Oftice, the Pension Office, thi
Laud Office and Indian Bureau.
Agriculture.
The report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture gives the operations of his department
for the year. As agriculture is the ground
work of our prosperity, too much importance
cannot be attached towards labor; and his de
partment is in the bauds of an able head,with
able assistants, all jealously devoted to
introducing into the agricultural productions
of the nation all tho useful products, adapted
to the various climates and soils of our vast
territory, and to the giving of all useful infor
mation.as to the best method for tho cultiva
tion of plants
Quietly but surely the agricultural
bureau is working a great Nation
al good, and il liberally supported the more
wudely its influence will be extended, aud tho
less dependant we shall be upon the products
of foreign countries.

•■"olitital Disabilities.
More than six years having elapsed since
111.- las! hostile guu was fired between the en
emies then arrayed against each other, one
for the perpetuation, the other for the demol
ition of tne Union, it may well be considered
whether it is not now time that the disabilities
imposed by the 14th amendment, should
be removed. It does not exclude the
ballot, but only requires the disability to hold
office of certain classes. When the purity of
the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to

it may no said that the former violated an

taken this oath it cannot be doubted they

judgment of conquerors, bo excluded from

for your careful consideration. The condition
of the scut horn states is unhappy, not such as
all true patriotic citizens would like to see;
social ostracism lor opinions sake, personal
violence and threats towards persons en
tertaining political views opposed to those en
tertained by the majority of the citizens, pre
vents immigration, and the flow of much need
ed capital into the states lately in rebellion.
ii will ho a happy condition of country
when the old citizens of these States shall
take an interest in public affairs, promulgate

representing their views, permit the freedom

Tnc District of Columbia.
under the provisions of the act of Congress
approved February 21st. 1871, a territorial
government was organized in the District of
Columbia. Its results have thus far
fully realized the expectations of i:s advo
cate.- Under the direction of the territorial
office "s a system of improvements has been
inaugurated, by means of which, Washington
is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the Na
tion'- Capitol, the citizens of the District hav
ing voluntarily taxed themselves to a large
amount, lor the purpose of contributing to
tho advancement of the coat of government.
1 recommend liberal appropriations on the
part of Congress in order that the government
may boar its just share of the expense of car
ijing out various system of improvements.
Ho '.a’aiueut Buildings Chicago,
IV the great fire in Chicago the most im
portant of the government buildings in that
city wore consumed. Those burned had al
icad 0-', come inadequate to tbe wants of the
go >. c! irai 'it m that growing city, and looking
to tbe near future were totally inadequate. I
recommend, therefore, that an appropriation
be made immediately to purchase
the remainder of the entire square
on which the burned building stood, provided
it can be purchase i at a fair valuation, and
provided the legislature of Illinois will pass a
law authorizing its occupation for govern
ment purposes, and also make an appropiia
iiot of as much money as can be properly ex
pended towards the erection of new buildings
during this fiscal year.
Immigration.
The number of immigrants, ig
norant ol our laws and habits, and
coming into our country .unually, has
become great. and the impositions
practiced upon them so numerous and flagrant
that I suggest congressional action for their
protection. It seems to me the affair is a sub
ject ol legislation by Congress. I cannot now
state as fully as I desire the nature of the
complaints hy emigrants of tho treatment
■.-Ave, bat will endeavor to do so dur
ing the session of Congress, particularly if the
subject should receive your attention.
The Ivu-iiluv Law.
There has been imposed upon the executive
branch of the government the execution of
'he act of Congress, approved April 20th, 1871,
and commonly known as the Ku-Klux law.
jo a portion of the state of South Carolina
the necessity of the coarse pursued will be
demonstrated by the report of the commission
to investigate southern outiages. Tjuder the
provisions of the above act I issued
a proclamation calling the attention
of the people of the United States to
the same,and declaring my reluctance to exer
cise any of the extraordinary powers thereby
conferred upon me, except In case of im
perative necessity, but making known my
purpose to exercise such powers whenever
it should become necessary to do so for the
purpose of securing to all citizens of the Uni
ted States the peaceful enjoyment of the
lights guaranteed to them by the constitution
and the laws.
Alter the passage of this law, information
was received from time to time that combina
tions of the character leferredtoin this law ex
isted and were powerful in many parts of the
southern states, particularly in certain coun
ties in the state of South Carolina,
Careful investigation was made, and it was as
srtaiued that in nine counties of that state
such combinations were active and powerful,
embracing a sufficient portion of citizens to
control the local authority, and having, among
other things,the object of depriving the eman
cipated class of the substantial benefits of
freedom and of the privilege of the free polit
ical action oi those citizens who did not sym
pathize with their views.
Among their operations were frequent semirings
and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated
at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost
all cases being citizens of different political senti
ments Irom their own. or free persons who had
shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other
citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well dis
posed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless vio
lence.
Thereupon on the 13th of Oct. 1871, a proclamation
was issued in terms of the law, calling upon the
members of the combinations to disperse within tivo
bays, and to deliver to the Marshal or military of the
United States, ail their arms, ammunitions, uni
forms, disguises, and other means and implements
uied by them for carrying out their unlawful pur
poses.
lids warning not having been heeded, on the
I’ilh ot October another proclamation was issued
suspending the privileges of the writ of habeas
corpus in nine counties in that state. Direction was
given i bat within the counties so designated persons
supposed, upon credible information, to bo mem
bers oi such unlawful combinations, should be ar
rested by the military forces of the United States
and delivered to the Marshal, to bo dealt with ac
cording to law.
Ju two ol the said counties—York and Spartans
burg—many arrests have beeu made. At last ac
count , iho number of persons thus arrested was
one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred,
v.'hoso criminality was ascertained to be of an infe
rior degree, wore released for the present. These
have generally made confessions of their guilt.
Groat caution has boon exercised in making arrests.
Notwithstanding the largo number, it is believed
t hat no innocent person is now in custody.
Ihe prisoners will bo held for regular trial in the
judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon as
it appeared that the authorities of the United States
were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the
Jaw, many persons absconded, and there is good
ground for supposing that all such persons have
violated the law. A full report of what has been
done under this law will be submitted to Congress
by the Attorney General.
TUe Mormons a ml Polygamy.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbar
ism, repugnant to civilization, decency, and to the
laws of the United States. Territorial officers, how.
ever, have been found, who are willing to
perform their duty in a spirit of equity, and
with due sense of sustaining the modesty of the law.
Neither polygamy nor any other violation of the
Statutes will bo permitted within the territory of the
if *i j •' * 8 with the religion of these
sell-styled saints that we an' now dealing, but their
practices. They will bo protected in the worship of
cod according to the dictates if their consciences,
but they will not be permitted to violate laws under
the cloak of religion.
I t may be advisable for Congress to consider what,
in tie execution of laws against polygamy, is to be
the status of the plural wives and their offsprings.
Lho propriety of Congress passing an enabling act
authorizing the territorial legislature of Utah to
legitimize ail children horn prior to a time Axed in
the act, might he justified by its humanity to these
innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and
not a recommendation.
Tile Indian Policy.
The policy pursued towards the Indians hag re
sulted favorably, so far as can be Judged from the
limited time during which it has been in operation.
Through the exertions of the various societies of
Christians, to whom has been entrusted the execu
tion of the policy, and the board of commissioners
authorized by the law of April 10th, 1869, manv
tribes of Indians have been induced to
settle upon reservations, to cultivate the
soil, and perform productive labor of various
hinds, and to partially accept civilization
They are being cared for in such a way, jt is hoped,
as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of
life to embrace the only opportunity which is left
them to avoid extermination. I recommend liberal
appropriations to carry out the Indian peace poliov,
not only because it is human, Christian-like and
economical, but because it is perfectly right.
I recommend to your favorable consideration, also,
the policy of granting a territorial government to the
Indians, in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas
and Missouri, and south of Kansas. In doing so,
every right guaranteed to the Indians by a treaty
should be secured. Such a course mignt, in time,
be the means of collecting most of the Indians, now
between the Missouri and the Pacific, and south of
the British dominions, into one territory, or one
state. The Secietary of the Interior has treated
upon this subject at length, and I recommend to
you hia suggestions.
The Civil Scrvicc 3
It has been the aim of the administration to en
force honesty and efficiency in all public offices
Every public servant, who has violated the trust
placed in him, has been proceeded against with all
the rigor of the law. If bad men have secured
places it has been the fault of the system established
by law and customs, for making appointments, or
the fault of those who recommend for government
positions persons not sufficiently well-known
to them personally, or who give letters endorsing
the character of office seekers without proper sense
of the grave responsibility which such a course de
volves upon them. A civil service reform which
can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercan- i
tile pursuits, the business man who gives a letter of
recommendation to a friend, to enable him to ob
tain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally
responsible for the integrity of his friend and his
ability to meet his obligations.
A reformatory law which would enforce this prin- i
ciple against all endorsers of persons for public '
places, would ensure great caution in making rec
ommendations. A salutary 7 lesson has been taught
the careless and dishonest servant in the great num
ber of prosecutions and convictions of the last two :
years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change :
which is taking place throughout the country in i
bringing to punishment those who have proved re- !
creaut to the trust confided to them, and in elevat
ing to public office noue but those who possess the
confidence of honest and virtuous men, who will
always be found to comprise the majority of the
community in which they live. In my message to
Congress one year ago, I urgently recommended a
reform in the civil service of the country. In con
formity with that recommendation, Congress, in the
9th section of an act making appropriations for
sundry civil expenses of the Government, and for
other purposes approved March 3d, 1871, gave the
necessary authority to the executive to inaugurate a
ch il service reform, and placed upon him the res
ponsibility of doing so under the authority of
said act. I convened a board of gentlemen,
eminently qualified, for the work to devise
rubs and regulations to effect a reform.
Their labors are not yet complete,but it is believed
that they will succeed in devising a plan which can
be adapted to the great relief of the executive, the
heads of departments, and members of Congress,
which will redound to the interest of the public ser
vice. At all events, the oxj icrimcnts shall have a fair
trial.
Condnsfon.
I have thus hastily summed up the operations ef
the Government during the iast year,and made such
suggestions as occur to me to be proper lor your
consideration. I submit them with a confidence
that your combined action will bo wise, statesman
like, and in the best interests of tho whole country.

Romance in Missouri.
Missouri lias the last reported and
authenticated Enoch Arden ease, and
really it is susceptible of quite a dra
matic version. A one-armed horseman
stops at a blacksmith’s ; smith’s sym
pathies are awakened. Didst lose an
arm in battle, he inquires. Aye, an
swers the one-armed, and worse than
that, my wife, my wife ! She thought
me dead and ( migrated. Your name,
says the smith ? Waldrup, says the
one armed. With a dismal yell smith
drops his nearly-made horseshoe, and
orders Waldrup to follow him into the
house. There sat Mrs. Smith and three
children. She gives one glance at the
stranger, and follows it up by an “in
stantaneous shriek,” and then, as a
matter of course, she faints. This
ends the first scene. She was
Mrs. Waldrup. lu the second
scene the two men are
in the shop talking matters over.
“ What will they do about it ?” Mrs.
Waldrup is invited to decide. “After
a long passion of tears and self-re
proach,” she chooses husband No, 1,
but wants the children also. The
smith “ first raises his head from his
breast, on which it had been permitted
to droop, t ’ then “ eyes her wistfully for
a moment,” then says magnanimously,
“you shall take them, my dear.” Thus
ends the second scene. In the third a
steamboat is leaving the wharf. Wal
drup stands on the deck with a closely
veiled lady and three children; the
blacksmith" bids them farewell with
“great drops rolling down his tawny
cheeks”; captain, crew and passengers
form i semi-circle, and weep also ; the
bell rings, the boat moves off; the
smith goes to his deserted home, and
thus ends the drama.
A Regular Fix*
At Bay City, recently, a cow was the
cause of a most remarkable instance of
devastation a few nights since. Break
ing into the yard of Mr. Lambert’s
dwelling, and putting her head into an
empty barrel in an exploring tour for
any contents it might have, she was un
able* to extricate herself, and soon be
came thoroughly frightened, and began
to rush wildly around. In this condi
tion she forced her way into the wood
shed, and thence into the kitchen, and
thence into the dining-room of the
house, becoming all the while more
furious. From this room she made her
way into the parlor, throwing down and
trampling under foot everything that
came in her w r ay. Mrs. Lambert
aroused her husband, who was asleep,
who arose, but, finding he could do no
thing, went for help. The cow next
rushed into the bed-room where Mrs.
Lambort, with a little baby and one
child occupied a bed, and another lit
tle child was in a crib in front of it.—
The enraged animal mounted the bed,
but help arrived, and not an instant too
soon. The window was raised from the
outside, and Mr. McKenzie attempted
to enter, when the barrel gave him a
blow' which knocked him back against
the fence. The children were at last
secured and passed through the win
dow and Mrs. Lambert soon followed.
The door of the bed-room was then
closed, and the cow was left to herself.
At length she became quiet, and the
barrel fell from her head; the doors
were opened and she walked out. The
furniture, which was very nice is fear
fully demoralized. The plastering was
knocked from the walls, and the panels
of the doors broken out.
A Communist prisoner, who lately
died at Versailles, when about to
breathe his last, confessed that he had
fired at Louis Phillippe in 1832. On
the 19th of November of that year, on
the Quay d’Orsay, an individual dis
charged a pistol at the King, who was
proceeding on horseback, accompanied
by his son and a numerous staff, to
open the legislative session at the Pa
lais Bourbon. Louis Phillippe gal
loped to the point from which the de
tonation had proceeded, and turning
to his escort, said, “Gentlemen, that
shot was intended for me!” No one
was struck by the bullet, but a young
professor in the crowd was arrested as
having been the author of the attempt;
but he was released the next day.

SHOCKING TRAGEDY.
A Maniac Kills Uis Mother ami Com
mils Suicide in West Meriden, Conn.
From the New York Times.
Meriden, Conn., Nov. 21.—This af
ternoon, about half-past three, a run) or
prevailed in Meriden that a young man
named Yetts had murdered his mother
and then committed suicide. No one
believed the rumor, as Yetts was known
to be a quiet, inoffensive fellow, who
would not harm any one. It was gen
erally discredited, - ” but at six o’clock
your correspondent went to the house,
which is situated about a mile and a
half from West Meriden, and
just above Fraryville, and from
evidence gathered from the family
and neighbors it was found that
young Yetts had really murdered his
aged mother, and then committed sui
cide. About two 3 ears ago it appears
he had an attack of the mumps, and it
was deemed necessary that he should
submit to a painful operation, but he
refused. He recovered sufficiently to
attend to his business of peddling
milk, and till within a week things went
on smoothly, when he grew worse, and
was confined to his bed, and had to be
watched. On Thursday night he was
delirious. Yesterday afternoon his
sister Bertie, hearing a noise,went into
his bedroom, and saw him lying bleed
ing on the floor beside his mother, who
was partially concealed by a heap
of bed-clothes. The girl cried out:
“Father, father,” and her father, who
was uncoupling his team at the time,
ran into the house only to find his wife
dying and his son dead. Dr. Gaylord
was sent for and promptly attended.—
He found the woman still breathing,
but unable to articulate. She died
within a minute after his arrival. An
ugly gash upon her throat and one
upon her son’s told the whole story.
Marks of blood upon the walls and the
kitchen-door leading to the bedroom
told of a fearful struggle between the
mother and her maniac son, who had
attacked her with a common butcher
knife.
Young Yetts, who was a German, was
to be married on Thanksgiving
to a Miss Maschmeyer. He was much
attached to the young lady, and she to
him ; but his mother was opposed to
the marriage, for what reason does not
appear An inquest is now being held.
Simon Yetts, the father, is in an agony
of grief painful to witness.
What Animals May Re Trained to Do.
No one person in modern times has
achieved so much success in animal
teaching as S. Bisset, This man was a
humble shoemaker. He was born in
Scotland, in 8721, but he afterwards
removed to London, where he married
a women who brought him some pro
perty ; then turning broker, he accum
ulated money until the year 1759, when
hia attention >- as turned to the train
ing and teaching of animals, birds and
fishes. He was led to this new study,
on reading an account of a remarkable
horse-show at the fair of St. Germains.
Bisset bought a horse and dog, and
succeeded beyond his expectations in
teaching them to perform various feats.
He next purchased two monkeys, which
he taught to dance and tumble on a
rope, and one would hold a candle in
one paw and turn the barrel organ with
the other, while his companion danced.
He next taught three cats to .do many
wonderful things, to sit before music
books, and to squall notes pitched to
different tunes.
He advertised a “Cat’s Opera” in
the Haymarket, and successfully car
ried out his programme, the cats ac
curately fulfilling all their parts. He
pocketed some thousands by these per
formances. He next taught a leveret,
then several species of birds, to spell
the name of any person in company,
and to distinguish the hour of the day
or night. Six turkey-cocks were next
rendered amenable to a country dance,
and, after six months’ teaching, he
trained a turtle to fetch and carry like
a dog, and having chalked the floor and
blackened its claws, he made it trace
out the name of any given person in
the company.
Long Hair.
If long hair be the glory of women,
then there is a glorious young lady in
Boston. She was persuaded the other
day to give a private exhibition of her
beautiful head of long and heavy black
hair. Her heighth is 5 feet 3 inches,
and when she is standing errect her
hair fails to her feet, and trails a quar
ter of a yard on the floor. It is 75 in
ches in length. Here, indeed is a fa
vored young person ! No need has siie
of chignons, nor of braids, nor of fronts
nor of tricopherous compounds; and
Eve, herself, the primal and perfect wo
man nobly planned, had probably no
greater wealth of tangled charms. Dis
carding all moral principle, we are
tempted to lapse into the meanest kind
of pun, aad to pronounce this Boston
beauty the greatest hair ess in America,
and probably one of the best behaved
girls. There! we have done it; so
; hastily asking everybody s pardon for
our verbal misdemeanors, we drop the
subject, that we may sin no more.

other convenient place, which he will
fill about once a month, bringing the
gas from the company’s works in lub

price of the gas will be about the
same as when connected with the
pipes.
About half-past four in the afternoon
