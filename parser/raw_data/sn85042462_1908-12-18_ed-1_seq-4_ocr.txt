ROYAL BANQUET
PRESIDENT-ELECT TAFT was the
principal guest at the dinner of
the Ohio society in New York. To
a. man who intends to smash the trusts,
curb the-predatory rich and carry out
the Roosevelt policies, the position
must have been exceedingly embarrass
ing, for he found himself cheek by Jowl
with representatives of every evil and
every menace to Americanism de
nounced by President Roosevelt fnd
repudiated by the managers of the
Republican party when they were ask
ing the nation to keep the million and
one Republican office holders on the
salary list. At dinner with Mr. Taft
was J. Pierpont Morgan. How could
Sir. Taft bear to hobnob with one whom
it may be his painful duty to denounce
fiercely by and by? Another of his
table companions was George Perkins,
the financial genius who is sueh an apt
pupil of J. Pierpont Morgan that when
ihr grand old man retires to another
world this one will never realize he has
quit operating, for George Doubleyou
Perkins will go marching on. Mr. Taft
must have been harassed by the pres
ence of Mr. Perkins, especially when he,
remembered that his signature on nev
ir.il checks represented tainted cam-
paign contribu (whoa! Back up!)
In his Immediate neighborhood also
pat, blooming and expanding like a
group of great tropical flowers, J. P.
Morgan, jr., of J. P. Morgan & Co.,
Charles Steele of J. P. Morgan & Co.
and J. P. Stotesbery of Drexel, Morgan
& Co. of Philadelphia. Surely Mr. Taft
must have thought there was Too Much
Morgan.
Another fellow guest was E. H. Har
riman. We all know Mr. Taft before
election hated and despised HarrimMi
tam, that he was vehemently opposed
to railroad trickery, that he was the
champion of the public, and made
promises to secure fair and equitable
treatment for the people from the rail
road magnates. Didn't he even go so
far as to denounce them once or twice?
It must have annoyed him terribly to
foe smiling and pleasant to Harrinian.
: Another guest who must have made
lih 1 shudder was E. H. Gary—Steel
Trust Gary, no less. How shocking It
was to Inflict his suggestive presence
on the president-elect! It must havo
c ost Mr. Taft an immense amount of
self-control to refrain from saying unto
him, "Either thou or I from this ban
quet must avaunt! Shakespeare." And
what -• must have been his thoughts
ivhen he was compelled to mingle with
' FOUR ROCKEFELLERS — John D.,
John D- Jr., William and P. A.? How

HERALD CHRISTMAS
MAGNIFICENT was the response
of the produce exchange mem
bers to an appeal to take part
In the entertainment of poor children
at The Herald's Christmas festivity.
This great exchange, which repre
sents a most important part of the
Industrial life of Los Angeles, made a
contribution of most gratifying and
substantial kind. To the members
The Herald expresses Its appreciative
thanks. We would also take this op
portunity of thanking all subscribers
to the Christmas fund and contributors
of donations. Santa Claus wears a
broad smile as he thinks of the suc
cess which Is sure to attend The Her
ald's festival as a result of the gen
erous preparations made for it..
But he Is still worrying over one
matter—and The Herald, as his stew
ard, Is naturally worrying also. We
need shoes, shoes, shoes. We would
like to be able to give comfortable
shoes, to scores, dozens, yes hundreds,
of children of Los Angeles who hardly
know what It Is to have good shoos on
their feet or who run barefoot in days
of chill anfl mud and rain as well as
in days of sunsMne. And we don't
need to tell our readers that even in
the loveliest part of California we
may have chill and mud and rain. We
have more sunshine than any other
community on earth.
Do you realize that the very abund
ance of sunshine makes it all the more
difficult for children who are Insuf
ficiently clothed or badly shod to en
dure weather that Is even in the least
degree unpleasant? With a fall in
the temperature they suffer. With a
plashing downpour of rain, which
compels them to wade through chilly
mud, they are in serious danger of
severe Illness.
A pair of shoes may save a child's
life. Who will give a pair of shoes
to Santa Claus for one of his Los
Angeles children? Who will give a
dozen pairs? We do not care to re
strict or limit the amount of the gift.
We can use SHOES, and the more we
Bet the greater will be the number
o* the barefoot or badly shod children
of Los Angeles who will be made
happy and comfortable for the winter.
TARIFF CONTROVERSY
THE controversy between Carnegie
nnd Schwab on the subject of tar
iff on steel suggests a dispute be
tween the potter and the clay. Schwab
Is not only Carnegie's protege, but Car
negie's pupil. The views he is express
ing today with regard to the tariff were
Mr. Carnegie's views before the founder
of the Pennsylvania steel industry de
cided he would better "buy his soul"
(we quote ills own words) by setting
about the task of administering his fort
tune,
Mr. Carnegie has no doubt puzzled
his Junior partners, because he haa ex
hibited a dual personality. When he
retired from business, his mind became
occupied with various philanthropies.
He talked with new associates. He
spent his time amid new associations.
He found it was a very human world
he lived in, after all, and not a huge
manufacturing industry with the angel
Gabriel at the superintendent's desk
keeping a profit and loss account.
Mr. Carnegie's views on the steel
tariff are those of a sound, sane, mel
lowed citizen of the United States. Mr.
Schwab's views are those of a Grad
grind, who sees national catastrophe in
the diminution of the profits of the
sin] trust. It. is natural that Schwab
should pit the views of the Carnegie
of yesterday against the views of the
Carnegie of today, but it is equally
natural there should be a considerable
divergence of opinion between the
views of a man who was in business
for what is was worth, and constantly
influenced by hard business associates
of the flinty caliber of the wretched
despots who ordered the state troops
to fire on the Homestead strikers and
those of a man who is subject to the
Boftening and refining influences of the
higher civilization, and Is spending- his
time with librarians, professors, scl
enusts, students and bookmen. Schwab
says. "Grab more." Carnegie • says,
"Let go, enough is as good as a feast."
Which is the humanitarian patriot
and the friend o/ Americanism and
American industrial workers?
TRUE BRAVERY
GEORGE FftEETH and the mem
bers of the Venice lifesavins
crew deserve the thanks of the
community for their heroic rescue of
Japanese fishermen caught In a gale.
'For Freeth application will be mado
for a Carnegie medal. He deserves t*.
His work was equal to that of tin;
bravest of the brave. History presents
no instance of heroism that is greater.
Over and over again he dared the waves
and battled with the tempeßt for hu
man lives. And not for the first time
was his heroism demonstrated. This re
markable man within the last two years
is known to have saved or helped to
save approximately fifty lives along
the shore at and near Venice.
Here Is bravery of the kind which
can be talked of without apology. Far
greater than the daring of the battle
field, It concerns Itself with the preser
vation and not with the destruction of
life, indeed, thought of In connection
with such deeds as those of Freeth, the
alleged "heroism" of the battlefield is
relegated to its proper place, We hard
ly like to mention it In the same breath
or sentence with the true bravery Illus
trated by Freeth. Such sacred heroism
iis his should not be known by the same
word as the man-killing "heroism"
of war. Peace hath her victories FAR
MORE renowned than war, and the
greatest peaceful victory for which the
laurel may be proudly worn is thai
which by imperiling a chivalrous and
heroic life preserves the lives of fellow
human beings—in* this case of alien
blood and race.
BRAVE GEORGE FIMOKTH!

LOS ANGELES HERALD:. FRIDA Y MORNING, DECEMBER 18, 1908.
POPULAR CONTEST
FROM June t to October 15, 1909, the
Alaska-Tukon-Paclflc exposition
will be held at Seattle, Wash
ington. It will cost $10,000,000, and
will be tha biggest and most Impor
tant enterprise of its nature which the
western coast has ever attempted.
The California building will be one of
the finest and the California exhibit
one of the best at the exposition.
In order that some of the school
teachers of Southern California may
have an opportunity of visiting the
exposition The Herald has arranged
a tour which will not cost them a
nickel. But as the number of teach
ers who will make the trip Is re
stricted to a dozen The .Herald has
thought best to allow its readers to
perform the delicate task of selecting
the fortunate twelve.
Six of them will be chosen from Los
Angeles county—three from the city
of Los Angeles and three from the
county at large outside of the city, one
from San Bernardino county, one
from Orange county, one from Santa
Barbara county, one from Riverside
county, one from Kern county
and one from Ventura county. The
terms on which a reader Is allowed
to vote are stated explicitly In the
contest announcement published on
another page. The requirements are
not difficult to fullflll, and with a lit
tle generalship It should be easy to
place any teacher well up in the list.
It can be seen from the record that
some of the teachers have friends who
are working for them systematically,
and those who are the beneficiaries of
an organized campaign have secured
a good lead. Still, conditions may be
completely changed before the end of
the contest. It Is wonderful what a
little "git up and git" will acom
pllsh, and we should not be surprised
to see candidates coming to the front
to give the leaders a close run—and
an exciting one—toward the end of the
contest.
We are glad to say the public Is
taking an Interest in this contest,
because indifference would almost In
dicate indifference to the educational
interests of California which are rep
resented by the teachers. The candi
dates in this interesting contest are
representatives of the most useful and
hard-working class in the community,
and one which Is certainly not over
paid. When a teacher draws her sal
ary the public is still Indebted to her.
If you will send in your votes The
Herald will help you to discharge your
share of Indebtedness to the teachers.
A Ncbraskan named Mapes, who
is a lieutenant in the United States
army, is the proud claimant of the
honor of having produced the deadliest
hand-grenade ever invented. Even men
lying down can be reached by it, he
says. The government will reward
him suitably for putting in its posses
sion this new instrument of murder.
It has come to a pretty pass when,
within a few we^ks of Christmas, a
professional dynamiter ia picked out
for reward by the "pacific government
of the United States."
If any one is still laboring under the
delusion that the "Scotch have no
sense of humor," let him read the
accounts of the great banquet of the
St. Andrew society o'f the state of New
York. Two La'uders attended It. One
was George Lauder, Jr., partner In one
of the firms composing the Steel trust.
The other was Harry Lauder, the com
edian. The managers seated the two
Lauders together, and placed beside
them a humble Individual bearing the
far from obscure name of Walter Scott.
Shop early. Now's tire day and now's
the hour for Christmas shopping. If
you shop early, the clerks in the big
stores will enjoy Christmas. If you
don't, many of them will be sick of
Christmas long ere it comes and will
think of it with bitterness and not
with pleasure. And, Mr. or Mme.
Lateshopper, such a calamitous per
version of feeling would be your fault.
You MUST shop early. You will, won't
you? •
President-elect Taft has had a long
consultation en the subject of gclf with
Walter J. Travis, former amateur
golf champion of the United States.
Mr. Taft will golf for five weeks at
Augusta, Ga. "That's golfing some."
Probably he may appoint Travis sec
retary of golf, with a seat in the cab
inet.
Los Angeles is growing so fast that
new buildings are more conveniently
estimated by the mile than by any
other standard. During the municipal
year Just ended twenty-eight miles of
new buildings were erected. They rep
resent a valuation of about $10,000,000.
That's "going some," and growing some.
A Harvard professor condemns foot
ball. But the boys of America will
continue to play football. For a thou
sand years back the ancestors of
many, if not most, of them played
football. It is a fixed racial habit, and
cannot be stopped suddenly.
Experiments in aerial navigation by
night are being made in Los Angeles.
We hope a careful record of all the
Los Angeles aeronautic experiments is
being kept. No doubt the national
government would appreciate such a
record and find it useful.
San Pedro harbor may be made the
torpedo depot for the navy on the
Pacific coast. San Pedro is in every
respect one of the most important har
bors in the United States, and govern
ment Is realizing its strategical value.

LIFE UNDERWRITERS
ELECT NEW OFFICERS
ASSOCIATION STARTS FIFTH
YEAR WITH BANQUET
Reports of Retiring Officials Show
Unusually Successful Twelve
Months —San Francisco
Wants Convention
The Life Underwriters' association of
Los Angeles initiated its fifth year of
work last night by the election of of
ficers and a bnnquet at Hotel Alexan
dria. The following officers will fur

treasurer. The officers and the follow
ing members make up the executive
committee: John N. Russell, Jr., E. L.
Eldredge, A. G. Rathbun, F. N. Coffin
and John W. Whittlngton.
Reports of the retiring officers
showed that the association has closed
an unusually successful year. It suc
ceeded in bringing the national asso
ciation's convention to Los Angeles, an
undertaking which brought tho city u
large amount of advertising. In addi
tion it has accomplished much progress
In behalf of its members, and, in eori-
Junctlon With the San Francisco asso
clatlon, has taken up aggressively
problems of state importance. Some of
these, as the executive committee's re-
port showed, are of considerable value
to policy holders, in whose behalf the
Los Angeles and San Francisco asso
ciations have spent much money dur
ing 190S.
C. S. Montgomery, the new president
of the association, has been its secre
tary for two years, and is thoroughly
familiar with the line of work which
the life underwriters have mapped out
for the forthcoming year. I. J. Muma
and James L. Collins held the same po
sitions last year to which they were
elected last night, and the others have
taken an active part in the progress of
the association.
The retiring president, John W.
Whittlngton, is the only one who has
held the presidency two years. He is
first vice president of the National As
sociation of Life Underwriters, and In
that position is virtually executive of
the national body west of Denver.
While Mr. Whlttington will give part
of liis time to the interests of the Los
Angeles association he Js preparing an
act*r« campaign for the main organi
zation. He will leave in February on
an extended trip, spending six weeks in
organization work for the national as
sociation and visiting San Francisco,
Portland, Seattle, Spokane, Helena,
Butte, Salt Lake, Denver and Albu
querque.
The San Francisco association has
filed an application for the 1912 nation
al convention of the life underwriters,
and Los Angeles is working with the
bay city to bring the meeting to the
roast. Mr. Whttttngton will make San
Francisco's claim a feature of his work
this year.
At the banquet last night Frank G.
Tyrrell, John W. Whlttington and' C.
S. Montgomery were the principal
speakers.

After Overpowering Clergyman's
Son, Beats Her with
• # Revolver
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.—Gaining an
entrance into the rectory of the Ger
man Lutheran Church of the Savior
today, Christian Reiss, whose wife for
nearly a week has been under the pro
tection of the rector, burst into
tlio dining room and without
warning opened lire, according to the
police, upon Mrs. Relss, as she was
sitting at a meal with the clergyman's
family.
He is alleged to have fired five times
at her, hitting her twice, before the
minister's 18-year-old son, William
von Hoti-n, succeeded in throwing him
down and thus stopping his fusillade.
Relss, however, soon overpowered
the boy and returned to the attack
upon his wife, beating her severely
with the butt of his revolver. He then
fired, pursued by young Von Hoten. He
was captured by two firemen.

vote.
Let us say here, ere we incur tne
wrath of those who, like their English
sisters, are. ready—nay, eager—for
martyrdom, that we make no plea for
exclusive men's suffrage, as the case
now stands, says tho San Francisco
Commercial News.
J<< cause much more than one-half
of the rottenness that is now rampant
in the misgovernment of our American
cities is directly attributable to the in
excusable—well nigh criminal—neglect
of the "lords of creation."
So sure are we of the correctness of
this statement that we do not hesitate
to say that should these same individ
uals agree to devote twenty-four hours
a year to their plain, unmistakable
duties as citizens and voters, all polit
ical corruption would become a thing
of the past.
But what do we see —Instead of this
clearly Indicated duty, negligence and
apathy toward? and sometimes down
right acquiescence in political rascal
ity on the part of those whose every
Interest and instinct should revolt at
the mere suggestion of such a thing.
This Is the clear consequence of the
creed of commercialism which has se
cured a seemingly unshakable hold on
the average merchant of the day.
It is always—let tho theorist and the
man who has little else to think seri
ously about undertake the purification
of things; we business men are too
busy; and in reality half the time the
business man is In one way or another

NO LIMITATION TO FORCE
IF MIND CONTROLS MATTER
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12.—[Editor
Herald]: Several of your "Letter Box"
writers allow that mind does control
matter. One says that experiments of
such control have even passed the
laboratory stage. If so-, it must be
ready for every day use and of the
greatest good. If mind does control
matter, then must It not control all the
forces of matter, such as light, heat,
actinism, electricity, magnetism; at
traction, repulsion, adhesion, cohesion
and so forth? If mind controls these
forces, is It not greater tllan &11 thest
forces; In fact, the greatest force in
the universe? Is it not, then, the very
Intelligence of matter? And, if the
intelligence of matter, then Is It not
one with matter, inseparable; in fact,
a characteristic or quality of matter,
even as are the other forces of matter
above mentioned? If mind does con
trol matter, then is not every particle
of matter In the mineral, vegetable and
a«imal kingdoms subject to such con
trol? Once man controlled few of the
natural forces. Now he controlß many.
If mind does control matter, and man
can obtain control of this greatest of
all forces, then for his own comfort,
at least, he will replace the negative
conditions of illness and poverty with
the positive conditions of health and
opulence. In our crude and untried
knowledge of mental forces it may not
be wholly true to say that all the fore
going questions can be answered af
firmatively. However, the following
statement surely cannot be gainsaid.
If it can be shown, In at least one in
stance, and doubtless there are many,
that mind does control matter, then it
is reasonable to assume that with cul
tivation of the mental forces that power
can be increased. And who can assert
its limitations? ASBURY CECIL.
"VOLUNTARIES" WANT LABOR
TO HAVE ALL IT PRODUCES
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 17.—[Editor
Herald]: Charles U. White asked a
good and pertinent question, and be
cause of delay that I am not respon
sible for, the answer to it has not been
published. So Mr. White decided it
could »ot be answered and has so
stated.
His question was: "How do you pro
pose to make It possible for the penni
less and propertyless worker* to co
operate?"
The answer that every "Voluntary,"
as he calls us, would make Is: "Let
every man refuse to work unless he
receives his full share of the product."
And as his share is all he produces it
is all he is entitled to and all we ask,
and we will be satisfied with nothing
iess.
If all who work or co-operate get
their proportionate share of the prod
uct no one Is injured and no one will
object except those who want to live
off others.
If Mr. White thinks this is wrong
let him say why. But let him not be
so unfair as to call C. F. a "Voluntary"
In order to find something with that
label that he can answer.
C. F. is not a "Voluntary." He never
said he was, and no one who knows
anything of the "Voluntary" theory
would mistake him for one. In fact,
the "Voluntaries" have much more in
common with Mr. White than with
C. F.
Mr. White owes the "Voluntaries" an
apology for the unjust things he said
of tliem in his last letter, and I hope
he will make it. C. T. SPRADING.
BELIEVES STORES BHOULD
BE CLOSED AT 10 O'CLOCK
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14.—[Editor
Herald]: Your appeal in behalf of
store clerks for a little easement of
their holiday time burdens is noted
with hopes that it may have its ef
fect.
Those who go to and fro in Los An
geles stores cannot fail of being im
pressed by the superiority of tho peo
ple who wait on them. They are pos
sessed of the patient politeness and af
fability belonging with good breeding
and intelligence. Why should thla class
bo se> sadly, unnecessarily overworked
In the providing of a happy time for
others? Why, by reason of cruel de
mands on them, be shut out from their
rightful, restful share in this happi
ness?
As stated by Tho Herald, many of
them are entirely exhausted by tlie
closing in of Christmas eve.
Could not this be changed, an en
lightened and progressive city like Lou
Angeles taking the initiative? If, in
order to give full chance to shoppers, it
is necessary for stores to keep open
evenings during the Christmas week,
could they not be closed promptly at
10? And why not closed entirely on
Christmas eve, thus giving our faithful
servitors a chance to enter fittingly on
the enjoyment of the Christmas fes
tival?
Much is being done for tho children.
Will not a Christian community shot!*
Christian consideration for these of
larger growth? Respectfully,
M. H. C.
profiting by the very condition he
should soylc in every possible way U
overthrow. So that it is not from nny
undue or unwarrantable 1 enthusiasm,
or oven tolerance of the fashion In
which the average man Is attending to,
or more properly speaking, neglecting,
his political duties, that wo hesltaW
about extending the franchise to wo
man.
For, plainly speaking, wo consider
our American system of suffrage a
dismal failure.
And what Is more, It must be mani
fest to Uie most capuul observer that
unless the civic conscience resumes its
sway, representative institutions are
doomed.
What we, in common with all lib
erty-loving Americans seek above all
things, is some way of elevating the
franchise and making it stand for the
high principles It was designed by the
founders of our government to repre
sent.
Above all things do we wish to get
away from the sort of hysteria that
seems to attend and characterize tho
woman's campaign in London, as we
read about it.
If woman wishes to get away from
the duties of the household, comprising
the vastly more important mission of
providing the moral stimulus for the
community through the fireside Influ
ence, she must give some better reason
than the mere wish to have It so.
We feel very strongly that universal
suffrage has been shown to be the su
preme folly of the age.
We therefore believe firmly In the
restriction of the franchise, rather
than its further extension, and every
election strengthens us in that con
viction.
At any rate, the woman suffragists
of London are furnishing anything but
a good argument for their contention.
WOMAN DECLARES .HER SEX
MUST FACE ACTUAL FACT3
LOS ANGELES, Dec. IB.—[Edlto-
Herald.]: I wish with all .my heart
every woman could be induced to read
and ponder carefully the discussion
going on In your Letter Box on the
subject of woman's employment. It is
true that In this age everything com
bines to keep men from marrying, and
there Is no one so much interested In
this subject as we women. Because,
when marriage fails us as a career,
there is absolutely nothing left for us
except to go into the labor market and
compete on most unequal terms with
men.
I come of the practical Knglish race,
that is not afraid to look a position in
the face, and I like the practical way
in which some of your correspondents
are considering this question. 1 have
no confidence whatever In prayers or
goody-goody measures righting things,
and feel that the only way is to face
facts.
I recogniza the vast difference in sex.
on which seme of your correspondents
Insist and which some of my own sex
seem, to my Immense astonishment, to
ignore. I cannot understand how anv
woman can fail to see that her health
Is, by the nature of things, far mora
precarious than that of man's. Thare
are physical facts In connection with
this that It Is the most foolish prudery
to shut one's eyes to.
I have been forced In this country to
■work hard In a factory, and I knew
every moment I was doing sp that I
was outraging nature. I knew aiv.i
that I was engaged In a hopeless ta.<K
when I tried to hold my own against
men; that at the best I had not equal
strength, and that there were aeounna
rlly times when I should not havj
been required to work «it all. •
I was a healthy woman when I cane
to this country. Today I am an In
valid, and it is because nature ha*
been outraged by my being forced into
a competition that nature never in
tended. With how many other Amer
ican women Is this the case! The b.vt
health of American women Is notorious
the world over and reflects no ereiiit
on thrlr common, sense. AVhat sense
have we If we lack the Instinct at <*>H
preservation, the first law of which la
"Keep your health?"
We women are Interested more than
an* one else in such a change of con
ditions as will mate it poßtilblu for
men to marry and not in trying vainly
to make ourselves like men.

CITES AUTHORITIES TO SHOW
DR. HUMANITAS HIS ERROR
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14.—[Editor
Herald]: Dr. Humanltas says: "To
deny the truth of all we perceive ma
terially is » fine qualification for • a
scientist." There la more truth than
irony in this. Research and Imvsti
gatlon by our greatest authorities In
natural science has led to the conclu
sion that all is mind, because in the
final analysis matter disappears. I
fcito I>odge, Kelvin, Flske, Polncaire,
Huxley and others. "Yours to an
atom'" Is equivalent to saying yours
to nothing. Extremely appropriate in
the connection used.
Bfllfour says in trying to explain
matter It is explained away (and the
process is mental). There arc QO
"partial vacuums," and no one surely
with the temerity or lack of per
spicacity to define "Hertz' Waves
and Electricity" as ' matter, and if
they were, there is no process by
which they could be made to be Spirit,
a3 the doctor suggests. I find he has
been criticising his own misconcep
tions. It would be unreasonable to
expect a man to believe In mathemat
itc who courd not solve Its simplest
problems, or a non-believer In spirit
to recognize Its entity when he *oesn't
know what spirit is. I do not assume
that God, Spirit, Mind (used synono
mously) Is a separate entity, "but
I declare it to be the only entity; that
God is Spirit and Spirit Life, so If
one doesn't deny the existence of life
one doesn't deny the exisitence of
spirit.
The doctor has been looking In the
wrong dtreclton for spirit, and, having
eyes, has seen not. Cast your net be
yond the veil of matter if you want
evidence of spirit and a knowledge of
God, which is life eternal, the same
yesterday, today and forever, and Is
therefore not manifest in evolution.
