WASHINGTON, D. C.-Rlggt House and Ebbltt
House -
The Democrats in the House can put
their tariff and currency bills away un
til a year hence. They will keep.
The Republican newspapers, with so
few exceptions that they cannot be rec
ognized in point of numbers, warmly
indorse the President's message.
The free-trade press in this country
and the manufacturers abroad will not
applaud the President's message. They
do not like United States doctrines.
Again it seems necessary to remark
that it was not the McKinley law, but
the misrepresentation of it, that hurt
the Republicans during the last cam
paign. 1
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury furnishes a very complete ex
hibit of government finances and pre
sents some interesting facts concerning
our foreign trade. '
All earnest Republicans will be grati
fied over the expressed determination of
the Republican Senators to push the
federal election bill. They are in hearty
accord with the President.
In 16S0 a keg- of steel nails cost '6. In
1683 the duty on steel nails was increased,
securing the whole production to this
country, and now a keg of better steel
nails can be purchased for 83-0. " '
ATthi? distance it appears as, if Mr.
Parnell considers himself of more im
portance than the cause of his country.
Other men, both smaller and greater
than he, have made the same mistake.
The Democratic Senators whose, views
of the message were obtained after it
was read appear to be very indignant
because the President's views regarding
pure elections have undergone no change.
Buffalo Bill thinks a blizzard would
bring the Indian Messiah to his senses
and freeze the light out of the dancing
dervishes. Perhaps it was a mistake to
remove the weather bureau from tho
control of the War Department.
The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette
says the President's message is dis
tinctively "a national message," and the
perusal of it "will vividly recall to thou
sands the sounding bugles along other
lines when the hosts moved out to bat
tie and to victory."
If the general press represents the
feelingof the country regarding the pol
icy of Congress toward the Pacific rail
roads under their new management,
there has been a decided change toward
positive efforts to care for the interests
of the government.
The proceedings of tho Farmers' Alli
ance convention, which began in Ocala,
Fla., yesterday, would havo greater in
terest to the publio if it were not evi-
dent that the Democracy has swallowed
tho organization in the South, where it
promised such great things.
Secretary Windom says: "Free trade
can never be successfully established or
perpetuated in any country whose homo
market for its own products exceeds its
aggregate markets abroad." As a state
ment of economic truth this is unanswer
able. Free-traders can gnaw that file a
hundred years without affecting it.
Sevijral months ago, in discussing
the necessity of limiting debate in the
Senate and the failuro of that body to
take such action, the Journal said it
was only a question of time when it
would have to be done. Now the Re
publican caucus of tho Senate has ap
pointed a committee of five to report a
form of rule which it may bo found ex
pedient to pass in order to enable the
majority of tho Senate to reach a vote
after, a fair debate.
Representative Springer, who has
been permitted to write an article for
the Forum on "City Growth and Party
Politics," would have the farmers dis
tress themselves because cities are
gaining in population more rapidly than
the agricultural sections, which is equiv
alent to telling them that the increase of
the number of consumers of their prod
ucts is a thing for them to deplore. If
Mr. Springer were not in sober earnest
in this assertion, ho would get a limited
reputation as a wag.
Next to obituary eulogies in Congress
there is no more tiresome humbug than
tho ostentatious display of flowers on
the desks of re-elected members. These
'floral tributes," as they are called, are
minutely described by the able corre
spondents, and admiring constituencies
are led to suppose that their member
has been received in Washington as a
conquering hero. As a matter of fact,
the flowers sometimes come from tho
government botanical garden, where
every member of Congress is entitled to
certain privileges, and sometimes they
are furnished by lobbyists or claimants
who expect that thrift will follow fawn
ing. If we ever outgrow the veally
stage of our national existence this is
one of the things that will be reformed
altogether.
TWO KIKD3 OFBTATE SHAH SELP.
The adjectives applied by the Demo
cratic press to the President's message
are, weak, tame, flat, uninteresting, in
consequential, etc. As they have to
say something, and cannot be expect
ed to tell the truth, they might as well
adopt that line of comment as any other.
The Democratic idea of strength is
the whoop-la, big Indian style. They
estimate greatness by avoirdupois, and
grade a man's statesmanship by the
size of his neck. It does not- matter
about brains, if ho has the proper girth
around his waist, and the question of
intellect is of little consequence com
pared with that of blubber. Grover
Cleveland fills the Democratic idea
of greatness. If President Harrison had
jumped into the arena with glaring eyes,
brandished a metaphorical tomahawk in
tne air, and jumped rough-shod on to sil
ver coinage, the Democracy would have
said he may be wrong, bnt he is a
great man. If he had devoted a large
part of his message to getting up a scare,
predicting a panic if silver coinage were
not stopped immediately, declaring that
the country was on the road to ruin, and
imputing lack of knowledge, honesty
and patriotism to all who ventured to
differ with him, Democrats would have
gone around whispering that it was a
very able message. If he had gone at
the tariff question shovel-and-tongs
fashion and reeled off a lot of oracular
platitudes in favor of free trade, adapt
ed from Bastiat or paraphrased from
Henry George, Democratic papers would
have screamed with delight. But be
cause ho discusses the entire range of
public affairs and public questions in a
dignified and temperate manner, mak
ing the most important recommenda
tions in moderate language, using argu
ment instead of dogmatism and express
ing conclusions instead of conjectures,
the message is pronounced weak, tame,
flat and uninteresting. According to
-tho Democratic standard it certainly is.
Mr. Parnell's present attitude to
wards the Irish party is' simply one of
defiance. The audacity of his recent
course is inexplicable on any other theory
than that he has determined to maintain
his position as leader of the Irish cause,
regardless of consequences to it or him
self. His conduct towards his late col
leagues in the meeting of Monday was
marked by a degree of arrogance which,
undor the circumstances, is simply amaz
ing. No man with a clean and spotless
record, suffering persecution for right
eousness' sake, hounded by the enemies
of a noble cause and he its only true de
fender, could assume a loftier tone of
injured innocence or more overbearing
manners towards his critics. It is pos
sible that Mr. Parnell may, by this
brazen and bulldozing course, succeed
in putting down the opposition to him
among the Irish members and maintain
ing a nominal leadership of tho Irish
party; but if hedoes'it will be at the ex
pense of his persoual reputation, and
will probably involve the ruin of the
cause he has so long championed. For
what kind, of a leadership will that be
which is retained over the protest of
most of his parliamentary following,
and after insulting many of them in per
son? And what can the Irish cause hope
for under such a leader, after ho has ir
revocably driven away from its support
Mr. Gladstone and the entire body of
English Liberals? Mr. Parnell's future
position, if he succeeds by his present
methods in maintaining it, will simply
make him conspicuous as apolitical fail
ure and cause the world to wonder how
a man so thoroughly imbued with selfish
and impracticable qualities ever could
have been recognized as a leader.
The President says: "There is neither
wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that
the subject of tariil revision shall be opened
before this Ipew Jaw has had a fair trial."
Does not tho President therein set himself
up unthinkingly against the will of tbe
people, who are the real rulers of this coun
try! They said plainly and decidedly a
month ago that there was wisdom and
justice in the suggestion that the subject of
tariff revision should be opened. They
voted overwhelmingly against the new
tariff law. Any one who acknowledges the
supremacy of the people should bow to
their verdict. Chicago Tribune.
As the Tribune has always opposed
the Republican party on tho tariff ques
tion, it is quite natural that it should
endeavor to misrepresent the position of
a Republican President. If the recent
election was a popular verdict against
the McKinley law it was equally a verdict
against every law enacted last. session.
Twice before once in 1874 and once in
1884 the Democrats have had a large
majority in tho House. Wo do not
remember, however, that Republicans
thought it necessary on that account to
abandon their principles. If theTribuno
wants a Democratic President it can help
elect one in 1892, but it should not ask
President Harrison to become a turn
coat. The proposition ot Secretary Win
dom to make tho payments of pensions
at different dates at the several agencies,
so that money will not be accumulated
in the treasury in largo amounts, as is
now necessary when the payments are
made in March, June, September and
December, is a wise one, and Congress
should give it the force of law. The
Secretary proposes that payments be
made on different months at the differ-,
ent agencies, so that the draft upon the
treasury for funds will be nearly similar
in amount month after month, and not
four times a year.
As President Harrison's second annual
message is receiving the general approval
of Republicans, it may not be amiss to
recall what Mr. Blaine said in a speech
delivered at Troy, N. Y a few days be
fore tho election of 1883. After refer
ring to General Harrison's candidacy,
ho said:
As a man, as a soldier, as a Senator, as a
statesman, as a Republican, as a protec
tionist, he tills ti very requirement; ho is tbe
very embodiment of every issue that is to
day before the people on which the Repub
lican party take their position.
The Indian excitement is approaching
a crisis, and indications point very
strongly to hostilities. The Indians seem
to be fully committed on that line and
moving towards an outbreak very fast.
With the warning the government has
had, ample preparations have doubtless
been made, and if hostilities begin it
will be no child's play. The best as--suranco
of peace now would be severe
cold weather.
TnE following dig at Grover Cleve
land is from the Indianapolis Sentinel:
There is probably no public man in the
country so ill informed touching political
economy and the various phase of the rev
enue question as this self-sufficient person,
clothed in a little brief authority, who
assumes to tell the American people that
they do not know what is good for them.
A report from the Alliance conven
tion says that the question of a third
party is engrossing much attention, the
Southern delegates being nearly all op
posed to it, while those from the West,
and particularly from Kansas, are very
zealous in pushing the idea. .

ALLIED ORDERS OF FARIIERS
The Convention at Ocala, Fla., Opens
with President Polk's Annual Addrec:
He Outlines the Political Demands of the Or

Confederate Soldiers Participated.

Jay Gould Talk About a Ticket in 1892.
Ocala, Fla., Dec 2. At 2:30 this , after
noon a publio meeting of the National
Farmers' Alliance was held in the opera
house, an audience of about one thousand
being present President Rogers, of the
Florida Alliance, presided. General Flem
ing welcomed the delegates, and was fol
lowed by Hon. John F. Dunn, State Sen
ator, and a prominent aspirant for the
United States senatorship to succeed Sen
ator Call. President Foulks, of the South
Dakota Alliance, also . made a short ad
dress, in which he predicted victory for the
Alliance at the ballot-box in 1692, a senti
ment which the delegates cheered to the
echo. All the speakers of the afternoon
dwelt forcibly upon the breaking down of
sectional lines, and predicted the general
prevalence within a short time of the ideas
embodied in the Alliance platform adopted
at St. Louis. President Polk was intro
duced by Mr. Rogers, and delivered his an
nual address. After a few congratulatory
sentences, he said:
"Profoundly impressed with the magni
tude of this great revolution for reform, in
volving issues momentous and stupendous
in their character as affecting the present
and future welfare of the people, the pub
lic mind is naturally directed to this meet
ing with anxious interest if not solicitude,
and you cannot be unmindful of the im
portance and responsibility that attach to
your action as representatives coming
from States and localities remote from each
other and differing widely from each other
in their material and physiological charac
teristics, and marked by those social and
political differences which must necessa
rily arise under our form of government.
It is your gracious privilege, as it shall be
your crowning honor, to prove to the world
by your harmonious action and thoroughly
fraternal co-operation that your supreme
purpose is to meet the demands of patriotic
duty in a spirit of equity and justice."
. PRESIDENT POLK'S SUGGESTIONS.
The address congratulated the Alliance
on its achievements since the last meeting,
and .then reviewed the causes of agri
cultural depression. The president de
clared that this depression was an anomaly
to the student of industrial progress.
"Retrogression in -American agriculture,"
he said, "means national decay, and power
ful and promising as is this young giant
Republic, yet its power and glory touch
not the degradation of tho American
f armer." The harm incident to centraliza
tion of the money power and upbuilding of
.monopolies was then pointed out, and both
political parties were condemned lor tore-
ing ana encouraging mis condition, uiiu
reference to extending the order, tho presi
dent urged that additional organizers be
sent at once into Oregon, Washington,
Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Arizona and
other States. Among his recommendations
was one that an organization be formed to
be known as the national legislative coun
cil, composed of the national president and
the presidents of all Stato alliances, their
duty being to look closely after legislative
reforms demanded by the AUiauce, both in
State legislatures and in Congress. He
recommended changes in the constitution
and recited "demands" to be made in the
way of financial, land, election and tax
reforms.
' In his remarks upon the proposed national
legislative council President Polk said: "I
would respectfully suggest a legislative
council, to be composed of your national
president, who shall be ex officio chairman,
and the presidents of all the State alliances
represented in the Supreme Council, and
that this body shall hold its annual meet
iug within sixty days after. the adjourn
ment of the Supreme Council, at such time
and place as may be indicated by the
national president; that it be empowered
and authorized to appoint such legislative
committees as in its judgment may be wise,
and that it be required to transmit to each
.of the States, in printed form, through the
national secretary, for distribution to the
reform press, locturers and membership of
the order, all measures and bills, together
with arguments in their favor, as-they may
decide should be enacted into law." Presi
dent Polk said that an organization of this
kind would wield a moral power which
would enforce the respect of any legis
lative body to , which it might appeal.
loucning upon me political acuou ux uie
Alliance,. President Polk said: "While our
organization is political, it cannot be par
titsan or sectional in its action. In support
of this declaration we proudly point to our
whole past record and to tbe recent popular
election, and particularly to tbe noble and
patriotic bearing of the brotherhood in
Kansas and South Carolina."
In reviewing the record of the Alliance
during the past year, and especially with
reference to the legislation demanded by it,
tbe speaker declared that Congress had
persistently ignored all Alliance proposi
tions, and even suppressed discussion of
them, notably in the case of the measure
known as the sub-treasury bill. . "Con
gress," ho said, "must come nearer to the
people or the people will get nearer to Con
gress." The remainder of the address was
devoted to a discussion of financial reform
and the policy of the Alliance in uprooting
sectionalism. As outlining the future
iinaucial policy of the Alliance, Presi
dent Polk said that it will de
mand the restoration of silver to all
the rights and . qualities of legal
tender which gold possesses; the issue of
government currency direct to the people;
equalization of taxes; prohibition of alien
ownership of lands; ownership and control
of transportation lines by the government;
limit of pnblic revenues to the economio
administration of the government; gradu
ated taxation of incomes and the election
of United States Senators by a direct vote
of the people.
LOVE FEAST AND REBEL YELLS.
At the conclusion of President FolR's ad
dress the Alliance resolved itself into a
sort of "love feast," during which C. A.
Power, an old Union soldier from Indiana,
moved that all ..ex-soldiers in the hall who
indorsed the sentiments expressed in the
speech of President Polk, of South Da
kota, with reference to the burial of sec
tionalism, rise up to be counted. The
motion prevailed, and between forty and"
fifty stood np amid the wildest enthusi
asm. Under the inspiration of this good
feeling an ex-Union soldier from Wiscon
sin . stood up in his seat and called
upon all Union . soldiers present
to give ' three cheers for the
old confederates in the Alliance.
They were given with a wilL Then it was
the confederates1 tarn, and they cheered
the old soldiers of the Union with a volume
and heartiness that raised no doubt as to
the. genuineness of their feeling. The
cheers ended with a wild, old-fashioned
"rebel yell." As its echoes died away one
aged veteran of the Confederacy shouted.
In a voice that rang out clearly through the
hall: "That's the genuine article. Pve
heard it before." The convention then
adjourned until 8 o'clock.
Expressions of dissatisfaction are heard
with reference to the conduct of Dr. Ma
cone in going to Atlanta during the recent
senatorial contest there and taking part in
the tight 'Some members severely criti
cized his espousal of Calhoun's cause, be
cause Calhoun is a railroad attorney and a
representative of what they terra the
monopoly and money power. , This matter
will come up for investigation either to
morrow or Thursday, and is likely to prove
a bomb-shell in the deliberations of the
National Alliance. There is also some dis
satisfaction with the policy pursued by Dr.
Macono in his official capacity as
chairman 'of the national executive
board, and as editor of the National Econo
mist It is charged that Dr. Macono has
Violated the policy of the National Allianco
in his advocacy, through the columns of
the Economist of the Conger lard bill, a
measure opposed by the Alliance generally
as oppressive to the agricultural classes in
the cotton States; in his ovpsition to the
Paddock nurefood bill, a ctrictly Alliance
measure; in his indorsement of Speaker
Reed's rulings; in his espousal both person
ally and through the columns of the Econ
omist of the contests of "Langley and
Feat hers tone for seats in the national
House of Representatives," and, finally, in
his characterizingtariiT reform as the "gal
vanized ghost of sectionalism and disloy
alty." When approached by the Associated
Press representative to-night with refer
ence to those matters, Drl Macone admitted
that he had heard that charges were to be
brought against him for his action in these
particulars, bnt was of the opinion that no
charges would be preferred. "No one," he
said, "would dare bring charges of this
kind against me.- Such a course would re
sult only in the defeat and humiliation of
those bringing them and in the exposure of
their purposes. I am perfectly willing to
have a calcium light turned on all my offi
cial acts and npon my policy, as well. I
court the closest scrutiny ot my record and
my enemies, if i have any, will not, I think,
dare to bring charges of this kind; they are
likely to get hurt if they do." The Econo
mist is the official organ of the National Al
liance, owned by a stock company, but Dr.
Macone was elected editor by tho Alliance
at its last annual meeting. '
NOT CONTROLLED BY JAY GOULD.
President Livingstone, of the Georgia
Alliance, when questioned about the
charges, professed ignorance of any move
ment of this kind, and added: "Macone is a
candidate for re-election; if the National
Alliance does not like his policy, why, it
can elect somebody else in his place. I see
no reason for bringing charges against him.
Furthermore, as far as his advocacy of Cal
houn goes, I can testify that ho did not
take an extreme position in the contest.
He did not lobby for any candidate. I
wish to deny, alo, a report sent out from
Atlanta or Washington, to a St. Louis
newspaper, in which it was charged that
Jay Gould and other so-called monopolists
had got control of the National Economist
and other Alliance newspaper organs, and
that they were to be conducted in the inter
ests of railroad and money magnates. It is
all false, and I can prove it if 1 choose."
It is needless to say that the source of
these charges, if any are to be preferred, is
among, the Southern and Southwestern
members. The defeated wing ot the
Georgia Alliance is said to be active in the
movement against Dr. Macone.
Mr. Tillman, of Tennessee, the statis
tician of the National Alliance, said the
question of forming a new political party,
which would put a presidential ticket in .
the field in 1S92, would probably come up
for discussion at this meetihg, but he pre
dicts that it will be dispooed of by re
ferring it to the different State alliances for
individual action. The advocates of this
step are chiefly in tbe West and Northwest
and the plan proposed comprehends the de

Questions at Issue Between Horsemen.
Chicago, Dec. 2. The board of appeals
of tbe American Trotting Association be
gan its serai-annual session at the Audi
torium to-day. Tbe board overruled tbe
Erotest against Y. D. Scale's entry of his
orse Exeter at the Bloommgton fair this
fall. It was claimed that the entry was
made after the date for closing the entries.
This afternoon a most interesting case came
up for bearing. It embodied the question
whether an association, when giving
guaranteed stakes, is entitled to
the amount paid in by the sub
scribers in excess of the guaranteed
amount, or if such excess belongs to the
winning horses prorata. The case was
that of C. F. Emery against the Central
Illinois Trotting and Pacing-horse Breed
ers' Association, which comprises the cir
cuit of Uloomington, Decatur, Springfield
and Aurora. All of these trotting events
came out with funds in excess of the guar
anteed stakes. At Springfield the amount
in excess was about 000. Tbe board took
the case under advisement and will hold a
consultation in executive session on it

New York, Dec. 2. To-day Mr. and Mrs.
Cyrus W. Field celebrated the fiftieth an
niversary of their marriage. As their list
of visiting acquaintances is a very largo
one, they were obliged to limit the invita
tions outside their family circle to a few
old friends, but even these few numbered
four or five hundred, who thronged the
well-known house on Gramercy Park and
offered the warmest congratulations. There
came a message from England, headed bv
tbe Duke of Argyll and Mr. Gladstone, and
including overy sixty names of men distin
guished in every walk of life a mark of
respect and of personal regard. The mes
sage was one of congratulations upon the
achievement of the first ocean cable, and
bore hearty expressions of good will from
the senders. '

ANOTOER LIVELY MEETING.
More Recriminations Between IrUh Nation
alists, in Which Parnell Took Tart.
London, Dec 2. Pursuant to adjourn
ment the meeting of the Irish members of
tbe House of Commons, to consider the ad
visability of removing Mr. Parnell from
his position as leader of the Nationalist
party, was resumed in a room of the Hons
of Commons at noon to-day. Mr. Parnell
was the first member of the party to ar
rive at the place of meeting. During tho
proceedings the reporters were excluded
from the corridors. After the meeting had
proceeded to business a half hour was oc
cupied in reading telegrams from various
persons in Ireland and the United States,
and the original manifesto sent by cable by
the delegates of the party now in tbe Unit
ed States. The reading of the dispatches
was frequently interrupted by cheering.
Mr. J. O'Kelly asserted that it would bo
the basest ingratitude for the Nationalists
to abandon Mr. Parnell simply because a
number of politicians who had sought an
alliance with the Irish party for their own
advantage now thought fit to abandon the
position Mr. Parnell had taken up, and had
intrigued to encompass the downfall of tha
trusted leader of the Irish nation.
A sharp controversy took place concern
ing tbe cable dispatches which had be .n
sent to the delegates in tbe United Sta'.es
for the purpose of influencing their action.
Mr. Kenney admitted that he had cabled
his own views to the delegates. Mr. Sexton
said that the supplementary cable dispatch
sent in the party's name, after the confer
ence held last Friday night did not accord
with the arrangements which had been
made at the conference. Mr. John O'Con
nor declared that the business had not been
conducted fairly. He justified Mr. Parnell's
action in issuing his manifesto, and con
demned the misleading cable dispatches
that had been sent to tbe delegates in tbe
United States. Mr. Campbell described tho
proceedings of Mr. Parnell's opponents as
infamous.
Air. Parnell was appealed to to decide
whether the expression used by Mr.
Campbell was orderly. He replied that tho
countrv would decide as to their proceed
ings. Further recriminations were then in
dulged in regarding the informal meetings
held Saturday. Mr. Healy described the
actions of Mr. Parnell's friends as obstruct
ive. Mr. Parnell denounced this remark as
insolent and impertinent This statement
was greeted with cheers of approval by Mr.
Parnell's friends, , which were answered
with cheers of derision by his opponents.
Mr. Joseph Nolan's amendment that the
question of the retirement of Parnell should
be postponed until the members had per
sonally ascertained the views of 'their con
stituents on tbe subject the part- then to
meet in Dublin and decide the matter, was
rejected by a vote of 44 to 2U.
Mr. O'Kelly declared that whatever
might be the result of the meeting, tho
question of Mr. Parnell's retirement would
not be decided at Westminster. A decision
ought not to be too hurriedly reached. It
would bo best to give the country time to
think. The power of the Liberal party to
do, anything for the furtherance of tho
home-rule cause was limited by the House
of Lords, which was always a barrier un
less its members feared a revolution. But
they would never see a revolution in Eng
land based upon Irish claims.
Mr. Arthur O'Connor advised Mr. Parnell
'to withdraw, as henceforth it would bo im
possible for him to be the leader of the
party.-
Mr. Jordan accused Mr. Parnell of sacri
ficing tbe causo of tbe nation to his insen
sate pride and culpable ambition.
At 6 o'clock the meeting adjourned for an
hour. The Irish party will resume to
morrow tbe discussion of Mr Barry's mo
tion for the retirement of Mr. ParnelL The
supporters of Parnell are considering an
otherameudment .
ROW OVER TKLEGRAMS SENT TO AMERICA.
In the course of to-day's discussion Mr.
Parnell attacked Mr. Barry and others for
sending dispatches to America trying to in
fluence the delegates there. .
, Mr. Sexton said he became aware last
week that a number of messages were being
received from the delegates. '
Mr. Parnell Where are they?
Mr. Sexton They were from individual
delegates to individual members.
Air. John Redmond Give the names.
Mr. Sexton I received a telegram from
T. P. 0'Connert requesting me to aive my
views of the situation. 1 did not ftel that
the mere distance entitled me to retnse,
aud I therefore cabled informing him that
a majority favored the retirement of Mr.
Parnell as necessary both for the home
rule came and the security of evicted ten
ants. I further added that if the envoys
saw a way to support the majority, sub
stantia, unanimity would bo secured.
Colonel Nolan Air. Sexton ought now to
withdiaw his expression of opinion in that
telegram, for he made a mistake. It is
such an important expression of opinion
that pro Jably the telegrams from the dele
gates in America were founded thereon.
Cries of "Hear." "hear." Mr. Sexton
must now see that unanimity does notiol
low tho delegates' voting against ParnelL
ICries of "Hear." "hear."
Mr. Leamy Unquestionably the effect
of these telegrams has been to create false
impressions at home and abroad.
Mr. Timothy Healy What's all this dis
cussion aboutT It seems another piece of
pure obstruction.
Mr. Parnell That is a most insolent, im
pertinent observation. lCheers.1 Yes, most
insolent and impertinent
Mr. Barry I rise .
Mr. Parnell Sit down, Mr. Barry.
Mr. Barry But allow .
Mr. Parnell I will not allow you, sir.
Mr. Leamy is in possession of the floor.
Mr. Leamy These telegrams to America
certainly produced a falso Impression iu
implying that a majority of the leading
men of the party were going in oue direc
tion. Mr. Wm. Redmond If any names were
sent to the delegates in America, all on each
sideoughttohavebeengiven. 1 bear thatthe
delegates' cablegram was read by certain
members of our party in an English club,
and was received with cheers. If Parnell
is to be deposed, in God's name depose him.
without making it a matter forcbeerinir
in an English club. ICries of "Hear,"
"hear."l
Air. Timothy Healy said he regarded this
line of debate as a red herring drawn across
their path to enable them to come to a de
cision on the main question the Parnell
document
Upon the reassembling of the meeting,
this evening Air. AI. J. Kenny declared that
it would be impossible to obtain home rule
without forming an alliance with an En
glish party. Ho strongly objected to sub
orating tne interests of the Irish people
to any particular man. Mr. Parnell. he
said, had been offered an honorablo com
promise. The Chairman What was it?
Air. Kenny To retire temporarily. But
instead of accepting this offer Air. Parnell
had issued a manifesto debarring him from
tho chairmanship henceforth should a
majority of bis party decide that it would
behest for him to retire. Why did Air.
Parnell in June express implicit belief iu
the good faith of the Liberal party, having
the Ha ward en interview in mindf
Why did he keep the interview
a secret nntil a personal issue
was raised? lCheers.1 lie iKennyl had
little hope for the future of the Irish parly
if they depended upon the chairman to save
