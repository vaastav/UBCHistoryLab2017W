tariff arr mgcme.nts in tho Philippines, and
th.it It d:i: not even deemed necessary to

the iIarda oa tlu- subject. Secretary Root
has h.i-i FcVfT.il conferences with other of
lieials t bout the enactment of legislation
iu( -5s,iry to m -t existing conditions, but
he t--aiw to-day that as he had not yet re-
ivi',1 an olllclal copy of the court's decl

should bo taken.
Th. secretary of the treasury to-day ls
tnvi to collectors of customs in the United
Statra a telegraphic order directing them
to adrr.lt f n c of duty goods imported from
the Philippine inlands. Following is the
crdcr: Discontinue requirement entry and

bond. , iKtain cigars and cigarettes until
Internal revenue t-tamps are affixed, under
Circulars M nnd 5, current year. Refunds
will be made by certified statement where
protests are duly tiled."
The court's decision has brought to the
attrition of leaders in Congress the need
r.f I si?l.UIon in the archipelago somewhat
on th lints of that enacted for Porto Itlco,
p.r.d particularly dealing with revemie ques
tions and imports from the Philippines.
S'ich legislation will originate in the House
of Representative;. In tome quarters there
was talk to-day th.tt the speaker would
announce the membership of the ways and
means committee very soon, probably thl3
we- k, owinsr to the Philippine division, but
there v;a. no nuthoritative statement as
to this. In any event the House leaders
cloubtle.-s will prepare the general frame
work of a Philippine LIU before or during
the holidays.
Rejoicing at Mnnlln.
MANILA, Dec. 2. The local newspapers
here published extras when they received
the news of the United States Supreme
Court's decision in the "fourteen diamond
rings" case, that the Philippines were
American territory and that the imposition
of duty on articles Imported Into the
United States from the Philippines is im
proper. The announcement of the decision
caused qreat excitement and jubilation
f-mong- the merchants and general public.
Kcprescntatives of the principal business
houses say it will revolutionize the entire
trade- of the Orient, and civilians and mili
tary men are pleased at the pro?tects of
F--nding presents home without having to
pay duty on them.
Jmeral Luke Wright, the vice governor,
thinks a general revision of taxation is im
perative. The Spanish merchants are pleased, since
Spani-h soods have the same treaty rights
its American goods.
Th- collector of the port. V. Morgan
Shuster. says it means returning the $7.Cm),
e collected In duties by tho customs
oüuial.-s. The custom house was besieged
to-day by importunate Inquirers, and the
decision of the Supremo Court was the
only thing talked about at the clubs, in
mercantile circles and in the civil and
military ollictsj.

IIATTLKSIIH MAIMS CLAIMS.
Counsel for the CJovernment Makes a
.Motion to Dlsmtna Them.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Counsel for the
government have presented to the Spanish
treaty claims commission a brief In support
of the motion to dismiss the claims growing
out of the sinking of the battleship Maine.
It Is contended that it was the intention
of the treaty of peace not to provide for
but to relinquish and leave in oblivion as
settled in the tribunal of war the grievance
referred to expressly in the Joint resolu
tion of April 20 as "the destruction of a
United States battleship with L'GG of its
officers and crew while on a friendly visit
in the harbor of Havana."
The brief savs that the destruction of
Spanish lives and the loss of Spanish pos
sessions atoned for and settled any sup
posed responsibility of Spain for the de
struction of that national ship with its offi
cers ana crew. On March 30, lSJs, Congress
passed an act for the relief of the Maine
suiferers, and this action, it is contended,
proved two things first, that the govern
ment of the United States, after the report
of a commission had made it clear that evi
dence could not be found to prove the au-
tnorshlp of the destruction of the Maine,
decided not to adopt and present claims for
money indemnity on behalf of its citizens
based upon such destruction, and secondly.
that It decided to recognize Instead of a
claim of that kind against Spain a claim
against itself on account of the same de
struction, which latter claim it proceeded to
settle in full.
Continuing, the brief says: "Spain has
offered to submit to an impartial investiga
tion by pome third power, arid had herself
made an investigation with the same in
definite result, it seems, as that made by
the United States. To suppose that this
commission after all that has been referred
to it and with the means and appliances
which have been furnished to It, suitable
only for the ordinary purposes of a claims
commission, wa3 intended to open up and
undo and do over again this inquiry Into the
responsibility of the Spanish government,
with the result of disgracing Spain on the
one hand and on the other of discrediting
the government of the United States, is en
tirely unreasonable.
IVO I IK OF TIIH JUDICIARY.

SOUTHERN ItEPRCSCXTATIOX.
Mr. Dick Wants an In vcHtlgnt Ion,
with n View to Reduction.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Representative
Dick, of Ohio, has introduced a resolution
for a general investigation of the denial or
abridgement of the right to vote in certain
States, with a view to reducing tha con
gressional representation from such
States. The resolution recites that "it is a
matter of common information and belief
that the rights of some male citizens, be
ing twenty-one years of age, to vote at
elections is denied and abridged in certain
States." In conclusion the resolution pro
vides: "Resolved, That the matter be referred
to the committee on election of President,
Vice President and representatives In Con
gress, with power to subpoena and examine
witnesses under oath, and to send for rec
ords Rnd other evidence, to investigate
fully and completely, and report what pro
portion the number of male citizens, twen
ty-one years or age, in any btate. to whom
said State denies or abridges the right to
vote aforesaid, except for participation in
the rebellion or other crimes, bears to the
total number of male Inhabitants of such
State, being twenty-one years of age and
citizens of the United States."
FLOOD OF RILLS.
House Clerical Stnff S wninped In
troduced hy One Man.
WASHINGTON, Dec. S. The flood of
tills Is so great in the House of Repre
sentatives that the clerical staff was kept
busy all night last night and managed
to get abreast of 273 public, and 1.113 pri
vate bills, a total of 1,302, or about one
half of all those introduced. Represent
ative Brownlow, of Tennessee, led the
list with C52 bills and resolutions.
It was not until to-day's session of the
House closed that the weary clerks were
able to catch up with yesterday's deluge
of bills and begin sorting the further del
uge of to-day. There were few notable
measures in to-aay's list, most of the bills
being reprints from former sessions.
Among them were bills by Mr. Showalter,
of Pennsylvania, for a constitutional
amendment prohibiting polygamy, and by
Mr. Dick, of Ohio, a constitutional amend
ment substituting April a for March 4 as
the date of commencement of terms of the
President, vice president, senators and rep
resentatives. To Stop Smuggling; of Furs.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. The postmaster
general has instructed the postmasters at
Alburg and East Alburg, Vt., to note
all packages mailed at their offices and
suspected of being liable to customs duties,
and to furnish the addresses on such pack
ages to the customs officers at the Canadian
line for the use of the customs officers
nearest to the respective places of address.
This action is designed to stop, as far as
possible, a recently discovered unique
scheme of smuggling fur goods across the
border. Furriers in Montreal, it Is claimed,
have been shipping goods to persons liv
ing close to the bound ry line, and these
have putthe goods la carriages and driven
across into Vermont, where they have
mailed the packages'. The Treasury De
partment wants the postoffices to hold up
all such packages, but the Postoffice De
partment has deemed this impracticable.
Customs official In a city where a package
is addre?scd will, however, be advised in
time to Inspect the suspected articles be
fore delivering.

of the blue tint which ha3 ben in use.
Each copy was richly bound In brown
morocco with stiff covers, with simple gold
border and lettering, the words on the
front being: "Message of the President of
the United States, 11j1."
'o Public Henrlnea.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Secretary Root
to-day instructed the army post board,
which Is holding daily sessions here to
grant no public hearings. This ruling of
the secretary 13 the result of numerous
applications to appear In person before the
board and set out reasons why certain
pofs should be retained or abandoned.
It is felt that hearings of this sort would
retard the progress of the work before the
board.

WILL ADD GREAT WEALTH.
Reclamation of Arid Lands Will De
velop a Vast Region.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3. George H. Maxwell,
executive chairman of the National Irri
gation Asociation, In speaking to-night of
that part of tho President's message which
recommends to Congress a national pol
icy for the storage of the waters that now
go to waste in the arid region and tho
reclamation and settlement of the. arid
public domain, said that if the President's
ideas are carried out the wealth, re
sources and population of the United
States will be nearly doubled within a gen
eration. "The President," said Mr. Max
well, "shows that where tho arid nublic
lands are to be reclaimed the national gov
ernment will alo build great main line
canals to bring water within reach of set
tlers and reserve tne lands ror home-builders.
His familiarity with Western condi
tions enables him to sneak with author
ity when he says that the problem must
be solved by tho national government and
not by the States. The President has an
swered every objection to the policy and
rlf-mnnst ra tfd that Its tnana-iiratinn wniiU!

MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.
Remarkable Success of Republicans
in Massachusetts Cities.
BOSTON, Dec. 3. Snow and rain made
disagreeable weather in fourteen of the
thirty-thrco cities of Massachusetts that
held municipal elections to-day. Of four
teen cities eleven went for license, a gain
of one over last year, the change being in
Fltchburg. Tho great feature of the elec
tions as a whole was tho remarkable suc
cess of tho Republican party, ten mayoral
ty candidates of that party winning and
carrying with them in nearly every instance
a city council in sympathy with them. Ihe
party results were as follows: Marlboro,
Republican; Northampton, Republican;
Fall River, Republican, Taunton, Repub

Price Jumped ?2 a Dale in as Many
Minutes nnd Then Slumped.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3. Trading oa the
local Cotton Exchange to-day was con
vulsed by the publication at noon of a gov
ernment estimate of a short cotton crop for
the. year. The figures were 9.674,000 bales,
or nearly 2,0"0,000 bales less than the trade
generally expected. Cotton Jumped $2 a
bale in as many minutes amid scenes of
excitement rarely seen. Brokers fought
with each other to cover short contracts
and the pit became a pandemonium for
several minutes after the report was re
ceived. For three hours thereafter the vol
ume of business transacted was enormous.
After the first sharp advance of nearly
forty points a slump developed, which car
ried prices nearly half way back to the Quo
tations prevailing before the figures were
made known. Before the close, however.
the loss was regained and. prices were at
their highest.

Fine Plnylnff and IliRh Runs
by the Sevr Yorker.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3. Two matches were
played in the international billiard tourna
ment in the Madison-square Garden Con
cert Hall this afternoon and evening. De
spite the rain and snowstorm there was a
fair attendance, a great many women be
ing among the spectators.
In the afternoon George Sutton, of Chi
cago, defeated Leonard Howlson. of Can
ada, by a score of 4 to 237. In the evening
George F. Slosson, of this city, met Ora C.
Mornlngstar, of Rochester, Ind., and ran
out his 400 points, whllo Mornlngstar was
making 165. Mornlngstar had a good deal
of hard luck throughout the game, the balls
rolling badly for him In nearly very in
stance. Slosson was very nervous In the
early part of the gamo, but as he gradually
gained a commanding lead he regained his
usual composure and treated t ie audience
to some of the finest billiard playing ever
witnessed. Morningstar's high runs were
21, 19, 14, 13, an average of 4H-3U. Slosson's
high runs wero 43, 3S, 35, 32, 30, an average
of 1010-39.
Howlson was in very poor form through
out the game in the afternoon, and he
claimed that the white ball which he had
chosen was imperfect. Sutton had the very
same complaint to make of tho white ball
he choose in the opening gamu yesterday.
Howison's best effort was 32, while Sutton
with some beautiful all round play went
twice above the 40 mark and he won out
wLn a score of 400 to Howison's 237, making
an average of a little better than 10.
To-morrow Mornlngstar will play Barutel
in the afternoon and at night Jacob
Schaefer, of Chicago, will play the Canad
ian, Howlson.

PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 2. There was a
continued improvement In the switchman's
trike situation to-day. More crews were
at work and tho different terminals showed
that little congestion exists. The Brother
hood of Railway Trainmen have secured
several experienced men to take the places
of the strikers, and the result Is trfat traf
fic is being moved in a much quicker time
than any day since the strike was inaugu
rated. Several more of the switchmen on the
Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, in McKees-
port, came out, but trains are moving
along just as usual. The mills in McKees
port are badly crippled, however, on ac
count of the scarcity of men at work in

which connects all the manufacturing
plants in that city.

STEEL WORKS AND SHIPS.
Result of Sir Christopher Piirnest'a
Mission to tho United States.
NEW YORK, pec, 3. Sir Christopher
Furness, M. P., 6ailed for England to-day,
taking with him signed contracts for the
building of twelve freight-carrying steam
ers of from 6,0"0 to 10,000 dead weight ca
pacity, the capital, nearly Si.OOO.OOO, to be
furnished by Americans. He also made
arrangements with the Clergue interests,
at Sault Ste. Marie, for tne erection of an
immense shipbuilding plant, to be located
at Sault Ste. Marie, close to the junction of
the "Soo" canal and Lake Superior. Here
will be erected steel works, which will
cost approximately $KU,Ou0, end the Iron
and coal fields of Canada will furnish the
raw material.
Before sailing Sir Christopher said that
during the three months he had spent in
this country he had found why the United
States manufactuier is crowding the Brit
ish producer. Ho has seen here the rail
road locomotives hauling twice the load
hauled on the English roads, with half
the expense. Everything also he had seen
done on the samo economic sscale. Be
cause he believes that Canada is sure to
profit by the greatness of the United
States, he has chosen to locate his next
project there. The drawback of Ice in the
St. Lawrence river would be overcome by
immense lce-crushlng steamers.

JOHNSON WILL NOT FIGHT
CONTRACTS OF AMERICAN ASSOCIA
TION TO I1C RESPECTED.
This Will He a Great Help to the Nerr
Dasehall OrKnIt Ion Local
Sportlnjr Matters.
The American League will respect the
contracts of the new American Associa
tion the coming year and will not tam
per with players who have signed contracts
to play with any of the clubs of the new
association. President Ban Johnson has
notified President Hlckey, of the American
Association, to this effect, saying that the
American League will respect all contracts
of the new association and will not elgn
men who have already placed their names
to association contracts.
This action on th3 part of President
Johnson shows that the American League
will not wage war against the new base
ball organization. In view of the war be
tween the two major organizations and
the fact that there is no longer an Amer
ican agreement for the protection of minor
leagues this action means more than may
appear at first blush. The American
League clubs could afford to pay larger
salaries than American Association clubs,
and if the former did not respect the lat
ter's contracts players who sign associa
tion contracts could be secured by Amer
ican League clubs at any time.
President Hlckey will meet with the old
Western League magnates at St. Joseph
to-day. The affairs of the old league will
be closed up and the pennant awarded to
Kansas City and a circuit for a new league
formed, comprising Colorado Springs, Den
ver, Lincoln, Sioux City, Des Moines and
St. Joseph.
First Baseman Meyers' Signed.
A report from, Columbus last night stated
that Manager Watklns has signed Meyers,
who played first base for the Dayton West
ern Association team last year, to play
that position for the Indianapolis team next
season. Meyers played good ball for Day
ton and he was one of the best batters in
the league.
. , -A3IERICAX
HALL LEAGUE.
31. It. KiHIIea and P. C. Gross to Con-
trol St. Lonis Club.
CHICAGO. Dec 3.-M. It'. Killilea and
Fred C. Gross will control the St. Louis
club of the American League. Henry Killi
lea, who held the majority stock in the Mil
waukee club, disposed of his Interest to
these two, and the formal transfer of the
franchise was announced to-night when
the league adjourned to meet March 6 at
Detroit for the schedule meeting. The price
paid Henry Killilea for his stock was not
announced. This question occupied the
greater part of to-day's session, which be
gan at noon to-day and continued, with
two recesses, until 10:30 o'clock to-night.
Besides discussing the various phases of
the St. Louis Question the league took a
firmer stand on the question of betting on
the result of games by spectators. This
was reported to have grown almost to a
practice In some cities, notably Boston. At
the close of the meeting President Johnson
announced that every effort would be made
to suppress the evil and that spectators
caught in the act would be led to the gates,
their money refunded and their absence
thereafter solicited.
President Johnson admitted that be had
received a letter from Manager Collins, of
Boston, asking that Pitcher Dineen'a name
be taken from the blacklist. Johnson said
he was willing to do so and that If Col
lins wanted Dlneen he would be free to
Fign. He explained his action by stating
that ho had the highest regard for Collins,
who had been offered a large salary by the
Boston National League club to jump his
American League contract, but had re
mained steadfast. Therefore Johnson
argued that he was entitled to coneldera
tlon, and as Boston was the club from
which Dineen jumped back to the National
League he was willing to forgive him if
Collins did.
It is understood that Baltimore has of
fered Boston the choice of either Nop or
Foreman gratis. Managers Mack and Mc
Aleer were in conference the greater part
of the afternoon-and it was supposed a
trade was likely, but nothing was accomp
lished. It Is said the two managers agreed
upon what players to go after and divid
ed the list.
While the regular season will open April
23, Baltimore will probably begin the 1Ä2
baseball year at Boston April ID, which
is Patriots' day.
Comlskey stated positively to-day that
he had signed a third baseman for th
coming season, but declined to give the
name.
The excuse of Heldrlck and Wallace for
their desertion of Comlskey last year be
came known to-day. Thejr asserted that
Griffith was to keep the matter a secret
as at the time Heidricli signed a regular
contract and Wallace an option, such act
ion was contrary to the rules of the Play
ers' Association. Accordingly the pledge
of secrecy was imposed. The story be
came known and both men repudiated
their Chicago alliance. Efforts were made
to patch up the affair by shifting them
to other American League cities, but Com
isky is said to have stood for a fulfillment
ot his option and contract.
The statement by one of the managers
of the Boston National League team that
he would go out after all American League
players if Dlneen wer taken from the
Boston National League club, was treated
as a joke by the majority of the mag
rates. MAY FAVOR GIRLS.
School Board JJny Arrange Place for
Basket Rail Practice.
The question of & place In which the girls
of the Shortrldge High School basket-ball
team can practice Is still undecided. It
was hoped that the old barn in the rear
of the high school building might be uti
lized for the purpose, but it was necessary
to remove a joist, and when this was done
Building Inspector Bartell docldad that the
place was unsafe for tha girls. At the meet
ing of the School Board Friday night the
matter will receive attention and the board
may decide to have the barn repaired at a
small cost for the use of the athletically
inclined girls. In case the barn is ma3e
safe the basket-ball girls, under Ml s Nehr
bas. will at once begin practicing for the
season's games.
