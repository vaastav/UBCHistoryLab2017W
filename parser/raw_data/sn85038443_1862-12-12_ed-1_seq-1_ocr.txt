01 the U. 8. treasury, ooe year ago Mid
(be U.S. Debt, on tho 1st July last, '
would probably be 8517.372 802
It a. actually but 514,211,371
Less than estimated, by 3,161,431
With the million of men now in the
field, be eayt, if tbe war cootiouea nntil
1st July, 1803, tbe debt will be
$1,122,297,403
bou!d it continue until 1st
July,18tU, tbe Debt will
. then probably be 1,744,085,586
I Of coarse, nothing bat a continuance
of hostilities in tbe North, and of laziuess,
blundering, aod treachery, in tbe Army,
will render it probable that tho war will
Continue until next June, except in small
nets in scattered fields.
On all bands, Gov. Chase's Report
is allowed to be a plain, frank, aod mas
terly exhibit of national finances.
Bj)See. Chase recommends, as a Euau
oial expedient, a tax on State Banks, aod
that Banks hereafter eotabliabcd be based
upon TJ. S. Bills, wbicb are not to bear
interest, but are to be a safeguard for
holders. It is substantially tho recom
mendation of Tree. Jefferson, aboot 181S.
The plan would furnish a national curren
cy everywhere at par, and safer even tbsn
ibe Free Banking system of New York.
It would bind tbe Sutes together, and
the National Treasury would be greatly
profited by it. The influence of the Banks
shay defeat this measure, but it is one
well worthy of general and profound con
sideration. Aid for True Friends.
1 It is a singular fact, that the best
friends of America, in Eogland, are the
workers (in factories, &c.,) who are now
enduring the most from the lack of cotton
which tho Rebels bar up ia order to
f oree, tbe world into their terms. Those
working men, knowing that Slavery is
the causa of Rebellion, do sympathize
with the working men of America, and
patiently await, suffering, at home, in
hope that tbe world may be benefitted
fcy the trial and triumph of Liberty ia
she end.
A noble response to this manly feeling
en the part of the honest poor of Kuglsnd,
it put forth in New York, where, last
week, Forty Thousand Dollars were
raised to furnish food, gratuitous, for tbe
half starved workiog men of Lancashire,
&e. Thus, while tbe Aristocracy of Eng
land ara panishing their people, aod aid
ing the Rebels clandestinely while their
Government ie winking at this unhand
some treatment the people of America
are reeving to supply with bread tbe poor
of that very aristocracy and Government!
Was ever such a sublime Christian spec
tacle exhibited in the world T There are
needy men, women, aud children they
sympathize with God's poor, of darker
hues, in this land and we send them
tbe meaoa of living and of braviug the
terrors of starvation laid upon them by
Slavery and its allies.
P. S. Thousands more have been
added to the above-named contributions
.from New York, aod Philadelphia aod
other places are waking up to join io
ending much needed and right welcome
food to make Happy New Years to our
honest, endoring, beart-warm friends, tbe
laboring men and mechanics of Eogland.
Secretary Seward ssys there is a bet
ter feeliog for the Uoiou begiooicg to
well np from tbe masses of Great Britian.
They
ill ere long make the Government ,
feel their moral power. The truth will be
known, at length, by the great heart of
England.
.There are $200,000,000 of specie
in the Union. That would be an aver
age of C10 eaeh to every person in tbe
Jaortb. Half of that sum is idle io the
Banks, and the other half is hid away on
account of the issue of legal small notes :
and illegal ahioplastcrs. Banish tho
mier, and Have a little conndence, ana
specie will soon flow as before.

On Monday, we all had leisure to run

Iu tbe western part of tbe city is
a very high hill, capped with somebody's
Pyrotechnic manufactory, which we
climbed, and, bad the day been clear, it
might bare been a glorious panorama of
tbe river, of the city, of tbe rolling bills.
But a December sun eould scarce strug
gle through the clouds the dense black
smoke, from tbo factories, steamboats, and
chimnies, lay like a pall over Ihe city, and
over the bills and river. The noise, tbe
roar came np lo our high point de is like
the roar of any other Babel, except that
from this Porkopelis came mingled with
them tho squealing of pigs, and on tbe
chwging wind the accnt of the ferieit
rottenest eheese Limberger, or Swoitxer,
which yon will. So, descending, guided
by tbe noise of tbe pigs, we steered for a
slaughter boose. We met six and seven
horse loads of eleaoed porkers on tbeir
wav to the packioi; boose. It teemed so
brutal dead hogs on tbe wagons, aod
loaded to excess, with bratal drivers whip
ping the horses. Walking through tbe
mod, guided oow by tbe wsgons, now by
squeals, and by the scent aforesaid, we
peeped into a low brick building, aod saw
sooh a sight and smelled snob, a smell, as
never do we wish again to greet os. We
panted on the threshold, hot, sick at I
was, I determined to go on. A dozen
men were engaged at the "innards,' each
appearing to have only n certain part to
attend, aod slapping the remainder on to
tbe next all workiog like fury, tinging,
aod slashing things around at n terrible
rate. We rolled np onr pan Is and went
in, wading through bristles fetlock deep,

pulled tbe hogs ont, one cut their throats,

of thirty men, ranged along, cleaned them

nasty, dotesiable sight, and glad am I to
have seen it once, but Dover shall be
tempted to visit it again.
Following the great wagon loads of

passable condition of the roads, a supply
of tbe former could not be had, and barely
enough of the latter to meet our daily
wants. The railroad from Acquis Creek
is now, however, repaired, and onr sup
