MISSIONARY LETTER
Mrs. Van Cleave Writes of Her Experi
ences In China Vivid Picturo
of Condition Thoro.
Mrs. Minn Van Clenvo Buck, the
missionary In Lu Chow Fu, whom the
Mason county Christian churches are
snporting us their "Living Link,'
writes her first Impressions of-Chtnn as
follows:
In ordor to comprohend tho full slg
jilflcnnco of the ChlnoSo chill, of whiol
vou have often heard people speak, just
land In Shanghai on Friday, the 13th 0
March, with a drizzling rain falling nnd
Mm winil blowiiiL' at tho rato of CO
miles an hour, soomlngly direct fron
the North Pole. Such was my cxpcrl
ence. I renlly thought thoy hod made
a mistake and taken mo to Greenland,
until I looked around and saw grcon
fields and blooming flowers. Then I
suddenly realized that It was merely
the damp atmosphere thnt was penetrat
ing to tho marrow of my bones. The
people who havo endured it for a few
seasons tell me that I Avill become ac
iMstomed to It. Pel haps. 1 will. Again,
it was dinieult for me to realize that 1
wns in far away China, for in Shan
ghai the street ears and automobiles
aro as much in e idonco as they aro in
any American city. lloweor, when 1
leached Wuhu and took a Chinese
l.iunch, I was fjuite aware that some
tiling different hail appeared. To be
crowded with thirty pieces of baggage
into a little six by six 100111 with noth
ing but boards to sit on, no windows
for ventilation or light, and tho euri
ous Chiueso ever gazing in at tho two
by two door, made me realize fully that
I was having a new experience. The
lnunch was interesting, but tho sail
boat that wo had to take at Chan
Helen was more so, for tho waters wore
so low that wo had to have threo water
buffaloes to pull us over the mud of the
river tho most peculiar sleigh ride
that I have over had. 1 tried to make
a picture of it. but one of the buffalo
drivers screamed until 1 had to stop.
He said it would kill him to have his
picturo taken. Another interesting waj
of travel is by chair. The roads arc
ery winding, from ono to three feet
wide, nnd built up sometimes several
feet abovo tho fields. Tn going around
a sharp comer you can imagine how
ono feols suspended over a precipice
in midair.
While- I was deeply Impressed by the
erndo methods of travel, I was just as
gieatly surprised by somo of tho beau
tiful sights. 1 camo to China with the
idea that there is nothing beautiful
here, but I happily find that my Idea
was wrong. 1 can imagino nothing
moro beautiful than the fields of yellow
blossoming rape among tho fields of va
rious shades of green all In far greater
splendor in many respects Than any
thing I have over seen in America.
1 feel that people In tho homelands
pro given a very distorted notion of
conditions hero.-1 can remember when
L had a very distinct mental picturo of
how the person who became a mission
ary sacrificed everything and went to
tho field to live in a hovel. Par from
il; the missionaries have good com
fortable homes here, in fact, much bot
tor than many of oar parsonages in the
Homeland. There aro inconveniences,
to bo sure, but I feel that that side of
tho question is over-emphasized and
consequently many who might otherwise
bo attracted to the foroign fields as
workers remain at home whore the neod
Is far less great. Of course, thoro are
sights, odors and sounds that aro very
disturbing especially to the pre comer.
To seo tho beggars lying along the
streets rolled' in a pieco of filthy mat
ting and calling in such pitiful tones
certainly makes one's heart ache. But
wo expect such conditions, that is why
wo aro here to help them ralso the
standard of living. It all makes me
exceedingly anxious for tho time tn
come when I can havo an actual part in
the uplifting of this people.

tho meaning of his subject appeared
when Jean Valjean was brought face

u process of roasoning on tho hard
ships of tho galleys, on his good work
as a philanthropist nud how ho was
making money and doing good with it,
he decided not to roveal It but allow an
other to go to prison under fnlso accu
Bation. Upon reaching this decision he
hoard an interpal hurst of laughtei
which resounded in hh soul until his
finnl yielding to the demands of con
scloneo and his choice of tho right.
"Tho Laughter of tho Soul At It

of despair which sends cold shivers
through nil the nerves, cnusos a strange
perspiration to stand on tho forehead,
makes ono hoar another voice, and quail
even when in solitude This part of
tho snbjoct was illustrated by scenes

Tho converso of "Tho Soul's Laugh
