It was not to he expected that the

like the President's Message. It is too
rich lor their blood.

Wiikn the House gets through with
Judge Jucksou's claim to a seat he will
know tho tllflertmco twixt "Two" d.e
dWB-ond "Two" dlo-dce. So will Gov
eruor Wilson. _
If you want to get u clear idea of the
xtariff question, read what Kocretury
Wlndom says. He gives a lucid exposi
tion of the sound doctrine of Protection
to Home Industries.
Democratic Congressmen resent the
Idea ol a committee to steer them aright.
This is logical. It Is tho blessed privi
lege of u Democratic to go wrong aud to
stay wrong all the time,
Heiie's ono for you, Governor Wilson,
if "Two" may ho translated to mean
twelve, why not twenty? And here's
unolhcr. 11 Judge Jackson hud needed
twenty wouldn't "Two" have beou made
to mean twenty ? -

Tho Secretary of tho Treasury Is in
favor of removing tho tobacco tax and
tho tax on spirits used in llio arts. This
'is good as lar as It goes. Tho country
does not need n dollar of tho revenuo de

no occasion to rotiilu any part of thoin.
They wero dlsllncllvely war taxes,

never been levied for any other purpoie.

Murvel of Literary KuUeuvor,
In "Tho Narrative uud Critical History
ofAmeiica," edited by Juatin Wiuior,
LL.D., the accomplished librarian ol
Harvard, the world has what it haa long
needed, a real iiUtory, 00 far aa its his
tory can be told, of that great continent
which for four hundred years haa attract*
ed the increasing interest of mankind.
Thia work doua not enter the field to
dispute it with any predecessor. It haa
had no predecessor aud can have no
rival. From tho geographical knowledge
of tho undents concerning thia conti
nent down to the close of the Mexican
War the whole wide reach ia covered in
every detail that can have interest for
the geueral reader and tho special
student.
Kvery chapter haa ita historical narra
tive aud ita critical essay,and, of infinite
value, the aourcea from which the ma
terial is drawn. These sources embrace
all there is of American historiography.
The critical essay is a feature which can
not bo too highly commended aa u new
departure iu historical literature.
it is to tho honor of the editor, aa it
will he his enduring distinction. t*at he
preferred to bo the editor, ratuer than
attempt to he tho writer, of thia tcoiiu
mental work. Each subject is treated
by n specialist, so that we have reuson
to behove that we ure getting the very
best that learning can give on each point.
Mr. Winsor was not mistaken when he
conceived tho idea that intelligent co
operation under a skillful guiding hand
would produce gieut results in histori
ography uh it lias iu other llelda of en
di'Kvor. in no other way could such a
work qb this have been written.

The reproductions are iu tho best style
of tho Riverside Press, which aeotns to

undertaking. To suy of this History
ttiut it is very much more than its pub

On tho whole, the President's deliver

neither sensational nor venturesomo in
tho matter of suggesting now departures.
It is strong aud senuihle 011 at least three
of the most important questions?before

of tho other topics taken up nro merely

President Harrison in liialirst message
deals with the many topics of nutional
interest in plain, moderate and adequate
terms, showing that lie has a clear un
derstanding of general conditions and of
the important public questions aud also
pronounced opinions upon the subjects
whioh aro now especially prominent in
the popular mind. It is altogether prob
able that Republican policy, as forma*
luted by Congress, will bo shaped in ac
cordance with the suggestions offered
by President Harrison. Concerning the
tHrifl, tho silver question and tho build
ing up of tho merchant marino, the
President gives expression to tho best
opinion of the country. He has fur
nished the Republican Congress a broad
and souud basis on which to erect a
splendid structure of legislation during

of conscious strength und sincerity, aud
