Who "Went to the Island
for Ammunition.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.-The bill to pro
vide temporary revenues for the Philippine
Island was debated In the House to-day
and will be voted on to-morrow at 4 o'clock.
It was the first debate of the session and
was conducted calmly and without display
Of temper. Several lively exchanges and
an Impassioned speech by Mr. De Armond,
of Missouri, who has Just returned from a
trip to the Philippines, In opposition to
the retention of the Islands were the
features.
Mr. Payne, the floor leader of the ma
jority, opined the debate. Owing to the
indisposition of Mr. Richardson the duty of
opening: for the minority devolved upon Mr.
Bwanson, of Virginia. The ether speakers
were Mr. Orosvenor (Rep., Ohio) and Mr.
Robertson (Dem., La.) for the bill, and
Messrs. Shrafroth (Silver, Col.), DeArmond
(Dem., Mo.), Mr. Thayer (Dem., Mass.)
and Patterson (Dem., Tenn.) against it.
Mr. Robertson said he would support the
bill because free trade with the Islands
and reciprocity with Cuba, which was
threatened, would destroy the sugar Inter
est of his State. To-morrow Mr. McCall,
a Republican member of the ways and
means committee, from Massachusetts, will
oppose the bill, time having been granted
him by the Democrats.
Mr. Pcyne aroused enthusiasm as he de
scribed the great work of civilization which
was golnff on all along the line of educa
tion. "Our friends on the other side," said
he, "howl about our imperialistic govern
ment of the natives. We are trying to lift
them up to the standard of American citi
Eenshlp." "Aro you trying to fit thern for citizenship
In the United States or citizenship in the
Philippine islands?" asked Mr. Caines, of
Tennessee.
"We will cross that bridge when we come
to It." replied Mr. Payne. "Rut if you on
the other side will co-operate with tis we
will lit them for citizenship in the Philip
pine Islands. United States or any other
country." Republican applause.
"We will co-operate with you," replied
Mr. Gaines, "when you carry the Constitu
tion and the flag to the Philippines."
MR. PAYNE HITS RACK.
"I cn surprised." observed Mr. Payne,
Mto hear the gentleman from Tennessee
make that statement. He has Just returned
from the Islands. Is it possible he did
riot carry the Constitution and flag with
him?" Laughter. Proceeding, Mr. Payne
tald the other side offered no substitute for
thin bill, and, having made a reference to
trust in free-trade England, Mr. Wheeler
(Kentucky) interrupted to inquire whether
the assurance which aggregate capital has
in this country that the attorney general
would do his duty was not responsible for
th great trusts now in existence in the
United States.
"I will allow the gentleman to answer his
own question," replied Mr. Payne. "It Is
beyond me. Of course, he does not believe
that any mor than I do."
do believe it." declared Mr. Wheeler.
and I am quit satisfied the gentleman
himself bllevfs it."
"If he doH," observed Mr. Payne In clos
ing the colloquy. "1 don't know what he
believe and he don't know what I believe."
Mr. ii&wnson. of Virginia, in opening de
clared that none of the benefits for the Fili
pino of which Mr. l'avne had been telling
could accrue through the agency of the
pending bill. He reviewed thf recent de
cisions of the Supreme Court In reference
to the Philippines, deploring the fact that
fcuurt had reversed its previous deci
Prolmhly fiilr nnd cold.
Em
sions and had seen proper to confer upon
Congress absolute power to govern Terri
tories. He deprecated as pernicious the
principle of the bill, which fixed the tariff
duty on goods going from the United States
Into the Philippines. He Faid this really
gav to this country the power to fix both
the price at which the Philippines should
sell their good to us and also purchase
ours; that this was a power which no Just
nation wanted to exercise and which could
not be exercised without abuse and ODDres
sion. He Insisted that It was precisely the
same power that the British Parliament
sought to exercise over the American col
onles, against which they rebelled. He said
that Philippine sugar to enter our markets
must pay a duty of 5ö5 a ton. while ours
could be sold In their markets upon the
payment of $17 per ton; that their hemp
must pay a duty of $2f, while ours could
enter the Philippines at Sil per ton; that
our coal could enter at 25 cents per ton.
while theirs when sold here must pay 67
cents per ton; that our tobacco enters their
markets on a payment of S3 cents per
pound, while theirs must pay here 11.85 per
pound. He said a fit place for such a bill
was in the Cortes of Spain and not in the
Congress of the United States.
AN ANTI-EXPANSIONIST.
Mr. Thayer, of Massachusetts, in a fifteen-minute
speech, explained the reasons
which induced him to oppose the passage
of the bill. He declared that we had over
powered the Filipinos, but had not con
quered them; that the same spirit of liber
ty which led them to rebel against the
tyranny of Spain still animated them.
This bill, which proposed to tax them at
both ends of the line, would naturally
arouse their resentment.
Mr. Grosvenor called attention to the
fact that the Republican administration
had tried to avoid the war with Spain.
"At that time," said he, "the same cry
of liberty rang through this hall. I believe
if it had not been for the explosion of the
Maine there would not have been any war,
but that all the results which have fol
lowed would have been worked out except
the acquisition of the Philippines. I wish
the opposition would stand with us as loy
ally in bearing the burdens of that war
as they were in driving us into it." Ap
plause.J Mr. Grosvenor recalled the storm of crit
icism against a similar bill for the benefit
of Porto Rico. Rut it had passed and
money had been made available. Mr. Gros
venor described the beneticent result of
the bill in the Island of Porto Rico. Turn
ing to the question of reciprocity he de
clared that the Republican party was prac
tically solid as to what should be done.
Those who were yelling for tariff revision,
he said, were about as numerous for the
amount of noise they make as was the
coyote which disturbed Grant's slumber
on the Western plains.
"Has the gentleman forgotten the last
speech of the late President McKinley?"
asked Mr. Thayer, of Massachusetts.
"I have not," answered Mr. Grosvenor.
"I wish the gentleman would take that
speech and read it and act upon it. If he
does he will rise in my estimation 90 odd
per cent."
Mr. Shafroth, who recently returned
from the Philippines, vigorously opposed
the bill. He declared there were many
popular misapprehensions about the Fili
pino people. There was a highly educated
class among them, perfectly capable ol
conducting a government and of governing
themselves. A government by strangers
must fall in many respects. Mr. Shafroth
went over a list of the salaries paid to the
American ofllcials in the Philippines to
show the interests of the poor natives who
paid the taxes. Mr. Shafroth declared that
the spirit of Independence nnd liberty lived
in the Filipino as well as the American,
and that until the Filipinos were free the
situation could not be satisfactory either
to tht-m, or to us.
Mr. De Armond, of Missouri, who alsö
has recently returned from the Philippines,
aroused much enthusiasm on the Demo
cratic side by a denunciation of the pend
ing measure and of the entire Philippine
policy of the administration. He declared
that the bill proposed was legislation aft?r
the manner of an empire. It disregarded
the rights of the Filipinos as well as the
American representatives, it was legisla
tion by the War Department, legislation
by alien for alien. He denied the necessity
of taking the islands or of keeping them.
Democratic applause. "We acquired them
in folly," said he; "let us dispose of the:n
in wisdom. Almost every man in the islands
lonns for independence and liberty. How
long will it be before another insurrection
breaks out? Who can tell how many of our
youth it will lay away in country church
yards and how many dollars of extra levy
it will cost the people? How much better
would It be for us to return to the princi
ples of an American party and make an
end of cur troubles. Why not dispose of
them to some country that wants colonies?
Any disposition of llum is better than their
retention."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.-Seml-ofricial ad
vices received hero Indicate that active
hostilities are about to begin between Co
lombia and Venezuela. The delay in pro
ceeding to extremes has been largely
caused by the lack of a suitable stock of
arms and ammunition by the Colombian
government. This is about to be remedied.
The news that comes to-day Is to the effect
that the British steamer Ban Righ, which
recently occasioned suspicion by loading a
large cargo of arms in European waters
supposedly intended for the Boers in South
Africa, really was chartered by the Colom
bian government. She is now very near
Colon, and advices are to the effect that
when her cargo is distributed among the
Colombian troops hostilities will begin be
tween Colombia and Venezuela.
Another Fight in Colombia.
COLON, Colombia, Dec. 17. A boat has
Just arrived here from Playa Donna, dis
tant less than one mile from Nombre de
Dios, where the Colombian Conservatives
and Liberal forces fought an engagement
last Friday. She brings a few tick gov
ernment Foldiers. The troops wounded in
last week's engagement have been left at
Nombre de Dios. All Americans connected
with the manganese mine at that place
have arrived at Colon. They recognize that
theii lives would have been endangered if
they remained at Nombre de Dios.
SETTLEMENT EXPECTED.
More Hopeful Keeling? Over the Ar-
sentlne-Chlleno Troubles.
BUENOS AYRES, Dec. 17. The status of
the Argentine-Chilean question has not
changed. Senor Tortela, the Argentine
minister at Santiago de Chile, to-day hand
ed to the Chilean government the reply of
Argentina to Chile's latest note. Official
circles hold to the belief that a satisfactory
solution of the questions In dispute will not
be long In presenting itself.
The local news agency says It considers
the negotiations already have passed their
most delicate stage. It has been shown
that the cause for war does not exist,
though there may in some quarters exist a
desire to provoke war. Both countries,
however, are actively preparing for an
armed struggle. They are at the present
moment in the state which Immediately
precedes war, and which is having a disas
trous effect on the national finances. A de
cree Just Issued invites officers of the Na
tional Guard to Join the army reserves,
which have been mobilized. The work of
arming Argentine transports for war serv
ice has begun.
Night. The Chilean answer to Argen
tina's reply to Chile's last note has not
yet been received. Hope that the matter
will be amicably arranged still prevails
here. Senor Concha Subercaseaux, the
Chilean minister to Argentina, Is doing
his utmost to this end.
According to the Tiempo no arrangement
of the existing difficulties is possible, if
Chile refuses to accept the modifications
suggested by Argentina to the two im
portant paragraphs In the original Chilean
note.
The railroads of the country have placed
95.Ck.io tons of coal at the disposal of the
government. They also have offered to
provide transportation facilities for 40,G00
men as soon as desired.
Tho Diaro publishes a telegram from
London to the effect that the British gov
ernment has addressed a telegraphic com
munication to the Chilean anil the Argen
tine governments, offering its good offices
to bring about a settlement of all existing
difficulties between the two countries. The
British government adds that it takes this
step at the instance of Chile.
Telegrams received from Santiago de
Chile affirm that a great majority of the
members of the Chilean Congress are in
favor of a prompt and peaceful settlement.
The money markets here are quiet.

BAILIFF ON THE STAN II.
Strong: Testimony for the Defendant,
Alexander Sullivan Will Tes
tify in His Own Rehalf.
CHICAGO, Dec. 17. The sensation of the
day in the trial of Alexander Sullivan for
alleged conspiracy and Jury bribing was
the affirmation of William Lynch, brother
to ex-Bailiff James J. Lynch, the prose
cuting witness and confessed jury briber,
that he- would not believe his brother on
oath. Other testimony by witness for the
defense considerably strengthened Sulli
van's case.
Richard P. McGarry made tatters of
Lynch's story of one of his interviews with
Sullivan, and Kate Murphy, a servant in
the Sullivan household, testified as to the
falsity of Lynch's story of his visits to the
Sullivan home prior to Lynch's departure
for Canada. Miss Murphy said it would
have been Impossible for Lynch to have
called without her knowledge, and ne had
not done so. Miss Barbara Schüttler, Sul
livan's stenographer, testified that the mes
sages Robert Hill, Sullivan's former office
boy, had delivered to Lynch in the court
room were only bundles of campaign cards.
Six Judges of the county bench went on
the stand and testified that to the best of
their knowledge Alexander Sullivan had a
good character nnd reputation. They were
Judges Tuley, Stein. Chetlain, Baker, Clif
ford and Neely.
The attorneys for the defense announced
that Sullivan would take the stand to
morrow morning and enter a general de
nial to the charge of conspiracy preferred
against him.

There is not a shred of evidence favoring

LONDON, Dec. 17. Presiding this after
noon at a meeting of tho Burmah Rail
way Company, Sir Auckland Colvin, the
chairman, referred to tho purchase of
twenty American locomotives by the com
pany, lie said the board had been guided
by the fact that the Americans were able
to promise delivery within two or three
months of the date of the order, while the
English manufacturers could not do better
than twelve to seventeen months. The
price of the American locomotives was -0
per cent, lower than that of the English
engines.
it was premature to express a decided
opinion in the respective merits of English
and American engines. The consulting en

miles from Riga.
The peasantry rose In a body, besieged
the castle, set fire to It and danced around
the blazing building. The police were pow
erless against the mob, and troops were
summoned. The latter, however, were too

CAPTURE OF KRITZINOEIl
Reported 1y Lord Kitchener The
Roer Is Badly Wounded.
LONDON, Dec. 17. A dispatch from Lord
Kitchener, dated at "Belfast, about half
way between Pretoria and the frontier of
Portuguese East Africa, received here to
day announces that Commandant Krit
zinger, 'the famous Boer ceimmander who
has figured so prominently in connection
with the invasion of Cape Colony, has been
captured, badly wounded, by General
French.
Kritzinger was trying to break the block
house cordon at Hanover road.
The capture of Commandant Krltzinger,
who has been styled "the De WTet of Cape
Colony," Is regarded as very important.
He has been a troublesome and energetic
invader of Cape Colony, and Is credited
with more barbarities than any other
commandant except Scheipers. In a" recent
proclamation he called himself the chief
commander of Cape Colony.
During the last five days most persistent
reports, emanating both from South Africa
and from Boer headquarters in Europe, of
an approaching crisis in South African af
fairs have been current. It is alleged that
Mr. Kruger will abandon his demand for
independence, and the Boer leaders in the
field are inclined to cease lighting and
seek the be3t terms obtainable. In a speech
yesterday at Cape Town Sir J. Gordon
Sprigg, the premier of Cape Colony, de
clared that the outlook had never been
brighter than at the present time.

French Chamlier Supports the Church
nnd Slnte Policy.
PARIS, Dec. 17. In the Chamber of
Deputies this afternoon the premier, M.
Waldeck-Rousseau, urged the House to
re-establish the public worship estimates
which were suppressed by the budget com
mitter. He pointed out the advantages of
the maintenance of the concordat which
gave the state authority over the clergy,
and said a denunciation of the concordat
would lead to the creation of a hierarcny,
of which the head would bo at Rome. Ul
tramontaism would be no longer a doctrine,
but a fact, and a spiritual chief would be
created in France in addition to the tem
poral chief. Moreover, the proposition of
the denunciation of the concordat had
never once found a majority in the Cham
ber, and he (tho premier) did net believe It
existed now. The premier's remarks were
greeted with oheers.
ly a vote of V te 1S7 tlv? Chamber sub
sequently decided to discuss the dtt;dis of
the public worship bill. This is a victory
for the government, since it rejects the
commission's plan to abolish the public
worship estimates from the budget.

Nevrs of the Huo-Persiun Treaty
DiMcredited In Germany.
BERLIN. Dec. 17. The news of a Russo
Perslan treaty is received with considerable
doubt in official circles here. Such a con

other countries, and especially with the one
made between Germany and Tersla in 1S71,

The Lokal Anzeiger accepts the reported
treaty as a fact of the first Importance to
the diplomatic world and considers Persia
to be to-day economically a province of
Russia and that its political dependence
upon Russia Is a certain consequence. The
paper says Great Britain is the only svf
ferer and that Russia is now within mei
urable reach of a footing on the Indian
ocean.
