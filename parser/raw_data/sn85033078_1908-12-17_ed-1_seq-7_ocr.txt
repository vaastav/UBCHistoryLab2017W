A Scotsman was traveling in a third
class smoking carriage on a north ol
England line when at a small station
a fishwife with a creel opened the door.
Xot relishing the prospect of such com
pany, the Scotsman said in his smooth
est tones. “Alt. this is a smoking car
riage, my good woman!” The fishwife
took no notice, hut pushed in. “My
good woman, this is a smoking car
riage.” repeated the male passenger in
louder tones. The fishwife put her
creel in the corner and sat down op
posite to him. and the train started.
Then the woman put her hand in a
pocket of her blue iietticoat, took out
a large black pipe, lit it. and. blowing
a cloud of rank smoke that nearly suf
focated her companion, remarked, “And
so. my mannie, ye thocht naebody could

The pleasantest month of the year at

Some hospital physicians are urging
that horseflesh be more freely used as
being not only cheaper than beef, but

Rodin’s bust of Whistler Is almost

for his 'work. The bust has given the
utmost satisfaction In Paris; so much
so that a replica Is to be subscribed for

Petersburg.
Lead, when reduced to a very low
temperature in liquid air, is said to act
much as steel at ordinary temperatures.
It will serve as a helical spring, for
example. Just as iron Is soft and in
elastic at a high red color, so lead Is
dull and soft at ordinary temperatures,
for It is then already well on its way
to be melted.
A curious disease which has done
much damage to the tea crops of north
est India is known as “red rust.” An
account of the species of alga (Cepa
leuros virescens), which causes It, is
given by C. M. Hutchinson In the Me
moirs of the Agricultural Department
of India. It attacks the leaves and
stems of the tea plant, forming yellow
patches. It Is propagated by two kinds
of spores, one carried by water and the
other by air.
Francis Galton, who is now 86 years
old, studied surgery in the old daj's
before chloroform was used, and says
of the Birmingham hospital: “The cries
of the poor fellows who were operated
on were very characteristic; in fact,
each class of operation seemed to evoke
some peculiar form of them. All this
was terrible, but only at first. It seem
ed after a while as though the cries
were somehow disconnected with the
operation, upon which the whole atten
tion became fixed.”
At a luncheon given by the Lord

next to Beerbohm Tree. “Well, Mr.
Tree, what have you been doing to

deed,” said the dean, “and may I ask
what the bet was?” “I made a bet that

“Ah,” replied Dr. Welldon promptly,

An Interesting experiment has been
made by a Mr. Simpson of Port Eliza
beth, Cape Colony, in order to prove
that there is room for anew Industry
in South Africa. Mr. Simpson has be
come Impressed with the fact that pa
per might he cheaply manufactured
from the aloe, and to support his the
ory he has made a large sheet of paper.
He had no machinery, and therefore
the paper is somewhat loose grained.
But it is strong and of sufficiently good

right iu his contention.
The number of cremations in Great
Britain In 1906 was 732, an increase
of 138 as compared with the previous
year. In 1907 there were 705. The
number of crematories Is thirteen, of
which six are municipal. Cremation In
Great Britain is almost wholly confined
to persons of some Intellectual distinc
tion. The average citizen is still held
in the fetters of custom. Many persons
live in fear of being buried alive, and
make provision in their wills that a
doctor shall divide a main artery or
thrust a kulfe through the heart.
Women in the province of Shima, on
the southern coast of Japan, are the

work and are also employed as divers.
They enter the water at all seasons ex

winter. They remain under water some
times for more than a minute, and
bring up shellfish and tengusa, a kind
of seaweed, which they place In a small
net carried by each diver at the girdle.
These women divers are extremely
hardy, but as theirs Is a trying life
the constant exposure causes them to
age quickly.
Dr. C. W. Andrews of the geological
department of the British Museum has
started on a scientific expedition to
Christmas Island, in the Indian ocean.
Ten years ago the Island was unin
habited. Since then It has been opened
up, owing to Its guano deposits, and
there are now a number of persons
there. The object of the present visit is
to ascertain what effect the agency of
man has had on a native fauna and
flora. It is believed, for Instance, that
the native rat, which was found on the
island, has now been exterminated by
the Introduction of the common brown
rat of England.
A spirited controversy In Xew Zea

the one hand that It belonged to Kupe,
the famous Maori Columbus of the
South Seas, who discovered Xew Zea
land. On the other hand. It Is con
tended that it could not have been
Kupe’s, because It was found at Pare
mata, whereas Kupe landed at Palllser
bay, and must have left it on the shore
there when he turned his canoes up
side down at Martlnborough. There
are three mounds there which are sup
posed to have covered the canoes with

MS RULE EXPRESS.
Census Inquiry Shows Railway*

Stocks.
FIX RATES BY AGREEMENTS.
Six Leading Companies Dominate in
the Package Transportation
Business.
An investigation of the express busi
ness of the I’nited States has just been
completed by the census bureau of the
government, which covers all j (bases of
ihat business and shows in detail the
relations of the express companies with
the railroads of the country. It is
shown, for instance, that the railroads
of the country own more than one
fourth of the stock of the express com
panies and that, in turn, the express
companies own railroad stock to the
amount of more than 522.000.000. which
is also a figure in excess of one-fourth
of their own capitalization. The con
tracts between the companies and the
railroads are set forth as well as the
method of determining the rates.
In 1007 there were thirty-four ex
press companies as compared with eigh
teen in 1800. Only ten of the companies
reporting in 1800 were in existence un
der the same name in 1007: the remain
ing eight companies have gone out of
business, have been absorbed by other
companies or are operating under other
names. The total express mileage has
increased from 174,059 miles to 23-7.003
miles, a gain of 37.7 per cent.
Companies that Dominate.
In 1907 as in 1800 the express busi
ness was dominated by the following
companies: Adams. American, Pacific,
Southern, United States, and Wells,
Fargo & Cos. The last-mentioned leads
In the amount of mileage operated, with
the American Express Company a close
second. These six leading companies
operated 02.7 per cent of the total mile
age in 1890 and 87.7 per cent in 1007.
In the number of miles covered by
express companies Texas ranks first
among the States and territories, fol
lowed. in the order named, by Illinois,
lowa. Ohio. Pennsylvania, Xew York
and Kansas. The use of steamboat
lines is most extensive in Alaska,
where water routes furnish practically
the only facilities for transportation. In
Maine. Xew York, Washington and
Michigan the steamboat mileage is also
large. Electric roads are used by the
express companies in only twenty
States. Seventy-two per cent of the
total mileage by electric roads is in
Ohio. Xew York and California. In
only fifteen States are stage lines still
used by express companies, and 88.7
per cent of the mileage of such lines
Is in the \\ estern States, principally
California and Nevada.
Receipts anil Esiirmlilnre*.
The total receipts of all the express
companies amount to .$128,117,176, of
which 07 per cent is receipts from op
eration and 3 j>er cent receipts from
other sources. Over 00 per cent of the
total receipts represents the receipts
of the six leading companies. Two im
portant items of exjiense in the express
business arc the amounts paid to steam
roads and the salaries and wages,
which in 1!H)7 were $76,378,349 and
$30,531,774, respectively, and together
constituted, as in 1890, over SO per cent
of the reported operating expenses.
BIG APPLE CROP.
This Year's Growing Estimated to
Be About 25,000,000 Barrels
If the apple harvest in the commer
cial orchards of the United States this
year were converted into pies the army
of bakers needed to do the work would
turn out 6,270.000,000 of them, and
these placed side by side would make
a path of almost 077,000 miles.
The total weight of this mountain of
pastry is estimated at 9,210.000 pounds.
Including 6.127,000,000 pounds of flour,
lard and other ingredients used in the
popular American after-dinner dessert,
and would require 174.166 cars, of
standard capacity to transport them
from the ovens to the consumers.
Twenty-five million barrels, or 62.-
500.000 bushels, is the estimated yield
this season, according to reports receiv
ed by Harry J. Xeely. secretary of the
national apple show at Spokane, from
15.000 growers, operating the various
belts in the Union.
The returns show that while
droughts, excessive rains, or pests
wrought havoc in many districts in the
middle western, eastern aud several
southern States, the entire crop is fully
as large as in 1907 and it is better dis
tributed. Prices also are higher than
last year. However, the domestic sup
ply is smaller than at any time since
1897, for the reason that the demand of
the export trade is heavier and in
creasing yearly.
Rad KiuotioiiN Polnoiioon.
Dr. Landone, who plans to improve the
human race by Burbank's plant theories
in the rearing of children, in a recent
interview dwelt on the value of cultiva
ting love and cheerfulness and good
thoughts toward mankind. “For,” he
said, “the body is a substance composed
of chemicals and these chemicals are at
the mercy of the emotions. Anger, hatred
and sorrow poison the fluids of the body,
while love, cheerfulness and happiness
serve as eliminators of emotive and fa
tigue poisons.
The Tuberculosis Exhibit.
The international tuberculosis exhibi
tion which was first brought together at
great expense during the recent congress
of experts at Washington, has now been
moved to the Museum of Xatural His
tory at Xew York f *r the benefit of the
people of that city.
Nobel Prize to MetehnlkolT.
Prof. Metohnikoff. the Russian subdi
rector of the Pasteur Institute, who will
receive half the Xobe! prize this year for
medico-physiological research, announces
that he will devote the sum to further
study of means to promote longevity.
Work of Organized Charity.
The Charity Organization Society,
which operates in many different cities
from headquarters in Xew York, reports
that in the past year it carried 5,771
families at Xew York, compared to 3.336
families the year before. It is able to say
that it has not refused help to any fam
ily in need with notice. The report says
that the nationalization of social reform
movements is going on rapidly, and that
the organized Pittsburg survey, including
tie typhoid fever investigation, the study
of San Francisco relief work, of working
men’s insurance and of the placing out of
children, are some of the evidences of this
new spirit.

FIRE LOSSES ARE ENORMOUS.
Figures Show Big Increase Over
Those of Last Year.
The fire loss of the United States and
Canada for the month of October as com
piled from the carefully kept records of
tlie Journal of Commerce and Commercial
Bulletin, aggregates $22,722,880. The fol
lowing table giving the losses by months
for this year and the preceding tear af
fords a startling comparison, demonstrat
ing the unusually heavy fire waste of the
past few months:
mot. 1008.

October 13,350.250 22.728.850
Total $180,757,200 $208,758,750
It will be seen that, like September,
the month just closed exhibited an enor
mous increase of loss over the same month
in 1907. and that 1908 so far shows $28,-
000,000 more loss than for the first ten
months of 1097.
The month of October furnished no less
than 894 fires resulting in a loss of $lO,-

The Cornell educational special is the
first farm train to be sent out by the
New York State College of Agriculture.
Forty-five minute stops were made at
the smaller stations, and the subjects
chosen for the lectures were those adapt
ed to the products raised in the territory
covered. In the larger towns and cities
the boards of trade hired halls for the
speakers, and many people attended the
lectures. Schools were given a holiday to
enable students to attend.
In discussing the subject of refractory
children at the Congress of Neurologists
in session recently at (Jlient. Belgium, it
was generally admitted by physicians pres
ent that the refractory can not be cured
by repressive measures. “It is quite
possible.” said one. “to punish a child
into jail.” It was agreed that cast un
manageable children suffer from some
nervous disease and should he treated as
sick rather than as merely refractory.
Great stress was laid on the necessity of
developing the psychic faculties.

M'hile working in New York he said that
fully one-third of the ragged and dirty

Four hundred college men stood in the

times, heated discussion was precipi
tated over an amendment by Mr. Gil
lett, of Massachusetts, who sought to
have the temporary census force au
thorized by the bill with the excep
tion of a few minor positions, appoint
ed upon the basis of competitive instead
of non-competitive examinations.
The Senate held a short session
Thursday, during which an agreement
was reached for taking up the omnibus
claims Dill Monday with the under
standing that it shall not interfere with
the consideration of tin* postal savings
bill or any other measure in which
senators are especially interested. Aft
er a short executive session the Senate
adjourned until Monday in respect to
the memory of the late Representative
Charles T. Dunwell. of New York. At
no time was there a quorum in the
House. The legislative appropriation
bill was presented and several bflls
passed, among them being one author
izing the removal of the inqiogition of
loss of citizenship upon deserters in the
military and naval services. The rest
of the day was taken up in discussing
the bill to provide for the arbitrary in
vestigation of difficulties between em
ployers and employes.
The Senate was not in session Fri
day. In the House the legislative, ex
ecutive and judicial appropriation bill,
which usually excites considerable dis
cussion. lasting for several days, was
■passed with little debate and practi
cally in the shape in which it came
from committee. An unusual feature
was that no member asked for time to
indulge in general talk. The Dill car
ries an appropriation of $81.665.820.
The House, immediately after conven
ing. unanimously and without debate
adopted a resolution providing for the
appointment of a committee of five to
consider the reference to the secret
service in the President’s message, and
to suggest what action, if any. should
be taken in the matter.

CANAL IS UNDERMINED.
Difficulties from Water at Panama
Shown in Report of Commission.
With an average of 43.057 men on
the pay roil for the last fiscal year
and appropriations made to date of
$120,964,468.58 and ex jam dim res of
$84,572,998.55. both inclusive of the
original purchase price of the canal of
$40,000,000, the Panama canal construc
tion is making progress, according to
the annual rejiort of the isthmian canal
commission. Issued in Washington the
other day. One of the significant fea
tures of the report is the fact that it
is truly militaryesque in style. It makes
no guesses, but is confined to state
ments of historical fact which cannot
•be disputed or become subjects of con
troversy.
One of the interesting chapters of the
report is on the lock and dam construc
tion. In view of the reported break in
the Gatnn dam. the experience of the
commission in the construction of the
Sosa-Corosa 1 dam and the Gatnn locks
is important at this time as illustrat
ing the unexpected obstacles being met
with by the army engineers in charge of
the work. It was found necessary to
move the site of the Sosa-Corosal dam
when supposedly solid ground shifted.
In the former instance it became neces
sary to move the site of the dam be
cause of the shifting of the ground
when dumping was begun, and this de
spite the fact that the plans and speci
fictitious showed the foundation for the
projKised dam to be a solid base. Bor
ing at Gatnn. where the reported break
is alleged to have taken place recently,
plainly indicated the presence of un
derground water, but the engineers
were proceeding with the greatest con
fidence that the difficulty could be ob
viated and that the bottom was sound.
In the Culehra out division during

of the canal have been carried on in
conjunction with the work at this point
and. in addition thereto, it has been
necessary to take care of four large
landslides, one of which was an inherit
ance from the old French company and
amounted to 140.04 X) square yards.
Large excavations have also been made
at Empire City. Empire Hill. Gold Hill
and the Pedro Miguel lock site.

Woman Han Boon Scsterlne TyphoK
Bornu for Fifioen Month*.
Mary Mallen. who was taken to
North Brother Island fifteen months ago
as being infected with typhoid germs
and a Ganger to the city, is still con
fined there under observation, says the
New York Tribune. She was first
heard from on Long Island. A sporadic
outbreak of typhoid fever occurred
there, which was traced to her. She
got away, but when an outbreak oc
curred in a family in another town it
was found that Mary Mallen was the
cook there. She left the place and an
other outbreak in another town was
traced to her.
Mary Mullen, according to the physi
cians. was infected with the germ with
out being All, giving out the bacilli and
infecting members of the families
where she worked through the food.
It was not until a family in this bor
ough where she was employed as c<H>k
was stricken with the disease that offi
cials of the health department decided
to take a hand. She was taken to
North Brother Island, where an exam
ination revealed that she was thorough
ly infected with the germs.
Since the woman's detention exam
inations have been made daily, but
while she would on some days seem to
be free from the bacilli the next day
the germs would be found in large
numbers. The health department in
structed the officials at the island to
discharge her if she was found to b
free from the germs for two successive
days, but for 400 days this condition
has not been met, and unless some
method of driving the bacilli out of
Mary Mallen"s system is found her de
tention may be for an indefinite period.

and Castor OH!
Why take sickening salts or repulsive
castor oil? “Goes through you like a
dose of salts” means violence, grips, gripes, gases,
soreness, irritation, and leaves your stomach and bowels
weak and burnt out. Might just as well take concen
trated lye. Then there’s castor oil, disgusting, nauseat
ing truck that your stomach refuses unless you disguise
the taste. Fool your own stomach, eh? Don’t ever
believe that anything offensive to your taste or smell is
going to do you real good. Nature makes certain
things repulsive, so you will not take them. Force
yourself to nauseous doses, and you ruin your digestion,
weaken your bowels, destroy your health.
