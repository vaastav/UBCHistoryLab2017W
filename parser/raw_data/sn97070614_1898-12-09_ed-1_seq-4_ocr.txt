THE OWOSSO TIMES.
KDMUND O. DKWKY, Editor.
TEN PAGES.
OWOSSO. FRIDAY, DEC. 9, 1898.
From time to time it has been point
ed out by the city papers that large
sums of money have been lost to the
business men of Owosso by the long
delay in getting the Main street bridge
into position and the barricaded condi
tion of business streets where paving
was done, and doubtless every word
was true. Incidentally, too. the con
tractors, committee men, council, etc.,
have come in for repeated proddings
and reminders of the gn-at loss that the
delay and inconvenience were causing
the city in a business way and it must
be admitted that there have been de
lays which seemed unnecessary and
some movements which seemed badly
planned. Ho far, all very well. Of
ficials and contractors are both human
and are open to criticism. But there
are other ways of injuring the trade of
the city which seemingly do not have
as good an excuse as do the above in
the present instance.
And if there is any more successful
way of driving away trade from the
city and of keeping parents in a con
stantly alarm than by continually and
persistently attempting to prove that
there is an epidemic of some sort in the
city The Times for one does not know
what it is. Suppose an item were
printed saying that an epidemic of
small pox prevailed in the city! How
many hundreds of dollars a day would
the city lose in trade as long as the
falsehood remained unchallenged? But
precisely the same thing occurs, though
on a smaller scale, when assertions are
made that there is an epidemic of diph
theria in the city. And now it is very
respectfully submitted to those papers
which are ever ready to rebuke official!
or contractors but which seem to take
a childish delight in spreading stories
of epidemics of various kinds, that their
anxiety to make an epidemic out of a
few scattered cases diphtheria seems
to be the favorite disease has probably
driven away as many hundred dollars
worth of business from Owosso mer
chants as has delay in placing the Main
street bridge or the torn up condition of
the city streets during the paving, and
all this, in spite of the fact that this
city is as healthful as any in the state
and in spite of the fact that at no time
have there been any more cases of diph
theria in the city than any other city of
its size has the most of the time with
out working itself into a fright about
it. Yet it occasionally seems that certain
papers actually go out of their way to
attempt to spread abroad a report that
there is an epidemic in this city, with
every such attempt driving away froru
the business men the dollars they seem
so worried about in other cases.
There may be good reasons for tiro
condition of both bridge and streets.
There might be some excuse too, for
printing such items if there was even
any good reason to fear that an epi
demic was so much as threatening the
city. But under the circumstances, to
solicit business men's advertising in one
department, and then to turn around
and deliberately or stupidly scare away
trade by such rank nonsense in another
department is an imposition upon the
whole city, and is the raukest kind of
robbery, since for the sake of a petty
news item they cheat the merchant out
of tiie very tidrlg they are taking pay
from him to help secure for him.
No epidemic exists or has exisited in
this city this fall. If the time ever
comes and there is no reason to expect
that it will when an epidemic of diph
theria or any other virulent or malig
nant disease ae ually exists hero the
public should le wm ned Until then it
may be suggested that such silly, trade
killing items as the one in Wednesday's
Argus and numerous others wit h w 1 1 i h
the public has become too familiar, bo
left imprinted.

Troy (N. Y.) Record.
The indications are that Gov. Pingree Is
about ready to act upon the suggestions of
those who opposed the Atkinson bill two
years ago and whom he has since repeat
edly denounced and maligned that the
charters of certain roads must be repealed
before any general railroad taxation bill
can be enacted which will be constitutional.
If Gov. Pingree had been willing to accept
advice or admit that the ideas of otbert
than himself were right, the taxation ques
tion so far as the legislature is concerned
would have been settled at the special ses
sion. One of the neatest books, both in point of
typography and in binding illustrating, and
paper, which have ever been presented to
us under the name of a school book is a lit
tle volume published by the American Book
Co., of New York and Chicago, in its list of
eclectic school readings. It Is called the
"Story of Caesar," and reads like a novel.
The writer M. Clarke, has drawn largely
from Caesar's own clear cut commentaries
as well as from various recent historical
writers, but everywhere the language S so
plain and simple that it requires no effort to
read it while it is so arranged that one event
after another in the great emperor's life
comes on in easy, natural, yet facinating,
succession until Caesar seems as real to one
as Dewey, Sampson, or Miles and Shaffer
and you cannot help wondering, before you
think when he really lived, why he did not
have the big breech loading cannon, the
rapid fire guns or the Krag- Jorgensen rifles
of the latter with bis armies. Then you
wonder what he wouldn't have done if be
had had them and think perhaps it was
just as well for the rest of the world that he
didn't. It is a facinating bit of history and
if it is a fair sample of the American Book
Co's. Eclectic School Readings, they are cer
tainly on the right track. Besides the sim
ple language used, the book is well filled
with wood cuts, full page half tone engrav
ings and two good maps.
What the Postal Statistics Show.
The statistics given in the annual report
of the Postmaster General afford proof of
the greatly increased prosperity visible in
the year ending June 30, 1898. Tde gen
eral business of the department shows an
increase of over $6,000,000 in the last fiscal
year. In all departments of the service the
influence of prosperous times has made it
self apparent. The number of domestic
money orders issued in the year was 27,798
078, as against 25,169,055 in the previous
year; the amount carried was $191,354,
121, as agaiust $174,482,676 of the previous
year. There has been an increase of 2,358
in the number of new money order offices
established in the year.
It is in the increase of nearly $17,000,000
in the transmission of small sums through
the post offices that the truj index of aug
mented prosperity among people of moder
ate means is to be louud. The postal statis
tics furnish eloquent testimony as to the
improvement wrought in the first eleven
months of restored protection.
Helloes Increasing in Number.
The Owosso Telephone Co. continues to
grow so fast that Manager R. W. Crawford
finds difficulty in getting phones in place
fast enough with the assistance of four men.
Within the last few days the following new
contracts have been secured and the most of
the phones are already up ready for use;

The Ann Arbor Ry. put Itself flatly on
on record Monday when under orders of
General Manager Ashley the Bell phone
was taken out of the Ann Arbor freight
house in this city. Mr, Ashley pronounces
himself as bemg heartily in favor of sup
poiiing hi me industries and apparently
believes that Owofmi business men are mak
ing an unnecessary burden for themselves
by keeping any phone other than the Owos
so Telephone Co's. The example will tiot
be without Its effect.
A large amount of work has been done in
Coruuna within the last two or three Weeks
where an almost new exchange has been
put in by Manager K VV. Crawford of the
Owosso company. The Coriinna oftire Is a

The holiday bazaai glveu by the ladles of

become one of the most attractive events of
the season. For weeks before the date of

that of past years and no pains have been
spared to make this a social as well as a fi
nanclal success. The bazaar will be open

various articles being on sale from that
hour. And from five to eight one of their
famous individual chicken pie sappers will
be served for twenty cents.
In the fancy work department can be
found dolls, handkerchiefs, pin cushions,
sofa cushions and many beautiful articles
which would be nice for Christmas pre
sents. The domestic department will be filled
rwitb work aprons, laundry and darning
bags, comfortables, holders etc., and Mc
Glnty will surely lend his presence and also
John Chinaman.
The linen booth will abound in lovely
pieces of embroidery and battenburg.
A choice collection of hand painted china
will be on sale.
The candy and sherbet booths presided
over by the young ladies, will be another
attractive feature. The bazaar will con

Visit of the Detroit Merchants.
The representatives of the Detroit busi
ness men who were entertained by the
Owosso business men for about two hours
Friday afternoon went away well pleased
with their visit in this city and quite im
pressed with the city like improvements
displayed here.
The party was met in St. Johns by C. D
Stewart, G. T. Campbell and E O. Dewey
and on arrival in Owosso, was driven about
the city In carriages before being taken to
the armory where after a few minutes
spent In general conversation they were
called to order by Mr. Jamns Osbu-n.
Mayor Kerwln then delivered an address
of welcome and President Armstrong, of
the Detroit Exchange fesponded.
The party soon dispersed among the va
nous business houses of the city where
they made closer acquaintances than they
otherwise could have done. At five o'clock
they left for Flint where they took supper.
During the stop at Owosso large handsome
roses were distributed among the visitors
who pronouncd them the finest flowers
which they had received on the trip. The
effect of the visit cannot fall to be good.

a small amount being held back until the
