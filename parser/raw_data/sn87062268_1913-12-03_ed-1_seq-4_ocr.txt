A Remarkable
i
Presidential Message.
S President 'Wilson's message delivered
fct the opening of the regular session of
ths sixty-third congress yesterday ,ls
remarkable in two respects first, for
Sta fcrevlty; second, for the direct and
JemstltSrfi manner In which, the head of
"rtb ropuMl'cT finals with the important
krae&tioBS now; &efore the American
people'.
The president's views on the pending
currency Question are courteously ex
pressed, but he leaves no doubt as to
what he expects the senate to do and
hwhen he expects it to be done. It Is
jjuiter likely that the senate will not
reoulre any further recommendation
from the chief executive on this subj
'fleet.
The treatment of the Huerta Tegime
for, as the president says, Mexico
has no government is about as force
ful as the English language could make
It, and it voices, we have no doubt,
i the sentiments and convictions of the
! American people.
j Our treaty objects and obligations,
,ta.nd our Philippine policy, are both ad
' mlrably stated. The tribute paid to
the state department for its success in
Effecting the numerous peace treaties
mlreaxly ratified Is a deserved one, and
the expressed policy of permitting the
Philippines, to work out their own in
dependence is in marked contrast to
the Imperialistic tendency of the pre
Vious administrations.
That the trust question the preven
tion of private monopoly is to be the
paramount question before congress
after'the currency bill has been dis
posed of, 'the president makes thor
oughly clear. And this question of
private monopoly is to be handled, not
by the. repeal or abrogation of any ex
isting law, but by the addition where
necessary of enactments that will make
the present law more effective. Ob-
viously the trusts have nothing to hope
for from President "Wilson.
The president's demand for an em
ployer's liability act is in thorough ac
cord with progressive sentiment every
where and it ought to be given the at
tention it deserves.
The proposal that the government
tshall build and operate a system of
i-railroads in Alaska and control the
t ports and terminals of that rich terri
tory for the use of all of the people
"Will meet violent opposition by the
t special Interests, but the president's
1 position In the matter is one of the
strongest features of his message.
The recommendation of a system of
direct primary nominations for the
presidency and the abolition of nomi-
Hating conventions is another strong
" feature of the message, and congress
should, enact the proposed legislation
s before the session adjourns. This is
smother matter that special interest
f , politicians will oppose, but with pro
: gxessive democracy in the saddle there
! ought to be no difficulty in putting the
S recommendation into effect in time for
f th nominations of 1916.
Altogether, we believe President Wil
. con's message, brief though it is, will
ro down in history as one, of the
greatest state documents ever submit
ted. It puts into words the sentiments
of a great people and the latter's rep
resentatives in congress will do well to
heed the advice contained therein.
Our language exhibits many verbal
I curiosities ; for instance, when a young
; man decides to stop sowing his wild
oats and settles down th first thing
he does generally is to settle tip his
debts. Tampa Times.
Yes. and when he pays his hotel bill
' the clerk tells him he is now square
end asks him when he will be 'round
again. -
How To Abate the Fertilizer
Plant Nuisance.
Yesterday morning The Journal sug
gested that the state board of health
should proceed to get rid of the fish
fertilizer plant nuisance north of the
city.
We are now advised, however, that
the state board has no authority in
the premises but that the justice of the
peace in whose district the nuisance is
located Is the proper official to whom
complaints should be made. The fol
lowing state law Is cited:
All nuisances which tend to annoy
the community, or injure the health of
the citizens generally, or to corrupt
the public morals, shall be indictable
and punishable by a fine not exceeding
two hundred, dollars at the discretion
of the court, and any nuisance which
tends to the immediate annoyance of
the citizens in -general, or is manifest
ly injurious to the public health and.
safety or tends to corrupt the manner
and morals of the people may be re
moved and suppressed by the order of
the justice of the peace of the district
founded upon the verdict of twelve
householders of the same, who shall
be summoned, sworn and Impaneled
for that purpose, which order shall
be directed to, and executed by any
sheriff or constable of the county, ana
an Indictment shall lie for the same.
This all being the case, any 12 citi
zens of the district Including Brent,
Ferry Pass, and the city of Pensacola
may be summoned byv Justice TV. I
Johnson, pronounce the verdict and
have the nuisance abated.
If 12 .citizens who are ready to do
this will just send their names to The
Journal, this paper will take pleasure
in presenting the list to Judge John
son, who will no doubt issue the order
as authorized by the law.
If as many as 12 citizens do not want
the nuisance abolished, they can simp
ly say nothing and keep on smelling.
, .
Just as an "example of the eternal
unfitness of a thing the liquor inters
ests are reported as to be praying be
fore Judge Wolfe in South Florida,
.
Some Excellent Street
Regulations.
Mobile has adopted some excellent
street regulations and restrictions and
the chief of police issues the following
notice concerning them:
Don't cross down town Intersections
diagonally, by cutting the corners.
Don t fail to keep to the right when
driving an auto or wagon or walking.
Don't cut to the left with auto when
rounding street intersection.
Don't fail to get clear signal from
traffic officer before crossing street in
tersection. Don't fail to heed these Instructions,
or the traffic officer will get you.
These rules are good and they
should be applied in crowded streets
everywhere. , In this time of increasing
street traffic and particularly with the
increasing number of motor , vehicles,
it is important that common sense
traffic regulations should be provided
and observed. The only wonder is
that more accidents do not occur in
all cities.
.
New Jersey woman ICO years old
says to God belongs the credit. Such
an admission probably means she has
had a long but uninteresting life.
"Little "Women" at the opera house

FLORIDA'S CAMPAIGN FOR
UNITED STATES SENATOR
Not Right Kind.
Any man who would retain a Repub
lican like Lorimer or Joe Lee in office
for a holy minute Isn't the right kind
of a Democrat to represent Florida
in the United States senate. Arcadia
Enterprise.
Little Premature.
The Pensacola News thinks Senator
Fletcher was a little premature in sa
luting Gov. Blease of South Carolina as
his future colleague, since there is no
certainty that either will be elected.
Orlando Sentinel. '
Has Way of Winning.
Gilchrist long ago achieved an
unique fame for unique campaign me
thods, and he has already evolved some
unique new ones for his latest cam
paign. And of most interest to the
other fellows, no doubt, is the unique
way he has had of always winning.
St. Petersburg Times.
Gilchrist's Promise.
Gov. Gilchrist, in making his formal
announcement for the senate, says: "I

for me." Oh, that little word "If."

HOW TO
SAV
YOUR EYES
Try This Free Prescription.
Do your eyes give you trouble?
Do you already wear eyeglasses or
spectacles? Thousands of people
wear these "windows . who mignt
easily dispense with them. You may
be one of these and it is your duty
to save your eyes before it is too
late. The eyes are , neglected more
than any other organ of the entire
body. After you finish your day's
work you. sit down and rest your
muscles, but how about your eyes?
Do you rest them? You know you
do not. You read or do something
else that keeps your eyes busy; you
work your eyes until you go' to bed.
That Is why so many have strained
eyes and finally other eye troubles
that threaten partial or total blind
ness. Eyeglasses are merely crutches;
they never cure. This free prescrip
tion which has benefited the eyes of
so many may work equal wonders
for you. Use It a short time. Would
you like your eye troubles to disap
pear as if by magic?- Try this pre
scription: Go to the nearest wide
awake drug store and get a bottle of
Optona tablets; fill a two-ounce bot
tle with water, drop in one tablet and
allow to thoroughly dissolve. With
this liquid bathe the eyes two to four
times daily. Just note how quickly
your eyes clear up and how soon the
inflammation will disappear. Don't
be afraid to use it; it is absolutely
harmless. Many who are now blind
might have saved their eyes had they
started to care for them in time.
This is a simple treatment but mar
velously effective in multitudes of
cases. Now that you have been warned
don't delay a day, but do what you
can to save your eyes and you are
likely to thank us as long as you
live for publishing this prescription. .

Let Private Affairs Alone.

time, in our opinion, notwithstanding

ity of England." DeLand Record.
"Pure rot" is the above. The other
juide of It is "the nobility of England"
marrying into a good laonaa family.
Let a man's private affairs those of
his nearest and dearest alone in po
litical scraps. Tell us why Mr. Fletch
er should not be returned, and why
the other man should supplant him.

MIAMI PEOPLE LIKE
JUDGE J. EMMETT WOLFE
Miami Metropolis,
The Metropolis has commented with
approval upon the new Florida law,
which provides that at their first
meeting in January
county commissioners
counties make up a list of citizens of
unquestioned integrity to serve as ju
rymen when summoned.
So disgusted have we been with the
long-standing custom in Dade county
of picking up any sort of a fellow
for jury duty that we have hailed with
hearty praise the coming new law. and
here it seems that there has nover
been any need of imposing street loaf
ers, rum-soaks and gamblers upon the
justice-seeking people.
Judge Wolfe orders the court offi
cers to go out and bring in business
men of known respectability for jury
service. The officer replies, with sur
prise at the seeming impudence, that
they won't come that they always of
fer excuses, etc. The judge replies that
it is the officer's duty to serve the
papers for their appearance his. the
duty to determine whether excuses for
not serving are acceptable.
A simple solution, most certainly.
And the interesting part of it is that
Judge Wolfe is wholly to be relied
upon to not accept excuses that are
mere duty-dodgers; he is not on the
bench to make friends or to curry
favor, he is there to do his work as a
trusted administrator of the law, ex
pediting the usual tedious meander
ings of lawyer-tactics and refusing to
grant postponements and continuances
that are palpably offered as a means
of thwarting justice.
Judge Wolfe's presiding over Dade's
circuit court has been an appreciated
experience for everybody who has fol
lowed the course of the court's busi
ness thus far. With a wit as keen as
a rapier's edge and discernment like
that of a seer, both coupled with legal
ability, of an exceptionally high order,
he has given both lawyers and lay
men something to think of during his
sojourn here.

adjourned today until Friday next.
The adjournment, according to counsel
for Zelaya, was taken at the request
of authorities at Washington.
Extradition papers not having ar
rived from Nicaragua, the prisoner's
examination in extradition proceedings,
to have been held today, was also ad
journed until Friday night.
LAWYERS WANTED DELAY.
Washington, Dec 1. Postponement
of today's hearing' in the Zelaya case
was at the instance of Zelaya's counsel
here, to afford Solicitor Folk of the
state department, an opportunity to
pass upon allegations that the project:
to secure the extradition of Zelaya is
political and that certain financial in
terests are involved in an attempt to
suppress activities or the late presi
dent. There was a suggestion among coun
sel in the case today that the proceed
ings might be dropped if Zelaya would
agree to return to Barcelona, Spctin.
It was said that the Nicaraguan gov
ernment would be satisfied if assur
ance were given that Zelaya would not
be permitted to gain a foothold where
he would be able to foment trouble in
the scenes of his former activities.
GARMENT WORKER SHOT.
