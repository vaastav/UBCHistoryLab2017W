(WESTERN backers DRAW OUT
fe)astern Bunch. Didn't Come to the
Front, So Milwaukee Men
Have Gait in Dis f
gust.
- MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. 4.— Disgusted
with the failure of th e Eastern men to •
qualify, the Western backers of the Na
tional association have withdrawn from
the field and will make no more efforts
this season to organize a league which
[they intended to rival the National league
on the diamond next season. y .
The Milwaukee men who have been
-backing the new association said today
■that they had taken down their forfeit,
their collateral having been returned to
them by the Baltimore Trust company, j
Which had b3en constituted the holder !
of the money and securities put up at j
.the Baltimore meeting last September.
Tho .Milwaukee men have been patient- ;
ly waiting for F. C. Richter, of Philadel- ;
ph:a, to make good, but the defection of ,
McGraw to the American league and the ■
failure of Tommy McCarthy to hold h's i
[Boston grounds, robbed them of their i
ambition to shine as magnates, and they I
Announced this afternoon that, they i
"Would not spend another cent to organise !
the circuit, but would await the action ]
of the men in the East before they i
Rvould "renew their efforts. *
"It is up to the men in the East to j
"make their promises good to organize !
their circuit," said Joseph D O'Brien to- I
night, "and until they can show us that j
they re soiid financially and have their i
grounds leased, we are out of the deal "
for good. McGraw threw us down and j
■spoiled our Eastern circuit by going with j
*" Baltimore to the American league, and i
the failure of McCarthy to hold his j
grounds in Boston placed a quietus on !
the movement to organize the National j
association. The Milwaukee men who j
have been back of the movement spent j
*-& great deal of money and time in try
ing to place the association on its feet
and give the people a real, live opposi
tion league to the National league, which
has been enjoying a monopoly of the
{business. We have done more than our
•share of the work so far and put up our
money to show that we meant business,
oil'! as a result we have four cities in
the west prepared to go ahead at short
notice, prepare grounds for ball playing,
and sign the best players in the country, j
While in the east only Philadelphia and
[Washington are financed and have op
tions on property that can be prepared
for bail playing before spring."
C. S. Havenor, the Milwaukee alderman
•who proposed to finance the new Chicago
club in the association, and had an op
tion as well as a lease of the old Con
. gress baseball park in that city, said he
Was through with the association until
the Eastern men came to time. "I put
up my money at the Baltimore meeting
to show my good faith, and spent the
money necessary to secure an option on
the Congress street grounds in Chicago
for my ball park, the lease being com
plete with the exception of my signa
ture, which I withheld until I was fully j
Convinced that, the people in the East
meant business. So far we have spent
our money freely to promote the inter
ests of baseball and the organization of
the National association, but we can-
not "proceed alone and shoulder all the
work as well as the expense, and now I I
have drawn my forfeit down, prepared
"■ a wait what the Eastern men have to
say."
A. 11. Koch, a Milwaukeean, who se
ct' an option on a piece of property
§ la i summer in Philadelphia, before the
Baltir.iijre meeting was held, with a j
view to placing a team in Philadelphia,
confirmed the statements cf O'Brien and
Havenor. "The reports I had from Bos
*ton ahcut -McCarthy alter McGrew an- j
*" nou ;. i that he would identify himself '■
_ with the American league, convinced me j
that the outlook way poor for "-placing: j
the association on a sound financial basis, j
Bo I withdrew my portion of the fund j
raised, at Baltimore to organize the as- i
sociation," said Koch. "If we had pro- j
ceeded I low that Boston would have
:b?.en a detriment tor lack of funds.
There tore, 1 am cut of the deal until
.. the E;ist i .in show me that it not only
has the money to proceed, but grounds
. secured as well. We placed too much
confidence in McGraw. and the Baltimore
people, nnd their defection hurt the
. .chances 'if our success."

Billiard Tournament.
NEW YORK, Dec. '4.—Three games
, have now been played in the A. A. U.
billiard championship contest, which be
gan at Knickerbocker club last* evening.
The afternoon game was between two lo
cal players. A. D. Ferguson and Louis
A. Servatius, and the former won by
twenty-three points in 300 tip at the
14 balk inch line game.
The players tonight were Frank Bille
ter, a newcomer, from Minneapolis, Minn.,
and Samuel G. Estabrook. of local fame.
The Western player won the bank and
took the initiative, and made three scores.
Estabrook took the lead and kept ahead
of the visitor until the fifteenth inning,
v hen they were tied at 57. Beginning |
with the 27th inning Billeter began to |
take a decisive lead, and finally;' won out !
with a margin of 81 points in 300. The j
men were both confident and met with a ;
good deal of hard "leaved." Both sig- ,
j nalized their knowledge of the game !
iby open and cushion plays. Billeter but
pr s-d the spectators frequently with some i
I of his fearless efforts, which in the main <
proved remunerative Both men had |
I hard luck at times, and numerous "lay j
| ups" which faced them were sufficient
I to make many a professional weaken.
:. On his showing tonight Billeter will
j mere than hold his own with many of
'. those who will cross cues in the final
| matches two weeks hence.

FOR THE CANADA CUP. .
Changes in Race Conditions Sug
gested at Tcironto. r
TORONTO, Dae. Several char:;
. were suggested in the conditions of the j
race for the Canadian cup at a meeting I
last night of the challenge committee of |
the Royal Canadian Yacht club. The mest i
important was a clause that a referee be I
appointed to watch the construction ot i
! the yachts, the selection to ba made be_ I
I fore Jan. 1, 1901. Points of construction j
must be referred to the referee, his de- I
cision to be final in all cases. Mr. Ste- I
yens, editor of the Forest and Stream,
was suggested as referee.
Another change is that the races tak* !
place on Lake Michigan, the first one to- j
be on the fourth Saturday in August, and j
one on every succeeding day, except Sun- I
day, until the winner is decided, the
best three in five to decide. Two boats
will be built in Toronto, and Hamilton
will turn out another challenger.

DONE AT YESTERDAY'S CONFAB
District Delegations Canvassed the
r Senatorial and Minor Fights in
Caucuses Yesterday After
— noon and Evening.
The speakership contest- is substantial
ly closed and it now seems .-' certain that
"Michael J. Dowling, of Renville, will
wield the gavel in the lower house of
the coming legislature. " The action of
the Second. Third and . Sixth districts in
indorsing Dowling at their caucuses yes
terday, put an end to the fight and gave
Dowling a lead in the race that will be
hard, if not impossible, to overcome.
BERG CONCEDES IS DEFEAT.
Shortly before the contest ended Albert
Berg, recognizing that his chances as a
competitor in the race were nil, an?
nounced that he had withdrawn. The
announcement of Berg at the eleventh
hour, created but little stir in the busy
circles of politicians who had gathered
to help bring about the climax of Dowl
ing's success .and who had known for
some days past, that Albert might as
well '-lay down., as he was clearly out of
the race."
It is not probable that Dowling will
have to meet another candidate, though
it Is intimated in some circles that Berg
and his friends would throw their in
fluence to the man who would have the
nerve to place himself upon this rack.
Berg wanted the speakership as badly
as he ever wanted anything and he did
not leave a stone unturned whose under
side he thought might in any way aid
his candidacy. He had a few friends
who also exhausted their political re
sources in his behalf, but it was plainly
evident that Berg was not in the fight
from the" start. It is only reasonable to
suppose that after putting up the most
determined and vigorous fight within his
power and meeting .utter defeat, Berg
does not entertain- the most kindly feel
ings for the success of his opponent and
it would not be surprising if he and his
supporters would help another candidal-!,
could one be induced to enter the race
at this, or a later stage of the game.
Yesterday afternoon at the "Windsor the
delegations from the Second and Third
districts met and caucused on the speak
ership and took some action regarding
Senator Nelson's candidacy, and those of
minor office seekers. . Dowling was in
dorsed by both delegations. Both also re
affirmed their loyalty to Nelson, and in
their resolutions advocated his election
by the legislature before the contest for
the senate to fill Senator Davis' position
came up. Neither district committed it
self to the support of any particular
candidate for this latter place. The
Second manifested a sentiment divided
between Gen. Clapp and R. G. Evans,
with slight odds, perhaps, in favor of the
latter. At both meetings J. A. Schmahl,
for chief clerk, and Ed. Fanning, for ser
geant-at-arms, were indorsed.
* * »
The Sixth district delegation met at the
Merchants last night. First there was a
joint meeting of the senate and house
delegations and then the house members
went into a continued session. Dowling
was unanimously indorsed by the Sixth
district people. It was - not until . last
night at this meeting, however, that
George R. Laybourn, of Duluth, actually
withdrew from the race for speakership.
It was learned after the meeting that Mr.
Laybourn's case received general discus
sion, and in'view of the action of the
other districts rallying unitedly to . the
support of Dowling, rendering his can
didacy practically invincible, the decision
was reached that nothing remained for
the Duluthian but to clear the field. Mr.
Laybourn had substantially done this
himself several days ago, and had his
delegation met earlier in the" day the
same final action on his part would have
been confirmed by the united action of
the delegation."
Like their colleagues in the Second and
Third the members of the Sixth district
delegation also enacted a set of resolu
tions, declaring their allegiance to Sena
tor Kuno Nelson. They did not, how
ever, like the others, take any official
action as to the order in which the sena
tors should be voted for. No polling of
the delegation was taken on the second
senatorship, and expression of sentiment
were lacking upon this proposition after
the meeting. .
The Sixth district people gave their
support to Julius Schmahl for chief clerk,
Ed Vanning for sergeant-at-arms and G.
H. Spear, of Krainerd, for first assistant
clerk. The delegation, seventeen in
number, was represented by all except
Messrs. N. K. Hunt, Frank Swanson and
E F. Alford, who were absent,
* * *
At the meeting of the senate commit
tee of - this delegation James A. Martin,
of St. Cloud, was given a very hearty
indorsement for his old position of clerk
of the judiciary committee, of which
Senator Young is chairman. The action
of the delegation was entirely independ
ent of the solicitation of Mr. Martin who
had refrained from any activity in behalf
of this course. Chairman Young and
all the other" members of the judiciary
committee in the senate, seventeen in all,
have expressed their approval of Mr.
Martin's services in the past and de
clared themselves as urgently favoring
his reappointment.

Frank A. Holcomb, of St.* Paul, wants

Duluth is talking of landing the post

not in sight. - I
* * *
Ramsey county house members got to
gether in their headquarters at the Mer
chants last night to talk over the sena
torial situation, but were interrupted and
finally prevented from accomplishing any
thing. They - will probably meet again
very soon, and make up their minds as
to a candidate.
* * *
P. J. Sjcblom may not be able to land
the place of assistant secretary of state
now- held by J. J. Lomen.
* * •
Now that Dowling has distanced his
competitors in 'the speakership race he
is being eagerly sought by candidates
and friends of- candidates for Senator
Davis' place." J. H. Shevlin and Robert
G. Evans both approached Mr. Dowling
yesterday in behalf of * their respective
interests, and their friends were after
him iater in the day. To both Shevlin
i and Evans Dowling gave the same state-"
ment. He positively declined to commit
himself to the support cf any one until
he is seated in. the chair as the speaker
of the next house with his gavel of au

death of Cushman K. Davis Minnesota
has lost a son of whom she wag-justly
proud; whose ability, perseverance and
industry has tended, .more than t'nat of
any other man, to place our state in the
front rank in the councils of the nation;
and whose moral courage in times when
others wavered gave stability to our in
stitutions; whose splendid achievements
not only shed lustre upon the common
wealth, but gave a pre-eminence to the
city which was, his home.i and, "'' ' :; ;
Be it further resolved. That a copy of
these resolutions be transmitted to the
bereaved widow, as a token of the es- ,
teem in which the Commercial club held
Senator Davis, as a citizen, as a states
man, and, above all. as a friend. r

; TRANS-ISTHMIAN CANAL. -
v • COMMISSION 7,
COST WILL BE $200,540,000
According to Present Estimate
Advantages of the Nicaragua
Ronte as Compared "With
That Via Panama. -
- WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The- report of
the Isthmian canal commission, submit
ted | to ;'' congress today, ; gives as the
unanimous ' conclusion: of that body that
"the : most practical and feasible route
for an Isthmian canal under the control,"
management and ownership j of the
'United States, is that known as the Ni
caragua route. '.'■
.The commission estimates the cost of
this route at $200,540,000. This estimate
is much in excess of -any heretofore made
and is due .to increased dimensions and
other features not heretofore considered.
The commission also estimates the cost
of a canal by the Panama route at $142,
--342,579, according to one route, or $156,
--375,255, according to another route. As
between the Nicaragua . and Panama
route, the commission sums up a number
of advantages favorable to the former.
It states also that under the. concessions
given by the Colombian government to
the Panama Canal company, that govern
ment not free to grant the necessary
rights to the United States, except upon
conditions made by the ; company. The
report is a document of about 17,000
words, almost as long as the president's,
message. Although the work of the
commission' is not yet completed, many of
the field parties still being out, yet it
has been sufficiently . advanced to make
it practicable to present this preliminary
report, giving the essential findings. A
thorough investigation has been made
not only of the Nicaragua and Panama
routes, but of other possible routes, the
commission keeping in mind the in
dustrial and commercial value.,of the
canal, also the eight privileges and "fran
chises necessary to be secured for the con
struction of a canal under the control,
management and ownership of the United
States. In all thirty-one working parties
were organized and sent into the field,
making a force of about 220 engineers
and assistants, besides about 600 laborers,
boatmen and other workmen employed
in the various countries, a total of more
than 800. Meanwhile the members of the
commission personally conducted various
branches of the work. One party went to
Paris, where they examined the details
of the Panama canal project, being
executed by the French company.
A detailed description is given of the
trip over the several routes. '< -
FAVORED BY NICARAGUA.
Along the Nicaragua route, it was
found that the short section of partially
constructed canal is, perhaps, in as good
shape" today as it was- when the work
was stopped. The buildings, however,
are all rotten, and the dredges, boats,
etc., are worthless. The commission
visited President Zelaya and other lead
ing officials of Nicaragua and found them
greatly interested in the project. The
occupation of their territory by the
United States for canal purposes, did not
seem to be regarded as a serious ob
stacle, provided Jthe sovereignty of the
republic was respected. Along the Pana- ,
ma route the commission found a large ,
force of workmen engaged upon the
canal line, about 2,000 in number, accord- j
ing to the Panama company. The canal ,
had been opened to some extent at both j
ends. Immense quantities of machinery, i
implements and tools were found along
the route. Much of this property, the j
commission reports, is - ill-adapted to j
American methods of work, and all of
it is now from thirteen to twenty years
old, so that no value should be given to
the plant now on.the Isthmus. A visit ;
was also made to President Iglesias, of j
Costa Rica, and his cabinet, and a strong
sentiment found to exist for ah Ameri
can canal along the Nicaragua route.
Trips were also made along the Darien
route.
After .going over the several routes,
the committee considered the dimensions
of the canal to be built. Having in
mind the increasing size of ocean-going
vessels, it was determined to fix upon a
depth of thirty-five feet at mean low wa
ter, and a bottom width of .150 feet, with
some Increase of dimensions at certain
points. These dimensions are larger than
those proposed for any previous canal
scheme. While they may seem excessive
today, the commission points out that
the canal is not likely to be opened
within ten years, during which time the
increase in maritime dimensions is likely
to continue. A width of 150 feet will al
low all but the very largest ships to pass
each other in the canal, while -the locks
are of a dimension to permit even the
largest ships afloat to be maneuvered.
The size of the locks is 740 feet length,
8-1 feet width, in the clear, with a depth
of 35 feet.
The final, conclusions of the commission
are stated. as follows:
' SUMMARY OF THE REPORT.
"1. The estimated cost of building the
Nicaraguan canal is about $58,000,000 more
than that of completing the Panama
canal, leaving out tne cost of acquiring
the latter property. This measures the
difference-in the magnitude of the ob
stacles to be overcome in the actual con
struction of the two canals, and covers
all-physical considerations, such as the
greater or lesser height of dams, or the
greater Off less depth of cuts, or the pres
ence or absence of natural harbors, the
presence or absence of a railroad, the
exemption from ot liability to. disease
and the amount of work remaining to be
done.
"The new Panama Canal company has
shown no.disposition to sell its property
to the United States. Should that com
pany be able and willing to sell, there is
reason to believe that the price would
not be such as would make the total cost
to the United States less than that of the
Nicaragua canal.
"H. The Panama-canal, after comple
tion, will be shorter, have fewer locks
and less curvature than the Nicaraguan
canal.- The measure of these advanta
ges is the time required for a vessel to
pass through, which is estimated for an
average ship at twelve hours for Panama
and tnirty-three hours for Nicaragua.
"On the other hand, the distance from
San Francisco to New York 's 377 miles,
to New Orleans, 579 miles and to Liver
pool, 386 miles greater via Panama than
via Nicaragua. The time required to
pass over these distances being greater
than the difference in time of transit
through the canal, the Nicaragua line,
after completion, would be somewhat the
more advantageous of the two to the
United States, notwithstanding the great
er-cost of maintaining the longer canaL
"111. The' government of Colombia, in
which lies the Panama canal has granted
I an exclusive concession, which still has
many years to run. .It is not free to
grant the necessary rights to the United
States, except upon condition that an
agreement be reached with the new Pan
ama Canal company. The commission

believes that such agreement is imprac
ticable^ So far as can be ascertained,
the company is not willing to sell its
franchise, but it will allow the United
States to become owner of part of its
stock. The commission considers such an
agreement inadmissable .
"The governments of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, on theother hand, are un
trammeled by concessions and are free
to grant to the United States such priv
ileges as may be mutually agreed upon.
"In view of all the facts, and particular
ly in view of all the dif
ficulties of obtaining the nec
essary rights, privileges and fran
chises on the Panama route, and assur
ing that Nicaragua and Costa Rica rec
ognize the value of the canal to them
selves and are prepared to grant cone
sions on terms which are reasonable and
acceptable to the United States, the com
mission is of the opinion that the most
practicable and feasible route for an
Isthmian canal to be 'under the control,
