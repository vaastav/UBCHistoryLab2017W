Those who were fortunate enough to
be present at the Woman's Club Monday
afternoon, had a delightful hour of tra
vel with three of our tourists of the past
summer. The program had been ar-
rauged lor by the committee on history
and travel, of which Miss Martha J.
Hall is chairman. Miss Hall first pre
sented Mrs. Rebecca P. Fairbanks who
almost literally took her audience on
her ' Carriage drive through the Tyrol
ese Alps." Mrs. Fairbanks supplement
ed her vivid descriptions with fine views
of the magnificent scemry of that famous
region, and which she kindly explained
to those who wailed to see them.

earlier party were as well pleased with
their conductor as were those of last
Monday afternoon, we bespeak for him
a successful future in all his "personally
conducted trips."
News from the Buttonhole Companies.
A number of the stockholders of the
Reece and International Buttonhole
Machine Companies have visited the fac
tory recently and bring back good re
ports regarding the business. The fac
tory is running with a full force and is
receiving good orders for buttonhole
machines. Their business in new lines is
ncreasing, namely in clothing,, under
wear and collars, the collar eyelet but
tonhole being a vast improvement over
he old style straight hole which breaks
out after the collar has been laundered a
ew times while the eyelet hole wears
far better and is much easier to button.
The president stated that he thought
the styles on shoes were working around
a little more to button which would
mean largely increased earnings.
The International Company has been
making1 good shipmentsabnad, especial-
v to tjermanv. As the company now
places the latest machines on royalty,
whereas lormetlv the old ones were sold
outright, thev are assured of a more
i able income and an increased value for
the stock in the next few years.
The Gay Masqueraders.
This company is booked for the Howe
Opera House next Saturday evening and
Mr. Black has made a popular price for
he show and all may be assured of
ilenty of (un. Concerning the perform
ance the Biddeford (Me.) Journal says:
The entertainment given was a va-
ied one pure and simule and it made a
hit with lhe audience, judging from the
applause with which the different turns
were received. The features ol the show
was the act of Harry Brown, Maybelle
Harrison and Dan Brown, which wa
overflowing with fun from start to finish
and kept the audience in an uproar.
Harry Brown who, bv the wav, has been
seen here before as leading man in "The
Devil's Auction," is one of the lunniest
and most original comedians on thestaire
and he crcaied a laugh every time he said
or did anything. The per ormance both
afternoon and evening wound up with a
aughabe skit entitled "lhe Hotel de
Waldorf."
Miss Hartig's Illustrated Talk.
A good sized audit nee greeted Miss Ly-
dia Hartig at the South church Sunday
night in her illustrated talk on her
recent trip to the various fields of mis
sion work, which are aided by the Wom
an's Home Missionary Union ol Ver
mont. She spoke of the work among
the Bohemians in the western cities; in
prairie communities in South Dakota;
among the Indians of the Santee agency,
and with the mountaineers of Tennessee
and the colored people in the south.
These fields are in widely separated parts
of the country, ami lhe pictures and de
seriptions of the people and places wers
exceedingly phasing. From this lecture
it is evident that Miss Hartig has the
happy faculty of sieing what is most in
tercsting in places teeming with interest
ing things.
Christmas Openings.
The annual openinc at the Brook
Tyler store comes next Saturday and
our advertising columns tell of some of

There is always a great variety of suit
able gi ts at this store and Mr. Randall
baa prepared lor the biggest Christmas

THANKSGIVING FESTIVITIES.
The Guards' Ball.
Company D has a reputation of mak
ing a pronounced success of everything
they undertake in the social and enter
tainment line, and the military ball and
musical sketch which preceded it, at the
Armory Wednesday evening added to
their already enviable reputation as en
tertainers. A crowded gallery with the
available floor space also filled with spec
tators, greeted the presentation of the
original mnsical sketch entitled "Reilly's
Reception." The piece represented the
Guards as entertaining Hon. M.J. Reilly
(Frank 0. French) and Aguinaldo, min
ister to the Philippines, (01m D. Adams)
The sketch consisted of songs and spec
ialities by these popular entertainers,
and a chorus consisting of members of
the company and others. A very pleas
ing feature of the evening entertainment
was the patriotic song, "It's the Man
behind the Gun that Does the Work," by
Master Joe Cheney. Master Cheney's
fine soprano voice and pleasing manner
have made btm very populur with M.
Johnsbury audiences and the hearty ap
plause which greeted him Wednesday
evening showed that his efforts were
thoroughly appreciated. Following the
musical sketch came a short drill by Co.
D in command ot Capt. Hetirv W. Ellis.
About 70 couples indulged in dancing.
1 he grand march was led by Lieut-Lol.
and Mrs. C. M. Bonett. The floor was
in charge of Col. Bonett assisted bv
Sergt. H. A. Wilcox and Private H. W
Bntton. I he committee of introduction
consistJd of Lieut. Celley. Sergt. 'Cook,
Corp. Horton, Corp. Spencer, Musician
Cheney and Privates Beck, Babcock and
Wright Refreshments were served under
the direction of Caterer Atwood. Young's
orchestra of ten pieces furnished music,
opming the entertainment with an over
ture, "Jollv Robbers." This programme
of dance music was a particularly choice
one, nearly every selection being entirely
new to a local ball room and many
favorable comments were heard concern-
ng the excellence of the music. The
selections were given in a finished man
ner which showed that the orchestra
must have spent much time and hard
work in practice since its organization
The orchestra is purely a local one and
of it musical St. Johnsbury has a right
to be proud. The Guards realized a good
amount from the affair.
The Poverty Parly.
The Poverty Ball has come to be a
fixed feature of the Thanksgiving season
aud apparently it is growing more popu-
ar each year. The third annual was
held at the Armory Thursday evening,
and, if such a thing were possible, it was
even a greater success than those which
have preceded it. From the costumes
worn it was evident that the rummage
ale had absorbed everything that might
be termed respectable in the way of
wearing apparel, and left for this occa
sion, noihing but rags. There wire
nearly 100 dancers present and almost
very one of them was attired in a cos
ume which betokened thedirest poverty.
As usual, among the gentleman, tramps
were in lhe majority, and some of the
best make-ups of the assembly repre-
ented this Iraternitv. Amongtne ladies
the costumes were many and varied, and
on no previous occasion oithe sort, have
he outfits been original and effective.
The gallery was occupied by invited
tnit sts. During the evming refreshments
were served by Caterer Atwood. Excel
lent music was furnished by the St.
ohnsbury orchestra. S veral were pres
ent from out ol town, among them being
Robert H. Smith, Guy H. Abbott, Robert
E Lewers, W-ilter Blair Hugh Blair,
Elliott Bishop ot Dartmouth ; Guy Park
hurst, Rutland; Mr. and Mrs. P. F.
Blodgett, Montpelier; Frank B. Pot'le,
MissOlie F. Parks, Lai caster, and Miss
Charlotte Kinney ol Lynuonville,
"The Brownies in Fairyland."
The first rehearsal for Palmer Cox's
"Brownies in Fairyland" was on Mon
day afternoon. Over 100 children are in
the cast. The next rehearsal will be this
alternoon in the chapel of the North
church when the "Tinkers" and "Tots"
rehearse.
This entertainment was recentlv given
in the Canadian capital and the Toronto
Mail says:
The great sign, "Standing room only,"
was brought into use at the maiinee of
"The Biowniis in Fairyland" at Massey
Music Hall this aftrnoon. Only twice
before in t he five years' history of Massey
Hall, with its immense seating capacity
of over 4.000 has this occurred. "The
Brownies in Fairyland," with its 150
Toronto children in the cast, has caught
the fancy ot the whole city. Tonight's
performance will be the last, and the
house will again be crowded.
"Kalendar Kermesse."
Don't fail to attend the "Kalendar
Ketmesse" at the North church which is
held on Thursday alternoon and Friday
oftern ion and evening. It is the annual
Christmas sale and will interest every
body. It is worth seeing and everyone
is welcome whether they buy anything
or not. Word has been received from
"Father Time" that he will certainly
arrive Thursday evening and have his
"Autograph Book" with him. This book
will be sold at auction on Friday evening
and will prove a very interesting pur
chase. A Swedish Reunion.
There was a small but exceedingly en
joyable gathering at the residence of
Edward J. Peterson on Thanksgiving
day. It was a reunion of some of the
Swedish families who were among the
first to come to St. Johnsbury. There
were present, John Swanson and family,
John Anderson and fimily, Rev. Carl J.
Peterson, brother of the host, and wife
of East Berkshire. The occasion was
enlivened by recitations and music
Rev. Mr. Peterson addressed the com
pany and John Anderson gave an inter
esting talk on a recint trip to Sweden.
It is calculated that the men and wom
en of today are nearly two inches taller
than their ancestors.
Epworth League Entertainment
The annual Christmas sale and enter
tainment of the Epworth League of
Grace Methodist church has in years
past been conspicuously successful, not
only because the sales of Christmas
goods have been large but also because
ot the splended entertainments furnished

At the Y. M. C. A.
Active work is in order at the Y. M. C.
A. buliding now, and in the week that
Mr. McGown has been here, everything
has progressed finely. The regular sched
ule of the gymnasium classes has been
established and is as follows; Business
men's clas, Wednesday and Friday even-
ngs; young men's class. Tuesday and
Thursday evenings; Academy class, Mon
day and' Wednesday afternoons at 4 30;
unior class, Tuesday and Friday after
noons at 4. The board of directors met
Monday night; and voted to hold regular
meetings on the first Tuesday of eaeh
month, except the next meeting, which is
to -be held Dec. 28. Sixteen names were
voted on for membership, which makes a
total of 25 new members for the week.
The following comniii tees were chosen:
Executive committee, C. C. Bingham,
George Ranney, E L.Hunt; Financecom-
mittee, L. N. Smthe, D. Y Lomstock, J.
M. ferham, Kobert Mackinnon; social
committee, R. C. Baker, E L. Hunt, Per-
ley Pope; Membership committee from
the board, M. E Clifford, J. 0 Hale.
The board made appropriations for
the gymnasium and social committees
and lor printing. A hand ball court is to
be established, and a spring board built
in the gymnasium. A basket ball league
will be formed among the members ot
the association.
Secretary McGown has already had
several applications lor members wish
ing to form a male chorus, orchestra,
and a class in mechanical drawing. It is
indeed a pleasure to witness such old
time activity at the building.
County Court.
The December term of county court
commenced yesterday alternoon at two
o'clock, Chief Justice Russell S. Taft pre
siding, with Hon. Stephen D. Morse of
Danville and Hon. William H. Gilchrist
of Melndoes, assistant judges, and Mrs.
E. A. Nutt of Montpelier, stenographer.
Owing to the absence of Sheriff Sulloway
who is confined to the house by illness,
court was opened by Deputy Sheriff
William Lindsay of Barnet. Prayer
was offered by Rev. A. C. Hussey. The
docket was called and about the usual
number of cases reported settled or con
tinued. There were no cases which could
not be tried yesterday so the jury will
not be sworn until this morning at nine
o'clock.
The case on the calendar, set for trial
yesterday was one of considerable local
interest. It was the forgery case of
State vs. Laura Duval. This case was
continued because of the severe illness of
the principal witness for the state. In
all probability this case will never come
to trial. Some of the cases which prom
ise to be of especial interest are: 0. E.
Bundy v. F. E. Chapman and H. D
Chapman, trespass, and two railroad
cases, Frank P. Smith v. Boston &
Maine railroad, and William Buckley v.
the St. J. and L. C. railroad. It is
thought that the term will be acompaia
tively long one. Among the attorneys
irom out of town were Hon. Frank Plum
hyotNorthfield, Judge F E Alfred, John
Young and E. A. Cook of Newport, J P.
Larnson of Cabot, W.H.Taylor, W. A.
Dutton and B E. Bullard ot Hardwick,
F. W. Baldwin of Barton, I T. Gleason
and N. A. Norton of Lyndonville, and
C. II Hos'ord ot Melndoes. J. P. Lam
son ot Cabot has a noteworthy record
of practice before the Caledonia County
Court. He attended this court tor the
first time just 40 years ago this term,
and since that time has never missed
being present, and having business at
every term.
The Catholic Bazaar.
The bazaar for the benefit of St. Aloy
sius church, which was held Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday evenings of
last week, was well attended. The "Pas
sion Play" presented by J. M. Foss and
son gave general satisfaction and the
Thanksgiving dinner was enjoyed by
about 300 people. The bazaar will be
continued this week Thursday, Friday
and Saturday evenings at Armory hall,
with many interesting features and en
tertainments that should not be missed.
Admission only ten cents. For details
and full inlormation see "Vox Cla-mantis."
Co. D Dartmouth.
The basket ball team from Company D
played with the Dartmouths at Hanover
Saturday night, and were de'eated by a
score of 20 to 9. As the Dartmouths are
the recognized champions of New Eng
land it is something of an honor for the
boys to have held them down to so small
a score. It was the first game of the
season for the Co. D boys and the result
showed that the team will without doubt
make this interesting game one of the
features of the winter in athletics in St.
Johnsbury.
Cost of the South African War.
The cost of the South African war has
now so greatly exceeded the original esti
mates that practically no one in authori
ty in England seems able to make a defi
nite calculation of what it may ulti
mately amount to. The borrowing pow
ers granted to the British Government
by the late Parliament are nearly ex
hausted, and heavv arrears, amounting
to between $200.000.000 and $250,000,
000 are pressing for payment. Against
these liabilities the government has
about $75,000,000 immediately availa
ble, the unexhausted borrowing power
amounting to $30,000,000, and the bal
ance of loans issued yet to be paid up,
$45,000,000. Of the payments in ar
rears much consists of the pay due the
army and debts to contractors.
The indirect cost has been estimated,
and the result is highly interesting. In
September last the shrinkage in value of
the full list of securities quoted on the
London Stock Exchange had, as a direct
consequence of the war, reached the enor
mous figure of nearly $2,500.000 000.
The decline in the market value ot con
sols alone has been serious, and the tall
has been equally marked in municipal
stocks and railway and other obliga
tions. The increase to the national debt
with the additional taxation to meet the
interest payments has also to be taken
into account. Then there is the expense
of the permanent garrison, estimated at
50 000 men, which will have to be kept
up for an undetermined period out of the
pocket of the British taxpayer, for there
is no present visible source of revenue in
South Africa from which the cost can be
paid.
But the matter does not end here. The
increase and the reorganization of the
army have to be provided for. and mil
lions will have to be spent in bringing
the stores of ammunition and other war
material up to the requirements of the
new policy. Already orders for $30,000,
000 worth of new guns have been placed.
tw be followed by others, the amount of
which has not yet been decided on.
It is not, however, In England only
that the direct cost of the war is making
itself felt by the taxpayers. The short
age ol revenue in Cape Colony this year
is estimated by the Minster of Finance
at not less than $12,915 000, which he
proposes to borrow, though the recep
tion which a proposal to raise a small
loan in the London market a few months
ago met with does not seem to encour
age fresh applications in the same quar
ter. In the nature of thinus it will be
some years before the waste and destruc
tion worked bv the war have been made
good, and meantime the course of trade
which in the past was favorable to Cape
Colony wilt take other channels. Dur
ban, in Natal, and Lorenzo Marques are
so much nearer to Bloemlontein and Pre
toria than Cape Town that supplies and
traffic may be expected to take the short
er routes. This will affect the revenues
of Cape Colony derivable from the rail
ways.
No boom is to be looked for after the
war is over, the sacrifices made by the
Cape farmers or imposed on them hav
ing been toogreat to permit their launch
ing out into extravagances of any kind
for a long time to come, The reduction
of the Imperial expenditure consequent
on the withdrawal from the country of
the great portion of the British army
will cause a sudden reduction in the
trade depending on it aud bring about a
great curtailment ol the profits of those
engaged in it and on which they depend
lor their living. The latest accounts
from the late Orange Free State describe
it as reduced almost to the condition of
a desert, the Boer homesteads in ruins
and the flocks andherds either earned
off to supply the wants of the army ol
occupation or scattered over the veldt,
where they are a prey to the wild beasts
that are making their appearance in con
siderable numbers as a result of the dis
appearance ot the population. The ces
sation of the production ot gold during
the period of the war is also among the
indirect losses caused by it. New York

Falling off in Our Indians.
Prof. Dorsey of the Field Columbian
Museum does not agree with William A.
Jones, Commissioner ot Indian Affairs,
who reported that he believed that there
are as many Indians in the Uni ed Siates
now as there were in the days of Colum
bus. Prof. Dorsey does not see where
proof can be f und for the statement
"I do not think Mr. Jones will deny,"
said the protssor, "that there are not as
many Indians to-day in Arizona, New
Mexico, Montana and North Dakota, as
the e were in 1492 If there are not
more there how is he to make a balance
lor the thousands of Indians who lived
east of the Mississippi ? The decrease in
the Indian populaiion was enormous
until thirty years ago, though since then
the Indians have managed to hold their
own. At present the Indians are slowly
increasing in numbers, but, ol course,
they will never regain their former
st ength. The Indim Department is
handling the Indian question well and is
gradua ly making the Indian more im-portant."-New

The President's Hessage.
Congress assembled at noon Monday
and alter the usual formalities at open
ing listened to President McKinley'smes
sage. The message is very long, three
newspaper pages, much ot it is devoted
to a recital of what is today history.
The striking points of his suggestions
may be told brief! v :
Make peace in China, and in ding so
secure guarantee ol libertv of laith, and
accept ' open door" as partial compen
sation. In case of inability to agree on indem
nity refer all to Hague court of arbitra
tion. Provide what further legislation is
necessary to insure parity between our
two forms of metallic money, silver and

Kitchener' Firm Bulletin,
General Kitchener's first bulktin was
received in London Sunday, it is business
like and terse. It is dated from Bloem
fontein, and opens with a summary of
Knox's rear guard action and pursuit of
De Wet, and Settle's attack upon Hert
z"g. It leaves Knox in touch with De
Wet twelve miles north of Bethulie, and
confirms the impression that Kitchener
will hunt down the most dangerous Boer
leadirby relays ol mounted men, con
tinually reinforced and relieved. The
capture of De Wet and Steyn is clearlv
the first great stroke which he has in
mind, and the same tactics of sending
out mobile columns of a thousand men
and keeping them in motion on the trail
of the commandoes will be adopted else
where. Holiday Sale.
