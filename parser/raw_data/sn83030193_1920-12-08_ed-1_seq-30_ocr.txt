not be permitted to hold up least of all in the
aim immediately following a Presidential election.
If the present session, with no election on its
mind, in a period when Hie country is in dire need
of extra legislative aid, can find no time to make
even a start toward meeting these two great national
needs, what in the name of representative govern
mentis the use of Congress!
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
THE first thing that will be noted about the.
President's message to Congress is its insist
ence upon two pressing national needs in-urging
:which Republican leaders have committed them
selves as completely as has Mr. Wilson himself.
J The President says not one word about the League
of Nations.
' But he has much to say concerning the imperative
need of tax revision and of a programme of econ
omy in national expenditure that shall include the
establishment of a national budget system.
In his message a year ago this montli the Presi
dent urged upon the present Congress these same
two reconstructive requirements.
There was no reason whatever why this Sixty
sixth Congress should not have come to the aid of
the country twelve months ago by undertaking the
revision of the income and excess profits taxes and
by working out a national budget plan.
Instead of that Uic leaders of the Republican ma
jority let the country wart for tax revision in order
tint they might put into the Republican platform a
plank ailing for tax revision as a relief whicli only
a Republican Administration could assure.
With similar design, this same Republican major
ity put through a budget measure containing a pro
vision alculated to make certain the-President's veto.
In his present message the President points out
that the House of Representatives subsequently
modified the Budget Bill, and declares that in its
. revised form, "coupled with action already taken by
the Congress to revise its rules and procedure," the
bill "furnishes the foundations for an effective na
tional budget system."
i With the Presidential election out of the way, the
great Republican victory won and Republian super
strategy no longer needed, an the Sixty-sixth Con
gress find the shadow of an excuse for not making
a new start on the national budget plan in its present
final session?
Reviewing the Nation's current finances, the Pres
ident says:
"The fundamental fact which' at present
dominates tho Government's financial situa
tion la that seven and a half billions ot Its
war Indebtedness mattrro within tho next
twoXnnd a half years. Of this amount, two
and halt billions aro floating debt and five
billions Victory notes and War Savings Cer
tificates. Tho fiscal programme of tho Gov
ernment must be determined with refcrenco
to these securities'.
"Sound policy demands that tho Govern
ment expenditures bo reduced to tho lowest
amount which will permit the various sor
vlcoj to operate efficiently"
A close parallel to this may be found in the Na
tional Economy plank of the Republian Platform.
Do Republian leaders dare to tell the country
that it need expect no start on a national budget
measure until President Harding calls the Sixty
seventh Congress next spring? v
Likewise when President Wilson again urges sim
plification and revision of tax laws which were de
vised for war and which no'w burden individuals
and discourage business enterprise, he is uttering
nothing that is not on record as avowed Republian
doctrine.
Will the present session of the Sixty-sixili .Con
gress refuse the country even the beginnings of leg
islation for tax relief ?
Proper treatment and training tor disabled figiit
ers, economic improvements in agricultural industry
and marketing, encouragement for new chemical
and dye-stuff manufactures stimulated in the United
States during the war, stricter regulations for cold
storage goods, complete independence for the Philip
pines and a loan to the struggling Government of
Armenia are other specific recommendations in the
President's message.
But its chief stress is on those two urgent and
shamefully neglected national reconstructive needs-
tax reviston and a budget.
Dwelling upon the present mission of democ
racy, the President points out that one of the duties
of the United States "is to prove that a great democ
racy an keep bouse as successfully and in as busi
ness-like a fashion as any other Government."
Tax revision and budget-making seem to a vast
. majority of the people of the United States a part

By John Cassel
The District Court ot Appeals has set aside
William Kntiilolph, lltii rst'H injunction against
tho Shipping Hoard forbidding salo of tho
German ships it hold.
The result of thu court action merely made
tho load ot every taxpayer n llttlo heavier be
causo tho shipping market was dropping
every day and every delay meant a lower
price.
MUNICIPAL FINANCE GONE MAD.
MUNICIPAL budget-making has ended for the
year. It has proved a sorry farce.
Budgets arc never popular. They always man
taxation usually higher taxation.
The present budget is no exception. The rate,
based on increased valuations, is about 2.83.
'I his, however, is not the worst. This budget is
a thoroughly dishonest budget. When the budget
is presented to taxpayers it alts for j5345,000,ooo.
This is bad enough. It is an increase of $71,000,000
over the previous budget.
But it does not include all the'items. An addi
tional 27,000,000 for schools remains to be pro
vided outside the regular fiscal channels. This the
budget-makers. have omitted from the bill they now
present, it will not, however, be omitted from the
bill the taxpayers will be required to pay.
Mayor Hylan fatuously reports that this deficiency
will be met by voluntary savings made by the vari
ous departments and turned over to the Board of
Education.
If Mayor Hylan honestly believes this he is gulli
ble in the extreme. This is not the way in which
department heads do things.
If lie does not believe it, he merely adds a su
perlative degree to the dishonesty of the budget.
Savings could be made in departments., Useless
clerks could be discharged. Economial and efficient
management would save all of 10 per cent, in most
departments. But the aving will not be made.
Neither Mayor Hylan nor any other agency has the
power to enforce such a reform.
What will and must happen is that the Legis
lature will take cognizance of the plight of the pub
lic schools., Further expenditures will be author
ized. Appropriations will be mandatory. These
expenses will be met by taxes if not this year,
then next.

MRS. MARY O'BRIEN.
Now is trie season tor compilers of necrologies.
Business men, lawyers, poets and writers,
statesmen and politicians, publicists, humanitarians,
philosophers, professors will be listed all those of
the great and the near great.
Missing from most if not all these lists will be the
name of Mrs. Mary O'Brien of No. 966 St. Nicholas
Avenue. But how many among all the list of the
note.d dead have better claim to real fame than Mrs.
O'Brien?
Never heard of her ? Perhaps not. Mrs.'O'Brien
didn't advertise herself as successfully as some of
the others. She didn't pile up a million dollars nor
nm for otfice.
All Mrs. O'Brien did was to rear a family ot two
ot her own children and twenty-six orphan chil
dren of other people. Outside of that she was a
good business woman ariH managed two boarding
houses and a hotel.
After the funeral a daughter said, "None of us
knjw she was so ill as she was, for she never
stopped working until she found it impossible to go
on"
Probably Mrs. O'Brien would have been the last
to say that hers was a remarkable life. She did
what came to hand in the way she believed she
ought- to. As a result, twenty-six homeless children
had homes Instead of institutional are.
Of course it meant work for Mrs. O'Brien, lots
of it. No wonder she lived only forty-eight years
instead of threescore and ten.
How many how few of the names that will go
into the lists of the famous dead for the year liave
an actual claim to fame as valid as that of Mrs. Mary
O'Brien? '

UNCOMMON SENSE
By John Blake.
(CoottIcM. :cr. br John UUke.)
EVERY MAN NEEDS AT LEAST ONE SCAItE.
There arc in tlic world to-tiny thousands of hale old
gentlemen still doing important work who would be in their
graves if they had never been frightened.
There arc thousnnds of men of nil ages who arc enrn
ing big salaries and contributing to progress who would
be barely making n living if it hud not been for n scare.
Fear is 1 harmful, nnd . ought to be abolished. But
fright, which is merely a temporary dose of fear, is as help
ful as a tonic.
l,f to-day you happen to be doing very ordinary work
in a very ordinary way at very ordinary wages, you need n
senre. And don't worry. You will probably get it.
Sonic time you will observe thut nil the men who are
taking their jobs for grnntcd are listed for dismissal. You
will go home that evening thoroughly frightened. And, if
you nre worth anything nt nil, out of that fright will grow
n resolution to do things differently in the future.
Dozens of men have never amounted to anything till
they were discharged or threatened with the loss of their
jobs. Then they suddenly uwnkeiied to the fact that just
getting along isn't getting along at all, nnd bent nil their
energies townrd innking real progress.
If you look over the golf courses in the neighborhood
of great cities you will discover other gentlemen who arc
alive because the fright that .they needed was administered
by their physicians.
Finding that Ihcy did not feel quite as much like work
as they ought to they went to their doctors for advice, and
discovered that lack of exercise, over-drinkbig and over
smoking had put their physicnl machinery out of order, and
made dropping out altogether a possibility at nny time.
The scare drove them to exercise and diet, and exercise
and diet prolonged their lives.
, Keep fear out of your system, but don't be troubled at
a little fright. Anything in 'the, nature of u shock or a jolt
is helpful if it doesn't come too late. It-is the only way that
three-quarters of the inhabitants of this earth can ever be
made to realize the necessity of doing what is in them to do.
