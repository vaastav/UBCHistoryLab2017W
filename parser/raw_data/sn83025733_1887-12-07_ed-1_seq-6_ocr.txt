Tut! President's message, or partic
ularly that poitiou referring to the
excossivo tarifl tax and the useless
millions accumulating in the treasury,
published In last evening's JIkkald,
was lnely commented on among tho
scuators and congressmen yesterday.
The expression from Domocrats was
ono of gonorol hearty approval, ex
cept Mr. Itandnll aud au occasional
co-sympathizer with tho poor manu
facturing companies and iron produc
ers. One or two representatives of
Ohio wool districts (whoro tne Ko
publican vote is really to bo inoro fear
ed than Democratic wool-growers) are
disgruntled, and Mr. (Jay of tho sugar
district in Louisiana thinks that a
platform conforming to the president's
message would cause Louisiana to go
Republican. Tho Herald Is free to
sny it thinks Mr. Gay is mistaken.
Tho 'people who carry Louisiana for
tho Democratic tickets are not so
interested in sugar as the few influen
tial planters of his district. Tho
worst that could happen would
bo tho defeat of tho Democratic
nominee in that ono district,
and that would inako no real differ
ence iu tho House of Representatives
for the Democrat from that district
aud the ltopublican would voto
alike ou the only issue before the
country revision of the tariff. Hut
there is no cause for lear even that the
sugar planters ot Louisiana will givo
their influouco to the defeat of any
Democratic Stato or national nominee ;
for, whilo they may bo loth to soe a
Dart of the unreasonable large profit
ou their sugar product remain with
the masses of tho pooplo who have it
to pay, they nevertheless would be far
from voting a step toward the return
of Republican negro rule which de
vasttaed their plantations, ruiued their
industry, caused dissatisfaction be
tween employer and employed oft to
the extent of riot and arson. No, the
Louisiana sugar planters would no
doubt prefor to give up tho ill-gotlon
half of the unjust profit on sugar pro
duction, rather than return to Repub
lican rule. Louisiana Is a Democratic
Stale, and may tafoly be couuted so
