President Hooeb
velt ha his an
nual message com
pined, a finely en
grossed copy ready
for filing away and
can-fully typewrit
j i . vy ' I
ten copies, tie!
with ribbon, to be
presented to the
house and senate
and read before
tho.se bodies and
aiiout lft.OoO copies printed anil ready
tor distribution as soou as the Impor
tant document has been read In con
gress. This Is probably the mojt Im
portant message the president has ever
tent to congress and is the longest. It
lontalus from 20,000 to 25,0ut) words,
which is an unusually lengthy o:u
inundation for au executive to send to
congress.
As the country knows pretty gener
tlly, Mr. Roosevelt makes railway leg
islation the chief feature of his mes
ea;e. When congress adjourned last
winter without doing anything on this
subject the president announced that
he would taku every opportunity to
keep it alive and he has done so. In
his own speeches he has told very
dearly what he will ask congress to
do and Secretary of War Taft and Sen
ator Knox, of Pennsylvania, former at
torney general, have aided In promul
gating the administration policy. The
president proposes that congress au
thorize the interstate commerce com
mission or some other governmental
body to declare when a railroad rate
Is unreasonable and then to fix a rate
which 1b reasonable. The railroads are
to be given recourse to the federal
courts if they are not satisfied.
The president will treat of a great
number of subjects In his message In
addition to railroad matters, prominent
among them being federal control of
Insurance companies, the Santo Domin
ium treaty, the Panama canal, preserv
ing the Niagara falls, our relations
with foreign governments, but it Is
said he will not have any observations
to tnal.e on the tariff.
Retirement of Senator Blackburn.
NE of the results of
the recent elec-
Cry t I s iions, it is saia,
I 1 II will be the retire
ment of Senator
Jo Blackburn, of
K e n t u c ky. His
term expires In
1!H7, but the con
test this fall has
shown that the
control of the leg
islature U in dan
ger of passing
away from his friends. Senator Black
burn is one of the old-time southern
orators aud a man of unique character
and manners. He will be greatly
missed if the wheel of politic should
throw him out of public life.
Blackburn served for ten years in
the house aud most of his reputation
lie made for oratory was achieved in
that body, lie was then in the prime
of life and vigor and his fine reso
nant voice was frequently heard in de
late. He was never known for the
profundity of his arguments, but he
had a way of speaking that was im
pressive. He is one of those orators
who can take a self-evident proposition
and restate it in complex sentences so
as to make it appear as an entirely
new discovery and something of won
ilerful meaning and depth. Ho could
argue on the floor of the senate for
five minutes that two and two make
lour and to the ordinary listener it
would sound as though ho were dem
onstrating a most abtruse problem.
The Kentucky senator is one of the
diminishing number of ex-confederates
now In congress. He served all through
the war in the confederate army and
haa an excellent record for bravery.
He served two terms In the senate, be
ginning In '85 and then was retired for
four years when fhe republicans con
trolled the legislature, but In 1900 suc
ceeded former Senator William Lind
say, who had turned gold democrat in
SU aud refused to Bupport Bryan in
1900, New leaders have sprung up in
Kentucky, however, and Mr. Black
Lurn is said to be Blated for retire
ment. He will have reached within
one year of the scriptural limit of life
of three score and ten when his term
expires.
The Old Southerners.
JLW JW HE retirement
of
f I ! Senator Rlaxlkum
reduces still fur
ther the group of
senators from the
south v,ho hare in
these modern days
retained many of
the characteristics
and mannerisms
ante-bellum days.
The death of Sena
tor, Bate, of Ten
nessee, last snrlne
removed an old-time and old-style
southerner from fublio life. There are
ol treat many of this type left
Money, of Mississippi; Morgan and
Pettus, of Alabama; Berry, of Arkan
sas; McCreary. of Kentucky; and Mo
knery, cf Louisiana, are about all who
m
o
11
could now be classed as typical south
erners in dre3 and manners, with the
exception of Bailey, of Texas, a com
paratively young man, who affects
even more than bis seniors the old-
style southern dress. This uniform is
the long-skirted black coat, low-cut
vest and black slouch hat.
The other senators from the south
cannot be distinguished from tbelr
northern colleagues and look, for
the most part, like prosperous busi.
cess men and usually attend the ses
sions of the senate dressed in business
clothes. On state occasions the whole
senate dresses In the black Prince Al
bcrt coat, although the cut of the gar
ments worn by the old southerners Is
not so stylish as that of the other
members. This uniformity of black,
closcly-Lut toned frock coat adds very
much to the appearance c,f the senate
and tho body seems to lose some of Its
dignity when in every day routine of
work senators appear in sack coa'ts,
cutaways and other styles of garments
of varlo.is colors.
Another decade will probably see the
last of the ante-bellum type of south
erner In Washington. The numerous
railroads that bind the south to the
north and the Interchange of commerce
lias done wonders in amalgamating the
sections and destroying tho distinctly
i j pes of citizens. This Is nowhere so
apparent as in the congress of the
United States, where men from the
most remote sections of the south and
west meet.
Our "Home" Country.
HE great Mississip
pi valley and thi
middle west Is be
coming the section
of American
homes," said Mr,
Babcock, 'of Wis
consin, the other
day in comment
ing on the changes
that are being
worked by the in
creasing popula
tion of the coun
Mm
i
try. It had been suggested that the
American people were not a home peo
ple, fhe ancestral homes of England,
about which poets have sung, do not
abound in this country, and even in
the old settlements of the east com
paratively few homesteads are found
where more than one generation has
lived. On this point Mr. Babcock de
clared that the middle west, the great
states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa nnd
others, were now the great home coun
try of America.
"Out in this delightful section," said
Mr. Babcock, "you find the home spirit
more deeply established than in the
rich and prosperous east. In many of
these states you find a strong German
clement, and wherever that is you find
tho love of home aud the ambition to
found a home that will remain in the
same family for generations. Ol
course the country Is too new to show
any very long established homesteads,
but I can point to you in my own
state and In adjoining states scores and
hundreds of places where the head of
the household established himself 30,
40 and 60 years ago and where the
original estate has been preserved, a
substantial house built and occupied
first by the original owner and then by
his oldest son, while surrounding the
homestead are the homeB of other
children of the family. There are
many of these patriarchial establish
ments and In them I think you will
find the hope for tho stability and con
servatism necessary to a safe govern
ment." It Is not known whether Mr. Bab
cock has followed the example of the
good people whom he describes, but he
has purchased enough homes in Wash
ington to Insure places for all his heirs
it they w ish to locate hero.

He has made a life study of various
religions, with a view of reaching a
harmony of the eastern and western

the next campaign
for governor,
but even upon the
presidency, I
make no apology
for the following
recital of what

busy with hysterical shriek
Ing.'the others because it is not their

is apt to think election fraud an old
tory. So It is. Still
For once Tammany was deceived by
Its preliminary secret canvass, usual
ly a marvel of accuracy. The lead
ers thought McClelland was safe by a
fair plurality. So they made little
more than the usual preparation for
the voting. Of course, they did not
neglect the ordinary precaution of
"planting" about a hundred of their
men among the Hearst watchers.
The real uncertainty, Tammany
thought, was Jerome. The leader?
knew that the people wanted to vote
for him; they thought that the diffi
culties of a "split ticket" would pre
vent most of them, but this was not cer
tain. That was why such a deter
mined effort was made In the daytime
to "beat up' 'the Jerome watcher j
These were a magnificent body of !
men, gray-haired business men and !
lawyers with more than a sprinkling
of college athletes who went to the
fighting districts. It was a bloody day i
for many of them. During the day the j
Hearst men were not much molested i
because they were not believed to be i
dangerous and because so many were
larumany men In disguise.
The Amazing Night.

Half an hour later
It was apparent
that Hearst was
elected, in spite of
the way in which
his extemporized
machine went to
nieces In tniito nf
the seducing away of his watchers, in
spue or everything. Tnen even in
Tammany Hall there was a moment of
panic. The reading of returns was
stopped. Outsiders were hustled out
of sight and hearing, and a few lender
went to work grimly, dogeedlv. to
count out Hearst, as Henrv r.wnr
wai counted out 19 years ago.

"Let Jerome go through!" ran one In
sistent cry. "You fools, do
him down on us, too? Haven't we had
enough of Jerome in tho campaign?
Let him go through!" This counsel
prevailed. The early evening crowds
at the bulletins saw the amazing spec
tacle of Hearst's nluralltlea dwindling
as Jerome's mounted though of course
they went together naturally.
l nou began, too. that nnertado at
Hearst's headquarters which turned
the rather gay and careless man into a
white-faced, passionate figure of re
venge. Men "battered and bruised,
one man with a broken arm dangling
in nis sleeve, another whoxn hiH hH
been cut open, with the blood trickling
through the bandages," began to stag

What Was the Vote
HAT really would

cast? For Jer
ome not less than
25,000 to spare In
a vote of 400,000.

Hearst, perhaps
10,000 nothing
like the figures be

..P

M
. f
In district after district when th
voting was over there were more bal
lots In the box than the registered
names. The Inspectors threw out
enough to ma!te the total right; in
theory they do this by turning the
head inspector's back to the pile and
letting him pick out the needed num
ber; but where the Inspectors are al'
of one mind and the Hearst boy hat
gone off with his broken arm and the
Jerome man's teeth have been kicked
out and bis ribs broken, there Is a bare
suspicion that the man may have
peeped.
And getting the ballots Into the
box! There Is comparatively little
buying of votes In the city In propor
tion to its size. What there Is la
strung along the Bowery mainly. In
a very little and vory rotten region,
gang Infested, crime-cursed. The paid
voters, including several hundred re
peaters from other cities,' all .vote on
the "carbon paper plan," which Is
supposed to show how the voter has
cast his ballot. The trick Is easy to
"beat," but probably most of the men
vote as they are paid. Three times
during the day the election district
captain get.4 from his watcher the
names of all that have not yet voted.
Every name U voted on. If a gentle
man with a very Celtic face, who an
swers to the name of Qonfarone is not
certain whether his first name Is An
tonio or Giovanni, snd whether he
lives at No. 168 or 178, -he swears his
vote in just the same. Is arreBted, goes
to police court, is liberated and comes
back to grin through the window at
his challenger.
A mere recount of the votes as they
stand will not, if ordered, make a fair
contest. Perhaps Hearst doesn't really
want one, now that the flrBt flush of
anger dies away. In the opposition,
but with a moral victory, he will be In
a stronger position for a successful
Journalist than if he were in office and
disappointing people.

defective Hearst
Upon an honest vote he was beaten,
83 his own supporters will admit He
has really done his best with a diffi
cult problem and wMh the kind of men
he had to work with; he will probably
do better still In the future, but that
makes no difference.
McClellan is as able a map as
Jerome; a more tactful one, as clean,
as high-minded, as anxious to Co Ma
duty. He 13 richer, more" dignlflol,
possibly more ambitious, and was more
wldoly known. The two have traveled
different paths. Jerome honestly fight
ing bosjlsm, McClellan as honestly
thinking bossiam inevitable and that
he must make the be3t of it. Jerome
13 now the foremost democrat of his
state, and the "Little Mayor" is no
where. Are there any other democrats, for
future candidates for governor and
president? One of the highest rank,
Edward M. Shepard, the beaten can
didate for mayor in 1901. Mr. Shep
ard is a man of national size, a mag
nificent campaigner, a lifelong foe of
bosses. He was nominated by Croker
because Croker was desperate, but
Shepard made no promises. It was his
intention, If elected, to clean out Tam
many Hall from the Inside.
Art and Thirty Boxes.
HE new "National

Pi 3 seriously if you
A . f I like, but have a
" - - J. .1 sleeve bandy to
chuckle in.
The opera Is the
great show place
of wealth and
fashion. Boxes
are In demand by
the iewly rich,
hut there are not
4U
enough to go
round, and the directors, as much men
of fashion as of wealth, rule strictly
upon applicants. Money alone cannot
procure a place In the Golden Circle.
Very well. Money will buy boxes at
the horse show, where they are auc
tioned off, more than $400 being paid
for the best. The opera Is not the
only golden circle. Wasn't there
something cald about the need of a
National theater, an er palace of art,
where er good plays by native au
thors, and all that sort of thing, don'l
you know? Let's have one!
So it Is to be done. A beautiful
building Is to be erected, a company
hired and good plays given. They will
undoubtedly be good, for Herr Direk
tor Conreld will not etand for bad
work. And there will be seats at low
prices for the truly earnest all of
which is like tho royal theaters and
operas on the continent. The little
Joker Is in the Innocent statement that
there are to be 30 boxes. Practically
the 30 bos owners are to finance the
show, build the theater, guarantee th
expenses and sit In the boxes. Their
names will be printed In the program,
Just as the names of the opera bci
holders are printed In that program;
and I always think . that feature of
opera is funnier even than a fat tenor
But the names will not be the same
names.
Thus, art for art's sake is Justified

of elevating the singe as it Is do,"e is

would be particularly effective, espe
cially If two shades were employed.
Each of these strips, measuring about
nine inches wide, should be turned In

from right to left with one shade, and
then should be threaded in and out In
the opposite direction with the other

Five strips of each would be needed.
Purple and mauve, or two shades of

well; but if only one shade were pre

SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS.
What Constitutes the Ideal Hostess
and About the Proper Selection
of Dinner Guests.
The ideal hostess will possibly differ
rrom the points of view of different
minds, but she who comes nearest to
satisfying every taste will cause all
guests to feel at ease and perfectly at
home while in her house. She must
possess great tact and endeavor to
make each one feel individually the fa
vored guest She must ts quick to see
everything while seeming to see noth
ing, never looking bored and keeping
the conversational ball rolling without
any apparent effort or even seomlng to
do so. An ideal hostess must be en
tirely unselfish and lot no one be
slighted or overlooked.
Now that vacation days are over and
the world has returned from the mai
mer outing which has possibly been
spent In the woods or where much free
dom in behavior is allowed, be careful
to modulate the voice and tone down
actions to fit city life and customs.
Iio right-thinking mother wishes her
sou to choose a boisterous, flinnant
wile, so be careful that your love of
fun and the summer's freedom do not
lead you too far. As we have so often
repeated, be kind and thoughtful and
' do unto others as you would that tbey
should do to you."
A visiting card may be used for in
formal invitations. No call Is neces
sary after a tea or afternoon reception,
though very ofteii at home days are
given in the invitation to a large re
ception when a call is quite in order.
These at home days are often as elab
orately prepared for as the original
reception with a caterer, but it is per
fectly admissible to have the serving
done by the house servants. Many
times a caterer's service is employed
to relieve the regular help, who have
all they can do in the daily routine.
Without anything additional.
It is necessary to be most careful In
ihocslng your guests for a dinner party
that they should u congenial. Not
necessarily friends or even acquaint
ances, but wujue tastes are similar,
otherwise your dinner will not be a
success. To make it so the conversa
tion must be pleasant and sustained
and a good story-teller is a great as
sistance. Art of Tea Making'.
Practice the art of tea makfn when
you are all alone. Take a cup or tea
and pass It across the table. See If
you can do It without forgetting any
thing end without upsetting It Then
try to do it and to listen at the same
time. Pretend you are holding a con
versation, uon i look at the cup too
steadily. Practice tea making until
yOU Can dO It Without mora, fh.n

when you. have learned It be you rich
or poor, a great hostess or a small

WHEN CLIMBING STAIRS.
Remember the Exercise Is Most Bene
ftcial When the Right Methods
Are Observed.
Stalr-clhnblng can never be made so
easy that It will cease to be work, and
hence a certain amount of It dally Is sure
to be beneficial, says Mary Butler, in the
Philadelphia Press. .
First, stair-climbing Is fine exercise
for the muscles of the legs, both for
the high flexors and thigh and knee ex
tensors, and if iudiclousiv used as a
dally exercise It will tend to develop the
muscles of the leg and thigh, reducing
at the same time any superfluous flesh
that may have settled there . through
lack of proper use. Hence we use ladder-climbing
exercises in the gymna
sium for all such cases.
Second, stair-climbing when done
slowly, becomes excellent balance work
and Is good for the brain. To Increase
this mental effect in the gymnasium we
use ladder rounds Instesd of steps and
the slower a pupil can walk up the
finer the balance and the stronger the
desired effect.
Third, stalr-cllmblng.Is good work
for heart and lungs; weak hearts may
be strengthened by judicious lessons in
it, no other apparatus being necessary
than one's own footsteps.
In all stair or ladder work the weight
Is not only transferred from one foot to
the other in succession more or less rap
id, as in the walk, but the whole body
weight is lifted from one step to
another by the first leg and then the
other, and this means quite heavy work
at times.
For example, If you weigh 150 pounds
ana wun the right foot step up one step
(that step being exactly 12 Inches
high), you have lifted your body-weight
of 150 pounds exactly one foot higher;
or, as we say, you have done 150 "foot
pounds" of work. If the step chances"
to be 24 Inches high, then having lifted
yourself two feet you have done
twice as much work, or 300 foot
pounds. .
Thus, when you, weighing . Just 100
pounds, climb ten stairs, each step
only 12 inches high, you have done
Just 1,000 foot pounds of work, good
Biruug, muscuiar wont mat u done well
will surely do you good and If done bad
ly may Injure.
Do you stout ladles wonder any long
er at your breathless condition when
after eating a hearty dinner you climb
to the third-story front room to tako
your afternoon nap? Do you not Bee
that with every step you must do from
one-half as much again to twice as
much work as your wiry little neigh
bor? You have no right to run up Just be
cause you can trip up one flight and
not feel it. You perforce must take
it slowly and should rest after each
flight of steps, at least till the breath
ing becomes quiet and regular once
more.
Believe me. instead of being bad for
you, stair-climbing taken slowly and
properly will do you good, strength
ening the muscles of legs, abdomen and
spine, stimulating the heart and lungs,
clearing the brain, aiding the circula
tion and thus Improving the digestion;
but there Is a correct and an Incor
rect way of climbing stairs, a hard
and an easy one, a safe and a dangerous
one.
