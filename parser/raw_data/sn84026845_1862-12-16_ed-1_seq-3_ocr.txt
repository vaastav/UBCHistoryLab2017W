fyTin SorTaruM Illpstbitrd Niwa,
?One of the prisoners brought iu on Sun
day evening had in hU possession tt cop/ of
% Richmond publication called tlie "Itlui
tratrd Southern .Ve?r?." It is a had imita
tion of the New York Illustrated (Mpti'tV/?'
The number before -us i<onuiu an eques
trim pictuVe and a biographical sketch Of
the lste Gen. Turner Asbby, of whom, it
Upon tbe hearts and minds of every man,
woman and child, from tbe mouth of tbe
Sbeoaodoah to whero ill spring-bead
wells out from the mountains of Augosta,
ill along tbe beautiful Valley of Virginia,
tbe memory of this great partisan chief
tain is, and to life's close will ever be faith
fully pictured.
Ia tbe death of Turner Asbby tbe State
of Virginia and tbe Southern Confederacy
bate lost one of the bravest defenders of
liberty, and society one of its brightest or
nameots. It is only now that he baa gone
we know how to appreciate him folly,
"Blowing, do brlgbtaa aa thejr take their flight."
Turner Asbby waa never known to en
gage in any game of chance; to nse an oatb
or aoy expression which conld offend the
most polite ear?indeed, be was entirely
free from dissipation of all kiods.
In tbe cemetery at tbe University of Vir
ginia this favorite son of the confederacy
lies interred, quietly sleeping bia last sleep.
Hit body was quietly deposited in tbe oar
row grave by men of bis original command.
As tbe solemn cortege moved towards tbe
barial-gronnd, never did a'.rong?men in
arms keep step to the "foneral dirge" with
heavier hearts than did his fellow soldiers
follow his retaaina to their last resting
place. , ?'
The -Vmi also contains a picture of Miss
Belle Boyd, "the rebel spy." Tbe pictore
looks very much like thoae which are seen
weekly in tbe yottonaL J'olice Gazette. The
face is particularly bard and forbidding
If ever Uisa Belle succeeded "In coming it
over" our affieers to tbe extent that it il laid
she did, it.was not an-account of. her per
sonal beauty: The A'tue is full of the
praises ot Stonewall Jacluon and his "foot
cavalry." Tbe following verse is copied
trom a poem about Jackson's command:
No wonder that the Yankee* ran.
And will not stop to fight;
For we're no need of ? word or gun?
They cannot stand a light.
Onr long hair floating on tha wind,
Like witches in Macbeth?
They know they dare not lag behind?
We'll hare their?shoe*, or death ? .?i
Tbe two deserters, Fioley and Laurie,
who left this city with the Shrirer Graysf
and who are now confined in the Athene
um, having deserted from ibe rebel army,
belonged to JacksonV^^mn^apd. j {FiW
say there is more troth than poetry in. the
abore Terse. Jackson's ragtt tiffins were
as miserably attired as FaletafFs recruits,
and tbe sight of them was enough to
frighten an ordinary man out of bis senses.
Sk??~ Lsttib from tbi Mississippi Gum
boat FiiSiT.? We have received & letter <
from a gentleman of this city who Is now .
engaged npon the supply ship which ii fol- ]
lowing in the rear of the Mississippi Quo- j
boat fleet. The letter !? dated off Island ]
100, 30 miles from Vlcksburg, Dec. 3rd.?
The letter states that the gunboats will be
concentrated at the month of the Yazoo
river, twelve mites below "Island 100,"
while the army will mass at some point
above and' march across the country to
Yazoo Citj, which place is but a few miles
back of Viclcsburg, so as to make the at
task simultaneous, "and you may count on
it sure, that Vicksburg will go under."?
"We left," says the letter, "at Helena,
about 60,000 Federal troops, besides a
Urge force at Memphis. We were'fired
into on our way down,by six Confederates
from the shore, two-of the bullets striking
the boat auder the pilot house, one of
which I have as a touvtnicr. We were in
company with the gunboat Lexington, and
she waked up things in a very lively man
ner. Notwitstanding the desire we havo
to caltivnte the acquaintance of King Cot
ton we were exceedingly bashful in inn
ding his domains as the shores about here
are remarkably unhealthy for Yankees."
t&~ Tarn prices asked for ladies' shoes is
just about double what they were two
years ago. We are glad to see followed an
example set by Eugenie, and that,!/the
wearing of honest, double sole boots.:?
The story is told at oncei by the display in
the windows of the shoemakers' stores.?
Ladies now wear as tbitk boots as gentle
formerly wore. Such boots two years ago
could be bought for three dollars. This
was the outside figarej 'Families- were
supplied at this rate, and their bills sent in
twice a year. Tl? price is now five dol
lars, payable on delivery. Common ready
made shoes, eastern work, that formerly
could be sold only to the poorer or undis
crimminatiog class of people in the'cities,
now brings the former price of customer
work. The newly Introduced, thick aoled
boots for ladles, however,.. ?r? cheaper In
proportion than the otJ>?fy. A: single pair
of them will do a .wintpr>ifryi?^j,j^

North Mountain is about seventy-two milts
?from Cumberland and lbs road U oow'in
perfect repair between the two point*, in
cluding the bHflge' at Back Creek. The
road ia now completed within leven miles
of Martinsburgh,, and it. is ei pec ted that
by the first of January the whole roate
will be agaio.placed in order and that the
trains will be running between this city
?nd Baltimore. . The rebels destroyed the
road most effectually. For about twenty
miles along the route almost efery tiki and
was totally or partially destroyed. They
torn up. the ties ,and built log cabins of
tbem, upon which they laid oross-wlse the
iron rails. They then set the cabins on fire
and when the rails became red hot In the
middle they were bent around trees and
thrown aside. Many of these rails were
lUraigbtened out by the employees of the
company, but only after the greatest labor.
One. thing is quite apparent, that the reb
know bow to destroy a Railroad. They
hev*exhibited a genius in this regard that
is most remarkable.

'? Fight?Additional Par
Saturday'
ticulara.
Wajuiioto.v, Dec. 14.?.Up to midnight
no intelligence of importance had been re*
ceived from the army. Occasional firiag
during the day but of little consequence in
results. The taking of several rifle pits
/esterdaj evidently gave rise to the report
of the first line of the enemy's works bav
A number of wounded arrived-to-night
and were coo?eyed to the several hospitals
and another boat load on is the way.
The Herald says of Saturday's battle ft j
raged fiercely through the da? and even af
ter darknes?, fighting in our immediate,
front and by Somners grand division.
Shortly after 9 o'clock the 2d corps of
Qen. Oouch moved out from the npperpart
of the city with a stray detatchment of skir
mishers. The enemy yielded .with great
stubbornness and fo^ some time rattled
musketry incessant. At the same time the
movement commenced with batteries of the
division sU-tioned in bluffo across the river
and opeded~ wltti shell to cover onr a'd '
ranee. The rebel infantry having fallen
back to their first line of intrenebments and
i rifle pits, their batteries opened with vig
orous and rapid fire updfc our column
which had now come to a temporary halt,
awaiting the result of the artillery fight
ing.
For' aome time onr artillery on bluffs
kept up a heavy fire o'n'thA rebel batteries
with muoh better success. Batteries on
Taylor's hill nearly opposite Falmouth
finally silenced during this time. The rebel
artillery almost devoted to shelling our ad
vanced troops.
Hancock's division had the advance, sup
ported by the other division of corps, while
the 9th corps Gen. Wilcox, remained under
arms in town in readiness to advance.?
Soon after the whole corps deployed into
line of battle and moved forward to attack
and storm. Uie rebel right batteries, while
from the enemy's works a terrible shower
of shell, grape and shrapnel! tore through
their bleeding ranks, notwithstanding,
which they steadily rushed on to rifle
pits, within a short distance of the
first line of eutrenchments. From the
former they drove the rebels, mak
ing prisoners of some while* the remain
der took refuge behlod earthworks. -Thin
was accomplished after moft.herolo and
long continued efforts under a galling and
murderous fire. Unable to holdout agaiust
the terrible fire they now encountered, they
6nally retired in good order carrying away
their wounded "comrades. They tell back
to their original line of pickets, thus hold
ing the gronnd wbioh they first occupied
and which they held until morning when
they were relieved by Stoneman's com
mand.
Juat before.tbe advance of Couch's corps
heavy Bring and dense smoke on the left
indicated Franklin was advancing upon
end bad already engaged the enemy's right
flank. To open communication with him
therefore, WHcox detached bia division un
der Gen. Burns and aent it to the left by
the edge of the river with instructions to
advance under cover of the river bank un
til be could place himself in cloae proximi
ty to Franklin's right. After hard fighting
Coach's division being unable to carry the
rebel works, the tremendous fire from their
batteries rendered it neceasary for them to
retire which they did when the order had
been given for the third time. It was now
dark and the division fell back to its origi
nal poaition after being six hours uuder
fire after aevere fighting on Franklin's left
with varied success until dark. Relative
position of the forces about the same as in
the morning except that we bad gained
half a mile or more on the left
Washington, Dec. 15.?On Wednesday
evening our gunboats at Part Royal, 27
miles from Fredericksburg, were fired into
by a rebel battery supposed to nnmber 20
heavy guns One shot struck a coal
schooner and killed the Captain named
Simmons. Another struck the Carrituck,
going into the engine room, killing H. W.
Smith and wounding 3 others. The firing
was very rapid and continued till suodown
when the battery was silenced. Next
morning the gunboat* again opened on the
battery, but received no response.
