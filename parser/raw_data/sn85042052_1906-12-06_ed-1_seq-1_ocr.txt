Questions of Vital Interest to the

The following is the substance' of
the anuual message of President
Boosevelt to Congress, as read in both
buses: : ;- ':.
Introductory..
To the Senateand, House oRepres-
entatives: " ,
As a nation we still continue to en
joy a literally unprecedented prosper
ity; and it is probable that only, reck
less speculation and disregard of ligi
timate business methods on ,;the part
of the business Avorld can materially
mar this prosperity.

the present Congress. There were
several matters left unfinished at
your last session, however, which I
most earnestly hope you will com
plete before your adjournment.
Corporation Campaign Contributions,
I again recommend , a law prohib
iting all corporations from contribut
ing to the campaisn expenses of any
party. Such a bill has, already past
one Houss of Congress. Let individ
uals contribute as they desire; but
let us prohibit ineffective fashion all

Government's Right to Appeal In
Criminal Cases.
Another bill which has past one
House of the Congtess which it is
urgently necessary should be enacted
Mo law is that conferring upon the
Government the right of appeal in
iminal cases on questions of law
This right exists in many of the
Nates; it exists in the District, of
wramoia by act ot the Congress. It
of course not proposed that in any

ion of the" court to whicJi the appli
cation is made, after an examina
tion of the entire cause, it shall 'affir
matively appear that the error com
plained of has resulted in a miscar
riage of justice.
Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the
matter by the demand that the right
of applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of injunctions
in such cases would stand the test of
the courts ; in which case of . course
the legislation would be ineffective.
Lynching..
In connection with the delays of
the law, I call your attention and the
attention of the nation .to the prev
alence of crime among us, and above
TBlr-to"tlle epi'demic"of lynching and
mob violence that springs up, now in
one part of our country, now in an
other. Each section, North, South;
East and West, has its own faults; no
section can with wisdom spend its
time jeering at the faults of another
section; it should be busy trying to
amend its own shortcomings. To
deal with the crime of corruption it
is necessary- to have an awakened
public conscience, and to supphment
this by whatever legislation will add
speed and certainty in the execution
of the law. When we deal with
lynching even more is "necessary. A
great many white m3n are lynched.
but the crime is peculiarly frequent in
respect to black men. The greatest
existing eanse of lynching :is the per
petvation, especially by black ,nien,
of the hideous crime of rape the
most aboninahle in all the category
of crimes, even worse than murder.
Mobs frequently avenge the commis
sion of this crime by themselves tor7
tunng to death the man committing
it ; thus avenging in bestile fashion a
bcstile deed, and reducing themselves
to a level with the , criminal.
Capital and Labor.
In dealing with both labor and cap
ital, with the questions ' affecting both
sorporations and trades unions, there
is one matter more important to re
member than aught else, and that is
the infinite harm done by , preachers
of mere discontent. These are ten
who seek to excite a violent class hat
red against all men of ' wealth. They
seek to turn wise and proper move
ments for the better control of cor
p.orations and;. for doing away with
the abuses connected with wealth, m
to a campaign . of hysterical excite
ment and falsehood in which the aim
is to inflame to madness the brutal
passions of mankind. The sinister
demagogs and foolish visionaries who
are always eager to undertake such a
campaign oi destruction sometimes
seek to associate themselves ' with
those working for, a genuine reform
in" governmental and, social ' methods,
and sometimes masquarade as the
reformers. In reality they; are the
worst enemies of the cause they pro
fess to advocate just as the purvey
ors of sensational slander in news
paper of magazine are the worst
enemies of all men who are engaged
in an honest effort to better what is
bad in our social and governmental
conditions.
Railroad Employees' Honrs and Eight
Hour Law.
I call your attention to the need
of passing a bill limiting the number
of hours of employment of railroad
employees. The measure is a very
moderate one and I can conceive of
no serious opjectioh to it. Indeed, ; so
far as it is in our power, it should be
our aim steadily to reduce the num
ber of hours of labor, wfith as a goal
the general introduction of an eight
hour day. There are ; industries in
which it is ngt possible that the hours
of labor should be reduced; just as
there are communities not far enough

for their good, or, if in the Tropics,
so : situated that there( is no analogy
between their needs and : ours m this
matter. On the Isthmus of Panama.
for instance, the conditions " are in
every way so dinerent from , what
they are here that an eight hour day
would be absurd ; just as it is absurd.
so far as the Isthmus is concerned,
where white labor can' not be employ
ed, -to bother as to whether the. neces
sary work is done by alien black men
or by alien yellow men. But the
vageworkers of the United States are
of so hijrh a grade that " alike from
the merely industrial standpoint and
from the civic standpoint it should
bo our object to do what we can in
the direction of securing the genera
observance of an eight hour day.
Employers' Liability.
Among the excellent laws which the
Congress past at the last session was
an employers' liability law. It was
marked step in advance to get the
recognition of employers' liability on
the statuts books; but the law did not
go far enough. In spite of all precau
tions exercised by employers there are
unavoidable accidents and even
deaths envolved in nearly every line
of business connected with the me
chanic arts. This is enevitable sacri
fice of life may be reduced to a mini
mum, but it can not be completely
eliminated
Investigation, of Disputes Between
Gaptlai and Labor.
The commission ;, appointed by the
President October 16, 1902, at the re
quest of both the anthricite coal op
erators and miners, to inquire into,
consider, and pass upon the questions
in controversary in connection with
the strike in the anthracite regions of
Pennsylvania and the causes out of
which the controversary arose, in
tLeir report, findings,', and award exprest-the
belief "that the State and
Federal governments should provide
the machinery for what may be call
ed the compulsory invesigation of
controversies between employers and
employees when they arise."
Corporations.
The present Congress has taken
long strides in the direction of secur
ing proper supervision and control
by the National Government over
corporations engaged . in inters
business and the enormous majority
of corporations of any size are engag-
ed in interstate business, xne pass
increasing and rendering more effec-
tive national control over the beef-,
packing; industry, mark an impprtant
advace in the proper direction. ' In
the short session it will perhaps be
difficult, to do much further along this
line; and it may. be best to wait until
the laws have been in operation for a
number of months before endeavoring
to increase - their scope, because only
operations will show with exactness
their merits and their shortcomings
and thus give opportunity to define
what further remidial ; degislatioii is
needed. .Yet in my judgment it will
in the end be advisable in connection
with the packing house inspection law
to provide' for putting a date on tha
label and for the packers. : All these
laws have already jutified their en
actment. . - ' Agriculture.
The only other persons whose wel
fare is as vital "to the welfare of the
whole country as is the welfare of
the wageworkers are the tillers of the
soil, the farm-ers. It is a mere, trusim
to say that no growth of. -cities, no
growth - of wealth, no industrial de-
velopment can atone for any .'falling
off in the - character and standing of
the farming population. 'During the
last few' decades this fact has - been
recognized with ever-increasing clear
ness. -" t ' t . .
, " . ' . Marriage and Divorce.
I-am well aware of how-difficult it-
's to pass a constitutional amendment.
Nevertheless in my judgment the
whole question of marriage and di-

On the question of International
mora-ity Mr. Roosevelt ' comes out
strongly, advocating clean. dealing be
tween the nations of earth and also
strongly advocates international arbi
tration as a means of settling all dif
ficulties that may arise.,
r , American Shipping.
Let ma once - again call the atten
tion of the Congress to two subjects
concerning 'which -.1 have frequently
before communicated with them. Ono
is the question of developing "Ameri
can shipping. I trust that a. law em
bodying in substance . the. views, or a
major part of the views, exprest iu
the report on this subject laid beforo
the House at its, last session will be
past. I am well aware that in former
years objectionable measures have J
been proposed in reference to the en
couragement of American shipping ;
but it seems to me that the proposed
measure is as nearly unobjectionable
as any can be.
Currency Reform. -I-
especially call your attention to
the second subject, the condition of
our currency laws. The national
bankact has ably served a great pur
pose in aiding the enormous business
development of 'the country; and
within ten years there has been an
increase in circulation per capita
from $21.41 to $33.08. For several
years evidence has been accumulating
that additional legislation is needed.
Our Island Possessions.
It is irged that these-shall receive
the careful consideration of Congress
and that tariffs, etc., shall be upon a
iust basis. -
Am v and Waw. '
. The messae-e eoes at lenph infn ih
matter . of the "efficiency of our army
and navy. The - President is much
gratified at the progress we are mak
ing in both branches of our common
defense. In the matter of rifle prac
tice the President says: -
The Congress has most wisely pro
vided for a National Board for the
promotion of rifle practice. Excellent
results have alreadv come from this
law, but it does not go far enoujrh.
Uur.Kegular Army is so small that' in
any ereat war we should have to
trust mainly to volunteers; and in
such event these volunteers should
already, know how to shoot ;4f or if a
soldier has the fightiner edsre. and
ability to take care of himself in the
should establish shooting gallaries in
the large public and military schools,
should maintain national target
ranges m different parts .of the coun-
trv. and should i'n everv wav enmnr:

throughout all parts "of the land. The
