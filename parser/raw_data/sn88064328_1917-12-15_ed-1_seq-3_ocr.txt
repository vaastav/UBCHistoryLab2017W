world's best corn
only made it worse, and then you
put some "Qets-lt" on and the pain
eases rlKht away, and the corn peels
right off like a banana skin—
"ain't It a grand and heavenly feel
ing?"
"Oeta-It" has revolutionized the
corn history of the world. Millions
use It and It never falls. Ladies
wear smaller shoes and have pain
free feet. We old fellows and
young fellows forget our toes and
feel frisky as colts. Everybody
with a corn or callus needs ''Gets

IT HAPPENED IN NEW
IBERIA.
And Is Happening to New Iberi
People Every Week.
The case told below is not an
uncommon thing. The same oc
curs frequently and will contiue
to happen as long as folks have
kidneys and overtax the kidneys.
Jacob E. Martin, 110 Fröre St.,
New Iberia, says: "Several
years ago, I had a bad case of
lumbago. I couldn't straighten
up on account of the sharp pains
that caught me in tlip small of my
back and I didn't rest well «t
night. 1 often got up in the morn
ing tired and lanquid. I couldn't
get. relief no matter what I did.
I began taking Doan's Kidney
pills and the pain in my back
eased up and I could rest much
better at night. Pretty soon
could get around all right and it
only took one box ol Doan s Kid
ney Pills to tlx me up. J haven'tj
had « return of the trouble.
Price bOc, at all dealers. Don
simply ask for a kidney remedy
—■ get Doan's Kidney Pills the]
same that Mr. Martin had. Fus

JERUSALEM îs CAPTURE
BY BRITISH ARMY.
Washington* Dee. i 10. Rome
dispatches today, confirming early
reports of a lull after the fiercer
fighting in which the Teutons
failed to break through the lt.il
j an lines, say the Austro-tîernian
commander sacrificed hundreds of
thousands of his best men withou
improving his position.
Jerusalem, the holy city of the
Christian religion, for more than
1200 years in Moslem hands, h'is
finally been wrested from the
Turks. Tt has surrendered after!
being surrounded by the victor
jous British Palestine army.
| The ultimate fall of Jerusalem
has been considered virtually as
snred since the British took Jaff.1,
the eity's seanort. in mid-Novcm
her and shortly afterward push
within sight of Jerusalem.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.
This is not, only one of the best
and most efficient medicine for
coughs, colds and croup, but is
also pleasant and safe to take,
which is important when medi
cine must be given to children.
Many mothers have siven it their
unqualified endorsement.

$025 from a prosperous colored

Fortune tellers know that people
love to be humbugged and so
they charge them war-prices for
