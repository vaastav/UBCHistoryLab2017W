PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Review of the Affairs
of the Nation,
Our Relations with Foreign
Powers.
Recommendations Concerning Tariff
and Taxation,
Washington, Dec. 4.—The following is the Presi
dent's message delivered to Congress to-day, at
noon :
To the Senate am! Hv*e / Kept'c entatiees:
lu addressing my third annual message to the
law-making branch of the Government, it is grati
fying to be able to state that during the past year
success lias generally attended the efforts to execute
all the laws found upon thj statute books. The
policy has been not to enquire into the wisdom of
laws already enacted, but to learn their special in
terest and enforce them accordingly.
The past year has, under a wise Providence, been
one of general prosperity to the nation. H has,
however, been attended with more than the usual
chastisements in loss of life and property by storm
and fire. These disasters have served to cull forth
the l>cst elements of human nature in our country,
and to develop a friendship for ns on the part of
foreign nations, which goes far towards alleviating
the distress occasioned by the calamities. The
benevolent who have so generously shared their
means with the victims of these misfortunes will
reap their reward in the consciousness of having
performed a noble act, aud in receiving the grate
ful thanks of the men, women and children whose
sufferings they have relieved.
Foreign Relations.
The relations of the United States with foreign
powers continue to be friendly. The year has been
an eventful one in witnessing two great nations,
speaking one language, and in one lineage, setting,
by jveacefnl arbitration, disputes of long-standing,
and liable at any time to bring those nations into
bloodshed an a state of conflict.
An example has thus been set, which, if successful
in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized
nations, and be the final means of returning to pro
ductive industry m llious of men maintained to set
tle th' disputes of nations by the bayonet and broad
sword.
Ttvf Treaty.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded
to, which bus been concluded since the adjournment
of Congress with Her Britt.tunic Majesty, and a copy
of the protocols of the conferences of the Commis
sioners by whom it was negotiated.
The tr< aty provides methods for adjusting the
questions pending between the two nations. Vari
ous questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I
rce< raniend to Congress, at an early day, to make the
nee. —ary provisions for the tribunal at Geneva, ami
for the several commissioners on the part of the part
of the Unit <i States called for by the treaty, uis
M.ije.-t-. the King ■ f Italy, th- President of tle> Swiss
Confederation, and His Majesty, the Emperor of
Hrazil, have eaeh consented, on the joint request of
the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the
tribunal at Geneva.
1 have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed
for the readiu-ss with which the joint request has
been complied with by the appointment of gentle
men of eminence and loan line to those Important
positions. Hu* Majesty, the Emperor of Germany,
has bee;; pleased to comply with the joint request of
the tv i governments, and has consented to act as the
arbitrator of the disputed Costar boundary between
the United States and Great Britain.
The controlling parties in the treaty have under
taken to regard as settled, between themselves, cer
tain principles of public Ijw tor which the United
States have contended from the commencement of
their history They have also agreed to bring these
principle s to the knowledge of other maritime pow
ers, and to invite them to accede to them. Negotia
te -ns ar- going on as to the form of the note by
which the invitation is to be extended to the
powers.
I recommend the legi-d dlon necessary on the part
of the United St ;i. s to bring into operation Hie arti
cles in the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to the
other matter touching tho relations of the United
States towards the British American possessions, to
become operative as soon as the proper legislation
shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its
possession-:. It is much to be desired that this legis
lation may 1 1 conie co-operative before the fisher
men of the United States begin to make their prepa
rations for the coming season.
I have addressed a communication, of which a
copy is herewith transmitted, to the governors of
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan
Illinois and Wisconsin, Urging upon the governors
of those states, respectively, the necessity of ac
twity on their part io carry into effect the object
of tile article of the treaty, which contemplates the
canals on cither side, connected with the naviga
tion h the lakes and rivers, forming the boundary,
in let ms of equity, by iho inhabitan s of both
•outlines; and it i“ hoped that the importance of
the object.. Slid the bcr.efitji (n flow therofiv.m, will
secure the speedy approval of tho legislatures of
the states concerned.
I ec Noitluvet-tetn Bounilary.
I renew the recommendation for an appropriation
for determining the ti no position ot the 4Mth parallel
of latitude, where ii forms the boundary between
the United Stales and tho British North American
possessions, between the Bake of the Woods and tho
summit of the Rocky Mountains. The early action
of Congress on th - recommendation named, would
put in the power of the War Department to place a
force iu ihe field during the next summer.
Protection of German., in Pnrig,
Th resumption of diplomatic relations between
Fran a I Gen .. * • enabled me to give din -
lions for the withdrawal of the protection afforded
to Germans in Frauch by the diplomatic and consu
lar represent ati \ es of the United Statist in that coun
try. It is Just to add that the delicate duty of this
protection has been performed by the minister and
consulate at Pans, and the various consuls in France,
under th- sup rvision of the latter, with great kind
ness as well as with prudence and tact. Their
course has received the commendation of the Ger
man govrnment, and has wounded no susceptibility
of th" Frenoh. The government of the Empire of
Germany continues to manifest a friendly reeling
tow ards the United States, and a desire tn harmonize
with the moderate and just policy which this gov
ernment maintains in its relations with the Ar.;aH •
powers, as well as with thi Botrtb 'm;., i . n B pub
lic. t: • given arista? an be that the friendly feelings
of Hist 0 \ernraeut are fully shared by the United
Stab's.

Th* ratification of tho consular and naturalization

been changed. %
Italian Unit. .
I hav* been oflicfally informed of the annexation
of the States of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy,
and the removal of tho capital of that Kingdom to
Borne. In conformation with the established policy
of the United States, I harp recognized this change.
Treaty rtf Commerce with Italy.
The ratifications ol the new treaty of commerce
I is tween th- United States and Italy have been <x
-1 changed. The two powers have agreed in their
; treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from cap
ture in case of war between the tw.) powers. The
; United Stales have spared no opportunity of ineor
i perilling this rule into the obligations of nations,

I made an appropriation for the organization of a

i citizens of the United staffs against Spain, growing
1 out of the insurrection ill Ur.lks. That commission
has since bum organized. I transmit a copy of the
correspondence r luting to Us formation and its
jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this commission
"ill afford the claimants a complete remedy for their
injuries.
It lias been made the agreeable duty of the United
State- to preside over a conference at Washington

T tie Coifan Troubles.
The correspondence transmitted herewith shows
that theie is no disposition on the part oi this gov
ernment r > -werve from its established emirse
prompted by a desire to put an end to the barba
rous treatment of onr shipwrecked sailors on the
Corean coast.
1 instructed our Minister at Pekin to endeavor to
conclude a convention with Corea, for securing
the safety and humane treatment of such mariners”
Admiral Rog r was instructed to accompany him.
with sufficient force to protect him in vase of' need.
A small trveying party, sent out or. reacbitip th
coast, was treacherously attacked at i disadvantage.
Ample opportunity was given for explanation and
apology for the insult, and neither . amo. A force
was then landed, and after an arduous march over
a rugged and difficult country. the forts from which
the outr i.c had been committed, were gallantly '
assaulted, aud were destroyed. Having thus pun
ished the criminals and vindicated the honor of the
flag, the expedition returned, finding it impractic
able, under the circumstances, to constitute the de
sired convention.
I respectfully offer the correspondence relating
thereto therewith submitted, and "leave the subject
for such action as Congress may see (It to take.
llrlatloiH will* Mexico mid South
A merlin.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the
very objectionable law establishing what is known as
the Frozen Zone, the frontier of the United States.
It is hoped that this may yet be done, also that morn
stringent measures maybe taken by that republic
lor restraining lawless persons on the frontier. I
hope that Mexico by its own action, will soon relieve
the government of the difficulties experiences from
these causes. Our relations witli the various repub
lics of Central and South America, continue, with
one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I recom
mend action by Congress regarding the overdue
installments under the award of Venezuelan claim
commission in 1866.
[ The internal dissensions of this government *■-
I sent no justification for the absence of effort to make
their solemn treaty obligation. The ratification of
I an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has t>een ex
j changed.
Kma ucipiit ion in lltiiv.il.
It is a subject for congratulation that the great
empire of Brazil has taken the Initiatory steps to
ward tiie abolition olslavery. Our relations with that
empire, always cordial, will naturally be more so by
this act. It Is not too much to hope that the gov
ernment of Brazil may hereafter find it for its in
terest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance to
ward entire emancipation more rapidly than the
present act contemplates. Its true prosperity aud
greatness as a nation are to be found in the eleva
tion of its lalior.-rs.
Slavery In Spanish Colonies.
It is a subject of regret that the reforms in this
direction, which were voluntarily promised by the
statesmen of Spain, have not been carried out in
Its West Indian colonies. The laws and regula
tions for the apparent abolition of slavery m Cuba
and Porto Rico have left the laborers in bondage
with no hopes of release until their lives become a
burden to their employers.
V inert runs Own i ng Slh vrs.
1 desire to attract your attention to the fact that
the citizens of the United Stab's an' largo holders
in foreign lands, of this species of property, forbid
den by the fundamental law of their alleged country.
I recommend Congress to provide, by stringent leg
islation, a suitable remedy against the holding,
owning fir dealing in slaves, or being interested in
stave property on foreign inu.i-, either as owners,
hirers, or mortgagers of the United Htateu.
Cuba.
it is to he regretted that, the disturbance in the
island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoy
once and anxiety. The existence of a protracted
struggle in such close proximity to our own coun
try, without apparent prospect of an early termi
nation, cannot but he other than an object of con
ceru to a people who, while abstaining from inter
ference in tlie affairs of other powers, naturally de
sire to see every country in the undisturbed on pay
ment of liberty and the blessings of free institu
tions
Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have bean
instructed, in case it should be necessary, to spare
no effort to protect the lives and property oi bona
n ir American citizens, and to maintain the dignity
of the flag. It is hoped that all pending questions
with Spain, growing out of the affairs in Cuba, may
be adjusted in the spirit of peace and 'uncord which
has hitherto guided the two powers in the treatment
of such questions.

It "as highly desirable lb:o tlos 'nod dlmtnution

Improvement in the navy, and efliciencv of the naval
force, without material increase iu the exis-nse of
supporting It. This is due to thi noli . which has
been adopted and is being extended as fast ( ,s our
material will admit, of using smaller vessels as
cruisers on the several stations. By tlcso means we
have been able to occupy nt once a huger extent ot
cruising ground, to visit more frequently the poss
where the presence of onr flag is desirable, and gen
erally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate
duties of the navy in tune of peace, without ■ end
ing the number of men or th expenditures author
ized Py law.
During the past year, the navy ha , in addition
to its regular service, supplied thi men and officers
and the vessels of the coast survey, and has com
pleted the surveys authorized by Congress of the
Isthmus of Darien and Tehanutupec ; and under
like authority has sent out an expedition completely
furnished and equipped to explore the un uown
ocean of the North.
The suggestions as to the necessity for in
creasingand improving the material of the navy,
and the plan recommended for reducing (bo per
sonnel of the service ty a pea ce standing by Ibo
gradual abolition of certain grades of officers* and
reduction of others, and the" employment of some
in ttv service of the commercial marine, ure will
considered, and deserve the attention of Congress.
I also recommend that ail promotions in tin navy
above (he rank of capf du lie made by selection in
stead of senority, This course will ecu re in (he
higher grades greater efficiency, and hoi 1 out an in
cenfive tj our officers to improve themselves in the
knowledge of their profession.
The present cost of maintaining the navy, and its
"osl ce imps red with that of proceeding years, and es

| The enlarged receipts of the Port Cilice Depart

the vigor and stability of republic*, with a vast
territory like cur-, mt: h of it sparsely populate I,

be mu le self-snst lining, bat a gradual approai h to
this end from year to year is confident!v relied on,
and the day is not far distant when the Post Office

greater Messing to the whole peoj '.ethan it is now.
Ihe suggestions of the Postmaster General for
improvements in the department presided over by
him are earnestly recommended to your especi it
attention, especially the documents favorable to
the consideration of a plan tor uniting the tele
graph system of the Pnitcd States with the postal
sys’em.
It is believed that by such a course* the cost of
telegraphing could be much reduced, and the ser
vice as well, it not better, rendered. It would se
cure ti e further advantage bv extending the tele

of Congress sppr ived April tk.th, IS7I, and common
ly known as the Ku-Klux law.
In a portion of the state of South Carolina, the
necessity of the course ptxrsued will bo demonstrat
ed by the report of the commission to investigate
southern outrages, Under the provisions of the
above act I issued a proclamation calling the atten
tion of the people of the X.Tiiied States to the same,
and declaring my relnetanc. to oxercine any of the
extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon rue,
except in case of imperative necessity, but making
known my purpose to exercise such * ( v -wers when
ever it should become neceesarv to do so for
purpose of securing to all citizens ct the United
States the peaceful enjoyment of (he rights guaran- !
teed to them by the constitution and the law s.
After the passage of this law, information was;
received from time to time that combinations of j
the character referred to in this law existed ami I
wore powerfulin many parts ot the southern states, j
particularly in several counties in the state of Ninth !
Carolina. Careful invasilgation wu made, and It
was ascertained Unit In nine counties of that state j
such combinations were active and powerful, cm- i
bracing a sufficient jiortion of citizens to control i
the local authority, and having, among other
things, tile object of depriving the emancipated ;
class of tlie substantial benefits of freedom and of !
the privilege of the free political action of those
citizens who did not sympathize with their v ews
Among their operations were frequent soonrgiugs
and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated
al night by disguised persons, tin- victims in almost
all cases Ixiing citizens of different political sentl
meuts from tin ir own, or free persons who li:jcl
shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other
citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well dispos
ed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless vio
lence*
Thereupon, on flic 13th of October, 187 1. a procla
mation was issued in terms of tho law, calling upon
the members of the combinations to disperse within
five days, and to deliver to the Marshal or military
of the United States all their arms, ammunitions,
unllornis, disguises, and other means and imple
ments need by them for carrying out their- unlawful
purposes.
This warning not having Iteen heeded, on the 17th
of October another proclamation was issued suspend
iug the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus on
nine counties of that state. Direction was given that
within the counties sodesiguated, persons sitppost and,
upon reliable information, to be memiwrsot such
unlawful combinations, should be arrested by the
military forces of the United Nates and and. 1m red to
the Marshal, to he dealt with according to law.
In two of the said counties—York and Spartans
burg—many arrests have been made. At last ai>
counts the number of persons thus arrested was
one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred,
whose criminality was ascertained to lie of un in
ferior degree, were released for the present. These
i have generally made confessions of their guiit.
I (ireat caution lias lieen exercised hi making arrests.
! Notwithstanding the large number, it u believed
| that no innocent person is now in custody.
the prisoners will beheld for regular trial in the
i judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon us
j It appeared that the authorities of the United States
! were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the
law, many persons absconded, and there is good
ground for supposing that all such persons have
violated the law. A full report of what has been
done under this law vdl bo submitted to Congress
by the Attorney General.
The Mormons nl Poly "a my.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbar
ism, repugnant to civilization, decency, ami to the
laws of the United States. Territorial officers,
however, have been found who are willing to per'
form their duties in a spirit of equity, and with
due sense of sustaining the modesty ot the law.
Neither polygamy nor any other violation of ||,.-
statutes wid l>e permitted within the territory of
the United B*utc-. It is not with the religion of
these self-styled saints (hat we are now-Vsling,
but their practices. They will be protected in tin
worship of God according to tlie dictates of their
consciences, hut they will not be permitted to vio
late laws under the cloak of religion.
It may be advisable for Congress to consider
what, in t lie execution of laws against p-dwumv,
is to be the status ol the plural wives and their
offsprings. The propriety of Congress p raiog an
enabling act autli irlzing Die territorial legislature
of Utah to legitimatize all children born pri r to a
time fixed in the act, might lx- justified e v it- hu

The Indian Policy.
The policy pursued towards the Delian ; has re
sulted favorably, so far as can lie nidged from the
limited time during which it has been in operation.
Through the exertions of the various so i*dies ol
Christians, to whom have lieen entrusted fin- ex* cu-
Uou ot the policy, and the board of commissions
authorized by tin- law of April 10th, 18-!, many
tribes of Indians have ls-*-n induced to
settle upon reservations, to cultivate the
soil, an-1 perform productive abor *>t various
kinds, and to partially accept civilization.

Political Disabilities.
M< re than six years having elapsed since the lest
hostile gun was fired between the -enemies then ar
rayed against each other, one for the perpetuation,
the other for the demolition of the Union, it may
! well he considered whether it Is not now time that
the disabilities imposed by (he 14th amendment,
should be removed. Jt d< rs not exclude Ihe lllot,
but only requires the disability to hold ofTh-es of cer
tain classes. When the purity ot the liallot is se
cure, majorities are <-m. to elect officers
reflecting the views of the majoritv. I
do uot see the advantage or ' propriety
of excluding men from office merely.
They were before the rebellion of standing ami
character sufficient id be elected to posi
tions requiring them to take an oath to sup
port the constitution, nud admitting to eligi
bility of those entertaining precisely the same views,
but of less standing in their communities. It may
l>e sai 1 that the former violated his oath, ■uhile the
latter did not. The latter did n' t have it in his
power to do so. If they had taken this oath, it can
not be doubted they would have broken it, as did the
former class. If then- art? any great criminals, dis
tinguished above all others for the part they took in
opposition to the government, they might, in the
judgment of the conquerors, be excluded from such
an amnesty. This subject is submitted for your
careful consideration. The condition of the south
ern states is unhappy, not such as all true patriotic
citizens would like to see; social ostracism for
opinion’s sake, personal violence and threats towards
persons entertaining political vices opposed (,< those
entertained by the majority of the citizen . prevents
immigration, ami the fl.iiv of much needed capital
into the slates lately in rebellion.
It will be a happy condition of country when the
old citizens of tb. se stales shall lake an interest in
public affairs, promulgate the idea honestly enter
tained. to vote for men representing their views,
permit the freedom of the press and ballot to those
entertaining different political convictions.
The District of Columbia.
Under the provisions of the act of Congress ap
proved Feb. 21, IS7I, a territorial trouernmeni v. as
organized in the District of Columbia. Its results
have thus far fully realized the expectations of its
advocate.-. Unch r tbt direction of the ti i; itOli.d of*
fleers a system of improvements lias I ecu inaugur
ated. by means of which Washington is rapidly be
coming a city worthy of (be nation’s capito], the cit
izensj of the Ifistrict having voluntarily taxed them
selves to a large amount, for the purpose of con
tributing to the advancement of the seat of govern
ment.
I recommeud liberal appropriations on the p.'rt of
Congress in order that the government may 1 ar its
just share of the expense of carrying out various
systems of improvements.
CovrrnniMit Buildings i i’liirnga.
By the Are in Chicago the most important
of the government buildings in that cit> were j
consumed. Those burned had already become i
inadequate to the wants of the government in ‘
that growing city, and looking to the near fu.
ture were totally inadequate. I recommend, i
therefore, that an appropriation be made immediate
ly to purchase the remainder of the entire square on
which the entire building stood, provided it can be
purchased at a fair valuation, and provided the
legislature ol Illinois will pass a law authorizing its
occupation for government purposes, and also
make au appropriation of as much money is can be
properly expended towards the erection of new
buildings during the fiscal year.
Inns ignition.
The number of immigrants, ignorant of our laws
and habits, and coining into our country annually, i
has become great, and the impositions practiced i
upon them so numerous and flagrant, that I eng-1
p<?“t congressional action lor their protection. It
t-vemg to me the affair is a subject or li-gis ation by
Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire
the nature of the complaints by immigrants of the
treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so
during the session ot Congress, particularly if the
subject should receive your attention.
The Tori If on Taxes,
I scnniß end that all lazes from infernal sources
be abolished, except (hose on splriloun, vinous and
mult liquors, and tobacco, in Its various forms, from
stamps. In readusting the tariff, 1 suggest that a
caretul estimate be made of the amount ot surplus
revenue collected, under the present laws, after pro
viding for the current expenses of fho government,
(he internal account, and a sinking fund ; and that
this surplus he reduced in such manner as to afford
tho greatest revenue.
There are many articles not produced at In me, such
as medicines compounded by druggists, from which
but little revenue Is derived, but which enter into
general use. Such articles I roc >mmend to be placed
on the tree lists. Should further redaction prove
advisable, I would then recommend that i! be made
up on article , which can hear it without disturbing
home produel ions, or reducing the wages of American
labor
1 have not entered into figure s bec,ni. to do bo
would bo to repeat ail that is laid before you in the
report ot llie Secretary of the Treasury. The present
laws for collecting revenues pa collectors too small
salarh -. but provi Ic for shares in . ii seizures, which,
nt principal ports of entry yarticularly raise the com
pensation of these officials to alsrge sum. It has al
ways seemed to mu as if this system must at times
work perniciously.
D holds out an induce nent to dishonest men.should
such get possession of these offices, to be lack in their
scrutiny of goods entered, to enable I hem finally to
make large seizures. Vuur attention is respectably
invited to this subject.
Tin- Civil Service.
It has been the aim of the administration to on
force Honesty and efficiency in all public offices.
Kvery public servant, who has violated the trust
placed in him, has been proceeded against with all
the vigor of the law. If bad men have secured [daces
it lias been tho fault of the system established by law
and customs, for making appointments, or the fault
of those who recommend tor government positions
persons not sufficiently well-known to them person
ally, or wno give letters endorsing the character of
office seekers without a proper sense of the grave re
sponsibility which such a course devolves upon them.
\ civil service reform which can correct this abuse
is much desired. In mercantile pursuits, the busi
ness man who gives a letter of recommendation to a
friend, to enable him to obtain credit from a stran
ger, is regarded as morally responsible for the integ
rity of hia friend and his ability to meet his obliga
tions.
A reformatory law. which would t nforce this prin I
cii'le i.gainst all endorsers ot persons for public
places, would ensure great caution in making recom
mendations. A salutary lesson has been taught tho j
careless and dishonest servant in tho great numbci
of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years.
If Is gratifying to notice the favorable change which 1
is taking place throughout the country in briugingto
punishment those who have proved recreant to the 1
trust, confided in them, and In elevating to public
offle none but those who possess the confidence ol
honest and virtuous men, who will always be found
to comprise Mm majority of the community in which
they live In my message to Congress one year ago. I
urgently recommended a reform in the civil service
I of tho country. In conformity with that recommend-
I ation. Congress in the 9th section of an act making
appropriations tor sundry civil expenses of the gov
I eminent, and tor order purposes, approved March 3,
I 1871, gave the m-eoasary anti orhy to the executive to
I inaugneatta a civil service uit am, and placed open
i him the rt sponsihilUy of doing so. Under the author-
I tty of said act, 1 convened a board of gentlemen,
i eminently qualified for the work to devise
I rub sand tegulatious to effect a r form.
Their labors are not yet complete, but it is believed
that they will succeed in devising a plan which can
I b:; adopted to the great relief of the executive, the
[ heads of departments, and nieiiibcrH of Congress,
I which will redound to the interest of the public ser
vice. At all events, the experiments shall have a fair
trial.

Tlii' Boston correspondent of the
Rochester Democrat writes:
The old adage that “you can't
i always tell what a man is worth by the
; dot lies he wears," is true in more senses
than one. One of the most poverty
| stricken looking men that searches our
business thoroughfares for old papers
! is woitn half a dozen brick building at
the South end, and an old apple woman
in the vicinity of Kilby street pays
i taxes on a >40.000 house in the same
i part of the city. The foundation of
the wealthiest foreign fruit house in
town. Draper & Cos., was laid by selling
domestic fruit on a street corner thirty
years ago. Some men have a knack of
turning everything into greenbacks
which they touch. Opportunity, too,
is one of the elements of success.
The head waiter of the Parker

\ Connecticut l ady Badly bold.
The pustofiee department recently
received from the Secretary of the
Treasury a box containing 19,500 can
celled postage and revenue stamps.—
These stamps were forwarded to the
Treasury by a lady residing at Bridge
port, Conn., who says that she is one
of a Bible class; that she was told by
the superintendent of her Sunday
School that if she would collect one
million stamps the government would
give her $3OO. She, therefore, for
wards a part of the required number
and requests pay for them />ro rata.
She states that if the government wants
a collector of defaced stamps she will
accept such a position for a reasonable
compensation. Gen. Terrell, Third
Assistant Fostmastet General, replied
to her letter, saying that cancelled
stamps possess no value whatever, and
that the newspaper rumors that the
government will pay for such stamps is
doubtless intended as a “sell.”

OLD JESTBOOKS.
'JokrM Current Among Our Ancestors.
Few plays were anciently considered
complete without a clown, ami he was
a much more important and privileged
person in liis day than in onr own. He
not only entered upon the stage at the
proper times, hut continually mixed
with the company, and attempted to
excite merriment by any species of buf
foonery that occurred to him. Richard
Tarltoii, who played between 1570 and
1588. was one of the most popular and
notorious of these extemporizing clown.
Always on the lookout for a joke, ho
was not content with confining his at
tentions t<> the company on the stage,
but constantly spurred with the aud
ience. Nor were the lattet backward
in inciting him to rhyme on themes
which were generally concocted before
hand, in order to puzzle Tarlton when
he appeared before them. Thus is re
lated ‘‘Tarlton's Jest of a Gridiron,”
which we give in its original quaint
style for to translate it into modern
language would destroy the best part
and injure the rest :
“While the queen’s players lay in
Worcester city to get money, it was his
custom for to sing extempore of themes
gived him; amongst which they were
appointed ao play the next day. Now
one fellow of the city, among the rest,
that seemed quaint of conceit to lend
other youths with his fine wit, gave out
that tho next day he would give him a
theme to put him to a nonplus. Divers
of his friends acquainted with the same,
expected some rare conceit. Well, the
next day came, and my gallant gave
him his invention in two lines, which
was this;
*• ‘ Metblnks it i a thiuc unfit
To see a gridiron turn the spit. ’
The people laughed at this, thinking
his wit knew no answer, which angered
Tarlton exceedingly, and presently with
a smile, looking about, when they ex
pected wonders, lie put it oil’ thus :
“ ‘Mfthlnks it is a thing unlit
To see an ass nave anv wit. ’
“An old painter, at the repairing of
a church, was writing sentences of
Scripture upon the walls. By chance a

and reading them perceived much false
English. 4 Old man,’said my friend,
I‘why do you not write true English ? 4
I ‘Alas! sir,’ said tho painter, ‘tbev are
| poor, simple people in tliis parish, and
i they will not go to the cost of it.,’
“A justice of peace being angry with
| a pilfering knave, said, ‘Sirrah, if thou
dost not mend thy manners, thou wilt
|be shortly hanged, or else 1 will be
hanged for thee.’ The bold knave re
plied, ‘ I thank your worship for that
I kind oiler, and 1 beseech your worship
i not to be out of the way when I shall
; have occasion to use yon.”
“ A cardinal kept a knavish fool for
: his recreation, to whom he said,‘Sirrah
| fool! suppose that all tho world were
1 dead but thou and I, and that one of us
| should be turned to a horse, and the
i other of us to an ass, say which of the
1 two wouldst thou choose to lie ? The
| fool answered, ‘Sir, you are my master
| and for that respect it is fit that your
lordship should choose first, and I will
ibe contented to take that which you
leave ' * Why, then,’ said the cardinal,
I, would be a horse.’ ‘No,’said the
fool, ‘ let me entreat your worship to
be an ass, for I would choose to be an
i ass above till things., ‘ Why?’ quoth
! the cardinal. ‘Marry,’said the fool,
i because that 1 have known many asses

The New Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs,
From the Nov Ynrk Times.
The appointment of Gen. Francis A.
Walker, lately head of the Census Bur
eau, to be Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs, is one which reflects the greatest
credit upon the. President, end which
will prove eminently satisfactory to all
who desire a proper solution of our
Indian difficulties,
Gen. Walker is clear-headed, decis
ive, energetic, unimpeachably honest
and humane. He will not suffer the
Indians to he abused or cheated : but he
will require them to keep the peace,
ond will see to it that they are not un
duly petted, nor cheated by speculators
in the Indian Ring, nor allowed to
, murder at will He will boa terror to
I dishonest agents, and his appointment
gives reason to hope that the misman
agement and corruption which have
caused 111 the past, and under other
Administrations, so much waste and
trouble among the Indians, will now
be finally remedied.
To the people of the Western Terri
tories, where the Indian question is
one of Constant excitement and vexation,
we can say, that they have now at the
head of Indian affairs a man who will
do all that is just and honest, and to
whom they may look for protection,
and very energetic protection too, from
the class of men who, in too many eases
have excited Indian difficulties by their
corrupt and reckless conduct, as sub
ordinate agents of the Government.
Nor will he allow a sentimental desire
to", permit the Indians to stand in the
way of making them obey the laws and
keep the peace with their white neigh
bors.
Victor Fiumannel’s Opinion of Napo
leon.
A characteristic story of King Victor
Emmanuel is related by M. dTdeviUe,
formerly French charge d'affairs at
Turin, in his diary now in course of
publication in the Journal do Paris.
The King having received a letter from
Napoleon HI., in which the latter re
voked certain promises lie had made
to him on a former occasion, was furi
ous, and took the first opportunity of
venting his anger on the Emperor’s
representative. At the next court ball
he summoned J rince Latour d’ Au
vergne to his presence in a private room,
and addressed him in these words:
“After all, what is this Emperor of
yours? the last comer among the Eu
ropean Sovereigns—an intruder and a
parvenue. Let him remember what he
is, and what I am- I, the head of the
first and oldest Royal dynasty that now
reigns in Europe.” Prince Latour lis
tened to this outburst with as much
calm? ess as he could command, and
then observed. “Sire, you will per
mit me not to have heard a single word
that yon have spoken.” The King
said nothing but turned away. In the
course of the evening, however, he
came again to the Pnnce, and tapping
him familiarly on the shoulder, whis
pered in his ear with a smile, “You
need not report our conversation of to
day to Paris, cher prince. Besides you
told me yourself that you did not hear
what I said.”
It is said that Robert Gibson, who
was killed ia the rubber factory at New
Haven, was the only employe who un
derstood the secret process of welding
rubber, and his death is a serious loss
to the company.

O you, in homes of wealth and ease,
WUh naught of care ;
Where music floats upon the breeze,
And perfumes rare
From sweet exotic flowers rise ;
Where mellowed light
From col >red windows greet your eyes—
An Eden quite.
You, who have every thing to love
And much to bless ;
Your voices, sure, should rise abo-'e
In thankfulness.
And yeti, whose path is not as sweet
With perfumed flow’ra—
Who tread on (horns with bleeding feet
Through weary hours;
Within whose homes dwell want aud cold.
And naught of cheer;
Whoso misery may not be told
To mortal ear—
It is by you the angels wait
With sweet caress.
To fill tour spirits, soon or late.
With thankfulness.
O, who in all this peaceful land
