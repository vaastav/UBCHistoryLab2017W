The Panama Charges.
Congress !s asked to investigate rertaln t0
serious allegations respecting the Panama j .j
eanal. Did or did not certain Americans '
Cfi
share largely In the money paid In conc?i
nection with the acquiring by this government
of the propertv rights of the fr
Panama Canal Company? ^
It is not a new charge, but finds its
present interest in the notice given it by ^
the President in his letter to "William D. " 1
Foulke.
An important feature of the matter is
the fact that the democratic national m
Cl]
committee refused to father the story in
C
the recent campaign. It took the matter
under consideration, but could not see its 1
way clear to use the material. On its as
special committee of advisement was Sen- re
ator Culberson, one of ins party's most
distinguished lawyers. It Is to be as- t0
sumed. therefore, that the story as sub- ei
? Kim am Bftf ahnn; ?nffieient RUT>- T1

port. At any rat<\ the committee declined
It, and the story was used by certain
newspaj>ers, but made no Impression
on the voters. ti
Two of the names involved are those of hi
Douglas Robinson and Charles P. Taft. tl
Mr. Robinson is a brother-in-law of Mr. to
Roosevelt, and Mr. Taft a brother of Wil- d<
11am H. Taft. Both are men of the high- w
est standing in both social and business m
circles. Mr. Roosevelt has spoken for d?
Mr. Robinson in explicit denial of the th
charge as relating to him, and Charles P. a
Taft speaks for himself. Mr. Taft inti- jn
mates that he may take the matter into m
court for redress of the wrong that he w
asserts has been done to him.
In his letter to Mr. Foulke tihe President '
states that all of the papers in possession ^
of this government bearing upon the case
are. and from the first have been, accessi- ^
ble to everybody with a desire to Inspect
them. Many of them have not been
printed because of their lack of interest

cealed, and all may bo examined at any ra
time. The President's letter is almost in
the tone of inviting an investigation. *
This is not a proper matter with which '
to play politics, and if that consideration re
weighed with those democratic committee- *
men who would not indorse it for use in 01
Mr. Bryan's behalf their Judgment is to tfl
be complimented. But now that the a
presidential campaign is over, and the c*
matter has been revived In the fashion re
known, a formal investigation of all the h'
charges that iiave been made might very
well follow. The President does not fear w
the suggestion, and of course the Prest- w
dent-elect does not. Mr. Robinson is 01
probably serene, and Charles P. Taft, so
far from fearing an investigation by Congress,
is thinking of asking for one by Si
the courts. If the charges are without n<
warrant those who have made them will "T1
suffer severely in public estimation botih
at home and abroad. Why not, in the te
public behalf, probe them?
, lo
Deadly Weapons. w
Representative Sims' bill to punlsli the pi
carrying of deadly weapons more severely cc
is excellent as a" cure for this evil as far c
as it goes, but it does not reach the a'
source. It proposes to declare every person?with
certain necessary exceptions? 'n
who carries, concealed or openly, a pistol, 1)1
bowie knife, dirk, blackjack, dagger, ^
elmpshnt or metal knuckles
v?uvu?v| - ?guilty
of a felony, to be punished on conviction
by imprisonment for not less than
one nor more than three years. That is
just the kind of law that is needed, not
only here, but elsewhere, to discourage s'
the practice of carrying life-taking weapons.
But as long as men can buy without
check pistols, dirks, knuckles and the w
like they will continue to do so, taking p'
their chances on being detected. It is
obvious that the likelihood of catching a 1
weapon-bearer is slight. Usually the pis
tol "toter" who does not disclose himself
by taking life is caught through an
accident.- or he Is arrestejJ for some other w
offense, and on being searched is found to
l?e armed. By the very nature of the offense 111
it is difficult of ascertainment. It is, there- V1
fore, urgently important to strike at the 8*
source of the evil, the vendor, whose show lt
cases and windows are filled with crime- P
causing implements, tempting the evilly T
disposed, the hot tempered, the jealous
and the revengeful. There will be no ^
real reform in this regard until the law ai
puts this traffic under stringent regula- la
tion. As Representative Sims had his
measure outlined before the House con- s<
vened. It included in its prohibition the
offering for sale and selling of all weapons
of the Interdicted descriptions. Until
some sale-regulating feature Is added the n
proposal stands merely as a move toward ?
on increase of the ii inishment of the arun- ^
carrier when he is caught.
If the magazine with which Mr. Roose
velt Is to lie associated undertakes to
share in all his newspaper quarrels, there
are busy days ahead for its columns.
Xord Alexis was compelled to retire ^
from his administration without even the p
formality of sending a message to any
branch of the government.
1 *** ' ig
Party Leadership and Following. 8<
The Richmond Times-Dispatch, like
many another good democratic newspaper,
is deeply troubled, Listen: el
"Since Mr. Bryan will pass no self- ^
denying ordinance on himself, the opinion
is overwhelming that new* and vigoroils
leadership must arise which will
make this perennial willingness of his
permanently futile. Where can such ir
leadership arise so properly as In the c<
south? What is the democratic party
today except th-* south? And what has
southern democracy to learn or to expect c
from Tom Taggart, Haskell and "Fingy" .s<
Conners?" p
Excellent, as far as it goes. But it does c
not solve the problem. c
Let us suppose a southern man of abll- tl
Ity and character?and there are many a
such?at last in the limelight, with his
section solidly and resolutely behind him w
in an effort to make the south the center
of things democratic. His friends pro- "
claim him the new leader, and the other t>
sections are rotiiled. Let us suppose him ti
accepted as Mr. Bryan's successor, and P
nora?iat*d for President. Then what? c
This man cannot be elected by the 1<
south. He must add to her votes the .*
votes of other states, and he aeeks them v
whpre they have often been sought by o
Other democratic nominees?in states
where at one time his party was strong. a
Let us suppose him turning to Indiana, a
He finds Mr. Taggart his party's repre- d
t
entatlve there, and the state's member
i" democratic national committee. I
innot get along without him. Shall 1
et along with him? If he calls Mr. Ta
art to his side for the campaign the s
ance in case of success will run longt
br Mr. Taggart will be worthy of 1
ire, and will demand his wages. He w
ant to represent Indiana behind 1
irone.
JLet us suppose this southern man tur
ig to New York. There, stand Mr. Co
ers and Mr. Murphy. Between them th
>ntrol the democratic machinery of t
ate. Without them this southern nu
in do nothing. If he strikes hands wi
tern it must be on their terms. Th
now his necessities, and are not gent
generous in driving a bargain. If 1
ins they must dispense the New Y"o
itronage. If he refuses their terms h
rntest is without hope from that day.
? bargains with them, and wins, he mu
?ep his word.
This Is what the southern democra
in learn, and should learn, from Ta
irt and Conners and others of their kin
s objectionable as iney art-. uit-.v ?
presentative party men in their respe
ve localities. They are indispensable
irty success. The strongest and mo
tractive southern man could no mo
jt them aside as matters stand, and ho;
i win. than Mr. Bryan could have dor
r. Bryan accepted their assistance b
Luse he wanted to win, but was hant
ipped by it instead, and lost, partly b
iusc of it. But had he turned aw;
om them he would still have lost, for
iat event they would have knifed him.
It- is not so much a question of leade
ilp, or where the leader comes from, ;
is a question of following. The mo
uinent and attractive southern man cou
>t reach the White House with the aid
icli allies as he would now have to a
pt in New York, Indiana, Illinois, ai
?ewhere. The democracy in those state
i a national factor, does not enjoy tl
spect of the country. Reorganizatio
om the ground up. is absolutely essenti
success. It is certain to add to existii
nbarrassmeqfs, but it is bound to com
he life of the democracy demands it.
A High-Pressure Object Lesson.
New York yesterday had a demonstr
on of the efficiency and economy of tl
Igh-pressure service, recently installi
lere. A blaze developed in a dow
wn building in circumstances which, u
?r the former method of fire flghtln
ould have required five alarms, sur
oning at least twenty steamers ai
'moralizing the entire departme:
trough the shifts occasioned by so lari
turnout of apparatus. The fire occurri

able - materials. On either side of

igln a great conflagration would ha1
;en almost surely the result. By meai
' the high-pbessure service, howevc
le flames were confined to the fir
ructure." The fire was literally drowni

jt In commission with a water pressu
inglng from 125 to 175 pounds. With
ro hours from the first alarm the fl

id been summoned as an emergeni
serve were dismissed save two th

le building. After It was all over, wi

llefs declared that there was no long

This Instance of high-pressure efflclen
lould be thoughtfully considered by Co
ess with reference to the Dlstricl

ent of this nature will cost $750,0(
oubtless as much as that was saved ye
rday in New York. Some day, if t!

Taft and Strenuogity.
Judge Taft" Is getting a foretaste
hat awaits him when he takes up t
utles of the presidency. There will
lany demands on his time, and on
ariety of subjects. Fortunately he

resident is not for this day and hoi
he neoDle want to see and hear t

'ashtngton or elsewhere, the sight of hi
nd a word ifrom him often fit the pop
ir program. Some Presidents will enji
lis more than others, but all will su
irlbe to the change.

That portion of the President's messa
rhich relates to the preservation of t

oily to close the eyes to actual corn

Iresses himself to questions of imp<
of tance and Interest. In addition to matters i
le of present heated controversy sucli as the *

tensity a wide field of earnest labor for !j

P~ The Smithsonian Institution is to be
so congratulated upon securing the services
re of so distinguished a collector and field !
re agent. For years to coma it may point
with pride to the circumstance that at a
at critical period In the history of the instils
tutlon, when the government was hiding <
ir- its head in shame because the "national
>(j collections are very deficient in natural
history materials from the dark contl- ne
nent," an ex-President came to the res- _
on cue, crossed the raging seas. Invaded p
im trackless African wilds and filled a longbe
felt national want. We wish Mr. Rooae.
velt all the glory and the fullest measure
of success in Ids labors In bihalf of
be science. May his name be writ large on
the pages of zoology and botany; may
his collections of Africa fauna and flora
be the envy and despair of all other nations.
He is in the service of Uncle C
Sam. May all good luck, honor and also
he the happiness to which a patriotic and A
be altruistic sportsman and scientist Is entitled
be his portion. The Smithsonian In. t'
stitution is indeed fortunate In securing
,B the co-operation of Mr. Roosevelt; and it *
ed may be added that Mr. Roosevelt is to be ?
ng congratulated upon associating the Smith- i
sonian with his dash into darkest Africa.
" It is a very happy community of inter- ?

lm Consideration for Consumptives. fc
U~ From the New York Bun.
While much praiseworthy work has been y
done in recent years by the health au- 1
thorities and sanitarians to arouse In tihe
public a comprehension of the communl- j
e- cability of tuberculosis and the imports
tance of adopting safeguards to prevent
the spread of consumption there has been
an unfortunate by-product of the agltation.
People have been frightened out
of the ordinary sentiments of humanity ~
toward the sick. We trust, therefore,
its that the growing appreciation of uhe
iet communicable character of disease will
not make the public hard-hearted. The
or sick must be cared for somewhere, and
they must be cared for kindly. Buying
ail the Red Cross stamps in the world at
til Christmas time will not atone for the
ag selfish exclusion of hospitals and dispensaries
from localities where they can do
*** the most good.
