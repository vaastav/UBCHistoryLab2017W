with Russia Before Congress

COMMITTEE REPORT ON MONDAY
Attempt to Shorten Usual Procedure
Defeated After Debate.
STATE DEPARTMENT DISCUSSED
Callont Ilefers to Statement of Pres
ident Taft that He la at Work on
taeatlon and Will Take
Action After Holiday.
WABHINGTON, Dec. 14. Abrogation of
the Russian treaty of 1832 because of dis
crimination against American Jews and
others may become the law of the land
before the Christmas holiday recess of
congress.
The Bulzer resolution already adopted
by the house, directing: the termination of
the treaty after a year's notice, was
brought up today In the senate. The re
sult of a running debate on the question
of whether to refer it to the committee on
foreign relations or to act Immediately
was an assurance from the committee
that It would report on Monday. The
senate may then adopt either the resolu
tion, with a slight change, or the Culber
son resolution, practically identical.
The debate In the senate Included some
discussion of the attitude of the State
department. Senator Culberson, wanted
immediate action on Monday without
, refernce to the committee. He contended
that notice of abrogation cannot take
effect until one year after "the first day
of January following the action of con
gress," and therefore, If the resolution
should fall of adoption before the holi
days. It could not go Into effect until
3914, or more than two years hence.
Committee to Act at One.
Senators Cullom and I.odge pleaded for
reference to the committee. Both pledged
their utmost efforts to obtain committee
action In the senate on Monday. '
"I have no doubt that we can do It,"
Benalor Cullom said.
Mr. Lodge also lent his assurance.
Senator Rainier was somewhat skepti
cal! as to the committee's ability to agree
within that time. He pointed out the
possibility of differences of opinion.
"The time bos come for a determination
rf this question," he said. "The argu
ment is all one way. The treaty has
been violated for the last forty years.
Time and again we have yielded. We
should act now." -
Senator Clark of Arkansas contended
that if tha treaty was to be disposed of
promptly action should be taken. YltfcccB
refer nnra to tha souiwlWtW"11,'! tmitf'Wn
cress should either aot Immediately upon
the general public demand or go Into the
question thoroughly.
Senators Lodge. Bacon and Cullom re
fused to accept the view that the Stats
department was on trial.
"The president has told us."- Senator
Cullom said, "that he Is at work on the
question and will have something ready
after the holidays and the secretary of
slate assured me a day or two since that
he expected to accomplish something of
value to the country."
Finally the house resolution was re
ferred to the foreign rotations committee
Which will meet on Monday.

Brandeis Explains
La Follette Bill to
Senate Committee
WASHINGTON. Dec. li. - Louis D.
Brandeis of Boston today advocated be
fore the senate Interstate commerce com
mittee the La Follette bill designed to
supplement the Sherman anti-trust law.
Mr. Brandeis said there was no such
thing as a natural monopoly in Industry.
It the law prohibiting the practices
tlVVMfa which existing combines grew up
ttmmH fee, eWtrly defined and enforced.
h salft, m trust would arise la Ihe fu
ture. "Supporters of the La Follette bill." he
(aid, "believe In competition in indus
try on economic, social and ' political
grounds. They agree that only unrea
sonable restraints of trade Mhould be pro
hibited. But they believe the law Is in
adequate, difficult of application and un
satisfactory In its remedies. They pro
pose to let the law remain, but to sup
plement it with provisions remedying
these defects.
"There ore no natural monopolies ln"in
dustry. Kven the Oil trust got contro.
by ruthless violations of law, by criminal
rebating, bribery and corruption which
brought it wealth with which to destroy
competitors by price cutting and like
processes.
"The Steel trust acquired control, not
through greater efficiency, but by buy
ing plants and ore supplies at fabulous
prices. Not one industrial monopoly Is
a natural growth."
Mr. Brandeis contended that It would
be Impracticable for the government to
fix the selling price for monopoly prod
ucts because of the absence of data to
determine what would conatltute a rea
sonable return on capita!.

Third Trial of Dr. Hyde Is ftet for'

In the Papers.
KANSAS CITY, Dec. 14. Following the
return of Harry Waldron, the missing
Juror In the Hyde murder trial. Judge
Porterfleid this afternoon discharged the
Jury. He held that Waldron was Insane
at the time he escaped and Is still Insane.
January 2, ii;, was Bet as the date for
beginning a new trial.
Pale and emaciated, weak from hunger
and exposure, Harry Waldron, tho Juror
whose escape last Sunday night blocked
the progress of the second trial of Dr. B.
Clarke Hyde, charged with the murder
of Colonel. Thomas H. Swope, returned
to his home today. He was brought Into
court by Mrs. Waldron and after a con
ference with him Judge Porterfleid an
nounced that ho would dismiss the entire
Jury on the ground of Waldron's mental
Incompetence.
HIb eyes shifting and every movement
betraying shattered nerves, Waldron de
scribed to Judge Porterfleid four days of
wandering through the country In search
of "fresh air and freedom from confining
walls and staring eyes."
He denied having discussed the Hyde
trial with any person. His narrative to
the Judge, told In the presence of his
weeping wife, all but brought tears to
the eyes of his Inquisitor.
Waldron Telia of Wandering.
"I had been driven almost distracted.
Judge, before I got my feet on the ground
and got to the country," he said, "but I
don't think I'm crasy. I couldn't stand
being cooped up. I felt imprisoned. There
seemed to be nothing but walls and eyes
around me. I longed for the fresh air.
When I would go into court I could
hardly hold myself, the stares of the peo
ple worried me so. So that night I de
cided to get away from It. The first
thlng when my foot hit the ground after
sliding down the fire escape, the thought
came to me that I had dons wrong. I
was going to return. Then I thought of
a fine and possible other punishment, and
I fled.
' got a street car to Argentine, and
fnefB caught "a"frelght"tfain that was
going away from the city. I got off at
Emporia, Kan. There I shaved off my
mustache, and that afternoon, It was
Monday, I read of my escape in the
papers. That , worried me so that t
couldn't eat.
"It told of the possibility of my com
mitting sui'Mde. I thought of my poor
wife and children thinking of such a
thing and decided to return home no mat
ter what the consequences. I got to Kan
sas City, Kan., Tuesday night after
wandering miles through the fields and
going on a freight oar part of the way.
Then I lost my nerve again. I went to
William Moore's house in Kansas City,
Kan., and slept two hours Tuesday night,
the only real sleep I had had since I left
the Jury hotel.
ftpende Day ! Kansas City.
"Wednesday I came to Kansas City
Mo. I was afraid of being arrested, but
nobody seemed to know me and I was
glad I had shaved off my mustache. I
was thinking of Christmas and how I
might have to spend It uway front the
wife and children whether I was ar
retted or not. It made ine think the
world was a crasy place. I wondered .f
I was crazy myself.
"I got a market basket and wandered
about among the crowds around the city
market, it was a relief to be among peo
ple after the stuffy cVurt arid Jury room.
Every thought came back to the Jury
and courts. I slept In a livery stable last
night and this morning went to my home
I had read In the papers that the offi
cers had quit watching It,
"I saw one of my children In the barn
yard and gave him a note to take to his
mother, but he was afraid of tne and
ran. I felt weak enough to lie down in
the cold. But I went Into the house, and
when I saw my wife I felt better than I
fver had since they put me on a Jury. I
had 113 of Jury salary which I had held
out from my wife. Intending to buy a
Christmas present for the children. I
still have It. I spent only a few cents on
my wanderings. I couldn't eat."
Questioned closely regarding any com
munication he might have had concern
ing the trial Waldron said after he' read
in the papers of his own escape he asked
a farmer what he thought of "that Hyde
Juror running away."
"He said, 'That fellow was pretty slick.
I'll bet he got awry with his pockets
full,' " Waldron said.
The city market. In the neighborhood
of which Waldron said he wandered with
his market basket, '.s within two blocks
of the court house and one block from
the Centropolls hotel, from which the
Juror escaped.
Joilgt Porterfleid Artlve.
To Judge Porterfleid belongs much
oredlt for the return of Waldron. The
JuJge has worked practically night and
day stneo the Juror dlsawteared in an
effort to locate htm. After Waldron had
returned this morning Judge Porterfleid
revealed some instances of the last two
days that had been known only to him
self and Mrs. Waldron.
"I had always felt," said Judge Porter
field, "that Mrs. Waldron was anxious
to aid us In any way possible. I learned
yesterday that Waldron had been In Kan
sas City, Kan. I felt positive that he
would soon make an effort to return to
his wife. It occurred to me tiiat possibly
he would attempt to communicate with
her through friends in Kansas City,
Kan. Last night In company with Mrs.
Waldron, I went to the home of those
friends and waited until an early hour

ANTI-TRUST JLAW ENFORCED
Attorney General Reviews Year's
Work of Department of Justice.
FOUR MILLIONS COLLECTED

pora I Ions lie Made Ksecntlve
II area a to Hupervlso
I'lrriises.
WASHINGTON. Dee. H.-Pursulng
President Taft's recommendation that an
executive bureau bo created to supervise
corporations' charters under a federal in
corporation act, Attorney General Wick
ersham, in his annual report submitted
to congress today, suggests that the Bu
reau of 'Corporations be raised to thst
dignity, even in the absence of tho pro
posed federul Incorporation statute.
This branch of the Department of Com
merce and Labor, the attorney general
urges, should be brought Into closer re
lation with this department and adds that
it might well be "availed of as the nu
cleus for an administrative board under
whose supervision consolidations or mer
gers for lawful purposes might be
formed."
In enforcing the Sherman anti-trust law
the attorney general points out that tho
Department of Justice and the courts are
confronted by economic, rather than le
gal problems. When It comes to working
out methods of disintegration after a
corporation has been declared an Illegal
combination. The department enlisted
the assistance of the bureau of corpor
ation! In the dissolution of the tobacco
trust, and It would be of great value, to
;iie legal branch of the government, Mr.
Wlckersham says, If the functions of the
bureau should be so enlarged that It
could be called upon officially to make
investigations and report Its conclusions
with respect to plans for the voluntary
or enforced disintegration of monopolis
tic combinations.
The attorney general reviews tho rec
ord of a year of intense activity In fed
eral prosecutions, and points out that the
Department of Justice financially sus
tained Itself as the result of the contri
bution of 14.24.,116 to tho I'nlted States
treasury In tho shape of fines collected,
customs duties recoveries, etc. The ex
pense of the department, Including the
office of the attorney general, all of the
district attorneys and assistants through
out the country, aggregated $3,23,773.
Autl-Trut I'rosecatlous.
In a comprehensive review of the anti
trust prosecutions, the attorney general
shows that the seventeen anti-trust civil
suits pending at the beginning of the last
fiscal year were augmented by six addi
tional uclions, while tho eleven criminal
prosecutions under the same statute were
Increased by twenty-three more protocu
tions during the last fiscal year. ,
Light civil suits and a similar number
of criminal trials were brought to con
clusion during the year. In four of the
civil prosecution Judgments were ren
dered In favor of the United States, while
three were lost and one was discontinued.
Four convictions were secured under the
criminal clause of the statute during the
year and four caws were either quashed
or discontinued.
Declaring that ho appreciates that pub
lic Interest In the Hherman antl-trunt law
was "even greater" than It was at the
date of his last report, the attorney gen
eral sets forth the following cases as
being prosecuted or pending for final
settlement:
The powder trust, the night rider
cases, United Htates Hteel corporation,
cotton corner, alleged towing monopoly,
beef packers, Southern Pacific merger, bi
tuminous coal combination, naval stores
suit; bathtub trust, lumber trust, milk
trust, wallpaper combination, sugar trust,
transatlantic steamship pool, magaslne
trust, shoe machlnury trust, combination

INDIANAPOLIS. Hoc. II.-As a direct
lead into the heart of the alleged dyna
mite conspiracy, District Attorney Chafles
W. Miller, whllo the federal grand Jury
held Its first hearing In the case today,
took up the question of who furnished
tho money fur purchasing and paying the
expense of carrying about the country
the explosives by which more than one
hundred structures were blown up, ,
Mrs. Andrew J. Hull now of Kimball,
Neb., who, as Miss F.dlth Wlnebrenner,
was bookkeeper for the International As
sociation of Iron Workers, and Wtio was
familiar with its money receipts and dis
bursements, was closoly questioned by
Mr. Miller, while Into the grand Jury
room were taken the stubs of check books
and accounts of the association for the
five years during which the explosions
took place.
It was during a large part of these
five years that Ortte K McManlgal, ac
cording to his confession, did dynamiting
for John J. Me. Nanism, the convicted
secretary-treasurer, and often In company
with James B. McNamara.
An Important feature of McManlgai's
confession attracted attention In coniza
tion with Mrs. Hull's visit to district
attorney's office. This was the admis
sion by McManlgal that he usually re
ceived about lawJ.tnr each "Job," and that
when he complained that part ot the
money was being held buck from him,
James B. McNamara had admitted; seeing
the stub for the check and had said John
J. would "fix It up."
Among the other Items mentioned by
McManlgal were 3H0 each for Jobs at

to make the Lorimer hunch pay enough
money to keep me all the rest of my life
and If they don't I'll make It hot for

sion of having been bribed to vote for

Catherine A. Wood, a former telephone
operator at Fast HI. Louis, ill., before
the Loiimer Investigating committee to

land in the penitentiary," said Miss Wood,
"but White said ho had influential people
In Chicago back of him and he was not
afraid."
bhe said White told her ha was a "bud
man" and that he hud killed two men
down son III. Hlie testified that Just be
fore the (io-called expose in the Chicago
Tribune by White, the latter had told her
to "watch the Chicago papers."
Miss Wood's testimony was part of the
plan of the defense to charges that
White's bribery, story was a scheme to
blackmail Henutor Lorimer.
Miss Wood said that on one occasion
when she asked White who were his In
fluential friends In Chicago, he said lie
was being backed by Governor Denuen
and a Mr. Hnlllvaji.
The witness raid she did not know who

Ksstlnga at Auditorium.
With about 2j0 deltgates In attendance. '
the National Wool Growers' association
opened Its forty-eighth annual convention
this morning by getting at once to the
subject uppermost In every sheep man's
mind the tariff.
Fresldont F. R. Gooding ot Idaho de
voted the great part ot an hour's address

Want Honest Revision.
"This convention," said President .
Gooding, "should go on record tor an ,
honest revision of schedule K, both for
the wool growers and the manufacturers
of wool. The honest difference in the
cost of produotton between this country
and foreign countries is all the tariff h
should ask.
"We should make our fight for revision
based on the report of the tariff board.
That report may be a disappointment to
some of our wool growers; it may not
show as large a difference in the coat of
production as some of us believe exists,
but If it comes anywhere near the line of
rsasonab)ensss we shoald accept it and
make a fight for a final settlement ot the
question. The continued agitation of
schedule K has done much to paralyse
the Industry and if we can have anything
like a permanent settlement of the ques
tion we can adjust our business to meet
It, so that In future there will be soma
stability for the products of our industry.
Wants a Settlement.
"Let us not take it for granted that the
report ot the tariff board Is going to
settle the Issue. I am sure those who
have wmtoued the tariff fights lu con
gress must be convinced that what one
political party wants the other objects to.
We should go on record as favoring the
settlement of all business question that
are affected by politics through u com
mission." The American flock master pays the
highest wages, the highest freight rates,
the highest prices for food for his em
ployes and the highest rental to his gov
ernment for range in the world, said Mr.
Gooding, and he must be protected by a
tariff or he can't exist in competition
with other countries. .
Wool can be shipped from England.
Australia or Bouth America to Boston
for bvtween one-third and one-half the
transportation charged on wool from the
Rocky mountain states to Boston, he said.
What Countries I'or,
The American flockniaater pays his men
DO to M a month and board; the Eng
lishman pays 114.75 a month and provides
a house; the Russian pays 10 to 20 cents
a day, not in cash, but in grain and
vegetables; the Argentinian pays IJ2.50 to
$30 a month and provides mutton, six
pounds) of salt, 'tea and six pounds of
rice.
"It costs the American sliteprpan more
to feed his shepherd dog than the Russian
pays his herder," said the speaker.
Wages lu Australia are only 15 or DO
per cent less than in the United States,
he said, but sheep owners there are al
lowed fenced government range at I cents
per head per year ' and, owning to the
fences, one man can care for five times
as many sheep as In the United States.
Mr. Gooding explained that for the wool
ot his SG0 suit the wool grower got only
Sl.Stf, while the manufacturer received
only S7 for the three ond one-half yards
ot cloth contained in the stilt.
Jobber Makes Too Much.
"Somebody is committing robbery,'' he
declared, "and it is not the wool grower
or the manufacturer. The olg mills con
tract for practically their entire output in
advance. The Jobber makes more on a
yard of woolen cloth than the grower,
commission nun and manufacturer com
bined. The people of the country have
been deceived too long as to who 1 get
ting the big share of tbe high price they
