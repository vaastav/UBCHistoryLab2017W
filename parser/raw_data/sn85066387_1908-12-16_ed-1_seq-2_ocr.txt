BODY TAKEN
fROMTHEBAY
Big Crowd Gathers on Wharf
to Await Arrival, of
the Remains
Letter in Pocket Fails to Throw j
Light on Theories as to
Cause of Death
Coroner Prepares for inquest
and Funeral Will Be Held
oihrr spet-ial s^uad of policemen under
cfirjmand of Police Captain Glecson had
been detailed to keep the street cleared.
"When tb<» van arrived the policemen
were drawn up on either side of the
entrance to the courtyard, and as it
passed they uncovered and stood at
attention in silent tribute to the mem
ory of their late commander. The
courlyerd X»te was immediately closed
Vohind the wagor> and the crowd again
driven away. only those having busi
ness to transact being permitted to
enter, the .. coroner's ofSee. .
The examination of the body, con
ducted as soon as it was taken into
the morgue, disclosed the fact that with
the exception of the face and one ankle,
\u25a0which bad been eaten entirely away, it
\u25a0was in a state of excellent preserva
tion despite the 13 days that It had
remained in the water. The head had
been reduced to a bare skeleton, save
for the hair at the back, but the
clothing had protected the body from
tho neck downward. The body was still
clothed in the suit of citizen's cloth-
Ing and the heavy, black overcoat
\u25a0which Biggy wore on the night of his
death. The autopsy was performed at
1 o'clock by Dr. J. R. Clark, who gave
the official cause of death as asphyxia
tion from submersion. Dr. Clark said
that all the organs of the body were
in perfectly normal, sound and healthy
condition at the time of dcatn.
Cutler Attempts Secrecy
Wh<»n the examination of the body
and effects was made immediately after
it was taken to the morgue. Police
Commissioner and Acting Chief of Po
lice Cutlrr. following his usual 'method
of masking with secrecy every case in
which particular public interest centers,
attempted to keep all newspapermen
out of the room while the search was
being conducted. He endeavored to
exclude «vpry one from the room except
Mmself. Captains Kelly and Conboy.
Coronor Iceland and Deputy Coroner
Kennedy. Coroner Leland. however,
would not consent to this. He told Cut
ler that lie did not know how the police
Ao^artment conducted its~business, but
that it was the habit of his office to be
open and above hoard with every case
and to have newspapermen present at
every search such as the one about to
he made; He subsequently gave an or
der to admit one representative from
ea> h newspaper to witness the exam
ination.
Cause Still Unknown
The examination of the body and the
contents of the pockets of the clothing
brought, nothing to light that might
assist in-dofinitcly determining whether
death actually was due to accident or
whether, as was suggested at the time
It was a case of suicide. The watch
taken from the pocket of Biggy's vest
was stopped at M minutes after 9
o'clock, but it probably ran down the
morning after the drowning, as water
would not necessarily affect the works
and the drowning is known not to have
occurred until between 31:15 and 11-30
o'clock at night.
The watch and chain and a gold
lockot were fastened to the vest, and
attached to the double chain was also
a muney case containing $5 in gold.
On the vest was pinned one of Biggy's
chief of police badg-es, while another
was fastened on the inside of his over
coat pocket. In other pockets were
found a pair of glasses in a leather
case, a police whistle, a larke pocket
book, a pocket knife in a chamois case,
a Knights of Columbus badge, several
keys. $3.60 in silver, three silk hand
kerchiefs, a cigar, a muffler and a .32
«aliber revolver containing five cart
ridges In its chambers. The only jew
elry consisted of a stickpin, two plain
so'iii rings and a pair of cuff links.
Letters and Cards Found
The only writing of any kind found
among Biggy's effects consisted of the
personal cards of two local newspaper
men and a personal letter to the de
ceased from Catherine H. Hittell under
•late of November 18. The cards and
letter were " found in the pocketbook
in the Inside pocket of the coat, and
Commissioner Cutler at once endeavored
to take possession of the letter without
allowing it to be seen by others, al
though thero was nothing of a secret
or official nature in its contents. Coro
ner. Iceland again intervened and
ordered copies of the letter to be
struck as soon as it was thoroughly
dried out.
What Epistle Stated
The letter was a denial by Miss Hit
tell.of'certain details of a report pub
lished concerning a speech made by her
before the woman's branch of the
I/eague of Justice relative to grafting
in the police department. The letter
was marked with the .oflieial receiving
stamp of the police department, dated
November 19, and read:

President Scores Pulitzer
WASHINGTON,', Dec. 15— President
Roosevelt sent to the senate a state
ment concerning the -purchase of the
Panama .canal property by. the ;United
States, denouncing in strong language
charges that there was anything wrong
in the acquisition by. the United States
of the canal property... He said: v *
These stories were first brought to
my attention as published In a paper
in Indianapolis called the News, edited
by Mr. Delavan Smith. -The stories
were scurrilous and llbelous in char
acter and false in every, essential' par
ticular. Mr. Smith shelters himself be
hind the excuse that lie merely accepted
tho statements which had appeared in
a paper published -• \h ! New York, y the
World, \u25a0 owned by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer.
It is idle to say that the known char
acter of Mr. Pulitzer and his news
paper Is such that the statements in
that paper will be believed by nobody;
unfortunately, thousands of persons are
ill informed in this, respect and- believe
the statements they see printed, even
though they appear in . a newspaper,
published by Mr. Pulitzer. . j
Charges Declared False •
Summarizing charges made in this
connection/ the president says:
These statements sometimes appeared
in the editorials, sometimes in ' the
news columns, sometimes in the shape
of contributions by individuals either
unknown or known to be of bad char
acter. They are false in every par
ticular from beginning to end. -*•-.
The wickedness. of the- slanders is
only surpassed by their fatuity, bo
utterly baseless are the stories that ap
parently they represent in part merely
material collected for cpmpaign pur
poses and In part stories originally
concocted with a .view- of positive
blackmail. " '\u0084
The inventor of the story 'about Mr.
Charles P. Taft, for instance, evidently
supposed that at some period of the
Panama purchase Mr. W.H. Taft -was
secretary of war, whereas in reality
Mr. W. H. Taft never became secre
tary of war until long after the whole
transaction in question had been closed.
The. inventor of the story about Mr.
Douglas Robinson had not taken; the
trouble to find out the fact that* Mr.
Robinson had not had, the slightest
connection, directly or indirectly, of
any kind or sort with any phase of the
Panama transaction from beginning? to
end. v;
Stories Without" Proof .
The men who attacked Mr.; Root In
the matter had not: taken the-trouble
to read the public documents which
would have informed . them v that- Mr.
Root had nothing to dVwlthth* pur
chase, which was entirely arranged
through- the 'department of.» justice un
der the then attorney general, • Mr.
Knox., ' vV-.'s;' : .•:.-'•.•.. - 1 - v \u25a0 \u25a0•:. \u25a0 \u25a0
, Now,, these stories,; as a matter of
fact, need no investigation whatever.
No shadow of- proof has been or can
be produced in behalf of any of them.
They consist mainly of a string of in
famous libels. In form they^fre partly
libels upon individuals, upon Mr. Taft
and Mr. Robinson for instance, but
they are in fact wholly and in form
partly a libel upon the United States
government.
I do not believe v?c, should concern
ourselves with the particular individ
uals who wrote the lying and libelous
editorials, articles from correspondents
or articles in the news columns. ; \u25a0
Pulitzer Real Offender
.The real offender is Mr.- Joseph Pul
itzer, editor and proprietor of the
World. While the criminal offense of
which Sir. Pulitzer has been guilty Is
in form a. libel upon individuals, the.
great injury done is. in blackening, the
good name of the American people, i
It should not be left to a private
citizen to sue Mr. Pulitzer for libel.
He should be . prosecuted for libel by
the. governmental authorities. "
In point of encouragement of iniquity,
in point* of infamy, of "wrongdoing,
there is' nothing: to -choose between ? a
public servant who: betrays. his ; trust,
a public servant who is guilty of black
mail or theft or financial dishonesty of
any kind," and 1 , a man guilty -as Mr.
Joseph Pulitzer has been guilty in -this
instance. " ' ."\u25a0 \u25a0 '-' •'\u25a0} .-..
It is. therefore, a high national; duty
to bring to justice this vilifier.of- the
American people.- this man who- wan
tonly and wickedly and without , v one
shadow of justification seeks to.-blacken
thecharacter of reputable private citi
zens and to convict the government of
his own country, in the eyes ofthedvl
lized world of- wrongdoing of the basest
and foulest: kind when he has not one
shadow -of justification of any: sort or
description for the charge he has made.
Proceedings Threatehed'*/
The attorney general has. under con
sideration :th« form under which 1 the
proceedings against. Mr. Pulitzer, shall
be brought. ;
The president^ refers various
papers which:, he transmits with; his
message and .calls attention to:numer
ous utterances and acts '\u25a0 relating to tlie
canal . and Its purchase. ; He, cites ; the
act, of. congress 'by, which he was
authorized to "pay : $40,000,000 for .the

beneficiaries of the proceeds of.the salo
was. .purely a nuostion- for the- civil
tribunal of the Seine, the French gov
ernmental body, with which th}s action
had nothing -to .do.: , '' : :".
List. of Stock Holders Given
Under theso : circumstances there was
not the slightest need for Mr. Crom
well to give any information on the
subject of the companies for which he
had been counsel. This government
has.no concern with Mr. Cromwell's re
lation to these companies, or either of
them, or with the amount of his per
sonal-compensation. It was ; not the
affair, of this 'government to Inquire
who were the security holders of the
company,". Nevertheless, Mr. Cromwell,
of his own accord, has submitted to me,
together with a copy of his statement
published on the 11th inst., and which
I transmit herewith, a full list of the
stock, holders of the new Panama canal
company of. France on January 15,
1900 (numbering over 6,000), and a list
of all stock holders who were present
at a special meeting of the company
held 'February 28, 1902, Immediately
after the : cable offer of the company
wag made to the United States (Janu
ary 9-11, 1902) to accept the appraise
ment,of $40,000,000 made by the isth
mian canal commission and to sell for
said sum the Panama canal, concessions
and other property and the shares of
the Panama railroad company. .
Payment to Bond Holders
Referring, to accompanying docu
ments-the president says no payment
will be mado upon the stock of the old
Panama canal company and he is In
formed the payment, on the bonded in-r
debtedncss will be only 10 per cent.
About 6,000 Bharo holders of the. new
Panama, company . will recelvoi-pay
ments, and ' they will recover ' their
original investments, ;wlth annual in
tcrestof- about H per cent. He says: .
The accounts and records of this
liquidatiorj.Vwhich ;- was -concluded in
•June last, .are -on -deposit witlv the
Credit Lyonnaise of Paris as a proper
custodian of the same, appointed upon
such liquidation. ' " ' •
All Details Published
Recently a request was made by a
private individual to inspect the records
of these payments, but answer was
made by the custodians that they saw
no proper reason for granting such
request by a stranger, and inasmuch
as there is not the slightest ground for
suspicion of any bad faith in the trans
action It hardly seems worth while to
make the request; but if the congress
desires, I have-no doubt that on there
quest of our ambassador, in 1 Paris the
list of individuals will be shown htm.
As a matter of fact, there Is nothing
whatever in which this government is
interested to investigate about this
transaction. So far as this government
Is concerned, every. step of the slightest
importance has been made public by its
executive and every step take in France
has.'there been made public by the
proper officials. . ;
Laughter Greets Message ,
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
WASHINGTON. Dec. , 15.— President
Roose\'elt's special message; on thepur
chase Of the Panama canal gotanex
traordinary reception from congress to
day. • In the senate it was not read for
an hour or so after it came in, and then
it was greeted Vith smiles and open
laughter. • \u25a0 . \u25a0 -. \u25a0 ;
.The senators; were immensely amused
by tho violence of.the president's lan
guage in denunciation of the newspapers
which have offended ""him; by -their in
sinuations of impropriety on 4ii» : part
in the canal purchase. Every, assertion
that this or that statement was "false"',
or "false in every ; particular" and every
similar denunciatory : declaration- pro
voked renewed merriment.
.Apparently only one man in the seri
ate chamber took the matter seriously,
and that was Vice President Fairbanks.
The reference. to the Indianapolis News

"In answer. to your query I say that I

reply follows: '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'
"The statement connecting my name
with the so-called Panama canal syn
dicate is absolutely unfounded. Inas
much as I* have not now and never have
had any connection with any, such syn
dic-ate I do not know whether such a
syndicate exists. It was an outrage to
connect my name with what was ob
viously a mere fabrication for cam

Judge Barnes of Chicago Rules
.That Law Respects Woman's
Station
[Special Dispatch to The Call] . ' .
CHICAGO, Dec. 15.— "50 court can
compel_a wife v to. live in a place . en-,
ttlrely- Vut of her station in H£q simply
because she is; the wife of a man and
he is the head of the house." '
, This ruling was made today by Judge
Barnes in tho superior court during the
hearing of, the petition of Mrs. Esther
L. Beehler for separate maintenance
from Dr. Louis' Beehler. ' " ; i.;;
Witnesses' had testified that a fur
nished room in South State street; in
which Beehler wished his wife to live,
was filthy and in an objectionable
neighborhood.
"I don't see why this teatimo'ny
should go in." said Attorney Comerford,
counsel for Dr. Beehler. "The law
compels a woman to follow her hus
band."
"We have advanced a little more in
civilization than that," retorted Judge
Barnes.
