TIIE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Andrew Johnson is true to the in
terests of the Conservative men of th"
country. His second annual message
to Congress, which we lay before our
readers on the first page, proves that
he will take no step backward from the
position which he assumed in his first
annual message. On the other hand,
he goes much further in this message
than in the former, byway of arguing
and explaining his position. And what
could be more candid, dignified, lucid
and convincing, than the argument
which he makes in favor of represen
tation in Congress for the ten excluded
{States? We put it to any fair-minded
man, no matter what may be his po
litieal proclivities, is not the President's
logic sound ? It cannot bo denied that
the style of the message indicates cul
tivated taste, and that iis whole tenor
reflects credit upon its author. Con
trast it with the spiteful and malignant
legislation of Congress, and in what
favorable light it places the President!
Not a line of bitterness toward Con
gress, not the least trace of acrimony
toward those who have traduced and
hunted him down, is to IK* found in its
whole length, but from beginning to
end a firm reliance upon good motives
and a righteous cause as the ultimate
vindication of the President's course,
is the characteristic of this truly admi
rable state paper. Mr. Johnson has
planted himself upon the rock of the
(institution, and he will stand there
n sunshine and in storm. The angry
billows of fanaticism will dash around
him in vain. Secure uuon this eternal
basis of liberty, he will stand untouch
ed until he shall see the storm abate,
and the troubled waters quietly roll
at his feet beneath the sunshine of a
perfect peace.

"Taxation without Representation

the echo, "Taxation without Represen

Shall Thad. Stevens fare better than
Lord North? Shall Rout well be might

Ten States, eight millions of people,
are taxed without their consent. They
are voiceless in the choice of .their ru
lers, in the making of their laws. They
are groaning under the Tyranny of
"Taxation without Representation."
Now, where is the miscreant slave
who will dare to say that this wrong
shall not be redressed ?

Mr. Walter was one of the most thor
ough and active opponents of the Fed
eral government in its efforts to put
down the rebellion, and his paper, The
Timed, became notorious as the organ
of British blockade-runners and Con
federates domiciled abroad. Now he
is feted and lionized by the "loyal"
Chevalier Forney, and the Mongrel
M. C.'s rush forward to tipple cham
pagne and crack jokes with this lately
despised associate and abettor of "'reb
els" and "traitors." Birdsof a feather
will flock together, and fellow Disun
ionists, doubtless, find pleasure in each

COL. JAMES P. BAKU, of the Pitts

Jos. S. Lare, Win. Schoyer and E. A.

P. Burr & Co. The Pout did yeoman!
service in the iate campaign, andweare
glad to note the promise of the pub- j
lishers that its usefulness is to be still j
further extended. The Democracy of !
Western Pennsylvania need a spirited
and enterprising newspaper organ, and
there is plenty of ability in the Post
establishment to make just such a pa- 1
per. We wish the new firm abundant j
success, not only for their own sakes,
but for the sake of the Democrats who
look to it as exponent and leader.
IT is not for want of votes that the
Democracy of the North have so mea
gre representation in Congress. It is
owing to the gerrymandering of the
Congressional districts, by the Mongrel
legislatures. If the people of the
North were represented according to
the vote, there would be about 8(t Dem
ocrats and about 100 Mongrels in the
next Congre s. Any arithmetician;
can cipher this out for himself. For
instance, as 4,100,000 (the whole vote)!
is to 180 (th" whole number of Con-;
gressmen) so is 2,000,000 (the whole
Democratic vote of the North) to the
numberof Congressmen to which the;
Democrats are entitled.
A COKRKSPOXDEXT of the New York
World says that the present Congress!
has no intention of doing anything
definite in regard to the excluded States j
or the President. The members intend
to turn their attention particularly and
solely to stealing, whilst they keep up
their old outcry against the South in
ordertodivertattention from theirown •
rascality. They have played the same
game before, and, of course, intend to
play it again.
HERE is the predicament in which j
the Mongrel leaders in Congress find :
themselves : They cannot retain power ;
with the ten excluded States restored j
to their places in the Union, and they
cannot continue the exclusion of those
States without violating the Constitu
tion and thus incurring the displeasure
of the people. Confined between the
horns of this dihmma, is it any won
der that they rage and roar like so
many bulls of Bashan ?
PROSCRIPTIONS.
When President Johnson removed
some of the brawling disunionists who
used the patronage of the Administra
te create opposition to its policy, the
act was pronounced prescriptive and
tyrannical. No sooner, however, does
Congress meet, than the Senate decapi
tates Messrs. Cowan, Dixon, and Poo
little, taking from each the chairman
ship of the committee held by him
during the former session. Pray, by
what name shall this petty vengeance
be called? If it be not proscription,
what is it ?
RAP them over tin knuckles! Some
of our Democratic exchanges are pub
lishing prospectuses of Abolition peri
odicals andare receiving reproofs there
for from their editorial brethren. We
are glad to see that the Democratic
press is waking up to the importance
of lighting the insidious literature of
New England. Yankeeism is venal
and if you but strike at its pockets, it
i will come down on its marrow bones.
THE llcrahl is the title of a new pa
per just started at Columbia, by Geo,
Young and W, 11. Grier. It is a racy
rod entertaining sheet and soundly
Democratic. Politically, the Ilcratd

doubt not, will make its influence felt
in dispelling the darkness of benight

WASHINGTON*, D. C., >
Dec. 8, 180(5. }'
Mu. EHI TO u'The assembling of
Congress on Monday last, was signali-
zed l>y an immediate attack upon the
Constitutional prerogatives of the Pres
ident, by the Mongrel majority in the
lower Ilou.se. Scarcely had the sound
of the speaker's gavel ceased, as the
House was called to order, when a bill
was introduced, and rushed through
\ under party pressure, repealing that
part of the act of 1862 which authori
zes the President to pardon persons en
! gaged in the rebellion. This course of
! action had been determined upon by
j the Mongrel caucus on Saturday eve
ning previous, and was intended to
frighten the Southern States into the
ratification of the infamous Amend
ment passed at the last session. The
Senate, however, refused, by a close
vote, to take up the bill, though Chan
| dler, of Michigan, tried his best to bul
; ly Senators into following the hasty
I example of the House. The bill was
5 referred to the Committee on the Judi
ciary, where I predict it will slumher
awhile, as the Mongrels fear that in
j the event of of its passage, tHe Presi
dent will, under the power confer, ed
: upon him by the Constitution, issue a
proclamation of general amnesty, which
would hurt them infinitely more than
the special pardons which he has gran t
j ed, or may issue. Thus' does theCon
j stitution protect itself and those who
i stand by it.
i Gen. Rousseau is back again in his
seat. You will remember that he was
censured, last session, for caning that
reverend slanderer, Grinnell, of lowa,
and that he resigned in consequence,
i lis constituents returned him by an
overwhelming vote, which means, if
Grinnell lies again, Rousseau is to give
him another ratan-ing. 1 notice, also,
the presence of theshameless Raymond,
whose Janus-face looks in two differ
ent directions at the same time. lie is
the fe.low who read the platform of
the Philadelphia National Union Con
vention held in August last. You re
meinber that he said in that address
that if the Southerners accepted thede
grading conditions which were sought
to be imposed upon them by the Rad
icals, they would be unworthy citizens
of a free country. Such was the sub
stance of the remarks, if not the exact
language, used by this delectable Con
servative. Well, 110 sooner had .Maine
and Vermont voted, than Raymond
turned tail upon the National Union
Convention, and made a straight eoat
tail for the camp of the .Mongrel Rad
ical.-. lUs paper, the N. Y. Tinws, came
out in favor of the Amendment and
threatened the Southern people that if
they didn't accept the "degrading con
ditions" offered them in that Amend
ment, they would fare worse. He al
so did his best to defeat .Mr. Ciymer in
your State, and Mayor Hoffman, in
New York. Notwithstanding his ser
vices to the Mongrels he was kicked
oct of the "Republican National Com
mittee," anil tabooed generally by the
leaders of the party to which he pro
fessed to belong. The other night he
ventured to poke his nose into tiie Mon
grel Caucus, when old Stevens discov
ered his presence, and the Mongrels be
gan at once to consider among them-
selves the propriety of invjting him to
leave. A resolution to tluvt effect was
offered, which received some 2"> votes,
hut was 10.-W Down sat Raymond, as
big a dogas any in the kennel and as
ready to growl sit the Southern people
because they will not accept "degrading
conditions" as the men with whom he
affeets to disagree. What an infernal
hound he is!
Tlie 1 'resident's message has just been
I announced, and OldThad. doesn't care
about hearing it. He has moved to
postpone its reading, hut the House
feels disposed to listen to it. It is re
ceived with attention and I can see a
bitter smile on the countenance of that
old knave Bout well, of Massachusetts.
He is one of the miserable tricksters
Avho in the Peace Convention of 1801
1 refused to listen to any compromise,
and who would have nothing but war.
lie said then, to some of the Southern
representatives in that Convention,
"We will either march our armies to
the Gulf of Mexico, or you will march
yours to Canada." This pestilent fel
low means more war, more blood, and
what is the all in all to him and his
section, more plunder. The firmness
of the President makes him writhe in
his seat, and the dignified, yet pointed
manner in which the message puts the
position of the Executive upon the
question of Southern representation,
makes him very uneasy. lie has had
it in his mind to draw up articles of
impeachment against the President.
But he is a coward and fears to meet
a man of such mettle as is exhibited in
the document which is just being read.
The temper of the message has given
great satisfaction to moderate men of
all parties. Even "Republicans" de
clare that if Congress renews the quar
rel with the President, 011 any thing
uttered in this message, they will go
with him and against Stevens and his
faction. It is seen and felt here, that
the firmness and dignity of the mes
sage have strengthened the Conserva
tiveeause greatly. Thanks to Andrew
Johnson ! lie will yet he sustained,as
he would be to-day, could every Amer
ican have a voice in the government.
There will, beyond all doubt, be an
effort made by the ultra men in Con
gress, to destroy the power of the Pre
sident. They want to insure the suc
cess of their party in the next Presi
dential election, and they are willing
and ready to do anything to secure that
end. They are already beginning to
talk about legislating so as to exclude
the ten Southern States not represent
ed in Congress, from the Electoral Col
lege. Well, let them undertake that,
and they'll have somebody else than
"grey-backs" to whip! As to impeach
ment, they would like to try it, but
they are afraid lest the sympathies of
the people might run in the wrong di
rection. Their plan will evidently be
to get up some kind of a smelling com
mittee, which will take one side of ail
the evidence that perjurers like Ilolt's
man Conover, and cattle of that de
scription (ran be procured to give
against the President, and then print a
report at the expense of the people,
and scatter it broadcast as an election
eering document. Now, mark my
word, if this isn't all their impeach
ment business will afnount to. But
smelling committees are about played
out. People will not be humbugged
by one side of a story when they can't
get to see the other side. I don't be
liey; that they will get much of their
ultra work through the Senate. That
body appears to be a little squeamish
and doesn't swallow the dose prepared
in the House without some signs of dis
gust. 1 look for moderation in the
Senate, but there is 110 telling to what
extent the majority of that body may
be driven by tiie party lash.
I miss greatly the pleasant counte
nance of your former representative,
Hon. A. 11. Coffroth. I hear that
"Aleck" is Assessor of Internal Rev
enue for his old district. I hope he
will not forget the fact that he needs
to be confirmed before he is safe in his
new office. I mention this only in the
hope that, if he sees it, he may be re
minded that he ought to be here to look
after his interests. The fact is, Aleck,
your friends here want to see you.
Should anything remarkable trans
pire here between this and next Satur
day, I will telegraph you. PRY.

DEAR EDITOR:—U. T. never was in
such trouble as now threatens him on
every side, lie is blamed, 011 the one
hand, for writing those petty slander
ous "Pilgrim" letters to the Inquirer,
and on the other he is charged with
trying to curry favor with those whom
he formerly denounced as "drunkards,"
"gamblers," &c. Now, isn't this too
bad? Uncle Toby to be considered a
poor miserable defamer of those who
have been his warm and consistent
friends, Uncle Toby to be pronunced
so mean as to drag his private griev
ances into the public prints, as "Pil
grim" has done in regard to the school
teacher business! Does anyone who
knows the undersigned, believe, for a
moment, that if he had a son who was
refused the charge of a country school,
that he would fly into the newspapers
and blazon that son's ill luck to the
world? Not a bit of it. U. T. is no
such fool as that. He would expect
people to corne to the natural conclu
sion that his son was considered unfit
to leach, and for the son's sake he would
keep as quiet about it as possible. A
gain, would U. T. abuse a gallant and
honorable soldier, simply because he
didn't happen to vote the ticket sup
ported by U. T. ? Or, would your old
friend, riding in his ear of progress,
step out of his pleasant carriage, to get
into the company of the "drunkards"
and "gamblers" whom he was wont so
fiercely to denounce ? No, 110 ! These
things are not at all consistent with the
character of Uncle Toby. It will not
be taken as vanity in me, if 1 say that
Uncle Toby's profession is to speak
"peace, good will toward men," that
ho is a minister of the meek and low ly
Nazarene who counseled us that when
smitten on one cheek, wo should
turn the other also to him that smote,
and that he is a teacher of that sacred
Word which tells us, "Blessed are the
peacemaker.-, for they shall see God."
How, then, could Uncle Toby be the
author of the embittered seribblingsof
"Pilgrim?" llow could he draggle
his sacerdotal robes in the muck of
slander, and stain his preacher's vest
ment with the "gall of bitterness?"
llow could he, by miserable, sneaking
innuendo, assail private citizens who
have been his friends, or sit in a village
post office or country store, eaves-drop
per-like, to catch the private conversa
tion of his neighbors so that ho may
report it for publication in the news- I
papers? A vaunt! would you insult;
me beyond endurance, then charge me |
with so vile an act as any of these!;
Then, that I, Uncle Toby, should be
blamed with dabbling in politics, I j
who have always opposed interference ;
in political matters by ministers of the j
Gospel! Now, isn't such misrepresen- j
fation of my position too outrageously j
bad? If any body despises a political !
preacher, it is myself. He is the nas
tiest, foulest-mouthed, most hypocrit
ical, corrupt and generally villainous
compound of earth and spirit that God
permits toexist. Yet those who charge
me with theauthorshipof "Pilgrim's"
letters, by that very charge, make me
out such a dog as this. "Can such things
be and overcome us like a summer's
cloud, without our special wonder?"
But, time will set all things even, and
I am content to wait for my vindica
tion. Meanwhile let all beware how
they talk of that miserable excrescence
of scribble-dom, "Pilgrim," as being
the same person as
UNCLE TOBY.
COXdKESS.
SENATE.— The petitions of Gen. Jeff.
C. Davis, and of other officers of the ar
my, asking for an increase of pay, were
presented and referred to the Commit
tee on Military Affairs. The bill taking
away the pardoning power from tiie
President was reported from the Com
mittee on the Judiciary for immediate
consideration, but, objection being made
it went over. The .Secretary of War was
requested to inform the Senate wheth
er Commissioners had been appointed
to award payments to loyal slaveown
ers for slaves drafted or enlisted in the
army, and, if so, whether any report
has been made by such Commissioners.
A bill was also introduced suspending
all payments as compensation to own
ers of slaves drafted or enlisted in the
army until the final report of tne Com
missioners has been made and approv
ed by Congress. It was referred to the
Committee on Finance. Joint resolu
tions of the Vermont Legislature in fa
vor of negro suffrage throughout the
United .States and the District of Colum
bia were presented and laid on the ta
ble. Notice was given that on Monday
next the bill to establish an uniform
system of bankruptcy for the United
States will he taken up, and also that
the resolution disbanding militia organ
izations in the Southern States and pro
hibiting their re-organization, will be

HOUSE. —TheCommitteeon Postoffi
ces and Post Roads was instructed to
inquire into the propriety of conferring
upon the Postoffice Department the sole
jurisdiction over telegraph lines now in
operation, or to be constructed, as it
now exercises over postoffices and roads.
A resolution was passed calling on the
Postmaster General for the names of all
postmasters removed since the last ses
sion of Congress, the cause of removal,
names of the new appointees, and as to
the increase of salaries. Mr Williams'
hill regulating appointments and re
movals from office was taken up, and
an amendment was offered allowing the
heads of Departments to appoint all
their assistants and subordinates, sub
ject to the consent of the Senate. The
further consideration of the bill was
then postponed until Monday next. The
President was requested to inform the
i louse whether any portion of Mexican
territory has been occupied by United
States troops, and ifso, for what purpose
and by whose authority. A resolution
was passed appointing a committee of
three to proceed at once to New Orleans
and institute a thorough inquiry into
the cause of the riots in that city dur
ing last July. The Committee on the
Judiciary was instructed to inquire as
to what legislation is necessary to pre
vent the counting of electoral votes
from States not entitled to representa
tion. A resolution was adopted in
structing the Committee on the Judici
ary to provide by law for the exclusion
of all persons who served in any capaci
ty under the Confederate Government
from exercising the right of suffrage in
the District of Columbia. The resolu
tions introduced by Mr. Myers, of Penn
sylvania, on Tuesday, calling on the
President for information in regard to
appointments made during the recess
were taken up and passed. Mr.
Schenck's bill changing the time of the
meeting of Congress to the 4th day of
March for the first session and to the
second Monday in November for the
second session* was taken up,andalong
debate ensued, during which a number
of amendments were proposed. Pend
ing the consideration of the bill and
amendments the House adjourned un
til Monday next.
STAKTMXi IXSCI.OSI RES.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.— The report
of the investigating committee dis
closes startling frauds upon the Gov
ernment. Parties in high position in
the South during the war are seriously
implicated. The frauds amount to
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dol
lars.
No wonder the "loyal" scoundrels,
were opposed to the cessation of hostil
ities and denounced as "copperheads"
all who favored that object. Whilst
contractors, and sutlers, and commis
saries, and provost marshals, Ac., were
swindling the people, they were brim
full of patriotism, and were always rea
dy to mob, and imprison, and talk
loudly about preserving "the best gov
ernment the world ever sawyet, at
the.same time, they were stealing them
selves rich. The truth is the people
will never know how much these Rad
ical robbers have stolen until the Dem
ocratic party gets into power and is en
abled to unearth the rascality and cor
ruption that is now covered up. Even
now these self same paragons of New
England honesty and "ove of country
are set in uncompromising hostility to
a reconstruction of the Union, for the
reason that-the rascally "rebels" would
thereby be invested with rights and
privileges of which they are undeserv
ing! On'y think of it, hundreds of
mil/ions of dollars stolen by those who
held high official positions during the
war ! But, a Radical Congress will, no
doubt, wink at thesestupendous frauds,
and swear that it is a story concocted
by "rebels and rebel sympathizers,"
and most probably their poor (luluded
fanatical followers will believe them,
and "stick to the part;/."—Crawford

ALLCOCK'S POROUS PLASTERS.—
BF.ST STRENGTHENING PLASTER IN THE WORLD.
ALLCOCK'S POROUS PLASTERS re
solve and assuage pain by calling forth the acrid
humors from parts internal to the skin and gen
eral circulation—thus, in many cases, positively
evaporating the disease.
JAMES LULL, M. D.
There is nothing equal, in the way of a plaster,
to the Porous Plaster of Mr. ALLOOCK. Every
thing is pleasant about them. They are the plas
ter of the day, and a fit typo of our present ad
vancement in science and art. In Asthma. Cough,
Kidney Affections, Gout, Rheumatism, and local
deep-seated pains, they afford permanent relief.
J. F. JOHNSON, M D., on "Topic tl Remedies.' 1
From a personal knowledge of these plasters, we
can state that they arc decidedly preferable to any
other in use. Wherever relief is to be obtained
by the use of a plaster, we should recommend
them. A. INGRAHAM. M.D . Ed. N. Y. Mentor.
