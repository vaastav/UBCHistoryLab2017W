President's Mesiyge.
The IbllowinK njrnopxia is from the Haiti
more Sun, of Wednesday :
President Grant, in his seventh annual
; message, sent to Congress Tuesday, indulges
in some pleasant mention of the advancement
of our country from its infancy to its centen
nial. and o( the nation’s great success in
! progress and civilization; of its wonderful
i achievements in arts, science and all the con
comitants of advanced betterment of all the
1 people. And in this connection he urges that I
all citizens should be educated sufficiently to I
cast a vote with right intelligence of the value j
of the elective franchise, which is a proposi
tion no reasonable person will question,
though it was nut acted upon in tho recon
struction policy of the President’s own party, j
The absence of such educated intelligence is, j
the President thinks, the primal danger to [
our country’s prosperity and the permanence '
ol its free institutions, and in such belief he |
recommends an amendment to the consutu- !
won requiring the several States to establish
and forever maintain free public schools
adequate to, at least, the radimentary educa
tion of ull the children, irrespective of color,
sex, nationality or religion ; forbidding, how
ever, the teaching in such schools the incul
cation of pagan or atheistic tenets, or the 1
bestowal of school funds to any religious \
denomination for educational purposes. He I
also objects to the accumulation of vast
amounts of untuxed church property, and j
says that that class of property in the Uoiled
Slates in 1H75 amounts to $1,000,000,000.
He recommends the taxation of all such
property, exempting only cemeteries and
limited edifices tor churches.
These subjects have always in this country
heretofore been regarded as belonging pecu
liarly to the Stale and local governments, and
at no time have they received more general
and willing attention in the Stales than at
present.
Staling that our relations with foreign
powers are satisfactory and friendly, the PrtFs
ident takes occasion to remark that Congress
should so legislate as to prohibit citizens of
the United States from owning slaves in any
other country, and he ho|es such consum
mation may ultimately embrace citizens of
all nations.
Chili has made reparation in some long
standing cases of outrage on our comuiercial
marine. Mention is made of the Hawaiian
reciprocity treaty, and of the Virginias indem
nity, which has been settled by Spain.
In regard to Cuba, the President thinks
there is no evidence of a near termination of
the conflict there, and that there still exists
! that continuous disregard of laws of civilized
warfare and humanity which has characterized
the internecine strife during the past seven
years. He adverts to the commercial impor
tance of Cuba to the world at large, and
asserts his belief, that tho nations have u
right to interfere sufficiently to establish its
government on a secure basis, but he consid
ers the recognition of Cuban independence
impracticable at present, and he believes the
United States and all other nations must soon
consider the necessity of mediation and inter
vention in the premises. A considerable
portion of tho message is devoted to this sub
ject.
He indorses the recommendations made in
the annual report of the Secretary of War,
including a system of annuities fur families of
deceased officers by funding a monthly deduc
tion from the pay of those officers while in
service ; a return to the old system of mile- !
age; an approval of torpedo experiments, and 1
a permanent organization of the signal service }
corps.
'1 he condition of the navy is stated as being •
satisfactory, it does not contain much iron- |
cruising power, but it has a considerable i
number of iron clads of the monitor class,
which, though not cruisers, are of excellent
effect for operations on our coast and for safe
defense of our harbors. The navy includes
more than filly warships, fifteen of them being
iron ilud.
In referring to Postoffice Department affairs, (
the President recommends the exclusion from ;
the mails of merchandise of all kinds, and the
limitation of transportable mutter therein only
to those articles which should he properly
classed as mailable.
The President says that although govern- ;
ment efforts to protect the rights of Indians in I
the Black Hills have been the next |
year will exhibit a large increase of immigra- (
lion thither. The condition of the Indian I
Territory is practically unchanged, but the
President may hereafter make some sugges
tions as to legislation for the government of
that Territory.
The grasshopper plague is supposed to have
diminished the sale of public lauds during the
year, there being a decrease in the sales of
2,45U,d01 acres as compared with those of the
previous year. The surveyed urea of public
domain is 080,253,01)4 acres, leaving 1,154,-
471,702 acres yet to be surveyed. The man
agement and disposition of this vast farm of
“Uncle Sam” are recommended to the care
ful consideration of Congress.
As to pensioners, the message states that
during the past year 11,557 names have been
added to the payrolls and 12,077 dropped,
showing a decrease of 1,420. Hut notwith
standing this decrease of pensioners, there |
has been an increase in pay to the amount ofi
$44,733.13, which was induced by the greatly
increased average rate of pensions allowed by
the lost Congress. During the last fiscal year
there was paid for account of pensions |20,-
083,110. There are on the rolls 234,821
persons, of whom 210,803 arc army pension
ers, (of these 105,478 being invalids,) and
104,885 are widows and dependent relatives.
The navy pensioners are 0,420, including 1,-
030 invalids and 1,784 widows and dependent
relatives. Of the war of 1812 there are 21,-
088 pensioners, 15,875 being survivors and 5,-
143 widows. The amount required for pay
incut of pensions fur the next fiscal year is j i
estimated at $20,535,000.
The President thinks his Indian policy has
been prosecuted with encouraging and satis- |
factory results as to the improvement of tho j
race, and he says the same policy will be con- , ,
tinued with such modifications as may be !
deemed proper.
As to the centennial exhibition the Presi
dent thinks that as it is to he an international
affair, to which the United States government
is only a voluntary contributor, its contribu
tion should bo large enough to sustain the
dignity ot the United States in such a contin
gency. Ho says that almost without excep
tion the powers of Kurope, the South Ameri
can Stales, and even the far-off Eastern
sovereignties have taken steps to be repre
sented in the centennial exhibition.
The President recommends the formation
of 'a special tribunal for hearing and deter
mining all claims of aliens against the gov
ernment of the United States which now exist
or may hereafter arise outside of treaty stipu
lations.
The question as to tnonopolyand exorbitant
charges on the Atlantic telegraphic cable lines
is given to the earnest consideration of Con
gress, and in absence of action by that body
the President will not approve the landing of
cables proposed to be laid by competing com
panies.
Tho frauds in naturalization and expatria
tion are severely commented on, and preven
tive legislation asked. It is also suggested I
(hot there is necessity of enactment in relation
to the status of American women who may j
marry foreigners, and of defining the condition \
of children of American parents born in
foreign countries, so as to give legal effect to
marriages of American citizens effected in
foreign countries.
As to resumption of specie payments the
President will neartily approve any practica
ble measures to that end that may be adopted
by Congress* He thinks unlimited inflation
1 would bring about specie payments more
quickly than a law looking to redemption of
legal-tenders in coin, hut this would he at
the expense of national honor. He recom
mends a repeal of so much of the legal-tender
act as makes such notes receivable for debts
contracted after January, 1877.
The Mexican robberies and cattle-liftings
in the Free Zone, adjoining Texas, are alluded
to, with the admission that the military force
of our government available for service at
that point is inadequate to guard the line even
at tho places where raiding incursions arc
most frequent.
The bureau of agriculture has disseminated
much uselul knowledge to agriculturists, and
has introduced new and probably useful pro
ductions to our soil, and the President thinks
the bureau worthy of continued encourage
ment by the government.
Thu Mormons are visited with a short but
positive rod. The President thinks Mortnon
tsm should be banished from the land of Utah
by punishing it as a crime. He thinks simi
larly in regard to the importation of Chinese
women for infamous urposcs.
It is recommended in view of the President’s
own observations in visits to the Territories,
that existing laws in relation to the disposition
of public lands and the mining interests be
carefully amended, so as to protect and assist
the enterprising pioneers who are to do so
much for the development of the Western
wilds. He suggests that joint committees of
Congress be sent to examine into these sub
jects.
In conclusion the President refers to this
as the last annual message be wilt transmit
to Congress before his successor is cho.en,
and sums up into five propositions his views
on requiring the Stale to give common school
education, making it compulsory and without
sectarianism; for keeping Church and State
separate; for driving out licensed immorality,
and enacting laws for a speedy return to a
sound currency.
The Press on the Message.
In commenting upon the Presidents
message, tho press generally takes especial
note of his novel proposition in regard to
i a constitutional amendment for interfering
with and controlling the States in their
educational systems, and in reference to
the church property taxation question,
which is also wholly of local concern.
From the Mew Fork Herald, Ind.
I The message touches upon a great va
i riely of important subjects, and on the
| greater part of them wu are bound to say
that it delivers sound, or, at least, defen
I siblo views. But there is one capital ex
’ ception; one subject on which tho rocom
| inundations of the President are sheer
folly. It unfortunately happens that the
i subject oi which the President is utterly
j wrong is the one which he presses with
the most vigor and zeal. On the eombin !
ed religious and school question, upon I
which ho lays his chief stress and einpha 1
sis, he is wild, quixotic and utterly absurd. 1
This attempt to introduce religion as a I
i controlling element in our national politics. I
i the zeal witli which he flings this firebrand j
| and trios to kindle theological animosities I
; for party effect, is tho most mischievous
and monstrous violation of fitness and pro- |
priety ever perpetrated by a President of j
tho United States.
The inflammatory question which he |
thus thrusts into the political arena is en i
tirely outside of his constitutional daties,
as he virtually confesses by urging his re
commendations as amendments of the con- |
stitution. This is a plain acknowledgment j
i that he is overstepping tho limits of the I
i constitution as it stands at present. It is
a well established principle that the Pres
ident has no official connection with amend
ments to tho constitution. The President
ought to act within the constitution, but
not beyond it. When Congress by a two
thirds majority of each House proposes
amendments to the constitution their ac
tion does not require the approval of the
President,.as was judicially decided by the
Supremo Court at an early period in our
history. Amendments ot the constitution
are entirely beyond the sphere of execu
tive action. It is not denied that the
President can recommend changes in the i
constitution if ho chooses, but he ought
not to do it except on some urgent and I
manifest necessity. But what is the ur- j
gcncy for such amendments as President
Grant presses with all the fervency of
bigoted zeal in this message ? Thero is
none whatever, it is a bold and bald at
temp to influence religious animosities for
party purposes, than which nothing could
be more inexcusably mischievous, if the
President thinks that Congress will respect!
and indorse his views.
From the New York Tribune, Ind.
The message is chiefly of interest as in- I
dicating the policy of the party and the
1 purposes of the President in the campaign
lof 1878. What are they ?
Tho principal points are our Cuban re
lations, out of which it is surmised we may
be drawn into a war which will in many
ways strengthen the administration parly
and the President; and the school ques- !
j tion, which, rigidly defined, is an anti
( Catholic issue, from which the administra
tion party hopes great things, and the head
! of the administration, unless all signs fail,
much greater. These are new Issues both,
j and both factitious.
With regard to the school question—
and this is after all the feature of the mes-
I sage. It opens and closet with it. It
anticipates ex-Spcakcr Blaine s proposed
I constitutional amendment, and dwells upon
the need of amendments to tho constitu
tion providing that tho States shall bo re
quired to afford a common school educa
tion to every child within their limits, and
that church and State shall bo declared
forever separate and distinct. Nothing
has occurred, except us mischievous and
self-seeking demagogues have raised tho
questions for their own purposes, within
the last year to bring such issues promi
nently into politics. President Grant, we
may be assured, docs uot bring them up j
now before an opposition Congress with j
any honest purpose of having them settled. I
It is not uncharitable or unfair to say,
I under all the circumstances, that ho must
have broached these new issues with the
plain and unmistakable purpose of making
political capital. There is nothing in this
document that would remind any one of
the grave and serious questions that have
been treated so solemnly in his previous
messages —nothing but the currency ques
tion. and that is touched, not dwelt upon.
The heaviest portions of the message re
late to new questions, to questions which
have not heretofore been considered, and
which there is now no reason for consid
ering as urgent. It is politics—uot states
. mauship.
From the Sew York Sun, Ind.
Grant takes up educational and ecolc
i siastloal questions, and gives an enlarged
i edition of his Des Moines speech of Octo
ber last against the Catholics and the poor
old Pope. This is u congenial topic to
him, and affords proof that this thorny
subject will be incorporated into the next
national republican platform, and play a
part in the coming Presidential campaign.
Tho message will disappoint public ex
pectation on the Cuban question. The
President handles it elaborately, but leaves
it exactly where he found it. Ho inti
mates, however, that this is not the last
which Congress may hear from him about
Cuba. Grant is sound on the currency
question.
To replenish the vaults of the treasury,
which stand very much in need of more
money, Grant recommends, among other
things, a resuscitation of the old impost
on tea and coffee. Under tho pressure of I
stern necessity this may possibly be done, \
but the measure will meet with very stren
uous resistance.
IVom the Philadelphia Timex, Ind.
The school and sectarian issues are evi
dently the political bees that buzz in the
presidential bonnet, aud ho strikes out
wildly in his ill-considered assault upon
imaginary foes of free institutions. In
some of his suggestions ho is evidently
forgetful of the inevitable logic of his owu
recommendations. Leaving out of con
sideration the impolicy of attempting an
amendment of the national constitution
regulating the educational systems of the
several States, his arguments are brought
into strange conflict with each other. He
delivers what he regards as u master polit
ical broadside to confuse sectarianism and
inspire and crystulizc the Protestant con
victions of tho country and lead them into
the swamps and brambles of polities; but
while ho beckons the Protestant sectarian
to his side to make war upon the Catholic
sectarian, the amendment ho proposes to
the national constitution would exclude
the Bible from every school in the land.
Whether he was unfortunate in tho choice
of his languge, or whether he though little
and cared lens what logical results his op- {
peals to sectarian prejudice might lead to
so they brightened the dream of ambition,
is not material. Like all who play on the
harp of the demagogue, he finds tuneless
strings and jarring notes however skillful
tho touch, and in bidding too desperately
to out-Blaine Citrine, on the sectarian issue,
he has unbalanced himself and will fall
between the upper and nether millstone of
tho arrayed sectarianism he seeks to tn
-1 flame for a national conflict. Considering
that Church and State are “forever sepa
rate and distinct” in every State, either
by positive organio law or by the supremo
law of the settled purpose of the people, a
discussion of the issue as one of national
moment by the President, in an annual
message, borders on imbecility and will be
charged to the third term night mare that
; settles so awkwardly in his concluding
paragraphs.
From the New York World , Dtm.
The purpose of the President to raise \
the so-called “achool-issue’’ for securing .
I lib own third term, which was apparent |
in his Den Moines speech, is more clearly
; manifest in the present message. That
• part of it which proposes the taxation of
► church property is meant to reinforce the I
part which proposes a sectarian strife to 1
reconstruct the common school system in j
the interests of a political party caught i
aud collared and brought to judgment be- j
lore the whole people for its blunders, its
usurpations and its plundering of the peo
ple’s substance. It will be found that
“issues” no more than governments can bo
made. They grow, and neither the soil
, nor the atmosphere of this republic just
now promises him the crop lie would sel
fishly harvest. Gen. Grant orders up the
school issue as if it were a brigade. Tim
I brigade would obey. But the issue docs
j not exist in the condition, the necessities,
j the desires, ortho hatreds of the American
J people. Their first and great necessities
■ now arc honest miMi in office and an end
j of the thieves; reform and economy in tho
I public service and an end of a 5d00.000,-
000 budget; freedom from federal usurpa
tions, and homo rule in every State; a
• revenue tariff and an end of protected mo-
I nopolies; hard money and an end of India
| rubber currency and inflation. These arc
issues which Gen. Grant, if he were a
| competent statesman, might have forced
[ upon tho people. As it is they have been
I forced upon him and his party.
| From the Philadelphia Ledger, hid.
The message is written with General
| Grant’s peculiar force and ability. There |
arc people of all parties who will differ
| widely from the President about the sclkk>l
! and church property part of his
i Some of them will wonder how the dis
eussion of its gets into that document, as
it belongs directly to the municipal and 1
State governments; and others of them
will hold to the opinion that some ceme- I
teries are just tho kind of property that j
ought to be taxed, whilst others should i
not, and that if church property is to be 1
taxed at all, it should be the hind, and not j
the edifice. These are matters which have j
exercised tho minds and ingenuity of the !
taxing powers of State and municipal an- S
thoritics, and there is a good deal more
to bo said on both sides than what is j
touched upon in the message.
From the New York Journal of Commerce, r.
The obvious inference from the Pres- i
ident's language is that our relations with }
Spain have reached a crisis, as has been
several limes intimated from Europe and 1
as often scmi-officially denied from Wash
ington. However, if nothing come of it .
after all, the result will be not altogether l
out of accord with the precedents.

Office of J. Aniusov .Smith,* )
Cl S. Gay St., Balt., July 14, 18To. ,
Meaty a. Christopher Jc Co . Gentlemen :
ilh much pleasure I take this opportunity {
of staling that in a long experience in the
inspection of Illuminating Oils, in my official
capacity as Inspector, lam enabled to pro 1
nounce your “Alta Safety” brand of Oil, the
very best 1 have ever tested or used. In nu
mcrous inspections made for mvself and
friends I have invariably found the “Alta
Safety” to stand a higher Fire test than that
you claimed for it (namely 150°,) and have
also found it in uniform purity and general
good qualities, superior to any other oil 1 have
seen, and as such, recommended it to my
, friends and the public generally, as the most
reliable oil for family use now in the market.
As Hcfiners, I congratulate you upon your
signal success in manufacturing an oil posses
sing the very best qualities. Safety, Purity,
and the production of a most brilliant liglit.
In using the“ Alta Safety” Oil in my household
I have found it to give a light for reading or
writing superior to gas and believe with ordi
nary care, that an accident with this oil is
impossible. W ishing you continued success
with the Alta Safety, which you so justly
merit, 1 am
Very respectfully.
