New York, Dec. U. Tho President's

Although the President's, message to
Congress touched on must of the topics
which nr" now agitating the minds
of the financial coniniunltj nnd the
(nuntr.v nt large, it did not lefer, ex
cept to postpone, two subjects whiih.
more than most others, concern Wall
street the railroad and treatv legisla
tion. T'i omission was u distinct dis
appointment ThiougU the forenoon trading marked
time as prices advanced slowlv but
steudilj some one to three points or
more on o general level, and much mote
than that among issues which are cata
logued ns lughh speculative character.
At noon ns the message began coming
over the wires business was largelv
suspended while the process of digesting
its contents was going on Aftei thnt
pi Ices disnli'ved a ti miotic v to case, but
tluoughout. the session it was noticeable
that offerings of long stock were light
The iniliond list was more backward
in getting a start, hut thev , too, made
an excellent displaj of stiength on the
hope that the President would have
something constructive to sav about
nnpendiug return and recommendations
for legislition Whin this hope was
not lcilied thev bean to sag and
'ost a good part of tluir gains iu u
diort time
The executive's exposition of the
labor situntion, nssoeiatrd with the
assembling of the sei ond industrial
confeicnce todav in Washington, was
of wide interest, but peihups the most
interesting item in the message was
the President's representation of the
wiessitj for an immediate simplifica
tion of the income and excess -profits
tuxes
This is a subject ery close to the
stieet and of the most far-reaching in
fluence in the nation's industilul and
iconomie life, bearing ns it does so dt
reitly on domestic and foreign fin
ancing piojects.
Aside from the presidential commu
nication to Congress, the day's news
levelopments weie numeious and im

GENERAL IMPROVEMENT OF
PRICES FOR LOCAL STOCKS
Electric Storage Battery Led With a Gain of $4 Increase
Noted in the Odd-Lot Buying '
I-.lectrc Storage Battery was tho
outstanding feature of Btrength nnd in
terest ot today's local market. Accom
panying tho further ndvnnce of SI in
tho stock of 142V4, which represented
n lecovcry of S10 from tho low prlco
made in last week's sweeping reaction
ary movement", thcro were persistent ru
mors of a further Increase in the divi
dend rate. Tho story freely circulated
on the street was that in addition to tho
legulnr quarterly rate of 2 per cent,
the directors nt their meeting tomorrow
would also declare nn extra dividend of
2 per cent. There was, of course, 110
means of confirmation, but it is under
stood such a distribution could be cosily
made from the largely increasing earn
ings. While tho movement was, independent
of the general list it nevertheless had n
strengthening influence, Price changes
elsewhere ns a rulo were slight, but
generally represented smnll gains.
Trading, although in small volume,
was much better, distributed, with a no
ticeable incrense of odd lot transac
tions, indicating the so-called bargain
hunters were being nttracted by the
low level of stock values, Such pur
chases were ugaln conspicuous in
I lilted Ons Improvement, which after
opening it 53 wns elevated to 53.
ph Indclphla Electric was well taken

and American Stores nt 41. ,
Lake Superior Corporation appar

made in Insurance Company of America

"Vv. Northern Central changed bands
at 0V6. the same prlco ns the previous
sale. General Asphalt common in the
second hour advanced SO to 100. The
preferred, on the other hand, on a Bale
of ten rfinres, dropped S10 to 175.
Tho news of the death, of Henry O.
Frick was received with regret in local
financial cliclcs. Mr. Frick was iden
tified with a number of what may be
called Philadelphia enterprises. .He
was supposed to have been onn of'tbc
largest shareholders of the Reading Co".,
and some venrs nen wan nlnn t-nnwn to
have largo holdings of Pennsylvania"3
itaurouu, Dut is understood to nave
disposed of the greater part of this
stock. He was a frequent visitor In
many of the local banking institutions.
His death, it is believed, will have no
effect upon the market. The affairs
of prominent men in later years have
been so arranged as to cause little dis
turbance in the security markets in
event of their death.

Commission House Buying
Sends Prices to New High
on Present Bulge
Chicago, Dec. 2. New high prices on
tlu present bulge were made in the corn
matket today on continued buying by
commission houses.
Mcagerness of offerings was the out
standing fe.tttirc. Covering by shorts
was general and there was a good
sprinkling of new purchasing, induced
bv fears of a further shrinkage in re-i-cipts,
because of the shortage of coal
and the holding attitude of farmers. An-1
noiincemeut of shutting down ot lndus
tiics was offset bv the cuttnilmcnt of
ttutlsputtotion facilities.
The si7e and quality of this vcar's
nop appear to count for little, owing to
the diflicultlcs of distribution Stocks
at all terminal points nre light. Set
hacks iu hogs nnd fresh weakness in
foreign exchange had only a passing ef
fect. Xloderate rains have fallen over a
wldo area In Argeutlnu and should help
the crop there. r
Oats ugain showed independent
strength and qulckl advanced to a
premium over last night's privilege
price on bujlng bv cash houses and
cmtsido interests Shorts covered. Pur
chasers were handicapped bj the light
ness of offerings in the pit.
Among the influence were small ten
ders from tho country, disappointing re
ceipts and recent snles for export, to
gether with indications thnt the move
ment would bo cut down f uither because
of tho shortage of coal.
