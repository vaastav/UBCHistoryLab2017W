FRIDAY, l)KO. 6, 1889.
The deadlock in the Montana
Jogislnturo still continues, and no
busiucs3 is trausacted. There i* talk
of compromise.
It is said that thirty-six millionaires
reside in tho territory between Dobb's
Ferry and Tarrytown, N'. Y., a dis­
tance oi" only six miles.
The U. S. Navy lost two ^hip? last
week. The Board of Survey Con­
demned the old men-of-war, Quinne
haug ami .luanita, and Ihev will be
sold.
•lud^e Brewer of Kansas his been
appointed associate justice of the
supreme ooiirMo fill the vacancy. A
belter appointment could not have
been made.
I'ohc.rt Porter, superintendent of
the census, predicts that next year
the manufacturing interests of the
country will be valued at twelve
bill ion dollars.
Mont-ma's election troubles briny
up memories of carpet-bag days in
the southern states, when two legisla­
tures and two sets of stale officers,
were the usual thin«.
It is thought that Chicago's chances
for the World's Fair have been in­
jured bv the election of Speaker
lieed. lie is in favor of Neu York
and will probably appoint a commit­
tee of the same opinion.
A bill will be introduced in congress
this winter to increase the tariff on
potatoes. Notwithstanding a tariff
of 1.) cents a bushel on potatoes, there
were over S,000,000 bushels imported
into the United .States last year.
The remains of an extensive city
have been discovered in Massachusetts
by Professor Horsford. It was called
Norumbega, and it is claimed that
the Norsemen built the city long
before the time of Columbus.
The late Boston fire started in a
building that was called "'absolutely
fire-proof." After a few raorc fires,
people will begin to ask architects
what they mean when they say a
building 13 "fire proof
Queen Victoria is said to have
taken more interest in the Brazilian
revolution than in any other event of
late years. She is perhaps fearful
that her subjects will, sooner or later,
imitate Brazil's good example.
The Republican candidates for
house offices were all elected except
Rev. Ramsdell, who was defeated by
some bolting Republicans who com­
bined with the Democrats and elected
Rev. Milburu, the famous blind
preacher, chaplain.
As a change in the rules of the
House will be one of the great (|Ues
tions of interest in the next Congress,
Candidate John L. Sullivan wishes to
put himself on record as favoring
those which have been framed bv the
Marquis of Queensberry.
The Ohio State Journal has nom­
inated Congressman McKinley for
Governor, and claims that he will
sweep the state. His defeat in the
contest tor tin* speakeimiip .
has brought his name out prominent­
ly in this conncction.
W. J. Arkell of N«w ork, pub­
lisher of Judge, has offered the post
office department $100,000 a year for
four years for the privilege of adver
tiseing on the backs of postage stamps.
Mr. Wanamaker refused the offer
because of illegality.
The writer of the famous little
couplet about the "bedbug getting
there all the samo^ died recently in
.Kentucky. This couplet has prob­
ably been sung by more people and
in more places than any other pro­
duction of the kind.
In 1S91 the charters of all Canadian
banks expire, and the plan upon
which they shall be reissued will soon
have to determined. Whether it is
better to continue the old system or
take, pattern bj tho newer and simpler
method in the United States is the
point to be decided.
An excursion consisting of ninety
five prominent business men of Mon­
treal visited the Twin Cities and I)u
luth this week. The excursion was
gotten up by the Canadian Pacific,
which wishes to impress the Eastern
era with the great growth and re­
sources of the Northwest.
Oil the oole on which Lineman
Weeks was killed in New York there
were 132 telephouo wires, 15 fire
wires, 5 Western Union wires and 1
police wire. Tho telephone wires
were distributed all over tho cross
arms. inventor Edison says the
electric wire*, if placed underground,
will be as dangerous as ever.
Aerial navigation has reached this
surprising stage of progress: At the
late Parisian "congress" on the use of
JMIIOOM and carrier pigeons in time
J'of .war it was resolved that "aeronaut*
in time of war should be treated as
-belligerents if they were really spies.'1
1*t'-
Janssene of the Academy of
expressed his belief that in
centary the problem of
ijrtaT navigation would lie solved
PRESIDENTS ^MESSAGE.
President Harrison's first message
was read to congress on Tuesday, and
is received with favor by Republicans
and disfavor by Democrats. It
follows closely the declared principles
of the Republican party, and as that
course was expected and desired, there
is nothing sensational or surprising
in the document. All the public
questions arc ably discussed, and the
recommendations he makes will
doubtleas be adopted by congress.
In regard to the tariff question,
which was the all-impotant one iu
the campaign that resulted in making
the government Republican, he
strongly endorses the principal of pro­
tection to American industries, and
wisely urges the increase of the free
list to include all articles of commerce
the importation of which will not
compete with any extensive industries
in this country. That is undoubtedly
what the people wantt and congress
should carefully procccd to do its
duty in the matter.
The amount of land surrendered to
ths government by the Chippewa
Indian* is about 3,000,000 acres, in­
cluding both agricultural aud pine
lands. For the former they receive
81.25 per acie aud for the latter 83
per thousand board measure of tho
timber. The cash value of this is
estimated at from 825.000.000 to
850,000,000.
The Knights of Labor, at the gen­
eral meeting in Atlanta, indorsed the
single tax idea. The order is regain­
ing its former influence and increas­
ing in membership. The rival to the
Knights of Labor,the Federated Labor
organization, of which Samuel Gom
pers is president, claiias a member­
ship of 800,000, and is probably the
strongest, labor organization in the
world.
The German papers think that the
Empire should, in view of the large
number of Germans in the southern
provinces of Brazil, declare a protect­
orate over that part of the new re­
public. But the Monroe doctrine
stands in the way. The United States
would never consent to see Brazil
disposed of in this way. Tf anything
of the kind is attempted, there will
be trouble between the bald and
black eagles.
Keep the money in circulation at
home. If you want good?, do not by
mislead by the peceptive misrepres­
entations of outsiders that you can
save money by sending abroad for
what you want. Nine times out of
ten you will pay just as much and
fail to get just what you want, as you
cannot give the goods your personal
inspection. Keep your money at
home where you will, in the natural
order of things, sec it again. Every
dollar unnecessarilly sent abroad is a
dollar of poverty added to the com­
munity.
Ortonville Herald: All the great
dailies publish a column of selected
witticisms immediately following their
editorial columns, probably on the
same principle that the bar tender
provides his customers with a glass of
water after he has taken a drink of
villainous whiskev.
Newspapers have a queer way of
treating a president's message. With
scarcely an exception, from the
greatest to the leasts the editors
govern their comments according to
the politics of the president, and not
according to the ability shown in the
messag.e In nothing else do the
newspapers show less judgment than
in discussing such documents. Let
papers of either party speak different­
ly *11*' :nc--a»e than i. tV
cuBtom, and they would almost lose
their party standing.
The year 1889 will be long re­
membered as the most prolific of re­
cent years in terrible disasters of all
kinds. -No country on the globe has
been exempt from calamity. Europe
had many railroad wrecks, steamship
collisions, mine explosions aud earth­
quakes. In Asia, thousands perished
in the Chinese floods, by the earth­
quakes in Japan and the plague iu
Asia Minor. In Africa, outside of
the ever present aud increasing slave
trade, there were earthquakes and
inundations. South and Central
America suffered from terrible earth­
quakes. In North America the long
list of fires and wrecks is headed by
the Johnstown catastrophe. Most of
the disasters in the U. S. were due to
negligence, as shown at Johnstown,
and not, as in most other countries, to
the convulsions of nature.
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.—The public
debt statement issued from the
treasury department today shows a
decrease in the debt amounting to
$4,869,272. The net cash or surplus
in the treasury today is 40,249,187, or
about $5,000,000 less than a month
ago. Nittion&l bank depositories hold
$4,372,688 of government funds. The
gold fund balance remains practically
unchanged during the past month
and today is $187,496,672, and the
silver fund balance has increased
$3,250,000 during the month, and
today amounts to ?1«%510."09. Gov­
ernment receipts during November
aggregated $30,716,967, or $2,259,000
more than during November, 1888.
Customs receipts were $1,250,000 and
internal revenue receipts $1,000,
000 greater than in November last
year.- The pension charge for the
pa&t month wast $10,775,636 against
$21,675,239 in Novembes, 1888, and
the amount drawn front the treasury
for pension payments during the
first' five moptte of the current fiscal
year $59,957,678, agui »«t $^0,805,
040. during/ the corresponding five
month) in the preceding fiscal year.
PATENTS WILL SOON HE
ISSUED.
The Northern Pacific land depart­
ment was notified yesterday by the
commissioner of the general land
office that it would soon receive
patents for the lands in the second
indemnity limit in Minnesota.
These are the lands about which there
was so much controversy several years
ago. Secretary Lama/ decided that
the company had no right to any
second indemnity limit muter its
charter, aud declared the lands
claimed therein by the company open
to settlement. This order was taken
advantage of by a large number of
settlers, and caused the company
considerable trouble. Subsequently
Attorney General Garland reversed
this deci-ion, and it is under this the
patents are to be issued.
Tho following remarks from the
Eastern Chronicle, a prominent Nova
Scotia paper, anent a prorosition to
raise the Dominion's emblem over
Canadian school houses, shows the
direction in which the Canucks are
fast tending. Says the Chronicle:
"What gcod is the Canadian flag?
It is not recognized by any nation on
the earth. It has no placc among
the flags of the nations in the world
and would be no more protection to a
man than one of printed cotton. Why
then should our children be taught to
place confidence in a flag that can
give thein no protection when they
leave their homes? If Canada is
ambitious of having a flag worth a
bauble let her strike out for herself
among the nations of the world.
Until she has the courage to do so for
goodness sake let up on the flag busi­
ness."
Minneapolis Lumberman: The
lumbering railroads are likely to
open up what will some day be one of
the most attractive summer resorts in
Minnesota. Leech lake is a mag­
nificent body of water—one of the
finest among the many fine lakes in
Minnesota. It will not be long before
it is reached by the Duluth iSr Winni­
peg railway, which will probably
touch its northern bolder, while the
logging railway being built by the
Northern Mill company, from Gull
Lake, nearly due north, will, probably,
some day be absorbed by some system
of railway, and afford a direct line
from the Northern Pacific to lake on
the south. Tho forest fastness of
all this region is being invaded by the
railways, and it is only a question of
time when the summer tourist, seeking
for novelty will find more or less to
attract him to what is now the land of
the Indian.
Minneapolis Lumberman: There
is likely to be something of a town
spring up on the Mississippi river at
the point where the Duluth & Winni­
peg railroad crosses that stream,
which will have its being largely in
the lumber business. From this point
will, iu the future, be distributed
the men and the supplies for all the
lumber camps on the head waters of
the Mississippi, which have, heretofore,
been reached by the steamboat aud
bv the tedious tote mad. Some of
the activity which has beed character­
istic of Brainerd and Aitkin, during
the winter, will be transferred to this
new town, which has been named after
H. C. Akelky, although Brainerd
will still be the seat of the lumbering
operations on Pine river, and Aitkin
will be the entre port for sonic of the
lumbering region between the North­
ern Pacific railway and Pokegema
Falls. The railroads- are great ele­
ments in making and unmaking
towns, and the Duluth & Winnipeg,
even though it penetrates west is now,
almost a wHrlcvrsf", a~ r.r'- to play
a part in this line as any road which
has been built.
GLASGOW'S PROSPERITY.
Glasgow is the largest city in Scot­
land, and claims to be the second in
the British empire. It has 800, )00
population, including the suburbs it
is 10 miles long, 5 miles in width and
has over 140 miles of
streets. Persons
who have seen London and man}' of
the great manufacturing places of
England will yet find much that is
interesting in this Scottish commercial
and industrial center on the River
Clyde. Two hundred years ago, as
we read it, Glasgow was a pleasant
town of four streets and ten vessels
were owned here. The city has the
advantage of being modern, for its
growth is really the work of the past
century, and it is remarkable alike
for wide streets, handsome buildings
and for the business capacities and
for the business capacities and pre
servance of its intelligent population,
who have accumulated large wealth.
Paisley, another manufacturing city of
60,000, is seven miles from Glasgow,
and Grenock twenty-one miles distant,
the Glasgow outport for large vessels,
has grown from a iishiug village 200
years ago to 60,000 people and an im­
portant commercial and manufactur­
ing city, with shipbuilding and sugar
refining as leading industries.
If there had been sufficient fire
escapes on the Tribune building the
loss of life would have been averted.
It should be made a criminal offense
for the ownei of a building to not put
up fire escapes after having been
ordered by the building inspector to
do so.
One of the leading papers in Cin­
cinnati made the statement that 75
per cent, of the criminal cases in the
courts of that city were traceable to
the liquor traffic. This .statement
was disputed. The manager of the
paper sent a reporter to examine the
record.*, and he found by actual count
that 81 per cent, of all the cases that
reached the criminal .court records,
owed their origin to (lie drink traffic.
MR. SPEAKER HEED.
Pioneer Press: It was in the ex­
ercise of a sound judgment that the
Republican repi esBntatives in congress
yesterday made Mr. Reed the caucus
nominee for the speakership. The
result had already been foreshadowed
in the news dispatches, and it was
evident three days ago that, unless
something could be done to stop
changes to lleed an the second ballot,
after complimentary obligations should
be discharged, he would be an easy
winner. There have been, from the
first, but two candidates who had any
show of success. The candidacies
of Messrs. Cannon, Burrows and
Henderson were of the sort that look
rather to committee chairmanships
than two ultimate success. The real
fight was between Reed and McKinley.
It is no secret that the sympathies of
Northwestern Republicans in general
were with the former rather
than with the latter. Though
a Western man, aud a man
whose great native ability has been
developed by patient study and long
public service, Mr. McKinley is not
"magnetic,"' and there was a general
fear that he might not be liberal
enough on some of the great questions
to come before cogress. Mr Ileed,
on the other hand, is. beyond a doubt,
the best equipped, on the whole, of
all the candidates for the honor and
the responsibility vested by the rules
of tne house in the speaker's office.
He is a large man, intellectually as
well as physically. He has had
great parliamentary ^experience, and
is ready in action and speech. He is
known, too, and trusted by the best
men of the party everywhere.
We can, of course, expect that, in
the constitution of the important com­
mittees, he will give visible expression
to the fixed policy of the Republican
party. But the Northwest expects
more than this. Our interests have
come to be singularly identical with
those of New England. Industrial
development has brought to the latter
the more liberal views of the traffic,
question that are indigenous to the
former, and the creation of new lines
of traffic, giving us a new outlet by
way of New England for through
business, has drawn closer the bonds
of union. We have reason to hope
that, in as fur as the speaker can
direct the policy of the house, it will
be shaped in harmony with our de­
sires. These considerations, however,
are really secondary to the main
cause for congratulation which is that
the party of the majority has made
no blunder in the first important
move of the session. It has sent its
best man to the front, and the only
objection to his elevation to the
speakership is the loss to the party's
fighting ranks by his absence from
the floor of the house. It is to be
Mr. Speaker Reed, and he will wear
hi-# honors as worthily as he has won
them fairly.
Duluth Tribune: The governor of
Louisana has offered a reward of $500
for the arrest and conviction of the
parties who committed the recent out­
rages upon the Jewish merchants in
East Carroll parish. The governor's
public spirit and sense of justice in
this matter arc commendable, but
should it not be still more commend­
able if he would offer an equal or
even larger reward for the arrest and
conviction of the merchants who have
committed outrages upon innocent and
unoffending blacks in half a dozen
parishes? In the former case the
outrages were confined to destruction
of property, for which the owners can
recover damages. In the latter, out­
rages did not stop short of brutal
murders. If a reward is to be offered
in one ease, why not in the other?
The Chicago lines announces to
the world that pineapple juice has
been found to be a specific for
diphtheria. It is sard that the
negroes of the South have used it for
years and .rarely lose a case. A
couple of prominent Chicago men
have tired it in bad cases in their
families, and it has cured every one.
Simply get a ripe pineapple, squeeze
out the juice and let the patient
swallow it. Repeat the dose at inter­
vals until membrane is all gone.
The juice is of so pungent nature
that it will cut out the diphtheric
mucous. The remedy is so simple
and easy to take that it is worth
trying, anyhow.
DCLUTH, Dec. 1.—For the month
of November just closed there were
received here 9,435 cars of wheat,
while the shipments readied 4,528,
50u bushels. In the last three months
the total shipments from Duluth have
amounted to 10,000,000 bushels, the
largest amount ever shipped out of
here in that length of time, and it is
said the greatest record ever made in
shipments from any primary receiving
market in the world. This wheat
equals one-eighth of the anuual ex­
ports of wheat and flour from this
whole country to Great Britain and
about one-tenth of the entire imports
into that country annually.
It is said that the secret of the
production of cheap aluminum has
been «t by the sudden death of the
proprietor of the works, Mr. Seymour.
He used some unknown chemical at a
certain monent of the action of the
frying and separation. All the em­
ployees were excluded from the room
when he went through the mysterious
process,and anxiety is expressed lest
the secret died with him.

governor is Senator G. S. lyes of St.

Every four minutes inarkes a birth.
In the next two hours after you have
read this, thirty babies have been

paper that records births and deaths
of the preceeding fbur-and'twenty
hours must give 300 seperate items.
Verily, its joys and sorrows are a
multitude. London has 7000 miles
of streets, and if you walked them at
the rate of twenty miles a day, you
would have to walk almost a year,
and more than a year by nearly fifty
days, if you should rest on a Sunday.
And if you were a thirsty sort of a
traveles. and couldn't pass a public
house, don't be alarmed, the 7000
miles have five-and-seventy miles of
public houses so you need not think
of thirst. In a year London folks
swallow down 500,000 oxen, 2,000,000
sheep, 200,000 calves, 300,000 swine,
7,000,000 heads of fowls, 500,000,000
pounds of fish, 200,000,000 oysters,
200,000,000 lobsters—is that enough
to figure on? If not, there are some
million tons of canned provisions, no
end of fruit aud vegetables, and
50,000,000 bushels of wheat. But
bow they wash all the food down you
might be glad to know. It take
200,000,000 quarts of beer. But
more than this, they drink 10,000,000
quarts of rum and 50,000,000 quarts

Those Indemnity Lunds,
St. Cloud Dnily Times: In bis letter of No­
vember 6 to the reclfter mid receiver of tbc land
office at this place, canceling nil the entries on
tbc Northern Pacific indemnity lands which
were made in Novemi-er, 1887, aud during the
year following, the commissioner ef tbe general
land oftiee says: 'The adjustment of the North
cm Pacific Railroad grant in Minnesota shows
that after all of tbe vacant lands in odd aections,
subject to tbc grant, in the granted aud indem­
nity limits, shall have been conveyed to the
grantee, there will
be
a deficit of several hun­
dred thousand acres. The line of railroad watt
constructed across the state within the period
prescribed
by
the laws pertaining to the grant,
aud there is no probability that any portion oi
the grant in said state will be declared forfeited.'
From the above, it is very evident that tho
Northern Pacific will secure all the lands in
qnestiou. The parties will be allowed sixty
days from receipts of notice within which to ap­
peal to the Secretary of the Interior. The home­
stead rights of the parties are restored, and the
mouey they have paid in will
bo
returned to
them upon proper application through the St.
Clond land office.
