THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message of President Harrison ii
a very long »nd an able state paper. It
length should not prevent any citizen who
feels a sincere interest in the affairs of the
nation from reading it slowly, carefully
and in full. It fairly and exhaustively
places before the people the condition of
their country and the affairs of the several
departments of the national Government.
It will take rank among the plainest,
clearest and most conscientious of state
papers. It is not a great document in the
sense that literary brilliancy and politi
cal adroitness and fencing, make a state
paper remarkable. But it is a message
that does honor to the heart of the Pres
ident, and testifies to his courage of con
viction, the sincerity of his purpose and
his patriotic devotion. It is straightfor
ward, strong and unmistakable.
He does not hesitate to antagonize the
silver men, and to point out why he op
poses the free coinage of silver. He does
not hesitate to declare that the duty of the
nation to itself, the claims of common
justice and the calls of humanity demand
that the black man in the South shall be
accorded his full civil rights; that the
suppression of his vote shall cease, and
that the political towering of the ex-slave
shall be brought to a speedy end. He has
the courage, also, to protest against the at
tempt to drive the black man from his
home, and to deprive the South of its chief
labor element. He has the courage, fur
ther, to speak his mind in unmistakable
terms concerning the pensioning of ex
soldiers of the late war, and to insist that
those who served well and long, and were
discharged without disability, but have
since become dependent upon their labor
for support, but by disease not due to
vice, or by accident or age are unable to
support themselves, shall be provided for
by the Government for which they periled
their lives, and be prevented from be
coming dependents upon private charity.
The President has also the courage to
denounce as unfit for the privileges of
American citizenship all classes of people
who assume obligations antagonistic to
social order, in opposition to the laws and
their execution, and who are at enmity
•with the form of government under which
we live —not only would he refuse all such
the benefits of the naturalization laws, but
he would deny them domicile in the coun
try. He quietly but forcibly rebukes civi
service radicals who have lately assailed
the Administration on the ground that it
has proved untrue to the civil service re
form laws; he points out the defects of
those laws and advises legislation to ex
tend and improve them, to render the
civil service more efficient, and to remove
it more and more from political control.
The Democracy will probably assail the
message on the ground that it is inconsist
ent with Republican pledges in advising
reduction in the tariff schedules; but the
President has been careful to reassert the
protective doctrine to which he pledged
himself in the late campaign, and he
points out that limitation of inceme to
the needs of the Government need not
trespass upon the doctrine of the protec
tion of home industries. He makes a
long and fervent plea for the extension of
such governmental aid to ocean mail carry
ing lines as will stimulate the reassertion
of a prominent position for the flag upon
the commercial high seas, and will give
us a fair share of trade through the ave
nues of a strong merchant marine, bearing
the colors of the nation upon all seas and
into all ports. He reasserts the wisdom of
the Chinese Restriction Act, points out
how it is evaded upon the British Colum
bian border, and asks Congress to author
ize the Treasury Department to employ
sufficient force to check the invasion iv
that direction, and that steps be taken to
bring about an understanding with the
Dominion of Canada upon the subject.
The demand for the amendment of the
naturalization laws so as to insure stricter
examination of applicants and the pres
ence in Court of a representative of the
Government to cross-examine all petition
ers for citizenship, and to resist the appli
cation in proper cases, will find a respons
ive echo in every patriotic heart. The
suggestion that the internal revenue be
greatly reduced by the removal of the tax
upon tobacco, and from all spirits used in
the arts and manufactures, will provoke
anew the debate upon the internal revenue
question. The President will probably
find himself supported by the majority of
the people in that recommendation.
The advice that we proceed at once to
greatly enlarge our navy and augment our
coast defenses will find only feeble opposi
tion. The great mass of tlie people will
approve and insist that Congress act dur
ing the present session upon these import
ant subjects with celerity and upon a broad
and distinctly stated policy. The Presi
dent advises, also, that the United States
follow the example ol Great Britain, and
in aiding commercial carriers engaged in
ocean mail service, stipulate that they
shall be so fitted that on demand they may
be speedily converted into armed cruisers,
and taken int»the service of the nation as
a reserve naval force. He advices legisla
tion upon the subject of trusts and injuri
ous combinations to "corner" the products
of the country to the ippression of the
people; that the postal service, which
comes into more intimate communication
jjrith the people than any other branch of
the Government, be still more conserved,
and that to a greater extent it be brought
within the civil service regulations; that
Hawaii be invited to a seat in the Interna
tional Conference now sitting in Washing
ton ; that the policy of the Government
that treats with the Indian as an indi
vidual and discourages the tribal relation
be maintained; that the National Guard
b* encouraged, and aided to occupy the
coast fortresses from time to time for train
ing; «.hat Government aid be given to fur
ther th« enlightenment of the black man,
who wa: so recently in a condition of
slavery, but that such aid shall not be so
extended as to destroy the conviction in
the States of tVe duty of self-helpfulness;
that a National bankrupt law be passed,
and that international copyright be fa
vored. These are but a portion of the
subjects to which the President has ad
dressed himself. The examination of the
message in detail and vith delilteration
must be reserved for other dates.
Senator Stanford, it is said, will re
mtroduce his bill providing for the en
couragement of co-operative industry. It
goes no further than to recognize the asso
ciation of individuals for the conduct of
business and the division of profits,
whether there is money capital or not. In
other words, it is a wise and a beneficient
scheme to aid the capitalization of skill
and labor by association. The thought of
the scheme is one born of broad views of
human possibilities under union of effort,
that will return to each the proportion
that is his due, for the labor put forth or
the skill contributed.
The Southern Pacific Company has
manifested its desire to further the Citrus
Fair interests at Oroville, by announcing
that it will carry all goods for exhibit:on
there at half rat<"S.
Dom Pedro is a sensible man; arriving
off the coast of Europe he was at once be
set by reporters—he refused to be inter
viewed.
NOTE AND COMMENT.
The New Era, published at Benicia. So
lano county, has entered upon its thirteenth
volume.
The most contemptible coward on the
f ice of the earth is he who sneaks into
print and assails another under a tuna de
plume. Such men are always beneath no
tice, and no one is ever injured by their
attacks.
AMUSEMENTS.
At the Metropolitan Theater last night a
large and representative audience assembled
to hear the J. C. Duff Opera Company ia
"Paola," a new production by the authors
of "Erminie." The opera was well received;
it has few airs that will be stored in the
memory or be popularized, but the music
is graceful, light, brisk, quite melodious
and dramatic. The company is a large one
and especially strong in comedy element.
At one time the stage was crowded
by the numbers of the performers. The
chorus is efficient, twenty-four female and
seventeen male voices giving it strength.
The chorus is also admirably trained dra
matically, and gave some very handsome
groupings. In costumery the company is
brilliant, the variety and richness of the
dressing being especially fine. Digby Bell,
the low comedian, had such a reception as
a comic opera singer but seldom receives
from a critical assemblage. The audience
was enthusiastic in its applause and recalls,
and insisted upon repetitions of his
topical songs until he entered protests.
Very little opportunity was afforded to
hear the baritone, Mark Smith, but his ser
enade won him commendatory applause.
The soprano, Januscbowsky, is best in her
upper notes, the middle tones, while sweet,
lack strength. Her voice has, however,
the sympathetic quality in a marked de
gree. Her presence is attractive and her
manner upon the stage the shadow of a
charming foreign accent, and her naivete
made her a favorite from the outset. From
tbe auditorium, when singing, her counte
nance bears a resemblance to that of Emma
Abbott. Kate Gilbert proved to be a plaas
ine singer and a capital actress and gave ex
cellent support, as also did Pearson and Fay.
To Mr. Pierson was given the only bass
solo, which proved him to be a capable
member. Laura Joyce Bell, the contralto,
was heard to advantage but once and was
complimented by a hearty encore. Meas
ured by her success here some years ago,
her voice, while still a pure contralto,
was not heard to such advantage and is
less strong and clear, but possesses
dramatic qualities that make her a
valuable addition to the company. In
Yon Suppe's comic opera. "A Trip
to Africa, 1' to be sung to-night, it is said
she has a role with scores more congenial
and better adapted to her vocal qualities.
The opera this evening also brings the
tenor of the company, Mr. Packard, to the
front. If the opera this evening is as full
of fine humor, genuine wit and keen satire,
and keeps an audience in as merry a vein
as tbe opera of last night, there will be full
compensation for all who attend, since the
company is strong in its ability to entertain.
The thirty-fourth annual ball and drill
of Company A (City Guard) was held last
evening at Armory Hall, which was largely
attended. After the drill Colonel E. H.
McKee, on behalf of Weinstock, Lubin &
Co., presented the company with the
beautiful trophy recently won by it as the
best-drilled company. The company was
under the command of Captain Glas.
The Bazar of Days, under the auspices
of the ladies of the Unitarian Society, was
well attended again yesterday at the
Pythian Castle. It has been a very pleas
ant affair.
The box office for the Antiope season
opens to-day. Emphatic denial is given by
the management to the stories published
in San Francisco of secession from the
troupe.

A VOICE FROM POST ST.
A I.ady Belates tiro Astonishing
Experiences.
To whom it may concern: I hare tried
almost every conceivable remedy for bilious
ness daring the past five years as I am of a
bilious temperament and suffer much from
ilomach and liver troubles. But nothing
ever gave me the relief that I obtained from
using Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. In fact I
think it a cure for those ailments. At the
time I was using it I had a little girl living
In my family whose neck was seriously af
fected by a large open sore, and we tried a
great many kinds of lotions, salves and blood
purifiers to no avail. I gave her some of my
medicine (Joy's VegetableSarsapariilajthink
ing it might benefit her «nd as it was purely
vegetable, knew it could do her no harm. To
jny astonishment she began to improve, and
within two weeks it was entirely healed and
the is now as well as ever.

A CRISIS IN SPAIN.
It Looks as Though She Will Follow
Brazil's Example.
Midrid, December 3d.—There is great excite
ment throughout Spain over the agitation in
favor of a republic that has been growing since
the overthrow cf the Brazilian Empire. It has
increased to such a degree within a week that
an uprising is imminent. A crisis was averted
by the Queen Regent agreeing to a modification
of the Cabinet to appease the Republicans.
This measjre is only regarded as palliative
and of temporary effect, for the Republicans
continue to meet publicly and urge their cause.
At a recent meeeting congratulatory addresses
to the Provisional Government of Brazil were
adopted also declaring, "We hope to lound a
republic in Spain at an eariy date, emulating
your example."
A dispatch from Vienna says the news from
Spain onuses alarm at Vienna, which was the
home of Maria Christina before Bhe became
Queen of Spain, and who is regarded with deeD
affection.
.Emperor Francis Joseph is much disturbed
over the concessions made the Spanish Republi
cans, aud is quottd as saying the Queen's action
would hasten a revolution.
FEDERATION OF REPUBLICS.
Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, San
Salvador and Nicaragua.
Managua (Nicaragua), November 12th.—Pres
ident Saeasa has signed a treaty admitting Ni
caragua into the union of the Republics of
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, San Salvador
and Guatemala, under the name of the United
states of Central America, but it Is believed the
Nicaraguau GoDgress will reject the measure.
The plan of the Union provides that for the
first ten years it will simply be an offensive and
delensive alliance, and the President of the
Union will have charge only of the diplomatic
and foreign relation.- (if the live republics.
At the expiration of that period the Union
will be cemented by the adoption of a i (.institu
tion, which will embrace all the political, com
mercial and other relations between the five
republics and foreign power>
A common monetary standard and common
tariff laws will be adopted, but there will be
free trade between the different republics.
Honduras, Guatemala and San Salvador have
already signed the treaty, and it is understood
Costa Rica will do the same.
INSPIRED WORDS.
Gladstone's Liberal Policy Well Received
at Manchester.
London, December 3d —At the Manchester
meeting to day Gladstone inspired great enthu
siasm by his definite exposition of the Liberal
policy. He said Ireland is the leading <iue*tlon
of the day, and that the Tories would have
been converted to tbe Liberal view subject by
this time hut for dissenting Liberals. The split
In the Liberal party, he said, would not have
occurred except lor the gersonal ambition of
some Tories and their allies, who desired more
to form a national party than to do political
justice.
He severely arraigned the Unionist leaders on
this point, and said the plan of the campaign
was a necessary consequence of the Govern
ment's refusal to grant proper relief to Ireland.
There was, he said, less crime in Ireland than
in England. He was of the opinion the country
had clearly expressed a desire there should be
a change in the administration of Ireland, and
the Liberals might look to the future with con
fidence.
EDglish Expressions on the Message.
London, December 3d.—The I'ost says: If
Fresident Harrison carries out in practice the

and expresses surprise that the Western States
do not revolt against the heavy exactions of
taxation imposed for the benefit of the cotton
and iron-workers of the Atlantic States.
The Standard thinks tariff reform may mean
something real a couple of years hence. Half
of the present expenditures is mere extrava
gance, that can be dispensed with when the
people decide to crush the secret of Tammany.
Portugal Will Fight.
Lisbon, December 3d.—The Government will

CRIME IN COLORADO.
An Old Lady Murdered—A Strange
Family.
Dznvek (Col.), December 3d.—A horrible dis
covery was made here late to-night, which may
vet prove to be a tragedy. About a year and a
hall ago Mrs. Ritchie, an old gray-haired woman
about sixty years of age, came here from Chey
enne, Wyo., accompauied by a young man
about twenty-five, wuom she represented as hpr
son, and a deal and dumb daughter about fif
teen.
They lived in various parts of the city until
about two months ago, when they engaged
apartments at 1621 Stout street, where they
lived a very retired life.
Three weeks ago the mother and son went on
a protracted debauch. The old lady had not
been seen for several days, and the landlord be
coming alarmed broke open the door of her
room to-night, and was horrified by finding the
woman lying upon the floor by the side of her
bed dead, with her face almost devoured by
rats. The body was taken to iho Coroner's
olUcc, and there will be an investigation to
morrow.
The son was found In an adjoining room
beastly drunk and taken to the Matiou-house,
where he now lies, unable to speak or give an
account of himself.
The dead woman is reported to have 520,000
on deposit in the First National Bank.
The family went to Cheyenne from Texas,
and while living in Wyoming, a son was mys
teriously murdered. It is said that the deaf
and dumb daughter knows who committed the
crime, but refuses to divulge the secret, and no
arrests have been made.
Officers' Raid.
At 1:30 a. m. to day a squad of eight
officers raided the Lafayette saloon and
two others in the immediate neighborhood,
and arrested thirty tramps, opium fiends
and crooks. They were all landed in the
City Prison.
