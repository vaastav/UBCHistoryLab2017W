I'KOIfiniTIOX PROHIBITS.
A Kansas Case Decided b,v tl»e I : ni teil
States Supreme Court.
A important decision made, and one like- j
ly to be far reaching in its consequences, j
in the U. S. Supreme Court, on Monday, *
in the so-called Kansas prohibition cases, 1
of Mugler, vs. the State of Kansas, and the
State of Kansas vs. Ziebold and others.
The judgment of the court was pronounced
in a long and elaborate opinion bv Justice
Harlan.
Justice Harlin concluded the decision
sustaining the Kansas State prohibitory
law as follows : "It is a fundamental prin
ciple In our institutions, indispensable to
the preservation of public liberty, that one
of the separate departments of Govern
ment shall not usurp the powers commit
ted by the Constitution. As to the allega
tion that prohibition of the manufacture
and sale of liquor deprives liquor dealers
of their property without due process of
law, the court says al! property under our
form of government is ieot to the obli
gation that it shall not used so as to
injuriously altect the rights of the com
munity, rind thereby become u nuisance,
lire State ot Kansas bad the right to pro
hibit the liquor traffic. It did nut thereby
takeaway the property of brewers. It
simply abated a nuisance. The property
is not taken away from its owners. They
are only prohibited from using it lor the
specific purposes which the Legislature de
clared to be injurious to community. For
reasons stated, says Justice Harlan, we are
of opinion that Mugler plaintiff in error,
has not been denied by judgments of the
Supreme Court of Kansas any right, priv
ilege or immunity secured to him by the
Constitution of the United^ States, and its
judgment in each case is accordingly af
firmed. We are also of opinion that the
Circuit Court of the United States erred
in dismissing the bill ot the State in the
suit against Ziebold and Hogelin, the de
cree in that case is reversed and the cause
remanded with the direction that it enter a
decree granting to the State such relief as
the act of March 7, 1S85, authorizes."
GERMANY AND RUSSIA.
Tlie Trouble with Kussiti not, Ended Yet.
!
A Berlin dispatch says on the side of
Russia the situation still continues grave.
Tlte Czar ha« failed to gain control of the
anti-Teutonie party, and if he himself is
convinced of the friendly intentions of the
German Government, he has been unable
to persuade the majority in the Imperial
Council, Some practical measures are nec
essary to restore an entente. In the mean
time the anti Germans parennial in the
Ministry remains in power, and an order of
De Geirs, instructing the press to cease at
tacking Germany, is defied.
The severest contest during the session
of the Reichstag will be that over the hill
making the legislative period five instead
of three years. The bill is practically a
j Government affair. The official organs
j support the proposal strongly, on the
! ground that it will relieve the people of the
j disturbing influences of often recurring
j elections» while giving greater independ
i ence to Parliament. There will be a fierce
* and envenomed fight before the measure
can pass, but it will pus- with a solid ma
jority, equalling the septennate vote. No
combination can defeat any bill having the
support of the Government groups. The
project to organize the Landwehr and
j Landstrum is still before the Bimdcsratli,
hut some of its provisions were made
known. No official estimates h-.ve vet |
been issued a- to what result the project I
will have in strengthening the reserve, but i
it is reported it will ir.erea-e the defensive
force of the Empire by 400,000 men.
