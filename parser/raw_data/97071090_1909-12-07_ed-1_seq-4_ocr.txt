TO REMEDY THE
One feature of President Taft's message will meet uni
versal approval, namely, tho recommendation of the ap
pointment of a commission to simplify and expedite the
administration, of justice by a revision of laws and court
methods. TV
It is ono of the scandals of our time that any unscrupu
lous lawyer can so impede the course of justice as to de
lay punishment of criminals indefinitely and in many in
stances to enable them to escape penalties altogether.
A wealthy culprit can always stave off the execution
of his sentence, no matter how strong are the evidences of
guilt, while the case drags its weary way through court
after court, and the chances are that at least one of the
courts will construe some unimportant technicality that
has nothing to do with the
to make a new trial possible and the entire case be fought j
over again. This, combined with the fact that the culprit 1
employs the best grade of legal talent, while the state j
usually secured, for the small remuneration that goes with
the office, a poorer grade of legal ability for prosecution, '.
increases the chances for escape for the criminal.
President Taft says: "The deplorable delays in the!
administration of civil and criminal law have received the j
attention of committees of the American Bar association
and many state- bar. associations, as well as the consid- j
ered thought of judges and jurists. In my judgment, a -change
in judicial procedure with a view to reducing its
expense to private litigants in civil eases and facilitating;
the dispatch of business and final direction in both civil j
and criminal cases constitutes the greatest need in our,
American institutions. I do not doubt for one moment
that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited in
lyncliings are directly due to the uncertainties and injus-
tice growing out of the delays in trials, judgments and the !
execution thereof by our courts. The procedure in the
federal courts should furnish an example for the state;
courts. I therefore recommend legislation providing for
the appointment by the president of a commission with au
thority to examine these laws and equity procedure of the
federal courts of first instance, the law of appeals from!
these courts to the courts of appeals and to the supreme
court and the costs imposed in such procedure oh the pri-!
vate litigants and upon the public treasury and make rec
ommendations with a view to simplifying and expediting
the procedure as far as possible and making it a sinexpen
sive as may be to the litigant of little means."
ZELAYA GOVERNMENT DOOMED.
That the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which has
kept Central America in turmoil for years, is nearing an
end is foreshadowed by the actions of congress and the
administration. President Taft foreshadows the course
of America as follows:
"It would be most unnecessary to rehearse here the sad
tale of unspeakable barbarities and oppressions alleged
to have been committed by the Zelayan government. Re
cently two Americans were put to death by order of Pres
ident Zelaya himself. They
a revolution which had continued many weeks and was
in control of about half of the
cording to the modern enlightened practice of civilized
nations, they were entitled to be dealt with as prisoners
or war. . ,,
"At the date when this message is printed this govern
ment has terminated diplomatic relations with, the Zelaya
government, for reasons made public in a communication
to the former Nicaraguan charge d'affaires, and is intend
ing to take such steps as will be found most consistent
with its dignity, its duty to American interests and its
moral obligations to Central America and to civilization.
It later may be necessary for me' to bring this subject to
the attention of congress in a special message."
Zelaya 's reign will end as Castro in a hasty flight
with the money stolen from the people, or by the assas
sination of the petty tyrant, a route taken by many another
Central American dictator.

LAND OF NOD
AN OLD FRIEND
Local Talent, However, Could Put it
All Over the Traveling
Company.
It much like meeting a friend of
other days when tho curtain went up
on "The Land of Nod" at tho Med
ford Monday evening. Tho same old
lines which havo delighted us so long
wore there and proved not to havo
lost all of their old charm, Tho
house was well filled and tho eve
ning enjoyed for the moat part. Now,
that's enough on tho show, so hero's
a tip:
Let's line up Medford's talent and
wo can "put It nil over 'em."
First wo will let Mrs. Hazolrlgg
play "Donnio," the little strangor in
a strange land; put Miss Palmer In
ns Jack of Hearts, Mrs. Burgess, Itory
Dory Alice, and Miss Claromont tho
chorus girl. That takea caro of tho
girls; and now for tho boyo:
"Quiz" and "Art" cantako caro of
April Fool and Rarebit; Ed Andrews
can fill tho bill as tho Sandman. Wal
ters can play "tho man 1 i tho moon,"
and as Jim Stevens is coming back,
wo can run him in 'as "Tho Devil,"
and with a fow embollishmonts tho
local players could teach tho travel
ing company something of acting.

On Firo Escapes.
To tho Kdltor: it may not bo
known nmongttt hotel keepers gonor-
nlly that at the regular session of tho
Oregon legislature this year n law
was passed requiring all hotel or
lodging housed, more than two sto-
rloa high, In tho xtato of Oregon, to
he provided with at leant ono (Iro
escape of iron or othur Incombustible- (
material on each exposed side of Hitch
hotel building, conveniently accessi
ble frnm each room of such hotel !
building. The law further provides
thnt all lodging houses and hotels
shall be provided with mattlln or sisal ,
rope not less than one-hnlf Inch In 1
diameter nnd of sufficient length to
reach the ground, knotted 1- Inches
apart, In ovry outside room used an
a lodging room, except tho rooms on
the ground floor. The legislature
did not fall to provide u penalty for
failure to comply with the provisions
of this net. It seems that every,
day persons operating hotels or lodg
ing houses fall to comply with tho
provisions of this act constitutes a
separate offense.
Chapter 37 of the session laws of
1000 sets forth In detail the provi
sions of this act.
Your correspondent takes this
means of calling public attention to
this law because b InterMU of pub
lic policy In our rapidly oxpnudlng
cltlws nnd towns seems to require the
enforcement of this law; nnd the re
cency of Its puswige leaves many In
Ignorance- as to tho existence of such
a law.
