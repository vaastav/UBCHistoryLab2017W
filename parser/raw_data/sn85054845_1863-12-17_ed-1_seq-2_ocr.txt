Censorship.
The editor of the Dcm. & Sent, appears
to be peculiarly wrathy and "out of sorts"
of late. His editorials fairly "bile over"
with furor against everybody and every
thing ; especially again' st the "six-foot
government," "old rail splitter," "old
Lincoln," and Thanksgiving. Well, well,
after the crushing defeat his "untevrified"
party has received lately, it is not much
wonder tho poor fellow is "down in the
mouth." No wonder he is so peculiarly
indignant, and makes his sanctum fairly
thunder with his fulminations of. wrath.
But why does he take especial occasion
to direct his artillery, both "fore and aft,"
against this day of "Thanksgiving and
l'rayer?" Is there any crime associated
with the act? Have not such days been
pet apart since the days of Washington?
Is it an offence to celebrate this day just
because a Democratic Administration did
not appoint it Are the President and
loyal Govern orsfoois to appoiut it, and
are the loyal millions fools who observe
it? Or must we bow to the beck and
nod of copperhead editors, and only gmile
when they approve, aud forbear when they
disapprove?
To say the least, the editorials of the
Dc.a. t& Salt, on the subject of Thanks
giving, and all editorials of that ilk, smack
forcibly of blatant infidelity. There is a
devilish disposition manifested among this
fraternity to scandalize all ministerial and
religious associations, except those which
chime in with their own peculiar views.
Such an intolerant spirit as this would
uusheath the bloody sword of St. Barthol
omew, or light the fires of Smithfield.
You would think, by perusiug the pages
of that sheet, you had a reproduction of
Voltaire or Tom Paine. Listen to tne
blang taunts .and phrases flung at the
worshipers on Thanksgiving by the edito
rials in question "long-faced hypocrites,"
"Oh, ye puritar.isal hypocrites," "wrestle
with the Lord," "make a joyful noise unto
Him for the blessings of a fratricidal war !"
Thus he rants and burlesques the most
sacred things with demoniacal glee. Can
the obtuse sensibility of this censor see
DOthing sublime in twenty millious of
yeoplc on their kuee3 in thauksgivmg to
the Most High for benefits received during
the past year ? Can he see nothing for
which the nation should be thankful, and
bas he nothing For which to be thankful
himself? Every prut minded' man who
worshiped upon that day comes under the
gweeping charge of "hypocrite" from this
immaculate, and his whiskey-guzzl'iDg
clan. He can see nothing but tb.3 ghosts
of ."greenbacks," "army contractors," and
"provost marshals," and can see nothing
more noble Tn a National Thanksgiving
than "old Lincoln's Holiday." God pity
his stupidity !
And then, too, he has not forgotten the
gong which he and his party have been
piping since the beginning of the war,
your murderous hands are yet raised
against your brothers," and "let them
extend the olive branch, the emblem of
peace, to the people of the South." Mis
erable sycophant ! Docs he not know that
the South refuse, and have-ever refused
uerTmeddliog. propositions as "peace on
any terms f" A "cessation of hostilities,"
iad4! And let such tyrants as Jeff.
Davis dietate such terms aa they please !
No, sir, we have listened too long to that
jren song, and tha man who gives utter
ance to such treasonable sentiments is an
enemy to his country. Peace must como
through suljuyaltoii, until every traitor
North and South Bhall cryenougb, and
then may we have an honorable, permanent
peace. Does not this sleepy editor hear
the voke of tha freemen of the North,
speaking above the roar of battle, that
they will accept no other peace. If he
does not hear it now, perhaps he will hear
it io more audible tones next November.
The next butt of ridicule for this cen
sorious editor is, "the Gettysburg Ceme
tery." And through garbled extracts and
Maring misrepresentations, he tries to
depreciate the great event of its dedication
juVt because the "old rail splitter" was
there! He cau see nothing grand or
befitting in the ceremonies of the occasion,
looking through the colored glasses with
which he alway3 -views the acts of the
Administration. He calls this "battle of
the war," this most important conflict
siucc' Waterloo, "a useless encounter,
tho "Gettysburg slaughter." And, of
coursej the dauntless braves who fought
and died iu that sanguinary struggle, fall
under the same opprobrium.
Besides all this, there is a malignant
and wanton misrepresentation of facts in
the whole affair, iu order to hoodwiuk the
willing dupes who are blindfolded by this
mischievous paper. lie says, "Speeches
were- delivered by Edward Everett, Old
Lincoln, aud Secretary Seward," leaving
the impression that all spoke at the dedi
cation, whereas Mr. Seward made no
speech at the dedication proper. Then,
too, he represents 3Ir. Lincoln "mounting
the rostrum," and "jabbering some vulgar
jargon," and giving utterance to a speech
which ho did not make on dedication day,
but, if at all, at a different time. And
the speech which the President did make
is admitted by. the best judges to be a
master-piece of composition. Wo challenge
the Devi. & Sent, to publish, the rijht
sneech, or else acknowledge a wilful false
hood. Again, he represents Everett's
oration as a "flat" production. This, too,
is a studied misrepresentation, for this
oration, like all else that falls from the
lips of this gifted orator, shall be immor
tal, when the editorials of the Dem. & Sent.
are buried in oblivion.
It is enough to make the blood of every
loyal man mount to his cheek to hear the
wild raving of that incendiary sheet. It
is enough to make the honored dead turn
in their graves to hear these foul aspersions
cast on their memory. But the names of
these heroes will live when their defamers
shall be forgotten !
Tlie Draft.
Tho Provost Marshal of this district
gives notice, by handbill and otherwise,
that any person so desiring may appear
before the Board of Enrollment, at Hun
tingdon, on or before the 20th inst.
next Monday and have his name stricken
off the Enrollment list, if he can show, to
the satisfaction of the Board, that he is
not, and will not be at the 'time fixed for
the draft, liable to military duty, on ac
count of
1st. Alienage.
2d. Non-residence.
3d. Tjnsuitableness of age.
4th. Manifest permanent physical disability.
Printed lists of ail persons liable to
draft have been distributed throughout
the district, so that it may be definitely
known who is and who is not enrolled,
who is? in the "first class" and who in the
"second class," &c, &c. Perhaps no
handbills ever posted in any community
have attracted such widespread attention
as these announcements that the parties
whose names are therein set forth are
among the number from whom Father
Abraham's required "300,000 more" ars
to be drawn iu January. Persons cogni
zant of any who are subject to military
duty and whose names do not appear on
these lists are requested io notify the
Board of Enrollment of the fact, who will
take measures to rectify such omission.
It should be understood that in all
oases where exemption is asked on the
ground that "two or more sons are liable
to military duty," the choice must be
made before the 20tli inst., and not post
poned until the draft has been made.
Last draft, owing to the law being new
and imperfectly understood, parents were
allowed to exempt one where two were
dmltd. Thi3 cannot be allowed in the
January draft.
In this connection, we may mention
that a bill fuis been introduced into Con
gress proposing to repeal the 300 clause
of the Conscription Act. Provost Marshal
General Fry is reported as being favorable
to such a step, whereas Senator Wilson,
the author of the bill, and the Secretary
of War are opposed to it. -
8 We issued the President's Message
ia an extra on Saturday. Of course our
subscribers have ere now read it, pondered
over it, thoroughly digested it, and of
course they have come to the conclusion
that it is an able, statesmanlike document,
worthy the clear head and kind heart of
him that conceived it. Elsewhere we
print a abort criticism from the Philadel
phia Press touching tue chief point dis
cussed in the Message, namely, the pro
posed plan for the restoration of the
rebellious States to tho rights and privile
ges formerly rojoved by them in the
Union, which so fully embodies our views
in the premises that we assume it as our
own. Head it.
gjr The Army of the Potomac is represen
ted to be going into winter quarters,
The President's Message.
- The President's Message will satisfy
the country. It is worthy of the people,
and the time. Mr. Lincoln has, bejond
all question, the power of dealing with
grand subjects in noble simplicity, and the
unusual merit of divesting statesmanship
of its mystery, and truth of its disguise.
Perhaps more candid than any statesman
of his time, certainly as honest aud
straightforward as any, he never faila to
convince even his enemies of his sincerity,
and in this message must succeed in con
vincing all loyal men of his wisdom. It
is a document which briefly and exhaust
ively rehearses the events of the year,
fully states the condition of the country,
our relations with foreign Powers, the
progress of the war, and treats with
masterly power of the vital principles of
the contest. But it might have possessed
all this merit, and yet have disappointed
the expectations of loyal men j it has
satisfied them because, in addition, it
contains that for which the country has
patiently wjjjted and anxiously longed a
practical plan for the restoration of the
rebellious States to their privileges in the
Union. This is the great merit of the
message. Thi3 is one of tho crowning
glories of Mr. Lincoln's Administration.
We may pas3 by, for the present, all that
he says of foreign .treaties, domestic pros
perity, and military victory. It is suffi
cient for the satisfaction of all loyal men
that he has solved the problem of peace.
There are three sentences in the Presi
dent's message which should be written in
letters of gold : "The crisis which
threatened to divide the friends of the
Union is past." "I shall not return to
slavery any person who is free by the
terms of the Proclamation or by any act
of Congress." "I proclaim full pardon to
ajl who solemnly swear to henceforth
faithfully support, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States and the
Union of the States thereunder." The
first of these is the truth upon which all
our-hopes are. based ; the second is a sub
lime declaration that henceforth freedom
istho law of the Republic ; the third is a
noble appeal which, it seems to us, can
not fail to show the sufferiug people of
the South that it is not upon them that
the United States makes war, but upon
the crime of their leaders, and the crueity
of their rebellion. The last two truths,
indeed, strengthen and sustain the first,
for the ciisis is past, when the President
can thus decree by the will of tho people
the abolition of slavery, and at the same
time offer full pardon to the men, who, to
protect slavery, attempted to destroy the
Government.
The offer the President has made is the
most generous, the most maguanimous,
that ever lawful ruler made to criminal
insurgents. Magnanimity could go no
further; conciliation could grant no more.
Upon conditions the easiest to fulfil, and
the least humiliating to accept, he has
offered the people of the South, no limited
and imperfect pardon, but absolute and
entire forgiveness. He has guarantied to
them every right they formerly possessed,
insured them their olden equality with
the people of Pennsylvania and Massachu
setts, asked them to return to thtir alle
giance, not as men disgraced, but to
reassume, with honor, tho proud positions
they had forfeited. The oath they must
take to obtain this full pardon is one so
carefully and delicately worded that every
loyal man, from the humblest laborer to
the highest officer of the Government,
might take it without feeling that it im
plied censure of his past action or doubt
of his future course. This noble Procla
mation of Pardou is the counterpart of
the Proclamation of Emancipation ; to
gether they will bo recorded in history as
embodiments of the justice and the
mercy of the loyal wen of the United
States. If Mr. Lincoln, at the beginning
of the war, seemed to bo one of those
fortunate men who had greatness thrust
upon them, he has since shown the higher
power to achieve greatness by unsurpassed
fidelity to a national trust and cjmprehen
sion of -a world's revolution .
If we had ever despaired of success, we
could no longer despair, now that we have
read this calm.and earnest message, which
itself so quiet and firm, must kindle a
new enthusiasm for the cause. It is
principle, right, liberty, that is the toul of
the President's message. He has not gone
back cne inch. He has given shape and
thought to the inspiration of the people,
In reading his plain, firm, but singularly
gentle words, we imagine a man who bends
but does not tremble beneath the burden
of the fate of a continent. We read in
thU solemn message the integrity ofour
chief magistrate; the resolution of the
American people to maintain, in spite of
all that is past or to come, the Union ;
their enmity to slavery as the foe of the
Union ; their confidence in their own
power ; their trust in humanity, and their
faith in Almighty God.
tgfc, The English prize ring is intensely
excited by -a match that is to come off
between Heenan the Benecia Boy, as he
is called in our prize ring vocabulary
and an English champion named King.
The stakes are 85,000 on each side the
fiirht to come off during the coming Holi
day season. An announcement has just
been made through Belts Life, in London,
under the signatures of the leaders of the
prize ring, that fair play will be enforced
in this and all future fights. The betting
on the coming mill is largely in favor of
the American champion, his backers alt
offering their thousands at the rat of $60
to 840? .
Tne President is slowly recovering
from his recent severe illness, - f
Tlie Currency.,
Now that the armies of the nation are
gathering victories wherever they direct
their steps or deliver blows, the copper
head enemies of tho Administration and
the Government are at a loss how to rend
er aid or sympathy to the traitors. Having
failed to eecure for the Confederacy a
single foreign relation on which to create
an alliance having been unsuccessful in
building up a party in the free States, by
the victories of which eopperheadism was
to be invested .with power indeed, having
been rebuked and repulsed at all points,
in the unholy labor of attempting to add
to the enibirrass merits of the Govern
ment, the copperhead press is directing its
attention to thefioancial policy of Secre
tary Chase, in the hope that they can
create a panic with reference to its sound
ness, and thus secure a crisis and bank
ruptcy, which in the end may serve the
rebel cause more than victory. The sys
tem of finance adopted by the Secretary
of the Treasury has done as much to save
the nation from utter ruin, as have the
results of any battle fought since the
rebellion was precipitated. It may, indeed
be regarded as the policy upon which
rests our present aud future hopes of
business success if it is not the sheet
anchor of our national existence. If the
different States allow this system to be4
decried ; or if it is not at onco adopted as
the policy of every State Government, there
is reason to believe that the enemies of
of the Government will succeed in ruining
the national credit, and then will come
woe indeed. What is now needed is the
co-operation of every State Government.
The mass of paper which now passes as a
substitute for money, and which is not
worth more than the paper which it is
printed upon, a hundred miles from any
of the banks of issue, must be driven from
circulation, and the national currency of
the country substituted. This must be
done if the national financial policy is to
prevail and it this is not done by the
speedy action of the approaching Legisla
tures of this and other States, then our
national system ot finance will be con
stantly in danger, and our prosperity of
course ever in jeopardy.
This is a very important subject.
The question of substituting paper for
that of the heterogeneous State bank
circulation which now floods every locality
cannot be resisted if we desire to protect
ourselves from a ruinous credit. The soon
er each Legislature provides for this by
law, the better for the security and the
prosperity of all the States.

J6Sf A daring act of piracy was com
mitted on Monday week, off Cape Cod.
The steamer Chesapeake wa3 seized by
Secession passengers, 17 in number, who
went on board at New York. Tha chief
engineer and mate wero wounded, the
second engineer wai killed, and thrown
overboard ; the captain and crew were
landed at St. John's, N. 13. The steamer
then sailed in an easterly direction, and
was subsequently seen alongside another
vessel. It is supposed that she took on
board a supply of coal from her.' The
steamer and cargo were valued at $180,
000. The steamer sailed from New York
on Saturday, at i p. m., and was one of
the regular line plying between New
York and Portland. It was the Chesa
peake that captured Capt. Reed and his
party when they attempted to run away
with the cutter Cushing from the harbor
of. Portland. The Collector at Portland,
has asked for authority to send the gun
boat Agawam after the Chesapeake.
Dispatches from Washington state that
vigorous measures have been already taken
to capture the pirates, the Agawam and
other vessels being ordered in pursuit.
BgThe Richmond papers contain a
dispatch stating that Breckinridge and
Bragg were serenaded at Dalton on the

dead, as reported.

The Draft Proclamation by
tlie Governor.
Headquarters Pa. Militia,
Harribblro, Dec. 10, 18G3.
The President ot the United States
having, by his communication of the 9th
inst.-, in response to propositions submitted
to him, relating t the recruiting service
in Pennsylvania, under his call of October
17th, for 300,000- men, approved of so
much thereof as is comprised under the
following points, it is ordered
That the recruitment of vo'unteers for
the various regiments now in the field will
be conducted accordingly, viz :
- I. Details,for tecruiting service in the
State, will be rnado of officers of Pennsyl
vania regiments in the field, whose term
of service expire? in 18GL To facilitate
the recruiting of the quota such appoint
ment tf officers in the field will be made
by the Governor, where practicable, on
the recommendation of duly authorized
Committeesrepresenting cities, boroughs
and townships, to recruit for their several
localities. These recommendations should
not, however, be made indiscriminately,
but with due regard to the character of
the person named, and his ability to per
form the important. duties of the post.
II. When practicable, old regiments
.will be returned to the State to be recruit
ed. F
III. The Volunteers who shall be enlist
ed will remain under the control of the
Governor at such camps or rendezvous,
and under such commanders as he may
designate, and until ready to be sent to
their resiments in accordance with General
Orders No. 75 of 18G2.
IV. Premiums not exceeding twenty-five
dollars for veterans, and fifteen dollars for
new recruits, will be paid to officers
detailed for recruiting service from regi
ments in the field, when the recruits are
accepted by the United States. Payment
to be made by Lt. Col. Bomford, U. S. A.
Acting Assistant Provost Marshal General.
V. Volunteers furnished by .cities and
other localities, will be duly credited on
the draft fixed for January 5, 1864 and
also all such volunteers as may have been
mustered into the service of the United
States since the draft,' the number so
credited to be detached from their
proportion of the quota assigned the
States under recent call. Information
regarding the quotas of counties, cities,
townships or wards, can be procured ou
application to the respective District
Provost Marshals.
VI. Authority will be given to officers
detached for recruiting service from
regiments in the field, to raise complete
companies of infantry, to be sent to such
regiments in the field as may have less
than their proper number of company
organizations.
VII. Colored volunteers for the colored
regiments of Pennsylvania, will beaccept
ed as a part of the quota, and also such as
have been mustered into the service of the
United States since the draft, to be
credited to cities and other localities on
their proportion of the State's quota under
recent call.
VIII. Camps of rendezvous will be
established at proper localities in charge
of commandants and skillful surgeons, to
be appointed by the Goveror.
IX. To every recruit who is a Veteran
Volunteer, as defined' in General Order3 of
the War Department of June 25, 1803,
No. 191, for recruiting Veteran Volun
teers, one month's pay in advance, and a
bounty and premium of 402 ; and to all
other recruits not veterans, accepted and
enlisted as required in existing orders,
one month's pay in advance, and in
addition a bounty and premium of 302
will bepaid.
The short time now remaining, within
which to fill the quota of the State by
enlistments, and" thus avoid the impending
draft, admonishes the loyal citizen? of the
importance of providing, by local bounties
the strongest inducements to volunteers.
Municipalities of other States, by this
means, are sending from Pennsylvania
the able-bodied rueu who should replenish
her own regiments. Pennsylvania, with
a deficiency less, proportionately, than
any adjacent Commonwealth, should show
by her promptness and alacrity now her
ability to maintain the high position she
has heretofore and still occupies among
her sister States, in contributing to
suppress this rebellion.

THE SECRETARY of THE TREAS
URY has not yet given notice of anr
intention o withdraw this popular Loan froni
Sale at Par, and until ten days notice is giren,
the undersigned, as ''General Subscription
Agent," will continue to supply the public.
The whole amount of the Lean authorized
is Five Hundred Millions of Dollars. Xear'r
Four Hundred Millions have been already sub
scribed for and paid into the Treasury, mostly
within the last seven months. The larg
demand from abroad, and tlie rapidly increas
ing home demand for use a3 the basis for
circulation by National Banking Association!
now organizing in all parts of the conntrj,
will, inaverv short period, absorb the balance.
Sales have iately ranged from ten to fifteen
millions weekly, frequently exceeding threa
millions daily, and it is well known that tha
Secretary of the Treasury has ample and
unfailing resources in the Duties on Import
and Internal Revenues, and in the issue of
the Interest bearing Lgal Tender Treasury
Notes, it is almost a certaiuty that he will
not find it necessary, for a long time to come,
to seek a market for a.nv other Icng or per
manent Loans, TnE INTEREST AND PRIN
CIPAL OF WHICH ARE PAYABLE IN GOLD.
Prudence and self interest must force the
minds of those contemplating the formation
of National Banking Associations, as well as
the minds of all who have idle money on
their hands, to the prompt conclusion
that they should lose no time in subscribing
to this most popular Loan. It will soon b
beyond their reach, and advance to a hand
some premium, os was the result with tl
"Seven Thirty" Loau, when it was all sold
and could no longer be subscribed for at par.
It w a Six per Cent Loan, the Interest and
Principal payable in Coin, thus yielding out
Xine per Cent, per annum at the present rate of
premium on coin.
The Government requires all duties on im
ports to be paid in Coin ; these duties have
for a long time past amounted to over a
Quarter of a Million of Dollars daily, a tnin
nearly three times greater than that required
in the payment of tbe interest on all the 6
20's and other permanent Loans. So that it
is hoped thit the surplu3 Coin in the Treas
ury, at no distant day, will enable the United
States to resume specie payments upon a!I
liabilities.
The loan is called 5-20 from the fact tLal
whilst the Bonds may run for 20 years yet
the Government has a right to pay them off
in Gold at par, at any time after 5 years.
The interest is paid half-yearly, viz : On
the first days of November and May.
Subscribers can have Coupon Bouds, which
are payable to bearer, and are $50, $100.
$500, and $1,000 ; or Registered Bonds ef
same denominations, and in addition, $5,000
nd $10,000. For Banking purposes and for
investments of Trust-monies the Registered
Bonds are preferable.
These 5-20's cannot be taxed by States,
cities, towns, or counties, and the Governmen
tax on them is only one and a half per cent.,
on the amount of income, when the income
of the holder exceeds Six Hundred dollar
per annum ; all other investments, such M
income from Mortgages, Railroad Stock an1
Bonds, etc., must pay from three to five rr
cent tax on the income.
Banks and Bankers throughout the country
will continue to dispose of the Bonds ; ftudfci
orders by mail or otherwise promptly attend
ed to. . .
The inconvenience of a few days delaj
the delivery of the Bonds is unavoidable, tn
demand being so great ; but as interest com
mences from the day of subscription, no io
is occasioned, and every effort is beinff niao
to diminish the delay.
