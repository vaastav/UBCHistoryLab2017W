A STltAXGE STOltY.
The clear tones of tbe town clock
struck 9 . m I elosed my heavy ledger,
laid down my pen, lit a cigar and start
ed homeward.
It was a beautiful, clear November
night. The air was cool and invigorat
ing, the stars were out in all their glory,
and the mellow light of t he moon gave
the dull streets of the town - and Oma
ha is a dull enough town a weird and
romantic appearance. It was so s ill
that the crackling of the dry leaven,
as the sudden gnats of wind swept them
over the streets, Almost seemed p:iuful
to the ear. At that hour the streets in
the vicinity of my office w ere compara
tively deserted, and us I moved toward
the corner of Tenth nnd Farnam streets
' there wat nothing to break the silence
but t'-.ft sound of my own footsteps.
1J in a s I readied that corner l wan
artl.dto f ear coming toward me, as
from a distance, the rapil strokes of a
horse's feet clattering over the stones.
Nearer and nearer they came; until
they sw ept past me with the speed of
lightiug, going southward. Hut what
was my amazement when, although tho
sound of tho horse's feet shook tho
pavement on which I stood, and al
though. I could feel the rush of cold
wind as it swept by, the horse it-elf
was invisible to my eyes. It seemed
impossible that I should not see him in
the cleir, cold night, under the stars;
ind yet, wonderful as it may seem, I
could iMscern nothing whatever of the
c reature either before or a ter it passed
me!
Ilere was a mystery. I am anything
but superstitious, and immediate
ly beg in. to argue myself into the belief
that I had been deluded, but, in spite of
all the commonplaces that we console
y ourselves with iu case) of this kind, I
could not drive aw ay a strange and un
comfortable feeliug of nervousness that
was creeping over me. I determined to
step in and ask a friend, who lived close
by, if he had heard anything of this
mysterious horseman.
X. was a man apparently of high
,cntlture, who had traveled, ami always
seemed-to have plenty of money. .Ho
was at this timo about 40 years of nge,
tall, and of fine appearance, except that
he seemed erpetual:y 1 aunti'd by the
deepest melancholy. I understood that
he had experienced trouble in his youth,
but on this point he was very reserved,
and never let a w ord escape from w hich
we'iiiight obtain a clew to his past his
tory. He had been reading as I stepped
into lr's room in the hotel, but, noticing
my pale and troubled face, he laid down
his book and said: "You seem eicited,
George. Anything occurred to disturb
your serenity tof mind?"
-Well," I replied, "my dear X.t I have
such a strange story to tell that you'll
laugh at me sure. You know I'm not
snier.stitiousi, or nervous, and yet to
night I heard the strangesthark!
There it is a?ain," and I rushed to the
window, dragging him after me. Then
swept by the strange clatter of hoofs
which had before startled me, and died
away in the distance. Dread and as
tonish meut froze me to my place, and
an icy thrill of horror shot through my
veins.
Hut never did I see the face of man
change as did my friend's. His pale
and noble countenance seemed sudden
ly of n greenish hue, aud like two red
and glowing coals his eyes blazed under
contracted brows. "Myfatel my fate!"
he muttered, in a harsh and grating
tone, I cannot escape from thee thoft
followest me ever. Hut the grave will
soon shnt me from your sight, and
then our warfare will le ended!"
I was so agitated and shocked at
hearing these. words from him that I
sank down powerless ou a sofa.
He, seeing my distress, seemed sud
denly to recollect himself, and, going
to a small cuplxard, poured out a
glass of brandy, which he offered me.
Then, addressing me in an altered tone,
mournful, indeed, but calm, he told mo
the following st6ry : .
"George, my dear fellow," he began,
"I hare never told yon anything of my :
past life, but I eel now that the time j
has come. In a little while this voice
which is speaking to you will be still
forever. Nay, start not, I Lave no evil
design, but I kuow my fate. Now for
my story. In my youth I dwelt in a
city far away from here on the shores
of the Atlantic. It is unnecessary that
you should know any more of that.
My parents were wealthy. I was well
educated and received all that a young
man could demand. In time I met and
loved the lieuutiful Alice 11. She had
many admirers, but I seemed to be the
favored one. Hut among my rivals w as
one Henry Arlington, who had leeu
acquainted with my leloved ever since
they were children, and for a time I
feared he might le successful. 'Ah ! in
tho e days pride and jealousy tried my
whole being, and have now finally
brought me to ruin. 1 rememler that
when young Arlington and mys, If, hot
with fury, our eye blazing, were about
to fly at each oilier in the garden luck
of her house, she, w ho had in some way
heard of our quarrel, came down and
begged us, by the love we both pro-fe-sed
for her, to desist. Ah, my lost
one! why had I not always listened" to
her voice as then?
"Well, we were married, uud I was
the happiest man alive. Not a cloud
marred the serenity of my life, until
in one dav, in one moment came the iu
fernal spirit and blasted my happiness
forever. Returning one evening from
my business rather earlier thin usual,
as I was about to enter my gate, I swv
in a retired part of the garden my wife
and young Arlington. To describe
my emotions would be impossible. Oh,
how I had loved that woman, and now
it seemed she was - fait'. loss to me.
Where I stood, in the shade of u lar e
tree, 1 was unsien, but I could not
hear what they were saying. My first
impulse was to rush forward and dash
the man to the earth; butheseemd
about to leave her, so I waited. Vrev
ently they parted; beheld her hand a
long time, and I could see that her eyes
wer filled with tears. Arlington
turned down one of the sidewalks of
the garden, mounted his horse, which
was hitched there, and rode nwav
shwly, iu deep meditation. I could
see that my presence w as not suspected.
Like a tiger following his prey through
the jimy-ie. with eve ablaze and mv
whole being burning with rage and
hatred, I followed him. Enough : the
path led down by the river side, high
overarched with old aud mighty trees.
As he passed along in a lonely and se
cluded aot I leaped suddenly upon
him from behind, and, with the strength
of a madman, grasping his throat I
dragged him out of the saddle to the
ground. Over and over wo rolled in
desperate struggle. I had no weapon.
I might have strangled him, but at this
moment, getting one hand free, he drew
a small dagger aud made a lunge at me.
I felt the steel enter my left arm, but
the paiu w as nothing compared w ith my
Joy at seeing u weapon, vriilj Ui.il,
hands I tore it from him, stabbed him
again and again, and threw him into the
river.
"In a moment after the deed was
done the fearful thought of the crime
I had committed rushed over me. The
horse had fled in wdd terror during our
struggle: and, as he was a fplendid ani
mal and known to everybody, suspicion
would be aroused. The whole couutry
would be on the alert. I would be cap
tured and suffer au iguominious death.
Hut, alas! what had I to live for? She,
my love, my darling, was false to me.
I would leae her and this place for
ever. In tho darkness of the night I
fled, taking with me w hat money w as in
my office. N
"That place has seen my face no more.
I have wandered in many lands, over
the sands of Egypt, the deserts of
Persia, the wild steppes of Siberia.
Every capital of Europe I have visited.
All excitement, pleasure, dissipation,
I have tasted, but I cannot escape from
myself. Ten thousand eyes glare from
the heavens and denounce me for my
crime. Hefore my eyes two shadowy
forms for ever stalk and reproach me.
For ihe, alas, was innocent! In an un
guarded moment she had consentod to
his desiro that n last interview might
be granted before he started on a long
journey. In an evil hour 1 saw them
and slew him. The fearful news of the
murder and my flight soon reached her,
and, knowing my suspicions, grief
crazed her, and in two days she died.
Happy is she to find iu the grave the
rest I can never know !
"Hut this mysterious horsem in. One
night I was slowly walking up the
Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg
came this same strange clatter of hoofs.
Only to my ear it came then ; nolody
else heard it, and a voice cried to me,
'Twice more I come ami then thou
shall join, ?' 'Twas hi voice; 'twas
the clatter of his horse's hoofs as I had
heard them on that evil day so long ago.
"I fell on thrf p ivement and for many
weeks was delirious. Again in a se
cluded country road iu Eng'and one
wild Septemlier evening I met h"m and
he cried, 'Once more I come and then
thou shall join ?s.r And tiow, to-night
again, my dear friend, have w e seen him.
I feel that mv time has come."
With breathless attention I had
listened to this strange and terrible
story, and when he had finished wo
both remained with our eyes fixed on
the ground in silence. I was over
whelmed with such a whirl of emotions
that I could think of 'nothing to s.i , and
he seemed buried in bitter reverie, but
finally, raising his head, he said: "Let
us walk out; it seems so warm here I
conM fancy the walls were closing
around me." Again we walked out in
th clear night.
As we went along my companion
many a time raised his eyes to the skie
aud the stars. Then he turned aud
looked back at the river, glimmering in
the moonlight. We w ere on the grouud
near the high school build'ng when
suddenly he bade me stop aud listen.
"Hark!" said he, ".t is coming!" and
his face turned marble. As I gazed in
the same direction I saw coming tow ard
us in the dear moonlight a shadowy
steed with a spectral rider, whose face,
pule and stern, was fixed with stony
glare upou my companion, who returned
the look with one of despair and pride.
"Come!" slid the specter, in a voice
that froze my blood", as he grasped X.'
by the wrist.
I fainted.
"Surely I haven't slept here all night,"
said I, as I raised myself up, stiff and
weary, from the floor of my filee. Can
this all have been a dream? I hope so.
There is my chair upside down on tho
floor. I must have fallen out of it, and
laid here on this cold oilcloth all night;
and this has bred this horrible dream
in my imagination.
I went to the door. The morning
paper was there. Opening it, the first
thing I read was a notice headed in
large capitals, that made a tremor run
through my frame. My friend X.
had been found dead near the high
school grounds, with no mark of vio
lence on his person, except that round
his w rist were pressed the marks of fin
gers that had sunk nearly to the bone.

The rep- 1 1 of the Tariff Commission, says a
Washington telegram, is a great surprise, Isith
to the revenue-reformer and the protectionists.
Such extensive changes as are proposed were
not hojs-cl fi r by the former r feared by the
laltcr. The lange of reduction of '-u to .'si t
cent. on all articles which enter into consumption
was certainly not anticipated. Neither was it
expected that the commission would recom
mend a reduction ot duties on sugar of from 40
to ."si xi -cent., nor the use of the olarlscoc,
nor the admission of so many articles
to the tree list As a class the revenue-
eformeis are much better satisfied
w.t It the report, so tar as they understand it,
than t: e protectionists t,rc. It is believed at a
first glance at the suggestions of the commission
the they wid form a go d basis upon which to
pievl le for a thorough revision, uud that after
all it may ls at least said that the work of tho
much-ridiculed commission has not been value
less. 'J hey propose to alsjllsh com-Hjund duties
with a tew except ions They have revised the
custom-house legulatlons in aUiut a hundred
particulars, an I recommend tho alsilltton of all
tee, charges and commissions. The free list
Is exteude I by including many now articles,
sue 1 as wood-pulp, quinine, all dye extracts,
ci ude chemicils, and all gre n fruit except lern
ens oranges an t graM. 'i lie duty on these
fruits is miMldseclbc. They a bo ish compound
duties on iron 'ores and fix a specific dntv of 60
rents a ton They abolish all comt onnd duties
o 1 manufactured t bac.o and put a duty of $J
on tlgrs. cigarettes, etc. They prop, se to alsjl
lsh all compound duties on raw woo s, and
to make a reduction of about '"-j cents a pound
on medium tine wool, which includes the
class generally sheared by Western growers. On
manufactured woolen arilcles of lower grades
they have made large reductions. On cheat)
woolen blankets the tariff Is reduced about 60
percent. On barrel and sack salt the reductlm
Is from li to P) cen s per P, ami on salt In bulk
from s to 6 cents. Ou lumt er and cereals there
is ni change. On steel the reduction is heavy,
but Iron and steel are proportionately reduced,
except steul rails, which drop down from tiS
to $ls nr ton. Heel blooms are put at Jf cent
lcr pound. Medicinal preparations are reduced
from leu it cent, ad valorem to 4 ' js?r cent. All
compound duties on cottons are abolished and
the reduction I about ) jter c-ent. Anv single
tMMik or publication may come in free Really
made clothing is reduced alsiut one-third, and
carjs'ts alsjut one-fourth. The duty on Itooks is
reduced one-halt, and the duty on works of art
Is doubled. Fire-crackei s and playtng-c irds are
liureasel from M) to bs per cent, ad valorem. It
1 proKtsed to abandon the Dutch standard on
all grades of sugar below No. H and to use the
polarlscojw test, ami that the Dnti h standard
shall continue to lie used for all grades above
No PI. The geneial effect of this scheme would
be a reduction ou sugar.

tha Congress fails to r. ach an early agreement I

the Secretary s recommendation of immediate I
and extensive reduction. in the annual revenues
of the i overument. It will be letiicmbcred that
1 urged upon the utteiitlon of Congress at Its I

It 1 one of the trltest inalms'of political

there have always beea among our pc pie wide

the Hiiiplcs revenue amounted to tl i.ihw.inhi.
For the fiscal year ended on the iii'th or
i .lime las', the surplus was more than f U.,oou,immi.
) The reiKirt of tho Secretary shows what disposi
tion has been made of these moneys. They have
not only answered the requirements of the sink

plicable to other reductions ot the public debt.
Init 1 renew the expression of mv conviction
that such rapid extinguishment ot'the national
Indebtedness us is now taking place i by no
means a cause for congratulation.- It is a cause,
rather, for serf on apprehension. If it continues,
It must pjicedily Isj followed bv one of the evil
result so clearly set forth in the rt jsti t of the
fccctetary. Illther th surplus must lie Idle In
the treasury, or the Government will be
forced to buy, at market rates, its bonds,
not then redeemable, nmj which, under
such circumstances, cannot fail to com
mand an em Tin ms picmlimi, or the swol en
revenues will Is? devoted to extravagant rxpend
It ite, which, us experience has taught is ever
the ban ? ot an overflowing treasury. It was
made appurent li the course of the animated dis
cussions which the question aroused at tho last,
session of Congress that the policy of diminish
ing the tevenue by reducing taxation command
ed the general approval of themembeisof both
house. 1 regret, that, liecanso or conflicting
views a to the Is-st methods by which that pol
icy should be made o; e atlve, none of Its bene
fit have a et been leaped. In tulllllmnnt of
I what I deem my const It ut ional duty, but w i: h i
iime nojs? mat i can in ike a valuable contilbu- j sire, aud making suitable provision for theedu
tlon to this vp.ed question, I shall pioceed I cation of Indian youths.
b.timate biiclly my own view In relation to It : I President Arthur d vo:es considerable sjwn
v l-wii i iiv iinomim ui our tinilli'lill eoMUll l"ll i
at the close or Ihe la-t fiscal year 1 felt justified
m reeommen.iing to i on gross tlie aiolit Ion ol
in'emul-ieventie taxes except th me upon tobiu co
in rs various torni t and upon distilled spirt s
and fermented lienors, and except, nlso, the
spe-bi tax US)U the manufacturers and denier
in such articles. I venture now to suggest that,
unless p, shall be ascertained that the probable
expenditure of tho (iovcrnment for the coming
e.ir have lHen nnderestlniated, all Internal
taxes save those which relate to ibstilled spirits
can be prudently abrogated. Huch a course, ir
acc inp.tuled by a slmjilitlcatlon of thn ma
chiiierv of collection, which would then be
easy of accomplishment, ni'ght reasonably be
t-xjected to result iu diminishing the cost
of such collection by at least two million
nnd a half, and in the retirement from office
or from l.v o to J.iH-i iKTs.-ms. The svstom of
excise duties ha never commended itself to the
faverof the American eople, ami has never
i.een n-vorte.i to except for supo ylng uellcien-
el" in the treasury, when, bv reason of ssclal
ehreii( .-s, the duties on Imports have proved
t'trtnij.t for the needs of the (Jovernment.
1 1 sentiment of the country doubtless com.
man. Is that the present excise tax shall be
nK'Hsneu as a sm as such course can safely In?
1 "r '"' It seems to nte, however, fcr various
reasons, so sweeping a measure as tbe total abo-
lition t f Internal taxes woul I, for the pr sent,
l eannuwlse step. Two of thee reason are
