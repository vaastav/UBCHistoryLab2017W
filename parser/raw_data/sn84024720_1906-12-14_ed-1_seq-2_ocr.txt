AUGUSTA AND JAMESTOWN.
It is to be regretted that Augusta
county, the richest aud most prosper
ous county in the State, bas not set an
example to the other oouuties of the
State by making a special exhibit at
Jamestown, and one worthy of the
county. It is needless to recall thai
when tbe Jamestown Exposition was
first talked of, we opposed it tooth and
nail. We looaed on it then as the
shrewd act of some land boomers in
Norfolk, and we could not bring our
selves to countenance the scheme In
any phase. Wbeu Virginia gave $200,
--000 to it we believed aud said that this
was, in our opinion, a gross violation
of good government.and a wilful waste
of the people's money. We thought
it would prove a fake aud a failure
But the enterprise has broadened, and
under the guidance and fostering care
of strong and clean ineo.bas expanded
into a national enterprise, and no mat
ter now what the original promoter*
may have had in mind, nor what the}
may reap from H, it is a stupend
ous affair, growing in might, and pow
er, and beauty every day, and is the
first aud only real National advertise
ment of tbe arts of peace, Virginia hat
ever had. This enterprise has carried
tbe name of Virgiuia to the lour cor
ners of the earth. The navies of the
world will be assembled there, antl
these can only come by consent of the
heads of their governments, and these
heads never knew poshibly that Vir
ginia existed prior to this time, and
especially did some of them possiblj
not know that iv her bosom was rocked
tne infant nation, which has grown in
strength until In a few brief years it
has become the Nation, of the Nations.
People who never trod Virginia's soil
nor heard her name before, will be
there to study her wajs, and be wise
It is remarkable, therefore, since we
now see the advantages this exposition
is bringing to Virginia, that her coun
ties have not systematically gone to i
Wi/iu. ' ■■■:■' '>W «'hi -■■ the J vlU'iUUt to I
la the Slate. Had beaded a j
movement of this kind her lnagnib' j
cence might have been spieau befoie
the gathered multitudes—not possibly
as the Queen of Sheba's wealth before
Solomon, but the field and tbe factory
would have had at least an opportuni
ty which will not now be accorded
them. Augusta could for a sum our
people would never have felt, placed
her exhibits before the world in a way
■be has never done before, aud in a way
she will never have an opportunity of
doing again. It 16 useless to advertise
where no one sees. The rainbow is
set in the heavens, had it been set in
the earth who would have beheld it?
Tne sun runs his course, his path
high in limitless space, and thus are
his life giving rays shed upon the my
riads of dwellers in innumerable
worlds. Were his orbit circumscribed
within narrow limits his life givir.g
influences would likewise be limited.
Even of men it if said —they do uot
light a candle aud place it under a
bushel, but upon a candlestick. Here
is the candlestick, here the place that
we should have let our light so shine that
others seeing our good works might go
and do likewise. But by a mistaken
policy we are shutting our eyes to our
best opportunity either to thin, the
world who and what we p.re, or to
Show our brethren who have gone to
other lands what an Eidorado tbey
have left behind, thus inducing otheis
to come, if we may not entice those
who have gone away, to come back
again, to our limpid water«,our fertile
valleys, and our blue acd benultful
mountains.
A BAU MIXUP.
A most uuusual controversy has
arisen between the President and Mr.
Bellamy Stent who was Ambassador
to the court of Austro-Hungary, but
who for his indescretiuo in meddling
with the affairs of the Catholic chuich
in tr) iug to aid Archbishop lieland in
his aspirations to be a cardinal, tbe
President was obliged to remove him.
Mrs. Scorer, who seen.s to be a lady
not lacking in what in men would be
called 'cheek," and whose lntiiii ,tcy
with the President led both her and
her husband to presume that tbey had
a certain propreitary right in the
piesioenl, and Mr. Storer have
within a few years b.ck beet me
ardent Catholics It is ntedliss
to say more, this explains the
situation. They did as new converts
do, became over zealous. The I'.tsi
dent was at last forced to recall Mr-
Storer. The Storers are mad. Mr.
Storer has now issued a pamphlet giv
ing many private letters of the Presi
dent and purporting to give conversa
tions also. We are sorry to see Mr.
Roosevelt mixed in the affair, but for
once, if never again, the President bas
done the right thing in dismissing
Bellamy Storer, though be did wrong
to have ever allowed himself to get
mixed in tbe affnir at all. In his great
praise for Aicnbishop Ireland he was
simply playing politics.
I m *
Uncle Bam explains tbe proposed in
crease in the salaries of members of
Congress, by the fact that nearly all of
the big corporations are doing the
gxine thing.
Washington papers say that Secre
tary Leslie M. Shaw has found a near
wiy to the While House. It has long
been apparent Ibat if Leslie got there
it would be bj some short cut. i
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Tbe message of the President to
(•ongress is a most remarkable paper I
To our mind is displays en unpardon I
able ignorance of tbe fundamental :
principles of this government, and is -
such a paper as King Edward would <
not have sent to Parliament, nor the
Emperor William to the Reichstag,
and one we hardly believe, the Czar
would have sent to any civil body in
his domains, a Duma or any other.
He labored over lynching to tbe ex
tent of a thousand or more words. He
ha-: no more to do with lynching—nor
has the Federal government—than it
has to do with the ordinary robbing
ot a hen roost.
He wants the public schools supplied
with a shooting galley, su all children
will learn to shoot. Where did he get
authority for such rot '( He might as
well have suggested tbe color of the
school houses, and demanded that tbey
he painted with the stars and stripes
on the outer walls, and with battleship
colors within, inter larded with noted
paintings of great conflicts.
He threatens California with all the
forces "military aud civil" which he
can bring to bear—putting military
first —to compel proper recognition of
treaty rights due the Japanese.
He wants Congress to give the presi
dent power to dismiss officers from the
army and navy when he shall deem
them unworthy. This is such a step
toward centralization as was never
contemplated and iv the minds of most
people should never be accorded.
He would take nearly all power from
Congress and bestow it on tbe cxc cv
tive and thus set up a dictator, if not
a Czar.
We will not undertake to discuss all
of the alarming features of such a
message, and tbe dangerous character
of such an executive, but we do say
tbat beside bis utterances all utteran
ces of Wm. J. Bryan are as the placid
surface of a lake to a tempest torn
ocean. No man has before been ele
vated to the high office of the presi
dency who so regarded the cilice, or
who had such contempt for constitu
tional rights. He has never studied
that instrument, he has never, it
seems, gone over the Federalist nor
tbe early debates, and seen what were
the controlling influences which led to
the formation of this compact, but he
treats the government as it it were a
plaything in his hands, to be used,
handled, and shaped to suit his own
sweet will. Nothing to our mind has
ever so clearly shown the fact that it
is the fixed purpose of Mr. Koosevelt
to be me next Republican candidate
for the presidency, as this message.
No man ever advocated such unbridal
ed powers unless he himself expected
to wield them. Just as we are slow to
plant vineyards and build houses for
those who come after us, when we our
selves kuow our days are numbered,
and that we have passed tbe period of
three score years aud ten. Just as we
are slow to laj up r'ebes when we
know not who shall galutr them, so
will uot a president ask for power
which can only he conferred on others,
aud especially when such power would
be dangerous except in tbe bauds of
conservative, careful, wise, patriotic,
and most judicious chief magistrates.
It is patent that what Mr. Roosevelt
asks for himself he would not readily
give to others. If he were in the Sen
ate and some one else in the president
ial chair we believe be would be among
tbe first to withhold many, if not all,of
tbe powers he desires now conferred
upon the president, for his own pecu
liar personal enforcement or use.
He calls the navy and army "our
safeguards for peace," when as a mat
ter of fact they are the very opposite,
they are our most dangerous posses
sions. We cannot maintain peace by
aweing other people. He bas this idea
bred in him and it is on a par witn
many of his wild and erratic notions,
(ioliah's size did not save him from
David's sling, nor will our army and
navy save us from attack if we give
offense, no matter what their size. For
about one hundred years no enemy has
attacked us either on the Atlantic or
Pacific coast, and we have had no ter
rifying navy. We are less likely to be
at tacked on the Atlantic coast now
than ever before, but not on account
oi the number and size of our battle
ships. We are, however, not quite so
sate on the Pacific coast, but this
comes not from a weakness in our
navy, but from a most unwise if not a
criminal seiziug of the lands of others,
certainly from a most degrading and
dastadly departure from the steps of
our forefathers. The president, how
ever, sniffs blood, certainly powder,
he wants shooting taught in schools.
A3 he had learned it, he profited by it
wheu tbe poor Spaniard was fleeing
for his life. He exercised in the re.
cent Spanish war bis early training
received in the far west, where the re
volver and tbe Winchester rifle were
bis companions. Had be not learned
to shoot so early and readily of course
be might not be now able to pride him
self upon so great an accomplishment
in the art of war, and so rare an
achievement as having secured at least
one scalp.
Government of railways is mild stuff
beside that which has just been spout
ed to Congress 1 This is "hot stuff,"
this is calculated to make the average
statesman catch his breath and wonder
where "we are at." Almost anybody
can see a Monarch iv the not distant
future, stepping upon the throne now
building by this titular dignitary, who
undertakes to revolutionize all teach
ings and trample under foot the con
stitution,aud its attendant safeguards.
A 6001) TRUST WANTED.
It is said there are good trusts and
bad trusts. Even the president in his
recent message has intimated that
such an animal as the good trust could
be iouud in the gang. But we notice
that no one has ever put his linger on
that animal, or been able to point him
out to visitors. Not on» single trust
that has ever yet been inspected has
been able lo show that it bore this pc
culiar marking, and when one of tbe
kind known as the "good trust" is '
found, it ;s safe to say tbat all tbe side
shows will be seeking it.to add to their 1
"freak collection." ]
Sight now Mr. Joe Bailey is having j
a check-ered career. •,
PLUCKIWG THE 0009. t
It may seem strange that when alt
bill w»s offered iv Congress last week j t
to increase the salaries of onr Senators '■
and Representatives lo $7.51X1, there
whs not one of all the stalwarts, not t
one ot all the Treasury watch clogs \
who would open his mouth against it. j
But then it is not so strange when we
look at it from an unbiased and un- •
prejudiced standpoint. Do they uot i
worK constantly to make fortunes tut l
others, then why not for themselves 't ,
Tne poor Congressmen who started iv ]
I,t«* in many iusiances possibly ou 50 i
cent" a day, cannot look placidly or ]
pitieutly ou men wearing aprons who ,
hammer in hand, are daily pounding t
out morn money than those who forge I
national thought. They canuot bear
to see men with picks turning up the ,
shining pebles which make them mil- i
liouaires, when those who delve in '
musty touies aud search for the wis- '
dom which is to guide them in push
ing the course of Empire in the proper
direction, are getting the paltry sum
of $5,000. Not enough they find ou
reaching Washington to pay for decent
quarters ou Massachusetts Avenue*
North West, or aiound Dupont Circle.
This is unbearable. A man who
starts on 50 cents a day when he rises
iv the world wants soup hoc out of the
ladle. Those who began lite with silver
spoon in their mouths if any of them
have ever reached Congress—which
of course is very seldom—have not the
heart to hold their aspiring brethren
back, aud especially when they face
that awful word, Demagogue, in so
doing. There is an awkward uncouth
bird inhabiting some of the distant
South iSea Islands which has short
wings unfit with which to fly. Clumsy
feet, and cannot run. This bird Is
called a Dodo. Its value consists only
in its feathers; it is easily caught and
easily plucked. Uucle Csain is of the
Dodo vaiiety. When his own guar
dians begin to snatch the down, it is
easy tv see how soon be may be pluck
cd. But who, when he is starving,
will not pluck ripe fruit. Who, when
he wants a downy bed, will not take
feathers from a Dodo t
Danville, Va., bas indicted her coal
and wood dealers, it being proven that
there was an agreement between them
that they would only sell at a certain
fixed price. When the Western State
Hospital advertised for bids for coal
this year, and the same has been the
case for years, there were only four
bids and they were exactly the same.
There may be no arrangement of terms
between these companies, but the fact
that they all offer to supply the coal at
exactly the same figures is such strong
circumstantial evidence of an agree
ment, as would put the burden of prov
ing there is no agreement on the per
sons offering the commodity.
It now seems certain that Thomas F.
Ryan, John D. .Rockefeller, Jr., and
others, have bought out King Leop
old's Congo Fiee State rubber trade.
We learn that Leopold's slave drivers
were accustomed to cut off the arms j
or legs of those who did not bring in
their due quota of rubber. W hat the j
new owners will do is not certain in I
cases of this kind, but if the natives !
are on a par with many of our people
at home, and if these magnates are
really after rubber, the natives would
not only be compelled to give up their
legs and arms, but their necks also.
If all the big corporations increase
the pay of their employee, United
States Senators need not worry over
the proposed increase in their salaries.
That "the laborer is worthy of his
hire" will receive an awful jar when
Congressmen increase their salaries lo
$7,500.
Tbe Bellamy Storers have learned
that in the game of diplomacy, it is
poor playing to swap a King for a
Bishop.
WASHIN6TON LETTER
(From our Keuular correspondent.]
Washington, D. C , Dec. 8.
Many bills are being introduced in
Congress every day, but there are
only a few of them of real national iv
teres! One of the most important,
and which stands a possibility of pass
ing at the present session, is that Ly
Representative Perkius of New York,
embodying the ideas of the President
on tbe inheritance tax. This bill is
not very drastic, but is drawn with
an idea of withstanding the scrutiny
of the Supreme Court. In provides
for a tax ou all legacies of $25 000 or
over. The amount assessed varies
with the closeness of kin between the
testator and legatee. la case of a
direct descendant, a brother, sister,
husband or father, the tax will be
only 75 cents in every $100 on the
minimum amount named, this tax in
creases as the consanguinity dimmish
es, and in the case of a legacy to
strangers it amounts to $5 00 in every
|100. On the other hand there is a
sliding scale, which increases tbe tax
ation as the legacy increases, so that
in the case of legacies of $30,000,000
or over the tax would amount to one
quarter of the bequest itself.
Provision for the collection of the
taxis made through the Bureau of;
Internal Revenue. In the case of
estates over $1,000,000 in value, the
executors are given three years, if de
sired, in which to settle the taxes.
The deferred taxes will draw interest
at the rate of 6 per cent,but the object
of the delay is to prevent sacrificing
real estate or securities by throwing a
large amounts immediately on the
market. The question of an income
tax has not yet been broached, but it
is understood that a bill to this end
will be Introduced a little later in the
session.
An elastic currency bill is now be
ing drawn, it is underrtood, under the
direction of Sentor Aldrich's com
mittee. This measure will emboay
the recommendations that were agreed
on at the recent meeting of the Cur
rency Commission in this City. These
provisions were fully discussed at the
time.
News has been received at the War
Department of the receut fight in
Leyte, in the Pbillipines, in which tbe
American troops were badly cut up by
an outfit of liolo men. This is one of
tbe liviiest fights tbat the War De
partment has had to record in the past
two yean. The insurgents were not
really insuneetors at all, but rather a
stronger band than usuai of the Lad
rones who infest, many of ihe islai ds.
Some of them were armed with guns,
but all had the deadly bolos, in the
use of which the natives are very ex
pert. They fired a volley at the troops
and then rushed them with the sword,
killing five before they were finally dis
persed. Several of the soldiers who
escaped death werebadlv injured, but
tbe encounter is one which is not like
ly to be repeated again very Soon The
Puljanes, the robber organization
which infested the island of Samar,

terest of the Convention extends to all

to have made a dead set in favor of tie •
proposition for a deep wateway canel
between the Great Lakes and the Gulf
of Mexico. The interest of the con
vention in this measure was indicated
by the fact that 15 out, of the 20. lustra i
elected were from the region inside
the Mississippi watershed. Such a
deep waterway would take advantage j
in a large part of tbe Mississippi Biver
itself, but there would be a very large
amount of Canal work necessary in
