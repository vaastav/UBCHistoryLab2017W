THE PRESIDENT'S
ANNUAL MESSAGE
TO CONGRESS
LABOR UNREST AND HIGH
COST OF LIVING IS
DISCUSSED.
General Recommendation for
Return of the United States
To Peace Basis.
Washington.—General recommenda
tions on legislation to combat the cost
of living, labor unrest, radicalism and
a readjustment of the nation to peace
time basis were the features of Presi
dent Wilson s annual message to con
gress, delivered Tuesday.
The peace treaty, the president told
congress, will be discussed iu a sepa
rate message later, as will the ruilroad
question.
For the second time only since the
president established the practice of
addressing congress in person his mes
sage was read today by the clerks.
The president's principal recommen
dations were:
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem, with simplification of the income
and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system,
if necessary, to meet changed world
conditions and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
States is "the greatest capitalist in the
world."
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war, particularly
In the way of government farms, as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the war
to keep the United States independent
of foreign supply.
An enlarged program for rural de
velopment, in recognition of the farm
ers' part in the war.
Measures which "will remove the
causes of political restlessness in our
in
a
Is
a.
causes of political restlessness in our
body politic."
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the causes for the
unrest "art superficial rather than
deep-seated," and that they "arise
from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a just and permanent
peace, permitting return to normal con
ditions, from the transfusion of radical
theories from seething European cen
ters pendi»g such delay from heartless
profiteering, resulting from the in
crease of the cost of living, and lastly
from the machinations of passionate
and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal conditions
this unrest will rapidly disappear.
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods will abrogate our time
tested institutions."
Several recommendations, some re
: newals of previous ones, were made
by the president to bring down the
. cost of living. Among them were ex
tension of the food control law to peace
times for the emergency; regulations
for transportation of foods in inter
state commerce; a coal storage law
modeled after the law in New Jersey;
a law requiring markets to show the
length of time foods are kept in stor
age, and a law to secure "competitive
selling and prevent unconscionable
profits" by federal license of corpora
tions selling food in Interstate com
merce.
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
program to bring about an Improve
ment in the conditions of labor" and
bring about a genuine democratization
of industry" was recommended.
"The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re
move grievances," said the president's
message. Another point it declared,
"the seed of revolution Is repression."
"The establishment of the princi
ples regarding labor laid down in the
covenant of the league of nations,"
said the message, "offers us the way
to Industrial peace and conciliation.
No other road lies open to us. ...
Governments must recognize the right
of men to bargain collectively for
humane objects. . . Labor must
no longer be treated as a commodity."
"The right of Individuals to strike
Is inviolate," continued the message,
"and ought not to be Interfered with
by any process of government, but
there is a predominant right and that
is the right of the government to pro
tect all of its people and to assert Its
powers and majesty against the chal
lenge of any class."
The president was referring te the
government's recent injunction against
the coal strike.
The message closed with a pointed
reference to radicalism and red doc
trines and referred to "Russia today
with its blood and terror" as a "pain
ful object lesson of tha power of
minorities."
MR. DODSON WARNS
USERS OF CALOMEL
Says Drug Acts Like Dynamite on
Liver and You Lose a Day's
Work.
There's no reason why a person
should take sickening, salivating calo
mel when a few cents buys a large bot
tle of Dodson's Liver Tone—a perfect
substitute for calomel.
It Is a pleasant, vegetable liquid
which will start your liver just as sure
ly as calomel, but it doesn't make you
sick and can not salivate.
Children and grown folks can take
Dodson's Liver Tone, because it is per
fectly harmless.
Calomel is a dangerous drug. It is
mercury and attacks your bones. Take
a dose of nasty calomel today and you
will feel weak, sick and nauseated to
morrow. Don't lose a day's work. Take
a spoonful of Dodson's Liver Tone in
stead and you will wake up feeling
great. No more biliousness, constipa
tion, sluggishness, headache, coated
tongue or sour stomach. Y"our drug
gist says if you don't find Dodson's
Liver Tone acts better than horrible
calomel your money is waiting for you.

MAKE SOME SAD HEART GLAD
Christmas the Time for Remembering
Those Not as Fortunate
as You Are.
Christmas Is a sad time in some
households, among the older members
who miss familiar faces always asso
ciated with family gatherings—a list
of missing ones which increases as the
years go by. But if it is impossible
to be happy one's self, it is always pos
sible to make some one else rejoice—
this is an easier task than some people
imagine. So many are so foolish as to
think that because they cannot give
beautifully that it is not worth while
to give at all. They forget that what
seems very little to a person In com
fortable circumstances may appear
very large to those who have virtually
nothing at all; while among friends a
small gift, bearing some sign of
thoughtfulness, is often more accepta
ble than a costly but ill-chosen pres
ent. This is an excellent time to go
over the children's toys and select
those which can be spared to go to
some less fortunate little ones. Do
not select only those which are too
battered to be recognizable; such, of
course, are not to be despised, but a
little glue and a few stitches to fresh
en up a broken doll or torn book add
much to the pleasure of a second-hand
gift—for all children love fresh-looking
tilings and it is, besides, scarcely gen
erous to give away only ruch articles
as would otherwise be thrown iu the
ashes.
WHERE SANTA WAS BORN
Russian Legend of Saint Klaus and
How He Came to Be Known as
the Children's Friend.
Very many years ago there lived In
Russia a nobleman and his wife, who
had a little son named Klaus. He was
such a good boy that everyone used to
j call him Sglnt Klaus. In course of
time bis parents died and left him u
large fortune, not the least part of
which was three large bars of gold.
Saint Klaus one day happened to be
passing a house, and overheard a
father telling his daughters that he
had lost all his money, and that he
didn't even know how he was going
to nuy food for them. This worried
Saint Klaus very much, and he won
dered how he could help them. So
that night he took one of the bars of
j gold and threw It through the window.
The next night he threw the second
hnr, and crept quietly away, but on
j the third night when he was about to
\ throw the third bar, the man who
had lost all his money came out and
caught him. He tried to thank Saint
Klaus for bis goodness to him and his
daughters, but Saint Klaus told him
to pay bis thanks to God, whose serv
ant he was.
And there, boys nnd girls, you have
the story of Saint Klaus (or Santa
Claus as we call him).
