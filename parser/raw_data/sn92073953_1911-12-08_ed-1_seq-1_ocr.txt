RESIDENT'S
MESSAGE
ON FOREIGN RELATIONS-LAUDS
ARBITRATION TREATIES AND
DEPLORES
TALIAN TURKISH WAR
. Washington, D. C, Dec. 7. Peace
is the keynote of President Taft's
message on foreign, relations, which
was sent to Congress today. After
calling attention to the fact that the
United States is at present on the
most cordial terms with all the oth
er world powers. President Taft lauds
the arbitration treaties, which this
country has negotiated with France
and Great Britian and expresses the
sincere hope that the- Senate will
ratify them at once.
Upon the topic of "Arbitration,'
the President has the following to
Kay: "The year .just passed marks
an important general movement on
tie part of the Powers for broader
arbitration. In the recognition of the
laanifold benefits to mankind in the
extension of the policy of the settle-
taent of international disputes by ar-
bitration rather than by war and In
TMnnnoo t Q wirto snrMd Hfimand for
a advance in that direction on the
part of the people of the United
States and of Great Britain and of
Tvonno th tprms of which were de-
signed, as expressed in the preample
4riaa n Ovton,i th scone
and obligations of the policy ofar-
bitrations adopted in our present
ilh thpsf! erovernments. To I
tho v for this t.reatv with
ttt,uoH stat-- Grat Britain nego-
4v?an imnnrtiint inndiflcation in its
alliance with Japan, and the French
government also expedited the nego-
Satioiis-with signal good will. The
new treaties have been submitted to
xv. a oiH.r Uo jifi-
vice and consent to their ratification.
AH the essentials of these important
treaties have long been known and
it is my earnest hope that they wi
receive prompt and favorable action.'
The message contains the first of
ficial explanation of the movement of
-tritL Qtafoc trnnns alone the Mex-1
iMn tmnlAr at the' time of the Mad
ero revolution in Mexico. The Pres
ident stated that advices from Henry
Lane Wilson, United States Ambassa-
dor at Mexico City, indicated that the
situation in Mexico was much graver
than press dispatches implied. Fear-
ing for the lives of the 40,000 Amer-
icans in Mexico, Mr. Taft "took i
pnnd deal of responsibility," as Ik
ybrased it, and ordered out the sol- J
diers and war ships. At the same i
time President Taft notified President j
TMa of Mexico, that no alarm need I
be felt as the troops were to be used I
-wily to enforce neutrality and to pre- J
vent the shipment of arms across tneitneir nomes.
Rio Grande from the American side I The greater part of Southern China
"It seemed my duty," said Mr. Taft -
"to But troops where, if Congress har
directed that they enter Mexico, ef-1
fective movement could have been I
made promptly." I
President Taft declared that the j
presence of the troops had a good ef- J
feet. He further explained that the I
restraint of the United States gov-
ernment, oven after casualties had
resulted from bullets fired aci-oss the
international line, was not due to a
lack of force but a desire to avoid
intervention. . v
The friendship of the United States
with Mexico is now closer than ever,
the message says. Touching upon the
anti-Madero' revolution, inaugurated
by' Gen Bernardo Reyes, who was ar-
rested by the Federal authorities for
Blnttine an insurrection against a
friendly power on United States soil,
the President declared that this coun
try was merely following out a policy
of respecting the contemporaneous
recognized constitutional authority in
Mexico.
President Taft also voiced his plea
sure that war had been probably
averted by the United States in act
ing as mediator in- a boundry dispute

The message deplores the war be
tween Italy and Turkey but it was
with satisfaction that Mr. Taft ex
called attention to the fact that it
could in no wise embroil the United
States.
Attention is called to the work of
the opium commission now sitting at
the Hague which Is trying to c.
traffic in dangerous drugs and it is
pointed out that the trade of, the
United States is constantly growing.
Exports of the United States, for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, were
over $2,000,000,000, a gain of $300,
"000,000 over those of the previous
year.
President Taft says there is a cry
ing need for an American merchant
marine and again asks Congress to
grant a subsidy that a merchant ma
rine service may be built up. "
Broke It Up Here.
Lynchburg, Va., Dec. 7. L. C. Ar
thur, a planter, while returning home
from marketing a load of tobacco here
yesterday was held up and robbed by
two masked men when about five
miles from the city. After taking $14C
from Arthur the highwaymen told him
to drTve fast, and when he started
four shots were fired at him. Arthur
thinks the men were negroes. Later
the highwaymen were trailed by blood
hounds to the street car terminus and
it is evident they were Lynchburg
negroes.
We copy the above from a Lynch
burg paper concerning the robbery of
a planter near that place. A few years

ATTEND
THE GOOD ROAD DEMONSTRATION
BY THE COAST LINE-ROAD
DESERVES CREDIT
FOR ITS ENTERPRISE
As -advertised the Good Roads train
of the Atlantic Coast Line rolled in
to the station this morning and at
the appointed hour the party in
charge thereof repaired to the Amuse
You Theatre where the meeting was
opened by an interesting lecture by
one of the experts in charge in which
he demonstrated in roads of every de
scription. He told of many places
where decided improvement was due
entirely to the building of good roads
which were before almost impassible.
Good roads were iollowea by im
provements in business, educational.
religion, etc., both in the city end in
rural districts. Before he ended !is
talks he had convinced everyone
present not only of the advantige,
but the necessity of good road .
Immediately after the lecture, a
number oi . stereopti om views were
thrown upon the canvr.s of roads in
every section of-the United States,
before and after improving, each pic
ture telling a story of the way ' in
which the respective communities
were benefitted. The I speaker at the
same time told a short but interest
ing story of each picture.
In reference to the building of
good roads in this section the speak
er stated that they could be built
and kept in good order in this sec
tion at less expense than in any oth
er section of the state.
He stated further that it was not
necessary to build macadam .roads
that sand clay roads would give the
same service and that it would . be ja
matter of-going only a few steps from
the road to secure the material Af
ter they were built, he said, all that
would be necessary would be to keep
them in order with the split-Jog drag,
and that the cost of the up keep
would be only a trifle.
As a general rule, sand clay roads
are built on sandy foundations and
tt is the usual practice to put the
clay on the unimproved foundation
but better results will be obtained if
the sandy foundation ig" given a slight
crown. This makes the center from
four to six inches higher than the
side ditches. If this is not done, more
clay will be necessary to give the road
the needed crown and that is expen
sive, especially if the material has to
be hauled a considerable distance
The process is as follows:
The road is covered with from four
o six inches of clay and worked
with a - disk or tooth harrow until
thoroughly mixed, first dry and -fi
nally wet. The final mixing should
be done, if possible, during rainy
weather. When the mixing has been
done, the surface is brought to
crown with the road machine or split
log drag and covered with a thin lay
er of sand. After two or three rains
it may be necessary to apply anoth
er sand coat. This method produces
a smooth, cheap and satisfactory road
suitable for light traffic.
Similar results can be obtained by
adding sand to a clay road and pro
viding good surface drainage. When
building a good clay foundation, it is
advisable to plow the clay before add
ing the sand in-order to insure a1
thorough mixing.
After these had been shown and
explained the entire assembly was
invited to the demonstration cars,
and almost every man in the houso
went where the various models were
shown, all of them being operated by
electricity generated by a gasoline
engine in the baggage car.
Owing to the fact that the views
were shown in the theatre, the sterop-
ticon car was not used and the crowd
next assembled to the demonstrating
ar. where the various models of ma
chinery and roads were explained ful
ly.
To-see these tiny machines running
doing the same work that the larger
ones do, only on a smaller scale, was
to thif car was well worth com
exceedingly interesting and the visit
to this one car was well worth com
ing miles to see.
