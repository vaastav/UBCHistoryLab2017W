Chicago News: Tbe Kansas City
Times Is criminally silent upon two im
portant topics, the election of a Repub
lican congressman In its Democratic
district and the tact that the Democratic
candidate for governor of Missouri ran
80,000 votes behind bis ticket. But,
we are reliably informed, the Times is
wholly .occupied nowadays making up
incidental cabinets and building a bot
tomless foundation for its new office In
the prehistoric quicksands of the old

According to tbe November report of
the department of agriculture corn the
product of tbe country is some what in
excess of 1,800,000.000 bushels. This is a
fraction over 86 bushels per acre. As in
1888, tbe bret yield was in what was once
known as the Great American desert.
The rata product of Nebraska was gen
erally 88.5; Kansas, 88; Iowa, 35; Mis
souri, 84; Minnesota, 88 5; Ohio, 81; Ill
inois. 80; Indiana, 20; Michigan, 27;
Wisconsin, 24 5; Kentucky, 23; Pacific
' Cost returns yield thirty-three bushels;
J in Washington Territory and California,
80; Oregon, 28. The southern stales re-
J port a field of 23 bushels in Maryland,
20 In Tennessee, 19 In Arkansas. 18 in
' Virginia, 15 In Texas. 13 in Mississippi
: and Alabama, 12.8 in Louisiana, 11 in
Georgia, and leas in other atates. The
New England atatea average nearly 83
bushels. New York returns 80 and
Pennsylvsnls 81. The quality of corn
is better than In 1883 nearly everywhere,
. and la tha northern btlt is worth 25 to
" 75 per cent more.
Benator Dawes In tbe discussion yes
terday on tbe leasing of lands by Indian
tribes In the territory, touched an lm
portent point when be alluded to tbe
fencing of public lands by private par
ties without authority ol law. Among
the facta he staled waa that of one tract
of 12.000 acres of Indian lands, 8,500
acres were in the exclusive possession of
outsiders, whose herds consumed every'
thing which grew on it, while tbe Indl
an bureau bad been obliged to advertise
for beef to support tbe Indians on whose
reservations these herds were feeding
Had the Indiana used tbe reservation
for themselves they would support them
, selves. In one instance tbe Indiana bad
In one year sold 17.000 bushels of wheat
from a reservation now occupied almost
entirely by private individuals, without
any power ou the part ol the govern
meat, to disposal ss such individuals.

centered largely lo the closing record of
the Forty-elgbth congress, especially In
view ot the change la the political atti'
tude of the nation brought about by tbe
recent presidential election. That this
session will effect any Importantchangee

able, both from tbe 'character
of the body itself, and be
cause tbe prospective incoming of a new
admlalsuatiou will have the two-fold ef
fect of loading members to give especial
attention to their personal political in
terests, and at the same txne increasing
the disposition to wait and aee what man
ner of event lime will bting forth under
the new regime. That the present con.

gratulation. The Forty eighth coogress bss a larger

political campaign, being the last of his
annual recommendations of public meat
us to la aational legislature, and the
last of twenty-four year of Republican
rule prior to. a change In tha political
character or the administration, ha been
awaited with ahusual interest." aad bis
statements as to tbe condition ot the
government aad suggestion a to needed
legislation will reeeiT more than or.
dinary attention. .Tha message is ho
disappointment; but as a comprehen
sive, statesmanlike and dignified docu-
ment la In full harmony with the unob
trusively efficient thoogh conservative
character ol hit administration, and fit
uogiy marks the completion of an hon
orable, wta and faithful executive ca
reer. I Be Condition of the several da.
pertmenta of government as indicated la
uie message, and tha nr.n
harmonious administration of all may
well be a mat er of national congratula
tion, and tbe shaping of matters of pub
lic policy under Republican rule has
been such that the party, on lU retire
ment from power, in the general pros
perity or tbe government may find its
assured vindication of thegoveinmen
tai principles which it hat ettabl-thtd
and to which It baa adhered.
A large pail or tbe message is taken
up with tbe discussion ol our foreign re-
a'lous which are, as usual, maintained
with a satisfactory degree of cordiality,
Tbe principal diplomatic evenU ot the
year have been tbe appointment of the
South American commission, tbe parti
cipation in the Congo conference now in
session, and the International Meridian
conference held at Washington. The
president's most important recommen
dations are those wiih respect to prow
Ion for participation in international
exhibition, tbe eettblUhmcnt of
uniform system ol naturalization
and the settlement of . certain
v xed questions Dtrtaioine thereto, and
and the needed readjustment of our di
plomatic and consular service to the de
mands of our national growth.
Tbe financial exhibit embodied in tbe
report of tha secretary of the treasury
shows a decrease in public expenditures
and notwithstanding a diminished
amount of revenue both from customs
and Internal taxation, a surplus In tbe
treasury tor the fiscal year, of nearly
sixty million dollars; thcugh in connec
tion with these facta tbe statistics of
trade afford an endorsement for the Re
publican policy of opposition to a tariff
for revenue only." The president again
renews bis recommendation for the ab
olition of all excise taxes except those
on distilled spirits. Tbe recommenda
tions for the Immediate suspension of
the coinage of silver dollars and the is
suance of silver certificates, and the
amendment of tbe laws lu relation to
national bants are not n:w, but will be
reagaraea as generally desirable a
tending to preterve tbe equilibrium of
trade and promote tbe efficiency of our
system of currency circulation.
The president's suggestions ss to
tariff reduction, while extremely
guarded, indicate a tendency in that d:
rection tbat may not be received with fa
vor bv the most pronounced school of
protectionists; though in his discussion
of the general problem ot the moat ef
fectlve means of increasing our foreign
trade, tbe president Indicates a line of
public policy that shows a clear appre
of the problem, which he riirhtfullyide
nominates a grave one; and the sugges
tion which he embodies ia bis discus
sion of this subject constitute be
yond questl'in the most important
portion or his message important both
because ot the vastoeas of tbe interests
Involved and the breadth or view with
which President Arthur points
out the salient f est urea of
the problem . aud formulates
a commercial policy which, will meet
the preseut emergency. That there should
be secured for tbe foreign carrying trade
of the United Slate a position of impor
tance commensurate with tbe greatness
of our internal resources, aud tbat ade
quate markets should be found for our
surplus productions 1 beyond doubi the
economic question of the hour. It presses
for a solution because tbe present is
America's opportunity lor commercial
extension.
The president's emphatic word as to
increaaiug the efficiency or our navy,
and the raising from Its enfeebled con
dition of our merchant manno will
therefore meet with universal approval
But It U in his recognition of our rela
tions to the West Indies, Central and
South America and hi suggestions look,
log toward tbe establishment ol a com
mercKlly united America that he has
struck we aey-note as to our
national policy ot commercial extension,
Tbe four measures which be suggests
first, a series of reciprocal commercial
treaties with these countries; second the
establishment of the consular service of
the United Slate on a salaried footing
third, the enactment ot measures to favor
the construction and maiotainance of a
ateam carrying marine under tbe flag of
the United Slates; and fourth, the estab
lishment of a uniform currency basis
fir tbe countries of America, are all
mesjuies for tbe accomplishment of
which active and immediate step should
be taken.
This portion of President Arthur's
message is tbe one empbati
cally demandicg legislative attention,

recommendations whose Importance

commercial question of the near future.

America are neighboring, neutral and
unaupplled markets which have been
too long neglected. It is the purpose of
tbe exposition to cure this serious de
fect in our commercial relatione with
the outside world and to act as a con
necting link between Ihu sources ot sup
ply and demand.
Mr. Anderson then stales the advent

Spaoisu-Amtricao countries, the West
India islands and the luu-r-ee'iu routes
across the Atnericau isthmus, it ia a
natural gateway between internal and
external trade, particularly tbe foreign
outlets which we so greatly ned."
What tbe fxpoiiirn proposes to do
for tbe promotion of American manu
factures and the development oi new for
eign markets may perhaps best be seen
by the statement of a few fuels and flg
nrcs as given by Mr. Anderson:
The annual expert ol merchandise
from the United States is, in direction,
follows lu value: Eighty-one per
cent to Europe aud adjacent countries
on the east ; ton per cent to American
countries on the south; bye Mr cent to
British America on the nortti, and lour
per cent to Post Ac countries on the west
"If we subdivide the export to Amer.
icau counliUs ou the south and couflne
the statistics to the fifteeu tlster repub
lics ot Spanish America it will be seen
tnat only Ave per cent of our annual ex
ports go lu thai direction. " Considered
a a wuole these fifteen republics viz:
Mexico, five in Central America and
nine more in South America are almost
totally deficient in manufacture. What
little ihey buy come chiefly from Eu
rope. While united with ui by land,
they are nt by rail highway of com
merce, our railway system having thus
far advanced only half way through tha
length of the fiifil Republic.
"The transcendent importance of
reaching out f-r the control of these un
suppiied but inviting markets is appa
rent when we consider the tacts relative
tJ tbe disposition of our annual man
ufactures. During the census year end
ing June 1, 1880. thev amounted to tbe
enormous total of $3,369,570,101 in value
or which only two per cent find foreign
markets.
"la other words. 08 per cent are used
by the 55.000,000 consumers at home aud
only 2 per cent by tbe 2,000.000,000 con
sumera in the markets or tbe world
Now, if any portion of those foreign coo
sumera are under-supplied, or csn be
supplied from our mills, it is idle to use
the word overproduction I here are
plenty ot such markets in Spaui-h Amer

Two years seo Pusey was the chief
clerk iu tiic Atchison, Topeka aud Santa
Fe shops at Topeka, and flrat came into
public notice for his active participation
in state politics sgainst St. John, who
was then a candidate for a third term.
Pusey was a Republican bf considerable
lefluence among the shop men, and he
dipped ao deep into politics tbat the
company discharged him. After the
election of Mr. Glick he was presented
to the governor aa a martyr, and, backed
by a strong combination of Independent
KeauDiicana at ropeka, bis appointment
as clerk at tbe penitentiary was urged,
and tbe governor waa prevailed upon to
grant it. The appointment waa con
sidered to be a recognition or tbe anti-
t'robibition Republican strength which
ralliea about Gov. Glick.
Pusey figured in state politics to some
extent during the late campaign. He
supported the slate Democratic ticket
and the Kr publican national ticket. Be
woie a Blaine and Logan bat durins: the
campaign, and an amusing custom of his
was t point it out as an evidence of his
Republicanism, while at the same time
he boasted ef hia independence in sup
porting tbe Democratic state ticket Be
was an enthusiastic admirer of Blaine
and intimated to some of hi friend that
be would have a soft sit under the
plumed knight if tbe latter was elected.

merhauic and understood anything
pertaining to the, building, con
struction or running of a locomotive
thoroughly. During tha earlier Dart ot
bis lifu he engineered fast trains and was
for a time employed on tbe Santa Fe.
Governor Glick appointed him chief
clerk at the prison early lo April of
1883, at the eame lima he appointed Dr.
Geo Nrally to the petition of surgeon
Ten days later Colonel Jones was ap

The FreatttehVa
Te tha Congrats of the Uaited Mates:
Since the close of your last session the
American people, in the exercise of their
highest right ot suffrage, have chosen
their chiet magistrate for the four year
ensuing. When it ia remembered that
in no period in the country' history has
the long political contest, which custo
marily precedes the day of the
national election, been waged with
greater fervor and intensity, it
U a subject of congratulation
that after the controversy at the polls
was over and while the slight prepon
derance by which tbe issue has been de
termined was as yet unascertained, the
public peace suffered no disturbance, but
the people everywhere patiently and
quietly awaited the reault. Nothing
could more strikingly illustrate the tem
per of the American citizen, his love of
order and his loyalty to law ; nothing
could more signally illustrate the
strength antftbe wisdom of our political
institutions. - .
Eight years have passed since a con
troversy concerning tha result of .ajpa
tlouai election sbarpty called the aitea
tiou of congress to tbe necessity of pro
viding more definite regulations for the
counting of the electoral vote. Ilia of
the greatest Importance tbat this ques
liou be solved before crnfliclicg claims
to the presidency shall again distract the
country, and 1 am persuaded that by Uie
pe-'ple at large any of the measures ot
relb f thus far proposed would be pre
ferred to continued luaciion.

Our relations with all foreign powers
continue tobesmUble. Wub Belgi
um a convention ha been signed where
by the scope of tbe present treaties bas

of either je.ua try, within tbe jurisdiction
of the other, equal rights aud privileges

The war between C ull and Peru is a
an end. For tbe arbitration ot the

Tbe state ol hostilities between
France aud China ooiitinues to be an
embarra-sing feature of our eastern re
lations. Thu Chinese government bss

was destroyed in the recent riots at
Canton. 1 renew tbe recommendation
of uy ia l annual oieacae tbat tae Can

Cbint. Thu true lulerpetation or tbe
recent treaty with that country permit
ting tbe restriction of Chinese immigra
tion ia likely to be again the
butiject of your '. deliberations. : It may
be s riously questioned whether the stat
ute parsed at the last session does not
violate tbe treaty rights of certain Chi
utse who left this country with return

now a e;u lo be disbrrd from landing
from the lack of certificates required by
the re v I. The rec nt purchase by
the UiVed State of a large trading fleet
heretolo;XunJer the Chinese fl-ig has
cocsiderablf enhanced our c m
mercial importance in the east.
In view oi the large number of
vessels built i r purchased by American
citizens iu other countries and exclu
sively employed in legitimate traffic
between foreign porta under tbe recog
nized prot-ction of our flag, it might be
well to r-rovlde a uniform rale of their
registraiion and documentation, so that
tbe bona fide property rights of our citi
zens therein shall be dulv evidenced and
properly guarded. Pursuant lo the ad
vice ot the senate at the last sesion, 1
recognized tbe flag of tbe Inter National
Association of the congress as that of a
friendly governmebt,avotdiog in so doing
anv prejudgment of conflict in territo
rial clains in that region. Subsequently
in xecution of the expressed wish of con
gress 1 appointed a commercial ag -nt
for the Congo basin,. Tbe importance
ot the rich prospective trade ot
the Congo valley bss led to
the neneral conviction tbat it
shou'd be open to all nations upon jqual
terms. An intcroa'ionai conference for
the consideration of this e abject was cull
ed by the emperor of Germany and is now
insi-csion at Berlin. Dcleirxti-s are iu at

Of the results or th conference y,u will

this p-operty by tbe governruen'. The
United Sta'es already possesses valuable

from the sultan of M or -ceo
As stntt-d hereafter. they have
lately received a similar gift from the
Siamese government. 1'he government
of Japan stand leady to reut to us x
tens'. ve grounds at Tokio, whereon to
erect a suitable building for tbe legation
court house and j nil, and similar privi
leges can probably be g -cured in China
and Persia. The owning of such prem
ise would not only effect a large saving
ot present rentals, but would permit of
tbe due assertion ot ext'a territorial
rights in those countries and would the
better serve to maintain tbe dignity of
the UntUd States.
The failure ot congress to make appro
priation for our representation at Auton

This government bas more than ouce
been called upon of late, to take action
in the fulfillment ol its international
obligation toward Spain. The agitation
in the Island of Cuba, hostile to the
Spanish crown, having been fermented
by per.-ons abusing the sacred rights of
hospitality which our territory aff rds,
the officers of tbe government have been
ins' ructed to use vigilance t prevent
infi action ol our laws at Key West aud
at the other points near the Cuban
oust. lam ba,ppy to say that in theonly
instance where these measures
were successfully eluded, tbe off. nders
when found in our territory were tab
sequently tried and coovxled. The
growinglneed of close relationship of in
tercoursc and traffic between tbe Spanisu
antillea and their natural market iu tbe
United States led to the adoption in
January last ol a commercial agreement
looking to tbat end. ibis agreement
bas since been superceded bv a more
carefully framed and comprenensiye
convention which I shall submit to the
senate for approval. It bas
been tbe aim of this negotiation to
open such favored reciprocal exchange
of production carried on ucder the flg
of cither country as to make the inter
course between Cuba and Porto Rico
and ourselves scarcely less intimate tban

secure a profi'ble share tor our indu-

it is a matter ot serious concern that trie
want or means tor participation iu these

those ol otber countries. During the

regard tendered by the governments of
England. Holland, Belgium. Germany

instances appointed honorary commis

provision to meet the necessary wotking
expense ot a commission, it can etieci
little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors.
An international inventor's exhibition
is t held in London next May. This
will cover a field of special importance
in which our country holds
a foremost rank. But the executive is
at present powerless to organize a proper
representation of our vast national inter
ests in this direction. I have in several
pievious measages referred to this ab

in its terms and portly obsolete. There
are special provisions of law favoring

In What quarters these reductions can be
most Judiciously effected. One of the
gravest of the problems which appeal lo
wisdom ot congress for solution is the
the ascertainment ot the moat effective
means of increasing our foreign trade
and thus relieving the depression under
which our industries are now languish
ing. The secretary of the treasury ad
vises that the duty ot investigation ol
this subject be intrusted in
the first instance to a competent com
mission. While fully recognizing the
considerations that may be urged against
this coursi, I am, nevertheless, of the
opinion tbat upon the ' whole no otber
would be likelv to eff-ct speedier or bet
ter results. That portiou of the secretary's
report which concerns the condition of
our interests cannot fall to command
vour attention. He emphatically rec
ommends that as an incentive to the
investment of American captlol - in
American steamships, tbe government
ail" be -liberal in payments for mail
transportation or otherwise lend its
active assistance to individual enterprise
and declares his belief that unless
that course be nursuid. our foreign car
rying trade must remain as it is to day,
almost exclusively in the bands of for
eigners. One phase of this subjace is
now especially piominent in view of the
repeal bv 'be set of Juue 26, 1884. of all
salutary provisions arbitrarily compel!
ing American vessels to carry tbe mails
to and from the United States. As it is
necessary to make provision to compen
sate tbe owners of such vessels for per.
forming the service after Apr.l 18, 1885.
It is hoped that the wbole subject will
receive early consideration tbat will had

The secretary ot war submits the re
port of tbe chief ot engineers as to the
practicability ol protecting oar import
ant cities on tbe seaboards by fortlnca
tion and other defenses able t repel
modern methods ot attack. Tbe time
has no come when such defenses
can be prepared wub c nfl fence that
thev will not preve abortive, and when
tbe possible result of delay in making
sucb preparation is seriously considered
delay seems inexcusable. For tbe most
important cities, those whose de
struction or capture wou'.d be
a natiouat humiliation, adequate
defenses inclusive of guns may be made
by tbe gradual expenditure of $60,000,
000. a sum much less than a victorious
enemy could levy as a contribution.
An appropriation of about one-tenth
that amount is asked t begin tbe work.
and I concur with the secretary of war
in urging that it be granted. Tbe war
department is proceeding with the con
version - of 10-inch smooth bore
guns into 8 loch rifles by
lining tbe former with tubes of forged
or of coiled wrought iron. Filly guns
will be thus converted within tbe year,
This, however- oca not obviate tbe ne
cessity of providing meant for the
construction of guns of the
highest power, botb for tha pur
poses ef the coast defenses and
for the armament of war vessels.
The report -t the gun foundry board, ap

that two government factories, one for

upon tbe designs of these cruisers are
discussed by ihe secretary, who Insists
that the correctness ol the conclusions
reached by the advisory board and by
the department his been demonstrated
by recent development on ship build
ing abroad. The machinery of the
double tarreted monitors Puritan,
Terror and Amphitrite, contracted for
under tbe act of March 3. 1883, is in pro
cess of construction. Ko work has been
done during the past year on their armor
for lack of tbe necessary appropriation.
A fourth monitor, the Monad eock, still
remain unfinished at the navy yard In
California. It Is recommended tbat early
steps be taken to complete these vessels.
and to provide also an armament lor ine
monitor Miantenomah. lha recommen
dations of the navy advisory board, ap
proved by the department, comprise the
construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500
tons, one cruiser ot 3,000 tons, two
heavily armed gunboats, one long cruis
ing gunboat and dispatch vessel armed
with Hotchkiss cannon, one armored
ram and three torpedo boats. The gen
eral designs, all oi which are calculated
to mart the existing wants of the service,
are now well advanced and tbe construc
tion of the vessels can be undertaken as
soon as you shall grant the necessity aa

The act of congress approved August
7. 1882. authorized the removal to the
United States of the bodies of Lieuten
ant Commander Oeorge DeLong and his
companions of the Jean net te expedition.
This removal bas been successfully ac
complished by Lieutenants Harber and
Hchtihz.- The remains were taken from
their grave in the Lena Delta tn March,
1883, and were retained at akeetsku
until the following winter. The season
being too far advanced to admit of their
immediate transportation, tbey arrived
at New York, February 20, 1884, where
thev were received wiih suitable honors
In pursuance of tbe joint resolution of
congress approved February 13, 1884, a
naval expedition was Sited out for the
reliet or Lieutenant A. W. Greely or the
United States army, aud or the party
who had been engaged under bis com
mand in scientific observations on Lady
Franklin Bay. The fleet consisted of
the steam sealer Thetis, purchased
in England, tbe Bear, purchased in St,
Johns, Newfoundland, and the Alert'
which was generously provided by the
British government. Tbe preparations
for the expedition were promptly made
by the secretary ot tbe navy with the
active co operation of the secretary of
war. Commander Oeorge W. Coffin was
placed in command of the Alert, and
Lieut. W. H . Emery in command of the
Bear. The Thetis was intrusted lo Com
mander W infield S. Copely, to whom
alsj was assigned tbe superintendency
ot tbe entire expedition. Immediately
noon its arrival at Upper Navick, th
fl .-et began the dangerous navigation of
Melville bay, and in spite of every ob
stacle, reached Little Island on J uoe 22,
a fortnight earlier than any vessel bad
before attained tbat point. On the same
day it crossed over to Cape Sabine,
where his party were discovered. Alter
takioir on board the living and tbe bodies
ot the dead, the reliet snips sauea tor
St. Johns, where they arrived on July 17.
Tby were appropriately received
at Portsmouth. N. H., on August
1, and at New York, on August 8. One
of the bodies was landed at the former
place. Tbe other were put on shore at
Governor's Island. With tbe exception
or one which which was interred in the
National cemetery, they were forwarded
thence te the destination indicated by
friends. The organization and conduct
of this reliet exjelition reflects great
credit uoon all who contributed to Its
success.
In this, the last of tbe stated messages

The repoit ot tne postmaster general
eral acquaints you with the present con
dition aud needs of tbe postal service.
It discloses the gratifying fact that tbe
loss of revenue from the reduction in
rate of letter postage as recommended in
my message of December, 1882, and ef
fected by the act of March 3, 1883. ha
been much leas than was generally ami
cipated. My recommendation of this
reduction was based upon the bellet mat
the actual falling off in receipts from
letter postage for the year immediately
succeeding tbe change of rate, could be
S3.000.000. It bas proved to oe
only $2,750,000. This is a trust
worthy indication mat me revenue
will scon be restored to its former
volume by natural increase of sealed cor
respondence. X confidently repeat
therefore tbe recommendation of my
last aunual message tbat tbe singla rate
of postage upon drop letters be reduced
to one cent, wherever payment of two
cents is now icquired by law. The
double rate is only exacted at offices
where the carrier system is in operation
and it sd Dears that at those offices that
the increase in tax upon local letters de
frays the coet not only oi its own collec

This is ao inequality that ought no

where else so great. Tbe scale of living
or our artisan classes is such aa tends to
secure tbeir personal comfort and the
development of those higher moral and
intellectual qualities that go to the mak
ing of good citizens. Our system of tax
and tariff legislation is yielding a reve
nue which is in excess of the present
needs of tbe government. Those are ele
ment from whlcb it is sought lo devise
a scheme by which without unfavorably
changing the condition oi tne woraing
men our mercnant marine snaa oe
raised from Its enfeebled condition, and
new market provided tor sale beyond
our borders of the manifold t.uits of our
industrial enterprises. The problem i
complex and can be solved by no single
measure of innovation or reiorm. ine
countries of tbe American continent and
the adjacent islands are for tbe United
States, the natural market for supply and
demand. It is from them that weshould
obtain what wnat we do not produce or
do not produce in sufficiency, and it ia
to them that the surplus productions oi
our fields, our mills and our workshops
could flow under conditions that will
equalize or favor them in comparison
witn foreign competition.
FOUR PATHS OF POLICY.
seem to poiut to this end. First, a ae
ries of reciprocal commercial treaties
with tbe countries ot America which
shall foster between us and them an un
hampered increase of trade. The con
ditions of these treaties should be the
free admission of such merchandise aa
this country does not produce, in return
for admission, tree or uuaer a lavoraoie
scheme of duties of our own products.
The benefits of such exchange to apply
on these goods carried under the nag or
the Darties to tbe contract, the removal
on botb sides from vessels so privileged
of all tonnage dues and national imports
so that their vessels msv pty nnntnoerea
between our ports and those of other
contracting parties, though without in
fringing the deserved home coasting
trade. The removal of reduction of bur
dens on tho exported products of those
countries, coming witbin the benefits of
tbe treaties, and the avoidance oi tne
technical restrictions anp penalties by
which our Intercourse with those coun
tries is at present hampered. Secondly,
tbe establishment of the consular service
of the United States on a salaried foot-
ins, permitting tbe relinquishment of
consular fees, not only as respects ves
sels under tbe eational flag but also as
respects vessels of the treaty nations
carrying goods entitled to the benefit
of the treaties. Thirdly, tho enactment
of measures to favor the construction of
a steam carrying marine, under the flag
of tbe United States. Fourthly, the ea
tabllsbment of a uniform currency basis
for the countries of America, so that
tbe coined products of our mints may
circulate on equal terms throughout the
whole system oi our commonweaiw.
This would require a monetary union
of America, whereby the output of the
bullion producing countries and the cir
culation of those which yield neither
gold nor silver could be adjusted in con
formity with the population, wealth and
commercial needs of each. Aa many of
the countries furnish no bullion to the
common stock, the surplus production
of our mines and mints might thus be
utilized and a step taken towards the
general remonetizalion of silver.
To the accompiisument ot inese enus
so far as they can be attained by separate
treaties, the negotiations already con
cluded and now in progress have been
directed, and the favor with which this
enlarged policy has thus far been re
ceived, warrants the belief that Its oper
ations will ere long embrace all or near
ly all tbe countries of this hemisphere.
it is by no means desirable, nowever,
that the policy ander consideration
should be applie I to these countries at
once. Tbe healthful enlargement of
our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa
should be sought. By reducing the tar
iff burdens on such or their wares as
neither we nor the other American states
are fitted to produce, and thus en
abling ourselves to obtain, in re
turn, a better marxet tor our
supplies of food, of raw materials
and of the manufactures in which
we excel, it seems to me that many ot
the embarrassing elements in the great
national conflict between protection and
free trade may thus be turned to good
account. That the revenue may be re
duced so that no longer to overtax the
people, that protective duties may be re
tained without becoming burdensome,
tbat our shipping interest may be judi
ciously encouraged, the currency fixed
on a firm basis and above all such on
unity of interests established among the
states of the American system as will be
of great and ever increasing advantage
to them all. All treaties in the line of
this policy which have been negotiated
or are in progress or negotiation contain
a provision deemed to be requisite under
the clause of the constitution limiting to
tbe house ot representative the author
ity to originate bills lor raising revenue.
