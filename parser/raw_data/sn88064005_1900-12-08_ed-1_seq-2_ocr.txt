The Republicans should be proud

The other nations of Europe may I

the trick simply by sending Berahart

Cprtain Republicans are now de

Nevertheless, the traiff rates are t

"The Empire is Peace."
Just after war between the States a IST A
newspaper was published in New of
York City, entitled "'The Imperialist" tr
which had for its motto "The Empire ENC
is Peace," The people however were Hon
not ready for the change, but the said,
party of centralization has made ion
progress since that time. The recent he]
triumph of the Republican party is pay
another step in the direction of mon- M
-archy. As an indication of the ®:
tendency to abandon the government 0
- of our fatheres, we produced from sixt
an Iowa newspaper the following: by
"If anything was needed to de- Sar
- monstrate the inability of our present the
form of government to cope with the 'oo
conditions which we have entered in- of i
to, it is the disgraceful frauds of the 4 b
k Cuban postal department. For a doi
long time, thinking people, who have A
large commercial interests, have felt of
o unsafe, with our present form of mi
d government from the fact that we are pu
controlled by cheapjohn politicians pa;
at and ward-heelers. Now is a good of
erto do away with our old obsolete ow
constitution and adopt a form of bl,
government that will be logical with wl
our new expansion ideas and will so
a give anpple protection to capital. We re
ir- should not be disgraced in the eyes pt
es. of civilized nations by such a sightof
as the violence and killing that ac- cl
company the operation of street cars
in St. Louis now, a constitutional fe
,nd monarchytis probably the most desir- m
ie able plan we could now adopt. Every- 5
thing is ripe for the change. We Ib
lay have a large standing army and it can n,
of be increased under almost any pretext ei
without causing any alarm to the p
masses. This country has been so G
prosperous that the voters have lost if
the spirit of patriotism and honesty
de. that are necessary to the successful
tled operation of republics. The strong
eri- iron hand of discipline will have to be
ew used to bring the masses to a sense of
to proper behavior. We take it that the
great farming interests of the country
will readily adapt themselves to a
ari change. The farmer is a great lover
els of law and order and under monu
ised arachy these results will follow. Our
'ea constitution is largely the expression
now of French revolutionary ideas; ideas
to suggested by hot-headed theorists.
than Jefferson and Paine found American
soil suitable for the promulgation of
Voltairism and Rousseauism. Now
fates the church is strong enough to back
the biblical teaching of kingship. It
need take but a few years to convince
yet our political rulers to make the change
for Certainly it must have suggested itself
a are to the minds of the statesman in
save Washington."
