The Secretary of the Navy lias take n
steps towards the e.-tablishn ent of naval
coaling stations at the Isthmus of I’ana
ma, to meet the requirements of our com
mercial relations with Central and South
America, which are rapidly growing in
importance. Locations eminently suit.a
Lie, both as regards our naval purposes
and the nsea of c mtnerce, have been se
lected, one on the cast side of the isthmus,
at Chiritjui Lagoon, in the Caribbean Sea,
and the other on tne Pacific coast, at the
Bay of Gollito. The only safe harbors,
sufficiently commodious, on the isthmus,
are at these points, and the distance be
tween them is less than one hundred
miles. The report of tlie Secretary of the
Navy concludes with \ aluable suggestions
■with respect to the building up of our
merchant-marine service, which deserve
the favorable consul -ration of Congress
The report of the Postmaster General
exhibits the continual growth and the
high state of efficiency of tlie pos'a! ser
vice. The operations of no department
of the Government, perhaps, represent
with greater exactness the increase in de
population and the ha tuesa of the coun
try. In iB6O the postal receipts were
18,518,007 -It); in 18R() the receipts wete
133,315,379,31 All the inhabitants of the
country ate directly and personally in
terested in having proper mail facilities,
and naturally watch the Post Office vi i y
closely. Ti is careful oversight on the
part of tin- people has proved a constant
stimulus to improvement. During tin
past year there wa- an increase of O,LSI
post offices, and the mail routes were e\
tended 27,177 miles, making an additio al
annual transportation of 10,804,191 miles.
The revenues of the postal service for the
ensuing year are estimated at $38,845,-
174 10, ami the expenditures at $42,470,032,
leaving a deficiency to be appropriated
out of the Treasury of $3.630,7.77.110.
The I’niversal Postal Union has re
cclved the accession of almost all the
countries and colonies of the world main
taining organized postal services, and it
is confidently expected that all the other
countries and colonies now outside the
Union will soon unite therewith, thus
realizing the grand idea and aim of the
founders of the Union, of forming, for
purposes of international mail communi
cation, a single postal territory embrac
ing the world, with complete uniformity
of postal charges, and conditions of in
tennationul exchange, for all descriptions
of correspondence Toonable the U nited
Slates to do its full share of this great
work, additional legislation is asked by
the Postmaster-Genera , to whose recoin
incndatlons espi cial atteu'ion is called.
The suggestion of the I’nstma-t 1 r Gen
eral that it would he wise to encourage,
by appropriate legislation, the establish
ment of American lines of steamers by
our own citizens, to carry the mails be
tween our own ports and those of Mexico,
Central America, South America ad of
trails Pacific countries, is commended to
the serious consideration of congress.
The attention of congress is also invited
to the suggestions of the Postmaster Gen
eral in legard to postal savings
The necessity for additional provision,
to aid in the transat tion of the business
of the Federal courts, becomes i-acu year
more apparent. T'ae duckets of the Su
premo Court, and of ti e Circuit courts, in
the greater number of the circuits, are en
cumbered with the constant accession of
Cases. In the former court, and in many
instances in the Circuit Courts, years in
tervenc before it is practicable to bring
cases to hearing.
The Attorney Ge-eral recommends the
cstahlishu ot an intermediate court of
errors and appeals. It is recommended
that the number of Judges of the Circuit
Court in each circuit, with the exception
of the second circuit, should be increased
by the addition of another Judge in the
second circuit, that two should he added;
and that an intermediate Appellate Court
should he formed in each circuit, to con
gist of the Circuit Judges and Urn Circuit
Justice, and that in the event of the ah
sence of either of these Judges the place
of the absent Judge should be supplied
by the Judge of one of the District
v hurts in the circuit, : ,ch an Appellate
Court could be safely invested with large
jurisdiction, and its decisions would
satisfy suitors in many eases where ap
peals would still be allowed to the Su
preme Court. The expense incurred for
this intermediate court, will require a
p"y moderate increase of the appropria- I
tions for the expenses of the Department
of Justice. This recommendation is com
mended to the careful consideration ot
Congress.
it is evident that a delay of justice, in i
many instances oppressive and disastrous
U) suitors, now necessarily occurs in the
Federal courts, which will in this way be ,
remedied.
The report of the Secretary of the inte
rior presents an elaborate account of the
operations of that department dicing the
past year. It gives me great pleasure to say
that our Indian affairs appear to be in a
more hopeful condition now than ever
before The Indiana have made gratify
ing progress in agriculture, herding, and
mechanical pursuits. Many who were
a few years ago in It -stile conlliet with
tin- Government an quietly settling down
on farms where they h->; e to make their
permanent homes, building houses and
engaging in the occupation s of civilized
111 The introduction of the freighting
business among them has been remarka
bly fruitful of good results, In giving
many of them congenial and remunerative
•
billon to earn ‘heir own support. Their
honesty, fidelity and i ifieicncy us carriers
are highly pra -ed. The organization of
a police force of Indians, has been equally
successful in maintaining law and order
n- -
a wholesome and moral influence among
the Indians them'-dves I concur with
the Secretary of uu- Interior in the rec
ommendation that t ie pay of this lorce be
increased, as an induct mcnl to the best
Class of youn m u to eut-.T it.
Much care and attention has b u n de
voted to the enlargement of e-lue itional
facilities for the Indians The means
available for this important objo, i have
been ve-y inadequate. A : w additional
boarding schools at Indian agetu-u s hat
been established, and the erection of
buildings has iveen K gun tor si-vctal
mere, but an inc-ease oi the ippi j- a
tions for this interesting undertaking -s
greatly needed to acc- mmod ite the la-.e
i number of Indian children of school ge.
I lie number offered by their parents from
all parts of the country for education in
the governmont schools is much larger
than can be accommodated with Hie
means at present available for that pur
pose Tiie number ol Indian pupils at
the Normal School at Hampton, Va,
under (Redirection of General Armstrong,
has been considerably increased, ami
their progress is highly encouraging. The
In dan school established bv the Interior
Department in 1871), ut Carlisle, Pa.,
under the direction of Captain Pratt, has
been equally successful. It ha • now nearly
two hundred pupils of both sexes, repre
senting a great variety of tribes east of
tne Kooky Mountains. The pupils in
both these institutions receive not only
an elementary English education, but ore
also instructed in h lusework, agriculture
and useful mechanical pursuits. A simi
lar school was estab ished this year al
Forest Grove, Oregon, lor the education
of Indian youth on the Pacific coast. In
addition to this, thirty-six Indian boys
and girls were selected from the Eastern
Cherokees and placed in boarding-schools
in North Carolina, where they are to ru
ceive an elementary English education
and training in industrial pursuits. The
interest shown hv Indian parents, even
among the so-called wild tribes, in the
education of their children, is very grati
fying. and gives promise that the results
accomplished hy the eflorts now making
will be of lasting hem tit.
The expenses of Indian education have
>o lar been drawn from the permanent
civilization fund at the disposal of the
Department of the Interior; but the fund
is now so much reduced that Hie contin
uance of this beneficial work will in the
future depend on specific appropriations
by Congress for the purpose, and I ven
ture to express the hope that Congress
will not permit institutions so fruitlul ot
good results to perish for want of means
for ttieir support. On the contrary, an
increase of the number of such schools
appears to me highly advisable.
The past year Ins been unusually free
from disturbances among the Indian
tribes. An agreement lias been made with
the Lies by which they surrender their
large reservation in Colorado In consider
ation of an annuity, to be paid to them,
and agree to settle in severalty on certain
lands designated for that purpose, as
farmers, holding individual title to their
land in tee-simple, inalienable for a cer
tain period. In this way a costly Indian
war lia* been avoided, which at one time,
seemed imminent, and, for th first, time
in the history of the country, an Indian
nation has given up its tribal existence to
be settled in severalty,and to live us indi
viduals under the Common protection of
the laws of the country. The conduct of
the Indians throughout the country, dur
ing the past year, with but few noteworthy
exceptions, has been orderly and peace
ful. The guerrilla warfare carried in for
two years by Victoria and his band of
Southern Apat lies, has virtually come to
an end by the death of that chief and
most ol his followers, on Mexican soil.
The disturbances caused on our northern
frontier by Sitting Bull and his men, who
fold taken refuge in tlie British dominions,
are also likely to cease. A large majority
of his have surrond red to our
military forces, and the remainder are
apparently in progress of disintegration
1 concur with the Secretary of Hie In
terim- in expressing file earnest hope that
{’ongpa- ? will at tills session lake favor
able action on the bill providing for Hie
allotment of lands on the different reser
vations in severalty to the Indians, with
patents conferring fee-simple title inalien
able for -i certain period, and the eventual
disposition of the residue of the reserva
tions, for general settlement, with the eon
stmt and tor the benefit of the Indians,
placing Hie latter und. r the equal protec
tion of the laws of the country. This
measure, together with a vigorous prose
cation of our educational efforts, will
work the most important and effective ad
vance toward the solution of the Indian
problem, in preparing for the gradual
merging of our Indian population in Hie
great body of American citizenship.
A larue increase is reported in the dis
posal of public lands for settlement dur
ing the past year, which marks the pros
porous growth of our agricultural indus
try, and a vigorous movement of popula
tiun toward our unoecupi <1 lands. A?
this movement proceeds, the codification
of our hu and laws, as well as proper legis
lation to regulate the disposition of pub
lie lan Is, become, of more pressi- g neces
sity, and I therefore invite the considera
tion of Congress to the report and the
acc mpanying draft of a bill, made by
Hie Public Lunds Commission, which
were communicated by me to Congress at
the last session. Early action upon this
important subject is highly desirable.
The attention of congress is again
asked to ths wasteful depredations com
mined on our public timber lands, and
the rapid and indiscriminate destruction
of our forests. The urgent neee.ssi y for
legislation to this end is now genet ally
recognized. In view of the lawltss char
aoter of the depredations committed, and
the disastrous consequences which will
inevitably follow their continuance, leg is
1-aliou lias again and again been recom
mended to am si the evil, and to prest rve
for the people our w estern state? and ter
ritories the timber needed tor a mitstic
and other essential uses.
The report of the Director of the Geo.
logical Survey is a document of unusual
interest. The consolidation of tne van
ous geological and geographical -urvejs
and exploring enterprise s, each of w hich
fi :i s heretofore operated upon an inde
pendent plan, without concert, cannot
tail to be of great benefit to all those in
du-tries of Hie country which depend up
on the development of our mineral re
souivos. The labors ot (lie scientific men,
ol recognized merit, who compose the
corps ot the geological survey during the
first season of their flel t operations and
inquiries, appear to have been very com
preluui'ive, and will soon be communi
cated to congress in a number of vol
umes The do. ctorof the survey recom
mends that the Investigations canned on
by hi* bureau, which, ?<> far, have been
eonrtm 1 to the so-called public land
slate- jnl territories, be ixtcmb and over
Hie eiLire country, ami that the necessary
appropriati-m be made lor this purpose.

t ae t >n, e-ala and <ober mining interests
of th Missis- ppi v i.ley. and ol the cast
ern and southern states. The subject is
commended to the careful consideration
of congress.
The Secretary of the Interior asks at
i tention to the want of room in the public
buildings of the capital, now existing ami
! in progress of cinstruction, for the
i accommodation of the clerical force etn
■ ployed, and of the public records. Ne-
I cessity lias compelled the renting, of
! private buildings in different parts or tlie
: city for the location ot public offices, for
which a large amount of rent is annually,
paid, while the separation of offices be
longing to the same depanmeats impedes
the transaction of current business. The
Secretary suggests Unit the blocks sur
rounding La Fayette Square, on the east,
north and west, be puremv- and as the sites
for new edifices, for the accommodation
of the Government offices, leaving the
square itself intact; and that, if such
buildings were constructed upon a har
monious plan of architecture, they would
add much to the beauty of the national
capital, and would, together with the
Treasury and the new State, Navy, and
War Department building, form one of
| the most imposing groups of public edi
: flees in the world.
The Commissioner of Agriculture ex-
I presses the confident belief that his efforts
i in behalf of the production of our own
'■ sugar and tea have been encouragingly
rewarded. The importance of the results
attained have attracted marked attention
al home, and have received the special
consideration of foreign nations. The
successful cultivation of our own tea, and
the manufacture of our own sugar, would
make a difference of many millions of
dollars annually iu the wealth of the na
tion.
The report of the (’ umnissioner asks
attention particularly to the continued
prevalence of an infectious and conta
gious cattle disease, known and dreaded
in Europe and Asia as cattle plague, or
pleuropneumonia. A mild type of this
disease, in certain sections of our coun-
I try, is the occasion of great loss to our
farmers, and of serious disturbance to our
j trade vviHi Great Britain, which furnishes
: a market (or most of our live slock and
t dressed meats. The value of neat cattle
i exported from the L uited States for the
eight months ended August 31, 1880, was
more than twelve million dollars, and
nearly double the value for the same pe
ri.al in 18711, an unexample 1 increase of
export trade. Your early attention is so
licited to thi- important matter.
The Commissioner of Education re
ports a continued increase of public in
terest in educational atlairs, and that the
public schools generally thvou liOut • he
country are well sustained. Industrial
training is attracting deserve 1 attention,
and colleges for instruction, theorectical
and practical, in agriculture and the me
chanic arts, i eluding the Government
schools recently established for the in
struction of Indian youth, are gaining
steadily in public estimation. The Com
missioner asks speci il attention to the
depredations committed on the binds re
served for the future support of public
instruction, and to the very great need of
help from the nation for schools in the
tenitories and in the Southern estates.
The recommendation heretofore made is
repeated and urged, that an educational
fund be set apart from the net proceeds
of the sales of the public lands annually,
the income of which, and the remainder
of the net annual proceeds, to be distrib
ut and, on some satisfactory plan, to the
states and territories and the District of
| Columbia.
The success of the public schools of
j the Distiictof Columbia, and the progress
made under the intelligent direction of
the Board of Education and the Superin
tendent, in supplying the educational re
i quirements ot the district, with thorough
■ ly trained and efficient teachers, is very
| gratifying. The acts of Congress, from
| time to time, donating public lands to the
j several states and territories in aid of ed
-1 ucational interests, have proved to he wise
measures of public policy, resulting in
great ami lasting benefit, it would seem
to b • a matter of simple justice to extend
the benefits ot this legislation. Hie wis
dom of which has been so fully vindi
cated by experience, to the District of
Columbia.
I again commend the general i .terests
of the District of Columbia to the favor
-1 able consideration of Congress. Tne
affairs of the District, a? shown by the
report of the Commissioners, are in a
i very satisfactory condition.
la my annual messages heretofore, and
iu my special message of December IP,
187 P, 1 have urged upon the atten
tion of Congress the necessity of
reclaiming the marshes of the Poto
mac, adjacent to the capital, and I
am constrained by its importance to ad
: vert again to the subject. These flats
embrace an area of several hundred acres.
They are an impeUiment to the drainage
of the city, and seriously impair its
health, it is believed that, with this sub
stantial improvement of its river front,
the capital would be, in all aspects, one
of the most attractive cities in the world.
Aside from its permanent population, this
city is necessarily the place of residence
of persons from every section of the
country, engaged in the public service
Many o’.h rs reside lure temp airily, for

I eminent.
it should not bo forgotten that the land
acquired will probably be worth the cost
of reclaiming it, and that the navigation
of the liver will be greatly improved. 1
therefore again invite the attention of
Congress to the importance of prompt
provision for this much-needed and too
long-delayed improvement.
The water supply ot the city i< inade
quate. In addition to the ordinary use
throughout th city, tb’ 1 consumption >y
Government G nee -s irily very great in
the navy-yard, arsenal, and the various
departments, an Ia large quantity is re
quired for the proper pn >ervation of the
numerous park? and the cleansing of
sewers. I recommend that this subject
receive the early attention of Congress,
and that, in making provision fur in
increased supply, such means be adopted
us will have in view th future grovvtn of
i e city. Temporary expedients for -itch
a purpose cannot but be wasteful of
money, an 1 then-fore unwise. A more
ample i ■ erv* ir, with corrvspon Ung fa
cilities for keeping it filled, should, in my
judgment, be constructed. I commend
again to t ie ivtu ntoni of Congr >s the
subject of the removal, from their present
location, of the depots of the several rail
roads entering the city; and I leuew the
rec mmendations of my former messages
iu behalf of th'e erection of a building for
the Congressional Library, the completion
of the Washington Monument, and of
liberal appropriations in support of the
benevolent, reformatory, and penal insti
tutions of the District,

There is one bed —or, mure strictly
speaking, a bundle of rags—in the mrin-r.
'1 he household consists of an old man a.
ragg'-d as Kip on the mountains, a woman
whose face the wrukles have twisted
ami furrowed so deeply that it require
an immense sweep of imagination h
think that it was ever young. Four
children, from live to fourteen years of
age, pale and hungry, dart about the
riMiiu like dock rats. Except one, the
little one, whose hair lay back on her
white forehead as if it had been swept
there by the winds, whose hands were
like shadows, and whose eyes seemed
to he fastened on the dingy and a- -olate
lucking ceiling. She lay upon a pallet,
and the mother sat on the floor beside
her and administered now and then a
taste of w ater.
“She's the only white onein the flock,”
said the man as he tugged at bis short
and bristling beard.
“She's the only one of the gang that’s
fitted to be an angel, she is,” he continued
as lie stared upon the sick face before
him. “She won’t never get out of it;
there aintno use Irvin’it on her,” he
went ou in an abstracted way. “We have
had the county duct >r, but such as them
flint given to bangin' round a sick bed
likeher’n. lie left some truck and she
took it, but it never mended her ailin’,
and I guess he’ll not come hack.
The little face famed over on its
mother’s arm, and there was hardly life
enough in it to he perceptible. “Bynie
by,” the father said, a few minutes later,
“some weenien raim- in here and left a
pone of bread and made her somethin*
that kind o’ seemed to make her peert
like, as she was w hen she crossed the
’hio, and then they read a piece outen
the book, and one of ’em—she was a
smart lookin’ w oman, and wasn’t afraid
of dirty in* her clothin’ nor nothin’,
though her goods was line—she got down
on the floor tiinr, and shut her eves
kinder close, half-way, and held her
hands, ono of ’em on her husiuu. and
(other on the child’s head, and the Knits
quit runuin’ round, and it was awful
still. And the woman turned her face
up agin the ceilin’.” He paused fora
moment, as if ho had to gather a little
strength. And then: “Talk about
prayin'l Bho put up the best one I ever
iieard south of the ’hio, and I reckon it
w as as solid w ith Him a- heard it as any
that was got oil', it kinder made things
mere hopeful around, and the child
opened her eyes wide, just as if she
knew the woman was puttin’ up for her.
It got down into me. though there w asu’t
any stakes put up for mo tit all. When
she wint away i said to Emily—that's
wife—that 1 w ould try my hand on just
one prayer, it seemed to help tilings so.
Tlu* old woman shook her head,’cause
I never thought of such a thing before.
But 1 got down and put up every cent
1 had —I mean everything J could think
of. And when I got to the last word,
the amen, it stuck iu my throat, but
Knnlv got away with it. She said it
right out line it was in im-etin’.”
“I guess I made a misdeal somewhere.”
he continued rather mournfully. “The
little one didn’t look up anv, and she’s
been grovvin’ weaker everyday. Emily
said I had spiledthe whole business, and
crow-led the poor woman’s prayer out.
But 1 never rnent it. Ef I'd known i
was interferin’, I’d never put up agin hen
hand.”
There was a blast of wind that cam
and rattled the w indow, and a kind of a
moan,•and then the head of the sick child
and its face turned over in the mother’s
lap. . Its thin lips met Hie wrinkled ones,
and the struggle was over.
The grim-faced, hardy-looking man
Lent over the pallet, hut there was a
good deal of good sense left in him
still. He turned to the reporter, who
had gone to the scene of misery, and
said: “But lam not the man to go back
on good prayin’, even if 1 didn't win. I
reckon the hand that the woman put up
will win for somebody else's little one,
efit don’t for ours. For it was the solid
cs) hand I ever see. not Veptin’ the eouth
side of the ’hio in old Kintuck.”
A pauper child was buried yesterday.

My friend, little Johnnie, sends me the
following' anecdote, suitable, he thinks,
to the Winter season; “There ain’t no
place like ( aliforny h r skatin’. First
thing a hoy doc- is to buy a skate, and
when In 1 gets bigger, and more money,
lie Lize a other, and girls, too. And when
there is frost everybody takes their

and (he clock ter lie come, and he said,
the dockt'-r did, ‘ Wot is the matter?
Take api I.’ Then the ole man, he said,
• No. it is jest I am a ruin man,’ and the
doekter he said, ‘Take two pils.’ But
the old feller he shnko hi head savin'.
‘ It ain’t that ; wot ails me is blasted hops
