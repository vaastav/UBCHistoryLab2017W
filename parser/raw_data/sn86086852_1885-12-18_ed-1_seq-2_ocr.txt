THE DEMOCRAT.
Mineral Point, Friday, Dec. 18, 1885.
Oeo. Crawford, Robt. M. Crawford,
EDITOEfi AND EEOPEIETOES.
The December number of the
Wisconsin Journal of Education
contains an excellent article on
“Our ‘News of the Week,’” by
.1, W. Livingston, principal of the
Dodgeville high school.
Congressman Cass well, of the first
district of this state has prepared
a bill imposing a uniform duty of
seventy-five per cent, on all foreign
tobacco. The present duty is
sventy-five per cent, on wrappers
and thirty-five per cent, on other
grades.
The French are coming to their
senses on the meat question. It is
said that a resolution abolishing
the prohibitory duties upon Amer
ican preserved meats will soon be
Introduced in the chamber of dep
uties. If the Frenchmen know
what is for their own interest the
resolution will cairy.
On account of the adoption of a
new code of rules the lower house
of congress is rather slow in getting
down to business; but when that
matter is settled work will probably
go ahead at a lively rate, as there
are many important matters to
come up for consideration, and
there seems to he a determination
on the part of both house and sen
ate to expedite business.
The ease of Angus Cannon, a
Mormon convicted in the supreme
court of I tali, under the Edmunds
law, was appealetl to the supreme
court of the I ’nited States, and a
decision was rendered on Monday,
affirming the judgment of the
lower court. This is the hardest
blow that niormonisrn has yet re
ceived in the courts, and it is
thought will render it impossible
for those guilty of polygamy to
escape.
In Lite electoral contests in (iroat
Britain and Ireland the. liberals have
secured a large plurality over the
conservatives; hut as the Irish nation
alists have secured something over
eighty members, it is hardly prob
able that the liberals will have a
majority over both conservatives
and nationalists. Hf they should
have a majority at all it will be
too small to make it safe for the
liberals to lake office, and depend
upon their own strength alone for
support. A coalition between the
liberals and nationalists is now
strongly talked of, and Mr. (Jlad
stono seems disposed to make such
concessions to Mr. Parnell as will
secure his support. It now seems
that through the assistance of the
liberals Ireland may obtain in
some measure at least, the relief
demanded. It is far more likely
to come from this source than from
the lories.
Secretary Manning who was
claimed by the protectionists as one
of their own, turns out to be far
from befuddled on the question of
import duties. Ho is not in lavoi
of tariff tinkering; but would rather
have the present much tinkered
taiiiV laws repealed, and more ex
plicit and reasonable statutes enact
ed in their stead. Ho takes no
stock in the sonsless cry of “pauper
labor,” and recognizes the fact that
“the higher wages of American labor
are at once the secret and the scourit}’
of our capacity to distance all com
petition from ‘pauper labor’ in any
market." He favors a material re
duction of import duties, and con
siders the pretence of tax payers
for duties upon articles not produced
in this country justifiable, and
would have raw materials placed
upon the free list. Surely the ad
vocates of the spoliation system
have indeed caught a tartar in the
Hon. Daniel Manning. He promises
to be one of the most effectual
workers in the cause of tariff reform.
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Very few newspapers of the
country have ventured an adverse
criticism upon President Cleveland's
message to congress, which is genar
ally regarded as being one of the
ablest state papers ever written.
The Now York Post (independent)
says:
it I* not often (hat President* message gets,
much praise both at home and abroad as has
been bestowed on President rieteland’s. * * j
The theory that Mr. Cleveland was weak and
would be inspired by others has evidently been
abandoned. No state paper produced in this .
c ountry since Lincoln’s death has contained so ,
many evidences as President Cleveland's of liar- !
in; *’ a man behind the pen."
The New York Tribune, which
before his election to the Presidency |
could see no good in Mr. Cleveland,]
criticises the message very favorably,]
and says:
The first message of the president is a credit
able one. On some of the most important
questions of which it treats it deserves hearty
praise. • • The president's argument for
the suppression of silver coinage is earnest,
strong, and convincing. Criticism of Hs details
is needless; Ure earnest tone and clear reasoning
of the well remembered February’ letter appear
again In the message. It Is to the credit of the
president that there Isuo wavering or flinching
In his recommendation, and his utterances arc
as bravely uncompromising as if he wen' not
aware of the pronounced hostility of a large
majority of his party in the house.
The New York World (democrat
ic) says;
The message is a safe clear, conservative paper,
and upon the whole It an able state document.
The New York Times (indepen
dent) says;
The confidence of the country in President
Cleveland's sound judgment, in his practical
sense, and in his firm grasp of great public ques
tions, will be confirmed and increased by bit
first mes&agr to congress. It is so cethiug more
and higher than a business message. * *
To defend the national dignity and honor, to
respect the laws himself, and insist that others
rpa’i obey tin® to punish and prevent dishonest
suits, to adTance'our vast material interests and
maintain our national credit, and put wisdom
above partisanship—these are the principles and
purposes which guided the executive hand in
preparing this review of the affairs of the nation.
It U the complex sentiment of patriotism re
duced to a practical expression and applied to
the business of the state.
The Louisville Courier (democrat
ic ) says:
The message of President Cleveland gives
every assurance to the people that the govern
ment Is in the hands of one careful, capable and
patriotic. It shows that he has mastered the
difficulties of the political situation, and that he
will meet with sound judgment and courage
immovable any emergency which may rise. lie
speaks frankly, plainly, and forcibly on all the
points affecting the welfare of the people, and
those who heretofore have believed that he was
an accident will be convinced that he is a man
whose own force of character has marked out
his destiny.
The New York Evening Mail (re
publican) says:
The general underlying principles of the
message are those of an honest and earnest
democrat, whose convictions as to the limita
lions of the sphere and functions of the
federal government are very clear and strong
In the application of these principles, and in
the application of the seilled American princi
ples as regards our foreign relations, Mr. Cleve
land shows to good advantage.
The Minneapolis Tribune ( repub
lican ) speaks of the message as a
dignified, studied effort:
It does not heflgo, or apologize or cater to the
silver party in a single expression; but it pro
ceeds to demolish iheir position with a cumula
tive use of facts and logic that is overwhelming.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press (repub
lican) says:
Without a single exception, the views of the
president on everyone of the multitude of sub
jects which lie touches are wise and sound.
The Buffalo Express (Republican)
published at the President’s home,
says:
It cannot be said that Mr. Cleveland’s message
lm verbose or diffuse. It is clearly all his own,
and his stylo i.s always terse and compact.
Many may disagree with the president’s opin
ions, but in ..e, we think can fairly deny that
they are presented in a candid, honorable and
truthful way. It is a state paper of which no
American will he ashamed and of w hich Uuflalo
Americans have a right to he proud. Four years
ago—or even a year ago—nobody would have
chosen Mr. Cleveland us that citizen of buffalo
best qualified to write a presidential message.
Many would not now' choose him: Hut if we
have many men here who can write as good a
message, it is fair to conclude that this i*
brainy kind of a tow n.

Narrow Escapes.
The Lancaster Herald of last week
reports the following:
While the Kev. Mr. Eaton ami Kcv. Jo.-. Dr
mares; were out driving, on Friday last they
had occasion u> cross the railroad track near the
depot, while ihe attemoon Ireight was switch
ing. The locomotive was under a fair rate ef
speed, going toward the crossing, upon which
the horse of the reverend gentlemen had just
stepped. The engine was reversed and brakes
applied, and every effort made to stop, whi'e the
spectators held their breath in the expectancy
of seeing a frightful accident. But Ihe locomo
tive passed jc- as the carriage left the crowdug,
barely grazing the hind wheels.
And the Darlington Journal of
Wednesday. Dec, 9:fc, reports a
somewhat similar escape, ns follows:
Louis Gable of Seymour, had two close caisi
for a trip to the other side of Jordan yesterday.
He drove his team and sleigh load of lumber
across the railroad track on Main Street just iu
front of the south bound train iu the afternoon,
and if he had been a quarter of a second later
the locomotive would have knocked horses
and deigh "galley west,"—wherever that is. In
turn .ug the corner Irom Main to Louis Street, three
minutes later, the lumber cramped the sleigh,
throwing Mr. Gabel under the tanners; but his
good luc-K preserved him a second and he eseped
a second time without serious injury. He evi
dently was not born to die by acccideut.
A Singular Eica;‘.
Matt Fisher, of the town of Ken
dall, Lafayette county, was thresh
ing his grain a short time ago, and
had a team hauling the grain from
the machine into his barn. When
the wagon was partially loaded,
Mr. Fisher, left his son, a lad of 12
years, sitting in the wagon holding
the horses, when they started to run
for the barn, and as one of their
bridles came off the little fellow
was unable to stop them; nor did
they stop until they ran through
the barn and out of the hack door,
taking hoy, wagon, oats, a post and
three boards of the barn with them.
The door through which they made
their exit was ten feet from the
ground, but strange to say. nothing
but the wagon was injured in the
grand tumble. The hoy patiently
kept his seat and came out without
a scratch. The wagon tongue broke
and prevented the wagon from fall
ing upon the horses. The escape
from serious injury to the boy and
the horses was indeed a singular one.

Peck’s Sun of Dee. IJ, contained the following!
notice of Strong’s History of the Territory o
Wisconsin: The Sun office received, some lime
ago, Moses M. .Strong’s History of the Territory
of Wisconsin, from ISio to 18published by
authority of the Male, and having somewhat the
appearance of a Pub. Doc. it was not examined
until this week, when we found it a very inter
esting hook of over six hundred pages, and one
that every Wisconsin citizen should read—the
elder ones as a reminder of old Times, and the
younger ones to learn something about the early
history of the state they are now proud to call
their own. Of course, much of it is statistical
and dry, but their is enough history to make it
very interesting, and it is exceptionally well
compiled. A fine steel-plate engraving of the
author appears in front, showing a typical
American countenance, keen, kindly and in
tellectual—that one of the pioneers who helped
carve out a noble stale. It is made up mostly
of con pilalions from various sources, and the
author has aimed at accuracy rather than sensa
tional description. It is a good book, and Mr.
Strong’s time has been well employed.

‘‘Ob, you'rt ne>s particular. Jim, bring
t the chestn it, ”
■'No.” said Frank, “never mind. I don't
vant to sc© him. I want you to choose a
torso for mo.”
No doubt horse dealers are as honest as
ither dealers, but Mr. Barker's astonishment
vas indescribable. It might have been tliat
fa convicted forger given a blank check
md asked to take care of it, or that of a
vcif to whom a sheep brought its Lamb
it'd lagged that it might bo looked after for
i wldle, or that of a cat asked to stand sen
iuel over the cream.
Vet bo was equal to the occasion. ‘'Want
tie to choose a horse? Can’t do bettor, sir.
iVhenevor the dake or the marquis wants a
icrse ia a hurry they writ© to me to send
hem one. S'pose if I can suit the duke I can
-nil \ on.”
"I don’t know, fm fidgety. You can
TV.”
Still Barker could not feel certain whether
io was dealing with a sharp man or a
001.
“There's the chestnut I spoke of. He’s the
very thiag for you.”
“How much;" said Frank laconically.
‘‘One bundled and twenty guineas,” said
Mr. Barker with that emphasis on the last
word which says that the vendor is proof
Against the same number of pounds.
“Look here,” said Frank, sharply, “you
Snd me a hvvrse for six weeks. I don't care if
it's black, brown, or blue. Name the lowest
price you mean to take, and if the price suits
mo and I buy it and don’t find any particular
vices i’ll give you twenty per cent, more, and
tlio hoisa to resell for me at the end of that
time. Now- then, is it the chestnut
Barker made a long pause; then, with an
assumption of candor, said: “No, sir, after
that it isn’t the chestnut. You come here;
I'll show you what it is,"
Mr. Carruthers never told any one the
ssaet price his horse cost him, so we will not
force ourselves into his secrets. He left the
repository, having settled that if a veterinary
surgeon's certificate could accompany the
dark bay horse just shown him it might be
icnt to Hazlewood House that afternoon.
Then ha bade Mr. Barker good-day and
strolled back to Oakbury.
Just bet ore he reached Hazlewood House he
was overtaken by Beatrice and her cavalier.
They reined up and spoke a few- words.
\ ouug Burton was iu high good humor, and
lelightfully condescending.
"Pity you don't ride, Mr. Carruthers,” he
said.
“It is a pity. Mill you coach me? Re
venge is sweet, you know.”
“I’ll bring my father's old herso round
some morning and give you a lesson. 1 dare
say you would soon pick it up.”
“You were always a kind-hearted boy,’’
said Frank gratefully. “Miss Clanson, dc
you think I could learn to i ido r”
“You are too lazy, I fear.”
“Yes; I suspect I am. I won’t trouble
you. Burton. Good-by.”
The horses trotted on, and Frank sauntered
back to Hazlewood House smiling placidly.
Iu the afternoon, to Miss Clauson's supreme
astonishment, the new purchase arrived. She
and Frank were in the garden at the time.
The bay was placed in Mr. Giles 1 charge, and
that personage, after Inspecting it, rejoiced
for tw o reasons: the first, that Mr. Barkei
had not “bested” Frank; the second, thal
even if Frank had “hosted” Mi-. Barker, the
horse must have cost a pot of money, and a(
whatever figure his. William's, introduction
might Vie assessed, the backsheesh must be
worth having.
“I thought you didn’t care for riding,” said
Beatrice.
“I don’t—much.”
‘‘Then why but - such a horse?”
“Because I should like to ride with you.”
He gave her one of his quick glances.
Beatrice turned away, ashamed to feel thal
she was blushing. She was very cold and
reserved during the evening, yet the auda
cious young man chose to take it for granted
that she would accept him for her cavalier
v:r<t Burton superseded.
Horace having duly admired the horse and
shaken his head at the palpable extrava
gance, made a series of elaborate rule-of
three call nlatious, and determined, if three
horses ate a certain quantity of certain
things in a certain time, how a fourth horse
would affect the quantity, the things and the
time.
Young Burton was too shy to offer his
escort ou the next morning—he feared lest
he might wear out his welcome, bo his ride
was a solitary one. Judge his utter disgust
when, quietly trotting alsng, be encountered
Miss Ulauson and Mr. Carruthers, the latter
mounted ou a steed the like to w hich Mr,
Burton had for years longed to own, and,
moreover, riding as if he know all about it*
This sight was very had for young Burton.
Had ho been jiootieal he might have com
pared himself to the eagle struck down by its
own quill. As it was, ho muttered, “A jolly
sell, by Jove!” and after the unavoidable
greetings and Mr. Carruthers’ inevitable
bit of badinage, rode home in a disconsolate
state.
CHAPTER XIII.
GASTRONOMIC AND EROTIC.
. -•' S'"'* f' jj
There were delicious rides together.
The long vacation was running down to
the lees. August had passed into September,
and September bad softly stolen away. The
scarlet geraniums, calceolarias, and other
bedding-out plants which had ail the summer
brightened the gardens of Ilazlewood House,
were beginning to show signs of scn.le decay.
The under gardener found it no light work
io keep the paths free from fallen leaves.
Vet Trank Carruthers still lingered at Oak
bury enjoying his cousins' hospitality. Hav
ing ar oun and the post of mental physician to
Miss Clauson, ho was no doubt reluctant to
resign it until 1 e bad effected a radical cure.
Besides, the days slippis! by happily enough.
There were drives through the green elm
shadod Westshtre lanes, which lead to hills
fr- ui the fuminrs of which fine views of tbs
country and th t di-ant tea are obtainable.
\s Horace drove, aud as Herbert invariably
occupied the le;r seat, Frank and Beatrice

< 1 ves, an an augement w hich one of the two
found far from unpleasant.

Frank was such a success wi-h tlse e tlmt
Horace and Herbert were quite proud of

Or it mayfco Mi s Claason was silent, eud
Prank, watching every lice of her fctau'Lc!

Alt-ogcthcr, it wul be understood that if Mr.
Carr-. thrrs ftii rl in curing Miss Clauson’:
-o-np’a-nt it wt.sßd to from no want of o-rror
tunity, or fram being d/harrod making an
exhaustive ttady of the patient.
In plain Engh h. Frank had fallen in love
with Boatriee, in that good oid-fasliiouci wny.

About thin date he often ashed fcirntelf the

ccraJ/’s acquaintance, and learned that be

crEa-hert Alt hough they were os food cf
gossip as men always are, wild horses would
net have rent cgjh a cocfidcocc from their
kindly hearts. Sylvanus himself was
Frank's informant.
The energeti*. bustling curate had returned
to Oakbury. Haring his absence the Talberts
had requested Beatrice to decide as to the
terms of intimacy which should for the future
exist between Hailewcod House and Mr,
Mordle, Fro trice quietly told her uncle
that is was her i articular wish that the Rev.
Sylvanus sh.-adl be received on exactly tb

gave the Thlbrrts great satisfaction. They

with the curate. So whoo Sylvanus returned

I those. Which, as he was resolved to ca—
harden his heat t by accustoming himself to .
seeing Miss Clansoa in file light of nothing ■
more than a friend, w as very often.
So Mr, Carrut hers and the curate met fix 1

mch as fiction, nt least, seldom allows to e -

so tvturnol with him to England. it w
swept away for ever and ever as s> va us \
jwuer saw Frank and Beatrice together. J
recwgniKd destiny, and bowed to it as a v
ered man should.
It was no doubt lh<> desire to prove i ■
testable to himself tl-.at he was cured, 1 1.-
•made him. in a moment of brisk ooutkl ;u\ ,
tell Frank how he ha and faro I. The manner ii

“Yen scarcely expect me to say I ■
sorry!” he asked.
“No. Want no sympathy. Oak. v as. ■

xmgratulate you I can do so with all rr.

“Ah:" said Frank, smiling. “Nolle—
rery noble. When the time comes. -1 ho 'le
softly. Thereupon he foil into a train e:
bought—a train w hich ran upon a sing:,
iue and always took him to one particular
station.
This, then, is how matters sUxsl at lha
seginuing of October. Mr. far rut hers ha\<-
ng completed his diagnosis, not perhaps to
i;s en. ire satisfaction, fell that the moment
was drawing near w hen he must make thr
supreme effort to expel forever that morbid

Jr cure remedy, tho desperate nature of
| which would, strangely enough, net not
tpou the patient but mvn him who adminis
tered it. No wonder, with so little to guide
lira, ho hesitated and postponed.
At this juncture tho Talberts gave a din
ner-party—a man's dinner (tarty. The fol
lowing were tho blessed recipients of invita
tions; Lord Kristen, who was staying fora
few days at his place; Sir John V. idomis, ol
Almondsthorpo; Colonel White, the oiilcet
commanding the ivgimcnt at the neighbor
ing barracks; Mr. i'ellou, tho polished Royal
Academician who was sojourning nt tho vil
lage inn, mid making outdoor sketches ol
autumnal foliage, and Jlr. Fletcher, of tin
Hollows, the largist landowner, save Lord
I Kelston, in tho county. Those, with Frank
! and tho hosts, made a party of eight—the
number which, according to an axiom of the
1 Talberts, should never bo exceeded.
| From the above names and descriptions it
will bo rightly guessed that tho jiarly w.-is
distiuguisheii, weli-seUx-ted and wcll-'.v.l
on cod. Helection and balauoo were mutter
upon whieh tho brothers prided themselvvs
' as much if not more than they did upon f .
i refinement of tha dinner itself. In this puv
j ticulor party, small ns it was, culture,
' learning, art, arms, landed interest and
hercdi.ary sway were projM-i-ly p -i-sonified.
It was, indeed, a representative gathering
after the Talberts’ own hearts.
But two days before it took place an event
happened which threatened it id. Lord Kcl
ston wrote Horace ono of l!u>so pleasant,
familiar letters which, coming from a lord,
ai-o always delightful. Ho sai<l he should
take the liberty of bringing Iris friend Mr.
Simmons with him. As this would raise the
number to nine it necessitated asking another
I man in order to equalize tho sides of the
j table.
Then camo consultation high and earnest,
i Whom could they ask upon so short a not ire
worthy of forming one of such ndistiuguished
party? Each of tho Talberts would have felt
insulted hail ho invn asked by a friend t o stop
a gap; so, following tho golden rule they
shrank from tho task before them. Still,
they could not have four on one side of the
table and three on tho other.
Frank listened to their solemn deliberations
for seme time, then tried to help them out of
i tho difficulty. “Leave mo out,’’ ho said.
“Beatrice and I”—ho spoke of her sometimes
now as Beatrice—“will dine together in the
nursery or the housekeeper’s 00111. Whit
taker can bring Iho dishes st raight from your
table. It will be delightful."
“M r dear Frank!” This joint exclamation
showed the utter futility of his suggestion.
“Why not ask tho rector? I thought it was
the duty of a ountry clergyman to meet
emergencies like this.”
“Hot ’..sellout nothing but his fishing, ’’
said Ho; ace mournfully.
“Fishing for what ? For men C
“No; salmon and tro answered Horace,
as usual tatiug tho matter prosaically.
“Why not Mordle? He is capital com
pany.’
‘ :I i 1-uin."’sai'i Horace, glancing ai
beet. “This itscarcely ft curate’s party."
“No, scarcely,” raid Herbert, slinking i.
hen L
A last they decided to ask a Mr. Turner,
but thod cl: ii a was arrived nt with misgiv
ing. ; lor Mr. Turner was in trade. Ho was.
however, a merchant prince—even a mer

This it one of the many advantages of untei
tair.iug lords.
Nevertheless they were conscience stricken
athav; ga'ked anyone to stop a gap, to
EXCi’e amouds by arranging their guests so
that Jlr. Turner should sit on Herl>rt’s left
baud; Horace's supporters being 1/ud Kc*-
st- nan 1 his friend, Mr. Bimmous. The Latter
was a r an of middle ago, with dark eyes and
exquisitely chiseled aquiline features, aid
wearing an air of refinement that al one.'
commended him to Horace.
Tho dinner began propitiously, and j>ro
gres.ed faultlessly. The table, over the dec
oration cf which tho brothers had spent much
' iinoari 1 more thought, wa:a [icrfect picture.
■When their guests were only men ILo Tai
b ;rts were extra particular. The lark of s lie
refining element, the presence of woman, had
to bo f omprnsate 1 by an ultra fastidiousness
.£ detail. Even Frank, who had been behind
ho scenes, marveled at the effect of his hosts’
h .r pitablo end art stic exertions. But, all thr
same, he pitied them as we should ail pit y i.
host who is certain to bo rendered wretched
by a tureen of burnt soap or a bottle ol
corked wine.
H race talked gravely and pleasantly U
the right and to the left. Herbert was com
pelled to attend almost entirely to Mr. Tur
ner, who had a booming voice, which ho in
sisted upon making heard, f rank, who was
r.o-;t to tho artist, found tho dinner not so dull
as be had feared it would lx;.
In the coursa cf conversation Horace learnt
that lord KeLstou’sfriend w as Mr. Bimruons,
the no nil barrister, who had so suddenly
sprung i’.to eminence. Mr. Bimmons was *
Jew of gentle birth and education, and Horace
wax very fend of high-class .Tews. Ho tho two
m a got on admirably. Frank also knew
who Mr. Simmons was. Herbert did not.
Ail w ent on as well as the Talberts could
have wis ed until the claret was placed ol
the table. Then an awful thing occurred —a
euvA rrUmpt, which to this day is a sore sub
jact with Horace and Hf-rljert. It.all aruat
from inviting the stop-gap. Listen.
Jlr. Turner, as leaders of commerce arc
very properly in the habit of doing, began
te Iking about England’s commercial con
di'.ion. He spoko in his biggest voice.
As he w-is treating upon a subject or
which be was an authority, he felt be had a
right to use iL Herbert listened with hi>
gentle, pobte smile, but felt sorry Mr. Tnrnei
had been invited.
“What is ruining England C boomed out
Mr. Turner, “i’ll tell you, my dear air.
The Jews ore raining England.’ 1
As Mr. Turner must know best, Herbert
simply bowe 1 In acquiescence.
Horace in the meantime was saying to Hr.
Simmons:
“It is an indisputable fact that the Jews
are the most loyal, patriotic race under tin
sun- Th or cleverness no one denies. In the
finer, the emotional arts, such as music and
poetry, it is generally admitted that a mat
must have a strain of Jewish blood in him tc
riso to eminence.’'
