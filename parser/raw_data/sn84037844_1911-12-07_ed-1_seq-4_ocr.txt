An Even ng Kch'o.
Country is not a mere zone of ter
ritory. The true country is the Ideal
to which it gives birth; It is tho:
thought of love, tho sense of com
munion. which unites in one all sons
of the terr tory.?JOSfiPil .MiAZ
2i.NI.
No one has heard of the present
Adamston adm.nistrat.on's being a
brilliant succeso. There aro l.kely
to bo some rad.cal changes out there
with n about three more full moons.
Some of the bridge approaches In
the suburbs of the city are pro-'
nounced Unsafe and at other
bridges there s no protection tftj
pedestrians, whatever. Those in'
authority should look after these at
once.
-A
Negotiations seem well under
way for a street car line to N'orthrj
view, it is hoped that they will be
successful. That hustling suburban
town a entitled to easy access '.q.i
tho city and a street car line lo(
Northvlew certainly would start
that place to booming rapidly.
Harassing Jurors.
It Is reported that criminal court:
jurors are bein? harassed by per-:
sons who make it their particular
business to reprimand jurors after
verdicts have been returned. Those
alleged busy-bodies have the r own
Ideas as to what shoijld happen to
men on trial, and if juries fail to!
return verdicts conforming to such!
IdeaB. the jurors are told by them I
that they did not do their duty, i
There ought to be some way to pro
tect men from such insults, rep
rimands and harass ng who are'
commanded by the state to do jury J
duty. They aro not there of their
own free will as a usual th ng and
most of them would prefer not to do
jury duty. Why should they boj
made victims of adverse criticism
because their verdicts do not suit1
designers nnd meddlers? The
practice is a peril to justlco as
there-may be men on juries some^j
t mes who thus flnd'ng themselves
criticized by men who ought to
know better nyty bo Influenced In
later trials to act to some extent ar
leaBt so *as to allay such further
criticism.
Especially, is this true in the
trials of colored and fore gn-born
persons. These busy-bod es engender
class hatred. They should be given
to understand that jurors aro an
Important part of a court and that
persons have no more moral right at
leaBt to approach and reprove them
for their verdicts thin such persons
or anyone else would have to repri
mand the trial judge because they
differed from him as to hia
sentences.
Shopp ng nt Home.
Tho duty to do Christmas shop
ping early is not more imperative
than to do Christmas shopping and
all other kinds of shopping at home.
If possible. Civic patriotism s d's
credlted every time anyone runs
away from Clarksburg to buy goods
elsewhere.
To do shopp ng at home Is a thing
dictated also by self-lnterst: for
there ia no form of bus ness or
profess'onal life that is not indi
rectly benefited by loyalty to local
?tores. The more goods home
Merchants sell, the more work
there is for every one whose pros
perity depends upon the wealth, j
the size and the activity of Clarks
burg. Cnfted we stand, divided we
fall. All for each and each for all
Spend your money at homo and It
"Will come back to you,
rJiTa 'here any among ? us who1
tpeak of malting purchases In Pitts
oni'g or S'ew York with pride? Then'
let us admonish them that they
should acknowledge such action re
luctantly and with shame. Let them
reflect bow such action would appear
tp them Jf thoy were the home
merchants discriminated aga'nst In
this disloyal fashion. As a general
rule, nothing can be obtained In the'
shops of other cities that can not
be obtained here. See what confl
dence home merchants have shown j
In provld ng these splend'd empori
ums crammed with articles adapted
to the most exacting taste and to
the slenderest purBO. Do we not all
owe them tribute of loyal sup
port? ,
Anti-Trust Records.
An append.* to President Taft's
; message to the Congress on the
mt -trust subject is of more than
ord nary importance as it is a con
cise review of what the courts and
various administrations have been
and are do ng under the Sherman
anti-trust law.
Beginning with the administration
of 'President Harr son, Presiden
Taft shows that the department of
justice brought seven suits under
that law and won three. Durinp
the second administration of Grover
Cleveland the government prose
cuted eight suits and won four. Un
der MoKinley three suits were In
stituted and two won. With the
Roosevelt admin stration forty-four
suits were instituted and the gov-;
ernment obtained favorable action
oa- twenty-three of them with sev
eral pending.
Thus far within the Taft adminis
tration thirty-seven court actions
have been brought under the Sher
man anti-trust law. Many of them
are of too recent date to be at the
stage of decree in both the lower and
higher courts, but there has been
favorable action In eight or ten
cases and combinations have beon
dissolved In several Instances. Be
sides 'n 'the neghborhood of $200,
000 in fines has been Imposed, the
major portion of which has been col
lected.
In view pt this record, it is not a
matter of truth to say that the
trusts have not been vigorously
prosecuted under the anti-trust law,
especially during the adm n stra
tions of former President Roosevelt
and President Taft. Those who
have any conception of court pro
cedure at all muBt confess that the
department of justice has been very
busy and the success attained em
phas zes the v'gorous manner em
nloyed In breaking up combinations
and monopolies.
The anti-trust records of Roose
velt and Taft are not to be desp'sei
by any except those In sympathy
with trusts and monopolies.
Away Ahead.
On the scorn of progressiveness'
through the channel of an alert board
[of trade, ClarkBburg has gono away
"ahead of most West Virginia cities.
The Dispatch-News at Parkersburs
admits this in respcct to Parkers
burg and refers to that city's pos
tlon in the premises as a shame and
a disgrace. The Parkersburg news
paper also recognizes that there is
much more to be gained through
the united effort of a large number
of business men of a community
than through the efforts of only a'
few and in th's both new and old
members of the Clarksburg Board
of Trade have cause for gratiflcat on
and encouragement. Says the Dia
pntch-News:
The people o( Huntington, Charles
ton. Clarksburg, Morgantown and
Fairmont have rallied magnificently
to the support of their chambers of
commerce or boards of trado, hun
dreds of business men in each town
Joining just to help out with a
membership fee. And yet, the
board of commerce of Tarkersburg
goes plodd'ng along with Icbs than
ono hundred pay ng members, and
doing as successful work for Par
kersburg as any of these richer con
temporaries have done or aro doing
for their respective cities. It is a
shnmo and a disgrace; the Parkeri
burg board of commerce should
have a membership of 1.000, and
every application to belong should
he accompanied by a chock for a
year's dues.
A Good Suggestion.
A most commsndable suggestion
has been made by prominent labor
unionists In Pittsburg, 'Wheeling
and elsewhere to distribute the re
maining port on of the $190,001)
contributed toward the defense of
the confessed IMoN'amara dynamiters!
among the w dows and orphans of;
the men who were killed In the
blowing up of the Los Angeles'
Times. Such a course would help,
In a great measure to lift the labor
organizations of the coutnry out oil
the plight nto which they hare:
fallen, though Innocently, and aid ln;
removing the stigma that has been!
cast upon their operations.
The Pittsburg Dispatch declares
such a course would be humane,
just and creditable, and comments
thereon as'follows:
It offers to the contributors, mis
led by the most positive affirma
tions of innocence and faith ill fel
low unionists, an opportunity for
the amende honorable. Having been
deceived Into volunteering support
where none. It Is now shown, was
deserved, there could be no finer dis
avowal of that error than to turn
over the money so subscribed for
the relief of the 'nnocent living vie
tlms of the crime. >In no other way. j
possibly, can they so convincingly
Bet themselves right with public
opinion, remove from unionism
?ho reproach cast upon it by the
MoNamaras and disassociate them
selves from the complications in
which they have been deceitfully n j
volved by the belief that they werr
aas'stlng in protecting Innocence un j
justly accused.
Much of this money has no doubi
been expended In the conduct of the,
case, but whatever has not been j
spent could not, we believe, be de '
voted to a cause ntore deserving or!
more redounding to the credit of or- ?
ganlzed labor than 'ts distribution;
amdng the widows and orphans of
the victims.

"Mamma, what's a seal?" asked
eight-year-old Mary, looking up from
the paper, whose black headlines she
was laboriously deciphering.
"A seal Is a I'ttle animal that live?
in the ocean. We use its fur for coats
and wraps," was the enlightening an
swer of the Trent.
Mary puckered her brow for some
minutes, and again interrogated.
"Mamma, will seals stop plagues?"
referring perhaps to some of the
Biblical narratives Ehe had heard told
ln Sunday school.
"Stop plagues! Why, child, what
are you talking about?" cried the
mother in amazement.
"Why here It says, 'Red Cross
Seals Stop White Plague," triumph
antly holding up the paper.
Then mamma explained to her lit
lie girl that the Red Cross Seal Is a
tiny stamp-like sticker which Is
placed on the hack of letters and
packages coming from Santa Claus
and others. Every seal costs a penny,
and every penny gees to fight and
cure consumption, which la the real
name of the white plague, and which
Is an awful sickness. Mamma told
her of a little girl in their own neigh
borhood who had consumption, but
who was given a chance to get well
because the people had bought Red
Cross Seals.
Mary listened attentively, and final
iy touched by the closeness of the ap
peal,. said, "Mamma. I think I'd
ra&her have some of those seals than
a now dolly."
