GRAND JURY IS
EMPANALLED
A grand jury was drawn at Boise
Saturday in the United States Dis
trict court upon the order of Judge
Dietrich to report for duty Decem
ber 14. The order was entered upon
the request of Districe Attorney
Lingenfelter, who stated there was
business pending which required the
services of a jury. The only unusual
circumstances surrounding the action
of the court is the fact that court
has been in session several weeks and
that the drawing usually takes place
at the opening of the term.
Judge Dietrick stated yesterday af
ternoon the jury had not been empan
eled at that time, owing to the fact
that ha
to
rancisco at any time but
since learned he would
bs required to go until some time in
January.
In the federal practice it is neces
sary for all criminal cases to be con
sidered by the grand jury before they
can be presented to the court. Prob
ably the most important of the actions
pending, in which defendants have
been bound over to the grand jury,
is that of the United States vs. F.
Douglas, charged with using the
mails in carrying a lottery into execu
tion.
The names drawn from the box are
as follows: John Little, Mountain
home; Willis Whipple, Payette; C. L.

TAFTS MESSAGE
TO CONGRESS
President William H. Taft sent his
first annual message on the state of
the Union to congress Tuesday. The
two houses of congress convened in
regular session Monday. This is the
first regular session of the sixty-first
congress. The President's message
treats of the following matters :
"The relations of the United States
with all foreign governments have
continued the nominal basis of amity
and good understanding, and very
generally satisfactory," says the pres
ident. He calls attention to the sat
isfactory results of the arbitration
treaty entered Jnto between the gov
ernments of Great Britain and the
United States, whereby the north At
lantic fisheries questions are being
settled by arbitration. The questions
have been a cause of difference be
tween the two countries for 70 years,
but the final settlement of the rights
,of the U. S. is now at hand;
is also the.settlement of the boundary
line between this country and Canada.
It is recommended that the United
States participate in the Brussels'
world's fair to be held in 1910.
Turkey is eongiatulatsd upon her
transition from a government of
retregrade tendencies to a constitu
tional government with a parliament
and with progressive policies of re
form.
The conditions In Latin America
are very satisfactory in every respect.
Peru and Boliva have agreed to arbi
trate their boundary differences. At
tention is called to the fourth Pan
American conference to be held at
Buenos Ayres, Argetina, July 9th
next. The importance of this is called
to mind, from its political, social and
trade standpoints. The American
policy known is as the Munroe doc
trine is re-affirmed. Mexico is in a
highly prosperous condition and the
relationship of our sister republic
and the United States are amiable.
The relations of the United States
with Cuba, Domingo and the republic
of Panama are satisfactory. The
President justifies the action of the
government in its handling of Nic
aragua. The President calls attention
to the disturbances caused by the
Zelayan government.
In the far east the policy of the
United States is to maintain the open
door in China. Our traditional rela
tions with Japan continue cordial.
The reorganization of the Depart
ment of State is recommended. The
Department should be modernized.
The President says :
"I earnestly recommend to the fa
vorable action of the congress the es
timates submitted by the department
of the state and most especially the
legislation suggested by the secretary
of state's letter, whereby it will be
possible to develops and make perma
nent the re-organization of the depart
ment upon modern lines in a manner
to make a thoroughly efficient instru
ment in the furtherance of oiir for
eign trade and American interests
abroad. The plan to have divisions
of Latin-American and far eastern
affairs and to institute a certain spec
ialization in business with Europe
and the near east will at once com
mend itself. These politico-geograph
ical divisions and the detail from the
diplomatic or consular service to the
department, of a number of men,
who bring to the study of complicat
ed problems in different parts of the
world practical knowledge recently
gained on the spot clearly is of the
greatest advantage to the secretary
of state in foreseing conditions likely
to arise in conducting the great vari
ety of correspondence and negotia
tion."
Economy in public expenditures is
strongly recommended in all depart
ments ol government fcsr thiSTrea
notion curtailment of naval appropria
tions is recommended.
The custom frauds, the tariff,
laws, delays are discussed in con
formity with the President's former
expressions from the platform. A
ship subsidy bill is recommended;
and separate state-hood for Mexico
and Arizona. Additional legislation
far the suppression of the "white
slave" traffic is recommended; and
also the creation of a national bu
reau of health. In conclusion the
President says:
"Speaking generally, the country
is in a high state of prosperity.
There is every reason to believe that
we are now on the eve of a substan
tial business expansion, and we have
just garnered a harvest unexampled
in the market value of our agricul
tural products. The high prices,
which such products bring mean
great prosperity for the farming
community, but on the other hand
they mean very «considerable increas
ed burdens upon those classes in the
community whose yearly 'compensa
tion does not expand with the im
provement in business and the gen
eral prosperity. Various reasons are
given for the high prices. The pro
portionate increase in the output of
gold, which today is the chief med
ium of exchange and is in some re
spects a measurs of value, furnishes
a substantial explanation of at least
part of the increase in prices. Thé
increase in population and the more
expensive mode of living of the peo
ple which, have not been accompanied
by a proportionate increase in acre
age production, may furnish a future
reason. It is well to note that the in'
srease in the cost of living is not con
fined to this country, but prevails
the world over, and those who would
charge increases in prices to the ex
isting protective tariff must meet the
fact that the rise in prices has taken
place almost wholly in those products
of the factory and farm in respect to
which there has been either no in'
creass in the tariff or in many in
stances a very considerable reduc
tion."
BOND BILL INTRODUCED.
Senator William E. Borah intro
duced a bill Tuesday, providing for a
bond issue of |80,000,000, for the
completion of the reclamation pro
jects now under way.
FERAULT NAMED.

for census supervisor for Idaho, by
the President, Tuesday.
VISIBILITY
What is a I
visible typewriter?
Writing in sight is part of it. Keyboard in sight is the I
other part. It is as important that you see what you do
as to see what you have done. The key-for-every-character I
.keyboard of the easy action, light running MODEL 10
makes
it
only truly visible writing machine.
