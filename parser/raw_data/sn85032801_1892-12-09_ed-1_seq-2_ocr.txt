ODD TRAITS OF THE TIGER
The Striped Beast Has a Cnrlou Blending
of Cowardice and Courage.
One of the most extraordinary fea
tures of the tiger's nature is the ex
treme courage and the ultra cowardice
which seem to be so blended as to give
rise to the strongest expressions of dif
ference of opinion when two or more
experienced hunters are gathered to
gether. The best illustration of thi?
peculiarity of that giant cat of Bengal
are given in the recitation of the fol
lowing stories of actual occurrences:
As for extreme courage, December
22, 1792, a party of English hunters se
out for Sawgar island, bay of Bengal
for the double purpose of killing tiger?
and deer. Their equipment and ex
perience were ample, and the par
ty of four was headed by a sor
of Sir Hector Monroe. These gen
tlemen landed in the morning
hunted with success for deer all day
until about four in the afternoon th
heat caused them to seek the shade at
the edge of the jungle. They prepared
refreshments, even to buildincr a fire foi
cooking their game. While the mea
was under full headway of preparation
young Monroe looked up and declared
that he saw a deer not far from them.
He seized bis gun and started for thi
spot He had not taken twenty step?
from the camp when his companion)
heard a dreadful roar, saw at the sanu
instant a large tiger spring upon pool
Monroe, and, seizing the man by the
shoulder with his teeth, the beasi
turned and rushed back into the jungle,
dragging the form of Monroe after if
with the greatest ease, saplings, vine?
and small bushes all bending and
"breaking before the amazing strcngtl;
of the tiger
All that Monroe's companions could
do was done instantly, as only trainee
liunters can do they fired all togethei
at the tiger and it was evident to then
that their shots took effect, because al
most as soon as the smoke blew aside
Monroe came staggering out from th
thicket covered with blood, reached th
camp fire and fell Everything tha'
medical services could render was doni
for him, the ship's surgeon coming
right ashore, but it was all in vain. Thi
young man expired after the course o;
twenty-four hours in the greates'
agony. His head was torn, his skul
fractured and his neck and shoulder!
chewed and torn by the teeth and claws
of the savage beast Here was a squac
of men standing around a blazing fire
talking, laughing, and yet though ir
broad daylight, all this was notenougr
to divert that determined tiger fron
making the attack, and that bounc"
with which the ambushed animal threti
itself upon Monroe was as wonderfn
In its extent as it was terrible in it)
effect
As for Its cowardice: On the same daj
that the above tragedy transpired an
other party of English ladies and gen
tlemen in the Bengal district left th
shelter of an army post for a picnic on
the banks of a lovely little stream that
ran Into the bay not far away. The
lunch cloth had just been spread and
the excursionists were taking their
positions around it on the grass under
the shade of trees when one of them,
speechless with horror, pointed to the
form of a huge tiger, not twenty feet
away, crouched in form for its fatal
spring. All looked, when instantly
one of the ladies laid hold of her para
sol, rose to her feet and stepping quick
ly directly over to where the beast was
rapidly opened and shut it in the ani
mal's face. The tiger quickly wheeled
about and bounded swiftly off. . Per
haps it is not strictly correct to call
this an exhibition of poltroonery on
the part of the tiger; it may have been
utterly confused by the presence of
mind displayed by that young woman
and turned tail confounded rather than
scared. The lady herself, after the
affair was over, became completely un
nerved, and her associates had to re
turn at once to the post with her.

Paper Matches.
- A new match is on the tapis at Jon
koping, the invention of a Swedish en
gineer, Fredriksson by name, who has
leec experimenting for several years
for the purpose of simplifying the man
ufacture qf matches. The idea in his
match somewhat reminds one of the
rolled-up tape-measure of the tailor en
cased in a metal cover and with only
the end projecting. There is a metal
cover, in which is placed a roll of par
aflined paper, intercepted at regular
intervals so that small points art
formed. On these the igniting sub
stance is placed. An end of the paper
projects from out of the casing, and or
pulling it quickly out, the substance if
ignited against a small steel plate, anc
one has a match which burns slowly
and evenly. The metal cover can. o?
course, be varied in accordance witl
the different requirement of its use
and when the paper roll is finished, t
new one is inserted. It is claimed foi
this new kind of match that it simpli
fies the manufacture to a very consider
able degree, twenty men and eightj
boys being able to make onemillior
matches per hour. London Industries

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Mr. Harrison's Recommendations
to Congress.
A Comprehensive Review of National Af
fairs HU Views on Tariff Legislation
and Protection Condition of the
National Treasury.
Washington', Dec. 6. Both houses of
congress were presented with the pres
ident's message on assembling to-day.
As will be seen it is devoted, in addition
to the usual review of executive work,
to a consideration of the effect of the
changed political conditions on the com
mercial and financial business of the
country. The message as read is as
follows:
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In submitting my annual message to congress.
I have grt-at satisfaction in being able to say
that the general condition affecting the com
mercial and Industrial interests of the United
States are in the highest degree favorable. In
comparison of the existing conditions with
those of the most favorable period in the his
tory of the country will, I believe, show that so
high a decree of prosperity and so general a
diffusion of the comforts of life were never be
fore enjoyed by our people.
The total wealth of the country In I860 was
110,159,616,068; In lt90 it amounts to t2,610,OOJ.
000, an increase of 285 per cent
The total milf-ase of railways in the United
States in 1S63 was 30,626: in 18i it was 167,741.
an increase of 4SX per cent: and it Is estimated
there will be about 4.0JO miles of track added
by the close of the year of 1892. The oftldal
returns of the eleventh census and those of the
tenth census for seventy-five leading cities fur
nished the basis for the following comparisons:
In 18HI the ranital invested in nrnnnfuftnrimr
was f 1.232, 839 67J. Inl89thc capital invested
in manurueturing was t2,iX),7Ja,l. In 180
the number of employes was l,301,3i8. In 18J0
the number of employes was 2,271,134. In law
the wages earned were IX)l,96.i,778. In 1W) the
wases earned were 11.221. 170.451. In 1XSO thn
value of the product was 12,71 1,579,93). In 1890

were so hfch, whether measured by the cur

age of prices his been such as to give to agri

an increase of 230 per cent The number of

value 210,191.925. On January 1, IS92, the num
ber was52.39S.oi9 and the value 241.9.11,415. On
January 1, 1891, the number of cattle was 36.

1, 1S32, the number was 37,651. '39 and the value
1570,748.155.
If any are discontented with their state
here; if any believe that the wages or
prices, the returns for honest toil, are inade
quate, they should not fail to remember
that there is no other country in the world
where the conditions that seem to them hard,
would not be accepted as highly prosperous.
The English agriculturist would be glad to ex
change the returns of his labor for those of the
American farmer and the. Manchester work
men their wages for these of their fellows at
Fall Kiver.
I believe that the protective system, which
now for something like thirty years has pre
vailed iu our legislation has been a mighty in
strument for the development of our national
wealth and a most powerful agency in protect
ing the homes of our worklngmen from the in
vasion of want. I have felt a most solicitous
interest to preserve to our working people
rates of wages that would not ouly give dally
bread, but supply a comfortable margin for
those home attractions and family com
forts and enjoyments without which life
is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are Amer
ican citizens a part of the great people for
whom our constitution and government were
framed and instituted- and it cannot be a per
version of that constitution to so legislate as
to preserve in their homes the comfort, inde
pendence, loyalty and sense of Interest In the
government which are essential to good citi
zenship and which will bring them, as in 1861,
to the defense of the flag when it is assailed.
It is not my purpose to renew here the argu
ment in favor of a protective tariff. The result
of the recent election must be accepted as hav
ing introduced a new policy. We must assume
that the present tariff, constructed upon the
lines of protection, is to be repealed and that
there is to be substituted for it a tariff law
constructed solely with reference to revenue;
that no duty is to be higher because the in
crease will keep open an American mill
or keep up the wa?cs of an American work
man, but that in every case such a ra'e of duty
is to he imposed as will bring the treasury
of the United States the largest returns of
revenue. The contention has not been between
schedules, but between principles and it would
be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party
will not carry into legislation the principles ad
vocated by it and the pledges given to the peo
ple. The tariff bills passed by the house o;
representatives of the last session were. I sup
posed, even In the opinion of their promoters.
Inadequate and justified only by the fact that
the senate and house of representatives were
not in accord and that a general revision could
not, therefore, be undertaken.
I recommend that the whole subject of tariff
revision be left to the incoming congress. It is
a matter of regret that this work must be de
layed for at least three mouths, for the threat
of great tariff changes introduces so much un
certainty that an amount not easily estlmated.of
business inaction and of diminished production,
will necessarily result It is possible also that
this uncertainty may result in decreased reve
nues from customs duties.for our merchants will
make cautious orders for foreign goods in view
of the prospect of tariff reductions and the un
certainty as to when It will take eSect
Those who have advocated a protective tariff
can well afford to have their disastrous fore
casts of a change of policy disappointed. If a
system of customs duties can be framed that
will set the Idle wheels and looms of Europe in
motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign
made goods and at the same time keep our mills
busy, that wUl give us an increased participa
tion in "the markets of the world" of a greater
value than the home market that wesurrender
that will give Increased work to foreign work
men upon products to be consumed by our peo
ple without diminishing the amount of work to
be done here; that will enable the American
manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to
100 per cent more in wages than is paid In the
foreign mill and yet to compete in our mar
kets and in foreign markets with the
foreign producer; that will further reduce
the cost of articles of wear and food without
reducing the wages of those who produce them
that can be celebrated after its effvets have
been realized, as its expectation has been in
Europe, as well as in American cities, the au
thors and promoters of it will be entitled to the
highest praise. We have had in our history
several experiences of the contrasted effects of
a revenue and of a protective tariff: but this
generation has not felt them, and the experi
ence of one generation is not highly instructive
to the nex t. The friends of the protective sys
tem, wiih undiminished confidence in the prin
ciples they have advocated, wm await the re
sults of the new experiment.
The strained and toooften disturbed relations
existing between the employes and employers
in our great manufacturing establishments
have not been favorable to a consideration by
the wage earher of the effect upon wages f the
protective system.
The fact that his wage, were the highest
paid In the like callings of the world and that a
maintenance of this rate of wages In the ab
sence of protective duties upon the product of
his labor, was impossible, were obscured by
the passion evoked by these contests. He may
now be able to review the question in the light
of his personal experience under the operation
of a tariff for revenue only. If that experience
shall demonstrate that present rates of wages
are thereby maintained or increased, either ab
solutely or in their purchasing power and that
the aggregate volume of work to be done in this
country Is increased or even maintained; that
there are more or as many days' work in a year
at as good or better wages for the American
workman as has been the case under the pro
tective system every one will rejoice. A gen
eral process of wage reduction cannot be con
templated by any patriotic citizen without the
gravest apprehension. It may be. Indeed, I
believe is, possible for the American
manufacturer to compete successfully with his
foreign rival In many branches of production
without the defense of protective duties, if the
pay rolls are equalized: but the conflict that
stands between the producer and that result
and the distress of the people, when It Is at
tained, are not pleasant to contemplate. The
society of the unemployed, now holding its fre
quent and threatening parades in the streets of
foreign cities, should not be allowed to acquire
an American domicile
Halation With Foreign Power.
Our relations with other nations are now un
disturbed by any serious controversy. The
complicated and threatening differences with
Germany and England relating to Samoan
affairs, with England in relation to the seal
fisheries in the Bchrlng sea and with Chili
growing out of the Baltimore affair have leen
adjusted.
There have been negotiated and concluded
under section 3 of the tariff law commercial
agreements relating to reciprocal trade with
the lollowlnff countries: Hrtuil TVimlnWn

eluded since my last annual message. Under
tnese iraue arrangements, a free favored ad
mission has been secured In every case for an

care has been taken to secure murker tnr farm

lying industry oi tne depression which the lack
of an adequate foreign market for our surplus
often brings. An opening has also been made
for mm: itfactured products that will undoubt
edly, II this policy is maintained, greatly aug
ment unr export trade. The full benefits of
these a rangemcuts cannot be realized Instant
ly. The fullowlng statistics show the Increase in
our trade with the countries with whli-h u-
have reciprocal trade agreements from the date
wnen sucn agreements went into effect up to
September 30, 1892, the increase being In some
almost wholly and In others in an important de
gree the result of these agreements:
The domestic exports to Germany, Austria
and Hungary have increased in value from N7,
673,756 to io7,993.064, an increase of 110,319,
308. With American countries our ex
ports have increased from M4,1CJ,2S5 to
51.613,593, an Increase of 110,458,313. or 23.87 per
cent. The total increase In the value of exports
to all the countries with which wo have reci
procity agreements has been t3,'BS,L This
increase is chiefly in wheat, flour, meal and
dairy products, and manufatures of Iron and
steel and lumber. There has been a Uuye in
crease in the value of imports from all these
countries since the commercial agreements
went into effect amounting to 174,234.525, but It
has been entirely in imports from the American
countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee.
India rubber and crude drugs. The hlarmcd
attention of our European competitors for the
South American market has been attracted to
this new American policy and to our acquisi
tion and their loss of South American trade.
THE Ari'AIH WITH H1LI.
Congress at the last session was advised of
the progress of the threatening differences
with the republic of Chili. It gives me now great
gratification to report that the Chilian govern
ment in a most friendly and honorable spirit,
has tendered and paid as an indemnity to
the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who
were killed and to those who were injured in
the outbreak in the city of Valparaiso the sum
of 175,000. This has been accepted, not only as
an indemnity for a wrong done, but as a most
gratifying evidence that the government of
Chill rightly appreciates the disposition of this
government to act in a spirit of absolute fair
ness and friendliness in our intercourse with
that brave people. A further and conclusive
evidence of the mutual respect and confidence
now existing is furnished by the faot that a
convention submitting to arbitration the mu
tual claims of the citizens of the respective
governments has boen agreed upon. Some of
these claims have been pending for many years
and have been the occasion of much unsatis
factory diplomatic correspondence.
OTHER FOREIGN HITTERS.
Our relations with Hawaii have been such as
to attract an increased interest and must con
tinue to do so. I deem it of great importance that
the projected submarine cable, a survey for
which has been made, should be promoted both
for naval and commercial uses. Wo should have
quick communication. Wo should before have
availed ourselves of the conoesslon, made nuny
years ngo to this government for a harlmr and
naval station at Tearl river. Many evidences
of the friendliness of the Hawaian government
have been given in the past and it Is gratifying
to believe that the advantage and necessity of
a continuance of very close relations is appre
ciated. The friendly act of this fovernment in ex
pressing to the government of Italy Its repro
bation and abhorrence of the lynching of Ital
ian subjects In New Orleans by the payment of
125,000 francs, or 121,330.93, was accepted br the
king of Italy with every manifestation of grate
ful appreciation, and the incident has been
highly promotive of mutual respect and goal
wilL
In consequence of the action of the French
government in proclaiming a protectorate over
certain tribal districts of the west coast of
Africa, eastward of the San Pedro river,
I have felt constrained to make protest
against this encroachment upon the territory
of a republic which was founded by citizens of
the United States and toward which this coun
try has for many years held the intimate rela
tion of a friendly counsel.
The recent disturbances of the public peace
by lawless foreign marauders on the Mexican
frontier have afforded the government an op
portunity to testify its good will toward Mexico
and its earnest purpose to fulfill its obligations
of international friendship by pursuing and dis
persing the evil doers. The work of relocating
the boundary of the treaty of Guadalupe Hi
dalgo westward from El Paso is progressing
favorably.
THE MONETARY CONFERENCE.
Congress has already been advised that the
invitations of the government for the assemb
ling of an International monetary conference to
consider the question of an enlarged issue of
silver was accepted by the nations to which
they were issued. The oonference assembled
at Brussels on the 22nd of November, and has
entered upon the consideration of this great
question. I have not doubted, and have taken
occasion to express that belief, as well in the
m nations issued tor this conference, as in my
public messages, that the free coinage of silver
Upon an agreed international ratln vmilrf rr.t.
ly promote the interests of our people and
muaiiy mose or other nations. It Is too early
to predict what results may be accomplished by
the conference. If any temporary check or de
lay intervenes, I believe that very soon com
mercial conditions will compel the now reluct
ant governments to unite with us in this move
ment to secure the enlargement of the volume
of money needed for the transaction of the
business of the world.
Executive Department.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the secretary of the treasury
will attract special Interest in view of the many
misleading statements as have been made as to
the state of public revenues. Three preliminary
t acta should not only be stated but emphasized
before looking Into details: First that the
PUbUC debth&a iWn Mnnfd .1... u.u. i,
JO74.S0O, and the annual interest charges
ii,n,ju; secona, that there have been paid
out for pensions during- this administration on
up to November 1, 1892, 1432,564,178. 70, an excess
of 1114,466.306.09 over the sum expended during
the period from March l iton tn u..v t iswa.
and third, that under the existing1 tariff up to
December 1 about $93,000,000 of revenue, which
would have been collected upon imported sugars
If the duty had been maintained, has gone Into
the pockets of the people aud not Into the pub
lic treasury, as before. If there are any who
still think that the surplus should have been
kept out oi circulation by hoarding It In the
treasury, or depositing It In banks with
out interests while the government con
tinued to pay the very banks Interest,
upon the bonds deposited as security for the
deposits, or who think that the extended per
slon legislation was a publlo robbery, or that
the duty on sugar should hav been maintained,
I am content to leave the argument where It
now rests, while we wait to see whether these
criticisms will take the form of legislation.
The revenues of the fiscal year ending June
30, 1892, from all sources, ware H25,88,:oaS,
and the expenditures for all purposes were
1415.953,80151, leavings balance of N,tl4 453.64
There was paid during the year upon the pub
lic debt 140,570,467.98. The surplus In the treasury
and the bank redemption fund, passed by the
act of July 14, 1S9I, to the general fund, fur
nlshed In large part, the cash available and
used for the payments made upon the publlo
debt Compared with the year 1891, our re
ceipts from customs duties fell off tl2,069,:i.O8,
while our receipts from Internal revenue In
creased 18,284,8:3.13. leaving the net loss of
revenue from these principal sources 133,74,.
417.95. The net loss of revenue from all sources
was R2,675,9rtBl.
The revenues, estimated and actual, for the
year ending June 30, 1893, are placed by the
secretary at 8463, 130, 350. 44, and the expendi
tures at (451,333,350.41. showing a surplus of
reeetpts over expenditures of j2.00u.uju. The
cash balance In the treasury at the end of the
fiscal year, It is estimated, will be 123,942, .ST .01.
So far as these figures are based on estimates
of receipts and exnendltures fnr th remain!,.
months of tho current fiscal year, there are
not only the usual elements of uncertainty but
some added elements. New revenue legislation,
or even the expectation of It, may seriously re
duce the public revenues during the period of
uncertainty and during the press of business
adjustment to the new conditions when tbey
become known. But tho secretary has verj
wisely refrained from guessing as to the effect
of possible clunges in sur revenue laws, since
the scope of tho.se changes snd the time of their
taking effect cannot In any degree be forecast
or foretold by him. His estimates must be
b:ied upon existing laws and upon a eontinu
o.iceof existing business conditions except so
far as these conditions maf bo affected by
causes other than new legislation.
The estimated receipts for the fiscal year
June 3d, 1S93, are W9i),12l,365 33. and the esti
mated appropriations 1457,201.835.33, leaving an
estimated surplus of receipts over the ex
penditures of 32,3ilj,030.05. This does not In
clude any parmeut to the sinking fund. In the
recommendation of the secretary that the sink
ing fund law be repealed I concur. Tho re
demption of bonds since the passage of the law
to June 3), 1852, has already exceedcJ the re
quirements by Hie sum of 1W),o10,1.19. The
retirement of bonds In the future before ma
turity should be a matter of convenience, not of
compulsion. We should not collect revenue for
that purpose, but only use any casual surplus
To the balance of 3.8tH,03..u5 of receipts ovct
expenditures for the year 1894 should be added
the estimated surplus nt the begin
ning of the year. t2H.9J2,377.(i3. and from this
agpregato there must be deducted, as stated by
the secretary, about 44. 000,000 of estimated un
expended appropriations.
The public confidence In the purpose and abil
ity of the government to maintain tho parity of
all our money Issues, whether coin or paper,
must remain unshaken. The demand for gold
iu Europe and the consequent calls upon us
are In a considerable degree the result of the
efforts of some of the European government
to increase their gold reserves, and these ef
forts should be met by appropriations upon our
part The conditions that have created this
drain of the treasury gold are in an Important
degree political and not commercial. In view
of the fact that s general revision of our rev
cnue laws in the near future seems to be
probable It would be better that any changes
should be a part of that revision rather than of
a temporary nature.
During the last fiscal year the secretary pur
chased under the act of July 14, 1890, 54,335,748
ounces of silver and Issued In payment thereof
nl.10S.6u8 in notes. The total purchases since
tho passage of the act have been 123,479,981
ounces and the aggregate of notes issued,
8116,783,593. The average price paid for
silver during the year was 1'4 cents per"
ounce, the highest price being tl.02
July 1, 1891. and the lowest 10.83 March 21, 1892.
In view of the fact that the monetary confer
ence Is now sitting and that no conclusion has
as yet been reached I withhold any recommen
datlon upon this subject
THE WAR OFFICE.
The report of tho secretary of war brings
again to the attention of congress some Impor
tant suggestions as to the reorganization of
tho Infantry and artillery arms of the service,
which his predecessors have before urged that
they be pressed Our army Is small but its or
ganization should all the more be put upf) the
most approved modern basis. The conditions
upon what we have called the "frontier" have
heretofore required the maintenance of many
small posts, bur now the policy of concentra
tion Is obviously the right one. The now posts
should havo the proper stragetic relations to
the only 'frontiers" we now have, those of the
seacoast and of the northern part of our south
ern boundary. 1 do not think that anv miMtlnn
of advantage in localities, or states, should de
termine tne location oi tne new posts. The
organization and enlanremant nf tlm human nt
military information which the secretary has
euccieu is a worn tne usefulness of which will
become every year more apparent The work of
building heavy guns and tho construction of
coast defenses has been well begun and should
be carried on without check.
JUSTICE.
The report of the attorney-general is
by law submitted directlr
but I cannot refrain from saying that he

The p -port of the postmaster general shows
a most gratifying Increase and a most efficient
and progressive management of the great busi
ness n( that department The remarkable In
crease In revenues In the number of post office
and In the miles of mail Interchange furnishes
further evidence of the h!uh state of prosperity
whlrh our people are enjo.-lug. New otters
m-an new hamlets, towns, routes mean the
extension of our border settlements, and In
creased revenue mean active commerce. The
postmssU-rgeneral reviews the whole period
of his administration of the office and brings
some of his statistic down to the month of
Novemter last The postal revenues have In
creased during the last year nearly IaOJO.OUJ.
The deficit for the year ending June 30, 1892, Is
1818,341 less than the deficiency of the preced
ing year. The deficiency of the preseut fiscal
year It Is estimated will be reduced to 11,752,423,
which will not only be extinguished during the
next fiscal year, but a surplus of nearly 11,000,
OOOihould there be shown.
In these calculations the payments to be made
under the contracts for ocean mall service
have not been Included. There have been added
1,590 new mail routes during the year with a
mileage of 8,863 miles, and the total number of
new miles of mall trips added during the year
I nearly 17,00 t.Oua The number of miles of
mail journeys added during the last four years
Is about 7t,0u0,0X), this addition being 21,000,000
of miles more than there were in operation In
the whole country In 1MCL
The number of post offices has been Increased
by 2,790 during the year, and during the past
four years aud up to October 29 last, the total
increase of the number of offices has been near
ly l.OXii The number of free delivery offices
has been nearly doubled In the past four years
and the number of money order offices more
than doubled with that time. For three years
ended June 30, 1892, the postage revenue
amounted to (198,744,359. which was an Increase
of 152,283, 159 over the revenue for three year
ended June 30, 18-8, the increase during the
last three years being more than three and a half
times as great as the Increase during the
three years ended June 30, 1888 No such in
crease as that shown for these three years has
ever previously appeared in the revenues of the
department The postmaster-general has ex
tended to the post offices in the larger cities
the merit of promotion, Introduced by my di
rection, into the departments here, and it has
resulted there, as In the departments, in a large
volume of work, and that better done.
Ever since our merchant marine was driven
from the sea by the rebel cruisers during the
warof the rebellion, the United States has been
paying an enormous annual tribute to foreign
countries In the shape of freight and passenger
moneys, our grain and meats have been taken
at our own docks and o ir large impjrts there
laid down by foreign shipmasters. An Increas
ing torrent of American travel to Europe has
contributed a vast sum annually to the divi
dends of foreign ship owners. The balance of
trade shown by the books of our
custom houses has ben largely reduced
snd in many years altogether extinguished
by this constant strain. In the year 1892
only 123 per cent of our Imparts were brought
In American vessels. The foreign steamships
maintained by our traffic are mtny of them un
der contract with their respective governments
by which In time of war they will become a
part of their armed naval establishments.
Profiting by our commerce In peace, they will
become the most formidable destroyers of our
commerce In time of war. I felt and have be
fore expressed the feeling that this condition of
things was loth Intolerable and disgraceful A
wholesome change of policy aud having so much
promise as it w-ems to me, was begun by the
law of March 3, 189L Under this law contracts
have been made by the postmaster general for
eleven mail routes Tbe expenditure involved
by these contracts for the next fiscal year ap
proximated 1954, 12133. As one of the good re
sults reached, sixteen American ships of an ag
gregate tonnage of 57,400 tons, costing 17,000.000,
have been built or contracted to be built In
American ship yards.
The estimated tonnage of all steamships re
quired under existing contracts is 165,802, and
when tho full service required by these con
tracts Is established there will be forty-one
mail steamers under the American flag, with
the probability of further necessary additions
in the Brazilian and Argentine service. The
contracts recently let for Transatlantic servlco
will result In the construction of Ave ships of
10,000 tons each, costing 19,000,000 or Il0.ouo.000.
and wiU add, with the City of New York and
the City of Paris, to which the treasury depart
ment was authorized by legislation at the last
session to give American registry, seven of the
swiftest vessels upon the sea to our naval re
serve. The contracts made with the lines sail
ing to Central and South American porta have
Increased the frequency and shortened the time
of the trips, added new ports of call and sus
tained some lines that otherwise would almost
certainly have been withdrawn. The service to
Buenos Ayres is the first to the Argentine re
public under the American flag. The service to
Southampton, Boulogne and Antwerp Is also
new, and Is tobe begun with the steamships City
of New York and City of Paris in February next
I earnestly urge a continuance of tbe policy In
augurated by this legislation and that the ap
propriations required to meet the obligations
of the government under tho contracts
may be promptly made so that the lines
that have entered into these engagements
may not be' embarrassed. We have had by
reason of connections with the trans-continental
railway lines constructed through our
own territory some advantages that we did not
possess on the Atlantic The construction of
the Canadian Paclflo railway and the estab
lishment under large subventions from Canada
and England of fast steamship service from
Vancouver with Japan and China, seriously
threaten ourihipplng interests In the Pacific.
This line of English steamers received, as
stated by the commissioner of navigation, a
direct subsidy of UOJ.OJ0 annually, or 120,760
per trip for thirteen voyages, in addition to
some further aid from the admiralty in connec
tion with contracts by which the vessels may
be used for naval purposes. The competing
American Paclflo Mall line, under the act of
March 3, 1891, receives only (6,389 per round
trip.
Efforts have been making within the last
year, as I am informed, to establish under
similar conditions, a line between Vancouver
and some Australian port with a view of secur
ing there a trade in which we have had a large
Interest The commissioner of navigation
states that a very large per cent of our imports
from Asia are now brought to us by English
steamships and their connecting railways In
Canada With a view of promoting this trade,
especially in tea, Canada has imposed a dis
criminating duty of 10 per cent on tea and cof
fee brought Into the dominion from the United
States. If this unequal contest between Amer
ican lines without subsidy, or with diminished
subsidies, and the English Canadian line to
which I have referred is to continue, I think
we should at least see that the facilities for
customs entry and transportation across our
territory are not such as to make the Canadian
route a favored one, and that the discrimina
tion as to duties, to which I have referred, is
met by a like discrimination as to the
Importation of these articles from Canada.
No subject, I think, more nearly touches the
powerand prosperity of our country than this of
the development of our merchant marine upon
the sea. If we could enter Into conference with
other competitions and all would agree to with
hold government aid, we could perhaps take our
chances with the rcstbutour great competitors
hare established and maintained their lines by
government subsidies until now they have prac
sliy excluded us from participation. In my
opinion, no choice Is left us but to put the issue,
moderately at least, on tbe same lines.

hibits grea,t progress In the construction of our
new navy. When the present secretory entered
upon his duties only three modern steel vessels
were In commission. The vessels since put In

JUAN PONCE DE LEON.
Bis 8treh for the FanaUla el Tooth dd4
Hi Tragte End f Ufa,
A very Interesting' character is Juan
Ponce do Leon, partly because he was a
bold sailor and intimately connected
with Columbus, and partly because he
lost his life in the delusive hope that he
could find in Florida the famous foun
tain of youth. It is superfluous to add
that since his day a number of lives
have been sacrificed in the same quest
Juan Ponce was born in Leon. Spain,
about 140. He sailed with Columbus
on his second voyage in 1493, and was
prominent in the later subjugation of
Porto Rico, of which he became gov
rrnor. During the exploration in tha
West Indies the Spaniards had heard
rumors of a wonderful spring1 or foun
tain in a northern island, which pos
sessed remarkable curative properties.
"It iscertainsaid Herrera, the Span
ah historian, "that Juan Ponce de
Leon, besides intending to make new
(liscoveries, as all the Spaniards at that
time aspired to do, was also Intent on
finding the fountain of Bimini and a
river in Florida; the Indians of Cuba and
Espanola affirming that old people bathing-
themselves In them became young
again, and it was a fact that many In
dians of Cuba, firmly believing that
tbvre was such a stream, had found that
island not long before the Spaniards
and had passed over to Florida in search
of the river and there built a town,
where their descendants reside to this
dsy. This report so affected all the
princes and caciques in those parts that
It was a hobby to find a river which
wrought such a wonderful change as
made old people young, so that there
was not a river or a brook, scarcely a
lake or a puddle in all Florida in which
they did not bathe themselves."
Peter Martyr listened to the rumor
and wrote to Home, "beseeching your
Holiness not to think that this is said
jestingly or thoughtlessly." According
to Martyr's map the fountain was sit
uated somewhere in the island called
ItiminL Juan Fonce was impressed
with the idea that he could recover his
youth (he was then about fifty-two
years of age) by bathing in this foun
tain, aud at the same time discover the
part of the Island in which it was
thought to be. So he fitted out three
ships and sailed from Porto Rico in
March, 1512. On April 2 he sighted
what he took to be an island, with
green groves and a beautiful landscape.
This he called La Florida. Attempting
to land, the explorers were attacked by
Indians and thereafter during their
coasting they met frequent attacks.
Late in September Juan Ponce returned
to Porto Rico, having found no trace of
the wonderful spring, but confident of
the value of his discovery.
From Spain he obtained the appoint
ment of governor of Bimini and Flor
ida, and in 1531 started to conquer and
occupy the country. The natives re
sisted valiantly and Juan Ponce was
wounded by an arrow in the thigh. He
thereupon gave up the conflict and
tailed for Cuba, whero he died from the
effects of his wound.
The claim that Ponce de Leon discov
ered Florida baa been vigorously op
posed. John Flake writes:
"Aa the history of tho discovery of
America has usually been written,
Florida was first visited by Ponce de
Leon on Easter Sunday, 1512, and a
superficial observer might not be sur
prised at seeing the Florida coast laid
down on a map first published in 1513;
perhaps, too, it might not occur to him
that the peculiar names on these coasts
are not derived from the explorations
that began with Ponce de Leon. But
now, while on the one hand it has late
ly been proven that Ponce de Leon did
not see Florida until Easter Sunday,
1513, on the other hand the map of the
1518 Ptolemy was certainly made before
1508, and the comparison with the Can
tino map proves it to have been drawn
from an original as old as 1502 and
probably older. It follows, therefore,
with the force of absolute demonstra
tion that tbe coasts of Florida were ex
plored and the insularity of Cuba de
tected before 1503. There is no possible
escape from this conclusion." X. Y.
