Senator Kenney is reported to ire the subject of secret

cussed. That is queer. Evidently the Senator is not popular.
The Smyrna Call, of Smyrna, formerly the Clayton Call, of Ciay
ton, came to us yesterday for the first time. It is a bright and newsy
sheet and promises to he a profitable addition to the community ol

IT is a very old story, that story of millions awaiting an Amer
ican owner in Europe, and generally the crafty invention of some
sharper. But the tale that comes from Kokomo, Iud., of a relative
dying and leaving his distant cousins a trifle of S3,000,000 has the
decided merit of novelty.

The Administration's policy is lo postpone any

serve by disclosing larger limits of human endurance, but whether
they are worth what they cost in distress, wasted energy

The President declared in bis message that we were constrained
by every consideration of dignity and honor to ratify the Hawaiian
aunexation treaty. But the treaty appears to be dead. Its friends
confess tn.it they cannot get two-thirds of the Senators to vote for
it. If the treaty fui s the promoters of the job will have recourse to

This month a learned professor teds us th it the Irishman is prac
tically an Italian, and an eminent German tries to teach Americans
how to be free. Meantime a Hungarian Parliament is conducting
itself with propriety and dignity, while a brother Parliament, con
sisting of Aryans, is so discordant as to be unable to do business.
A the same time an Australian Legislature is considering an act
that will exclude a large class of American citizens as undesirable
immigrants. Clearly the world is upside down.
The fight against the President on the merit system was prompt
ly opened in the House on the very first day of debate by Mr. Mc

Grosvetior. What a grotesque spectacle it is ! litre is the Presi

The Czechs and the Germans of the Austrian Empire, both of
which races claim to be Aryans, are just now displaying their in

revolution when they cannot have their own way, and both resoit
