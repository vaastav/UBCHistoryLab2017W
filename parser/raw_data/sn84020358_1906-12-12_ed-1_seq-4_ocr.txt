; There Is still money in farming. A
sixty-etght-acre lot of abandoned land
In Pennsylvania was bought last spring
for $1,700. On twenty acres of it 4,300
buBhels of potatoes were raised this sea
son, which sold for $2,400.
Under the heading "Numerical Co
incidences," the Milwalkee Free Press
writes: "Three hundred is the number
of the colored troopers dischareed un
heard "by President Roosevelt; and 300
Is the number of good English words
put out of service, also without a
hearing or a word of protest until the
deed was done."
Sir Thoma3 Llpton says: "I have
traveled In practically all the civilized
countries of the world and do not hes
itate to assert that, whether in a hotel,
a railroad train, a street car or any
where else, there Is no place in the
world where a woman Is safer, more
respected or better protected than in
the United States." This, perhapa It
will be noticed, includes Fair Haven.
These are Inquisitive times. A snail's
rate of travel was ascertained by ex
periments in Florence. Half a dozen
snails were permitted to crawl between
two points ten feet apart. Exact time
was kept from the start to the finish,
' and thus the average pace was learn
ed. . The figures were then put Into
tables of feet, yards and furlongs, and
it was found that it would take a
snail exactly fourteen days to travel a
mile.
Paraflln wax models of all proposed
British battleships are used by the Ad
miralty for teste before the keels of
the ships are laid down, the miniatures
being tested In a great tank. The
models are from twelve to twenty
four feet long, the tank being 400 feet
long and twenty feet wide. The mod
els are made of wax because it Is a
material which does not absorb water
or change its weight, so that altera
tions can 'be easily made, and the ma
terial can be melted up and u?ed
asaln. The American naval authori
ties also have models of all their hulls
constructed, but these are much more
elaborate than the British, being form
ed of white pine and fitted with rud
ders, false keels, propeller shafts and
nil etcetras.
' In a letter to the Lancet Dr. Ranking,
of Oxford, tells of the use of frog skin
for grafting. "For more than twenty
years," says the physician, "the frog
has furnished me with grafts In all
cases requiring such treatment. My
first use of it was in my own case. I
had suffered for nearly three years
from obstinate ulceration of the skin of
the foot, which had resisted all treat
ment and steadily refused to heal. I
began using grafts of frog skin li the
middle of January, 1885, and in less
than six weeks had a sound covering of
skin. At the present time, more than
twenty years having elapsed, the cica
trix Is perfectly sound, and has none of
the puckering and stiffness so often
seen in cicatrices where human grafts
have been used." Dr. Ranking was so
encouraged by this result that he used
frog skin in every case of the kind aft
er that, and -at a rough estimate must
have used it in some three hundred or
four hundred cases.
"Who is the little man talking to the
political boss over there?"
"That's Justasgood, the druggist."
"What does he want?"
"He wants to have the prohibition
Jaw passed by the next legislature."
"But how can that benefit him?"
"Eh! Didn't I juet tell you he was a
druggist?" Cleveland Plain Dealer.

NOT XX A CIL T A I U I K
These are interesting days, and we
are slowly finding out what's what and
who's who. A grand Jury Jn Danville,
Virginia, that found an indictment
against a miniature combination of
coal and wood dealers ."engaged in
criminal conspiracy to Interfere with
the trade of the citizens of Danville"
was unable to return a true bill against
a so-called lawyers' trust, otherwise
the Danville Bar Association, which
was similarly charged with being an
unlawful combination. The fact chat
an agreement exists among the. local
attorneys to control legal fees and that
fixes a minimum scale for services is
not disputed, but it is held that' legal
steps for breaking up the conspiracy
could not be taken because the trust
does not deal in the necessities of, life.
Is law a luxury? Many who have
had experience with It don't seem to
think so.
lei's xrr THEM J.V.
The President sent another message
to congress yesterday, and it was 6uch
a short one that everybody can and
many will read it. In his long message
the other day he said American citizen
ship should be conferred on the citizens
of Porto Rico. Now he says it again in
the following winged words: I most
earnestly hope that this will be done.
I cannot see how any harm can possi
bly result from it, and it seems to me a
matter of right and justice to the peo
ple of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they
are glad to be under our flag, they are
making rapid progress along the path
or orderly liberty. Surely we should
show our appreciation of them, our
pride in what they have done, and our
pleasure In extending recognition for
what has been done, by granting them
full American citizenship.
The Porto Ricans have certainly be
haved well and shown themselves ap
preciative of our benevolence and
beneficence. There 'doesn't seem to be
any good reason why they should not
be good Americans In fact as well as in
behavior. Let's grant them the grand
est privilege on earth.
SOWH BLIXD JUSTICE.
A recent occurrence in Warsaw indi
cates that justice there is sometimes
pretty blind. Frank Rowokowski was
arrested and charged with having com
mitted a crime of which he said he was
guiltless. At the hearing witnesses said
that he had committed the deed, and
he was promptly convicted. Two weeks
later he was brought to court again, ac
cording to the custom of the land, to
hear the ''reasons for the sentence."
Before going to court he' agreed to ex
change places with another prisoner,
and 'to demonstrate how easy It was to
punish an innocent man. Luclan Zim
ny, with whom he changed places, had
been accused of theft, and when the
name was called Rowokowski came for
ward. A woman looked at the prison
er and swore that he was the culprit,
although he appeared to be somewhat
stouter than he was v.'hen she saw him
last. Two other witnesses testified
against him, and when he was asked
what defense he could offer the man
explained the situation. The fate of
the prisoners Is not told, but a report
er recommends the Rowokowski case
to the "consideration of judges who lis
ten to witnesses."
This ought to be an eye-opener to the
judge most concerned, and to other
judges as well.
THE TTSMAllRttSG 6I1I1.S.
Now the talk Is on again that college
women don't marry enough, or, to be
more precise, that enough of them don't
marry. William L. Felter, an educator
of Brooklyn, thinks that girls don't get
the right education in their colleges.
He thinks the courses In women's col
leges have been too closely patterned
after those of institutions for men. He
insists that the women's colleges are
maintained for the direct benefit of a
small minority, the peculiarly gifted
the future authors, musicians, painters
and teachers while, the majority pur
sue the identical courses, with no spe
cific modifications looking to their ac
tual destiny wifehood and motherhood.
Mr. Felter would have the main aim of
study for girls In high schools and col
leges "the cultivation of health.
Healthfulness and holiness are synony
mous." Mathematics, which he consid
ers a severe strain on the average girl
or woman if shs does It well, he would
teach only in Its rudiments. Some
household chemistry he recommends,
with elementary physics, largely de
scriptive. A little physical geography,
geology,, astronomy and botany would
be included, while 2oology and morph
ology are emphasized, sociology and
political economy should find their
place, and art in all its forms should
not be overlooked. Mr. Felter suspends
judgment on the elimination of ancient
tongues, but urges abundant study of
English and other modern languages,
especially conversation. He adds ped
agogy, child study and nursing.
Right enough as far as It. goes per
haps, but how can educated girls be
fairly expected to marry the kind of
men that are lying around with em
phasis on the lying? Furthermore,
how can uneducated girls be expected
to? Let us have some talk about mak

Theirs not to quarrels pick.
Theirs but to skiddoo quick
Into the document print
Went the three hundred.
Departments to right of them,
Departments to left of them,
Congress in front of them,
Scolded and thundered;
Storm'd at with words of scorn.
Lambasted and left forlorn.
Into the printing press,
Into the Message, shorn,
Went the three hundred.
Departments to right of them,
Departments to left of them,
Congress hot after them,
Scolded and thundered.
Chased from the Capitol,
Bundled out one and all,
Back to the way to spell
None was there left to tell
The fate of three hundred.
Thus did their glory fade,
Oh, what a fuss they made-
All the world wondered.
Hooray for the stunt they tried,
Hooray for the Simplified,
Noble three hundred.

THE MAKING AND SHARING OF
FORTUNES.
The late. Russell Sage entered Wall
street at the age of fifty and left a
fortune of about eighty millions for
Mrs Sage to distribute. At an age
when most people prefer leisure, she
has put upon herself a task which was
meant in all kindness, but is after all
one of the most trying and disappoint
ing which one at any age can under
take. The business of accumulating riches
j The Value of a Gift
is not only measured by its
intrinsic worth, but by the dis
play of taste and judgment in
selection.

is one thing; the task of distributing
it so that it may do less harm than
good is another. Of the twp tasks, the
former is undoubtedly the easier of
the two. The hard-headed business
man has simply to organize his re
sources and keep multiplying his op
erations, and his results are sure, un
der ordinary conditions, to turn out
advantageously. But when jit conies to
breaking : up accumulated millions
among those who are worthy, there
are few who are prepared to do it
Justly to all concerned.
The parties concerned are not sim
ply the donor and the recipient. The
community has a right to exemption
from a distribution of wealth which
demoralizes the spirit of Industry and
frugality, because, as Poor Richard
was wont to say, these lead to wealth
And self-earned cents are, as a rule
better than donated dollars.
Any distribution of a fortune which
puts a premium on indolence is de
moralizing. Whether It be the gilded
youth, the lazy glutton, or the "ramb
ling rake of poverty." who receives it,
the effect is much the same. Honest
industry, modest living and a share
in the essential duties of citizenship
are all weakened wherever the oppo
site vices are fostered by unwise di
vision of wealth.
It may not be wise to enact any
more lav3 on this matter just now.
But popular thought should not de
ceive Itself into thinking that any
kind of distribution is a good thine.
Many of them are not only not good
uses of wealth, but are positively
nuisances to the community.,
This is one of the dangers of the
present time. The ideal distribution
of a fortune whether great or small
should look to a greater equalization
of riches, and at the same time pre
serve rather than imperil all that is
best in individual worthiness. From
the Wall Street Journal.
CHRISTMAS AT THE GERMAN
PALACE.
The Bescheerung (as the distribu
tion of gifts under the spreading
Christmas tree Is called in Germany)
Is divided into two parts. First comes
one for the members of the Imperial
household, from the meanest kitchen
scullion upwards, and this takes
place in a large gallery of tho Neues
Palais. Hundreds of small tables are
placed there, each covered with pres
ents, and thef whole scene Is dominat
ed by a Christmas tree, a perfect
giant of Its kind, and magnificently
Vivid with Its -myriad of vari-colored
candles, stars and crescents of gold
and silver, crystal icicles, iridescent
snowballs, 'and hundreds of other
glittering baubles. Each and every
one of the -servants, higher and
lower officials is spoken to personally
by Kaiser and Kalserin, and the me
rltorious old servitors are slapped on
the shoulder and greeted with a few
kindly phrases. The bowing and
scraping, hand-kissing and formal
expressions of thanks, having at last
come to a close, the second part of
Bescheerung takes place.
That Is the one exclusive for the
Imperial family themselves. It always
takes place In the Muschelsaal that
immense hall In the Neues Palais,
the decoration of which Is In mother-of-pearl
and beautiful sea-shells and
clusters of coral of every kind. For
this evening the hall is bordered on
each side by evergreens, holly, and

mistletoe, forming two graceful hedges
wherein dark green Is enlivened
by scarlet berries, making a fine ef
fect, A beautiful little structure re
presentative of the manger, showing
the Christ-child, the Virgin Mother,
and the shepherd kings in adoration,
is set up in a corner of the hall. This
is always the special tawk of the Kai
ser himself.
When the Bescheerung Is in full
blast, everywhere are heard cries of
"Oh!" and "Ah!" Delight; surprise,
and gratitude on all sides. (Mother
and father smothered under a shower
of kisses, their children running to
and fro, inspecting breathlessly newly
unearthed treasures or eyeing those
of brother and sister. Most captivat
ing the : stern Kaiser is then. Stand
ing before his own "lay-out," he
shows all the boyish good-nature and
curiosity of his sons-poking his nose
into this box or that case, making
pretence of being unable to untie a
parcel wrapped up with particular
cunning, glancing through some new
books or a portfolio of rare prints,
smiling, laughing, and shouting and
being a child again among children.
