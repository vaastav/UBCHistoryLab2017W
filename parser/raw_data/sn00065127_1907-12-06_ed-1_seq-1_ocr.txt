formal Announcement of His Candidacy for the United States
Senate and Platform Upon Which He Asks Support
of those Who ^favor Government
by the People.
SENATOR KITTREDGE MUST- FACE THE ISSUE AND DEFEND
HIS RECORD AS A MACHINE BOSS.
The LEADER takes pleasure in pre
senting Governor Crawford's an
nouncement as candidate for the
United States senate to succeed Sen
ator Klttredge, which should meet
the hearty approval of all who believe
in a government ol the people:
"I shall appeal direct to the voters
and accept their decision under the
new primary flection law held next
une. If the majority of the votescast
at the republican primaries held
throughout the state under that law
favors the re-election of Senator Klt
tredge, that will end the matter so far
as I am concerned. If, on the other
hand, that majority is expressed in my
favor, the members of the legislature
nominated throughout the state at the
republican primaries will be thereby
instructed to vote for and in good
faith to support me as their party can
didate for this high office, at the fol
lowing session of the legislature the
obligation to respect the popular vote
being as binding in this case as it is
in the cases ot presidential electors. I
am sure the republicans of the state
will expect a public pledge from Sena
tor Kittredge that he will accept*the
decision of the majority at the pri
maries as binding upon tnem.
"The real issue in the coming con
test is not personal. It goes far be
yond the mere claims of candidates
and involves a difference of attitude
and conviction concerning certain
principles and certain political meth
ods and practices.
'Neither Senator Kittredge nor my
self has an inherent right to the of
fice of United States senator or any
other office. Those who insist that, I
shall be a candidate are not satisfied
with the attitude of Senator Kittredge
and his partisans toward the reform
measures that have been involved in
political contentions in this state for
several years. In the sharply defined
Issues that have arisen between the
people and corporations, they believe
that the senator and his special politi
cal friends and lieutenants have been
on the side of the corporations. They
are not satisfied with the jposition tak
en by the senator and his followers
upon the measures urged by President
Roosevelt, granting power to the In
ter-State Commerce commission to fix
maximum rates for railway corpora
tions in cases where the existing rates
are shown to be excessive and provid
ing that the orders of the commission
become effective at once and remain
in force until reversed upon appeal to
the courts and upon other -measures
urged b^, the president for the super
vision and control of great corpora
tions and trusts engaged in inter-state
commerce.
PEOPLE NOT SATISFIED.
'•They are not satisfied with the sen
ator's action in opposing the proposal
that the physical valuation of the rail
way properties be ascertained by the
government for use in determining the
reasonableness of rates charged by
them. They hold the senator and his
lieutenants responsible for the abuse
of the power which they acquired in
the party organization and which they
made subservient to the public service
corporations doing business in the
state.
"They believe that if Senator Kit
tredge is re-elected and with his old
lieutenants placed in control of the
republican party, we shall go back to
the old political methods the railway
influence will again dominate the leg
islature and party conventions the
reform laws passed last winter will be
destroyed by repeal or amendment.
"They do not believe that the sena
tor is in sympathy with the aroused
sentiment of the people which has
checked the political power of corpor
ations by means of primary election
laws, anti-pass laws, laws making se
cret lobbying for corporations and spe
cial interests a crime requiring cam
paign committees and candidates to
make a public statement of campaign
expenses: prohibiting corporations
from making contributions for politi
cal purposes destroying tfye power of
the boss and divorcing railway com
panies from politics. Can it be suc
cessfully maintained that they have
no substantial ground for these objec
tions to Mr. Kittredge as a candidate?
A brief reference to the record is not
out of place herp. It discloses—
"1. That on Apfril 26th, 1897, a Se
cret compact was entered into between
National Committeeman Mark Hanna
and Mr. Kittredge, attorney for the
Milwaukee Railroad company, and A.
C. Johnson, the general agent of the
Faithful LEADER In the Cant* of Economy and Reform, tko Defender of Truth and Jvetlee, tke Foe of Fraud and Oorrnptlon,
CANTON SOUTH DAKOTA FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1907.
GOVERNOR CRA WFORD 1
OUT &OR THE SENATE
Chicago & Northwestern Railway com
pany, by which Mr. Kittredge and Mr.
Johnson controlled the federal patron
age in this state, and that Mr. Hdnna,
pursuant to this agreement, filed writ
ten notice in Washington recognizing
these two men as above.
2. That during practically all the
time intervening and until the Sioux
Falls convention last year, Mr. Kitt
redge—first as national committeeman
and later as United. States senator—
was the recognized head of the repub
lican organization in this state and
with his personal friends and political
lieutenants controlled the party or
ganization, the state conventions and
the legislature, and that during all
these years not one single resolution
affecting the public service corpora
tions was adopted by a republican
state convention in South Dakota.
Resolutions favoring a change in the
law lor the assessment of corporations,
for the correction of the pass evil, and
for a state primary were introduced,
but were promptly suppressed.
'3. That during all these years not
one single statute opposed by public
service corporations was enacted by a
South Dakota legislature.
"4. The legislature of 1905 was in
the hands of the political friends of
Senator Kittredge and was controlled
by lieutenants who stood for the
things that he stood for. That legis
lature convened immediately after
President Roosevelt presented his
ringing message to congress in favor
of rate regulation. If Senator Kitt
redge was In sympathy with the posi
tion taken by the president, why did
his spokesmen and personal cham
pions in the legislature of 1905 refuse
repeatedly to etodorse the president's
policy?
RECORDS IN EVIDENCE. ./
The records show the following pro
ceeding in the legislature of 1905:
"Feb. 10. Mr. Lindley introduced
House Joint Resolution No. 12, en
dorsing President Roosevelt's efforts
to secure reform in railroad rate leg
islation. It was referred to the com
mittee on state affairs and never re
ported. (House Journal, pages 476,
480.)
Feb. 28. House Joint Resolution
memorializing congress to endorse and
assist President Roosevelt in his ef
forts to secure an equitable adjust
ment of transportation charges and
check unlawful encroachment of mon
opol istic trusts
and combinations came
to the senate and was referred to the
committee on rulek, of which Senator
Lawson, a devoted follower of Sena
tor Kittredge, was chairman. It was
never reported by that committee.
(House Journal, pages G27, 630, 875,
878. Senate Journal, page 945.)
Jan. 9. Senator Rice introduced
Senate Joint Resolution No. 9, memor
ializing congress to pass a law enlarg
ing the powers of the Inter-State Com
merce commission and to "keep the
highways of commerce open to all up
on equal terms." (Senate Journal,
page 119.) It was referred to the com
mittee on judiciary, of which this
same Senator Lawson was chairman.
(Page 119.) It was never reported.
"Feb. 17. Senator Cassili introduced
Senate Joint Resolution No. 13, re
questing the senators and representa
tives of South Dakota to sustain the
president of the United States in his
efforts to secure just and equitable
transportation charges. (Senate Jour
nal, page 546.) It was referred to the
committee on rules, of which Senator
Lawson was chairman. It was never
reported.
Feb. 1. Senator Shober introduced
Senate Bill No. 120, making railway
companies liable for injuries to an em
ployee caused by the negligence of a
co-employee while in the discharge of
a duty to his employer. (Senate Jour
nal, page 347.) It was referred to the
committee on railroads, of which Sen
ator Saltmarsh was chairman. (Page
350.) It was never reported.
A constitutional petition for the
enactment of a primary election law
and a referendum of the same to the
people for approval, signed by 8,884
electors was presented to the senate
and referred to the committee on
rules. On February 14, Senator Law
son presented a long report prepared
for him by a member of the railroad
lobby, recommending that it be in
definitely postponed, and the report
was adopted. (Senate Journal, pages
4(9, 520-1. '/yf'
AGAINST RATE BIL2.
"In the United States senate, Sena
tor Kittredge rifever declared in favor
-'"L'
v£"si
of the rate bill until its passage with
out his vote became apparent to all.
His personal newspaper organs in this
state openly opposed the passage of
the law for months while it was un
der debate.
'5. Senator Kittredge voted agalqst
the proposed amendment to the rate
bill, which provided for the ascertain
ment of the physical valuation of the
railroads as a basis for determining
whether rates charged by them were
excessive or not.
Last year, in a letter to Con
gressman Watson, President Roosevelt
referred to the obstacles interposed by
the railroads to the building of the
Panama canal and said their opposi
tion sometimes took the form of a
demand for an investment under cir
cumstances which would mean indefin
ite delay. Sometimes it takes the form
of determined opposition to the adop
tion of the plans which willanable the
work to be done, not merely in„ the
best, but in the quickest possible way'.'
The plan adopted by the government
is a look canal.
"Senator Kittredge wanted a sea
level canal, which would require twice
the time and 100 million dollars jnore,
and just before congress adjourned in
June, 1906. he attempted to pass a res
olution by the aid of democratic votes
in the canal committee, to continue
the investigation of complaints against
the canal management upon the isth
mus during the recess of congress.
The president complained in his letter
to Congressman Watson of 'sinister'
opposition and demands for investiga
tion which would mean indefinite de
lay.'
7. During all the years that the
Kittredge machine wa3 in power the
railroads in South Dakota paid the
lowest tax per mile In any state in the
union.
"6
RECORD OF 1907.
"8. The legislature of 1907 was free
from the railroad domination and free
from control by Senator Kittredge and
his friends Result.
"The enactment in one session of
the following laws affecting public ser
vice corporation:
"Requiring them to pay taxes upon
terminals and other property situated
withip cities and town: directing the
board of railroad commissioners to as
certain the cash value of the railroads
within the state and appropriating
money for that purpose making It un
lawful to destroy competition by un
just discrimination a state primary
election law: prohibiting corporations
from making contributions for cam
paign purposes making secret lobby
ing for corporations and special inter
ests a crime giving the board of rail
way commissioners power to examine
the books and accounts of public
warehousemen directing the board of
railroad commissioners by schedule to
fix maximum passenger iates at
2i
cents per mile compelling railroads
to put in connecting tracks at junction
points and do make joint rates re
quiring railroads to pay double dam
ages for unreasonable delay in making
settlement for damages to livestock or
property destroyed by fire making
railroad companies liable to employees
for damages caused by negligence of
co-employes limiting the continuous
hours of service of railway operatives
to 16 hours abolishing free passes.
"It promptly passed a joint resolu
tion endorsing the policies of the pres
ident in relation to transportation
charges and unlawful trusts and com
binations. But Parmley, the leader of
Senator Klttredge's friends in the
house voted against it. (House Jour
nal, pages 138, 298: Senate Journal,
page 375.)
"Undel1 the new railroad revenue
law, the state board of assessment in
creased the assessed valuation of the
railroads that were in the state last
year 34 per cent it more than doubled
the assessed valuation of the express
companies it materially increased the
assessed valuation of the Dakota Cen
tral telephone lines and the Western
Union Telegraph company. As a board
of equalization it adopted a ratio of
one-thhd of the actual value of all
property, and for the purpose of treat
ing all classes of property as nearly
alike as possible, it reduced the as
sessment of bank stocks from 50 per
cent .to 40 per cent, while real estate,
railroads, live stock, merchandise, and
all other property were' valued upon
the basis of 33 per cent.
"Every special appropriation made
for new buildings, with the exception
of the new capitol, was recommended
by the supervising boards and was
necessary.
A DIRECT CHALLENQE
"I am prepared to defend this rec
ord before any audience in the state
and challenge Senator Kittredge to
discuss all these issues in the open
with me.
"Did any one ever,hear him, or any
of his lieutenants, advocate any
of the
reforms enacted into law last winter?
"It is no answer to accuse us of in
consistency in opposing Senator Kit-
IP'
1. The policies and measures ad
vocated by President Roosevelt.
"2. The early completion of the
Panama canal according to the type,
and plans adopted by the administra
tion, and a comprehensive and perma
nent improvement of the Mississippi
river and its navigable tributaries, in
cluding the Missouri through this
state, so that the same may be effec
tive checks upon excessive railway
rates.
'3. A revision of tariff schedules by
placing lumber, coal and iron upon the
free list and in cases where the man
ufacture of an article is controlled by
a trust and competition in its produc
tion at home has been destroyed, I am
in favor of reducing the tarlff upon It
to a point that will permit foreign
competition.
"4. The ascertainment of the actual
value of railroads engaged in inter
state commerce, the limitation of is
sues of stock and bonds to bona fide
transactions, a uniform system of
bookkeeping and accounts, and the
regulation of rates, under the super
vision of the governmen t.
"5. Extension of federal control
over all corporations engaged in inter
state commerce, without impairing the
power of each state to regulate trade
beginning and ending within its bor
ders.
"6. A federal tax upon inheritances
and Incomes.
"7. A law piaking It a crime to lob
by in secret fbr special and corporate
interests with members ot the nation
al congress.
"8. A federal law to protect depos
itors in national banks and creating
postal savings banks.
"9. A law providing for greater
elasticity in the currency so that it
may be temporarily increased and
withdrawn without Injury to trade
"I am opposed to the unjust dis
crimination against the state by the
railroads coming into it from the ad
jacent states of Minnesota, Nebraska
and Iowa, by which these roads accept
two cents per mile in these adjacent
states, while in South Dakota they
propose to take at the rate of three
Cents per mile from the same mileage
book during the same trip, and charge
three cents per mile for all local
travel within the state. I am opposed
to discrimination by which excessive
charges are collected for hauling coal
from the western parts of the state to
the settlements west of the Missouri
river, and tor hauling emigrant mova
bles from the eastern part of the
state to these same settlements, and
am in favor of legislation in this state
reducing the maximum rate or fate in
each of the cases named so as to abol
ish this unjust discrimination.
"I regard the foregoing as the para
mount issues in the coming campaign
and will dtocuss them bofore utft .jie
I pie as a candidate for the 'United
|States senate.'

PLATFORM OUTLINED.
Deacon Keeves Has It Mixed.
J. D. Reeves of the Groton Inde
pendent prints the following in his
paper, and like many of the younger
editors gets things minedwhen deal
ing with ancient history.
"W. S. Bowen late editor of, the
Sioux Falls Press, is now editing a
paper owned by Ex-Senator Du Boise,
in Idaho. Mr. Bowen had long, been
editor of the Yankton Press and Da
kotan when we came to Dakota Ter
ritory twenty-six years ago—doing
business when Col. Linn of the Can
ton Leader was still a youngster and
and before Charley Hackett of the
Parker New Era, had graduated.
And through all the years Mr. Bowen
was regarded as one of the strong
newspaper men ot the territory ana
state."
Mr. Bowen was a trenchant writer
as some haye reason to know, but
"Col. Linn" the "youngster" had
been editor of the old Dakotan long
before Mr. Bowen came to the terri
tory and Charlie Hackett had gradu
ated before he picked up the edi
torial quill. Deal with .us gently
Bro. Reeves, because w^ love the
glory earned in those days of strife
with grasshoppers and carpet bag
gers.
