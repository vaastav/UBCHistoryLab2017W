I WILSON'S. MESSAGE
President's Address to Both
Houses Is Quite Short.
RAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST
Further Legislation on That Line Is
Strongly Recommended—Bill Giv
ing Foreign Commerce Promo
ters Free Hand Necessary.
i
Washington, Dec. 5.—President Wil
son today delivered his message to
both houses of congress In joint ses
sion. The address was as follows :
Gentlemen of the Congress;
* In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion such legislative measures as may
be Judged necessary and expedient I
shall continue the practice, which I
hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which It seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible ; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which It seems
necessary In the interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, It seems to me im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your last session In view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended;
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate ; in order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon It with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
Its present constitution and means of
action, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged In the work of oper
ating trains in interstate transporta
tion.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults In experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day In railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of an
increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, In case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in the
hands of the executive of the power,
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
Renews His Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress immediate
ly acted on; It established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages in train service and it au
thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe« and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed;
hut it postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem It neces
sary to renew. The power of the in
terstate commerce commission to grant
an Increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to is indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw ln^question the scope of the com
mission's authority or its inclination to
Largest Peanut Fields.
The largest peanut fields in the
world are in Guinea, on the west
coast of Africa, where peanuts are
grown by hundreds of tons. Most of
the African peanuts are shipped to
France.
No Ambulances in London.
London still clings to a very old cus
tom in case of an accident The victim
is carried away to the hospital on a
kind of stretcher on two wheels. No
mnbulances are used.
.
do Justice when there is no reason to
doubt either.
The other suggestions—the increase
In the interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing Its manifold duties, the
provision for full public investigation
and assessment of industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war
or other like public necessity—I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
Intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find it
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find It practi
cally Impossible, with its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
Its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but it is not unlikely that it
may presently be found advisable to
add to Its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative instru
ment
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one
of its Items, the increase in the effi
ciency of the interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted; its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any man In any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue in an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society In do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple into our jurisprudence which I
take it for granted we are not prepared
to introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public
investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at lssub plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to propose
any such principle. It is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint itself with
the merits of the case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I
I can see nothing in that proposition
but the justifiable safeguarding by
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very iffe. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust In it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for the
permanent interests of society Itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives : the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged In pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Rico ;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency lies In the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
Even delay would seriously
so
sary.
jeopard the interests of the country
and of the government.
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money in elec
tions may seem to be less necessary
than the immediate enactment of the
other measures to which I refer; be
cause at least two years will elapse
before another election In which fed
eral offices are to be filled ; but it would
greatly relieve the public mind if this
Important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign 1 funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied In
the light of present experience ; and a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at hand
and some special object connected with
it might be thought to be in the mind
of those who urged il Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand in the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will

has indeed already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented in our experience.
We have not the necessary instrumen
talities for its prosecution ; it is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be created upon an adequate
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedqm without
permitting unregulated license. The
thing must be done now, because the
opportunity is here and may escape us
if we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Rico Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
its people are not Just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do in any essential particular. We
ought to do it at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which it is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion i shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you in
the many measures of constructive pol

only a few minutes to abandon the
vessel, not allowing them even to take
their money and papers.
The submarine towed the lifeboats
in which the crew were placed to with
in five miles ôf the coast, where it
abandoned them.
The Chemung went down with the
Stars and Stripes flying at her mast.
A lively incident preceded the sinking
of the vessel. The German command*

Amos, before Amos drew his gun to
open fire. Two revolvers were found
on Laad after a bullet from Amos'
gun struck Laad In the chest and
killed him. The defense did not place
any witnesses on the stand and used
the state's testimony exclusively to
obtain the discharge of the accused.
Todd Shepard, who, with his wife,
was accompanying Laad and Mrs.

Washington.—Following the receipt
of a communication from the German
government admitting that a German
submarine torpedoed the British horse

icans, Secretary Lansing conferred
with President Wilson, and it was de
cided that no action would be taken by
the American government until it
could be definitely established wheth
er the Marina was a private vessel or
a belligerent transport.
In the note Germany stated that the
commander of the submarine which
sank the Marina had reported that he
took the vessel for a transport and
asked the United States for informa
tion on this point. Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, called
at the state department and also
sought this information. He was told
by Secretary Lansing that the United
States was not yet in a position to an
swer the inquiry, but would do so as
quickly as possible.
Ab a result of the developments of
the day it was indicated by officials
that no action could be expected in the

CONVICTS GOODWIN SLAYER

"Underworld Queen"—Burglary
Alleged Motive.
Memphis, Tenn.—While many good
people were enjoying their Thanksgiv
ing dinner John Rizensky was hearing
the verdict of the jury which would
send him to the state penitentiary for
not less than 10 years for the murder
of Mae Goodwin. The maximum would
be 20 years.
The jury discarded Rlzensky's story
of a lost little sister whom he had
sworn to his mother on her deathbed
he would protect, of her ruin, and of
how he traced the responsibility to
Mae Goodwin, whom he charged with
white slavery.
The jury agreed that Rizensky was
a professional burglar. It agreed that
Rizensky entered Mae Goodwin's home
at about 3:30 o'clock on the morning
of Oct. 9, determined upon robbing her
of her diamonds, but without intent
to take her life. Like all burglars,
the taking of life was the last thing
he wished to do, because it would lead
to detection. Like his kind, he would
not hesitate to shoot to kill If cor
nered.
