irewari and the Newspaper
In the initial number of tbe Sun of
Jacksonville Governor Broward con
tributed an article under the title of
The Pardoning of Criminals in
which after reviewing soma recent
transactions of the state pardoning
board he pays his respects to the
newspapers of Florida as follows
To bft the editor of a news
paper ins to occupy a position
that is supposed or ought to
be a high and lotty one and
the editor ought to give ex
pression to a high public sen
timent upon a higher plane if
the plane is not already high
We are afflicted with a sprink
ling of editors who sell edito
rials for so much an inch sen
timent thrown in Some of
our people are not aware of
this and take for granted that
the writings of such scribblers
are founded on fact that they
are the writings of some wise
manwiser than themselves
Did the people know that
these newspaper writers did
not investigate the matter of
which they write at all they
would not be so credulous
Here is a direct charge made
against the state press by the highest
official of this state the governor of
Florida Governor Broward must be
well informed that the charge is
founded upon fact otherwise it would
be mere childs play to make sucli a
statement
If there are Florida editors who
sell editorial for so much an inch
the governor should for the welfare
of the press and for the best interests
of the state make known their names
and furnish the evidence upon which
to condemn them Titusville Star
The Old Cry of the Defeated
The election contest in New York
has already proceeded far enough to
prove to a moral certainty that in
stead of the wholesale frauds as
charged by W R Hearst and his
hired men by which he was cheated
out of the mayoralty the election
was remarkably honest The investi
gation shows that a few frauds were
committed but amazingly few con
sidering the enormous vote cast and
very evenly divided between all the
parties interested It is now belived
that a recount would not change the
vote more than an average change of
one vote in a thousand That would
be about equivalent to a change of 2
or 3 votes in Escambia county So
it will be seen that Willie screamed
fraud merely because he had lost out
and was madPensacola News
Mr Henry Watterson in the Louis
ville CourierJournal stigmatizes Tom
Lai sOns letter to the governors as
brazenly impudent To say the best
that might be said of him Mr Wat
terson says that he is the George
Francis Train of his timenot the
George Francis Train of Madison
Square as he was known to the chil
dren a gentle harmless old lunatic
but the George Francis Train of
earlier days who had a genius for
selfexploitation and advertising and
did succeed for awhiie in imposing
upon the credulous Uncle Henry
ends his article by saying Let us
have the Vigilance Committee right
away What will Uncle Henry think
when he learns that the governor of
Florida actually invested Tom Law
son with his proxy
The Florida Editors
The Florida editor easily ranks
with the average citizen He gets up
early and works late He lends his
effort to every public enterprise and
ceases his labor only when his pulse
stops beating Few editors ask for
office and none have office thrust
upon them The rich ones are few
indeed yet the following item tells
in what estimatation they are held
by Governor Broward
He says We are afflicted with a
sp nkling of editors who sell edito
rials for so much an inch sentiment
thrown in
After hearing the many things said
to the detriment of Marion county
and in praise of all neighboring coun
ties and right on top of which win
ning the first prize at the state fair
and nearly every other prize in sight
we are reminded of that oftquoted
adage a prophet is not without hon
or save in his own land
General Gilchrist so far has all other
gubernatorial candidates faded Okra
for the farmers and chrysthanthe
mums for the young ladies It seems
that these are vote persuaders

Presidents Message

columns We are enabled to print

passsage of a law regulating rates

pervision of the interstate commerce

kindred subjects
