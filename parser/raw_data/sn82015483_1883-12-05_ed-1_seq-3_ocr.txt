The haokneyed phrases of "selling at ooat,"
"the manufacturer's price for everything,"
and many other obsolete devioes and cheap
clothing tricks are no longer tolerated by
firms who are keen enough to drop them -Several
years ago, when this country was in a
oondition bordering on poverty, so to speak,
the catchy announcements were read and be
lieved by nine-tenths of the people, when in
reality the statements contained about twen
ty per cent, of troth and eighty per cent, of
exaggeration. At the present time we are
glad to say that only one tenth of the people
are led to believe that the so-called great re
dactions of thirty to forty per cent, are gen-
nine. Like charity, we will admit that dealers
who indulge in this style of advertising have
made truthful statements. Their customers
who bought eoods previous to the time of
reduotion mnat have paid thirty to forty per
cent, profit, and perhaps a little more, not
deducted, to help pay a large rent or incident
al expenses. It most be borne in mind that
expenses govern prices, especially in this city,
where competition is quite strong, and the
volnme of trade limited to its own precincts,
including a few ooontry towns. Therefore
we believe that all thinking people will read
ily perceive that Oak Hall is a olothing store
of the happy medium order, and the manage
ment ifl proud in being able to truthfully an
nounce that the business np to the present
time has been exceptionally fine, which is
partially dne to the fact, that expenses gov
era, prices, and both are low in

of the late Governor Morgan of New York.
Mr. Cooke presented a memorial of the
United States attorney of Texas on the sub
ject ef the administration of justice in that
district. He asked that the memorial be
printed in the Record. Mr. Ingalls called
attention to the large amount of matter print
ad in the Record, which was designed to be a
suocinot statement of the debates of Con
gress. He looked upon the introduction of
other matter as a vioious praotice and thought
it was time to call a halt. He therefore ob
jected to the memorial being printed in the
Record. To overcome this objection the
memorial was read.
Mr. Miller, of New - York, presented the
petition of the chamber of commerce and
several maritime, associations of New York
asking for the construction of a marine hos
pital in that city.
The following bills among many others
were introduced: By Mr. Ingalls to amend
the arrears of pensions act by removing the
limitations named in the act. By Mr. Beck to
remove all disabilities imposed by the four
teenth amendment of the constitution; to
authorize the payment of customs duty in le
gal tender. By Mr. Hoar to provide for the
performance of the duties of the executive
in case of the death or disability of the Pres
ident; in relation to tbe eleotoral vote; to
provide a national bankruptcy law. By Mr.
Williams to prevent the spread of infectious
and contagious diseases among oattle. By
Mr. Piatt to establish sohoola ia Alaska. By
Mr. Sherman authorising national banks to
issue bills to 90 per e.nt. of the market val
ue of the bonds deposited to secure circula
tion. Mr. Garland introduced a bill to amend
the section of the revised statutes in refer
ence to the election ot Senators in Congress.
He stated that of the twenty-six Senators
sworn in yesterday there were thirteen who
would not stand the test of the act of July
2S, 186S, if objection had been raised. He
thought it time something should be dons to
remove this difficulty and thought it was as
well to proceed to amend the act while there
was no political excitement in the Senate ;
referred to the Committee on Privileges and
Elections when appointed.
Mr. Edmnnds introduced a bill to amend
sections 1,756 and 1,757 of the revised stat
utes. He said this bill wag covered by one
of the bills introduced by the Senator from
Kentucky (Beck,) but it contained what that
gentleman's bill had not hitherto contained
the security of the United States treasury re
garding the claims which might be msde
against it and the penalties which might be
imposed for false swearing. He was quite
willing to substitute for what is called the
oath provided by seotion 1,757 for those Sen
ators who could not properly take the
ironclad oath. Mr. Edmunds also intro?
duoed bill for the further protection
of oitisens of the United States against the
violation of certain rights secured to them
by the constitution. This bill wishes to pro
tect colored persons against the prejudicial
distinction still made against them in cer
tain States and to protect them consistently
with tbe lata decision of the Supreme court.
He also introduced a bill to protect the con
stitutional right of citizens and to secure
them he said a free ballot and a free count.
Mr. Edmnnds introduced a bill to provide
for the establishment of a postal telegraph
system.
The Senate took a recess until 2:30 o'clock
and at that hoar the recess was extended un
til 8 o'clock. At three o'olock the President's
message was read. The reports of the Sec
retary of the Treasury, Attorney General
and other heads of departments' were laid on
the table.
Mr. Jjogan obtained leave to introduce a
bill to devote $50,000,000 derived from the
internal revenue taxation and the sale of pub
lic lands to the education of children in tbe
Unfted States. V
The Senate adjourned at 4:05.

At the suggestion of Mr. Keifer, of Ohio,
the motion, was amended so as to Include Mr.
Chalmers and adopted without dissent.
The delegates from the territories were
then sworn in.
On motion of Mr. Springer, of Illinois, the
papers in the contested election case of T. N.
Wood vs. S. It. Peters, representative at
large from Kansas, were referred to the Com
mittee on Elections. '
Mr. Hatch, of Missouri, presented the
caucus resolution adopting the roles of the
Forty-seventh Consrssa until two weeks after
the appointment of the Committee ea Rules
and it was adopted.
Mr. Geddes, of Ohio, offend a resolution
declaring the Democratic nominees for offi
cers of the House elected. Mr. Cannon, of
Illinois, offered substitute embracing the
names of the Republican nominees. The
substitute was rejected and those proposed
by Mr. Geddes were elected and sworn in.
Mr. Curtin, of Pennsylvania, offered the
usual resolution for a committee to wait upon
the President and Messrs. Curtin, Blackburn
of Kentucky and Hisoock of New York were
appointed such committee.
Mr. Dunn, of Arkansas, offered a resolu
tion creating a Committee on Rivers and
Harbors; referred to the Committee on
Boies when appointed.
After some preliminary discussion the seats
were vacated and the drawing of seats was
begun. As a favorite on either side drew an
early ticket there was applause from his
friends and much merriment prevailed as the
drawing progressed. At the conclusion of
the drawing, on motion of Mr. Randall, of
Pennsylvania, the House at 2:10 p. m. took a
recess for thirty minutes to await the Presi
dent's, message. At 3 o'clock the
committee to wait on the Presi
dent - reported that duty . performed,
and Mr, Pruden, private secretary to the
President, appeared with the message.
Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, had moved a ref
erence of the papers in the contested election
case from the First Virginia distriot to the
Elections committee for a decision of prima
facie rights to the seat and demanded the
previous question, tie onargea iraua in tne
returning board.
Mr. Calkins, of Indiana, submitted as a
parliamentary point that the prima fade
question had been settled by the swearing in
of the member.
Mr. Keifer, of Ohio, contended that such
action was without precedent and could be
used to unseat a member and debar him from
the right of contest.
Mr. Springer insisted that though circum
stances made it necessary to leave prelimi
nary questions to others, the House when or
ganized had foil power and it became its
duty to inquire into this and all other ques
tions. Mr. J. S. Wise, of Virginia, said the state
ments of Mr. Springer were not borne out
by the record. The only returning board
frauds from Virginia were in the oase of
Goods vs. Piatt. In that oase Piatt was
elected, but a Democratic House gave the
seat to Goods.
Mr. Mayo, the contestant, asserted the va
lidity of his election and asked tbe House not
to pronounce against him without a hearing:
Mr. Tucker, at the request of Mr. Randall,
allowed the subject to go over until to-morrow
in order that the President's message
might be read.
The message having been read Mr. Morri
son, of Illinois, moved the usual resolution
referring the message to the Committee of
the Whole and that it be printed, whioh was
adopted, and the House at 4:50 p. m. ad
journed. TUB OIiD WORLD.

tbe dishonorable discharge of Captain John
R. Farrell, Co. G, Forty-eighth regiment

The Lacoals Murderer A Remarkable
Eacape He Onee Had Crane Death.
Laoonia, Dec. 4. Jobn F. Marsh, a
locomotive engineer, recalls the fast that his
freight train ia May, 1881, at Plymouth acci
dentally ran over Thomas Samoa, the La
oonia mnrderer. Samon heard the warning
whistle, bat mistook the direction of the
train and before it could be stopped the en
gine and three ears went over him as he lay
prone between the rails, but remarkable as it
was he came oat gripsack and all uninjured.
As the train moved on again Samon took off
his hat and bowed to the engineer ia recog
nition of his promptness in stopping the
train.
The murderer Samon was given an inter
view with his wife thia moraine, with whom
he talked freely, stating that he wap ready te
on unngea ana mat ne xeit moon better since
bU confession. If he is hanged lie will be
tbe first murderer who ever met that fats af
ter being convioted ia Belknap county.
There is still talk of his insanity. Since his
oonf ession has been made publio a reaction has
set in ana most people bow pity the murder
er. There is no doubt but that he could
walk Main street without being molested.
But few people believe him insane. ' '

Young Nntt's Trial A Lawyer Who Re
fuses to Assist ia the Prosecution.
Pittbbubq, Deo. 4. The commencement
of the Nutt trial at Uniontown to-morrow has
caused such an influx of strangers that since
early this afternoon the hotels ware filled to
overflowing. Senator Voorhees will reach
there to-morrow morning. There has been
no change in the list of counsel for the prose
cution. Judge Curtis, of New York, had
been engaged by Dukes' stepfather, but this
arose from a misunderstanding. Immediate
ly after the shooting Judge Curtis volunteer
ed his services, but for some reason they
were declined. A week ago the judge was
communicated with, and supposing he was
wanted for the defense telegraphed that he
would come at once without pay. To-day he
learned that he was expected to appear for
tbe prosecution and at once sent a dispatch
in whioh he declines to assist in the prosecu
tion of Nutt and says that in the letter's
place he (Curtis) would have done the same
thing and in concluding expresses the hope
that Nutt will be acquitted. His mother vis
ited her son James Nutt in jail to-day. He
seemed cheerful, but not boastful. It is not
believed they will be able to obtain a jury in
one day. Tbe defense contribution fond
now amounts to $500.
