LIKE A FAIRY TALE.
The Story of Postum Cereal In Words
j and Pictures.
The growth if the Postum Cereal
Co. is like a fairy tale, but It Is true,
every word of it
"The Door Unbolted" is the title of
a charming little booklet Just Issued
by the Company which tells, and il
lustrates, the story of this remark
able growth. It takes the reader from
the little white barn in which the
business was started Jan. 1, 1895,
through the palatial offices and great
factory buildings of the "White City"
that comprise Postumvllle, Battle
Creek, Mich.
The little white barn, so carefully
preserved, is a most interesting build
ing, for it represents the humble be
ginning of one of the country's great
est manufacturing enterprises of to
day, an enterprise that has grown
from this little barn to a whole city
of factory buildings within but little
more than ten years.
No less Interesting is the quaint of
ficial home of the Postum Cereal Co.
The general office building of Mr. Post
and his associates Is a reproduction of
the Shakespeare house at Stratford-on-Avon,
and upon the house and its
furnishings has been expended vast
sums of money, until the rooms are
more like the drawing rooms of the
mansions of our multi-millionaires
than like offices.
That Mr. Post has believed thor
oughly in the idea of giving to his
employes attractive and healthful
work rooms is proven not only by the
general office building of the Company
and its furnishings, but by his fac
tories as well, and of all of 'these
things this beautiful little booklet tells
the interesting story. It will be sent
to anyone on request
Japan's Empress Popular.
It Is doubtful if any royal consort is
more loved by her people than is the
empress of Japan. Educated accord
ing to feudal ideas and skilled in all
the accomplishments befitting one of
her social eminence, her majesty
strongly favors the broadness of the
new education for women and from
her private purse gives large sums
toward the maintenance of women's
schools and universities. During the
war with Russia the empress visited
the hospitals . many times and every
day passed hours making bandages,
The effect of these bandages upon the
wounded soldiers has been of deep in
terest to medical and scientific men,
for the soldiers honored by them
seemed to rally under a peculiar men
tal Influence. All other bandages were
destroyed after their first use; those
made by the empress were sterilized
and used again for the simple reason
of their effect on the recovery of the
BOldlers.
TEN YEARS OF PAIN.
Unable to Do Even Housework Be-
cause of Kidney Troubles.
Mrs. Margaret Emmerich, of Clinton
street' Napoleon, O., says: "For fif
teen years I was a
great sufferer from
kidney troubles. My
back pained me ter
ribly. Every turn
or move caused
sharp shooting
$5I Jalns. My eyesight
' was P0T dark
fore me, and I had dizzy spells. For
ten years I could not do housework,
and for two years did not get out of
the house. The kidney secretions
were Irregular, and doctors Were not
helping me. Doan s Kidney PIUs
brought me quick relief, and finally
cured me. They saved my life."

Uses of Masks.
"Among the North American Indians
the origin of the use of masks lay,"
says a writer, "in the desire to con
ceal the emotions. Thus should two
warriors meet in combat, the mask
conceals any expression, whether" of
sympathy, fear or other emotion. For
instance, the knowledge that fear was
depicted on one's face and that his an
tagonist knew it would very possibly
insure the defeat of the one whose
feelings were betrayed to the other."
Keep In Good Health.
There aro many thousands of peo
ple all over the world who can at
tribute their good health to taking one
of two Brandreth's PIUs every night
These pills cleanse the stomach and
bowels, stimulate the kidneys and
liver and purify the blood. They are
the same fine laxative tonic pills your
grandparents used, and being purely
vegetable they are adapted to children
and old people, as well as those In
the vigor of manhood and womanhood.
Brandreth's PIUs have been in use
for over a century and are for sale

PROPER WAY TO WA8H LACE.
Much Care Needed Lest Delicate Fab-
rlo Be Injured. ' '
It Is advisable, before washing col
ored silk of any description, to soak
it for a time In cold water, with a lit
tle salt in it This will prevent the
color from running.
Wring or, rather, squeeze it out
of this, and wash it exactly the same
way as white silk, using tepid water
and only working it in a lather, not
rubbing ft with the soap.
Do it as quickly as possible, as, it
inclined to run, the colors will be
more likely to do so if in the water for
any length of time. For colored silks
add a little ammonia to the rinsing
water in order to fix the color.
When ironing colored silk, spread
a piece of clean cloth ovier the iron
ing sheet, so that if the, color runs it
will not mark it
When., black lace becomes shabby
and begins to lose its color, becoming
either brown or green-black, it will
be much Improved if washed in the
following manner: First brush it
well. If spotted or stained, wash it
in a little tea, with a slight lather of
soap, and rinse in clear tea.
It may then be washed. If you
only wish to stiffen it, let it soak for
half an hour in the following solution:
To a dessertspoonful of gum arable
and a pint of boiling water. Simmer
slowly over the fire until the gum
Is dissolved and the tea a good black
color. Strain it through muslin and
use. If it is silk lace, add methylated
spirit in the proportions of two tea-
spoonfuls to half a pint of the above
solution. Black lace must never be
touched with the bare iron.
HOUSEHOLD HINT8.
Put a few drops of ammonia on a
rag to rub finger-marks from looking
glasses or windows. .
Ether is excellent for removing
grease, but an easy way Is to soak the
article In cold water, to which has
been added a little borax.
When stewing frui never use a
metal spoon; a wooden spoon is best,
and those with short handles are most
convenient for thick substances.
Patent-leather shoes should be
cleaned with milk, or a little sweet
oil may be rubbed into them. The
soles and heels of such shoes are, of
course, to be cleaned with blacking.
Clothes-pins boiled a few moments
and quickly dried, once or twice a
month, become more flexible and dur
able. Clothes-lines will last longer and
keep in better order if occasionally
treated In the same way.
When loaves are baked in too hot
an oven and the outside crust gets too
brown, do not attempt to cut it off,
but as soon as the bread is cold rub it
over with a coarse tin grater and re
move all the dark-brown crust.
A black leather traveling bag can
always be kept in capital condition by
mixing one tablespoonful of sweet oil
with two tablespdonfuls of milk and
rubbing this well Into the bag. After
it has thoroughly dried it should be
polished with a chamois leather.
In cleaning the brass around the
keyhole it is almost impossible not to
soil the surrounding wood. Get
piece of cardboard about four inches
square, cut a hole in It the shape of
the brass and put it over the keyhole
when cleaning, and the wood will not
be touched.
To Make a Closet '
To Improvise a closet put up a long
board shelf on Iron brackets. Swing
a pole or stick under it, attached by
wire to the board. On the pole put
wire hangers which will slide con
veniently along. Clothing hooks may
be Becured Into the board. As, for cur
tains, do not box-plait them' In, but
put only a box plaited or a plain ruffle
around the top and hang the curtains
by small brass rings upon wires
placed underneath the edge of the
board and kept there by screw eyes
at the corners and where the curtains
part
Muslin-covered dressing tables
made from boxes should have the
draperies similarly hung. For these
the box plaiting should be attached to
the musln cover of the top. Two of
these should be made, since the top
will need laundering far oftener than
the draperies.
For a closet like the one described
two boards may be put up, forming a
shelf, under the curtains for hats and
sewing.
Whistles.
Stir to a cream a half pound of
sugar and a quarter pound butter.
Add six eggs, whites and yolks beaten
separately, with sifted flour to make
a stiff batter. Flavor lightly with rose-
water. Drop the mixture by the large
spoonful on buttered paper on a board
or bottom of an inverted dripping pan.
The mixture should be dropped sev
eral Inches apart so that the cakes
can spread out thin. Bake until a
light brown. It will not take more
than five minutes. Then slip off onto
a molding board that has white sugar
dusted on it. Have ready a round
stick about the dimensions of an old-
fashioned willow whistle, and roll the
cakes about it while warm. When
nearly cold slip off, fill with Jelly that
is thick. , - v -
Macaroni with Tomatoes.
Break the macaroni into pieces an
inch long until you have one pint put
Into boiling salted water, and boll rap
Idly 20 minutes. Drain In a colander,
then put it in cold water for ten min
utes to bleach. Melt one tablespoon
of flour and mix until smooth. Add
one pint of stewed or canned tomatoes
sad stir until It bolls. Drain the mac
aroni and add carefully. Boll one min

Persistent Anaemia Cured byVDr,'
Williams' Pink Pills After Other v .'
Remedies Had Failed. ' ' -
" When I began taking Dr. Williams
Pink Pills." says Mrs. Nathaniel Field
of St Albans, Somerset county, Maine, "
"I was the palest, most bloodless person
yon could imagine. My tongue and
gums were oolorless and my fingers and
ears were like wax. I had two doctors
and they pronounced my trouble aussmia.
I had spells of vomiting, could not eat,
in fact, did not dare to, I had such dis
tress after eating. My stomach was filled,
with gas which caused me awful agony. .
The backache I suffered was at times .
almost unbearable aud the least exertion
made my heart beat so fast that I could
hardly breathe. But the worst of all wa
the splittiug neuralgia headache which,
never left tue for seven weeks. About this
time I hod had several numb spells. My
limbs would be cold aud without any
feeling and the most deathly seusations
wonld come over me.
"Nothing had helped me until I began
taking Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, in fact,'
I had grown worse everyday. -After I
had taken the pills a short time I could
see that they were benefiting me and
one morning I awoke entirely free from,
pain. The distress after eating disap
peared and iu three weeks I could eat
anything I wanted nnd suffer no incon
venience. I also slept soundly. I have
taken several boxes of tho pills and Lave
gained in weight from 120 to 154 pounds
and am perfectly well now."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills cure ansemia,
because they actually make new blood.
For rheumatism, indigestion, nervous
headaches and many forms of weakness
they are recommended even if ordinary
medicines have failed. They are sold by
aU druggists, or will be sent postpaid, ou
receipt of price, 60 cents per box, six
boxes for $3.60, by the Dr. Williams
Medicine Company, Schenectady. N. Y.

Wrong Method of Teaching.
Consul Paul Nash,. of Venice, writes:
"Hundreds of well-educated Americans
annually pass through Venice and, al
though probably nine-tenths of them
have had several years of instruction
In a European language, not one
tenth are capable of speaking a dozen
connected words of anything but Eng
lish. Even college graduates, fresh
from prize-winning in French or Ger
man, are generally unable to speak
either language, although capable of
writing an excellent thesis on their
history, philology, syntax and litera
ture. This Is the result of teaching:
French and German in much the same
way that Latin and Greek are taught
