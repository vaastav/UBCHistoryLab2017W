BYZANTINE RUGS.
The name Byzantine was first applied to a
Byzantine Empire about A. li.- ouv. . , , , ,
Its leading forms are the Eound Arch, the Dome, the Pillar, the Circle and the Cross.
The Mosque of St. Sophia, Constantinople, and the church of St. Marks, Venice,

One of the most progressive American manufacturers of carpet fabrics has happily
combined many of the beautiful forms peculiar to the Byzantine era in the production
of a new kind of Bugs, which are, properly called the "Byzantine."
The purity of the designs, and absence of offensive colorings, will commend them
to all persons of good taste.
Associated with straw mattings in the furnishing of a chamber, library or dining
oom, the effect is charming beyond that of any combination heretofore presented.
We now have in stock a fine variety of styles, in sizes from the small mat up the

Serious Row at Waterford Collision
Between Parnellltea and ldcCar
- thyltes Blaclttuorna Used With
Vicious Celerity.
Dublin, Dec. 13. Michael Davitt, the
famons Irish leader, was seriously wounded
during a riot in Waterford city to-day.
The riot was one ot the most sanguinary
and vicious of any of the rows that have
recently attended the discussions in Irish
towns of tha rival leaders. Ominous ru
mors of an impending row had been ex
citing the populace for some little while,
and six hundred police had been drafted
into the town in the hope that th6ir pres
ence wonld 'secure order. The Parnellite
leaders, Messrs. Redmond, Leamy and Dal
ton had been in Waterford some days.
This afternoon special trains brought hun
dreds of supporters of the rival candidates,
and the various contingents, armed with
blackthorns, marched through the Bireets
to the music of brass bands.
A mob of Farnellites began a fierce con
flict. The opposing crowds fought at very
close quarters and surged to and fro
throughout the streets, seeming utterly re
gardless of the presence of the police.
Volleys of stones were hurled and the
blackthorns moved with a vicious celerity
that sent many of the howling rioters to
the hospital, the police station and their
homes for surgical attendance. In the
midst of the affray Mr. Davitt received a
nasty cut on the forehead, from which the
blood flowed freely. Mr. Tanner and oth
ers were injured by stones. At last the
police formed a cordon and divided the op
posing mobs, and the Davitt crowd reaohed
the clul) rooms.
Mr. O'Brien made the speech of the day.
He bitterly denounced the assault upon
his friends and said the crowds who in
jured Davitt had struck a glorious blow
for the Irish canse.
Davitt's answer to that blow was that
now he was a candidate for Waterford.
O'Brien, in his concluding words.accused
the police of using their batons more in fa
vor of the attacking mob than otherwise.
The police, he a erted, protected the Par
nellites while the force of their blows was
devoted to the McCarthyites.
The main fight occurred for the posses
sion of the bridge leading to the town.
The police were entirely unable to qnell
the contest. The respective bands of mu-t-ic
received mnch ill usage. The brass
horns were dented and twisted and their
drums torn into shreds. Constant skir
mishes continued until the Davitt crowds
reached their rendezvous, the indiscrimi
nate blows of the police ou the heads and
backs of the mob producing Utile effect.
While Mr. u linen was making his
speech Dr. Tanner was dressing the wound
ou Mr JMvitt a head. After be was band
aged Mr. Davitt appeared at a window of
the club house and spoke briefly. Mr.
Redmond, upon hearing of the affair,
drove to Mr. Davitt's hotel and left a note
expressive of his regret of what had oc
curred. There was slight skirmishes as the va
rious deputations were departing to the
railway station. The feeling among the
AdhvreutH of the respective factions seems
to be as bitter and intense as ever.
STORMS AND FLOODS.
IVIucli
Damatre In Knclsnd and
Suspension of Railway Ser-
Walei
vice.
London, Dec. 13. Buildings have been
unroofed at the Welsh seaport of Llanelly
and Pees was fatally injured by the roof
falling while he was in bed. Along the
Yorkshire coast there has been a severe
snow storm. Suspensions of railway ser
vice owing to snow are reported. Floods
are reported in many parts of Derbyshire
and. many streets are under water
in Matlock. In the Todmorden val
ley damage amounting to thousands
of pounds has been done by
high water. Scores of houses are flooded
and a bridge has been partially demolished.
there have been several narrow escapes
from death. At Cambridge two girls
were crushed beneath falling walls, one of
them, named ivate f oster, being killed
outright. The other was seriously injured
ana now lies in a critical condition.
Ship Albion, at Liverpool, from Rio
Grande do sul, dragged her anchor, drifted
across the bows of a steamer and sank
immediately sank. The crew scrambled
aboard the steamer.
LIKE A BOOmsnELl,
Effect of ibe President's Itfeasage I
Chill Regarded as a Rreach of
Diplomatic Usage.
London, Deo. 14. A Santiago dispatch
says: President Harrison's message has
had the effect of a boomshell here. It is
regarded in official circles as a breach of
diplomatic usage. The Official Gazette
published notes exchanged between the
Chilian government and Mr. E(?an,
United States minister. These corroborate
the declarations in the circular, reflecting
Chilian qnestion, sent by the foreign office
to all Chilian legations. The foreign office
asked Mr. Ean in a courteous note on
November 9 to supply the proffered tes
timony to substantiate his charges against
Chilian officials, A month's delay in com
plying with this request prevented Presi
dent Harrison from knowing the reBult of
the inquiry into the Baltimore affair, a
knowledge of which, it is believed, would
have altered his message entirely.
COMISO WEEK IN CONGRESS.
Plans of Senators and Consreasmoiii
Preparlne for t&e Holiday Recess
Kills and Resolutions.
Washington, Deo. 13. So far as actual
legislative business is concerned it is
probable that the present week in congress
will be devoid of feature or interest. Many
senators and representatives, assuming
that the holiday recess will begin before
the end of the present week, have made
arrangements to leave Washington for

FIVB STRIKERS KILLED.
A Colorado Town Terrorized by Aus
trian and Italia Rioters Troop
Ready for an Emergency.
Disvkr, Deo. 13. A Strike at the mines
of the Colorado Coal and Iron company
at Crested Butte has resulted much more
seriously than was at first anticipated and
there are yet indications of further blood
shed before the matter is settled. About
two weeks ago 600 Austrian and Italian
miners employed at these works went ont
on a strike because of a proposed reduc
tion of wages by the company.
Since the men went out they have re
fused to allow the company to bring in
new men, have stopped the pumps and
fans at the works, allowing them to fill
with gas until there is danger of the mines
blowing up, and have paraded the streets
heavily armed, threatening death to any
one who should attempt to assist the com
pany in any manner.
Sheriff Shares of Gunnison arrived there
yesterday with a posse of twenty-five men
for the purpose of taking possession of and
guarding the mines. No sooner had they
alighted from the train than they were at
tacked by about two hundred armed Sici
lians and Austrians, who began firing with
their rifles. The sheriff held his men for
a moment and then ordered them to return
the fire, which they did with deadly effect,
killing Mike Copuicine, Mike Minnelon,
Mike Ouercio, Mike Warn and John
Poche. They are all Italians. George
Simonici and Matt Grahak, Austrians, were
fatally wounded.
After the firing the miners retreated and
the sheriff's posse marched up the hill and
took possession of the mines and threw up
redoubts. -
The miners are swearing revenge upon
every friend of the coal company.
The governor has called oat the state
militia and the troops are now at the arm
ory ready to start for the scene by special
train.
Everything has been quiet so far at
Crested Butte to-day. Sheriff Sharp and
bis posse still have possession of the mine.
They have fixed a dead line 100 yards
from the month of the mine and no one is
allowed to pass withont giving the coun
tersign. The mines have been rnnning
since Friday and are now nearly free from
gas. Four of the wounded Italians are
expected to die to-night. The other three
may recover.
The state labor commissioner had a con
ference with leaders of the strikers to-day.
A committee from the strikers will meet a
committee from the owners to-morrow
with a view of settling the differences by
arbitration.
SWEPT A WAT A TOWN.
Great Damage Caused by Floods In
Costa Rica Land Slide on a Rall
Road farrow Escape of Work
men. Panama, Deo. 4. Advices from Costa
Rica, dated November 20, say that heavy
rains in the neighborhood of Cartago
caused the Moline river to again overflow
its banks and created great alarm in the
regions inundated only a short time before.
The force employed in clearing away the
wreckage and constructing levees was there
upon increased by 200. 'Whether any
further damage was wrought will not be
known until the arrival of the next mail.
The first train that could be got on the
lines since the flood, ran as far as Jnan
Viuaa eighteen miles of Cartairo on
whence the mails were carried on by horses
and hand cart. This will go on until the
bridges can be repaired or reconstructed.
In addition to the damuge done by the
flood a considerable landslide occurred on
the railway between Cartago and Jnan
Vinas. Over three hundred men were at
work on the line there, and it is no little
wonder that three of them were crushed by
the falling mass of earth and rocks.
The town of Carillo was totally de
stroyed, the flood making a clean sweep of
everything except the old custom house
and a portion of the Hotel Ferrocarril.
The river Suelo now flows over the site of
the town. The river Toro Amarillo also,
that ran below the town, has formed for
itself an entirely new channel, but de
molished the railway bridge over the old
bed before abandoning it.

I'KOsPEItirV A UlTV.
Avoid Evil and tee Prosperous.
Rev. J. Lee Mitchell preached yesterday
morning at the First Congregational
church, Fair Haven, one of his character
istic sermons full of sound sense aud
qnaiut expressions. The text was from
I. 1-3. How does a man know that he be
lieves in the Bible? He believes in the
Bible when he obeys it. Failing to see
that the godly man prospers, he can at
least fulfil part of the text and keep out of
the counsels of ungodly men and women.
The noticeale thing in modern unbelief is
that it is not unbelief in Ood and
tho Bible but indifference to
them. The man who has seen others prosper
ing by a wicked triumph, while he and his
family suffered for it, does not believe that
Uou prospers the righteous, and it
is no i
tajueuukbiuu iui mm ui tw wiu iubv uw
moves in a mysterious way." The world
is so niiea wttu its own pains that, neii
has no terrors for some men, and love of
(iod is to them nothing but a fairy tale.
It is as much a duty for a Christian man
to be prosperous as to be moral. If a man
is continually unfortunate he has a right
to question the reality of bis religion.
The first duty of a man after he has be
come a believer is to become prosperous
and then to let that prosperity spread ont
and around him. The age in which we live
is characterized by prosperity and, as in
variably happens, side by side with it is
the deepest want, the lowest depredation.
To alleviate the lot of these is the duty of
the fortunate man. This is the modern
reformation; this is the modern crusade.
It is the intention of God that every eodly
man shall prosper, and by the free use of
this prosperity can tne prevalent maitter-
enoe, which amounts to unbelief, be up
rooted.
AN OPEN SWITCH.
One Man Killed and Others Injured
Serious Accident at Wheaton's Sta

of tne canton, who were numerous in the
throngs gazing at the window Saturday

display, the canton model having looked
lonely, resembles some fair damsel in
town of their acquintance.
