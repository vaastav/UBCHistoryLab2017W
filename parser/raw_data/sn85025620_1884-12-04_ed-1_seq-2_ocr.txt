American journalism is having great

British journalism, comas to the
!ront with a Sunday edition. A very
few years ago. the man who hinted at
the publication of anew spaper in Eng­
land on Sunday was regarded as a rank
heretic, and in fact treated- with a cold­
ness which rarely made him broach the
•ubject more than once.
If one were to read eaoh day the rec*
ord of fires throughout the country he
would imagine that the "fire fiend" had
full power in the land and the iast con
conflagration was well under way
And so of the reports of business fail­
ures and wage-troubles which are now
so often to be met with in the new-spa
pers. If these items are noted and col­
lected they make a dismal record, but
we must remember that for every busi­
ness house or manufactory which col­
lapses there are hundreds if not thous­
ands wliich are going quietly and pros­
perously on as usual.
The dairying business has greatly in­
creased in the Northwest, especially in
Iowa and Minnesota, owing in a great
measure to the establishment of cream­
eries and the zeal of those who have
profited thereby. But the most sa­
gacious farmers do not advocate dairy
farms exclusively. They realize that
the evils attending exclusive wheat
raising, may follow exclusive dairying,
and that diversified farming is what pays
best in the long run. Cattle, hogs,
sheep, poultry, bees, corn, wheat and
other creals, and dairying with the rest,
tfiord surer prospects of independence
than any one by itself.
The recent elections in Germany for
the Reichstag go to show that Socialism
is on the increase. The general suppo­
sition was that only a few malcontents
in the towns were committed to Social­
ism, but 650,000 votes were cast for the
socialistic candidates has set the gov­
ernment to thinking. An analysis of
the vote ordered by the Imperial Chan
celor shows that the bulk of the new re­
cruits to Socialism are moderate men
who desire redress for the more cry­
ing evils resulting from an over-zealour
enforcement of repressive laws. Prince
Bismarck has taken the matter in hand
and promises to make certain moderate
concessions. In this manner he lias di­
vided the deputies elected by the Social­
ists, and will defeat the objects of the
more unrelentiug of the malcontents.
A Boston lawyer, Miss Lelia J. Rob­
inson, lias lately removed to Washing­
ton territory which is an excellent field
for a lawyer of her sex. Miss Robinson
is not one of the Belva Lockwood varie­
ty of woman lawyers, who make notorie­
ty a substitute for legal knowledge, but
she has had a careful and thorough
professional education, which, with a
mind naturally acuta and forcible, and
a valuable experience in some brandies
of practice before leaving Boston,
makes a solid basis for genuine and
legitimate success in her profession.
The bar of the territory, which includes
some lawyers of more than ordinary
talent and learning, has formed a
favorable opinion of her abilities, and
it is said that she is likely to be elected
judge when the people having ad­
vanced beyond the territorial stage,
can elect their own judges.
Many people are under the impres­
sion that social life in cities is more
agreeable than elsewhere. This is
mistake, as country people al
wavs find, when transplanted to a city.
There is less real friendship, less con­
fidence, less sincerity, less intimacy be­
tween people in the city than in the
country. Perhaps it is because there
are more rascality, more vice, more
deviltry going on in the city, wnieli
make men and women mare suspicious
5f each other, and lead them to place a
lower estimate on human nature. Peo­
ple do not know each other as thorough­
ly in the city as in the country, and con­
fidence is a plant of small growth. Ev­
erything is more artificial, more con­
ventional in the city it destroys in a
great measure, that feeling of home lift
which every one feels who is born and
reared in the country and which ought
bo cultivated.
Woman suffrage in Washington Ter­
ritory has not yet borne unwelcome
fruits, if the officials tell the truth.
The governor, in his annual report to
the federal anthorities in Washington,
says Although many of our citizen?
are disposed to question the wisdom oi
this law, especially when attended with
the requirements that women should
serve as jurors, it meets with the ap­
proval of a large majority of the peo­
ple. and the women of the territory are
for the moat part strongly desirous
,£hat
enactment be retained upon oui
statute books. Thus far it seems at­
tended with no important results un­
favorable to the welfare of the people
of the territory. Chief Justice Greene,
of Washington Territory, in his last
charge to the Grand Jury, tears
the following testimony to the
good effect of women serving on juries:
"Twelve terms of court, ladies and gen­
tlemen, I have now held, in which
women have served as grand and petty
jurors, and it is certainly a fact beyond
dispute thai no other twelve terms sc
salutary for restraint of crime have ev
*r been held in this territory." Thif
'.ustimony ot the Governor and Chiel
Josttce, is by no means conclusive as to
the probable results elsewhere. Should
the experiment be tried in tbiwfcly set­
tledportions of the country, the result
might not be so favorable. But every­
body will watch with increasing inter­
est, the final outoome of the radical in­
novation upoQ iiPTPWacrfcl cuoiqnft.

Ex-Congressman Calkins has returned to the
city. He is the most disgusted individual left
over from tho election. He was so confident
of election to the governorship of Indiana that
ho resigned his seat in the house. He was
elooted to the Forty-eighth cougress by but
410 majority, and his district fell an easy prey
to the Democrats. B. F. Shively, Deinoorat
Greeubacker, will succeed him in this house,
and George Ford in the Forty-ninth congress.
Delegate Maginnis of Montana is vigorously
opposing the proposed lease of the Crow reser­
vation to a syndicate of Colorado cattle men,
and in so doing undoubtedly voices the pre­
vailing sentiment in his territory. Should such
a lease bo consummated, he asserts that not
ouly would the Indians derive no real benefit,
but the locking up of so great a track of coun­
try—3,500,000 acres—would lead to an out­
break on the part of tho natives. As Secretary
Toller has already declared in positive terms
against suieh leases, it is doubtful if anything
comcs of tho proposal, though Mr. Maginnis is
inclined to think that sufficient political pres­
sure may be brought to boar to cause him to
yield.

The crew of the vessel will consist oi
about fifteen men: Captain Bray, first
and second officers, chief engineer, as­
sistant engineer, two firemen, steward,
cook and eight seamen. George F.
Garland, who was in command of the
Morning Star, wrecked last February,
will go as first officer, and Frederick
Snow, of Jamaica Plains, son of one ol
the old Micronesian missionaries, as
chief enginesr. Arthur Logan, son oi
Kev. R. W. Logan, of Ohio, will sail in

A very interesting ceremony to Catho­

ter Seraphine will be 80 years of age
December 1. She was eleven years
with the Sisters of Charity, then joined
the Visitation Order, and after a year's
postulantship made her vows, just fifty
years ago. The ceremonies were com­
memorative of this fact. She renewed
her vows and was presented with the
crucifix, alighted candle and a golden
crown, with appropriote prayers and

The Milling World says that George
Westinghouse, before he invented and
perfected his well-known air brake,
was regarded by a number of his then
acquaintances with something approach­
ing pity because of his alleged lack of
"gumption.^ His air brake was a suo
cess, and his friends began to think
there was something in him after all.
His automatic engine added to his fame
and bank balance, and he mounted
higher in the esteem of his former
friends. A few weeks ago a well of
natural gas was struck on his premises
at Homewood, near Pittsburg. The
well js 1,580 feet deep, and the flow of
gas is tremendous, the roar being al­
most deafening and scarcely endurable
to the citizens of the neighborhood.
Two other wells are being put down by
Mr. Westinghouse, and he estimates
that his paofit therefrom will soon
amount to one thousand dollars a day.

Dairyman's Association at Austin.
Tho fourth annual meeting of the Minnesota
Butter, Cheese and Dairy Stock association was
held at Austin, Mower county, last week. The
attendance was not very large, but the pro­
ceedings were of interest to farmers
generally. Mr. A. Pierce gave the
iKldresB of weloome. Vice President O. C.
Gregg of Marshall, who presided responded
and proceeded to make the opening address of
tho association on "The Advantages of
Minnesota a Dairy State," He especially
favored winter dairying. Wo must cease to
raise gram exclusively for sale in the markets,
and turn it into dairy products. We are yet to
produce the bulk of dairy products in this
country. We have only begun to push our
products into sight Let us keep up with the
ever increasing demand for better dairy pro­
ducts, and arrange our darying so as to take
the boat advantage of the great markets. I
believe winter dairying to be one of the great
opportunities of prosperity to the Minnesota
farmer.
"Our Dairy Markets," was the subject of dis­
cussion. Mr. A. P. McKiustry, he said: Last
epjnng we organized the Mankato exchange,
and it has been a great success. We have sold
over flOO,000 worth of butter over the board,
and we have done better in that market than
we could do in New York. We have good buy­
ers there near home, getting quick remittances
and avoiding commissions and freights.
Our creamery products rate in New York, as
a rule, as "Western extra." As soon as Min­
nesota can demonstrate to other markets the
quality and quantity of our goods, buyers will
freely come in here and take all our products.
To consign to distant commission men is, to a
certain extent, to place ourselves at their mer­
cy.
Mr. T. Mower of Cedar Rapids believed the
nearest home market was the best market
It is better to have butter merchants than
the present commisssion men.J|Mon who own
tho butter will work hard to get a good price
for it Agents will never take the same trou­
ble to got the best prices If men are butter
merchants the market will never get over­
stocked. The best plan for a creamery is on
tho co-operative principle. Most of ihe Elgin
creameries ran on this plan. Itinterestaevery
patron. Every patron is a detective on his
noighbors to see that they sell good milk. We
are agoing to have butter tests as to the purity
and value of milk, to tell how much fat and
how much water there is in milk.
Mr. O. C. Greffg, vice President, said: My
experience has been that home markets are
best I say, don't consign to any city agent or
grocer, and leave it for hiin to sell at his dis­
cretion. Have eome distinct understanding as
to limits of price before you ship. If you con­
sign at all, cousign to a commission man. I
can do better making my own sales in the great
markets than to have much to do with com­
mission men.
Secretary Rice said: It is only a question
of time when the daily markets
will be overstocked, unless we widen
in some way the consumption. In 1880 au av­
erage of an ounce of buttor a day was oaten in
tlus country. In Southern countries less but­
ter is used than in the North. I think we can
make a market the South. Mr. Marvin a
few days ago sold 24,000 pounds of butter in
the New Orleans market We ought also to
pay more attention to the Western market
Illinois is nearer to New York than Minnesota,
but there is a great field to the west of us.
On tho topic, "the Dairy in Diver­
sified farming," Secretary Rice, said:
I Exclusive dairying is not a good rule
for the average fanner. Dairying should
be prominent and lead with it every line
of profitable farming. Diversilied farming is
tho true rule. On tho oldest farm in Olmsted
county, where dairy lia.i baen introduced, more
wheat is raised per acre than ever. For suc­
cessful diarying pastures should bo perma­
nent you must build up a permanent sod
this takes several years. Changing pastures
every year is a grave mistake. The SDeaker
then explained fully the method of making
permanent pastures. C. E. Marvin followed
on the "Minnesota dairy and New Or­
leans Exposition." Our dairy products
stand to-day with a superior reputa­
tion. An important question is how
shall we show to the world what wonderfully
fine dairy goods Minnesota can produce? Five
years ago Minnesota was a "wheat state and
everybody said dairying would not pay here.
But within four years our dairv interests have
grown over 300 per cent Tliiity-six to forty
million pounds of dairy produce is Minnesota's
record this year with a value of $10,000,000.
Every creamery and dairyman in the state has
a personal responsibility to advertise our im­
mense dairy products. This is one of our
great resources.
Mr. A. P. McKiustry read a paper on "The
Progress of the Dairy Interest in Minnesota,
giving statistics which are familar. If the re­
turns of butter made are approximately correct
the product in four years lias increas'ed four­
fold, and the increase in the value of the
amount sold has at loaot doubled in price. The
increase in the number of cows used for diary
purposes has doubled in the same time, and
this has been done in the face of a heavy de­
mand from the Montana rachmen for
heifers. He advocated winter dairy­
ing, and said* I believe it is possible to
make our stables so warm and yet well ventil­
ated that they will not freeze, and so comfort­
able and convenient that the cows could stay in
them for days without privation. I know by
experiment that there is a difference of 20 per
cent, between a dairv so handled and one thai
has to go outside tha barn for water during
c»ld weather. I have found that a cow will
drink forty pounds more water in a day than a
steer of the s.imo weight, and on nearly the
Bamo feed, and that she will drink very much
more water if it bo given to her two or three
times during tho day in tho barn than if turned
loose in the yard to drink, and among
cows the heaviest milkers are the
heaviest drinkers. He said he had fonnd
it is hard to ascertain Just tho amount and
the kind of food necessary and profitable as a
ratiou for a dairy cow. Prices of different
kinds of grain will govern and require changes,
but this year I have adopted the following for­
mula for a dairy of twenty-five in milk: 150
lbs bran, 100 lbs ground oats, 100 lbs corn
meal, 50 lbs oil meal. This, mixed together,
will give about thirteen quarts to each cow per
day, and with oats at 10 cehts, corn 25 cents,
bran $'.), and oil meal $23, will cost not far
from ten cents per day for each cow, and a cow
reasonably fresh in milk that will not makoa
pound of outter per day, will not pay for her
koei)inf
Secretary Kltfe said cream at ~'l cents to-aay
is a good deal better than wheat at 45 cents. I
havo a farm of 3:20 acres in Olmstead county,
100 of which is properly my stock farm. Dur­
ing tho past twelve mouths I have milked 17
cows, 8 of tliom heifers, 11 half-grado Jerseys
and sold tho cream at the Rochester creamery.
The crcam alone has paid all the expenses of
running the whole o20 acres and something
These expenses include the harvesting,
and binding of 140 acres of wheat
threshing
which is left as clear profit
Vice President O. C. Grej/g of Marshall runs
a wintar dairy. He will milk thirty cows this
winter cows are fresh in the fall. The grain
raised in summer on the farm is ground and
fed to these cows during the winter months,
and thus converted into fresh butter for win­
ter use. The calves are raised in the winter
most successful!
iiy.
The peculiar benefits of this method are
summed up as follows:
First—Cutter made when butter brings good
price.
Second—Winter weather is favorable to cows
in milk, and to the keeping and making of
dairy products.
Third—Calves are raised when time can be
giveu to them, and are at an age to be turned
out to grass when spring comes.
Fourth—The laborers of the farmers are
given continuous work, and the farmer by the
increased returns is able to pay an iniR'oase of
wages over the usual yearly amount.
Fifth—By this continual labor employed the
manure of "the farm can be certainly spread
upon tho fields and the general farm work be
better done.
Sixth—Feeding the grain or grass products
the cows after this manner and making sale of
tho buttor as a grain product greatly increases
tho fertility of tho farm.
Seventh—The making of winter butter will
equalise the price of daily products, obviating
the low prices of summer, and giving good
priccs during the winter scarcity. To-day only
ten cows out of 100 are fresh in winter.
E G. Potter spoke on "Our Daily Makers" and
spoke of the reign of prosperity among far­
mers, beginning with darying. The home mar­
kets are the best markets.
The chief discussions on the next day was
upon the subject of the extensive adulteration
of diary poducts and the best means of pre­
venting it The following resolutions, which
were finally adopted, embody the substance of
the discussion.
Whereas, Our interest as diarymen and agri­
culturists are seriously injured by the manu­
facture and sale of adulterated products.
Kosolved, That this association, organized
for the development of the dairy products and

York for the suppression of fraud in dairy pro­
ducts. (A copy of tho New York law was an­
nexed to this resolution.)
Kosolved, That the officers of the associa­
tion, together with S. N. Frisbee, E. G. Potter
and F. D. Holmes, be a committee to press
this matter upon the attention of our legisla­
tors and also to prepare a memorial which
shall embody these
sentiments, which memorial
shall be circulated for signatures among tho
creamery men, dairy men, stock mon and
dealers in diary products throughout the
state, and be presented to the legislature.

Hints to Young Mothers.
One reason why so many young
motherx do not look so tidy and attract­
ive as it is the bounden duty of all
women to look, is that they do not ac­
cept tne inevitable with the proper
spirit, and then adapt themselves to
it For instance, it is impossible to care
for a baby as it should be cared for, and
yet to wear as good adress asyeu would
if yon were simply sitting down to do
fancy work. The usual dress when en­
gaged in this occupation should be of
some material that will bear sponging
then, a sponge and a bottle of diluted
ammonia should be kept near at hand.
Of aprons there should be an unfailing
aripply, of different sizes and degrees.
Do not fail to have at least two of the
same length of your dress, and of two
full breadths. A white one of this
style, trimmed all around with scarlet
machine embroidery, is actually becom­
ing to most women, and will save its
cost many times over by preserving the
dress beneath. Clothe yourself suit­
ably, and then enjoy rocking your baby!
All other pleasures you may hope to
have repeated, but the joy of being the
mother of a baby is one which may be
yours but once, and that for so short a
time that it will seem almost dreamlike
in a very few years.—N. Y. Post.
Abominations of ths BackY ard.
Eben E. Rexford in American Agriculturist
Many back-yards are abominations to
the eye and nose. One finds in them
all sorts of litter and refuse from oys­
ter cans to old boots. Here the slops
of the kitchen are poured to increase the
odors which ought to warn every
thoughtful person of the malarial in­
fluence breeding there, to break out
eventually in fevers or diphtheria. If
any member of the family dies from one
of these diseases, his death is probably
lamented as a "mysterious dispensation
of Providence," but the minister would
Ray
if he were to visit the back-yard,
that death was caused solely by vio­
lation of hygienic laws. A very strong
argument against a dirty back-yard, is
the spirit of deception which it is apt to
foster in the young members of the fam­
ily, for it is a constant deceit to present
a clean and attractive front-ya?d to the
gaze of the passers, while the back-yard
is not fit te be seen. Children should
be taught to be clean for the sake of
cleanliness, and not because outsiders
are likely to criticise them. The best
plan is to have a hogshead or large box
fitted up in one corner of the yard, and
make it a rule to throw into this old cans,
boots, broken dishes, and all such rub­
bish, and when there«is a great accu­
mulation, to bury or burn it. Do not al­
low anything to be thrown about. Have
drains made to convey all slops entirely
from the house. Make good walks,
and lot the ground have a fine covering
of grass, not weeds. Put up strong
supports for the clothes line. Keep
the fence in repair and plant currant
bushes near it. Set vines about the re­
fuse barrel and train them over it until
it is hidden. If \ou have a receptacle
for ashes, let it be something that can
be shut up, not a row of old barrels to

Baosptaolss for Clothes.
Are neccessary among tbe most prom­
inent pieces in bed-room furnishings,
and happily some of these may be
home-made. One capital institution is
the box ottoman, which, according to
size, will hold dresses at full length or
serve for hats or bonnets. This is a
particularly easily manufactured com­
fort, and almost any box will do for a
foundation. A packing case is very
suitable. First purchase a pair of
hinges for the lid, and four castors.
When these are screwed on line the box
neatly with pink or gray glazed lining,
fastening it securely by tacks or glue to
the bottom of the outside of the box.
Next make a cushion to fit the box, and
lastcn this also securly at the four cor­
ners. This cushion may be made like
a pillow or mattress. Cut a strip of
cretonne, raw silk or whatever is in­
tended for covering the depth of the
box, long enough to go round it, allow­
ing for fullness. Hem the lower edge
neatly and gather the top into a band
the exact size of the lxx. This band
is then nailed on or tied or buttoned.
Cut apiece sufficiently large to cover
the cushion and lid, and to this stitch
a frill, either kilted, gathered or box
plaited, and fasten the whole with
fancy ©ails to the lid in such away that
the kilting falls over and hides tbe
band of the box-valance. Add a cord
or ribbon loop to the middle of the loop
to lift it by, and the ottomans, one long
enough for dress skirts and a smaller
one which will slip under the dressing
table and hold hats, etc., serving when
needed as a seat for the dressing table.

This is about the time when farmers
who hire by the season are called on to
settle up and it makes a large hole in
the income of the farm, and too many
farmers, are inclined to 4rive a closer
bargain with the workman who* par
haps, is not very well qualified to look
out for himself, than he would with the
village trader who understands tha bus­
iness. Every half day lost and every ex­
tra favor granted is rakedup
and counted,
as if tbe laborer was not entitled
to the respect and oourtesy common
between man and man. But just "put
yourself in his ph ce." Think of tha
confined treadmill life of working month
after mouth where you have no interest.
Think of the home comforts and liber­
ties which he loses for the simple wages.
Do yon want to take that chance and do
tha work, while the owner gives orders,
and do the chores while he goes to tha*
store in the evening, for any less than
he asks? Pay him ttp promptly and
make him a present and do not be too
small in TOUT figuring. If von arc
prompt ana liberal in your dealings
with hired men, it will be remembered
and told of, and will aidyouin securing
the beat help in the future but, more
than that, you will thimk more of your­
self and not feel when you pass a man
whom you have employed that he ia
telling his neighbors of your mean
tricks.—New Hampshire Fanner.

There is no excuse for many disgust­
ing and health-pollnting privies of farm
and village homes. To those accustomed
to good earth or water-closets, the
idea of the common privy witn its
vault, holding the reeking accumula­
tions of years, to poison the air and
shock the senses is intolerable. Many
are deterred from making changes for
the better for the fear of the expense,
but it is far better to pay out money
here than to pay the doctor. Still a
perfect earth-closet may be es­
tablished and kept up without any cost*
ly investment, as the writer knows by
experience. At his home, away
from water conveniences, he adopted
the following plan, and has kept it np foi
many years: The privy building was
raised about two feet higher than it
used to stand, and the door approached
by steps. By cutting an opening at
the back of the house, below the seat,
this new level easily allowed of running
a wheelbarrow, the carrying part oi
which was a box, nnderneath. A move­
able cover was made to the opening, to
slant outwards and cover the handles
of the barrow. Then, inside of ths
structure, a bushel-box of dry earth or
coal ashesconstantly kept, and in
it an as.i-thovel. Those ordinarily
using the closet were instructed to ap­
ply a shovelful of earth oil the contents
each time. No smell ever arose from
the place, and once a month the bar­
row was easily trundled away relieved
of its load and returned.
Things in General.
The manufacture and sale of men's
clothing is one of the most important
industries of New York city. It em­
ploys twice as many persons as any oth­
er occupation, and tne 800 establish­
ments in the city have a capital cf $25,
000,000, employ 50,000 operatives an)
pay out wages amounting to $15,000,
000 every year. Clothing made in New
York is worn by workingmen in every
State and Territory in the United
States, and much of it is exported tc
foreign countries.
English landowners are menaced with
the same impecuniosity as French lit­
terateurs. No less than 30,000 acres
vainly demand tenants in ESSPX. With­
in 30 miles of London 170 aeres were
lately sold for £2,400, for which £5,
000 was refused 10 years ago. Lady
Catherine Cask ell, a great aristocrat,
proposes in an English magazine arti­
cle, as a remedy for all this, that farm­
ers and their wives and daughter*
should cease to be educated, should
avoid pianos and decent clothing, rise
at 3 o'clock in the morning, and spend
all day among the beasts in the field.
She points the moral by bringing for­
ward a model farming family, whose
clrief peculiarity is that they speak
atrociously bad English, and eat meat
once a week.
The arrangements for the establish­
ment of an Irish colony in Utah' are
about completed. Mr. John Dillon and
Mr. Parnell have entered into the
scheme with vigor, and a tract of 100,
000 acres of land has l»een secured. It
was the original intention to devote tho
settlement exclusive lo Irish immi­
grants, but that scheme has been aban­
doned, and poor people of all national­
ities will lie welcomed and assisted to
obtain a foothold, and then allowed to
pay for the land tliey occupy as soon as
they can.
The late tremendous drop in the price
of wheat has produced something like a
panic among the wheat growers of Eng­
land. At present prices the retnrns on
most farms will not cover txpenditure.
The total immigration for the vear
ending with the oOth of June last foots
up 518,592, as against 003,322 for the
previous year—a falling off of nearly
one-seventh. Despite all Bismarck's
efforts to arrest the living tide which
sets so strongly away from Germany,
the number of new comers from that
empire fell off only 15,000, the 179,676
from that nation being more than tlires
times as numerous as the Irish con­
tingent of 55,918. The decrease of
Italian immigration nearly one-half,
from 31,792 to 16,510, is cause for con­
gratulation, because Italians do not
come to stay. In some respects they
are like the Chinese who, come to make
a little money and go home to enjoy it.
Smoking as a Gentleman.
From "Tbe Mentor," by Alfred Ayres.
There is no one thing perhaps, in which
the difference between the well-bret)
man and the ill-bred man more appears
than in the manner in which, the place
where, and the time when they smoke.
The well-bred man does not smoke,
nor does he seem to smoke, to show off,
whereas the ill-bred man very often
smokes in a self-conscious manner
seems to say: "Look at me! see how
skillfully my lips hold this cigar how
1 can shift it from one side of my mouth
to the other without touching it with my
fingers, and hew well I can articulate
with it in my mouth in short, look you
what perfect control I have over my la­
bial mii3cles, and, having seen, admire!"
In short, there are many low-bred
young men—very many—that appear
to smoke only to display their—imag­
ined— grace and skill, when in fact in
sinok ing as they do, wliera they do,
and when they do, they but publish
their vulgarity. Such men are certain­
ly not of the sort that Shakespeare ao
cuses of having a "vaulting ambition."
As they smoke chiefly for show, a poor
cigar answers their purpose as well as
a good one consequently, they usually
buy of the kind that are at the rate of
two for a cent.
The weil-bred man, on the contrarr
the gentleman, the man that smokes on­
ly for the love of it, puts but as much
of his cigar in his mouth as is necessary
in order to draw it, keeps it in his mouth
no longer than is necessary, snd nevet
fails to remove it when he talks, or pass­
es any one toward whom he would berL
spectfulI, especially a lady. Furthur
our best bred men never smoke in anw
street at any hour when it is much fti
quented, nor in any public place when
smoking is likelv tp be offensive tooth
