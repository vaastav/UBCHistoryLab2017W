home surpris? w*s occasioned by the
emphssis laid by th? President en the

the advocates of revolution and their
followers, h? ?aid: "Thirr is tl

nation, Hi? and soul, t? the World

a call to hav? th? aliens respect Amer?
ican Institutions and to hav? the
American viewpoint magnified to the
alien seeking citizenship.
The President then passed on dis?
cussion of th? prohibition question,
which has.been perturbing hlra for
some weeks.
"Let m?n who ?ra rending the moral

Conditions relating to the ?1
ment of the Eighteenth Amendment,
the President ssld, "savor of nation?
wide scandal. It i? th? roost demora?
lising- faetor In our public life."
In a regretful ton? th?
pointed rut that instead of alia
ing prohibition from politics, as most
people had assumed In sdvance would
be the cas?, the Eighteenth Amend?
ment ha? irtensified prohibition to
sueh an ?xtent as a political issue that
many voters were moved by no other
consideration.
"It Is distracting the public mind
and prejudicing the judgment ef the
electora," he ?aid Stating that he did
not believe the Eighteenth amendment
would ever be repealed, and that ?.
lieved the enforcement law is in
patty with "delib?rate public opinion."
the President pointed out, however,
that "rigorous and liberal enforcement
will concentrate public attention on
any requisite modification."
It was st this point that the Presi?
dent ?nnounc?d hi? intention to in?
