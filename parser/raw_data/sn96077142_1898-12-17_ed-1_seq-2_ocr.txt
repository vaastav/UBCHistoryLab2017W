ATTORNEY GENERAL GRIGGS.
Tell of the Work of Department of
Justice la Ills Aaaoal
Report.
Washington, Dec. 8. Attorney-General
Griggs Wednesday submitted to
congress his annual report of the oper
ations of bis department
The war revenue act." he says, "has
been especially productive of doubtful
questions, and many Instances cf advice
and direction to the commissioner of In
ternal revenue relative to different features
of that statute will be found in the report
ef that ofllcer. The attention of congress
is respectfully called to them In order that,
If It be deemed necessary or advlseb:?. con
gress may correct any defects or Inequali
ties In the law which the Interpretations of
the department of Justice, have made.
"Very soon after tho outbreak of the war
with Bpaln the department was called upon
to take charge of legal proceed frigs for
the conduiiinatiun of vessels and cargoes
captured by the navy as prizes and brought
Into our ports for adjudication. As early
as April 22, two Spanish vessels the Buena
Ventura and the Pedro were so taken,
nnd thereafter similar captures were made
by our warahlpa during the progrcsa of the
war until a total of 66 vesscla were brought
Into vartoua ports and labeled as prizes.
Of thla number 30 were taken to Key West,
within the Jurisdiction of the southern dis
trict of Florida, four were taken to Charles
ton, one to Savannah, and one to New
Yosk. All but eight of the 60 cases brought
In the Florida district have been heard
and decided, those still undecided being
those captured during the later stages of
the war.
"The attention of congress Is called to
the necessity of providing a more complete
and adequate form of government for
Alaska. The efforts to administer Justice
and maintain order In the territory, with
the large accessions of population that
have recently gone Into that region, re
stricted by the very limited machinery
provided for Alaska In Its original sparsely
populated condition, are attended with
great difficulty and embarrassment The
power of congress to provide a form of
government adapted to the peculiar condi
tions of this territory Is undoubted. Tho
machinery of Justice Is entirely inadequate.
There should be an Incrcaso In the num
ber of Judgea, the number of United States
commissioners and United States district
attorneys. The powers of the united
States commissioners in that territory
should be increased, so as to enable thenv
to hear and conclude minor cases of both
civil and criminal onturc, with right of ap
peal to the territorial district court. Mucn
complaint arises from the operation of tho
fee system in connection with the oflice
of United States commissioner. 1 recom
mend that a change in tho method of com
pensating these otllcers be made, so that
their compensation shall be paid entirely
by a fixed salary, and all fees covered Into
the treasury."
HOW IT WAS SPENT.
Detailed Statement of the Disposition
of the Kmernrency De
fense l'ond.
Washington, Dec. 8. The manner in
which all war' funds wire spent is told
in detail for the first time in letters
kent. from all the dennrt ments nnd bu-
priati
report on the urgent deficiency bill.
Of the emergency national defense fund
of jO.OUO.UUO, the navy department got tho
lu.rge.st amount, viz., f l!l.i73,274. Of this
the department proper spent tl7.7U6,8i'.4,
mainly in buying ships; bureau of yard
and docks, $1,U5K,4!0; equipment, SI,2MJ,&3;
navigation, $124, WKi; ordnance, Ji.tflli.oM;
construction and repair, $1,115,315; steam
engineering, $130,613: supplies and accounts,
$211, 1S4; medicine and surgery, $07,OvU;
marine corps, $10C,C29.
The navy has a balance of $275,000 of this

follows: Office of secretary of war, $116,
206; ordnance bureau, $1,71)7,036; engineer

master's bureau, $136,944; chief signal of
llcer, $23S,S:K); lighthouse board, $C9,866.
Secretary Ilay states In a letter to the

ceived $313,0u0 In tlve allotments from the
emergency fund. Of this amount the sum
of $100,000 has been transferred to the hank
ers for this department at London, Eng

cerning the treasury's expenditures of the
emergency fund:
"Allotments cf $10,000 for Investigating
the administration of civil affairs in Porto
IMco have been made to the department,
all of which will probably be expended.
An allotment of $75,000 for' expenses of
commission of Inquiry into the conduct of
the war has also been made to the treas
ury department, of which $20,000 have been
advanced to the disbursing agent of the
i time to state.
Ilia Action Approved.
London, Dec. 10. The Madrid corre
spondent of the Standard says: Senor
Montero Kios acted under instructions
from the government when he declined
to accede to the American demands
concerning the Carolines, and inti
mated a desire to close the negotiations.
Both the government nnd the press ap
prove his action and protest against tho
conduct of the United States. Every
body in Spain is pleased that the nego
tiations are ended, because nil had been
apprehensive that fresh pretensions on
the part of the United States would
be sprung upon the Spanish peace com
missioners at every sitting.
Slain at Church.
Missouri City, Mo., Dec. 0. What will
undoubtedly prove to be a double mur
der waa committed Thursday night in
a country church two miles out from
Missouri City. Miss Delia Clevenger
was shot dow n, mortally wounded, and
her escort to the meeting house, George
Allen, was instantly killed. The mur
derer was Ernest Clevenger, cousin to
the young woman who was one of his
victims.

New York, Dec. 10. The warpaint of
the ships at thia atatlon is to be covered

Spanish View of the Message.
Madrid. Deo. 7. The semiofficial Lib
eral regards President McEJnley'a mes

repetition of the calumny in regard to

THE HOPE OF THE CONTINENT.
Western Canada tho "Dread-Ilasket
of the Empire."
The- attention directed to the wheat
Deldsof western Canada during the post
year has caused thousands of settlers
from different parts of the United
States to muke their homes there dur
ing the past few months. They report
that their experience corroborates what
tad been told them of that wonderful
country, nnd they are sending back to
their friends most favorable reports.
During the pasit summer a number of
Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota
editors visited western Cunada, nnd the
following extracts are from a very flat
tering letter written to the Gcrmania
of Milwaukee by its able contributor,
Prof. Sheridan.
'The numerous elevators along the
line, towering so far above the 6ur
rouuding country that they may be
eeen for many miles distant, suflicient-
ly indicate that the chief industry is
the growing of wheat. At tihe village of
Indiau Bead, more than 1,000,000 bush
la of wheat were marketed last year.
This wo3 but a fraction of the amount
of the Mine product marketed at the
larger cities of Brandon and Itegina. At
Indian Head the representative of the
Germania was told by a farmer that he
was about to harvest his third crop of
wheat from the farm upon one plowing
given it the fall of 1895; tlhe crops of the
current year and of last year having
been sown upon the stubble of the pre
ceding crop. This farmer expected a
yield of not less than 40 bushels to the
acre.. The farms are very large. The
absence of hills and rocks contributes
to making farming on a large scale an
easy matter. There was an abundance
of evidence that the country surround
ing the cities named above is an exten
sive region of fertile lands furnishing
' as great an opportunity for cattle rais
ilng and dairying as for the growing of
lvxieat."
"We were surprised to find here a rich
growth of nearly every species of cul
tivable plant known in Wisconsin.
Various species of trees were growing,
showing that its soil and its climate are
favorable to the growth of forcsits. The
, writer had never seen a more promis
, ing growth of wheat, oats and garden
vegetables than w as observed here.
! The experimental farm of Wisconsin,
' located at Madison, produces nothing
! better." J
"The people along the line of the rail
road, however, assured us that we were
still far distant from the northern limit
of the w heat growing belt, and that 500
miles farther north, wheat and other
agricultural products were cultivated
with success. The inhabitants do not
depend solely upon the growing of
wheat, but utilize vast acres in raising
cattle. The growing grain and vege
tables sQiowed that a plentiful supply
of rain had fallen during the current
year."
"From this city (Calgary) our party
was taken north 200 miles to Edmon
ton, a town of 5,000 people, situated on
the north Saskatchewan river. The
country at this point is beautiful, pre
senting very much the appearance of
many sections in central and southern
Wisconsin. The people are engaged in
mining for gold, and in raising w heat,
potatoesand cattle. Dairying Is also fol
lowed. This valley seems to be favored
with cuflicient rainfall to produce a
luxuriant growth of grain and vege
tables. The soil is very fertile and tim
ber is abundant. Fields of wheat were
observed that promise a yield of 40
bushels per acre. The many good
farmhouses seen from the railway are
evidence of the prosperity of the set
tlers. Edmonton is the terminus of the
roud and the place where the overland
expeditions start from for the Yukon,
it being about 800 miles from Dawson
City."
"The members of the association
made the acquaintance of the Cana
dians of the nortihwest and learned
something of the vast extent of their
territory and of its great resources,
which are destined to make it our most
formidable commercial competitor in
the world's markets for the sale of ag
ricultural products. We learned that
the northwest territory of Canada, In
stead of being a barren waste as taught
by our geographies of n quarter of a
century ago. is capable of sustaining aa
empire of 50,000.000 people."
The Modern Idea.
A teacher in a local primary school in
an endeavor to inculcate a moral lesson in
the receptive minds of her little charges
asked them what they would do if they had
a ftreat deal of money. With remarkable
unanimity the pupils replied that they
would donate it to plcnsinR others. They
didn't say so in chorus, but the answers ran
down the line in about this fashion:
"I'd buy a present for papa."

Te L. Randolph,
Cameron, Texas,
wroto to Dr. Hayes in 1897 :
" I have not had Asthma since taklnf
your treatment tor six weeks In 1 893,
nor have I had any symptoms of It."
Now hers is a case of tho most severe
typo of
Asthma
which Dr. Hayes cured by tho use of con
stitutional alteratives and tonics, and Mr.
Randolph has stayed cured for six years.
The Idea that Asthma Is incurable because
physicians generally can do no more than
five temnorarv relief, la a mnt Hirilnrahla
error. The use of symptom drugs is bo
uiuvbimi, ana meir tenure so inevnaoie,
that people are alow to believe that the dis
ease can be cured at all. But Dr. P. Harold
Hayes, of Buffalo. N. Y., quotes hundreds
and even thousands of cases from his prac
tice similar to the above.
