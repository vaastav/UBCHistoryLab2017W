PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
Read in Con j rm* Tuesday, fJeceinber J,
DSGI.
Felloir ( iti :e,if „( the Senate ami llousi of Retiretnta
tirrx:
In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we
have Cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good
health and most abundant harvests.
You will not lot surprised to learn, that ill the peculiar
exigencies of the our intercourse with forej-n
nations has been attended with profound solicitude,
chiefly turning upon our own domestic affair*. A dis
loyal portion of the American people have, during the
w hole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and
destroy the Union.
A tuition which endures factions domestic division
IS exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, if not
both, is -tire, sooner or later, to invoke foreign inter
vention Nations thus tempted to interfere are not
always unlc to resist t!if counsels of si*ominpj oxputli
ency and ungenerous ambition, although measures
adopted under sueh influences seldom fail to be un
fortunate, and injurious to those adopting tliem.
1 he disloyal citizens of the United States who have
offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid
and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have
received less patronage and encouragement than tliev
probably expected. If it Were just to suppose, as the
insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign na
tions, in this ease, discarding all moral, social and
treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for
the most speedy restoration of commerce, including
especially tlie acquisition of cotton, these nations ap
pear as yet not to have seen their wav to their object
more directly or clearly through the destruction, than
through the preservation of the Union.
it we could dare to believe that foreign nations are
actuated by uo higher principle than this, I am quite
sure a sound argument could lie made to show them
that they can reach their aim more readily and easily
by aiding to crush this rebellion than b'y giving en
couragement to it. The principal lever relied on bv
the insurgents for exeitjng foreign nations to hostility
against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassment
ot commerce. These nations, how ever, not iinpr<>)>-
ablv saw froU) !b" first thai if was the Union which
made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce.
They can scarcely have failed to perceive thai the ef
fort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and
that one strong nation promises more durable peace
and more extensive and reliable commerce, than
can the same nation broken into hostile fragment
It is not tny purpose to review our discussions with
foreign States, because whatever might be their m-di
es, or dispositions, the integrity of our country and
the stability ot oar government mainly depend Hot
upon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism and
intelligence of the American people.
The correspondence itself with the usual reserva
tion- is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will
appear that w have practised prudence and liberali
ty towards foreign powers, averting causes of irr.ta
tion H id witii tirmiu-ss maintainingoqrown rightsai d
honor. Since, however, it is apparent tliat here, a- in
every other State, foreign dangers necessarily attend
domestic difficulties. I recommend that ;idequat<
and ample measures be udoptvd for maintaining ilie
public defences on every side.
While under this general recommendation provi--
ion for defending our iteaeoast line occurs to the mind,
i also, in the same connection, ask the attention <>t
Congress to our great lakes and river-. It is leli"t ed
that some fortifications and depots of arms and mu
nition-, with harbor aud navigation improvements. >1!
at well selected points upon these, would be of great
importance to the national defence and preservation.
I ask attention to the view- of the Secretary of War
expressed iu his report upon the same general stile
je. t. I deem it of importance that the loyal region
of Kast Tennessee and Western North Carolina should
be connected with Kentucky and other faithful parts
of the Union by railroad. I therefore recommend, as
a military measure, that Congress provide forthe con
struction of such juvi as speedily as possible. Ken
tucky. no doultt. will co-operate and. through her Leg
islature. make the most judicious selection of n line.
The northern teriiiinii* must connect with sonic exis
ting railroad, and whether the ruto shall be from
Lexington or Niebola-vilie to the Cumberland Gap, or
from Lebanon to tlie Tei)qesgea line in the direction of
Knoxvilie. or un some still different liue can readily
be determined. Kentucky and the General Govern
ment co-operating, the w : ork can lie completed in a
very short time, and, when done, it will lie noj only of
va-t present usefulness, but&lsoa valuable permanent
improvement, with its cost, in all the future
borne treaties designed chiefly for the interests of
commerce, and having no grave political importance,
have been negotiated, und will lie submitted to the
Senate for their consideration.
Although we have failed to induce some of the com
mercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration of the
rigor of a maratune war, we have removed all obstruc
tions from the way of this humane reform, except
sueh as are merely of temporary and accidental oe.-
citrrene.
I invite vour intention to the correspondence be
tween her itritanoie Majesty's Minister, accredited to
this Government, and the Secretary of State relative
to the detention of the British ship Perthshire, in Jtit)e
last, by the pgited States steamer Massachusetts, for
a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention
was occasioned by ah obvious misapprehension of the
foots, and as justice requires that we should commit
no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanc
tioned by public law, I recommend that an appropji
ation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the
owners of the vessel for her detention.
1 repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, m
his last annual message to Congress in December last,
jn regard to the disposition of the surplus which will
probahly remain after satisfying the claims of Ames,
lean citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of
the Commissioners under the act of the 3d of March,
1 559 - , . ~
If, however, it should not be deemed advisable to
carry that recommendation into effect, I would sug
gest" that authority be given for investing the prinei-.
pal of the proceeds of the surplus referred to in good
securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such oth
er just claims of opr citizens against China as are not
unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our exten
sive trade with that empire.
By an act of the sth of August last, Congress au
thorized the President to instruct the Comman
ders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against
and capture pirates. This authority has been exer
cised in a single instance only. For the more effect
ive protection of our extensive and valuable co|p mer c®
jn tho Eastern seas, especially, it seems to me that it
would be advisable to authorize the commanders of
sailin" vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates
may make of Doited States vessels and their cargoes,
ana the Consular Courts now established by law in
Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases, in the event
that this should be objected toby the loyal authorities.
If any good reason exists why vye should persevere
longer our recognition of the indepen
dence of Hayti and Liberia, 1 am unable to discover it.
Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in
regard to them without the approbation of Congress,
I submit for your consideration the expediency ot
an appropriation for maintaining a charge d' affairs
near each of those new states: it does of a
doubt that important commercial advantages might

I shall again bless tho laud.
1 respectfully refer to the report of theSecrotarv of
; War for information respecting the numeral strength
, of the army and for recommendations, having in view
, an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the
I various brunches of the service entrusted to his care,
j It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the peo
: pie lias proved equal to the occasion, and that the
nnnilier of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force
which Congress authorized me to "call into tho field.
I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report
| wlyeh makes allusion to the creditable degree of dt
, eiplitie already attained by our troops and to the ex-
I eellent sanitary condition of the entire army.
1 The recommendation of the Secretary for an ormut
| ization of tin- militia upon a uniform basis is asulyccl
of vital importance to the future safety of the coun
try, and is recommended to the scrmtis attention of
foil "res.
The large addition to the regular army in eonnce
rion with the defection thai has so considerably di
! iniiitslted the number of its wffieers.giv-especuliriiu
portanee to his recommendations for increasing the
j corps of Cadets to the greatest capacity of thMiii
' tary Academy.
i By mere omission. I presume. Congress lias failed
i to provide Chaplains for hospitals occupied by volttii
j teers. This subject was hronght to my notice, and i
was induced to draw up the form of a letter. one copy
of which, properly addressed, has been delivered to
each of the persons artd at the dates, rcsjicetivelv
named, and stated in a schedule, containing also the
form of the letter (letter marked A), and herewith
transmitted.
The gentlemen I understood entered upon the du
ties designated at tlie times respectively stated in the
schedule, and have labored faithtiilly there ever since.
I therefore recommend that tlicy be compensated at
the same rates as Chaplains in the Army, turther sug
gesting that general provision 1- made" for Chaplains
to serve at Hospitals hm well as with regiments.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents
iu detail the operations of that branch of the service,
the activity and energy which have characterised its
administration.and the results .f the measures to in
crease its efficiency and pow er.
Such have been the additions by construction and
purchase, that it may almost he said A Navy has been
created and brought into service since our difficulties
commenced. Besides blockading our extensive const,
squadrons larger than ever lie fore assembled under
our flag, have leeii put afloat and performed deeds
which have increased our Nat al renown.
I would invite special attention to the recommen
dation of the Secretary for more perfect organization
of the Navy, by introducing additional grades ill the
service. The present organization is defective and
mi satisfactory, and the suggestions submitted by the
f'epartment will it is believed, if adopted, obviate the
difficulties alluded to. promote harmony, and increase
the efficiency of the Navy.
There are three vacancies <>n the bench of the Su
preme Court; two by the decease ot Justices Daniels
and McLean, and one by tin- resignation of Justice
Campbell. I have so far forborne making in.munitions
to till these vacancies lor reasons which 1 will now
state: Two of the outgoing Judges resided within
Ibe States ii.. overrun with revolt, so that if thpir
successors were appointed in the s.uiiie localities.they
eould not serve upon their circuit, and many of the
most competent men there probably Would not take
the p.-s soi.:.'l hazard of aeeepting to serve, even here,
upon tlm supreme ismch. I liiive been unwilling to
throw all tin; appointments up >n the Northward, thus j
disabling myself front doing iii-dice to the South. u
the return of peace, although I u)ay remark that to
trn-fer to the North one which has hitherto been in
the South, would not. with reference t . territory ami
pop'ii.'.'ioi). Is- unjust.
During the long and brilliant jit li'-isd career of Judge I
McLean, his circuit grew m'to ah <nplfc ..'together
too large for any one Judge to give the courts there in
more than a nominal attcipi iie-c. riving in population
from I.tTIMMS iu W. to j : ,' lsoo. Besides
■ his, tin- e..uutry jUKHiim hits outgrown our present
judicial system', if uniformity was at all intended, i
tin system requires thai all the States shall be ace., m
modated with ••.reint e >uri attended by Supreme i
Judges, while, iu fact, Wisconsin. Minnesota. lowa. ,
K ins-as. Florida. Texas. 'aliform.. and 'qegon have i
never had any such Cyurjs.
Nr can tin's well be remedied, without a change of
the system. InVaUse tlf ..iding o. Judges to the "ill- I
preme f'otirt, enough for the accommodation of all |
part" of the country with ';r3itit t'oiirts. would create i
a court altogether too num-rous for a judicial body of
ir sort. And the evil, if it be one. will incrotisc as
new States come into the Union. Circuit t'ourts are
useful, or thev are not useful. If useful, no State
should be rb'mod them. If not useful, no State
should have tliem. Let them be provided for all. or
abolish all.
Three modification occur to me, either of which I
think would be an improvement upon our present
svstem. Let the Supreme Court be. of convenient
number in every event. Then first, let the whole
country be divided into circuits of convenient size,
the Supreme Judges to serve in a number of them
corresponding to their own number, and independent
Circuit Judges be provided for all the rest:or. second
ly. let the Supreme Judges be relieved from circuit
duties, and Circuit Judges provided for all the Circuits;
or, thirdly, dispense with the Circuit Courts altogether,
leaving the judicial functions wholly to the District
Court and an independent Supreme Court.
I respectfully recommend to the consideration of
Congress the present condition <>t" the Statute Laws,
with the hope that Congress will he able to find an ea
sy remedy tor many of the inconvenieneies and evils
which constantly embarrass those engaged in the
practical administration of them. Since the organi
zation of Government. Congress has enacted some
five thousand acta and joint resolutions, which fill more
than sis thousand cjo.-cly printed pages, and are scat
tered through many volumes. .
Many of these acts have been drawn iu haste and
without sufficient caution, so that their provisions arc
often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each
other, or at least, so doubtful as to render it very difficult
(~f oyrqi the best informed person to ascertain pre
cisely what the statute law ready is.
It 'seems to me very important that the stat
ute laws should lie made as plain and intelligible
as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as
mav consist, with the fulness and precision of the Leg
islation and the perspicuity of its language. This,
well done, would, i think, greatly facilitate the labors
of those w hose duty it is to assist in the administra
tion of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the
I people by placing before them, in a more acceptable
and intelligible form, the laws which so deeply con
cern their interests and their duties. lam informed
by some whose opinion I respect that all the acts of
Congress now in torce. and of a permanent and gen
eral nature, might be revised and rewritten, so as to
be embraced in one volume, or, at most in two vol
umes. of ordinary and commercial size, and 1 respect
fully recommend to Cangyess to consider the sub
ject and if rnv suggestion be improved, to devise snch
pian as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for
the attainment of the end proposed.
One ot the unavoidable consequences of the
rection is the entire suspension, in many places, of all
the ordinary moans of administering civil mstice by
the officers and the forms of existing law. I his is the
ease in whole, or in part, in the insurgent States, and
as our armies advance and tak® possession of parts of
those States, it becomes more apparent.
There are no courts or officers to which the citizens
of other States may apply for the enforcement of their
lawful claim," against tne citizens of the insurgent
States, imd their vast amount of debt, constituting
such claims, some have estimated at Uvo hundred mil
lions of dollars due, the large part from insurgents in
open rebellion, to loyal citizens who are even now
making great sacrifices in the discharge of their pat
riotic duty to support the Government.
Under these circumstances I have been urgently so
licited to establish by military power Courts to admin
ister summary justice in. such cases. I have thus tar
declined to do it. not because I had any doubt that tne
end proposed, the collection of the debts, was just and
right in itself, but beca u/ne I have been unwijiingto go
bevond the pressure of necessity, in the unusual ex
ercise of power. But the powers of Congress. I sup
pose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and 1 there
fore refer the whole matter to Congress with the nope
that a plan may he devised for tue adminisration ot.
justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and
Territories as may be under the control of this Gov
ernment, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance
and order, or by the power of our arms. 'I his, how
ever, is not to be a permanent lMtitution. but a tem
i porarv substitute, arid to cease as soon as the ordinary
courts can In- re-estjihli-hed in pea-e. It is important
that some more convenient m.-aiis 5h..u1,l be provided
if possible, for the .adjustment of claim- against the
Government, especially in view of their increased
numb- r bv reason of the war.
It is as much the duty of the Government to render
prompt justic- ti"ainst itself in favor of citizens, as it
is to administer tlie same between private individuals
—the investigation and adjudication of claims in their
hands belong to the judicial department. Hesides.it
is apparent that tic attention of Congress trill be more
than usually engaged for some time to come with
great national questions. It was intended bv the or
ganization of tin- Court of Claims, maitilv to*remote
this branch of the business from the Halls of Congress.
But while the Court has proved to be an effective
and valuable means of investigation, it fails in n great
degree to effect the object of its creation f„ r wmit i.f
power to make its judgments final. Fully aware of
the deliem-v. not to say the danger, of this subject. I
commend to your careful consideration whether this
power of making judgments final mav not properly
t>e given to the Court reserving the riglit of appeal oil
questions of law to the Supreme Court—with such
other provisions as experience may have shown to be
necessary.
l u-k attention to the report of the Postmaster Gen
eral. the following lieing a summary statement of that
Department;— The revenue from all sources during
the fiscal year ending June 30. isol. including the an
nual permanent appropriation of seven hundred thous
and dollars for the transportation iff free mail matter,
is nine millions, forty-nine thousand two hundred and
ninety-six dollars and forty cents, being about two
per cent, less than the revenue.
For I*6o. the expenditures were $13,606,750 11, show
ing a ib-crease of more than eight per cent., as com
pared with those of the previous year, and leaving an
• •xeess of expenditures over the revenue for tho Inst
fiscal year, of f4.557 4ti'2 7!. The gross revenue for the
year ending June 3oth. 1*63. Is estimated at four per
cent, upon that of I*6l, making S*,GB3.tXK), to which
should t>e added the earnings of the Department in
carrying free mutter, viz: S7Ii.OOU, makings9.3*3.ooo.
The total expenditures for I*o3 are estimated at $12.-
529.000. leaving an estimated deficiency of three mil
lions. one hundred and forty-five thousand dollars to
be supplied from the Treasury, in addition to the per
manent appropriation.
Tin- present insurrection shows. I think, that the
extension of this district across the Potomac river at
the tune of establishing the Capital here was evident
ly wise, and consequent)- that the relinquishment of
that portion of it which lies within the .State of Vir
ginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for vour
consideration the expediency of regaining that part
of the district, and the restoration of the original
boundaries thereof, through negotiations with the
State of Virginia.
The report of Hi- Secretary of tlie Interior, with the
accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of
the several branches of the public service (P 2 and 3)
pertaining to that Department. Tlo-depressing influ
ences of tin- insurrection have been especially felt in
the operations of the Patent and General Lund Offiees.
The cash receipts from tlie .-ales of public lands du
ring the past year have exceeded the expenses of our
land system only about two hundred thousand dollars.
The sales have been entirely suspended in the South
ern States, while the interruption to the business of
the country and the diversion of large numbers of
men from labor to military service, have obstructed
settlements in the new States and Territ tries of the
Northwest.
The receipts of the Patent Office i are declined in
nine months about Sltiu.ooo rendering u large deduc
tion of the force employed necessary to make it self
sustaining.
The demand- upon the pension office will lie large
ly increased by tlie insurrection.
Numerous applications for pensions, upon the
easuaiities of the existing war. have already been
made. There is rea-on to believe thai many who are
now upon the pension rolls, and m receipt of the
bounty of the Government, are in the ranks of the in
surgent army, giving thion aid aud comfort. The
Secretary of the Interior has directed a ail-pension
of the pay m nt of the pensions of sueh J-ersoil- upon
proof of their disloyalty.
I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to
cause tin- names of such p -rsons to lie stricken from
tiie pen-ion roll.
Tlie relations of tfie Government with the Indian
tribes hive bemi greatly di-tnrbed by the insurrection,
especially in the Southern Siiporiiitendeney. and in
that of New Mexico. I'he Indian country south of
Kansas is hi the poasexsjoti of the insurgents from
T-. xa- and Arkansas.
Tie- agents f ill- United States tt -vernm-'-nt ap
pointed since the Jih of March for this stiperinteu
■ y. have been unable t-> reach their posts, while the
most of those who were in the offiee before that time
have espoused the insurrectionary <-Hit-e. ami as
sume to exercise tin- p-rw-T- of agents i-v virtue of
eominis-iotis from the insurrectionists.
ft has been stated in the public press that a portion
of these Indians have been organized a- a military
f--r • and gro attached to lit-- army --I the insurgents.
Although the Government I'-a- no official information
upon this subject, letters have been written to the
< oinmi--ion -r of Indian Affairs bv several prominent
Chief-, giving assmao of th-'lr royalty to the United
State- and expressing :t wish hr tin- presence of Fed
eral troop* to protect tlu iii. i: is believed that upon
tie- re-possession of tlv country, by the Federal for
e, s. the Indians will rcaujiy ijc.aso ail hostile demon
strations and resumo tie it former relations to tie-
Government.
Agriculture, confessedly the largost interest of tho
nation, has not a Department or a bureau, but a clerk
ship only assigned to is in the Government. While it
is fortunate that this great interest is so independent
in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted
more from the. Government. I respectfully ask Con
gress to consider whether something more cannot be
given voluntarily with general advantage.
Annual reports exhibiting the oominion ot our Ag
riculture. eomme'reo and manufacture, would present
a fund of information of great practical value to the
eouutry. While 1 make no suggestion us to details,
I venture the opinion that an Agricultural and Statis
tics! Bureau might profitably be organized.
The execution of tlie laws for the suppression of
the African Slave Trade, has been confined to the De
partment of the Interior. It is a subject of gratula
tton that the efforts which have been made for the
suppression of this inhuman traffic, j iaV e been re
cently attended with unusual success. J-'jye vessels
being fitted out for the slave tfgda hfive been seized
ami condemned. Two mutes of vessels engaged in
the trade, and one person engaged in equipping a
slaver, have been convicted and subjected to the pen
alty of tine and imprisontnent; and one captain taken
with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been
convicted of the highest grade of offence to our laws,
the punishment of which is death.
The Territories of Colorado. Dacota and Nevada,
created by the last Congress, have been organized,
I and civil administration has been inaugurated therein
under auspices especially gratifying; when it is con
sidered that the fevcti "of treason was found ex
isting in some of tliase new countries when the Fed
eral officers arrived there. The abundant native resour
ces of these Territories, with the security of protec
tion offered by an organized Government, w ill doubt
less invite in'thein a large immigration, when peace
shall restore the business of the country to its accus
tomed channels.
I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of Col
orado. which evidence the patriotic spirit of the peo
ple of the Territory.
So far the authority of the United States has been
upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will tie
in the future. I commend their interests audde
fence to tho enlightened and generous eare of Con
gress.
i recommend to the favorable consideration oi Con
gress the interests c.f the district of Columbia. The
insurrection has been the cause of inijeh suffering
and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no
representative. Congress should not overlook their
just claims upon the Government.
At your late session a joint resolution was adopted
authorizing the President to take measures for facili
tating a proper representation of the industrial inter
ests of tne United States, at the Exhibition of the In
dustry of all Nations, to lie holden in London in the
year 1*62.
1 Tcgret to say, I have been unable to give personal
attention to this subject—a subject ftt once so inter- ,
estingr in itself, and so extensively and intimately ooiv
neeted with the material prosperity of the world. — ;
Through the Secretaries of the Mate and the Interior,
a plan or system has been devised and partly matured
and will be laid before you. i
Under the virtue of the Act of Congress, entitled an
Act to Confiscate Property, approved August fitli,
the legal claims of certain persons to tl>e labor and
service of certain other persons have become forfeit
ed, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are. al
ready dependent on the United States, and roust tie
provided for in some way. Besides it is not impos
sible that some of the States will pass similar enact
ments for their own benefit respectively, and by oper
ation of which persons of the same class will be
thrown upon them for disposal.
In such case I recommend that Congress provide
for accepting such persons from such States accor
ding to some mode of valuation in lieu pro tanto of
direct tajtes, or upon some other plan to be agreed
upon with suah States respectively, that such per
sons on such acceptances by the General Government
he at once deemed free, and that in any event steps
be taken for colonizing both classes (ou the que first
mentioned if the other shall not be brought into exis
tence.) at some place or places in a climate congenial
to them. It might be well to consider too, whether
!h. free colored people already in the United States,
eonld not, so far as ltidivi luals mav desire, be i .
eluded 111 sueh colonization
To carry out the plan of colonisation tnav involve
toe aequintiji of territory aud also the appropriation
of money beyond that to be expended in the territor
ial a •quisition. Having practiced the acquisition of
territory for nearly sixty years, the question of the
(-institutional power to do so is no longer ci open one
with its. The power was questioned at first bv Mr.
JelFerson. who. however, in the purchase of Houis
mna. yielded to his scruples on the plea of great ex
pediency.
If it IK- said that the only legitimate object of ac
quiring territory is to furnish homes for white men.
this measure effects that object, for emigration of
colored men leaves additional room lor wlntciiieu re
maining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however,
placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more
on political and commercial grounds, than on provid
ing room for population.
on this whole proposition, including the appropria
tion of money witii the acquisition of territory, does
not the expediency amount to absolute necessity—
without which the Government itself cannot lie per
petuated if the war continues.
In considering over the poliev to be adopted
for suppressing the insurrection,' I have been anx
ious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this
purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and re
morseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore,
in every ease, thought it proper to keep the integri
ty of the Union prominent as the primary object of
the contest on our part. Waving ail questions 'which
tire not of vital military importance, to the more de
liberate action of the Legislature.
In the exercise of my best discretion I have adher
ed to tlie blockade of the port* held by the insur
geants. instead of putting in force bv proclamation
the law of Congress ena -ted at the (ate session for
closing these ports. Ho also, obeying the dictates of
prildenee as well the obligations of law. instead of
transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress
to confiscate property used for insurrectionary pur
poses. If a new lan upon the same subject shall be
proposed, its propriety will Is-.duly considered.
Tlie Union must be preserved, and hence all mdis
peusable means must be employed. We should uotbe
m haste to determine that radical and extreme meas
ures. which may reach the loyal as W ell as the disloyal,
are indispensable.
The Inaugural address at the beginning of tin- Ad
ministration and the message to Congress at the late
special session, were both mainly devoted to tlie die
nicstie controversy out of which the insurrection and
subsequent war has sprung.
Nothing more occurs to add or substrain to or from
the principles of general purposes stated and ex
pressed in those documents. Ihe last ray of hope for
preserving the Union, peaceably, expired at the as
sault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what
has occurred since may be unprofitable.
What was painfully uncertain then, is much lienor
defined and more distinct now. and the progress of
events is plainly iu the right direction. The insur
gents confidently claimed a strong support from
North of Mason and Dixon's line, ami the friends of
the Union were not free from apprehension on that
point. This, however, w.w soon settled definitely and
on the right side.
South of the lino, noble little Delaware led off right
from the first. Maryland was made to serin against
the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges
burned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and
we were many days, at one time, without the ability
to bring a single regiment over her soil to the Capital.
Now her bridges and railroads arc repaired and
open to the Government. She already gives seven
regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the
eni-iny, and her people at the regular election have
sustained the Union by a large majority, and a larger
aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any Can
didate on any question.
Kentucky too, for some time in doubt, is now deci
dedly, and 1 think, unchangeably, ranged on the side
of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet, and
I believe cannot again be overrun by the insurrection
ists. These three States of Maryland. Kentucky and
Missouri, neither of which would promise a single
soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than
forty thousand in the field tor the Union, while of
their citizens, certainly not more than a third of that
number, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubt
ful existence, arc in arms against it. After a some
what bloody struggle of months winter closes nil the
Union people of" Western V irginia, leaving them
masters of I heir own country.
An insurgent force of al'wnit fifteen hundred for
mouths dominating the narrow peninsular region of
tie- counties of Aei o-nae and Northampton, and
known as the Kastern Shore of Virginia, together
with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have lain
down their arms, and the people there have renewed
their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the
old (lag. They have no armed insurrection north of
the Potom to or east of the <'hesapcakc.
Also, we have obtained a footing at each of the iso
lated points oil the southern coast of Hattcras, Port
lioVal. Tybee Island, near Savannah, and Ship Island;
and we likewise have some general accounts of po|>-
ular movements in behalf of the Union, in North t'ur
olinu and Tennessee. Those tilings demonstrate that
the cause of the Union is advancing steadily south
ward.
Since your last adjournment, Lieutcnant-Gencrai
Scott has retired front the head of tlie army. During
his l->ng life the nation has not been unmindful of his
merit. 1 et. ou calling la utind how faithfully, ably and
brilliantly he has served the country front* a time far
back in our history, when few of the now living had
been born, and thenceforward continually. I cannot
but think we are still his debtors. 1 submit, therefore,
for your consideration, jrhat further mark of recogni
tion is due to him and to ourselves, a- a grateful peo
plo.
\\ ith the retirement of General Scott, canto the ex
ecutive duty of appointing in his stead a General-in-
Chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance
that neither in council or country was there, so far as
I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper
person to be selected- The retiring Chief repeatedly
expressed iiis judgment in favor of General MeClcllan
for the position, and in tins the nation decreed to give
a unanimous concurrence.
The designation of General MeCiellan is therefore
in a considerable degree, the selection of the country
as well as of the Executive, and hence there is better
reason to hope that there will is- given liini the confi
dence and cordtid support thus, by fair implication,
promised, and without which lie cannot with so full
efficiency serve the country. It has been said that
one bad General is better than two good ones, and the
saying is true, if taken to mean no more than that our
ariny is better directed by a single mind, though in
ferior. than by two superior ones at variance and eruss
purposes with each other. And the same is true in
all joint observations wherein those engaged can have
none but a common end in view and can differ only a*
t-> the choice of means.
In a storm at sea. no one can wish the ship to sink,
ami yet, not unfrequently, all go down together, be
cause too many will direct, and no single mind can lie
allowed to control,
It continues to develop that theinsnnrection is lnrge
ly. if not exclusively. a war upon tin* first principles
of popular government—the rights of the people.
Conclusive evidence oi this is found in the most grave
and maturely considered public documents, as well as
m the general tone of the insurgents.
In these documents >ve find the abridgement of the
existing right of suffrage, and the den.ial to the people
of ail right to participate in the selection of public of
ficers. except the Legislature, boldly advocated, with
labored arguments, to prove that large control of the
people it; government is the source of all political evil.
Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible
refuge from the power of the people.
In my present position 1 could scarcely he justified
were I "to omit raising a warning voice against this ap
proach of returning despotism.
It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argu
ment should he made in favor of popular institutions,
lint there is one point with its connections, not so
hackneyed as most others, to which 1 ask a brief at
tention.
It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing
with if not above labor, in the structure of the Gov
ernment. It is assumed that labor is available only in
connection with capital; that nobody labors unless
somebody else owning capital, somehow by the use of
it. induces hint to labor. Tills presmned.it is next con
sidered whether it is best that capital shall hire labor
ers. and thus induce them to work, by their own eon
sent, or buy them and drive them to it without their
consent.
Having proceeded so far. it is naturally concluded
that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we
call slaves. And further, it is assumed, that whoever is
once a hired laborer, is fixed in that cottecticn for life.
No's there is no such relation between capital and la
bor, as assumed, nor- js there any such thing as a free
man being fixed for life in the rendition of a hired la
borer. Both these assumptions are false, and all in
ferences from then; are groundless. Labor is prior
to and independent of capital. Capital is only the
fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor
had not first existed.
Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much
higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which
are as worthy of protection as any other rights.
Nor is it denied that there is alia probably always will
be a relation between labor ana capital, producing
mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the
whole labor of the community exists within that rela
tion. , , , ...
A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor, or
bay another few to labor for them. A large majority
belong to neither class, neither working for others,
nor have others working for rbem
New Series— Vol. XVI, No. 7.
! Uc m oeom f the r - s ,7 uth r rn BU, ** S a majority of the
, lis rV H '- color.-, are neither slaves nor
masters, wlnlo in the Northern, a Urge majority are
neither hirers nor hired. M.-n wtih their families,
wires, sons and daughters, work for themselves on
t icir farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking
the whole product- to themselves, and asking nofkvo?
of capital ou the one hand nor of hired laborers or
slaves on the other.
It is not forgotten that a considerable uuniber of
persons mingle their own labor with their capital—
that is. they labor with their own hands and also buy
or hire others to labor for them: but this is only a mix
ed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is dis
turbed by the existence of this mixed class.
Again, as has already been said, there is not of neoes
sity anv such thing as the free hired lalairer being tlx
el to that condition for life. Many independent ncn
everywhere in these States, a t'ew'years back in their
lives, were hired laborers.
I lie prudent, penniless beginner 111 the world, la
bors for wages aw hile, saves a surplus with which lt>
buy tools or land for himself, theu labors on his own
account another while, and at length liiros another
new beginner to help hun.
This is the just, aud generous and prosperous syy
t-m which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and
consequently energy and progress and improvement
ot condition to all. No men living are more worthy
to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty.
None less inclined to take or touch aught which they
have not honestly earned, l.et them la-ware of sur
rendering a political power which they already pos
scss. and which, if surrendered, w ill surely be used to
close the door of advancement against sueh as they,
aud to fix new disabilities and burdens upon thorn, till
all of liberty shall bo lost.
From the first taking of our national eonsns to the
last one. seventy years, we find our population it
the end of the period eight times as great as it was at
the beginning. The increase of those other things
which men deem desirable has been greater.
We thus have at one view what the popular princi
ple applied to Government through the machinery of
the States and the Union has produced in a given ti'm%
and also w hat, if firmly maintained, it promises for
the future.
There are also among us those who, if the Union be
preserved, will live to see it contain two hundred and
tili\ millions. The struggle of to-day is not altogeth
er for to-dnv ; it is for a vast future also. With a reli
anee on Providence, all the more firm und earnest, lot
us proceed iu the great task which events have devol
ved upon us.

The report of the Secretary of the Navy in
an extremely interesting document. It fully
approves the conduct of Captain Wilkes in
capturing Mason and Slidell, and pays a
merited compliment to tha commanders of
the fleets who were so brilliantly successful
at Fort Ilatteras nnd Port Koyttl. It also
devotes considerable space to a discussion of
the rebel privateer*.
The rapid increase of the naval force is one
of the most marvellous events of the war.—
There is now a total of 204 vessels, 2,557
guns, and 218,010 tons; the aggregate num
ber of seamen in service now is 22,000 ; last
March there were hut 7,000 men, 42 vessels,
and 555 guns, itcontnins a number of im
portant recommendations in regard to tho
policy to be pursued in reference to fugitive
slaves and other subjects. The following ea

important Order to Gen. McCtellnn.
Genekai.: —1 am directed by the President
to call your attention to the following subject;
Person* claimed to he held to service or la
bor under the laws of the State of Virginia
end actually employed in hostile scrviie
against the Government of the United States
frequently escape from the lines of the ene
mies forces and aro received within the line*
of the army of the Potomac. This depart
ment undeistands that such persons after
wards coming into the city of Washington are
liable to he arrested by the city police upon
the presumption arising from color that they
are fugitives fr mi service or labor.
By the 4th section of Act of Congress, ap
proved August 0, 18GI, entitled 'an Act to
confiscate property used for insurroctii nary
purposes,' such hostile employment is made
a full and sufficient answer to any further
| claim to service or labor. Persons thus em
j ployed and escaping aro received into tho
' military protection of the Unied States, nnd
. their arrest as fugitives from service or labor
should be immediately followed by the mili
tary arrest of the parties nuiking the seizure,
i Copies of this communication will be sent to
the Mayor of the city of Washington and to
the Marshal of the District of Columbia, that
any collision between the civil and military
authorities may ho avoided.
