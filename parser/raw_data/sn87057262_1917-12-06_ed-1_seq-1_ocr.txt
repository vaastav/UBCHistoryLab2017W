According to the official statement,
the first group of the sky-killers was

machines at various plaoes.
The second group put in an ap
pearance at 8 a. m., and proceeded
up the rirer Thames, also into Kant.
Between 4 and 4:30 o'clock two more
groups crossed Essex. These joined
with the three groups which had
passed over Kent and the machines,
in a converging column, started to

Lara French announced that the

Opening debate olearly showed that
sentiment in favor of lnoluding Bul
garia and Turkey among the enemies
of this country has not cooled de
spite President Wilson's recommend
ation.
Representative Miller of Minne
sota, advocating immediate adoption
of the Austrian resolution, urged
that Turkey and Bulgaria be Included.
*He scouted the idea that by with
holding such action the United States
might "wean these countries from
Germany."
"The presence of the Bulgarian
and Turkish representatives in Wash
ington Is a menace," Miller declared.
"Many allied diplomats feel this. In
formation of our affairs is daily
reaching Berlin. How, I shall not at
tempt to say.
"The Turkish sultan belongs on the
bosom of the German kaiser," Miller
shouted. "The Turks must live or
die with Germany. I hope they die
with her."
Miller charged that failure of the
United States to supply Italy with
guns and war materials was delayed
for months because this country was
with Austria and that
much of the Italian disaster may be
charged against tho United States.
"We cannot hope to separate Bul
garia and Turkey from Germafiy and
Austria except by force of arms,"
said Miller.
"We must throw away these intel
lectual theories and go in whole
heartedly with our allies in common
cause against all of the enemy."
Miller while emphatically demand
ing war on Bulgaria and Turfcey, de
clared his willingness to await the
president's decision. He was re
peatedly applauded throughout his
address.

A Few Are Missing After the Detach

Advanes Around
Oambral.
[By J. W. Pegler, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
AMERICAN FIEUJ HEADQUAR
TERS, France, Deo. 6.—Search was
begun of British front hospitals today
with the hope of finding some of the
missing American army engineers
caught in the German advance around
Cambral. Until this is completed,
headquarters will probably not issue
any official statement of casualties.
It was semi-officially announced to
day that at least four officers and 280
men of the American army engineer
detachment were In the thick of the
Cambral fighting. This was a party
caught in an enemy barrage at Gau
zeaucourt. Some of them joined nearby
British units and all day long Friday
fought with the Tommies. The re
mainder attempted retirement under
artillery, machine gun and aeroplane
fire. A majority of the whole, it was
Btated, reached their base camp at
Fins. Still others took refuge in dug
cuts and welse captured. Some were
recaptured. A scattering few made
their way back to the American base.
Tho 284 men departed from their
camp at Fins at 6:30 a. m. Friday.
They began their regular work In the
Gauzeaucourt region in conjunction
with a detachment of Canadians under
a Canadian major. This officer is be
lieved to have been a Callfornian and
an ex-member of the famous Canadian
American legion.
At 7 o'clock, shortly after the Ameri
cans and Canadians had arrived on the
job, an enemy barrage enveloped
Gauzeaucourt. Half an hour later,
seeing no let-up In the hall of shells,
the unarmed engineers attempted to
retire.
It was then that a goodly number
joined with nearby British and grab
bing rifles, fought throughout the re
mainder of the day.
While the 284 were In Gauzeaucourt
under barrage, other engineers, in the
camp at Fins began experiencing
shelling by German long range guns.,
Two big shells exploded in the camp
itself. The engineers there were or
dered to scatter. Later they were as
sembled and each given a rifle and
200 rounds of ammunition.
Toward afternoon it was decided to
entrench their camp and the engineers
went lustily to work. By six o'clock
Friday evening they had finished a
four foot trench. Then the detach
ment was withdrawn again to th© base
and held there in readiness to man
British trenches.
An American brigadier general vis
ited the engineers' camp today and
paid generous tribute to their courage,
quick initiative and the coolness in
working under heavy Are.
