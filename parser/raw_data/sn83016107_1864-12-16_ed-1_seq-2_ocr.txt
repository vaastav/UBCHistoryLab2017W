THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The Annua! Message of President Lincoln was
transmitted to Congress on Tuesday, the Oth ot
December, and opens by expressing profound
gratitude to Heaven for the blessings of health
and an abundant harvest. Although the Mes
sage is short, we find it, nevertheless, too long for
our limited space, and are therefore compelled to
limit our readers to the prominent features of the
document.
The president says “the condition of our foreign
affairs is reasonably satisfactory.” Our political
relations with Mexico have undergone no change,
and this country has strictly maintained a neu
trality between the beligercnts.
The difficulties which caused the closing of the
inner oceanic transit route across the isthmus,
have been amicably adjusted, and that great
commercial and political improvement will soon
he^reopehed.
Telegraphic communication with Great liritain,
it is expected, will soon he renewed, and the pro
posed telegraphic communications with Europe
byway of Behring’s Straits, is also in prospect
of accomplishment.
Tbs relations of this country with Japan, Chi
na, Egypt, the Barhary Powers, the Slate of Cen
tral America, and the republics of South Ame
rica, ate generally of the most friendly charac
ter.
The President desires the authority of Congress
to furuish a gunboat to the Liberian Republic to
aid in arresting the slave trade.
The president refers to the opening of the ports
of Norfolk Fcrnandina and Pensacola, and hopes
are expressed that foreign merchants will consid
er it safer to resort to these open ports than to
pursue a contraband trade. He recommends that
foreign slave traders he prevented from acquiring
domicil, Ac., in this country. He says that ‘it
it were a new and open question, the maritime
powers would not concede the principles ofa na
val belligerent to the insurgents of the United
States.” He refers to the unforsecii difficulties !
which have arisen in Brazilian and British ports,
and on the northern boundaries of the United
States.
He recommends the encouragement of emigra
tion as most important to this government und
snys :
The act passed at the late session for the cn
counijjeinent of emigration has, so far as was !
possible, been put into operation. It seems to .
need amendment which will enable the officers of!
Government to prevent the practice of frauds •
against the immigrants while on their way, and j
ou their arrival in the ports; so as to secure them i
here a free choice of avocations and places of set- j
tlemcnt. A liberal disposition towards this great I
national policy is manifested by most of the Eu- j
ropean States and ought to ho reciprocated on
our part, by giving the immigrants effective na
tional protection.
1 regard our immigrants cs one of the princi- i
pal replenishing streams which are appointed by |
Providence to repair the ravages of internal war j
■and its wastes of national strength and health.— j
All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that I
stream in its present fullness, and to that end the |
Government must in every way make it manifest i
that it neither needs nor designs to impose in- j
voluntary military service upon those w ho come
from other lands to cast their lot in our couu
try.
The President slates that the financial affaiis
of the government have been successfully admin
istered. The receipts from all sources during the
year, including loans and balances in the treasu
ry, July Ist, 1803, were sl, 304,706,007.02, and
the aggregate disbursements upon the same ba
sis were $1,208,050,101 80—leaving a balance
in the treasury of $00,730,905 73. The public
debt on the Ist of July last was $1,740,690,-
490 40 ; and should the war continue for anoth
er year, the debt may he increased by about five
hundred millions. The President says. “As Hie
debt is held for (he most part by our own people,
it has become a substantial branch of national,
though private, property ,” and certain sugges
tions arc made to Congress in connection with its
general distribution among the people.
The National Banking system, hesays, is prov
ing to he greatly acceptable to capitalists and the
people ; and lie hopes that very soon there will
he in the United States no hanks of issue not au
thorized by Congress, and no lank-note circula
tion not secured by the government. Five hun
dred and twenty-four national hanks have alrea
dy been organized.
The reports of the Secretaries of War and
Navy are referred to for details of military opera
tions. Tite President says “he concurs with'thc
Secretary of the Treasury in Hie opinion Hint the
proportion of moneys required to meet the expen
ses consequent upon the war, derived from taxa
tion, should Lc still further increased.”
The number of naval captures, since hostilities
commenced, is 1,370 —of which 207 are steamers.
The proceeds of condemned prize properly thus
far reported is $14,30(5.250 51.
The postal revenue for the year ending June 30,
1864, amounts to $12,438,258 78, and the expen
diture to $12,64 4,736 20—the excess of expendi
tures over receipts being $200,652 42.
The report of the Sectetary of the Interior, in
relation to Indian affairs, the Pacific railroad,
mineral discoveries, ic., is commended to the at
tention of Congress.
There have been 4,221,342 acrcsof public land
disposed of duting the five quarters ending 301 h
Of September last, of which 1,538,614 acres wen
entered under the homestead law. The casli re
ceived was $1,019,446. There is now open to
lelliement about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed
land.
The President refers to the importance of re
modeling our Indian system. Also, to the re
markable features in military operations of thi
year—being the attempted march of Gen. Nhev
man through 300 mi'es of the insurgent region.
Also to the fxit that 12,000 citizeai in each ol
| the States of Arkansas and Lousinnn have or- I
j panized loyal governments with a free Constitu- 1
{ tion.
The present number of army pensioners of this
class is 25,433, and of navy pensioners 793. At
the beginning of the year the number of Rcvolu- ,
j tionary pensioners was 1,430 ; only twelve of
| them were soldiers, of whom seven have since
j died. The remainder ate those who under the
j laws, receive pensions because of relationship to l
i Revolutionary soldiers.
During the year ending 30th of June, 1864,
$1,404,616.92 hare been paid to pensioners of
all classes.
The importance of the Agricultural Depart- [
ment is referred to.
The president recommend? the reconsideration
and passage of the proposed amendment to the
Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the
United States and says :
I repeat the declaration mado a year ago, that
while I remain in my prose t position 1 shall not
attempt to retreat or modify the Emancipation
Proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any
person who is free by the terms of that proclama
tion or by any of the nets Congress.
If the people should, by whatever mode or
means, make it an Executive duty to rc-cnslavc
such poisons, another, and not I, must he their
instrument to perform it. In staling a single
condition of pence, I mean simply to say that
the war will cense on the part of the Government
whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those
who began it.
He refers to the figures of the recent State elec
tions, as “the most reliable indication of public \
purpose in this country,” and also stales that
“men and material resources to prosecute thu war
arc now more abundant than ever.”
He refers to the general pardon and amnesty
which were offered a year ago to the insurgents,
and says "the lime may come—probably will
come—when public duly shall demand that it |
lie closed.”

niatning unchanged, nnd the excitement to be
nearly subsided. Musketry firing is sometimes
kept Up in front of the Fourth Corps. The Union

Inl Grant's’erniy is confirmed by despatch)s rc- j
! ceived from Hie correspondent of (he Associated J
1 Press, und b y the arrival of a steamer at Wash- ’
, ington on Saturday from City Point. Theexpe

direction of Stony Creek Station, on the Weldon
Railroad, nnd during Wednesday afternoon were
known to have crossed Nottawey river, on the '
Jerusalem road, over a pontoon bridge, which
they afterwards look up. So far they met with i
nei opposition of consequence.
A cavalry forte, sent out last Thursday
afternoon to reconnoitre, drove the pickets of the !
enemy a distance of (wo miles to their entrench
ments at Halchei’s Run, on the Vaughn road, i
and after some skirmishing returned. They re
ported that firing was heard in the direction of
Htony Creek Station, which was considered as
an Indication that fighting was going on between
Gen. Warren and Hie enemy.
A telegram from Cairo reports Hurt ahout4,ono
of the enemy captured the United States trans
port, Titos. E. Tull, at Cumberland city, on the
Cumberland river, and used her for crossing the I
river on their march into Kentucky. They then j
destroyed the vessel.
The Augusta Chronicle regards the fact of !
Gen. Sherman’s aimy having reached Milton, as
conclusive evidence that his object is Savannah,
and speaks of the routes he might take to reach )
it.
Information was received by the Navy Depart
ment on Monday of the destruction of the block
ado runner Ella, whilst attempting to van into
Wilmington, N. C., loaded with arms and am- ,
munition. i

cd to have been received at City Point, stating
that on the 7th inst., Gen. Sherman’s nrmv was

Admiral Bablgren having destroyed the Poco
taligo bridge nnd < til Hie Charleston and Savan
nah railroad, is not confirmed by the arrival of
the U. S. Steamer Arapo, which left Port Royal
one day later, (on the Bth.)
Nothing of importance was reported to the
War Department yesterday from the Army of the :
Potomac or Shenandoah. The severity of the
weather has prevented any important movement
on cither side at Nashville, Tenn.
Information lias been received at the Navy Do- '
parttutnt that the Unitid Slates gunboat Otsego,
Commander Arnold, was sunk a few- dnvs since
bya rebel torpedo in Roanoke river, six miles

and H was thought the boat will he raised. ’ 1
An official bulletin w’us issued by- Secretary i
Stanton Tuesday-. He announces that Rich
mond papers of Monday morning have been re
ceived by General Grant at Cly Point. The '
Richmond Diepu'ch states that General Sherman !
is near Savannah, probably not five mile* distant,
hut that he laid not yet made an attack, and it |
was doubtful whether ho would do so or move
towards the coast southeast of the city. It also i
I stales that a later despatch from below Charles- 1
[ ton reports General Sherman's army tote drawn
; up in line of halts at a point lluy would not say j
confronted by a strong rebel force. Another pa- 1
I per stales there has teen no direct ronnnimiciilion j

Georgia Railroad, 15 miles west of Savannah.
A letter from Foil Morgan, in Mobile Bay, j
. slates the new rebel rum at Selma, Ala., is being i
j armored.
It is icportcd that seven rams*and gunboats
! arc inside the obstructions of the harbor, besides
four blockade-runners, with cargoes of cotton,
j awaiting an opportunity to escape from Mobile, i
The Lady's Friend.—The January number j
of the I w!y's Friend is already on our table, and
fully bears out the high reputation of ibis new j
monthly, which is now entering upon the second ;
year of its,existence. The leading steel engrav
ing, “Hush ! it is Asleep,” is a beautiful picture,
and will doubtless go right to the hearts of the
laities. The Fashion Plate —a double one, as |
usual—is very handsome indeed, admirably en
graved on steel, and richly colored. Then there j
is a colored design of a Work Table Companion, |
a very useful lady, as she seems, in red and yel
; low and blue; and numerous other engravings
; of the Fashions, Work Table Department, &c.—
The Music of this number is a piece entitled “I

IBs slock comprises almost every Tiling kept in a

Larc.e Radish.—We have received recently a
huge radish weighing 2 pounds, and which, it is
stated, was the smallest pulled from the bed this

The Effect of the New Reformation.
When reformers propose to introduce I
new manners and new customs it becomes !
the world to examine them critically.—• |
Tim experience of a few years has not im
pressed the thinking cla.-ses witii any par
ticular love for the reform stylo of conver
sation and discussion. A matt imbued
with the new radical principles te ems to
take it fop granted that it is his first and
foremost duty to express his own opinions
! and to condemn forcibly the expression of
opposite opinions, lie is lot satisfied
with the ordinary expression of dissent, !
hut he regards it as perfectly proper, hi
de, d a duty, to say to a person witii whom
; ho is conversing, and who does not agree
with him, “You uro a traitor,” or “You
I are a rebel.” If bo should say lon man,
"You are a liar,” ho would expect to Ist
| somewhat severely dealt with, as the Way
jof tho world is, but 1! he says, "You re a
traitor,” nod gets knocked down for his
impertinence, lie is astonished at thu re- [
1 suit, and complains to the nearest United
| Siales authorities This seems to be an
accepted rule of tho radical code ol anoietv,
j but there is nothing wrong in calling a
! mao a traitor Naturally this rule affects
all the relations of radicals to in n who
differ with them. We are afraid that
1111 nee. pled rule of radical so dal life I t.at
it dot* no harm if falsehood and slander to
! any extent should be circulated about a
[man in the opposition. At all events a
iceklef-tiess about personal character and
reputation is displayed which makes it im
possible to depend on a radical s estimate
of or statement relating to another man's
character. The political question deter- •
mines every I
I on the negro question lie is praised itiordi
: nately ; it he is wrong on that, there is no
limey, not even the mercy of tiuth, for
! him.
There was an amusing illustration of
the radical spirit, which was laughed at
for u month or two in conservative circles.
When Mr. Hawthorne published his last
book, he dedicated it to Franklin Fierce,
! a gentleman of the highest character and
accomplishments, the old and devoted per
sonal friend of the author, and one who
bus filled the highest office on the globe,
1 that of the t-lec'ed President of the Ameii
ean people. Wh.it indignation it excited
among the whole pack of radical oew<-
p pers tied and reviews, and in radical pri
vate circles! They denounced it every
where. The outcry was funny iu tho ex
treme, They could not paid. 11 such an
I atrocious eriu ein Hawthorne. He must
have laughed quietly at the tidicuh.us . x
hibitioii of their anger because be had
dedicated his book to his eminent fellow
countryman and friend. All the fuss was
! because Mr. Pierce is not a radical. The
infer.nee is, that, according to the radical
rules for t! c future regulation of society
! and literature, no author must dedicate
[ a book to a cen-ervativc.
Illustrations of radical impertinence and
I egotism might he multiplied to the extent
of columns. The abusive, billingsgate
style if editorial, public, speaking, and
general lil.raltne, in Hod deed to a consider
bio extent into the pulpit, is so well
known that it dots not need illustration
The question is wheihtr it is un improve
ment uu what we have hud in former days.
This question is one 1 f importance. It is
not to be denied that the new style intro
duced into our ci unity is producing a
marked tfleet on young and old. it is
embittering the whole social life of the
[people. The vast amount of intelligence,
education, ami refinement which eliarac-
I Icri/.is the conservative classes of society,
' naturally resists and bars out the innova-
I (ions which are proposed. Social relations
between people of tho two parties become
more and more difficult from* month to
: month. Intelligent people on both sides
I will recede from each other, the one class
accepting the new sty 10, the oilier refus
ing it, and thus the greatest social chain
lever created in America will bo opened.
Once opened, it will be hard to fill it.

The Duty of Democrats in Congress.
In speaking of tho positions of parlies
jin the present Congress, the New York
j World thus sensibly discourses upon 1 lie
j line of duly which should be pursued by [
the Democratic members;
Thu Democratic members, this session
will, of course, bo true to tbeir principles;
I bu‘ lie-y will do mulling to embarrass the
[despatch of business. As mi lead mg feu- |
Hire of the Republican policy can for some j
years be . hauled, they are not called upon ■
to struggle against itnpo.-sibilities; hut as [
| the details ot unsound measures may ren-
I.h r them still moro objectionable, they |
; will not hesitate to make pertinent suggor- i
tiutis Dot while it would bo futile and [
unseasonable to consume time in strenuous
; opposition to foregone policy, the Don'm- j
cralic members will steadily decline to vote j
lor any measures which,on principle, they i
d sapprnvo. They will y ield to no sueh ;
shallow seduction us that they 11111-t cole [
this nr that wav to aid in carrying on the
government. This would boa false and I
1 foolish magnanimity. Our aid the parly
in power do not need, for they uro quite j
independent of it. If wo were right iu the
presidential caitva-s, time and events will j
vindicate our sagacity; and We owe It. to j
Iho country not to impair our moral pow
er by a weak complaisance which can uf
. f’ept no public measure, and would bo fa
tal to our fu'ure influence, when experi

A Foreign Echo.
A French gentleman of ripe culture, |
who just before tho outbreak of our civil j
war, spent several years in the United !
I St..tcs for the purpose of minutely obser- h
; vitig and studying our institutions, in a
recent pi irate letter to one of thu editors ,
[ of this jou nul, holds the following lan
guage, which, though not intended for!
publication, we translate for our read, rs,
as containing trie thought of an enlighten
ed -foreigner, qualified as well by his I
familiar knowledge of our country as by !
j his point cf view to look no less iiitelii
gently than dispassionately ou our strug
-1 gle. He says:
"I am neutral between tho parties to
your strife, and I think that no good can
possibly result from it except by means
of a mutual leconciiiutioii. If it is the cau
tion which has the last word, you may have
conquered subjects, but not political con
1 federates, still less friends The Union'
in such a case would no longer be any- I
tldng but a lie, for it cannot be supposed, !
it should bo freely assented to. And, on '
another side of the question, the blacks, j
transformed into freedtuen, present a pr b
lent which it is not easy to solve. What
i shall you do with four millions of persons,
j but. yesterday slavish and degraded, and ;
to-day the .quals of their former masters? ,
The pn judic. sof race, still so deep root-i
ed at the North, and much more tenacious
at the .$• uth, tire not to be cxtiipa’ed in |
a day Volt have proposed to yourselves [
terrible problems before knowing how you [
can solve them. Your future, therefoie, is
big with difficulties, which, snouei or later
must bring on eri-es and revolutions, ti e .
1 natuio of which no mau can now at all j
foresee. May God save your country from
still more deplorable calamities. You are
new paying very dearly for the long years
of prosperity through which you have run
without bur .cns. I offer fervent prayers j
that you and yours may not have too!
much to suffer fr uit this unhappy civil war. !
and that you may soon see the end of it i
1 can truly add that this is the wish oi”
the whole of Europe; fir, if you have im
personal recollections of revolutions, you
must admit that you arc now oulstiipptng
all other nations in this bloody patli on
[which you have .titered, and over which !
the whole world mourns” — Nat. Inlclli

The Sanitary ComauEsion.
The National Inh l/ijeneer made allusion
to the appeal of the Sanitary Commission
for increase of funds, and asked for a state
ment ul the gross amount of salaries divi
ded among the employees of that assoeia
tb n. Iu paitiul reply, there was a linan- [
ciul report of tho western department of j
Ural organization, covering n report from [
September 1, 1801, to January 1, 1804.
Fiom 1 his report itappeored that, in that j
branch, the sum ot $321,065.42 had
[been expended. Of this $03,502.00
w..s applied to tho purchase of supplies, [
and tho remainder expended in distri-!
button of those supplies. Under tho i
head .d “expenses,’’ 827,447 72 was ab
sorbed ; under the head of “publication,’’
Ac., 85,283 88 was absorbed, and the;
amount of $24,000 15 was absorbed iu the |
work of “general inspection, ’’ being an ag
gregate ol 06,800 75 for these three items
abuie. In tuc “Directory,” the sum of |
813,071 53 was spent for “compensation’’i
of officers, or agents undin the “Relief,
Department” the .-uni of §13,224.50 was
similarly appropriated.
In a word, it east §227.472.86 to place
§O3 502 50 north of supplies at the dis
position of the. soldiers, notwithstanding
tl.e huge amount of transportation which
was performed by thu government, and so
not pud for by the commission. Is this
statement to bo considered as evidence
tending to show the economy of manage
ment by this associaii in ?
The Intelligencer makes the following
statement:
“We learn that the E .st rn Depart
ment of the Commission, which has its
headquarters in this city f Washington,)
and 111 which the appropriations have been
made ou a greatly more extensive scale,
h.s never published any financial report
since the dale ot its organization down
to tho present time.” —Westchester ./<J

Deserters in Canada —The Waah

‘■There are at this time according to
i trustworthy information in the possession
j of the authorities lu re, some five thousand
, deserters from our army in Canada, wluth
ler they have lied to escape the vigilance
"f the local provost marshals, whose ar
rests of them are daily increasing in num
ber. Recently there was it large meeting
of them near the Canada end of the Sus
pension Bridge, resulting iu the forward
ing of a petition, asking that they might
be receive i back into their respective regi
ments without being subject to the milita
ry punishment usually accord 'd in eases
I like theirs. Their condition is as pitiable
!as deplorable. Half of them are barefoot
j ed and not half clothed at this inclement
I season, and their only moans or prospect
■of keeping body and soul together, is in
j working on the Great Western Railroad
I and other Canadian public works, at pay
which sea fitly feeds tliem, without suffi
ciently clothing them. They are intense
j iy unpopular with the people of Canada,
who take every means in their power to
i crowd them back him the United Slates.
On the whole, their condition there is len
i fold worse than that of the tree negroes.”
