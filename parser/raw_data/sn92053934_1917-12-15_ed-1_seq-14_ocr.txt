series gats receipts Is the only ques
tion pertaining to the war policies of
the American ana rational leagues
which remains to be settled following
vesterday's Joint conference between
the representatives of the two organ
izations. The sixteen club owners ap
pointed President Ban Johnson of the
American league and Garry Herr

ceipts from the world series.
, Contrary to expectations, the joint
session of the owners brought about
no material changes in the conduct of
the games. It was decided to start

present and that it will be time
enough to net when the war makes
changes necessary.

Pete Schneider, Cincinnati Red twirler, worked a new one last season
when he had his own trainer to handle him between inninps and put him in
shape for the next trip to the mound. Schneider's littl$ pal, Sammy
Sandow, Cincinnati bantamweight, swung the towel and handled him gen
erally as a fighter is handled, putting him in fresh trim for his next
inning. And at Sandow's fights with fcrtle and Wolfe and other leading
bantams, many of them staged at the Kcdland field ball park, Schneider
was in Sandow's corner rubbing him down and telling him how to score
on his opponent. Each declares that the other's hclo was invaluable.

Cancellation of the baseball sched
ule for the year and the promotion of
intra-mural athletics were tUe chief
events in the "Little Nineteen" con
ference held at Peoria yesterday, ac
cording to Coach R. M. Conrad of
Augustana, who returned this morn
ing from the meeting. m
All schools are urged to inform four
! baseball teams within the institution,
j preferably on some class basis which
will arouse interest. These teams are
then to contest for the championship
ot the school. An ail-school team will
j then be picked to represent the insti
tution In the baseball tournament to
be held in Peoria May 17 and May
. r. . A - . . J 1 1
t io. A tennis louruanieui suu a sun
meet will be held in connection witli
the baseball tourney as will also the
annual track and field games.
Intra-mural athletics found its chief
exponent at the conference in Dr. W.
J. Manllaw of the Chicago University
high school, who addressed the con
ference on the subject. He pointed out
that not only would the measure cut
the expenses of a somewhat uninter
esting season but would also bring
athletics to the average student by
widening the field for those who de
sired to make a team.
Basketball fans will be greatly re
lieved to know that the conference in
spite of some fears to the contrary,
were practically unanimous in declar
ing for the annual basketball tourna
ment. Dates for the tournament will
be Feb. 28, March 1 and 2, and the
meet was awarded to Bradley at Peo
ria. ' ,
The tournament will be carried out
as heretofore, the same "A" and "B"
divisions obtaining. Coach R. M. Con
rad of Augustana as made a mem
ber of the committee to determine the
composition of each division, the oth
er members being F. C. Brown, presi
dent of the "Little Nineteen," Coach
Fred Muhl of Wesleyan, Coach Charles
Dentz of Charleston normal, and
Coach Harmon of Illinois college.
Colleges Affected By Mar.
According to Conrad, all of the col
leges in the "Little Nineteen" have
been quite distinctly affected by the
war, so Augustana will not be the only
cripple in the ranks. Eureka and
Wesleyan seem to be. the least affect
ed, F.ureka having practically the
same squad as last year and Wesley
an losing but very few.
Football championship pt the past
season was awarded by the conference
to Lombard college.
Officers elected were
President F. C. Brown of Bradlev.
Vice President X. G. Wann of Mil-
liiun.
Secretary IJ. II. Russell of Illinois
Normal.
Treasurer F. L. Muhl of Illinois
Wesleyan.
It was decided to hold the next con
ference meeting in Peoria March 1.

Chicago, Oct. 13. Another startling
baseball deal was consummated yes
terday while the two major leagues
were in joint session here at the Con
gress. President Frazea of the Boston
Red Sox announced he had paid $fcft,
000 for three stars of the Philadelphia
Athletics, besides tossing in three
players to boot. The stars obtained
were Joe Bush, pitcher; Amos Strunk,
outfielder, and Wallie Schang, catch
er. The Boston players tossed in were
Pitcher Vean Gregg, Catcher ("net
Thomas and Outfielder Merlin Kopp.
Almost at the same tinis a trade
was executed between the Washingtoa

many big deals made by major league
magnates as have taken placa in the
last few days, the Boston Red Sox
swap being almost as big as the coupe
executed by President Weeghman of
the Cubs in buying Grover Aiexandar
and Bill Killifer.
The Cubs' deal gladdened the hearts
of Chicago fans, but the trade turned
out by the Red Sox made a lot of
White Sox rooters sit up and take no
tice. Instead of the Red Sox being .
declared out of the next race because
of the loss of some stars for army
service, it now looks that with the ad
dition of Connie Mack's trio, the Red
Sox will be right back righting Comis
key's men for the flag again, and
should the Sox lose Eddie Coiiins
through war service, Boston is likely
to be favorite.

The Red Sox ileal came as a big
surprise, for while it wras understood

A plan to buy residence property
in the block at the northeast corner of
which stands the Lincoln homestead
and to make ot the land a city park
has been presented to the Springfield
park board by the state board of art
advisers and the board of parks and
buildinngs advisers. The scheme for
beautification of the capital city in
preparation for the Illirois centennial
ceieurauon, also contemplates the
boulevarding of Capitol avenue from

posed new park east of Eighth street
and north of Jackson street.
George Pasfield, Jr., a member of

board. i
Co-oneration of the Springfield Com-!

thorized to appoint a committee to
work with the city park board and the
proper state authorities. The plans
were presented to the commerce body
at a recent meeting by Hugh S. Ma
gill. Jr., director of the centennial
celebration.
The block of ground on which the
Lincoln homestead stands is covered
thickly with residences, and the cost
of buying the property, it is said,
would be great.
Attention has been called freauentlv
to the fact that the homestead would
be in danger of destruction by fire if
frame structures adjoining should be
at the proper time and that you should
make provision to cater to it."

good years ahead of him, while Strunk
is rated as one of the fastest outfield

not only is a great catcher, hut a
strong hitter and a man capable of
playing the outfield or third base.
