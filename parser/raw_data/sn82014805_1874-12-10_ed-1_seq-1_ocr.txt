(Specially Reported for the Gazette.)
N«w Castle, Dec. 1874.
Court re-assembled this morning at 10
A. M., Judges Wootten and Houston on
the bench.
The first case called up for trial was
Quinby k Kent va. Wilmington k West
ern Bail Road Company—assumpsit on a
book account. The plaintiffs were rep
resented by C. B. Lore, Eeq., and the de
fendants by S. M. Harrington, E*q. Tho
facts are these :
A lot of lumber was purchased at dif
ferent times from the plaintiffs by An
drew Crumlish, a contractor in the de
fendants' employ, the plaintiffs alleging
that Crumlish bought as agent of the B.
& Co., ansi for its use, whslo defendant
insisted that Mr. Crumlish was nerer
fixen authority to make such purchose
5y the Company, but on the contrary he
made such purchase on hiB own account.
The sum in dispute was $354.10, with ac
cruing interest. Tho Jury found a ver
dict for the defendant.
The next case was Silas Johnson vs.
Presley Spruanoe, Garnishee of the Green
Branch Ditch Company—attachment y»
fa—Fleas nullabona-, payment; statutes of
limitation: that all sums of money taxed
ea by the Green Branch Ditch
Company on tho defendant were extin
guished by lapse of time before the at
tachment was laid, and that the treasur
er of the Green Branch Ditch Company
being similarized by law to collectors of
county rates who are prohibited from
collecting any tax after two years from
the date of his warrant, the defendant
paid all the taxes assessed to him or for
which he was at any time liable uuder
tho act of incorporation were paid to the
Treasurer more than two years beforo the
laying of the attachment.
This case is one cf a series of four at
tachments laid against various persons
who held in their hands unpaid taxes to
the Green Branch Ditch Company, a
judgment against tho Company having
been previously obtained.
The amount involved in this case $21.23.

The Message on Southern Af
fairs.
The moat aif niflcant part of the Pres
ident' a Mbs . 1 age. by all odd., is the expo
sition of his views towards the South.
Touching other matters he merely advi
ses, and Congress may do as it thinks
best in taking or rejecting his counsel ;
but when he speaks of the Southern
States, he announces what he means to
do, under the authority of the law, as he
construes it. The President dedicates
the opening of his Message to his opin
ions on financial troubles and their rem
edies—the repeal of the Legal Tender
act and free banking—and lie declares
that he gave the subject that conspicu
ous place on account of its importance.
But whatever his opinions on finance
y be intrinsically worth, they have
binding power on Congress, and real
ly carry but little weight. They have
no more effect than those of any other
man who has superficially studied fi
cial questions through other men's spec
tacles, unless it is understood that he
Id voto every other plan of relief
that might be adopted, but his own. The
President as good as declares that he is
not obstinate or tenacious on that point,
for he Bays—"It is the duty of Congress
to devis.' the method of correcting the
evils which are acknowledged to exist,
and not min.." The Secretary of the
Treasury uses language to the same ef
fect, and adds—"The Secretary can do
neither more nor less than oUy and exe
cute euch laws ae Congoeee may enuct."
These we tako to be distinct intimations
that the Administration will not quorrol
with the Congressional majority what
ever they do about the finances. In
truth, all the financial recommendations
of the President and the Secretary were
intendod tor popular effect, and not as
outgivings of an Administration policy
to bo executed with rigor and firmness.
Next to this branch of the
Message, alarmists assign the greatest
importance to its references to Spain.
Some tliiuk that they see here a resolute
determination to interfere in Cuban af
fairs unless Spain settles her indemnity
dues with us. The President's language
gives a color to that theory. But it is
only a trat um fulmen, and Spain will so
understand it. President Orant has, in
several annual messages, talked threat
eningly to Spain. Ho lias for years been
holding out vague hopes to the Cuban
revolutionists that this Government
would soon come to their rescue by rec
ognition and more direct means. .Spain
knows too well what this really signifies
to take any notice of it. She still car
ries on her relentless war against her
colonists, postpones emancipation, and
pays no attention to the claims of the
United States ; and we have no idea that
tho President's latest utterances will
change her disposition one whit. Wo
are too much accustomed to those bold
lectures to Spain to attach any serious
meaning to them. But when we come
to the third great topic in order, the
President's views of Southern affairs,
we feel that hero at last wo are getting
on more solid ground. For the President
f his executive duties to
ward tho South, and he lias been in the
habit of acting up to them without re
gard for the consequences, and he now
says, in effect (and wo believe him,) that
he will continue to exercise his hursh
and partisan policy as before.
No candid man denies that It Is the
President's duty to enforce the laws of
Congress and tho provisions of the
Constitution "with rigor" (to use his
own werds), when circumstances ren
der that necessary. We blai.io the
President, not for enforcing tho laws,
but for using tho whole power of his
office, and tho army with it, to bolster
up a party at the South. Ho has never
appeared on tho scene as a judge to
arbitrate between two contending fac
tions, but always as an advocate ready
to back up his arguments for bis side
with bayonets. What he says of the
South in his present Message is as one
sided as his observations on that sub
ject in previous Messages have invari
ably been. Ho repeats the old stories
about "White Leagues," masked nnd
armed, and their acts of violence and
intimidation to deprive citizens of tho
freedom of the ballot,
a word to say of the formidable and
murderous combinations of blacks who
roamed over parts of the Booth, mur
dering, outraging and robbing, nnd
enusing a reign of tern,, which the
whites could only suppress by counter
movements. There are two very dis
tinct sides to this question. If there
were White Leagues, there were also
B'ack Leagues, whoso crimes made
leagues of another color necessary in
tho opinion of some of the best citizens
of the South. As to the coercion of
colored laborers in tho matter of vot
lng to suit their employers "under
threatsof discharge if they acted other
wise," such caseB, If they occurred,
can be matched by the tyrannical and
high handed course of Radical blacks
toward men of their race who voted
the Conservative ticket. Tho murder
and beating of colored voters who
acted with the Conservatives were fre
quent incidents at the South prior to
the election. But of theso facts the
President affects to know nothing.
He has only eyes and ears for the out
rages reported against the Conserva
tives ; and it is against those men that
ho employs all the engines of his au
thority, nnd he promises that lie will
keep on doing so. This part of the
message affords melancholy evidence
of the extent to which prejudice and
obstinacy will blind a man. What
ever disturbances occurred at the South
just beforo the election—and there
was nothing serious of that nature—
the Southern people, white and black,
are most amicably ^disposed to acqui
esce iu tho result of the cam
With the exception of a local and pas
sing difficulty, originated by negroes
Vicksburg, the whole South is in
condition of profound peace. So far
as all human auguries go, this blessed
state of things promises to continue.
And yet President tirant seizes this
very occasion, which ought to be a
theme of national thanksgiving, to rei
terate his wholo distrust of the South
ern whites, and his purpose to enforce
the laws with "rigor," that is. always
against the Conservatives. PcWstence

From New York World , of Wednesday.
Reception of the Message.
It seems to be t he g eneral verdict, both
this city and in Washington, that the
President's Message is a failure, if judged
by any influence it is likely to exert
the legislation of this session. This
suits partly from the impracticability of
the most important of his recommenda
tions and partly from the tone he as
sumes toward the body to whibh the
Message is addressed. The evident at
tempt to cast upon Congress the respon
sibility for the shortcomings and failures
which have brought the administration
into discredit is not well received by the
members of that body, who came togeth
er in no very amiblo temper toward the
President. He reminds Congress that
he invited their action on the Louisiana
case last winter and that they treated
his suggestions with total neglect. Had
they acted and. solved the difficulty they
would have relieved him from an odious
responsibility and might have ended the
Louisiana troubles instead of leaving
them to plague tho President and dam
age the party. But, if Congress were
disposed to retort, it might tell the Pres
ident that he got himself into the Louis
iana scrape by his own action, without
their advice, and that after he had crea
ted a spurious government in that State
on lus ewn responsibility he had no right
to feel personally aggrieved that he was
left to bear the consequences. If he had
not chosen to intermeddle tho McEnery
government would have been peaceably
installed, and the State have escaped the
turmoil and tho republican party the
scandal of tliOBO two years.
Tho President seems'also to charge
Congress with the failure of civil service
reform, and in this part of tho Message
he gives away to a sharpness of ton«
which does not quite befit eo grave aidoc
ument. He threatens to abandon the
experiment unless Congress comes at last
to his relief. Here, again. Congress
might retort upon him that he was a vol
unteer in this business; that, in adopting
the civil service Truies, he acted on his
own mere discret ion; that if a law of Con
gress was necessary to make the rules ef
fective he should haue foreseen that ne
cessity, have recommended suitable leg
islation at the outset and not have beguu
the experiment until the conditions ex
isted for making it successful. The Pres
ident is put by his rather ill-tempered
threat in this dilemma: If a law of Con
gress was necessary he should not have
started without it; if Executive discre
tion was sufficient there is no excuse for
impetuously abandoning tho reform.—
Had it succeeded ho would have taken
the sole credit, and since it has failed
Congress may reasonably decline any
part of the b.amo. Be this as it may, the
temper he exhibits toward Congress is
not calculated to secure its indulgent
judgement of tho Message.
It must bo further borne in mind that
the Congress to which this Messago is ad -
dressed is tho same Congress whose ma
jority ho confronted and humiliated by
his veto last spring. They silently swal
lowed their indignation and chagrin lest
the party should be weakened by an open
breach with the President.

nounced. Ho has been rated high, with
an accredited capital of $200,000. His
liabilities are about $150,000. A criminal
prosecution for obtaining money under
false pretences is talked of. He owes
the First National Bank $15,000, and va
rious other parties largo sums.
Tho Grangers have met with a heuvy
loss in tho flight of Henry D. Thomas,
who has been, for some years, manager
and treasurer of the Prairie Farmer
Publishing Company, and held other
r j8itions of trust, particularly in tho
Granger interost. Ho is said to have
squandered a largo fortune of his own,
and it is alleged that he has only fled
after making improper use of money
committed to his care to the amount of
$50,000. It is understood that tho Gran
gers all over the West ore sufferers by
his defalcation. Insanity is considered
a possible clue to his disappearance.
The Safe Burglary.
Attomev-General Williams to-day sent
a communication to the Judge of tho
Criminal Court, informing him that the
Government has abandoned the safe
burglary cases under tho late indictment,
which has boen pronounced a nullity by
the Supreme Court of the Distriot of Col
umbia, and the Attorney-General so re
garding it, owing to the illegal constitu
tion of the Grand Jury.
The Judgo, after directing the com
munication to be placed on fiie, ordered
a nolle prosequi to b« entered in these
cases, and also discharged the bail of the
defendants Harrington, Whitely, and
Williams. No further action will be ta
ken at present. ...
Tho abandonment of tho cases is with
reference only to the nullity of the late
indictment, and doos not affect the cause
of action, as the same partios can be again
indicted for the alleged offense.
Bi.undekino Law Makers —Owing
to the defects in the revised laws of
Now Jersey, it is claimed that they
cannot go into effect on tho first of
January, 1875, as prescribed thcroln.
It scents that the work of the commit
tee of revision was duly submitted tw
tho Legislature, but when the time
came to put tho lawa in the hands of
tho State printer it was ascertained
that certain of them had, by oversight
of the Senate, failed to pass that body
and until the defect is supplied tho
State will be without law on some
subjects after January, 1875, the date
on which the revised laws were to go
into effect. An extra session to reme
dy tho defect is tulked of, but to add
to the perplexity of tho situation the
president of the Senate and sneaker of
tho Houso have just started with au
excursion for tho Bermudas. 1 hey
are expected back, however, in about
ten days, and tho Governor can give
the Legislature u chance to avert the
çonsequenccg of its stupidity.
