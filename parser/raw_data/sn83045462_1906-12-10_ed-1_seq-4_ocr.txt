An Eighteenth-Century Constitution.
The London Outlook has this to say of
the message:
"President Roosevelt, for whom ther^" is
a right and wrong in everything, and who
can hardly conceive of a proposition having
more than two sides to it, is a preacher
by necessity. But if on its philosophical
side his message has an almost automatic
familiarity of manner. Its matter, the program
it outlined, and the suggestions embodied
In It were for the most part as novel
as they were striking.
"We refer less to any specific proposal,
though his advocacy of an inheritance tax
marks the beginning of a revolution in the
social finance of the United States, than
to the general tone of the message. Never

pieed the inadequacies of an eighteenthcentury
constitution in the face of twentletli-century
conditions, and his insistence
1* ail the more significant for being a measure
oblique and unconscious?an inference
from his main thesis rather than the thesis
Itself touched upon and recognised, but
now here elaborated."
We should not be too much impressed by
the Dhrase. "an eighteenth-century const!
tutlon." To be sure, it gives the impression
of something archaic which should
give place to something up to date?as if
one might ask, why hold on to a chart
when the conditions which suggested it
have long since all disappeared, and the
remedy has wrought all that was intended?
New tyrannies are to be dealt with, growing
out of the liberties then secured, and
why not take them up and deal with them
at the beginning of the twentieth century
as courageously as the fathers did those of
ttie closing quarter of the eighteenth century?
That might be done without any Impairment
of the spirit of the original performance.
The men who wrought for the state,
both in England and America, in the latter
lialf of the eighteenth century were of a
large Intellectual mold, and the foremost
nf them exchanged applause across the At
luntlc. Chatham and Burke admired their
American kinsmen greatly, and even the
men who opposed the work of the revolutionary
fathers praised the capacity they
exhibited for government and debate.
Washington, and Hamilton, and Adams,
and Jefferson, and Franklin, and men of
that stamp, were rated at a high figure in
England.
The proof of the pudding Is in the eating.
Look how long and how well the spirit and
the performances of those men have lasted.
In England the best spirit, the imperial
(Spirit, Is Chatham's, descended to this day.
He was the biggest of all the Big Englanders,
and his country was respected all

Its own designers. It Is still the wonder of
men, and still performs functions encouraging
to men of all climes and conditions.
The spirit of our "eighteenth-century
Constitution" is for all centuries. It could
not be changed except for the worse. But
this is not to say that abuses have not
grown tip under It, and at tnis day neea correction.
As a matter of fact they testify
to Its strength, as the present inequalities
of the Dingley law testify to the original
Strength and wisdom of that enactment.

not abolition, is the need of the times?in

has ever known.
Bonl.
Bonl de Oastellane Is true to his trade.
He falters not In his career as a farceur.
He plays his part consistently and. It
must be acknowledged, according to his
lights he plays It well. Here is his latest
utterance, which deserves consideration
even from a perhaps ruffled American audience:
"Nothing can Induce me to talk about
my marital troubles. It is immaterial to
ma what the American press says about
me. The opinion of the American public
has as much effect on me as the bite of a
mosquito would have upon h boxing glove.
Americans seem to forget that I did not
marry an American family, but vice versa.
My matrimonial entanglement has not lost
me a single friend nor made me any enemies."
Nothing could be in better taste or more
to the point. It is quite true that Bonl did
not marry an American family. He annexed
it. And nothing Is more true than
that Boni's hide Is too thick to be punctured.
as thick as a boxing glove. Nothing
hort of an eight-Inch shell would make an
Impression upon him. It is a waste of ammunition
to fire at him longer. Let htm go.
An arctic explorer Intends to use an automobile
with skate runners. The experl
ment will be doubly Interesting, as a polar
expedition and a demonstration of the
automobile's reliability away from all possibility
of communication with the garage.
Past events should hold sufficient warning
for the man who la tempted to hang the
money he haa saved to pay off the mortgage
In proximity to the Christmas tree
candles.
Public Playgrounds.
No more important item appears In the
Commissioners' annual report than tha
recommendation that $25,000 be appropriated
till* year for the purchase and equipment
of public playgrounds in this city. As
they say. the playgrounds for the children
re no longer experimental, but have been
demonstrated to be not only necessary but
practicable adjuncts to the municipal government.
The public scho is train the
minds of the children, bu: meanwhile, save
for the small beginnings in this District,
the municipality makes no provision for
training the bodies and strengthening Hu m
and so fitting the children to carry the
burden of the school work. Advanced
thinkers in sociology believe that it la Juat
s Important for the future welfare of the
community to direct the child's physical
energies?at least to give it a chance to play
'wholesomely under safe conditions?as to
cultivate its mind.
What the District has done thus far in
this direction haa been chiefly through the
assistance of Individuals. They have demAnatrAfoH
th.? and hflvo It trt an
extent which reflects great credit upon
them. This burden should no longer be
carried by them. It should be placed
squarely upon all the citizens, and the management
of the playgrounds should be
Identified with the municipal administration.
The present method of procedure, utilising
Spaces either borrowed or held for nominal
rentals subject to instant ouster, is wholly
unsatisfactory and in nowise does it do the
District credit It It i makeshift irWeh
cannot too soon be supplanted by an extensive
system of playgrounds owned by
the District. Heretofore in the location
of these playgrounds advantage has had
to be taken of local opportunities, with the
result that the convenience of the children
has frequently been ignored and the attendant
conditions have been somewhat obiivtlnnahle
T< thA fTommlssinnerg are Kiven
the funds they now request for the purchase
of land they oan undoubtedly find spaces
that are better suited to this purpose. They
will become permanent and the equipment
will not be in danger of destruction and
waste. In a few years, with comparatively
small annual expenditures, these little
recreation parks should be attractive and
efficient and a credit to the capita! city.
The reasons urged for the maintenance
of public playgrounds should instantly ap
peal to Congress. By means of these spaces,
fitted with outdoor gymnasium apparatus,
shelters, sand piles and facllltlee for games,
the children are kept off the streets and
engaged in wholesome pastimes. Especially
If each little recreation park Is supervised
by a capable person the youngsters learn
ways and means of entertainment which
are infinitely better than the boisterous
plays of the pave. The boys are kept
from demoralizing comnanionshiDS. It is a
melancholy fact that many city children
have to be taught to play. This is one of
the essential objects of the playgrounds
movement, and It should be deeply Impressed
upon the congressional mind that
heretofore, save to the slight extent now In
evidence and furnishing an eloquent argument
for more work in the same line, this
vitally important feature or community-life
has been neglected here.
Another Bear-End Collision.
The shocking coincidence of another rearend
collision on the Southern railway system,
a few miles from the scene of the
death of President Spencer, and with the
same engineer In charge of the rear locomotive,
adds to the force of the public demand
for an open Investigation by the
company into the cause. These two accidents
are practically alike in all their essential
features?a stalled train, a mistake
oy an operator, a rear train aamiuea to
an occupied block, a brakeman^negllgent
of his duty, and a collision. It is stated
that the operator of the forward signal
station, Danville, gave the wrong word to
the operator at the next station to the
north, reporting the freight train as having
passe a Danville a considerable time before
It actually appeared at that station. Just
how such a mistake could be made Is a
mystery. But whatever the circumstances
of the block signal service oil this occa
OLUU, ?v la iiuailivcij HIIUWU LJIUI uie OrttKOman
of the forward train did not obey orders.
He did not go back even a short distance.
He did not leave his train. He
was killed in one of the cars.
Here are two Instances of the lamentable
weakness of the double check system in
vogue in the Southern and other railroads.
Absolutely no reliance is to be placed In
the brakeman. Trains are either run so
close together that the brakeman cannot
get back in time, or the brakeman fails
to go back a sufficient distance, or at all.
It becomes a serious question whether the
law should not take a hand In this matter
and stipulate the observance of the rule
requiring brakemen to signal the rea? train
at a safe distance, under a severe penalty
for non-observance.
It is the public belief that the railroad
managers are aware of the deficiencies of
the operating crews In this respect, and do
nothing effective to correct the evil. The
matter should be thoroughly ventilated.
The United States government should point
the yr&y to reform by the enactment of a
statute- prescribing certain aafety requirements
in the operation of all Interstate
traffic, thus assuming the jurisdiction which
the Constitution grants and at least es
tablisliing a federal standard which may
be adopted by the states as well. The
railroad danger is growing more serious and
It must be lessened If we are not to pay
an exorbitant price for our rapid transit.
A Loop-Hole in the Excise Law.
Major Sylvester's proposition that the excise
laws be strengthened by providing a
proper penalty for the offense of giving
liquor to a child, save as a medicine, should
meet with immediate response from Congress,
when the Commissioners have forwarded
It with their recommendation of
passage. The wonder is that this dangerous
loop-hole was never stopped before. As
the law now etanda, while th? saloon
keeper la bound not to sell liquor to a
minor, he can without risk sell It to an adult
who can then give It to the child without
incurring a penalty. This leaves open a
wide opportunity for evasions of the law
on the part of the dispenser of liquors. The
middleman in such a case is not today
punishable. He should be made to suffer
severely.
An insane man in New Tork fired on a
policeman because he desired- "company
heavenward." His ideas as to the future of
the average New York policeman are as
irrational as his conduct.
Books which treat marriage from a pessimistic
point of view do very little real
harm. People who are seriously contemplating
matrimony are too much preoccupied
to read them.
If as is reported Bonl is to marry a
wealthy woman. It looks as If the Gould
family ought not to be expected to pay all
his debts.
If Mark Twain has secured the President's
co-operation In copyright reform, he
ought hereafter to be willing to say "thru"
and "past."
Most of the rules laid down to prevent the
spread of germs are simply the rules of
common politeness.
Crowds are assembling to hear Caruso,
ana mere is more interest man ever in tne
animals In Central Park. Such is fame.
It begins to look as if spelling reform
would have to wait on posterity for most
of its vindication.
Solving the Problem.
Skeptics who have derided the possibility
of practicable human flight must admit that
material progress has been made during the
past few years, and especially during the
past few months. As long as the problem
was studied In the realm of slightly controllable
levitatlon. by means of gas bags
equipped with motors, there seemed little
prospect of a solution being attained. It ha*
been repeatedly demonstrated that balloon*
can, under favorable circumstances, be
directed through the air along generally
prescribed routes, but the conditions were
exceptional which permitted extended flight*
or striking dirigiblUty. As long a* the ma
cnine is suujeci w in? raganeg ui me wma
there can be no practicable human flight.
In France Santos Dumont has devised a
combination of automobile and aeroplane
with which he has taken short flights.
There is more promise In his small machine
than In the most highly developed of his
dirigible baUoons. In this country Dr.
Julian P. Thomas, who has heretofore interested
himself chiefly in non-dirigible balloons,
has devised a "wind wagon." which
Is practically a tricycle of which the mo
tive power is a large propener. tie has
demonstrated that this is capable of high
speed. Thus far he has not adopted aeroplanes,
but promises to conduct experiments
immediately in that direction.
Thus the race is now on between France
and the United States In the evolution of
tbe-wtnft motor ear with ?fr planes irMcli
will (tre flotation. If the advance in this
direction la as rapid as It has been In the
past In the development of the dirigible balloon,
flying can should In a few years, possibly
a few months, be in evidence. Had tbe
experimenters in this field of aerostation
devoted themselves earlier to the aeroplane
instead of persisting in their experiments
with the gas bag, it Is possible that today
thfl Mnnlna ehl? ??I? ? u- ?
?? ?uiF4 wanjriim iu> upeittlur
from point to point In safety, in all reasonable
variations of the weather, would hav?
been In evidence.
But it is too much to expect, now that
practical advances are being- made with the
motor aeroplane, that'the commercial "air
ship" of our dreams win be promptly forth
cuming. xi win do one thing to produce an
air motor car capable of carrying the operator,
and possibly a single passenger, to a
given destination In average weather condition^
and quite another thing to develop
the large air car capable of transporting
numbers. For a long time, probably, the
personally directed aeroplane must remain
more or less of a toy.
Since history began oM letters have had
a most unexpected and often embarrassing
fashion of turning up under new clrcum

One of the considerations that help to

it marks the end of the holiday shopping

SHOOTING STABS.
A New Version.
"How did you get Mr. Cumfox to provide
money for that project of your's?" asked
Miss Cayenne.
"I invited him to a very select dinner
party."
"I understand. It was one of the cases
where invitation was the sincerest flattery."
Terms.
"What does Bllgglns say about his automobile?"
"I can't exactly tell."
"Too many technical terms?"
"No. Too many that as a gentleman I
cannot reDeat."

The saddest 'tis to contemplate

"You Insist that your wife Is a most exceptional
woman?"
"I do," answered Mr. Meekton. "She
takes exception to everything I suggest."
A Candid Avowal.
"Do you think you will be able to convert

Remorse.
The lights on every hand shone fair.
Full sprightly was the passing jest;
And laughter rippled through the air
And echoed with increasing zest.
The hours sped gladly on their way

Ami yesterday is long ago.
The Ice that tinkled in the glass
Now presses 'gainst an aching brow.

The difference 'twixt then and now!
There was a time when all way gay
With every joy life could bestow;
There was a time called yesterday?
But yesterday Is long ago.
Danger in Overheated Booms.
from the Philadelphia Press.
The season of ttie year is at hand when
tuberculosis gets in Its work with most
deadly effect. The cold, raw days of winter
are particulaxly conducive to the spread of
this disease, not because they are cold and
raw but because people insist upon shutting
themselves up in superheated rooms without
proper ventilation. It has been definiteI
VwAonnJ *U<. * ' **
i/ |/t.vvcu wvjrvuu IUO bhkUI?S( OOUOl IQai
no single cause la so conducive to the
spread of tuberculosis as overheated offices
and overheated and ill-ventilated living and
sleeping rooms. A "baked" atmosphere
causes loss of vitality, weakens Che resisting
power to disease and brings all the physical
forces to a condition where the slightest
exposure to the chill outside air invite*
an attack of disease upon throat and lungs.
In Their Seats!
From the Philadelphia Bulletin.
The scheme to equip the committee rooms
in the new Senate and House office build
ings at Washington with electrical devices
by which speeches and debates may be
heard In these apartments through the
adaptation of the telephonic principle is Ingenious.
But K may Se doubted whether It
should be used, even If it is proved to be
practicable. The proper place for members
of both branches of Congress when Important
matters are under discussion la in their

Uncle Joe Is Congress.
From the Chicago Becord-Herald.
The Washington Star says there is "no

over what Congress may do this winter?that
is unless "Uncle Joe" shall stand

dlate revision of the tariff.
