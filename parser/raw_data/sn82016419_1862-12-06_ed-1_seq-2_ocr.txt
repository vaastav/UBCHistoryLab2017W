ITE3IS DY LAST NIC'IIT'S MAI L.
Gen. Blunt reports that the ubels con
tinued their flight, after the battle of the
28th ult., and are now in Van Buren, Ar
kansas. Rebel prisoners state that the
rebel force was 11,000. Blunt eays :
"The rebels were compelled to abandon two
pieces of artilley, disabled by my batteries.
A number of their officers were killed. The
notorious Quantrile and his band were en
gaged in the fight, with Col. Shelby and
Emmet ilcDonald commanding the rear
guard in the retreat across the Boston
mountains. They fought desperately. Some
of Quantrile's men were killed, and others
taken prisoners. Our loss in killed is five,
and four more were mortally wounded, one
of whom, Lieut. Col. Jewell, Sixth Kansas,
has tince died. Lieut. Campbell, Kansas
Sixth, was taken prisoner. The los3 of the
enemy in killed was abcut 72. Two contra
bands arrived to-day from Van Buren, who

The news from our army in the South-1 Legislature in the beation of this important
west is cheering. Grant is advancing.
Nothing new from Fredeiicksburg.
It is reported that Burnside ha3 been su
perseded by Hooker, but the report lacks
confirmation.
The Democrats have already commenced
boring Congress by introducing resolutions
inquiring into the particulars of the arrest
and imprisonment of rebels in the North,
tut we are glad to see that they have been
promptly tabled by handsome majorities.
A GOOD THING.
The following information will be received
with joy by all good, loyal men, and those
who are opposed to army thieves: "Gen.
Grant's recent orders, putting the whole
cotton trade at the seat of war in the hands
of the Government, and securing enormous
profits of the trade to the Government or its
agent, are believed here to be the forerunner
of the adoption of a similar policy through
out the entire region in which our armies
are operating. Members of the Cabinet
here intimated ten days ago that Gen. Grant
was deliberating on the propriety of secur
ing the profits on cotton trade for the Gov
ernment." We have heard of many officers who have
.ined their pockets by cotton speculations.
"Some have made a3 high a3 Si 0,000. We
"hope Grant will put a stop to this species of
atealing. It will put thousands of dollars in
to the United States treasury, and the Gov
ernment is certainly entitled to any benefit
that may accrue from the operations of our
armies. If weunderstand the thing rightly,
this war is not waged for the pecuniary
benefit of colonels, quartermasters, etc., but
for the purpose of sustaining the authority
of the Government. Any man wuo would
thus dishonestly rob his Government to the
amount of what belongs to it, in these
times of sore tribulation, deserves to spend
the rest of bU life in the national peniten
tiary. Grant deserves great credit for the
Btep he has taken in this important matter.
After the war is over the country will bo
full of Generals, Colonels, Majors, Captains,
Corporals, etc., and a mau will be in great
danger of insulting every one he meets if he
does not know what important title he has
to the end of his cognomen. And then
there will be another class the army thieves
-those who will retire on fortunes they
hare stolen out of the war, and build fine
bouses and buy fine farms. Of all the peo
ple of the earth, they will be the moit de
tested by their fellow men. They will point
the finger of 6Corn at them, saying "There
goes a thief that robbed our government
while it was struggling for life with the
rebels." Let them be marked.
. We have heard the names of three gentle
men, only, mentioned in connection with
the Speakership Messrs. Kellogg, of Leav
wortb, Dowthitt, of Shawnee, and Saunders
of Coffey.
We have heard the' names of John Francis,
Davies Wilson and Dow Adams, mentioned
in connection with thr. Secretaryship of the
State Senate; and A. It. Banks for Chief
Clerk -of the House.
. The enterprising proprietors of the Leav
n worth Bulletin have commenced the issue
ot a morning edition of their excellent daily,
t Leavenworth. The Bulletin boys are
determined not to be outdone by any of their
neighbors, if industry and enterprise will
prevent it. They publish a tri-weekly and

at 83 per annum, and the latter at 81. We

focation of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind J
Asylums, will, it is supposed, constitute
,;n,;l R11l,inu of legislation at the I
tuv ' "i J - O 1
coming session. I nese are, uouuutss,
portant questions, and should bs carefully
legislated on.
From our geographical position, and the
fact that the outlets forour trade are near
the northern boundary of the State, we can
not reasonably expect much direct benefit
from railroads at the present. What may
be in the Future, it is not worth while to
discuss. -
Conceding, then, the principal benefit to
be derived from railroads.. to the northern
portion of the State, we do claim that the
public institutions should be located in
what is now termed Southern Kansas, but
which is in reality near the geographical
center of the State.
From what we can learn, there will be
three places brought forward by their re
spective friends as points at which to locate
i the Siate University, namely, Manhattan,
public institution. It is no argument to
say that we are near the border of the set
tlements. This is so, but it is because the
country to the south of us is held as Indian
reservations. Within the next five years,
these hands will be thrown open for settle
ment. Even now, the Indians are anxious
that the Government should treat for them.
When this is done, the country to the south
of us will be quickly settled, as it compri
ses the best portion of the State. The loca
tion of these public buildings is not for a
day, or a year, but it is a permanent thing,
and the probable future as well as the pres
ent is to be taken into consideration.
Ever since Kansas had a name, there has
been a persistent disregard of the interests
of the South. As instances in proof of this,
take the apportionment with "nineteen dis
franchised counties;" the formation of the
first State ticket under the Wyandott Con
stitution nearly every man upon it being
north of the Kaw river, or upon its imme
diate line; the State officers recently elected,
the major portion being north. If any of
this spirit is manifested at the ccmiDg ses
sion, our advice to the members of the
Legislature from the sou.tu is, that they
form a combination and act together, and
if we are not to have a fair showing in the
location of the State institutions, th.en de
feat the railroad bills as fast as th.gy are
introduced.
WEEKLY SUMMARY OF NEWS.
Rlunt Scatters the Rebels.
The following dispatch was received at
headqua-rteri in St. Louis, cn Saturday
nighw last:
Headquarters, Battlefield, Nov. 29.
2'o Jt. Gen. Curtis:
General Learning that a rebel force,
under Gen. Marm-iduke, 8,000 strong, was
at Cane Hill, forty miles noith of Van Bu
ren, Ark., and that Gen. Hindman was to
join mm to-day or to-morrow with a large
force of mt iutry, for the purpose of making
a desperate effort to enter Missouri, I deter
mined to strike Marmaduke and destroy him
before reinforcements arrived.
Leaving my transportation in the rear, 1
made a forced march of thirty miles, with
about 5,000 men, and attacked him at ten
o'clock this morning. Found him 6trongly
posted, on advantageous ground.
After an engagement of about three
hours, he commenced to retreat. Every
foot of the ground was fought over, and
hotly contested unt'.l near sundown, when
the enemy Ending that their artillery,
which they had made every effort t get
away, was about to be captured sent Cols.
Shelby and Emmett McDonald with afkgof
truce, for the ostensible purpose of caring
for their dead and wounded, but with the
real Object of making good their retreat to
van Buren. The casualties of the dav
am unauie io swte wim accuracy at tins
ground. One of ihe rtbi officers with the
flag of truce 6tated to me that thev had lost
sixty iu killed, among them a Lieutenant
Colonel. My loss is comparatively small.
Amon the wounded are Lieut. Colonel
Jewell and Lieut. Johnson, of the Kansas
Sixth, both of them, I fear, mortally.
The enemy are badly whipped, and will
probably not venture north of the Boston
mountains again this winter, if this part of
the State is held, as it is their reliance for
subsistence, and having eaten all in the val
ley, they must retreat into Texas.
- I have sent for m' tranapoitation to come
up, and shall occupv a position at or near
Caue Hill.
The rebels had ten days rations, and in
tended malting a desperate effort to force
their way North.
James G. Blckt,
Brig. Gen. Com'dg.
The army correspondent of the Philadel
phia Inquirer, writing from Acquia creek,
says: Daily, hourly, and, in fact, momenta
rily, vre expect to hear tha first gun fired
that will inaugurate the first grand baUl of
this campaign, for it is in this vicinity that
almost the entire rebel army is cenceutrated, j
100,000 strong, aud alao the three grand'

The latest advices from the headquarters
of the Potomac rmy say that "considera-

nau ceeu msue vy wjeuci$ ivr an arruis-;
tice of thirty days, and that Gen. Lee was
already i;i Washington arranging p? rrins
of the agreement. No credence is put iu the
rumor, however. The rebels are working
with redoubled vigor on their fortifications,
and their cavalry, of late, have been very
active, and have captured a number of our
pickets along the river, besides the two
companies of the Third Pennsylvania cav
alry at Harwood Church. Longstreet com
mands the right and Hill the left of tie
rebel force confronting us. Deserters com
ing within our lines report that a large body
of their forces has been detached and sent
off, either to Richmond or to reinforce
Stonewall Jackson. These reports must be
received with great caution." The rebels
are at their old freaks, and are trying to get
up some kind of a ruse to check the ad
vance of our army until they are fully pre
pared to meet it. They have generally
succeeded in these little tricks, .and, we
suppose, will, this time. .
A dispatch from Cairo of the 29th, has
the following cheering information from our
army in Mississippi: The grand armr of
the South is iu motion. Gen. Sherman, vith
his forces, left Memphis Wednesday. Gen.
Grant's army struck their tents at daylight
yesterday, and marched off on the Holly
Springs road. Ten days' rations were pre
pared, and only one tent allowed to esch
twenty men, one to the officers of each
company, and six wagon3 to each regiment.
The rebels are falling back toward Grenaca,
tearing up the track, carrying off the rails,
and burning bridges, a3 they retire. It is
reported that they are even removing their
heavier valuables from Jackson, Miss.
Prisoners confess to the hopelessness of
their cause in the West.
A Washington dispatch states that Bum
side had a long consultation with the Pres
ident, Gen. Halleck, and the War and Navy
Departments. A Cabinet meeting was af
terwards held. That sounds a good deal like
the old song.
New Orleans account's give glowing de
scriptions of a Union, demonstration leld on
the 15th inst. "Resolutions wee adopted
sustaining the Administration, expressing a
desire oC the speedy open-ng of the Missis
sippi, and indorsing the rule of Gen. Butler.
Lee's headquarters are visible two miles
back cf Fredericksburg. The rebels are
still erecting earthworks, and have rifled
cannon commanding all the fords and
bridges.
The Chicago Tribune announces that
Gen. Grant has hitherto been held back by
Gen. Halleck, who is responsible for the
policy which has kept our army about Mem
phis and Corinth so long inactive. These
restrictions are now removed, and General
Giant is ready for a forward movement.
It is. rumored that Beauregard has pro
nounced Charleston indefensible, and that
inhabitants are moviug their property from
the city.
Six ships of war are now in pursuit of
the pirate Alabama. Capt. Semmes is at
last in danger.
A telegram from Washington of the 28th
says: We have but little news from Fred
ericksburg, beyond the fact that all i3 quiet.
An officer from there who arrived this
evening, and who was in Fredericksburg
yesterday under a flag of truce, says Lee is
massing the bulk of his army there, and
that the rebels already have earthworks
more formidable than ours. The river
might have been crossed a week ago, per
haps, with ease, but it cannot be denied
that it would be a serious undertaking now.
No 6igns of immediate active hostilities are
viible. On the other hand, another offi
cer from Fredeiicksburg brings the some
what improbable story that he yesterday
heard Burnside himself say. that he would
Ilbrin
ou an engagement next week. It is
,reiUr'!v said here that Burnside ex pected to
find material for wharves and everything else
for want of which he has been kept waiting,
ready for him when he arrived at Falmouth
Ihe blame for this disappointment is laid
to an officer outside of Burnside's army.
Later dispatches, which we publish to
day, seem to indicate that something is to
be done at Fiedericksburg soon.
Incendiaries are trying to burn the city
of Memphis. On Sunday night, the 23d
ult., there were ten different fires, and on
Monday night four'een showing conclu
sively that there is a concerted movement
for the destruction of the city. Great alarm
exists in consequence.
The political prisoners at Fort Lafayette,
including Pierre Soule, have been released.
The reason is not given. We presume it
is to show mora leniency, to the black
hearted traitors.
Hoa. Frnk P. Blair, jr., has resigned his
seat in the present Congress, ia order to
take command ot" a brigade at Helena, Ar
kansas. "

tection of the U. S. Government. They left
tne rest oi ineir oanu, numuenug been
hundred in all, on Wralut Creek, in this State,
eighty miles south of Leroy.
These ladiaas bring with them a largje:
number of scalps anu me intelligence of a!
bloody fight at Fort Cobb in the Iod
Territory, on the 21st of October.
The loyal force comprised 340 Wichitas,
163 Towakonbs, 137 Kakos, 67 Kechies. a
few Kaddos and about 30 Shawnees. The
rebels were led by Col. Leper at the head of
six hundred of the Tongkawas. Leper is a
white man. and the Confederate agent of the
Affiliated Tribes. The loyal Indians were
entirely successful, having defeated their
opponents and slaughtered large numbers of
them on the field, among them Col. Leper.
Getting news that Cheely Mcintosh was
approaching with a large body of Texans and
Indians, the Wichitas fled to this State.
They accomplished the journey of about
three hundred mile3 in a month and a day.
They brin? with them the pipers of the
head Tongkawa chief, all of which were
captured. The papers cover a period of
thirty years, and some of them bear the sig
natures of Gen. Sam. Houston, Gov. Lamar,
Albert Rust, and other well known South
ern men.
It will be remembered that Fort Cobb
was evacuated by the U. S. troops in March,
'61, and was soon after taken possession of
by the Texans.
The. Wiehilas have always been represent
ed a3 friendly Indians, and the last report
of the Indian Bureau shows that they were
among the last to accept the overtures made
to them by the Confederate agents.
This last fight shows that the rebels have
a more serious enemy to eontend with in the
Indians of the South west than that encoun
tered by us in Minnesota. Leav. Conserv
ative. Highly Interesting Humors.
Washington, Isov. 30.
Special to Missou.vi Democrat: To-morrow's
Philadelpha E-uqulrer wiU contain a
Washington. dis-rttch, professing to have
reliable !afor-tnation direct from Richmond.
The surtance of its information, which is
Proably of an average reliability, or more,
is as loiiows:
The people of Richmond have been hav
ing another panic for the last two weeks;
the real oval of Gen. McClellan, and the ra
pidity of Burnside's movements, were the
first causes. At the time of Burnside's
movements Loiigstreet was iu Richmond on
his way to North Carolina, the campaign
beiig supposed to be over for the winter.
Part of his corps were with him. lhey
were put on the works around llichmond at
once, while he took the cars to Fredericks
burg to hold the Rappahannock line if pos
sible, and not to retard our movement until
Lee came up.
There are now from 200,000 to 250,000
men in the works in and around Richmond,
and but 80,000 north of there, including
Lee's and Jackson's forces.
Jackson has been recalled, with Stuart,
from the valley, to form the left flank of
Lee's forces. Jackson was opposed to com
ing, and wanted to keep up a division of
our forces by raids into Maryland and Penn
sylvania, but was over-ruled by Lee and
Davis.
The Cabinet at Richmond have ordered
Lee to throw his whole army on the Rappa
hannock and dispute every foot of ground
thence to the rebel capital.
They have plenty of raw provisions, and
millions of pounds of pork, beef and flour,
are accumulating at Richmond. Vessels
with clothing are running the blockade ev
ery week, but their army is suffering terri
bly.
Numerous recent events have served to
influence the Richmond panic, such as Lee's
suddenly changing from the offensive to the
defensive; his telegraphing daily for more
men to save thecapit-.l; petitions and appeals
of their army for clothing; Gm. Dix's cap
ture of their pickets in the Chickahominy ;
the discovery that they have lost from 60,
000 to 100,000 men in the last 95 days by
battle, sickness and desertion; and indica
tions of slave insurrections. Burnside and
the Government are believed to have full
acquaintance with these facts, and Burnside
regards his force as ample for the work be
fore him.
Interesting Items From the South.
.Cairo, Nov. 30.
Another movement of great importance
has been made from Helena. The Missis
sippi 13 raising at that point, and is nine feet
now in the channel. Tbe guerillas below
Helena are so near starved out that they are
willirrg to trade cotton for supplies. The
Confederates are said to be 9,000 strong at
Arkansas Post, on Arkansas river. There
ha3 been no rise in that stream. Gen. Joe
Johnston h3S been appointed to command
the -department -of the West, in place of
Pemberton.. Part of Bragg's army is said
to have reached Aberdeen. At Memphis
jt Ab'd A Wft m.et;nf, was held
at Grenada to devise means of defense. The
Appeal says: The people are to turn out
en masse to resist the terrible invasion which
will bring in its. path destruction, desola
tion and death. It says Lincoln has be
come maddened at the defeat of his war pol
icy in the recent elections, and that now he
will use all means at bis command to bring
the war to a speedy close. According to the
Aberdeen correspondence of the Appeal, the
Confederate soldiers pray nightly for a bat
tle, and add a petition that their foe may
have plenty of bl3nket3. He says the Con
federates are ready to give Gen. Grant an
awful welcome, and that they will hold the
ground they now occupy, or the ground
will hold their dead bodies. He also com
plains that planters in the neighborhood of
Aberdeen show an unwillingness to let their
slaves assist in throwing up works of de
fense. Editorially, the Appeal grows in
dignant at this, and says they deserve a
visit from Lincoln's Abolition horde. We

From Europe Reply of Rusiu to the
Proposition for Intervention.
Halifax, Nov. ?6.
The steamer Africa arrived at this port
at 10 o'clock this morning.- The following
is additional to the news already telegraphed
from Cape Race: :
Liverpool, Nov. 15, p.m. The London
Morning Herald bitterly denounces the non
intervention policy of the British Govern
ment, and says the language of Lord John
Russell's dispatch mocks the hopes and in
sults the memory of half a million of starv
ing laboring men.
The Herald charges the British Cabinet
with abject patience and dastardly submis
sion in hopes to obtain the Parliamentary
support of the Bright and Cobden party.
The Daily Xews thinks that Lord Russell's
answer is the best that could have been made
without entering. unnecessarily upon, a dis
cussion of the merits vof the ' case, 'and re
joices at having escaped from diplomatic
associations with- r ranee. j
St. Petersburg, Noyk 15. The Journal
of St. Petersburg contains the reply of Prince
Gortschakoff o the.not ot Dryoun de Hill
yers, which is subsiauce as follows: Af
tP rtoaUinj; the constant efforts of Russia
in favor of conciliation, Prince Gortscb--
koff says that it is requisite, abov a'n things!
to avoid the appearance 0f anv pressure
whatever, capable of chilling public opinion
in America, of of exercising the susceptibil
ity of the nation. We believe that a combined
measure of the three great powers, however
conciliatory, if presented in an official or
officious character would be the cause of
arriving at a result right opposite to pacifi
cation. If. bowever, France should persist
in her intention of mediation, and England
should acquiesce in her course, instructions
shall be sent to Baron Stotckel, at Washing
ton, to lend both his colleagues there, the
French and English Ministers, if not official
aid, at least moral support.
Voting on Indian Reserves.
Attorney General Stinson having been ap
plied to for an opinion concerning the right
of persons living on Indian reserves to vote,
replies as foliows:
Leavenworth. Kansas,
November 15, 1862.
Hon. S. K. Shepabd Dear Sir: Yours
of the 12th, is at hand. Settlers upon In
dian Reservations, which by treaty between!
the United States and the tribes, are not,
without the consent of such tribes, to be in
cluded within the territorial limits of any
State or Territory, are not voters nor liable
to any taxation. See Act" of Admission,
Sec. 1,
Most of the Indian Reservations, includ
ing, I believe, the Kaw Reservation, are in
this condition. Respectfully yours,
S. A. STINSON,
Attorney General.
Tax Matters.
The Internal Revenue office has of late
been subjected to considerable annoyance at
the coutinous receipt of numerous letters
from assistant collectors, and other officers
of a subordinate grade holding a position
under the direct tax and excise law, asking
information in regard to the business or
their department. It should be known that
no consideration can be given to such com
munications, the bureau to which they are
addressed having as much is they cad at
tend to in the description of business relat
ing immediately to its control. Such parties
desiring information &hould apply to their
prncmals for it, and not the Department of
the Internal Revenue.
Falling Off in the Receipts of Wheat.
Tbe receipts of wheat at Chicago during the
month of October ju?t passed, amount to
1.937,561 bushels. The receipts during the
same month last year amounted to 3.665,
559. The receipts in Chicago and Milwau
kee during the months of September and Oc
tober of this year are about four millions of
bushels less than during the same months
last year. This indicates quite conclusively
that there is a deficiency in the wheat crop
of 1862. Chicago Journal.
It indicates to our mind, that zaoney is
plentier than it was last year, and the far
mers are holding on for better prices.
The Michigan House, at Leavenworth,
is one'of the best hotels in this State. We
have frequently noticed this bouse, and
what we say about it we believe our readers
will find to be so, if they etop there when in
tbe city. On our recent visit we were
pleased to see that Jim ShepherJ was 6till
officiating in the capacity of clerk. He is
one of the most obliging fellows we ever met.
Ludlum is one of the few who 'know how
to keep a hotel." Hs andShepherd are al
ways on the qui vive for the comfort of theii
gueets. Stop at the Michigan.
Congress met last Monday. The latest
dispatches 6ay the reports of some of the
Cabinet officers were not completed, in
consequence of which it was thought the
President's Message would not bejtransmit
ted until Tuesday. We 6hall lay the docu
ment before our readers next week;
