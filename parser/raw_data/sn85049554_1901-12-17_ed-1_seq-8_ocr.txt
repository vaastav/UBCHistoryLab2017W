GOVERNOR ROGERS RESPONDS.
State of Washington to Participate in
the St. Louis Fair.
Tacoma, Wash., Dec. 17.—Elmer E.
Johnston, formerly executive commis
sioner for Washington at the Pan
American exposition, was yesterday ap
pointed by Governor Rogers to work up
Interest among board of trade and
kindred organization? of this state in
the preparation of an immense Wash
ington exhibit for the St. Louis exposi
tion in 1903. The governor believes that
the state will undoubtedly desire to
exhibit Its resources at St. Louis, and
as the time will be short after tho leg
islature convenes until the fair opens,
the idea was conceived of getting the
exhibition prepared now In anticipa
tion of the desires of the legislature.
The governor asks that all commer
cial organisations co-operate with Mr.
Johnston, that expense .and time might
be saved after the appropriation is se
cured.
Nothing In the appointment of Mr.
Johnston guarantees him compensation
for his work at this time. There is no
doubt, however, that the legislature,
which convenes In January, 1903, will
make an appropriation of $7^,000 to
100,000 toward defraying expenses al
ready incurred and completing a
worthy exhblt of the varied resources of
the state.
General sentiment thruout the state
favors the erection of a large state
building at St. Louis. Mr. Johnston ts
an enthusiastic man about it and will
start his work immediately. He was
appointed as executive commissioner at
Buffalo when the affairs of this state
there were In a chaotic condition, and
rapidly transformed them into order
and system, with the result that many
new settlers are already coming to
Washington as a result of the state ex
hibit at Buffalo. It Is intended to du
plicate this work on a large scale at the
St. Louis'exposition.
SACRED PAINTING UNEARTHED.
Capt. Tarlton Tells How Ho Found an
Old Picture of the Mother Mary.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 17. Capt.
Charles Tarlton, formerly of the Thirty
sixth Infantry, while on actlve^duty in
the Philippines, came into possession of
a picture that has been appraised as be
ing worth not less than $5,000. The pic
ture Is a portrait 'bf the Mother Mary
clasping to her breast the dead form of
the Christ. It Is painted on a copper
plate eight Inches wide and twelve inch
es long, and is from the brush of an ar
tist of the sixteenth century. According
to artists and experts who have viewed
the work, it is by the hand of a Span
ish master, and, tho the Identity of the
artist has not yet been established, it is
said to be the product of a master.
Mystery and romance surround the
discovery of the ancient work. It was
found in the depths of a subterranean
passage, locked in a vault built in the
solid masonry. Here, it Is presumed, it
had lain for centuries, undisturbed and
forgotten. The circumstances attending
the discovery of the masterpiece are re
markable. Capt. Tarlton, at the head of
bis company, in 1900, was in command
of a town in southern Luzon. He was
ordered to search for arms believed to
be somewhere concealed about the pueb
lo, and In the search that followed stum
bled across the subterranean passage
that led from a church to a convent near
by. While exploring this underground
channel he uncovered indications that
pointed to a vault in the masonry, and,
instituting a search, found the massive
door that hid the opening. This he burst
open, and, gaining an entrance, found
on the inside a number of valueless pa
pers—ancient records for the most part
—and, securely wrapped in oil skins,
canvas and leather, the picture of the
Mother Mary with the dead Jesus rest
ing in her arms. .v''

War Department Anxious to Have
Congress Deal Liberally
W'ith Island.
Senators Piatt, Spooenr and
Lodge Confer With Secre
tary of War Root.
Root Favors Giving Cuba Advant
ages Not Accorded Many
of the Nations.
Washington, Dec. 17.—Senators Piatt,
Spooner and Lodge conferred at length
with the secretary of war Saturday af
ternoon as to the best program to pur
sue relative to the island of Cuba. The
war department does not disguise Its de
sire that congress shall deal generously
with the island. Secretary Root has
urged action of this kind in his annual
report, and thfc message of President
Roosevelt pointed out the obligation of
the United States In this direction. Since
the action of the ways and means com
mittee of the house in accepting the war
department program as to the Philip
pines there have been repeated state
ments of the hostility of the members
to conceralons to the Cubans. These
statements have been made In inter
views and to the secretary of war and
even the president by leading members.
One of the arguments made is that by
erecting a tariff barrier against im
ports from the Philippines, the United
States has taken actton which forbids
concessions to Cuba. \The claim is made
that we should not be liberal In our
treatment of an island which we have
announced Is to be given free and inde
pendent government entirely separate
from our Jurisdiction, and yet for is
lands which are for all time territory of
the United States tax imported prod
ucts.
At the conference of Saturday it is un
derstood that Mr. Root acknowledged
the force of this argument, and said
there was no objection to making the
same or similar concessions for the
Philippines which are made for Cuba.
He has taken the position that In urg
ing Immediate action as to the Philip
pines he was striving alone to return
and secure the status quo in the Islands.
Saturday the secretary admitted that if
concessions were given to the Cubans
there would be a Just cause of complaint
as to the treatment accorded the Filipi
nos. He will consent to alterations in
the present system of taxation for the
Philippines. He believes that the Unit
ed States can well make concessions in
a permanent tariff bill, and suggests
that in the measure which is now being
framed in the war department covering
the whole Philippine situation a new
trade arrangement with the Philippines
can be concluded. The measure In
question Is being worked out for leaders
In the ways and means committee of -the
house and tMose senators who are mat
Ihg a study of Insular affairs. It will
provide a system of civil governmentJfh
the islands different from the system
now in vogue. It will give to the is
lands, if approved by congress, a form
of civil or territorial government such
as Is now in vogue in Alaska. It will
provide territorial courts and the entire
machiney for a Judicial system. It
will make the governor, who will be ap
pointed by the president of the United
States, the commander-in-chief of the
army, anjd will probably statfe specifical
ly, as was done in the act for Alaska,
that the islands shall not have a repre
sentative In congress.
There will be no objection on the part
of the government to embodying In this
measure an advantageous trade ar
rangement for the United States. The
only concern the administration has is
that the announced "open door" policy
of this government in the east shall not
be violated. Whatever trade arrange
ments are made for the benefit of the
United States must be framed with the
fact in view that Spain will share with
us for a period of ten years In the ar
rangement. President McKlnley, when
the treaty of Paris was under c&nslder
atlon, gave to the nations of the world
the assurances that is was the Intention
of the United States to preserve the
open door policy in the Islands and
there is no intention on the part of the
administration to fail to carry out the
assurances which were given by the
dead president. No definite steps as to
final legislation for the Philippines will
be taken until Governor Taft arrives
from Manila.
In considering the Cuban concessions
the open door policy does not figure.
Secretary Root told his conferees that
national honor demanded that this coun
try should give to the Cubans advantag
es which they have lost thru the war
with Spain. American occupation has
taken from the islands the market
which they enjoyed In Spain. High tar
iff barriers keep the Cuban products
from this country. The secretary was
asked as to what concessions the Cu
bans could and would make to the Unit
ed States in return and promptly de
clared that the Cubans wanted conces
sions on sugar, tobacco and coffee and
In return he could name ninety articles
which the Cubans would open their
markets to gladly. He does not confine
the talk of reciprocal concessions to the
articles which have been named by Gen.
Wood, soft lumber, rice, cotton goods
and textiles, but says manufacturers of
the United States will be given openings
in any possible line they may suggest.
Nothing in the way of definite steps for
concessions are advised In advance of
the formation of the independent gov
ernment in Cuba on Feb. 26.
Conferences and discussions at this
time are designed solely to bear on pub
lic sentiment and sentiment among
leaders In congress. When the time
comes for actual legislation to be urged
the war department will come forward
with a mass of statistics to show the
deplorable condition prevailing now and
the urgent necessity for something to be
done for the ward of the United States
It Is the hope of the administration that
the arrangement be a permanent one,
but falling In this desire congress is to
be urged to make an arrangement which
will give the Cubans an outlet for the
crops now being harvested. The feeling
which is shared by a large number of
members of congress that the Cubans
have proven ungrateful for all that has
been done for them and that Cuban an
nexation, the only lasting solution of the
Cuban question, will be hastened by a
policy of indifference to the island by
the United States, will be met with the
representations that the direful condi
tion in which the Cubans find them­
selves calls for our consideration on hu
mane grounds and to preserve the na
tional honor in dealing with a weaker
nation.
Opposed to Free Tobacco.
Washington, Dec. 17—"Wisconsin is
now developing an extensive tobacco
industry," said Representative Eseh of
that state, "and for this reason I am not
willing to admit the Cuban tobacco into
this country free of duty. Neither am
willing to admit their sugar free. In the
past Cuba has paid the tariff duties on
sugar and tobacco, and has made a large
profit out of these products. Nothing
has occurred to my knowledge which
will prevent the Cubans conducting
their sugar and tobacco plantations on a
profitable basis even if they pay the full
Dingley rates.
"There is a sentiment in favor of mak
ing some slight concession to the two
leading Cuban products as long as Cuba
occupies Its present position—that is,
while we are exercising what may be
termed a protectorate over the island. A
slight conccsslon would not work an In
Jury to American products, but it would
greatly encourage the Cubans.
"What we need is reciprocity with Cu
ba as long as it is an independent na
tion. If the island Is annexed to the
United States there will be free trade.
When free trade exists between Cuba
and the United States congress will un
doubtedly see to It that legislation is
enacted which will not make Cuba a
gateway for the entrance of European
products into the United States."

Castro Regarded as Little More
Than an Adventurer--Ger
many's Claims.
Washington, Dec. 17.—The dispatches
from the United States saying that this
government will not Interfere If Ger
many seeks to collect her claims against
Venezuela, printed In that country and
severely criticised by the Venezuelans,
reflect the true feeling at Washington.
There has not been a departure from the
Monroe doctrine in a single particular,
but nothing in that doctrine, as it has
been Interpreted by successive secreta
ries of state, contemplates Interference
by this country with any nation seeking
to collect a claim from an American
c'ountry so long as the proceedings in
this line contemplate no permanent oc
cupation of territory on this continent.
The United States shares In the gen
eral feeling against the Venezuelan gov
ernment as now administered by Presi
dent Castro. He has insulted and villl
fled our representative to his country,
and it has been only the extreme for
bearance of our government In dealing
with a weaker nation that has prevented
us from administering a corrective to
Castro. While Just now the Information
at the state department indicates that
the possibility of a war between Argen
tina and Chill is much greater than an
armed demonstration in Venezuela, the
fact is not lost sight of that Castro's
sway is uncertain. He has robbed the
people at every opportunity. He has In

which he has dealings, Just as he now
defies Germany In urging a claim In
which there Is every indication of Jus

In addition to the claims for damages
as the result of the last revolution in
Venezuela, there is a claim of nearly
$2,000,000 on account of railroad subsi
dies granted German contractors and
guaranteed by the Venezuelan govern
ment. The government repudiates these
claims without offering an excuse. It
refuses to even consider them. It urges
that it has offered territory in satisfac
tion of the claims, knowing full well
that no foreign nation can accept such
an offer without running afoul of the
well-known Monroe doctrine of the
United States.
There is amass of evidence in the pos
session of the United States government
to show that Castro is but an adventur
er. He secured his present position as
the head of the government thru treach
erous revolution. Ever since he has been
the chief executive he has ground out of

The seizure by Germany of a Venezue
lan part may bring to the United States
some embarrassing situations. This will
be particularly true If Castro carries out
his threat to immediately declare free
trade for all countries sending products
into Venezuela. It will hardly be effect
ive, as our own supreme court has held
that special taxes may ^e levied under
Buch circumstances as those which
would be presented by Germany's at

States will be neutral and will regret a
step on the part of Germany against
Venezuela, but there .will be no inter

there is a disclaimer of an intention to

Insults offered to our own minister,
which resulted in his withdrawal from
