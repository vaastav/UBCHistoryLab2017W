CONGEESS CONVENES.
Proceeding of the First Day's Meet,
ing of Closing Session.
- Senate Meets In the Shadow of the Death
of Two Members President's Message
Read to Both Bodies Unimpor
tant Preliminaries.
Washington, Dec. 4. When the sen
ate convened yesterday for the short
session of the Fifty-sixth congress
it was within the shadow of the death
of two of its most distinguished mem
bers. The fall of Senator Frye's gavel
caused a hush to fall over the cham
ber at 12 o'clock, and then Mr. Mil-
burn, the venerable blind chaplain, in
a beautiful prayer, paid touching
tribute , to the deaths' of Senators
Davis and Gear.
The call of the roll disclosed the
presence of 61 senators and the sen
ate then proceeded to routine busi
ness. William B. Dillingham was sworn
in to fill the unexpired term of the
late Justin S. Morrill.
The senate, on motion of Senator
Hale, then took a recess of 40 min
utes and on reasf-embling Senator
Hoar announced that the president
had expressed his pleasure that con
gress once more was, in session and
that he would communicate with it
forthwith. Instantly Maj. 'Truden,
one of the secretaries of the president,
was recognized and presented the
awaited message of the president. It
took Mr. Bennett, the secretary of
the senate, one hour and 50 minutes
to read it.
Senator Allison then announced the
death in July last of his colleague,
Senator John Henry Gear, and of
fered the usual resolution of sorrow,
which was adopted.
Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, who
had returned only two hours before
from St. Paul, anifounced formally
the death of Senator Davis, saying
that in his death "the nation has lost
one of its wisest public servants and
the state of Minnesota one of its dis
tinguishd sons."
The senate then at 3:45, on motion
of Senator Allison, as an additional
mark of respect for the memories of
Senator Gear and Senator Davis, ad
journed. The Proceeding In the House.
Washington, Dec. 4. The opening
of the session in the house yesterda3r
.. was brilliant, but not exciting. There
were the usual throngs in the galleries
and the usual display of floral pieces
on the floor but the proceedings were
purely' formal, consisting of the
rapping; to order by the speaker,
prayer by the chaplain, the roll call
of members, the appointment of the
formal committees to wait on the
president and the reception and read
ing of the president's message. De-
spite the fact that a great presiden
tial campaign hacl concluded within a
month the best of feeling seemed to
prevail between victors and van
quished. The reading of the message,
which naturally was the feature of
the day, occupied over two hours. It
was listened to with respectful inter
est by both sides.
When Speaker Henderson called the
house to order at noon the desks of
half the members were freighted
with flowers , from admiring friends
of constituents. Then the blind
chaplain delivered a' prayer. In his
invocation the chaplain referred feel
ing to the deaths of the late Repre
sentatives Daly, of New Jersey, and
Hoffecker, ' of Belaware, "which " oc
curred during the recess.
Messrs. Payne (rep.; N. Y.), Gros
venor (rep., O.) and Richardson (dem.,
Tenn.) were appointed to join the
committee of the senate to notify
the president that congress was in
session and ready to receive any com
munication from him. The clerk also
was directed by resolution to notify
the senate that the house was ready
to do business. After the adoption
of these formal resolutions the house,
at one o'clock, took a recess until two
o'clock, when the president's message
was laid before the house. Its reading
was listened to attentively.
The deaths of the late Representa
tive Hoffecker, of Delaware; the late
Representative Daly.vof New Jersey;
the late Senator Gear, of Iowa, and
the late Senator Davis, of Minnesota,
were then announced and after the
adoption of resolutions of regret the
house as a further mark of respect
' to the memory of the deceased states
men at 4:20 p. m. adjourned,

THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
Secretary Root's Annual Report Touches'
Upon Many Interesting- Topic. Inclo.1- '
lac Work In Oar New Territory.
Washington, Dec 4. Hie annual
report of Secretary Root is of more
than usual interest owing to its wide
scope and the fact that it treats of
subjects of such importance as the
Philippine insurrection, the Chinese
campaign, the developments in Cuba
and Porto Rico and finally, with the
subject of army reorganization.
The chapter of the report treating
of military operations in the Phil
ippines is a recital of the features
of the campaigns ' that were ton-
ducted in the islands during the past
year. It is said that the purpose was
to pursue the small bands of Filipinos
scattered throughout the islawcls.
The effort was successful and re
sulted in the further and practically
complete disintegration of the insur
rectionary bands; in the rescue of
nearly all the American and Spanish
prisoners; in the capture of many of
the leading insurgents and the de
struction of large quantities of arms
and supplies. Secretary Root says
that with the execution of the mili
tary plans there, all formal and fien
resistance to American authority in
the Philippines terminated, leaving
only an exceedingly vexatious and. an
noying guerrilla warfare, of a charac
ter, closely approaching brigandage,
which will require time, patience and
good judgment to finally suppress.
Touching Cuba the report says that
the conduct of affairs there during
the year has been" a continuance of
the process of aiding the Cuban peo
ple in. the development of the Cuban
government in such a way that, when
fully organized, it shall be stable and
efficient. This has been done by
guiding the Cubans in the first steps
of systematic self-government, and by
introducing, mainly through Cuban
officers, such reforms in administra
tion as shall ' serve to put the busi
ness of government in fairly good con
dition when a complete Cuban ad
ministration finally assumes control
of the government of the island.
In Porto Rico, where th.j army con
trolled up to the first of May, its
principal function was the improve
ment of the civil administration, ac
customing the pe.ople to the exercise
of the powers of government and con
tinuing the work of relief made neces
sary by the deplorable condition in
which the island had been left by the
great hurricane. The secretary ac
cepts as his own Gen. Davis' state
ment as to the creditable way in
which the army discharged the trust
committed to it in Porto Rico, and
he adds an expression of grateful ap
preciation of the devotion, judgment,
good temper and ability exhibited by
Gen. Davis.
