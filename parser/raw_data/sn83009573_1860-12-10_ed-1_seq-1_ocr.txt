BALTIMORE. Dec. 8,1860.

New York Exchange is still tending upward and it may
he quoted to-day at 2#@3 per cent, premium The feel
ing in financial circles is exceedingly gloomy, but the
rates for paper are about as they were, and in other re
spects the state of the money market is unchanged.

We have no report of the proceedings of the Second
Board to-day.
The New York rost of Saturday evening says
The general complexion of money matters remains as
before, though some encouragement is drawn from an up
ward reaction in the stock market. The rates for paper
outside of bank do not relax in the slightest. First-class
names are obtainable at per cent. Call loans are
firm at 7 per cent. The stock market opened with a ma
terial advance on the low prices of yesterday, but this
was not maintained, and at the close there is a feverish
tone. New York Central closed at 69# (£7O, Erie 24#,
Michigan Central 43@43#, Illinois Central Ga
lena 69(ai59#, Toledo 20(a)20#. The serious break in
Rock Island adversely affected the Western list, and gave
rise to various conjectures as to the cause of the decline
of 4# per cent, under moderate sales. So far as we can
learn there is nothing wrong in the affairs of the compa
ny, and the pressure to sell probably is occasioned by the
maturity of contracts of one or two leading speculators
in the stock. The last sale at the close of the Board of
Rock Island was 100 shares at 43#. It is interesting at
this time to compare the low prices of 1957 and to-day
with the prosperous points of the latter part of Septem
ber, 1860, as follows:

1857. 3 SCO. prices.

The Foreign Exchange market closed very depressed
for the Arago's mail. The top selling rate for leading
bills on London was 102*. Good mercantile sterling was
done at a fraction below par.
In the Domestic exchanges we notice an advance at
Baltimore to 3 per cent. Philadelphia is unchanged. 2@
2*. Boston is rather easier, * per cent., the seller guar"
anteeing against suspension.
It is worthy of note among themany expedients which
business men are compelled to resort to in times like the
present, that a Western merchant intending to meet a
payment to a New York house, rather than submit to the
onerous rates or exchange, brought with him five liun
drcd barrels of (lour, expecting to turn it into cash here,
but now finds the sacrifice which be will be obliged to
make much greater than the large premium of exchange.
The derangement of the produce business at this point
has seldom involved greater sacrifices than now, and it is
not surprising that the wealthiest houses succumb. Se
veral of our leading receivers have suspended within a
tew days, with a great abundance of imperishable proper
ty on hand, which is unavailable for even paying trans
portation charges.
We annex a comparative statement of the imports of
foreign dry goods at New York for the week, and since
January 1:
For the week. 1858. 1859. 1860.
Entered at the port $480,191 $487,045 $969,917

Thrown on market... 63,998,534 104,112,875 96,630,509
The weekly statement of the Treasury shows a worse
condition than at any time since the height of the panic
in.1857.
RECEIPTS $619,780.95
Drafts paid 1,491,018.69
Drafts issued 1,468,458.77
Net balance 1,090,465.70
Besides this balance, there is $1,515,884.65 in the Mint
and its branches.
The Boston Cotrrier of Saturday says:
The share market continues its retrograde movement,
and although there is no panic feeling, prices melt away
steadily as Ice before a July sun. Some of the sound
Railroads are sustained in view of the near approach of
the January dividends, and consequent small amount of
stock thrown on the fharket.
The Philadelphia Bulletin of Saturday evening says;
The Stock market, if anything, Is more depressed than
ever.and the tendency for all classes of securities is down
ward. Reading Railroadopened with an improvement,
there heing some demand from the "shorts," but closed
unsettled. Slate Fives declined 1 per cent., and odd lots
were disposed of at 86. City Loans were feeble, with only
93 bid for the old and 97* for the new issues. Lehigh
Navigation declined 1*; Camden and Amboy Railroad
I*, Lehigh Scrip *, and Pennsylvania Railroad *. In
Bank stocks there is very little movement, and anv at
tempt to realize would only result in a material decline
The pressure for money on the street to day was again
heavy, and 12 to 18 per cent, was accepted for short first
class |>ai>er, and Bto 10 per cent, for call loans on stock
collaterals.

THE DAILY EXCHANGE.
FLOUR.—FIour, like almost everything else, is dull
and very heavy, and prices for it have evidently a down
ward tendency. Howard Street, Ohio and City Mills Su
per were all offered on 'Change tins morning at $4.75 per
bbl. without finding buyers, and we doubt if sales to any
extent of either variety could have been made at over
$4.50 per bbl. We quote Extra Flour heavy at the fol
lowing rates, viz: $5.12)4(u,5 25 for Ohio; for
Howard Street; $5.50 for standard City Mills; and SG.SO
@7.25 per bbl. for fancy brands do.
FAMILY FLOUR. —Welch's Family Flour is still selling
by the dray load at $9, but we qu'te Baltimore ground
do. at $7.75 per bbl. for the best brands. Ohio and Howard
Street Family can be readily had at $6@56.25 per bbl.
RYE FLOUR AND CORN MEAL. —We quote Rye Flour as
before at $4.25, but Corn Meal may be quoted to-day at
$3.12)4 for Baltimore, and $3.25 per bbl. for Brandy wine
r GRAIV.—For Grain of all desci iptions the market con
tinues dull and heavy. The receipts this morning were
however very light, .and the transactions were necessari
ly limited. There was no red Wheat at market, and on
ly two lots of white were offered, one of 900, and one of
800 bushels, the former of which sold at 130 cts., and the
latter at 140 cts. We quote red nominal at losallo cts .
Theie were only a few hundred bushels Corn
received, but we quote new as ranging from 50 to 58
cts., and old at 60 @6l cts. A lot of 300 bushels Pennsyl
vania Rye, the only parcel at market sold at 75 cts. We
quote Maryland at 70 cts. Of Oats there were some 4,000
bushels offered but only a few of them were sold. We
quote Maryland Oats at 28@30 cts., and Pennsylvania do.
at 32 a 34 cts.
HOGS.—Hogs continue very dull. They are held at
$0.75, but the packers do not seem disposed to take hold
of them at all, and we doubt if a lot of any size could be
sold at $6.50 per 100 lbs.
MOLASSES.—There is nothing whatever doing in Mo
lasses. There are no established prices for any variety,
and as it is useless to give quotations we omit them.
PltO\ ISlON'S.—There was a sale made here yesterday
for export, of 200 boxes short Middles deliverable in Fcb
ruary, the terms for which were kept private, but the
only transaction of moment we have heard of to day in
Provisions, is a sale of 50 tierces Western Lard at 1054
cts. Bulk Meat is offering at 7 cts. for Shoulders, and 854
cts. for Sides, without finding buyers, and we quote Bacon
at B)4@B# cts. for Shoulders, and 1054 cts. for Sides.—
There is no Mess Pork selling, but it can be readily
bought at sl7 per bbl., and possibly at a still lower
figure. We quote Beef nominal at sll@l2 for Baltimore
packed No. 1, and 13(a)14 per bbl. for do. Mess.
RICE.—We still quote Rice as ranging from 314 to 4 cts.
per lb. for fair to prime new crop. There is some inquiry
for it, and sales were made on yesterday and this morn
ing of some 200 tierces within the above range.
SEEPS.—Thare was nothing done this morning in CIo
verseed but it was freely offered at $5 per bushel without
finding buyers. We quote Timothy Seed nominal at s2@ 1
2.25, and Flaxseed at $1.25@1.35 per bushel.
SALT.—There is but little doing in Salt, but the rates I
for Liverpool are still as follows, viz.: 100 cts. for Ground '
Alum.lssfa) 160 cts. for Marshall's and Jeffrey k Darcy's
fine, and 175@180cts. per sack for Ashton's do. Turks
Island Salt is selling in lots from store at 25 ctj. per
bushel.
SUGARS.—There seems to be no demand for Sugars,
and we hear of no transactions whatever in them. The
market is not only dull, but extremely unsettled and de
pressed, and we can give no reliable quotations for them.
WHISKEY.—There were sales yesterday of 100 bbls.
Country Whiskey at 17 cts , 100 bbls. do. at 17ct5.,100
bbls .Ohio do. at 17H cts., and 400 bbls. do. at 18 cts., but
the only transaction we have heard of to-day is a small sale
of Countrj* at 17)f cts. per gallon. We quote City nomi
nal at 17)4 cts., and Ohio at 18 cts. per gallon.
DOMESTIC MARKETS.
NEW YORK MARKETS, Dec. B.—Flour. &c.-Tlie
demand for Western and State flour early in tlie day was
less active. The market opened heavily and prices were
rather easier and irreeular for the medium and low grades,
but ere the close of' Change, the inquiry increased and
the market closed firm with few sellers of shipping brands
at the opening rates. Thesales comprise 5,800 bbls at
$4.25@4,50 for superfine State and Western, J4 50(5)4.75
for extra State; $4.50(a)4.90 for low grades of Western
extra; $4.75 fa 5 for shipping brands of round hoop extra
Ohio, and $5.10@6.40 for trade brands do. Southern flour
is in moderate demand, but is held with more steadiness,
and is less freely offered at the close—the sales are 550
bbls. at $4 60@5 for mixed to good superfine Baltimore
and $5.15@7.00 for the better grades. Rye flour is dull,
but prices are not quotably lower—sales of 50 bbls. at
$3.20(g4.00. Corn meal is heavy at $3.20 for Jersey.—
Buckwheat flour is in fair demand and is more plenty at
$2.00@2.25 per 100 lbs. Grain.—The market opened dull
and prices nominal, but ere the close of business, a better
inquiry prevailed, and more cheerfulness was apparent
with less disposition to sell. The sales are 56,000 hush, at
95c.@$1 for Chicago spring; $l(o,1.08 for Superior to good
Mihvaukie club; sl.lO for red; State; $1.12 for red J Western;
$1.29 for ordinary white Canada, $1.34@1 35 for white
-Michigan. Barley is in fair request, but is held above
the views of buyers, Oats are dull and easier. We quote
at 36#@37# for State. Rye is held at 65 cts. with buy
ers at 60 cts. Corn is lower but a better feeling prevailed
in part for export. The sales are 43,000 bushels at 68 cts.
for Western mixed in store, and 58@59 cts. for do. afloat.
Provisions—the Pork market is dull and nominal. The
offerings are fair. Mess is offered at sl6 50 for old mess.
$17.50 for new do., and $10.50 for prime. Lard is hardly
so firm—sales of 70 bbls. at 10#@10# cts. Butter and
Cheese are dull and heavy. Coffee—the market for all
descriptions is still very dull and heavy, and we have
only notice of a sale of 38 bags Santos at 13# cts. Cot
ton—the market is quiet and steady at 9# cts. for Mid
dling Uplands, and 10 cts. for New Orleans and Texas
sales of some 500 bales. Molasses—the market is quiet.
We hear of sales of 60 bbls. New Orleans at 30®35 cts., 0
months. At auction, 100 bbls. new crop New Orleans at
25 cts. cash. Sugar—the market is dull and depressed

6#@6# cts., and 200 hhds. Cuba, on private terms.
Ashes—the market is quiet; sales of pots and pearls at
$5. Hides—we hear of no transactions. Buenos Ayres
are offered at 20 cts., 6 months, which is a decline. Oils—
I.inseed remain inactive at 53@55 cts. Fish Oils are
very dull, and the only transactions we have to notice is
a sale of 200 bleached winter and whale on terms not
made public. Rice is quiet, but steady—small sales at
$2.75'5f3 75 per 100 lbs. common to good. Whiskey—the
market is heavy and the inquiry is moderate—sales'of 400
bbls. at 17# cts.
PHILADELPHIA MARKETS, Dec. S.—There is less in
quiry for Cloverseetl and less firmness in prices. Small
sales from $5.25 to $5.75 per 64 lbs., but buyers now re
fuse to pay the latter figure. Timothy is held at $2 60
and Flaxseed at $1.60 per bushel. Xhe Flour market
presents no new feature and is totally devoid of vitality.
There is no shipping demand and the sales are confined
to the wants of the retailers and bakers from $4.75 to
$5.12# per barrel for common and choice brands of su
perfine. $5.12#@5.25 for extras, and $5 50 to $6.75 for
extra family and fancy lots—according to quality. No
movement in Rye Flour and Corn Meal. The former is
held at 3.62#@3.75, and the latter at $3.25 per barrel
The offerings of Wheat are small but the demand is
equally light and prices remain without change—a re
mark which will apply equally well to all kinds of grain.
Sales of 3,000 bushels good Pennsylvania red at $1 21 per
bushel, and 700 bushels prime Southern do at $1 07.
White ranges from $1.30 to $1.37 for common to prime.

cts. For Sugar and Molasses prices are almost nominal.

Whiskey is dull. Sales of Ohio bbls. at 19 cts.; Pennsyl
vania do. at IS#@l9 cts.; hhds. at 18# cts., and Drudge
at 18# cts., which is a decline.
BOSTON BOOT AND SHOE MARKET.-There is notli
ing of any consequence doing in boots and shoes, and the
prospects of the trade have not improved since last week.
But few orders are coming in from the West and North
west, and with the South business is almost suspended.—
The New England trade are purchasing moderate sup
plies. Prices are nominally the same. Manufacturers
are doing scarcely anything, and the movements in
leather and hides have been of the most limited charac
tor. All branches of the trade appear to be at a stand
still, and it is uncertain now when active operations will
be resumed. For California there is a moderate inquiry.
—Shipping List, December 8.
BOSTON DRY GOODS MARKET.—There is no im
provement to notice in the Dry Goods market since last
week. Business continues very quiet, but this state of
things is looked for at this season. Stocks have not as
yet accumulated to any extent, and were it not for the
troubles now agitating the country, business would move
on prosperously with a good basis. Manufacturers of
Cotton Goods feel confident of a good range of prices for
the present, and do not expect any decline. Heavy stan
dard Brown Sheetings are selling at 8* cts., and me
dium Sheetings and Shirtings at cts., with, a
fair demand. Bleached Goods generally have been
in moderate request and are less firm than
Brown. Some further considerable shipments of Brown
Drills the past week, and sales at 8* ets., at which they
are held firm. Within two weeks manufacturers have
reduced their stock, some 5(556,000 bales, and there is at
the close a better feeling than for some months past.
Bleached are quiet at B*@9 cts., and Blues at 10* cts.
Prints are very quiet. A Tew well known styles meet
with a moderate inquiry, but generally speaking the
trade is quite dull. De Laine manufacturers are closing
out the fall styles at a decline of 1(52 cts. per vard on the
prices current some weeks ago. For other descriptions
of Cotton Goods the market has been very quiet. Manu
facturers are now engaged in preparing their spring
styles.— Shipping List, Dec. 8.
WILMINGTON MARKET, Dec. B.—Turpentine—Fur

MURDER— Arrent of tie Murderer. —Yesterday
morning about four o'clock a negress named Eliza
beth Bradley, was found dead in her room in a house
on Granby street, near Gough street. She died
from in juries inflicted upon her by a negro named
John Thomas. Tnomas and this woman lived to
gether as man and wife, and in conjunction with
a negro family named Grooms, occupied the house
on Granby street. Thomas and tho woman fre
quently quarrelled, but none of their tights amount
ed to much until this last one. On the night of the
ntb instant, the two were together in a grocery
store, near their home, when they commenced
quarrelling in regard to the payment of the rent of
the house, and Thomas threatened her with vio
lence, and told her that when he got her home he
would beat her. They left the store, and as soon as
they were in the house the negro commenced a
most violent assault upon her, and finally struck
her a blow across the temple with a club, which
felled her to the floor, and inflicted a gash of two
inches in length, and also cracked the skull. The
negro Grooms who occupied the other part of the
house, ran to the woman's assistance, when Thomas
turned on him and endeavored to injure him. The
woman lingered nntil yesterday morning at four
o'clock. At that hour' Grooms"and his wife were
awakened by an unusual noise in the room occupied
by Thomas, and a few minutes afterwards they
heard Thomas leave the house. They thought that
something was wrong, and Grooms got out of bed
and went into the street, where he found polioeman
Rutherford, who entered the house and found the
negress lying on the floor quite dead. Coroner
Sparklin summoned a jury and held an inquest
over the body and a verdict was rendered charging
Thomas with the murder. Lieut. Elliott, with
several oflicers, started in pursuit of Thomas.—
About noon he returned to his home, and was ta
ken into custody, and Justice Iliss committed liirn
to jail for the action of the Grand Jury.
DEDICATION OF A CHURCH.— The new Methodist
Protestant Church, Northeast corner Monument
street and Broadways was dedicated yesterday
morning at eleven o'clock. The church is brick,
and the interior neatly, comf'ortabiv, but not ex
pensively finished. Much is due to the Hev. Jesse
.Shreeve, of the Washington Street Church, for the
rapidity with which it has been built. It was only
at the last meeting of the Conference that it tviis
determined to erect it. Mr. Shreeve has gathered
the little flock which designs worshipping in the
building, started the subscription to procure the
means ol erection, and now, at the end of eight
months, has the gratification of seeing it dedicated
to divine worship. Before eleven o'clock the bouse
was filled. The Rev. Dr. E. Y. Reese conducted
the services and preached a most able and eloquent
discourse. At the close of his sermon a collection
was taken up, and a liberal amount subscribed, in
the afternoon services were conducted by Rev. W.
H. Pitcher, and at night by Rev. H. C. Cushing,
and a collection taken up on each occasion. The
total amount was about SSOO, which will be a great
assistance in liqidating the debt which has been in
curred.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE INDIOENT SICK SOCIETY,
1860.—-The thirty-sixth annual report of the Indi
gent Sick Society has been made. The amonnt of
receipts for the 'year were $495.50, and the distri
bution 5403, leaving a balance in the treasury of
§92.50. The report again appeals to a generous
community for aid, to enable the Society to con
tinue its usefulness. For twenty-five years it lias
noiselessly dispensed its charities, and none can tell
the amount of suffering which has been relieved
and sorrow assuaged during the long years since
its organization. During the past vear 325 per
sons have received assistance. During the coining
year the Society hopes to be enabled largely to in"
crease the sphere of its usefulness, and to do this
it is necessary that the community should respond
liberally to the call for aid.
BURGLARY.— Sometime during Friday night, the
wholesale liquor house of James Hazlett & Bro., on
south Gay street, between Second and Lombard
streets, was broken into by thieres. Entrance was
gained by forcing a massive bolt of a rear door—
The thieves, it appears,.first commenced work with
a '•jimmy," but were compelled to use a crow-bar
before the door gave way. The drawers of the
desks in the counting-room, with one exception,
were opened and the contents scattered over the
floor. In the drawer which they failed to open,
was a valuable gold watch and chain. They also
visited the front part of the building, occupied bv
J. K. Sears & Co., wholesale tobacconists, but it
appears that they were afraid to operate there.—
The only articles taken were a few cigars.
MILITARY PARADE.—The Independent Greys will
make their annual Company parade this afternoon.
They will be accompanied by Feldtmnn's band, and
after marching through some of the principal
streets of the city, will pay their respects to Mrs.
Law, widow of the late Major James 0. Law, their
former commander, at her residence, on Hollins
street. The Greys, who expect to make a large
turnout, will be under the command of Lieutenant
Simpson, Captain Clarke being absent from the
city.
BURGLARIES.—Some time during Saturday night
or yesterday morning the dwellings of Mr.'Daniel
Ledley and Mr. IVm. A. Morrison, on Lombard,
near Carey street, were burglariously entered by
forcing open the shutters of the rear'buildings.—
From the house of the former named gentleman the
robbers carried away several coats and other arti
cles of apparel. Mr. Morrison misses a number of
silver forks and Bpoons. The thieves effected their
escape without discovery.
GAMBLING ON SUNDAY.—John Brown was arrest
ed yesterday morning, by officer Shipley, charged
with gambling on the Sabbath, at the house of Nor
ms Button, on St. Mary's street, between Boss
street and Madison avenue. Fined Stand costs,
lhe proprietor of the house was also arrested by
officer Ford, charged* with allowing gambling on
his premises on Sunday, for which he was
and costs, by Justice McLaughlin, and in default of
payment, committed.
MONSIEUR BLONDIN.—This gentleman of Niagara
renown, on Saturday night, carried upon his back,
upon the rope at the Front Street Theater, ex
tending from the stage to the upper tier of boxes,
Mr. Frazier of this city, whose weight is 173 pounds.
The feat was witnessed by a very large audience,
and is another evidence of the great nerve and
muscle possessed by Blondin. Mr. Frazier appeared
to enjoy his ride "piggy back," excessively.
FlßE.—About eight o'clock on Saturday night a
frame house on High street, near Fayette street,
was discovered on fire. Some minutes elapsed from
the time of the discovery until the alarm was given.
When the engines reached the scene the fire had
gained considerable headwav, but it was soon con
quered. The house belonged to Mr. A. Bobbin,
and is insured in the Equitable office of this city.
LAW INTELLIGENCE.
CRIMINAL COURT—JUDGE BOND.
After the call ot the Grand jury on Saturday,
and before that body had retired, Charles If. Pitts,
Esq., (Mr. Whitney and Mr. Pinkney sitting at the
trial table,) arose and addressed the Court. He said
thatbe came in as counsel for Mr. Whitney, against
whom two presentments had been tiled the
Grand Jury. Air. Whitnev declined farther to
serve as prosecuting officer of the Court, until the
indictments have been framed, and until be ehall
have bad a fair trial, which he (Mr. Whitney) de
sired should be a speedy one. He therefore would
request the Court to appoint some member of the
bar to prosecute the case, and also to draw the in
dictments upon the presentments Hied. Of course
it could not be expected that Mr. Whitney should
draw the indictments against himself, and it would
be necessary for the Court to appoint some one to
do it. The new Code, Mr. Pitts said, provided for
a case of this kind, and instructed the Court what
course to pursue in the premises. The Grand
Jury, continued Mr. Pitts, are now waiting to act
upon the indictments when they shall have been
drawn and presented to them. After this he un
derstood they would transact no other business.
Mr. Pitts then sent for a copy of the new Code.—
In the interim, Mr. Pinkney arose and said that the
presentments of the Grand Jury were so pcrfectlv
wild that the foreman of that body bad de
clined to sign them, and being so, it would
be impossible for him to draw indictments
upon them, even if he wished to do so.
He would further say, that he was the son of Wil
liam Pinkney, and though he might not have in
herited the fame of his father, yet he would not be
found wanting when his honor "was at stake, and
would here publicly proclaim that he would in no
way aid 01 abet in this persecution*— for prosecution
it was not. In repeated conversations with Mr.
Whitney, he bad desired ine to draw up the indict
ments, leaving out all considerations of personal
friendship between us; but I have steadfastly de
clined to do so, and would resign my position
before becoming a party in any way to such
a persecution. He would in no way bring dishonor
upon his name. After Mr. Pinkney was seated,
Mr. Pitts read from the 23 section, page 56 of the
Code, the following: "Whenever it shall become
necessary from the absence, sickness, or death of
any State's Attorney, the eeveral courts of this
State shall have power to appoint some competent
person to perform the duties of State's Attorney in
conducting criminal or civil cases depending in such
court until a States's Attorney shall be appointed
and qualify, or be able to attend and act in person,
88 fu® ca ee may be, and the person so appointed
shall receive the same compensation as the State's
Attornej." Alter which Mr. Pitts handed the book
£ Court, who, after reading, said—"Mr. Pitts,
the State's Attorney is neither absent, sick nor
dead. —Mr. Pitts—"He is absent, sir, to all in
tents and purposes, for be has declared that he
will not act in this Court until a full in
vestigation has been had into these eharges.
After a short interview with Mr. Whitney, Mr.
Pitts remarked, that gentleman desired him to say
that if bis Honor would appoint some one to pre
BALTIMORE, MONDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1860.
pare the indictments, he (Whitney) would sign
them as pro3i cuting oflicer. He was anxious to
I have this case brought to a close as speedily as pos
sible. The Court then, turning to the Grand
Jury, remarked that it might as well discharge
that body nntil some future day—until next Sat
urday, to give time for the Court to appoint a
prosecutor, and have the indictments drawn -— —
Mr. Keighler, foreman, said the Grand Jury desired
the Court to use its own discretion in the matter;
they would prefer to make no suggestions. Mr.
Pitts—"We object,your Honor, to so long an ad
journment—say until Tuesday—you have time to
make an appointment today." Court—"Then
the prosecutor would have to draw the indictments
on Sunday." Mr. Pifts—"They might be drawn
to day or to night." Mr. Pincknev here re
marked that the presentments were so
vague that it would almost be impossible
for any one to plead upon them.
Mr. i'itls took thesatne view in regard to the pre
sentments. The Court said that if the present
ments could not be pleaded upon, then the prose
cution would fail altogether. Mr. Pitts said they
were ready to traverse the presentments, and go to
trial upon them. After a few further remarks,
the Grand Jury were discharged until Tuesday,
the Court implying that it would appoint a prose
cutor in the case. The Saturday cases were then
called, and the Court asked Mr. Pinknev if
he would decline to try them.—
Mr. Pinkney said they were of quite a different
character from those just under discussion. He
held no office in the Court, and Mr. Whitney had
strictly enjoined him from appearing there as his
doputv. The Court remarked that Mr. Pinkney
was a member of the bar, and he would appoint
him to prosecute the cases. The following then
occupied the Court for the remainder of the day:
William J. Jones compromised an assault upon
Robert Tate, by payment of costs. Christiana
Walton forfeited recognizance. Fined $1 and
costs. James Webster and John Brock
er, cross-action for assaults; compromised
upon payment of costs. j. Elliott
compromised an assault. David Patterson com-
promised an assault, paying costs. Patrick O'-
Mealy, assault on Mrs. Anne Donohue; guilty. Fined
Frederick Sanders, charged with
assaulting Wm. Uaugh, by cutting him under the
eye with a knife, was adjudged guilty. Fined SI and
costs and imprisoned two weeks.——Patrick Lan
alian, charged with assaulting Thomas Roland,
was adjudged not guilty. Lanahan was indicted
for selling liquor on Sunday, and was admitted to
bail in SSOO, Dominick McDevit, bondsman.
Previous to the adjournment of the Court in the
earlv part of the week, several ijidictments were
set down for trial on Saturday. When the regular
cases for Saturday were disposed of. the Court, in
reply to some of "the counsel for the parties in
dicted, said that there was no State's Attorney,
and that Mr. I'inkney, not being sufficiently ac
quainted with the facts in the cases, it might work
to the injury of the State to try them without the
prosecutor being sufficiently acquainted with the
facts. '1 he Court would postpone the cases until
'I uesday. One case against John Showacre, for
malfeasance, in falsely imprisoning a boy named
Charles Dougherty, the Court said it had before
heard the facts on the trial of officer Summers, on
the same charge, and would try it. The evidence
in the case was, that the boy had been arrested on
warrants properly issued, on the charge of throw
ing missiles iu the street. Upon trial three fines
were imposed, and co. so. issued. Officer Sum
mers arrested the boy and he was confined in the
Southern police station until 6 o'clock in the even
ing.when Mr.llambleton, attorney, proceeded there
and assured the squire the fines would be attended
to, and the boy released. Under curia.
After this, Arthur W. Machen, Esq., came into
Court, and Judge Rond remarked that he had sent j
for him to act as the State's Attorney in the prose- 1
cution of two indictments against the State's At- I
torney, Mr. Whitney. Mr. Machen replied that
it was the first intimation he had had of the inten- j
tion of the Court to appoint him to such position. 1
lie thought that such appointment would be incon- >
sistent with the prosecution of his other duties, lie
did not know if he had the power to refuse the ap- j
pointment, if requested to act by the Court, j
and if the Court thought such appiiintment was i
necessary for the public interests. lie would have j
several eases at Towsontown, after the call of the
criminal docket, and had also a case in the Superior '
Court within the call, which would certainly be
tried in a day or two. The Court said it had no i
power to compel a member of the bar to neglect
his own business if he desired to decline for those
reasons. Mr. Machen said it was solely upon
that ground, that he would not desire to undertake i
the prosecution. The Court then remark- i
ed that it would excuse Mr. Machen. I
Joseph Dunn, committed by Justice Hiss, on the
29th of November, for CO days, under the vagrant
act, was before the Court upon writ of habeas cor
pus. John H. lng, Esq., for petitioner. Witnesses
were examined who said that Dunn was a shoe
maker, and supported his family bv his work.
Justice lliss stated that Dunn was" committed on
the oath of officer Bransby, who found him near
Marsh Market with a piece of beef under his coat.
He was charged with the larceny of the beef, and
also with loafing about the market house and being
a vagrant. He (Hiss) dismissed the charge of lai"
ceny and committed him under tile vagrant act, as
he thought that was the best way to dispose of these
petty larceny cases. He had sent several before the
Grand Jury, and that body had dismissed them.
The Court remarked it was the province of the
Grand Jury to investigate such charges, and if
there was no testimony before them, to order the
discharge of the accused party. It was rather an
unusual proceeding for a magistrate, when a party
was charged with larceny, to commit him as a vag
rant; under the same rule if a man was arrested for
burglarv, he could be committed for bigamy.
Office! Barneby testified, that he arrested the man
at o'clock, on the morning of Thanksgiving
day, on suspicion of stealing a piece of bacon, and
tnol htm to tlie station house. He did not make
oath before Squire Hiss that Dunn was a vagrant.
—The Court ordered the discharge ofliunn. Dunn,
then, through his counsel, petitioned the Court
that a warrant issuo against Charles 1). Hiss,
Magistrate, charging him with malfeasance in of
fice, in false imprisoning him, so that the matter
might be sent before the Grand Jury. The
Court said, it would issue no writs until it got a
State's Attorney. The Court adjourned until
Monday (this) morning.
The following are copies of the presentments, as
filed by the Grand Jury, against Mr. Whitney :

A I'AID FIRE DEPARTMENT.— A few years ago the
Fire Department of Baltimore was the worst in the
country—the worst both in its material and its or
ganization. But since it has been made a paid de
partment, and steam engines have supplanted the
old band engines, it has come to be the best. A
gentleman ot this city, now on a visit to Baltimore,
describes its efficiency, in a private letter, thus:
"I was dragged otf somewhat reluctantly to a re
mote corner ot the town, in company with their
chief of the fire department, to bear witness to the
promptness of their paid fire department and steam
engines. I believe no notice had been given, save
a general one that an experiment would be made
this week. Be that as it may, we reached a corner
where there was a small box on a telegraph pole. I
was requested when it was unlocked to turn a dial
five or six times. I did so. In about a minute the
fire bells began to ring , and in five minutes,
by my watch, the first steam engine arrived, steam
up; in one minute more another, and though they
fumbled over the hose, in nine minutes from the
time I turned the dial, were playing a powerful
stream. Some ofthem had a thousand feet of hose
out, and one threw a stream one-and-a quarter inch
in diameter a great height—they said it had gone
as high as two hundred and eighty six feet. Four
or five in all came, drawn by powerful horses. Fire
men and engineers, in tenders and horse-wagons,
active, intelligent and most respectable-looking
men. They have seven engines in all, and about
ninety paid men. I examined the engines, while at
work, with the head man, and their performance
was admirable. One engine, not in the depart
ment, called upon, arrived on the ground in twelve
minutes after being specially telegraphed from a
distance of two miles. It was really admirable. In
about twenty minutes we were deluged with water,
the stream going far above the houses. In zeal to
see everything 1 got a fine ducking, and damaged
essentially my beaver. A. H."
At this time, when the city is deficient in water,
the importance of these steam lire engines, which
would be able to draw water from the rivers, is
particularly obvious. Our whole Fire Department
should be furnished with them as soon as they can
be constructed.—JVL Y. Post.
SAD AFFAIR. —A young lady by the name of Miss
Needles, of Philadelphia, on a visit to Purser Ham
bleton's, in the Hay side, on Thursday morning
last, drowned herself in the river just at "tbe foot of
the garden attached to the premises. The circum
stances, as we have beard them, are: early in tbe
morning the servant girl carried water in the
chamber of the young lady as usual, when she was
lying in bed. YVhen breakfast was ready she was
sent for, but could not.be found. "When the fact
was communicated to the family a general search
about the premises was made, and not finding her,
they repaired to the river, where they saw her
floating, a corpse. She was dressed in her night
clothes, and it is supposed to be a case of somnam

THE RIGHT OF SECESSION—THE OPINION
OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
THE SOUTHERN CAUCUS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9—The Senatorial caucus
yesterday, was attended by nearly all the Senators
from the slaveholding States, from Delaware to
Florida. Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, was absent, not
being in the city. Maryland was represented; and
Vice President Breckinridge was also at the con
ference. lie said that the call did not, contemplate
any action, and certainly none was formally pro
posed. There was, however, a full and free inter
change of opinions, together with gome sugges
tions; among them, one looking to the call of a
Southern Convention, with the view of forming a
ground of conciliation between the two sections of
the country. The best personal feeling prevailed,
but, politically, there were no indications to induce
a hope that the present difficulties will be adjusted.
The caucus adjourned without providing for a i'u.
ture meeting; and the impression was, according to
report left on the minds of the Senators, that at
•east seven States will secede from the Union.
There are, however, gentlemen who believe that
no means should remain unexhausted to effect a set
tlement.
The following amendments to the Constitution
are privately discussed, among others, and are
here given merely as in item of intelligence:
First—Territory may bo acquired by treaty, but
not otherwise.
Second—The white inhabitants of any territory
numbering twenty thousand, shall have the right
to elect' all officers necessary to its Government
under rules prescribed by Congress, and the Legis!
lature thereof may dotermine whether to recog
nize slaver)* or not, during i's territorial existence.
Tbird—Whenever any territory, preparatory to
its admission as a State, having white inhabitants
equal to the number required for a representative
in Congress; and having submitted its Constitution
to a vote of the people, applies for admission, it
shall be admitted into the UnioD, whatever may be
its provisions in regard to slavery, upon an equal
footing with the original States.
Fourth—Congress shall not, in anywise, interfere
with slavery where it exi.sts under sanction of law,
nor shall it prohibit the transportation of slaves
from one slaveholding State to another.
It may be remarked that the above propositions
for an j amendment to the Constitution does not
emanate from a Southern quarter.
Though, politically, prospects are exceedingly
gloomy, there are gentlemen who will endeavor so
to act, as that, excepting the gulf or cotton States*
the others of the Union may remain together,
looking to time and to necessity, to reunite the re
tiring members of the Confederacy on a mutual
satisfactory basis.
RETORTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
CHARLESTON, December 7.—A hill was submitted
on Thursday, in the Legislature, providing holi
days to he observed thereafter in the State on June
2S, the anniversary of the battle of Fort Moultrie*
Good Friday, Christmas, January 1, Thanksgiving
and Fast Days, omitting the Fourth of July.
The election count was finished to-night. Judge
Magrath leads the successful ticket. Messrs. Miles,
lthett and Spratt are also elected. There is great
rejoicing to-night among the friends of the gentle
men elected.
REPORTS FROM OEORGIA.
MACON, December 7.—The disunion feelipg is
still increasing in Georgia. The certainty of the
secession of Alabama and South Carolina will tend
greatly to strengthen the secessionists of this
State. Mr. Cobb, a brother of the Secretary of
the Treasury, speaks here to-night in favor of dis
union.
The Fair of the Cotton Planters' Convention at
this city has been postponed until next Monday,
owing to the delay in the arrival of the goods im
ported direct from Belgium.
The banks in this State have all suspended. Those
in Alabama will suspend next week, by private
agreement. They have pledges from leading se
cessionists to relieve them from the legal penalties
resulting from suspension.
MILLEDQEVIM.E, Ga.,December 7.—Mr. Fulton, of
Columbia, offered resolutions in the House to-day,
requesting the congressmen from Georgia to pro
pose to the Congress of the United States the ap
pointment of Commissioners on the part of the
North and South, whoso duty it shall be to provide
for a peaceable dissolution of the Union, and an
equitable distribution of the property between the
two sections.
Gov. Herschell V. Johnson, in a letter to August
Belmont, Esq., of New York, declares that the
only hope of Saving tho Union depends upon the
repeal of the Personal Liberty Bill bv the non
slaveholding States which have enacted them ; the
faithful execution hereafter of the Fugitive Slave
Law, and the abandonment by the Republican par
ty of the idea of abolishing slavery in the District
of Columbia and other places "over which the
United States hold exclusive jurisdiction. "In
fine," says the Governor, " the Republican party
must let slavery alone." He does not believe that
the cotton States will determine upon final action
until the 4th of March next, and in the meantime
he calls upon the President elect, or some one au
thorized to speak for him, to allay Southern agita
tion by announcing the abandonment of all inten
tions to use the power of Congress against slavery
anywhere. Governor Johnson would personally
prefer to exhaust every means of redress within the
Union before resorting to a disruption of its ties;
but he conceives that the only mode by which the
States can now be held together, is by the North
conceding the principle of non-intervention on the
subject of slavery, and causing to be swept from
the statute books of the several non-slaveholding
States that have passed them,every vestige of the
obnoxious Personal Liberty Bills.
REPORTS EROM TEXAS.
A EW ORLEANS, December 7.— Advices from Texa s
state that Mr. Stewart, member of the Legislature
of Texas, from Gonzales, has issued a circular, in
accordance with the resolutions of a meeting held
in that place, inviting the members of the Legis
lature to be in Austin on the third Monday in De
cember, for the purpose of holding an extra session
> and to take the necessary steps for calling a State
Convention.
Governor Houston promises to resign if the peo
ple of the Slate demand the convoking of the Le
gislature.
The hoisting of Lone Star flags in the towns of
Texas continues to go on, and the people through
out the State appear to be united in their feeling
of resistance to the adminstration of Lincoln.
THE SECESSION FEELING IN FLORIDA.
CHARLESTON, December 6.—Senator Yulee, of
Florida, has written a letter from Washington to
the Legislature of that State, announcing that
upon learning at any time of the determination o f
Florida to dissolve connections with the North
ern States, he will promptly and joyfully return
home to support the banner of the State to which
he owes allegiance.
Col. Blackburn, Federal Marshal for the North
ern District of Florida, is closing up the business
of his office prejihratory to resigning.
The secession feeling in Florida is quite as uni
versal as in South Carolina.
EXTRA SESSION OF THE TENNESSEE LEGISLATURE.
NASHVILLE, Dec. B.— The Governor of this State
has called an extra session of the Legislature to
meet on the 7th of January, for the consideration
of the condition of the country.
HON. J. M. BOTTS ON BECKSSION.
ALEXANDRIA, Dec. B.—Mr. Botts' letter on the
subject of secession is an extraordinary production.
He declares that he will have no part in the wick
edness of secession. He thinks that Virginia wiU
not secede. He says the position ofSouth Carolina
is bald, plain,daring and flat-footed rebellion against,
and treason to, the rest of the.Statos. He thinks
the only question involved in the South Carolina
imbroglio is, whether it is worth while to keep her
in the Union. He believes that the Federal laws
should be enforced in South Carolina, notwith
standing an ordinance of secession. He is gener
ally quite bitter on the secession party.
RIGHT OF A STATE TO SECEDE—OPINION OF THE AT
TORNEY-GENERAL.
The Attorney-General of the United States, as
the legal adviser of the Government, has rendered
an opinion upon the questions involved in case of
disputed jurisdiction and authority between the
Government of the United States and of any State-
He says:
Within their respective spheres of action the Fed
eral Government and the Government of a State
are both of them independent and supreme, but each
is utterly powerless beyond the limits assigned to it
by the Constitution. '* *. will of a State,
whether expressed in its Constitution or laws, can
not, while it remains in the Confederacy, absolve
her people from the duty of obeying the just and
constitutional requirements of tbe Central Govern
ment. Nor can anv act of the Central Govern
ment displace the jurisdiction of a State, because
the laws of the United States are supreme and
binding only so far as they are passed in pursuance
of the Constitution. Ido not say what might be ef
fected by mere revolutionary force. lam speaking
of legal and conititutional right. * * *
The right of the General Government to preserve
itself in its whole constitutional vigor by repelling
a direct and positive aggression upon its property
or its officers cannot be denied. But this is a totally
different thing from an offensive war to punish the
people for the political misdeeds of their State gov
ernment, or to enforce an acknowledgment that the
Government of the United States is supreme. The
States are colleagues of one another, and if some
of them shall conquer the rest and hold them as
subjugated provinces, it would totally destroy the
whole theory upon which they are now connected.
SENATOR CLAY FOR IMMEDIATE SECESSION.
Senator Clay, ol Alabama, has written a letter
in which appears the following: ' "I am for im
mediate secession by separate State action—if we
wait to unite the South, we will wait forever, and
soon wear chains, more galling than those of Ire
land, or Poland, or Hungary. I wish the Govern
or would convene the Legislature, that it may do
everything wanting for our complete defence.
Among other things, it ought to declare all federal
officeholders within the State after the 4th of
March next, outlaws, and subject them to nil the
privations, penalties and pains of outlawry."
AN APOLOUY TO THE PRESIDENT.
The Charleston Mercury of the (Ith inst. says:
It is due to tho President and ourselves to cor
rect an error we committed with respect to him.
We said, in a former editorial, that the President
had voted for the Force Bill. The President, when
that Act passed, was our Ambassador in Russia,
lie, therefore, did not vote for this bill. Ilence, the
views he presents in his Message are in no way in
compatible with any previous act of his political life.
In reading the last annual Message of a President of
the United States to Congress, we cannot forbear the
expression of our sympathy with him, in the diffi
culties which have environed him, as the head of a
great Government dissolving under his administra
tion. Causes beyond his control have driven the
ship of State amidst the breakers, which are now
shaking her to pieces. We sincerely believe that
be has earnestly and truly done his best to avert
the catastrophe of a dissolution of the Union. He
has failed, where we believe no man could have
succeeded. All he can do now, as a magistrate and
a citizen, is to make the dissolution of tho Union
peaceable.
ITEMS FROM THE LETTERS OF THE WASH
INGTO.Y CORRESPONDENTS.
We give the following items from the letters of
the Washington correspondents to the Northern
papers. Wo give the matter for what it is worth :
Although it is constantly denied, there is a ma
jority of the Republicans ready for any compro
mise not involving the loss of the personal self
respect of those who voted for Lincoln, and the
dignity of the Northern States. Tappan. of New
Hampshire; Adams, of Massachusetts: Ferry, of
Connecticut; Howard, of Michigan; TVashburne,
of Wisconsin, and Aldrich, of Minnesota, will be
very strict in insisting upon the dignity of the
North and no sacrifice of Republican principles.—
The conservatives will be in a majority, and will
probably offer a compromise like the following, as
an amendment to the Constitution, reaffirming the
right of the States to regulate their internal insti
tutions ; making stronger provisions for the rendi
tion of fugitive slaves; repealing the present ob
noxious Fugitive law, leaving out such provisions
as an extra fee to the United States Commissioner
in case of conviction, and giving the slave a right
to trial by jury before the United States Courts,
and prohibiting the States from passing laws to o'o
struct the execution of it. A planter from the
interior of South Carolina, who owns a large
number of" slaves, says that such a compromie
would, he thinks, satisfy a majority of his State, if
the leaders and the press would only inform the
people of its provisions and tho true state of af
fairs.
Another compromise has been suggested by an
amendment of the Constitution providing for
two counselors, to be chosen by the North and
South respectively, both of whose signatures shall
be necessary to all measures of legislation, in addi
tion to til At of the J'resident.
The purpose of the Select Committee on the State
of the Union seems to be misconceived, and Speaker
Pennington is denounced for not appointing repre
sentative men, who could control their respective
parties. The members of the Committee are merely
spokesmen for their delegations, and will act under
and by their advice. Mr. Humphrey would hardly
undertake to say what the State of New York
would be willing to do in this great settlement. —
His delegation will meet and agree upon a proposi
tion which Mr. Humphrey shall present for New
York, and so with all the States. If the Committee
then agree upon and report a settlement, it will not
only receive the approval of Congress, but it will
probably he approved by the country. The con
servative complexion of the Committee was de
signed to secure delay in State action. The Com
mittee give much better satisfaction than at first-
No notice calling it together has yet been given.
Only Boyee, of South Carolina, and Hawkins, of
Florida, wiil resign on the Committee. Davis, of
Mississippi, Love, of Georgia, and Houston, of Ala
bama, will serve, although great efforts have been
made by people from their States to induce them
to resign. They are willing to accept a compro
mise, and will do all in their power to save the
Union.
Mr. Powell's resolution, offered in the Senate
yesterday, and which lies over under the rules,
will be somewhat modified by the Southern Sena
tors, and will be supported by several New Eng
land Senators, as well as Senators from the North
West, without their committing-themselves to ani
line of policy, on the ground that the resolution is
simply one of inquiry, and can do no harm, and
may do a great deal of good. The Southern Union
men greatly desire the passage of such a resolu
tion; the Northern men will not object.
Senator Latham gives it as his opinion that there
would not be five hundred men in California favor
able to a Pacific Republic, and that California will
go with the Northern States. Several of the Alis
souri delegation claim that their State will decline
uniting with either section, and will establish ati
Empire west of the Mississippi, to absorb eventually
all the territories. Hon. George Briggs and others
give out the idea that New York will declare her
independence, and set up as a free citv, and still
control the Southern trade.
The Committee on Ways and Means will meet
to morrow to consider what form and what manner
of relief shall be meted. The first question will
be whether to convert the 311,000,000 of uncancel
ed loan into Treasury Notes and to give the Secre
tary the 810,000,000 additional, as asked in his re
port, or to make a thorough investigation ot the
Treasury, and provide at once for its full wants.
President lSuchanan yesterday announced to a
gentleman of high standing that he would collect
the revenues at all hazards, if any Southern seced
ing State attempted to assume the power of the
Federal Government in this respect. Hecomplained
bitterly of the ingratitude of South Carolina in
rushing out of the Union, but avowed his determi
nation to obey the laws. When asked if he would
use force, be answered, "I will obey the laws. I
am no warrior— l am a man of peace—but I will
obey the laws."
The violent speeches of Senators lverson and
Clingman are variously accounted for. The faot
that their re-election is somewhat doubtful, or de
pendent upon circumstances connected with the
disunion enterprise, and. their accordance with the
frenzy of the hour, is accepted in the way of an
explanation by not a few.
The House committee will report the loan bill on
Monday, and its passage in both chambers the same
day is probable. The necessities of the members
are urgent—so urgent that some have been forced
to sell their certificates of indebtedness to relieve
their immediate wants.
Mr. Seward will address the Supreme Court on
Monday in the Newark Bridge case, which has en
listed some of the ablest talent in the country.
Senators Latham and Gwin both assert that under
no circumstances will California leave the Union.—
The Pacific Railroad is a great conservative ele
ment on the Pacific border.
Mr. Slidell, Senator from Louisiana, is openly
for secession, but concedes that if his State goes
out the fee navigation ot the Mississippi shall be
secured to all the States of the present Union.
Such of the Disunionists as will remain on the
House Committee of Thirty-three will state their
demands, and if voted down will retire. Hon.
Reuben Davis, of Mississippi, is at the head of the
scheme.
It is reliably ascertained that many Republicans
stand ready to do anything reasonable to allay the
excitement, in the way of concession and com
promise.
All parties are in despair. The treasury is
empty, and great distress is the consequence. No
money is paid out to the public officers, and the
members of Congress who arrived yesterday and
to-day get no pay.
Those who have no faith in the nouse Committee,
look to the Senate for that desired action which
shall preserve the Union as it did ten years ago.
Lord Lyons has written to England, giving a full
statement of affairs in this country, but not official
ly to bis Government.
All the leading hotels have unfurled the stars and
stripes. Two religious fairs are going on, and the
Union feeling is very strongly manifested.
Secretary Cass is urged by his friends to give
the public his views on the present crisis.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. —This document so
anxiously expected, is to-day spread before our
readers. It is an able State paper, exhibiting Mr.
Buchanan's usual perspicuity of statement, in
genuity in abstract political discussion, and fine
propriety of style that characterize all his official
communications. The view presented of our rela
tions with the European powers, is highly satisfac
tory, but our diplomacy as relates to the States in
Ibis hemisphere, presents results the very reverse
of this state of things, particularly as xegards
Mexico and some of the other Spanish-American
governments. There is a large portion of the
Message occupied with domestic affairs, especially
in reference to the relative position of South Caro
lina and the Federal Government, in connection
with the Ilight of Secession. As we are at variance
with the opinions expressed, we will take an early
opportunity to discuss that question, with some of
the President's propositions for conciliation. —
Charleston News, Dec. 5.
SAD STATE OF SYRlA. —Letters from Syria present
a sad picture of the condition of affairs in that un
happy country. The Commissioner ot' the Anglo-
American Relief Committee, has been on a visit
through the regions of the late massacre for the
purpose of distributing alms among the Christians
and making inquiry into their condition and wants.
The number of vilages plundered and burnt was 26;
number plundered and not burnt 10; number of
Christians reduced to beggary and want 8,955. —
These outrages were not committed by Druses, but
Moslems, and Mr. Lvons thinks that there was a
widespread conspiracy among tbem and their
allies, the Metawalechs, to root out the Christian
population. The people are now in a state of great
destitution. They have no crops to gather, no seed
to sow, no food to eat. The vast grain country in
Syria remains unsown, and if this continues until
after the rainy season passes, the famine, suffering,
and death in the year to come will be beyond all cal
culation.
THE HOMESTEAD BILL. —The Homestead bill which
passed the House of Representatives on Thursday,
Dec. 5, and is new before the Senate, provides that
any person who is the head of a family, or who has
arrived at the age of 21 years, and is a citizen of
the United States, or who shall have filed his in
tention to become such, as required by the natural
ization laws, shall be entitled to enter, free of cost,
one hundred and sixty acres of unapproprated
public lands, upon which said person may have
tiled a pre emption claim, or which may be subject
to pre-emption, at $1.25 per acre, with the further
provision that, if the pre emptor resides upon and
cultivates the land for five years, it shall become his
or her property, on the payment of ten dollars, and
be entitled to a patent, as in other cases provided
bylaw. If the pre-emption is at $2.50 per acre,
then only eighty acres can be entered under the
ppoyisionß of this law.
The Southern Literary Messenger takes strong
grounds in favor of secession and approves the
course of South Carolina.
EUROPE.
DETAILS BY THE ASIA.
The mails of the Asia, to the 25th, have been re
ceived.
GREAT BRITAIN.
The Arctic exploring yacht Fox had returned
home from the coasts of the Faroe Islands, Iceland
and Greenland, where she has been engaged sur
veying the route of the proposed North Atlantic
telegraph. She succeeded in examining and sound
ing the fiords on the south coast of Greenland, and
proving their practicability for the reception of a
cable. She also coasted down a considerable extent
of the east coast, hitherto supposed to be inaccessi
ble. The severity of the season in the northern re
gions is reported to have been greater this year
than for twenty years past.
FRANCE.
The Monitc.nr publishes a Convention between
the Governments of Sardinia and France, arrang
ing several questions in reverence to the annexa
tion of Savoy and Nice. It is determined that the
portion of the Sardinian debt chargeable to Savoy
and Nice shall be 4,500,000 of Sardinian rentes,
which the French Government will remit to Sar
dinia. The charges incurred by Sardinia on ac
count of Savoy and Nice will be transferred to
France.
The Archbishop of Paris had issued a circular
advocating the collection of "Peter's pence," not

Garibaldi had replied to an address from the
committee of assistance, which, had organized the
expedition to Sicily. He says :
"What you have done for Naples and Sicily, you
must also accomplish for Rome and Venice. Do
not separate; do not leave your undertaking in
complete. The end must be attained. You will
see me ever ready to hasten to the spot where the
standard of Italy and Victor Emmanuel shall be
raised.
The Pieilmontese Parliament is to be convoked
and forthwith dissolved, in order to be replaced by
an Italian parliament. There is a strong party de
sirous of the election of a constituent assembly of
the whole nation, in order to establish the constitu
tion of the new Italian State.
The Pope has allowed the society instituted at
Rome for the collection of Peter's pence to assume
the name and privileges of an arch-brotherhood,
with the power of attaching to itself other socie
ties and brotherhoods established for the same
object.
It is stated that, in a private communication

[ From the Home Journal.]
LEUTZE'S SETTLEMENT OF MARYLAND.
We have had of late years so many pictures de
scriptive of the winter landing on Plymouth rock,
of the austere Pilgrim Fathers, that it was with a
feeling akin to relief we understood, during the
summer, that Leutze was engaged in painting a
picture, illustrative of the founding of the colony of
St. Mary. We heard, from time to time, as tlio
summer tied and the autumn waxed ard waned,
of the progress made on the picture by tie artist.
Every one who bad seen it said it promised ob
his chef d'auvre. We had purposely refrained
from going to satisfy a natural curiosity, by taking
our editorial eyes-worth of this fine picture, until
assured by the painter himself, that it was far ad
vanced toward completion. Satisfied of this, we
turned, one day last week, into the Tenth-street
building, and sought Leutze's studio. We found
both him and the picture within. But, before at
tempting a description of the work, we will jog
our reader's school-day memory by a brief histori
cal account of the subject matter from which the
artist drew his resources.
In 1C32, Cecilius, Lord Baltimore, received a
grant of land from Charles I. of a portion of coun
try situated in the New World, and unclaimed by
any civilized nation. This territory was named, in
honor of the Queen Henrietta Maria". Terra Maria—
Maryland. In the following year J,ord Baltimore
fitted out two vessels, which he named the "Ark"
and the "Dove," and collected a body of two hun
dred emigrants, who were accompanied by two
Jesuit priests, Fathers Andrew White and John
Altham, and commanded by Leonard Calvert,whom
his brother, the Lord Proprietary, had appointed
governor of the colony. This noble band of gen
tlemen sailed from England on the 22d of Novem
ber, and after varipus adventures, reached the Po
tomac, which they explored, and on the 27th of
March, 163-1, disembarked, and with fitting reli
gious solemnities and military eeremonies, the
governor took possession of the place and named
the town St. Maries. This scene the artist com
memorates, and the moment chosen is, when, after
the celebration of high mass by Father White, the
Indians bring forward their gifts—the results of
their skill in hunting, fishing and farming, tender
ing tbem to the settlers, who in exchange present
the natives with gay-colored cloths and articles of
ornament and use.
Here, on the side of a hill that slopes to the
waters of the bay, the colonists and the Indians are
assembled. At the left of the picture, beneath the
early spring foliage of the'forest, is erected an altar,
appropriately draped and ornamented with various
holy symbols, and on which the just used sacramen
tal vessels are placed. A rude cross of wood,
freshly hewn, surmounts the altar. Father White,
intherobe3 of his order, stands upon the upper
step of tho altar, with arms upraised and hands
outspread, as if invoking the blessing of Heaven
upon all present. A little lower, and on one side of
the altar, an attendant swings the sacred censer,
from which the faint smoke of the incense ascends.
In the centre of the picture stand Governor Calvert
and the chief of the Indians, pledging friendship to
each other—several Indian women bearing dishes
of strawberries, cars of maize, and a turtle's shell,
heaped with oysters, are grouped in the foreground.
The colonists, with their wives, of whom, how
ever, but two are introduced into the picture—are
also effectively arranged. The soldiers, though
present, are placed in the background, as this set
tlement was essentially peaceful in its character,
and attained without bloodshed. Between the cir
cle of figures in the immediate foreground, and the
bank of the river, sundry followers, driving cattle
up the hill, are seen. Back of the principal group
a rude flag staff is erected, on which two soldiers
are raising the English and Baltimore flags. On
the various ships lying in the bay in the distance,
a salute is being tired. An oriole, typical of Lord
Baltimore's colors, black and gold, is perched on a
neighboring tree. A noticeable feature of the pic
ture, and what will seem like an anachronism to
many, is a large brick house, partly built, and with
its scaffolding still about it, seen distinctly through
the foliage. This was erected by the colonists as a
precautionary movement before taking formal pos
session of the country, so as to have a secure place
of refuge in case of any disturbance arising with
the savages.
The materials were doubtless brought out in the
ships as ballast, and were employed in the erection
of the first house. Thus we have endeavored to
give an outline description of this masterly produc
tion—which, in correctness ot drawing, in the skil
ful grouping of the figures, in the blending of its
colors and the artistic effects of its lights and shad
ows, render it one of the best pictures yet painted
by this acknowledged master of his art. It is
painted for a wealthy gentleman of New \ ork, who
will in due time receive and bury it, as it were, in
bis gallery. Before, however, it leaves the hands
of the artist, we trust he will exhibit it to the pub
lic, to whom an opportunity of looking upon a more
noble work of art is not often vouchsafed.

HORRID MURDER IN NEW YORK. —On Fridav
morning a horrible murder was discovered to have
been committed at No. 22 East Twelfth street, New
i ork. Mrs. Sarah Shank, a widow ladv, aged
about 50 years, who kept at that number a small
thread and needle store, was found lying upon the
lioor of her sleeping-room, with her throat cut and
her head literally beaten in. She had been seen
about her shop in the morning, her fires had been
lighted, and a littio girl from a neighboring board
bouse had conveyed her breakfast to her about
ByaB ya o clock, making it probable that the murder
was committed about 9 o'clock. Near the body lay
le fragments of a heavy earthen water-pitcher,
with which she had doubtless been assailed in the
t instance. No clue can as yet be found to the
perpetrators.
REV. ROBERT J. BRECKINRIDGE, of Kentucky, has
written a letter on the political condition of the
country, which is worthy of attention. He hits
the causes of the existing troubles with a good deal
of accuracy when he says that "if the North insists
on using the National Government to put down
slavery, or if the South insists on using it to per
petuate and extend slavery,the Union cannot last."
Dr. Breckinridge thinks that if the Union can sur
vive the present crisis, the result will be the tri
umph ol the Democratic party in 1864, probably
under John C. Breckinridge, the whole South and
a portion oi the North uniting in his support. This
is the best result he can foresee. He speaks in the
strongest terms of Mr. B.'s devotion to the Union,
and the false accusations of favoring disunion which
have been brought against him during the canvass.
LIQUORICE GROWING IN TEXAS.— We learn from
the San Antonio Ledger that a Mr. Poinsard, of
that city, has been eminently successful in the cul
ture and acclimation of liquorice root, which he
had imported from France. Of all the plants im
ported, one alone survived. The growth was lux
uriant, notwithstanding the drouth, covering the
ground for a circumference of fifteen feet, proving
that irrigation is not necessary to its successful
growth. Indeed, so successful has Mr. Poinsard
been, both in relation to its acclimature and cul
ture, that he looks forward to the liquorice root
becoming! speedily an article of extensive export
from Western Texas.— N. O. Bulletin.
The Montgomery (Ala.) Mail of the 4th instant,
COMPLIMENT TO THE NIAOARA SUSPENSION BRIDOE.
Mr. I*. W. Barlow, an engineer, having visited
America for the purpose of carefully examining the
construction of the Niagara Railway Suspension
Bridge—the strength and durability of which hare
been greatly questioned by English engineers—has
returned with so high an opinion of bridges of this
kind that he proposes their immediate adoption for
several extraordinary purposes. He proposes to
connect Liverpool \yith Birkenhead by such a
bridge, 105 feet above the level of the river, at an
estimated cost of a million sterling. He likewise
advocates the construction of a suspension girder
viaduct tor the purpose of relieving the street
trallic ol London, and oilers to connect Holborn and
Newgate streets by a level bridge, and thus avoid
Holborn Hill.
CAPTURE or ANOTHER SLAVKR. —Advices from the
Afrifan squadron report the capture of another
slaver with 705 Africans on board. She is called
the bark Cora, and hails from New York, She
was taken about eighty miles off the Congo river,
by the U. S. corvette Constellation, a person calling
himself Loretto Ring, ploclaiming himself her mas
ter. A Spaniard and an American were on
board. Gov. Morgan, of New York, formerly
owned the Cora. The Cora is classed an Aon the
Register, is 431 tons burthern, and was built at Bal
timore in 1851. The Africans were landed at Mon
rovia and the vessel sent to Norfolk in charge of a
prize crew. She has not yet arrived.

at any time become necessary, he shall be author
ized at his discretion to receive into the military
service of the State such bodies of volunteers from
the other slavebolding States as may tender their
services for a term of service such as may to bitn
appear advisable.
FATAL AFFRAY. —At Paducah, Ky., a few days
since, Captain Pigg and Mr. Pry or got into a quar
rel, both drew revolvers and fired; Pigg was killed
on the spot, and l'ryor received a fatal wound. A
son of Pigg, 12 years old, hearing of his father's
death, rustled into the hotel where Pryor had been
carried, revolver in hand, and was just pulling
trigger on Pryor when his hand was arrested by a
bystander.
FREE LABOR FOR FRER HKS— The Fruitt of Repub
licanism.—With the election of Lincoln the Repub
lican party have given practical effect to at least
one of the cardinal points in their creed. Not con
tent with having free farms, they must have free
labor, and they have at last succeeded in obtaining
it; for since the election of Lincoln the supply of
labor has so far exceeded the demand that in New
\ ork city it can be obtained at such slight remu
neration as to render it almost literally free.
A correspondent of the Cnlupibus (Ga.) Time*
concludes a letter to that, journal as follows: —"1
am one of a few who ever dared to think that Re
publicanism was a failure from its inception, and 1
have never shrunk from giving my opinion when it
was worth while. 1 have never wished to see this
Union disrupted, hut if it must be, then 1 raise my
voice for a return to a Constitutional Monarch v."
