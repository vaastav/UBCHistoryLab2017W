with it T That's the question.
The most recent news from Texas is to
ths effeot that our foroes are still operating
along the coast, and will probably confine
their operations to navigable waters.
Our Member, Hon. R. P. Spaulding. we
see by the telegraph dispatches, has offered
a resolution in the House, which was
passed by a vote of eighty-six to sixty-nine,
for the appointment of a Belect Committee
of nine, to consider and report on the sub.
jeet of a National Bankrupt Act. This
bill is a much needed one, and we are glad
that our worthy Representative has taken
the initiatory steps to have a bill reported
and noted upon.
We publish this morning some extracts
from Riehmcnd papers, showing the spirit
in whioh they receive the recent Amnesty
Proclamation. The Examiner and Whig
are in a very alarmed state of mind in
regard to the possible eonsoription of all
able bodied men.
The reports reoelved by telegraph of the
loss of the Ironsides by being entangled
in the obstructions in the Charleston
harbor, and the disabling of two Monitors,
should be taken with great allowance, con
sidering that the news came through reb
1 sources. It is doubtless untrue. .
Bureau of Emancipation.
The bill introduced by Representative
Eliot, of Massachusetts, and referred to
the Belect Committee of which he is Chair
Ban, creates t Bureau of Emancipation in
the War Department, with a Commissioner
en a salary of $1,000 at the head.
To this Bureau all questions touching
freedmen are to be referred, and all re-
tarns of proceedings to be made by mili
tary and civil officers charged with the
execution of laws or orders relating to
freedmen. Ths Commissioner is also
charged with the execution of laws pro
viding for colonization, the delivery of
bonds for compensation for freedmen, and
the establishment of regulations for their
treatment and disposition.

The New York Herald and General Grant.
The New York Herald brings out Qeuer-
.1 (ir-unt a the r!nnnrha1 .ani Uia fn-
President next year. After summing up
his military exploits, rnd comparing them
with those rchieved by Jackson, Harrison
and Taylor, it comes to the comfortable
onolusion that General Grant would
make a capital candidate for the Copper
- heads. Speaking of the General's poli
ticks, it says:
"All that we know is, that his antece
dents are democratic, and that his views
and inclinations are sufficiently conserva
tive that is, Copperhead, for the pur
poses of an independent conservative
Copperhead movement for thj Presi
dency." The Herald always uses the term "con
sertive" in the sense of pro-slavery. A
" conservative is one whose great aim and
' objeet is to continue or preserve slavery.
The word is never applied in any other
sense by the old Satanic. It thinks that
"General Grant is sufGcientlp pro slavery
to suit the purposes of an independent
Copperhead movement for the Presi
dency." General Grant may ask in
maiement what he has done or said that
commends him to the favor of the inde
pendent Copperheads, or their organ, the
Id pro slavery Herald ? His anti-slavery
letter to Hon. E. B. Washburne, most oer
tainly gave the Satanic no warraut for
committing such a libel on him, as to pro
nounce him " sufficient pro slaver to suit
the purposes of the Copperheads."
But we ask, What has become of its
other candidate the " grave-digger of the
f the Chickahominy ?" It brought him
oat nearly two years ago, and has been
furiously running him ever since for the
Presidency. The "Independent Conserv
atives,' nominated him the other day at
Cincinnati, at the instance and request of
that sheet. He thus fairly placed on the
track by its own party as its own pet can
didate Is the Herald going to leave him

WASHINGTON, December 21.
MILITARY CHANGES.
of Governor Dennieon and Secretary
Chase, alluded to some days ago, as well
as with ths wishes of leading radioal
Missourians, General Rosecrans was to
day assigned to oommand the Department
of Missouri, and General Bohofield re-
lieved.
Kansas is erected to a separate Depart
ment, and General Curtis is assigned to its
command, and it is understood that Gener
al Bohofield goes to Baltimore, though this
does not yet seem to be wholly established,
The President has been for some time
convinoed of General Curtis' innooeuca of
the alleged cotton speculations and has
thus taken the first opportunity to g've
him a new command. General Rosecrans
sppointment is proof that the President
did not share in tbe slanderous attacks on
that officer, and that the Secretary of War's
enmity and the malignant persecution at
tempted by one or two of his subordin
ates, had to give way, and if General
Schofield is really appointed to Baltimore
it will be the finishing touch that proves
Mr. linooln the author of the whole ar
THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.
General Butler has been formally as
signed to the duty of exchanging prison
ers, vioe Meredith, relieved. This does
not interfere with the oommand of his De
partment Exchanges, it is now said will
resumed in a few days. The first negro
was exchanged a day or two ago.
CONSCRIPTION BILL AMENDMENTS.
It is pretty certain that the distinction
of classes in the conscription bill will be
abolished before Congress takes a recess
for the holidays, so that the draft, which
comes early in January, may fall not only
upon men under thirty-five, but upon tbe
whole able bodied adult male population
of the country. General Schenck to day
offered such a bill in the House. It was
unanimously approved by the Military
Committee, and the Senate Committee is
also understood to favor it. The House
will resist any attempt to pass further
amendments to the Conscription Law till
after the recess, on the ground that the
bill is imoerfeot now and any hasty at
tempts to patch it ate only likely to make
matters worse. Clergymen arc pretty
certain to be exempted when the amend
ments are made, if the $390 clause is re
pealed, otherwise not.
Statistics have been laid before the Com
mittees showing that one-sixth of those ex
to
empted under the last draft got off for be
ing the only son of a widow. Men worth
great fortunes, whoss widowed mothers
happened to be living with them, were
exempted under it. Tais will be carefully
guarded in contemplated amendments.
A strong movement is likely to be made
this session to consolidate the regulars
and volunteers.
Representations to the Military Commit
tees in both Houses from all parts of the
country seem about equally divided on
the subject of regaining or repealing the
$300 clause.
The statements that have crept into pa-
psrs that Senator Sumner fully endorses
and adopts all the views in the President's
Message are unwarranted. He has of
course, expressed no dissatisfaction, but
he could hardly be expected to give ap so
promptly views of his own either in con
flict with President's or supposed to be so.
MoClurg's Bill for payment of the Mis
souri Home Guards oame np to day from
the Ways and Means Committee, and Blow
suoeeeded against the opposition of Party
Democrats, in getting it made a special
order for to-morrow. "
The Democrat, continue to display a state
of disorganisation sj remarkable, that the
New York World to-night made them a
sharp editorial lecture about it.
The vote on Clay Smith's handsomely
conceived resolutions the other day, split
them fairly in two, and to-day an effort
was made to prevent the payment of any
cf the twenty millions appropriated for
premiums to negroes. ' Prominent Demo
crats voted against the attempt, and for
treating negroes like other soldiers.
THE MOVEMENT AGAINST MR. BLAIR.
The movement attempted to be inaugu
rated through the proposed action of the
House Administration Caucus, against Mr.
Blair, seems likely to fail. The Chairman
of ths Caucus seems unwilling to call it
together, and the members seem to have a
prudent recollection of a similar demon
stration once made against another Cabi
net offioer in another wing of the Capitol.
Some of the members still insist on a meet
ing of the Canons, but it will probably be
smothered.

THE BOUNTY QUESTION.
An interesting debate sprang up in the
House to-day on the bill to apply $20,000,
000 for bounties, 4.C, to soldiers now vol
unteering. Democrats at first opposed it,
Mr. Brooks leading off. Sohenok. Kelly
and Lovejoy made capital little speeches
for our side. Kelly was particularly happy
and called out hearty applause from the
galleries. Cox tried to interrupt him with
authorities against oonscription and was
silenced by a keen retort that bronght

little passage we have yet had this session.

hundred thousand men was insufficient to
meet the wants of the War Department, a
Dounty or to veterans and $300 to
others was offered, and this bill was de.
signed to carry out the pledge thus made.
Nine million dollars had then been re
ceived from commutation, and this was
now augmented to twelve millions.
Mr. Wilson acknowledged the necessity
of exercising great care with regard to the
depletion of the Treasury Department and
to keeping the credit of the Government
intact. It had always been thought nore
uimoutt to omain more money than men.
He wanted the currency of the country to
dc sound, and her credit good, ret we
must keep our pledges made to enlisted
men. Their enlistments were numerous,
not only in the Nothern State, but in the
Southwest, Bast Tennessee had recruited
3,503 men, Texas had furnished two regi
ment, and Arkansas had yielded substan
tial additions to their forces, such recruit
should be dealt with according to promisee.
He was in favor of a commutation clause
for the payment of the bounties proposed.
Harris, did not favor the amendment of
the Committee, as it stood, and thought it
would stop all recruiting after the 6th of
January.
Mr. Lane of Indinia, said we could not
nil our armies with conscripts alone.
There was 8,000,000 men subject to the
draft at this time, and of this number, on
the basis of the last draft, but 426,000
could be brought into the fi;ld, if the entire
enrollment were taken, and out of this
number from 20,000 to 30,000 would be
deserters. Indiana had more than filled
her quota, and could be depended on under
any circumstances to furnish her full
share without resort to the draft.
Mr. Collamer moved to strike ont the
words January uih, and insert till Febru
ary 1st. Los'.
Mr. Howard moved t striks out the
word $15 in th Committee' amendment
and insert $20 aa the bounty for obtaining
enlistments or veterans. Rejected.
After a conversational debate, partioi.
pated in by Messrs. Wilson, Hawes, and
Fessenden, on motion of Mr. Sherman tbe
Senate adjourned.
BATTLE AT FORT GIBSON.
ST. LOUIS, December 21.
Fort Smith, dated the 20th, says :
An attack was made on the outcosts of
rorc umson, also on the fort Itself on the
l.th, by Standwaite s force, slated to bs
1,610 strong, whioh was repulsed, when
Standwaite fell back, taking part of his
fores across the Arkansas bslow Fort Gib
son, moving northeast.
the 6i Missouri cavalry has iust re
turned from a successful reconnoisanoe
southward. They went within fifteen miles
Red River and found the enemy had
ohanged position since last advloes and
they were nnable to proceed further.
Their return was a constant skirmish
for over 100 miles, strong bodies of the en
emy being poeted at all the cross roads to
intercept them. They cut their way
through in some places and evaded other
posts by taking blind mountain passes.
Their loss is trifling.
Among the prisoners captured is the
notorious Handy Lane, who boasts of hav
ing killed over 100 Union citizen with
his own hands.
Information has been received that two-
ingu attack Little Rock,' th ebVUuce"au
tici paling that McNeil's force will be with
drawn away to reinforce Steele, are to fall
Fort 8aiih.
A communication from ths Chootaw
chief, McCurtain, say the Choctaws will
not rejoin Cooper but desire an interview
with McNeil, and says the tribe ar dis
posed for peace.
Our advance headquarter are at W el
do o, fifty-five miles south.
Our troops frequently posh down to
ward Washington, constantly annoying
Prioe s left flank.
FROM NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.
A letter from Bealton Station, Virginia,
the Enquirer says :
I have heard a report, said to b brought
by a contraband who recently left Gor
donsvllle and suoeeeded in escaping to our
lines, that a day or two before he left, a
Louisiana regiment, and also the Jeff.
Davis Legion had arrived there, and that
the rebel authorities are sending to Gen
eral Lee all the troops they ean collect
from various points, with the intention of
making an attack on the Army of the Po
tomac The Philadelphia North American of
this morning says the ram Atlanta, reltled
and put in order, is likely to be only lees
formidable than the Ironside. Th talk
the Navy Yard is that she will go down
Charleston to take the place of the lost
Weehawken. The Atlanta is more like
the Ironside than any of th mon itora.
A letter to the World dated New Or
leans the 22i says :
Up till to-night we have nothing fresh
from ths Rio Grande, but our foroes have
left the Teohe, But a small garrison is
Brashier, this side of the Bay. I do
not know that anything is expected from
Texas just now. Possibly there maybe.
It is reported here that Magruder is at
Columbus, on the Colorado, with a large
force, and that if he enters the interior
hts progress will be disputed. He will
not, in my opinion, leave navigable water
very soon. MoGruder was fully apprised
the intended attack on the Rio Grande,
and rather invited it, with a hope of em
broiling the United States with Francs.
PLOT TO RESCUE THE PRISONERS
AT LOOKOUT.
WASHINGTON, December 21.
The Government, it is said, has received
information of a rebel plot to rescue the
prisoners, now at Point Lookout, under
charge of General Marston, of the New
Hampshire brigade. It ia said, however,
that the prisoners deny all knowledge of
the affair and many of them who are very
comfortably quartered would not join in
insurrection even if an armed force of
rebel made their appearance. Precaution
ary measures have been taken at this
point, and if any such attempt was under
taken it would not tujoeed.
FROM WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON, December 21.
