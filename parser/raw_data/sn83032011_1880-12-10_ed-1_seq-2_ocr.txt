HAYES' MESSAGE.
The last annual message of Mr. Hays Is
now before the public. It is too lengthy to
give in full to our readers. It is dull and
tiresome in reading and full of misstate
ments. In referring to the recent election,
ho speaks of the power of the "House of
Representatives and the Senate." "to judge
of the elections, returns, aud quallficalioua
of their own members, will be to see that ev
ery case of violation of the letter or spirit of
(he Fifteenth Amendment Is thoroughly in
vestigated, and that no benefit from such
violation shall accrue to any person or par
ty." Who could advocate au investigation
better than this man? Unless it should be
his successor, through whose manipulations
the present occupant of the Executive Chair
was seated for four years and drawing the
salary of another. No reference is made to
the intimidation of the whito voter, or the
law to protect the white workingman against
the interference with their right of suffrage
by their employers. Had his constituents
read the message before the late election
would they have endorsed the spirit of it?
In regard to the assessments made upon of
fice holders in order to buy up votes at ele-cv
tions which was carried out to so great an
extent but recently and )u many cases
made so public, he says: "I also recoin
mend such legislation as, while leaving ev
try officer as freeas any other citizen to ex
press his political opinions and to use his
means for their advancement, shall aUo eu
able him, to feel as safe as any . rivate cili
z ill in refusing all demands upon his salary
for political purposes. A law which should
thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all
who are engaged in the public service, and
likewise contain stringent provisions against
the use of official authority to cerce the po-
litical action of private citizens or of ofiicial
subordinates, is greatly to be desired."
His civil service reform is again promi
nent as in his former messages, and ho re
commends thai: "Fixed rules be adopted
for the regulation of appointments, promo
lions aud removals, establishing a uniform
method, leaving exclusively in view, in ev
ery instance, the attainment of the best
qualifications for the position in question,
ftuch a method alone is consistent with the
equal rights of all citizens, aud the most eco
nomical aud efficient administration of the
public business." "lu the city of New
York over two thousand positions iu the
civil service have been subject, in their ap
pointments aud tenure of place, to the ope
ration of published rules for this purpose,
during the past two years. The results of
these practical trials have been very satis
factory w aud have confirmed my opinion in
favor uf this system of selection. All are
subjected to the same tests and the result is
free from prejudice by personal faver or par
tisan influence. It secures for the position
applied lor the best qualifications attainable
among the competing applicants." Mr,
Hayei either has a remorse of con
science at this time or he thinks the Amer
ican people have so far forgotten the wrong
perpetrated four years ago as to hide the
fact that the few who manipulated the pro
ceedings in Louisiana aud Florida were re
warded for making out the written document
by which he was seated, and haw received
silaries in many cases amounting to $7500
yearly. However, if four years of service
has brought this man to conviction on this
one subject a good end Is accomplished,
Speaking of polygamy, he says; "I re
cjiumeiid that Congress provide for the gov
ernment of Utah by a governor and judges,
or by commUsiin4, appuiuted by the Presi
dent and confirmed by the Senate a gov
ernment analagnus to the provisional gov
ernmeut established fur the territory north
west of the Ohio by the ordinance of 1787.
If, however, it is deemed Ust to continue
the existing form of of local government, I
recommend that the right to vote, hold of
fice and sit on juries in the territory of
Utah be confined to those who neither prac
lice nor uphold polygamy."
A great amount of space) is devoted to
making mention of the existing treaties
with other nations and provinces.
As a reword for the "services of the Com
mander-in-chief of our armies duritg the
war" he recommends "Au Act of Congress,
authorizing the appointment of a Captain
general of the artny.wit1) suitable provisions
relating to compei.sition, retirement, aud
other details " Why should General Grant
bs so rewarded, wheu he is but one of the
many nhoaldtd in achieving the vic'ory 7
Washington who gave us our independence
was content to serve his country for tvo
terms aud theu retire. With Grant it was
different. He aloue could not have accom
plished the wotk, but with the assistance of
many others even more deserving than Le
the result was attained,
Wilh this last message Hayes will end hit
career, and the memory of how be attained
the position, and Its results, be banded down
lo generations,

quote the figure) given in tho last annual
message. "Of the principal of the dobt,
$103,75S,100 has has been paid since March

our great law makers shovld begin to re

Hut the democratic majority in congress

should be passed, the tariff revised In the
interest of the whole people rather than for
the benefit of a favored few, the political
assessment bill should become a law.and an
amendment to the constitution abolishing
the cumbrous and worm eaten electoral ma
chinery should be adopted. The democrats
can thus not only do "the state some ser
vice," but make a platform which will give
them congress in 1882 and the presidency
in I8S4 by an overwhelming triumph.

flood, Sound Advice.
Senator Heck, if he is from the "Solid
South," gives some good advice that, If fol
lowed, would Inevitably lead to results cat
culated to benefit the country at large. The
Democrats should do their duty, and leave
the responsibility of any lack of a proper
appreciation of the situation upon tho Re
publicans, should they endeavor this win
ter to block wholesome legislation. These
remarks of Senator Beck can supplement
what we have to say in another place re
specting Congress and its relations to the
people :
"The evident policy of the Democrats at
the approaching session of Congress, which
hasonly seventy or eighty working days, is to
make it strictly a business session, take no
holiday recess, pass all the necessary appro
priation bills, the census bills, aid commerce
ana the carrying trade, if possible impiove
the Mississippi and our great water-ways, to
cheapen transportation and render an extra
session after March 4th unnecessary. If the
Republicans by dilatory or other proceed
ings prevent us from doing so, the responsi
bility for all the evils an extra session will
Inflict upon the business of the country will
be upon them, If we waste time by a long
recess and by dilatory conduct in the first
part of the session and neoessary bills should
then fail, the country will hold us responsi
ble. I think the press t ill do good service
by urging these facts on Democratic mem
bers, as they may arrange their affairs be

DOMESTIC LIFE AMOKG THE MORMONS A
HOUSE DIVIDED AOAINST ITSELF.
The first marriage in a Mormon family is
attended by the same manifestation of af
fection as in other communities. Llvlne
under a system where polygamy is inculca
ted as a divine Institution, where It is con
stantly urged from the pulpit and sur
rounded by the example, It is not strange,
that at the first manifestation of domestic
infelicity the husband should alienate him
self from his wife and seek another compan
ionship for qualities which he imagines will
perfect his happiness. When the blow falls
and the wife finds that another is enthroned
in the husband's affections, who is to have an
Intimate share of his life, she often becomes
broken-hearted, and gncs speedily to tho
grave or drags out a miserable existence
for her children's sake. In a large number
of cases, when tho first wife finds hcrsell
dethroned, she becomes transformed into a
she devil, and resolves to make it hot for
her liege and his unw wife, and as a general
thing succeeds in doing so. The bitter
hatreds and jealousies which exist in these j
families are Indescribable. The children
side with their mother against the father,
while the other wives and their children are
objects of intense aversion. It matters noth
ing that occasionally a man of strong char
acter is able to hold his family in subjection
and compel au apparent true). Kven in pov
erty tho husband is often compelled to sep
arate his wives in bouses widely located,
where in many caso-e they support them
selves and their children. Those possessing
larger resources are alike compelled to erect
distant dwellings, from which the families
watch his attentions and bounty to the
others with bitter animosity. There is an
other class of women who may be termed
religious enthusiasts, and who would be
ranked among the liberal minded women
at the Kast. The.e women endorse vehem
ently the doctrines of their church, and ev
en urge their husbands to take additional
wives. It is this class who get up the peti
tions to congress setting forth the beauties
of their condition aud they are made useful
to influence tha young. The whole teaching
and practlcn nt the Mormon cburoh tends to
thedegradatiou of the women and the brutal
ization of the men. It teaches that no wom
an can be called Into existence In the life
hereafter eicept at her husband's pleasure.
She must, therefcire,exert herself to minister
to his gratification here, that he may not be
offended with her in the next world. It is
also impressed upon her tint In proportion
to heraacrifices in this life the greater will
be her reward iu the next.

Presidential ritfalls.
The President-elect, In a speech which
ws reported In The Ttme) a few days ago,
without meaning It, called attention In a
very forcible way to the dangers that sur
rounded the Presidential electoral system,
Addressing the electors of his own State, he
said .' "Although you and nil the members
of tho Electoral College had an absolute con
stitutional and technical right to vote for
anybody you choose, and tho'igh no written
law directed or suggoted your choice, yet
every American knew that the august sov
ereign of tne republic tho nine millions of
voters on an early day In November had
pronounced the omnipotent fiat of choice,
and that sovereign, assuming as done that
which he had ordered to bo done, e.itertatn
od no doubt that his will would be Implicitly
obeyed by all the colleges in all tho states.
That is the reasin why the people were so
serenely quiet yesterday." As a matter of
sentiment this is all very pretty, but Gen
eral Garfield knows very well that the sys
tern upon which he bestows so much praise
Is wrong, dangerous aud full id' peril. Presi
dential elections ought not to depend upon
the loyalty of politicians. They should be
governed by the strictest and most stringent
statutes that legislators can devlso. The
Presidency of the UnltedStates is the high
est office that man can bestow upon man.
The ruler of England, Empress or Emperor,
the Czar of Russia, the President of the
French Republic, the monarchy of Ger
many or of Austria not one of them all
wields the power he wields. Alexauder can
not remove even a chamberlain of his palace
without consulting bis nobles. Victoria can
not command her own guards without an
Ing the advice of Mr. Disraeli or Mr. Glad
stone. William Is almost tho slave of His
mark. The Pope Is the creature of his Car
dinals. Alfonso, ruling over Arragon and
Castile and Cuba, is the puppet of his prime
Minister. The president of Franco must
bow to Gamhetta. The President of the
United States is alone supreme. Ho cannot
to be sure, declaro war, but war declared he
can postpone almost Indefinately the day of
peace. With a party behind him, a bare
majority of one legislative chamber, he can
call into existence an army of office-holders
almost as large as tho standing army of
Great Britain, lie is the Commander-ln
Chief of the Army nd Navy, of fifty mil
lions of people. He oontrols the disburse
meut of hundreds of millions of dollars an
nually. Tho prizes of life for which men
toil aud strive Generals, Judge, Gover
nors, Cabinet officers, foreign Ministers ere
all at his disposal. Tobceumho is only a
trus'ce, but why should the conferring of so
stupendous a trusteeship be left, as it is left
under the present system, to the chances of
a political lottery, for that is really all that
it is?
Gene ral G irfield has the reputation, nnd
we b-lievo justly, of being a student of our
politics and of our history. There ran be
no doubt that he understands the theory of
our government and of the constitution bet
ter than any man who has set In the execu
tive chair sirce Lincoln and Buchanan, and
we confess that we are surprised and
amazed that in the first public uttrranco he
bus made since the official declaration of his
t hctlou was promulgated he should, parrot
like, rattle ofl" the old, unmeaning, thread'
bare compliments about the honor and the
honesty and the virtues of politicians. Gen
eral Garfield missed a very great opportunity
to direct the public mind and concentrate
public attention upon the one weak link in
tho chain of our constitutional government,
the Electoral College system. As he points
out in the extract we have quoted from bis
speech, the Presidential election really took
pine not in November, hut in December. It
is true that a mxj irity of the people of the
United States declared a month ego that
General Garfield was their choice for prcsi
dent, but if tho Electoral College decided
otherwise a mouth later ; if they should say
that General Hancock or General Grantand
not General Garfield should b prosldent,
there is no power in the constitution or in
congress or iu the courts to revise their de
cision. If they had chosen to defeat the
will of the people as expressed at the polls
aud elect Geueral Garfield's mm servant,
no power could prevent him, if he be a citi
zen, from entering the White House on the
fourth of next March. This is the doctrine
of tlo Cousti'utinti, ft. letter and spirit, ex
presseil in the plainest and most direct
terms. But this is not the only danger of
defeating the popular will lurking in this
constitutional machine for the grinding out
of presidents. A blunder iu a name, the
mistake of a date, the negligence of an of
ficial and a huudrcd other acts of omission
or commission may uuder certain given cir
cumstancs operate as effectually as wilful
criminality to reverse the verdict of the peo
pie. Georgia ! a case In point. Tho char
acteristic perversity that as a rule marks ell
legislation below the line of the Potomac
and the stupidity or obliquity that for some
inscrutable purpose of the Almighty has al
ways distinguished Southern officials make
it exosedingW doubtful whether or not the
vote of that State can be counted next
March. Happily It does not make any dif
ference one way or the other sn far as the
result goes; but suppose fir arguments Bake
the election hinged upon the vote of Geor
gia. In what condition should we find our
selves? It is easy in such a contingency to
picturo the excitement and bewilderment In
which the whole cuuutiy would be plunged.
