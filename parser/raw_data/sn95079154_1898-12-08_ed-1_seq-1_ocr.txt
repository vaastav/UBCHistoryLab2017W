i SUMMARY OF EYENTT OF THE W4R
And Incidents that Have Transpired in
Our Diplomatic Dealings Witn Other
Countries ? Currency Question
Briefly Referred To?Retirement of
Greenbacks Recommended?Increase
of Regular Army Urged.
President McKinley's annual message,
sent to Congress on Monday, is devoted
chiefly to the recent war with Spaiu ami
our relations with foreign countries. The
message begins with the following para?
graph :
"Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war, our peo?
ple rejoice in a very satisfactory and
steadily increasing degree of prosperity,
evidenced by the largest volume of busi?
ness ever recorded. Manufacture has
been productive, ? agricultural pursuits
have yielded abundant returns, labor in
all fields of industry is better rewarded,
revenue legislation passed by the present
Congress has increased the treasury's re?
ceipts to the amount estimated by its au?
thors; the finances of the government
have been successfully administered and
its credit advanced to the first rank; while
its currency has been maintained at the
world's highest standard. Military ser?
vice under a common Hag and for a right?
eous cause has strengthened the national
spirit and served to cement more closely
thari ever the fraternal bonds betweeu
ever5*.M.'ction of the country."
He rehearses the incidents which lead
up to the Spanish American war, tells of
the prompt support given by Congress at
the beginning, quotes the declaration of
war and recounts the most interesting and
important features of the conllict. He
pays high tributes to Dewey, Hobson and
the armies commanded by Shatter and
Merritt. In speaking of the naval battle
at Santiago he says:
BATTLE OF JULY THIRD.
"On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, the third
of July, occurred the decisive naval com?
bat of the war. The Spanish fleet, at?
tempting to leave the harbor, was met by
the American squadron under command
of Commodore Sampson. In less than
three hours all the Spanish ships were de?
stroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk
and the Maria Teresa, Altninraote Oquen
do, Vizcaya and Cristobal Colon driven
ashore. The Spanish admiral and over
1,300 men were taken prisoners, while
the enemy's loss of life was deplorably
large, some 600 perishing. On our side
but one man was killed on the Brook?
lyiV and one man seriously wounded. Al?
though our ships were repeatedly struck,
not one was seriously injured. Where all
bo conspicuously distinguished themselves,
fioui the commanders to the gunners and
the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms,
each and all contributing toward the
achievement of this astounding victory,
for which neither ancient nor modern his?
tory affords a parallel in the completeness
of the event and ihe marvelous dispropor?
tion of casualties, it would be invidious to
aiugle out any for especial honor. De?
served promotion has rewarded the more
conspijuous actors?the nation's pro
foundest gratitude is due to all of these
brave men who by their skill and devo?
tion in a few short hours crushed the sea
power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness and far reaching con?
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can we be unmindful of the achievement
of our builders, mechanics and artisans for
their skill in the construction of our war
Bhips."
The President recommends a military
government for Cuba until there is com?
plex tranquility in the island and a stable
government inaugurated.
With the exception of rupture with
Spain he says the intercourse of the
plated States with the great family of
nations has been marked with cordiality.
The final disposition of the Philippines
is left for future discussion.
Reference is made to the necessity for
the construction of the Nicaragua canal,
and immediate legislation looking to that
end is urged.
Attention is called to the freed of legis?
lation that will aid in expanding the east?
ern trade, and the vast good that will ac?
crue to the country if there is wise legisla?
tion along that line.
Hawaii and its condition as annexed
territory is discussed and recommenda?
tions made for its future government.
The standing appropriations are re?
commended and the necessity of this
country obtaining adequate representa?
tion at the international exhibition of the
Belgians is pointed out.
The unjust restrictions placed on our
cattle and meats by European nations, he
hoped would be modi?ed.
Congress is requested to take action
with a view to the immediate construc?
tion of the Nicaragua canal, which should
be controlled by this government.
Appropriation is asked for a commission
to study the trade conditions of the far
east.
An increase to one million dollars oi
the $650,000 appropriation for the Paris
exposition is recommended.
The restrictions placed by European na?
tions upon various exports are expected
to be modified.
Reciprocity negotiations are being car
r^gd on with several nations, and ar
agreement already having been closed
with France, is being noted as advanta
geous.
Congress is expected to provide a suit
able form of government for Hawaii.
A new extradition treaty with Mexicc
is deemed necessary, as is also amend?
ments to the general treaty of 1S'J7 with
Pern.
Authority i6 asked to initiate negotia?
tions with foreign powers to exempt mari?
time property from seizure and destruc?
tion in time of war.
Attention is called to the mnrked evi?
dence of confidence in the government to
maintain the present gold standard.
Legislation is urgently needed enabling
this government to pay out United States
notes only for gold. Other currency legis?
lation is obviously demanded.
The government should further extend
its policy of subsidizing American built
steamships.
The army should be increased to 100,
0<K) men and a much greater navy should
be provided.
Tiie sales of bonds and the government
aided railways bad been advantageous
and much progress had been made by the
agricultural department. Sugar-fuctories
had doubled in number during the past
two years.
The aiien contract labor law should be
amended and the eight-hour labor ques?
tion was suggested as deceiving of the at?
tention of Congress.
J. C. Wilcox, of Keystone, West, Va.,
haa determined to locate at Tazewell, to

ALL BIG QUESTIONS SETTLED.
Judge Day's Statement After Yester?
day's Meeting.
Paris, December (!.?The Joint Peace
Commission held a long session this after?
noon.
When the commissioners emerged from
the Foreign Office, Judge Day, President
of the American commission, announced
that all the big questions bad been settled,
and that the treaty would be signed in
three or four days. The work remaining
consists largely in drafting into language
the conclusions reached.
It has developed that yesterday's ses?
sion was of far greater importance than
generally supposed. It resulted in the
Americans uncompromisingly rejecting
Spain's request that for a term of years
the ships of that country and its products
be admitted to Cuban and Porto Rican
ports under the same regulations and cus?
toms tariff as American ships and pro?
ducts.
The Spanish commission for some days
has been playing for time. The Americans
were anxious for a decision on the ques
tion of a coaling station in the Caroline
Islands, religioue tolerance in the Carolines
and the release of prisoners. The Span?
iards were unwilling to answer these
points until they heard what the Ameri?
cans proposed to do for the industries which
had been built up by the Cuban and Porto
Rican trade.
This is why Spain contended that the
articles of the treaty should be disposed
of in this order, while tho Americans
wauted to first settie their pressing needs.
The session of yesterday was practically
a fight on the order of procedure. Finaliy
the Americans yielded, and then the Span?
iards proposed their shipping aud com?
mercial question, which the Americans re?
jected in its entirety.
The session then adjourned with neither
side in an i specially amiable frame o!
min J.
It is learned that there were differences
of opinion among the Americans on the
shipping question, aud numerous tcic
irran.s were exchanged with Washington.
Finally, the American commission was in?
structed to refuse, the principal reason I e
ing that Porto Rico is about to be declared
within the coast line of the United States,
while, as regards Cuba, the authorities at
Washington would make no promises, i s
the American occupation there is not fixed
and the future Cuban government must
make its own treaties.
THE TREATY ASSCUKP.
Pari?, December 0.?The Peace of Paris
is practically an accomplished fact. To?
day's session disposed of the essential
features of the treaty, which will be em?
bodied in the following eight articles :
First?The customary preface of trea?
ties in the nature of an expression of
amity and of hope for perpetual peace.
Second?The relinquishuieut by Spain
of her sovereignty over Cuba.
Third?The withdrawal of the Spanish
troops.
Fourth?The relinquishment by Spain
of her sovereignty over Porto Rico.
Fifth?Spain's cession of the Philip?
pines.
Sixth?The withdrawal of the Spanish
troops there.
Seventh?Payment by the United
States of $20,000,000 for the Philippines.
Kight?The ,-provision lor the "open
door" commercial policy in the Philip?
pines.
Tire rough draft of the treaty, which
onay be considerably changed, covers the
proposals. It makes a long document,
which Senator Cushman K. Davis, of the
United States Peace Commission, says,
will be found to be one of the most inter?
esting papers of its character ever written.
So completely are the details of the evac?
uation of the Philippines stipulated, that
a commission such as arranged for the
Spanish withdrawal from the West Indies
will be unnecessary.

McLaurin, of So".th Carolina, and Mr.

thoiilies and commercial organizatians to

that the government should make use of

pose of urging that this be done that the
call was made. The gentlemen were as?

An Entertaining Lecture.
Hon. W. W. Ma6terson, late consul of
Urn United States to Aden, Arabia, on last
Friday night lectured in the Methodist
church at this place. His eubject was In?
dia, Japan, China and hid experiences
around the Word. The audience was a
truly appreciative one but not as large as
the excellent lecture deserved. Those
who failed to attend missed one of the
rarest intellectual feasts that has ever been
spread before the people of Tazewell.
The speaker began his remarks with an ac?
count of his voyage from New York to
Liverpool and carried his hearers with
him on his visits to Chester, London and
Stratford, picturing to them the points of
interest at those places in very attractive
style. He then described his voyage from
Liverpool by wav of Gibralter, across the
Mediterranean Sea, on through the Suez
Canal, over the Red Sea to his destination
at Aden. His remarks on the history of
that acient Arabian city were not only
thrilling but highly instructive, while his
account of the life, habits, manners and
religion of the people who constitute its
population was intensely interesting.
From Aden he traveled to India aud in
brief but truly sublime words treated of
what he had seen in that country and its
past history, he told of his visit to China
and pictured the home life of the Cellqe?
tiale in a way that was new and amusing.
From China he went to Japan, and the
audience was treated to some new ideas
about the character of the people who con?
stitute that ambitious and, as the speaker
cailed them, conceited nation. When Mr.
Masterton left Japan lie travelled to
Hawaii, and remained at lionolula a few
days. His description of that lovely coun?
try, now a possession of the United Statee,
was graphic. He was at lionolula about
the time our soldiers first reached
there and the city was gaily decorated
with the "Stars and Stripes."
Mr. Masterson is a very attractive tu Ik er.
In word-painting he is wonderfully gifted
and he iB well posted in history and jlitera
ture We have never seen an audience more
agreeably entertained than the one which
listened to him on Friday night.
Mr. Masterson, by special request, will
lepeat his lecture at the Presbyterian
church to-night. Those who want to be
nicely entertained should attend.
Knights Templar Meeting.
On Monday night Clinch Valley Com?
mander)-, No. 20, K. T. held ite regular
monthly meeting and the Templar degrees
were conferred upon one candidate. The
occasion was quite an interesting one. At
the conclusion of the work the Sir Knights,
numbering about fourteen, repaired to the
Coffee House and partook of a supper, at
which oysters and other substantial viaiids
were served.
Ouarterly Meeting.
The first quarterly meeting for Tazewell j
Station this year will be held at the Meth?

day. The meeting will be conducted by |
Rev. J. Tyler Frazier, presiding elder.
When your doctor writes you a prescrip?

A relic of the war which is attracting
