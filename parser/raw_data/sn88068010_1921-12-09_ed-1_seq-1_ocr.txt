the association has rendered its deci

CHARITON COUNTY IS
i FIGHTING" TO FRONT
' , . .
""-Th, work of the farm Bureau of
- Chariton county goes on, apace, and,'
-s in a great measure Is due to the in-:
dividual work of Fred a. JBUier 01
Sumner; B. C Smutx, Brunswick; Ed
win Grotjan, Keytesville; C. W., Gar
. hart, Salisbury; Freeman Kinwade
and W. S. Pemberton of Mendon and
RoV W. Hechler of Dalton. These
menshave given their time and energy
absolutely without salary or payment
. of expenses in any way. - ''
The Corn Show at Keytesville is be
ing credited all over the state to the
activity of the Farm Bureau. Every
one knows what a success it was. One
: . of the remarks heard often at the
- show was the great improvement over
the- exhibit which was shown from
' this county three years ago when
Mr. Jordan put on one of the biggest
hows ever held in this state. At this
i time corn was brought to Chariton
County from many states outside of
Missouri. This corn purchased large
ly by Chariton County farmers has
been improving the quality of corn in
: Chariton county the past three, years.
The show which we have just held ha
brought out the fact that the corn
-.. of. the county 'has -been greatly -Im-proved
in quality and no doubt In
yield," p acre y "this effort which
, 'was started and continued during the
past three i years,' Efforts' attained
' largely through Farm Bureau acti-
vity. . ". -; ' ,-''
The breeders bf Duroc Jersey hogs
. living in the vicinity of Mendon and
Sumner held a sale- a week or two
ago anr the quality of the hogs of-
1 ered was exceptionally good. Going
back a little we would like to mention
the fact that these men, purchased
their hogs from the Carroll County
- Breeders during the past three or
- four years. The - Carroll County
' Breeders started holding combination
sales about five or six years ago and
we are glad to report the improve
ment in the quality and development
of the hogs now being offered in the
sales is very far ahead of that of the
bogs which were offered in the first
sale held at Carrollton..
, , '.This is another proof of the value
of Farm Bureau work showing how
. it has extended over a period of years
- both in live stock and corn in Carroll
and Chariton counties. ...
While Chariton County has no home
demonstration agent yet, there are
several communities where the farm
- women are anxious to, help them-
- selves. -: We .have just recently, ar
- ranged for Miss Rocheford of the
' Home Economics Department -; of the
College to spend the week comment
ing November 28th in giving demon
strations in the repair of household
furniture and household equipment
Along the extensive areas of bottom
land near the streams in. Chariton
County -the interest ; in sweet clover
. is beginning to " be shown. Sweet
, clover is especially adapted to sowing
on these areas which some times ov
erflow and just recently the farmers
near Mendon have called my atten-
tion to the fact they wish to sow 80
and 40 acres respectively." This clover
- .will be sowed on wheat in the spring
and then later pastured with cattle if
" it succeeds as they suspect From the

Keytesville Debating Team
Wins Oyer Salisbury Friday
At the Keytesville Hieh School last
Friday night a goodly percentage of
the boosters of the K. H. S. gathered
to listen to the debating, team of the
local school and a team from. Salis
bury high school.
Ihe affair had been advertised and
great interest was taken in the ai-
iair. The subject, was "Resolved
that we have the Closed Shop in
America."
'ine school auditorium was weil
filled and everyone there seemed to be
there lor a purpose of seeing their fa
vorites win this can also be said for
the boosters that accompanied the
team from Salisbury.
Keytesville presented the affirma
tive side of the question, while Salis
bury was lined up on the negative
side.
Keytesville ' was represented by
the ttlisses Dorothy Richardson and
Allie Mae Latham; Salisbury, Miss
Edwards and Francis Brummall.
The crowd gathered early to gain
their favorite points of vantage to be
able to hear,, and at about 8 o'clock
Supt of Schools, C. C. Carlstead made
the customary announcements, read
the rules regulating the debate and
announced the short program which
was to open the festivities,
Miss Jessie Richardson came for
ward and gave a most pleasing violin
solo with an encore which was appre
ciated by all. After .this the de
baters were introduced.
The speeches on both sides were
excellent and for a time it looked as
though the negativeshaa a chance.
One of the judges thought so all the
time, and the final vote was Salis
bury one, Keytesville, tvvv.
The judges were. J. A. Wisdom,
Supt of V ocational Agriculture, of
Chillicothe. Hon. F. C. -lasse, Bruns
wick, and O. F. Revercomb, Supt of
Schools, Fayette. .
After the decision was rendered by
Supt Carlstead, the Keytesville yell

IN REGARD TO MAILING
SUBSCRIPTION STATEMENTS
Our Uncle Sam has laid down a
few laws and rules and regulations in
regard to mailing out papers to de
linquent subscribers. The Courier, in
trying to keep up with these regula
tions, has been mailing put from time
to time statements of account The
response has been. splendid, and we
certainly appreciate the checks and
money orders that are being received
almost daily. Some of these checks
are accompanied by letters stating
that the matter has been entirely
overlooked. Others simply sent in
the check and the statement Still
others write stating that they do not
like to be "dunned," and order us to
discontinue the Courier.
These are things that come up in
the course of any newspaper man's
experience from time to time. They
are expected, and, as all editors are
hardhearted, unfeeling rascals, noth
ing like this "gets in under the hide.'
But there are several things to be
considered from the publisher's stand
point He has his paper stocks to
purchase and the paper houses to
pay for their goods they won't wait
they must have their money when it
' is due. .. j
Then there is the other side of the
proposition that a successful publish
er must consider, and especially the
present editor of the Courier. It Will
be remembered that last July this pa
per was' purchased from the Kellogg
interests. Naturally we wanted .to
find out how many of the subscribers
wanted to continue taking the paper,
and more especially those who were
in arrears. In 99 out of a 100 cases
those in arrears have come across and
are now square with the Courier. In
some instances, however we have been
confronted with receipts here and
showing that the subscription had
been paid, and that the proper credit
on the list has not been given. Then,
too, there were .a certain number of
complimentary papers sent out by the
former editor and these had to be ad
justed and in some cases . banished
from the subscription list
However, the results of our billing
our subscribers has been highly sat
isfactory, and but few have taken of
fence because a statement of account
has been sent ' - -
A statement of account for a news
paper man is as' legitimite as is a
statement from the butcher, the gro
cery man,, the auto dealer, or any
other line of business endeavor. Too
many people imagine that the news
paper game is not a real business to
be run on business principles. No
one has ever satisfactorily answered
this question, but it seems to prevaiL
Why should it? An editor has his
pay roll to meet, rent to pay, stocks
of paper to purchase, and also, he is
supposed to eat and wear clothes just
like other humans. ; . , .
. ' When w sent oi't statements of ac
count on subscription, we do not want
anyone to think they are being im
posed tn or "dunned.".
The sending out of subscription ac
counts is the only way an editor has
audience, and they have some "war
cry," too.
While the judges were summing up
their notes preparatory to casting,
their decisions as to the winners, a
short intermission was filled in by the
pupils of Miss McCann, who, in ad
dition to instructing several classes in
the high school, is the musical di
rector ox the K. H. S. orchestra and
the glee club.
Of course the glee club was all to
the good good singing when well di
rected is a treat, something everyone
enjoys, but the work of the orchestra
was a revelation to all. Then came
the surprise of the evening. Two lit
tle youngsters, only about four and a
halt feet long came forward and ren
dered a violin-cornet solo Joe Heber
Wright, cmetist, and Milton Bennetb
viouuist-lheir efforts at entertaining
were roundly cheered, and in justice
to their instructor, Miss McCann and
to the youngsters, themselves, it must
oe said their work was excellent
This appears to be the first occasion
that the general public nave had this
year to attend doings that pertained
strictly to the work of the Keytesville
High School, and the entertainment
features were thoroughlv enjoyed by
all. It seems that the school is per
forming wonders this year, and citi
zens are hereby notified that all fu
ture performances of the school
should be attended well lust to keep
up with the doings of the youngsters.
Of course, the great thing that in
terested those in attendance was the
debate against the team from Salis
bury. Eevryoae wanted to see the
home team win. But Salisbury ought
not to feel disgraced in heir efforts
to win. They won the decision of one
of the judges and if they are really
looking ioi sympathy they can write
to Moberly for consolation, for last
r-'riday nignt the team from Kirksville
cleaned them up in a three to nothing
decision.
of knowing if the paper is appreciated
enough for the subscriber to want it
another year and, to want it had
enough to pay for it in advance. It
can be stated that 98 per cent of -the
subscribers of the Courier are, at
this time, paid in advance.
The first of the year, we aim to
have a strictly paid-in-advance sub-seVipttoa.tistr-It
is business, and the
is.no reason why the Courier should
not be run on a business basis.
When you get your statement do
not feel hurt or insulted or think you
have been "dunned." It is our way of
knowing if you want the paper for
another year.
That's all, thank you.
RUTHERFORD PLANNING SUIT
, TO TEST BONUS
Judge W. T. Rutherford of St
Louis was in Jefferson City last week
investigating the initiative petitions
filed July, 1920, asking that a consti- .
tutional amendemnt be presented to
the people at the November, 1920,
general election, providing that con-.
stitutional amendments could be voted
on at a special as well as general elec
tions. This is a preliminary step be
fore filing a test suit in the Supreme
Court in the state Soldier Bonus Law.
Before such an amendment was ad
opted ' constitutional amendments
could be voted upon onlv at general
elections.
. Judge Rutherford's investivation
was authorized by the Fnnd Commis
sion, since the bonus amendment was
voted upon at a special election and"
much of its validity depends upon the
initiative petitions.
The points involved in the investiga
tion to determine w aether or not the
iniative petitions ae within the law
include the number of individuals
signing the petitions, whether such
signers were legal voters and whether
or not the amendments were printed
as required by law. Under the consti
tution, constitutional amendments
must be published at least once a
week in a newspaper in each county
of the state, for four consecutive
weeks preceding the election.
UNUSUAL DAMAGE SUIT

ployed by one of the prominent far
mers near Salisbury is about to com
