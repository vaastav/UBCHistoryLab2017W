Mexico is goit.g to Usuc t20,0ou.
000 more silver bonds and Europe,
capital i- hungry to get them.
The Lyons Kafele exclaims, af:tr
reading the president's message,
wonder why he didn't want posu
stamps redeemable in g.iM.
Republicans are great on "the la
supply and demand" It will work o
every ;hing but silrer. Whcnev;r
strikes silver it slip a cog.
The actual factory cost of the tw
most prominent type writers is )e

The price is held up by the trust.
Says the Washington News Letter
(Ind.): There is a member of th
Kansas legislature who has the nerv
to charge that Jerry Simpson ha
become a representative ot th
hated railroad corporations. He i
evidently a warm member.
It sounds extremely tunny to hear
Secretary Gage and President Mc
Kinley talking of the demand fo
gold bearing bonds in order to
strengthen the public credit. What
is the matter with the nation's
credit? Did it ever default on any
of its obligations?
The street car company of Indian
apolis can continue to collect 5 cert
fares. They paid Ex President
Harrison a $25,000 attorney fee to
present their case 10 the court. The
United States court of appeals have
just handed down a decision con
firming the lower court. Corpora
tions can generally get what thy
want from the court of last resort
if they have money enough.
Silver has advanctd nu.e cents an
ounce since September. The strength
of the market is ascribed to a large
silver shipment Irom London to
Russia "which country has been for
some lime past at work putting her
currency on a metalic basis." It
would imperil the credit of the United
States to put our currency on that
sort of a metalic basis; and of course
the increased demaud for silver
would not affect its price!
Senator Young, ot Independence
than w hom no man in the state stands
higher, says m his Star and Katisan
last week:
The attack made upon Senator Har
ris by Uepresentative VV. F. Brown of
tbu Kansas legislature, is unfounded
and uuw,trrdtiied as a statement of
the fuels id regard to the railroad hill
he luuoduced in the state seiate las'
winter will clearly duionsiiaie.
Lick of space prevents niv making
such a statement this week, but in
tne next issue it will receive atten
tion. The associated press report of the
session 'of congress December 9,
starts out thus:
Washington, Dec. 9.-The house
met regularly today got downto serious
work. Jerry Simpson of Kansas as
In his seat for the first time tbk
session and was warmly greeted by
tali) Colleagues.
The arrival of Mr. Simpson seems
to have been of more than ordinary
importance. Jerry is a nonenity (?)
in his district but in Washington he
seems to cut ice.
Cotton manufacturers of Fall
River, Mass., are about to. reduce
the wages of their employes 10 per
cent. The reduction will effect 37,
000 operators. The owners of the
nulls declare that they are forced to
this move in sell-defense. 'Print
clotr.s, they say, are lower than
ever before known and their stocks
on hand are growing all the time.
Oriental competition is the trouble
They 'do business there on a silver
basis which affords them 100 per c:n
protection against our manufac
turers. Jerry Botkin has been interviewed
on the Cuban question and says:
Mr. Botkin Is bitterly opposed to
ine un-American policy or the admin
stration oo the Cuban question which
is lu open and flagrant violation of
the Republican plitform of 1896.
"JTiue months have passed since Mc
Kinley's inauguration," said Mr.
Botkin. "If he has made a single
effort to carry oui either the letter or
spirit of these platform utterances
the country is not apprised of it.

Pne resolution passed the sen!?

l':nies says the 'Ve!" bad the a;-

general. "The ready a.:qu esrrnoe,"
says the dispatch," of the adra:ni
tration senators in this resolution
wirch carries a stinging rebuke be
tween the lines to the president and
attorney general can be better un
derstood whrn the situation is ma.ie
plain. Adminisiration cuckoos like
Mr. Thurston of Nebraska and Mr.
Gj.;r of Iowa, did not ri:)re to oppose
it, ber.ause they knew Mr. Harris ot
K tnsas and Mr. Morgan of Alabama
and half a dozen leading Democrats
were piepared to fore an investi
gation on both ihe Union and Kan
s is Pacific, and this they were not
willing to face. This brought o:t a
sh-irp colloquy between Senators
Hirris and Thurston. In comment
ing on the changed attitude of
Thurston and Gear, Senator Harris
said he was glad to see that 'they
were at last on the right side.
Senator Thurston retorted that he
had a personal interest in the settle
ment of the Union Pacific, and that
Republican prosperity had brought
the government every dollar of its
liens. Quick as a flash," Senator
Harris said that he was ' Sorry the
"prosp rity" of the Union Pacific
was not pronounced enough to ex
tend to the Kansas. Pacific, where
the government was in great danger
of losing J7,00U,000. To this Thurs
ton had nothing to say, and the
incident closed with Senator Harris
head of the game."

A Ave coluiiKi manifesto gppni
rather a larg screed fur o small a

anient with the Lie that ii. produced
the earthquake at Wellington, Trail
and nth-r points on that day. Mr
Biot. ,v. ave regarded as hor.fst, bu
st very small nidn with very iargeambi
tiocsand a very much inflated isti

charged that, t'lrotigh his amoitious
and headstrong operations hecatiseo
tiie defeat of railroad legislation.
That tlii was done by his balk
manner, refusing to co-operate with
others, gaining the 111 will of the sen
ators and getting them ail at crow
purposes, hoping to oush the bill
bearing his name and profit, bv It a
McKinley profited by the McKinlev
bill.
The evident purpose of his mani
festo was to Injure Simpson, bti'
nevertheleps his hardest language
was directed at Senator Harris Hart
he let II rrla alone, he might per
haps have accomplished a little ol
the desired result. The. atnirnlup

man is that he charpe- t hat. Kenatm-
