that accompaniment of activity and < I
greeting that usually attend* the rent•
sembling of congress. liut the uppei
brauch of cougress never puts aside it l
dignity, and the meeting develops I nc
demonstrations of dramatic interest.
The reading of tho president's messagi
was the feature of the proceedings, and
beyond this no attempt was made to
enter upon the business of the Kessio-i.
To many of the foreign represen'as ives
occupying tho diplomatic gallery, the
message had special interest an 1 sig
nificance, owing to the part they had
takon in tho conspicuous foreign events
to which the president referred. On
tiie floor of tho senate print id copies of
the message were distt ibutcd, and these
gave the senators opportunity of read
ing. There was a small attendance
after the reading had proceeded beyond
the first half hour. After the usual
formality of laying the message on the

While tho scenes attending tho oper
iiiK of the house were both brilliant
and interesting iu the crowd* that
thronged the galleries, cnl the con
spicuous personages present, the pro
ceedings themselves were dull and
spiritless, being distinctively routine.
The house met, the chaplain invoked
the divine blessing on the work of the
session, the roll was called, and a com
mittee was appointed to wait upon the
president, and the latter's annual cu
munication was read. The reading
consumed about two hours. Tho holi
day nature of the day was saddened by
the announcement of tho death of ex-
Speaker Crisp, which Turner of (Georgia
formally made to his associates. Out
of respect to the memory of tho distin
guished Georgian, tho house, after
adopting appropriate resolutions, im
mediately adjourned.

THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
Annual Report of the Secre-
tary of Interior.
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS
Hu|[(rili Uovernnient Itetnln PoaiieMlon
of I.amlt of Itmul- A Id*ml Itowli
Uutll Debts are Nettled.
Washington, Deo. 7.—The annual re
port of Secretary of the Interior Francis
was made public today. It deals with
alt the various branches ot the interior
department during the past year, and
makes a number of important reoom
meudations. It proposes a solution ot
the vexed problem of the bond-aided
railroads, deals exhaustively with the
pension administration, reviews the
progress of the Dawes commission ne
gotiations, and touches upon various
matters of especial significance in the
West.
The report opens with a discussion
of the public domain. It shows the
total number of acres disposed of up to
.1 uno 30 last to be 040,000,000. leaving
the public domain still vacant estimat
ed at (>00,000,000, not including tho
district of Alaska, with an area of over
Btf'J,ooo,ooo acres.
Secretary Francis urges upon con
gress the necessity for legislation for
reclamation and disposal of landß with
in the arid regions. Unless the Carey
act could be amended so as to give the
state power to pledge lands for their
reclamation, he says, it would be bet
ter to place the lands under the direc
tion of the states, only so far as may
be necessary to secure their reclamation
for the benefit of aotual settlors.
The total amount paid by the govern
ment on pensions and cott of distribut
ing the same, for the last thirty-ons
years, is $2,034,817,769. The present
number of pensioners,which is 970,078,
is greater by 4,00(5 than in 1893, when
the maximum annual cost was reached,
and is greater than ever before.
This is due to the death of old sol
diers and the continued payment of al
lowano9s to their heirs, while the
amount paid is decreased through the
death of invalid pensioners leaving no
dependents.
Increase from |8 to $13 per mouth
is recommended for all wholly disabled
and destitute Mexican war survivors.
Under the head of Indian affairs,
the secretary repeats the recommenda
tion of his predecessor for a commission
of three, one of whom snail bean army
officer, to take the place of the commis
sioner.
Under the head of bond-aided rail
roads tho secretary says he has com
plied with the joint resolution of June
10, 1890, requiring him to continue the
issue of patents to bona fide purchasers
of lands sold by bond aided railroads,
but says he doclined to issue patents to
all surveyed lands on application of the
Central Pacific. Ho says:
"The representatives of the Central
Pacific further contend that their road
is not in default to the government,
and that if it were, th« lands are not
covered by the government mortgage,
and cannot bo held to secure the same.
I do not agree with either of these
statements. The table presented clear
ly shows the Central Pacific road is in
default to the government.
"In my judgment, it is much better
for this government to accept 11 lump
sum in cash for its claim against tlieso
roads, if by so doing that claim can bo
settled and the connection between tho
government and the only roads it has
ever aided by direct subsidy bo effeot
ually severed. Such a solution of this
vexed question would meet the hearty
approval of the people generally, and
relieve the legislators and all branches
of the government of a troublesome
problem and a trying responsibility."
Death of Major Oigood.
New York, Dec. 7. —A special from
Guimaro, Ca maguey, gives the follow
ing details of the death of Major Dana
Osgood the football player who com

yards from the town, was abandoned
by its defenders, who took refuge in
the town.
On the second day of the seige, Ma
jor Osgood, under heavy fire from the
Spaniards, was training one of his pieces
on the forts. A Mauser ball struok
him in the forehead. He uttered the
word "Well," and, bending forward
on his cannon, hugged it and breathed
his last in behalf of Cuban liberty.
The news of his death deeply impressed

ing officers, all of whom had great re
gard for the American officer.

TOSSED IN THE AIR.
Three Men Wer« Klowft Up With
Dynamite.
Prairie, Wash., Deo. D.—An attempt
was made here last night to blow up
with dynamite three men who were
dleepiug in the same building. The
men were .7. C. and C. L. LaPlant,
owners of a shingle mill, and L. D
Walters, their engineer. About 2
o'clock in tho morning they awoke, to
find themselves being lifted into the
air. A moment later they came down
and went through the floor with the
beds in which they had been sleeping,
and the debris of the building fell en
top of them. The men were partially
stunned, but they pulled themselves
out, and made their wav to a neigh
bor's house, a quarter of a milo dis
tant. The house was completely
wrecked, with its contents, the tim
bers being smashed to kindling wood,
and the bedding torn to shreds. Under
the floor was a large hole in the ground,
caused by the explosion, and the sup
position is that the dynamite wa-l
placed in a bag, poked under the houso
and then fired. It was a miracle tlnn
the men escaped, everything else be.ny
utterly destroyed.

San Francisco, Dec. 9. —The Durrant
murder case came up again in the su
preme court today, on a motion to dis
miss the order of submission made at
Los Angeles several weeks ago. As
was expected, another delay resulted,
the matter going over for two weeks.
It is impossible to foretell when a de
cision in the case will be rendered by
the oourt, inasmuch as the case has not
yet been formally submitted. Mean
while, Durrant is threatened with the
frightful possibility of dying of old
age behind prison bars.
WEEKLY MARKET LETTER.
Downing, Hopkins* & Co.'s Review of
Trade.
Portland, Or., Dec. B.—Those who
have never seen au old-fashioned bull
market are skeptical about buyiug
May around 85 cents, and it requires a
great deal of nerve for the av.erage
operator to play the bull side without
taking moderate profits. There are no
shorts in th« market, and it requires
constant injections of bullish news and
buying to keep prices moving upward.
Wnenever the latter lugs prices yield,
and fluctuations of one to two cents in
an hour are to be expected all the way
up to $1. This has been the coarse of
all bull markets as they become easily
congested aud are made healthier by
good setbacks. Commission houses in
closo touch with the outside public say
that their customers are afraid to buy
wheat in the eightios, as they have al
ways been unloaded upon, and lost
money, and show no disposition to
come in as investors. If wheat goes up
to $l,aud that price is maintained,
speculation may broaden, but for the
present it is a professional market,with
a few of the big traders getting the
bulk of the profits. They find it neoes
nary to sell enough to force down at
times whtn they again take hold aud
an advance occurs. Were they to do
olhervviso the market might get away
from them and there would be no stop
ping the decline. A feature of the
market is the timidity shown by small
holdors, who put stop orders on their
purchases, and are constantly raising
them as prices go up, their desire being
to catch all the profits possible.
Foreign buying, both speculative and
cash, has been light for several weeks,
and although prices have advanced
abroad in sympathy with America,
and while they agree that wo ocoupy
tlio position of price-makers, they bave
bought sufficient to oarry them until
after the first of the year, and are let
ting tho speculators on this side do the
buying Most of the wheat oleared
and tbe largo quantities that are to
clear within tho next thirty days was
bought at lower prices, some of the
wheat that went out last week having
been taken on below sixty cents, and
there is a great deal more of the same
priced stuff to go.
The corn market has been heavy and
inactive during the past weok. Prices
are so low that there is little in selling
short, and on tho other hand there is so
much corn that the average trader hates
to buy it. In oats there was but a
professional scalping market, the range
for the week being about one cent.
Provsions were heavy on heavier re
ceipts of hngs. As a result of the
week's trading pork shows a loss of
about fifty cents per barrel for the
January delivery.

and now Maceo has his army on either

OUR FLAG INSULTED.
<>1«1 Glory Trampled Upon by Tnrklib
Officers.
New York, Dec 7. —A letter from ail
American missionary for nearly twenty
years a resident of Constantinople has
beeu received by Kev. Dr. Strong, sec
retary of the American Evangelical
League, which confirms the recent
statement of Rev. Dr. Cyrus Hamlin
with relation to the status of Ameri
cans and the American flag in Turkey,
especially with regard to the occasion
when the flag was torn and trampled
upon in an Armenian village. The
letter iB dated September !iO, and says:
"The rascally police officer, Hassan
Chaousb, who tore down and destroyed
our flag, wns caught the Sunday follow
ing the massacre, with #1100 upon him,
obtained from the Armenians on his
promise to savo their lives, and whom
he had treacherously given up to death.
Everybody is asking whether Mr. Ter
rill will do anything to vindicate the
honor of our Hag, but as yet we bear ol
nothing boing done."
Another letter from Constantinople
dated September 80, only live days af
ter the occurrence, says:
"Hasseky, the house which Miss
Uleason and Mrs. Seeleve occupied,
was looted and the servant left in
charge doubtless lost his life. Men
wearing uniforms headed the mob
which attacked the houso and pulled
down and tore to shreds the United
States flag that had been hung out."
A DARING HOLD-UP.
Highwaymen Loot thn Office of a Bt.
Louli Brewing Cumpany.
St. Louis, Dec. 7. —Three highway
men, with drawn revolvers, entered
the office of the Home Brewing Com
pany, at 3 o'clock this afternoon, and
held np the cashier, Robert Haver
kamp, forcing nim to hand over |400,
and then, not being satisfied with the
amount, went behind the counter, loot
ed the money drawers and secured from
|500 to $800 additional.
When tbe hold-up occurred, there
were present in the office the cashier,
a half dozen clerks and several custom
ers. Two of the robbers hold the oc
cupants of the office in line while the
other went through the safe and money
drawers.
When the desperadoes had taken all
tho money, they produced ropes and
bound, hand and foot, everyone in the
office This required nearly ton min
utes, and it seems marvelous that they
were not discovered.
Having bound their victims, the rob
bers warned them against making a
noise under pain of instant death.
When the thieves had gone out, one
of the clerks managed to free himself
and then liberated the others. The
police were at once not'.lied by tele
phone.
Upon leaving the office, tbe robbers
mounted a North Broadway car and
went south when they left the car and
went toward the river. The brewery
employes were unable to give the police
good descriptions of the men.
