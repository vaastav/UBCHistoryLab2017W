I For Relief of
Taxpayers
T&e Legislative Committee
Has Practical Recom
mendations
i Columbia, Dec. 5.?Reduction of
the state tax levy by at least one
third is to be the major proposal
of the joint legislative committee
on economy and consolidation, ac
cording to-a statement by the com
mittee today, repoVting on a meet
ing of the committee last week, at
^ tended by Senator Niels Chris
tensen, chairman; Senators F. A.
Miller, and Fred W. Lightsey, and
Representatives E. T. Hughes and
J', E. Anderson. t
* Three methods are to- be used
in affecting this reduction The
first will be to postpone the con
struction of all building operations
for a year. Better organization
and improved operating procedure
in governmental departments, is
the second method proposed. The
third is -to assess for taxation un
der some form of new ta^ legisla
tion property now escaping wholly
or partially their fair share, of rhe
* tax burden. i . f<:
\ The suspension of budding oper
ations would save a half million of
taxes, says the committee.-- Certain
? consolidation of state agencies, bet
ter internal organization of depart
ments and institutions, central pnis
chasing of supplies, imprpvemnets
in state's financial system, better
operating procedure would save the
state another half million, 'it is fig
ured. This saving would not come
in 1922, hut would continue'indefi
nitely in years to^ come. The com
mittee is at. work on plans'for pro
, ducing new state income,, and be
lievers* that *a miUion dollars of
state revenue can be produced by
this method.
^ All -of these points will be cov
ered in recommendations to he
made to the legislature in January.
Statement* of Joint ! Legislative
ConUmiuee on Eeonomy and
Consolidation.
Reduction of "the state tax levy
for. 1522v*y vat least onerthird is to
he the major proposal of the Joint
Legislative Committee on Economy
and Consolidation, according to an
announcement following a two day
? session of the Committee in Colum
bia last week. The meeting was
. attended " by Senator Neils^ Chris
tensen, chairman; Senators F. A.
.? Miller ^nd W. Fred Lightsey, and
Representatives E. T. Hughes and
J. E. Andersont. The only member
absent was Representative John K.
Hamblin, who was unavoidably de
tained by cases in coart.
According to the committee's
statement, three different ? devices
will be used to reduce the state
1 tax levy, from-twelve miUs to eight
mills or less. The first is to post
pone the construction of practical
ly aH building operations for a year.
V-^Ehe .second is to carry on the state
;.' : >g!avemment at smaller cost by
means of better organisation and
' improved operating procedure; The
- third is to raise part of the state's
r?4eney by levies/on those new es
caping wholly or partially their fair
' ? share of the burden. Ail told, ac- I
cording to the committee, the gen
eral property tax can be reduced
over $2,0uO,uOO as compared with
; 1321.
: -\ . . After considerable discussion
the committee came to the conclu
sion that financial conditions in the
state would justify its recommen
dation to the legislature of, de
ferring practicaHy all building op
- erations by state institutions in
1922. Such action would result in
a reduction of the appropriations
"byapproximately half a milhon
. dollars. The committee realizes
that this means merely the de
ferring of. expenditures which in
some cases will have to be made
later. In only a few instances,
however, was the committee able
to. learn of conditions making the
erection of new buildings at once
very desirable and in most cases it
> was thought no gr^at hardship
would result from a postponement
of the building -program for one
year.
\ The principal attention of the
committee wa3 given to the possi
bility of savings through the con
solidation of-?t?te agencies, through
better internal organization in Ce
* partmeuts, through the central
purchasing of supplies, through im
provements in the state's fiscal sys
tem, and through better operating
procedure. After carefully consid
ering conditions "as found in each
' separate department, commission,
board, and institution the commit
tee concluded that the appropria
tions for 1D22 might be decreased
* by another half million in this
manner. In this case the commit
tee points out the savings will not
be for 1922 only but wiU continue
*~ year after year indefinitely. Mem
bers expressed the further opinion ?
that closer financial control ac- i
cording to a plan which will be!
presented to the legislature may be i
expected to prevent any rapid and ;
unreasonable increase in the cost j
of state government during the
prosperous years which the com- j
* mittee believes will in the course of!
time be experienced again ^ in j
South Carolina.
Additional relief should be given j
* hard pressed tax payers, the com- j
mittee believes, through changes in j
the tax system and the committee is j
t_ working on definite proposals to
present to the legislature. These
; proposals will deal both with new
sources of revenue and with means j
of so shifting the tax burden that
it will be more fairly di '?ributed. In j
particular the committee expects to j
recommend the adoption of plans j
I to provide for the raising of at
least a million dollars from those
now, escaping taxation in whole or
^ in parr, with a consequent lessen- '
ing of the levies on those now car
rying ti*e whole load.
Eefore adjourning the commit- ?
m too went over the reports on the
various state agencies made by
Griffen ha gen & Associates. Ltd., of
* Chicago, the industrial engineers
who have conducted the investiga
tions, and decided upon the text of
t
I the report it will make to the leg- j
I islature. This report, which the
I committee expects to put into the
1 hands of members of the general
[ assembly when they convene in<
j January, will consist of two parts.
;fhe first part-will embody the com
I mittee's conclusions and recom
| mendations and its concrete pro
! posals as to savings, improvements
j in the fiscal system, and changes in
j the tax system which will shift part j
[of the burden to those now paying I
! only small amounts or escaping en- |
I tirely. The second part will set j
I forth briefly the committee's find- I
1 ings with regard "to the conditions
in each of the various state agen
cies.

^ South Georgia's Experience.
(News & Courier).
. In devising ways and means for
maintaining our agricultural pros
perity in spite of the boll weevil it
has seemed to The News and Cour
ier that the experience of South
Georgia should be especially help
ful to. South Carolina. They have
had the boll weevil since 1915?-in
considerable numbers since 1916?
and they have learned some/les
sons by which we should be able
to profit in this stat.e The Dillon
Her.ald prints this week' a Very in^
teresting letter from a" former citi
zen of Dillon, Mr. "W. B. Smith, who
has been a resident of South Geor
gia since 1914. He .is a farmer
himself and has been active in
the fight against the boll wfeevil
during much of the time as ^an in
dustrial agent of the G. & F. Rail
way. Mr. Smith says that in South
Georgia it was impossible to get the
people to abandon cotton "until
the pest had eaten them out of
house and home." He has read
about but does not know where to
find anyone who makes money on
cotton in South Georgia now. The
plan .of poisoning the weevils with
calcium arsenate did" not prove
successful in that section, the ex
pense being prohibitive at the
prices which cotton has been
bringing.
When the South Georgia farm
ers were finally, convinced that
cotton was done for, they began to
experiment with tobacco and in
1919 and 1920 planted over 25,000
acres in this crop, establishing
over" a dozen markets and two
stemmeries. Mr. Smith says that
"the acreage of this crop is on the
decline in Georgia and will be
still lees- the coming year." A good
deal has been achieved* in building
>up markets for livestock and es
tablishing a livestock industry. Mr.
Smith believes in the peanut, for!
when the price is too low hogs
can be turned in the fields and fat
tened on them to advantage. Crops
are now fenced in so that stock
can run on the. crops of velvet
beans, peas, cowpeas and peanuts
until Christmas and then be sold.
As for the sweet potato, while a
great many are how planted in j
South Georgia, Hffr. Smith fears:
tha* so large an acreage will be!
planted in a year or two that the;
supply will be greater than the
demand. Ke points out further i
that to sell sweet potatoes to ad
vantage they must be properly
gathered, graded, cured and ship
ped. The. most profitable crop
from a money standpoint in South j
Georgia this year was the water- j
melons, many farmers realizing]
four and five hundred dollars an !
acre on their melons the past sum
mer.
Above everything else Mr. Smith
believes in creameries. He says:
"Creameries have been put in in
some sections and this is the best
paying business I know of. Two
thousand dollars will put the ma
chinery up, and farmers can sell
every day and cream can be ship
ped a distance at a low express rate
by arranging with the express com
pany. I have been informed that
some men who only owned five or
six scrub cows realized over one
hundred dollars per month. Dil
lon is a good location for this indus
try and you won't overdo demand.
You can raise food for cattle, build
up the land, ship or sell the cream
and feed hogs with the milk. This
is the best bet I can refer Dillon
to at present. Of course you must
start on a small scale, but let your
farmers know and let them get
started and this will pay every I
one." ^
Mr. Smith says that in spite of
everything land values in South
Georgia have held up to what they
were before the boll weevil came;
land prices then being low, how
ever. Some people, he says, have
money. "With the coming of the
change and the new industries
come new brains and planning and 1
while some go broke others grow
rich." So it has been in every sec
tion which the boil weevil has in
vaded. Those who hold on and at
tack the situation successfully win
out to a larger prosperity than ever.
Those who fling up their hands in
despair perish. ? -/

Henry Ford's Plan
Illimitable Possibilities in In
dustrial Development South
OfTered in Henry Ford's
Muscle Shoals Proposal
(Manufacturers Record.)
The business genius of Henry !
Ford has been volunteered to
transmute the relatively untouched
natural resources of the south into
gold of solid achievement. The cre
ative genius of Thomas Edison un- j
derwrites the colossal material as- j
sets of the other "high adventurer."
We are not acquainted wich the j
minutiae of detail involved in the j
Ford over for Muscle Shoals. Mr.
Ford has usually been most liber
al in his business offers and has
not been inclined to haggle over a
few dollars. We are, on the other
hand, most intimately advised as to
the repeated efforts of more or less
responsible people, some styling j
themselves experts, to deride and j
belittle the whole Muscle Shoals j
development. The public over and j
over again was given to understand j
that the appropriations for Muscle I
Shoals represented nothing* more |
than a bold raid on the treasury,
that it never could and never should
be made to amount to anything:
that at best it was but junk and i
that the government would be
lucky if it got back any part at all
of ths millions it had expended.
But no sooner did Mr. Ford suggest /
that if the property was worthless
to the government it was worth a
great many millions to him. which
he wa3 prepared to pay, than a
great cry of protest rose to high
heaven. We believe that it will re
quire considerably more logic and
considerably better arithmetic
than have yet appeared to convince j
the people of the United States j
that the government, in any fair- j
ness whatever, either to i;self or to J
the taxpayers, can decline the Ford j
proposal.
It may be argued with power that
it would be of advantage to the
whole United States, and not to the
south only, were Mr. Ford permit
ted to undertake his plans even if
he were not in a position to pay
in cash a single penny for the Mus
cle Shoals property. He is pre
pared to undertake a developme'nt
which is incomparable in its mag
nitude. He plans in millions?not
in millions of dollars but in millions
of men?work for a million men.
He visions an industrial creation i
which would appear to be absurd
were it not for the fact that ac
complishments almost equally
great he has already achieved. If
he is able to get but half of the
million horsepower he hopes to ob
tain and is able, therefore, to give
employment to but half a million
men, still that in itself would be
an achievement to amaze and ed- j
ufcate the world.
Mr. Ford intimates that as a re- j
suit of his operations at Muscle i
Shoals he will be a Die to revolution- j
ize agriculture in the south. He
foreshadows the upbuilding of a
variety of manufacturing enter
prises, including production of
aluminum on a huge scale, and
promises to upbuild in the environs
of the power-development an indus
trial area that, if his plans are car
ried out, would quite obviously rival
any similar area in any other place
on the face of the earth.
Mr. Ford intimates that there is
much he can teach the south, to the
south's great benefit. We do not
ioubt it. He has taught the north
and the industry of the whole
world, many things. His peculiari
ties are various. His ignorance on
some subjects is astounding. But
in the balance scales his eccentri
cities are as nqthing compared
with the things he is able to
achieve. The world is interested in
his merits, hot his demerits.
The future belongs to the south.
It is not remarkable that a man of
Mr. Ford's magnitude has foreseen
it. Power is the open sesame in
modern development. "White coal"
is power. The Southern Power Co.
has just announced that it will be
gin the construction at once of two
great new water-power plants, in
the Carolinas, one at Great Falls,
with a maximum capacity of 60,000
horse power; the other at Mountain
Island on the Catawba River, with
a maximum capacity of 80,000
horse power, Southern rivers, year
round reservoirs of perpetaul pow
er, are being harnessed up, in in
creasing number and volume. The j
example of what has been done,
when accentuated by the enormous
project of Ford at Muscle Shoals,
will not only induce other develop- j
ments in all jfJarts of the south, but !
as with the power of a vast magnet, *
will draw to the south innumerable !
manufacturing plants of all sorts.
The whole south ought to get be
hind Mr. Ford, and Mr. Edison with
him. and assist to the uttermost to
see that he gets Muscle Shoals.
The investment will be worth in- |
comparably more under private '
than under public ownership, and
worth incomparably more under
the Ford direction, we believe, than ;
under any other direction. While
we believe that Mr. Ford is funda
mentally wrong in a number of the
things he <ioes and says, there is
none who can challenge the ac- j
tuality of his achievements. A man ;
who dreams dreams, he has the !
ability and the resources to make
them real. The coming of Ford to j
the south, with the vast enterprise!
he contemplates, would mean in
finitely more in the immediate in- |
dust rial development of the south \
than anything else that can pos- ;
sibly happen. It would be-an even* 1
of world renown, and in its in
fluence on opinion, on faith in the
south and as a stimulus to greater \
effort on the part of all the forces
now working for clevelopinment in
the south, it would exert a power
illimitable.
The south must by all means1
rake advantage of this opportunity.
Clothes may not make a woman,
but lack of them makes her mad. j

Supreme Court Hands
Down Decision!
_ i
J. A. Green, of Charleston'
Must Serve Term For
Manslaughter
Columbia, Dec. 7.?The supreme
court, in an opinion handed down
late Tuesday, dismissed the appeal
of J. A. Green, of Charleston, who
was convicted last year of man
slaughter and sentenced to two
years in the state penitentiary, the
crime for which he was convicted
being the killing of J. YV. Mizelle
by means of a trap gun. set in an
unoccupied house at RIdgcville, in
Dorchester county. .
Mr. Green owned a, house at
Riclgeville, but he lived'in Charles
ton. Depredations had been com
mitted at the house and he set a
trap gun. In Tlahuary, 1020, two

Mizeile went through the house.
The brother heard a cry. "O, Lord,
I'm shot." The trap gun had gone
off and killed Mr. Mizelle. Mr.
Green was given two years and ap- j
pealed. The supreme court decis
ion confirms the verdict of the low
er court.

City Council Meeting
Mayor Jennings To Represent j
Sumter in Greenwood 01? i
Foch Day
A special meeting of Council was
held in the office of the clerk on
the evening of December Gth, there
being present all members of
Council.
In reference to the collection of
sanitary fees, under Section 84 of
the Code of Laws of the City of
Sumter, article (d) reads as fol
lows:
"It shall be the duty of the own
er of any privy or surface closet
in the city of Sumter to pay to the
City Clerk and Treasurer the fol
lowing dues, lo wit: for each can,
one dollar and a half per quarter
or six dollars per annum, payable
quarterly or annually in advance,
and any arrears in the payment of
dues shall be collected in the same
manner as now provided for de
linquent taxes."
A vote was taken. Mayor Jen- j
nings and Councilman McCallum
favoring upholding the provisions
of the Code, while Councilman
Raffield opposed. The clerk was
instructed to issue executions
against all such property owners
who were in arrears in the pay
ment of such dues, and tu'rn same
over to the Sheriff for collection.
Councilman Rainold moved that
Mayor Jennings be named as a del
egate to represent the city of Sum
ter at Greenwood. S. C, on Friday.
December 9th, the day to be known
as "Foch Day" in that city, all
of his expenses to be paid by the
city of Sumter. Councilman Mc
Callum seconded the motion.
Council approved such monthly
bills as were ready for payment,
and after a genera! discussion of
routine matters, adjourned. .

Congress at
Work Again
Regular Session Convened and
Prompt Action Taken on
Some of President's
Recommendations
Washington. Dec. 6.?Launching
of the new session of congress was
completed today with delivery by
President Harding of his opening
address at a joint session of the
senate and house made notable by
the presence of delegates to the
armament limitation conference.
Proposals for a flexible tariff, ad
justable by the president or the
tariff commission for an industrial
tribunal and for a constitutional
amendment to stop the flood of tax :
free securities, were the president's
outstanding statements on domes
tic affairs. Turning to the internat
ional field the president said of the j
armament limitation conference j
that "a most gratifying world ac
complishment is not improbable."
He also urged enactment of the
measure for funding the allied debt,
proposed food relief for starving
Russia, expressed satisfaction over
the nation's being at peace and
held out promise of aid to the
world in war restoration.
A great reception was given the
president by what was said to be
one of the largest audiences ever
jammed into the house chamber.
Demonstrations of a full minute
each occu'-red when he entered at
12:30 o'clock and again when he
concluded at 1:20, the entire aud
ience standing and applauding. Ap
plause also broke into his address
frequently, especially from house
members when he discussed topics
of administration policy and with
especial volume when he advanced
his plan for a tribunal to weigh
disputes between capital and labor
and declared that labor organiza
tions should not be permitted to
"exact unfair terms of employment
or subject the public to actual dis
tress."
The audience, which included the
cabinet, diplomatic corps and many
high officials, besides the foreign
delegates, also responded warmly
when, with manifest feeling, the
president urged aid for starving
peoples of Russia and proposed a
gift of 10,000,000 bushela of corn
and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grain.
Presentation later of more de
tailed views on the shipping situa
tion was promised by the executive
in declaring that he opposed abro- !
gation of commercial treaties pro- \
vided by the Jones act. Such ab- j
rogatiois, he said, would cause;
"chao^." A suggestion fer a plan
of "reimbursement" to ship opera
tors was accepted as an advance
statement of his previously an
nounced views as to ship subsidies.
The president's recommendations
were received by republican leaders
with widespread expressions of ap
proval, although some declared that
one or more of the executive's pro
posals would be difficult if not im
possible of early enactment.
Prompt response came to por
tions of the president's recommen
dations. Immediately after the
joint session the senate passed a
bill, urged by Secretary Hoover of
Uie department of commerce, as
head of the American Relief 'ad
ministratiom authorizing donation
to the administration of surplus
medical and other stores of the
army.
Legislation to meet the presi
dent's recommendations for flex
ible tariff rates also was proposed
imediately by Senator Smoot (Re
publican) of Utah. He introduced
amendments to the pending tariff
bill which would authorize the
president by proclamation to re
duce or increase tariff rates based
upon American valuation. Hear
ings on the tariff bill will be re
sumed tomorrow fcy the serrate fi
nance committee.
In accord with the president's re
quest for prompt action on the
allied debt funding bill the senate
finance committee held two meet
ings today in an effort to get the
bill before the senate immediately.
The president in his message also
emphasized need for agricultural
relief. He urged improved methods
of distribution and marketing of
farm products, advocating legisla
tive assistance to cooperative mar
keting. Railroad freight rates, the
executive added, were subjects of
just complaint by farmers.
Other recommendations of the
president included reclamation and
irrigation development, especially
of Southern swamp lands; high
way improvement and measures to
aid the unemployment situation.
The president expressed satis
faction over the tax revisic n law,
enacted in the closing hours of the
! extra session, and its "billion dollar
: reduction in the tax draft on the
; people." and urging economy and
'? efficiency, declaring the budget
! system "the greatest reformation in
' governmental practices since the
beginning of the republic."
Party responsibility in govern
ment was stressed by the president
in what some of his hearers re
garded as thinly veiled dislike over
the "bloc" development in con
gress.

"Pogo'' Has Arrived.
The "pogo," a modern form of I
the old jumping stick is the latest
ioy that has found favor with Paris
ian children and has already made
its appearance in Xew York City. j
The "pogo" was first found in
use. in a primitive form, among the i
Dyaks of Central Borneo and it
takes its name from their word for j
it. It was a stick with a cross
piece on which favored young men
of the tribe used to perform a cere
monial dance at sacrificial cere
monies. The chiefs of the tribe
took charge of the "pogos" between
sacrifices and they were considered
sacred.
A French traveler on his return
from Dorneo told a manufacturer
Of toys -about*the "pogo." This
manufacturer thought it would go
well as a toy for children, if proper
ly moditied. He made it ?up with
an india rubber pad and a strong
spring underneath the cross-piece.
The rider on the "pogo" holds the
top of the stick, which reaches
about to the hips, in his two hands.
He then hops on t<> the cross piece,
one foot on each side of the stick,
and jumps up and down. The spring
under the cross piece gives impetus
I to his jump and the rubber on tho
; point of the stick makes alighting
I easy on the rider. The expert rider
can jump anywhere from two to
five feet with the aid of the "pogo."
He has the appearance of a kanga
roo hopping over the ground.
Buttons Important.
One clever salesman in the suit
department of a big department
store says he can tell whether a
man is married or a bachelor by
the way he tests the suit or over
coat he is buying. A married man
examines the cloth and asks about
its wearing qualities. A bachelor
tries the buttons. t.> see whether
they are securely fastened or not.
He hates the thought of losing a
button.
About 750,000.000 pencils are
sold in. America yearly, but we can't
learn who buys them.

ihd El Salvador, which .now''make
up the newest American republic,
according to a bulletin from the
Washington, D. C, headquarters of
the National Geographic Society. >
'?This new nation has an area
ipproximately that of Colorado and
i population greater;.than that of
Massachusetts. Its mapped outline
resembles nothing so | much as a
pleigh, wirh the runners on,the Pa
cific Ocean and British Honduras
perched in the driver's seat. Its
surface 'conformation may be com
pared to an A tent, with one side
sloping much mere gradually than

Where Atlantic is North of Pacific
"One's geography1 gets- twisted in
thinking of Central America as be
ing to the south of vs: which is
well enough, if it be remembered
that an east and west line running
through the new republic could
touch Nicaragua and 'Mexico' at
the ends, and that going from the
Atlantic to the Pacific means a
trip due south.
"The ridge pole of the Guatemala
Andes, as the Central American
cordillera sometimes, is-called, lies
much closer to the Pacific than to
the Atlantic. Along'this range vol
canoes go sky rocketing with dis
concerting frequency. They wipe
out cities, at times, as when Guate
mala's "capital was all but destroy
ed five years ago, and Sah Salva
dor has won the nickname xrf 'the
swinging hammock.', i Yet volcanoes
are the friends of these states. They
are veritable gushers' of elements
which, entering into; the soil, have
made the vegetation .luxuriant.

"The sagging side pf our tent
slopes gently toward the Atlantic.
Toward its edge are' the" lowlands
r.'hich Cortez naively described as
'covered * with awfutty miry
swamps.' Scattered tribes of primi
tive Indians and refugee negroes ?
from the West Indies' once eked
out an isolated existence here. Now
the region is blanketed with banana
fields. This crop has bound, the
Caribbean side of Guatemala and
Honduras to the Unif-cd States by
those invisible but -enduring ties,
steamship lines. , . '
"The nickname, 'Guatemala An
des' does hot indicate that these
mountains are a continuation of* the
South American Andes, nor are they
the southern foothills.of. the-- Rocky
Mountains. It has been pointed'
out that should the major conti
nental ranges be extended in their
normal directions they .would pass
each othor, in the latitude of
Guatemala, some 2,000 miles apart.
"What sugar was to Ctth'n durir-g
the second decade of the twentieth
century, coffee was-.to Guatemala
and Salvador during, the Last ' de
cade of the nineteenth. The break
fast beverage of millions of Amer
icans helped erect magnificent pub
lic buildings in Guatemala City, and
San Salvador, and placed pianos,
phonographs, and other 'luxuries in
many a Central American home.
It likewise sent a suddenly increas
ed number of Latin Americans to
colleges and universities of the
United States to -return better

Made Voting Compulsory.
"The constitution of Honduras
does not regard the "ballot ?s a
privilege, but makes: voting com
pulsory upon the male citizen who
ean read and write. If married
he must begin voting at IS; if. un
married at 21. The death penalty
has been abolished. '.- ?,? ?
"Salvador's coast is. wholly on the
Pacific side of the isthmus. Guate
mala and Honduras turned their
faces toward the Pacific, until the
advent of the banana crop, on their
ncr.'hern plains. This simple fact
has had far reaching historical con
sequences. Spain's :'colonial rule
lasted until the first part of the
19th century. After .a short, pe
riod of independent freedom the
five Central American states, Guate
mala. Honduras, Salvador, Nica
ragua and Costa Riea formed the
Republic of the United States-, of
Central America, which dissolved
and gave way to a series of unions,
interventions, occasional revolu
tions all of which constitute an
evolution. Governmentally, as well
as seosraphically. Central America
has faced about toward the Atlan
tic. Its transition stages were dif
ficult because it lacked previous ex
perience in republican forms of
government, and because of mixed
races, for mulattoes abounded in
Honduras and the Indians were
strong numerically lnK Guatemala.
Salvador, like Costa Rica, has ex
perienced less discord! because her
people were more homogeneous.
"Honduras sends to -the United
States many 'Panama hats' while
the so-called 'balsam of Peru' is
! not produced at all in South Amer
ica, but comes from Salvador.
Since plant life is ;*o.abundant and
; various there follows a less plcas
: urable consequence, numerous in
I sects of uncounted varieties. The
bird life also is alluring to the nat
uralist. (Guatemala has the quet
zal, more literally a 'bird of free
dom' than the eagre, since it never
lives after being taken captive.*'
