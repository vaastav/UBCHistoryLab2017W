President's Message.
To the Ramie and limn nf lleprttcnt.itiret :
In coming before, you for tlio fimt time
n Chief Magistrate of thin great Notion,
it is with giatittnlo to the giver of all
good for tho many hum Tits we enjoy.
We arc bk'scl wilh peace nt home, nml
are without entangling alliance abroad.
Tl.oie blesfdngsi nre entitisted to our care,
for safe keeping during th brief period
of ofliee. In a short time we must, each
of us, return to the ranks of the people
who have conferred upon us our honors,
and account to them lor ourstewnrdship.
I earnestly deisii'e I lint neither you nor I
may be condemned by a free and enlight
ened constituency, nor by our own con
sciences. Emerging from ft rebellion of cigantie
inngnitude, aided as it was by the sym
pathy and assistance of foreign nations
with which we. were at peace, eleven
States of the Union wcro four years ago
lefl without a legal State Government; a
national debt had been contracted ;
American commerce was almost driven
from the seas ; the industry of one half
the country had been taken from the con
trol of the capitalist nnd placed where
all labor rightfully belongs, in tl.o keep
ing of the laborer. The work of restor
ing State Governments loyal to the
Union; of protecting and fosting free
labor, and providing means for paying the
interest on the public debt, has received
ample attention from Congress. Al
though your lUbi ts have not met with
the success in all particulars that might
have been desired, yt on the whole they
have been moil successful than could
have reasonably been anticipated. Some
States which passed tho ordinance of
secession have been fully restored to their
place in the Union. Tho eighth, Georgia,
held an election at which the ratified her
constitution, republican in form, elected
a Governor, .Members of Congress, a
State Legislature and all other officers re
quired. Tho Governor was duly installed
aim the .legislature met and performed
all the acts then required of them by the
reconstruction acts of Congress. Subse
quently howoter, in violation of the con
stitution which they had just ratified, bs
since decided by tho Supreme Court of
tho State, they unseated the colored
membeisof tho Legislature, and admitted
to scats members who are disqualified
by the third clause of the 4th amend
ment to the Constitution, an article
which they themselves had contributed
to ratify. Under theso circumstances 1
would submit to you whether it would
not be wise, without delay, to enact
law authorizing the Governor of Georgia
to convene the members oiiginally elect
ed to the Legislature, requiring each mem
ber to take tho oath prescribed by the
reconstruction act, anil none to be ad
milted who are ineligible under the third
clause of the 14th amendment.
Tho frccdnien, under the protection
which they have received, are unking
rapid progress in learning, and no com
plaints are heard of lack of industry on
their part when they receive fair remu
neration for their labor.
The means provided for paying the in
torest on the public debt, ilh all other
expenses of the government are more
than ample. Tho loss of our commerce'
is the only result of the late rebellion
which has nat received sufficient atten
tion from you. To this subject I call
your earnest attention. I will now sug
gest plans by which this object may be
effected, but I will if necessary, make it
tin? subject during tho next session of
Congress.
At the March term, Congress by joint
resolution, authorized the Executive to
order an clcction-in the States of Virgin
ia, Mississippi and Texas, and to submit
to them constitutions which each; previ
ously in Convention, had framed anil sub
mitted, the constitutions, cither entire or
in separate parts, to be voted upon at
the discretion of the Executive. Under
this authority elections were then called
in Virginia, the eloctiou took place on
the Cih of July 1800. Tho Governor
and Lieutenant Governor elected have
been installed. . The Legislature met and
did all required by this resolution and
by all the reconstruction acts of Congress,
aud abstained from all doubtful authority,
I recommend that her Senators and Rep
resentatives and the State bo fully re
stored to its place in tho family of States.
Elections were called in Mississippi
and Texas, to commence on the 30th of
November, 1809, and to last two days in
Mississippi and four days in Texas. Tho
elections have taken place, but the result
is uot known.
It is to be hoped that the acts of the
Legislatures of theso States -when the y
meet, will bo such as to meet your ap
proval and thus close the work of recon
struction. Among tho evils growing out of the
rebellion and not yet referred to, is that
of an irredeemable currency. It is an
evil which I hope will receive your most
earnest attention. It is u duty and ono
of tho highest duties of governments to
secure to the citizens a medium of ex
change, of fixed unvarying value.. This
implies a return to the specio basis, and
no substitute for it can bo devised. It
should be commenced now and reached
at tho earliest practicable moment con
sistent with a fair regard to the- interest
of tho debtor class. Immediate resump
tion, if parcticablo would not bo desira
ble. It would compel tho debtor class to
pay beyond their contracts the premium
on gold at the data of their purchase.
Fluctuation, however, in the paper valuo
of the measures of all values, gold, is
detrimental to tho interest of trade. I
earnestly recommend to you, then, such
legislation as will insure a gradual return
to specie payments. To secure tho latter
I see but one way, and that is to author
ize tho Treasury to redeem its own paper
at a fixed price whenever presented ; to
withhold" lVotu circulation all such cur
rency redeemed until sold again for gold.
With a less burden of taxation than the
citizens have endured for the past six
years, the entire debt can be paid in ten
years, but it Is not desirable that the
people should be taxed to pay it in that
time. . Year by yoar the ability to pay
increases in a rapid xatio, but the burden
of interest should be reduced as rapidly j
a can ne none wiuiout tho lolatioii of
contract.'
Tho public debt i represented in
part by bunds, having from five to twenty
and from ten to forty years to run, bear
ing interest at the rule of six tier cent,
and five per cent respectively. The time
has already expired when a great part
of thetn may bo taken up, nd tho time
is rapidly approaching when all may bp.
It is believed that all which are now due
may bo replaced by bonds bearing rate
of interest not exceeding 4 1-2 per cent.,
nnd ns rapidly as the remainder becomes
due that they may be replaced in a simi
lar way. 'lo accruiplish this it mny be
necessary to authorize the interest to be
paid at cither of the three or four of the
money centers of Europe or by any As
sistant Treasurer of the United Stales,
nt tho option of tho holder of tho bond,
I suggest this subject lor the considera
tion of Congress ; nlso simultaneously
with this the propriety of redeeming our
cmrency ns before suggested, nt its
market value nt iho time the law goes
into elfect, increasing the rate at which
currency will be bought and sold from
day to day or from week to week, at the
same rain of interest as the government
pavs upon iis bonds.
The subjects of tariff and internal tax
ation will necessarily receive your atten
tion. The revenues of the country are
greater than the requirements and may
with safety be reduced, hut as the fund
ing of the debt in fo'.tr and a half per
cents would rcYlucc the annual current
expenses and thus justify n greater re
duction of taxation than 'would be now
expedient, I suggest tho postponement of
I.:. .:n .t.
una ijiiriiiJii till lliu lirxt Uieetlllfr ci
Conrn'esH. It may be advisable to modit'v
taxation and the tariff in instances where
unjust or burd"nsome discriminations are
made. But as to the general revision of
the laws. I recommend, we postpone ihis
subject for tho present. I al.io suggest
tlio renewal pt tlio tax on incomes, but
at a reduced rate, say :i per cent., and
this tax to expire in three years, with
the funding of tlie natioml debt as here
suggested. I foil safe in saying the
taxes nnd revenue from imports may be
reduced rafelj sixty to eighty millions
per annum nt once, and still "further re
duced from year to year ns the resources
of the country nre developed.
Tho report of tho Senetary of the
Treasury shows the receipts of the Gov
ernment for the fiscal year ending June
00, 1809, to be $:J70,94:?,T47, and "the cx
oenditures, including interest, bounties,
&C, to the 321,4UO,597. Tho estimates
fur the ensuing year are more favorable
to tho Government, and will no doubt
show a large decrease of the public debt.
The receipts in the treasury beyond the
expenditures have exceeded th'c amount
necessary lo place to ttie credit of the
sinking fund us provided by law. To
lock up the surplus in the trinsury and
withhold it from circulation would lead
to such contraction of currency as to
cripple trado and seriously affect the
prosperity of the country. "Under these
circumstances, tho Secretary of the
Treasury and myself heartily concurred
in the propriety of using all tho surplus
curiency in the treasury in the purchase
ot Government bonds, thus reducing the
interest bearing debt of the country", and
ot submitting to Congress the question
of the disposition to be, made of tho bonds
so purchased. The bonds now held by
the Treasurer amount to about $75,000,
000, including those belonging to the
sinking fund. I recommend lliut the
whole be placed to tho crcc.il ot the sink

Vour attention is respectfully invited
to the recommendations of the Secretary
of tho Treasury for the creation of the
ofliee of Commissioner ot Customs and
lvcvenue, for the increase of salary ot"
certain classes of officials and the substi
tution ot an increased National Hank
circulation to replace the outstanding
tkree" per cent, certificates, and most es
pecially to his rccomnieuditions for the
repeal of tho laws allowing shares, of

of tho Government or iuloimers.
Tho office of Coin mission-r of Internal
Ilcvenuo is ono of the inott arduous and
responsible under tho Government. It
falls nut little, it any, shoit of a Cabinet
position in its importance and responsi
bility. I would ask for it, therefore, such
legislation as in your judgment will place
tho office on a tooling nf dignity com
mensurate wi'.h its importance, and with
the character and qualifications of tho
class of men required to fill that position
properly. I
As tho United Stales is tho freest of
all nations, so, too, its people sympathize
with all peoplcSStruggling for liberty
nnd self-goverumtjnt. lint while so sym
pathizing, it is dile lo our hoi.or that we
should abstain frpm tuilorciug our views
upon unwilling nluious, and from taking
an interested part "without invitation,"
in tho quarrels between different nations,
or between governments and their sub
jects. Our eourijo should always bo in
conformity with (strict justice aud law,
international and local. Such has been
the policy ot thcLvdministration in deal
ing wilh theso questions.
For more than a year a valuable prov
ince of Spain lias been struggling for in
dc pence and freedom. Our government
and people entertiiiii tho same warm feel
ings and sympathies for the people of
Cuba in iheir pending struggle that they
manifested throughout tho provious
struggles betweei Spain and former col
onies, in behalf of the latter. But the
contest at no timcssumcd the conditions
which Amount to, a war in the sense of
international law, or which would show
the existence ot a de facto political or
ganization of tbo insurgents suflicieut to
justify a recognition of belligeiency.
The principle is maintained, however,
that this nation iitnown judge when to
accord tho rights of belligerency, either
to people struggling to free themselves
from a government ther may believe to
bo oppressive, or to independent nations
at war with ach other. The Uuited
States have no dispositou to iuterfere
with the existing relations of Spain to
her colonial possessions on this continent.
Thcv believe tb3t in due time Spain and
other European power will find their
interest in terminatinn those rtd.it ion
and establishing their present dependen
cies as independent powers members of
tho family of nations. These dependen
cies nre no longer regarded ns subject to
iransicr irmn one h.uropeau power to
anolher. When the lircsi lit relations Of
colonics cease they are to become hide
pciKlcnt powers, exercising the right of
choice and of self-control, in the deter
mination of their future condition and
relation with other powers.

The (jiii siion of die seizure of the hri' Mary
Lowell at one of the I'aliauiu 1-lantU, by Span-i-h
authorilies, U now the subject of corres
pondence between this Government mid lliose
of Spain and Great Jiritain. The Captain

lamation U!ttliori.in: search to be uiadeof ves

was made iiLraiiHt this, whereupon the Cap'ain
General issued n new proclamation iiiuiiin
the rifc'lit of search of Vessels of the United
Slates su far us authorized under the truuty of
17'J".
This proclamation, however, was immedi
ately withdrawn. I have always felt that the
nios't Intimate relations should" In: cultivated
between the Republic of Ihe U. Slates and all
independent nations on this continent, li mny
be well worth considering whether new tn.-ii-lias
between us and 'hem may not be prolita
bly entered into to secure more intimate rela
tions, friendly, commercial and otherwise.
The subject of an inter-oceanic canal lo con
nect the Atlantic and 1'acitic oceans through
tho Isthmus of Marion is one in which com
merce Us interested. Instructions have been
given to our Minister to Colombia to endeavor
to obtain authority for n survey by Ihis Gov
ernment in order to determine the practicabili
ty of such an undertaking, ami a charier for
the right of. way lo build by private enterprise,
such work, if tiii survey proves il lo be prac

the United Slates us to a mixed commission ut
Lima for the adjustment of claims, it became
nectsiiiry lo send a commissioner and secretary
to Lima in August last. No appropriation
having been inaile by Congress for this purpose,
it is now asked that one be made covering the
past and future expenses of the commistion.

A grant has been given to Luropeans of nn

w hich might be used bv Spain in such a way
as to relieve the naval force at Cuba so as lo
operate against Peru, orders were given to pre
vent their departure. No further steps having
been taken by '.he representative of thu Peru
vian government to prevent the departure of
these vessels, tind feeling authorized to detain
the property of a nation w hich w e ureal peace,
on a mere executive order, the matter has
btiea referred to the courts to decide.
The conduct of thv war between Ihe Allies

Towards the close of the List administration
a convention w as signed at London for the set
tlement of all outstanding claims belwccn the
U. Slates nnd Great Britain, which failed to re
ceive tho advice and consent of liio Semite to
its ratification. The time tind the circumstan
ces attending the negotiation of the treaty were
lavorablu to Us acceptance by the people ol
the U. Slates. The provisions were wholly in
adequate for the settlement of the grave w rongs
that had been sustained uy tins government us
as well as by lis citizens. The injuries result
ing lo the U. Slates bv reason ol the course
adopted by Great Britain during our late civil
war, increased the rales of insurance ; in' the
diutuuition of exports and imports and other
obstructions to domestic industry and produc
tion ; is its effect upon the foreign commerce
of the country ; in the increase and transfer to
Great Britain of our commercial marine ; in
the prolongation of Ihe war and increased cost,
both in treasure and in lines of its suppression,
could uot bis adjusted and satisfiad as ordinary
commercial claims which continually nrise be
tween commercial nations.
Aud yel the conventions treulnd them simply
as such ordinary claims, from which they dif
fer more widely in Ihe gravity of their charac
ter than in the magnitude ot their amount.
Great, even, ns is that tlitlVrence, a word was
found in tho treaty and not an inference could
be drawn from il to remove Ihe aensu of un
friendliness of the course of Great Britain in
our struggle for existence, which had so deep
ly and universally impressed itself upon the
people of this country. Believing that a cou
veutiou thus misconceived in its scope and in
adequate in its provisions would not have pro
duced the hearty, cordial settlement of pending
questions w hich alone is cousUtanl wilh tlie
relations which I desire to have established
between Iho U. Stales and Urest Britain, 1
regarded the action of the Senate in the rejec
tion of Ihe treaty to have been w isely taken in
the interest of peace, and a necessary sn-p in
the direction of a perfect and cordial friend
ship between the two countries. A sensitive
people conscious of Iheir power are more at
ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned
than under the restraint of aaettlement which
satisfied neither their ideas of justice nor their
ssnee of tuc grievance they have sustained.
rejection of tlie treuty was followed by a statu
of public feeling on both sides which 1 thought
not favorable to an immediate, attempt at ro
uewed negotiations. I accordingly so instruct
ed the Minister of tho United Slutes to Great
Britain, and found that my view s in this re
.Tiir.l were shared bv Her Majesty's Ministers.
I hope that the time may boou arrive when tlie
two Governments can approach the solution of
this momentous question with au nssurance of
what Is due lo tne riguis, uigiiuy, uuu nuum m

to oppose the establishment of any euch cable.
In consideration of this agreement I directed
the withdrawal of all opposition by the U.S.
millionth s to the landing of the cable and to
the working ot tt Until the meeliiii! ol Congress.
I regret to say that then: 1ms been no mollifi
cation made in the company's concession, nor,
so fur as I can learn, have "they attempted lo
secure one. Their concessions exclude Ihe
capital and tin: citizens of the U. Stales from
competition upon Ihe shores or Fiance. I rec
ommend legislation to protect the rights of
citucii" ot the U. Stales as w ell ns the dL-nity
and sovereignty of the nation against such ail
assumption. 1 shall uUo endeavor to secure,
by negotiation, an abandonment of the princi
ple ol monopolies iu Ihe Ocean Telegiapliie
cable. Copies of this correspondence are here
with furnished.
The unsettled political condition of other
countries, less fortunate than our own, some
times induces Iheir citizens lo come to tlie U.
Stales lor the sole purpose of becoming natur
alized. Having secured Ihis, they returned to
their native country and reside there. With
out disclosing their change of allej dance, thcv
accept oflichil positions of trust "and honor,
winch can only be hchl by cuizens of their
native laud. They journey under passports
describing them us such citizens, and it is only
w hen civil discord, utter, perhaps, years of
quiet, threatens their persuns or their property,
or when Iheir native Slate drafts them into i'ts
military service, that the fact of their allegi
ance is made known. They reside permanent
ly front the U. States; they add nothing to its
revenue.; they avoid Ihe duties of its citizens.
and they only make themselves known by a
claim of protection.
1 have directed the dinlomatic and consular
ofllcers of the U. Slates lo scrutinize carefully
an sucn claims ol protection. J lie citizen ol
the U. States, whether native or adopted, who
discharges his duty lo Ids country, is entitled
to its complete protection, and w hile I have a
voice in the direction of niruirs, I shall not con
sent to imperil the sacred right by conferring
it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants. On
the accession of the present adminislralion, it
was found that Ike Minister to North Germany
made proposition for the negotiialion for "a
Convention for the protection" of passengers,
to which nn response had been given. It was
concluded that, lo be ell'ectual, all the mara
lime powers engaged lu trade, should joiu iu
such a maimer.
Invitations have been extended to the Cabi
nets of London, Paris, Florence. Berlin. Brus
sels, the Hague, Copehugen and Stockholm, to
empower their representatives at Washington
to simultaneously enler into negotiations and
to conclude with the U. Slates conventions
identical in form, making uniform regulations
as to tlie construction of the parts of "the ves
sels lo be devoted to the use of emigrant pas
sengers, us to the quality and quantity of loud,
as to the medical treatment of t tie sick, and as
to the rules to lie observed during the voyage,
iu order to secure ventilation, to promote
health, to prevent intrusion, and to protect the
families, am', providing for the establishment
of tribunals iu the several countries forenlorc
ing such regulations by Nummary process.
Your allcnliou is respectfully "called lo the
law regulating Ihe tarilf on Prussian hemp,

also, tlie necessity of looking to other markets
for the sale of our surplus.
Our neighbors south of us, and China nnd
Japan should receive our special nitenlion.
It will be the endeavor of the Administration
to cultivate such relations w ith ull these n i
Hons ns to entitle us to Iheir coutideuee and
make it their interest us well us ours to estab
lish belter commercial relations.
Through thu agency of n more enlightened
policy than that heretofore pursued toward
China, largely due to the sagacity and efforts
of one of our ow u distinguished citizens, the
w orld is about to commence largely-increased
relations with that populous and hitherto ex
clusive nation. As the United Slates have
been the initiator iu this new policy, so they
should be the most earnest in show ing their
good faith in making il a success. In this con
nection I advise such legislation as will forever
preclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon
our soil under the name of coolies, and ulso
prevent American vessels from encaging in
the transportation of coolies to any country
tolerating thu system. I ulso recommend thai
the mission to China be raised to one of the
first class.
Ou my assuming the responsibility of Chief
Magistrate of the United States, it was with
the conviction t hut three things were essential
to its peace, prosperity, and lullest develop
ment. First umong these is strict integrity in
fulfilling ull our obligations; second, to secure
protection to tlio person and properly of the
citizens of the Uuited States iu each aud every
portion of our common country whenever he
may choose to move, without reference to
original nationality, religiou, color or politics,
demanding of him only obedience to thu laws
and proper respect for the rights of others;
third, union of all the States with equal rights
indestructible by any unconstitutional means.
To secure the first of these Con ur ess has taken
two esseutiul'Sleps : First, in declaring by joint
resolutions that the public debt should be paid,
principal and interest, in coiu ; second, by pro
viding means fur paying. Providing the
menus, however, could not secure the object
desired without a proper administration of the
laws for the collection of the reveuues and
icconoruioaj disbursement of them. To 'this

From the foundation of the Government la
ilio present the management of the original in
habitants of ihis confluent, n. Indians, has
been a subject of embarrassment nlid expense,
nnd hits been n'h nded ilh continuous rob
in rje., murders and wiirs. From my own ex
pfiieiice. upon Ihe frontiers aud In Indian coun
tries I do not ho!, I cither legislation oi the
conduct of the whites, who come most in con
tact w iUi 'lii: Indian, blameless for those hos
tilities. Tiie past, how ever, can not be un
done, mid the question must We met as we now
tind it. I have attempt! d a new policy toward
these wards iff the nation ihiy can not be
regard -d in any other liirht than as wards
witn lair results so fir ns iried. and which I
hope will be attended ultimately with preat
success. The socie ty of Friends is w ell known
ns bavin:: succeeded in living in peace with
the Indians in Ihe em y settlement of Penn
sylvania, while their white neighbors of other
sects in other societies were constantly em
broiled. They are ul.-o know n for their opposi
tion to all Ktrife, violence and war, nnd are
generally noted for their strict Integrity and
fair dealings. Thise considerations induced
me to give the management of a few reserva
tions of Indians to ihem, Hnd to throw the
burden of selection of ngcnls upon tlie society,
itself. '1 he result has proven most satisfactory.
It will be found more fully set forth in the
report of the Cnuimiseioncr'fir Indian Affairs,
For superintendents and Indian ngents not on
reservations otiic -is of ihe- nrmv were i l, f.n..l.
The reasons f ir this rc numerous. When In
dian agents nre sent there troops must be sent
uiv.. i ngtiii uuu uie commander oi troops
are independent of each oilier, and are subject
to orders from different departments of Gov
eminent. The army nflici i holds a oosltlon
lor file; the agent one nt the wjll of the Presi
dent. The former is personally interested il
living in harmony w ilh the Ind inns nnd in tlm
establishment of a permanent peace to the end
that some portion of Ids life may be spent
-.urn .11 minis in civinzeu sections. I lie
latter has no such personal interest. Another
reason is an economic one, and still another,
the bold which the Government has nn a lif
officer to secure a faithful discharge of duties
in carrying out a given policy. The building
of railioads and the access thereby given lo ail
ngrieuiiurui anu mineral regions or the country
is rapidly bringing civ ilized settlements into
contact with ail tribes of Indians. No matter
what ought to be the relations between such
settlements and tlie aborigines, the fact is, they
do not harmonize well, and one or the other
uas to give way in the end.
A system w hich looks to the extermination
of u race is too horrible for a nation to adopt
without entailing upon itself the wrath of all
Christeudom, and engendering in the citizen
a disregard lor human life and the rights! of
others dangerous to society. I see no substi
tute lor such a system, except in placing all
the Indians onlarue reservations us rnni.llr
can be doue, and giving them absolute protec-
tiuu iiieie. .is soon us nicy are ntteu tor It,

this subject I call your snecial ntlention to tlm
reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
1 he report ot the Secretary r War shows
the expenditures nt' the War 'Department for
the year ending the auth of June, 1809, to be
eu,UU.U4 of which J3.ys2.Slu was disburs
ed iu the payment of debts contracted during
uiu war ami not cnargeauie to the current
army expenses. Misestimate of $:M.531,0U4 for
the e.vpeuses of the army for the next fiscal
year is as low as it is believed can be relied on.
The estimates of the Bureau officers have been
cuciully scrutinized and reduced wherever it
lias beeu deemed practicable. If, however, the
condition ot Ihe country should be such by
the beginning of the next fiscal year as to ad
mit of a greater concentration of troops, the
appropriation asked for will not be expended.
The appropriation estimated for river and har
bor improvement and fortification are submit
ted separately. Whatever amount Congress
may deem proper to appropriate for these pur
poses will be expended. The recommendation
of the General of the army that appropria
tions be made for the forts at Boston, Portland.
New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and
Sau Francisco, it for no oilier, is concurred in.
1 also ask your special attention lo the re
commendation of the General commanding
the military division of the Pacific for the sale
of toe Seal Islauds of St. Paul aud St. George,

Ihe protection of the seal fisheries, from w hich
a revenue should lu derived.
Tlie report of. the Secretary of War contains
a synopsis of the reports of Ihe heads of bur
pans oi the coinnlaiidi rs of military divisions,
and ot the districts of irgtuia, .uississippi and
Texas, and tho report of the Army in lull.
The recommendations therein contained have
been well considered, and are submitted for
your action. I, howeqer, call special attention
to tlio recommendation ot the chief ot ord
nance for the sale of arsenals and land's-no.
longer of use to the Government ; also, to the
recommendation of tlie Secretary uf War that
the act of the Ud of March, 1SUU, prohibiting
pt'oinot'ous and appoinmeuts lu staff corps of
the urtny be repealed. The extent of eoimtry
to be governed, and the number of military
posts to be occupied, is the same with a re
duced nrmv us w ilh a large one. The number
of stall clilrers required is more dependent on
the latter than the former condition.
Tbe report of tlie Secretary of Ihe Navy, ac
companying this, shows tho coudiliou of the
navy when this administration came into of
fice and tlie changes made since. Strenuous
efforts have been itnide to place as many Tea
sels in commission or render thuui tit lor ser
vice if required as possible, and to substitute
tlie sail lor steam whilst thus cruising, thus
materially reducing the expenses of the navy .
and adding greally to Its efficiency. Looking
to our future, I recommend a liberal, though
not extravagant policy towards this branch of
the public service.
The report of the Postmaster General fur
