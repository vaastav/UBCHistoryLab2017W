Ijiiit spring Information was received or the
organization of an extensive movement inthe
W estcrn States, the object of which was the
occupation by unnuthoriZPd persons of cer
tain lands in tho Indian Territory ceded by
tho Cherokecs to the Government for the pur
pose of settlement by other Irdi in tnlies
On tho 2Jthof April I issued a proclamation
warning all persons ngalnt p irticipation in

a military force thelnvosion was promptly
checked It is ni p rpose to protect the
rights of the Indian liiluil itartsofthat Tcrrito
r to the full ixtcatef the Executive, but It
wcu'd bo unwise to ignore the f ict that a
Territo' solirgeand so fertile, with a popu
Jatioti so sparse, and so gicmt a rculth oi un-
usued resources, will le found more exposed
to the repetition of such attemps as hap
pened this vear when the RurroundingStatcs
were most dtuscl settled, and tho westward
movement of our population looked still moro
eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under
such circumstances the diffiiulty of irnin
tain'ng tho Indian Territory in its present
state will grcntlv increase, and the Indian
tribes Inhabiting it would do well to prepare
for such a contingency. I, therefore, fully
approve of tho advice givtn to thim by
the Secretary of the Interior on a recent oc
casion to divide among themselves, in sever
al! , as I irge a qu mtlty of their lands as they
can cultivate, to acquire individual title in
fee, instead of their p-esont tnbal ownership
in common, and const Ier in what-manncr thu
balance of their lands mav be disposed of by
the Government for their benefit. B adopt
ing such a policy the woui I more certainly
securo for themselves the vnlue of their pos

Et ite of things in the Territory.
The question whethtr a change in the con

in the fort) fifth Congress, referred to a Joint
Committee of both Houses forinquir) and re
