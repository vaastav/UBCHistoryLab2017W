on "China and China Closets" Saturday
afternoon in the parlors of the First

years in preparing this lecture, and has
delivered it with great success in many
cities all over the state; during the
World's Fair year spent the entire

and pottery and liao many valuable
specimens secured there. She gave the
hir.torv of China from the very begin
ning, the kinds, values and some of the
pr,,cesses of making- and she had with
her about fifty valuable specimens of
china and pottery, both ancient and
modern, which were very interesting.
Mrs. Gray is a pleasant and bright
speaker and her subject !s full of in
terest for all lovers of china.

lecture Mrs. J. W. F. Hughes delighted
the audience with a piano solo. The ush
ers were Miss Lottie Parkhurst. Miss

T1CTIH OF THE 'PHONE.
New York Woman Sent to Bellevue
Having at Central.
New York, Dec. 5. The doctors at
Rellevue are puzzling their brains over
the case of a woman driven insane, ap
parently by the telephone. It is a new
thing, they say, in medical annais, and
interesting, if true.
Her name is Miss Amelia Leyrer. As
a professional "shopper," a woman who
goes about and gets fine bargains for
other women who live out of town, she
has been earning a good income. She
dresses richly and maintains a hand
some suite at the Continental.
Miss Leyrer stood in the vestibule of
of the office building at Broadway and
Nineteenth streets yesterday and
stopped those who went in and out. She
was wildly excited. Many thought her
intoxicated.
"It's all the fault of the telephone!"
she cried. "Ring and ring, but all they
do is to ask the number. It is so dread
ful, and I cannot get my bonnets."
One of the men accosted called the
janitor and he called a policeman, who
in turn called an ambulance. Miss Ley
rer was taken to Bellevue. She grew
more frantic every moment.
"How can I get my bonnets," she
screamed, "if central does not connect
me?"
HOT KENTUCKY BLOOD
It Was Feared When a Ponce Police
man Fired on Kentucky Volunteers.
Ponce, Porto Rico.Oec. 5. The transport
Berlin, with the First, Kentucky reyirnent
on board, sailed today for Newport News.
(General Guy V. Henry and his staff are
also on board the Herlin, bound for San
Juan, where the Berlin will call tomor

General Brooke. General Sheridan and
Mrs. Sheridan will embark on the Berlin
at San Juan.
In a disturbance here on Saturday a na
tive policeman shot at some United States
soldiers and wounded two Kentuckians.
As it was feared the soldiers would retali
ate, the regiment was confined to quar
ters, the native police were withdrawn
from duty and double patrols of regulars
were detailed to police the town.
THE BABY NEEDED AIR.
Andrew Carnegie Spends Nearly a
Million Granting the Wish
of His Daughter.
TCew Tork, Dec. 5. Andrew Carnegie
said today that the statement that he
woidd build a splendid mansion on the
ground he had acquired in upper Fifth
avenue was erroneous. "A grand palace
would be foreign to our tastes." said he.
5t is to be a plain home, roomy and
comfortable. "We want the sunshine and

Here." continued the steel king, who
was speaking in his present residence,
West Fiftv-nrst street, "extensions are be
ir.z made to nearby property and our sun
shine is beins shut off. I am especially
fond of the park, and walk there two
hours nearly every day."
The RTOund purchased by Mr. Carnegie
comprises thirty city lots, each 100x25 feet.
Its frontage on Fifth avenue is two whole
blocks from Ninetieth to Ninety-second
street, a total of 4X feet.
The cost of the mansion will no doubt
be not less than SI.'XKmxio. The price paid
for the ground alone was onlv $1,000 short
of that sum. The big deal went through
last week, when it was said that the pur
chase had been made by Charles A. Gould
for a friend whose identity he declined to
make known and who would build a mil
lion dollar residence.

RICH VEIX OF GOLD.
Greatest Quartz Ledge Ever Uncov
ered in Australia.
Vancouver. B. C, December 5.-The
steamer Miowera brings this bit of news
from Australia:
There is great excitement at Bathurst
over a rich gold find at Chambers creek.
The gold exposed on the reef is two feet
wide. The quartz is literally bound to
gether with gold. The vein is of the
same line of the ledge where Holterman's
famous $20,000 nugget was found. The as
savs of the new discovery show three
ounces of gold to the ton. Present indi
cations are that it is the greatest find of
quartz ever made in Australia. Other dis
coveries have been made near by. A large
camp will soon spring into existence.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The annual message of President Mc
Kinley submitted to congress today while
taking rank among the longest docu
ments of its kind partakes more of the
character of a report than that of a
recommendation to the national legisla
ture. It is as if he had said: "I lny
before you, gentlemen, the situation and
it is for you to deal with as you deem
proper."
Attention is especially called to the
estimated deficit in the public revenues
for next year of $112,000,000 but no sug
gestion of a means of meeting it is
offered.
The country is felicitated on the fact
that the gold standard has been main
tained and that there is every indica
tion that it will be continued.
No currency legislation is recommend
ed beyond a repetition of his former sug
gestion for the retirement of the green
backs by stopping their reissue when
redeemed in gold, except in exchange
for gold.
Secretary Long's recommendation for
a larger navy is endorsed specifically
and an increase of the standing army
to 100,000 men is urged.
At'ention is called to the obligation
upon the country by congress to make
Cuba an independent nation. Nothing
is said regarding the ultimate future of
any other territory acquired through
the war with Spain.
The greater portion is devoted to a
review of the war and the circum
stances leading thereto and to our re
lations to foreign countries. The only
reference made to the Dingley law is a
recommendation that Greek prunes be
placed on the free list. If the opponents
of the administration find anything
amiss in the message it is likely to bo
based on what was omitted rather than
on what was said.
AFIltE FROM STEM TO STERN
Dalecarlia Finds a Ship Deserted and
All on Fire.
New York, Dec. 5. The German steazr.er
Dalecarlia. from Rio Janeiro, which ar
rived today, when in latitude 37.46, longi
tude 70.r2, came alongside of a ship ablaze
from the stern to the foremast, while a
yellow-funnelled German steamship was
standing in near the ttaminft. pitching
wreck. Nobody could be seen on the
decks of the vessel, nor were there any
boats struKR'Hngr amid the waves, so it is
probable that the crew were rescued by
the steamship, which was waiting- to note
the end. After steaming- around the
wreck twice the Dalecarlia proceeded on
ier way. The steamer by the burning
Fhip was either the Werra or the Fulda.
of the 'North German lloyd line. Both
vessels sailed in comnanv from this port

"JACK THE CLirPER"AGAIN
Cuts Off a Chicago Girl's Braid in
Broad Daylight and Escapes.
Chicago, Tec. 5. "Jack the Hair
Clipper" worked in daylight last week
and the intermittent, but almost con
tinuous, search for him has rebegun.
Mabel Lehman, 12 years old. living at
701 West Polk street, was but a short
distance froh her home, when a tall
man wearing a black slouch hat step
ped up to her. slapped his hand over
her mouth and clipped off one of the
braids. He then disappeared down an
alley.
"I was so frightened," said the girl,
"I could not even scream. He came up
behind me and I could see but little of
him. After cutting off my braid he ran
away and I hurrieer-to my mother."

NO MILK TRUST YET.
Joseph Leiter Said to Be in NewYork
Studying Plans for Its Operation.
Chicago, Dec. 6. Joseph Letter's pro
posed combination of milk dealers has
not yet been effected. Whether it will
be effected is likely to be indicated by
the events of the next two eft three
weeks.
"All that can be said now, is that
plans for purchasing a number of milk
concerns have been talked over," said
Secretary Bowman of the Bowman Milk
company. "How the movement will re
sult is impossible to say yet."
The present effort to combine the milk
trade of the city is the latest of a num
ber that have been made. E. J. Mon
aghan of the Wisconsin Milk company,
and Mr. Kee of Kee & Chapell, are said
to be the men who presented the idea
to Joseph Leiter. The former wheat
king has worked on it with great energy
for several weeks, visiting many dealers
and also the dairy country in the Fox
River valley. He is now in the east for
the purpose, it is said, of studying the
plans of operation of the New York
"milk dealers, who are in a partial com
bine.
"The promoters haven't been to see
u! yet," said the representative of a
large concern, who declined to allow his
name to bs used, "but I understand
there is a likelihood of the deal being
consummated, although certain diffi
culties have to be overcome."
