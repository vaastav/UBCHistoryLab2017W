Helena, Dec. 6.-Associate Justice
Horace R. Buck killed himself at his
home in Lenox to-night by shooting
himself through the head. With his
wife he had been visiting a neighbor
ahd when he returned home he retired
to his room and his wife and the chil
dren to theirs. Only a few minutes
after he bade his wife good-night she
heard a shot and going to the judge's
room, found him lying on the floor.
Death was instantaneous, the bullet
having entered the right eye, and came
out the back of the head.
For some time Judge Buck has been
Working hard and his friends noticed he
was breaking down under the strain. A
week ago he returned from a duck
hunting expedition in Utah, where he
went for his health. His physician says
the ac was committed in a momentary
tit of insanity.
HIS CAREER SKETCHED.
Incidents in the Life of a Mlan 11 ho Had
Much to Live for.
Horace It. Buck was born in Missis
sippi, Sept. 17, 1853. He was a descend
ant of the Rev. Richard Buck who, as
chaplain to Gov. Sir Thomas Gates, set
tled at Jamestown. Va., in the year 1610.
The father of Horace H. Buck, Charles
L. Buck, was a prominent lawyer of
Vicksburg, Miss. In the secession con
vention of Mississippi, in 1862, Charles
L. Buck delivered the last speech made
there in opposition to the state going out
of tile union.
Judge Buck's father having died at
the beginning of the civil war and all
the property of the family having been
swept away, in 1869, he removed to Se
dalia, Mo. From there, in 1871, he was
sent to the Hopkins Grammar school of
New Haven, Conn., at which school be
first met Judge William H. Hunt. En
tering Yale college in 1872, he graduated
in 1876. In his senior year he was
awarded one of the six Townsend pre
miums, the highest literary honors of
the four years' course, for English com
position. In the fall of 1876 he began to
study law in the office of Gen. John W.
Noble, who was afterwards secretary of
the interior under the Harrison admin
istration. After some months in Gen
eral Noble's office, and one year's at
tendance at the St. Louis law school, he
passed his examination and was admit
ted to the bar.
In 1879 Judge Buck drifted to Fargo,
I)akota, where Judge Hunt was
then located. It was arranged be
tween them that Htunt should go to
Montana and that Buck should follow.
In January. 1880, Buck joined Judge
Hunt at Fort Benton, Montana. Here
the two practiced law together for some
eight years. Horace R. Buck represent
ed Choteau county in the council of the
Fourteenth territorial legislature of
Montana in 1884-1885, and was city at
torney of Fort Benton for several years.
In 1887 he and Hunt removed to Helena
and entered into a partnership with ex
Gov. B. Platt Carpenter. Buck was
appointed reporter of the territorial
supreme court in 1888 and prepared vol
umes 7 and 8 of the Montana Reports.
The firm of Carpenter, Buck & Hunt
was dissolved in 1889, after Hunt was
elected district judge of the First Judi
cial district of the state of Montana.
Buck then entered into partnership with
ex-Associate Justice Thomas C. Bach.
In 1891, the legislature having created
an additional judgeship for Lewis and
Clarke county, Governor Joseph K.
Toole appointed Buck to that otfice. In
1892 Judges Hunt and Buck were re
elected district judges of the First ju
dicial district to succeed themselves.
Last year, in the democratic state
convention held in Missoula, the men
tion of Judge Buck's name for the of
fice of associate justice of the supreme
court of Montana was received with
marked favor and he was nominated
amid demonstrations of enthusiasm. His
nomination *as the sure forerunner of
his election. In January of this year he
took his place on the bench, with Chief
Justice Pemberton and Associate Jus
tice Hunt.
There is a remarkable coincidence in
the public careers of Judges Hunt and
Buck, considering the fact that the one
has always been a republican and the
other a democrat. They were at school
and college together, were law pat tners
for 'years. were asselc'iated as districtr
judges for a long time and cer. tc,
gt-her again as associate justices. of the
supreme court.
Judge Buck was marriedt to Missc
Mary t'. Jewett of New Haven. tConn..
Aug. 25. 1881. His wife and three chil
drc n survive him. A few years ago he
built him a rcesidencr e in L1 nox. u
suburb of Helena, and there he had a
delightful home andl suirr unndings
which seemed in ev,-ry way to mak. his
life a delightful one and eon, whk h any
man might wish to live.

bar and the bench of Montana, the pro

integrity and his ability the completest

strange, and the unwelcome message
of his death will fall this morning as
with an oppressing weight on thou

MOTHER M'KINLEY.
she Regains Consciolesues Long Enough
to Recoglnise Her Chldreu and to Greet
Her Aged Mister, Mrs. Osborne.
Canton, Ohio, Dec. 8.-There was an
agreeable surprise to the children and
friends gathered about the bedside of
Mrs. Nancy Allison McKinley this aft
ernoon. She regained consciousness suf
ficiently to recognize not only her chil
dren, but to extend greeting to them,
to her aged sister, MruI. Osborne, Charles
Miller and to others who were near.
Nourishmer was given her about
noon. It was soon after this that she
manifested signs of returning con
sciousness. The first nourishment re
ceived for several days had a telling
effect and she at once rallied. There is
again stronger hope that she may re
cover sufficiently to survive until the
president reaches her bedside to-morrow
morning and perhaps to recognize him.
It is not thought, however, that she will
ever regain complete consciousness.
When the attending physician left Mrs.
McKinley this evening it was with a
feeling that she would survive the night
and possibly longer. She had taken no
nournshment since early in the after
noon, and was not in quite as good con
dition as when she seemed to recognize
those about her. But she lost but little
strength during the day and was repos
ing in a quiet way.
she May Not Rtally.
Canton, Ohio, Dec. 6.-At 10:30 o'clock
to-night Mrs. McKinley is exceedingly
low. She has just experienced another
sinking spell, during which life seemed
to be almost extinct. There are some
moments when she does not seem to
breathe. If she rallies from this spell,
she will probably survive the night, but
Just now it seems doubtful that she will
rally. Her pulse is weak and uncer
tain, more so than at any other time,
and her breathing is difficult. The phy
sician. when he last called, reported
that she had weakened perceptibly.
She is We-akening Slowly.
Canton, O., Dec. 7.-At 3 a. m. Mrs.
McKinley is still living, but seems to
be weakening steadily. There has been
no perceptible rallying from the last
collapse which has now continued longer
than any of the eat lliest hopes. Her
daughter thinks she is getting weaker
every moittent, and she scarcely thinks
that dawn will see her mother living.
The evidence of weakening is in the
pulse and respiration.

AN IMPORTANT DECISION
TEMPORARY INJUNCTION GRANTED
BY CIRCUIT JUDGE HALLETT.
The Case of Winfiehld . Stratton et al. vs.
the Gold Sovereigin Mining &
Thinnel Company.
D)en\ver. c. D. ;.-Judge Hallett, in grant
ing a temporary injunction in the care
of \Vlntield S. Stratton against the told
SoB,,erteign Mining and Tunnel company
et al.. delivered ill the UniLted States cir
cuit court this morning an imlportant oe
clsion which will internst miners all ov r
Colorado and the \West. The opinion
'It appears that the tunnel is ieing
driven by respondents for the purpose of
discovering hlodes in the ilne thereof, and
they intend to assert the t, le to u.,ch ;Is
may be discovered in the tunnel, unt, r
the art of congress, within ctl p ui it a
I aittlion and elsewhere. Whether this may
be done as aga.nst a vo:ld nocation on t.:
sutfuce of earlier date than the tunn 1,
location is the questionl at issue between
the parties.
"Assumitg the John LJogan location to
ha\ve been well made iii the month of
Sntttember, I'l., and malnta.n d th.r.eal
ter, the grantors of respondents could lot
afterward locate the same territory by a
tunnel or in atIy other way.
"('omplainanl alleges that he has dis
e'o\ered good ore in his Logan lo. ai..,ln
and that tlhe respondents intend to as
sert title to I: whenever they can reach
it through ant by means of their tulnn.l.
In any view that may be taken of the
controversy an action at law would not
afford adequate protection to compl ain
ants in the claim. Motion for pr li li

order will stand until othterwise di

SES IS LAUNCHEl
The FipNitth Congrees Is Now
f ly for Work.
THE USUAL FORMALITIES
Great COo ,swarmed Through the
Corridors of the Capitol-A Beauti
rfut Flae iLsplay in the Senate.
P wredet's Message Read.
Washington. Dec. 6.-At noon to
day the B~st regular session of
the Fifty-#Sth congress was launched
upon the unknown seas of legisla
tion. Shauttaneo aly at both ends
of the capitol Speaker Reed in the house
and Vice President Hobart in the sen
ate dropped their gavels and called to
order the bodles over which they pre
side. The sun shone brightly from a
cloudless sky, making a glorious, bright
December day, with a tinge of frost in
the air, and a breeze just strong enough
to keep the stars and stripes snapping
from the flagataffs.
At the capitol crowds wsarmed into
the corridors at an early hour and
choked the marble steps as they ascend
ed to the galleries from which they were
to view the show. As usual on such oc
casions, the reserved galleries were
carefully guarded, admission being only
by card, and the public had great diffi
culty in wedging itself into the limiti:e
sl ace set aside for it.
The attendance upon the session of
the senate to-day, both on the floor and
in the galleries, was notably large it.
spite the well understood fact that lit
tle business beyond the presentation of
the president's mnssage and the pro
ceedings incident thereto would be
transacted.
Prior to the conv\ening of the senate
the members passed a half hour in ex
changing greetings. Mr. Htanna of Ohio,
who has been ill for a week, iwas given
a cordial reception by his republican
collkagues. Mr. Woleott of Colorado,
one of the members of the monetary
commission, was given a warm rece,
tion. Dr. Godfrey Hunter of Kentucky.
the recently appointed minister to
Guatemala, was an interested spectator
to the proceedings.
When the senate convened after the
recess Hon. H. D. S. Money, the new
.enator from Mississippi entered the
chamber, but the oath of office was not
administered to him during the session.
The reception and the reading of the
president's message was the only fea
ture of the day.
The senate chamber, at the opening of
the session to-day, was a veritable con
servatory. The floral display was beau
tiful. Precis ly at 12 o'clock the gavel
of Vice President Hobart fell and the
Senate was called to order. The Invoca
tlion was delivered by Rev. Mr. Milburn,
the blind chaplain. Seventy-seven sen
ators responded to the roll call. The
venerable Mr. Morrill of Vermont was
first recognized by the vice iprtsident.
He offered a resolution, which was
passed in the usual form, that the' see
retary inform the house that the senate
was in session and ready to iricedil
with business.
Allison of lowa presented a resolutio,n
that a comnmittee of two senators lie ap
lointed to Join a like committee, flroml
the house to inform the president thlat
congress was in session and pretparted
to receive any communication hoi may
desire to make. The resolution wa:,
passed and the vice president namd
Allison and (; orlan as the setnatre com
mittee.
By resolution of Cullom of lltnis thet
time of the daily meetings of the senlate
was fixed at unon. On motion of Hale,
of Maine a rec.iss was then taken until
1 o'clock.
At 1:30 the senate reassembled altli
the committee. headed by German, re
ported. The president's message was
presented by Mr. Pruden and at i.:35
o'clock was laid before the senaDt.

WHAT THEY THINK OF IT
Senators Express their Opinions
Of the President's Message.
MARC HANNA ENDORSES IT
or Democrats Take Exceptions to Hi Cur
is rency Recommendatione-Republi.
cans Think It Impracticable to
Press Them at Present.
'e Washington, Dec. 6.-Democratic sen
ators were generally averse to express'
e ing any opinion on the message. Sena
tor Roach is an exception to the rule in
p this class. He called especial attention
to the president's declaration that the
1 government is pledged to maintain gold
realmption.
. "'This." he said, "is a mere assump
tion. We have not a single obligation
r which is not explicitly receemabie in
e'din.' the word 'gold' being mentioned
in none of them."
ISenator White (democrat, California).
e a member of the finance committee, was
-aisposed to take the message jocularly.
it he said:
"The message is very elaborate,
a though its conclusions are somewhat
a veitted. I regret that I cannot agree with
e the president's Hawaiian views, and
r that he has failed to inform us what
we ought to do concerning Secretary
Gage's great currency reform plan. I
am glad to observe that he adopts
views I have frequently urged regard
f Ing Cuba, and legislative action on the
t question of belligerency."
Views by republiean senators were ex
pressed as follows:
t Senator Allen-I do not take the des
pairing view concerning our currency
which the president presents. While
r there are some improvements which I
should like to see made, I think we shall
be able to get along If we do not get
any currency legislation, and as the sit.
uation presents itself now, it looks as iI
it might be impracticrhle to secure leg
islatlt:n on the lines of the president's
recommendations. The recommenda
r tions in regard to Cuba are humane and
f considerate.
' Senator Hale-The recommendations
In regard to Cuba are in all respects
t admirable, and with it I am much
I pleased. On the subject of finances, the
president does not press for immediate
t action and also, myself, I do not believe
- that would be possible under the cir
- cumstances.
Senator Hoar-It struck me as a wise,
L compact, and a carefully considered
r document.
Senator Foraker-As a whole, the mess
r sage is an able document, but I do niot
r agree with the president's conclusions
on the subject of international law as
applied to Cuba.
Senator Chandler-I am especially
pleased with the president's evident in
tention to maintain a policy in the in
I terest of international bimetallism.
Senator Hanna-It is a statesmanlike
and American paper, impressive and
convincing, and one which will confirm
the confidence the country has in the
president."
Senator Smith (democrat)--'While
some of the president'r recommenda
tions with regard to the currency may
be well enough, it must be evident to
him that at the present time they are
impossible of enactment. HIs reference
to bonds is painfully suggestive of the
Inadequacy of the present tariff law,
and while his policy in regard to Cuba
seems more moderate. I hardly think it
is in Une with the special order of the
republican policy.
Senator Allen (popullst)-I do not care
to enter upon a criticism of the presi
dent's utterances, but will say that I
fail to agree with him on his three prin
cipal suggestions of policy.
Senator Teller isilver republican)
I do not believe that any legislation
will be enacted authorising the reten
lion of the greenbacks in the treasury
until somebody is willing to pay gold
for them. The radical advocates of the
gold standard will not be willing to
accept this suggestion, nor will the sli
v,"r men, so far as 1 amt informed, favor
this dislpsition of the financial qucs
tin. It may be that the adminitration
will be willing to go no further to mf't
tho" d".niands of the so-called currency
rer", i't-ers, hut, Judging from the utter
ances of the. secretary of the treasury,
h'. would tc willing to make further
'cn"si'oins. I do not believe that the
stlggt'sti'or for the tying up of the green
backs will meet the approv;l of the
.,' pi,, as :uch a course would In
evitably r·sult in a great contraction of
th, cu'tirency. Indeed it looks to me as
if the suggestions of the president
would not te satisfactory to any great
number of people of any party. The
pre sident is certainly mistaken when
he says that the government is obliged
to redeem its obligations in gold. It
has been the policy of the administra
tion to so redeem them. but there i. i.
