The Preiidrnt'i JIe?ase.
The keynote of th president's mes
sage Is sanity. It is' most comprehen-j
sive In character, leaving scarcely any
dptall of the government's business
unmentloned. And in it all prevails a
strong appeal to deliberate reason. It
is progressive in tone, but radical
neither on the side of reform nor re
action. He urges congress, and very
wisely so. to give time for the oper
ation of the many new and commend
able laws recently enacted before over
loading with another vast supply. In
no sense, however, does he seek by
this advice to limit or restrict action
on measures now pending or about to
be introduced, which the country de
mands passed and which he has pre
viously urged. He recommends prompt
action on all such; on every matter re
quired by the Immediate necessities.
For example, on the tariff, Presi
dent Taft reiterates his demand for
further revision to be accomplished
schedule by schedule, so as to prevent
serious disturbance to business and
labor Interests. But he believes that,
since we have left to the findings of a
tariff board the basis for this further
revision, progress Is not possible at
this session since the board, oilng to
Its formidable task of Investigation,
has been unable to submit its report.
He will recommend to the first session
of the Sixty-second congress, there
fore, this work of completing the tariff
revision. He properly declares that,
as we have approved the tariff com
mission idea, which Is essentially non
political, our representatives in con
gress should carry out the principle
by according fullest co-operation in
making these additional changes. The
saneness of this should be irresistible.
The message ought to be reassuring
to the business world. It pleads for
stability and progress in home and
foreign finance and markets, offering
many suggestions of Immense value,
it betrays an anxious concern for our
merchant marine as an indispensable
factor in developing foreign commerce.
The urgent plea for establishing
American banks or branches abroad
as a further stimulus to trade will
doubtless arouse renewed zeal in this
far-reaching subject.
Covering the Panama canal situa
tion, the Army, Navy,, Interior depart
ments and showing the good work of
the secretary of state. In promoting
trade as well as political relations
abroad, the president re-avows his de
votion to the popular cause of con
servation, advocating the leasing of
oil, coal and phosphate lands and na
tional control as the basic principle.
Effectively showing the advance
achieved along all lines, he is able to
disclose a comfortable treasury bra
ance. Against the estimated expendi
tures for the current year of $630,
494,013, he cites estimated receipts
that leave a surplus of about $50,000,
000. The president would be Justi
fied in taking more credit than he
does for the rehabilitation of our sys
tem of economy, for while be Is de
manding still greater progress of this
congress, he has already effected tre
mendous improvement In every de
partment. It Is to be hoped that congress
will yield a ready and faithful co-operation
to the president in the work he
maps out for thiB session, so that as
complete a cleaning up may be made
before December, 1911, when the great
task of further tariff revision will
coma before it.
Peary is Recognized.
President Taft In his message to
congress recognizes Captain Edwin
Peary as the discoverer of the North
pole and requests congress to bestow
upon him Its most fitting recognition
"of the great achievement." Of
ficially, at any rate, this makes a
closed Incident of the acrimonious con
troversy that has waged about the
heads of Peary and Cook. The un
fortunate feature of the whole thing
Is, if Peary did actually reach the pole,
that Cook, who now confesses that he
did not, should ever have appeared
with his rival claims, for there can be
n doubt that they were responsible,
in part If not entirely, for the ques
tion of Peary's success. It may be in
time to come the world at large will
acclaim Peary as the one man, who,
up to this time, ever reached the pole,
but even if it does not hia prestige is
established by the official recognition
of the government of the United
States, the executive head of which re
fers to his achievement as "unparal
leled." For centuries Arctic explorers
of many lands have tried to do what
Peary la accredited with doing and he
attained it only after ten years of dar
ing adventure and untold hardship,
therefore his country may well feel a
I thrill of pride in his triumph
Direct Legislation.
in its annual report to the governor
the State Railway commis3i6n sug
gests that existing laws are sufficient
for public requirements In the matter
of railroad eontrol. In this will be
found one of the best possible auswers
to the clamor for direct legislation.
It has been set up by advocates of the
Initiative and referendum that direct
legislation is absolutely necessary in
order that the people may secure laws
that are needed. The argument per
sists that corporations control the ac
tion of law-makiug bodies aud that no
laws for the people can be passed.
Yet here In Nebraska e find that two
succeeding legislatures, one controlled
by republicans and "the other ron
trolled by democrats. bae enacted
laws that in their operation are found
to fully meet tiie requirements of the
publii, that do control aud restrict
I
corporate operations and provide sujh
conditions as give relief from abuses
complained of. It Is Impossible that
an) thing more could be accomplished
by legislation Initiated by the people.
Whst is true in regard to railroad
control Is true in other directions. A
careful survey of the various programs
In other states, where the initiative
prevails or where socialistic or other
reform legislation Is suggested, falls
to disclose a single advantage to the
reople that Is not fully enjoyed in Ne
braska. And all of this has been ac
complished under the methods that
are so roundly denounced by the advo
cates of a change. This being true,
the necessity for the initiative and
referendum seems so remote that the
wonder Is it gets any support what
ever. Nebraska has enough to con
tend with without being plunged into
experimental reforms.
Up to the King.
Results of the British elections
have not materially changed the politi
cal complexion of Parliament. Pre
mier Aequlth 's coalition party nation
als, liberals and laborltes while it
made some gains, failed of decisive
majorities. Its advance Is checkmated
by the opposition. So the government,
while it has not sustained a defeat,
has not achieved a victory that enables
it to complete its program of reform
ing the House of Lords without the
royal prerogative. It is now for the
king to say which side shall win. With
him rests the final arbitrament of the
itsue, the anti-veto bill. He has the
power to create enougn liberal lords
to force that measure through the
upper chamber and thus deprive the
House of Lords of its hereditary func
tions. Whether the king will respond
to such a demand remains to be seen.
The premier has faith that be will.
If the ultimate result of the vote Is
what returns now forecast, Premier
Asqulth and his ministry will be de
pendent more than ever upon the Irish
party as led by Mr. Redmond. That,
too, puts up to these Irish leaders an
Issue, the anti-veto bill. He has the
safely be evaded. To be sure, if they
prove true to their convictions, they
will grant no concession until they
have secured what tbey require to
perfect their own home rule program.
Here the situation becomes rather
complex and very interesting. It ap
pears to be a remarkable alternative
that confronts King George. Either
he must give his guarantee of addi
tional liberal lords to override the
wish of the tories and thereby give aid
to the Irish nationalists, or withhold
such action and apparently make pos
sible the defeat of the government.
His position, therefore, becomes pivotal
In the long-drawn-out fight for and
against the veto power of the lords,
which, without his help, the opponents
of that power have been unable to dis
lodge. Workmen's Compensation.
The supreme court or the United
States has set an important precedent
In determining that personal damage
suits brought against corporations
must be determined, in state cor.rts.
This change in practice will servo to
bring suits of this character under the
operation of state laws and In this way
is a long step in the direction of work
men's compensation. It has been
found impracticable to enact a gen
eral law providing for workmen's
compensation In case of accident and
many states have passed local laws on
the topic. The corporations have
evaded these laws by having the suits
transferred tcV the federal court. The
decision of the supreme court now
closea this avenue to the corporation
seeking to evade its responsibility. In
this connection It might not be out of
place to state that of 195,000,000
paid by the corporations of the coun
try to liability insurance companies
$5'0,000,000 went direct to the insur
ance companies, while $45,000,000
went to pay court costs, lawyers' fees
and liquidated damages. It will eas
ily be seen from this that not to ex
ceed $25,000,000 of the sum paid by
the employers for the protection of
the workmen ever reached the injured
men who were entitled to relief. It
Is not that the American employer
does not wibh to compensate as fairly
as possible the workmen injured while
in his employ. The payment of $95,
000.000 for protection Is ample of the
employer's liberality. The system of
distribution is radically wrong. The
enactment of carefully framed com
pensation laws will achieve the
remedy.
Another professional agitator has

Increase public respect for courts and

When the Omaha High school shall
have been completed It will be a splen

certainly provided liberally in thU di

howl that republicans In concrete are
working to put them in a hole. This
is unnecessary. All the democrat
need is opportunity and they will get
themselves in deep enough.

One of the fortunate Imperfections of
plctoral art Is the inability to depict Hie

Wsible. mocking the eye of the camera
and balklnpt the pencil of the artlsi, yet
posesnlnit a grip on the prospect sut-pa.-slnH

"New York is the most heavily moi t-t-aged

estate expert. "Cut this is no sign of

Mrs. Antonio Jdartlnes, who before her

who was credited with having nicknamed
Senator Piatt the "Kasy Boss," died from
asthma at 206 East Ninety-seventh street
recently. It was ten years ago that Winnie
Horn reached the height of her fame as
a newsglrl. The stand from which she and
her sisters Bold papers was located under
the elevated stairway at Sixth avenue and
Twenty-third street. Among her patrons
were Senators Piatt, Hanna and Deuew
and Governor Odell.
There were five Horn girls, all of whom
at times sold papers, but It was Winnie
and her sister Sadie who most frequently
appeared in the newspapers through their
aggressiveness and determination not to be
ousted from tl-.elr corner. Senator Piatt
took an especial Interest in the girls' wel
fare and several times saved them from
eviction. It was at this time that Winnie
Horn called him the "Easy Boss," the
name that clung to him until hla death.
A certain young matron In need of a maid
was talking to an applicant for the place.
The girl appeared anxious to get the work,

"Well, you go and get your reference,"
she finally concluded, "and come back to

"You won't hire nobody else?" Inquired
the girl.
"How can I be sure you will come back?"
asked the woman.
The slrl opened her pocketbook, gravely
took out a (1 bill and thrust it on the

Yo flakes that arc most
Dike a thistledown host,
Or sprume In the van of soma Infinite

What craft Is your mildness.
Oh, inulUple Wlldnessl
Bestows this all-quletlng sense of tho
grave?
For our life Is, I know.
But a search in the snow
Where boundaries change and tho trail die-'
appears;
Where blurring, impeding;
Subduing, misleading,
Drive downfall of moments and drift of
Ute years.
From a soft, from a 'y
And Inscrutable sky.
Time closes round, let him travel or alooM
The Kama to the strongest
An hour at the longest.
And play-fellow powers abai! burr Ma

Yet, flakes floated down
Moth-liKht on tho town.
To batter the heart with tba ultimate dread.
Clean chattels so pent mo,
