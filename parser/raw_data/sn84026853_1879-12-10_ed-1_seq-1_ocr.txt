FARM, GARDEN AND HOUSEHOLD
Selecting Poultry.
I send the following which I have observed
for some years in purchasing
poultry, and which raaybeofusetosome
of your readers who may not be famiiiar '
with the age of poultry:
Fetf housekeepers, and fewer cooks,
are as good judges of the age of poultry I
as they ought to be. We all know when j
? .? poulti7 comes upon the table, whether ;
it is tender or tough; and there should i,
be no difficulty in knowing just as cer- I
tainly whether a chicken, duck, goose or I;
turkey is old or younff, when it is offered I
for sale. Now the following is offered 1 j
as a rule.by which poultry can be safely
judged, which if read ovf-r for a few
times and then laid away for ready j
reference when needed, no person need
purchase old, tough poultry unless trom '
choice.
If a lien's spur is bard, and the scales '
on the legs rough, she is old, whether J
yon see her head or not, but the head 1
^ will corroborate your observation. If j
^ the under bill is so stiff that you cannot :
bend it down, and the comb thick and j
rough lerve her, no matter how fat and
plump, for some one less particular. A *
young hen has only the rudiments of ?
spurs; thescaleson the leg3 are smooth, j
glossy and fresh-colored, whatever the *
color may be; the claws tender and (]
short, the nails sharp, the under bill *
soft, and the comb thin and smooth. \
The old hen turkey has rough scales on
the legs, callosities on the soles of the ?
feet and long, strong claws; a young
one is the reverse of all these marks. J
When the feathers are on and the old ^
.turkey-cock has a long tuft or beard, a ?
young one has but a sproutless one; and ?
f when they ar<* off the smooth scales on ^
the kg* decide the point, besides the ,
difference in size of the wattles of the *
B^ck and the elastic shoot upon the
nose. r
^ An old goose when alive is known by J
, i the rough legs, the strength of the wings, _
particularly at the pinions, the thickness
and strength of the bill, and the I
fineness of the feathers; and when ! :
plucked, by (he legs, the tenderness o .
, ! ?i'l the skin undor the wings, by the pinions |.
and the bill and the coarseness of the
skin. ~
Ducks are distinguished by the same i =
means, but there is this difference?th--1*. S
a duckling's bill is much longer in pr ? ;,
C!* portion to the breadth of its head than
the old duck. A young pigeon is distinguished
by its pale colors, smooth J
scafes, tender, collapsed feet, and the j
yellow long down interspersed among
its feathers. A pigeon that can flv lias .
always red-colored legs and no down, ?
and is then too old for use.?Germantown

Feeding Piss. * .
A Yorksnire iarmer in Enzland savs fi
"'of different food for piss: "After trying: s
- nearly all the different kinds of cereals, fi
and weighing'my pigs once in fourteen e
days, I hava conic to the conclusion that h
if you want to gain weight fast, give h
i \ s plenty of barley-meal and milk. Corn- r
> ' meal may be substituted for the barley." I
* ' Indian corn," says Dr. Voelcker, an t
* eminent authority, " is richer in fat- s
forming matters than almost any other -v
description of food. The ready-made ii
fat in corn amounts to from five and a
half tosix per cent. But animals should c
m bo fed exclusively on Indian meal, j C
because the flo6l?-forming matter in it is . Ii
snmll. Bean meal (or pea-meal) sup-! h
plies the deficiency." Five pounds of i o
Indian corn-meal to one pound of pea- '1
m?u is ,ai mixtutp which contains the .<
proportion of fl?jhfcforming and fattening q
matters nicely balanced. If the farmer li
has not the pea-meal to mix with the ' r
com he may use oat-meal as a substi- I r
tute. A very common food for hogs is i c
boiled apples and potatoes, mixed while 11
hot with corn meal. This is a goad I c
a . food, but Jacki in the nitrogenous eie- a
1 - / ment, which should be supplied either y
; ; by the addition ofcottonseed meal, bran, j a
pea meal or oat meal. If cotton seed r
raeal is used, only one part to ten of corn 11
meal would bo about tnc right propor- ] f
. . tion, while one part of the other kinds j t]
to five of corn meal might be used. Any i
one who has had any experience in toed- a
ing piLrs must have noticed the differ- t
ence thorp is in the readiness and cheap- t
ness witli which some can be fattened as 1
compared with others. In Lawes' and i
Gilbert's experiments two piirs in eating t
one hundred pounds of corn guinea
three pounds, while one pig, which ate 1
one hundred pounds of corn during the I
same time gained nineteen and one quar- <
ter pounds. It is readily seen that it is
highly important to secure the right t
kind of pigs if the feeding of them is to t
bo made the most profitable possible. 11
With a judicious selection of pigs and | j
the right kind of feeding and general 11
management, there is money to be made j i
on our farms in pork-raising, notwit!:- j1

i -i' ness presented to the public during the : t

? V?5?ci?lto Apply manure. I
X The common practice among farmers *
is to make a general clearing of the yards ^
and barn cellars once a year, either in j(
the spring or fall. Either practice makes '*
a heavy draft upon the teams, and it has *
its disadvantages. If this work is done
in the spring, it is when the ground is .
wet and other work is exceedingly pressing.
If the manure is drawn out in the
1^" hill and dropped in heaps upon the held
. ^ .. to be cultivated next season, there is
more or less waste by leaching and by
evaporation. There is a growing dispo- i
sition among our intelligent farmers to j
apply manure directly to growing crops, i
or as near the time of planting and sow- i
ing as possible. It is felt that the sooner |
manure is put within reach of the roots i
of plants the better for the crops and
their owner. Manure is so much capital
invested and bears interest only as it
is consumed in the soil.
The barn cellar may be so managed as
to manufacture and turn out fertilizers <
tlevery month in the year, so that the
. fanner may suit his convenience in ap- !

is not wanted for cultivated crops, it is
always safe to apply it to the grass crop, j
cither in pasture or upon meadows after
mowing. Top dressing is growing in J
favor with our intelligent farmers. Grass ]
i pays better than almost any farm crop i
in the older States, and the spreading of !
compost saves the necessity of frequent j
plowing and seeding. By "top dressing 11
at any convenient season of the year
fields may be kept protitablv in grass for i

A Good Japanese Story.
A very economical fellow named 11
Kisaburo took lodgings near a shop to
which the elite of the epicures of Yedo .
111 " resorted daily for the delicacy of eels <
. fried in aoy. The appetizing odor was
wafted inft> his quarters, and Kisaburo
being a man of Jfcrong imagination,
daily enjoyed a fragal meal of boiled
rice by his palate, and the savory smoke'
of eels through his olfactories, and thus ,
saved the usual expense of fish and
vegetables. .
K> The eel-frier on discovering this,
made up his mind to charge his stingy ,
neiffhbor for the smell of his eels, and
paid him a visit with his bitl made out.
k io.iKnvrv fuVm n? it in orrtoH hiimnr
called his wife, who brought the cash
box. After jingling the box of money,
he touched it on the bill and replacing
it ia the box under lock, ordered his
wifo to return it to its place. The eelman,
amazed at such financiering, cried. ;
out. "Well, are you not going to pay
me?" "Oh no,"said Kisaburo, " You
have charged me fur the smell of your
eels; I have paid you back with the
sound of my monev."

A house too closely haded by trees
will be apt to suffer from dampness. In
building, let the living and sleeping j
rooms, as far as possible, face toward
. the south, and thus gain the advantage
of t he sunshine. The bur is a great power
of health.
Industries of Atlanta.
It was in 1865 that the citizens and
merchants came back to their desolate (
homes at Atlanta, Ga. Only one build- j
ing, of all the commercial part of the i
town, had survived the flames. Busi- <
ness had to be built up from the very ]
foundation again, and the energy with i
which this task was attempted shows j
the strong faith Atlanta men feel in (
their lively town. One of the first to ]
return was the present president of the <
board of trade. He secured a cellar i
under the sole remaining building (on f
Alabama street,) paying ?150 a month i
for its use, and began the produce and i
groceries trade, increasing his income
by renting ground privileges of a few f
feet square off his sidewalk of ?20 a j
month each. Soon the owner of a cor- i
ner on Whitehall street built a brick i
building containing two store-rooms, t
As soon a9 these were ready, our mer- c
jhant and another moved in. paying c
*3,000 a year rent each, and giving half j
r i? J * ~ ? - J xU.
n 11 in advance, iu urtier uu jiiu inc r
jroprietor to go on with his construc- r
;ion. (The accommodations for which
hat $6,000 a year was paid now rent <3
or Si,500) Thus by mutual help and c
interprise. together with a vast amount t
>f personal labor, the ruins were re- j
>laced by substantial business edifices, t
lew hotels ot magnificent proportions r
vere erected, churches more lofty in t
:a jle and spire arose upon the sites of I
hose destroyed, and the vacant streets i:
vere refilled with people. Atlanta be- J
ame at once the distributing point for n
vestern products, and now finds trib- t
itary to her a wide range of country, n
>he handles a large portion of all the
;rain of Tennessee arid Kentucky, be- b
ides much from the Upper Missssippi '
ralley Much of the flour of tlie north- I
western mills comos into her warelouses,
and thence finds its way south- rard
and eastward. The same is true i]
>f the canned meats of Chicago, St. t
vouis and Cincinnati packing houses; s
his is a very important item of her i ]j
wholesale business. The provision men fi
iatura!!y were the first to obtain lootlold
in the new town. After them came S
he dry-goods people. Most of them c
legan in' a very modest way?brought C
linir onnrl<j t.iprl nn in <1 filankpfc almost 1
-yet "now the jobbing trade in di*y- \ 0
;oods alone amounts to some millions ii
>f dollars annually. No tobacco can $
ie. grown in the vicinity of Atlanta, t<
lencesheis without tobacco factories; r
lutsfce.used to handle an enormous v
uantity d? it, and there are half a c
iozen firms who deal wholly in it now, k
t was found that Atlanta's dry, equable fi
limate, consequent upon her great alitude,
made this point the safest place f(
0 keep stores ot the grateful plant; it cl
eould not mould, as it is liable to do in H
1 damp atmosphere. A few years ago, a
he revenue regulations were not as el- t<
ective as at present. The practice of h
tencil-plating packages of tobacco af- ^
orded easy means of evading the pay- n
cent of outy, and great warehouses h
lere were stored with "blockade" to- if
acco, from which Uncle Sam had de- ft
ived very little, if any, pocket-money.
Snormous profits accrued, but the inroduction
of the stamp system put a h
top to this, though Atlanta Was left a a
ery large legitimate business in stor- n
ng and selling tobacco at wholesale. ti
Another source of prosperity to the _
ity is cotton. The 44 cotton belt" of o
Georgia is a strip of country between 0
lere and Augusta. Years ago the land ?
tecame exhausted, and the cultivation js
f cotton came to be of small account. ^
?hen followed the discovery of the <j
uano islands of Peru, and the subse- b
uent invention of artificial fertilizers
laving similar qualities to the natural h
nanure. These superphosphates are C(
uanufactured mainly in Boston, and t<
ost the farmer about forty dollars a ton. g
t was proved that by their use the worn- C]
put cotton-belt could be made to produce d
is bountifnl crops in a series of five a
'ears as the Mississippi bottoms did; '?
.nd, moreover, that cotton could be n
aised as far north as the foot of the tj
rennessce mountains. Atlantii, there- p
ore, lias come to be not only a great
lepot of supply for this ?uano, furnish- i,
ng its vicinage a h undred thousand tons fl
l year,but also the entrepot of all the cot- d
on produced within a circie of nearly v\
wo'hundred milPs.fThis cotton is bought 0
nainly for foreign export, and is shipped ](
inder through bills of lading to foreign t]
)orts, thus (lodging the factors at New p
krorfc, Savannah, and other coast cities. s
rhe business is not done on commission, c
>ut by buying and selling on a margin h
)fprofit. f,
There are other extensive business in- t!
erests. Iron is mined near by, and ex- p
;ensive founderies and rolling mills ^
nanufacture it. Great crops of corn ]j
ind grain are raised throughout tliecen- r
:ral part of the State, which find their c
ivay into Atlanta distilleries, while her jj
(vine-merchants are many and rich. 'v

i whole mountain of solid granite close v

nore commercial advantage,! namely, a ^

Sow her coal is largely supplied from p

Napoleon's Parents. v
The family of Bonapartes were of pure ti
Italian race; there was not a drop of a
French blood in any of them. Their ii
mcestors had come from the mainland
r? +l\o oorltr hiotnrtr nf Pnroioo on/1 flinit*
lames are found in the remote annals i
>f Ajaccio. Carlo Bonaparte was a poor s;
;entieman, of excellent breeding and ] (
character, who married in his youth a j S
young and romantic girl named Letizia I n
rtamolino, who followed him in his e
;ampais?ns up to the moment of the ! tl
airth of Napoleon. It is impossible to e
>ay how much the history of Europe i<
>wes to the high heart and indomitable J
spirit of this soldiery woman. She t<
lever relinquished her authority in her t<
:amily. When all her children were tl
princes and potentates, she was still the a
severe, stern Madam More. The beauty 1
md grace of Josephine Beauharnais tl
sever conquered her; the sweet Tyro- e
iese prettiness of Maria Louisa won v
from her oniy a sort of contemptuous r
indulgence. When her mighty son g
ruled the continent, she was the only ii
human beinir whose eludings he re- s
yarded or endured. She was faithful in c
lier rebukes while the sun shone, and v
when calamity came, her undaunted t
3pirit was still true and devoted to the i:
fallen. Her Drovincial habit of economv ?
stood her "in good stead in her vigorous t
old age; she was rich when the empire 1
had passed away, and her erandchiJoren h
needed her aid. It must have beentrom p
her that Napoleon took his extraordin- \
ary character, for Carlo Bonaparte, s
though a brave soldier and an ardent c
patriot in his youth, was of an easy and c
genial temper, inclined to take tlie ?
world as ho found it. and not to insist a
too much on having it go in his especial 1
way. After the cause of Corsican lib- 1;
erty was lost by the success of the t
Frencli arras, he accepted t lie situation c
without regret, and becoming intimate ;i
with the conquerors, he placed as many J
of his family as possible on the French \
pension list. His sons Napoleon and \
Louis were given scholarships at Brienne t
and at Autun, and his eldest daughter, /.
Elise, entered the royal institution at c
St. Cyr. While yet in the prime of life, 4
he died of the same deadlv disease a
which was to finish Napoleon's days at t
St. Helena: and the heroic mother, her t

Teaching: Children to Cook.
It is generally supposed that smj

Last year she had a class of childre
from the New York Home for- Soldiei

A dozen hands were held up at onci

e that extensive plan. I recommended in my
^x" annual message of December, 1877, the
na re- making of an appropriation for the re-heory
sumption of the work of the commission,
as are jQ t^e meantime, however, competitive
*V? h examinations, under many embarass- |
whlpD ments, have been conducted, within I
'011 nr limited spheres, in the executive departjreacu
mentg Washington, and in a number

the principal cities of the country, with
ion. a yiew to further test their effects, and
it be- in every instance- they have been found j
rovide to be aa salutary as they are stated to |
Uyior htyyfl been under the Admyilsftatjon of
my predecessor.- I think the econS&y,
purity and efficicncy of the public scr- waa
vice would bo greatly promoted by their
systematic introduction, wherever prae- wh<
ticable, throughout the entire civil ser- 1
vice of the government, together with ber
ample provision for their general super- y?tt

from the collector of the port the naval v"

that the competitive system, where ap- "r.
piied, has in. various ways contributed ?H5V
to improve the public service. The re
ports show that the results have been
salutary in a marked degree, ami that *
the general application of similar rules
cannot fail to be of decided benefit to
the service. The report"? of the government
officers in the city of New York
especially, bear decided testimony to the
utility of open competitive examinations
in tneir respective offices, showing that ?
" these examinations, and the excellent
qualifications of those admitted to the
service through them, have- had a RfJ
marked incidental effect upon the per- 3

'ticularlv upon tbose aspiring to promo- ???J
tion. Thero has been, on the part ol clwl
these latter, an increased interest in the
work, and a desire to extend acquaint- eny
ance with it beyond a particular desk, c^?1
and thus the morale of the entire force ^
has been raised. The examinations 'uej
have been attended by many citizens, gUbj
who have had an. opportunity to tj01j
thoroughly investigate the scope and
character of the tests and the method of maj
determining the results, and those visi- 8tjDI
tors have, without exception approved ^
the modes employed, and several of them non
have publicly attested their favorable re r
opinion upon such considerations." I
deem it my duty to renew the recom- ;B
mendalion contained in my annual mes- mur
sage of December, 1877, requesting Congress
to make the necessary appropriation
for the resumption of the work of
the civil service commission. Economy port
will be promoted bj authorizing a mod- .
erate compensation to persons in the
public service who may perform extra ~?;
labor upon or under the commission, as E,~?
the executive may direct. fwj
I am convinced that if a just and defi- zL J"
nite test of merit is enforced for adniie- Sf?
sion to the public service and in making .
promotions, such abuses as removal 15 ]
wiuiouc gooa cause ana partisan ana rv"
official intjrference with the proper ex- . v
ercise of the appointing power, will, in
a large measure, disappear. There arc
other administrative abuses to which *
the attention ofCongre^s should be asked
in this connection. Mere partisan appointmerit
and the constant peril of re- J'1"?
moval without cause very naturally lead rpV
to an absorbing and mischievous politi- j
cal activity on the part of those thus rrp.|
appointed, which not only interferes "*1 *
with the due discharge of official duty,
but is incompatible with the freedom of IKr,
elections. Not without warran;, in the
view of several of my predecessors in d
the presidential office, and directly in j"l
accordance with the lawofl87l, already
cited, I endeavored, by regulation made
on the twenty-second of .Tune, 1877. to ? j
put some reasonable limits to such f?in?
abuse*.' * X
It may hot be easy, and it may never, t? *
perhaps, be necessary, to define with j
precision the proper limit of political junction
on the part of federal officers. h 1 '
But while tl.eir right to hold and freely gj_nj
express their opinions cannot be ques- * ,
tioned, it Is very plain that they should J*
neither be allowed to devote to other f,
subjects the time needed for the proper mcaj
discharge of their official duties, nor to rjOU{
use the authority of their office to rn- >T<hc
force their own opinions, or to o.orr< e Itn^
the political action of those who hold *ues
different opinions. Reasons of justice IJn(j <
and public policy quite analogous to ^
those which forbid the use of ofticial raeaa
power for the oppression of the private reafjj
citizen impose up*m the govern- tjiei;
ment the duty of protecting its mutl
officers and agents from arbitrary praC|
exactions. In whatever aspect considered,
the practice of making levies lor
party purposes upon the salaries of noun
officers is highly demoralizing to the enerf
public service and discreditable to the mHI1(
country. Though an officer should be side <
as free as any other citizen to give his struc
own money in aid of his opinions or his nient
party, he should also be as free as any gr?at
other citizen to refuse to make such whei
gifts. Tf salaries are but a fair compen- now
sation for the time and labor of the offi- this :
cers, it is gross injustice to levy a tax pecta
upon them. If they are made excessive previ
in qrder that they may bear the tax, the soon
excess is an indirect robbery of the pub- a m,
lie funds. I recommend, therefore, such 0
a revision and extension of present cross
statutes as shall secure to those in every
grade of official life or public employ- J? ?
ment the protection with which a great ?ri.e
and enlightened nation should guard a?rfljn
those who are faithful in its service. :
