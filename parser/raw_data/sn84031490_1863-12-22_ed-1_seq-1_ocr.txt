THE NEWS.
Our Indianapolis dispatch brings the
most encouraging news from Arkansas*
The Union feeling in that State is rapidly
gaining ground, and every sign indicates
that she will soon retom'lo her allegiancei
■a free State, upon the basis set forth In the
Proclamation of the President Union
meetings are being held in every part of
the* State that is not cursed with the pres
ence of the ragged rebel hordes, and the
resolutions passed breathe the most uncom
promising spirit of loyalty and -a thorough
endorsement of the Administration in all
its measures.
It is now definitely settled that Maj. Gen.
Rosocrans win take the command at St
Louis vacated by Schofield. With the
presence of Gen. Bosecrans, Missouri will
secure an uncompromising patriot and
lover oftQpaedom, and the curses of sloveiy
and Copperifeftdiflm, which liavo hitherto
impeded her onward march, will be re
moved.
Rebel authority Etatee that the Ironsides
nnd three monitors have become entangled
in the obstructions in Charleston Harbor;
that the Ironsides -will have to be abandon*
od, and that .two of the monitors are dis
abled* The source is sufficient to call for
several grains of allowance.
A Washington dispatch furnishes some
lote and very interesting news from various
points in the South, and will be found val
uable as indicating the defences, food pros
pects and stale of feeling at Richmond.
A contraband brings the intelligence that
Lee is rapidly massing a large army for an
attack upon the Army of the Potomac.
We should be inclined to believe the story
if It stood amply upon the merits of the
relator, bat the fact that it comes via Phil,
adelphia is sufficient cause to pronounce
it a canard.
There is a speck of war in Arkansas.
The rebels with their Indian allies attack
ed our outposts at Port Gibson, bat were
repulsed. The Sd 'Wisconsin cavalry made
a most daring and dashing reconnolssance
nearly to the Red River. Little Rock is
threatened by the rebels.
In addition to the appointment of Rosc
crons at St. Louis, Gen. Curtis takes com.
mand of Kansas, which has been made a
separate district, Gen. Schofield goes to
Baltimore, and Gen. Butler in addition to
his other duties is appointed Commissioner
-of Exchange nice Meredith.
The committee on this subject submitted a -
reiy full report through its chairman, Mr.
Budd, of Pennsylvania, "Which was the sub
ject of a lengthy debate. The bulk of the re
port consisted in recommendations for a
change in the law, transferring certain duties
from the hands of the Collector to those of
the Assessors and their assistants, which is of
no interest to the general reader. The fol
lowing important recommendations were
adopted by the Convention.:
That a tax of ono-cighth of one per cent be
levied bn the gross amount of full sales of
goods and wares sold at other than the places
of manufacture, bat nothing here shall be

FROM THE SOUTH.
Washington, Dec. 2L — A gentleman who
has resided in Richmond during the past five
years, and recently reached this city, having
left Richmond December sth, famishes the
following:
The garrison of the city and forts numbers
about 3,000 men, who are principally employ
ees of the rebel government. They are
sinned with Belgian rifles. The fortifications
consist of several linos of intrenchmcnts,
earthworks and rifle-pits, besides the forts. -
The forts ore sparsely manned, and the num
ber of guns mounted on all the works is
quite inconsiderable, compared with their
extent At the lime our prisoners planned
their escape, the Union men were aware of
the intended effort, and would have joined
the prisoners hud they succeeded.
From the armory in Richmond and the
works at FavetteviUe, Carolina, about
009 guns per week are turned out. All these
guns arc rifled at the Tredegar Works, Their
heavy guns arc hooped, and the work of thus
improving them is going on. Arrangements
sire being made by which they hope* to moke
2.000 rifles per month. !
Their principal powder manufactory Is at
iuirusta, Georgia. The lose of stocking ma
chinery at Fayetteville would prove irrepara
ble. Early in the war, and until a very late
date, the drawings of projectiles adopted by
■our Government were received from Wash
ington, and in some eases their manufacture
commenced in Richmond even before made
Our informant says the published Richmond
prices current underquote everything.' Flour
quoted at $75 per barrel, actually sells at $125,
and other things In proportion.
The arrival of a French corvette for the
purpose of attending to the removal of the
French tobacco at Richmond, had created con
siderable feeling among the merchants and
loud objections were mode to its being given
up, unless the French would raise the block
ade.
All hopes of foreign intervention have died
cut. The refusal «f England to allow the
rnmi to sail excited much indignation, inas
much os the rebel authorities had gold in ad-
vaucc to pay for them.
South Carolina is openly denounced in the
streets of Richmond, with devout wishes that
Hie State might be sunk.
The people are very anxious for an ex
cliauge of prisoners, and it is thought the
cessation was a plan adopted by our Govern
ment to prevent them from re-filling their
army. A systematic starvation of our men
is spoken of as being the policy to compel us
to resume exchanges.
Tragedy in Jllchlgao,
Battik CnutK, Michigaj.', Dec. W.—A
most revolting murder was committed on
"Wednesday night of last week, in the town
ship of lioee. In Kalamazoo county, Michi- <
jcmi. The victims were an aged man named
Boss, and his wife, both of whom were rising
sixty years old, and lived on a farm entirely
alone. They were discovered by their neigh
bor—the old gentleman on his bed, with his
skull broken in; the old lady lying on the
hearth, Lcr skull also fractured—the. Instru
ment used haring apparently been the poll or
butt of a hatchet. Both were in their night
clothes, and the murder must hence have
been committed after or about the time of re
tiring. The object of the murder seems to
luive been money, of which a considerable

[Special Correspondence Chicago Trib on e.]
Clcvxxjlxz), 0„ Dec. 19,1831
Even such busy people as Assessors must
indulge in occasional relaxation, and the
Convention, by way of recreation, gathered
for a social supper at the Angler at 0 o'clock
Thursday evening. Mr. Page, of Chicago,
the President of the Convention, occupied the
chair.
At 11 the Convention again resumed business
in an evening session, which might properly
■he termed a midnight session, as it did not
adjourn tin about 2 o'clock a. m. The ses
sion was held in the gentlemen's parlor, of.
the Angler. The gentlemen were thus
anxious to press business forward as the week
was drawing to a dose, and they were
anxious to'adjourn in time to reach homebe
fare Sabbath.
The report of tbo committee on this sub
ject was submitted by Hr. Preabrey, of New
York, its chairman. This report warofgreat
length and It Is impoeible to make room for
it la onr columns. It will almost completely
revolutionize the law on the subject of man

About Sun. the Convention adjourned to
meet on Friday morning at 10 o'clock.
THIRD DAY-FINAL SESSION. •
At 10 o’clock Friday morning, the Conven
tion reassembled for Us final session. Alter
the usual preliminary business had been
transacted, a letter was read from the Hon.
Joseph J. Lewis, Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, to the Convention, by his Secretary,
Wm. F. Downer, Esq. Theletterwas coached
in terms of high bat well merited compli
ment, thanking the Convention for the in
terest which they had felt in the subject of
Internal Revenue. Yotcs of thanks to Messrs.

The members then resumed the considera

mainder of which, after emendation and al

[Special Dlfpatch to the Chicago Tribune.!
WAsmxoTOif, Dec. 21,15C3.
In accordance with the recommendation of
Gov. Dennison and Secretory Chase, alluded
to some days ago, as well as with tho wishes
of tho leading Radical Missourians, General
Rosecrans was to-day assigned to the com
mand of the Department of Missouri, vice
Schofield relieved.
Kansas is erected into a separate depart
ment and Gen. Curtis is assigned to Us com
mand, and it is understood that Gen. Scho
field goes to Baltimore, though this does not
yet seem to be wholly established. The tri
umph of the Radicals, and of the Loyal
League, is thus complete. has
been for some time convinced of GenT Cur
tis' innocence of the alleged cotton specula
tions, and has thus taken the first opportun
ity to give btm a new command.
Gen. Bntlcr has been formally assigned to
the duty of exchanging prisoners, vice Mere
dith, relieved. This does not interfere with
the command of his department Exchange,
it is now said, will be resumed in a few days.
The first negro was exchanged a day or two
ago.
It is pretty certain that the distinction of
dosses, in-the conscription bill, will bo abol
ished before Congress take e its recess for the
holidays, so that the draft, which comes
early in January, may tall not simply upon
men under 85, but upon the whole able
bodied adult male population of the country.
Gen. Schenck to-day offered such a bill In the
Bouse. It was unanimously approved by
the Military Committee, and the Senate Com
mittee is also understood to favor it. The
House wm resist an attempt to pass further
amendments to the conscription law,
until after the . rccesa, on the ground
that the bill is imperfect now, and any party
attempts to patch it are only likely to make
matters worse. Clergymen are pretty cer
tain to he exempted when the amendments
arc made, if the S3OO clause is repealed, oth
erwise not Statistics have been laid before
the Committee showing that one-sixth of
those exempted for the last draft get off for
being'only sons of a widow, or men worth
great fortunes, whose widowed mothers hap
pened to be living with them, were exempt
ed under it This will bo carefully guarded
aginst in the contemplated amendments.
A strong movement is likely to be made
this season to consolidate the regulars and
volunteers.
Representations made to the Military Com
mittees in both Houses, from all parts of the
country, seem about equally divided on the
subject- of retaining or repealing the S3OO
danse.
The statements that have crept into the
papers that Senator Sumner folly endorses
and adopts all the views in the President's
message arc unwarranted. He has, of course,
expressed no dissatisfaction, but he could
hardly be expected to give up so promptly
views of his own, either in conflict with the
President's, or supposed to be so.
McClurg'sblll forpayment of the Mo. home
Guards came up to-day from the Ways and
Means Committee, and Mr. Blow succeeded,
against the opposition of the party Demo
crats, in getting it made the special order for
to-morrow. *
The Democrats continue to display a state
of disorganization so remarkable that the
yew York TFbrW, to-night, reads them a
sharp editorial lecture about it The rote on
Clay Smith's resolutions, the other day, split
them flrirly in two, and to-day an effort was
made to prevent the payment of the twenty
million appropriation for premiums to
negroes. Prominent Democrats voted
against the attempt, and for treating negroes
like other soldiers.
The movement attempted to be inaugura
ted through theproposed action of the House
Administration caucus against Mr. Blair,
seems likely. *to faih. The chairman of the
caucus is unwilling to call it together, and
members seem to have aprndent recollection
ot a similar demonstration once made against
another Cabinet officer, in the other wing of
the capital. Some members still insist on
the meeting of the caucus.

Indianapolis, Pee. 31,1863.
Gen. Kimball, recently in command at
Little Rock, Arkansas, passed through this
city to-day, eu route for Washington, to rep
resent to the Government the condition of
affairs in that State and urge the importance
of reconstructing the State Government Im
mediately. He reports that immense Union
meetings are being held in all portions of the
State, and that the citizens arc the most ar
dent and uncompromising adherents to the
Fedral Government he has ever met. They
adopt resolutions |at all of their meet
ings, endorsing without reserve all of the
acts of the Administration for the suppres
sion of the rebellion, that a
State Convention be called at an early day to
take measures for re-organizing the State
Government ‘without slavery.
Recruiting has been extended until the sth
of January. It Is believed that every county
in the State will fill her quota, many having'
done so already.

THE RAM ATLANTA.
New York, Dec. 21, 1863.—The Philadel
phia Korth American of this morning sajs the
ram {Atlanta, refitted and put In order, la
likely 1o be only less formidable than the
Ironsides. The talk at the Navy Yard is that
she would go to Charleston, to take the
place of the last Weehawkcn. The Atlanta
is more like the Ironsides than any of the
monitors.
FROM TEXAS.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
Washington, Dec. 21.
SENATE.
Mr. DIXON Introdnccd various petitions
praying for the amendment of the enroll
ment act, bo that ministers of the gospel may

ployed in the'service as chaplains.
• Mr. HARLAN presented a petition of cit
izena-of lowa, praying for the total abolition

Mr. MORGAN submitted a joint resolu
tion, calling uponihe Secretary of War for
the names of all officers and men of the reg
ular army who have deserted or resigned be
tween tno Ist of Dec. 1860 and Dec. 1803.
Adopted.
. Mr. FOOT offered a similar resolution
relative to the Navy. ■
The pending question being on the post- .
pouement ofthe resolution of Mr. SUMNER,
embodying the proposed rule of the Senate.
Mr. BAYARD continued the discussion -
and favored apostponoment of action.
Mr. SUMNER said • it was difficult to resist
the application urged with so much pertinac
ity by the gentleman from Delaware. Yet
that gentlemen enjoyed the most ample op
portunity of considering It was duo Hie Sen
ator that it should be settled-without delay;
nnd before the holidays he should deem It his
duly to press it to a vote.
The morning hour having expired, on mo
tion of Mr. WILSON, the bill for increased
bounty and pay of volunteers was taken np.
The Committee’s amendment, allowing sol
diers to ro-enlist;ln.other branches of the
service, coming first under consideration, the
amendment was agreed to. -
Mr. WILSON explained that In October
last, when it was found the draft for 800,000
men was insufficient to nfeet the wants of the
War Department, a bounty of S4OO to vete
rans and S3OO to others was offered, and this
bill was designed to carryout the pledge thus
made. Nine million dollars had then been
received from commutations; this was now
augmented to twelve millions.
Mr. WILSON acknowledged the necessity
of exercising great care with regard to the
depletion of the treasury and to seeping the
credit of the Government intact. It had al
ways been thought more difficult to obtain
more money than men. He wanted the cur
rency of the country sound and her credit
good. Yet we must keep our pledges made
to tho enlisted men. Their enlistments were
numerous, not only in the Northern States
but in the Southwest East Tennessee had
recruited 8,500 men. Texas had famished
two regiments, and Arkansas bad yielded sub
stantial additions to their forces. Such re
cruits should be -dealt with according to
promise. He Was ia' favor of the commuta
tion clause and for the payment of the boun
ties proposed.
Mr. HARRIS, of N. Y., did not favor the
amendment of the committee as it stood, and
thought it would stop all recruiting after the
sth or January.
Mr. LANE, of Indiana, sold wc could not
fill our armies with conscripts alone. There
were 8,000,000 men subject to draft at this
time, and of this number, on the basis of the
receipts of the last draft, bnt 426,000 could
be brought Into tho field If the entire enroll
ments were taken, and out of this number
from 20,000 to 80,000 would be deserters.
Indiana had more than filled her quota, and
could be depended on under any circum
stances to furnish her fall share without re
sort to the draft.
Mr. COLLAMER moved to strike out the
words January sth, and insert HU the next
draft, not later than February Ist. Lost.
Mr. HOWARD moved to strike out sls in
the committee’s amendment and Insert S2O as
the bounty for obtaining enlistments of vet
erans. Rejected;
After a conversational debate, participated
In by Messrs. 'Wilson, Howe and Fessenden,
on motion of Mr. Sherman the Senate ad
journed.

The Speaker laid before the House a letter
from the Frccdmsn’* Aid Societies, ofßoston,

A message was received from the President]
informing the House that he had approved
and signed the joint resolution of thanks to
Gen. Grant and the armies under him, and

priating $700,000 to carry Into .effect the act
of March, 180 a, for pay, bounties and pen
sions to the officers and men actually em
ployed in the Western or Department of
Missouri.
Mr. COX, of Ohio, objected to tie
consideration of the bill at this time.
Mr. KING, of Mkeouri, advocated the pas
sage of the bill.
farther debate ensued, when the bill was
made tlie special order for to-day at 3 o'clock.
Mr. SCHENCK, of Ohio, from the Military
Committee, reported abill repealing the third'
and tenth sections-of the Enrollment Act, so
that the two classes of persons to be drafted
shall be consolidated into.one; this to take
effect on and after its passage. Objection be
ing made to the consideration of Schenck’s
report at this time, he temporarily withdrew
Mr. TEAMAN, of Ky., offered a series of.
resolutions setting forth that a conspiracy of
persons exists, assuming to he a government
of the Confederate States, for the purpose of
withdrawing States from the Federal Union,
but that this docs not extinguish the political
franchise of snch States, amHhat the citizens
thereof can, at any time, resume their civil
gOTermucnt on the only condition that their
constitution is Republican, that is, sufficient
for those who are loyal and qualified by
the election laws to resume their State
government, and this is a sufficient evidence
of loyalty, Ac., Ac. The House refused to
second the demand for theprevions question,
when on motion'of Mr. LuVEJOT, the reso
lutions were referred-to a select committee
on the Rebellions States.
Mr. SPAULDING, of Ohio, offered a reso
lution for the appointment ot a select com
mittee of nine, to consider and report on the
subject of a National bankrupt act.
Mr. HOLMAN, of Indiana, moved to lay
the resolution on the-lnble. Lost, 69t080,
The resolution was then adopted.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio introduced a bill
which was referred, providing a provisional
government in the in insurgent states and
authorizing the loyal citizens thereof to or
ganize a government, Republican in form, and
for other purposes.
Mr. SCHENCK, of Ohio introduced a bill
to create aßnreau of military justice,referred
to the Committee on Military affairs.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio, offered a resolution,
granting the use of this hall forapnblic meet
ing of the yrecdmcn’js Relief Association.
Mr. COX, of Ohio, objecing to this, the
the rules of the House prevented further ac
tion on the resolution to-day.
Mr, SCHENCK, of Ohio, moved the sus
pension of the rules In order to take up the
report and act upon Inc hill to consolidate
the two classes in the enrollment act into
one. The vote was—yeas 63, nays 66—so the
rules were not suspended, a two-thirds vote
being necessary.
• i Mr. MILLER, of Pa., offered a resolution
respectfully requesting the President to
promptly instruct {host having charge of the
exchange of prisoners to propose to the so
called southern Confederacy to exchange
white man for white man, leaving oil other
questions, including that relating to*negro
prisoners, to be disposed of hereafter, so that
rite suffering white men may bo restored to
the service of the Government, their friends
and firesides. The House refused—73 against
82—to lay the resolution on the table.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of HL, offered a sub
stitute for the above, declaring that the
House approves of the measures taken by tthe
Administration for the exchange of prisoners
now held by the enemy In Southern prisons,
and recommending that the same course be
pursued for a fair and just exchange of all
soldiers now held by the rebels. The ques
tion was token and Mr. Waabburnc’s substi
tute was adopted—B7 against 03.
A long discussion ensued on the bill ap
propriating twenty millions for bounties for
volunteers.
Another Rebel Plot.
Washington, Dec. 21.—The Government is
said to have received information of a rebel
plot to' rescue the rebel prisoners now at.
Point Lookout, under charge of Gen. Mara
ton, of the New. Hampshire Brigade The
prisoners deny all knowledge of the affair,
and many of them, who are very comfortably
quartered, would not join an insurrection
even if an armed force of rebels made their
appearance. Precautionary measures, how
ever, have been taken at the Point, and if
any such attempt was undertaken, the at
tacking party would surely receive a warm
rcception.
Prom Charleston,
Fobtbess Monrob, Dec. 2L—Richmond
papers of the 19th contain the following:
Charleston, Dec-18.—The Ironsides and
three Monitors, while attempting to pass
the obstructions, became entangled. The
Ironsides will probably have to bo aban
doned. Two of the Monitors are also badly
disabled.
Generals Schofield and Cartis.
New
special to the K. Y. Tridune says:
Although no official order has yet been is-,
sued, it may be considered certain that Gen.
Schofleld will be relieved in a day or two at
i his own request, and Gen. :Rosccrans will
succeed him. „
A new command will soon be arranged for
Gen. Curtis, the President having said that
the charges against him in connection with
cotton speculations are utterly unfounded.

From 9lexlc6V
New York, Dec. 31. —A Havana letter says
Gen. Comonfort was murdered by his own
coutrymen, and the new Maximilian regen
cy was virtually dissolved by the action of
the Archbishop of Mexico city. The' Arc
hbishop insisted on the restoration of the
church property which had been confiscated
and distributed by Juarez. This wds re
fused, so his Grace not only retired front "the
royal Council, but excommunicated etfirj
person, French and Mexican, who opposed
him, from Gen. Bazalne and Gan. Almonte
down to the drummer boys of the liberating:
army. The cathedral doors being closed'
against the parties, Gen. Negre surrounded'
the building with 8,000 French soldiers, and
planting bis cannon at the door, demanded
admission within a certain time. The Arch
bishop admitted the pions belligerents, offi
ciated at moss and gave them especial bene
diction.
Gen. Doblado,. Governor of Guanaxuato,
bad declared for Juarez. Gaadalaxara was'
besieged by Mexican imperalist forces. Gens.
Major, Berthier and Bazalne advanced the
French-Mexlcan army to important posi
tions. Governor Viaurl was hostile to
Marez.
The latest reports from Bt. Domingo, by
way of Havana, represent Spanish troops as
making a steady advance towards the heart
of tho insurrection, and will likely subdue It.

THH CLOSE OF NAAIQATiON.
Vessels Laid Up In the Fort of Chi*
caso for the Present Winter.
Navigation has dosed. No more this season
will the muddy ■waters of the Western Styx be
plowed with the sharp keels of the various propel
len, barks, brigs and schooners which all summer
long have transported to and from the city tho pro
dneta of the Great West and the manufactures of the
East. The tngs,whlchall summer disported them
selres in the inky waters of tho far-famed Chicago
Hltct, like porpoises In Passamaqnoddy Bay, have
laid up for the winter, and, like Othello, their “oc
enpation is gone." Tho lazy bridge-tenders will
no more be wakened from a state of lethargy by
the shrill screech of their whistles; and the bridges
are now dosed, to the delight of thousands of citi
zens, who bare many a time and oft anathematized
them as a confirmed nuisance. The river is now
covered with an Icy band, and the only signs of
lifetad activity it will exhibit will be the countless
numbers of the Great Unwashed, who will have a
skating park without mingling with the “ upper
ten.” Strangers can now visit the city without
detecting that odoriferous perfume which has for
some time past been the “watchword and battle
cry” of our people.
Ttao past season has witnessed greater activity
ever before known in tho annals of Lake
Commerce; and had it not been for the almost
complete destruction of the corn crop by the Sep
tember frosts, there Is no doubt that there would
have been a much larger increase. Our harbor has
been visited by a large number ot new vessels,
which in size, beauty of model and appointments
have not been surpassed by anything on fresh
water. Among those are the propellers Idaho and
Winslow; barks Western Metropolis, Chicago
Board of Trade; 1). P. Bobbins and Champion;
schooners C. J. MagU!, Prince Alfred, Kostauk,
Dick Somers, and others whose names wo have
forgotten. The Straits of Mackinaw opened on the
10th of April, and the first vessel to get through
was the propeller Hunter, which arrived here on
the 20th oj April. The hark Northwest was the
first to make the round trip between here and Buf- .
falo. On the 14th inst., the schooner Fisher, from
Kalamazoo, arrived—the last of the season.
There has been but few disasters this summer—
the most serious being the explosion of the tug
Crawford, (since rebuilt) by which three persons
met an untimely end, at the mouth of the river;
the foundering of the steamer Sunbeam on Lake
Superior, of whom all on board save one found a
watery grate; and the sinking of the propeller
Water-Witch in Thunder-Bar, Lake Huron, from
which none were left to tell the tale.
