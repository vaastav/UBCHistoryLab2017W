OUR FI&Sr-3A.TTLi: SHIP.
Tne Mailt, which was successfully
laughed at the Brooklyn Navy vard on
Tuesday, h the iirst of the heavy arm
ored battie s: i;s which have been auth
orized for our new American navy. The
evant, was tij-rfurj one of more than
ordinary i:-.!?r'-t arid importance. The
pr.-ia?nt ves'is of our new navy, the
B-ntoa. A'iaiiio a id Chicago, the New
ark. Ohurl-is;.:n, Jlialtiniore and San
Frjac ssu, are cruisers pure and simple.
They were ujL meant fur fighting pur
pMM Til aine however, while a
cruiser, is a battle ship as well, and may
be 'airly said to represent the highest
attainment of American naval architec-
ture. She has a length of 33J feet all
over and 310 7eet at the water line. Her
width is 57 fet and she has a mean raft
of 2l:j feet aa J a dlsplaoneat of CoiS
tons. Waa co:np.o:oJ the total cost
will be abjut cCt.OO ,OJJ. Tne vessel will
be bark-i-iirfd, haj 171 water tight com-
partoicau aid ill be heuviiy urin ed.
Tha nickle steel plates will bo eleven In
ches thick, tapering to eleven inches at
the edges. There wiil be two three
bladed screws, propeled by triple ex
pansion engines of 5750 horse power.
Thejship is to be steered and heated by
6team,and lighted by electricty. The
boilers are eight in number pd single
ended. All are of the ordinary return
tubuiar tvpe, 11 feet 8 L-e diameter
and 10 feet long, desigJ or a pressure
of 135 pounds. Ejc tne boiler h ave
three corrugated furnaces and 519
eteel tubes. The rrate surface of the
eight boilers is 3 square feet and
the heating s'ace of 1SJ0 square feet.
The armaai11' consist of four ten-
incb and six-inch rifles. The heavy
guz? w " be caried in Hichborn barbet-
t urrts, two forward and two aft.
They will have a sveep of the entire
horizon. The two six inch guns are pro
vided with two inch steel shield for the
protection of their crews. Two of these
are in recessed ports forward, two in
6imilar ports aft, and two on tho super
structure deck in broadside. The bec-
ondary battery numbers foursix pound
ers and four three pounder rapid fire
guns, four 17-millimeter revolving can
non and four gatlings. There are also
to be seven torpedo tubes. The com pie t-
iton of this remarkable vessel will mark
along step in j the direction of bring
ing the United States fleet to a degree of
perfection in keeping with the im
portance of the country, and at the same
time, will be a new monument of Amer
ican 6kili and enterprise.
Lieutenant Ward's tribute to the
dead Major iiarttlelot, the commander
of Stanley's unfortunate rear column,
will be joyfully received by those who
are interested in the great Stanlty ex
pedition. Much that is to Barttelot's
discredit has transpired, and the fait
that he was a slave to military disci
pline is a grateful mitigation of his
errors. The sight of an oflieer on the
verge of starvation, and with his com
maod demoralized by 6 ckness and dis
ease, in an almost mutinous condition'
refusing to touch stores or medicines
which were entrusted to him by Lis
commander, is fcometing that almost
atones for his cruelty.
From a communication which appears
elsewhere in todays issue it would ap
Iear that the late lamented democratic
central committee had tackled a job be
fore 6hufflmg off, that was a little un
handy. In their efforts to rodero the
"uohys" they found a gent'eaian wh
did'nt proposed to be corraled at the ex
pense of principle. .":r. Donovan proves
to be a ditierent kind of metal from what
the commi:tee has been used to deal
with, hence their error.
No man should place his name upon
the obligation of another, if he has net
sufficient to pay it without detriment to
his own business. It is dishonest to do
6o. Men are trustees for those who have
trusted them, and the creditor is entitled
to all his capital and credit. For one's
own firm, "your name, your fortune,
your sacred honor"; but for others, no
matter under what circumstances, only
uch aid as you can render without
danger to your trust.
A sew writer presents the uame
crimlets" for the little social crimes
and indiso etioas which are propagated
and thrive in the upper crust. Crimlets
will do. It is a novel word and lacks
the harshness of pome other terms we
might mention. Let it then be crim
lets. Thk theory that whisky is necesary
in the treatment of peneumonia has re
ceived a b'o a from Dr. Bull of New York
City, who discovers that in the New
York bospitils G5 per cent of the pneu
monia patients die with alcoholic treat
ment, wniie in London, at the object
Lesson Temperance Hospital, only 5 pe
cent die. This discovery will seriously
depreciate the cases of pneumonia.
The Yuma Times propose to enlarge
to seven columns. We are glad to
notice the evident sign of prosperity on
the part of the Times. Under tbe pres
ent manage meat it has greatly improved
in appearance and quality.
A native Japanese paper mentions a
case of a man aged 40 this year, living
in the province of Bizen, who has mar
ried and divorced thirty-five wives, and
is now married to the tnirty-sixth.
Where is Chicago.
Where is a woman's place asks a fe
male writer. Some gentleman responds
that if a lady's head were placed on his
shoulder it would be entirely satisfac
tory. Rev. Talxage in a recent sermon
says seeing is not always believing. It
generally is, however, so far tsyour wife
is concerned.
An exchange says lleroert Ward has
attacked Stanley on the rear guard. Isn't
that rather a cowardly place to attack a
man?
FRUIT RAISING PAYS.
While much of Arizona's prosperity
depends on her mines yet there is no
reason why a considerable revenue
should not be added to our coffers from
the soil. In this territory can be raised
every species of fruit adapted to a tem
perate and semi-tropic zone. Will thrive,
and yield a rich return. As a sample
of some of the profits from fruit, we
quote 6ome facte beiow given by a Po
mona rancher, and others:
Tne Ls Angeles Chamber of Com
merce issued a bulletin the first of the
month giving reports from ranches and
fruit growers in the country, of their
j success with different products. Among
the reports on prunes is one from George
Rohrer, living one-half mile east of
North Pomona, who from thirteen acres
of five year -old trees secured eighty
eight tons, which sold on the trees for
$1,400. The cost of production woj '2C0,
leaving a net prolit of c'4.140. rj"l3soil

f t fro r 4f-h -of WH1. r f o eiL ii t
acres. 04 ncres or four year-old
orange tiees at Azusa yieidtd a r.a
profit of $1,070. while other tracts i
ol-ier trees yielded SoOU per acre. Twelve
acres of grapes near Downey yielded
net profit of 81,140, while another ranch
of forty acres near by netted 2,600.
Apricots thowed a net profit of from
120 to 8150 per acre. Two acres of
lemons in South Pasadena netted S700.
N. Hayden, from four acres of mixed
fruits in the Vernon district, after sup
plying his family of five with all the
fruit they wanted, sold 985 boxes of
oranges, 15 boxes of lemons, 8,000 pounds
of apricots, 200 pounds of peaches, 200
pounds of loquats, 2,500 pound of necta
rines, 4,000 pounds of apples, 1,000
pounds of plums, 1,000 pounds of prunes,
1,000 pounds of figs, 150 pounds of wal
nuts, 500 pounds of pears; proceeds,
$1,650. Market gardens showed a net
profit ot from $100 to 200 per acre on
potatoes, tomatoes, greon peas and other
vegetables.
It is not inapportune to call atten
tion in connection with the Messiah
craze to the suicidal policy of the govern
meni. in allowing the Apache to bear
arms. These people are provided for
with rations at their respective agencies.
They are furnished with farming imple
ments; with seed, and there is absolute
ly no necessity or reason Wiiy they
should be furnished with arms. It is
no benefit to be the Indian and is found
to be a serious calamity in times of spas
modic outbreaks. Acting Governor
Murphy in his report mentions tins
matter, especially, and we have yet to see
one member of the press disagree with
the Ktand taken. In its attemps to deal
justly with the Indian the government
should give the white man a thow when
it can be dene without too mujh iocou
venience. The band stand seems to b growing
into a whits elephant Some time
ago we understand the corncil areed
to raise the difference between 8200 and
jS-;00, provided the first mentioned
ji.ar.tity was placed in sight. Mrs, C.

democratic fold had gone off amongst
'jho cactus on the wett bank of the Rio
de la Santa Cruz, and were endeavoring
to start a ghost dance for Mr. Dunavan's
s-crdp. The military immediately com
municated with Mr. Dunnvau, who is of
the belief that their first attack will
probably be on the nearest 6aloon.
Young-man-afraid -of-his-shadow, it
thought to be leading the outbreak, but
tney can't stay out long without rations.
The American Banker 6ays: The
New York stock panic i9 over, and the
market will probaly bo followed by one
of those reactions which led an English
banker elevated to a peerage to declaie
in the House of Lords that panics were
ordained aad prepared by Divine Prov
idence to enable the Bhrewd, the saving
and the prudent to amass wealth by
taking advantage of the 6tocks and
securities sacrificed by the reckless, the
improvident and speculative.
We do not think the Irish cause is
endangered by Mr. Parnell's course. The
principle of justice for which the Irish
patriots are contending do not depend
on any one man. lhey may possiblv be
retarded, but nothing more. Greater
men and better men than Mr. P;.me!l
have advocated Iribh liberty, and died
for it, but the procession never paused
in itd onward course. Men are but a
drop in the brine of the great ocean of
life. Even the impress of the greatest
wears away.
Ix the present Indiau troubles in the
nor.h west, General Miles is bringin.-out
his great qualities as a soldier by tak
ing such steps as are calculated to pre
vent ho-tililies. General Miles is thor
oughly acquainted with the Iudian char
acter, lie is familiar with the fact that
the noble red man will ak an ting in

and then for the rest. He knowB
that this sou of tha forest is not especi
ally modest in anything, and he will
treat him accordingly.

To

to listen to the reason of his compatriots
and thrown ;lovn the gauntlet to Glad

Trish nartv now to do. On i? cut

Gladstone, take an inven ory of stock

the greatest cf Irish statesmen. He
might have continued in tho confi
dence of the people if at the time of
the unfortunate O'Shea affair ho had
promptly retired for a time frm public,
until he could have atonedto the wo
man -r rs CTTuL'gVd, m a legal way.
Such action would have been the action
of a patriot ho prefered country to self.
I'j would have been manly; and to have
rafused such reparation has lowered Mr.
Parnell in the affections aud estimation
of all right minded people.
Tne time was wbeu Mr. Parnell's word
6tood for an oath, but in tho case of the
London Times prosecution he publicly
acknowledged to having lied.
When this affair came up he stated
that he would abide the decision
of his colleagues. They O'Lirien
Dillon, Michael Divitt, Justin McCar
thy all asked him to retire in order to
avoid an open split with Gladstone. He
refused in the fce of his premise.
Now he has made several distinc and
separate charges against Gladstone
which that man denies absolutely, and
brands them falso in every particular,
ow wno are we to ueiiever lao man
who has publicly confessed he lied? The
man who betrayed a friend and follower
in the common cause of Irish liberty by
debauching his wife? Tho man who
makes a voluntarily proposition not
to tie the hands of his country and
immediately proceeds to bind them with
thongs? Or the man whose lips never
spoke a public untruth, or whose life
has been open to ths light of day.
Mr. P.irnell has been the main reliance
of the Irish people. But he has fallen
from his high estate. In the hour of
need, when relief for the suffeiiug col
leans was at hand, he proved weak, and
weaker still when he permitted his per
sonal ambition to stand in the wav of
th advancement of Ireland's neces
sities.
Ireland's honor was given in Parnells
keeping, he has betrayed it. Her pat
r ots were pledged to rally to his staa
dard almost before the gr en. How has
a treated them? Her woes and her
s rr ,xs looked to him for relief, and by,
i:ig!j w.jrd lie has placed years of
burden upon the now over oppressed

Because the Crmvx considers a thor

The 6outh is the least effected by
the nock flurry in Wall Street. Since

results are now felt.
It appears when the Democratic Cen

I Washington, Dec. 1 The following
is tho President's message delivered to
Congress this morning:
Ti THK SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESEN
TATIVES:
The vast and increasing business of
the government has been transacted by
the st-veral departments during the year
with faithfulness, energy and success.
Revenues amounling to about $450,000,-
000 have been collected and disbursed
without a single case of defalcation or
embezzlement.
Uf the anamerican conference the
President says: "This important con
vocation marks the most interesting and
3ontinental epoch in the history of the
western hemisphere."
The killing of General tJarrundia on
board the Pacific Mail Steamer Aca
pulco while anchored in transit in the
Port of Jan Jose De Guatemala demand
ed careful inquiry. Consent of the re
presentatives of the United States was
6ough to effect his seizure. The captain
refused to give up his passenger without
a written order from theUnited States
Minister. The latter forwarded the de
sired letter on condition that General
Barrundia's life should be spared. Gen
Barrundia resisted capture, and was
killed. It being evident that Minister
M izner had exceeded the bounds of his
authority in violation of any p ecedent
this government was constraine to dis
avow Mr. Mizner's act and recalled him
from his post.
The Nicarauguan canal is making en
couraging progress.
Our relations with China have been
tne sublect of much correspondence. A
proposal has been made to Mexica, and
Great Britain to consider the regulation
of the passage of Chinese laborers across
our southern and northern frontiers.
The difference between the United
States and Great Britain touching the
fur seal question in Be bring Sea is not
yet adjusted as will be seen by the cor
respondence which' will soon be put be
fore congress. It is sincerely hoped
that before the opening of another Beal
ing season some arrangement may be
effected which will assure to the United
States the property rights derived from
Russia, which was not Jdisregarded by
my naiion or more tnan eignty years
preceding the outbreak of the present
trouble.
The questions involved in the revision
of the treaty relations with Japan are
grave and delicate and it is hoped the
present friendly relations between Japan
and the United States will not be af
fected.
The friendship between our country
and Mexico has never been more con
genial than now. The Mexican railway
system will be enhanced to a degree al
most impossible to forecast if it should
become a link in the projected intercon
mental railway. We recommend that
our mission to Mexico be raised to a
first class one.
Regarding reciprocity the President
says: "bpecial arrangements in regard
to commerce based upon a reciprocity
provision of tne recent tariti act and
would operate mo;t benificially for both
the United States and Spain."
Some months further trial will be ne
cessary to determine the permanent
effect of the recent legislation on jeilver
value but is gratifying to know that the
increased circulation has exerted a most
beneficial influence upon business. Our
very large supply of gold if not lost by
impulsive legislation.
The President concurs in the recom
mendation of the Secretary of War, that
adequate and regular appropriations be
continued for coast defense works and
ordnance, and that the encouragement
which has been extended to the militia
should be continued.
Speaking of the naturalization laws
the President says: UI beg to renew
recommendation that laws be so
amended as to require more full and
searching inquiry into all facts necessary
to naturalization before any certificates
are granted. It is certainly not too
much to require that applicants shall be
heard with as much care and recorded
with as much formality as are given
c-iscs involving pettiest property rights
The construction and equipment of our
new ships for the navy has made satis
fictory progress. It is a source of con
gratulation that the anticipated in
fluence of these modern vessels upon the
o rps of officers and seamen has been
fully realized. Confidence ind pride in
the ship among the crew are equivalent
to a second battery.
The policy outlined in the last annual
message in relation to the patenting of
lands to settlers upon public domain has
been carried out in the admimist ration
of the land office. The purpose has been
to perfect the title of honest settlers
with such promptness that the value of
it might not be swallowed up by the ex
pense of extortions to which delay must
subject the claimant.
Tbe examination and adjudication of
pension claims have by reason of im
proved methods have been more in
creased than ever before. There is no
economy to the government while there

The increasing number and influence
of non-Mormon population in Utah are
heard with satisfaction. The recent
letter of the President of the Mormon
Church m which he advised his oeonle'0 "tfrvs. .L. erienee h a shoa thur
to refrain from breaking th laws of
land, has attracted much attention and
it is hoped that its effect and influence
mil vro ucutMiUl ll uui ine iaC6 bllOUld
not be overlooked that the doctrine of
the church, that polygamous marriagos
ae rightful, remains unchanged, and
President Woodruff does not renounce
the doctrine but refrains from touching
it, and advises against the practice of it.
Now it is quite time that the law should
not attempt to deal with the territory of
Utah so that those who believe po
lygamy to bo right shall not have power
to taakft it law'ul.
The President refers to his veto of
some bills for erecting public buildings:
ground appropriations therefor are
too large and recommends thorough in
vestigation and wise economy in all
cases.
Referring to tbe report of the Secre
tary of-Agriculture, tho rradCient no
tices very substantially the improvement
during the year on the market prices of
former products, particularly wheat,
corn, oats and barley. Export trade in
live animals and fowls, and dairy pro
ducts has largely increaied. On the
suujectoi tne oeei sugar lnausiry, tne
President says it has already passed the
experimental stage, and is a complete
commercial success. The area in which
it is of n-rat. vuln ia thna in thm

The President congratulates congress
and the country upon the passage at
the first session of the 51st congress of
an unusual number of laws of very
hiirh imnortanoa. H aave that th rA -
" x
suits or this legislation wiU be the
quicKening and enlargement of nianu -
lactunng industries; larger and better
market for our breadstuffs, and provis -
lons both at home and abroad, mere
for our working people and an increased
supply of safe currency for the transac
tion of business. The President;
further says: "I do not doubt that
some of these measures were
enacted at so late a period that the
beneficial efforts on commerce which
were in contemplation have as yet but
partially manifested themselves. For
many years prior to 1SSS the merchan
dise balances had been largely in our
favor, but during that year and the year
following they turned against us. It
is very gratifying to know that during
the last fiscal vear thev ahovs- r hftlan
of 8GO.000.000 in our favor. Bank ac-
counts show that increase in business
, ., ,
uuring me past year ana iauures werei
greatly reduced in numbers. The Pres-
ident says that the value of domestic
merchandise during the year excee3s
the preceding vear bvone hundred and
fifteen million dollars, aud was only ex
ceeded once in our hisVry. One hun- !
dred million of this excess was in ari- I
cultural products. The depression in
prices of agricultural products has been
greatly relieved, and a buoyant hopeful
feeling is beginning to be felt.
On tne subiect of the tariff bill adnnt-
lu . -r .
t?u iu pretend congress me resi
dent says that owing to its recent pas
sage its permanent effect upon trade and
prices is still largely a matter of oonject- j
ure. He notes that advance in certain
articles which has been partially asciib-
edtthe tariff bill was due to other I

is great interest manifested in Texas
and M oxico in the case of Mrs. McCabe,
wife of J udge McCaDe, now on trial at
Matamoras, Mexico, on the charze of
having murdered Judge Stein. The ap
peal used by Mrs. McCabe several weeks
ago for money to defend herself ia the
trial, which was published through out
tne L cited btatee, gave the case wide
notoriety. Mrs. McCabe was not allow
ed bail, but has been confined to her
bed in the cell of a Mexican prison with
severe sickness for nearly two months.
According to the testimonv on Satur

ted the deed because she had been cross

osa, Mexico, at the time of the murder,
concluded hi3 testimony yesterday. He

the town, but that she freed herself
from his grasp and ran. About an hour
later, he heard the pistol shot and rec
ognized in the assailant Mrs. McCabe.
The testimony of Vesseti caused much
excitement in the court-room, &3 it was
unexpected.

some . -epertyof the estate, and last
winU came back to see Miss Keener,

day, though not enough to render him
unstw:.ay. He went to the family resi
dence di iing the evening and a shoot
ing t..rupe ensued, concerning which
