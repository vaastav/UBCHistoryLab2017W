approves of the payment of 120,000,000, on
tho ground that so much of the Phllipplno
debt as could bo shown to have been spe
cifically expended for tho benefit of the
archipelago ought to bo regarded as au ob
ligation "running with tho land," nnd,
therefore, passing to tho grantee. Ho con
tends, howovor, that, having adopted that
prlnclplo In tho caso of tho Philippines, wo
should not havo refused to apply It in tho
fcaso of Cuba also, but should havo assumed
so much of tho Cuban debt as could bo
proved to havo been exponded for tho bet
terment of that Island. Here Is where wo
diffor from Mr. Taylor, and for tho follow
Ingieasnn:
In tho caso of Cuba wo nro not taking over
sovereignty, but aro acting simply as inter
mediaries between Spain and tho inhabi
tant of tho island who aro to acqulro Inde
pendence. Wo do not deny that a fraction
of tho 60-callod Cuban debt may havo boen
spent for tho Improvement of Cuba, though
tho fraction cannot lavo been a largo one,
for tho autonomous Government estab
lished by Governor-Goneral Blanco refused
to bo mado responsible for moro than a
fifth ot tho wholo loan.
Whatever may havo been tho size of tho
fraction which was honestly expended, our
Commissioners woro unauthorized to mako
tho futuro revenues of tho island responsi
ble therefor, for tho reason that thoytuwU
rccolvod no mandate to that effect from tho
pcoplo of Cuba, or ovon from tho insurgent
Government, whloh, by tho way, wo havo
novor rocognlzcd. All that wo woro quali
fied to do was to socuro the evacuation of
Cuba by tho Spanish forces and to establish
pcaco and order thoroln, so that, In duo
tlmo, tho inhabitants might organlzo for
thomsolvcs a regular administration. Wo
had no right to Imposo upon a State, yet
unborn, a mortgage, whether largo oremall.
Tho sovereignty over Cuba Is not vested In -us
oven provisionally, for wo have refused to
accopt it. Tho sovereignty over tho island
Is, at present, in suspension, and will re
main so until tho Cubans havo sot up a rcc
ognlzod Government.
It is for that Government, when estab
lished, to say what part, it any, of tho so
called Cuban dobt should bo regarded as
"running with tho land," having boon ex
pended for tho benefit of tho inhabitants.
For our own part, wo do not bcllovo that
tho independent State of Cuba will assumoa
dollar of tho indebtedness, which was sad
dled by Spain upon tho revenues ot tho
island. It will, doubtless, consider that
tho sums which can bo proved to havo boon
spent for Insular improvements havo been
far moro than offset by tho devastation of
Cuban property during tho Ton Tears' War
and in tho recent lnsurreotion, and by tho
massacre or starvation of several hundred
thousand reeoncentradoa.
The Political Future or the South.
Tho circumstance that tho main sourco of
tho strength of tho Democratic party Is in
tho 8outh, tho "solid South," suggests
to the Washington Post the reflection that
It is not allowed the preponderant influence
in shaping tho policies of that party
to which it is entitled. Tho South fur
nishes, according to tho Washington paper,
"most of tho brains and conservatism of
tho Domoerutlo party," yet it consents to
bo hold in an interior position, "to bo kept
put of sight ns a thing to bo ashamod of,
and tO bo used only as tho rank and fllo of
an' army which it really dominates by
virtue of numbers, intellect, and valor."
To this tho Times of IUchmond replies that
"tho South oan well afford to wait for tho
fulness of tlmo," " for tho people of other
sections to call upon one of her distin
guished statesmen to tako tho lead In
national contosts."
Boforo that tlmo comes, however, tho
South will havo to break down tho barrier
by which it has made itself a distinct "sec
tion," held together in a monotonous uni
formity of political sentiment. As it Is
now, tho Democratic solidity of tho old
secession States is a foregone conclusion.
So far as the whlto citizens aro concerned,
and by tho disfranchisement of the negroes
their control Is complete, there is praotl
cally no political opposition. All these
States are put always In tho Democratic!
column at an election, as a matter of course,
whatever bo the policies of that party.
If, for Instanco, as now seems to bo prob
ablo, Mr. BnYAN runs again In 1000 on
tho Issue of tho Chicago platform,' this
"solid South," with nil its oleotoral votes,
will bo sot down on his side at tho elec
tion without a shadow of doubt. As tho
lato election proved, States of other
parts of tho Union which sustained Mr.
Bryan in 1800 aro capable of revising
their political opinions under tho Influence
of changed conditions, new issues and
maturer consideration; but this "solid
South " remained as solid as ever and reaf
firmed its devotion to Bryanism, sim
ply becauso Bryanism is Democratic and
not Republican. Except for this undo
viatlng support from tho South, thero
would not now bo tho slightest alarm
concerning Bryanism. That menace to
American progress and prosperity would
be romoved completely woro It not for
the eleven States of tho " solid South."
Without that absolutely certain support,
tho Democratic parly would not havo
risked Us fortunes on that political horesy
in 180S, and except for that Inevitable
assistance it would havo made so con
temptible a show in tho electoral vote that
It would never havo rovivod tho issue.
Bryanism was nevor dangerous oxcept bo
cause of this "solid South,"
Because of this political Isolation of tho
eloven Southern States tho Democratio
party has been constrained to hold thom
in an interior position, "as a thing to be
ashamod of," or rather as a body of support
whose Inovltablo solidity provoked danger
ous distrust olsewhoro in tho Union. Tho
Democratio party knows that whatover
may be the position It takes, this "solid
South" will form tho ccntroof Its column
of offence, and that it does not need to
give it any other return than simply
an opportunity to vote for Its ticket.
When it is about to go Into a na
tional canvass, therefore, it can dismlas
tho "solid South" from consideration, as
ouroly on lie side under any circumstances,
and give its whole attention to the politi
cally dobatable States of tho rest of tho
Union. Nor is it disposed to load down the
party with a caudidato from a "section"
which Invites distrust and suspicion by its
unvarying political 6olldlty as a "bootion,"
whatever may bo tho difference, becauso of
froo discussion, in States whero national
issuos and not merely sectional prejudice
or intorost engngo tho publla thought.
Tho "solid South" Is not kept from
"Its proper phieo In tho conduct and
management of tho Democratio party"
by any other force thuu that of Its
own policy of remaining aloof from tho
curront of national bontlment. It per
eibts in standing by Itself, In describing
itself and thinking of itself as a distinct
"eectlun," Mh,ca rcuUy ouch political h
j ... "-,T,'. .1 iuliiT - "...
fluenco as it has concerns the welfare of tho
whole Union, fromwhfchlt Is inseparable;
and It suirora both politically nnd ma
terially as o consoquenco.
Tho intelligence of tho South must insist
on breaking down tills wall of stubborn sep
aration and Joining tho forces which nro
oarrylng forward the sentiment of Amer
icanism. Tho solidity of tho South is too
unroasonablo and too Injurious to itself to
bo kept up In tho great politics which will
broaden tho minds of tho American peoplo
from this time forth and obliterate every
trace of tho sectional division which re
calls a political period full of evil. '
Indoor Cycle Itnclng.
Tho several bloyclo races which took plaoo
In Madison Square Gardon last Saturday
night markod tho opening of tho indoor
cyclo racing season, nnd also tho tem
porary abandonment, to a largo extent, ot
outdoor cycling generally. Three weeks
ago it looked as If pleasure-seeking wheel
men would bo uncommonly numerous dur
ing tho wlntor, but tho wcathor of tho past
ten days appears to have ohllled tholr am
bition ns offootlvoly as thehnow has blocked
their wheels. Judging from tho spectators
who wero present to witness tho races on
tho opening' night, tho number of oycllsts
who profor to watch tho performances of
othor ridors in wlntor rather than to wheel
themselves is ovory bit as largo as It has
boon in tho post.
Just now tho principal object ot Interest
is tho six days' race, in which champions
from many parts ot tho globe are enlisted.
This year Hale, tho Irishman, who won tho
142-hour contest in 1800, has ono ot his
countrymen, Bbnby PrLKiNaTON, compet
ing with him. On tho same course aro to bo
found threo hardy experts from Franco,
and ono each from Sweden, Switzerland,
Australia and Canada. Twenty-two ridors
onlistodfrom different parts of tho United
States, and among thom aro Millbr, who
captured the first prize In the race last year,
and Rice, who then finished second. ScniN
neeb, who was third at tho close, and who
sucooeded in rolling off moro miles during
tho wook than Hale, Is also a participant In
the present contest, and ho appears to have
scores ot admirers.
Thcro Is a great deal of speculation as to
whothor the winner of this year's race will
oxcel tho effort ot Miller in 1807, whoso
record, after all necessary allowances had
boon mado for tho shortness of tho track,
was 1,083 miles and 883 yards. That was
about 73 miles bettor than Hale's record
of tho year boforo. As on additional stim
ulus to tho riders, a separate purso of $200
will bo given to the man who can cover a
greater number ot miles than wcro made
by Miller.
It is a llttlo too early to predict with
much confidenco what will bo the result of
the week's riding; nevertheless, If tho
splendid outward appearanco of a majority
of the contestants may be taken as an indi
cation of endurance and grit, It will sur
prise many if n,ow laurels nro not forth
coming. Much Is expected of two or three
of tho foreigners engaged In tho struggle,
but those who appreciate tho qualities of
such men as Miller and Schinneer aro
disposed to think that our visiting friends
will havo to bo contont with something bo
low (lrst honors.
Marching On.
Tho Massachusetts Antl-Imperialist
Leaguo seem Jo bo making great losses.
Mr. Charles Eliot Norton, who was
supposed to be tho most hopeless of tho
hopeless, has bowed to fate. According to
tho Boston Herald ho told some Harvard
undergraduates tho other day that " while
abating not a jot his opposition to tho
war, ho accepted tho expansion policy as
inevitable, and expressed confidenco in our
success as a colonial power, after making
some blunders and paying for thom." So
tho sternest of tho Mugwump recusants
yields and admits that tho country Is not
going to bo ruined after all.
The Botoi Herald itself, which has buckod
against destiny blindly, has had Its eyes
opened and bucks no moro. In a double
leaded editorial artlclo it rebukes the unbe
lievers and puts itself on the Amorican side :
"Ws believe It Is ridiculous to assume that this
great republic cannot govern colonies with popula
tions of any stage ot development, or that wo cannot
do it without damage to our institutions at home.
The pessimists always point to the example of Rome,
which they assume to have been destroyed because
of Its expansion policy. This is stuff and nonaense.
Why do they refuse to look to the example of Eng
land, which haa been steadily expanding for centu
ries, and at the same Uma progressing from the rule
of an absolute king to Institutions ss free as catr
own? Not pnly that, but while planting her flag all
round the world ahe his purified her politics and
her administration beyond the experience of any
other nation.
" Truo conservatism Is good, ytry good; but pessim
ism is neither good for nations nor for IndhiduuK
And a pestimlatlo American la, of all living organ
isms, most unreasonable, Wa prefer to go with the
flag, and use our beat endeavors tokeep Itstalnless."
So tho converts come, and tbe irreslstiblo
movement of Amorican progress swells and
broadens. Tbo tabernacles ot tho Mug
wumps mo shaky. Even Gamaliel Brad
roRD nnd ALAPDrif Atkinson may como in
with tho othor hostlles boforo Christmas.
Apothecurlcs and Their Clerks.
Wo publish olsowhoro ft letter from tho
Secretary of the Druggists' Leaguo for
Shorter Hours, in which ho attributes dan
gerous mistakes made by tho prescription
clerks of apothecaries to physical weari
ness duo to their long hours of work.
The law, however, cap accept no such ox
cuso for carelessness from which death re
sults, nor can the public tako it Into con
sideration as affording a shadow of justifica
tion for tho fatal blunders.
This leaguo seems to assert that such
blunders aro an Inovltablo consequence of
tho loug hours of work imposed by apothe
caries on prescription clerks. It that is so,
the public, as a necessary means ot solf
protection, must refuse to deal with such
apothecaries. If tho safoty of tho sick re
quires that the hours of theclorka should bo
shorter, so that their wits may bo always
dear, an apothecary should employ enough
of them to reduce the vtorklng tlmo for
eaoh, and it tho extra assistance costs blm
moro than he can afford ho ought to go out
ot the business. i
A movement among the apothecary
clerks for shorter hours is, therefore, In the
Interest of tho public,' If tho assertions and
inferences of the letter of our correspond
ent aro true nnd sound. By organizing
themselves, as the trades bto organized,
they may be ublo to compel a reduction
In tho hours, as tho others have dono; and it
seems from a publication of tho league sent
with his letter thut It contains uliendy
nourly 400 members, "consisting about
equally of proprietors anil clerks from tho
butter class of drug stores In the Greater
Now Yoik." Tho pioposllion, however,
thut there bhull bo special legislation to
compel tho reduction Is unsound, and it it
were heeded At Albany It would rcbult prob-

ably lh throwing many of tho clorka out of
employment. An It la, tho small apothe
caries havo a hard Btrugglotomakoallvlng,
nnd are kept at work longer than their em
ployees. Any considorablo -Incroaao in
tholr expenses would drive them out Of tho
business, and so far lessen tho domaml for
clerks, though n part of tho loss might bo
mado up in tho greater numbor shorter
hours would require for the larger shops.
Men in tho professions, and certificated
pharraaolsts are professional men, cannot
regulate their hours of employment llko a
day laborer. Thoy cannot knock off work at
a particular hour. Physicians, more partic
ularly, are liable tca cajl to severe duty at
any hour ot tho night, oven It they havo
worked bard all day, Tho""lublloatlon of
tho league, to which wo have referred,1
puts tho hours of work ot apothecaries'
clerks at fourteen on week days and flttoen
on Saturdays. Doctors who send their
prescriptions may bo at work the wbolo
twenty-four hours, with a llttlo time
hero and thero snatched for meals and
sleeping. No drug clerk's task Is so ex
hausting as that ot many a physician, yet
no oxcuso for o, false prescription, on tho
score of exhaustion, would avail tho doolor,
though the pharmacist's weariness is put
forward as a justification for blundorlng in
compounding It
This league says apothecary shops are
kept opon longor than necessary, longer
than in othor countries, becauso ot anxiety
to got trade, and that tho publlo necessity
would be served eumolontly if they closed
at the hour which Is usual with other retail
traders, and simply filled physicians' pro
scriptions In respouso to a, boll ring. That
may be true, but tho matter should bo reg
ulated by agreement of the trado rather
than spcelflo legislation.
No Go.
Tho Richmond Times, which novor ceases
its efforts to coax its party away from tho
Chicago platform, Is now trying to substi
tute opposition to expansion for free silver.
It assorts, with a convenient forgettulness
of the history of tho Democratio party,
that " imperialism is simply a now phase of
Republicanism," and declares that "it is
tho mission ot tho Demooraoy to-day, as It
was in tho beginning, to resist tho aggres
sions of this old and persistent enemy of
popular government," and so forth. Whoro
foro "tho Democratio party must stand
upon a platform broad enough for all truo
Democrats to stand upon."
It imperialism in simply a phase of Repub
licanism, the Democratio party has a good
many Republicans In It already. What, for
Instance, docs the Richmond Times propose
to do with those two distinguished Southern
Domocratio expansionists, the Hon. John
Tyler Morgan and Gen. Job Wheeler ?
Thoy are imperialists as Thomas Jeffer
bon was an Imperialist aid as the Democratio
party was an imperialist. While tho num
bor of Democrats who will not accept tho
Chicago platform is comparatively small
and Is visibly growing smallor, the number
of Democrats who bellovo In expansion, and
aro not small-minded enough to oppose It
simply becauso most Republicans beliove in
it, Is largo and growing larger. The policy
of tho Richmond Times would divide instead
of uniting tho Domocratio party.
Moreover, If froo silver, supported by
almost all tho Democratio party, is a bono
less cause, what is anti-expansion, which
ovon many of its own supporters seo to bo
an impotcntstrugglo against tbe will of the
peoplo? Not only many straight Demo
crats, but also Fusionlsts like Senator Tel
ler of tho Silver Republicans, and Senator
Allen of the Populists, are Imperialists.
Tho Richmond Times Is trying to pull the
Democratio party out of a holo by pulling
it intO'a deopor ono.
The graceful words of the President about
the services ot the Red Cross during the recent
war leave no doubt ot his opinions as to the use

A PnESDTXBBlAy ItKTIlKjLT.
A Itorann Cathollo Practice Adopted in
Protestantism.
frtm ike CAurcA EantmitU
The "retreat" Is associated In moat mlndawith
the Catholic priesthood or the ritualiatlo tempera
ment in the Episcopal clergy. But the spiritual
benefits of such a withdrawal and recess from tha
whirl of life are so obvious that of late several of
these retreats have been held by ministers of the
Presbyterian and other non-llturgtcal denominations.
Last winter, at a series of meetings held for the
deepening of the spiritual life by a group of Presby
terian pastors in the city of New York, the advisa
bility of an occasional withdrawal from the world
for a brief period of prayer and meditation waa
agreed upon, and a committee appointed to make
the necessary arrangements for such a retreat. In
pursusnee of tbe plsn determined upon, twenty-two
Presbyterian paators of the city gathered at the
Chestnuts In Elverdale an Ideal spot for such a
conference on Monday morning, Nor. 7, and re
mained In aeasioa until noon of the following
Wedneaday.
The meetings were held without a programme,
their direction being left enUrely to the Holy Spirit,
and were attended wlUi great power from the start.
Between the regular sessions hours of private prayer
wero obsened, and opportunities given for Bible
study and conference, Monday afternoon waa spent
In confession, and tbe Rev. Br. Charles Cuthbert
Hall waa asked to take charge. Hia searching ad
drees brought every msn straight In front of the
great white Throne, and revealed to him his Inner
most heart. MelUug contrition was felt on all aldea.
Every known sin was put away, and conscious of
personal weakness, as perhaps never before, the
brethren threw themselves In unreserved surrender
and consecration into tbe arms of God. In the even
ing the power of the Holy dhoat wsa sought, the
Rev. Br. S. B. Rosalter leading with what seemed to
his brethren a special anointing for the service. The
apirlt was gli en In large measure, and brought great
freedom, peace and joy.
On Tuiaday morning the Rav. Br. Wilton Merle
Smith centred the thought of the brethren upon

Mistakes In Compounding Prescriptions As
crlbetl to Their Long Hours.
To mi Uditob of The Bon Sir: Tha throe
accidoutal poisoning cases which hunponed
within the last few days, tlio details or which
aro only now coming to light, seem again to
emphaslre tho necessity of taking Immediate
legislative action to prevent, if possible, tho re
currence of such dancers to tho health and
even the life of the public.
Mistakes in tho compoundlnc of proscrip
tions aro happenlnc ovory day in Now York.
Nobody familiar with the chaotlo conditions in
the druc 'trade can consistently duny this
statement, a? well as the fact that tho clerks
who commit these mistakes often cannot help
eommlttinc thom becauso thoy are obligod to
be on duty for fourteen, fifteen or moro hours
per day.
The officers of tho Druggists' Leaguo for
Shorter Hours lmo beon itifestlgatinc threo
accidental poisoning; eases which happened
during the last two weeks. These aro tho re
sults of their o (Torts.
In the one case Mrs. A. II. Moore of 877 Sixth
aenuo had beon suHerinir from rheumatism
and an injury to her knee. She had been un
able to sleep, nnd on Nov. 15 Dr. Joseph llyrno
ot 345 ost Fifty-first street cave nor a pro
scription calling Jor morphine In raspberry
syrup and, water. After tho prescription had
been nlled at the drug storo ot George K.
Bchwelnfurth, at 806 Sixth avenue, a done of
the medicine was givon to the patient at 11
P.M. An hour later she became delirious and
Dr. Dyrno was sent for In a hurry,
When the doctor called h was alarmed at
tho appearance of tho patient, for the symp
toms were those of belladonna poisoning.
After examination he found atropine In tho
mixture, and he quickly administered an anti
dote. Only two days ago Mrs. Moore was ablo
to leave tho bed. Dr. Byrne's timely aid ba cd
the patient. The druc clerk who had mado the
mistake was dlsehatgod, though he possibly
would not have committed the mistake if his
hours of work had not made him overtired.
The second caso happoned a week ago in the
neighborhood of Ninth avenue and Twonty
thlrd street, Tho woman In this case had her
lips severely burned with chloroform llnlmont
which had been added by mistake when tho
prescription was filled.
The third ease Issald tohavo happened within
the lost ten daya on Avenue A, above Seven
tieth street. So far the league han not been
able to got tho real facts. A It Is tho practlco
of the league to publish nothing of this nature
unless it can bo fully substantiated by facts, no
details will be given out unless tliey could ho
B roved in court, If neuossary. It is but natural
tat persons responsible for such mistakes
should be retloent. Who would not be under
tbe circumstances?
In considering; coses of this nature, nu ox
asDeratod publlo should bear In mind that
nobody Is more to be blamed for theso ac
cidental poivmlnc mistakos than tho publlo.
Tho Legislature regulates tho hours or work of
other employees, beoause tho public'x health Is
Invohed. as Is tho case with bakers, railroad
men, Ac. hut the responsible position of the
druc clork Is entirely ignored.
The Coroners' ofllco contains a cood many
records which, if pioporly silted, would show
aii alarming statu ot affairs
Within tlio next two wooks It will bo deeldoil
whetherthe ten-hour bill for drug clorkswlll

The Conflict Retjrcen Col. rtoebllng'e Worn-Iros-
nnd Knglneor Martin's rteport.
To tub Eprron op Tnn ScM Sin Engineer
Hoebllna has olven his opinion ns nn expert
that tho safety ot tha Brooklyn Prldso Is not
abovo suspicion.
. Knglneor 0. 0. Martin has declared as an
oxpert that tho brldco Is "absolutely safo."
Supposing tho two Opinions to be of eaunl
vnluo, It would still be the duly of thoofOulals
In charco to Investigate further, Tho flat con
tradiction raises at least a reasonable doubt.
I venture to predict, however, that them will
bo no furthor investigation. Mr. 0. 0. Martin's
assertion will be accepted as llnul by tho
odlclnb. nnd would bo If all other onalncers
in New York should contradict him.
I say this boenuso such n course of action
would bo an exact repetition ot what has al
ready happened.
Let mo explain. On tho day of the opening
of tho brldgo to tho publlo n dozen lives wore
crushed out on n shott slnlnvay on tho
promenade, on tho hither sldo of tho Now York
tower.
I chanced to bo nenr by when tho "nocldent"
occurred, and, bolnant that time a reporter, I
made it my business to Investigate tho mattor
to tho best of my ability. My opinion was
nulckly formed. The htalrs woro ho steep and
tho lioil.-.onlnl surface ot each slop was so
narrow that tho dctcont of tho short night
called for moro than ordlnaiv caution uudor
nny clrcumstancos, and n Blight push from bo
hind would throw down any person who was
descending. As a mattor ot fact, the peoplo who
wero killed had been pushed from behind in
tho crowd nnd had beon trampled to death In
their efforts to save themsolvos.
Not boing nn export. I distrusted my own
opinion. Dolnc assigned by my city edftor to
follow up the Investltratlon of the horror. I In
terviewed moro than n score of the leading on
clnoors and architects of tho (thon ) two cltlos.
Every single Individual nnionc them con
firmed my opinion and said the stairs woro
dangerous. Pome declared thom "death
traps." as they hart In fact proved to be.
I also interviewed Mr. Martin. Ho pooh
poohed my opinion, nnd declared that tlio stairs,
steep as they wore, woro ot tho safost possible
pattern. '
It will be Impossible for me evor to forget tlio
argument ho advanced to support this state
ment. He said: "Tho majority of tho peoplo who
walk across tho bridge live in tenement nouses.
The steps they nro accustomed to. on tho stairs
In tho houses in which they live, are of lust tho
pattern of those on tho bridge. Tho steps they
are most accustomed to are the safost."
I suggested that the clrcumstancos and tho
surroundings were different on tho bridge from
what thy wore In teneniont houses, but ho do
elared that that fact did not affect tho forco of
his argument.
To mo. such talk sounded llko tho braying ot
a wild ass. but I was not an expert and am not
an expert.
In tho ton years or so. following, whllo I was
still a reportor. I talked with vory many ex
ports about this. Thoy all agreed with me.
I talked with a good many brldgo trustees.
Bomo of them were Impressed by what I told
thom, nnd said they would hnvo tho mattor
'looked lulo." Hut through all those years tho
steps remained tho Bame.
In fact. I novor knew any dictum of Mr. Mar
tin's to bo overruled by tho trustees, which is
Why I predict tlmt his word will bo accopted as
conclusive as to tho present safety of the struc
ture Nolthor Col. Hoobilnc. nor any other en
gineer, nor nny number of other engineers, can
prevail against Mr. Martin's opinion while ho
retains bis present post. And ho N the mnn
who declared the stairs which killed a dozon
people safe, "becauso thoy wero like the stairs
In tenement houses."
I nm under tho Impression that the stairs
havo been changed somewhat within tho past
two or threo years, but I havo not been on the
promenade, and I do not know.

Tribute to the Twelfth Jleglment.
Tothk Editor of Tnr Sun Sir: I venture
to call attention to the record of ono of our city
rcclmcnts. tho Twelfth Volunteer Infantry,
commanded by Col. Leonard. Its ofTlcors and
men are. It seems to mo. dcsorvlnc of special
recognition for their modost and dignified
silence in mcetlnc tho requirements of tho
service. So far as my reading of tho papers Is
a guide. It has been exceptional In this and
other rosDocts. Doubtless the misunderstand
ings and jealousies that aro inevitable in tho
dreary monotony ot camp life havo tried the
patlonce of all, but the rank and fllo have met
those troubles as soldiers should, and refused
to herald their grievances beforo the public.
As much, if not more, than any of the volun
teer regiments, tho Twelfth has bad Its
nervo thoroughly tested. It was amonir the
llrst vailed into service. The men were excep
tional In intelligence and physique, and se
lected with the utmost care by tho musterlnir
pfneor. Capt. James Parker. U. S. A., who
joined the regiment and is now Its Lloutonunt
Colonol. I road letters from many of tho men and
know soraethinc of their condition. It is no
disparagement of the other officers to say that
the present efllcienoyof the command is largely
due to the Intelligent and unremitting labor of
Col. 1'arkerln doveloplnc tho capabilities of tho
regiment Durlmrtho loner wafting at Ohlcka
maiiKa the percentage ot sickness and death in
the Twelfth was lowor thnn that of almost any
of the volunteer teglmonts which remained In
the camp fortho same length of tlmo. This fact
Is u testimony to the faithfulness of the officers,
whllo there may hnvo boen dissension. It was
lived down without lnvltluc notoriety, nnd each
trouble was met In the spirit ot loyalty to tho
service. Aftor a short sojourn at Loxlngton.
Ky., the Twelfth was ordored the llrst of last
month to Amorleus. On., where It Is now nwnit
Incacallto the uetlvo work on which it hoped
to enter olcht months ago. Wlionev er that cnll
comes tbo. regiment will provo worthy of Its
long and brilliant record, norwlll thoro bo trials

The Death Kate of the War.
To tub Editor oj? Thk BvxSir: Kelatlve to
tho death rate ot our army us oMclally reported,
Thoodoro D. Kollogg. in his communication of
Nov. 23. asks this question: "What is the uver
ace expectation of life at this acof" (Twenty
eight years was his assumption of nverago ngo
of tho army.) Tho American Table of Mortality
places it at atl.7 years ; ut ago 45 tlio expecta
tion Is 24.5 years.
As our army for tho Snanlsh war was chiefly
composed of men recently examined by oxpert
surgeons, tho mortality from dlseuso should
fall below the American tablo, every other
condition being equal. aH thoy wero selected
llvos. A wronp comparison always brings nn
Incorrect conclusion, ns Is shown when ho Inti
mates that It would tako forty-eight years for
the entire, force, to die. Mr. Kello-g would have
it appear that tho death rato was onlv "a llttlo
moro than would have occurred If all tho offi
cers und men had remained ut homo.1' Tho
death rate, ns officially j.'lven, was 10.24. Tho
Amerlenn Table of Mortality, ago IM, provides
forU'At. Itapiiears by tills that the death rate
was nearly 'J por cent, higher than ordinarily
expected, with solpctcd lives. Obviously, the
calling of n soldier is not a healthy employment
during war. H, N. 1'aikijanks.

Declines to Interfere In the ITnyerwcnther

undor the will of tho late Daniel B. Payer

act of Honry B, Vaughn, a trustee under the
will, and not tho act of Fayerweather; and
also to hold that Lincoln Unlvorslty and the
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute)
woro properly servod In the proceedings and
should be reinstated as defendants. The Su- .
preme Court by Its action to-day declined to

Tho last of tho Ions series of cases which have
como to the Supremo Court having their origin
in what is knmvn as the Contract Coupon actof
the Virginia Legislature of 1H71 was disposed
of to-day. tho onlnlou being announced by Jus
tice Browor. That act made tho coupons on
certain of the bonds of tho State receivable for
taxes, and since then the law has been retxjat
edly attacked by legislation, in an effort to
ovorthrow it, giving rise to litigation that has
engaged the attention of tho courts for a quarter
of a century. In the case at bar the Court -of
Appealsof Virginia decided the actof 1871 to
bo void. theroDy Invalidating the coupons in
question. Tho Supremo Court said this could
not stand, ai the laws upon which it was baaed
repudiated a contract which the State had pre
viously mado and was ropucnant to the Consti
tution of tho United States. The Court of Ap
peals was revorsedand tho caso eent back for

and appealed to the Circuit Court. That court
overruled tho General appraisers, but O'dered
a reexamination and rellouidatlon of duties

evidence before the appraisers fixed the pro
portion of foreign made bags at 75 percent.,
tho court was of opinion that the needs of jus
tice would bo bafct subserved by u decree re
fundlne to tlio Importer 25 per cent, of the
duties paid. And It wus so ordered.
