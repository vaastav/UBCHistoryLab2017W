If any such application for informa

4A ItPte States District Attorney for the
I Southern District of Now York it is
1 r probably on the supposition that libel

I Federal law officer in this city naturally
possess some special knowledge on
the subject
r 1 J This II a a mistake There is no
general act pf Congress which makes
libel a crime or provides for its punish

Complaint of the Architect

done to the contestants

4 2 < fa favor of them The answer of the
4 f commission unquestionably will be that I
t it has cjerclsed legal and proper dis
cretion nnd that its award IR based on
tho needs of the State It is scarcely
I llkclf to admit that it has chosen plans
I J unsuitable for tho purposes which the
buildings are to servo
i Tho scheme advocated by the New

Second Dallotlnss Venus Propor
tional Representation
Now that in some recent byelections
in Great Britain no fewer than four
nominees have been pitted against one
another representing respectively the
Liberal the Conservative tho Labor
ite and the Irish Nationalist parties
it has often that the
Ctn happened success
ful candidate success may be obtained
by a plurality one has represented
only a weakminority of the votes ac
tually polled The result ha drawn
attention to the fact that during the
last two decades in large sections of
the United Kingdom a minority may
either have had no representation at
all or a representation out of all proportion
portion to its numerical importance
For instance the Unionists in the south
of Ireland have bud for twenty years
no spokesmanin the Hot of Commons
while in Wales at the last election they
failed to win a seat although they num
bered more than 3 per cent of the I
electorate In Warwickshire on the I
other hand at tho last general elec
tion tho Liberals who were in a minor
ity obtained three out of four seats
because the Conservative majority hap
peped to b concentrated in one out
of the four divisions In the general
election of 1805 there were In Great
Britain 481 contested seats of which
tho Liberals who polled 1800000 votes
obtained 202 while the Conservatives
who cast only 1776000 votes got 270
seats
st
The remedies suggested for these
flagrant examples of injustice are first
the adoption of the second balloting
which is practised In France and Ger
many and at which a majority is re
quired and secondly proportional
representation The objection to the
second balloting i the bargaining to
which the system gives rise and which
invohc a sacrifice of political prin
ciple KARL BLIND describing in the
Nineteenth Century how the system
works admits that the resultant huck
stering does not strike him n an ideal
institution I generally goes in Ger
many he Asunder the name of Kuh
Handel cow bargaining and often
brings out the worst symptoms of in
rlguo and political immorality M
WES GUYOT declares that in France
Tho second ballots result in detestable
bargnlning which obliterate all politi
cal sense in tho electors while in the
Chamber of Deputies they foster In
ch renc both in policy and invoting
With regard t the operation of the sec
ond balloting system in Belgium a re
port made by Sir ART UR HARDIKOB
points out that it opdns tho door t
negotiations among the caucuses rep
resenting the parties whoso candidates
were unsuccessful at the first ballot
with a viow t combinations at tho sec
ond which often have very littlo to do
with political principles or oven with
general party interests
The alternative remedy is proportional
representation and t London Times
has lately undertaken by a mock ele
tion t show Englishmen hoW practicable
cable it is They would not need the
demonstration if they knew more about
what goes on in other countries Begin

nim Swiss caritona have adopted the
proportional representation method ol
election Belgium in 1809 having found
It satisfactory in the choice of munic
ipal councils applied it to Parlia
mentary elections WUrttcmborg and
Finland have Introduced jt and Sweden
has recently authorized the same step
In 1007 Tasmania enacted 1 law en
forcing proportional representation
throughout the colony The Govern
ment of Saxony has recently submitted
proposals to a similar effect and the
Dutch Government lias reported in
favor of the same reform Finally In
France the committee known a the
CommotionduSuffrage Univertel which
CQmmwindu8uINg tmt
Includes more than 250 Deputies is now
maintaining a vigorous advocacy of
proportional representation
How would the proportional repre
sentation system b mae operative in
the United Kingdom would be nec
essary in the first place that the exist
ing constituencies should b grouped
into larger areas returning several
members ench In such constituencies
each elector would havo but one vote
If such a constituency say Birmingham
returned seven members each seventh
rtue 8ve membm
of tho electors would theoretically b
able to secure u representative As
a popular candidate however might
attract to himself more than the number
of votes needed to secure his election it
is proposed that n voto should be made
transferable The elector is invited to
indicate bythe figure 2 the candidate
to whom he desires his voto to be transferred
ferred in the event of hil first favorite
votes than required
receiving more vote are rquire
to secure his return or so few a to
leave him hopelessly out of tho running
This process of transferring votes
would make it possible for the elec
tors of Birmingham t form themselves
into seven equal groups each return
ing the desired representative In
this way the large electoral divisions
would b fairly represented In Parlia
ment and the House of Commons would
be 1 faithful expression of the national
will

The outcome of the demonstration by

method of election is awaited with con
siderable interest
Mr Bonapartes Mind
No one who has followed the Hon
CHARLES J BOKAPABTES career in the
Cabinet in tho offices of Secretary of
the Xavy and AttorneyGeneral is sur
prised that Mr JAMES M BECK ex
torted from Mr BONAPARTE at the
Pennsylvania Society dinner on Satur
day night the admission that he had
changed his mind in regard t trust
legislation
Mr BONAPARTE in 1880 was reported
to have said at a conference in the Wet
to consider tho question that no legislative
lative action in regulation or restraint
of combinations whether
cmbinaton by Congress
or State Legislature is desirable Mr
BONAPARTE declared on Saturday when
Baturay
pressed by Mr BECK that he was not
present at the conference but the At
torneyGeneral confessed that at or
about that time he had sajd that eco
nomic evils should cure themselves by
economic causes He admitted that
he had chang mind since and had
been converted to euro by legislation
Into his speech on the subject at the
dinner he threw the zeal of a new
convert In the vernacular it was a
red hot speech
r sph
Mr BONAPARTES mind is obviously
not little for notwithstanding the dog
matism of his opinions he i constantly
changing it Off with the old opinion
on with the new Is his motto He was
at one time and not 8 long ag
opposed t naval expansion and over I
ready with arguments t justify him
self But who can forget the zeal with
which as Secretary of the Navy he surrendered
rendered his conviction at the dinner of
t Society of Naval Architects In tills
city on November 1000that notable
occasion when he announced the dis
covery that the navy consists of two
elements ships and men He then
made a red hot speech for 0 great
navy
Chomeleonllke the Hon CifinLES Jt
BONAPARTE seems t reflect his en
vironment Whether he is right or
wrong seemto depend upon circum
stances over which he has < no control
or t which he yields complacently In
an AttorneyGeneral this Intellectual
vacillation and reversal of conviction
must b productive of trouble They
even raise a doubt of his firm grasp of
the principles of the laws with which he
ha to deal As AttorneyGeneral Mr
BONAPARTE has been in lots of trouble
and he has made A great deal of confusion
fusion
I may be recalled that when the
AttorneyGeneral that the naval i
reserves were a part of tha organized
militia tho then Secretary of War Mr
TAFT observed that Mr BONAPARTES
construction leads t absurdity The
AttorneyGeneral does not expect t
be continued in his office after March S
He says so himself and adds that he
ha not been invited to stay

An Example of the Iron Hand on the
Kmplocr
To THB EDITOR or Tan BunflO I wl
paymaster for a construction company
with a fore of about 40 men and a monthly
payroll of 110000 or more One peculiar
feature of the work was a circular structure
oDe fifty tt In diameter of pressed brick
oruamental In Its architecture and of a
character that required the most skilful
mechanic the number of bricklayer
required being some fifty or more The
method employed was to give every appli
cant a chaho at the highest union wage
for mechanic of the olai required were
scarce and hard lo got and If he failed to
me t retirement he was paid and die
charged Thla method was employed but
a abort time before the walking delegate
made his appearance at the office and was
referred to the chief engineer of the com
pany The engineer explained to this
labor official that the men were discharged
because they were unable to perform the
character of work required and Mated
further that If the walking delegate would
send other men sufficiently akllful the com
pany would be thankful a the work 1
far behind on account of lack of bricklayer
but thla walking de1eate waved these argu
ment aside aa entirely too trivial for a
moment consideration and then said
That will not do the poor men must be
taken care of M In other word the com
pany must retain the Inefficient man and
hire another I well pay for two men In
order to get the work qf one AI a parting
hot the walking delegate delivered himself
La follow Oh you can find something else
for those men to do I any more are dis
charged a strike will bo ordered
AI a apeclal favor the engineer wa per
mitted to appear at union meetings and to
state hIs case on two occasions but the
union supported the walking delegate In
n unqualified manner A strike order
would undoubtedly have been enforced
had It not been for the fact that the brick
layer union was fighting all over Chicago
for the rato of wage which the engineer
a paying and therefore the union al
ready had large number of unemployed
brlo layer to care for Even the moat
devoted champion of labor should recog
nize that to have had It Appear In print that
the union had persecuted the company
which was paying the highest union wage
merely because the company would not
retain and pay Inefficient men would not
have been for the best Intercuts of union

An Inquiring Philosopher Discourse on
Them and the CommissIoner
To THB EDITOR OP TiE Run Hir The
man I most like to fee on the street Is the
policeman Like the soldier he Isjn pro
fetalogal man 4nd It I a positive relief to
meet somebody besides the vacant fish
or the greedy shark faced members of the
trading class There are no other classes
more necessary for the welfare of the city
no other whose ceaaatlon from work for
a week would cause such direful results
I the police tjnd the street cleaners
Why are so many scoffing remark heard
when he police are mentioned For the
following reasons among other First
jealous clan feeling The scoffers may
not think of policemen aa professional men
still there Is In them the characteristic
jealousy and envy that cause ware earners
Instinctively to hate all outside of the trade
union jurisdiction This class conscious
ness which labor traders try to foster
Is a vicious fault I Is founded on selfish
ness and prejudice and It cannot be avoided
or eradicated so long an the modern business
system exist An additional reason why
union worklngman scoff at the police is
the thought that In any labor strike they
would be delighted to break the head of
scabs and might rerelln this luxury but
for the police
I often heard Commissioner Ttlngham
same mentioned unfavorably and nflnir
ne
then I wondered I
a newcomer wondera why till
made these two discoveries A poor but
truly good woman who often visited our
family spoke one day disparagingly of Mr

The HJSJB
To TBE EDITOB or Thy jjon 6 < r The author
of Ibo article In the Spntalor on The Hymn
evidently misses some of the main aspects of the
subject The object of a hymn Is to le forth
the glory of the Triune and Incarnate ODd To
evoke feeling Is only secondarily or subordinated
the object of a hymn The feeling to be evoked
should be a calm spiritual love and In no sense
emotional excitement The matter of a hymn
should be objective even dogmatic and only
very secondarily dealing with subjective thought
and emotion The lack of force of many modem
brmnl aa compared to ancient hymns which
the writer note Is due to the exaggerated sub
Jecthlim of most modern hymns Without
question a bymn should be simple In language
and sublime In thought
Viewed by correct standards some of the hymns
the writer faults are seen to have merit For
example these lines
Fruit of the Myalla Hose
Yet of hat Hose the Stem
The Root whence mercy ever flowe
The Babe of Bethlehem
contain an accurate vet poetic statement of III
Incarnation The Eternal Word Is at once the
Fruit of the Blessed Virgin 181 Luke 1 11 and
her Creator SU John I JI He la the Hoot of
David Revelation xxll 18 and yet the Hoot
of mercy St Matthew I 21 o

That such verses have been expurgated la one
of the defects of the American hymnal

To THI EDITOR op THB BONSC The
editorial In TiE SUN of December I on the
subject of free bidet la eminently fair but
I trtut you will not object to my suggesting
the tariff on cattle
a few point relating to thetarll catte
hides
hidThe hide tariff differs radically from al
other Items on the free and dutiable l t
tthe revenue Uw The supply of bee
cattle In the United State la more than ade
tnled
quate I Ii shown by the export of several
hundreds of thousands of live cattle yearly
and the export of many hundred of thou
sands of pounds of beef The domestic
supply of cattle hide which results from the
slaughter of cattle in the United States on
the other hand fa severely Inadequate and
duty or no duty our tanner are compelled
to Import between 20000000 and 30000000
worth of hide annually
Foreign cattle hides are Imported to keep
our tanneries and shoe harness belting and
other factories employed I U not pst
his for a tarl If It were SO per cent Instead
of 15 per cent to stimulate the doraeatl
supply of hides because his could not be
accomplished without producing great qtian
titles of beef which under present condition
could not be marketed profitably
Hide and skins for several year put
have been Increasing In cost in all the mar
ket of the world This condition result
from the fact that the worlds coniumpUon
of leather Is outstripping the worlds re
quirements QUltrljpln food In recent
years the development of prepared cereal
for food the Invention of the refrlgerato
car by which fruit and vegetables can be
supplied to everyones table tbo year round
the Institution of cold storage plant by
etoraiO
which eggs jinh poultry game and vege
table can Isb pulry larger ouontllle
during the summer months and distributee
during the winter months the stocking by
the Government of streams river and lakes i
river
with ash and the scientific raising of poul
try through the use of Incubator all have
tended to change the menu of the people
lleef le n longer the great food staple that
It woj and yet tbe world Is demanding more
nd more leather
During the very years that the dvlllrei
nation nave been changing their system
hve bn
of diet Increased uses hare been made of
leather The automobile requires largi
quantities of leather more leather ts used
In the furniture Industry notonly for chairs
and sofas tables but for covering for tope of desks
In the shoe trade special designs are made
Torah sorts of purpose Every occupation
amusement and sport ha Its own specla
kind of footgear Statistics show that the
Argentine Republic 8tatltlc of cattle
to each Inhabitant whereas In the United
States there Is lee than one head to each
Inhabitant In the countries south of us
hlhsblant
the people are small consumers of leather
while we are extravagant consumers
ar OMumera
whie worlds utravIAant cattle hides Is not
too large lo fulfil the worlds requirements
for leather frll you accept this premise It
follows that every hid originating In the
9mlclvlllre countries which Ia diverted
aemlclvlre
from our ports bJ the I rif and Is shipped to
tne free porte ot Juro tends to reduce the
output of American tanneries and factories
and t 4ncreas the production of leather
foreign tanneries Thus It appears that the
tariff of t per cent on rattle hidesactual
protects the leather workers of Europe and
n hi res this class of labor In America
The United Staten Is the only civilized na
t I on that Imp I a tariff on cattle hides
although moat of the nations excepting
