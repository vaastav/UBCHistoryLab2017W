What's the use of disputing about
"love at first sight," when they say
that "love is blind."
Only the .man who is trying to live
down a bad reputation can really sym
pathize with the poor fellow trying to
live up a good one.
One thing most of us were thankful
for last Thursday was the fact that
every pleasant day makes our winter
one day shorter.
Report advises us that a harp 414
years old has been discovered in Iowa.
Perhaps it is the one which traveled
through Tara's Halls.
A London dentist says that kissing
is injurious to the teeth. He must be
wrong. Some of our prettiest girls
have excellent teeth.
A Chicago chemist lately succeeded
in extracting a deadly poison from the
air, report says. As it evidently was
Chicago air, the feat loses a great deal
of its mystery.
IT you care a rap about the comfort
of your fellow man or fellow woman,
do your Christmas shopping early.
From now on until Christmas at
least, father will not do overmuch
"hoarding."
In conection with the spread of the
prohibition sentiment, never mind fret
ting about the farmer he'll find plenty
of use for his corn. It is worth more
put into hogs of the four-legged variety
than it is in liquid form put into the
two-legged sort.
An Alabama philosopher has put the
whole liquor question in a nutshell.
He says the people have the entire
matter of the liquor traffic under their
direct control. All they have to do is
to stop drinking, all of them, and then
there won't by any traffic, and there it
is all nicely settled for all time. It
seems a very simple problem after all.
The Devils Lake Journal celebrated
Its first birthday last Monday, it being
just a year since the weekly was mer
ged into a dally. However, we haven't
seen Bloom passing around any cigars.
He might, at least, have loosened up to
the. extent of a couple of simoleons,

Farm Loans negotiated through the Union Oentral Life
Insurance Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio. Partial pay
ments permitted at any time
and made his brother editor glad at
heart. Possibly we're on the wrong
side of the fence, but—banish the
thought!
The only spirit wanting at the late
insurgent obsequies was Bill Ander
son. If Bill had been present, the
mugwump republicans would surely
have been electrified by one of Ander
son's rapid fire, pyrotechnical speeches.
Bill's long on speech-making, and in
our humble opinion, a serious mistake
was made in not appointing him a del
egate from this county. Hot air is
what the insurgents like.
It is understood that a movement is
on foot at present to give John Mitch
ell, the retiring president of the Mine
Workers union, a purse of $18,000 as
a free will offering. Each member of
the union will be asked to contribute
five cents. Wonder if Boss Winship
could be induced to retire from the
Herald under like condition, his sub
scribers each contributing. We see
them jumping and falling over each
other to do it, they love him so.
Col. Bloom, our honorable and es
teemed contemporary, pilot of the des
tinies of the Family Educator, the
Devils Lake Journal, seems to think
that we should explain the matter of
Roosevelt's issuing fresh bonds while
the treasury contained $904,000,000 in
gold. Really, we haven't room this
week, Bro! Bloom. We are printing
the president's message IN FULL, but
if you wait until next week, patiently,
patiently, mind, we will try and oblige
you.
In the meantime try and absorb the
intricate points of the money question.
We understand that William H. An
derson of this city is being talked of
as a posible candidate on the insur
gent slate for attorney general. We
will heartily commend this action of
the above mentioned wing of the sel
ection of Mr. Anderson is made, for,
in our belief, no better material than
Bill Anderson for atorney general can
be found in the state, be he insurgent
or otherwise. He is a fellow towns
man of ours, a royal good fellow and
above all, a man capable of filling the
position with credit to himself and to
the party that elects him.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We present to our readers this week
the full text of the president's message
to the Sixtieth Congress. It will be
found in section two. To say the
least, we think that the presentation
of the full text speaks well of our
paper, and is indicative of the healthy
growth and progress of the Inter
Ocean during the past To undertake
to print a sixteen page paper, within
the past few years, even, would be a
Herculean task, but with the help of
our advertisers, and oar subscribers at
large, we have been able so to do.
We feel sure that it will be appreciat
ed by our large circulation of readers.
The message is laden with good tid
ings, reports and advice as to the wel
fare of our country. Mr. Roosevelt, in
no uncertain words, says that dishon
esty must be eliminated from our in
ternational and state politics. In that,
we heartily (and who does not?) agree
ON, or about December to,
I will Open a Store in the
New Flynn Block with a
complete and Up-to-date
stock of Watches, Diamonds
£nd Jewelry* You will do
^ell to do your" Christinas
sshdpping with me,
mm* mamm
with him. He denounces monopolies,
and no one who has kept pace with
his past actions can question him in
this, child and woman labor he de
cries, and recommends the lifting of
duty on wood pulp. He says the Sher
man law, relating to interstate busi
ness, should be amended to admit of
the proper combinations of business
methods. He speaks extensively of
the currency, and says that the elastic
ity of such is a positive necessity.
The army and the navy come in for a
large share of criticism, and he recom
mends that the higher promotions be
by selection. Several new laws are
earnestly recommended.
In all, the president's mesage is a
good one, and demonstrates the author
to be not only a writer of no mean
ability, but also a profound thinker.
Don't you think so?

tobaccos, cigars and pipes.
They have been appointed city agents
of the famous Bowers—Allegretti choc
olates and bonbons, and a complete
stock of these delectable sweet-meats
are shown.
The young gentlemen start in busi
ness under most propitious circum
stances. They are both well and favor
ably known about the city, and are
immensely popular. We predict a
bright future for the Ramsey Drug Co.

Frank Kercher Begins Winter Term
as Guest of Sheriff Beltord
Frank Kercher was taken before
Judge Cowan Saturday afternoon. He
plead guilty to the charge lodged
against him—that of blind pigging, in
more elegant language, maintaining a
public nuisance. He was given a- sen
tence of ninety-five days in the county
jail. Kercher commenced to serve but
his sentence at once. He will reside
at the Hotel Belford for the greater
part of the winter, and do his best to
absorb the steam heat and the food
provided by Ramsey county. In the
case of Mrs. Mary Haight, who appear
ed before the judge on a similar charge
sentence was suspended for ten days,
in order to give the accused time to
provide a place for her two children
before beginning her jail sentence.
