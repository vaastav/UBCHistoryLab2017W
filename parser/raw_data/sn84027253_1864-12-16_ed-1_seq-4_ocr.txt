after which, Rev. Mr. Bowman, the
Chaplain, offered a fervent prayer.—
After transacting some business ofjni
Hor importance the Senate adjourned.
In the House of Representatives a
was offered up to the Throue of
race the Rev. Mr. Channing, the
able and eloquent Chaplain of that

lead it will undoubtedly appear to
morrow.
One of the first measures of vital im
portance which will come before Con
gress will undoubtedly be an amend
ment to the Constitution abolishing
slavery. The institution which has
been the bane of our political institu
tions must be gotten out of the way.—
This dark and damnable stain must be
wiped from our national escutcheon.—
The amendment was defeated last win
ter—this session it will undoubtedly be
adopted.
It is somewhat amusing to visit the
principal hotels in this city, about the
Hme Congress re-assembles. It is a
*ood place to study human nature. I
"went the rounds" this evening and
Miw nearly every one I knew in Wash
ington, and many I didn't know. Our
Iowa men are" all wide awake, for
Hawkeyes generally keep their eyes
and ears open. This evening I saw sev
eral of them on the alert for news
news of any description—political,
financial or military.
About the hardest worker I kuow of
here is your old correspondent L. D. In
gersoll, known to the reading public by
the
nome dc plume

of of'' Linkensale."'
He works seven hours a day at the
Treasury and about ten at home, giving
the other seven, as he laughingly says
himself, to "fun, sleeping, eating^md
prayer. He is well fixed for literary
labor. In very truth, I know of no one
who is better situated in that way. His
home is comfortable, having an air of
ta
ste and refinement all about it. In
his parlor are several fine oil-paintings,
one of them being a short-trowsered
.Hews-boy. That was taken while I
Was a boy, says Link. Another is a
rtrait of his beautiful little daughter
a gol leu-haired girl, between live
and six, who has taught herself to read
and write. (She writes printed letters.)
But where I like to be the best is in his
back parlor, which he calls his "den."
Here is where he used to write his let
ters for the Journal, where now he
writes for the Desmoines
Register,
and
is arranging, scissoring, studying and
writing on his "History of the Iowa
Troops."
On the walls are several eugravings.
Right above his great writing table ia a
group of four—Washington, Shakspeare,
Webster and Cooper. His table is all
mind, in reading trom books which may
have something to say bearing on mat-
\i'MVUS
I asked him how he was ever going to
get his history done, if he had so much
reading about every battle. "Well." lie
said, "as soon as Fremont and Frank
Blair get out of the way I have but lit
tle trouble comparatively. We thrashed
'em so unmercifully after that for the
most part, that even the rebel writers
admit 'reverses.'
Ijinkinsale is giving to this work great
labor, much more than any one would
be likely to suppose. But it Is all labor
of iove. He is an enthusiast on Iowa
'generally, and especially on Iowa
troops. He declares that Iowa has
handsomer girl?- better soldiers, aler
Qei. rals, liner babies, and mis'e corn to
the acre, than any other hitate i i the
Union. He has jast completed a biog
Ebphy of the lamented Ceneral S. A.
Bice, for the
Iowa Annals,

the people of our State.
But enough for the present. I have
said so much, about your old friend be
cause I wanted to do something in this
my first essay, in your columns, toward
repaying him for the many, very many,
Kind words he has there said for so
iipany Iowans, myself among the mim
