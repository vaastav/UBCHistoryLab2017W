Digest of the Annual Message of
President McKinley to the Con
gress of the United States.
LARGELY A REVIEW OF THE RECENT WAR.
The President Has Only Words of Praise
for Those Who Brought the War to a
Successful Conclusion, and Looks For
ward Contlently to the Conclusion of
Houorable Treaty of Peace with Spain.
NVashington, Dee. 5.—President Mc
Kinley's second annual message, sub
mitted to congress, contains about 20,
000 words. Following is a brief synop
sis including some direct excerpts of
the more important features of the
message:
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESEN AT1VES: Noth withstanding
the udde burdens rendered necessary by
the war, our people rejoice in a very sat
isfactory and steadily-increasing degree
of prosperity evidenced by the largest
volume of business ever recorded. Manu
factures have been productive, agricul
tural pursuits have yielded abundant re
turns, labor in all lields of industry is
better rewarded, revenue legislation
passed by the present congress has in
creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by its authors; the
finances of the government have been suc
cessfully administered and its credit ad
vanced to the flrst rank; while its cur
rency has been maintained at the world's
highest standard. Military service under
a common flag and for a righteous cause
has strengthened the national spirit, and
served to cement more closely than ever
the fraternal bonds between every sec
tion of the country.
CONTROVERSY WITH SPAIN RE
VIEWED.
In reviewing the controversy which led
up to the war with Spain, the president
takes up the thread or narrative where
it terminated in his last annual
sage. 1-le concluded: "It was honestly
-due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations of re
form to which she had become irrevoca
bly committed."
It became evident, however, that the
proposed plans were barren of good re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
reconcentrados, among whom the rate
of mortality frightfully increased; the
proffered expedient of zones of cultiva
tion proved illusory, and it was apparent
that nothing save the physical exhaus
tion of Spain or the Cubans and the prac
tical ruin of the island of Cuba could re
sult from the struggle then in progress.
DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINE.
At this critical juncture the destruc
tion of the battleship "Maine" occurred.
Concerning it the president says:
"It is a striking evidence or' the poise
and sturdy good sense u.sdnguishing
national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched oy preceding events
in Cuba, did not move them to an in
stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no
longer the existence of a condition ol
danger and disorder at
made possible such a deed, by whomso
ever wrought."
Resuming the war narrative, the presi
dent directs attention to the measures,
including the $50,000,000 appropriation for
national defense, taken
•country on a war footing, and adds: "It
is sufficient to say that the outbreak ol
war, when it did come, found our nation
not unprepared to meet the conflict."

Still animated, however, by the. hope of
a peaceful solution of the difficulty, and
obeying the dictates of duty, toe presi
dent relaxed no effort to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne

THE DECLARATION OF CONGRESS.
The result of this statement of the case
was me adoption of the memorable joint
resolution by congress, declaring the pur
pose of the United States to intervene
between the Spaniards and Cuban,
lowing swiftly upon the enactment of the
resolution, came the severence of diplo

The peace negotiatons, which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago,
and the preparation and signing *>f the
protocol, are discussed at length. Refer

"These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be able
to lay a definite treaty before the senate,

"I do not discuss at this time the gov

until the congress has legislated other

military governments which have existed
since our occupation, and to give to the
people security in life and property and

FRIENDLY WITH ALL THE REST OF
THE WORLD.
The president says that with one ex
ception of die rupture with Spain, the
intercourse of the United States with
the great family of nations during the
past year has been marked with cordiali
ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar
gentine government, initiated with a view
to removing differences in cable rate
charges imposed upon messages passing
from and to the United States, the presi
dent expresses his sincere hope for an in
ternational agreement whereby inter
change of messages over connecting lines
may be regulated on a fair basis of uni
formity. and adds: "It would be strange
were the nations not in time brought to
realize that modern civilization, whiph
owes so much of Its progress to the
nihilatlon of time by the electrical force,
demands that this all-important means of
communication be a heritage of all peo
ples, to be ad min interred and regulated in
their common behalf."
A QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUN
GARY.
As to the killing and wounding of strik
ing miners in Luzerne county, Pa.. which
aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun
garian government, many of the miners
being subjects of that government, the
president expects to reach a huruonlous
understanding on the subject with Au
stria-Hungary.
The hope is expressed that the restric
tions imposed bv Belgium on The impor
tation of American cattle will at an early
day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amer
ican cattle under proper regulations.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
The president expects that the Nicara
gua canal commission will shortly b.' able
to report finally. "1 have not hesitated
to express my convictions,"says the pres
ident, "that considerations of expediency
and international policy as between the
several governments interested in the
construction and control of an inter
oceanic canal by this route require the
maintenance of the status quo until the
canal commission shall have reported and
the United States conjress shall have
had the opportunity to pass finally upon
the whole matter.''
The president regards, in view of our
newly-acquired interests in the Pacific
ocean, the construction of such a mari
time highway as now iribre tnan ever in
dispensable.
EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
Concerning the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire, the
president says that our position among
nations gives the equitable claim to con
sideration and friendly treatment in this
regard, and that it will be his aim to

THE PARIS EXPOSITION.

exposition commissioner, the president
recommends that the appropriation for
the exhibit of the United States at the
Paris exposition be increased to $1,000,

FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.
