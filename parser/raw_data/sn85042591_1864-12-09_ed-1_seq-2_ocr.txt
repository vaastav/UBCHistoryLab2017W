PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's Message is rcedv
rd too Into fur Insertion thin week.
The offalrs of the button nre in o
good condition as could be exported
while carrying' on such ft war. The
military and fiaval departments are
reported to bo In good condition.
The national debt on the first of July
Inst nmormtod to 81,740 090, 4 Q9 49.
TrobaUy, says the President, should
the war continue another year, that
mount may be Increased by not far
Irotn five hundred millions. Held as
it is for the most part by our people,
it hut become a substantial branch of
the national though private property.
Tht part of the measnge touching
slavery is of strlkinj importance.
Tlio President recommends tho re
asnsldcrstlon and pna-ngo of the
amendment to the Coustit.ition abol
ishing 6lavory throughout the United
Slates., lie oliiiina that the result of
the election shows that tho people
woro in favor of such amendment,
and thai it Is one of th means to se
cure tho nialut;iJq.nnco oC.lho Union.
Spoaking of tho Amnesty Procla
mation be says:
A year ngo, general pardon and
amnesty, upon specified terms, were
ulicred to all except certain designa
ted enemies, and it was i t the same
timo mado known that the excepted
classes were still within ccutempla
ion of special clemency. During
the yoar many availed themselves, of
tho general provisions, and many
mure would, only that tho signs of
bad faith in some led to such proeoa
tionary measures as rendered the
practical process less cany and cer
tain. During the same time, also,
special pardons have been granted to
individuals of excepted classes nn I
to voluntary application has been de
nied. Thus, practically, the door lias
been for a full year open to all ex
cepl such as were not in a condition
to make free choice ; that is, such a
were in custody or under constraint
It is still open to all, but the time may
ccmc, probably will come, when pub
lie duty shall demand that it be
closed, and thut in lieu more vigorous
measures thnu heretotorc shall be
jidcptid.
The President says in very marked
words that bo will not go back from
the declaration ot his Emancipation
Proclamation, and that if the people
nhould change their expressed s ntl
inents on tho subject, somo other than
hi in must be their instrument. lie
declares that tho war will closo on the
pm t of tho Government when it shall
closo on tho part of those who began
it. The message closes as follows :
In presenting the abandonment of
armed resistance to tlie national au
thority, on the part of t'M iiuur
gout, as the only indespensal.le con
dition to ending tho war on tho part
of the Government. I retract noth
ing heretofore. said as to slavery.
repeat tho declaration made a year
ago, that while I remain in my pres
ent position, I shall not attempt to re
tract or modify the Kmanclpatlon
Proclamation, nor shall I return to
slavery any person who Ufrco by the
terms or that proclamation or Ity any
of the acts of Congress. If tho peo
ple 6iioui(i, iy whatever moiio or
means, mako it my executivo duty to
re-enslave sunn persons, another, and
not I, must be their instrument to
perform it. In slating a single con
dition of peace, I mean simply to say
that the war will ooaso on tho part ot
tho Government ''whenever it shall
have. ceased on the part of those who
b.'jiiui it.

TOO KIND, BY HALF.
Tho Tribune nnd ninny other pa
pers, rre ndvocntlng the pntcliing up
of a penco between tho Union and
Draoeratio parties, arguing that after
tho splendid triumph we have nchicv
ed over thnt organization we can
nfl'oid to be .magnanimous.
Excuse us. The Democratic party
of tho state of Ohio was onco offered
political 6nlvBtlon. In l?0l thollo
publican Stoto ' Central Committee
tendored them ono half of the ticket,
mid begged of them to nccopt it, to
avoid the necussity of a cunva-is that
would tend to divide the people nnd
distract their attention from the groat
work of maintaining the Government.
This proffer,' mado in perfect good
faith, wns conteinptously relucted
Vi hy ? The managers of that concern
foresaw the bui'dons that th.- war par-!
ly would hnvo to carry, and bslieved
that it would break down puder them,
nml that they could then control tho

principle trursluce. Tho main hope
of Buects.s luis been the success of the
