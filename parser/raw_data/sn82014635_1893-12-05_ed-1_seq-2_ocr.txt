Since 18S6 congress has at each session
authorized the building of one or more
vjisels, and the secretary of the navy
presents an earnest plea for the contin
uance of this plan. He recommends the
anthnrirjiiiaa of at least one battleship
and six torpedo boats. While I am dis
tinctly in favor of consistently pursuing
the policy We have of building up a
thorough and efficient navy, I cannot re
frain from the suggeston that congress
should carefully take into account the
number of unfinished vessels on our hands
and the depleted condition of our treasury
iu considering the propriety of an appro
pi iation at this time to begin new work.
The method of employing mechanical
labor at the navy yards through boards of
labor, and of making efficiency the sole
tvst by which laborers are employed aud
continued, is producing the best results,
and the secretary is earnestly devoting
himself to its development. Attention is
invited to the statements of his report in
rcgaid to the working of the system.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The secretary of the interior has the
Bunervision of so many important subjects
that his report is of special value and in
terest. THE TENSION IJOLLS.
On the 30th day of June. 1803, there were
on the peu-ioii rolls 9W5.012 names, an in
crease of S9.944 over the number on the
l oils on June 30th, 1S92. Of these there
were seventeen widows and daughters of
revolutionary soldiers, 5,425 survivors ami
widows of the war of lSl'J, 21.51S survivors
and widows of the Mexii.au war, 2,882 sur
vivors and widows of Indian wais, 284
army nurses and 473,854 eurv'vors, wid
ows and children of deceased soldiers and
sailors of the war of the rebellion. The
latter number represents those pensioned
on occount of durabilities or death lesult
ing from army aud navy services. The
number of persons remaining on the rolls
June 30, 1393, who were pensioned under
the act of June 27, 1S90, which allows pen
sions on account of death and disability
not chargeable to array service, was 459,
155. The number added to the rolla dur
ing the year wat. 123,043 aud the number
dropped was 33,090. The first payments
on pensions allowed during the year
amounted to 533,759,589 98. Thin includes
arrears, or the accumulation between the
time from which the allowauce of pension
dates and the tinro of actually granting
the certificates.
I'ESSIOJT SUSPENSIONS.
Although the law of 1890 permits pen
sions for disability not relative to military
service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a
tlisahility must exist incapacitating ap
plicants from tho performance of manuul
labor to suoh a degree as to render them
unable to earn a support. The execution
of tho law in its early stupes does not
seem to have been in accord with its true
Intention, but toward the close of tie last
administration an authoritative construc
tion was given to tho statute, aud since
that time this construction has been fol
lowed. This had the effect of limiting
the operation of the law to its intended
purpose. The discovery having beeu
made that many names had been put
npou the pension roll by means ot whole
eale and gigantic frauds, the commission
er suspended payments upon a number of
ppnsic&ns which seemed to be fraudulent
or unauthorized, pending a complete ex
amination, giving notice to the pension
ers, in order that they might
have an opportunity to estab
lish, if possible, the justice of
their claims, notwithstanding apparent
invalidity. This, I understand, is the
practice which has for a long time pre
vailed in the pension bureau, but, alter
entering upon these recent investigations,
the commissioner modified this rule so as
not to allow until after a complete exam
ination mterlereuce with the payment of
a pension apparently not altogether in
valid, but which merely has been fixed at a
rate higher than that allowed by Iay.
1 am unable to understand wny frauds
In tho pension rolls should not be exposed
and corrected with thoroughness aud
vior. Every namo fraudulently put
upon these rolls is a wicked imposition
upon the kindly sentiment iu which pen
sions have their origin. livery fraudulent
pensioner has becomo a bad citizen; every
false witness in support of a pension has
niHde perjury more common, and false
and undeserving pensioners iob the people
not only of their money, but of the patri
otic seiitiment which the survivors of a
war fought for tho preservation of tho
Union ought to inspire. Thousands of
neighborhoods have their well known
fraudulent pensioners, and recent develop
ments by the bureau establish appalling
conspiracies to establish pension frauds.
By no means the least wrong done is to
bravo and deserving pensioners, who cer
tainly ought not to bo condemned to such
associations. Those who attempt in the
hue of duty to rectify these wrongs should
not be accused of enmity or indifference to
the claims of honest veterans.
The sum expended on aecouut of pen
sions for the year ending June 30,1993,
was $150,740,407.14. The commissioner
estimates that 105.000,000 will be required
to pay pensions dunug the 3ear eudiug
June 30, 1S94.
TUE INDIAN PROBLEM.
The condition of the Iudiaus and their
ultimate fate are subjects which are
related to a sacred duty of the govern
ment and which strougly appeal to tLe
Sense of justice and tho sympathy of our
people. Our Indiaus number about 24?.
1)00 Most of them are located on 101
reservations containing SG 110,531 acres of
land. About 110,000 of these ludians have,
lo a largo d-gree, adopted civilized cus
lomf. L.mds in severalty Have been al
lotted to many of them. Such allotments
have been made to 10,000 individuals dur
ing the last fiscal year, embracing about
1,000.000 acres.
Th-5 number of Indian government
ichools open during the year was 195, an in-rreu-e
of tuelvt- over the precediug year.
Of this total 170 were on reservations, of
which seventy-three were boarding schools
and ninety-seven were day schools.
Twenty boarding schools aud five d.iy
pchools supported by the government
were not located on reservations. The'
total number of Indian children enrolled
during the vear as attendants of all
t-chools was 21,133, an increase of 1,231 over
tho enrollment for the previous year.
I am sure that secular educition and
moral and religious teaching must bo im
portant factors in any effort to save the In
dian and lead him to civihzatiou. I be
lieve, too, that therelinquishmentoftrib.il
relations and the holding of lauds iu sever
alty may, in favorable conditious, aid the
consummation. It seems tome, however,
that allotment of lsnds in severalty ought
to be made with great care and circum
spection. If hastily done before the In
dian knows its meaning, while yet ho has
little orno idea of tilliuga farm and no
conception of thrift, there is great danger
that ii a reservation lite m tribal relations
may be exchanged for the pauperism of
ctvilizntiou instead of Its independence
and elevation. The solution of the iudian
problem depends very laruelv upon good
administration. Ttie personal fitness of
agents and their adaptability to the pecul
iar duty of canug for their wards is of the
utmost importance. The law providing
that, except iu especial cases, army officers
hball bo detailed as Iudinn m.n, ?r c
koped, will prove a successful expetitneut.
Xhere u danger of great abuses creeping
into the prosecution of claims for Indian
denredations, and I recommend that every
possible safeguard be provided Hgainst the
enforcement of unjust and fictitious
claims of this description.
The appropriations on account of the In
dian bureau for Hip vcir ending June 3,
1891, amount to 7.954,9S'i.99, a decrease, as
compared with the year preceding it of
5337,131.03.
THE OUTLET OPENING.
The vnst area of land which but a short
time go constituted the public domain U
rapidly falling into private hands. It is
certain that in the transfer the beneficent
intention of the government to supply
from its domain homes for the industrious
and worthy homescekers is often frustra
ted. Though the speculator who stands
with extortionate purpose between the
land office and those who, with their fam
ilies, are invited by the government to set
tle on the government lands is a desDic
able character, who ought not to be toler
ated, yet it is difficult to thwart his
schemes. The recent opening to settle
ment of the lauds in the Cherokee outlet,
embracing an area of 0,500.000 acres, not
withstanding the utmost care in framing
the regulations governing the selection of
location'., and notwithstanding the pres
ence of United States troops, furnished an
exhibition, though, perhaps, in a modified
degree, of the mad scramble, the violeuee
and the fraudulent occupation which have
accompanied previous openings of public
lands. I concur with the secretary that
these outrageous incidents c.mnot be en.;
tirely prevented without a change in the
laws on the subject, and I hope his recom
mendations in that direction will be favor
ably considered.
forestry
I especially commend to the attention of
the congress the statements contained in
the secretary's report on forestry. The
time has come when efficient measures
should be taken for the preservation of our
forests from indiscriminate destruction.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
The report of the secretary of agricul
ture will be found exceedingly interest
ing, especially to that pait of our citizens
intimately concerned in agricultural oc
cupations. On tue ninth day of March,
1S93, there were upon its pay rolls 2,430
employee. This dumber has been reduced
to 1.S59 persons. In view of a depleted
public treasury Rnd the imperative de
mand of the people for economy in the Ad
ministration of their government, the
secretary entered upon the task of ration
ally reducing expenditures by eliminating
from tho pay rolls all persons not needed
for an efficient conduct of the affairs of
the department. During tho first quarter
of the preseut year the expenses of tho de
par' ment aggregated 345,87G 70 as against
$402,012.42 for the corresponding period of
the uscal year ending June 30, lb'J3. The
secretary makes apparent his intention to
continue this rate of reduction, by sub
mitting an estimate for the next fiscal
year loss by $394280 than those for the
preseut year. Among the heads of divis
ions iu this department the changes have
been exceedingly few. Three vacancies
occurring from death and resignations
have been filled by tho promotion of as
sistants in the same divisions. These pro
motions of experienced and faithful as
sistants have not only been iu the inter
est of efficient work, but have suggested
to those iu tho departments who look for
retention and promotion that merit and
devotion to duty aio their bess reliance.
BUREAU OF ANIMAL IKDUSTKT.
The amount appropriated for tho bureau
of animal industry tor the current fiscal
year is 850,000, and the estimate for the
ensuing year is 700.000. The regulations
of 1S92 concerning Texas fever have been
enforced during the last year, aud the
large stock yards of the country have been
kept free from infection. Occasional local
outbreaks have been largely such as could
have beeu effectually guarded against by
the owners of the affected cattle. While
contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has
been eradicated, animal tuberculosis, a
disease widespread and more dangerous to
human life thau pleuto-pneumouia, is
still prevalent. Investigations have been
made during tho past year, as to the means
of its communication and the method of
its correct diagnosis. Much progress has
been made in tuis direction by the studies
of tho division of animal pathology, but
tho work ought to be extended iu co-operation
with the local authorities until the
danger to human life is reduced to a mini
mum. Tho number of animals arriviug
from Canada during the year and inspect
ed by the bureau officers was 402,092 and
the number from transatlantic countries
was 1.2S7. No contagious diseases wore
found among the imported animals. The
total number of inspections of cattle for
export during the past fiscal year was 011,
253. I join tho secretary in recommending
that hereafter each applicaut for the
position of inspector or assistant iuspector
in the bureau of animal industry ba re
quired, as a condition precedent to his ap
pointment, to exhibit to the United States
civil service commission his diploma from
au established regular aud reputablo vet
erinary college, aud that this bo supple
mented by such au examination in veteri
nary science as the commission may pre
scribe. EXPORTS.
The exports of cattle show a falling off
of about 25 per cent from tho preceding
year, the decrease occuring entirely iu the
List half of the year. This suggests that
the falling off may have beeu larirely due
to an increase in tho price of Amencau ex
port catllo during tho year ending Juno 30
1S93.
The exports of Inspected pork aggregat
ed 20,077,410 pounds as against 3S.452.S74
pounds tor the preceding year. Tne fall
ing off of this export was not confined,
however, to inspected pork, the total quan
tity exported for 1892 being G65.4U0.0lG
pounds, while iu 1S93 it was only 027,308,
075 pounds.
The exports of. agricultural products
from the United Statos for the fiscal year
'ending June 30, 1S92, attaiued the enor
mous figure of $SOQ,000,000 in round num
bers, 7S.7 per cent of our total exports. In
the last fiscal year this aggregate was
gteatly reduced, but nevertheless reached
5013,009.000, being 75.1 per cent of all
American commodities exported.
A review of our agricultural exports,
with special reference to the uestination,
will show that iu almost every hue the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ire
laud absorbs by far the largest proportion.
Of cattle the lottl exports aggregates in
value for the fiscal vear ending June 30,
ISiW, $25,000,003, of which Great Britain
took ?23.000,0v0. Of beef products of all
kiuds our total exports were $28,000,000, of
which Great Britain took $24,000,000. Of
hog products the total imports were $.0,
000 000, of which Great Bntnin took $5.5,
000,000. Iu breadstuffs, cotton and minor
products, like proportions sent to the same
destiuatiou are shown.
FAU1I STATISTICS.
Tho work of tho statistical division of
the department of agriculture deals with
all that relates to the economies of farm
iug. The main purpose of its monthly re
ports is to keep the farmers informed as
fully as possible of all matters having aay
influence upon the world's markets, iu
whicu their products find sale. Its publi
cations relate especially to the commercial
side of farmius. It is therefore of pro
found importance and vital concern to the
farmers of the United States, who repre
sent one-half of our population, and also
of direct interest to the whole countrv,
that tue work of this division be effi
ciently performed and that the informa
tion it hiis gathered oe promptly diffused.
It is a matter for congratulation to know
that the secretary will not ajiare any ef
fort to make tills part of his work thor
oughly useful.
TREE GARDEN SEED.
In the year 1S39 the congress appropriat
ed $1,000. to be taken from t..e patent
ofllce lutids, for the purpose of collectiuc
aud distributing rare and improved
varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agri
cultural investigations and procuring agri
cultural statistic. From this small be
ginning the seed division of the depart
ment of agriculture hi grown to its pres
eut unwieldy aud unjustifiably extrava
gant proportions- During the last fi-cal
year the cast of seeds purchased was $03,
546C1. The remainder of an appropriation
of $183,000 was expended in putting them
up and distributing them. It surely never
couiu nave entered the minds ot tho;
who first sanctioned the appropriation of
public money for the purchase of new and
improved vorieties of seeds for distribu
tion that from this would grow large ap
propriations for the purchase and distri
bution by members of congress of ordinary
seeds, bulbs and cuttings which are com
mon in all the states aud territories, and
everywhere easily obtainable at low prices.
In each state and territory au agricultural
experiment station has been established.
These stations, by their very character and
name, are the proper ageucies to experi
ment with aud test new varieties of seeds,
and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful
distribution by legislation and legislators
continues, answering no purpose, unless it
be to remind constituents that tneir repre
sentatives are willing to remember them
with gratuities at public cost.
Under the sauction of existing legis
lation there was sent out from the agri
cultural department duriug the last fiscal
year enough cabbage seed to plant 19,200
acres of land. a sufficient quantity of beans
to plant 4.000 acres, beet seed enough to
plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn enough to
plant 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed
to cover 2,023 acres with vines, and enough
muskmelou and watermelon seeds to
plnt 2,075 acres. The total quantity of
fio.ver and vegetable seeds thus distrib
uted was contained iu more than 9,000,000
packages, aud they were sufficient, if
pl.tnted, to cover 89,090 acres of land.
In view of these tacts, this enormous ex
pendituie without legitimate returns or
benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipa
ting a consummation so manifestly in the
interest of good legislation, more than
$100,000 has beeu stricken from the estimate
made to cover this object for the year end
ing JuueoO, 1893, aud the secretary recom
mends that the remaining $33,000 of the
estimate be confined strictly to the pur
chase of new aud improved varieties of
seed, aud that these be distributed through
the experiment stations. Thus the seeds
will be tested, aud after the test has beeu
completed by the experiment stations the
propagation of tho useful varieties and
the rejection of tho valueless may safely
bo left to the common sense of the pe'ople.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The continued intelligent execution of
the civii service law and theincteasiug ap
proval by the people of its operation are
most gratifying. The recent extension of
its limitations and legulntions to the em
ployes at tho free delivery postoffices,
which has been honestly and properly ac
complished by the commission, with the
hearty co-operation of the postmaster gen
eral, is au immeusely important advance
in the usefulness of the system. lam, if
possible, more thau ever convinced ot the
incalculable benefits conferred by the civil
service law, not only iu its effectjpn the
public service, but also, what is even more
important, in its effect iu elevating the
tone of political life generally. Tho
course of civil service reform iu this
couutry is instructive aud interesting. It
illustrates how strong a hold a movement
gains upou our people which has underly
ing it a seyitimeut of justice and right, and
which at thu same time promises a better
administration of their government. The
law embodying this reform found its way
to our statute boolcs more from fe.ir of the
popular sentiment existiug iu its favor
than irom any love for the reform itself
ou the p.irt ot legislators, and it has lived
aud grown aud nourished iu spito of the
covertjas Well as open hostility of spoils
men, and notwithstanding the querulous,
impracticability of many eelf-con-stituted
guardians. Beneath all ';he
vagarits and sublimated theories
which are attracted to it there underlies
this reform, a sturdy common sense prin
ciple, not only suited to inis mundane
sphere, but whose aDplicatiou our people
are more and more recognizing to ba ab
solutely essential to the most successful
operation of their government, if uot to
its perpetuity.
It seems to me to be entirely incon
sistent with the character of this reform,
as well as with its best mforcetnent, to
oblige the commission to rely lor clerical
assistance upou cleiks detailed from other
departments. There ought uot to be such
a condition iu any department that clerks
hired to do their work there cau be spared
to habitually work at another place, aud
it does not accord with a sensiblo view of
civil service reform that persons should
be employed on the theory that their
labor is necessary in one department,
when, in point ot fact, their services are
devoted to entirely different work in an
other department. 1 earnestly urge that
the clerks necessary to carry ou the work
of the commission be regularly put upon
its roster, aud that the system of obliging
the commissioners to rely upon the
services of clerks belonging to other de
partments bo discontinued. Thi ought
not to increase the expense to the govern
ment, while is would certainly be more
consistent and add greatly to the efficiency
of the commission.
ECONOMY IN EXPENDITURES.
Economy in public expenditure is a duty
that canuot be houestly neglected by those
intrusted with the control of money
drawn from the people for public uses. It
must be confessed that our apparently
endless resources, the familiarity of our
peuple with immense accumulations of
wealth, the growing sentiment among
them that the expenditure of public
money should iu some manner be to their
immediate aud personal advantage, the
indirect aud almost stealthy mauner iu
which a large part of our taxes are ex
acted, and a degenerate seuso of official
accountability, have led to growing ex
travagnnce in goyernmeut appropriations.
At this time, when a depleted public
treasury coutronts u-, when many of our
people are engaged in a hard struggle for
the uecessities of life, and when forced
economy is pressing upou the great masses
of our countrymen, I desire to urge with
all the earnestness at my command, that
congressional legislation be so limited by
strict economj as to exhibit an apprecia
tion of tho condition ot the treasu3',and a
sympathy with the straitoueJ circum
stances of our fellow citizens. Tho duty
of public economy is also of immense im
portance in its intimate and necessary re
gulation to the task now in hand of provid
ing revenues to meet government expend
itures, aud yet reducing the people's bur
den ot federal taxation.
TARIFF REFORM.
After a hard struggle tariff reform la
directly before us. Nothing so important
claims your attention, aud nothing so
clearly presents itself as both an oppor
tunity and a duty; an opportunity to de
serve the gratitude of our fellow citizens,
and a duty imposed upon us by our oit-re-peated
professions, and by the emphatic
mandate of the people. After full discus
sion our countrymen have spoKen iu favor
of this reform, and they have confided the
work of its accomplishment to the bauds
of those who are soleniuly pledged to it.
If there is auything in the theory of rep
resentation iu public place, of ttie people
and their desires; if public officers are
really servants of the people, and if polit
ical promises and professions have any
binding force, our failure to give relief so
long awaiteJ will ba sheer recreancy.
Nothing should intervene to distract our
attention or 1i-tnrb our effort uutll this
reform is accomplished by wise and care
ful legislation. While we should staunch
ly adhere to the principle that only the
necessity of revenue justifies the imposi
tion of tariff duties and other federal tax
ation, aud that they should be limited by
strict economy, we cannot cIoe our eyes
to the fact that conditions have grown up
among us which, in justice and fairness,
call for discriminating enre in the dis
tribution of such duties and taxation as
the emergencies of our government actu
ally demand.
FREE RAW MATERIALS.
Manifestly, it we are to aid the people
directly throach tariff r form, one of the
most obvious feature should be a reduc
tion in the present tariff charges upon the
necessaries of life. The benefits of such a
reduction would bo palpable, and substan
tially seen and felt by thousands who
would be better fed, better clothed and
better skeltered. These gifts suould be
the willing benefactions of a. govcramost
w hose highest function is the promo' ion of
the welfare of tlia neooie.

be open to our national ingenuicv asid j doctrine that it is our duty to overturn
energies. This cannot be while federal government we bare recacaizsd in order

high tariff, forbids to Amsricaa man n fac-1 theory -we oaght to iosuiutfy restore

that the enhancement of the price of our
manufactured products resultiug from
this policy not only confines the market
for these products within our own borders,
to the direct disadvantage of our manu
facturers, but also increases their cost to
our citizens. The iuterests of labor are
certainly, though indirectly, involved in
this feature of our tariff system. The
sharp competition and active strug
gle among oar manufacturers to
supply the limited demand for
their goods soon All the narrow market
to which they are confined. Then follows
a suspension of work in mills and factories,
a discharge of employes, and distress in the
homes of our workingmen. Even if the
ofteu-dLsproven assertion could be made
good that a lower rate of wastes would re
sult from free raw materials aud low tariff
duties, the intelligence of our workingmen
leads them quickly to discover that the
steady employment permitted by free raw
materials is the important factor in their
relation to tariff legislation.
THE WILSON BILL INDORSED.
A measure has been prepared by the
appropriate congressional committee em
bodying tariff reform on the lines herein
suggested, which will be promptly sub
mitted for legislative action. It is the re
sult of much patriotic aud unselfish work,
and I believe that it deals with its subject
as consistently and as thoroughly as exist
ing conditions permit. I am satisfied that
the reduced tariff duties provided for in
the proposed legislation, added to exist
ing internal revenue taxation, will in the
near future, though perhaps not immedi
ately, produce sufficient revenue to meet
the needs of the government.
The committee, after full consideration
and to provide against a temporary defi
ciency which may exist before the business
of the couutry adjusts itself to the new
tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in
the plau a few additional internal revenue
taxes, including a small tax upon incomes
derived from certain corporate invest
ments. These new assessments are not
ouly absolutely just and easily borne, but
they have the further merit of being such
as can be remitted without unfavorable
busiuess disturbance wheuever the neces
sity of their imposition no longer exists.
In my great desire for the success of this
measure, I can uot restrain the suggestion
that its success cau only be attained by
meaus of unselfish counsel on tho part of
tue friends of tariff reform, and as a result
of their williugness to subordinate per
sonal desires aud ambitions to the general
good. Tne local Interests affected by the
proposed reform are so numerous aud so
varied that if all are insisted upon the leg
islation embodying tho reform must inev
itably fail.
4 CONCLUSION.
In conclusion, my iutense feeling of re
sponsibility impels me to invoke tor the
manifold interests of a generous and con
fining people the most scrupulous care,
aud to pledge my willing support to every
legislative effort for the advancement of
the gieatness and pro-perity of our beloved
couutry. Grover Cleveland.
COMMENT.
"Washington. Dec. 4 It is not often
that the public awaits a president's mes
sage with the intense interest which has
been manifested in the document sent to
congress today. The views of members of
the house and senate are therefoie, perti
nent and iuteros'.ing at this time.
Ex-Speaker Reed said: "I dislike to
comment on the message, because it
would not be seemly to do it iu adequate
terms. It is exceedingly disappointing,
both in matter aud manner. It is largely
made up of a wearisome resume of the re
ports of his secrotaries, which they have
hardly improved by condensatiou. That
part of the message which relates to the
tariff is the most surprising. Ic asserts
that the house committee iu charge of thai
subject has formulated plans aud devised
methods of taxation which, as a member
of the comuiittee, I have not even heard
proposed. How long lias it beeu a part of
our system that a committee of an iu
depeudant branch of the government aud,
above all, the committee controlling the
purse, shall report to congress tniuiigh
the president? Is this the result of the
rumored blending of appointive with leg
islative powetf It is bad enough to have
a tariff bill made up by a little coterie a
political bill, ns Wilson calls it but to
bava it communicated to tbe president
even before it reaches the committee, still
less the house, shows a determination to be
moved by no facts and modified by no
aeguuieuts, which makes apparent the ab
surdity of appoiuting Republicans on the
ways aud means committee."
Mr. Springer of Illinois, chairman of the
last committee on ways and means, said:
"Iu reference to the tariff the message is
clear aud forcible. Iu this the message
will receive the cordial commendation of
every Democrat iu the laud, and of mauy
otJhers who realize that our present pro
tective system is injurious to the best iu
terests of the people. In refereuce to the
carreucy the president very hopefully an
ticipates that a survey of the situation
after public confidence is restored will
lead to a permanently sound currency.
In leference to Hawaii the president takes
the ouly course cousistent with interna
tional honor aud comity."
Mr. McCrenry of Keutucky, chairman of
the foreign affairs committee of tho house,
said: "It is an able and appropriate docu
ment. I think his recommendations gen
erally good."
Mr. Dolliver of Iowa: "Tho message
lacks nuy satisfactory expression. The
president's language is wanting in defluite
ness, aud ho makes no preteuse of leader
ship of public opinion. He seems to have
exhausted his power of leadership in the
midsummer attack on the interests of
silver."
Chairman Wilson of the was's and
means committee: "The message is all
right. He is especially right on the
tariff."
Mr. Cobb of Missouri: "I am heartily
in accord with the message and its con
clusions." Mv. Gear of Iowa, a member of the com
mittee on ways and meaus of the house:
"The president says that he will restore
Liliuokdlani. gives the majority of the
ways aud means committee away on the I
income tax, and agrees with Hancock that
the tariff is a local issue, and asks the
oeople not to kick.-'
Mr. Bynnm of Indiana, a member ot the
ways arid means committee of the bouse:
"It is a very concise but clear statemeut of
the multitude of questions congress will
be called upon to consider. The principal
views meet by unqualified approval."
-Mr. Pickler of South Dakota. "The as
sertion of the president that ther are
great aud gigantic frauds iu connection
with the pension rolls aud a Inrge number
of fraudulent pensioners upon the roll is
wholly unsubstantiated and without
proof'
Air. Bontelle of Maine: "It is the first
exeenuve document which has directly
impugned and charged malfeasance m
office, and practically treason, upon a
Uuited States minister, against whom
nothiug was charged by the administra
tion up to the time his resignation was
accepted."
Senator Yborhees: "In the m"in, the
message is a sound, strong document. I
have not eximiued it critically and can
uot go into details."
Senator Palmer: "The president goos
more into detail than usual with him.
The suggestions are generally in the line
of Democratic thought. I have no especial
objections to what he .says regarding
peusion but have au idea that his im-
uressions are wide of the mars concerning
fraudulent pensions."
Senator Kyle: "There is nothing strik
ing in the message, though is contained
some good points."
Senator liawley: "The message lacks
vigor and is a disappointment."
senator Dubois: "It i lacking ia
force, strength and Americanism, and
mu.-t be a great disappointment to the
couutry."
Senator Jones of Nevada: "The mes
sage contains no suggestion or recom
meadaUoo which holds out any hope for
iirer white me presecs administration is
in powsr."
Stsatoa Lodge: Most of the mes.ae i
ws taken up with perfectly barcilrss ran-1
revolution, ought now to restore us by
force if necessary, to England. The
recommendation in regard to the civil
service commission and an increase in the
clerks for that service is ia every way excellent-"
Senator Hoar: "It was a most remark
able message in several respects. It treats
the most important questions feebly and
briefly. The imputation of the president
concerning civil service reform, to the
effect that the law was enacted because of
fear of public opinion, and uot because of
the conviction of the legislators who en
acted it, is without precedent. This re
flection comes with ill grace from a presi
dent who has dealt as the existing presi
dent has dealt with the consular service of
the United States, without even takiug
the advice of his secretary of state, and
whose appointment of Yan Alen has been
such an offensa to the country's sense of
decency."
A number of other senators, most of
whom were Democrats, decliued to express
views. Among these were Messrs. Sher
man of Ohio, Mills of Texas, tmesof Ar
kansas and Cockrell of Missouri.
APPROPRIATION ESTIMATES.
"Washington, Dec. 4. The book of esti
mates for appropriations for the fiscal
year 1S94-95 was sent to congress today.
The amount estimated to be necessary to
carry on the government for tho fiscal
year is $11,S79,041, us against estimates

ations forlS94 of ?432.4o6,52G. The esti

843; departmeut of labor, $101,870; depart
ment of justice. ?6,273 343.
For investigating peusion cases $500,000
are asked, agaiust $200,000 appropriated
for the present fiscal year. In tne pension
appropriation the principal changes are a
reduction of $5,000,000 for pension pay
ments, au increase ot $1,000,003 for fees
aud expenses of examining surgeons, and

$133,000 for the present year.
Under the head of DUblic works SL,Ck7,.
315 is asked, against $050,500 for the pres
ent year. A quarter of a million of this

as against $015,000 appropriated for that
purpose for the present year. The esti
mated appropriation for the support of
soldiers' homes is increased from $2,378,563
to $2,530,131.
THE NATIONAL BANKS.
Washington, Dec 4 The anuual re
port ot Comptroller Eckels shows that
3,790 national banks are in operation, with
a capital stock of 095,538,120, represented
by 7,450,000 shares, held by 300,000 share
holders. The total resoutces of the banks
at the last report were $310.93G.4S2. The
circulation on Oat. 31 was $209,311,999, a
net inciease during the year of $3S,SSG,972.
During the year 119 banks were organ
ized, with a capital stock of $11,239,000.
Witniu tho same period 158 bank- sus
pended, with a capital stock of $30,300,000.
Of this number eighty-six, with a cnpital
stock of $18,205,000, resumed, and elghty
Gve passed into the hand- of receivers,
with a capital stock of $10 SS3.OO0. At the
close of the year seven remained in charge
of examiners pending resumption. The
aggregate liabilities, compared with those
of Sept. 30. 1892, were $-40,531,013 less.
Speaking of tne resumption of failed
banks, the comptroller says: "In no in
stance has a bauk been permitted to re
sume on money harrowed, or for which, as
nn association, it became liable. When
ever those active in the management of
banks resuming, either as executivo
officers or directors, havo been debtors.
their indebtedness has been paid or
secured, aud whenever an impairment of
capital stock existed, such impairment
has been made goon. Onegeneral criticism,
however, to be made ou the management
of these banks was an improper distribu
tion of their loans, a circumstance which
greatly retarded the couversiou of such
loans into c.isu, and thereby causiug the
suspension."
On the matter of clearing house ccrtifl.
cates i-sued in the east during the recent
panic the comptroller says: "In no in
stance were these certificates designed to,
nor did they, circulate as money. They
were but due bills, and their sole function
consisted in discharging obligations at the
cleariug house. Their issuance at so early
a date of the derangement of the country
was most opportune, lu not only prevent
ing au ncnte panic, but iu tending to re
store public confidence, such action
demonstrating that by mutual agreement
the weak banks of the association would
be, so far as depositors and creditors were
concerned, as strong as the strongest."
After recommeuding a number of
amendments to the present law, the comp
troller says: "Upon the subject of cur
rency legislation the public good will be
best subserved at this time by making no
radical change ia the provisions of tiie
law as it now stands so far ai it pertains
to the Lssuing of the currency."
The comptroller concludes: "Tho finan
cial situation of the past months was not
tho result of either lack in the volume of
currency, of which there is a plethora, or
wnntof elasticity in the present system of
issuing it, out it arose irom a io ot con
fidence on the part of the peoplo in the
solvency of the distinctively monetary in
stitutions of the country. Iu view of the
fact that, there is now a very great abun
dance of unemployed currency in the
country, it would seem that -whatever
need appeared como months since for en
larging to any marked cxtont tho circu
lating medium has now ceasee to exist."

sessiou of the Fifty-third cougress con
vened at high noon today, pursuant to
the constitutional provision. "The inau
dible and noiseless foot of Time" had ap
parently tripped lightly through the lives
of the senators during the brief vacation
period, and brighter faces greeted one
another than when, thirty odd d,ys ago,
tired, and showing sigus of a parliamen
tary struggle uuequaled in the history of
the government, the representatives of the
states left the national capital. All trace
of that memorable battle seemed effaced,
and the greetings between tha senators
bore evidence of warm fraternal friend
ship and personal regard. The chamber
presented a handsome appearance. Ou
some of the desks were floral designs and
flowers, whose Iragrance sweetened the
atmosphere and lent an additional charm
to the scene. In the galleries a large
crowd had gathered to witness the open
ing. Ab tho clerk anuounced the hour of
12 the blind chaplain was led to tho vice
president's dek, aud, after nn eloquent
prayer, while the senators present iu the
chamber remained standing. Vice Presl
dent Stevenson called the senate lo order.
At the suggestion of Mr. Sberiurtu th
roll of the senate was called, and iif ty-six
senators responded.
The usual resolution notifying the house
of the meeting, and a resolution for a com
mittee of two senators to join a similar
committee from the houte, to wait upou
the president aud Inform him that cou
gress was assembled and ready to receive
auy commuuicitiou that he might desire
to make, were offered and agreed to.
Messrs. McPherson and Suermau were
named as the committee ou the part of the
senate.
After a resolution had been adopted that
the hour of daily meeting of the senate
shall be 12 o'clock, ou motion of Mr. Har
ris, the senate took a recess at 12:10 o'clock
for one hour, to euable tho committee to
wnit on the president.
At the expiration of the recess, at 1:10
o'clock, the senate resumed the sessjou,
aud a message was itceived from the
house, informing the senate that a quo
rum of the house was present and of the
appuiutmeut of a committee to jitu a
similar committee from the senate lo wait
upon the president. Then auoiher recess
of twenty minutes was taken.
Promptly at 1:30 o'clock they resumed
the session, aud Mr. McPhersou of the
committee to wait upou the president ap
peared at thu bar of tho senate aud an
nounced that the president would imme
diately commuuicate with the senate in
writing. Secretary Prudeu at ouce step
ped forward with the mesage aud it was
laid before the senate by the vice presi
dent, who directed that it be read. Secre
tary Cox tneu began the reading of the
message.
AH present, with a few exceptions, gave
close atteution when the reading was be
gun. There was a general changing
about in the seats of the senators when
the portion of the document dealing with
Hawaii was approached. Mauy senators
had, however, anticipated the secretary's
reading by turning in their priuted copiea
to this portion, so that few of thern ip
pearently ob-erved that the page contain
ing the president' brief communication on
Hawaii was turned without being read by
the hecretary. Mr. Kyle was one of the
few who followed the reading sufficiently
close to observe the omission, and he
called ateention to the oversight by bend
ing up h note to the vice president.
Alter this incident there was an evident
falling off In interest on the part of the
senators, attention being briefly revivrd
when the pharagraph concerning bonds
was reached. When this paragraph was
passed the senators gradually left their
seats aud drifted out into the cloak rooms,
so that by the tune the reading hud been
ttvo-thirds concluded there were only
twenty-five senators In the chamber, and a
majority of these wero engaged iu con
versation among themselves.
The rending of the message wa con
cluded at 3 o'clock, having occupied ap
proximately one hour aud a half.
Mr. Dolpli of Oregon immediately aroe
and said that there had been distributed
ia the senate a printed copy of what pur
ported to be the message ot the president,
in which, on page nine, he found part of h
page devated to'Hawaii. He did not bear
that portion read from the desk, and he
desired to know, and thought the country
did also, whether that part ivm inadver
tently oi purpoeiy omstt-u by tho secre
tary, or whether the copiea wmch had
beeu circulated ttere nottrue copies of the
message.
The vice-president responded that thp
portion ot tne message rrlatiug to Hawaii
had been Inadvertently omitted by
the secretary and directl that it be
read. This was done, and Mr. Dolph gave
notice that he would on tomorrow ndJre-.

The nic&Mge was ordered to lie ou tbt

Numerous petitions were presented and
