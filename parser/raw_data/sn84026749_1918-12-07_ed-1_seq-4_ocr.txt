NEW TORK. Dec. 7. Custard pies.
In recent years used for hurling pur
poses by motion picture actors, were
put to a more up to date t:so when
they camouflaged the escape of a
prisoner from the Tomb.
Had Max Schalk. forty-nine, sen
tenced from Brooklyn as a vagrant,
waited until today he would have
left the prison a free nun. Ills s!x
months sentence would expire .;n tl.st
day. Instead, however, he added li's
name to the list of those successful in
eluding the guards during tlio last
few mouths.
Schalk was a trusty, And while cart
ing coal In the yard shorUy after u
o'clock Friday afternoon saw a
bakery wagon about to leave. The
driver was delivering 4ome pies and
the trusty hid himself under the seat.
As the wagon left through the La
fayette street gate It was Inspected fiy
the guard, who permitted the driver
to pass out. Two blocks from the
prison Schalk arose from his hiding
place politely asked the driver to stop
and then climbed down. The driver
did not think the Incident of sufficient
Importance to report it to the prison
officials.
Schalk was missed shorUy after
ward and an investigation Is being
made. The gate guard is sure, he made
a careful Inspection of the wagon, and
the only explanation he can give Is
that Schalk In some manner disguised
himself as a pie. The police have been
asked to look for the man, who w.is
garbed In khaki and wore a gray flan
nel shirt the usual trusty attire.
TO HANG UP DISCARDED
HAT OF LATE CARDINAL
NEW TORK. Dec. 7, The late Car
dinal Farley's hat will be hung on
the cable high above the main altar
of St. Patrick's Cathedral beside that
of Cardinal McCloskey this week. A
spiral stairway leads from the back
of the church to the celling, and from
this point a cable has been strung,
by which means the cardinals hat
will be run out to the nave.
Each cardinal on his Induction into
the sacred college is given one of
these rich. red. silk-tasselled hats.
It Is emblematic of the pomp ami
vanities of the world, which the car
dinal puts aside, and therefore must
never be worn. 'At the death of a
cardinal the hat Is hung In the cathe
dral over which was the seat of his
see during life.
THE BOYS AT WALTER REED
NEED YOUR SPARE CANES
Men having one or more canes to
spare are urged to contribute them
to the District chapter of the Red
Cross for use of wounded and conval
escent soldiers at Walter Reed Hos
pital. This Is an appeal just -made by
'Mrs. Danforth Geer, chairman of the
comforts committee oC the chapter.
One of (he first things a wounded
soldier of a convalescent patient' at
the hospital asks for is a cane, and
hundreds are needed.
Mrs. Geer suggests that housewives
ransack their garrets and closets and
give the wounded soldiers the benefit
' of the supply of canes which have
been accumulating for generations
Mi most families. Those who have no
old canes and want to make a soldier
happy at Christmas are urged to buy
one and give It to him.
Canes should be turned in at com
forts committee headquarters, 1301
Connecticut avenue.

to come -under Investigation by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
as a, result of the committee's decis
ion to learn why the SUte -.Department
has 'withheld recognition from
the present government of Costa, Rica.
So interwoven are the affairs of
Costa Rica with those of its neigh

All the documents relating to the
case of Costa Rica have been sent to
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee by Secretary of State Lansing.
They will be examined by a special
subcommittee, of which Senator John
Sharp Williams Is chairman, on Mon
day. Sensational developments, which
will Justify this -cquntry's course In
refusing recognition to the present
government of Cdsta Rica, are ex
pected by Foreign Relations Commit
tee members. One charge, said to be
substantiated by the State Depart
ment papers, Is that an American cor
poration instigated the revolution In
Costa Rlca that put President Tlnoco.

tlons Committee making sensational
charges, which he will be called upon
to substantiate. j
'The same American corporation !
that Is charged with furnishing the
Inspiration and funds for the Tlnoco
revolution. Is charged with similar
I activities In other Central American
and South American countries. The
reason given for the Tlnoco revolu
tion 'in statements made by Gonzales
Is that the American corporation
wished to secure from. Tlnoco dock
age concessions that had been refused
by the former administration.
President Wilson's request. In his J
message to congress, mat me treaty
with Colombia, settling the Panama
Canal dispute with a payment of
money to Colombia, be ratified at this
session of Congress, will precipitate
an Investigation of this affair when
the Republicans come Into power.
Eight Farmer Rnlera Here.
Presidents of eight South American
and Central American governments,
who have been ousted from their po
sitions, now are In New fork, all
nursing a grievance against the
United States arid all seeking' redress."
