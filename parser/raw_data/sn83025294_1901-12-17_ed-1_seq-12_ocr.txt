Tailings.
Information was received yesterday
from the property of the Colorado Min
ing & Development company, located
near Corbin, Jefferson county, to the ef
fect that a two-foot body of very fine
ore had been struck in the drift, which
is being driven along the hanging wall
of the vein. The information came from
J. D. McClellan, the foreman.
The lead of the property is said to be
1C feet wide, but it is not all over. There
are, however, two streaks of good pay
ore, one on the hanging wall and the
other on the foot. To catch the pay
shoot a crosscut was driven from the
200-foot station into the lead. The drift
is now in about 50 feet. Manager Heil
bronner says that a new boiler has just
been added to the battery and that an
additional 100 feet will be added to the
shaft at once.
There is a tunnel on the property in
which a winze has been sunk and as
soon as the shaft reaches the 300 mark a
crosscut will be driven into the lead and
a raise made to connect it with the
winze. This will give the workings plenty
of ventilation and at the same time de
velop the vein.
In the same district as that in which
the property is located Paris Gibson of
Great Falls and J. J. Hill, Jr., son of
James J. Hill of the Great Northern
railroad, are developing a claim on
which they have sunk HO feet and are
bound for the 200 mark. The lead on
their claim, it is said, is 30 feet wide.
Postmaster English of Anaconda is
developing the surprise there. He is now
crosscutting from a tunnel, but will
soon begin deepening the old shaft.
It is reported that A. B. Knight and
others have leased the Dojney claim on
which there has been more than 1000 feet
of tunnel work done.

which has been working over tailings

MINING AROUND SHERIDAN.
Ore Can Now Be Shipped From That
Section at a Profit.
Ore is being shipped from Sheridan
regularly and it is proving quite a
convenience for the mine owners
and teamsters to load at this point,
I says the Sheridan Chinook. The haul
I from nearly all the property is
I down hill and good roads. It is
I safe to say that the shipments will in
crease 25 per cent, as much low grade ore
I can be handled at a profit now. Hereto
! fore the expense of handling the ore and
hauling to Twin Bridges ate up the mar»
; gin. The miners seem as though they
I realize the difference as they are secur
I ing leases daily and working their own
properties.
The Chinook is pleased to state that
the bond on the Comet has been taken
up by the Wall street Mining company
through W. H. Godfrey of Gr at Falls.
The property was formerly owned by
Dave Keneallv, Tat Balsam and Tim
Reardon. These gentlemen speak in the
highest terms of praise of Mr. Godfrey
in his dealings with them. It is gratify
ing to know that such men as Mr. God
frey will become interested in this dis
trict.
A carload of ore was shipped Saturday
from this point by Charley Bergsttom
and John Lindfors, who are working
the Lake mine on Mill creek. Mr. Berg
strom has leased the interests of Havt- !
land & Miller in the mine. The ore was j
sent to the Colorado smelter at Butte. :

has been taken from the property. i
A new lease has been secured on the I
Keynote by Raber & Eastrldge. A good I
portion of the ore has been stoped out in
the old workings and the boys will have ■
to do some dead work before shipments i
are resumed. !
Williams & Klenze are work'ng a claim
at Brandon. They are running a cross
cut tunnel and expect to tap the lead at
a depth of 75 feet. The ore is a pyrite
and carries good values in gold and sil

IMPORTANT IF TRUE.
Cinnibar Said to Have Been Found in
the Thunder Mountain District.
S. E. Edwards, the well-known pros
peetor and mining man, is in from the
Thunder Mountain country, says the
Boise. Idaho, Statesman. He brings posi
tive evidence that cinnabar (quicksilver
ore) is to be found there in quantity. IJ
has secured samples of high-grade cin
nabar from a claim owned by Prindlo
Smith.
The ore is very hand: ome. the spoci
mens easily run 35 per cent quicksilver,
These, it is probable, were picked sam
ples given Mr. Edwards by the owner.
but the former says the entire ledge wil:
run from 15 to 20 per cent "quick." The
vein is 10 to 15 feet in width, making .1
very fine proposition.
Here, as always in a cinnabar deposit,
there is no regular defined vein of the
quicksilver proper. That comes in con
nection with certain formations known
to those accustomed to mining cinnabar.
The allied material, if the deposit is per
manent, is always in well defined ledges
with perfect walls, and desseminated
throughout it is the cinnabar.
Tne Thunder Mountain deposit lies be
tween perfect walls, the hanging wall be
ing shale and the foot wall granite. It
is some miles this side of the Thunder
Mountain discovered by the Caswells,
where there is no granite whatever. The
cinnabar is probably within the granit
zone about two miles. This insures the
stability of the country, there being no
breaks or faults, so far as known.
The present ^ alue of quicksilver is 55
cents per pound. It is sold in flasks con
taining 72 'é pounds each. There are few
quicksilver mines in the United States,
the largest (and the only property
worked continuously) being in Central
California. At the best of these proper
ties the ledge is but 6 feet in width and
the average of the ore is less than 8 per
cent. It is run very profitably. The
properly is equipped with a smelter \yith
capacity equal to the normal output of
the mine.
For a great many years large numbers
of prospectors have hunted for cinnabar,
but without success, there being no large
deposits of the mineral. Whenever the
least indication was found, there were
plenty of moneyed men to send expert«
to -nvestigate. Cinnabar, though, is a pe
culiar» mineral in that it is often found
in pockets hundreds of miles from anoth
er deposit. It is oftentimes called a
mineral freak of nature because of this
peculiarity.
Mr. Edwards, in commenting on this
discovery, said yesterday afternoon that
never before had he known of a pros
pect of cinnabar to be more favorable
from every point of view. Fearing that
it was only a pocket, Mr. Smith, imme
diately upon discovery, began a system
atic development for exploiting purposes.
He sunk potholes at short intervals alon^
the ledge—it was always true, and with
the average of the ore—15 to 20 per
cent—maintained the full length of two
claims.
The indications are that the develop
ment of this new discovery will result In
great quicksilver mines In Idaho. If
true, mining men say it will mean more
than anything else in the mining indus
try of the state, as this mineral Is in
especial demand, and its place of pro
duction upon a commercial scale is known
and remembered by every mining man
throughout the world.
NEW HOIST ON EVA MAY.
It Will Lift 7000 Pounds From a
Depth of 1500 Feet.
The new hoist recently installed at the
Eva May mine in the Cataract district is
claimed to be the finest one in the state
for the size of its capacity, says the
Basin Progress. It is a 14x16 double cyl
inder. friction gear and single drum, and
is built to lift vertically a load of TOO"
pounds from a depth of 1500 feet. It
weighs 26,000 pounds. The manufactur
ers built it to order and had it delivered
at Basin within three weeks from the
time the order was received. The shaft
on the Eva May is now down 700 feet
and will be sunk to the 1000 foot level as
soon as possible. A fine body of copper
ore Is being worked and the concentrates
shipped to Butte smelters. The Eva
May has been a steady producer for some
time and with its new hoisting plant
promises to make a good record. George
B. Drakenfield is the efficient manager.
INTERESTS SOLD.
C. X. Gile Buys the Interest of Hag
gerty Brothers of Butte.
C. K. Gile last week purchased the in
terest of Haggerty Brothers of Butte In
the Helper and Basin claims, two and
one-half miles up Basin creek, says the
Basin Progress. It is the intention of
Mr. Gile, who now owns these claims, to
put on a large force of men shortly to
work these properties. Both claims carry
good values In the precious metals and
as there is lots of ore in sight ship
ments will begin soon. Two shifts of
miners will be put to work as soon as
possible.

A NEW GOLD SAVER.
Alleged to Be One of the Discoveries
of the Age.
Denver. Colo., Dec. 17.—Judge Finley of
Routt county believes he has discovered
the method of extracting flour gold, and
he has done It In a unique manner. He
lias Just brought down to Denver a deer,
killed a few days ago In Routt county,
whose lower teeth are covered with gold.
It lies in a thick cake all over the lower
Jaw.
For a time the hunters who shot the
deer were unable to account for the pres
ence of the gold, but Judge Finlev at
once remembered that a similar freak
was discovered about five years ago Jn
that section and the cause was reasoned
out at that time.
The deer hau been drinking in a spring
whose waters were impregnated with
Hour gold, and the salt saliva In the ani
mal's mouth had caused the gold to ad
here to its teeth. Judge Finley at once
saw the value of the discovery and
brought the deer to Denver for examin
ation. "It is a well-known fact," said
Judge Finley, when discussing the sub
ject. "that salt water will bring the Hour
gold out of black sand, and it is the
same principle which obtains in this case.
The spring at which this deer had been
ui the habit of drinking was Impregnated
with gold, and the action of the saliva
makes it adhere to the teeth as the ani
mal drinks. This was the ease with the
animal shot five years ago. and it is un
doubtedly the case in this instance. It
is one of the greatest discoveries of the
age.
Before That Time.
Booker T. Washington tells an amusing
story of a nold colored preacher who was
endeavoring to explain to his congrega
tion how it was that the children of
Israel passed over the Red sea safely,
while the Egyptians, who came after
them, were drowned. The old man said:
"My brethren, it was this way: When
the Israelites passed over it was early
in the morning, while it was cold, and
the was strong enough so that they went
over ali right; but when the Egyptians
came along it was in the middle of the
day, and the sun had thawed the ice so
that it gave way under them and they
were drowned." At this, a young man
in the congregation, who had been away
to school and had come home, rose and
said: "I don't see how that explanation
can be right, parson. The geography
that I've been studying tells us that ice
never forms under the equator, and the
Red sea is nearly under the equator."
"There, now," said the old preacher,
"that's all right. I's been 'spectin' some
of you smart Alecks would be askin' jest
some such fool question. The time I was
talkin' about was before they had any
jogafries or 'quators either."—Washing
