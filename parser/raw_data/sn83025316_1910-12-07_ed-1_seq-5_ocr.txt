DISTRICT FORESTER
TO LUMBERMEN
W. B. GREELEY ADDREfSES FOR
ESTRY AND CONSERVATION
ASSOCIATION;
Spokane, Dec. 6.-Earnest efforts will
be made by lumbermen in four states
-Washington. Idaho, Montanea and
Oregon-to procure from their
legislatures appropriations' for
forest fire fighting, double
or treble the amounts heretofore
assigned for such use each year. This
policy was brought out at today'q I
session of the Western Forestry and t
Conservation association. District I
Forester W.. B. Greeley of Missoula,
Mont., talked of ground telephone sysr I
terns, insulated wires being simply 1
laid on the surface, as an aid in fire
fighting. . . a. +.,!
"Next: seaon,'" lie "s~, 1 "we are
'going to install anlother system, also
recommended highly by signal corpp
men. This is known as the 'field
buzzer' and can. be used for as much
as five miles as a telephone and
from that to 30 miles as telegraph,
working the 'bu'zer' with a key and
the Morse. code."
"The use of dynamite in fighting
fires was an innovation, this year,"
said D. P. Simons, chief fire warden
of *the Washington forest fire asso
elation.
- "It's use, however, has convinced up
that the experiment was worth while."

go1iporation, today authorized a dg

FAB WOMAN ILSAI
$arq Antonio, Texas, Dec. 6.-(Spe
Selal)-The unusial sight of a woman
delegate taking an active part' in the
,'ffairs of a big convention was wit
nessed during the sessilons here of the
,Trans-Mississippi Commercial con
gress which convened last week. Mlrs.
S. P: Brundage of San Antonio, was
appointed by President J3anes P. Cal
lan of the Cattle Raisers association
of Texas, as the representative of the
cattle industry of the state to the
commercial congress. The selection
by President Coalhn was partly in
recognition of the wo. an's ability to
raise cattle successfmllly and at the
saipe time retain her femininity and
all the charms peculiar to the. alleged
weaker sex. Mrs. Brundage, the
widow of the late relix Shaw, oper
ated one of the largest cattle ranches
in southwest Texas, and did it so suc
cessfully that a larlge fortune left her
has been conslda'ably augmented.
Another reason why Mrs. Brundage
was appointed as5 a delegate is found
in her effective work at the conven
tion of the commercial congress in
Denver in 1909, when she aided the
San Antonio delegation in its fight
for the next convention by pinning
badges on the lapels of delegates'
coats and securingl their votes for San
P Antonio. It was due as much to Mrs.
t Brundage's w rki as to. the- eloquence
a of the San Antonio delegates that the
big congress mpt; ire this year.

CONDITIONS IN NICARAGUA
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE
- Washington, Dec. 6.--General Es- i
n. trada, the provisional president of
r. Nicaragua, shortly will issue a decree'
r' Inviting all Nicaraguan exiles to return
a, to their country. This information
g. reached the state department today in'
a, a telegram from Thomas Moffatt,
American consul at Bluefields, who is i
pow at Managua as the representative:
of the United States, pending the re
sumption of diplomatic relations. In
his telegram today, Mr. Moffatt said!
the political situation continues to im
ak prove.
c- Dr. Salvador Castrillo, who has been
rif appointed representative of the Nica
e- ragua government in W-lshington, sue
y.` e'eding David Arellani , 'left for his
e- post yesterday.
The decree of General Estrada, so
fasr as the state department is advised,
will make no exception among the po-:
litical offenders. It is believed here
to be sweeping in its provisions and
would even permit the return to Nica
ragua of former Presidents Zelaya and.
Madrlz.
It is not thought, however, that
either of these exiles will accept an:
invitation to return, for they probably:
would te liable to. prosecution in the
courts under the new regime. Zelaya
is now in Brussels, while Madriz is
believed, to be in Mexico City.
