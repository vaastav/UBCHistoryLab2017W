THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The message -of President Roosevelt
5 to congress justifies the prophesies
that were made for his practical good
sense, conservatism and plain-speak­
ing. There is nothing sensational in
it, nothing to bear out the fears of
same timid minds that President
Roosevelt would- be impetuous or lack
in good judgmienit and statesmanship.
It is a long message but well worth
reading and considering. Of the
principal portions of the message tne
reading public finds nothing materially
different from the predictions made of
it in the press. President Roosevelt
has been not at all anxious to prepare
his message in secret, and withhold
the tenor of his suggestion* from the
public. He has discussed its prin­
cipal points with members of the cab­
inet. senators, representatives and
public man, Consequently the public
was informed in a large measure of
the nature of the president's views on
njany topics and the suggestions he
would make to congress.
Of especially western interest are
the recommendations with reference
to government aid in the irrigation of
arid lands, conservation of the forest
supply, and dealing with the Indians.
The president is the first to make re­
commendation for appropriations for
irrigation. He is also a pioneer in
suggesting changes for the govern­
ment and management of the Indians.
His ideas with regard to them are

shared by the Indian department and
will doubtless be carried out by suit­
able legislatioii. With regard to the
tariff and money, the present system
erf currency is admittedly stable and
wise, and it is pretty well admitted,
also, that no sweeping changes in the
tariff will be made, and the president's
recommendations in this line will
(probably meet with the favorable
views of the majority of the party.
Reciprocity is the policy of the repub­
lican party, to be carried out with a
wise consideration of home interests.
This is President Roosevelt's idea and
in this he is in harmony with the re­
publican party. The necessity of in­
dustrial enterprises is admitted, and
the president is statesman and stu­
dent of economics enough to foresee
that legislation aimed at. industeial
enterprises out of retaliation and with
no definite purpose other than to de­
stroy them would be harmful and un­
wise. At the same time he sees the
evils that grow out of unrestricted
operations and capitalizations of
"trusts" and recommends government
supervision and, as chief of the rem­
edies, publicity, that the people may
know of the trusts as they do of their
national banks.
An isthmian canal and a Pacific
cable are recommended as necessary
adjuncts to our increasing trade and
growing power. Wise suggestions
are made for the government of Porto
Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines.
Practical suggestions are made both
to capital and labor, as to the best
means of perpetuating a condition of
harmony, peace and mutual order and
prosperity. A strenuous man, Presi­
dent Roosevelt believes in,a good army
and navy as one of the best means of
insuring peaoe. A fitting tribute is
paid to President McKinley, and sens­
ible suggestions made to congress as
to the spirit which should prevail in
amending the immigration laws,, to
keep out undesirable immigrants.
With anarchy, theoretical or processed,
the president has no tolerance what­
ever, and he believes in drastic meas­
ures against the evil.
Much of the remainder of the mes­
sage is technical, having reference to
the postal and consular service, infor­
mation to, congress regarding the con­
dition of affairs in China, and other
matters which custom makes part of
^presidential message. The recom­
mendations with regard to the re
enactmient of the Chinese exclusion
law will find favor, particularly with
labor which would otherwise have to
compete with 'the oriental cheap labor.
The message proves that President
Roosevelt is big enough for the re­
sponsibilities that were suddenly
thrust upon him, and that he lnw a

PRAIRIE BREEZES
In a morning paper of a recent date,
we find the following verse, by Mr. T.
D. Sullivan
I know what will happen, Sweet,
When you and 1 are one
Calm and bright and very fleet,
All our days will run.
Fond and kind our words will be,
Mixed no more with sighs
Thoughts too fine for words we'll see
Within each other's eyes.
"It is very musical and pretty, but
we want tt warn Sweet, whoever she
may be, that life doesn't run, that way.
Aijd if she consents to become the half
of one, instead of remaining one by
herself, with the idea that life will
run along as smoothly as "this verse
indicates, and that it will be unmixed
with sighs, somebody has been fooling
her. Life mixes in about the same
quantity of sighs with the wine he
serves out, whether you and I are one,
or two, or three, or half a dozen. .It
is a good plan to be practical in this
world, and practical people know that
there are times in all lives when the
furnace" won't draw the water pipes
freeze up, the jelly refuses to jell, the
beefsteak gets burned, and hubby is
late for supper. So we take the lib­
erty of adding some verses, in the hope
that Sweet may. see them and ponder:
You can't tell what will happen, Sweet,
When you and he are one,
Don't believe life's onward course
Always smooth will run,
Made to order joy you'll find
Not beneath the sun,
He wants you now, but has you fast
When you and he are one.
When 'the wash-day steams arise,
When this steak's not done,
Will he be as fond and kind,
Should you and he be one,
Life is full of little tasks.
If he looks for none, 7
Will he stand the test, I ask.
When you and he are one.
Sweet, in. Life's there's many a smile,
Let us not forget
Life has, too, its many a trial
In the Suture yet.

THE Iff ARCH SHOOTING
GRAND FORKS PEOPLE APPEAR
TO SYMPATHIZE FREELY WITH
WEST, THE MAN WHO DID THE
SHOOTING, ALTHOUGH REGRET­
TING THE FATA1LJTY.
The shooting affray at Grand Forks
which resulted in .the death of Frank
March the traveling man, is the prin­
cipal topic of interest up that way.
The coroner's jury has held an inquest
and returned a formal verdict that
March came'to his death by shooting
at the hands of West. A preliminary,
hearing will soon be held, aft which
West will be defended by Cochrane &
Corliss. An attempt will be made to
have Tracy Bangs assist with the
prosecution but this will prohably be,
resisted by the defense. There is con­
siderable sympathy with Wesit, as It is
claimed he is a peaceable man and was
not the aggressor, firing only when
practically forced to do so. Offers
have been maxfe to furnish bail for him
tt the offense proves a bailable one.

The Discovery «f Boras In Death
Valley by Aarou Winters.
The greatest discovery of borax in
the United States was made in the ter­
ribly hot region known as Death val­
ley and in a most romantic way. The
Chicago Record tells the story.
In 1880 Aaron Winters lived" with his
wife, Rosie, in a gulch known as Ash
Meadows, not far from the mouth of
Death valley. He was so fond of
his wife that he would not allow her to
be, long absent from him, although
their little hut on the side of the moun­
tain was a hundred ,miles from the
nearest neighbor, in a' wild, rugged
forsaken country.
One day a desert tramp came along
and spent the night at the Winters
home. He told the hunter about the
borax deposits of Nevada. When he
went away, Winters thought that he
had seen deposits of the same kind on
his explorations into Death valley.
Accordingly he and his wife went to­
gether to make the search, having pre­
viously provided themselves with cer­
tain test chemicals, which when .com­
bined with borax and ignited would
produce a green flame.
Having procured a piece of the sub­
stance which he believed to be borax.
Winters and his wife waited for night­
fall to make the test. How would It
%urn?
For years they had lived like Piutes
on the desert, entirely without luxuries
and often wanting for the very necessi­
ties of life. Would the match change
all that?
Winters held the blaze to the sub­
stance with a trembling hand, then
shouted at the top of his ocoice: "She
burns green, Bosiel We're rich! We're
rich!"
They had found borax. The mine
was sold for $20,000, and Winters took
his Rosie to a ranch in Nevti^q,
