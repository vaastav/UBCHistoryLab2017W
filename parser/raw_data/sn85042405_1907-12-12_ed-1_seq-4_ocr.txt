Congressman Gronna has returned
to Washington to be present at. the
opening of congress. With the excep
tion of Christmas holidays the session
is expected to last until June. Con
gressman Gronna has prepared a bill
providing for creating a fund with the
treasurer of the United States for the
payment of deposits in national banks
that may hereafter become insolvent.
A lax of one Of thieth of 1 percent
per annum, is proposed to be collected
from national banks on the average
annual amount of their deposits for
the purpose above stated. The fund
shall be retained by the comptroller
of the currency to liquidate in full all
claims of depositors in any national
banks that become insolvent after ap
plying the proceeds of the assets of
such bank as far as they will go towards
payingl depositors. In addition 3 per
cent shall be paid on all such amounts
due depositors from the time the bank
becomes insolvent. The bill extends
the same privilege to any state bank
also with due precautions conditions
to be ascertained by the government.
Congress will no doubt enact some leg
islation looking towards the further
security of depositors in banks of the
more tban it is.

WHAT THE FARflER HAS DONE.
The annual report of Secretary Wil
son, of the department of agriculture
has some interesting and important
figures. It shows that the farmers
of the United States have produced
the past crop year products that were
worth monev, to the amount of $7,
412,000,000. A billion dollars worth
of this wealth has been sold and the
money brought from the old world
4nd placed in banks all over the
country. Much of this money has
bees sent to New York attracted by
the high rates of ^interest that pre
vailed there and invested iu bonds
and other securities tnat have

ing of the wealth that the farmers
annual producey in this country a
Washin^on correspondent nays:—
"Thus it is shown that 8such com
rops as that raised in the United
States this year^and sold at the price
this one is bringing, would build
every foot of steam railroad in the
country, including'all the expensive
terminals and pay for every particle
of propel ty of whatever name or
nature owned by these roads, but
nothing is cited to prove tnat the
original productiveness of a stock
market would or coula build a rail
road in a million years.
"The total value of all tnat the
farms of the United States produced
in 1907 is 10 per cent more than the
value of tiie total production cf 1906,
altho the crops this year have not
been quite as good as last year. The
total value for 1907 is also 17 per cnt
more than in 1905, 20 per cent above
that of 1904, 25 per cent in excess of
that,of 1903, and 57 per cent greater
than the total value for 1899. The
tota farm exports for the year have
been $1,055,000,000 or 879,000,000

If the members of the grand jury

to'have the law enforced there would
have been less occasion for criticlsir

Every citizen is responsible to a cer

have prevailed there.
The same opposition and inter
ferences with the enforcement of the

these disturbances bode good for the
cause of law and order, and for a
better enforcement of the law of the

Roosevelt keeps'in close touch with
every important department of the
government and probably knows as
much about what is being done in
the execution of the laws as any
president who ever occupied the
chair. Some of the recommendations
are more than timely. The president
says this countrys business conditions
are fundimentaiily sound and that it
is foolish for people.to hoard money
instead of keeping it in sound banks.
As a rule business is conducted in all
legitimate commercial enterprises

¥Xi
Nicknamed "Trotter" When Instructor
of Tactics There—Incident* of Hi*
Way of Discharging the Duties of
Disciplinary Officer at the Military
Academy.
In tbe war department there is sor
rpw over the death of Colonel I-everett
Hull Walker of the^ artillery arm.
writes the New York Post's Washing
ton correspondent. Colonel Walker
was one of the marked exceptions to
the rule that reticent men are seldom
popular. He would not hare been re
tired from the service for age for
some years. He was in tbe West
Point class of 1871, of which Fried
Grant was one of the graduates, and
Grant is not yet within sight of tbe
age limit. About seven years after bis
graduation anil when he had just add
ed the first bar to the field of his
shoulder knot Walker was ordered to
West Potat as an instructor in tactics.
This position put him in command of
one of the cadet battalions, for the
discipline of which be was responsible.
The cadets have a nickname for ev
ery one and everything. It is doubt
ful if any officer who has served at
tbe academy was ever known to tbe
cadets—when-he was at a distance, of
course—by. his proper name. .--Walker
by an easy transition was made "Trot
ter," and "Trotter" be stayed until his
tour of duty was over, and certain It
is that there are those in the service
today who must have to think twigp
to give his name the right speech gait.
"Trotter" was well beloved by the
corps cadets. He did his 4uty in a
disciplinary .way by his cadet com
pany, but he never moved by the right
and left flank out of the regular line
of march -to catch the cadets at of
fenses. picayune offenses in the main,
but which some officers, with a mar
tinet's view of life, thought, it neces
sary at all times to play the spy upon.
One night when Walker was on duty
at the academy four cadets stole out
of barracks after taps and "ran it" to
Newburg on a steam launch. There
had been no inspection of quarters be
tween taps and reveille for some time,
and the runaways thought they would
be safe from detection. As a precau
tion one of them, ihowever, a member
of Walker's company, put a dummy in
his bunk, a dummy made of a stuffed
nightshirt with a boxing glove for a
head.
Woe betide! There, was an inspec
tion of quarters that night an inspec
tion probably ordered by the com
mandant. who doubtless bad a suspi
cion. The four tactical officers of the
battalion went on their inspecting
work with dark lanterns, one through
each company. After the inspection,
they met on the porch of the barracks'
Two of them reported absentees, and.
notwithstanding the fact that absence
from quarters between taps and re
veille meant dismissal for tbe culprits,
the officers who had found them out
announced the fact chuckling. Anx
ious cadets who had been roused frou/
their sleep by the inspection listened
at nearby windows and beard one of
the chuckling ones .ask Walker if he
had found any absentees, and old
"Trotter" said. "No. thank God."
A California cadet named Dempsey
once smuggled a basket of peaches
into his quarters. Dempsey was a
member of "Trotter's" company. One
Saturday night when the cadets were
allowed to visit'one another and were
supposed to be exempt from fear of
Inspection of their rooms Cadet Demp
sey pulled his basket of peaches out of
its hiding place in the chimney, sat
down in a chair with the basket in bis
lap preparatory to picking out a spe
cially fine peach for immediate con
sumption. Now, the penalty of having
fruit in quarters was ten days' con
finement and five tours of extra guapd
duty. Dempsey had selected bis peach.
There was the regulation army offi
cer's tap at the door, the door flew
open, and in walked "Trotter."
Sheer force of disciplinary- habit
brought Cadet Dempsey to bis feet qt
attention, with bis heels together, hi*
chest well out, his head erect—and the
basket of peaches overturned on the
floor with the contents rolling abtfut
tbe feet of "Trotter" like a windfall
in an orchard. "Trotter" seemed to be
struck with a sort of dumb wonder in
which sorrow wan largely inlied. In
way he stretched forth his arm with
tbe forefinger of bis hand pointing.
"Peaches, Mr. Dempsey," be said.
Then he looked toward tbe onen fire
place. and. pointing, he said again.
"Peaches, Mr. Dempsey." He looked
between bis feet,, shook bis head and
•aid. "Peaches. Mr. Dempsey." Then:
stepped on a peach, nearly losing bis
footing. "Peaches, Mr. Dempsey."
and with Jhat be disappeared. i
Now, "Trotter" must have thought
the matter over. Peaches in quartern
now great day night and he bad gone to Demp-
wailing and perturbation in tbe pig* sey's room on a regular study hour
on inspection, so he w^gbed the thing
in his mind, and Dempsey escaped his
ten days' confinement and his five
tours of extra guard duty because no
report was turned in against him.
