Judge Anderson, against the

in the opinion of Judge A. P>. Anderson,
of the United States district federal
court. Judge Anderson, who issued the
injunction rescinding of the strike order,
expressed himself so in the course of
examination of Alonza Newcorab, a
miner.
Xewcomb was before the court on a
charge of illegal sale of liquor. Judge
Anderson was trying to obtain informa
tion as to the miners' attitude toward
the United Mine Workers of America.
"Doesn't it seem that you are all in
conspiracy to milk the public?" .Judge
Anderson asked.
Operators Milk Miners.
Xewcomb said the mine workers are '
} paitl only 84 cents for the coal they
mine, while they have to pay the opera
tors $2.20 a ton for that coal on top
of the mine and. besides, have to haul it, ;
themselves.
"Ought not all of you to come down
nil around*'" Judge Anderson asked, arid .
Xewcomb said:
"I guess you are right."
"Isn't it true that you say the mine j
operators get so much that you want i
part of their profits".'" persisted the
judge.
Xewcomb said this also seemed to be
the case, whereupon Judge Anderson re
marked that it appeared as though both
factions in the coal trouble were in "ca
hoots to bleed the public."

Xewcomb saiil he averaged about

much as $10 a dav.

Carlisle's trail through a heavy snow in the Laramie Peak
country was followed from early Sunday morning by two posses
of 20 men. The train bandit escaped from the posse earlier today,
jumping from a window of the widow Bray's ranch home as the
posse members entered. He was captured at 3:30 o'clock this
afternoon.
Carlisle was taken by a force of Union Pacific detectives, headed
