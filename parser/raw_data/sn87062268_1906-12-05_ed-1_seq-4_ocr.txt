President Roosevelts
Message to Congress
President Roosevelts message to I
the last session of the 59th congress
is one of the strongest most virile de
Ihi
liverances ever presented to that body
and in most respects it forms an ex
cellent democratic document
Probably the most striking feature
of the message is the position the
president takes with reference to an
inheritance and an income tax While
Is
something along this line was expect
ed it was not believed that he would
go so far as to advocate a graduated
tax in both instances This was a
part of the doctrine of the Populist
party and tho Farmers Alliance
twelve or fifteen years ago and while
it would not have appeared strange
coming from a democrat it is a rather
remarkable deliverance from the lead
er of the Republican party
The presidents reference to the
supreme courts past decision declar
ing an income tax unconstitutional is
ls
so delicately worded and carefully
I guarded that it is almost laughable
Ilis very evident that in President
Roosevelts own opinion either the
I
present or a future supreme court
might easily reverse the old opinion
but he is careful not to say so in that
I
many words That however reading
i between the lines in wnat he does
I
J say is really what the following from
his message means
i the question is undoubtedly very
intricate delicate and troublesome
The decision of the court was only
reached oy one majority It Is the
law of the land and of course is ac
cepted as such and loyally obeyed by
all good citizens Nevertheless the
hesitation evidently felt by the court I
as a whole in coming to a conclusion
when considered together with pre
vious decisions on te subject may
perhaps idicate the possibility of de
vising a constitutional income tax law
which shall substantially accomplish
the results aimed at The difficulty
of amending the constitution is so
great that only real necessity can jus
tify a resort thereto fcJvery effort
should be made in dealing with this
subject as with the subject of the
I proper control by the national govern
I ment over the use of corporate wealth
in interstate business to devise legis
lation which withont such action
shall attain the desired end hut if
this fails there will ultimately be no
alternative to a constitutional amend
ment
The president again urges the en
actment of a law prohibiting corpora i
tions from contributing to campaign I
funds and a measure conferring
upon
the government the right of appeal
in criminal cases upon questions of
law
I lawThe proper use of injunctions in la
bor cases is discussed briefly and a
law is suggested that will prevent I
I abuse of the power similar to that ad
II vocated by the president last year
I
I Lynching and mob violence
are de
precated in the strongest terms and
in this connection Mr Roosevelt says
There is but one safe rule in dealing
with black men as well as white men
I U is the same law that must be ap
plied in dealing with rich men and
poor men1 that is to treat each man
p
I whatever his color his creed or his
social position with even handed jus
jtlce on his real wort has a man
j In dealing with the question of capi
I taI and labor the president pays his
respects in no uncertain terms to
i preachers of mere discontent who
he avers are the cause of much of
the trouble Such men the president
says are sinister demagogues and
foolish Visionaries who are really the
worst enemies of the cause they pro
fess to advocate
i Tho need of a law limiting the num
ber of hours of employment of rail
way employees is advocated as a step
In the direction of a general elght
hour day in this connection the
president claims That an eight hour
day on the Isthmus of Panama would
rbe absurd as conditions there arc In
I
every way different from what they
are In the states It would be equally
absurd says Mr Roosevelt to bother
as to whether the necessary work Is
done by alien black men or by alien
yellow men
A commission of conciliation and
arbitration lOJ1 tb t settlement of
I
J strips locTiouts and labor disputes
1 generally is advocated and statistics
fare given covering a period of 25
I years showing during that period
that over sevenmIllion men were af
I fected by differences of this kind
i and that the total pecuniary loss to
t employers and employees was 450
000000
The control of corporations is dealt
I
with at considerable length and the
necessity for national action is strong
ly set forth
o
Industrial training the welfare ofI
I
I the farmer irrigation and forest legis
lation divorce legislation merchant
marine and our outlying possessions
are considered at some length and
legislature to remedy existing evils
suggested
The rights of aliens especially in
view of the present difficulty with
I Japan over the refusal of the San
Francisco authorities to admit Japan
ese pupijs to schools attended by
white children is considered at length
and fair treatment is asked for
I the Japanese as well as for citizens
of all other nations
The Cuban question is discussed in
detail and after Citing the causes that
led to the intervention of the United
States Mr Roosevelt says
The United States wishes nothing
of Cuba except that it shall prosper
om
morally and materially and wishes
nothing of the Cubans save that they
shall bo able to preserve order among
themselves and therefore to preserve
their independence
The conference of American repub
ics at Rio and Its value in bring
i ng about a better understanding
between the people of the western
lemisphere is referred to briefly and
a full report of the presidents views
Ion the Panama canal is promised
ater on The Algeciras conference
the destruction seals on the Pfribi
l of islands and the second Hague con
ference are also dealt with and recom
mendationsmade
The army and navy are considered
at length and the president asks that
both be at least maintained at their
present strength This was only pos
sible so far as the navy was con
cerned by replacing obsolete and out
worn ships with new ones the equals
of any afloat To stop building
ships for one year means that the navy
goes back instead of forward The
president then refers to the great
value to the nation of the schools at
West Point and Anapolis and contin
uing says
There should soon be an Increase In
the number of men for our coast de
fenses These men should be of the
right type and properly trained and
there should therefore be an increase
of pay for certain skilled grades es
pecially in the coast artillery Money
should be appropriated to permit
troops to be massed in body and exer
cised in maneuvers particularly in
marching
In conclusion the president com
mends the army and navy for readi
ness and efficiency in dealing with the
recent crisis in Cuba and congratu
lates congress for its wisdom in pro
viding for a national board for the
promotion 01 rifle practice The es
tablishment of shooting galleries and
national target ranges in all large
schools is recommended

At Flomaton For Accom
modation of the Travel
I
ing Public
Work upon the construction of a
handsome new depot at Flomaton for
the accommodation of the traveling
public has been commenced by
employees of the Louisville Nash
ville Railroad The building will be
much larger more commodious and
modern in every respect than the one
destroyed by fire and which is only
now being replaced The public es
I pecially those who have occasion to
travel to any extent will be pleased
I to learn of the fact that the building
is now under course of construction
I Supt E 0 Saltmarsh when teen
yesterday by a Journal representative
stated that while the depot was not
within his jurisdiction he could state
that workmen are new engaged in
building the depot and he assumed
that it will be completed promptly I
There has been considerable delay t
he stated In constructing the building
due to the difficulty in securing ma
terial and men buthe does not now
see any reason for further delay
The foundation for the building
was placed some months ago but
now the construction work upon the
building proper has commenced and I
Monday and yesterday large forces of j
men were employed and there is now j
every reason to believe that the work
will be pushed to completion rapidly

much to II1c tnt consolidation as sucn
but so to supervise and control It as
to see that it results In no harm to the
people
Combination of capital like combina I

our present Industrial system It is
not possible completely to prevent it
and if it were possible such complete
preven > n wouhl do damage to the
body politic What we need is not

adequate control ud supervision of

form as inevitably to threaten Injury
for the mere fart that a combination
has secured practically complete con
trol of a necessary of life would under
any circumstances show thnt such
comliuatoi was to be presumed to be
adverse to tm public Interest It Is
unfortunate that our present laws
should forbid ail combinations instead
of sharply discriminating between j
those combinations which do good and
those combinations which do evil Re I
bates for Instance are is often due to I
the pressure of big sblppers as was 1
shown In the investigation of the
I Standard Oil company and as has been I I
I shown since by the Investigation of 1
the tobacco and sugar trusts as to the
initiative of big railroads Often rail I
roads would like to combine for the
I
purpose of preventing a big shipper
from maintaining improper advantages I
I at the expense of small shippers and
i of the general public Such a comblna
I ion instead of being forbidden by law
should be favored In other words it
I
should bo permitted to railroads to
make agreements provided these agree
ments were sanctioned by the inter
state commerce commission and were
published With these two conditions
complied with it is impossible to see
what harm such a combination could
do to the public at large

Inheritance nnd Income Tax
The national government has long
derived its chief revenue from a tariff
on imports and from an internal or ex
cise tax In addition to these there is
every reason why when next our sys
tem of taxation Is revised the national
government should impose a graduated
inheritance tax and If possible a grad
uated Income ta
J am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become fa
miliar with what Is proposed to be
done may clearly see the necessity of
proceeding with wisdom and self re
straint and may make up their minds
Just how far they are willing to go in
the matter while only trained legisla
tors can work out the project in neces
sary detail But I feel that in the near
future our national legislators should
enact a law providing for a graduated
inheritance tax by which a steadily in
creasing rate of duty should be put
Upon all moneys or other valuables
coming by gift bequest or devise to
any Individual or corporation There
can be no question of the ethical pro
priety of the government thus deter
mining the conditions upon which any
gift or Inheritance should be received
As thelaw now stands it is undoubt
I
edly difficult to devise a national in
come tax which shall be constitutional
But whether It Is absolutely Impossible
Is another question and if possible it
is most certainly desirable The first
purely income tax law was passed by
the congress in 1861 but the most Im
portant law dealing with the subject
I
was that of 1894 This the court held
to be unconstitutional j
The question is undoubtedly very in
tricate delicate and troublesome The
I decision of the court was only reached
by one majority It is the law of the
land and of course is accepted as such
I nnd loyally obeyed by all good citizens
Nevertheless the hesitation evidently
felt by the court as a whole In coming
to a conclusion when considered to
gether with previous decisions on the
I subject may perhaps indicate the pos
I sibility of devising a constitutional in
come tax law which shall substantially
I accomplish the results aimed at T4ie
difficulty of amending the constitution
Is so great that only real necessity can
Justify a resort thereto Every effort
should be made In dealing with this
subject as with the subject of the
proper control by the national govern
ment over the use of corporate wealth
In interstate business to devise legis
lation which without such action shall
attain the desired end but if this fails
there will ultimately be no alternative
to a constitutional amendment
Imlnntrtnl Training
Our Industrial development depends
largely upon technical education in
cluding in this term all industrial edu
cation from that which fits a man to
be n good mechanic a good carpenter
or blacksmith to that which fits a man
to do the greatest engineering feat
The skilled mechanic the skilled work

the vagcxvorkor wbp tolls with his
hands ahd wJiO must we hope in a
constantly increasing measure also
toil with his brain Under the constitu
tion the national legislature can do but
little of direct importance for his wel
fare save where he Is engaged In work
which permits it to act under the in
terstate commerce clause of the consti
tution and this Is one reason why Iso I
so earnestly hope that both the legis
lative andjudicial branches of the gov
ernment wHI construe this clause of
the constitution in the broadest possi
ble manner
The Farmer
The only Other persons whose wel
fare Is as vital to the welfare of the
whole country as Is the welfare the
wageworkers the tillers of the soil
the farmers
Several factors must cooperate In
the Improvement of the farmers con
dition He must have the chance to
be educated In the widest possible
sense la the sense which keeps ever in
view the intimate relationship between
the theory of education and the facts
of life
Organization has become necessary
In the business world and It has ac
complished much for good In the world
of labor It Is no less necessary for
farmers Such a movement as the
grange movement good In Itself and
Is capable of a well nigh Infinite fur
ther extension for good so long as It is
kent to its own legitimate business
The benefits to be derived by the as
sociation of farmers for mutual ad
vantage are partly economic and part
ly sociological
Irrigation nnd Forest Preservation
Much Is now being done for the
states of the Rocky mountains and
great plains through the development
of the national policy of irrigation and
forest preservation government
policy for the betterment of our Inter
nal conditions has been more fruitful
of good than this
Divorce Legislation
r am well aware of how difficult It Is
to pass a constitutional amendment
Nevertheless my judgment the
whole question of marriage and di
vorce should relegated to the au
thority of the national congress The
change would be good from every
standpoint In particular it would bo
good because it would confer on the
congress the power at once to deal
radically and efficiently vrlthpolygamy
nnd this should be done whether or
not marriage and divorce are dealt
with It Is neither safe nor proper to
leave the question of polygamy to be
dealt with by the several states
Merchant Marine
Let me once again call the attention
of the congress to two subjects con
cerning which I have frequently be
fore communicated with them One Is
the question of developing American
shipping I trust that a law embody
ing in substance the vFews or a major
part of the views expressed in the re
port on this subject laid before the
house at its last session Trill be passed
It seems to mo that the proposed meas
ure Is as nearly unobjectionable as any
nbL
The Currency
I especially call your attention to the
second subject thrf condition of our
currency laws The national bank act
has ably served a great purpose In aid
ing the enormous business develop
ment of the country nnd within ten
years there has beeiijnn Increase In
circulation per capita from 2141 to
3308 For several years evidence has
been accumulating that additional leg
islation is needed The recurrence of
each crop season emphasizes the de
fects of the present laws There must
soon be a revision of them because
to leave them as they are means to In
cur liability of business disaster Since
