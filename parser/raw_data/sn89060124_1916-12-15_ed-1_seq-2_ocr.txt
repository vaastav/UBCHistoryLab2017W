HOW TO LIVE CHEAPLY,
Substitute comfort for show.
Put convenience in the place of
fashion. Study simplicity. Re
fuse to be beguiled into a style
of living above what is required
by your position in society and
is justified by your resources.
Set a fashion of simplicity, neat
ness, prudence and inexpensive
ness which others will be
glad to follow and thank you
for introducing. Teach your
self to do without a thousand
and one pretty and showy things
which wealthy people purchase,
and pride yourself oft being just
as happy without them as your
rich neighbors are with them.
Put so much dignity, sincerity,
kindness, virtue and love into
your simple -and inexpensive
home that its members will
never miss the costly flipperies
. * and showy adornments of fash
ion, and be happier in the cozy
and comfortable apartments than
i most of pur wealthy neighbors
• are in their splendid mansions.
—Exchange.
Congress assembled on Mon
day of last week for the last lap
of the Sixty-fourth Session. The
attendance was large and the
lawmakers got down to work
just as soon as the preliminaries
were through with. It is the in
tention of the leaders to get all
the more important matters in
shape so that as much as possible
can be done in the short time
remaining before the next Con
gress convenes in March, 1917.
As inaugurated by ' President
Wilson, his message was deliver
ed in person before the assembled
branches in the House on Tues
day and was most attentively
listened to. It dealt with propo
sitions with which our readers
‘ are familiar, the President hav
ing discoursed on them frequent
ly in the public prints during his
term of offee. The labor problem
having principally to do with the
eight hour law; the high cost of
living and the possible regulation
of the prices on foodstuffs; ex
tension of our export trade with
foreign and American
countries and other problems of
internal and external natures
were treated with wonderful
facility which always exemplifies
the work of Mr. Wilson.
Prince George’s County Should Have
Modern Farm Work Advisor.
In order to provide for practical
farm demonstration work in all Coun
ties of the State, the last Legislature
made an appropriation of SI,OOO for
each county, to be devoted to paying
the salary of a County Agricultural
Agent.
The United State Government,
through the Extension Service will off
set this appropriation with a like
amount for the same purpose. Thus,
there is available $2,000 for the salary
and expenses of a demonstration agent
for Prince George’s County.
Nearly all the counties of the State
' v now have County Demonstration
Agents, and they are proving to be of
invaluable service to the farmers.
Prince George’s should have one too,
especially as it will entail little or no
expense to the county.
Instead of successful farmers having
to call on the Federal or State Depart
ment for expert advice on farm
problems, this practical demonstrator
would be located in the county willing
and anxious to impart the information
• which has been gleaned by the Govern
ment at a cost of millions of dollars.
No problem would be presented for
which a solution would not be quickly
supplied, for Uncle Sam backs up the
field demonstrator with the foremost
experts in the country and they co
operate in every way to spread agricul
tural information.
Call to Electors.
Secretary Albert J. Almoney, of the
Democratic State Central Committee,
has sent out letters to the Maryland
members of the Electoral College noti
fying them to meet at the State House
at Annapolis at noon on the second
Monday in January—January B—and
cast their votes for President and
Vice-President of the United States in
accordance with the resmt of the elec
tion held on November 7.
The result of their balloting shall
thereafter be certified to the President
of the United States Senate, who, in
the presence of the members of the
Senate and House, will open the certi
ficates along with the certificates re
ceived from other States and canvass
the returns. It is understood that the
Senate and House will canvass the
vote of the Electoral College some time
in February.
James W. Owens, of Annapolis, who
has been Secretary of the Maryland
Electoral College for many years, is
again an applicant for this position.
Meeting In Interest Of Washington- (
Indian Head Highway
The mass-meeting held in Christ
Church Parish Hall. December 2. by
the Charles and Prince George’s county
Association, furthering the construction
of the Military Highway between
Washington and Indian Head, was
largely attended.
Hervey 8. Knight, was chosen presi
dent of the Central Committee, 1 heo
dore F. Meuk, Secretary and Treasur
er. This committee is nnpowered to
; take care of detail work in connection
with the project in question.
On the suggestion of Prot.Bomberger,
the Federated Association was named,
“The Winthrop-Indian Head-Wash
ington Military Highway Association.’’
W. Gwynn Gardiner spoke of the ad
vantage of a federal road as not add
ing to the taxes of the State and aftect
. in]* property owners, also that money
for an experimental road building by Ag
cultural Department, might be secured.
On motion of Mr. Gardiner, Prof. R.
I. Manning, was appointed a commit
tee of one to confer with Governor
Harrington and the Stale Roads Com
mission of (Maryland, for the purpose
of expediting the survey authorized by
the passage of Delegate Blandford s
i Bill at last session of the State Legisla
ture.
Mr. Seiler, representing tqe Americ
an Automobile Association, offered to
■ have maps of the route printed forpub
l licity purposes, and assured the sup
port of his association.
Mr. Matchette spoke at length of his
[ activitivities in connection with the
Washington-Amnapolis Highway, and
offered suggestions on the present pro
ject.
i The Secretary was authorized to pre
, pare a letter to Maryland’s representa
i tives in Congress, the Governor of
Maryland and the State Roads Com
' mission, stating the sense of the meet
■ ing.
Col. Reed in charge of the Marine
Corps Reservation, Wiuthrop, Md,
‘ spoke of the military need of the pro
-1 posed road as it pertained to his reser
vation, and assured the audience that
recommendation from his superior offi
cer to the War Department would be
forth coming. As the Chief of Artillery
has sent strong recommendations to the
* War Department asking for the con
! struction of the road as a means of rear
! defence for the Coast Artillery Fortifi
; cations at Fort Washington, and a fa
j vorable interest has been expressed by
Hon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Assistant
Secretary of tbe Navy, and Hon. Sid
‘ ney E. Mudd gives assurances that he
has secured the support of his colleages
l of the Naval Committee, it would ap
, pear that favorable action on Mr.
Mudd’s bill, providing for the construc
tion of the road in question and re
ferred to the House Naval Committee,
'• might reasonable be expected.
The construction of this road would
serve a large area, comprising the river
bottom lands along the Potomac river,
the early trucking soils of Fiscataway,
and the farms of. the Mattawoman
Swamp. Securing this highway, whol
; ly or partly, through appropriations,
would be but using the resources of tbe
State, through the favorable situation
of Government reservations,which are in
need of better transportation tacilitise.
In the Interest of a Social Worker.
| In Baltimore there is an organization
, known as the “Alliance of Charitable
and Social Agencies.” This orgauiza
lion acts as a sort of clearing house
for the following organizations: Babies
Milk Fund Association; Federated
> Charities; Friendly Inn Association;
ienry Watson’s Children’s Aid Society; I
, Instructive Visiting Nurse Ass’n.
Maryland Ass’n for the Prevention and
Relief of TubenTUlosis; Prisoner’s Aid
Ass’n; Social Service Corporation;
Mental Hygiene Society; Traveler’s
Aid Society; Mother’s Releif Society;
Maryland Children’s Aid Society;
Thus the great agencies for helpful
ness that only a great city may have,
are united in one central organization
so that there will be no overlapping of
effort and so that every cry for help
1 may have the best answer possible.
The Alliance felt that the whole
state of Maryland should have the full
benefit of all this social power. The
Alliance wished to give tbe country*
districts the same opportunity to relieve
distress and misfortune which the great
■ city of Baltimore had.
The plan decided upon was to put an
expert social work?r in each county.
With the cooperation of the clergy and
other interested persons all cases of
need and distress nould be turned over
to such worker, receive expert investi
-1 gation and then receive expert help
because of the tremendous power of
' helpfulness bound up in the Alliance.
No matter how willing a person may
be to help a case of poveity, to provide
' a free surgical operation, or to find a
home for an orphan, the inevitable
“HOW?” is always a handicap to any
one but a trained worker. So this is in
no sense an intrusion on the part of
Baltimore social agencies. It is an
offer of Baltimore’s capacity for help
which only a great city can provide-
It is in no sense an effort to trespass
upon the great priveh-ge of the clergy
and church workers in “giving a cup
of cold water unto the least of His
Brethren’’. It is an offer of expert aid
and the proffer of the very institutions
which will enable the clergy and
Church workers to give that very cup
of cold water in the best way.
Eleven Counties of Maryland already
have such a social worker and have
taken advantage of Baltimore’s offer;
—Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore.
Caroline, Carroll. Dorchester, Harford,
Montgomery, Talbot and Wicomico.
The Alliance of Charitable and Social
Agi ncies of Baltimore has placed tem
p irarily in the county their Miss Hood
who is tiained social worker of wide
experience and a person of discretion
and kindly wisdom. In addition to her
many years of experience which is the
| best training, she studied in the Insti
| lute founded for that purpose by i lie
Russi 11 page Foundation in New Yoik.
Miss Lillian Hood has been doing
; some excellent work in the county and
already many interested persons look
upon her continued efforts as a uecess
-1 ity. To do this S2OOO wiil have to be
raised to provide her with an automo
bile, traveling and other expenses and
; salary.
Mr, William H Davenport who is
the special agent of the Alliance for
work in Maryland counties, began or
ganized effort in this county with a
small committee composed of Rev. L.
Cody Marsh, The Hon. Joseph Addi- !
son, Professor E. S Burroughs, The j
H on- 8. Marvin Peach and Mrs. E. F. ;
Wade. This committee has widened !
considerably and the following interest- j
ed persons have conseutid to act as j
chairman of their respective districts: • .
Dr- Bowen for Aquasco; Mr. Allan j
Mallory for Kent; The Hon. Joseph |
Addison forßowi ; Mr. Millard Thorne I
for Piscatawav; Mr Sumiuerfield 1). I
Hell for Vansvilie; Mrs. B. F. Wadej
for Laurel; Professor Burroughs foi
Surratts; The Hon Marvin Peach for
Hyattsvilh; MBs Marie Hill for Meil
wood; Mr. L. G. Sasscer for Marlboro;
Judge Arnold for Plad?nsdurg; Mr.
William Piles for Spaulding- Theie
are many districts under advisement
as to chairmen. It is somewhat diffi
cult to mi.ke selection because of the
gratifying number of interested people
in each district. There would hardly
he space to record the names of all
who have shown a definite interest.
Southern Maryland is showing a fine
interest in tbe welfare of her popula
tion. .
The First National Bank of Southern
Maryland shows its interest by offering |
to receive contributions for this fund.
It is a splendid tribute to this commer- ,
cial institution that its business facili- |
ties are put at the disposal of human |
service and betterment.
The newspapeis of the county have |
also indicated their willingness to re
ceive contributions and have offered the r
columns to acquaint Southern Maryland ,
with this splendid effort. ,
The committee wishes to make it ,
perfectly clear that the contributions ,
received will not be touched unless the '
whole amount is raised. Great gifts j
are not necessary. The committee ,
wishes every family to participate. \
Another article will appear next (
week, explaining precisely the works
such a worker would perform and tbe
value of such works; also a tentative ,
plan of organization by which the
county residents will aid and control
tbe work.
However, the above information will
make it clear that the effort has not
only aroused a wide interest but some
thing has already been done. Miss
Hood has already given us proof of
her value and Mr- Davenport has
worked like a Trojau It is doubtful if
there is a road which he has not cover
ed.
