NO FURTHER WORK FOR
TROOPS OX TEXAS SIDE
Del Rio, Texas, Dec. 6. Capt. Thayer, j
commanding troop K, Third cavalry,
sent here from Fort Sam. Houston to
patrol the border and prevent any overt
acts in connection with the trouble in
Mexico, has received orders which will
transfer the troop to Fort Clark on
December 10. The troop stationed at
Eagle -Pass will also move to Fort
Clark
Aside from the mere formality of pa
troling the border, there tnas been no
work for the soldiers since they were
brought here. Absolutely nothing has
transpired to give credence to any ac
tivity along the river in this section.
Americans cross and recross the river
and go into the interior the same as
formerly and feel perfectly secure.

Del Rio, Texas, Dec. 1.
Editor El Paso Herald:
You have certainly handled the Mexican socalled revolution fine,
jsving news while it was news without resorting to a lot of Tionsense
and rot.
The people of Del Itio are greatly pleased with the matter that was
sent out .from here to The Herald. cspi-cUlly in view of the fact that this
town has received quite a bit of undesirable .notoriety from the fact that
it was formerly a rendezvous for revolutionists.
I put this in the past tense because, thanks to Don Manuel Cuesta,
Mexican consul. tlii- class has deemed it wise-to seek pastures new.
Since coming to Del. Rio he has wrought great changes by bringing
the Americans and the better class of Mexicans into a more thorough

Americans abroad never received a
greater shock than, those of the Ameri

death of Edward Lawton, of Detroit,
who was accidentafiy killed in the bat-
tie of November 21. Xot only was the
American rwoncombattant killed out

coffin at the cemetery and photo

coffin or without, friends do not know.

"El Paso will always need bridges
over the Rio Grande, for that sttim
will never go dry. Many have thought j
that after the construction of the Ele
phant Butte dam, all water would flow
down through the community ditches
on either side of the river, being di
verted by the dam at Selden. However,
this is not the fact. The largest flood
that ever came over the Selden dam
save one, had .iti origin below the Ele
phant Butte dam, the waters flowing
In from the many canyons on either
side above the Selden dam between
i that diverting point and the Elephant
j Butte project.
"The watchman at the Selden dam
was much surprised that he had not
been advised from Elephant Butte ot
the flow of water which came down
but the engineers at Elephant Butte
knew nothing of it. This flood lasted
half an hour.
"There will continue to be seasons of
the year when the Rio Grande at El
Paso will be as dry as a bone, but
there will never be safefy in discon
tinuing the bridges, for water will al
ways come in below the Elephant Butte
dam and flow into the bed of the Rio
Grandt.

Washington. D. C. Dec. G. Interest
in the president's iTisssae of over 10 -000
words,, reaa before both houses of;
congress at roon today, centers in hs
declarations upon the interstate com
merce law, the dntltrust law. and the
general policy of the administration.
The president suggests few charges
and his whole disposition is evidently
toward an extremely conservative pol -O.
The president says in part:
Interstate Commerce.
There has not been timfe to tet a
benefit and utility of the ame-uments
to the interstate commerce law corr
taired in the act approved June IS, 1910.
Tle law as enacted did not contain all
the features which I recommended. !)
It did not specifically denounce as un
lawwful the purchase by one of two
parallel and competing roads of the
J stock of the other. (2) Nor did
j it subject to the restraining in
J fluence of the Interstate com-
merce commission the power of
corporations engaged in operating in
terstate railroads t'o issue new stock
i and bonds: (3) nor did it authorize thp.
' making of temporary agreements be-
! tween railroads, limited to 30 days,
! fixing the same rates for traffic be-
j tween the same places.
I do not press the consideration of
any Qf these objects upon, congress at
i this session. The object of the first
j provision is probably generally covered
by the antitrust law. The second pro-
I 51 refered to th consider--
i tion of a commission to be annoinTe-1
by
the executive and to -eoort unon
the matter to congress. That commis
sion has been appointed.
The third proposal led to so much
miscdnstruction Of its object, as beinsr
that of weakening the effectiveness of
I the antitrust law, that I am not dis-
; oi an railroads. I have
no doubt that
railroad companies themselves can ana

make it much less CDstly in time and.

upon an interstate or fore'gn shipment
can hold the carr'or liable for the value
of the goods descrlbeJ in the bill at the
valuation specified in he bill, at lease

reliance upon it.
I further recommend that a punish
ment of fine and imprisonment be im
posed upon railroad agents and ship-,
pers for fraud or misrepresentation in
connection with the issue of bills of
lading issued upon interstate and for
eign shipments.
Amendments Can Wait.
Except as above, I do not recom
mend anf amendment to the interstate
commerce law as it stands.
I do not now recommend any amend
ment to the antitrust law.
In other words, it seems to me that
the existing legislation with .eference
to the regulation of corporations and
the restraint of their business has
reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the 'effect of
