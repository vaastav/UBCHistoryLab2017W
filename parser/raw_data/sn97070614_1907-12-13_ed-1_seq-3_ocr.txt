CONGRESSIONAL
Opening of Sixtieth Congress.
The first day of the Sixtieth con
gress was taken up largely with the
routine business of its organization.
r-ue senate was In session only half an
"our and did nothing but swear in new
members and call the roll. There was
a slight clash of opinions as to the or-
der of these two matters, Senator
Lodge objecting to the course of Vice
rrcsident Fairbanks In having the sen
ators sworn before the roll call and
Baying It was contrary to custom.' The
vice president insisted, however, that
this had been the practice of the sen
ate for more than a hundred years.
The new Oklahoma senators, Owen
and Gore, were not recognized, and
their credentials will not be accepted
untn af ter their formal election by the
Johnston of Alabama could be sworn
until the deaths of their predecessors,
Morgan and Fettus, had been announc
ed, as the senate adjourned in honor of
the dead.
In the house the only variation from
the cut and dried routine outlined by
the leaders of the majority was the

of the former rules was moved. Mr.
Cooper said that experience had con
vinced him that the rules gave too
much power to the speaker and too lit

resent their constituents. For Instance,
when he had refused to vote for the

had refused to

declared further
that the speaker
had become the

his opinion, the

come familiar to the public through
the president's speeches during. tho
past year, and on several subjects he

Tbe United States supreme court at

Thirty-eight of the forty-three de
fendants named by the government in
its charge of conspiracy and trade
restraint on the part of the powder
trust have filed answers in the federal
court at Wilmington, all denying the
charges. The chief contention is that
the business Is not unlawful because

right to purchase other companies or
properties when considered good in

the smaller concerns were absorbed by
the voluntary consent of both parties.
