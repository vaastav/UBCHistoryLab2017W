Consolidated. The 120th and 87th

Camp Cleveland yesterday. The officers arc :

Colonel, T. J. Banning; Major, Wood
The Colonel and Major were of the 12jtb,

regiment. The newly formed regiment will
be known as the 125h. It will be mustered

Miners oh a "Steike." The coal
mieers in tbe Mahoning Valley, and in fact
throughout the e.".al regions in Northern
Ohio, have ttru. k f. r one dollar per ton for
blasting coal. The proprietors of various
mines had paid seventyfive and eighty cents
ver ton at whieb prii-e the hands can real
from $18 to $21 a week, which ought to
enough to EatUfy laborers who procure
for the people what is sometimes called
black diamonds, or bituminous coal.
' We are informed that tho proprietors of
coal mines have decided not to accede to the
demands of the strikers, but to engage new
hands.
Steam Fire Engines toe the Citt.
We are informed that the Council Committee,
who are entrusted with the business of put
ting the new steam fire engine fur the city,
. la operation, have negotiated for three horses
at a cost of about $000. They were purchased
at Atwater, Portage county, and were to be
delivered here yesterday. The men necessa
ry to run the machine have been engaged,
and all that is required to put the new engine
in commission is, the hose, which has " been
ordered and is expected daily.
The Committee, being empowered by reso
lotion of the Council at its last meeting,
have written to Amos Keig's Manufacturing
Company, Manchester, N. H , also to the Se
neca Falls Company, N. Y., to ascertain on
what terms two additional Steam Fire En
gine? can be furnished. ' It is thought that
three machines of that character will be all
that will be required in this city to extin
guish fires, and that the Fire Department
can than be disbanded and ditpensed with.
The firemen think it is a little " hard on the
boyi." ' " ' "

ever with one of tho ofLeers, perhaps the Cap
tain, and he Las gone into the winter quar
ter of eternity.- We aw in imagination sev
eral " trks fall " of biographic trpe, with a
few lines of mingled affliction and hope for
the future superadded. We asked a laiinr
whom we met, if he fcnew what the colors
were at haif-mafct on that tug for. He did'nt
know, bat after be got several rods past, he
hailed us, calling us back, and said perhaps
it was because " somebody's dead.'
We interrogated sereral individuals on the
dock, but no one appeared to be posted. Our.
only course seemed to be to pay the rug i
personal visit and aecerUin from inquiry of
those on board why the sign of mourning was
displayed on their flag-etatf. We hailed a
Charon of the Cuyahoga, (aot that " grim
ferryman pveU write of,") and getting into
his boat, went forth en our inebtnchcly mis
sion-. As we watched the dip of Charon's
oars in the water our IhouhU assumed a
sombre hue. (We felt confident that' it was
the Captain of the tug who was dirt J.) A
few dayb ago that ensign, now sadly drooping
to the memory of the departed, waved ti
ultingly in the breeze above hU head, and
ho in the pride and a.ri'uihof manhood.
Now belies low in dea!h mi vi!l soon miu
glo his dust with mother car.j. Our reflec
tions upon the end of man received a mlc
into.ruption by the b' of the boat striking
harshly against the tug, nearly capsizing us
into the dirty water uf the old river bed.
At the same time a rough voice came from
the deck of the tug " tVhere the d 1 are
you coming to?" Without heeding tbe sal-
utatiun, which grated on our er, under tbe
circumstances, we hurriedly inquired, "who
is dead?"
"Lota of folks dead," replied the gruff
Toice.
' But who is dead on the tug ? j
Xo one dead here."
' Why are your colors at half mast then ? '
we said, with a queer feeling of disappoint
menf, for which the Captain will hardly
thank us. :
" They'r huug out to dry I '
Charon ruwed us back rather quickly, and i
as we disbursed our postage s am pa we ob-
served him to lay a forefinger by the shIo of j
his ruby nose in a significant manner. I

Solihers on the Caes. Complaint
with regard to tbe outrageous conduct of
soldiers on board of railroad tratLi, is very
general on all roads over which they pass,
If a squad of thetn get on board a train,
th:y often outrage the sensibilities of tther
passengers occupying the car, epecia,lly the
ladies, by the most coarse, va'gar and pro
fane language. When tho conductor is in
formed of their proceedings and remonstnit s
wiib them, they heap their abuco upon him
and frequently assault him, brandishing
weapons and knives in his face, greatly to
the terror of the passengers. It is their
common boast that they "run" whatever
train they may happen to be on. They wake
up the wrong man in some conductors. Tbe
soldiers who behave so outrageously are often
aocompaoied by their officers, who don't at
tempt to control them, and if thf-y don't join
with the soldiers in abusing everybody in thf
ear, they wink at it. The State Jpurnal
mentions a recent occurrance on the Oil)
Central road, where a Lieutenant nuited with
his half drunfeeD men in abusing the ounduo
tur becauats tbe latter asked them to behave
themselves. Such evils cry loudly fur abate
ment.
T lie ate a, The second performance of
"Claude Cotiheur," given liiat niyht by thft
Conway s, drew a much larger audience than
tbe firM. It was well received, and mnny
prti'jtsof it were applaulc l with enthu-:
aui. It packed vff much better than at the
fiit production, alf the actors being mure
perfect in their several parts. We have al
ready expressed ourselves with regard to Mr.
Conway , considering him one of the best ac
tors that have visited Cleveland. Mrs. Con
way is ud actress of great merit. he has a
splendid figure and voice, and i ma)f uifiatut
"Marian." We hope to see her in trag
edy, in which we arc sure she exel. We
never saw McColIom play better ihn he did
li-t night. Carroll a? ''Colonel Bernard,"
did admirably. He has tbe material uf a
id actor, and improves rapidly. He i be-
eming quite a favorite, lhe cool, delibe
rate villain never found a better represen
tative than Stuart as " Baecour." Lewis as
"Simon gives a rich spice of fun to the
play.
To-night is the benefit of the Conways, on
which occasion the above play will be repeat
ed. They cannot fail to have a crowded
house.
Thk Next Lecture Bufobe tuic I.idra-
bt AssocrATioy. Rer. Dr. Thomas C. Tit
kin, of Utica, New York, is the next lectur
er in the course before tbo Library Associa
tion, 'lis subject, "The City of Yeddo'"
a new and exceedingly iut-resting one.
Fpeaking of the course b-h-re the Y. M. As
sociation in Detroit, a cotfiupcrary ays:
Among those who have been engaged
Dr. Pitkiu, who has recently returned fr-.m
a tour in China and Japan. Dr. Pitkin
possessed of rare qualifications, both bv tal
ent and opportunity, for delighting an
American audience witn an account ot Mo
and things in China and Japan. It is gen-r-ally
known that he hoi just returned from
those interesting countries, having Sent sev
eral months in each, four of them in Yeddo ,
the Japanese capital. Yedde ia a city of two
millions of inhabitant!, and a ride from one
end to the other is a day's journey. It is
the residence of all the princes of the empire.
From this place Dr. Pitkin was so fortunate
as to bring away, without exciting the jealous
iUMHCion of the ffovcrnment, many mans,
books, ike, highly umqe ani illustrative, lie
was afiorded unusual opportunities and lad)
ties for a thorough observation of the life
and manners of the people of those countries
and his course of lectures cannot fail to be of
unusual interest. He has also consented to
deliver the course before the Young Men'f
Society of Albany, New York.
Dr. Pitkin's lecture is fixed for Tuesday
evening next, December 16th, and will no
doubt attract a Urge audience.
Necromancy. Professor Sands, the fa
mous magician, will give two more perform

thoFe who have witnessed his feats, to be one

. . December 11 y a. M.
ETerythiog last night was bustle and
actiYity, at to-day was the time fixed for
crossing the river. - During the niglit the
pontoons were conreyed to the rirer, and
the artillery, consisting of 113 pieces, were
placed in position opposite the citv. At
6 o'clock this morning the rebels fired two
signal gnns, and dnring the latter part of
me nignt, rocneis were nequently seen
within their lines.
At 6 o'clock, the construction of three
bridges in front of the city was commenc
ed. When the bridges were about half
completed, the enemy opened a murderous
fire of infantry from the houses on the
river bank, aud up to this time not a shot
had been fired from our Bide. The engi
neers were driven from the bridges, and
several killed and wounded.
At 0 o'clock. General Biirnside ordered
all the guns to be opened on the city. The
cannonade which has continued up to the
present time, is terrible.
the city is on fire, and its destruction
appears certain. The enemy, about 7
o'clock this morning, opened with their
ueavy guns from their work?, but so far
have done no serious injury.
Gen. Franklin constructed his bridges
about 3 miles below the city, meeting with
but slight opposition. His troops are now
crossing and the gunboats are now shell
ing the enemy about 15 miles down the
river where they have been concentra
ting their forces for the past few days.
tne concerted nre or our batteries on
the city has had the effect of drivinir back
the enemy's infantry and the work on the
bridges has again been commenced.
lhe troops are all under armXBear the
river, prepared to rush over as soon as the
bridge.-) arc constructed.
HEADQUARTERS, THURSDAY NOON. Dec. 11
An attempt beinc made tn finish tfcn
bridges in front of the city the rebel in
fantry again open?d their fire. The artil
ery in position again opened on it, the re
sult beinir that it was firm) In .t,oi-.i
places. The enemy has used very little
amiury up io uiis time, as it woulu endan
ger uieir own men wno are holdine the
riv.-r front.
General Burnide has iust iwiuiprl an nr.
del- to conccutrate everv avaiLiM .mil
uputi the city, under the cover of the fire
of which it is believed the brido-es can he
finished. The killed nnd wounded do not
amount to more than fifty men.
HEADQUARTERS, EVENING.
1-ut lit ile firing took place bet Teen one
m i iliree, during which time all the avail
al le batteries were placed in position.
They numbered one hundred and seventy
six guns. At a signal all opened on the
city. TheCrewas terrible, but the rebel
sh-trp shooters could not be driven from
thnr hiding peaces. The shot and slitll
went through the houses, in many cases
selling them on fire, causing a dense
smoke, which, together with the explosion
of so large a quantity of powder, almost
hid the city from view.
It soon beoame evident that the bridges
could not be built except by a bold dash.
oiunteers were called tor to cross in small
boats. The order was no sooner given
than hundreds stepped forward, but all
could not go. About one hundred were
selected. They were soon on their way.
while the artillery threw a perfect storm
of iron hail on the opposite bank. They
rracneit the opposite khorp, but not with
out loss.
With fixed bayonets thev rushed upon
the enemy, killing several, and Liking one
hundred and one prisoners, who were safe
ly landed ou this" side.
At half-past four two bridges were fin
ished opposite the city, when the troops im
mediately began to crops over.
lhe enemy were soon driven from the
city back to their line of works. The two
bridges in front of General Franklin were
successfully laid early in the day, but his
troops did not cross until the two upper
ones were ready.
A suthc.cnt force is now on the opposite
side of tLe river to resist any attack that
is likely to be made.
lhe rebels fired but few guns in the
morning and none in the afternoon, al
though their works were in easy range
during the forenoon.
The rebels burnt the railroad bridge
outside of the city.
Uetween thirty and forty houses were
burnt, mostly in the business part of the
city,
During the day between eight and nine
thousand rounds of ammunition were fired
by oar artillery.
The indications are that a battle will be
fought to-morrow.
THE FIGHT AT PRAIRIE GROVE.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 11.
Gen. Blunt telegraphs to Gen. Curtis
that the rebels with whom he fought the
battle of Prairie Grove, near Fayeiteville,
Arkansas, have probably crossed the Ar
kansas river.
Tbe enemy left all of his wounded and
most of his dead on the field. One hun
dred of his wounded have died since the
battle, and a large number of the remain
der are wounded mortally.
The total loss of the enemy is estimated
by General Blunt at nearly 2,000. Our
kf s about 200 killed and 600 wounded,
most of the latter will recover.
General Herron puts the loss of the ene
my at from 500 to 700 killed and 2,500
wounded, and estimates our own loss
higher than General Blunt.
Col. Black, of the 37th Illinois, isamong
the killed, and Major Thompson, of the
20th Iowa, is among the wounded. The
enemy lost five Colonels.
FROM MISSISSIPPI.
CAIRO, Dec. 12.
An army officer fron Oxford, Monday,
reports the main body of Grant's infantry
then encamped a short distance south of
that plaoe; the cavalry ,'under Col. Dickey,
near Coffeeville, fifteen-miles from Grena
da. It was not probable tMt the infantry
would move before to-day, for the reason
that they were awaiting the arrival of sup.
ply trains from Holly Springs.
Texan Rangers hold possession of tbe
country west and south of White river.
Intelligence from Helena states that
Gen. Hovey's expedition deatroyed a por
tion of the - Mississippi Central Railroad,
burned tie bridges and otherwise obstruct
ed the Mississippi and Tennessee R. B.
Duriuglhe march they engaged the enemy
at three different points, and succeeded in
driving them back in every instance. We
had several wounded, tat none killed.

defense of the p'oop-ol'-war Cum erland,
against the rtbel irc.nelad llerhua ?130
reqomniendinu a vote of thanks to t-'e-rv-tenam
Geo. L. Warden, for the skill and
gallantry exhited by him in the battle .be
tween the Monitor end the rebel steame r
Merimac. Reported to Naval Committee.
A communication was also received
from the President answering a resolution
of the Senate calling for information and
evidence relative to the Indian barbarities
in Minnesota. Ordered printed.
The resolution relative to the arbitrary
arrests of certain citiieus of Delaware
was taken up.
-Mr. Morrell contended that the resolu
tion, as it now stood, was not a mere reso
lution of inquiry, but a charge against
the Government. and an indictment against
President Lincoln, and he (Mr. Morrell)
would vote for no such a resolution. He
claimed that in this state of war end re
bellion, with the land full of traitors and
spies, the Commander-in-Chief has the
right to arrest such men. No one, not
even the Senator from Delaware (Mr.
Saulsbury) has claimed that these men
were loyal. There had been many ar
rests made, and the proper presumption
is that the President has been arrest
ing guilty men and simply doing his duty,
lie (Lincoln) ought to do it. It will not
do to pretend that a whole State and all
its people are loyal. It is known that the
State of Kentucky has been but. a nest of
traitors. Three out of four of the able
bodied men of Kentucky have gone to
rebeldom and nobody is left there but old
women. (?) Yet the Senator from Ken
tucky (Powell) asks for eommisseration
for these men. That Senator (Powell)
had denounced the Government from the
beginning, the same as his colleague, who
followed the logical result of his reasoning
and had gone into the rebel army. But
not a single-word does that Senator (Pow
ell) offer agiinst the rebels, and rejoices
over the recent elections and says the lion
Democracy are rebuking this adminis
tration. Well, every rebel throughout rebeldom
rejoices in the ssme way, it is supposed,
ilierc will be a peace party in the North
that will force this Government into an
inglorious peace, and that party encour
aged Jeff. Davis and foreign countries in
their schemes of intervention. There
ought to be some proof that these men
were lnyal.
Mr. .Morrell contended that there was no
ground for complaint; that men were ar
rested on suspicion. Men were always
arrested on suspicion of crime.
Mr. Wright moved to amend the resolu
tion so as to make the call upon the Presi
dent, instead of upon the Secretary of
n ar. He said he knew no man was per
mitted to live in the South who had any
sympathy wilh the North; he would like
to see some of the spirit that was shown
by Stonewall Jackson when he fonnd 47
of his men skeddadling from the battle.
Ho marched them to the front of the regi
ment ai:d had every man of them shot.
Instead of this we have propositions for
conventions, &.a.
He (Wright,) would Btand by the Gov
ernment and the President. He would
have the power of the Government felt by
every I r.iitor, North or South.
Mr. Bayard argued at some length to
shun thru ttie nlT:iira uf tiio &l4o f Ken
tucky had nothing whatever to do with the
Siate of Delaware, and that true loyalty to
the country did not imply loyalty to any
single individaal. If this is a free country
the people in it certainly have a right to
inquire into the acis of the President.
Air. l'oweii said he hud said the Presi
dent bud violated the Constitution, and he
was ready to prove it. Ho defied the Sen
ator from Maine, or any Senator on this
Boor, to the lists on this question.
He denied that three out fourof the peo
ple of the Slate of Kentucky were in the
rebel army ; three-fourths of the people in
t:..i; Staie are not in arms at all, and he
believed there were more men in the Union
army thun in the rebel army. He (Mr.
Powell) wanted to iudugle in no personali
ties wilh any Senator here, as there was
a way to settle personal mailers elsewhere.
He iv.iiiied Senators to meet his argu
ments fairly. He did not biJieve this
Union could ever be restored by the force
of ai ms, therefore he had opposed the war
aud should continue to oppose it. He was
in favor of the convention proposed by
his colleague, (Davis.) He should also
vote for an armistice while that conven
tion should continue to be in session. He
contended that President Lincoln had vio
lated the Constitution in enlarging the
tegular army; in suspending the writ of
habeas corpus ; iu arresting citizens; in
interfering wilh the freedom of the press,
nnd in hi recoup proclamation.
Mr. Fessendon was willing to admit that
some things had been done apparently
without law.
The cry the "country wag in danger,"
came always from papers sympathixing
with the rebellion. Many thiugs may be
and must be done in limes like these,
which ordinarily could not be allowed.
Does anybody doubt the patriotism of the
President of lhe United Siaies? Does any
one pretend that he has not done what he
thought was best to suppress this rebellion
and preserve the country, or that he has
violated the rights of any citizen ?
JNo adiournropnt 1 " "
HOUSE.
Mr. Rotscoe Conkling asked leave to re
port a bill to establish a uniform system of
bankruptcy, and desired a day should be
assigned for its consideration.
The Speaker reminded the gentleman
that the select Committee on that subject
has expired -.villi tiio former session of
Cougi c.-s, aud would have to be revived.
Mr. Z '.ilmnu offered the following, to
lie oyer for future consideration:
Jluolet.l, By ihe. House of Representa
tives, the Senate concurring, that the Pro
clamation of the President, of November
2-'nd, lMi2, is not warranted by the Con
stitution. Rttuleed. That the notice of emancipa
tion, as indicated in the Proclamation, is
not iralculat d to hasten the restoration of
peace, is not well chosen as a war measure,
and is an assumption of power dangerous
to the rights of citizens and the perpetui
ty of a free government.
Lovejoy moved to lay the resolutions on
lhe table. Carried by 1)4 against 45.
ThcHouo then went into Committee of
the Whole on the President's Message.
Mr. Hutchins spoke at lengti, taking
for a text that freedom and slavery were
incompatible beyond hope of reconcilia
tion and compromise.
Mr. MenzLes, in replying, said he was
in the habit of regarding the enemies of
the proclamation as the friends of the
Constitution. He understood the'Senator
from Ohio (Mr. Hutchins) to be opposed
to the Union as it was. No doubt the rea
son assigned by him for the recent defeats
of the rebels were satisfactory to the gen
tleman himself; but he (Mr. Menzies)
would tell him that these disasters to that
party were attributable to the abolition
yrogrammejof the President and his party.
Mr. Men lies reoapitulated the meas
ures adopted by the Republicans, including
the abolition of slavery and the confisca
tion act, which he said were shocking to
the civilization of the age. The recent
elections, however, were more appalling
to the rebels than any thing that could
