It is retried from Washington tlmt
the revenue reform democrats in con
gress are very much incensed toward
Speaker Carlisle because he intends to
continue Mr. Kandall nt the hciid of the
committee on appropriations. They dp
not make a loud manifestation of their
displeasure , but they feel it none the
less keenly. After months of effort to
create a sentiment favorable to droj > -
ping Itamlnll from his place of power
and driving him out of the councils of
the party , it IB easy to understand that
they are w > rely dUnpjiointed at finding
their leader lacking the courage to
carry out the programme they had
urged upon him. It is not probable
that Mr. Carlisle had. cvor prom
ised to carry it out , though it is
qulto likely ho has not discour
aged the movement ho3tilo to the
Pennsylvania congressman. .It may
transpire that ho is wiser and more
far-Hoeing than the aggregated wisdom
and foresight of his followers. But
.such considerations will do little to
mitigate their present sense of disap
pointment or lessen the annoyance
they must fool that in their defeat Mr.
Ilandall is enabled to regard them with
supercilious di.sdain.
The rfucstlon of what should bo done
with Mr. Randall presented a crucial
test of the courage of Mr. Carlisle as a
political loader. There is , , of course , a
possibility that the two gentlemen have
had an understanding that warrants the
Hpeaker in retaining the leader of the
obstructive democratic faction in the
position where ho cnjoya a greater
power over the course , of legislation
than any other man in the house , but no
ono will believe in advance of positive
demonstration that such is the case. So
far as publicly known there has been
but ono brief conference between the
commanders of the hostile camps , and
it is not a reasonable supposition that
any arrangement was then made which
could have given Mr. Carlisle any sub
stantial ground of confidence that Mr.
Ilandall would not continue to bo found
in the same objectionable attitude ho
has hitherto held. lie was.not retired
by the circumstances of the situation to
make any .treaty or compact , and ho is
not the sort of man to negotiate when
ho believes ho holds the power to dic
tate. It would perhaps bo charitable to
assume that Mr. Carlisle has been actu
ated solely by considerations of expedi
ency with respect to the welfare of the
party , yet it is hardly complimentary to
his judgment to suppose that
he could believe it well to
tolerate in a position of great
power a man who is in pronounced hos
tility to the policy of the administration ,
approved by the majority of the party.
But. ono supposition remains , which
seems the most reasonable , and which
will undoubtedly bo the most generally
accepted , and that is that Mr. Carlisle
felt unequal to the task of coping with
the adroit and aggressive Pennsylvania
congressman , and therefore virtually
surrendered himself and his followers
to the control of Mr. Randall. The vic
tor may acquire added prestige , but the
general feeling regarding Mr. Carlisle
will/be that whatever virtues he has as
a leader ho is wofully deficient in
eoitrago.
CUM tics In ( lie Air.
The newspapers in each state in the
union are now pointing out to their re
spective delegations in congress the indi
vidual needs of the hour. No state
seems to be satisfied. Each ono of the
thirty-eight states and each.ono of the
eight territories clamors for all appro
priation.
Most vigorous in their demands for
recognition aro- the papers on the Pa
cific coast. A San Francisco paper in
dignantly saya it is high time' that
congress ceased to regard the Pacific
states as a sort of colony or outlying
prlrvinco , to be cared for only when the
needs and wants of every other part ol
the union have been wholly satisfied.
The Chronicle wa es eloquent , and de
mands the earth and the fullness there
of in the following manner :
At this session tlio Paoillc coast delegation
has in its power to dictate terms limtc.nl ol
suinn humbly for favors. It can , if it will
hold the balance of power , and it is unmis
takably its duly to assert itself and to de
raand the recognition for its constituents tc
which they are entitled. There is no quos *
tion of politics in getting a new postoftlce foi
this city or in improving OaWaml harbor , 01
In establishing a port of 'rcfugo on the north'
cm coast. Democrats and republicans car
unite in scouring the improved navigation o
tUe Columbia and Sacramento rivers , in ob
taining a better and more Tefflcicnt mail ser
vice , and , in short , in getting for the Pauiftt
coast wh.xt it needs.
While many appropriations will doubt
less bo secured for different section !
and cities , it is a hopeless waste of time
to demand extravagant allowances. The
president keeps his eye too closely or
the nation's treasury to ullftw it to b (
raided by politicians who "havo tin
balance of power.And by continuing
his policy of retrenchment ho will receive
coivo the hearty approval of the people
The coast must bo more moderate.
a Hotel.
The BEK has urged the building o
a million dollar hotel in Omaha
and its views receive the heart ;
endorsement of hundreds ot ou
citi/.ons who appreciate the fac
that in a very short time our hole
facilities will bo inadequate to the lu
gitimato demand. There is no enterprise
priso in which capitalists could inves
their money with a better guarantee o
safe returns. As the BEE has before sug
gcstcd if ono _ of the two principal hotel
should be destroyed by fire Omaha couh
not accommodate the traveling public
There are conventions , committees am
hundrcdtaof gathering ! } iu Omaha over ;
year , and , while the , attendance Is gen
ernlly largo , it would always bo large
if ample hotel room was assured , 1
million dollar hotel cannot bo buil
within less than two years. That porioi
of time must witness a wonderful growtl
in Omaha's population and importune *
as a commercial city.
Unless-tho project , of building a larg
and commodious hotel is pushed a
once , we will suffer in many ways
There have already been enough citizens
zons express themselves as willing am
anxious to Bubscribo.lnrgoBums'of mono ;
to such an enterprise to guarantee it
'success. It is useless to point out tin
advantages to be derived from such n :
undertaking. A company organized
this winter could got will under Way
with the work during the next year.
Will the capitalists nnd property owner -
or of Omiiha give this important mat
ter their serious Attention'/
Tlie Insurance iU'reok.
The arrest of the secretary and book
keeper of the Continental Lifo Insur
ance company of Hartford , Connecticut ,
creates n great sensation , not only
among the HOVOII thousand policy hold-
era of the corporation , but also lu finan
cial circles in Connecticut. It has boon
known for some thrio that the company
was wrecked beyond hope of repair , but
it was not expected that the olllcinls of
the concern would bo arrested. An in
vestigation of the affairs of
the Continental revealed the fact
that the officials have made falo
returns and tlmt its policy hold
ers have been duped and swindled.
Many wild-cat insurance companies
spring Into existence each year , but are
&pocdily detected nnd driven out of
business. The failure of the Continen
tal suggests that examinations can not
bo too carefully made by stnto officials.
The insurance business in the United
States is increasing greatly. The pre
miums exacted from the insured tire
sufficiently largo to justify honesty and
fair dealing on the part of the compa
nies. There is a demand for n- more
rigid enforcement of the laws relating
to these corporations.
Tun open weather that has prevailed
thus fur has permitted the uninterrupted
continuance of all kinds of out-door
work , nnd mechanics in the building
trades ns well as other "classes of labor
have been kept steadily employed to
their very material advantage. There
has been a disbursement of money in
the community aggregating a very
largo sumand as the usual winter period
is now certain to bo shortened by fully
n month the classes with whom close
economy is ordinarily urgent at this
season will feel disposed to expend more
liberally during the coming holiday
time than is their habit. There is every
reason , therefore , why our retail mer
chants may expect an exceptionally
largo holiday trades , and wo under
stand that the experience of most
of them thus far is entirely
satisfactory. The custom of gift
giving at Christmas is in all its aspects
most commendable. Like the quality
of mercy it is twice blessed , blessing
him that gives and him that takes. The
more widely it is extended and the more
generally it is observed the better , for it
is u custom in which there is on
the whole an evening up that
leaves few inequalities. The mer
chants of Omaha have never been
better prepared than this year to moot
the most liberal demands of this cus
tom. The stores of all kinds are
crowded with holiday goods in such
great variety as to to satisfy all tastes ,
and life prices in nearly all lines nrc
lower than they have been for years.
Our readers will find in the columns , of
the BEE the announcements of the spe
cial attractions offered by our most en
terprising and trustworthy merchants ,
and wo commend these to their atten
tion. .
Other Lumts Thnn Oars.
Most of the political leaders in Eng
land nre-at present very active , and will
continue so until the Christmas holi
days , when all England will put nwuy
politics nnd goto merry-making. Mean
time the ground of controversy between
the parties will bo pretty thoroughly
covered , though there will probably bo
missed from the discussion the com
manding voice of Mr. Gladstone , who
finds it necessary to husband his
strength for the struggle that will be
renewed in parliament. There have
been few political incidents within  the
week of very great interest. A friendly
meeting between Lord Randolph
Churchill and Lord Hartington has
been taken to mean a closer alliance be
tween the different sections of the prcscn t
unionist coalition. It is thought Chur
chill may return to the ministry , and
other circumstances have been noted as
indicating that the liberal unionists and
torics are in no danger from the fairtrado
agitation. Nevertheless , that agitation
will not down easily , particularity while
discontent and distress are great and in
creasing , and what it seems to need to'
render it more formidable is n loader.
Among late events which have attracted
most attention is the reported dicker of
Lord Salisbury with the Vatican. If
the object of sending the dttko of Nor
folk to Rome is the re-establishment of
diplomatic relations between England
and the Vatican , it will undoubtedly
weaken the tory party in the North
ot Ireland and among the Eng
lish evangelists. As soon as par
liament meets the ministers will be
badgered by questions from the Orange
men who represent Ulster constituen
cies concerning the new "unholy" al
liance. The torles will certainly lose
some close constituencies in Scotland
and in Ireland in consequence , and it
is not easy to see whore they can obtain
compensation for these losses. Rome
may gain in prestige throu'gh this kind
of diplomacy , but it will weaken hot
hold on Ireland , which she has held
with a gradually loosening grasp in d
political way for some time. The Irish ,
as O'Connoll said , may take their re
ligion but not their politics from Rome ,
The pope will find it a more dilllcult
matter to control the politics of Irish
Catholics than of German ultramon
tunes.

French affairs are moving in a quiol
way , but there is less confidence in the
future than immediately followed the
election of Carnet to the presidency ,
His message to the chambers was a
plain , business-like document , counsel
ing concord among republicans nnd
measures of practical reform for the
general welfare. It was such a declara
tion of policy as should have been ex
pected from a practical man , but there
seems to have boon a hope for some <
thing more stirring than business roc-
ommcyidations , and the now president
is already criticized as a man of medi
ocrity. The cabinet formed by M ,
Tirard also fails to satisfy popular ex
pectation , and a short life- for it is
predicted. It is a combination. ol
moderates and radicals , the latter beiut
thrown In with th hope thnt they will
secure fpr the ministry the help of the
various groups ot the loft. It Is very
doubtful thnt thoylwlll succeed hi doing
this , bttt the solcution of thorn secures
the passage of jjtho budget , which
is the inostjj Important work
nt present hoioro tlio govern-
mont. Thus the hope tlmt Franco
would bo for 5 considerable tlino fccuro
ngninst n recurrence of any serious
crisis 1ms given place to nn apprehen
sion thnt further' dilllcultlcs tuny hnvo
to bo mot In the near future. ThQ situ-
ntlon moro forcldly suggests the neces
sity for material mortifications nf the
French constitution before the republic
can ( jot onto safe ground.

There have been no now developments
concerning the Russian wnr scarewhich , ,
however , 1ms by no means been dissi
pated , nnd is still a prominent subject
of European interest. The Russian
newspapers , while using no menacing
language , defend the course of the gov
ernment in its Into military movements
in Poland , on the ground that
the tactics of Austria wore believed -
lioved to bo of nn Offensive char
acter. The newspapers , . however ,
point out with bomo reason that the eve
of winter is hardly the time customarily
ohoson for beginning ft campaign. It
might bo responded that it is , neverthe
less ns good a time for Russian soldiers
as for Austrian , nnd some of the former
might find less trouble in camping in
the snow. But the real reason for not
apprehending hostilities at this time is
that no quarrel exists between
Austria and Russia which could
bo made a cause of war off
hand. Germany and Italy would
certainly never stand by and see Galioia
invaded without oven the pretense of a
grievance ; and Franco is in no condi
tion now to bo relied upon by Russia at
an hour's notice. It 1s true that Austria
and Russia take conflicting views upon
the Balkan business , but Russia would
hnvo much to do before coming to blows
on that subject. That she means to
adopt a decisive policy in Bulgaria , and
in anticipation is strengthening her de
fenses on the Austrian frontier , is prob
able enough.
it-
Austria , with her present supply of
Mannlichcr magazine guns , is in much
bettor shape for undertaking a cam
paign than over before. She is also
better prepared from having followed
within the last few years the example
of her neighbors in the organization of
her reserves and militia. Exclusive of
the landsturm , her army , which on n
peace footing amounts to270,4 % men , is
increased in war to 1,043,630. The
forces of Austrjfl | nnd Germany com
bined are about $ Jual to those of Russia ,
but their P ° fg ° ' speedy mobili
zation is grcar , ns is also' that
of their conceHration by means of
railroads , and , aj&ovo all , their infantry
arms. Ruwjia has a prejudice against
nil ordinary magazine guns , although
she now admits the great possibilities
of the now small , } > ere , with its com
pressed powder and steel-cased bullet.
The three classes of militia which can
bo added to -Austro-IIungarlan
army number moro than n million men ,
but these have little training and would
bo assigned to homo and garrison duty.
With the present excitement over pos
sible-dangers with Russia there will bo
less dilllculty in procuring legislation
for improving and arming the lands
turm.
prince Oscar Charles Augustus , Duke
of Gothland , second son of King Oscar
of Sweden , who is now said to bo ac
ceptable to Russia as ruler of Bulgaria
in place of Prince Ferdinand , is a little
moro than twenty-eight years old , hav
ing been born November 15,1850. His
nomination looks like a fruit of the
czar's recent visit to his Scandinavian
neighbors. Tho-suggcstion might per
haps have been lavorably enough re
ceived nlso by the Bulgarians
if made at the proper bcaso'n ;
but the czar has hitherto been in
tent on nn possible candidates like the
Prince of Mingrelia ; even Prince Wal-
demar of Denmark anparontly failed to
find favor with him. Now that Bul
garia , in lack of reasonable candidates
from Russian nnd other sources , has
Prince Ferdinand on the throne , she
may object to putting him off again in
favor of Prince Oscar , if the latter bo
really thought of. Prince Ferdinand
himself may also object to abdicating ;
but that would bo less of a practical dif
ficulty , and , indeed , ho has already
reigned quite as long as many people
expected him to.

The effort of M. do Lossops to se
cure the privilege of issuing a lot
tery loan to obtain moro money for the
Panama canal encounters serious dif
ficulties. Not the least of these is a
very severe attack on the scheme by
M. Leroy-Bcauliou , in which ho
charges Do Lessops with lying. Ho
bhows that Lcssqjis , in his official com
munication to the government asking
for the lottery .privilege , understated
the present liabilities of his company
by the largo sum of 124,000,000 francs.
M. do Les eps , in this communication ,
stated his bontl obligations to bo
035,000,000 f r. But the official bulletin
of the bourse for the 12th of November ,
three days before the communication
was written , gave' n statement in detail
of the compnny'u'listed and outstanding
obligations , showing that they had
reached the suit df , 750,000,000 f r. exclu
sive of the shnroipvpital. To grant the
request of M. dc ? uLcssops for a lottery
loan , says M. Lorpy-Bcaulleu , would be
faimply to give tho'moral support of the
government to the belief that the' in
vestment would bo remunerative. The
government , ho continues , would com
mit an enormous fault by sanctioning
in any manner "tho always lying prom

It was recently stated that Presidcm

Baby Girls and Hoys.
Elizabeth Schtrmer.
Yes , the mother's urm is weary
Where the baby's head has lain ,
And the daily round of duty
Ceases , to begin again.
But if you your lives could fashion ,
Or could alter at your will ,
Would you choose the tired aching ,
OV the empty uruis and stilH
Better noise and healthy clatter
Than nn echo in the room ,
Better floors beyond suspicion
Of the housemaid's brush and broom ;
Than to have the nest all empty ,
All the darling nestlings flown ,
And to sit in idle quiet ,
But to sit and muse alone.
Angel forms that watch above us.
O'er our lives that vigil keep ,
Often look in pitying wonder-
Wonder that we sit and weep ;
Knowing that our Father gives us
Unrest treasures , richest joys ;
Much of cartli and some of li
Jn our baby girls and boys.
THE CITY HAIjb CONTRACT.
Moro Moves Made In tlio Mnttci
Yesterday.
Yesterday a BKE reporter met .1. C. Ilo
gan , of Ilcgan Brothers , contractors for tin
city hall basement , and asked him what hi
proposed to do with reference to the rcuiovu
of the contract for the completion of Urn
part of the work.
"Wo have ah eady taken action , " said1 ho
"I hnvo just filed a letter with the chalrnmi
of the board of public works , signifying oui
consent to the renewal of our contract to fin
isli the basement. "
HEUAS'S CONSENT.
The reporter saw Mr. Balcombo am
learned that Mr. Regan's letter had foeei
llled , and was ( 'lven.tnu same to copy , whicl
is as follows :
I'D the Hoard of Publi Works of the Clt ;

WANTS WKIISTBll'lt OFIXIOX.
During the copying Mr. Balcombc wa
busily1 cngiged In writing a letter , n ropy o
which was submitted to the BEK and runs a
follows-
OFFICB ovTnB-BoAitn op PORLIC Woims
Omaha , Dec. Ill , IS87. Hon. .1. L. Webstrr
cit > attorney. Sir : Herewith plcuso find tin
action of the city council , as certified to li ;
the city clerk , n-latlng to the renewal of tin
ItPirsn Brothers contract , with thu city o
Omaha , AUo u communication from Ilegai
Brothers consenting to said renewal.
This department mast respectfully uslc
your opinion in writing to bo filed iu thi
office n to whether the onld contract in no-
tually nnd legally renewed and in full force ,
In view of the action of all parties , aa shown
bv the pnpom herewith.
'Neither of the old bondsmen , vl/ . , James
C Hicinmu , AliHik MiGavock or John A.
Wnkefluld have signified their consent to tho.
renewal of sold contract , so fur as this oflh *
Is Informed. Yours ,
ST. A , I ) . HU.COMIU : ,
Chairman Board of Public Work * .
When Mr. Hntcombo had exchanged n few
commonplaces with Mr. Hcgan and several
other contractors , he put his letter to Mr.
WebMer In his pocket , saying ttt the time he
was going to take it to the gentleman.
A shoit time nftorward the rcpoiter found
Mr. Balcombo with the city attorney. Mr.
Webster had rend the tetter , and when asked
wh.it his opinion ou the mutter wits , said :
" 1 will wait to sco what those bondsmen
do. If you , [ addressing Mr. Bolcombo ] do
not learn whether or not they are favorable
to a i enow ul of this contiact , I shall do so
myself. Now , Ictus understand who is to
scb the bondsmen you or I. "
Mr. Balcombe Insinuated that he would
prefer the bondsmen went to him and told
him of their Intention lu the matter.
Mr. Welnter theictipon s.lid he would see
them himself ,
"Would bsmlsmen , other than those who
were on the original bond , do us well ! "
asked the reporter.
" 1 can't pass uxm | bonds. They would have
to go the council. "
"Jf this is n revival of the old contract how
can other than the old bondsmen bo used I"
Hero Mr. Balcombo Interjected n query :
"Ye * nnd where nrc you to determine whcro
the responsibility of the bondsmen ended and
that of the new ones commence i"
"If this conlriiutbo lenewcd the liability of
the old bondsmen cense ? when that of the
new ones begins. "
"You nro required to submit your opinion
on this matter , In writing , " mild the BI.K re
porter , "When will you submit It ? "
" 1 don't know , " said Mr. Webster , "I'll
wait to hear from the iRindsmcn , mid then
pcihaps there may bo no opinion required. "
W. .f. Council , late city attorney , was seen.
It was known that ho had drawn \rp Regan's
letter of willingness to renew the contract ,
Ho was told of the action of the chairman of
the board of public works , nnd asked for his
opinion as to whether now bondsmen would
do as well ns the old ones.
He did not see why the old ones would as
well ns imv. Ho didn't.thinlrthnt now ones
were at ull required. It was a pretty Inter
esting question whether the old contract had
been annulled at nil , Upon what grounds
had it been annulled i
The reporter's answer on the strength of
the authority vested lit the chairman of the
board of public woi ks by n contract between
the council and Hegnn Bros. , in Avhich , under
certain conditions , thcchairmanof the former
board was empowered ! to annul the contract.
"Yes , " said Mr. Council , "but that annul- !
mcnt is not in accordance with the charter.
You read the charter and t > eo if you find any
thing which gives thu chairman such au
thority. "
"Why , then , did you draw up such a con
tract J"
"I was working solely for the city's inter
ests , nnd I aimed to hold a club over the con
tractor's head by making the contract as
strong ns possible. Under the charter the
board of public works , the contract to the
contrary notwithstanding , can do nothing in
the way of cancelling or letting a contract
without the consentof the muyorand council.
It is understood that under the renewal or
revival or extension of the old contract that
the old bondsmen or others equally good will
bo secured , us the ca o may require.
UNION AND NON-UNION BARBERS.
The Boss Tonsorinl Artiste , It la
Claimed , Wnnt the J/atter.
The organization formed here some months
ago by the journeymen barbeis of the city ,
and which lias boon carried on successfully
thus far , seems to have impelled the proprie
tors of the leading tonsorial rcborta to band
together for mutual ptotectlon. They , too ,
have formed a ulub , and the lcldeis f it aru
Messrs. Patteison and Morrcll. A leading
member of the craft was yesterday asked
what the journeymen had done to warrant
tills combination , of employers , and replied :
"Wo haven't done a thing. We have just
been going along attending to our business.
Wo haven't raised the question of hours or
wages , never even hinted of the matter to
cur bosses. But they are going , I undci stand ,
to let us all io. I have been told that they
have decided to hnvu no union iiutn and work
ing now to get non-union men from abroad.
They haven't notified us yet of the matter ,
however. "
Neuralgic pain is usually of nn in
tensely bharp , cutting or burning char
acter. To effect a speedy and perma
nent cure rub thoroughly with Salvation
Oil , the greatest pain-cure on earth , iij
cents.
When a man is ill ho should send for
a doctor at Jonco ; but when he has a
cough or a &ore throat he needs only Dr.
Bull's Cough Syrup. 25 cents.
