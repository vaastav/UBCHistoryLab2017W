FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE
OF
PRESIDENT JOHNSON.
Delivered to Congress Tuesday
noon. December 5, 1865.
After-
follow-Citizens of the Senate and House,
of Representatives :
To express gratitude to God, in the
name of the people, for the preservation
of the "United States, -is" my first duty in
addressing you. Our thoughts next re
Tcrt to the death of the late President by
nn act of parricidal treason. The grief
of, the uatiou is still fresh ; it finds some
solace in the consideration that he lived
long enough to enjoy the highest proof
of its confidence by entering upon the
renewed term of his Chief Magistracy, to
which he had been elected ; that lie
brought the civil war substantially to a
close ; that his loss was deplored in all
parts of the Union; and that foreign na
tions have done justice to his memory.
His removal has cast upon me a heavier
weight of cares than ever devolved upon
any of his predecessors. To fulfil! my
trust I need the support ami confidence
of the people. There is but one w.iy in j
which L can hope to obtain their uecessa- j
ry aid, and that is to state with frankness ;
the priuciplcs which guide my conduct,

a great meas-
of affairs, being well aware
cicncv of my labors win, in a gre
ure, depcud ou your and their uudivided
approbation.
The Union of the United States of A
xn erica was intended by its authors to last
a long as the States themselves shall
last. " The Union ah all U pcrjtci'.tal" are
the words of the Confederation. "To
fvrr.i a more perfect Union" by an ordi
nance of the peopJc of the United States,
is the declared purpose of the Constitution.
The hand of Divine Providence was nev
er more plainly visible in the affairs of
nicu than in the framing and the adopt
ing of that instrument. It is, beyond
comparison, the greatest event in Ameri
can history; and indeed is it not, of all
events in modern history, the most preg
nant with the consequences for every peo
ple of the earth ? The members -of the
Convention which prepared it, brought to
their work the experience of the Confed
ation, of tlieir several States, and of oth
er Republican Governments, old and. new,
but they needed and obtained a wisdom
fuperior to experience. And when for
its validity it required the approval of a
people that occupied a large part of the
contiucut and acted separately iu many
distinct conventions, what is mora won
derful than that, after earnest contention
and long discussion, all feelings and all
opinions were ultimately drawn in one
way to its support.
The Constitution to which life was thus
imparted couiaius wilhiu itself ample rc-

In ezso
f the usurpation of the government
of a
State by one man, or an oligarchy, it be
comes a duty of the United States to make
jjood the guarantee to that State of a rc
publicau form of government, aud so

the lapse of time reveal defects 'I A sim
ple mode of amendment is provided in
the Constitution itself, so that its condi
tions cau always be made to conform to
the requirements of ad vaueing civilization.
No room is allowed even for the thought
of a possibility of its coming to an end.
And these powers of sclf-prcservatiou
have always been asserted in their com
plete iutegrity by every patriotic Chief
Magistrate by Jefferson and Jackson,
not less than by Washington aud Madi
son. The parting advice of the Father
of his Country, while yet President, to
the people of the United States, was, that
"the free Constitution, which was the
work of their hands, might be sacredly
maintained ;" and the inaugural words of
Presideut Jefferson held up "the preser
vation of the General Government, in its
constitutional vigor, as the sheet sfuchor
of our peace at home aud safety abroad."
The Constitution is the work of "the Peo
ple of the United States," and it should
be ns indescribable as the people. .
It is not strange that the framers of
the Constitution, which had no model in
the past, should not have fully compre
hended the excellence yf their own work.
Fresh from a struggle agaiost arbitrary
power, many patriots suffered from har
assing fears of an absorption of the State
governments by the General Government,
and many from a dread that the States
Would break away from their orbits.
But the very greatness of our country
ishould allay the apprehension of encroach
ments by the General Government. The
subjects that come unquestionably within
its jurisdiction are so numerous, that it
must ever naturally refuse to be embar
rassed by questions that line beyond it.
Were it otherwise, the Executive would
eink beneath the burden ; the channels
of iistifift would be choked : legislation
would be obstructed by excess ; so that
there is a greater temptation to exercise
some of the functions of the General Gov
ernment through the States thau to trcs-
pass on their rightful sphere. "The ab
solute acquiescence in the decisions of
majority" was, at the begiuniug of the
century, enforced by Jefferson "as the vi-

The maintenance of the Union brings
with it 'the support of the State Govern

one of the rights of any State Govern
ment to renounce its own place in the U
uion The largest liberty is to be main
tained in the discussiou of the acts of the
Federal Government ; but there is no ap
peal from its laws, except to the various
branches of that Government itself, or to
j the people, who grant to the members of
the Legislative and of the Executive De
partment no tenure but a limited one, and
in that manner always retain the power
of redress.
"The sovereignty of the States" is the
language of the Confederacy, and not the
language of the Coustitutiou. The latter .
contains thc emphatic words : ''I he Don-
stitufion, and the laws of the United
States which shall be made in pursuauce
thereof ; raid all treaties made or which
shall be made under tho authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law
of the land ; and the judges in every State

spreads
through
every Jorm ol aduimistration, general,
State and municipal, and rests on the '.
r
great distinguishing principle ot the
conniliou of the rights of man. The
re-
an-
i cient republics absorbed the individual in
, State, prescribed his religion, and
.. . ., . ' .
controlled his activity. The American
system rests on the assertion of the equal
' right of every man to life, libertj', and
1 the pursuit of happiness; to freedom of
: conscience, to the culture and exercise of
; his faculties. As a consequence, the
; State Government is limited, as to the
! General Government in the interests of
the Union, as to the individual citizen in
; the interest of freedom.
States, with proper limitations of pow

proposition of Congress needs the confir- ;

one great branch of the legislative gov- j
eminent would be wanting. And, if we ,
look beyond the letter of the Constitution j
to the character of our countrj-, its capa
city for comprehending wilhiu its juris- j
diction a vast continental empire is due j
to the system of States, ihe bestsccuri
ty for the perpetual existence of the
States is the "supreme authority" of the
Constitution of the United States. The
, perpetuity of the Constitution brings with

j he wiioic c
inot exist without the
parts, nor the part
without the whole.
So lung as the Constitution of the United
States endures, the States will endure;
the destruction of the one is the destruc
tion of the other ; the preservation of the
odc is the preservation of the other.
I have thus explained my views of the
mutual relations of the -Constitution and
the States, because they unfold the prin-
ciples ou which I have sought to soItc
the momentous oucstions and overcome
the appalling difficulties that met me at
' the very commencement of my adminis-
tration. It has been my steadfast object
n .
, to escape lrom-thc sway oi momentary
' pas.sions, and to derive a healing
policy
ugiu;:
: from the fundamental aud unchau
principles of the Constitution.
T found the States suffering from the
effects of a civil war. Resistance to the
General Government appeared to have
exhausted itself. The United States had ;
recovered possession of their forts and ar
senals, aud their armies were in the occu
pation of every State which had attemp
ted to secede. Whether the territory
within the limits of those States should
be held as couquercd territory, unuer
military authority emauating from the
President as the head Of the army, was
the first question that presented itself for
decision.
Now, military governments, established
for an indefinite period, would have of
fered no security ior the early suppres
sion of discontent; would have divided
the people into the vanquishers and the
vanquished ; and would have envenomed
hatred rather than have restored affection.
Once established, no precise limit to their
continuance was conceivable. They would
have occasioned incalculable aud exhaus
ting expense. Peaceful emigration to
and from that portion of the country is
one of the best means that can be thought
of for the restoration of harmony ; and
that emigration would have beeu preven
ted; for what emigraut from abroad, what
iudustrtous citizen at home, would place
himself willingly under military rule ?
The chief persons who would have fol
lowed iu the train of the army would
have been dependents on trie General imperfectly closed; it removes slavery,
Government, or men who expdeted profit the element which has' so long perplexed
froui the miseries of tlieir erring fellow-f and divided the" cotintry; it makes us
citizeus. The powers of patronage and ' ohce more a united people, renewed and

under the President, over a vast popu-jto mutual affection and support,
lous, and naturally wealthy region, are' The amendmedt to the Constitution be-,
greater than, unless under extreme neces-1 ing adopted; it would remain for the
sity, I should be willing to entrust to any States, whose powers have been so long in
one man; or, unless on occasions of great abeyance to resume their places in the
emergency, consent to exercise. Thewil- two branches of the National Legislature,
ful use of such powers, if continued and thereby complete the work of res
through a period of years, would have toration. Here it is for you, fellow-citi-endangered
the "purity of the general ad- zens of the Senate, and for you, fellow
ministration and the liberties of the States citizens of the House of Representatives,
which remained loyal. J to judge, each of you for yourselves, of

plied that the States whose inhabitants' Ihe full assertion of the powers of the
may have taken part in rebellion had, by General Government requires the hold

exist. Dut the true theory is, that all within the districts where their authority
pretended acts of secession were, from the has beeu interrupted. Iu the present
beginning, null and void. The States posture of our public affairs, strong ob
canuot commit treason, nor screem the jections have been urged to holdiug those
individual citizens who may have com- courts in auy of the States where the re- ,
nutted treason, any more than they can
make valid treaties or engage in lawful
: commerce with any foreign Power. The
Statc attempting to secede place them -
selves in a condition where their vitality
was impaired, but not extinguished
their functions suspended, but not des-
troyed.
' Rut if any State neglects
or refuses to
perform its offices, there is the more need
w -
that the General Government should
maintain all its authority, and, as soon as
t i .1 n ii
pracucaoie, resume tne exercise or an its
functions. On this principle I have ac-

by almost imperceptible steps, sought to
restore the rightiui energy or tne general .
Government and of the States. To that
end, Provisional Governors have been ap- (
pointed for the States, Conventions call-,

tnony and renewed attachment to the
Union that, after all that has happened,

I kuow very well that this policy is at
tended with some risk ; that for its suc
cess it requires at least the acquiescence
of the State which it concerns; that it
implies an invitation to those States, by
renewing their allegiance to the United
States, to resume their functions as States
of the Union. Dut it is a risk that must
be taken ; in the choice of difficulties, it
is the smallest risk ; and to diminish,
and, if possible, to romOVQ all danger, I
have felt it incumbeut on me to assert
one other power of the General Govern
ment the power of pardon. As no State
can throw a defence over the crime of
treason, the power of pardon is exclusive
ly vested in the Executive Government
of the United States. In exercising that
power, I have taken every precaution to
connect it with the clearest recognition of
the binding force of the laws of the Uiu
ted States, and an unoualified acknow
' ledgenieut of the great social change of

The next step which I have taken to
restore the constitutional relations of the
States, has been an invitation 4o them to ,
; participate in tho high office ot amending
' fhn Constitution. Every patriot must
wish for a general amnesty at the earliest
epoch consistent with public safety. For
this great end there is need of a concur-
renccofall opinions, and the spirit of
mutual conciliation. All parties in the ; franchise to ine irccumeii, uy act oi tuu

and, at the same tnno the question may
be judicially settled, finally and forever,
that no State of its. own will has the right
to renounce its place in the Union.
The relations of the General Govern
ment towards the four millions of inhab
itants whom the war has called iuto freed
om, have engaged my most
serious con-
sidcration. Ou tho propriety of attempt-
ing to make the freed men electors by the
proclamation of the Executive, 1 took for
my counsel the Constitution itself, the
interpretations of that instrument by its
authors and their contemporaries, and re
cent legislations by Congress. When, at
the first movemcut towards independ
ence, the Congress of the United States
instructed the several States to institute
governments of their own, they loft each
State to decide for itself the conditions
for the enjoyment of the elective fran
chise. During the period of the Confederacy,
there continued to exist a very great
diversity in' the qualifications of electors
in the several States ; and even in a State
a distinction of qualifications prevailed
with regard to the officers who were to
be chosen. The Constitution of the Uui
tcd States rdcoguizes those diversities
when it enjoins that, in the choice of
members of the House of Representatives
of the United States, "the electors in each
State shall have the qualifications requi
site for electors of the most numerous
branch of the State Legislature.
After the formation of the Constitu
tion, it remained, as before, the uniform
usage for State to enlarge the body of its
electors, according to its own judgment;
and, under this system, one State after
another has proceeded to increase the
number of its electors, until now univer
sal suffrage, or something very near it, is
the general rule. So fixed was this re
sp.rvjitinn of nower iu the habits of Jie
people, and so unqucstioucd has beeu the
interpretation of the Constitution, that

which, during the continuance of hos

have sanctioned any departure by the
