MEXICO IN 1848 AND TODAY.
The condition of anarchy and war
fare that now exists in Mexico, and
our present, negotiations with that
country, together with the events
that led up to the treaty of 1848,
show a very striking similarity. If
history repeats itself, the I'nited
States will sooner or later be forced
t0' assume control of part, if not all,
of ttie great region south of the Rio
Grande and the Mexican boundary
line, extending to the Panama canal.
This may not be brought about by
direct intervention in the present
war between the factions in Mexico,
hut the logic of history and the ne
cessities of modern civilization will
in some way, force this issue to a
vonclusion.
Most European governments, plac
ed in the same position as the United
States, would have long before this
found some excuse for war and a
conquest of Mexican territory. But
the national policy of the United
States is of a higher type, .and when
this nation assumes responsibilities
for the government of an inferior
race, it does so peacefully if possi
ble, and expects to give and does
give great benefits to both the coun
try and the people: restores law and
order, and offers opportunities to all
who deserve it to make homes and
get the most out of life consistent
with safety ami prosperity of the
nation .as a whole.
Many good American citizens,
while deploring armed intervention
In Mexico, still believe that the wis
est course will be for the United
States in the near future, to take a
strong hand in the suppression of the
atrocities that are now occurrng in
the Mexican rebellion, and which
there is no prospect of being perma
nently ended, whichever faction wins
a temporary victory. The Mexican
people as a race are not adapted to
or qualified for a modern, progres
sive self government. Centuries of
education and development will be
required for them to reach that
stage. The world of today cannot
wait on such slow progress.
In 1848 the United States was
granted by Mexico what is now the
states of California, Nevada. Utah,
half of Colorado, most of Arizona
audi New Mexico. This territory ex
tends along the Pacific and eastward
more than 1,000 miles, has a greater
population today than the entire
United States had when it declared
its independence from Great Britain,
and comprises an area of nearly
.700,000 square miles. It equals iu
extent all of Great Britain, Ireland,
France, the German Umpire, Ttaly,
Norway and' Sweden, and has become
the home of millions of prosperous
citizens. If Mexico had retained it,
who can doubt but the same condi
tions that now prevail south of the
Rio Grande would be seen in the ter
ritory ceded to the United States?
The d'estiny of the English speak
ing race is manifestly to dominate
and develop all of North America.
The progress of white man's supre
macy, operating under the great nat
ural law of survival of the fittest,
will force this sooner or later. No
progressive administration in this
country can Ignore this and long re
main at the head of national affairs.
POWERS OF REPUBLICAN NA
TIONAL COMMITTEE.
The question is being agitated
among political leaders of the repub
lican party whether it is advisable
to call a special meeting of the na
tional committee this coming spring
or at gome later date. The object,
if done, is to discuss plans for a par
ty reorganization. The executive
eommittee of the national committee
in May last requested the chairman
of the national committee to call a
special convention to be held within
60 days after the expiration of the
special session of congress which
began in March of the present year.
There are manifestly many defects
in the machinery of the republican
national convention which need to be
corrected in the interests of fairness
and actual representation. It is
possible that a special meeting of the
committee will be bad next year, al
though there is a divided opinion At
to the necessity for it. There is one
conclusion, however, that has been
announced by the legal committee,
which is that the national committee
has no authority to change the basis
of representation and voting. The
committee can change the manner
and method of choosing delegates to
future conventions to conform with
the laws of the several states as they
may be passed from time to time, but
not otherwise. The national com
mittee can, however, call a special
national convention of the party.
The matter of representation in
southern states has been brought to
the front by the last two national
conventions, and it will have to be
adjusted on different basis from
what has heretofore prevailed. The
Washington, D. C., Star, supposed to
reflect the views of many leading
members of the party, declares that
a special convention should be held
next spring for the purpose of re
uniting the protectionist members of
the party before another congres
sional election, which will be decided
by tiie issues raised in the recent
democratic tariff bill. In this con
nection the Star suggests that Orms
by McHarg, who did work for the re
publican committee in the south
and recommended that the votes of
that section be given to Mr. Roose
velt in the last convention, be made
a delegate to the convention, and
that the information thus acquired
be received, although it was made
unavailable by the national commit
tee at the last meeting. A certain
interest still attaches to the infor
mation and conclusions of Mr. Mc
Harg, says the Star. Both republi
can and progressive factions of the
party are by this time probably con
vinced that there is only one plan of
action that will bring success, both
in national and state elections, and
that is a united support of the par
ty's policy, principles and candidates
as agreed upon at a really represen
tative gathering of the delegates of
the party, or as may be decided by
popular choice at primary elections.
NOT A PRACTICAL REMEDY.
President Wilson urges in his
message that farmers be given more
opportunity to get credit for the bor
rowing of money. This he seems to
thni'k will restore to the business of
farming a certain remedy which is
lacking and which has caused the de
cay of agriculture in this country
as compared with manufacturing,
and the building of cities. But it
is very evident that farmers with the
resources of the average equipped
farm can already borrow all the
money the value of the property, will
justify in the open market.
It is not the borrowing of money
the farmer needs to makp Mm pros
perous, but the prices for his pro*
ducts which will give him a profit
on his investment and labor. Then
there will be no meed of easy bor
rowing of money, for that only tends
to make anyone careless of the re
payment.
Easy farm credSts may be all right
for the development of certain la
tent national resources, but whiat
farmers of the country need is a
steadily profitable price for what
they produce, and which is paid by
the consumer, but not to the farmer.
Then farmers will not need1 to bor
row money. Rural farm credits as
they are found in European coun
tries, may not be applicable to the
United States.
From the dawn of history the
farming industry has borne the real
burdens of taxation ,and has been
exploited by every other class. To
materially change this fundamental
rule of all nations, other means than
the easy borrowing of money will
be necessary. Unless the repayment
is equally easy the process will only
put the farmer further in debt and
more dependent on the money lend
er. Mr. Wilson's scheme of easy
borrowing as 4ielp to the farmers
may be sincere in intent, but will
not be practicable in operation. It
is not the solution of a problem
that has been made all the harder to
solve by the new Wilson tariff bill
which throws unfair burdens of
raising public revenues on the indus
try of farming.
THE ANTI-SNUFF LAW DECISION.
The supreme court's decision in
the anti-snuff law in North Dakota
contains some interesting points,
and under the decision the legisla
ture is given broad authority in the
passage of such bills as affect or
menace the state of public health or
morals. THe higher court sustained
the ruling of the district court that
the law was sound and basedi upon
the constitution of the state. It is
reported that the manufacturers of
the tobacco sold upder the form of
snuff will appeal to the United States
supreme court. The court holds that
the title of the act which was assail
ed and which relates to muff only,
is broad* enough to cover the sab-
stitutes for that product. The court
also points out that the definition for
the word snuff is well established in
North Dakota in the popular mitad,
and means not only the old fashioned
act of holding finely groundi tobacco
between the thumb and fore finger
and drawing it up into the nasal cav
ity, but also includes the act of tak
ing the snuff into the mouth or plas
tering it upon the gums where it can
be absorbed rather than masticated.
This latter definition of snuff has
come into common usage according
to the theory of the court, by the
common practice of so using the
snuff. Definitions in dictionaries do
not give words their meaning, but
only chronicle what has been done
and the use must precede the chron
icling. Exempting from the anti
snuff act of 1913 "ordinary plug,
fine cut or long cut chewing tobacco
as now commonly known to the trade
of North Dakota," does not render
such statute invalid, or class legisla
tion. The court's idea of the use of
snuff in the mouth is a practice that
can be secretly done and easily con
cealed, and is especially injurious to
young boys. The court also notes
that there is a general fear in the
community that drugs and opium
are and can be more easily mingled
with snuff and less easily detected
than ini other forms of tobacco, and
this danger can lawfully be guard
ed against by the legislature.
GIVE FARMERS A PROFIT.
A great many organizations, asso
ciations and better farming move
ments are beihg created throughout
the country, largely by men from
the cities and towns who are financ
ing the first cost of these undertak
ings. They are doing good work,
and are proving valuable aid in
many cases. But according to the
views of one of the leading lecturers
on farm topics. Peter Radford of
Fort Worth, Texas, a great deal more
can. be accomplished by securing a
farmer a. reasonable profit on his
product than in any other way. Mr.
Radford says:
"Profit is the greatest incentive to
production and compulsory educa
tion that the world has ever known.
The farmer is human. He works for
money, anid he will intensify and di
versify whenever it pays him to do
so, and no amount of well written
formulas or monstrous exhibits will
permanently influence him quite so
much as a dollar at the end1iBfet'he
row. Not a theoretical dollarjfbut
one he can put in his pocket. A
dollar that comes from the result of
a sale. The weakness of many plans
that have been commissioned and
thrust upon the farmer is that the
factor of profit has not been duly
considered. The farmer is also
misunderstood."
The speaker declared that it was
unfair to judge the farmers as a
class by isolated cases of incompe
tency, or to consider him incapable
of solving his own problems. Far
mers must be organized, he declares,
anid there must be a co-partnership
between the business of farming and
the transportation companies, the
agricultural departments of the state
and nation and other industries.
Farms of the United State produce
an annual value of produce greater
than any other agricultural country
in the world. The American farmer
is today the most capable workman
in the history of the world's agri
culture. Failures in business and
manufacturing are much more nu
merous than the case of the individ
ual farmer.
One of the most noted women in
the Uniited States twenty-five years
ago, haB recently died in squalor and
poverty. Miss Phoebe Cozens, first
woman lawyer in the United States,
a brilliant speaker, lecturer, antir
prohibitionist and also a suffragist
for 40 years, died at the age of 73
in St. Louis, bed ridden and in squal
idi quarters. The end of a brilliant
and promising life was a sad one.
Miss Cozens was the first woman
marshal. She in later years chang
ed! her views in regard to woman
suffrage. Whether this had anything
to do with her misfortunes or .jiot,
is only a surmise, but it is Bald that
aid for her condition was hard to ob
tain, although the breweries of the
country have often befriended her
in her poverty.
The National Tribune, published!
at Washington, D. C., the organ of
the G. A. R., suggests Senator Mc
Cumber of North Dakota as an avail
able and capable presidential can
didate. Senator McCumber haB made
a record with which the farmers of
this country as well as the G. A. R
veterans are apparently well satis
fied. The Tribune says that Sena*
tor McCumber's clean life and envia
ble record would bear with the great
est cecurity the fierce light that
beats upon every candidate for -the
presidency,
RECALLED TO MEXICO.
Rev. Allan Burleson to Be Rector in
Mexico City.
Rev. J. K. Burleson, who was
among the visiting clergymen at
tending the recent Clericus of the
Episcopal church at Jamestown, re
turned) to Grand Forks accompanied
by Bishop Mann, who preached his
last sermon in the state at Grand
Forks Sunday morning, as the bish
op of North Dakota. Rev. Allan
Burleson, brother of the Grand
Forks rector, and also a former
Jamestown rector, has been visiting
in Grand Forks. He has been called
to Mexico City, where he will be rec
tor of the Episcopal church at the
capital of the troubled republic.
Rev. Burleson was formerly pastor
of the church at Buabalajala, where
he had been for many years.
The new position will be one of
the best in the republic of Mexico.
The pastor at Mexico City died sev
eral days ago, and Rev. Burleson was
called to take his place,, and left on
Monday night.
In a public address at the state
university Rev. Burleson declared
his belief that the United States
should have recognized the Huerta
government. He states that while
the rebels often gain in strength and
numbers for a time, they will not
maintain a stable government.
He declares that the real cause of
the trouble was that the people there
are still in a state of feudalism and
that as far as education is concerned
our sister republic is far behind
most of the countries of the civil-
•t
ized world. The need of teachers
and proper schools in the country, is
strongly advocated by the Mexican'
rector, and he believes that the
United States could do a great deal
more for the country in sending a
smaller number of teachers than in
sending great forces of soldiers.
BLIZZARDS DISAPPEARING
IN NORTH DAKOTA.
Old timers of North Dakota are
recalling former seasons when the
freeze-up was as regular almost as
clock work, and could bs counted on
to occur between November 4 and
10 in each and every year. Previous
to 1905 this was an almost invaria
ble rule, but since then the real
freeze-up period has been changing,
and evidently some decided modifi
cation of North Dakota's winter
climate is going on. Frank Bennett,
who kept weather record for many
years, says old timers remember that
it was common to have blizzards of
several days extent, and in the win
ter of 1883-84 there was a six day
blizzard in which the snow and! wind
blew continuously for that length of
time, with but a few hours interrup
tion. In recent years there have
been no such storms and North Da
kota has lost its unenviable reputa
tion of being the "blizzard state."
The winter seasons are now very
similar to Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin
and other middle states.
