"Let a Greater Red Cross Be Your

"Let a greater Bed Cross be your
Christmas gift to the nation and to our
allies" is the slogan which has been set
up by those in charge of the? campaign to
secure 10,000,000 new members which be
gins next Monday to continue one week,
and as far as arrangements for the big
drive concern Brattleboro and Windham
county they are progressing satisfactorily.
Supplies are daily being received at head
quarters in the board of trade rooms and
in turn forwarded, to those who have been
appointed chairmen of committees in the
various towns, so that Monday morning
everything will be ready to begin the ac
tive canvass.
Several copies of the report of Red
Cross activities from the outbreak of the
war to Nov. 1, 1917, have been received
by County Chairman Oscar F. Benson and
provide much interesting reading with
complete statistics of all money received
and how it has been expended. They
contain 144 closely printed pages and are
neatly bound so as to be preserved for
reference.
Those who are now members of the
Red Cross are urged to call at headquar
ters and receive one of the service flags
to which they are entitled, as well as the
new members. They will be furnished
without cost. On Christmas eve it is
hoped that these flags will be in 15,000,
000 homes for patriotism, for humanity
and as an expression of true Christmas

HOSPITAL BOARD SESSION.
(Continued from Page 1)
A. class of five pupils will be admitted
to the institution Jan. 1, owing to the
demand of the government for addition
al nurses to take the place of those
called for military service, but a larg
er number cannot be accommodated
and present quarters are crowded.
Within the past year a dietitian has
been added to the house staff with a
consequent improvement in buving and
serving methods' and additional instruc
tion facilities to pupil nurses. Im
proved supervision of operating room
supplies also has been brought about.
What the hospital needs to accomplish
its full measure of usefulness is a
nurses' home, a maternity ward and a
laboratory for pathological and re
search work.
"The Light of the Supreme Ideal."
The last great question, which an em
battled world must ask Germany is:
"Are you ready to join in such a reor
ganization of the world as shall make
future world war a far impossible as
good will, statesmanship and foresight
can make it ? When you are ready, we
are ready, but not until then." For the
world's quarrel with Germany is radi
cally that she incarnates, as no other
State in modern history, a creed nnd
an ambition under the threat of which
her neighbors cannot live', and the one
thing supremely to be sought and
tought for is that she should see this.
It will be idle or next to idle to
debate about annexations or indemni
ties while the roots of international es
trangement are all alive, or to make
the map of Europe except in the light
of a supreme ideal. It is this ideal
which we must define and exalt, toward
which we must, struggle; a league of
nations, not balanced and jealous
groups; a court of last appeal estab
lished in common consent aud not in
autocratic will, the control of what
armed force the Avorld really needs in
impartial hands, the needs and rights
of humanity set high above greed or
imperial ambition end the kingdom of
God not as a battle-darkened light but
a rising splendor. . This is what their
marching away must mean. This is
what they may worthily live for and
gloriously die for. These are, the holy
meanings with which we must charge
the great adventure of the republic.
