of the Central PI'cific railroad. T'hey were
first sug.ested, says the lieno Gazi tIe, by its
practical vice president, Charles Crocker. but
hia companions hesitated through fear of
impracticabilty and expense. They are of
two kinds, one with very steep roofs and the
other with flat roofs. They cost per mile
from $S,000 to $12,000, arnd In some places,
where heavy masonry was needed, the cost
reached $30,000 a mile. They are firmly
constructed to support the heavy weight of
snow and resist the rush of as alanches. Fire
precautions are also very thorough. Corru
gated plates of iron sepalate the buildings
into sections, ard In the great ten-mile shed
there are automatic electric fire ala ms. At
the Sumlmit is an engine and tant always
ready to flood the Ignited spot. These sheds
shut out the view of the greet Sierras, but
without them the winter travel would be Im
possible. Sometimes five feet of snow falls
upon them in a day, and often thirty feet lie
upon the ground at one time; and In man
aTE idea is beginning to dawn in many
eastern people that there Is something "in a
name." They discounten.sced oleomargar
itie. It was a vile compound. They deter
ruined to have the pure thing, and bought
"creamery butter." Oleomargarine was so
delusive a counterfeit that table experts
could not detect it. Hence the only protec
tion was to buy only from manufactureas of
"creamery" butt-r. We have had some of
this "creamely" butter in Montana. It
was good because it was brantded "cream
ery" butter and sold at a high price. But
these eastern people have raised a suspicion.
They have found that the "creameries" are
supplied with the oleomargatine oil. They
have found also that "creamery " cows ate
producing as high as forty pounlds of butter
each per week. With a lack of faith that
dlscounts Ingersoll, they claim there is a
swindle, and that the ' creamery " men are
supplied with oleomargarine oil, which they
mix with the cream and thus have so much
"creamery" butter for sale. Mo0e than
this, they have gone through the stataisics
of manufacture, export and creamery pro
duct, and are disposed to prove It. Oleo
margarine is said to be pure and healthful,
and hence the expert cannot tell the differ
ence. It does not seem there is much cause
for complaint. But by the t;me this "cream
ery" butter teaches Mo:! ana and slands a
few weeks, it is rancid. Wilen the ve y best
of dairy and packed butter can be had from
our ranclmen, why should Montana import
the manipulated grease from the east ?
THE E lRTARt YHtiP.
It is about time another Secretary for Mon
t1as were being appointed. On Octoberlst,
18I1, a letter was transmitted from which the
following is an extract:
To the I'reideet. Washington, P. ;:.:
iist--1 have the Ionor to say that mny com
nitiinl as Secretary of Montana will expire
ov. '7t n, 18511. Although esteeming it aln
honor to be identified with your administra
t;on, anld in accord with, what I anticipate
will be its pollcy. I respectfully state that I
am not an applicant for reappolutment. My
inclinations are to business pursuits, and
there are many who desire the position of
Secretary. "
JAxas H. MILLS,
Secretary, etc.
Reference was made to the publicatioon of
the Laws and the finuancial matters connected
therewith, with the suggest ion that the Treas
wry Department might perhaps deem it more
desirable to make the new appolatment take
Ieet Jan. 1, 1885. As the secretary holds
until his successor Is appoluted and qualiLes
by oath and bond, it is presumed It was con.
aidered eut to defer the succession unil the
date named, and as the Laws haveslue been
priated and the audit by the Treasury
Department made, there appears ao reason
why the appelateent should be deferred
many days Ioer.

cretly practiced. It Is not creditable that a
l from this latter date until now the United in

lie the law against the crime of bigamy, which m
e is done itl every other Territory and in every to

itr mols claim polygamy as a part of their rell
w gill and take refuge behind their alleged of
ed constitutional rigihts. They, or a iy other of at
SIs the hundred sects in existence, might just as o0
ith properly claim anty other crime to be a part el

D)EATH Or JOHN W. FORNEY.
John W. Forney, one of the two most
plominent Journalists in Penusylvania, is
dead. He was born in Lancaster, in 1'17,
and took a regular apprenticeship as a
printer. In 18.5 he assumed the editoeship
of the PecnylJanaa, an influential Demo
cstatic paper. Six years later he became
Clerk of the House of RepoesentaJves, and
in 1Fi was a candidate in Pennsylvania for
the Senatorship, and defea.ei by a few
votes. He went to 'hiladelphia and
started the Press, end was a great power in
secutitg the nomiali.on and eleciton of
Buchanan. Duriun the Lecompton strife in
Coigress he turned ajainst Bcbhanan-;n.
dured thereto it has been surmised by
Buchanan having failed to give him a Cabi
net appolutment-and thetlreforward until
1880 acted with the Bepuhlicans. Du,';t3

was editor of the Waslingloo Chrou;cie
and Philadelphia Preas, pea.,r. that exec ed

Mr. Forney was a tapid and able writer. anI
indefatlgable worker, and one of the best
informed men In the count ry, doing an im.
meniiky of work beside that enumerated.
Ilia weak points wese h:s disposillon, like
Abbott, to exalt his favos ites o a pinnacrle of
woship. to condemn his enemies uwhrarnta

delphia December 9th.
The other great editor of Pensylarlaia is
Colonel A. K. MeClure, of hbe Philadelphia
Thees. He is about the usame ae .s Colonel
Forney. He bkerned the plintib alineus
in Columbia, and soon afte sited the

THE PARAMA CANAL. w
The questions growing out of the proposed be
interoctanec waterway across the Isthmus of }I
e Paiarna are of grave national importance. t
Thins Government has not been unmindful ti
I of the snlemn obligations imposed upon it p
it by its compact of 1546 with Colombia, the qi
d independent and sovereign mistress of the 1
, territory crossed by the canal, and has sought ti
to render them effective by fresh engage- ri
s ments with the Colombian Republic, looking qi
7 to their practical execution. The negotla- 0
r- tions to this end, after they reached what ap- r
1-peared to be a mutually satisfactory solution u
here, were met in Colombis by a disavowal i n
of the power which its envoy had assumed, b
af and by a proposal for renewed negotiation ti
as on a modried basis. Meanwhile this Gov- n
rt e unment learned that Coluuba had proposed Ii
to tile European Powers to join In a guaran- p
it tee of tile neutrality of the proposed Panama
id Cainal, a guarantee which would be iii direct
I. contravention of our obligation as the sole
id guarantor of the Integrity of Colombian ter
ritory, and of the neutrality of the caual it
at self. My lamented predecessor felt it his °
duty to lay before the European Powers the t
as reasons which make tile prior guarantee of
ill the United States indispensable, and for
wl iclh the imterjection of any foreign guar
to antee might be regarded as asuperfluous and
if- unfriendly act. Foleseeing the probable re
be liance of the Blritish Government on tlhe pro
visions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850,
as aIlirditg room for share in the guarantees
which the United States covenanted with
ve Colombia four years before, I have not hesi
ud tated to supplement the action of my prede
es cessor by proposing to Her Majesty's Gov
ertnment the modification of that instrument
P' and tile abrogation of such clauses thereof
a as do not comport with the obligations of the
ses United S ates toward Coloumbia or with the
on- vital reeds of the two friendly partiesto the
compact.

Irt I approve the recommendationr of the See

of the policy of the government to maintain

The receipts last year werse S,785, 8. be
Int $.1469,918 in excess of the psevious year.
The deficit supplied by the Treasury was
$2,481.129. The number of letters mailed

been decreased in length 8,049 miles, and in
cost P81,144. Nearly all of tbe mote ex
pensive routes have been superseded by rail
road service. The cost of the star se, vice

TaE iNDIAN qCsrTIOIo.
1. I recommend the passage of an act
making the laws of the various 8(ates and
Tearritories applcauble to he Indian reserva
,sons within their borders, andsirtendingtl e
laws of Arkansas to that portion of the In
dian Ternitory not occupied by the ive civil
Ized tribes. The Indian should receive the
protection of the law; he should be allowed
to maintalu in court his sighas of person and
property. Be has repeatedly begged for this
privilege. Its exercse would be ve y valua

2. Of even greater impoiaance Is the meks

quanitty of land. secured to them by patent
and for their own pretec ion made jiadlena
ble for twenty or twenty-6ve years, is de

deeleton of the Supreme Cornnot the United
States, explaining Its Judgment In revesal dl
a. the case of Miles, who had been convicted B
of bigamy ir Utah. The Court refers to the K
fact that the secrecy attending the celebra
tion of marriages in that Territory makes r
that part of polygamy very dificult to prove, c
and the propriety is suggested of modifylug o
tnate law of evidence which now makes the
wife incompetent to testify agalst her bhut
band. This suggestion is approved. I rec
eommeod aIso the mpassing of an et providing
that in the Territories of the United States
the fact that a woman has been mnarried to a w
person charged with bigamy shall not dis
qualify her as a witness upon h.s trial for S
that offense. I further recommend legisla- I.

or refusal, to file a certificate of such ma.
risae in the Supreme Court of the Territory, A

measures for obviating the difficulties which

lawful and discreet measures which may be r
proposed to that end.
CIVIL SnRVICE.
The question of civil service is considered t
at length, and the President inclines toward
the adoption of amodificationof the English t
system rather than the compeitive examina- I
tion system advocated by many.
The Message closes with a recommenda
tion for speedy legislation concerning the
vote of Presidential Electors, and an actde- 1

President and which was so fully discussed
during the recent disability of President
Garfield.
h THE MORMON QUESTION.
Governor Neil, of Idaho, Offers His opinions.
it NEw Yonct, December 12.-Gov. Nell, of
if Idaho, now here, was interviewed yesterday
e by a Tribune reporter on the subject of Mor
e monism. The Governor said: Mormonism
is a serious questionon the Pac;i0c Coast,and
Mormons are making special effors to coln
's trol Territories outside of Utah, where they
have already complete mastery. If the press
o of the country would discuss the question
me thoroughly, a sentiment would soon be cre
e sted that would compel Con;ress to art mu
the mailer. I should also like to say hat the
e- division of pailes in U.ah is "In sympathy
of with Mormonism" and "Anti-Mormon."
y There are no Republicans or Democrats
known as such there, and I find among the
d stanchest Anti-Mormons such men as Judse
e- Roseborough, Judge Sutherland. and Col.
e Samuel Menitt. and many other prominent
SIDemocrats, all as hostile as any Republicans
to to the prevailing system. It is part of the
plan of the Mormon Church to populate the
surrounding Territories and States with its
al adherents, with the view of ultimately gain
i- log political eon. rol of them and then bar
gaining with ei her of the political partiesto
), have the Territorles admitted as States, thus

In my opinion the No-mon Chioch is more
'- of a political than a religions organization,
ae and I am convinced that it is a treasonable
t- orgaoizat ion. I believe that all the mem

in House take an oath of hostility to the Gov
ernment, and I have myself heard treason
ble doctrines preached in the Salt LakeTab.

- imnately necessary to deal with the question
ie from this standpoint, unless Cong-ess adopis

an vent the practice and splead of polygamy,
On for that ie the couer-stone of the Church.
rou Polygamy gives all who join the society a
Amt community of interest in crime, and Ihat is
'or why the p,iests insist strenuously on the
in practice of polygamy. The- know that fu
'' sterest in crime will stienlthen lhe Church
mly and make it better able to stccompl;sh its de

i, out of a total of 7.500 in the county. In
s. Cosseau county they have a number of set
ry tlements and are enabled by thlrowlg their
i votes for those who are friendly to them to
i- decide electlions. The Territory has a popu
iation of about 410,00, and time Mormons
number nearly 10,000. Mornmoolsm is op.
d- posed to all inrmdustries, particularly to mm
Iu lg, which is the greatest interest of the Pa
cfic slope. If time Mormons haod tie powe
e they would not permit an ounce of ore to be
he e;oed, nor, indeed, would they allow any
persons hostile to their peoenllar institutions
to settle in their midst. I am fmnqmently
be-asked how,in afree eounty like ihis, the
Mormon priesthood exercimes so comnplete
ed control over the followers of tlme Churi;h. It
leg is easy of te planation. TheMormon lpopl
in- laton is largely made up of the lowest and
' most superstiious clases of frme;gners. In
. their own truottles they were accustomed to
we submit to priestl;y domination or they iLved
in underadespotie Government. When ,aou.ht
Sto Americae they are put on the cars at New
ce York and talken as rapidly as possible to
t- Utah, where they mare placed for settlement
in exclusively Mormon communities. They
have eaet no;thblng and know nodhing of
American institutions, and are permitted to
learn mohingof them. They ate bited
.e eonstotly by Mormon priesl and their con
In- det is wamched. oI factthere is ibe moest
eemplete system of espolisge that could pc
ed sibly he delrvsed. It is not surprising, then,
a that they submit willingly to that which
i they are saccstomed to In the counotries from
Swhich they tame; and agai, before they
cam e tes, they bad nothinmgpobably which
atheycould eal teirowa. Bere, after do

died at Santiago on Sunday last. General e
llpatrick was born near Dickertowa, N. J., do
on the 14th of January, 1886. He graduated a
from West Point in the class of 1861, and re-. ii
ceived a commission as Second Lientenant fe
of artillery. He at once entered the volun
teer service as a Captain in the Fifth New bI
York Regiment. He was wounded at the si
battle of Big Bethel, and on his recovery
was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant "
Colonel, and soon afterwards Colonel of the ''
Second New York Cavalry. During Stone- t1
man's famous raid to the rear of Lee's army D
Kilpatrick com,.anded a brigade of cavalry,
and for his efficient service on that occasion U
was made a Brigadrer General of volunteers. N
At the battle of Gettysburg he commanded 01
a division of cavalry. He accompauied Gen.
Sherman in his famous march to the sea, It
commanding the cavalry wing of the army,
for which service he was promoted to the i
rankof Major General of volunteers. He t
resigned his commission at the close of the
war in 185, and was immediately appointed 14

of wealth, a native ofthat country. After
his return to this count y be engaged active- C
lyin politics, warmly malnlsining the Rle
e publican cause, and was a very effective
stuMp speaker. He made his residence in
New Jersey, and in 1S80 contested the fourth
district of that State for Congress, but was
defeated by Mr. Hai .is, the Democratic can
didate. President Garfield then appointed
him Minister to Chile for the second time,
and he was engaged in the duties of this po
Sstion up to the .ime of his death. He was
recently brought into prominence in connec
t oon with the complications caused by the
diverse positions taken by himself and Gen.
d Ilurlburt, Minister to Peru, regarding the di

U potier interviewed a prominent Irish agita
ie tor, who said about McNamala, who is
iy wanted in Montreal in connection with the
recent attempt to blow up public buildings:
is "I saw him no later than to-day. He re
e turned from Canada night before last, and is
re at this moment only a few bloks away. He
t is a determined fellow,brave as a lion and as
true as steel. Six months ago lie shot a land
I's lord in Ireland, and came to this coiut,,y.
e In Ireland he was a gentleman, and kept a
lie pack of hounds, but he was in full sympa
its thy with the poor peasantry. The intention
- was to blow up the Court House in Montre
ar- al. the House of Parliament in Ottawa and
to the Arsenal in Quebec, and this will yet be

CMuICao, December 4.-The Tlmes erltl- lat
clss the President's message as being mere rem
like an address from the throne than any Pr
do.cument of the kind since Washington's
time, but commends it for its non-patisan gas
features. Ch
The T,.ibtme finds the message objections- g,(
ble chiefly for its recommendat ions on the
silver question and for its unusual length. lie
The a1,1'. O'ceoI regards it as a dignified, Lc
worthy document, a vigorous and straight- p
forward message, one of the best given to mi
the country for ffteen years. All the jour- re
nals notice its great length.
Nzw Yos, December 7.-The Journals it
are crowded to-day with the President's mes- t]
sage, and the documents incident to the
opmning of the new Congress. The message m
it -ilf is universally well spoken of, patticu
lat y by Republican and independent sheets.
The World says: The message in a word i
is full of views, and the views are not pie
tended to be the views of the counltry or ra
even of the party, but only t hepersonal opin- et
ions of the author of the message, which are ei
to be taken as going for what they are worth. P'
No carerul reader of the message can faIl to at
note this peculiarlty, and few reflective read- a
es will be ata loss to assign it to its I,ue 01
ca tee. Isis the same cause wlhich made the
letter of acceptance of the Republican cart- I
didate for Vice-President last year so mtlh d
more outspoken and positive than the letter a
of the Republican candidate for President. S
The World concludes: In legard to the e
finances and io our forel.n iela;tons, il b
I Pesident sneaks with a force and .ilea. llts
which will cotmmand the trespect of patliotic iI
men of all parties.
ToRnoTo, December 7.-To-day's Globe

T.RhIBLE THEATER FIFE.
s The Ring Theater. Vienna. Eurned and Hun
dreds ot Lives Lost.
The Ri;g Tbearer, Vienna, was built In
I",Ti, and known for a time as Ot O '
handsomest theaters In Europe. and seated
2,000 people. It was there Pat Li and Bern
bardt appeared when in Vienna. It faced
on the Scholten Ring, the most brilliant part
of the city, and near the public square,s.
December 8th, the occasion.of the feast of
the Immarulaie Conception, was selected
for the second production at the Ring
Theater of the last work Offenbach wrote
a comic opera entitled, Lee Conte D'Hlof
Sman. The performance was to begin at 7
p m. At ten minutes before that hour,
while some of the aciors were already on the
stare and the house was fai,ly filled, a the
broke out on the stage, whether from an
eI lectric light or an alcohol lamp is unknown.
The workmen who should have loweled the
iron screen dividing the stage from the au
ditorum fled, and the stage curtain was
raised, dlaclosing to the audience the raging
tire on the stage. A terrible panic at once
began. Owing to the rush but few were
saved by the ordinary etia, the most of
those escaping do'ng so by Jumping fom the
third-story windows into cloths held in the
street below. Many were Injured in this
way, and many were trampled in trying to
escape by the dooes. In a short time the
theater was gutted, and only the gaunt walls
stood as a monument over the 600 or 000
blackened dead within. It is even feared
the deaths will reach 800. The Vienna
papers publish long and heartrending ae
counts of the great horror-the greatest that
has occurred in Vienna.
