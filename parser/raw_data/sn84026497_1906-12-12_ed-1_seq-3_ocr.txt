The President' measagedoes not men
tion Heamt and Bryan by name, but the
demagogue politics he denounces is easily
identified with tlioxe partners.
Possibly the woman who wrote the
book thought that marriagaon probation
would be an improvement over the pres
ent plan of marriage on suspicion.
Among the UOOO Americans on the Isth
mus not a death occurred during the past
three months. The sanitation enforced
by the United States In tropical regions
under its control is a marked success,
"It Is not wise," says the President iu
the message, "that the nation should
alienate its remaining coal lands." The
trusts so eager to complete their monopo
ly bare struck a snag in this uew form of
government res-ervatiou.
Wildcat mining stock Is being sold to
the easy marks. About once in live
years a new harvest of this kind is reaped
by various kinds of confidence men, and
the Fianklin News baa figured' out that
this is the appointed year.
No kw of the unprecedented prosperi
ty Is seen by the President unless there
is "reckless speculation and disregard of
legitimate business methods on the part
of the business world." In a word, busi
ness will be good if business men, along
with their energy and enterprise, are
upright and prudent.
The Legislature at the coming session
will be asked to pass a law forbidding
any unnaturalized resident of Pennsyl
vania to possess a gun or other firearms.
The bill is being prepared by Joseph
Ealbfus, secretary of the State Game
Commission. During the bunting season
which closed last Friday four game war
dens were murdered in this state, seven
were shot and the killing of two was at
tempted by foreigners.
Congressman Smith, of Punxsutaw
ney, who did not ask to be re-elected,
says Uncle Joe Cannon will easily be re
elected to the Speakership of the Sixtieth
Congress. He is an excellent presiding
officer, and besides be has a lot of good
committee places to give out. The old
members who were re-elected, and most
of them were, are already getting matters
fixed for themselves, so that when the
new Congress meets the new members
will be entirely welcome to what there is
left.
AtrratyIsId process of negotiation
between tbe United States and Japan
which it is thought will be acceptable
both to tbe Japanese authorities and to
the people of SanFrancisco. It is)believed
by many that tbe strongly conciliatory
language used by the President toward
Japan and the scolding he gave San
Francisco was part of his scheme of di
plomacy to get tbe matter adjusted with
out a serious rupture. Japan's represen
tatives appear to take a rational view of
tbe situation and manifest a willingness
to do anything within reason to facilitate
tbe conclusion of a treaty thai will relieve
the stress on both sides. Punxsutawney
Spirit.
Referring to the project to provide
for the publication of tbe laws of the
Commonwealth, tbe Norristown Herald
illustrates its points by citing the act ot
April 20, 1005, which makes it unlawful to
throw waste paper, sweepings, ashes,
household waste, nails or rubbish of any
kind Into any city, borough or township
street, and Inquires: "How many pepole
of Norristown actually know that if they
throw a piece of paper upon the streets of
the borough they are breaking a statute
and are making themselves liable to ar
rest aud perchance imprisonment thereby?
How many fishermen or hunters are
fully aware ol all the restrictions which
tbe law has imposed? It hazards the
opinion that "tbe game and fish wardens
wonld have much less revenue if honest
citizens were kept posted by a general
publication of laws."
It mast be conceded by every philo
sophic and unprejudiced observer that
nothing that President Roosevelt can do
will serve to abate or lessen bis dignity
in the eyes of the people, says the New
York Sun, It Is the most inscrutable
and wonderful of his many gifts. Before
it tbe power and the right of impeach
ment have become au obsolute tradition.
He can no more make himself ridiculous
than tbe Senate cau resuscitate the pas
sions with which it assailed Audrew
Johnson, Not since the great figure that
held the whole stage ot Europe a huu
dred years ago has there been another in
history so magically endowed. There is
no mystery iu all humanity like the mys
tery of genius. Therefore, all criticism
is lutile, and only acquiescence is the
safer and wiser part. It Is unprofitable,
if not indeed abect folly, to urge that
while the President cannot make himself
ridiculous it is possible that he should
make the country ridiculous. It is the
same Providence tbat watches over both.

HANDEL'S OBSTINACY.
An Incident of t!io Grcnt Mnslrlnn'a
!illc'.!:c.oil llnrs.
A child's obstinacy dors not always
bring us fortunate results uu vnis the
case with Handel, the great musician.
His extraordinary resoluteness us a
boy doubtless led to that great success
whl' ill crjwned the later years of his
life. When lie was some seven years
of ago his f.iUier had occasion to visit
a son by u former w ife, who was valet
to the Duke of Sa.e Welssenfels.
Traveling in those days 200 years ago
was tedious and expensive, nnd Dr.
Handel did not desire to lie delayed
with the care of an "Infant" during a
Journey which the demands of a re
sponsible professioa would probably
make as short us possible.
Hut the future giant of music would
go. He tried, bellowed and eventually
ran along the road after the vehicle,
until the tender feelings of the doctor
could refuse no longer. In nn evil mo
ment for his jurisprudence scheme he
took the chilli with him.
Xo sooner did the little fellow reach
the ducal residence than he gave rein
to his fancy on the keys of every In
strument tbat he found open. The re
markable music that came from the
fliiRer tlp.i of the fluid's hands was
soon the object of wonder and conver
sation throughout the palace, nnd nil
this was intensified when he secured
an opportunity of touching the keys of
the chancel organ within the hearing
of the duke.
Such a throb etnrted from that chnp
el organ when little Handel's tendriled
fingers chose the keys, und the soul of
the duke was touched as it never had
been touched before truly a momen
tous occurrence, since but for It Han
del's sacred music might never have
been written.
The duke's attention having been ar
rested, lie Inquired of Dr. Handel con
cerning the child's) fntur and eventu
ally succeeded In placing him for three
years' study xmO.cv Zachau, the organ
ist of Halle cathedral. This was the be
ginning of Hmdei's musical education.
The Poison of Wealth.
Great riches, carrying with them
enormous possibilities of self Indul
gence, may fairly be' considered as a
sort of poison which ruins a certain
proportion of those who are exposed
to it, though strong constitutions sur
vive. As rum destroys savages, so
wealth lends tl destroy persons espe
cially young ones, whom use and train
ing have not gradually made Immune
to -Its effects. How that Is may readily
be noticed iii observing the effects of
newly won wealth on the families of
the winners. It is n rare man and usu
ally one very much blessed In his wife,
who can combine with the ability that
wins him riches the sagacity to train
children bom In comparative poverty
so that they will benefit by a rapid und
radical Improvement In his circum
stances. Edward S. Martin in Atlan
tic. Man, the Monstrons Specter.
What u monstrous specter Is this
man, the disease of the ngglutlnated
dust, lifting alternate feet or lying
drugged with slumber: killing, feeding,
growing, bringing forth small copies of
himself; grown upon witli hair like
grass, fitted with eyes that move and
glitter In Ills face; a thing to set chil
dren screaming, and yet looked at
nearer, known as his fellows know
him, how surprising are his attributes!

Damp is the greatest evil to which

the kennel should always be placed

WHEN VACCINATION
FAILS TO TAKE
Health Commissioner Dixon Ex
plains Provision That Is Made Io
Such Cases So That Children May
Not Be Debarred From School
WHEN CLAIM IS MADE
THAT "CHILD 13 UNFIT
In Exceptional Cases, Where Careful
Investigation By Local or State
Health Authorities Justifies Admit'
tion to School, It It Authorized.
"After three carefully performed but
unsuccessful attempts to vaccinate
child have failed, that child thould not
be debarred from achool privileges, but
should be admitted, and the Depart
ment of Health has provided for this,'
snid State Health Commissioner Sam'
uel G Dixon In an Interview.
"The Supreme Court ot Pennsylva
nla." continued Dr. Dixon, "called at
ter.tlon in the recent opinion It banded
down reaffirming the validity ot tbe so.
railed vaccination law of June 18, 1895,
to the hardship Involved In the twelfth
section of that act when it Is beyond
the power of children of school age to
be vaccinated, although they may not
previously have had smallpox nor pre
viously been vaccinated, and even re
peated attempts to perform the oper
ation upon such children are without
effect and vaccination will not taks.
In such cases, as the court pointed
out. the physician cannot certify that
such child has been successfully vac
cinated so as to meet the requirement
of admission to school. The court's de
cision suggested the possibility of ths
health authorities, state or local, mak
ing a regulation setting forth the con
ditlons under which a child upon whom
vaccination will not take, may be per-
mitted to go to school. The court also
suggests that the health authorities
would have to consider whether such
a regulation would be undesirable as
affording opportunity for the evasion
ot the statute.
"The Department of Health," con
tinued Health Commissioner Dixon,
"has taken this tendency to evade the
law Into consideration, as It was
obliged to, and yet we have endoav
ored to see that those children who
could not be vaccinated should be ad
mitted to school. Our method of ac
complishing this from the first hat
been as follows:
When the cases that we received
Inquiry about were within the limits
of a borough or city having a Board of
Health of its own, we suggested that
after two unsuccessful attempts to vac
cinate a. child, the third attempt be
made by or in the presence of the
physician of the Board of Health. If
this attempt failed, then the physician
of the board, acting in his official ca
pacity, should authorize the admission
of the child.
"In the rural districts, where there
are no Boards of Health to pass upon
such cases, I have always asked that
after three unsuccessful attempts to
vaccinate a child have been made, the
name of the child and the physician
who made the attempts be referred Im
mediately to the State Department of
Health. The cases have then been at
once Investigated by our County Medi
cal Inspectors or some one deputized
by them, so that the child might not
unjustly be debarred from school prlvl
leges. These methods of dealing with
the situation have been In conformity
with the Supreme Court's suggestion
that the health authorities assume the
responsibility of authorizing the ad
mission to school of children upon
whom, after a reasonable number of
attempts, vaccination does not take.
Taking advantage of the spirit of
this part of the Supreme Court'a opin
ion, we have also endeavored to deal
with the cases of children where there
was reason to believe that the child's
physical condition did not make vac
cination at the present time advisable.
The Attorney General of the State had
given an opinion that a teacher was
not authorized to accept a certificate
from a physician stating that the child
was not In a physical condition to be
vaccinated. It is reasonable to be
lieve, however, that although the sim
ple giving of such a certificate by the
family physician would not be suffi
cient, the spirit of the Supreme Court's
opinion would permit the recognized
health authorities throuehout the
state, after careful Investigation, to
pass upon such cases.
'Therefore when such cases are now
brought to the attention of our depart
ment, we have suggested that inside
borough or city limits, the local Board
of Health, through Its physician, de
cide whether the child Is well enough
to attend school and yet not In a fit
condition to be vaccinated. In the dis
tricts where there are no Boards of
Health we are having Buch cases In
vestigated and passed upon by our
regular County Medical Inspectors.
It will thus be seen," concluded Dr.
Dixon, "that the State Department of
Health Is doing everything possible to
prevent any child from being unjustly
deprived of its schooling. If the par
ent or guardian, however, refuses to
permit a child to be vaccinated simply
through preludlce. the health authori
ties certainly have no power to Inter
fere with the operation of the law. In
such cases we have done everything
we could to overcome this prejudice
by education, so that the Innocent
child mlRht not be made to suffer be
cause the parent desired to leave It
exposed to the ravages of smallpox
rather than undergo vaccination, which
the Legislature of Pennsylvania, In the
exercise of Its police power, has made
one of the requisites of admission to
school."
