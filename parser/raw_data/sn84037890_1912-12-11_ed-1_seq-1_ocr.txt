TWO FIRES IN HARTFORD
W0HDAY LITTLE OMGE
Music Store and Residence and
Another Home Had Very
Narrow Escapes.
Two Urea In Hartford Monday
created considerable excitement,
but little damage waa done.
The first blaze was In the Collins
property, on Mulberry street, near
the river, now occupied by Mr. Bert
Wlngatt and family. Mr. Wingati
ia ono of the drillers for the West
Kentucky Oil Co. A lot of soot
caught fire In the kitchen flue and
fell down Into the stove, melting
the stovepipe off and blazing out
Into tho room. The stove even to
the legai also became red hot. Mrs.
Wlngatt fought the blaze out with
a broom, all the time screaming for
help. Neighbors heard the cry and
telephoned up town. Our ever rea-'
dy lire fighters responded promptly, I
but when they arrived on the scene
they found their services were not
needed only to finish the good work
of Mrs. Wlngatt.
The other fire was of a more se
rious nature, although no mora
damage was done, because It threat-'
oned a large portion of the business J
section of town. It occurred in the
store of the Hartford Music Co., '
across the street from the court '
house, north side of tho public '
square. Mr. M. F. Faught, the
manager, occupies the upper floor
over the storo as a residence for '
himself and family.
The origin of the fire is not
known and Is rather a mystery.
Mrs. Faught was up stalra with her
children when she smelted smoke.
Descending Immediately to the
apartment below, which was sepa
rated from the main floor where
the pianos are kept by a curtain,
she discovered the room black with ;
smoke antl tlle curtain ablaze. She
screamed an alarm and wag so bad
ly frightened that she at once- faint
ed. People came running in and
carried her and the children out
and began fighting the tire. The
blaze wag soon put out with Are ex-'
tinguishers and did little- damage.
Mrs. Faught was revived in Dr. Ri
ley's office near by. The fire orig
inated in the rear of the room at
the end of an empty piano box
which wag used as a clothes bin.
The end of the box was considera
bly charred. Mr. Faught is at a
loss to account for the lire unless
some thoughtless visitor tossed a ,
lighted cigar stub where it may
have caught in the folds of the cur-!
tain.
It was i narrow cscape ns the
music Etore is situated almost in
the center of old two-story frame
buildings which if once caught
thoroughly afie, could not be put
out with any tire extinguishing ,
means we have In Hartford. If ,
that row of buildings should burn, ,
it would quite likely Include tho i
Christian church, Mrs. Maggie Grif
fin's residence, the opera house and '
Dr. Riloy's office and perhaps other
buildings near by
Hartford's fire fighters nre
famoiiB for th0 promptness and ef
ficiency of their work, but we
should have some water plugs, hose
and other apparatus to aid their ef
forts. Everybody should be care
ful about fire these days.

TI.C.
Ohio County Operators File
Charges With the Inter
state Commission.
Washington, Dec. 7. The Wll
llarns Coal Company and the Taylor
Coal Company, of Kentucky, both
of McHenry, Ohio county, Ky., filed
am expected complaint against the
Illinois, Central railroad with the
Interstate Commerce Commission
to-day, charging, In line with the
expose by the Courier-Journal and
Times, that an injustice has been
done tho McHenry mining section
by the railroad In falling to supply
cars to move the output of the
mines.
The Interstate Commerce Com
mission Is asked to Issue an order
commanding the Illinois Central to
furnish cars to the McHenry mines
on Its line sufficient in number to
handle the full capacity of the
mines.
Little Complaint in Oilier .Sections.
Barbourville. Ky. Dec. 7. While
there is somc complaint of a
shortage of cars In some of the min
ing districts of Southeastern Ken
tucky, the facilities for shipping arc
much better, it Is said, than have
prevailed during some previous
winter seasons. There has been a
great Increase in the tonnage from
Southeastern Kentucky lines, due
to the opening of new districts, but
few mines have been handicapped
by a lack of cars for shipping their
output.
Tho new Harlan county field Is
now contributing a u'f? tonnage
from several plants installed during
the past two years, while many new
mines have been opened along the
main Louisville and Nashville ex
tension through this section.
Local operators statethat this is
one of the most prosperous seasons
for years ' past. There is a heavy
demand for both steam and domes
tic coal, at Increased prices over
last year's quotations. The Ken
tucky market has greatly expanded
in the North, and much of the ton
nage now goes in that direction.
Stole Present For Baby.

was tho only way I had to get my
baby a Christmas present," sobbed
Ellen Nelson. She stood before
Judge Stully charged with being a

GIVES UP HOPE
OF JE TARIFF
And Its Reduction, Does
President Taft
IN LUST GENERAL MESSAGE
To Congress and Leaves Fur
ther Revision to the In
coming Party.
A SUMMARY OF THE MESSAGE
Washington, Dec. 6. President
Taft will make no further effort to
have Congress reduco the tariff. In
a "general" message to Congress
submitted to-day, the President
clearly Indicated bis intention of
leaving further tariff revision to
Mr. Wilson and the Congress Just

"Now that a new Congress has
been elected on a platform of tariff
for revenue only, rather than 0 Pro
tective tariff, and is to revise tho
tariff on that basis," said the Pres
ident, "It Is needless for me to oc
cupy the time of Congress with ar
guments or itcommendations in fa
vor of a protective tariff."
This message, the second submit
ted by tho President since the pres
ent session began, will be his last
of a general character. It dealt
with every department of the Gov
ernment except thu Statu Depart
ment, recommended much of tho
legislation which Mr. Taft previous
ly had urged upon the attention of
Congress, and took up and discuss
ed at length several subjects com
paratively new.
Mr. Taft came out strongly
against Independence for the Phil
ippines proposed, he said, in a bill
now befoie Congress. He depre
cated the new policy of one battle
ship a year Instead of two; and In
dorsed ngaln the scheme of curren
cy reform proposed by the Nation
al Monetary Commission.
President Taff9 principal recom
mendations in his message to Con
gres to-day are:
The plan of currency reform out
lined by the Monetary Commission.
Amendment of the law to les
sen the penalty when corporations
Inadvertently disobey the corpora
tion tax law.
Congressional approval of plan of
army reorganization prepared by
the War College last spring.
The passage of the militia pay
bill increasing compensation to mi
litia in the Held.
Citizenship, without Statehood,
for Porto Rico.
Regulation of water power
grants, so that navigable streams
might be Improved by water power
companies.
Elevation of Col. Goethnls, build
er of tho Panama Canal, to a Ma
jor generalship.
A return to the policy of two bat
tleships a year by the appropriation
for three battleships this year.
Authority to the United States
Supreme Court to make rules of
procedure in common law cases In
Federal Courts to expedite and les
sen the cobt of litigation.
Hc disapproved the following:
Autonomy and independence in
eight years for the Philippines.
Amendment of the Sherman anti
trust law.
The President made no recom
mendations for tariff revision, stat
ing that he would leave that subject
to the incoming Congress.

which would ultimately cause her
