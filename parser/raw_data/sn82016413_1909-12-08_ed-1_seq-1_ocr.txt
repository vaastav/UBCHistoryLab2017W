WASHINOT0N, Dec. 8. Senator
Borah of Idaho today introduced the
bill that carries out the plan of the
great Irrigation Congress to develop,
the waste lands of the west. The
bill calls for an appropriation of,
thirty millions of dollars for irriga-'

SUBSIDY
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. The
campaign for ship subsidy was given
a new impetus by the utterances of
President Taft in his message to
Congress. The President urges upon
Congress in the strongest terms the
passage of a ship subsidy bill at this
session so that the merchant marine
of the United States shall carry the
commerce of the country and furnish
a support for the navy in time of
war.
The message in dealing with the
sugar frauds that have been recent
ly brought to light deprecates the
plan for a Congressional investiga
tion. The President says that the
perpetrators of the frauds will be
vigorously prosecuted and Congres
sional intervention is inadvisable,
