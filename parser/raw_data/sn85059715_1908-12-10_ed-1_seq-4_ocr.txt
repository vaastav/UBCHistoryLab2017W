An K veiling Echo.
Liberty is a principle; Its community

sKi Us doom.?Kossuth.
A Valuable Resource.
The West Fork river Is a small
stream. Elk creek is a smaller
stream. The tributaries of .these two
are still smaller. But their smal!5l"
ness ought not to mean necessarlly
that thiy can not lie made to be
means of usefulness. Indeed, they
are valuable or would prove themselves
so. if human effort but supplemented
what-*nature bas given in
such a bounteous way.
One may not hope to have navigable
streams from Clarksburg,
though that may eventually come,
but watel- is an invaluable asget and
can be used to advantage in many
ways, one of which is domestic use.
If .properly availed, and another is
motive power, but neither eclipses Its
use as a Are fighter.
It is feared that even Clarksburg,
after going through such a prolonged
drouth and suffering all the Inconveniences
and the risks It brought is
not aroused to the extent of eliminating
opposition to betetr water facilities.
the averred lethargy being the
result more of prejudice than lack
of appreciation of the public need.
Be that as It may, It is hard, even
painful, to conceive that some petty
jealousy -may influence men to vote
against measures that tend to the
public good and to guarantee to
them better conditions than prevail.
The water question is not local by
any means. It interests the nation.
In truth, it is a basic principle upon
which the life of the nation itseif
4 depends largely, though there has
been neglect and Indifference thus
far. The ifuture of " Clarksburg
greatly depends on the solution of
?the water question and it can no
longer be said that Clarksburg can
get along and grow without adequate
water supply. In this respect
nature, perhaps, has not been as kind
to this city as has been ?he case at
other points, but nature has done
amply enough to avoid our distress,
provided the people themselves
would do tlieir part. ?
While only the most hopeful may J
entertain the idea that our city will s
be able some time to avail itself of i
navigation, yet from other view- t
points water as a natural resource is c
certainly one of the most precious, t
and at this particular time it is not i
amiss# to quote such a splendid and
honest authority as the President of t
the United States, who but yesterday z
in closing an address to the National c
Conservation Commission, said: c
"Our natural resources are so re- s
jaiI'd mac ilit* use ui uut* auecis iuu r
use of all the others. This is es- a
pecially true of our waterways. Ev- t
ery man. woman vnd child within h
our borders has an interest in them, ^
through navigation, power, Irrlga- t
Hon, or water supply* or through all
four. We have neglected our water- t
ways more than any other natural j
resource and we must put an end to l
that neglect. The Inland Waterways j
Commission has told us how. a
"First, let us prepare a compre- ?
henslve plan for inland waterway de- f
velopment along the lines pointed i
out. by the commission. Such a plan a
must consider every use of the wat- c
ers, it must put the interests of all a
the people In advance of any private
interests whatever. The preparation
of this comprehensive plan should be- ?l
gin at once. 1
"Second, let us proceed immed- t
lately with the construction of the t
waterways for which plans have al- i
^ready been approved, and which we \
are now certain will fit into the out- a
MtmmI of -the -general plan. Our n
previous policy of procrastination, r
delay, and fitful and partial action,
has borne its perfect fruit. Our
waterways are deserted and in return a
for our vast expenditures we have/ h
little or no actual navigation to show, t
The people are ready for a change. C
Let us hive it, and at once. If we i:
can pay the co3t ifrom current rev- a
cnues let us to do. If not let us is- c
4' **er
PaJa on ah
- -
sp&bcmd*,-]?- By either method, let as.
iicre the" waterways and that qnWlily.
The plan and the work can and
skontd proceed together. While the
wotk we .are sure of la' being begun,
the plan.Tor the rest can be prepared.]
" - "The work -therefore should begin
at once. 3ut there toust not be the
lightest recklessness or. \vastQ, of
mojjey. Xo work whaterer Should1
be undertaken that has not been
thoroughly examined and fully approved
by competent experts. Above
alt. not one cent should "be expended
to satisfy special Interests, whether
of a business or a, locality, or promote
any man's political fortunes.
This Is too large n matter to be
handled in snch a way. We must
approach it from the point of view
or the National interest, tinder the
gnidance of the wisest experts in engineering,
in transportation, and in
ail the uses of our streams.. Forests
and waterways cannot be separated
in any successful treatment of either.
Forest protection and river development
must go hand in hand. The
three things which should be done
without any further delay are therefore:
First, to provide for a comprehensive
plan of waterway development.
Second, to begin at once on
work already planned that will surely
lit Into the larger plan. Third,
to provide amply for forest protection
against fire, against reckless
cutting, against wanton or reckless
destruction of all kinds, and to secure
the Appalachian and White
Mountain National Forests without
delay." r
A Sensible View.
Grafton Is becoming alarmed over
Its city water supply, and the Sentinel,
of that city, takes a sensible
and public spirited view of the situation.
That paper rightly believes
that political party prejudices should
be laid aside in considering the general
welfare of the community, a viewin
which the Dally Telegram coincides
and hopes the people of Clarksburg
will do likewise when considering
the water works Improvement
luestlon In this city. Says the Sentinel:
Neither the city water works proolem
nor our water supply Is a politi:al
question. Nor should it he so
considered. But both are very Imbortaift
questions, nevertheless.
Roth are subjects that call for the
nost careful consideration and proliems
that need to have brought to
their consideration the best business
tense that can be commanded. If
he statements coming from official
sources are true, this town is threatened
to ,be without a water supply at
iny day. The very thought of such
i possibility is enough to arouse the
greatest anxiety on the part of our
dtizens. "What would be the health
>r sanitary condition of this town
with her water supply cut off for
even a **eek? A day would be bad
enough. * * *
But whatever is done should be
lone at once and save the town from
either of the threatened calamities
hat have been mentioned^- The sitlatlon
calls for the exercise of the
?est of business judgment and good
sense to say the least.
Rlecting Senators.
The Clarksburg Telegram seems
if raid to let the people l^ve a hand
n saying who shall* l>e our United
States Senators. The Telegram must
want some senators whom it fears
he people wouldn't select. It
mghtn't to advocate the selection of
hat kind of people.? Fairmont West
Virginian.
The Telegram merely called at-,
enflon to a few important consideritions
in relation to the proposed
changing of the spirit of the federal
institution. And among these considerations
was the objection that direct
election of United States senitors
removes the representatives oP

ei 1 candidates and the political bosses
vho might control elections by conr
rolling the nominations.
The Telegram does not advocate
he selection of senators who are renignant
to the wishes of the people,
>ut neither does this paper believe It
list the proper thing to sweep away !
ill the checks and balances provided,
ind Intended to be provided, by the
ramers of the constitution. If the !
jeople are not satisfied with any sen- '
itor, there are ample means under :
