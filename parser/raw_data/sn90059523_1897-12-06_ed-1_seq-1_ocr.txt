islation.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.— The regular,
or long session of congress, as it is call
ed, because there is no constitutional
limitation upon the period of its dura
tion, opens at noon tomorrow. The
leaders and a large majority of the
members of both houses are here to
participate in the opening ceremonies,
and President McKinley has made the
journey to Washington from the bed
side of his dying mother that his ab
sence might not delay the national leg
islature at its assembling. The extra
sessions robs the opening of the reg
ular session of the excitement and in
terest which usually attach to it. On
the eve of a regular session ordinarily
Washington thrills with excitement.
The hotel lobbies surge with place
hunters in the wake of the various
candidates for speaker, clerk, door
keeper, etc.; the members are strug
gling for committee assignments, and
the- air is full of rumors of plots and
counterplots. But, as the house was
completely organized at the extra ses
sion, and all the committee assign
ments were made then, beyond the
natural stimulus produced by the re
turning statesmen, the regular hang
ers-on of legislation and the outlining
of schemes by members of the "third
house," or lobby, Washington tonight
is tranquil. The programme in the
house tomorrow is very simple, and be
yond the spectacular show which it of
fers to the curious has, in itself, little
attraction. The house will be called to
order by the speaker, who, after the
chaplain's invocation, will direct the
clerk to call the roll. This having been
accomplished and the presence of a
quorum demonstrated, the clerk will be
directed to notify the senate that the ;
house is ready for business, and a com
mittee will be appointed to wait on the
president. After that, there will be a
recess to await the arrival of the presi
dent's annual message, which will be
read upon its reception and be followed
by an adjournment until Tuesday. This
is the regular routine, and unless some
thing unforeseen occurs will not be de
parted from.
It is the intention of the house lead
ers to proceed with the business of the
session as rapidly as possible. The
committees will all begin their labors
this week, and, as all of them have
more or less bills on hand which were
introduced at the extra session, there
will be r.r> lack of material for the
hcuse to work on after the committees
have begun to grind. The appropria
tions committee has been at work for
ten days, and Chairman Cannon ex
pects to pass at least two of the reg
ular budgets before the holidays — the
legislative, executive and judicial and
the pensions appropriation hills. One
or the other of these bills, it is ex
pected, will be reported by Wednesday,
and the end of the week promises to
see the house down to business. Among
[ the early general measures to receive
consideration will be the
BANKRUPTCY BILL.
Whether it will be the Nelson bill
which passed the senate at the last
session or a modification of the Torrey
bill depends on the temper of the ju- <
diciary committee, which will submit '
the measure to the house. Beyond j
doubt there will be several resolutions
of inquiry during the first week which
may be more or less sensational, and
some of the radical pro-Cuba members
will attempt to get consideration for
a Cuban resolution before the foreign
affairs committee can act. Congress
man Livingston, of Georgia, is one of
these. But, owing to the nature of the ■
house rules, all these hasty efforts will i
prove abortive, and they probably will
take their regular course.
There will be nothing except indis- !
position on the part of members to
prevent the senate's entering upon its
work upon convening tomorrow, as
there is a calendar already made for it
with about 300 bills reported from com
mittees during the special session. If
any circumstances should prevent the
receipt of the president's message on
Monday, the probabilities are that the
senate would adjourn over without
taking up any other business until the
message could be received.
With the message read, it will remain
for the senate to decide whether it
shall enter seriously upon the work
of the session after Monday or begin
a system of delay intended to throw
all important questions over beyond
the Christmas holidays. The indica
tions are now for a little more activity
than usual during the pre-holiday ses
sion. This is largely due to the fact
that the supporters of the administra
tion and advocates of annexation are
very anxious to secure the earliest pos
sible consideration of the treaty with
Hawaii. Senator Davis, chairman of
the committee on foreign relations, an
nounced his purpose of pressing an
nexation at the earliest possible mo
ment, but it is probable that the mat
ter will not be taken up seriously until
the committee can have a meeting and
decide upon details of procedure. The
committee will be called together on
Wednesday for htis purpose. One point
which the committee will be called
upon to decide is whether to proceed
to ratify the treaty of annexation or
to annex the islands by resolution. The
annexationists have lost some votes
during the vacation, and there is now
apprehension that the two-thirds vote
necessary to secure the ratification
cannot be secured. No satisfactory
canvass is possible until all the sena
tors arrive, and, if it is then made
manifest that the necessary two-thirds
MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1897.
vote cannot be secured, it is likely that
the proceeding by means of resolution,
which would require only a majority
vote, will be inaugurated. Some mem
bers of the foreign relations commit
tee who favor annexation advocate
this course, because they say they see
no reason for traversing the same
ground twice, as they would be com
pelled to do in case the matter should
be first considered in executive ses
sion, fail there, and then be taken up
in the form of a resolution in open
senate and house.
The immigration bill, for which Sen
ator Lodge stands sponsor, is practi
cally at the head of the senate legis
lative calendar, and will be considered
early in the session. Senator Lodge
today repeated his intention of press
ing the bill, but he will not antagonize
the Hawaiian treaty with it. The first
bill on the calendar is Senator Gear's
measure providing for the adjustment
of the Pacific railroad debt, but the
sale of the Union Pacific doubtless will
have the effect of causing the tempo
rary withdrawal of this bill and the
substitution of others. Of the 300 bills
on the calendar, about 200 are private
pension bills, and all of these probably
will be disposed of at one sitting when
taken up. There are also several hun
dred recess appointments to bo consid
ered in executive session.
It is not probable that much will be
done In the way of legislation during
the present week. There will be .in ad
journment for the day after receiving
the message oh Monday, and as there
is no disposition to press the Hawaiian
matter until the foreign relations com
mittee agrees upon a line of action
the indications now are that it will not
be taken up in the senate before next
week.
SHORT SESSION, SAYS CAXXON.
\<> Financial Legislation Expected
by the Banking? Committee.
Special to the Globe.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.— "1 look for
a short session of congress, and the
transaction of considerable business,"
says Congressman Cannon, of Illinois,
chairman of the committee on appro
priations. "I believe that congress will
adjourn not later than the first day
of next June, and it is possible that we
may get away from Washington by the
middle cf May."
"Will there be no national legisla-"
tion?"
"Of course there .will be. and some
international legislation, too. In the
first place, Hawaii will be annexed.
You see in these later days the house
of representatives does not spend all
of its time in monkey business. Tom
Reed has brought parliamentary prac
tice down to a fine point. It is now
conceded that the majority rule. The
minority cannot spend time filibustering
and doing all sorts of foolish things
to thwart the will of the people. That
being the case, and the determination
having been reached that Hawaii shall
be annexed, it will be done."
"How about other legislation?"
"Well, the committee on appropria
tions will have all of the regular bills
ready for action early in March, or
sooner. In fact. I hope that some of
the bills will be passed in January and
February, and all of them will bp re
ported to thp house without delay."
"What will haj>pen in the mean
time?"
"The congressmen interested in war
claims, private claims, private pen
sion bills, and all sorts of odds and
ends will have an opportunity to press
their measures for consideration. Ev
ery day will be busy. Out of our 356
members of the house of representa
tives, not less than 300 men will be
urging and begging consideration of
their measurps. They will all be .'ifter
the speaker for recognition, and I wiil
be one of them. The congressmen who
have public building bills on hand will
, also be clamoring- for a chance. Every
day will be day time, and there will
be no night during the session."
Congressman Joseph H. Walker, of
Massachusetts, chairman of the com
mittee on banking and currency, says:
"There will be no financial legislation.
It has been determined by tho author
and finisher of our careers in the house
of representatives that the house of
representatives shall not be organized
'to do business,' as Tom Reed used to
put it. On the contrary, the man who
once stood before the people as the
biggest man in legislative life is now
showing us how not to do business.
Your friend Cannon is right when he
says that we will do practically noth
ing but pass the approDriation bills.
He Is also right about Hawaiian an
nexation. That will probably occur
before the Christmas holidays."
"But Mr. Cannon said there would be
other business."
"Yes, he says so. but he knows that
nothing but the bankruptcy bill will
have right of way. All cf the little bills
\\;hich congressmen may urge will
not amount to shucks. The house will
meet from day to day. and adjourn
without accomplishing much. It is a
decree, like the laws of the Medes and
Persians, that the congress shall not do
business."
"Will there be a caucus of Republi
cans in the house of representatives?"
"It is quite likely that there will be.
There is no necessity for a caucus.
The same power which controls the
house would control the caucus. Nev
ertheless, it might be good policy and
good politics to have a caucus, in or
der to shift the responsibility onto the
entire party. That is a very old po
litical trick. When a man has the pow
er to control affairs, and does so. peo
ple call him a boss. If he has a cau
cus which authorizes him to do his
will, then he cannot be called a boss,
because he is ostensibly carrying out
the will of his party. Oh, yes, I pre
sume there will be a caucus, and the
caucus will decide that no business
shall be done."

WASHINGTON, Dec. s.— lt was offi
cially announced at the White house
today upon the return of the president
to Washington, that Gov. John Griggs,
of New Jersey, has been tendered and
has accepted the office of attorney
general of the United States, which
will be vacated by the nomination of
Attorney General McKenna to be as
sociate justice of the Udited States
supreme court. It has not yet been
settled when Gov. Griggs Bhall assume
his new office, but it is probable that
the date will be about the beginning
of the new year.
Gov. John W. Griggs, of New Jersey, who
has accepted the tender of the portfolio of at
torney general, to succeed Judge McKenna. is
one of the foremost Republicans in the state
of which he is the chia( executive. Gov.
Griggs is in that period of life which confers
maturity without involving any possible
weakness from old age. He is nearing 50, and
h»s all the ripeness of judgment and expe
rience that comes with that time of life.
He is a native of the state over which he
presides, and his family conßributed many
good soldiers to the array of independence.

Japanese Minister Returns From Tokio
With Emphatic Instructions to Take
a Positive Stand in Defense: of
the Treaty Rights of His
Country in the Islands.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Dec. 5.—
Turu Horsl, envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary from Japan to
the United States, was a passenger
from the Orient on the steamship City
of Pekin. He left tonight for Wash
ington, carrying with him important
instructions in reference to the Ha
waiian treaty of annexation, which
will be considered by the United States
senate.
Several months ago he hurriedly left
Washington for Japan. He left Just
after the publication of his corre
spondence with Secretary Sherman
with reference to the Hawaiian ques
tion. Dispatches from Washington de
clared that he was angry with Sher
man and the administration for their
advocacy of annnexation.
"I know," he said, "that my recent
trip to Japan has been misconstrued
by some of the American newspapers.
I believe my relations with the Wash
ington authorities are amicable. My
relations with Secretary Sherman are
not strained. I desire to say positive
ly that Japan is opposed to the an
nexation of Hawaii by the United
States. The recent reports that
Japan had withdrawn her opposition
are untrue. Japan has certain inter-

BERLIN, -Dec. s.— When the German
reinforcements, consisting of four com
panies of marines, numbering 23 officers
and 1,200 men, and a company of naval
artillery, numbering 200 men, arrive at
Kiao-Chau bay, for which point, as al
ready cabled, they will soon set out,
they will bring the total German force
there up to 4,566 men, the largest body
Germany has ever sent beyond Euro
pean waters. It is understood that the
reserves had to be drawn upon.
The admiralty denies that other Euro
ptan squadrons have entered the har
bor at Kiao-Chau to watch Germany's
proceedings, and it is believed that Ad
miral yon Diederlch would protest vig
orously against such an attempt. The
KolniEche Zeitung regards the expedi
tion 33 having a twofold aim; first, to
obtain missionary reparation; and, sec
ond, to obtain thL» cession of Kiao-Chau
as payment for past services rendered
China by Germany in connection with
the conclusion of peace with Japan.
There is much self-congratulation
the needle point is lifted. It will be
seen that most careful adjustment of
clock-work is necessary for harmonious
working to the instruments.
While the carriage is propelled by the
electric motor, the clock-work is nec
essary to control Its velocity, and
this is accomplished with the assist
ance, in addition to the ordinary-look
ing system of cogs, of a number of
whirling fans not unlike the governor
of a steam engine save that they have
discs instead of spheres.
Three weeks ago yesterday prelim
inary tests were had of the device, and
the pictures herewith reproduced were
then taken. At this time the chief dif
ficulty apparent was the slowness of
the apparatus, it requiring thirty-eight
minutes for the pointer to traverse the
inscribed area.
So Inventor Hummel took his contri
vance back home, and by dint of de
voting his spare time to it, and the
adjustment of some of the purely me
chanical parts of the machine to a

the United States should respect. I
believe this matter will be amicably
adjusted. There may be serious trou
ble if the United States annexes the
islands without regard to our interests
there. But I do not believe the United
States will act unfairly. Japan is very
friendly with this country' and there
is certainly a way by which the an
nexation question can be settled satis
factorily to both great nations. I re
turn with certain instructions from
my government.
"Japan has in the Hawaiian islands
about 20.000 of her people. Hawaii has
a treaty with Japan permitting the
latter to send immigrants there, and
also imports for the use of the latter.
Hawaii has violated this treaty and
our claim for this violation has not
been settled. We want our claim set
tled after annexation, if not before
that time. Hawaii deported some of
our Japanese immigrants. That was
in violation of her treaty with Japan.
Hawaii has also levied a discriminat
ing duty on Japanese mine imports.
That was another violation of the
treaty. Hawaii would certainly act in
the matter of our claim if the United
States would use her good offices."

ary incident absolves the government
from the tedious and perhaps abortive
process of diplomatically claiming a
