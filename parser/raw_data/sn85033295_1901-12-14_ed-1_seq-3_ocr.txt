This story of “The Lost Continent” is
the translation of an ancient manuscript
found in a cave in the Canary islands. It
was written upon a peculiar substance,
each sheet made up of two parts. One side
resembled talc, end over the other side
was spread a coating of dark coffee-col
ored material that resembled wax. A lib
eral translation gives the following story;
CHAPTER I.
MY RECALL.
The public official reception was
over. The sentence had been read,
the name of Phorenice the empress
odored, and the new 7 viceroy installed
with all that vast and ponderous
ceremonial which had gained its
pomp and majesty 7 from the ages.
Formally, I had delivered up the
reins of my government; formally 7 ,
Tatho had seated himself on the
snake-throne, and had put over his
neck the chain of gems which sym
bolized + he supreme office; and then,
while the unims and the trumpets
made their proclamation of clamor,
he had risen to his feet for his first
state progress round that gilded
council chamber, as viceroy of the
Province of Yucatan.
With folded arms and bended head
I followed him between the glitter
ing lines of soldiers, and the brilliant
throng of courtiers, and chiefs, and
statesmen. The roof-beams quivered
to the cries of “Long live Tatho!”
“Flourish the empress!” which came
forth as in duty bound, and the new
ruler acknowledged the welcome with
stately inclinations of the head. In
turn he went to the three lesser
thrones of the lesser governors —in
the east, the north, and the south,
and received homage from each as
the ritual was; and I, the man whom
his coming had deposed, followed
with the prescribed meekness in his
train.
It was a hard task, but we who
hold the higher offices learn to carry
before the people a passionless face.
Once, 20 y-ears before, these same
fine obeisances had been made to me;
now the gods had seen fit to make
fortune change. But as I w 7 alked
bent and humbly 7 on behind the heels
of Tatho, though etiquette forbade
noisy salutations to myself, it could
not inhibit kindly glances, and these
came from every soldier, every 7 cour
tier, and every chief who stood there
in that gilded hall, and they 7 fell upon
me very 7 gratefully. It is not often
that the fallen meet such tender
looks.
Then, one behind the other, the
new viceroy and the old, we marched
with formal step over golden tiles of
that council hall beneath the pyra
mid, and the great officers of state
left their stations and joined in our
train; and at the farther wall we
came to the door of those private
chambers which an hour ago had
been mine own.
Ah, well! I had no home now in
any 7 of those wondrous cities of
Y'ucatan, and I could not help feeling
a bitterness, though in sooth I should
have been thankful enough to return
to the continent of Atlantis with my 7
head still in its proper station.
Tatho gave his formal summons of
“Open ye to the Viceroy,” which the
ritual commands, and the slaves with
in sent the massive stone valves of
the door gaping wide. Tatho entered,
I at his heels; the others halted,
sending valedictions from the thresh
old; and the valves of the door
clanged on the lock behind us. We
passed on to the chamber beyond,
and then, when for the first time we
were alone "together, and the forced
etiquette of courts was behind us,
the new viceroy turned with meekly
folded arms, and bowed low before me.
“Deucalion,” he said, “believe me
that I have not sought this office. It
was thrust upon me. Had I not ac
cepted, my head would have paid for
feit. and another man—your enemy—
would have been sent out as viceroy
In your place. The empress does not
permit that her will shall ever be
questioned.”
“My friend,” I made answer, “my
brother in ail but blood, there is no
man living in all Atlantis or her ter
ritories to whom I had liefer hand
over my government. For 20 years
now have I ruled this country of
Yucatan, and Mexico beyond, first un
der the old king, and then as minis
ter to this new empress. I know my
colony 7 like a book. lam intimate
with all her wonderful cities, with
their palaces, their pyramids, and
their peoples. I have hunted the
beasts and the savages in the for
ests. I have built roads, and made
the rivers so that they 7 win carry
shipping. I have fostered the arts
and crafts like a merchant; I have
discoursed, three times each day, the
cult of the gods with mine own lips.
Through evil years and through good
have I ruled here, striving only 7 for
the prosperity of the land and the
strengthening of Atlantis, and I have
grown to love the peoples like a fa
ther. To you I bequeath them, Tatho,
with tender supplications for their
Interest.”
“It is net I that can carry 7 on
Deucalion’s work with Deucalion’s
power, but rest content, my friend,
that I shall do my humble best to fol
low exactly on in your footsteps.
Believe me, I came out to this gov
ernment with a thousand regrets, but
1 would have died sooner than take
your place had I known how vigor
ously the supplanting would trouble
you.”
“We are alone here,” I said, “away
from the formalities of formal as
semblies, and a man may give vent
to his natural self without fear of
tarnish ng a ceremony 7 . Your com
ing was something of the suddenest.
Till an hour ago, when you demanded
audien :e, I had thought to rule on
longer and even now I do not know
for wl at cause I am deposed.”
“The proclamation said: ‘We re
lieve our well-beloved Deucalion of
his present service, because we have
great need of his powers at home
in our kingdom of Atlantis.’ ”
“A mere formality.”
Tatho looked uneasily 7 round the
hangings of the chamber, and drew
me with him to its center, and low
ered his voice.
“I do not think so,” he whispered.
“I believe she has need of you.
There are troublous times on hand,
and Phorenice wants the ablest men
in the kingdom ready to her tall.”
“You may speak openly,” 1 said,
“and without fear of eavesdroppers.
We are in the heart of the pyramid
here, built in every way by a man’s
length of solid stone. Myself, I over
saw the lay ing of every course. And
besides, here in Yucatan, we have not
the niceties of your old-world di
p omac j, and do not listen, because
we count it shame to do bo.”
Tatho shrugged his shoulders. “I
acted only according to mine educa
tion. At home, a loose tongue makes
a loose head, and there are those
whose trade it is to carry tales. Still,
what I say is this: The throne
shakes, and Phorenice sees the need
of sturdy props. So she has sent this
proclamation.”
. “But why come to me? It is 20
years since I sailed to this colony,
and from that day 7 I have not re*
turned to Atlantis once. 1 know lit
tle of the old country’s politics.
What small parcel of news drifts out
to us across the ocean reads with
slender interest here. Yucatan is
another world, my 7 Tatho, as you in
the course of your government will
learn, with new interests, new peo
ple, new everything. To us here At
lantis is only a figment, a shadow, far
away across the waters. It is for this
new world of Yucatan that I have
striven through all these years.”
“If Deucalion has small time to
spare from his government for brood
ing over his fatherland, Atlantis, at
least, has found leisure to admire
the deeds of her brilliant son. Why,
sir, over yonder at home, your name
carries magic with-it. When you and
I were lads together, it was the cus
tom in the colleges to teach that the
men of tne past were the greatest
this world has ever seen; but to-day 7
this teaching is changed. It is
Deucalion who is held up as the
model and example. Mothers name
their sons Deucalion, as the most
valuable birth-gift fhey can make.
Deucalion is a household word. In
deed, there is only one name that is
near to it in familiarity.”
“You trouble me,” 1 said, frowning.
“I have tried to do my duty 7 for its
own sake, and for the country’s sake,
not for the pattings and fondlings
of the vulgar. And besides, if there
are names to be in every one’s
mouth, they should be the names of
the gods.”
Tatho shrugged his shoulders.
“The gods? They occupy 7 us very lit
tle these latter years. With our mod
ern science, we have grown past the
tether of the old gods, and no new
one has appeared. No, my Lord
Deucalion, if it were merely the
gods who were your competitors on
men’s lips, your name wou.d be a
thousand times the better known.”
“Of mere human names,” I said,
“the name of this new empress
should come first in Atlantis, our
lord the old king being now dead.”
“She certainly 7 would have.it so,”
replied Tatho; and there was some
thing in his tone which made me see
that more was meant behind the
words. I drew him to one of the mar
ble seats, and bent myself familiarly
toward him. “I am speaking,” I said,
fWmm
TATHO ENTERED, I AT HIS HEELS.
“not of the new viceroy 7 of Yucatan,
but to my 7 old friend Tatho, a mem
ber of the priests’ clan, like myself,
with w'houi I worked side by side in
a score of the smaller home gov
ernments, in hamlets, in villages, in
smaller towns, in greater towns, as
we gained experience in war and
knowledge in the art of ruling peo
ple, and so tediously won our promo
tion. I am speaking in Tatho’s pri
vate abode, that was mine own not
two hours since, and I would have an
answer with that plainness which we
always then used to one another.”
The new viceroy sighed whimsic
ally. “I almost forget how to speak
in plain words now,” he said. “We
have grown so polished in these lat
ter day's, that mere bald truth would
be hissed as indelicate. But for the
memory of those early 7 years, when
we expended as much law and
thought oter the ownership of a hay
byre as we should now over the fate
of a rebellious city, I will try and
speak plain to you even now, Deucal
ion. Tell me, old friend, what is it?”
“What of this new empress?”
He frowned. “I might have guessed
y 7 our subject,” he said.
“Then speak upon it. Tell me of all
the changes that have been made.
What has this Phorenice done to
make her throne unstable in Atlan
tis?”
Tatho frowned still. “If I did not
know you to be as honest as our
Lord the Sun, your- questions would
carry mischief with them. Phor
enice has a short way 7 with those
who are daring enough to discuss
her politics for other purposes than
politely to praise them.”
“You can leave me ignorant if you
wish,” I said,* with a touch of chill.
This Tatho seemed to be different
from the Tatho 1 had known at home
—Tatho my workmate, Tatho who
had read with me in the college of
priests, who had run with me in many
a furious charge, who had labored
with me so heavily that the peoples
under us might prosper. But he was
quick enough to see my change of
tone.
“You force me back to my old
self,” he said, with a half-smile,
“though it is hard enough to forget
the caution one has learned during
this last 20 years, even when speak
ing with you. Still, whatever may 7
have happened to the rest of us, it
is clear to see that you at least have
not •changed, and, old friend, I am
ready 7 to trust you with my life if
you ask it. In fact, you do ask me
that very thing when you tell me to
speak all 1 know of Phorenice.”
I ndoded. This was more like the
old times, when there was full con
fidence between us. “The gods will
it now that I return to Atlantis,” I
said, “and what happens after that
the gods alone know. But it would
be of service to me if I could land on
her shores with some knowledge of
this Phorenice. for at present I am
as ignorant ccnceining her as some
savage from Europe or mid-Africa.”
“What would y ou hare me tell?”
“Tell all. I know only that she
a woman, reigns, where, by the an
cient law of the land, a man should
rule; that she is not even ci the
priestly clan from which the law
says all rulers must be drawn; and
that, from what you say, she has
caused the throne to totter. The
throne was as firm as the everlast
ing hills in the old king's day, Ta
tho.”
“History has moved with pace since
then, and Phorenice has spurned it.
You know 7 her origin?”
“I know only the exact little I
have told you.”
“She was a swineherd’s daughter
from the mountains, though this Is
never even whispered now, as she
has declared herself to be a daugh
ter of the gods, with a miraculous
birth and upbringing. As she has
decreed it a'' sacrilege to question
this parentage, and has ordered to
be burned all those that seem to rec
ollect her more earthly origin, the
fable passes current for truth. You
see the faith I put in you, Deucal
ion, by telling you what you wish to
learn.”
“There has always been trust be
twen us.”
“I know; but this habit of sus
picion is hard to cast off, even with
you. However, let me put your good
faith between me and the torture
further. Zaemon, you remember, was
governor of the swineherd’s prov
ince, and Zaemon’s wife saw Phor
enice and took her away to adopt
and bring up as her own. It is said
that the swineherd and his women
objected; perhaps they did; anyway,
I know they died; and Phorenice was
taught the arts and graces, and
brought up as a daughter of the
Priestly clan.”
“But still she was an adopted
daughter only,” I objected.
“The omission of the ‘adopted’ was
her will at an early age,” said Ta
tho, dryly, “and she learned early to
have her wishes carried into fact.
It was notorious that before she had
grown to 15 years she ruled not only
the women of the household, but
Zaemon also, and the province that
was beyond Zaemon.”
“Zaemon was learned,” I said, “and
a devout follower of the gods, and
searcher into the higher mysteries;
but, as a ruler, he was always a
flabby fellow.”
“I do not say that opportunities
have not come usefully in Phoren
ice’s way, but she had genius as
well. For her to have raised her
self at all from what she was, was
remarkable. Not one woman out of
a thousand, placed as she was, would
have grown to be aught higher than
a mere wife of some sturdy country
man, who was sufficiently simple to
care nothing for pedigree. But look
at Phorenice: it was her whim to
take exercise as a man-at-arms and
practice with all the utensils of war;
and then, before anyone quite knows
how or why it happened, a rebellion
had broken out in the province, and
here was she, a slip of a girl, leading
Zaemon’s troops.”
“Zaemon, when I knew him, was a
mere derision in the field.”
“Hear me on. Phorenice put down
the rebellion in masterly fashion, and
gave the conquered a choice between
sword and serv. *e. They fell into
her ranks at once, and were faithful
to her from that moment. I tell you,
Deucalion, there is a marvelous fas
cination about the woman.

COASTING WITHOUT SNOW.
Fourth of July Celebrated In Los
Angelen in an Inianal
Manner,
With the thermometer registering
100 degrees in the shade and a mid
summer sun beating down upon the
semi-tropical land, the boys and girls
and many of the grown people of Los
Angeles celebrated the Fourth coast
ing on sleds down long hill slopes
where not a flake of snow ever has
fallen, says the Chicago Tribune. It
probably was the first time on record
that children with bare feet and sun
bonnets ever enjoyed “sleighing,”
and there can be no doubt that it is
the most unique sledding ever at
tempted.
It all came about through a discov
ery by a boy with a penchant for in
vestigating and experimenting, who
found that snow isn’t the only thing
that makes the hills slippery, and
the result is that the people can and
do now enjoy a winter sport where
winter never comes, and without the
necessity of wrapping up their heads
to keep biting frost from nipping off
their precious ears and noses.
After the spring rains the southern
California mountains and hills be
come thickly covered with weeds and
grasses, which lie and dry in the sum
mer heat, leaving a brown coating so
thick that it remains until the fol
lowing season. While playing on a
hill an inquisitive lad found the dead
wild mustard so slick that he could
scarcely walk over it. Instinct sug
gested that he get a board and take
a slide, and he did. Other boys saw
him and took a hand, and everything
was lovely! Evolution brought sleds
and by common consent the Fourth
was chosen as the time for a sort of
“grand opening.” A smooth slope a
quarter of a mile long was selected,
and everybody who had anything to
coast on, as well as many who hadn’t,
was there to enter into the exhilarat
ing sport. It was a winter carnival
in summer and a remarkable affair.
And hereafter coasting wi if be a com
mon southern California.
The spectacle of half a hundred
yelling boys and shrieking girls
shooting down the hill at lightning
express speed, landing in heaps at
the end of the run, and trudging and
pulling their sleds up the long slope
was as strange as it was interesting,
and a crowd stood in the sweltering
hedt and watched the unusual per
formance. There were exciting races,
thrilling tumbles when obstructions
chanced in the way, and hairbreadth
escapes, just like" those where snow
and ice afford a smooth but chilly
glideway. At the steeper places the
sleds go so fast that it did not take
the youngsters long to discover it
would require a brake to keep them
from flying into kingdom come, and
one was improvised. Now they are
in use on all the sleds. A young lady
who took the trip palled the lever
too far at the wrong moment and
went through a performance that
would shame an acrobat. Before she
was through standing on her head
a dozen other sleds and their occu
pants were piled on top of her.

“My poor, hungry man, if I w T ere to

the angular smeller and the uncer
tain spectacles.

and yearning bread pouch; “Til git a

French Parliamentary Commission
to Devise Means to Increase

Anxiety over the depopulation of
France resulted in an interesting de
bate in the French senate the other
day when Waldeck-Rousseau, the pre
mier, accepted, in the name of the gov
ernment, a proposal for the nomina
tion of an extra parliamentary com
mission to seek means of increasing
the birth rate and diminishing mor
tality. The proposal was counter
signed by 133 senators. Senator Ber
nard, in proposing the inquiry, com
pared the peopling of France with that

that century France had 26,000,000 in

ordinary woman to buy, but they have
long since found that expensive mate
rials is not the only thing needed to
make an attractive and fashionable
garment. There are comparatively
few of the elaborate costumes worn by
New York models of fashion
which cannot be practically reproduced
with goods that need not cost one
tenth of that used in the originals. I
have known of many cases in which
deft home fingers have, in a compara
tively short time, dnplicated at a small
cost and with inexpensive materials
some of. the most elaborate gowns de
scribed in the modern fashion letter.
The above paragraphs are offered in
the nature of an explanation. But a
few’ days ago I received a letter from a
western reader asking why I confined
myself, as a rule, to the gowns worn
by the very rich. It is the very rich,
dear reader, who set the styles for the
great masses of the middle classes of
American women. The middle classes
emulate the rich in many ways, and es
pecially in that of dress, so far as pos
sible. And the rich enjoy the distinc
tion thus thrust upon them. It was
only last month that I called the atten
tion of a wealthy acquaintance to the
fact that one of her favorite costumes
had been reproduced by a poor ac
quaintance of mine, a woman to whom
a sl2 or sls gown was a luxury. She
had accomplished the emulation by the
use of comparatively inexpensive ma
terials and the use of her brains and
fingers. The wealthy woman was
proud of the fact that her taste had
been considered of sufficient merit to
be worthy of copying.
And now let us take a glance at some
of these evening costumes of this same
set of American fashion models, cos
tumes the expense of which runs far
beyond the purchasing power of the
average woman of the middle classes,
but which at the same time may be re
produced with excellent effect at com
paratively small expense by the use of
less expensive materials.
A charming evening gown seen at
one of the theaters recently was of
black net trimmed with white blond
lace and black sequin embroidery. The
black net was made up over white glace
silk. At the foot of the skirt were two
accordion-plaited frills of black chif
fon, edged with narrow white inser
tion. Designs of black sequin embroid
ery, outlined with fine steel beads, run
down the skirt with white blond inser
tion on each side. This trimming
scheme is carried out alternately all
around the skirt. The bodice is a low
decollete and slightly full in front,
with a deep crushed girdle of shrimp
pink panne. Wee ruffles of black chif
fon edged with tiny white insertion
form very short sleeves and fancy bo
lero trimmed around the top with
crushed pink velvet and silk roses and
strappings of black velvet.
The evening blouses are quite as pop
ular as the entire gowns. One of these
was made of pale bine glace silk, veiled
with white lace which was embroid
ered with tiny flowers in pink and bine
silk and entwined - scrolls of gold
thread. There was a wee double ruch
ing of white chiffon around the low
decollete, with straps over the shoul
ders of black velvet baby ribbon. Xar
roW bands of lace about the arms, with
deep frills of lace below, formed the
sleeves. The girdle was poinfed and
formed of bands of black velvet baby
ribbon with narrow lace insertion be
tween.
Another blouse of the semievening
order was of Irish crochet appliqued
in ecru batiste and embellished with
tiny roses of white chiffon. This was
made over soft silk in eau de Nile. It
had a round neck and elbow sleeves and
a slight fullness directly in front at
the waist line. A crushed girdle of eau
de Nile panne.

“Someone in Kansas proposed that a
statue of Ceres be placed on the dome of the
new statehouse, but now he wishes he
hadn’t made the proposition,” remarked the
exchange editor, as he laid down a Kansas
paper.
“What’s the objection?” asked the tele
graph editor.
“It is urged that no one in Kansas knows
the lady, and that she probably was an ac
tress, anyhow. It is the opinion that the
figure of Chief Fewclothes, an Indian, would
be more appropriate as an ornament to the
dome of the Kansas r catehouse.”
“.Well, I should think that a statue of
Chief Fewclothes would be a nude depar
ture, at any rate.”—Pittsburg Gazette.

Mass., U. S. A., have given years of study
to the skillful preparation of cocoa and
chocolate, and have devised machinery and
systems peculiar to their methods of treat
ment, whereby the purity, palatability, and
highest nutrient characteristics are re
tained.
“Their preparations are known the world
over and have received the highest indorse
ments from the medical practitioner, the
nurse, and the intelligent housekeeper and
caterer.”

“How crazy you women act over the
‘Woman’s page!’ ” said Mr. Pozenby, in a
tone of withering sarcasm. “I wonder why
the papers don't have a ‘Man’s page,’ too?”
“They do,” Mrs. Pozenby replied.
“I’ve never seen one.”
“Oh, yes, you have. It’s the page devoted
to prize fighting and horse racing and other
occupations of that sort.”—Youth’s Com

Persons contemplating a journey East or
West should be careful that the rates paid
for their transportation do not exceed those
charged by the Nickel Plate Road.
This company always offers lowest rates
and the service is efficient. Careful at
tention is'given to the wants of all first
aiid second class passengers by uniformed
colored attendants. The dining car service
of the Nickel Plate Road is above criticism
and enables the traveler to obtain meals
at from thirty-five (35) cents to SI.OO but
no higher.
The Pullman service is the usual high
grade standard. Semi-weekly transconti
nental tourist cars ply between Atlantic
and Pacific Coasts. Confer with nearest
agent of the Nickel Plate Road.
