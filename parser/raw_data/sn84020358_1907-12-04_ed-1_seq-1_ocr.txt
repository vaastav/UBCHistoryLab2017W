Washington,, De.c. 3. The, fact. offl-,
daily announced to-day by the Jap
anese embassy' that Ambassador Aoki
has been called- home by. the Tokio
eovernment to make verbal report to
fit on the "immigration' question' has
I caused an unusual stir in diplomatic
circles here. Coming right on the eve
I' of the departure of the most formida
fble battleship fleet ever assembled un-
der the American flag for the Pacific,
there are not a few among even the
conervative diplomats who consider
the ' action of Tokio in calling Aoki
home as significant. This belief is
jheld even in the face of statements Dy
the Japanese envoy and attaches of
the legation that the call is made
merely that the ambassador can dis
cuss with his government a question of
,-ital importance, which can be done
setter verbally than through diplomat
c correspondence. ,
; To all outward appearances the, re
ations between Japan and the United
States are friendly. So far as known,
mly two questions have arisen to
.ause any apprehension the Phlllp-
aines and immleration. .Tannrv has
epeatedly denied having any designs
n the far eastern Islands, and the
natter of immigration has been con-
idered well on the road toward settle-
nent. - Is there more beneath the
urface? Does the sending of a fleet
a the Pacific and the coincident re
all home of . Aoki . mean friction ?
'here Is a strong under sentiment
ere that it does, despite smoothly
'orded statements to the contrary.
The stir in diplomatic circles Is the
eatest sinoe the recall of Von Holle-
l en; the German ambassador, in 1902,
j nder somewhat similar circum
ijances. Talk of trouble between this
buntry fend Germany was at that time
fyard . on-ail sides. Von Holle-ben,
jWever, lacked much of having as
i bod relations with the' Washington
'j jbvernment as has Viscount Aoki. The
jerman ambassador received a cable
fspatcti from the foreign office one
ght ordering him to report to Berlin,
jjormany soon gave evidence of her
sire to continue the best relations
j js8ible by sending here Baron Speck
Jin Sternburg, a long-time personal
Jlend of President Roosevelt.

OYER TOiSATDRDAK
Bright Case Submitted to
Court Late Yesterday
, j. Without Argument. ,
DEFENSE CLOSE, S LATE
Loomis and Goodhart Get Into
Tilt Over Admission of
; Evidence.
The trial of Supernumeran1' Bright
of the local police department on a
charge of breach of the peace on John
Noel, a law school student," as the se
quel of the trouble in the New Haven
theater severa weekd ago, continue.!
through all- day yesterday and after a
long session that lasted until nearly (I
o'clock all testimony was in and the
case was submitted to the court with
out argument. Judge Mathewson then
continued the case until Saturday
morning for decision.
Quite a tilt occurred during the
course of the case yesterday after
noon. Attorney Seymour C. Loomis,
for the student, attempted to ln'.ri.
duce evidence that Bright had been
practically told that he must1 get
through when he was In the ernploy
of the Fair Haven East borough or he
would be discharged. The matt' was
brought up In an attempt to get In a
question as to what Bright had testi
fied to in regard to this matter before
the city court In the case against Noel.
Attorney Goodhart, for the defense,
objected to the question, and it was
ruled out. Right afterwards he at
tempted to introduce records which
would show that Bright had been noti
fied that he must resign by a certain
time. Then Mr. Goodhart called at
tention to the fact that this r.-ns pro
ceeding In the line that had just been
forbidden, and after denouncing It as
lese majeste to the court he appealed
to the Judge to ruie out this line.
Judge Mathewson promptly declared
that the evidence was forbidden and
the case proceeded. -
Bright was on the stand almost all
afternoon. His examination wm
closed late in the day and as soon as
the case came to him for decision the
judge adjourned court until Saturday,
when his decision is expected.
George W. Lewis has sent his res'g
natlon from the board of finance to
Mayor Etudley asking that he be "re
lieved of his duties at once and thfu
his successor be appointed. Mr. , Lewis
in time of service Is one of the oldest
members of the board and his resigns.-1
tion at this time comes as a great sur
prise both to the mayor and the other
members of the department.
vThen askel last night why he had
resigned Mr, Lew!s said tint thera
were several reasons. Only cue, how
ever, h? said he cared to make puM:
at this time and that was that he did
not care to give the evenings neoestary
to the work. , " -
.Mr. Lewis pointed out that he has
been on the board for the p-ist five
years and that in each year, there are
fifty-two regular meetings, the board
beside this having met practically ev
ery night In November to make up the
estimates for tho coming year.
His term on the board of finance
would not expire until the first of Feb
ruary, 1909, but it Is said that Mr.
Lewis would probably hive served th9
entire tims had the "harmony on the
board been nearer perfection.
' The split was on the question of
the raising of salariel It is said. Mr.
Lewis thought that certain of the in
creases granted were unauthorised
while there were others who flsked the
city for more money and who had Been
in the employ of the municipality for
a number of years who received very
small if any increases.
Mr. Lewis resigned at this t!m, ac
cording to the report, in order that
Mayor Studley, if he chose, miht ap
point a successor from the republican
ranks. Had Mr.. Lewis waited until
after January, the incoming, member
of the board would have been a demo

Duma the One Spot for, its Utterance,
Says Shublnsky.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 3. The duma
adjourned af a late hour to-night
without coming to a vote on the min
isterial declaration. Expectations that
the Octobi-rist party would define its
principles end program were disap
pointed. The speeches of the October
ist leaders, Count Uvaroff, Prof. Ka
pustin and others were marked by
half-hearted criticisms of the govern
ment's program, but they reserved
judgment in the matter.
SI. Shublnsky, openly stating the
reasons ,for the Octoberist reserve,
said: "There would be the greatest
danger to Russia to-day should the
duma become oppositional, as that
would end the constitutional experi
ment In Rusria for a long time. Let
the deputies be circumspect in order
to defend the duma, and the tribute be

Printing Co;, of St. Lcuis, Mo., a judg.
ment creditor for $21,273, who Is suing
in equity on behalf of itsolf and all
other creditors of the exposition slml
larly situated. The plaintiff alleges
that John Monk, one of the exposition
construction contractors, also suing for
a receivership, Is nt a judgment credl
tor, and that the court is without juris
(Jletton to appoint a receiver in the
Slonk action, and asks a dismissal of
this and the consolidation of all litiga
tion of every description against Hie
Jamestown Exposition company, or
trusts created In connection therewith,
into one case, and that a. receiver 'be
named to take charge and manage the
affairs of the company for the prea
ervation of its valuable assets ai
whole.
The exposition company, answering
the Monk suit, asks a dismissal of the
same, but petitions tne court io so
modify the optional contracts for the
sites of state buildings, etc., requiring
that the same must be taken up within
ninety, days after tho close of the ex
position, so that those holding con
tracts for said sites will not be re
quired to act until they are offered
good and certain deeds given under
the direction of the court.
President Tucker, of the exposition
company, in a statement m regara to
the contemplated receivership, said:
"While I know nothing of the matter
In detail, L presume it is likely that a
receiver will be appointed. The ap
pointment, however, would in no way
affect the question of reopening the

WINE GROWERS' APPEAL
Ask Aid of Temperance Organizations
lu license Regulations.
New York, (Dec. 3. An interesting
alignment! of forces in the fight for
temperance may develop from a reso
lution passed to-day "by the American
Winegrowers association, now in ses
sion here, inviting the cooperation of
temperance organizations and societies
In seconding Its efforts toward provid
ing wine licenses separate from the
general liquor license, which, the grow
ers state, is a right step in the tem
perance movement. (
The resolution states that "the use
of light wines at meals will do more
for temperance than all the no-license
and prohibition laws yet passed." The
members of the association, further
pledged themselves to guard and main
tain the purity and quality of their
wines; Lee J. Vance, of New York,
secretary of the associated declared
that the cause of tetuperanace had
been advanced in those countries
where wine was used as a beverage.
