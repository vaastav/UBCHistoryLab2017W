D. C. , December fi.
At the opening the ncnatu was not as
fall as usual , but tilled up soon after
by the overflow from the house . The
senate was called to order at 12
o'clock. Senator Windom's creden
tials were presented and ho was sworn
in.
in.The
The usual committees to notify the
liouso and the president were ap
pointed.
A largo number of hills , miinly
those which failed in the last con-
grewB , were introduced and laid on
the fable to bo referred when the
committees arc appointed.
At 1:10 p. m. the aonato tank a re
cess until 2:30. :
The most interesting and only in
cident of political interest in the pro
ceedings was during the three minutes
the senate was in session after recess.
Edmunds offered resolutions review
ing and continuing the committees as
they existed at thu close of
.the last session , and asked that
Alley Ho over under the rules.
Pugh wa ready with another reso
lution intended as a substitute , leav-
iud it to bo divided by the president
pro tern , whether the committees
should be equally decided between
the two parties , and if ho so decided
them to designate which of the com-
urittoes shall be constituted with a
majority of members democrats , and
which , with a majority of republicans ,
and that thu senate proceed to the
election of committees on the basis in
klio usual way.
Edmunds made a point of orc'erthat
this rosoulution was not in accordance
, \ . with the rules of the senate.
Without decision , both resolutions
and the point of order went over until
to-morrow and thu senate adjourned.

Mr. Kelly , senior member , admin
istered the oath.
Mr. Keifer , on takincr the chair ,
returned the usual thanks. Ho said
that neither parly hud a majority in
cither house over all oth
ers , a tiling which had not ex
isted since thu period before Lincoln's
. rst term. There had not been dur
ing the interval so few vital questions
of national importance left unsettled
to dr.iw party lines upon as now. In
purely party mattcis ho would alwajs
bo found a republican ; in all otheiH ,
"impartial. As the prosperity at proH-
ent w s greater than ever before iu
tlio country , bo hoped the present
congress would bo a purely business
congress.

pous manner.
Mr. Hrajri ; appealed in the name of
humanity to the great American people

AFTEll TIIK 1'im.SIMMONS.
All indications now point to a via-
orous onslaught by southern republicans -
licans on the poatollieos throughout
the south. Many of these olliccs are
now filled by democrats and lukewarm
rppublicaim. A move in this direc
tion has already been made by Sena
tor Kellogg , of Louisiana , at whose
request a list has been propitrod of
employes of the postoflico depart
ment , showing the compensation they
receive and the states they hail frcm.
tVn effort will bo made to havw the
ottices of thin department and all
other departments of the government
apportioned out by states , and thus
aocuro fair representation of southern
republicans to oih'co. This pro
gramme 1ms received an impetus by
the success of the southern republic
ans in electing Brownlow as door
keeper of the hoase.

NYAHiusc.TON , December o. The
court room was crowded when it
opened at 11 a. m. ( .iuiteau made a
speech , Baying ho wanted the insanity
oxpertn to understand ho claimed to
have been impelled by a pewor bo
could not control to do a certain act.
The ( | iiestion wus whether that was
insanity.
James IJ. Kiernan , an insanity ex
pert , said heraa editor of The Chicago
cage Medical 1'eview nnd hud studied
mental diseases as a specialty since
1874. In reply to n question by Sco-
villo , ho said if it was tmo that the
prisoner's habits _ were n-ally as de
scribed , if insanity' prevailed in the
family , if many persons had declared
him insane and if it was true ho hud
been dominated by the idea that he
was inspired , that the witness on such
assumption would regard the prisoner
as insane.
Ouiteau looked around approvingly.
lie got excited because Davidge , in a
question , used the word "vulgar , " and
said that there was nothing vulaar in
the caao , but everything waa high-
toned. [ Laughter. ] Ouiteau smiled
approval upon iho laughter.
The witness said a person who be
hoved ho was inspired by God would ,
in acting out the inspiration , act with
his usual peculiarities.
Guitoan here broke out about some
utterance by his ux-wifo , which ho
hud just seen in u paper , and ho
wanted the court to know that it was
all lies. After ono question hoaskoc ,
"Where hereditary insanity exists in
n man , docs ii not have to show itielf
sooner or later upon sufHciont
cause ? "
"Yos , sir , " replied the witness.
"That is all , " said the prisoner.
The subject of emotional insanity ,
inspirational and hereditary insanity ,
was further discussed and Guiteau
broke out with the remark : "Well ,
if the political situation had not been
what it was during last spring there
would have boon no occasion for my
inspiration. " The audience lauched
at this remark and Guiluau looked
around approvingly.
The witness stated that probably
ono person in five are insane. "Ah , "
said Mr. Davidge , "that does not leave
much chance for many of us. "
"No , " fcroko out ( Juitcau , "that
takes you in , judge. "
"Well , " sain Mr. D.ividgo , "if ono
person in five are insane , two of the
juroia in this case are doomud. "
Mr. Scoville "Probably the law-
jorn will tukii their places. "
Tliis mdly was greeted with a loud
peal of laughter. Guiteau grinned
again and patted Scoville IMI the buck
upprovinirly.
At 1 o'clock a recces was taken for
Inilf an hour.
The first witness after re-cess wan
Col. R. J. Ilinton , of The Washington
G.i/wtte. . Ho remomberjd seeing the
prisoner at lopublican hoadqtmiturit.
Formed the opinion that he w.ia a de
cidedly ill-balanced , cranky egotist.
lie thought thu prisoner's speech a
ridiculous count ruction.
Guitoau interrupted him : "It wan
nothing of the sort ; it wan highly
spoken of by the best men nf the na
tion. You1 to witnot-H , "don't know
what you are talking about. Scovillo
liad no business to put you on thu
stand. I am no fuol. Seville -
villo cannot prove rno tel
l > o a fool. I would rather
bo hung as u man than acquitted UH a
fool. Putting such u man on the
stand i ) an insult to me. If yon
( talking to Scoville ) had not put Davis
on the stand it would have boon bet-
: er. I thought you wuro a smarter
awyer than you are. "
This outburst caused cuiiHiderablo
oxcilimient. The prisoner gesticulated
wildly , and paid no huud to Scovillo's
endeavors to quiet him.
Chnrles II , Nicols , superintendent
of the Blnomingdulo asylum , was then
called. The hypothetical condition
) f the prisoner's mind at thu time of
he assassination wus propound to
iim , and the witness elated ( iuiteau
van a fit subject for u luuntis asylum.
Ciuiteau brandished his arms fiercely
mil said : "I rest my case on the fact
hat I was inspired by the Deity , 1
will not allow any otlier defense. "
"Had the prisoner , " imkud Scoville
) f the wiuiuiH , "knowledge and men-
al capacity to judge between right
ind wiling , to nnduttjUiid the iiaturu
) f his act ? "
Witness In my opinion , fiuilean
van insane at the time ho shut
ho president.
Dr. Woostor , of Snlem , Mass. , in
regard to the prisoner's insanity , said
10 was a little dubious as to thu oxuct
iicaniug of the word "inspired. "
( iuiteau exclaimed : "Inspiration , in
his case , moaim the interjection of
something into the mind foreign to it. "
A hypothetic case was explained to
: ) rs , Gelding , MoHndo , Chatting and
Finhur , who said , if the- suppositions
were true , Guiteau was imuno at the
imu ho shot Gar field.
Hcovillo said ho expected President
Arthur to testify , but ho was too busy
with his message to congress to attend
court. Ho expected Clifford , of Chicago
cage , to bo prtmont to-morrow. There
were only two or throe ifloro witnesses
for the defense.
Prisoner I want General Grant
and Senator Coukling and other
prominent inon who were engaged in
politics last nprin to chine here. I
don't care for Scotiile'e opinion I
know what I am about , ntid I would
like your honor to nubmeiia thwo
men. I wan to t ll about the politics !
situation. It is very important for
mo to show thin fact , and I want thtvie
men nubptvnaod , and I claim I WHM on
friendly relations with all the promi
nent men of the republican party.
The ntmoval of President Gurtiold wus
iwing to the political situation.
[ Pounding on the tftblo und shouting. ]
It in important that the factn should
come out. Scovillo is a good man ,
but he has n narrow view of the &ise.
Ho is a good lawyer , but a poor poli
tician.
Scovillu thought Arthur would bo
fAillicicnt for the purposes of thu de
fense.
Prisoner--Oh , no. I want Grant ,
Conkliug , Platt and others who weie
interested in the politics ( if the tune.
I want your honor to K'.INI nu mder
siibpit'iiaing these men. 1 uunt
Storrs , of Chicngo horvsUs" . 1 eon-
uider him one of thu ino t brilliant
men of the bar. Hu linx the true
theory of the business , and ho dniHii't
take any stock in thu idea that 1 am
a fool. Storrs says I am the ablest
lawyer in thin case , nnd X do not quar
rel with him for his ( opinion [ laugh
ter ] , and I want to nay right here that
I would bo pleuood if Arthur would
recognize Storrs' abilities arjd mnko
him attorney general."I make this
announcement publicly. 1 am not
looking for any favors , and 1 think it
would bu nu honor to Arthur if ho
would make Emory Btorrs attorney
gen ral.
Extracts from Guiteau's book ,

permanent residence here , ho travels
from place to place in the purtuit of
his profession. Mra. Shivoly says he
lef t home iu September and the last
she heard from him he was in thu west
and she expected a letter from him
from Chicago or Cincinnati. She adds
that a number of years ago ho Buttered

manner. Thoab portods would
cover two or three days , after which
be would become perfectly rational.
About a month ago , in Cleveland , he
sustained an accident by which his
head was injured , and she feara this
may have caused temporary aberration
or insanity. Mrs. Shively did not
know her husband intended visiting
Washington. Hu is a son of a cler
