Pardee Praises Roosevelt
Former Governor George C. Pardee of
California said that it wasJils fortune
to conduct through California "one of
the greatest men living on this earth"
(referring to President Roosevelt). Ha
said that in the course of that trip he
often wa3 impressed with the idea that
tho improvement of the rivers and har
bors of the country really began in the
mountains.
"My mind," said he, "turned to the
million and a quarter square miles of
land in the Mississippi valley, threatened
evory year with Incalculable damage by
floods, and I often wondered whether the
people realized that the improvement of
their waterways should begin in th«
mountains."
President Ransdell of the congress then
introduced John Barrett, director of thj
bureau of American republics, who de
livered an address on the "Waterways
of Other Americas." Mr. Barrett re
ferred to the address at the openlns
congress of Secretary of State Root and
the accomplishments of Secretary Root
personally He declared mat oecruiary
Root had achieved more for American
prestige and honor through his trips to
South America and to Mexico than bad
been achieve- by all the diplomatic cor
respondence for a hundred years.
Mr. Barrett called attention to tho fact
that the republics of Central and South
America were spending more money on
the Improvement of rivers and harbors
In proportion to their population and
ability than the United States.
Attitude of Farmers
John M. Stahl. former president ot the
farmers' national congress, delivered an
address on "The Attitude of American
Farmers Toward the Improvement of the
Int3inal Waterways of Amerloa." H*
assured the congress mat the farmers
stood with the delegates in favor of the
improvement of the waterways and that
they advocated a comprehensive plan of
Improvement.
Dr. N. G. Blaklock of Walla Walla,
Wash., concluded the afternoon proceed
ings with an address in advocacy of
Improvement of the Columbia river. He
urged that the project was not- merely
local but of world-wide importances.
The Pacific ocean, he said, would be
the theater of the world's greatost dramas
to come, and that necessarily the Pa
cific northwest would be the center of
the commerce of the northwestern world.
He said the traffic between the Occident
and the orient would traverse the Co
lumbia river, because It would seek tht?
shortest rcuto to the orient from this
country. He eald that he spokp net
merely as an American, but as a cltiien
of the world, because he believed Amer
icans eventually would become a light,
a guidance and an Inspiration to tha
whole world.
