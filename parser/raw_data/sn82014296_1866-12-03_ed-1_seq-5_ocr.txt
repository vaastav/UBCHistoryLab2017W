land, hence for Liverpool," taking the
Kate Dyer on the starboard bow, cut
ting her completely through and
causing her' to sink jjnstantly, giving
those who were saved barely time to
get into the boats.r Thirteen of the
crew went down with the ship. The
Kate Dyer had a pilot on board who
says, as also does the Captain, that
they, saw the steamer about' fifteen
minutes before she struck them, and
had she kept her course a collision
would have been avoided.
The Scotland. had her: bow badly
stove, and, after picking up the re
mainder of the crew of the ship,
headed back for New York, but the
leak gaining rrapidly, she was com
pelled to run ashore off Sandy Hook
to prevent "sinking, where Bhe still
lies this morning at five o'clock. She
was half fell of water and her pumps
useless. ;, : - . .( ,

New York, Dec. 2. The report of
the Liverpool breadstuffs market of
yesterday, as furnished to the unfor
tunate victims of the Associated Press
menopoly, states that market as being
very active. The report of the same
market, from well-informed agents
of the United States and European
News Association, stated that the
breadstuff market was dull. -The
latter is the only reliable report re
ceived for the press of this country,
and is so accepted by merchants and
produce dealers generally.. This re
port of the so-called Associated Press
of a very active breadstuff market ih
Liverpool, was undoubtedly promul
gated in the interest of certain par
ties connected with some-of the news
papers belonging to the decaying mo
nopoly in this city for speculative pur
noses: and the successful ..efforts of
.Mr, r Craig,, while agent of : the late
Associated rress, to prevent just such
imposition upon the public, while in
charge of their dispatches, has been
an incentive for the personal abuse
latelv indulged in, by unprincipled
parties. u 'J U I CUUl

Washington. Dec. 2. At the Re-,
publican caucus last evening, among
other. proposition discussed, , was one .
that a law should be introduced and
passed requiring a meeting of the'
40th Congress on the 5th of March
next, immediately upon the termina
tion of the present Congress. The !
proposition met with general accept
ance, and the Republican members j
generally are understood -to -be in
favor of. it. c In the present temper of
Congress, as indicated by the mem
bers already arrived, there is little
doubt that such a law will . be passed
before the termination of - the 39th
Congress. The Republican members
of Congress express little hope of any
amicable arrangement of the difficul
ties between that body and the Presi
dent. The reports to the effect that
the President was disposed to make
concessions calculated to diminish the
derangement with Congress on unim
portant matters are without founda
tion. There: is a probability that Con
gress may adjourn to-morrow betore
the President's message is received.
in order to respond to the mass wel
come, and in that case ot course the
message will go over to luesday.'
The following card was received to

Washington, Dec. 1. The Repub
lican members of the House at pres
ent in Washington had a. caucus in
Representative Hall this morning.
Between fifty and sixty members were
present. Thaddeus Stevens, President;-,
Hon, E. C, llngersoll, of Illi
nois, Acting Secretary. After con
siderable discussion a committee of
en was appointed to report at an ad
journed meeting next Wednesday
evening such measures as it will 1
be deemed necessary to urge upori the
early attention of Congress, ... f .
A resolution was introduced recom
mending' the Senate to reiect a ma- i
jorityof the appointments made by
the President since the adjournment
or the last Congress.
In the course of the discussion the
members related instances of what
was termed particular hardships and
inconsistencies in removals and ap
pointments. f " -
There was some difference of
opinion as to the propriety or expedi
ency of this recommendation, but on
a vote being taken there were no votes
in the negative.
. : Colfax was, unanimously, designated
to reply to-the address of welcome - at
the loyal mass reception, wh:ch comes
off on Monday, on behalf of the
House. The welcoming address is to
be made by Judge Carter, of the Dis
trict Supreme Court. It was suggest
ed and agreed that a Senator should
be invited to reply also on behalf of
the Senate, that an arrangement be
made by Speaker Colfax; and, that
the Senator so designated for one. to
represent both Houses.
The indications are that Congress
will be a very Radical one. The tone
of the speeches were very bitter against
President Johnson.
The causus was in session over two
hours, and there was a free inter
change of opinion, and a general una
nimity of sentiment on important
questions. - The caucus adjourned un
til next Wednesday evening,' when
more Republican members will have
arrived to participate in the proceed
ings - " iv'" J -("' ':

The committee appointed to prepare
a programme of action for the Radical
caucus on Wednesday evening, have
their propositions all cut and dried.
The bill , they will offer- for the ap
proval of the caucus is very similar to
the, one offered in Congress by, Hon.
Thad., Stevens. -It contemplates the
abolition of the present State govern
ment in all the Southern States, on
the ground of. their . uncoiistitution
ality and provides for the appoint
ment , of , a Commisioner . for each
State,,who shall have power to ap
point : the civil and military officers
necessary ; for ; the preservation of
peace and -good ..order. .The Com
missioners are to call C -nventions for
the purpose of adjusting the Consti
tutions with a view to admission into
the Union. There' is a difference of
opinion as to the right of franchise
Some . are in favor of -only loyalists
voting, some are in favor of Congress
designating'who shall and who shall
hot vote, while others advocate j al
lowing all those to vote who are now
qualified under the State laws. The
Constitutions adopted . by these Con
ventions are to be re-submitted, but
only those to be allowed to vote who
are enfranchised by the Constitutions
voted upon, as in the case of Mary
land. '
i If the Constitutions be adopted by
these voters, then the States arc to be
readmitted, if rejected, then the re
jection will be followed by Territorial
governments. The Commissioners
are to be authorized to organize the
militia, including the colored popula
tion, to aid in carrying out the provi
sions of -the bill, , and, if called into
the. service, are to be quartered on
those rendering the call necessary.
Such arc the leading points in the
programme which will be presented
lor. the approval of the Radical cau
cus, and the Southern loyalists ex
press strong hopes of success. .The
naraeVof the Committee are r Messrs.
Stevens. Washburn, Schenck. Hart,

that at the late, election held ini No

electioh for members' of thg 40th Co'n-i
gress, as. well as forother offices, and
that in the" second Congressional Dis
trict of Maryland, Jno. L. Thomas
had 2,839 votes, which we believe all
legal, according to' .the' requirements
ot the . Constitution of Maryland last
adopted-;we, 'also, state that 'Jos
eph L. Stewart had. in the third Con
gressional ; District -of Maryland,-
i)to votes, wnich we believe also
legal. We further state that Steven
son Archer had in the Second Con
gressional District 3,009 votes for
member of the Fortieth Congress of
the United ( States, and Charles E.
Phelps had 'in said Third Congres
sional f District 5,545 votes for said
Congress ; we further state, under sol
emn obligations' imposed by our
office, that since ' the election and
prior to fully executing certificates of
election which the laws call for, we
have become convinced that a large
majority of the ballots cast for said
Archer and Phelps were so cast by
persons disfranchised for disloyalty
by the Constitution of Maryland, and
that although we, as Judges of elec-
tion, may not be able to withhold our
certificates of election from the lat
ter, we. are fully impressed with the
belief that Thomas and Stewart re
ceived large majorities of the legal
loyal ballots cast, and that-therefore
they ought, in view thereof, occupy
seats in said Fortieth Congress. ,
It will be remembered that Thomas
and Stewart were Republican candi
dates, and Archer and Phelps were
Conservatives. . , . ' '-
