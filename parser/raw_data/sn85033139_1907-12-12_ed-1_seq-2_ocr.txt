RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE PRESIDENT.
Unflinching perseverance in war against
successful dishonesty.
There must be uo halt in the course re
garding interstate commerce which the
nation lias elected to pursue. There
should lie cither a national incorporation
act or a law licensing interstate railway
companies. The interstate commerce
commission should be given power to
pass uiMjii the future issues of railway
securities. Ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission to make
a physical valuation of railroads. Hoads
should be allowed to outer into agree
ments.
There should be additional legislation
looking to the proper control of the g. *at
business concerns engaged in bite. ' ite
business, this control to be exercised for
their own benefit and prosperity no less
than for the protection of investors and 1
of the general public. Business combina
tions are necessary and it is us idle to I
desire to put un end to all corporations,
to all big combinations of capital, as
to desire to put an end to combinations
of labor. It is profoundly immoral to
put or keep on tin* statute books a law,
nominally in the interest of public mo
lality, that really puts u premium upon
public iinnio''iility, by undertaking to for
bid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, s<* that the law itself provides that
its own infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success.
The antitrust law should be made more
effleh at and more in harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so iiinended
as to forbid only the kind of combination
which does harm to the general public,
-ueh amendment to be accompanied by,
or to beau incident of, a grant of sup
ervis 'iy j tower to the government over
these big concerns engaged in interstate
business. This should be accompanied
by i .envision fur the compulsory publica
tion of accounts and the subjection of
ction of the
government officials.
The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no injustice to the
still less 1 1 ose the < tcnce of
which is on the whole of benefit to the
public. A combination should not be
tolerated if it abuse the power acquired
by combination to the public detriment.
No corporation or association of any
kind should be permitted to engage in
foreign or interstate commerce that is
formed for the purpose of, or whose
operations create, a monopoly or general
control of the production, sale, or dis
tribution of any one or more of the prime
necessities of life or articles of general
use and necessity.
Congress lias the power to charter cor
porations to engage in interstate and for
eign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and new federal corpora
tions could be created. An essential
provision of such a law should be a
method of predetermining by some fed
eral board or commission whether the
applicant for a federal charter was an
misdeeds with impnity, their example
is a very evil thing for the community.
\\'ii. r- tln-se men are business men of
gn at sagacity ami of temperament both
ilous and reckless, and where
the conditions are such that they are
without supervision or control and at first
without effective check front public opin
ion, they delude many innocent people
into making investments or embarking
in kinds of business that are really un
sound When the misdeeds of these suc
cessfully dishonest men are discovered,
suffering comes not only upon them, but i
til on tin* innocent men whom they have
mi-led. It is a painful awakening,
whenever it occurs: and, naturally, when
it does occur those who suffer are apt
to forget that the longer it was deferred
the more painful it would be. lit the
effort to punish the guilty it is both wise
and proper to endeavor so far as pos
sible t > minimize the distress of those
who have been misled by the guilty. \et
it m not possible to refrain because of
such distress from striving to put an end
to the misdeeds that are the ultimate
etuis* s of the suffering, and. as a means
to this end. where possible to punish
those responsible for them. There may
bo honest differences of opinion ns to I
many governmental policies; but surely |
thi-re can be no such differences as to
tin- need of unflinching perseverance in
llu- war against successful dishonesty.”
Wants Federal Control.
The ITi-sident heists that b-deral con
trol of all corporal ions doing an inter
slate business is necessary and that it
would benefit alike tlie corporations and
the public, lie wants the Sliernan anti
trust law strengthened and . nangod so
that while it will permit certain business
eumbimi tions, which an right and prop

binations and merging o| vast corpora

roads should welcome federal control as
it will save them irom a multitude of
conflicting laws passed by the various
States.

Association or eouiliination within the
restriction of tlio federal law.
Immediate action to currency laws is
necessary. A greater elasticity in our
currency is needed. Provision should he
made lor an emergency currency. The
emergency issue should he made with
an effective guaranty, and upon condi
tions carefully prescribed by the gov
ernment. Such emergency issue must
be basts! on adequate securities approved
by the government, and must tie issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being issued when the demand
for it was urgent, while securing its re
tirement as the demand fell off. It is
worth investigating to determine whether
o(brers and directors of national banks
should ever Is* allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should he sub
ject to the some supervision as bunks.
Nothing should bo done with the tariff

income and inheritance tax.
Abuse in issuing injunctions in labor
disputes must cease.
National inspection of railroads, along
the bin’s of steamboat inspection, should
he provided so as to prevent numerous
w recks.
Model employers’ liability act which
should apply to all employes of the gov

year preceding a presidential election,
because as a matter of fact experience
has conclusively shown that at such a
time it is impossible to get men to treat
it from the standpoint of the public good.
In my judgment the wise time to deal
with the matter is immediately after
such election.”
Income and Inheritance Taxes.
The President repeats his recommenda
tions of last year for national inherit
ance and income taxes. He thinks that
when our system of taxes is revised,
Congress should adopt his suggestions.
He points "at that the cry of a few
years ago that wealthy offenders escaped
the penalty of the law, can not be raised
now as tlie department of justice “has
, been as prompt to proceed against the
wealthiest malefactor whose crime was
1 one of greed and cunning as to proceed
; against the agitator who incites to brutal
violence. Everything that can ho done |
under the existing law, and with the
existing state of public opinion, which
so profoundly Intiueiices both the courts
I and juries, has been done.”
Too Many Unjust Injunctions.
Regarding injunctions, the President
I says:
“Instances of abuse in tlie granting of
; injunctions in labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment in the minds
of those who fe.-l that their rights are
being invaded and their liberty of action
ml of speech unwarrantably restrained
■ continues likewise to grow. Much of the
| attack on the use of the process of in
junction is wholly without warrant; but
i I am constrained to express the belief
I that for some of it there is warrant.
This question is becoming more and
1 more one of prime importance, and un
less the courts will themselves deal with
it in effective manner, it is certain ulti
i mutely to demand some form of legisla
tive action. It would he most unfortu
: mite for our social welfare if we should
P nilit many honest and law-abiding
I citizens to feel that they had just cause
| for regarding our courts with hostility,
i 1 earnestly commend to the attention of
I the Congress lids matter, so that some
i way may he devised which will limit
tlie abuse of injunctions and protect
I those rights which from lime to time it
. unwarrantably invades. Moreover, dis
eonlent is often expressed with the use
of the process of injunction by the
courts, not only in labor disputes, but
where state laws are concerned. I re
frain from discussion of this question as
1 am informed that it will soon receive
the consideration of the supreme court
“The federal courts must of course de
cide ultimately what are the respective
| spheres of state and nation in connection
I will, any law, state or national, and
t he.v must decide definitely and tint! ■ in
matters affecting individual citizens, not
only as to the rights and wrongs of labor
but as to Hie rights and wrongs of capi
tal; and the national government must
always see that tie decision of the court
is put into effect. The process of injunc
tion is an essential adjunct of the courts
doing its work well and as preventive
incisures are always better than re
medial. the wise use of this process is
from every standpoint commendable
Rut where il is reeklesslv or unnecessar
ily used, the abuse should be censured,
above all by the very men who are prop
erly anxious to prevent any effort to
shear the courts of this necessary power.
The court’s decision must he final; the
protest is only against the conduct of
individual judges in needlessly anticipat
ing such final decision, or in the tyranni
cal use of whnl is nominally a temporary

MR. COOPER ATTACKS RULES.

WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 3.—Mr.
Cooper of Racine, Wis., Republican,
made a strong attack on the rules yester
day in the House of Representatives. He
declared without hesitation that under
the present rules the speaker had more
power than should he granted to any one
man in a Republican form of govern
ment. He gave an instance of what
happened to himself during the rule of
Speaker Henderson, now dead. The Wis
consin member had refused to support
something the speaker wanted and there
after Col. Henderson refused to allow
him unanimous consent for the most in
nocent bills demanded by the people of
his dicfrict, and made it a rule to fail
to see him on the tloor unless it was ab
solutely unavoidable.
After Mr. Dalzell said he could not
conceive of anything more unnecessary

TWENTY-FIVE DEAD
TAKEN FROM MINE-
Struggle with Renewed Energy Hoping
to Explore Balance of Entries
at Fayette City.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 3.—Twenty-five
of the miners caught by an explosion of
tiro damp Sunday night in tin. Naomi
mine of the United Coal company, located
nci.r layette City, had been reached by
the rescuers this morning. A!’, wi re dead
and charred almost beyond n cognition.
The resi nets are now nearing the end
of the workings and they have found no
bigii of liie anywhere. In the opinion of
the owners of the mine few if any more
victims will be found, but among miners
and others in the village there is a linn
belief that the total number of victims
is between forty and fifty.
After finding eleven bodies near the
twenty-ninth entry shortly before mid
night. the rescuers went to work with re
newed energy to explore the remaining
seven entries. There are thirty-six entries
in all, and innil the lust oi tin so has
been searched, the full extent of the dis
aster will not he known. Because of
the accumulation of gas, the work of
rescue in the remote sections of the
mine is greatly impeded.
A second explosion is a constant men
ace and everj precaution is being taken
to avert such a catastrophe.
Scores of frenzied women constantly
surround the pit mouth and tho special
detail of officers have much trouble in
keeping them from interfering with the
work of the rescuers.
The cause of the explosion has not yet
been ; scerlaiucd. One theory is that it
resulted from the explosion of black
damp in an unused entry when a miner
cairying an open lamp crossed the "dead
line.” Another is that a spark from the
trolly line over which cars are hauled
from the workings to the month of the
shaft ignited a pocket of gas in the mine.

INDIAN CO-ED PLANS
TO HELP HER RACE.
MADISON', Wis., Dec. 7. —[Special.] —
Believing that the conditions of caring
for the Indians on the Oneida reservation
by the government should be improved,
and inspired with a zeal that their fu
ture lies in education, Miss Laura M.
Cornelius, an Indian girl, whose home is
in Seymour, is at the university as a
junior, preparing for her life’s work.
"1 an. here at W isconsin to interest
the well known professors of sociology
at the university in the settlement of
the Oneida,” said Mi-s Cornelius, in dis
cussing her plans. "We need an agricul
tural experiment station, organization of
industry, and a township organization.
Our school system needs reorganization.
Our education of the children is being
reduced to institutionalism; the work
is not being done by real teachers. The
superintendents generally are not college
bred men, a condition which unfortunate
ly exists at most of the Indian reserva
tions.
Start with Oneidas.
“I intend to begin at the Oneida reser
vation, where 1 am the most familiar
with conditions, and what 1 accomplish
there 1 shall repeat wherever Indians
have land tenure. 1 am neither a mis
sionary nor a philanthropist. I like any
constructive work, and it because of this
fact, together with the feeling in mo
that I should advance the interests of
my people, that I have begun this task.
"The Indian reservation system is
rank to the core. People never can cx-
poet any civilization to come from it.
1 would reorganize them, not ns reser
vations. but as modified bodies politic,
a compromise between the reservation
and American citizenship. I would not
grant the Indians complete citizenship
because they must come -prepared to re
ceive it: otherwise they will lose what
they have.
Hopes for Dairy Farms.
“As for the organization of industry
which I consider the most essential, I
hope to see n great dairy industry built
up at the Oneida reservation Mud 1 ex
pect the co-operation of thr university
in my efforts to (irmly establish such an
industry.
“liy sending settlement workers
among the Indians, giving lantern slide
lectures on agriculture and dairy sub
jects and generally trying to interest
them in the better life, I believe that an
organization of industry may be effected
at the Oneida reservation in a short
time.
In Need of Money.
“The third step which 1 advocate to
improve conditions is the establishment
of local banks at each of the Indian
reservations, so that money may be
placed in circulation, as the Indian na
tions need money badly. My idea is
to secure the consent of the government
to have the principal of the Indian land
fund paid over to the banks. L'p to this
time only the interest on the fund has
been paid out. In this manner money
which might be used advantageously has
not been circulated.”
Miss Cornelius has completed two
years of work at Barnard college, the
women’s college of Columbia university
at New York, where a large portion of
her time was devoted to the study of
anthropology under the celebrated Dr.
Boaz. Before entering Barnard. Miss
Cornelius spent a semester at Leland
Stanford university, California. Her
preliminary education was receiver! at
Grafton hall, Fond dn Lac.

The Reason for Conversion.
‘The late Sir William Henry Perkin,

Philadelphia chemist, "had a singularly
lucid mind. I once heard him talking
about movement.
"Sir William had been for years a
warm supporter of this movement, and
bo praised it highly, but be condemned
certain phases of it, illustrating the phase
he meant by a quotation from a letter—a
letter written by the notable Capt. Da
vis to Secretary Walsingham about the
conversion of the Indians.
"The letter ran:
“ ‘lf these people (the Indians) were
once brought over to the Christian faith
they might soon be brought to relish a
more civilized kind of life, and be there
by induced to consume greater quanti
ties of our coarser woolen manufac
