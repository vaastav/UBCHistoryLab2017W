A large number of Republican officials
are now under indicthient for embezzling
Government money.
The Republicans, it is claimed, will have
a majority ot eighteen in tbe Indiana Legis
lature on joint ballot. The Senate is a tie.
Gesckal Garfield is likely to have
trouble with the colored brethren. They
demand a representative in hi Cabinet Let
Tinchback follow Schurz.
Qvitk a number of Republican papers
have had the manliness to confess that their
former criticisms of Governor Williams
were unfair and erroneous. .
The indications are that Republicans
want an extra session of Congress. Demo
crats will give President Garfield no reason
lor ordering the luxury, still it may be or
dered. The civilized world should make war
upon England and compel her to act justly
toward Ireland. The condition of tbe Irish
is said to be worse than that of any other
people in the world.
Mi Delmae estimates that $3,700,000,000
of silver and gold has been sent to China and
India since the middle of the sixteenth cen
tury, and that not more than one-tenth of it
has ever found its way back to Europe.
A Federal Judge in Mississippi has dis
missed the charge of fraud in the counting
of the votes in General Chalmer's Congres
sional District, but it is safe to bet that
Republicans will not cease their bowlings.
Oct of 1,98'J lives imperiled by various
disasters during the past year, 1,930 were
saved through the efforts ot the Life-Saving
Service. The total amount of proierty
saved by the same service amounts to
$2,619,800.
The Dead Letter Oince for the fiscal year
endiag June 30, received 3, 3ö3,G31 letters:
21,971 letters contained notes, checks and
drafts, with a face value of $1,520,217, and
27,000 letters contained money, amounting
to $1U,43S.
The estimated receipts from internal tax
ation for the last fiscal year amounted to
$115,000,000. The actual receipts amounted
to $123,082,000, an excess of $8.923,000.

The National Banks will urge upon Con
gress the great importance of reducing
taxes, in ao jar as relates to banking. They
represent th.t they are terri bly oppressed.and
it is further urged that taxing banks reacts
upon the business of, the country and is
therefore a fcreat calamity. It' s still fur
ther urged that the Government does not
need the r venue secured br taxing banks,
and can 'get along remarkably; well witbout
it Indeed, it is asserted that without the
$3,000,00 derived' from bank taxation the
Government can pay all expenses and re
duce the public' debt $100,000,000 a yeaf,
Such statements are made ' br rnn of high
characle'rj wiiv is j Vp faj4lViif f jtji
the subject of revenues. Tntj fact thai Ihi
Gevernment Is so well-to-do will likely'sug
gest to the minds 'of a good many people
that in reducing taxes the best place to
begin is not the banks. The people are
now enormously taxed to support National
Banks, and if the banks are required to re
fund some of the money, it is no inore than
right. Let us have fair play in 'inatters of
taxation. -7 .
It is expected that France will be obliged
to import nearly 70,000,000 bushel. Of wheat
for consumption during the pending winter,
and there is no doubt who will reap the ac
cruing benefit. The French can not get
what they want from Russia, as that Gov
ernment lias been compelled to place pro
hibitive restrictions upon the exportation
of breadstuff. They must, therefore, come
to us, and as nearly 500,000,000 bushels of
wheat were garnered in he United States
this year, we shall, no.doubt, be able to sup
ply their wants.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We lay before the readers of the Sentinel
this morning the. last annual message of
Rutherford B. Hayes, whose .occupancy of
the White House will cease March 4, 1WL
The document has no remarkable features;
it gives expression to no commanding
thoughts; it is a somnolent state paper; it
deals in platitudes; it is wanting in vigor,
and in all regards is characteristic of Ruth
erford B. Hayes. The message congratulates
the members of the Senate -and House of
Representatives "on the continued and in
creasing prosperity ot our country," and
credits "Divine Providence" with bestow
ing the ''blessings of health, abundant har
vests and profitable employment." The
message refers to the fact that the
Government of the United States is
at peace with all the Nations of
the earth. Mr. Hayes points with
special pride to the fact that the late Presi
dential eleciion passed off quietly. He be
lieves there is no necessity for a Solid North
or a Solid South, and that as soon as the
Fifteenth Amendment is obeyed, everything '
like the solidity of sections will disappear.
Mr. Hayes renews his recommendations
uj)on the subject of Civil Service Reform,
and urges legislation upon the subject with
considerate emphasis. As matters now
stand, Mr. Hayes is of the opinion that the
"stability of the Government" is in danger.
He wants Congress to enact a law establish
ing "fixed rules for the regulation of ap
jKIntment., promotions and removals, es
tablishing uniform methods, having ex
clusively in view in every instance,
the attainment of the best qualifica
tions for the position in question. It is
to , be hoped that Congress will at tince
proceed to give Mr. Hayes a law that will
meet with his approval. Mr. Hayes takes
stroiiKground against polygamy, and reconi
mends aggressive legislation against the
Mormons. He favors wiping out the pres
ent Territorial Government of Utah and the
establishment of a Government "analogous
to the provisional Government established
for the territory northwest of .the Ohio by
the ordinance of 1787." If that will not do,
then he recommends that the right to vote,
hold office and sit on juries in the Territory
of Utah be confined to those who neither
practice nor uphold polygamy. Aside froiu
these things, the message is devoid of special
interest, and is chiefly made up of a rehash
of Department reports. Mr. Hayes favors.
like John Sherman, a bigger silver dollar
ami the retirement of the greenbacks. He
mildly refers to the Monroe doctrine with
reference to the Darien Ship Canal. He
favors granting subsidies as a means of
extending the commerce of the country.
Such a policy would draw largely upon the
Federal Treasury, and whatever might be
the result in a commercial point of view, it
would largely benefit the private gentlemen
who iocketed the money. The subject of
education is touched upon, with a few flour
ishes of the pen designed to impress Con
gress with the importance of educating the
ignorant who reside in States where school
funds are not sufficient to meet the educa
tional demand. In such cases, Mr. Hayes
would draw on the Federal Treasury.
The message will create no excitement and
precious little interest anywhere, the only
recommendation calculated to create a
ripple on the smooth surface of political
puddles being that relating to Civil Service
Reform. In some regards the message is
suggestive of reflections. It is the last that
Mr. Hayes will issue. In lesa than three
months Mr. Hayes will retire from an
office to which he was elevated by means
which will grow in colossal repulsiveness
as the years roll on and in the future as
often as his name shall be mentioned it
will call up a record that no American citi
zen can contemplate without experiencing
a sense of deep humiliation. But Mr.
Hayes has made money by the operation,
and has managed, it is believed, to save at
least $150,000 of his salary, and to hand
somely reward out of the Federal Treasury
the men who contributed directly to enter
upon the the duties of an office which, by
the fiat of the American people, belonged to
another citizen.
THE INDIANA DEMOCRACY AND THE
LATE CANVASS.
Some of our friends abroad do not seem to
have formed a just estimate of the late con
test made by the Democracy of Indiana, ami
in this show - they have taken but a buper-
ficial view of the subject. It docs not fceetu
to have been understood abroad that the
Democracy have not had a majority in this
State since 1872,and then only on Governor by
some 1, 100 votes. They have had a pi urality
at several elections sine; 1S72, but never a
majority. During all this time the Green
backers held the balance of (tower, and con
trolled results, as they did, also, this fall, as
an examination . of the figures will show.
Our friends abroad deceived themselves in
counting as certain what the election re
turns of the iast eight years showed must be
uncertain. And, now, some of them make
the further mistake of supposing the result
In Indiana was owing to mistakes in the
State canvass; or thatsomeof the Democratic
candidates were found wanting. There never
was a more thorough or better canvass made
in the State than that of im, and the result
shows that the party ; Mood together as one
man both in October and November. In
October, 1676r the Democratic vote was 213,
219; In Novembertf the" same' Vearlt was
213.516. In October"' - 1&V 'U was, 224,452;
and in November. 18S0, it wasJ25.552..Tiise
A- " .-.'.- r ' '' ' - .
ngures shew' that' the Democrat Lava iiot
retrograded in the least in the last lour yct&
ycaxÄ
The increase of 1,070 between October and
November, 1$0, shows that' the gallant De
mocracy was not at all demoralized by the
defeat in October. The"s rote cast by the'
Greenback party at each election shows that
a larger portion of that party went to the
Republicans than to the Democrats, and
hence, the result this falL It is a mistake,
too, to suppose that the Democrats were not
properly supplied with money to make the
canvass. In point of fact, there was three
times as much money used by the Demo
crats in the canvass ot 10 as there was in
the canvass of 1876, or any previous canvass.
No, the Democrats of Indiana were not
defeated from any fault of their own, but
from causes entirel beyond their control.
They have suffered a temporary reverse,
but it is only a question of time when they
will again come into power.
THE GRAND ROLL-CALL OP 1880.
Leaving entirely out of consideration the
question of partisan iolitics, the success and
defeat of candidates and parties, there is
that connected with a Presidential
campaign and election in the
United States well calculated to excite
the pride of American citizens and to endear
to them the institutions of the country. On
the 2d day of November, 1SS0, more
tnan 9,000,000 freemen went to the polls
to name their chief rulers for four years from
the 4th of March, 1M1. Here and there were
irregularities and slight disturbances, but as
a general proposition citizens were every
where obedient to law, and as a result, in so
far as voting may be considered, the people
are satisfied. The result of the day's work
is shown by the following complete table,
which we take from the Chicago Tribune:
The total vote for President is 9,192,063,
which is divided as follows:

It will be observed that the Democratic
part3 though defeated, cast 4,43fi,0G0 votes,
and such figures at once set at rest all the
talk about disbanding the grand old party.
Upon that subject ex-Governor Hubbard
says that "a battle lost is not a war
ended; for no piestion is fast settled until it
is settled right. The Democratic party has
a history and a long career of achievements.
It is a old, well nigh, as the Republic. It
has witnessed the extinction of I know not
how many rivaT arties. It will live as
long as the Vepublic. It has sometimes been
defeated, but never conquered. It has gone
down into captivity, overborne sometimes
by numbers, sometimes by fraud; but it has
rcgathered its strengtli and reformed its
legions and come up again out oi its captiv
ity like a lion from the swellings of Jordan
It will do so again; do not for a moment
doubt it. The old guard dies, but never
surrenders. The Democratic party neither
dies nor surrenders."
WHO HAS THE BONDS?

From the foregoing tables "it will be seen
that the Eastern States own 17.9 per cent, of
the bonds; the Middle States, 01.4 per cent.;
the Western States, 11.2 per cent., and the
Southern States, .'5.5 per cent. In the Kast
ern States, 70 ier cent, of the bonds are
owned by the men, and IV) per cent, by the !
women. In the Middle States, M per cent,
are owned by the men. and l'J per cent, by
the women. In the Western States, M per
cent, are owned by the men, and V.) ier
cent by the women. In the Southern States,
7 per cent, are owned by the men, and 22
Ier cent, by women.'' Of all the vast wealth
represented in Government bonds, every
dollar is exempt from taxation. The toiling
men and women of the country pay the
favored few, who have withdrawn their
money from productive enterprises to live
off of the sweat of labor. 'The man or
woman who owns a farm or a factory pays;
the man who has his money in lxinds is
exempt; for it is held that a man who buys
bonds exhibits a iatriotic love of country
that those who cultivate farms and operate
machinery do not exhibit.
The buzzard luxury known as "oleo

hell broth is like turtle soup, still the Phila

and abroad. Two-thirds of theentire product
is sent to KurojH'. London, Liverpool and
Glasgow, are the principal markets. Italy
takes it in small quantities; China is begin
ning to like it, and India promises to he n
good market. South America is ordering
more liberally, and Holland is a large con

has set the example of exporting an

There were in the United States, accord
ing to the final count, 4l4-'3f,0'X) Democrats
who cast their votes for Hancock and Eng
lish, against 4,439,714 Republicans who cast
their voles for Garfield and Arthur; and
yet there are not a few fool Republicans who
talk as if lue Republican party isoverwhelm-
ingly in the majority, and that hereafter
Democrats will have little influence in po
litical affairs. The fact is the Republicans
have not a majority of the popular vote. As
stated, Garfield received 4,430,714 votes,
Hancock, 4,4360t50 votes and Weaver, 304,
852 votes. Hancock and Weaver received
4,740,912 311,108 more than Garfield. Such
figures ought to make the Republicans less
boastful.

Grecnbaekcrs and two Readjustee, making
the total of full membership of 203, of
which 147 is a majority. Three of the
Greenback Republicans elected in Missouri
arc understood to be pledged to vote with
the Republicans in the organization of the
House. It is said tliat the Grecnbaekcrs,
however, will run their candidate for
