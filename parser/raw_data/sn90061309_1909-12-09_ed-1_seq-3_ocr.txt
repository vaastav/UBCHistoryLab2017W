Late.
Yes, we are a little late this
week, but think we have done real
well, however, as a rush of job
work kept us from working on any
of the advertisements until about
noon Monday. Since that time we
have also done considerable job
work and you see what advertise
ments we carry. We appreciate
' the liberal patronage of the DeoDle.

The Message.
President Taft's communication
to congress is neither as long nor
as aggressive as the usual message
of his predecessor. It is not marked
by any daring phrases. There are
no sermons, stump speeches or epi
grams within its lines. It is like a
report of the committee on the
state of the country, and indeed
such it is. The president makes no
demands, and few suggestions to
congress. The document is a color
less state paper and indicates mere
ly good temper and a desire to
avoid stirring up the animals. It
will take more than that to make a .
dent in the hide of congress. Quin- i

Unexpectedly True. ,
The clever young man was wan- j
dering up and down the platform of
the railroad station, intent on find
ing an empty carriage in the ex-!
press which was almost due to 1
start. But in vain. Assuming an I
official air, he stalked up to the last j
carriage and cried in a stentorian i
voice:
"All change here! This carriage
isn't going?"
There were exclamations low but
deep, from the occupants of the
J crowded compartment; but, never
( theless, they hurried out of the car
nage and packed themselves away
in other parts of the train. The
smile on the face of the young man
was childlike as he settled himself
comfortably.
"Ah," he murmured, "it's a grand
thing for me that I was born clev
er! I wish they'd hurry up and
i start"
By and by the station master put
his head in the window, and said:
"I suppose you are the smart
young man who told the people
this carriage wasn't going?"
"Yes," said the clever one, and
he smiled.
"Well." said the station master,
with a grin, "it isn't The porter
hear! you telling the people, and so
he uncoupled it. He thought you
were a director!" -Tit-Bits.
Miss Lewis Entertains.
Monday evening was about a3
nasty as it ever gets to be in Mis
souri, but some twenty guests were
not daunted by it for they knew
that to be a guest of Miss Mayme
Lewis was an assurance of a very
pleasant evening.
It was a gathering of congenial
spirits. Flinch, frequently referred
to os "Ministerial Euchre," was the
progressive game and next to the
refreshments the delight of the
evening.
