and evidence was secured to make

And now cornea the record evidences

A HEAVY BURDEN.
“Rather a heavy burden, isn’t it rny
boy?”
Clarence Spencer, to whom the words
had been addressed, turned from the
ledger and looked towards the speaker.
Clarence was a young man—not more
than twenty-five—and he was book
keeper to Solomon VVardle, a n'easant
faced, keen-eyed man of fifty, who had
spoken.
‘,A heavy burden, isn’t it, Clarence?’’
the merchant repeated.
And still the young man was silent.
His Jooks indicated that he did not com
prehend. He had been for some time
Pending over the ledger, with his
ihoughlsfar away; and that his thoughts
were not pleasant ones, was evident
enough from the gloom on his hand
some face.
"My dear hoy, the burden is not only
heavy now, hut it will grow heavier and
heavier the longer you carry it.”
"Mr. VVardle,! do not comprehend
you.”
"Ah, Clarence!”
“I certainly do not.”
"Didn’t I call at your house for you
this morning?”
Clarence nodded assent.
“And didn’t J see and heat enough to
reveal to me the burden you took with
you when you lufi! You must re
member, my boy, that I am older than
you are, and that I have been through
the mill. You find your burden heavy,
and I’ve no doubt that Sarah's heart is
as heavily laden as your own.”
And then Clarence Spencer under
stood; and the morning’s scene was
present with him, as it had been pres
ent with him since leaving home. On
that morning ho had a dispute with his
wile. It had occurred at the breakfast
table. There is no need of reproduc
ing the scene. Suliice it to say that it
hud come of a mere nothing, and lied
grown a cause of anger. ’The first hail
been a look and tone; then a flash of
impatience; then a raising of the voice;
then another look; the voice grew high
er; the reason was unhinged; passion
gamed sway, and the twain lost sight of
the warm, endearing love that lay smit
ten and aching down deep in their
hearts, and felt (or the time only the
passing tornado. And Clarence re
memben and that Mr. VVardle had entereil
the house and caught a sight of the
storm.
Anil rilarcnco Spencer thought of one
thing more; he thought how miserable
he had been all the morning; ami he
knew net how long his buruen of un
happiness was to be borne.
" Honestly, Clarence, isn’t it a heavy
and thankless burden?”
The book-keeper knew that his em
ployer was his Irienii and that he was a
true-hearted Christian man; and alter a
pause, he answernl: “ Yes, Mr, Wardle,
it is a heavy burden.”
“ My boy, 1 am going to venture upon
a bit of fatherly counsel, I hope I shall
not offend.”
“ Not at all,” said Clarence. He winc
ed a little, us though the probing gave
him new pain,
“ lu the first place,” pursued the old
man, with a quiver of emotion in his
voice, “you love your wife?”
“Love her? Yes, passionately.”
“ And do you think she loves you in
return ?’’
“1 don’t think anything about it—l
know!”
“ You know she loves you?”
Yes.”
“Then you must admit that the
trouble of this morning came from no
ill feeling at heart?”
“Of course nut.”
“ it was but a surface-squall, for which
you, at least, are very sorry ?”
A moment’s hesitation, and then —
“ Yes, yes; I am heartily sorry.”
“ Now murk me, Clarence, and an
swer honestly; Don’t you think your
wife is as sorry us you are?”
“ 1 cannot doubt it.”
“ And don’t y >u think she is sull'oring
till this tune ?”
“ Yes.”
“Very well. Let that pass. You
know that she is hearing part of the
burden? ’
“Yes, 1 know that."
“And now, my hoy, do you compre
hend where (lie heaviest part of this
burden is lodged ?”
Clarence looked upon his interlocutor
womlerlngly.
“If the storm had all blown over,
and you knew that the sum would shine
when you next entered your home, you
would not feel so unhappy!"
Clarence assented.
“But,” continued Mr. Wardle, “you
tear that there will he glcom in your
home when you return?”
The young man bowed his head as ho
replied in me atlirmative.
"Because," the merchant added, with
a touch of parental sterinss in his
tone, “you are resolved to carry it
there!”
Clarence looked up in surprise.
‘‘l—L carry it?" ‘
“Aye; you have the burden in your
heart, and you mean to carry it home.
Remember, my hoy, I have been there,
and know all about it. I have been
very foolish in my lifetime, and I have
suffered, until I discovered my folly,
and then L resolved that 1 would suffer
no more. Upon looking the mutter
-ipiarely and honestly in the face, 1
found that the burdens which had so
galled me had been self-imposed, t)
course such burdens can be thrown oil
Now you have resolved you will go to
dinner with a heavy heart and a dark
lace. You have no hope that your wife
will meet you with a smile. And why?
Because you know that she has no par
ticular cause for smiling. You know
that her heart is burdened with the af
tbetion which gives yon so much unrest.
And you arc fully assnrul that you are
to find your home shrouded in gloom.
And, furthermore, von don’t know when
that gloom will depart and when the
blessed sunshine of love will burst in
again. And why don’t you know ? Be
cause it is not now in your heart to
sweep the cold away. You say to your
self, T can bear it as long as she can!’
Am I not richt ?”
Clarence did not answer in words.
“ I know 1 am right," pursued the
merchant; “and very likely your wife
is saying to herself the same thing. So
Clarence, you sec it does not reel upon
the willingness to forgive, but upon the
inability to bear the burden. Bv-and
by it will happen, as it has happened
before, that one of the twain will sur
render from exhaustion; and it will be
likely to be the weaker party. Thou
there will he a collapse, and a reconcili
ation. Generally the wife falls first be
neath the galling burden, because her
love is keenest and most sen-hive. Toe
husband in such case, acts the part of a
coward. When he might,with a breach,
blow the cloud away, he cringes and
cowers until his wi e is forced to let
th3 sunlight in through her breaking
heart •’
Clarence listened, and was troubled.
He saw the truth, felt its weight. He
was not a tool, nor was he a liar. During
the silence that followed he reflected
upon the past, and he called to his mind
scenes such as Mr.Wardlu Had depicted.
And this brought him to the rememb
rance of how lie had seen his wife weep
when she had failed and sank beneath
the heavy burden, how often she had
sobbed upon his bosom in grief fur her
ermr.
The merchant read the young man’s
thoughts, and after a time he rose and
touched turn upon the atm.
“ Clarence, suppose you were to put
on your hat and go home now. Suppose
you should think, on your way, only of
the love and blessing that might be
with this thought, you should enter your
abode with a smile upon your face; and
you should put your arms around your
wife’s neck, and kiss her, and soltly say
to her, “ My darling, I have come home
to throw down the burden I took away
with me tnis morning. It is greater
than T can bear. Suppose you were to
do this, would your wife repulse you?”
"Repulse me?”
“Ah, rny boy, you echo my worci..
with an amazement which shows that
you understand me. Now, sir have yon
1 tie courage to try the experiment?
Dare you be so much of a man? Or do
you fear to let your dear wife know
how much you love her? Do you fear
she would respect and esteem you less
for the deed? Tell me —dojyuu think the
cloud of unhappiness might thus be
banished? On, Clarence, if you would
but try it!”
Sarah Spencer bad finished her work
in the kitchen, and in the bed chamber
and sat down with her work in her lap.
But she could not ply her needle. Her
heart was heavy and sail, aud tears were
'lll her eyes.
I’iesently she hoard the front door
open, mid a step in the passage Certain
ly she knew that step! Yes her husband
entered and a smile upon his face. Slie
saw it through her gathering tears, mid
her heavy heart leaped up. He came
and put his arms around her neck, ana
kissed her; and said to her in broken
accents, "Darling, I have come home
to throw down the burden I took away
with me this morning. It is greater
than I can bear.”
Ami she trying to speak, pillowed her
head upon his bosom and sobbed and
wept like a child. Oh! could he forgive
her? His conning with the blessed offer
ing bad thrown the burden of reproach
hack upon herself. She saw him noble
and generous, and she worshiped him.
But Clarence would not allow her to
take all the blame; he must share that.
"Wo will share it so evenly,” said he,
that its weight shall he felt no more.
And now, my darling, we will be hap
py !”
“Always!”
Mr. VVardle had no need, when Clar
ence returned to the counting-house, to
ask the result. He could read it in the
young man’s brimming eyes, and in the
joy-inspired face.
It was a year after this —mid Clarence
Spencer had become a partner in the
house—that Mr. VVardle, by accident,
referred to the events of that gloomy
morning.
“Aii!” said Clarence, with a swelling
bosom, “that was the most blessed les
son 1 over received. My wife knows
who gave it to me.”
“And it serves you yet, my boy?"
“Aye, and it will serve us while we
live. We have none of those old bur
dens of auger to bear now. They can
not find lodgment with us. The 11 ish
and jar may come as in the other days
—for we are human you know—but the
heart, which has (irmly resolved not to
give an abiding place to the ill feeling,
will not bo called upon to entertain it.
Sometimes we are foolish, but wo laugh
at our folly when we see it, and throw
it oil'; we do not nurse it till it becomes
a burden.
The Athenian journals give interest
ing accounts of the results ol the latest
census of the Greek kingdom. In 1870
the population amounted to 1,457,894:
in 1879 it has risen to 1 070.775- At the
very first census of the liberated Greek
population, taken in 1838, the free
Greek people were only 850,000 .n num
ber. Hence half a century of deliver
ance from that Turkish rule whose
blessings the lories are so eager to pro
serve intact for the uufreed Greeks and
slaves has resulted in a doubling ot the
free Greek population. The city of
Athens, which reckoned 48 000 inhabit
ants in 1870, now boasts ot 74,000, while
the Tineas, which had only 11,000 in
1870, has more than doubled that num
ber during the last nine years.

The Condition of lot-laud.
London Time*.
In 1874 the king of Denmark restored
local self-government to Iceland, and
in that year, for the first time in nearlv
a century, its own parliament aat and
made its own laws. Iceland had been
degenerating rapidly. Its people were
leaving it in large number.*, and witn
them its industries were disappearing.
Since then, however, a great change is
noted in both the material and moral
development of the country. It is
noted by a correspondent that “the
finances of the island have been so ad
ministered that there is a considerable
surplus revenue. R iiuls, in which Ice
land was peculiarly deficient, have
been opened to all the mure important
districts, and are rapidly extending. Up
to the present time the country has
been without bridges, but two are
planned and will soon be constructed.
The income from the ii-heries has been
increased by the establishment of fish
oil factories at several points on the
coast. Agricultural and pastoral in
terests have been promoted by sending
Icelanders to the continent of Europe,
at the national expense, there to slimy
die most improved methods of farm
ing. At Reykjavik a light-house has
been built, and so nearly paid for by
port dues that the latter have been re
duced just one-half. Increased com
mercial facilities have been secured by
providing for the circumnavigation of
the island by the steamer* from Den
mark twice every summer. Fifteen
ports are visited on this voyage. The
tonnage duty on foreign vessels is
abolished. From Russia there is in
an increased demand for the eider
down of Iceland, and from England for
Icelandic ponies and salmon.” It has
become the legal duty of every minister
to see that every child in his parish is
taught writing and arithmetic. Schools
of law, agriculture and technology have
been established, the national library
has been growing, and the arts are
flourishing. All this improvement is
attributed to home government.
Mr. Moody's Views.
Cleveland Htrulil : The evangelist was
sitting in his room at the Forest City
House, at a table covered with letters
and papers, when the Htrnhl represen
tative entered.—Speaking of the infidel
ity of to day, he alluded to the strong
hold which spiritualism iiad obtained
in Cleveland. He said:
“1 cannot understand the facination
this unhealthy and unholy religion has
for people, it strikes at the very root
of civilization and threatens the very ex
istence of society. It is a religion whose
four corner stones are infidelity, super
stition, sexual lasciviousness and mor
bid insanity, ”
“ Have you ever argued with any
member of the sect ? ”
“ Oh, yes, dozen of times; I have had
interviews with celebrated mediums,
and one asked me if I would like to see
my father and talk to him. 1 told him
I should like to very much hut that 1
would wait tdl I got to Heaven.
“ What is your exact point of belief
with regard to future punishment?”
“I don't believe in a material hell of
brimstone. I believe conscience will
l>e a sufficient punishment. Tosit alone
and face the record of one’s past sinful
life, to feel the burden of guilt upon us
eternally, will be sufficient.”
“ What, is your opinion of R jbcrt
Ingersoll?”
'• lie is a clever man, hut he is all
wrong. He turns his back on Christian
ity, and then rails at it as a falsehood.
He tries to gauge the actions of God by
the intellect of man, and 1 do not won
der at his unbelief. Ido not condemn
him; his unbelief is probably honest, but
from my heart I pity him. ”
V (!oil or lho Philistines.
Pall Mull Gazette.
An interesting arct at (logical discovery
is reported from Palestine. An Aral)
who was quairying stone the other day
at a place about (our and a half miles
from Gaza, unearthed a marble figure
snppoie.t to lie a colossal god ot the
Philistines. The dimensions of the
figure are as follows: Three feet from
the top of its head to the end of its
beard; 27 inches from ear to ear; 13]
inches from top of forehead to mouth:
54 inches from shoulder to shoulder: 31
inches from crown of head to waist;
and 54 inches the circumference of the
neck. The total height of the figure is
fifteen feet. The hair hangs in long
ringlets down the shoulders, and the
beard is long, indicating a man of ven
erable age. The right arm is broken in
half, while the loft arm is crossed over
the breast to the right shoulder, where
the hand is hidden by the drapery of a
cloth covering the shoulders. There is
no inscription on the figure of the pe
destal, which is a huge block carved in
one piece with tiie figure. The statue
was found in a recumbent position, bur
ied in the sand upon the .top of a hill
near the sea. It had evidently been re
moved from its original site, which is
unknown, its estimated weight is 12,-
tKXI pounds. The Pasha of Jerusalem
has ordered a guard to watch this relic
of ancient art and prevent an injury to
it by the fanatics of Gazi.
Irish Trading.
Some time ago, an Irish laborer on
the spree went into Pie shop of a coun
tryman in Perth, and offered his hat for
a shilling, that he might just have an
other “noggin cf tiie craythur, ” and
wash up for work again. The demand
was not great, certainly lint poor Pady’s
nat was no better than those of the ma
jority of his countrymen in like circum
stances, and he was at once flatly refus
ed. A customer in quest of something
having called the shop-keeper to the
door, Pat then addressed the mistress
with:
“shore, now, I think he might have
given me a shilling for that, mem.”
She thought so loo; and paying him
the sum sought, be was off m a twink
ling.
Elated with her bargain, she reproach
ed her lord for his short-sightedness,
when, to her horror, he exclaimed:
" Why woman you’ve Might my own
hat!”
Her confusion may be mors easily
guessed than expressed. l’>t perceiv
ng the shop-keeper’s hat lying in a win
dow, slyly substituted his own for for it,
and actually palmed upon die wife the
nat of her own husband.
