HenryDavis, alias Sluddart, w ho is now^in the Jersey City jail awaiting trial for
theforgery ol u telegraphic order on the^Piltalleld iNilik of Massa. liiiseits. ia prob^^ahlv the most clever.daring ami ingenious^forger on ni'ord. A New York corre^^spondent relates that Davis ittheonly man^w ho ever, h iving been sent to prison for^lorgery. forged bis way out again. The^mi ans by which he nunc to lie pardoned^by Governor Buchanan of Telinesiv. e re-^vculs a skill and audacity unsurpassed in^criminal annals.
Daviswas arrested in Memphis. Tenn..on^several charges of forgerv. the cheeks^which he hail written and pnsstal having^i lai-ii honored hy a number of hunks and^nu l l unlilo houses. His skill was excep^^tional, and every- one of the checks had^Is en paid without suspicion, the signatures^Is ing marvelous in exeeutlon. His trial^was made sensational through a number^of letters from rcs|Hftablc people, some^of thein well-known. which lie osrsrstd or^exhibited in his own behalf, all of them.^Ultimately turning out m Is- lingeries.
Theresult of his trial was a sentence of^III years in the state penitentiary. Davis'^attorney vvm kitl hanl for him and made^strenuous efforts to save him from the^added punishment of hard lalH^r. lie did^not succeed, howi vcr, and the prisoner^was sent to'1'raee.v. While he was there^Gov ernor Buchanan received a iietition^for Davis'pardon. It was ais'oin|wiiiied^bv a letter from Mr. liabtist. Davis' attor^^ney, which was most ingeniously con^^structed and puthciieallv written.
TheiH titioii was suIuhtUmxI to by all the^otfieials of the court ill w hich Dav is w as^tried, Hm cut iix- jury who found him guilty,^ami a large number til citizens from Tcn-^uessts^, among them being many inthiential^men who were intimate friends of Gov^^ernor Buchanan. It was so ingenious and^s.v iiipailn lie thai the governor, who very^rarely grants a pardon without consulta^^tion w ith sonic of the signers, believed^such a course to be unnecessary'. Be there^^fore issued a pa ii Ion. and Davis was sot at^lila rty. The gov ernor had him brought to^Na-hville and |s'iMinallv presented him^willi a new suit of i lot lies ami a sum of
nioiiev.Dav is then disappeared.
Twow eeks alter the gov ernor met Mr.^Babfist, Davis' attorney, and congratu^^lated him on Ihe success of his clfoils.^liabtist With amazed, and could not under^^stand what he mount. His excellency^I ban -jaikc of the pa 11 Ion. and found that^Babtial knew iioiluug about il. livery^name and every letter were ban-faced^forgeries, and the entire petition had been^Written by Davis himself while in prison.^How he managed the work is not known,^from that time nothing was heard of^Dav is until the Pitlsfleld bank forgery^came out and Snaldai't was arrested. An^ollieer found St.ahlaH ami Davis lo lie one^and the same, and so the whole story has^MM to light,
