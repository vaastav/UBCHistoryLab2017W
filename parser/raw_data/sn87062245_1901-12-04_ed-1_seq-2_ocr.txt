the largest and most attentive gathering
of auditors ever present during the recital
of tho contents of a document from a
Chief executive Tho deepest interest
was shown in the various subjects treat
ed and the long statement was followed
word for word by the members of the
upper body who were supplied with copies
as soon as the seal had been broken
on the original package delivered by Ma
jor Prudcn Just after the reading of the
Journal of the previous day s proceedings
Both Democrat and Republicans Join
ed In the statement that the mestagc wa3
the rtroagest and best sent to Congre3S
in many sears Even the old followers
of the trusts claimed to be unable to find
fault wii the document Spectators and
EtaVfmen alike sat spellbound for mjre

rang out thiough the Senate The warn
Ingi and suggestion- x iro more than
mere words They seemed clothed with
the enercy of the hand which had penned
them anrJ the brain which had given them
tirth
Jennie Chamber Crowded
Despite ihc Inclement leather there wju
a large gathering present in the chamber
when the cleric took up the mes
sage which covered forty six pages and
required changes of cxprcsslan The old
dronlngmonotone cf other days could not
very well be applied to this message
There was too much cf life and action In
it There were a surprisingly large num
ber of women present while the public
galletles were packed with men
In opering the labors of the day the
clirlaln asked a blessing on tho Presi
dent for whoe first ofBlil utte ance the
Stnalr was wilting and prayed that he
might be preserved from accident vio
lence and disease

the first time omitting the words in
writing The message was brought to

Probably no Senators took more Interest
in the message than Messrs PJatt of Nsw
York Lodge of Massachusetts and Morgan
of Alabama Mr Piatt devoured every
word of the document long btforo the
clerk had concluded and seemed to enjoy
the strong terms In hicli the Presidents
message was couched
Senator Lodge lying back In his chair
underscored paseagos with a pen and
pointed them out to Senator Hanna who
sat behind him The latter seemed to
have learned the message by heart be
forehand as he did not refer to his copy
but punctuated paragraphs with fsoleiri
nods of his massive head and chin Sen
ator Morgan listened to the clerk until a
powerful passage was read when tho old
statesman would turn back to the item
In question and read It for his own sat
isfaction
Mt evcn Scnntorn PrcKcnt
Torty Republican Senators sat through
tho reading of tho message while twenty-seven
Democratic Senators remained

An AiIy entnrouM VojnKf
The Roanoke had an adventurous pas

be leaking She was then oft Cape Horn
and met some hard weather The crew-
were set at work at the rumps and a wind
mill vas rigged to help keep the water
out of the hold On November 2 a second
danger appeared when the essel was
found to be on fire
After that water was allowed to rise to
over four rcet In the hold and remain at
that lcel to assist fn fighting the fire
First Mate Moxcn went down into the
hold to locate the fire at tho risk ot his
life Though seeral times nearly over

Then it was determined to acli Hono

PROTEST AGAINST EXTRA WORK
A Comiilnlnt fo ConiiiiiMloners Prom
Central Lilhor Llilun
The Central Labor Union has entered a
protest against the District Commission
ers permitting work overtime and on Sun
days on the M Street sewer Secretary
Dietrich In addressing the Commission
ers on the subject says that the practice
of contractors Tor public work has been
of late to Invoke the emergency clause
upon the slightest pretext In order that
they may rush through their work To
make sure of being on the safe side Mr
Dietrich says the contractors appeal to
the Board of Commissioners and rcelve
from them an official permission
Mr Dietrich expressis the belief that If
the Commissioners would study the law
they would find that the purpose of the
statute is not to aid tho contractor in fin
ishing his contract but that It Is to pro
tect the workman so that hla emplojer
may not compel him to work longr r than
eight hours a day Mr Dietrich suggests
that if the contractor is anxious to com
plete his contract ho could employ two or
three shifts of men working them eight
hours each and thus keep within tho law
The question of working overtime raised
in Mr Dietrichs letter lias been the sub
ject of a report from David H McComb
Superintendent of Sewers Ie says that
the sewer Is being constructs In a tun
nel and that It sometimes h vpens that
tin niasoniy In the heading cannot be ful
ly completed within the ordinary work
ing hours Mr McCcmb says tbat it is
important for the protection of the work
partly completed and to avoid a possi
bility of injuring adjacent buildings and
other structures that work should proceed
until the construction Is fully completed
Mr McComb states that these were his
reasons for recommending the overtime
work in the first place and that the con
ditions still exist Mr McComb further
stati s that the contractor was grnnted
permission to work ovcrtlcui only so long
as the engineer In charge should deem it
necessary for the best Interest of the
work
