IAZING SCANDAL
IN NAYAt ACADEMY
Jummary Dismissal of Two Cadets
Is Recommended by the
Superintendent.
ffOVE IN CONGRESS
FOR AN INVESTIGATION
diddies Are Said to Continue For
bidden Hazing as of
Old.
Washington, Dec. 14.Secretary Bo
taparte has received the report of
tear Admiral Sands, superintendent of
he naval academy at Annapolis, upon
-he hazing of Midshipman Jerome Kim
rough.
The superintendent recommends the
ummary dismissal of Midshipman Tre
lore Coffin, Jr., of the third class, and
Iidshipman Warren A. Vanderveer of
he second class, Coffin for hazing and
fanderveer for failing to report it. The
ecretary has the report under consid
ration.
Move for Inquiry.
A resolution providing for a thoro
nvestigation of the situation and con
ltions at the naval academy was in
roduced today by Eepresentative Loud
Mzchigaii The investigation is to
made by the house naval committee,
vhich is especially instructed to'/ascer-
am and report whether violations of
he law and the regulations governing
he academy continue, and whether haz
ng, fagging, running and class fist
ghting continue practice there, and
he knowledge of and responsibility of
he officers of the academy foi any
onditions found to exist."
The resolution empowers the commit
eo to act thru a subcommittee if
leemed advisable, which may sit at
he capitol or at the naval academy.
Annapolis, Md., Dec. 14.A case of
azing of an extremely indiscreet and
ratal nature has been discovered at
he naval academy, notwithstanding
he sworn testimony of midshipmen
witnesses before the Meriwether couit
lartial recently that the practice did
ot exist at the academy. The affair
ook place Tuesday night, and the vie
im, Midshipman Jerome Jt^Kimbough,
a found his room an an uncon
cious condition, which had been m
uced by being compelled by upper
lassmen to repeatedly stand on his
ead. The affair was discovered by the
fficer in charge of the building and
.^-nmediately reported to the authorities.
Admiral Sands, superintendent of the
cademy, ordered the affair to be in
estigated by a board of officers. Their
eport was made to him and it was
ound that Midshipman Trenmor Cof-
n, Jr., of the third class, had been
azing which they gave to Admiral
'.ronson, the previous superintendent,
he only forai was "running," which
lie midshipmen differentiated from
azing. Now, however, the midship
len have gone back to hazing in its
""lost virulent form.
The particular method used is the
ompulsion of long-continued exercises,
roducing extreme fatigue and most
angerous in fheir tendencies and fre
uent results.
It has been learned that young Kim
ought was compelled tov

practically caught in th act how
ver, and Vanderveer, who is from
-*Iount Holly, N. J., was on duty
ach a position that he must have been
ware of the proceedings.
Another Queer Case.
In connection with the condition of
vimbough there is much speculation as
3 the origin of a paralysis which at
icked Midshipman Henry C. Cooper of
'xford, N. C, shortly after 2 o'clock

he v*as closely examined as to any

is condition. He stoutly denied that
had been hazed recently, but was not
~*ble to give any other explanation
'hich would account for the attack,
oung Cooper is now much better, and
is complete recovery is confidently ex
ected.
The affair has also brought to light
hat -|ust after the Meriwether court
tartial, Admiral Sands appointed an
lvestigating board to look into every
cademy custom which was contrary
~-+i thfe regulations of laws of the United
tates. It was composed of Lieutenant
ommanders Decker, Taurell, Wiley and
IcVey, all attached to the department
discipline of the academy. Kim
ough was before this board some days
go and was compelled to tell some
lings which offended the upperclass
len. His brutal hazing was evidently
a this account. It could not be learned
._. hether or nor Cooper was before this
oard. This board will be in session
or several weeks.
TEMPTS DEATH IN
AIRSHIP RUNAWAY
Journal Special Service.
Chicago, Dec. 14.With the daring
of a man who faces death for the mere
excitement of it, Horace B. Wild, 32
years old, yesterday afternoon, foi the
first time in his life made a flight in
an airship. He soared to a height
o.f
2,500 feet above the ground.
After a series of thrilling experi

three miles from where he started on

Hundreds of people filled the streets to
see the navigator in his flight.
The trip thru the air at the dizzy
height of half a mile was made under
difficulties and Wild several times
thought it was his end.
In Peril from Cold.
His greatest peril was the danger of
losing his hold on the machine on ac
count of the cold. Twice his numb
fingers slipped from their grasp of the
frame of the ship and twice he caught
himself by hooking his heels into a
groove the crossbeams. This was at
the maximum height.
The start was made at 4:30 p.m. at

ney came thirty minutes later in the
gloom of the December evening.
For a time all went well, the diri
gible machine moving to the south
smoothly. Then came trouble. Wild
suddenly realized that the engine oper
ating the propeller had stopped because
the supply of gasolene was exhausted.
With that came to the airship man the
realization that he was going higher
and higher and had no means of pro
pelling the ship in the direction of the
Gnawed at the Knot.
Far above his head was the valve
of the great bag tied together with a
heavy rope. The navigator was un
able to untie the knot because of the
numbness his hands and the danger
of falling, should he attempt it. Me
thought of the days when he was
lad and bit knots with bis teeth. He
would try it this time. Then, holding
to the ship by the net above his head,
his feet swinging free above the frame
work, he-bit away at the rope to let
the gas out.
It was daTk by this time and the cold
was increasing. Several times in suc
cession ho tugged at the kn'ot and it
finally gave way. The gas rushed out
with such great force that it stunned
the young man and he fell upon the
frame exhausted, while the ship tumbled
toward the ground at a fearful rate.
Expected a Tragedy.

quick enough to prevent its nose from

efused to divulge the names of his

Almost Unconscious.
The machine was being carried with
the wind an'd he was unable to effect a

Finally, at Eighty-second street and
Madison avenue, he managed to drop

in the air for crowds nearby to catch it.
He finally released some more gas and
the machine dropped with a thud, the
wind bouWeing it over the ground.
Thousands of people thought Wild.

women and boys tried to grasp the trail

of the ship. He was not hurt beyond a
severe shaking up.
The airship is a Chicago production.
It is seventy feet long from tip to tip,

United States Attorney General
Moody's order was received by the fed

morning calling upon the Minnesota of
fice to make an investigation of all vio
lations in this district of the Elkins
law.
J. M. Dickey of Minneapolis, first as
sistant district attorney, was seen to
day as to what action would be taken
and said:
"At present our office is busily en
gaged with a term of court. Mr.
Moody's order is a new thing to us,
and naturally we desire to consider its
terms and the existing situation before
we proceed. It probably will be well
into next week before the# present
pressing business in court will permit
us to give the subiect consideration.

"What will that action be? Sub
mitting to the next grand jury
all violations of the law which are
brought to our attention or which by
our own work, can be unearthed. Sueh
prosecutions under the terms of the
Elkins law, would include actions
against the shipper a"s well as against
the railroad giving the rebate."
Mr. Dickey was asked if there would
be any investigation of the methods of
the express companies replied that
this could not be decided now, one
way or the other. In response to a
question as to whether there had not
already been some complaints brought
to the district attorney's attention of
violations of the Elkins law, he said he
did not care to state.

Copper Confounds the Boston
Man and Fulfills System's
Prophecies.
Journal Special Service.
New York, Dec. 14.Amalgamated
Copper, spite of the dire prophecies
of Thomas W. Lawson, crossed par yes
terday for the first time in four years.
Five years ago, in the great boom, it
sold up to 130. In 1903 it sold at 33%.
its lowest price. Yesterday it touched
100%, verifying, so^far, the prediction
made ten days agb by Standard Oil
men, that it would cross par before
Christmas and sell at 110 before Jan.
1. Anaconda sold up to 196, Today
Amalgamated Copper hovered around
par.
The scene around the Copper post was
one of the most exciting that has been
witnessed on the Stock exchange since
the great boom of 1900. Many wild
rumors were in circulation. It was said
that Thomas W. Lawson had been
caught heavily short and that the
Standard Oil interests, led by H. H.
Rogers, were punishing him for his per
sonal attacks upon them and upon the
property. Stock brokers who have in
the past executed orders for Mr. Law
son were heavy buyers of the stock,
but the rumor could not be traced to
any authentic source.
Mr. Lawson repeatedly said over his
signature that Amalgamated Copper
was intrinsically worth only about $30
a share when the stock was selling at
$60 a share pTedicted _a break, of
30 points. He also said that the cop
per metal would break 3 or 4 cents a
pound and cause one of the
most disastrous panics that the
market has ever known. At
that time copper metal was selling
at about 17 cents a pound. It has since
steadily advanced to the present record
breaking prices, while Amalgamated
Copper stock has advanced 40 points.

Journal Special Service.
Washington, De*c. 34.It is practical
ly agreed upon in the house that con
gress has no authority whatever to in

Scores of bills providing for federal

house. Undfcr ordinary circumstances
they would all go to the committee on

involved.
It has been decided by Speaker Can

ffiH0ffi4fe^?|^^
The power congress has is solely in re
gard to taxation and in that regard it
is practically unlimited. Following the
analogy of the oleomargarin cases, it
has been decided that any attempt by
congress to regulate the business of life
insurance necessarily must come thru
the taxing power of the national govern
ment and not thru the power granted, to
congress to regulate
merce.
As a result of this decision the recom
looking into an inquiry into the power
of the government over the insurance
business has been referred to the com*
mittee on ways and means.
To 'Ways and Means.''
Later on, if the multitude of bills on
this subject seem to be worthy of it,
they possibly may be referred to the
committee on judiciary to determine the
legal points involved.
In the meantime, all insurnace legis
lation submitted to the house will be
referred to the committee on ways and
means on the theory that the federal
government has no power to reach the
insurance companies except thru the ex
ercise of its right to tax them for pure

delegates were present when John
came into the hard coal field in 1900
with the avowed purpose of duplicating
the organization in western Pennsyl
vania and the western states which
held contracts with the bituminous
coal operators.
President Mitchell is desirous of hav
ing the convention adjourn by Saturday
night. The delegates may take a longer 'the company was was first made. They
time, however, to formulate the requests adopted rejblutions late yesterds^, for
or demands to be made upon the opera
tors as a substitute for the Strike com
mission's award, which will expire with
the month of March.
The miners' leaders plan thru the con
vention to request a conference of the
operators. This will be^made in the
form of a .resolution, and the follow
ing demands, it is said, will be made if
the conference is granted:
A party agreement, better known as
recognition of the union.
An eight-hour workday.
An increase in pay to all classes of
employees of at least 10 per cent, and,
possibly 20 per cent, based on the
wages in effect April 1, 1902.
This would mean that the miners
would receive about the same as under
the present award. Eor some unskilled
employees it would mean a slight in
crease.
Should the operators be disposed to
grant the miners a conference, their in
tention will be known tomorrow to Mr.
Mitchell. In the event of a favorable
reply coming from the operators, the
convention will be in a position to make
up its listi=f of demands and grievances
and to vote tojthe executive board, or
to Mr. Mitchell and the three district
presidents, the power not only to enter
into negotiations, but to make terms
for the miners for a short term.
