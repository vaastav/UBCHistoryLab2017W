. Washington, Dec. 10. The senate
chamber was the scene of a highly
dramatic episode yesterday when Sen
ator Tillman of South Carolina chal
lenged his colleague. Senator McLau
rin, to resign with him on the spot In
Order, to use his own language, that
they might be able "to wash their
dirty linen at home." McLaurln did
not take up the gauge. The Incident
was the direct sequel of the very bit
ter controversy which arose between
the senators in South Carolina last
spring. Mr. McLaurln arose to a ques
tion of personal privilege and pro
ceeded to explain what he charged
was a conspiracy to discredit him in
his own state for acts and views which
did not meet the approval of certain
democratic leaders. He declared that
he was being humiliated, and accord
ing to public prints, was to be exclud
ed from the democratic caucus be
cause he had acted upon certain pub
lic issues in a way which he consid
ered was for the best Interests of the
country and the people of his state.
Senator Lodge presented to the sen-,
ato in executive session the report of
the committee on foreign relations,
recommending favorable action upon
the Hay-Pauncefote Isthmian canal
treaty and gave notice that today he
would ask the senate to go into execu
tive session for the consideration of
the treaty, repeating the request each
day until the senate should act upon it.
Senator Hale introduced a number
of bills relating to the navy.
Seuator Hoar introduced a bill giv
ing the United States jurisdiction in
cases of lynching and making the
crime of participation in lynchlngs
punishable by death.

lows: By Mr. Hoar, Senator Thurston's bill
of last Eoseion, defining conspiracy Jn

Wayne, W. Va.. Doc. 11. This town,

airiest wiped out by a fire that broke
out shortly aft?r last midnight and
raged until .after daylight yesterday
morning. The following buildings are
destroyed: i.on Davis, dry goods

There was but little insurance, as the
town has no fire department. The fire
originated in a livery stable and a
stiff wind that was blowing caused the
flames to sweep on, destroying every
thing in their path for two squared.
The inhabitants could do nothing but
stand idly by and see their property
go up In smoke.

Headache
kills, not necessarily suddenly,
but SURELY. It preys upon the
intellectual powers more than
we' realize. It consumes the
vitality faster than nature can
replenish it, and we cannot tell
just what moment a temporary
or complete aberration of the
mind will result. Headache and
pain should be promptly re
moved but properly. Many
pain cures arc more harmful
than the pain. Beware. If
you would be safe, take
