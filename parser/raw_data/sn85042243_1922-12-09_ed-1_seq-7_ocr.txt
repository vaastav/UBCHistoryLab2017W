Chicago, Dec. 9.—Wheat displayed

early dealings, the optimistic speech
oP Jujius H. Barnes yesterday be­
fore the Illinois Chamber of Com­
merce having some effect on senti­

commission house buying immediate­
ly after the start which readily ab­
sorbed the offerings from local tra­
ders, and prices advanced readily. Of­
fering sincreased, however, on the
way up and the advance was check­
ed. The opening which varied from
Mc decline to a like advance, with
May $1.17% to $1.17% and July $1.08

around.
Corn and oats later showed fair
activity and advanced sharply with
all deliveries of oats at a new high
for the season. Corn closed strong
at a net gain of l%c to l%c,
with May 71 %c 71 %c.
Oats started %c higher to a like
decline, May 43%c to^~43%c, and
later scored gains all around.
Provisions were higher, being in­

sharp. More of the next to best Nq.
1 dark northern edg^d dp to 18 cents
over the December. Aside from that,
virtually no change developed in
comparative prices. Durum offerings
were light and in rather strong gen­
eral demand. Winter offerings were
fair and in good demand.
Corn demand was insufficient to
absorb all of the offerings and pri­
ces showed weakness compared with
futures.
Oats demand was stronger with
Chicago buyers taking hold more
freely for quick shipment.
Rye demand was steady, but owing
to the narrowing of the spread be­
tween the December and May, buy­
ers paid less money compared with
the former.
Barley was strong in tone. Scat­
tered sales wcr^lc 2c higher and
all grades were injb'ctter general de­
