Commissioner Carter of the general
land office has issued a form of permit
to be granted persons applying to cut
timber from the public lands. Among
the stipulations is one forbidding the
cutting of more than 50 per cent of
each class growing on any acre.
Monthly statements, under oath, are re
quired, giving descriptions of the tract
from which the timber is cut, the
amount cut and how disposed of. No
trees shall be cut or removed less than
the specified number of inches in
diameter, except for needed roadways
through the timber. A person cutting
timber is required to cut, remove and
burn or otherwise dispose of the tops
and brush of the trees, etc, to prevent
forest fires, and to be held liable in
damages for the spread of any fire
attributable to his neglect.
Never was the circus, which is
always a part of the drawing by lottery
for seats in the house on the first day of
a new congress, more enjoyed by the
members and spectators than it was
yesterday, and the ring-leaders in the
fun were mostly the men whose nerves
had been racked to their utmost tension
during the long uncertain period of the
speakership contest in the caucus. The
gayety of the members was therefore
but the natural reaction of nature. . The
spectators in the galleries also took part
in the sport. When the members were
all huddled up in the open spaces be
hind the seats and the blind-folded boy
made his appearance to begin drawing
the numbered marbles out of the box,
such remarks as: "You'll get pulled for
running a lottery," "Where's the cops"
and "VVanamaker will be after you,"
might have been heard in all parts of
the galleries and even upon the floor of
the house.
George Livingston, eldest son of E.
J. Livingston, formerly a state senator
of Oregon and member of the California
assembly from Yuba county, died at his
father's home in Fuenta, Cal, in dread
ful convulsions and pain caued by
nicotine poison. The deceased was 14
years old. For four years he had been
an inveterate smoker of cigarettes.
Everything that his parents could do
failed to check the habit. He was sent
on a trip to Japan; he was offered
$1,000 to stop; he was locked in his
room for two weeks at a time, but he
would return to his cigarettes. For the
past year he consumed over forty
cigarettes a day and some days he
would smoke over seventy. He even
got up nights to smoke. He had been
unwell foi several months and his skin
assumed a peculiar yellowish hue,
while his eyes became glossy and his
respiration poor. His skin turned black
after death. A post mortem examina
tion showed that his heart had been
poisoned with nicotine.
Let's reason together. Here's a firm,
one of the largest the country over; it
has grown, stop by step, through the
years to greatness and it sells patent
medicines 1 ugh I
"That's enough !"
Wait a little
This firm pays the newspapers good
money (expensive work, this adver
tising 1) to tell the people that they have
faith in what they sell, so much faith
that if they can't benefit or cure they
don't want your money. Their guaran
tee is not indefinite and relative, but
definite and absolute if the medicine
doesn't help, your money is "on call."
Suppose every sick man and every
feeble woman tried these medicines and
found them worthless, who would be
the loser, you or they ?
The medicines are Dr Pierce's "Golden
Medical Discovery," for blood diseases,
and his "Favorite Prescription," for
woman's peculiar ills. If they help

Commlttae to Meet on January SI.
Washington, Dec. 9. The session of
the House yesterday was consumed in
its organization and in disposing of
routine matters necessitated by the new
administration. After Clerk McPher
son had called the members to order,
Mr. Crisp was elected Speaker, his
opponents being ex-Speaker Eeed and
Mr. Watson of Georgia the candidate of

The members who did not rota on the

son; Ryan, of Missouri; Buchanan, of
Virginia; Wilson, of Kentucky, and
Hoar and Williams, of Massachusetts.
Mr. Reed and Mr. Mills escorted the
new Speaker to the chair amid great
cheering and nan leKppinjj, and Mr.
Crisp delivered a little speech of thanks
for the honor conferred on him.
The oath of office was then adminis

cratic canons, James Kerr of Penn
sylvania was elected clerk of the House;
Samuel S. Yoder of Ohio, sergeant-alarms;

Senntn.
Washisotos', Dec. 9. In the Senate,
imu.eJiately after the reading of the
journal, the oath of office was adminis
tered to Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, (re
elected). Among the Department and other
communications presented and referred
was the report of the Superintendent of
the Census iu the matter of the estab
lishment of a permanent Census Bureau,
together with the draft of a bill. Also
the report of the Secretary of the Senate
showing contingent esp3nsos.
Mr. Hoar expressed the opinion (in
which the Vice-President concurred)
that the first business was the question
of administering the oath of office to
Mr. Dubois of Idaho.
Mr. Cullom's motion (to that effect?)
was put and agreed to, and the oath
was accordingly administered to Mr.
Duijois.
Mr. Hoar's similar motion as to Mr.
Call, of Florida, was also agreed to, and
the oath was administered to Mr. Call.
On further motion of Mr. Hoar the
papers in the matter of the credentials
of Mr. Davidson (claimant for Mr. Call's
seat) were referred to the Committee on
Privileges and Elections, with instruc
tions to investigate and report at an
early day, and, on motion of Mr. Hale,
a like reference was made of the papers
in the case of Mr. Claggeet, claiming the
seat of Mr. Dubois.
The Senate then, at 12:30, took a recess.
Although the recess closed at 2 o'clock
nothing took place until 2.35, when Mr.
Kerr, the newly elected Clerk of the
House, appeared and delivered a mes
sage announcing that the House was
organized, and ready to proceed to busi
ness, and that it had appointed a com
mittee of three (Messrs. lslount, Breck
inridge of Kentucky, and Reed) to join a
like committee on the part of the Senate
to wait upon the President of the United
States.
Mr. Sherman suggested another recess
till 3 o'clock to give an opportunity to
the House Committee to meet the Sen
ate Committee. This eourse was ag reed
to.
A few minutes before 3 o'clock the
House members of the Joint Committee
made their appearance, and being joined
by Messrs. Sherman and Harris, pro
ceeded to the White House.
The Senate then adjourned.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
It Will Probably ba Submitted Vo-mor-rowr
A Brief Document.
Washington, Dec. 9. It is believed
that the President's Message to the first
session of the Fifty-second Congress will
be submitted to-morrow immediately
after its assemblage. The report of
Secretary Foster will ba submitted on
Friday. As far as financial recommend
ations are concerned it is believed these
two messages will be almost identical.
1 hat of the President, it; is thought,
will be a comparatively brief one and
the space which it will probably devote
to financial matters will be short.
The only financial matter of great im
port which will receive the attention of
the preseut Con (Treat is the silver ques
tion. As i-t'gar Is this, the Administra
tion wiil si Mud on the present law.
Recommeadutions on this subject will
not be ma le except to reiterate those of
au international agreement.
SENATE COMMITTEES.
Individual tTlulias tu ! Consulted lean
uerattc Senatorial Cauous.
Washington-, Dec. 9. A meeting was
held yesterday by the Senate Ripublican
Caucus Ccmmittee, charged with re-ar-rang
ag the Senate Committers. Al
thcu -h there were reports of dlssatis
fii tion, it was agreed that efforts
ehou.il be made to learn the individual

the question of their assignment, and in
putsuancj of that purpose letters of
inquiry have been been addressed to
sueii ,-enators as have not yet verbally
expressed their preferences. The cau
cus committee will be guided in its work
by tiie well established practice of pro
moting to chairmanships, where vacan
cies exist, the senior Senator in point of
service.

Committee of the National Democratic
Committee has decided to call a meet
ing of the National Committee to be
held at the Arlington .Hotel, Washing
ton, Jan. 21, 1892, t decide upon the

THE SAWTELLE APPEAL.
No Evidence Presented that the Skull
Found Was Hiram's.
Concord, N. H., Deo. 9. At the af
ternoon session of the Sawtelle case the
reading of the stenographic minutes
was resumed. It included the testi
mony given by Inspector Cogan, of Bos
ton, who found blood stains on the
buggy seat; Professor Wood, who ex
amined the stains, and Dr. Ham, who
examined Hiram' wounds. Several
witnesses were called, who gave evi
dence as to the looallty in which they
heard shots on the day of the murder,
after which the State rested.
Counsel for Sawtelle then introduced
a plan of the locality where the head
was found buried. This closed the evi
dence and a recess was taken until to
day. Mrs. Hiram Sawtelle, who arrived
last night, says her husband did net
have artificial teeth, but that, on the
contrary, his teeth were all right. As
Dr. Grant in his testimony said when he
examined the skull last Saturday there
was no indication of teeth in the npper
jaw, the question has been raised
whether or not the skull was really
Hiram's. No evidence was presented to
the court identifying the skull as that
of Hiram Sawtelle.
The opinion is prevalent that Isaac
Sawtelle' petition will be denied by the
court.
" Dull of Gloucester's Trial.
Philadelphia, Dec. 9. William J.

any more disorder than would be war
ranted by the large crowds.
She Did Not Want to Live.
Pittsburg, Dee. 9. Mrs. R P. Lewis,
20 years aid, attempted suicide at the
St. Charles Hotel yesterday afternoon.
She was discovered, however, before the

traveling salesman for a Pittsburg
glass firm, instituted suit for divorce
yesterday, on the grounds of infidelity,

being made co-respondent. Mrs. Lewis

BATB, Me., Dec 9. Another addi

the gunboat Machias, so named in honor
of the first naval battle of t tie Revolu
tion, glided from ths ways into ths
Keuuebec at the Bath Iron Work-i at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Nearly 1U,OOU persons were present
and cheered again when the Michia.
gayly decorated with fligs an 1 baatiag,
slid gracefully into her native ele ne it.
Miss Etnul Hyde, daughter of Gjueral
Hyde, christened the vessel.
In view of the fact that the Machias
is the first steel boat built for the acor
ernment iu Maine, ths launching was
of more than usual interest and at
tracted prominent persons from all over
the State. Secretary Tracy was ex
pected to be present, but, on account of
stress of business, sent his regrets.
It is expected that the Machias will
be fitted for service by July. Her sister
craft, wnicb has not yet been named,
will not be launched till March.
