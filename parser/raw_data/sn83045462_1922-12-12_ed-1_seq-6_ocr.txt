Premiers Fail Again;
Hope that some sort ot a permanent
solution ot the reparations problem
might be found at the London conference
of allied premiers now has to be
abandoned. Being unable to lay even
the basis of an agreement, they have
adjourned their conference until January
2, less than two weeks before the
tilth of January, when the moratorium
granted Germany empires and a new
arrangement becomes imperative,
formal disclaimers that there has
been any break-up of the entente
.-erve merely to show the seriousness
of the situation. It probably is true
lucre nas oecn no rupture ui un-nuij
relations among the allies, but it up
pears equally true that, foe the time
being at -least, Great Britain and
France have found it Impossible to
co-operate in a policy toward Germany.
As matters now stand, the prospects
arc that after German default on
January !"> Fiance will occupy the
lluhr with her troops, and that such
occupation not only will lack British
co-operation, but that it will have the
positive and open disapproval of the
British government and people. The
nly alternative in sight is that between
now and the middle of January
the allies may agree upon another
makeshift and temporary reparations
program which will serve to stave
iff the oft-threatened crisis, but will
only prolong the intolerable conditions
which are steadily undermining the
it is difficult to determine whether it
would he better in the long run to
patch up another truce or to allow
things to come to a head, and then to
start over again on a new basis. Certainly
four years of temporizing have
not improved conditions in Europe,
and it is the belief of all students of
the situation that permanent solution
of the reparations cannot be much
o nger postponed, If Europe is to escape
another disastrous war and economic
collapse.
As has becOtne the habit when European
statesmen get up against the impossibility
of reconciling nationalistic
interests, they turn to the United
States with a plea for help. The proposal
now Is advanced, more or less
officially, that in order .to persuade
France y~> reduce her reparations
claim against Germany. Great Britain
Is willing to .ioin with the United
States in canceling the war debts owed
them by France. It is stated that bo
ween now and January 2 the Washington
government is to be "felt-out"
along that line. In response to such a
feeler this government could only reply
tfiat Congress, having taken adjustment
of the allied indebtedness
out of the hands of the executive and
lodged it with a special commission,
and that commission having been
specifically denied authority to cancel
any part of the indebtedness, nothing
can be done unless Congress reverses
itself. But the State Department
might ask just how France's debt
to the United 8tates bears on the present
crisis, in view of the fact that this
country is not pressing for immediate
payment of either principal or interest.
Whether the Senate situation trill
present that traditional problem in
political physics of the irresistible
forcer and the immovable body depends
upon the Irresistibility of the ship bill
and the immovability of the filibuster*.
Premier Mussolini's first experience
in an International conference doubtless
imposed a rigorous restraint upon

of dealing with assemblages.
1 Washington's Water Needs.
Washington's three outstanding watap
nrnhlamn ara atatad tn ha ne fat.
v"* r? ?? ?~ ? ?*v?
iows: To complete in the shortest possible
time the new conduit from Oreat
fells, now under construction after
many years of delay; to secure from
Congress sufficient allotments of
money annually to make the necessary
extensions in service and trunk
mains to get the water to the users
after it has reached the reservoirs, and
to install a high-pressure system of
mains in the business section to safeguard
the city from the menace of
great fires.
These three needs, which were
stated in a comprehensive article
printed in The Star Sunday, require
no elaboration. Save possibly for the
last of them they are accepted at the
Capitol as vitally essential, and no
doubt is felt that those who frame the
appropriation bills will do their utmost
to forward them. Expressions of
this intention are given, and the only
tueation at present is whether the
amount alljtted for the coming fiscal
year will be <1,600,000. as proposed by
the budget bureau for the continuation
of the initial construction work,
or S1,TS0,000, as estimated by the engineers
as the amount that can and
should be expended during the year.
It will be a serious error if the work
of constructing the connections and
the additional mains is postponed until
the completion of the conduit. Tho
primary need Is to give Washington
more water as speedily as possible.
Experience has shown that unless
every fcbaaa of a work of this magnri
tude is undertaken at once some part
' of it will Ik; delayed to the point of
. postponing; seriously the consummation
of the wHole. 'The water extension
project roust be considered as one
enterprise, and not as a aeries of
works, to be provided for in sequence.
Provision*, therefore, should be
; made for th'e connections now. so
tliat b.v the time the additional conduit
and reservoir facilities are provided
the system of distribution will be avail
i aoic lu srnu me water to an users.
: I As fov the high-pressure service,
j considered as a safeguard against the
j destruction of incalculable values by
j tiro, the government is especially and
1 directly concerned. Such a system
would cover the area occupied by the
public buildings. Kven with the additional
supply of water from Great
; Falls assured by the increase of the
conduit equipment the mains would
not suffice to furnish water enough
to fight a fire of first magnitude such
as those that have visited other cities,
and such as may. with the most
scrupulous precautions, visit AVash- i
ington and menace the very organization
of the government itself.
The installation of a high-pressure
i service should not be reckoned as part
of the project of increasing the supply,
save as it will when installed
lessen the drain iinnn fhe mains fnr
fire-fighting purposes. It should be j
viewed as an independent proposition j
and undertaken as such. Though esti-1
mates and recommendations have been j
withheld at present, in deference to;
the requirement to keep all appropria-!
tions to the lowest possible limit, this
item should be considered nevertheless
by Congress as one of the essentiuls
of public security.
The Fuel Situation.
Washington is beginning to feci the j
cramp of coal shortage and the pihch j
of high prices for fuel. Householders |
ni'o ili-qtuT'i t??l v ntivinllta fiir
their supply. They are getting small
doles from dealers, at higher prices
than many are alile to afford, and with
little or no assurance of further allotments.
A tendency to push the rates
higher appears, and the fact-finding
commission lias undertaken an in-1
ijulry, summoning several of the local j
dealers to ascertain, if possible, the re-]
sponsibility for price-boosting, of i
which complaint has been made. j
Pleas have been made to household- j
era and other large fuel users to adopt I
substitutes for anthracite, but the sup-:
plies of these substitutes have not!
been adequate to prevent high prices j
for tliem as well. Whichever way the j
individual buyer turns he meets a for- i
bidding scale of rates and a reluctant j
delivery.
Undoubtedly there is a shortage of j
anthracite. The mining of this fuel j
was resumed later than in the bitu- ]
minous field. Five months of idleness j
j left the stocks in the yards of dlsj
tributors exhausted, and the reserve j
! piles at the mines and the wholesaling j
| points lowered almost tq the ground !
! revel. Nothing but rationing as com-1
! p'.ete and systematic as possible could j
j prevent general suffering. Somehow j
tne rationing process nus not uceu i
carried out satisfactorily. It has been j
possible for some consumers to get all j
they require, while others have had
to be content with driblets.
If excessive charges prevail in!
Washington. docs the fault lie with !
the distributor or with the wholesaler?
The "fact-finding" commission should
be able to ascertain. If there is
I profiteering at the expense of the
shivering and apprehensive public it
should be punished if any possible waycan
be found to effect it.
Meanwhile, Washington must have
coal or efficient and sufficient substi

Mr. Bryan's Alertness. j
Mr. Bryai# is alert?keeps his eye j
steadily on the gun. Whenever ques- j
tions unusually interesting are in |
i hand or under informal discussion on
Capitol Hill he manages to "make"
Washington for a call or a brief visit.
He has just paid us a call, spent a
day on the hill conferring with friends
and exchanging banter with opponents,
and passed on to the balmier
air of Florida. He is ever and always
a welcome visitor.
Something new in the way of gossip
about Mr. Bryan has grown out of
the statement that Mr. Norris of
Nebraska does not desire another terra
in the Senate, and may not care even
to fill out his present term.
This question is asked: If Mr. Xorris
were to resign, would Brother Charles,
who becomes Governor of Nebraska
January 1, appoint Brother 'William to
the vacancy?.
Two things would appear to make
this unlikely. Brother William is now
a Floridian?so much so his name has
been canvassed in connection with a
aenatorship in the Peninsula state.
A seat in the Senate would hamper
him?tie him down to a job. He is at
his best foot-loose?at liberty to go
here, there and yonder as the humor
strikes him, or the political situation
seems to call. He is not assoclable
with the humdrum, the routine, the
everyday, what you please. As a
"rover" he plays the game with' great
zest, and should not be differently as- J
signed. He serves himself and his I
party best in that capacity. j
Disarmament finds the Grand Duchy
of Luxemburg so weaponless that it
must borrow a "seventy-five" from

Mayor Hylan's Nominations.
Mayor itylan would not permit the
use of his name in connection with the
nomination for Governor of New York
which fell to "Al" Smith. He has repeatedly
tapped on the wrists his more
fervent friends who insist on seeing
in him a future President of the
United States. He insists on holding
down his present job, and declares
that when his time is up ho will return
to private life, thankful for
honors received but soliciting no more.
Still the mayor has views about
politics, the present pass to which the
country has come, and what should be
done If the country Is to be saved.
lie Is bold in the assertion that the
two old parties aro in need of new
leaders; that, as at present led, they
! are not forward-looking, * but have
eyes too often fo" the "interests"; that
the proper leaders are available, and,
unless chosen, a third party will be
the answer.
To the republicans he recommends
with others Hiram Johnson of California;
to the democrats, almost solely,
William Randolph Hearst of New
York and California,
j The Golden state is a great state,
1 but is not this suggestion of Mayor
Hylan a sort of trust in restraint of
nominations? Where do the other
states eome in? Resides, what be

gone to the Golden state Jo live, and Is
suspected of harboring a desire to
spend a term or two in the White
House?
The Shipping Bill.
This is taken front a report of yesterday's
proceedings In the Senate:
Senator Robinson of Arkansas assailed
the shipping bill, declaring that
it was unpopular with the people. He
said that before the -recent elections
the bill had not been pressed because
the republicans feared that if it were
taken up they would lose the election.
He said that as a matter of fact the
shipping bill was a campaign issue,
and that more than fifty republican
members of the House and Senate had
been defeated on account of that
issue.
If the Arkansas senator was speaking
in general terms he was doing no
more than is often done in politics,
both Inside and outside of Congress.
Hut if his remarks were based upon
statistics: If he has a lipt of the republican
members of the House and
1 Senate who pitched their campaigns i
| in the key of the ship subsidy hill and j
lost, lie will greatly strengthen his i
side of the controversy by publishing
it. "More than fifty" is a considerable I
number. i
A filibuster against this measure is j
threatened. It is conceded that if al- j
lowed to come to a vote the measure j
will pass. ]
This bill is not bracketable with the I
I anti-lynching bill, which a threatened
j filibuster has jus? defeated. That car;
ried. though not justly, a sectional
; tang. Democratic senators from the
j south felt moved to go all lengths
! against the Dyer bill.
| Hut there is nothing sectional or
1 partisan in the merchant marine question.
and it should not be blocked by
j partisan tactics for partisan purposes, j
As for the charge that it is "lame
duck legislation." the answer is that
"lame duck legislation" is as constitu!
tional as any other. In a sense, all the
| legislation of the session will be of
j the "lame duck" variety.

The Senate Districl
ment for Nations
Distinct advance lias been scored
during the closing year 1922 in the
campaign of the. people of the District
of Columbia for the right of national
representation in tne House, the Senate
and the electoral college. For tlie
J first time sine? this effort to secure
| the Americanization of the Washingtonians
was started a committee of
Congress has mado it favorable report
011 the proposed constitutional amendment
empowering Congress to grant
the desired representation. This report
was made by the District committee
of the Senate and is an inj
splration to all of voteless Washlng|
ton to make redoubled efforts In this
cause the House Judiciary com|
mlttee. Congress" in general and the
people of the states.
The report of the Senate District
committee is an able review of the
proposal and of the reasons in political
equity for its ,adoption. The text
of it, which will be printed in this
|tnd succeeding issues of The Star,
follows:
I.
Your committee having carefully
considered Senate joint resolution
133 and having held full hearings at
which both the advocates and the opponents
cf this resolution were heard,
report the resolution favorably and
recommend that it l>e passed, und that
the proposed constitutional amendment
be submitted to the states for
ratification.
Senate joint resolution 133 proposes
amendment of the Constitution of the
United States by inserting at end of
section 3, article IV, the following
words:
"The Congress shall have power to
udmit to the status of citizens of a
state the residents of the District
constituting the seat of the government
of the United States, creatt^l by
article I. section 8. for the purpose of
representation in the Congress and
among the electors of President and
Vice President and for the purpose of
suing and being sued in the courts of
the United States under the provisions
of article III. section 2.
"When the Congress shall exercise
this power the residents of such DisI
trict shall be entitled to elect one or
| two senators, as determined by the
I Congress, representatives in the
House, according to their numbers as
'determined by the decennial cnumeraj
tion, and presidential electors equal
! in number to their aggregate repre!
sentation In the House and Senate.
: "The Congress shall provide by law
the qualification of voters and the
time and manner of choosing the
! senator or senators, the representak
tive or representatives and the elec
' tors herein authorized.
'The Congress shall have power to
make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution
the foregoing power.'*
This resolution thus proposes: (1)
A new constitutional power for Congress;
(2) a new right and power for
residents of the District, to be enjoyed
when Congress in its discretion
shall exercise its new constitutional
power.
*
I \t* Power for roatreut -\ew Right
I for District.
3. The new constitutional power
| for Congress which Is sought Is the
I power to grant national voting repret
sentation to residents of the District
j in House, Senate and electoral college,
with access to the federal
courts, witnout depriving congress oj
the power of exclusive legislation
over the scat of government given
by section S, article T, of the Constitution;
without making a state of
the District, and without granting to
residents of the District any other
privileges, powers and attributes of
citizens of a state than those specifically
enumerated.
2. The privilege, right and power
to be enjoyed by residents of the
District, when the amendment shall
have been ratified, and when the newpower
of Congress shall have been
exercised. Is voting participation by
the District residents on American
principles In the national government
which taxes them, makes all
laws for them and sends them and
their sons to war. and access like
that of citizens of a state to the federal
courts, their relation to which is
now, the I'nlted'States Supreme Court
has said, on a lower plane than that
of aliens.
Ratification of the proposed constitutional
amendment will thus cure
the impotency of Congress to grant
national renreaen t at ion to anv nart
of the territory belonging: to the
United States, by extending this power
to the District constituting the
seat of government of the United
States, and will tend to cure the Impotency
of the District to participate
on American principles in the national
'government.
Curing Twofold Impotency.
Your committee is convinced that
both impotencles should be cured?
that of Congress at once, and that of
the District at the fitting time in the
future'in the judgment of Congress.
We agree that Congress should not
be impotent to grant national representation
to any group of Americans
qualified under the usual tests for
such representation. And we agree
that tfe* District people should not
be impotent to participate like other
Americans in the national councils
after demonstration of fitness in
population, resources and other
American attributes, provided such
representation can be secured without
destroying or impairing the power
of exclusive legislation in the
District now possessed by Congress.
We are convinced that adoption of
S. J. Res. 133 and ratification of
the constitutional amendment proposed
by it will result in curing both
impotencles, without disturbing in
the least the exclusive legislative
power of Congress in the District.
We see no reason whatever why
Congress should not approve this
grant to itself of a new constitutional
power, extending its existing
powers on logical and equitable lines,

now'has the power to admit

all the territory belonging to the
United States, except the District constituting
the seat of government of

| Harmonising Two Vital American
Principles.
, The- pending resolution (S. J. Res.
1133) solves this problem by empowering
Congress not to admit the Dis
trict to statehood, which would destroy
its power of exclusive legislation.
but to grant to District residents
representation lilie that of cltij
zens of a state in Congress and the
I electoral college (with access to the
federal courts) and no other powers
and attributes of statehood than
those specifically enumerated. This
solution of the problem harmonizes
two great American principles: First,
that in our representative republic,
subject to limitations and conditions
uniformly applied, all national Americans
ought to have the opportunity
to participate in their national government.
and, second, the prirtclple
laid down by the forefathers as a national
necessity that the nation,
through Congress, should have exclusive
control of the nation's capital.
No reason appears why Congress
i should not approve the proposition
to grant itself this new. wholesome
{power, logically and equitably round|
ing out the existing corresponding
| constitutional power which it now
. possesses in respect to every foot of
| territory belonging to the United
injr the seat of government of the
T'nited States, the District of Columbia.
Congrtfli Is Empowered, Not Directed
Adoption of the constitutional
amendment, while it arms Congress
with a new power, does not commit
Congress as to when it shall exercise
this power, and the amendment
may thus be favored both by those
who urge immediate exercise of the
power as soon as the constitutional
amendment is ratified and also by
those who wish to relieve Congress
from the shame of this peculiar impotency,
but desire to postpone exercise
of the power until the District ie
better fitted, in their opinion, to enjoy
national representation.
Adoption of the amendment is thus
' urged (1) from the viewpoint of
j justice to the people of the District
on the ground they are now fitted to
J enjoy and to meet the responsibilities
of this right and power, and (2>
{solely from the national viewpoint as
!a cure of national. impotency, irre{
spective of the time when for the
' fha n/itr ^nrutifni
J ttonal power shall bo exercised.
The advocates of Senate Joint reso'
lution 133 vigorously contend that the
' residents of the District are now entitled
In population, in resources, in
literacy, in public spirit, and in loyal
Americanism to receive this right and
power, and since they cannot enjoy
it except as the result of constitutional
amendment making the exclusive
legislation clause of the Constitution
consistent with the enjoyment of tjiie
right and power, the Constitution should
be at once amended as proposed in thf
j joint resolution, In order that prompt
Justice may be done to the American*
of the District. The Constitution should
i be quickly amended as proposed, and
I the power granted to Congress should,
they urge, be exercised at once.
Relieve the Shame of National Impoteney.
Your committee are convinced that,
irrespective of the present fitness or
unfitness of District residents to enjoy
the American right to be granted byCongress
when it exercises its new
I constitutional power, this Joint- resolution
should be promptly passed by twothirds
of Congress, and the proposed
constitutional amendment ratified by
three-fourths of the states, in order
to relieve the nation of the shame ol
impotency to cure, when it pleases,
the evil of un-American, totally nonrepresentative
government. at the very
heart of the nation, the seat of the
national government. Conviction oi
present lack of fitness of District residents
for national representation, oi
despair of such fitness in the near future.
logically-affects only the future
date to be firld, when Congress shall
wisely and Justly exeroise this power.
It has no logical tendency to delay the
ratification of the amendment Itself,
Congress should not lack the powei
to Americanize the District, no matter
how long its Judgment may impel it to
delay the actual exercise of this power
when secured.
National honfir is touched by Impotency
of the national government to
grant national representation to any
well populated. Intelligent, resourceful,
American community. Congress should
by constitutional amendment have this
power, for reasons affecting solely the
national prestige and Irrespective ol
any Immediate obligation to the people
of the District. While proof of present
fitness of the District in population and
resources for national representation is,
It thus appears, not an indispensable
prerequisite of adoption and ratification
of the proposed amendment, the demonstratlon
of that fitness naturally invigorates

THE CATHEDRAL. Hugh Walpole.
(Do ran.)
By way ot "The Cathedral" Hugh
Walpole haa created a distinct personality
for the most persistently
confronting fact of the world today.
That Is. he has given a body and a
> soul?feelings, motives and action to
a single aspect of the present world
revolution, a revolution whose slgp
of success is change?a vital change
in human relations. This oonflict is
an open one and as far-reaching as
the earth Itself. It gathers, to either
one side of the battle line or the
other ell nlfiases nominations, be
llefs. Struggle and change?thla is
the war cry which the revolution
promises to throw down the barriers
between the two contending sides of
! industry, between the upper and lowj
er crusts of society, between the conservative
and liberal in politics, beI
tween dogma and reality in religion.
; A subject deep enough and wide
enough for a thousand authors and
ten thousand books.

Holding fast to struggle and
change" as the heart of the whole
matter. Mr. Walpole. out from this
panorama of modern revolution, has
chosen religion as the field of conflict.
Now. away back in human beginnings.
man. after he had secured
food and shelter and a mate, would
have had a fairly clear path had it
. n?i been for the ferocity of th?- natj
ural world around him?the cold, the
flood, the drought, the tornado, the
lightlying. These were terrifying
things. This early man had to have
a god to save him. And so. put of
his own fears, he inade God. Religion,
therefor#, is one of the first,
one of the deepest sources, one of
the Most passionate of human emotions.
It pro\'ides great and poignant
heme for a drama of life. But the
story of religion, even of one religion
among the many, is too long for any
single projection.
* * *
What Mr. Walpole does to meet the
necessity of limitation is to take his
theme to a little cathedral town in
the west of England. Moreover, to j
secure room outside the immediate
and shifting welter of things, he
moves the drama back a quarter of
a centum, timing it with the Queen's j
jubilee year, an event that serves a ]
good minor purpose here. This move !
backward sets an illuminating perspective.

drift that had, even then, made significant

THE WAYS OI
BY WILLIAM P
! I sat beside "Woodrow Wilson the
day he \aas nominated for the Presiidency.
For a fleeting moment I saw
him again today. He passed me in hi3
motor car. and with a flash of oldtime
recognition smiled, bowed and
waved. For a second our cars were
abreast. Then silently, save for the
j musical hum of whirring wheels, bis
smart equipage, lustrous in the autumn
sunshine, drew away, passing
the White House, and be was gone.
My eyes followed him. As he passed
the mansion where for a spell he
shaped the destinies of the world, he
looked neither to tne rigyi nor uie
left. His unwavering gaze was
straight ahead, eyes down, shoulders
somewhat stooped. The roadway, not
the White House, held his attention.
In the blue blur of the smoke from
his car, old memories took form. I
saw him sitting of a summer's night
on the lawn ef the governor's house
at Sea Girt. The air was chill and he
had wrapped a blanket about him.
Around him were grouped a score of
newspaper men, waiting for the final
word from Baltimore. From within
a tent, pitched a dozen feet away,
came the chatter of a telegraph key.
The tide of battle was running high.
Ballot sucSeded ballot without result.
Every few minutes the operator
would shout out the latest word. And
Wilson?
He was telling stories. The conflict
over his name seemed to him a thing
utterly impersonal. For two hours
| h?r sat there, most of the time leading
! the conversation. He delighted in
I making limericks. I remember one:
"For beauty I am not a star;
There are others more lovely, by far; !
But my face. I don't mind it.
For I am behind it.
It's the people in front that I Jar."

j that motor transportation should not

ly serve as local feeders to the freight

motor were charged with its proportionate
share of highway construction
we should find it wasteful an?I
more costly than like service by rail."
Undoubtedly that is true, yet when
has cost alone been accepted as th?
deciding factor in the acceptance '
modern improvements? The use o.
kerosene was more expensive thai,
the tallow din; the electric light costsmore
than the "coal-oil** lamp. Yet
as better ways are found the old is
superseded. The use of motor van>
for many kinds of freight, although
costing more per ton-mile than rail
transportation, will force its way into
favor because it is more convenieri
Household goods can be thus trans

crating, and without the extra hauh
at both ends of the railroads; th*
haul by motor is completed and delivery
made even before the freigh
