SNOW HILL. MARYLAND. DECEMBER S. 1917.
ANOTHER HONEST" MISTAKE.
The editor of The People is answered by Dr. Riley this week,
who shows that the editor has made another "honest" mistake. It
would be better not to attempt to discredit all Democratic officials
and Democratic leaders, be they great or insignificant, than to
make so many "honest" mistakes in the ardent attempt to injure
them.
Charles A. Dana, the greatest of editors said . "When you have
NOTHING to write about, don’t write."
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
Congress met on Monday and President Wilson delivered an ad
dress which has resounded around the world. The principal theme
was a demand that Congress declare war against Austria. We
have been practically at war with that country from the minute
we declared war against Germany, but without a declaration and
ar. actual proclamation to that effect. The United States could not
control the actions of Austro-German spies and mischief-makers in
the country.
President Wilson's message is a powerful argument of upassab
le logic. In moving words that brought cheers from the dis
-1 gathering that heard him. he branded the Dual Mon
archy as a vassal of Germany, and as such the enemy of the United
States.
'President Wilson asked fur immediate action. He got it. Con
gressional consideration was started at once at both ends of the
Capitol, and it is a foregone conclusion that war will be declared
on Austria, probably within a fortnight. The declaration may
come next week: or it may be delayed on the sole possible pretext
until after the holidays.
President Wilson’s message is regarded in diplomatic and official
circles as timed at the psychological moment. It comes at a time
when Russia is torn to pieces: w hen Italy i< pressed to keep the
German hordes from overrunning her great industrial territory: and
when the Marquis of Lansdowne was cry ing that it was time to
make peace along the lines that President Wilson had outlined. It
is a war message and declares plainly and boldly that this country
'2 in it. with all the money, men and resources it commands, to
bring about a successful conclusion for democracy.
It serves notice on Germany that the tight is against the only
thing which makes the German government impossible in a league
of honor. The President says the United States seeks not the anni
hilation of Germany, but the destruction of the -pint that made
possible the rape of Belgium and the machinations of Bernstorff.
THE NEED OF ECONOMY AND SAVING.
When we put a million and a halt soldiers in the field, we with
draw those men from productive nter|>ri>*-s. They do not while
they are actually in training .r in service pr< due* anything. They
do. on the other hand, consume much. There is nothing more ex
pensive on earth to support and maintain than a great army in the
field, especially if it is on the lighting line. The attrition of sup
plies and everything else is tremendously great when we have a
fighting army in the field.
America is the one great remaining storehouse ir. the world of
- '-tpiies and credit. We must maintain and make as effective as
sible our own soldiers and the soldiers of those nations who are
iting for us. We must therefore draw as little a> possible upon
common store of supplies and money . The more we lessen
domestic demand, the more we can contribute to the support
iffectiveness of fair allied armies.
onomy is now a national duty. such, a duty upon the people at
as fighting is upon those Americans w ho are bravely offering
; ves for the honor of America, and the preservation of liberty
*nd justice.
