are then formally recorded, compliments
being paid to Comtnodore? Poor, Porter,
and Brent, for prompt action in righting
the wrongs of American citizens. The
Japanese Embassy, reports as to the marine
corps, surgeons, and quartermasters, togeth
er with brief statistics of the various ex
ploring expeditions, form the main balance
of the Secretary's report, which closes with
a summary of naval estimates for the fiscal
year ending June 30, ISG2—total amount,
SI 1,513,904 01.
Report of the Secretary of War.
This report alludes to the recent hostili
ties on the part of the frontier Indians in
Texa3, New Mexico, and Utah. The Ki
owa, Camanehe, Payute, and Snake Indi
ans are referred to as the principal depre
dators. The Secretary states that while
the appropriations were sufficient to sus
ta rv the army upon a peace footing alone,
the loiter has been subjected to the expen
ses of a distant and sanguinary war. The
report opines that the Indian Bureau
phould be placed under charge of the
War Department, since it is impossible to
impress the savages into obedience by oth
er than military means. The Quartermas
ter's Bureau has expended 524.000,000
since the Secretary went into the Depart
ment. The inarch from St. Louis to the
Oregon river is detailed at length. Its ob
ject was to demonstrate the fact that a line
of communication could be made available
for removing large military forces from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. The Secretary al
ludes to a special report of a board of ord
nance and artillery officers. They recom
mend that our cannon be rifte-grooved, and
adapted to the use of James' elongated ex
panding projectiles. The Secretary asks
lor an appropriation of 850,000 for the ex
periments for the improvement of arms,
lie also suggests the necessity for a nation
al armory for the fabrication of cannon.
During the year a large quantity of con
demned muskets have been sold from the
different arsenals to make room for more
modern arms. The Secretary holds it to be
an inhuman economy which sends a soldier
into the field without furnishing him with
the best weapon that can be made. He be
lieves that the breech-loading gun will
shortly drive out of use those that load at j
the muzzle. The explorations undertaken \
by the Department of War across the
Great Basin and the Rocky Mountains are
referred to. The Massachusetts, a ship
with auxiliary steam power, has been used !
upon Tuget's Souud and the adjaceut wa
ters, to resist the incursions of Indians
from the British and Russian provinces. ;
The latter come down in canoes, which
will carry one hundred warriors, and move
with great speed. They give no warning
of their approach, and defy pursuit with
ordinary means. The Secretary proposes
to se'.i the Massachusetts, and substitute a :
light sea steamer of considerable speed.
Fort Wise is adverted to. This post lias *
been erected by Major Sedgwick, among
the Camanches and Kiowas, to protect the
emigrants to Pike's Peak.

President's Message.
We furnished this document to our read
ers last week in an extra, in advance of
city and all other papers. It needs but
little comment. While we find little ob
jectionable in its concluding portions, and
cordially agree with it in its tariff views,
the weak and imbecile reasoning in the
first part relative to the right of States se- j
ceding from the Confederacy, leaves but
little hope for the preservation of the Un
ion. His retention too of notorious trait
ors in his Cabinet who have used their pla
ces and power to embarrass the govern
ment financially, and furnish an unusual
number ot arms to bout-hern armories, so
that the disunion tories there may seize
them whenever needed—his failure to
strengthen the garrisons in fortresses in
threatened sections—all point to the inevi
table conclusion that James Buchanan's
want of foresight or energy to do his du
ty fearlessly and impartially, rather
strengthens than restrains the disunionists.
His only ambition now seems to be to per
suade the tories to await the close of his
administration bef ore resorting to open and
avowed treason. Old Hickory made no
pronations br traitors or their treason in
his day, under precisely similar circum
stances, and ae soon would have harbored
a nest of venomous serpents in the depart
ments as mauy of the men now holding of
fice.
B@lsrael Stewart, a sort of hermit in
Centre county, fell from a wagop while haul
ing corn fodder on the farm of Samuel Mc
. A'illiams, sen., and broke his n a ck by the fall.
Evils of Disunion.
Although our Southern neighbors have
j had, for years, the sad spectacle before
their eyes of brother fighting against broth
er and friend against friend, in Mexico and
South America, a few mad leaders are urg
: ing the masses on the very verge of the
1 abyss which disruptured MexicCkand the
! South American Republics. At present
! the Union is strong and respected by all
; foreign nations, for although wc could nei
' ther eope with France or England in na
val warfare, nor for a time with the first nam
ed on land, yet the greatest of European
nations know that if uny part of the Uni
ted States, as now constituted, was invaded,
millions of men, if needed, would rise in
arms to repel the foe. In this lies our se
curity, and especially the security of the
I South. But let a Southern Confederacy
j rear its head, and whether embracing five
! or fifteen States, the moment the deed of
; disunion is consummated, Spain (probably
backed by Napoleon) will make prepara
tions to re conquer Mexico, and if success
ful follow up that with an effort to recover
p)ssessio of Central America as well as
the South American Republics. ><o read
: er of history can fail to have marked the
! desire cf Spain again to obtain possession
' of those countries, and, unless we much
! efr in our judgement, nothing hut the con
viction that such an act would result in a
war with the Lnited States, (under what
is called the Monroe doctrine,) has hither
to deterred her from making the attempt.
Disunited from the bonds which heretofore
bound the North to the South, the Monroe
doctrine would no longer he regarded in
the North as a cause for war. The alter
native would then be presented to the
u Southern Confederacy" of engaging in
war with Spain, or they would have to set
down quietly and see a nation of strangers
—one too that is fast recovering power —
acquire possessions in dangerous proximity
to the southern border, and ready, perhaps
willing, to seize Texas on the first signs of j
a further disruption. Are Southerners re- '
ally so blind as not to see this plain page j
of history ?
Another curious commentary on the dis- j
union feature of the South is that while j
they arc taking measures which the past j
has without exception stamped as a step
towards ruin and desolation, a population
far inferior to ours, under the lead of Gar- j
ibaldi, thus far the Washington and Boli- '
var of Europe, has effected a union of the j
greater part of Italy, and consolidated that j
heretofore divided country under one gov- j
ernment.
That ambitious men in the South, un
der pretext of ideal wrongs, are mislead
ing the people for ulterior purposes we have
never doubted. These men know full well
that no man holding their views can here
after be elected President of this country,
nor can they expect to monopolize the prin
cipal offices as they have done since the
formation of the government. In a South
ern Confederacy they not only expect to
continue in doing so, but we have never
doubted they expect to do more, i. e. they
have in view a Dictatorship or Limited
Monarchy, with Titles of Nobility and
Hereditary Estates. A portion of this is
already foreshadowed in the proceedings of
the South Carolina Legislature, to which
we invito the attention of our readers, as
detailed by a correspondent of the Balti
more American, one of the most reliable
papers in the country :
COLOMBIA, S. C., Dec. 5, 1800.
Yesterday the debate in the House of Rep
resentatives was unusually warm. The par- I
ties arrayed against each other in the matter
of organizing an army, and the manner of
appointing the commanding officers, used
scathing language and debate ran high
throughout the session. So far as lam able
to judge, both the opposing parties are led on
by bitter prejudices. The Joint Military
Committee, with two or three exceptions, have
pertinaciously clung to the idea that a stand
ing army of paid volunteers, to be raised at
once, to have the power of choosing their of
hceis, up to captain, and to require all above
to be appointed by the Governor, is the or
ganization for the times. Mr. Cunningham,
of the House, who is put forward by the
Committee to take all the responsibility of
extreme sentiments, has openly avowed his
hatred of democracy in the camp. He con
siders the common soldier as incapable of an
elective choice, lie and others of his party
wage a bitter war against democracy, and in
uicate an utter want of faith in the ability of
the people to make proper choice in elections.
The party opposed to this, the predomi
nant party, is ostensibly led in the House by
Mr. MoGowan, of Abbeville, and Mr. Moore,
of Anderson. These gentlemen have a hard
fight of it. They represent the democratic
sentiments OT the rural districts, and are in
opposition to the Charleston clique, who are
urged on by Edward Rhett, Thomas Y. Sim
mons, and B. 11. Rhett, Jr.. of the Charles
ton Mercury. The tendencies of these gentle
men are all towards a Dictatorship or won
arehial form of government, at least it ap
pears so to my miud, and I find myself not
alo*e in the opinion. They fight heart and
soul for an increase of gubernatorial power,
and one of their number, as I have already
stated, openly avowed his desire to make the
Governor a military chieltain with sovereign
power.
See the working of their views. They will
enrol! a body of 10 000 men for an ostensible
: purpose. That purpose is alleged to be the
protection of their homes, wLes, altars, fire
sides, and other patriotic intentions. They
place the supreme military power into the
hands of the Executive ; he appoints whom
he plepses, and oertainlv he will choose none
but those of his way of thinking. The offi
cers will impart sentiments to the men, the
country will be under the rule of the army,
and one man at the head—and what next can
easily be imagined. The power of the Rhett
party has already been felt. Thus far it has
been in the ascasdancy—and it haagrown so
powerful thai thpre ar# strong fears that Ed
mund Rhett, of the Senate, will be elected
the next Governor. If this is the case, the
thing will be all on one side, and the worst is
to be feared. The election of Governor, you
know, is by the Legislature. All the domi
nant power has to do therefore is to pitch up
on a man, and he is elected. Certainly they
will not choose a person who does not reflect
their sentiments,.
Proceedings of Congress.
On the reading of the President's Message
in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Clingman led
off the debate in a violent speech. lie pre
dicted dissolution within sixty days, and said
the wisest thing Congress could do would be
to divide the public property as fairly as
; sible. Mr. Crittenden, with some words of
calmness and moderation, rebuked the vio
lence of the North Carolina Senator and dep
recated angry debate. He held the Union to
be worthy of great sacrifices and concessions,
and must search for the means of conciliation.
Mr. Clingman responded, approving of the
desire to preserve the Union, but avowing a
belief that he would be sustained in what he,
said by a majority of the people of North
Carolina. The usual motion to print the
Message was then adopted and the Senate ad
journed.
In the House after the reading of the Mes
sage, Mr. Sherman, Republican, moved to re
fer it to the Committee of the Whole on the
State of the Union. Mr. Boteler, of \ irgin
ia, offered an amendment referring so much
of the Message as related to the present per
ilous condition of the country to a special
committer of one from each State. Utber
propositions and amendments were offered,
but finally the house voted on Mr. Boteler's
amendment. A number of Southern mem
bers declined voting on the ground that their
States had called Conventions to act upon the
questions involved. Mr. Boteler's amend
ment was adopted—yeas 145, nays 38. Mr.
Morr s, of Illiuois, attempted to introduce a
resolution declaring an unalterable attach
ment to the Union and declaring that the
election of Mr. Lincoln did not justify its
dissolution, hut objectio . was made to its in
troduction, and a motion to adjourn prevail
ed.
Mr. Ilale, of New Hampshire, opened the
debate in the Senate on Wednesday, with a
motion to reconsider the vote to print the
President's Message. He thought the contest
between the States must be settled at the bal
lot box or by war, and whilst hoping for a
peaceable settlement, urged that the danger
should be looked straight in the face. [These
remarks of Mr. Hale were certainly not much
out of place, especially after Clingman's vio
lent speech the day before, yet we find the
whole locofoco press charging Mr. Hale with
having introduced the slavery or disunion
question.] Mr. Iverson, of Georgia, follow
ed in a violent secession speech, avowiug that
the withdrawing States disclaimed (ill further
allegiance, and they intended to go out of thq
Union before the fourth of March, "peaceably
if we can, forcibly if we must." Mr Davis,
of Mississippi, said that as long as the States
were in alliance threats were of no avail. Mr.
Wigfall, of Texas, favored secession and at
tacked the President's Message. He gave
notice of an inquiry to ascertain whether any
order had gone front the War Department in
relation to holding possession of the United
States f rts in South Carolina. It was ne
cessary, he said, to know what the President
intends doing in order to understand the Mes
sage. Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, uttered
some Union sentiments that were warmly ap
plauded by the galleries. Delaware, he said,
was the first to adopt the Federal Constitu
tion and would be the last to do any act
countenancing a separation of the States.—
The debate then terminated.
Mr. Green, of Missouri, gave notice of a
resolution inquiring into the propriety of
providing for the establishment of an armed
border police to prevent the invasion of States
and to aid in the execution of the Fugitive
Slave Law.
The Ilouse had a quiet and dull session.—
The Homestead bill was called up by Mr.
Grow, of Pennsylvania, and passed—ayes
132, navs 70. The bill requires a payment
of ten dollars from actual settlers for oue hun
dred and sixty acres of land. In Committee
of the Whole the Pension and Military Acad
emy bills were agreed to, the various portions
of the President's Message referred to the ap
propriate Standing Committees, and the
House adjourned.
There was nothing of importance done in
the Senate on Thursday. A memorial from
California, asking for the establishment of a
daily overland mail, was presented by Mr.
Latham. Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, offered
a resolution referring that part of the Presi
dent's message treating on the secession ques
to a special committee of thirteen, with in
structions to enquire " whether any addition
al legislation than already within the sphere
of the Federal authority aud duty to be ne
cessary for the protection and security of the
property of the United States, and if so to
report the bill; and that said committee be al
so instrueed to consider the report whether
it is deemed expedient to propose an amend
ment or amendments to the Constitution of
the United States, so as to ensure prompt and
full protection of the right and property of
the citizens of every State and Territory, jvnd
' insure the equality of the States aud equal
rights of their citizens under the Federal
j Constitution." The consideration of the res
olution was postponed, and the Senate ad
journed till Monday.
In the House of Representatives, Mr. Mor
ris, of Illinois, gave notice ho would intro
duce, on Monday, his resolution on the Union.
A bill abolishing the franking privilege was
reported. A bill to construe the meaning of
the words "minimum of the price of public
lands" was passed. It provides that the word
1 minimum shall be construed according to
I the land-graduation act, so as to apply to alter
nate and reserved sections of lands granted
for railroads and other internal improvements
aud in favor of actual settlers, aud not to
mean $1 25 per acre, as now officially con
strued. The Speaker announced the special
committee on the Secession question, which
consists of the following members:
Mr. Corwin of Ohio, Chairman.
Virginia —Mr. Wilson.
Massachusetts—Mr. Adams.
North Carolina —Mr. Winslow.
New York—Mr. Humphrey.

i Missouri—Mr. Phelps,
j Arkansas—Mr. Rust.
Michigan—Mr. Howard.
Texas—Mr. Hamilton.
: lowa—Mr. Curtis.
Oregon—Mr. Stout.
Mr. Hawkins, of Fiorkkv asked to be ex
cused from serving, alleging secession sym
: pathies as the reason for his course. A mo.
j tion to excuse him led to an angry debate,
amid which the House adjourned without act
ing upon it.
The Senate and House of Representatives
met again on Monday. In the Senate the
j standing committees of the last session were
continued. A memorial from Thaddeus Ily
! att, praying for relief for the Kansas suffer
| ers, was presented by Senator Sumner, and
i referred to the Committee on Territories.—
| The Homestead Bill, as it came from the
House, was taken up and passed on tirst read
| ing. In the House the question of excusing
| Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, from the Union
j Committee, vyas again taken up. Mr. Sher
; man, having obtained the consent of the
j House, reported a bill the relief of the
Treasury. It authorizes the President to is
sue treasury notes, for such sums as the ex
igeneies of the public expenses require, not
exceeding ten millions. Several amendments
wero offered but defeated, and the bill as re
i ported passed.
