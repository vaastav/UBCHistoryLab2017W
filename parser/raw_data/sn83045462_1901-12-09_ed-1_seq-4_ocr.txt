%me Limbo of Appurtenant Territory.
The Supreme Court in last Monday's
opinions rounded out its decisions in the
Insular tariff cases and reaffirmed its pre
vious declarations concerning the relations
between the United States and the new in
sular posse=ions. The court had decided
in May in De Lima vs. Bidwell that Porto
Rico was not a "foreign country" under
the Dingley tariff act, and in December in
the Pepke case it makes the same declara
lion concerning the Philippines, brushing
aside all attempts to discriminate the case
of the Asiatic archipelagd from that of the
West Indies -island. Similarly the court
ha4 in May declared in Downes vs. Bidwell
that Porto Rico was not "within the United
States" as those words are used in the rev
enue uniformity clause of the Constitution,
and that consequently the Foraker act im
posing duties upon importations Into the
United States from Porto Rico was consti
tutional: and now in December In the sec
ond Dooley case it reaffirms and extends the
decision in Downes vs. Bidwell, and sus
tains the constitutionality of the Foraker
act in imposing duties upon importations
from the United States into Porto Rico.
The same five judges who made the de
cision in Do Lima vs. Bidwell reaffirm it in
the Pepke case; and the same five judges
who rendered the court's decision in
Downes vs. Bidwell unite in the judgment
along the same lines in the second Dooley
case. Nobody has changed his mind. The
law concerning the relations of the republic
and its dependencies as laid down in May
is the law today.
The court's decision In the Pepke case,
declaring the status of the Philippines to
be precisely that of Porto Rico. throws on
Congress the urgent and immediate obliga
tion of providing for the Asiatic archipel
ago a Foraker act, determining its political,
Commercial and administrative relations to
the United States. The decision places
Philippine affairs among the most pressing
of legislative issues. It revives political
and popular interest In the concerns of our
Asiatic dependencies. In order to avoid
groping in the dark in legislating for the
public welfare along the lines laid down by
the Supreme Court in the insular cases
Congress is compelled carefully to review
again. the net results of the opinions ren
dered by the court in declaring the rela
tions of appurtenant and incorporated
American territory.
Elsewhere in The Star is printed the first
of two articles designed to show through
analysis of the insular decisions the char
acteristics of the status of appurtenant ter
ritory, a national limbo now first authori
tatively defined by the Supreme Court of
the United States. The occupants of this
American territorial status, the term of
their occupancy, their restrictions and their
privileges are noted, and finally in a second
article the benefits derived both by the
United States and its insular possessions
from the existence of this political purga
tory will be considered.
Brasen Anarchists.
The police of Cleveland are to be com
amended for their action yesterday in pre
venting the holding of a meeting of the
"Liberty Association," an organization of
arowed anarchists. It was this band of
yeds that taught Leon Czolgosz the doc
trines which later led him to assassinate
the President. It is considered a dangerous
body and has been watched closely by the
police since the tragedy of September. Its
effrontery in seeking to hold public meet
ings is. perhaps, to be accounted for by the
fact that thus far the law has been unable
to reach the reds in any city, save in New
York. where John Most was sentenced to a
short prison term for publishing an in
fLammatory editorial in his Journal. Chi
cago was impotent to hold Emma Goldman
and her associates, and since their release
they have participated in more than one
meeting at which the radical beliefs of the
anarchists were freely expressed. The cli
unax of this impudent defiance of the pub
lic patience was reached the other night,
'when at a meeting of the central body of
Chicago anarchists the man Isaaks, who
was arrested with Goldman after the as
sassination, declared that he held himself
below Czolgoaz, whereat there were cheers
for the assnasn.
If the law is so lax as to permit such an
exhibition of exultation over a deed which
has horrified humanity, Its amendment is a
mtter of the most urgent necessity. If
on the other hano there are laws and ordi
nances in force in Chicago to prohibit dis
orderly assemblage, or utterances calcu
lated to Incite riot or crime, as surely there
must be. why were they not applied in
stantly upon the utterance of these senti
ments. which called forth the clamor of
praise for Czolgosa? The leaders of the
meeting were all notorious anarchists. To
permit them to continue unmolested to defy
public decency and the principles of order
Is to encourage them to more flagrant out
bursts of contempt for government, per
haps even to sow the seeds of murder in
many hearts. Chicago's mayor is the son
of a man who, holding the same office, was
killed by a "crank." a man without respect
for authority, whose datardly inspiration
came, in all probability, from the "red"
company he had been keeping. This coun
try would respect Carter Harrison far more
than it does today if, at the first whisper
of treasonable applause for the assassin
of the President, he had caused the arrest
of the leaders in the demonstration and
their immediate prosecution under any ap
plicable statute or ordinance.
Now and then some publie man gets a
great deal of unjust criticism for mistakes
which his opponents take It for granted he

The Sofag'e Qmestlen.
The reply to Mr. Moody's suffrage resolu
tio)n comes from Mr. Flening of Georgia,
and is as follows:
"Whereas the constitutona of the state of
Ilassachusetts, In contravention of the pro
vision of the federal Constitution. impioses
additonal enualeatones fer suffrage by de
claring that no person shall have the right
to vote who shall net be able to read the
Constitution in the English language and
write hsname:
"Resolved. That when the said select om
mittee shall be apoenet.d it shall be
this House, and whether the number of
tepresentatives from maid Mtate should not
be sedued.
The press report states that "Mr. Moody

tion. He is ibMig to hees M==abi..n.

should not the whele country want soe a

The great smajority of repuhlanm today
are of opinion that the putting of the ballot
into the heads of en recently mancipated
by war was a mistiake. It Injured those
who received quite as much as those whO
gave. The soutbern democrats, to a man,
denmee the act as the greatest crime in
American history, and they cAim justiaca
tion for taking the ballot away from the
negroes by asserting that the negroes have
proved themselves to be wholly unworthy
of It.
Now whether the act was a great mis
take or not the present representation In
the lower house of Congress and in the
electoral college Is based upon it. The
south's present political ppwer is derived
from hundred of thousands of people to
whom she will not allow a voice in her
local affairs. Should the volume of her
voice In national affairs be longer swelled
by theL : Is it fair that this mistake be
remedied, in a purely local way, and yet
continue In operation In a national way?
If the negroes in the south are unfit to par
ticipate in the election of a precinct magis
trate or constable, or in the framing of dog
laws or road laws, should they vote by
proxies-and such proxies as they woui not
themselves choose-for President of the
United States, and for swamping the credit
of the nation with free silver and break
ing down American industrial supremacy
with free trade? For It Is a fact, easily
demonstrated, that the negro vote in the
south, counted in the. electoral college
against the negro's will, twice made Grover
Cleveland President, and, counted in Con
gress against his will, repeatedly passed a
free coinage bill through the House, and
wrote the Gorman-Wilson tariff abortion
on the statute books of the United States.
Why not a fair suffrage deal from Maine
to Texas, from New York to California?
What is paramount in the United States

Bourke Coeran as Adviser.
Bourke Cochran's claims to consideration
as an orator are undisputed. He has voice,
assurance, and vocabulary, and as a
phrasemaker, pure and simple, he has few
equals. Of his claims to consideration as
an adviser in public affairs so much may not
be said. It was only last year that he was
advocating Bryanism, and only last month
that he was on the stump in New York
city urging the success at the polls of
Tammany Hall.
Fresh from those two failures Mr. Cock
ran seeks now to disturb the peace be
tween the United States and Great Britain.
He gives out that his sympathies are with
the Boers In South Africa, and he wants
the war stopped. Somebody must suf
render, and as the Boers won't, Great Brit
ain should. And in order to bring Great
Britain to a realizing sense of things he
would have the word spoken here in the
United States. Hear Mr. Cockran on that
point:
"Providence has so ordered events that
the President of the United States can
compose this bitter quarrel. It is an ex
traordinary opportunity offered to an ex
traordinary man. It would not be neces
sary to draw the sword, to make any
threat of armed intervention, or to take
an unfriendly attitude. One word spoken
to the English ambassador, or in the hea
Ing of the English nation, would restore
peace, establish justice, secure liberty to
these burghers,. promote enormously the
prosperity of the human race, and bring
Immeasurable glory to the American na
tion. Will that word be spoken? Never In
history have such momentous results hung
on the lips of a human being. Will Theo
dore Roosevelt improve this opportunity for
himself, his country and the whole human
race?".
This sort of stuff is unworthy of serious
consideration. It goes with a whoop at a
public meeting where everybody Is of one
mind and argument Is tabooed, but exam
ined for a moment in the light of the actual
facts it is found to be sheer nonsense. The
President of the United States, as Mr.
Cockran well knows, could not afford to
speak any such word, and were he to do so
the effect would not be peace for-the Boers
but war for the United States. We have
already In the only possible way proffered
our good offices to Great Britain in the
premises, and they have been politely de
clined. That is more than Holland, or
France, or Germany, or Italy, or any other
European country where lip service for the
Boers is so cheap and plentiful, has done.
Shall we renew our offer In the form of a
threat? It could not be renewed in any
other form. Is there any reason why we
should take this war off the hands of Mr.
Kruger and his salaried buglemen trotting
about in Europe?
Mr. Cockran is entitled to his opinions in
the matter of South Africa-if he really has
any. But when he seeks to embroil the
United States in a war with Great Britain
over any cause now existing, he but gives
evidence of how subordinate his intelli
gence is to his tongue, and of how little
his advice Is to be trusted. He raises the
question of his common sense or sincerity,
and he suffers, no matter how the question
is decided.
In the rush to secure positions In the
coronation ceremonies, a man of distin
guished lineage was refused'the honor of
officiating as carver at the banquet for the
commonplace reason that he did not know
how to carve. This looks like another vic
tory for the principle of fitness for office.
Some manuscripts of Richard Wagner are
said to have been discovered In use as cov
erings for jam pots. The story was prob
ably started by a French writer as an In
sidious and cruel method of shocking Ger
many's musiclanly pride.
There was a time when a man who had
too much to say was simply told to hire a
hall. The authorities of Cleveland, Ohio,
have decided that this privilege Is too much
to be extended to anarchists.
A Georgia railroad has managed to main
tain the proposition that history repeats It
self by bringing forward a deadly car-stove
incident once more.
It is barely possible that if anarchists are
refused permission to exercise their lungs
In publie they' will leave this country of
their own accord.

SHOOTING. STARS.
Locating the Blame.
"It must be confessed that the climate is
rather uncertain," remarked the visitor.
"You are one of the few discerning men
I have had the good fortune to meet," an
swered the weather prophet. "I have often
tried to make it clear that, my predictions
are correct and reliable and that It is the
miserable climate that refuses to subordi
nate itself to the simplest rules of mathe
matics."

"I am always putting my foot in it," said

A Modernist.
"I don't believe," said the very thoughtful
person, "that the statesmen of the present
day are as far-seeing as those of & genera
tion ago."
"You are making a grave, but common
mistake," answered Senator Sorghum. "It
is wrong to assume that the modern in
telligence is 'Inferior. Thdse old-timers
could make good speeches, but as I read
history, I can see lots of chances to get
rich that they overlooked."
A Matter of Principle.
"Is you all gwine to hang up any mistle
toe dis Christmas?" asked Mr. Erastus
Pinkley.
"Deed I lsn'," answered Miss Miami
Brown. "I's got a little too much pride to
advertise foh de ordinary courtesies dat a
lady has a right to expect."
Excessive Sympathy.
I am very sympathetic; 'tis my nature so
to be.
I am filled with true compassion for most
everything I see.
When a difference arises 'tis my custom
and my pride
To tender my devotion to the unsuccessful
side.
My friends sometimes assure me that my
philanthropic dreams
Occasionally lead me to extravagant ex
tremes.
But I still maintain an obstinate adherence
to my creed.
The only things worth praising are the
thirigs that don't succeed.
I am sorry for the microbe that our chem

We plot 'gainst his existence and we flout
him and we rail:
He simply tries to get his humble living
day by day.
If we were microbes we would hate to be
abused that way.
We rise and shoot the mad-dog when we
see him on the run.
Although perhaps he only tries to bite us
just for fun.
I'm sorry for the public when I see how

The Union Station..
From the Philadelphia Press.
The friendly conference between Presi
dent Cassatt of the Pennsylvania railroad
and the members of the Senate committee
on the District of Columbia and certain
of the architectural experts who are work
ing upon the problem of a new Washing
ton seems to augur well for the future in
the matter of an adequate, convenient and
architecturally beautiful "union depot" at
the nation's capital. Both the officials of
the Baltimore and Ohio and those of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company have been
perfectly willing to admit that the Wash
intton terminals of these 'roads are far
from meeting the situation. , Owing to the
conflict of rival interests and to the lack
of plan on the part of Congress, what are
manifestly makeshift depots have endured
until the Immediate present. If, how'ever,
all parties agree on the new site gjn the
northeast corner of Massachusetts avenue
and North Capitol street, and the beauti
ful and commodious "union depot" that
has been designed already ls'brected there,
the capital will at least ha're a railroad
depot worthy of It. The proposea site is
just four blocks north of the Capitol and
is sixteen blocks due east of the White
H-ouse, either along F or G street. It is
on property now partly occupied by the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and hence
involves no invasion of territory not al
ready given over to business. As the new
site involves the abandonment of the depots
that interfere with the comprehensive
projects for the embellishment of the cap
ital, its Importance risee above the qu~es
tion of terminial convenience, and It isto
he hoped all parties to the new arrange
ment will have no trottble la coming to
an agreement.
