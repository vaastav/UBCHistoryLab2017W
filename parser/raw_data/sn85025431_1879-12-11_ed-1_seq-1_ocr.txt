Annual Communication of
President Hayes.

Fnxow-Crrnr
OF REPBESEV
Forty-sixth „fATIVE3
first
The
members of the
Congress have assembled in their
*«lar session nnder circumstances call
.or mutual congratulations and grateful
**nowledgement to tlio Giver of all good for
the large and unusual measure of national
prosperity which we now enjoy. Tlje most in
teresting events which have oeoarred in our
public affairs since my last annral message to
0ongres9 are connected with the financial
operations of the Government farectlv affectum
the business interests of the country.
KesumpUoik.
I congratulate Congress on the suocnaful
execution of the Restimp'iion tct At
ihe time fixed. *nd ii the manner
contemplated by law, United States notea
began to be redeemed in cato. Since
(he Is* of January last they have
been prompt redeemed on presentation, and
in an business transactions, public and private.
P?rts .°' coun'a-y. they are received
and paid out as tho oo^oiyalent of coin. The
demand upon the troe^vy for gold and silver
in exchange for Urwa gtates notes has been
comparatively and the voluntary deDosit
or com and bu'^on in exchange for notes' has
been very la*„s©. The excess of tho precious
metals deposited or exchanged for United States
notes OVPV the amount of United States notes
redeen.M) is about $40,000,000.
The reftumptlon of specie payments has been
followed by a very great revival of business.
Wtoh a currency equivalent in value to the
money of the commercial world, wo are ena
bled to enter upon an equal competition with
other nations in trade and production. The
increasing foreign demand for our manufact
ures and agricultural products has caused a
large balance of trade in our favor, which has
been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last to
NOT. 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000.
Public Credit.
Binoe the resumption of speoie payments
there has been a marked ana gratifying im
provement of the public credit The bonds of
the Government bearing only 4 per cent, inter
est have Bold at or above par, sufficient in
amount to pay off all of the national debt
which was redeemable under the present
laws. The amount of interest saved aut-aitiv
by the process of refunding the Wt»i
Alareh 1, 1877, is #14,297,177.8 Tl
•vere largeiy in small sums, anl «. ^mbrfr nf
is much greater than %ver before The
srs tsrst^n asSars
rate
tns
pot cent It is believed that
,: Yr/ oj the publio debt can be re
by the issue of 4-per-cent bonds,
»n-.by tho reduction of interest which will
thus be effected about #11,000,000 cau be an
uually saved to the treasury. To eecure thiB
important reduction of interest to bo paid by
che United States, further 'egielation is re
jnn^d, whioh it is hoped will be provided by
Congress during its pt©aent session. The
ooi age of gold by the miuta of the United
8tates dming the last fiscal year was *40,986,-
Educatlon.
It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of
Education tlie extent to which educational
privileges throughout the United States have
fieen advanced during the year. No more
fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress
than that of devising appropriate measures of
financial aiu to education, supplemental
to local action in States and Terri
tories, and in the District of Colum
bia. The wise forethought of the founders
of our Government has not only furnished the
basis for tho support of Uiu cOiiluiuu-Mcnrol
systems of the newer States, but laid founda
tions for the maintenance ot their universities
•f colleges of agriculture and mechanic art!
Measures in accordance with this traditional
policy for the further benefit of all ttiese in
terests and the extension of some advantages
to every portion of the country, it is hoped,
will receive vour favorable consideration.
Agricultural Rureau.
My recommendations informer
messages
are
renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of
the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture
ia the leading intereet fend the permanent in
ilustry of our people. It is to tho abundance of
agricultural productions as compared with our
home coEsamption and the largely increased
H.ad highly-profitable market abroad which we
ha^e et! joyed in recent years that we are main
ly indebted for our present prosperity as a
people. We must look to its continued main
tenance for substantial resource. There is no
branch of industry in which labor, directed
by scientific knowledge, yields such in
creased production in comparison with unskilled
ibor, ana cq branch of the publio service to
which thQ Encouragement of liberal approprfr
Hons can be more appropriately extended.
The omission to render such aid is not a wise
economy, but on the contrary undoubtedly re
mits in losses of immense sums annually that
night be Bared through well-directed efforts
by the Government to promote tliia vital
interest The result already aeeonapliehtd
with the very limited means heretofore placed
at the command of the Department of Agri
culture is an oarnest of what may be expected
with increased appropriations for the several
purposes indicated in the report of the
Commissioner, with a view to placing the de
pirtment upon a footing which wi enablo it
to prosecute more effectively tho objects for
which it is established. Appropriations are
needed for a more complete laboratory, for tie
establishment of a Veterinary Division and a
Division of Forestry, and for an increaeo I
force. The requirements for these and other
purposes indicated in the report of the Commis
sioner, under the head of Immediate Neces
sities of the Department," will not involve any
expenditure of money tnat the country cannot
with propriety now undertake- in the interests
of agriculture.
United States marshals.
The appropriation for judicial expenses which
has heretofore been made for tho Department
of Jusfcice in gross was subdivided at tho last
session of Congress, and eq appropriation
whatever was made for the payment of the
fees of Marshals and their deputies either in
the service of process or for the discharge of
other duties, and since July 30 these officers
have continued tho discharge of their dutios
without compensation from the Governmeut,
taking upon themselves the ujcessary incidental
outlays as well as rendering their own BerviceB.
In only a few unavoidable instances has the
proper execution of the nrooeBs of the United
states failed by reason of the absence of
the requisite appropriation. This course
of official conduct on the part of the officers,
highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised
by the Attorney General, who informed them,
however, that they would necessarily have to
rely for their compensation upon the prospeot
of future legislation by Congress. I there
fore especially recommend that immediate
appropriation be made by Congress for this pur
pose. The act making the principal appropria
tion for the Department of Justice at previous
sessions has uniformly contained the following
clause: "And for defraying the expenses
which may be inourred in the enforcement
of the act approved Feb. 29, 1870, entitled
'An act to amend an act approved Hay
80,1870,' entitled 'An act to enforce tho right
of citizens of the United States to vote in. the
several States of the United States, and for
other purposes,' or any acts amendatory there
of or supplementary thereto." No appropria
tion was made for this purpose for the current
year. As no general election of membero of
Congress occurred, the omission was a matter
Of little practical importance. Bach election
will, however, take place during the ensning
year, and the appropnation made for the pay
of Marshals ana deputies should be sufficient
to embrace compensation for the services they
may be required to perform at such election.
Popular Bights.
The elections of the past year, though
occupied only with Btato offices, Lave
not failed to elidt, in the political discussions
which attended theia all over the country, new
and decisive evidence of the deep interest
which the great body of citizens take
in ths progress of the oountry toward
a more general and complete establish
ment, at whatever cost, of universal
security and freedom in the exercise^ of the
elective franchise. While many topics of
political concern demand great attention from
our people, both in the sphere of National and
State authority, find no reason to qualify the
opinion I expressed in my last annual message,
that no temporary or administrative interests
of Government, nowever urgent or weighty,
will ever destroy the zeal of our people in de
fense of the primary rights of citizenship, and
that the power o# publio opinion will over
ride all political prejudices and all sectional
and State attachments in demanding that all
over cur wide territory the name and character
of citizens of the United -Bta|es^shall mean one
and the tsamothibg.^iid clrr*

CltU-Sftrtlee Reform,
In a
former message I invited the attention
of Congress to the subject of the reformation
of the civil service of the Government and
expressed the intention of transmitting to Con
gress, as early as practicable, a.report upon
this
subject
the Chairman of thb Civil Serv­
ice Commission. In viefr of the fact that
during a considerable period the Government
of Great Britain has been dealing trith
administrative problems and abuses in
various particulars analagous to those present
fed in this country ahd that, in recent years,
the measures adopted were understood to have
been effective and in every respect highlv sat
isfactory, 1 thought it desirable to have fuller
information upon the subject, and accordingly'
requested the Chairman of the Civil Service
Commission to make a thorough investigation
for this purpose. The result has been an elab
orate and comprehensive report The report
sets forth the history of the partisan spoils aym
tem In Great Britain, and of the rise wid tall of
the Parliamentary patronage, and of of
ficial interference with the freedom of
elections. It shows that, after lone
trials of Various kinds of examina
tions, those which. are competitive and
open on equal terms to all, and which are car
ried on under the superintendence of a single
commission, have with great advantage been
established as conditions of admission to almost
every official place in the subordinate adminis
tration of that country and of British India.
The completion of the report, owing to the ex
tent of the labor involved in its preparation, and
the omission of Congress to make any provis
ion either for the compensation or the expenses
of the commission, has been postponed until
the present time. It is herewith transmitted
to Congress. While the measures of another
Government are of no authority tot Us, they
are entitled to influence to tire e&tent to which
their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to
our institutions and social life
may
commend
thtm to our consideration. The views I have
heretofore expressed eoncorning the defects
and abuses in our civil administration remain
unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged ex
penenco has opened nvy seuee cf the duty both
of officers and of tha people themselves
to co-onorate for their removal. The grave
evils ind perils ojf & partisan-spoils system of ap
to office and office tenure are now
generally recognized. In the resolutions of the
great parties^ in Hi# reports of depa tments, in
the deba tes and proceedings of Congress, in the
messages of Executives, the gravity or these
evils has been pointed out, and the need of their
reform has been admitted. To command the
necessary support, every measure of reform
must bo baseu on coinmon right and justice,
and must be compatible with the healthy
existence of great parties, which are inevitable
and essential in a free state. When the
people have approved a policy at a
national election, confidence on the part of
the officers they have selected, and of the ad
visera who, in accordance with our political
institutions, should be consulted iu the policy
which it is their duty to earry into effect,
is indispensable. It Is eminently proper that
tliejy should explain it before the people, as
weu as illustrate its spirit in the performance
of their official duties. It hardly need be
pointed ous that very different considerations
apply to tho greater number of those who
fill the subordinate places iu the civil service.
Their responsibility is to their superiors
in official position. It is their duty to
obey the legal instructions of those upon whom
that authority is involved, and their best pub
lic service consists in tho discharge of their
functions irrespective of partisan politics.
Their duties are tb« same whatever party is in
power, and whatever policy prevails. As a
consequence, it follows that their tenure of
office should not depend upoh the prevalence
of any policy or the supremacy of any party,
but should be determined by their capacitv to
serve tno people most useiuuy, quKe
irrespective of partisan interests. The
same consideration that should govern
the tenure should also prevail in the ap
pointment, discipline, and removal of these
subordinates. The authority of appointment
and removal is not a porquisico which may be
usod to aid a friend, or reward a partisan, but
is a trust to be exercised iu the public interest,
under all the eanctions which attend the
obligation to apply the public funds only for
public purposes. Every citizen has an equal
right to the honor and profit of entering the
publio service of hia country. The only just
ground of discrimination is tho measuroof
character and capacity he has to make that'
service most useful to the people.
Except in cases where, upon jnst and recog
nized principles, as upon the theory of pen
sions, offices and promotions are bestowed as
rewards of past services, their bestowal upon
any theory which disregards personal merit is
an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a
breach of that trust subject to which the ap
pointing power is held. In the light of these
principles it becomes of great importance to
provide just and adequate meat s, especially for
every department and large adminstrative of
fice, where personal discrimination on the part
of its head is not practicable for ascertaining
those qualifications to which appointment."
and removals should have reference.
To fail to provide such means is not only to
deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts
upon which the most righteons claim to office
depend, but of necessity to discourage all
worthy aspirants by handing over appoint
ments and removals to mere influence and
favoritism. If it is the right of ths worthiest
claimant to gain the appointment, and the in
terest of the people to bestow it upon him,
it would seem clear that a wise ana
just method of ascertaining person
al fitness for office must needs be
an important and permanent function of every
{ust
and wise Government. It has long since
ecome impossible in the great offices for thcee
having tho duty of nomination and appoint
ment to personally examine into the individual
qualifications of more than a small proportion
of those seeking office, and with the enlarge
ment of civil service that proportion must con
tinue to become less. In the earlier years of
the Government the subordinate offices were s:
few in number that it was easy for those mak
ing appointments and promotions to personally
ascertain the meritB of the candidates.
Party managers and methods had then
become powerful agents of coercion hos
tile to the free and just exercise of
the appointing power. A large and
responsible part of the duty of restoring the
civil service to the desired purity and efficiency
rests upon the President and it has been my
purpose to do what is within my power to ad
vance Buch prudent and gradual measures of
reform as will most surely and rapidly brine
about that radical change of system essential
to make our administrative methods satisfac
tory to a free and intelligent people by a proper
exeicise of authority. It is in the power of
the Executive to do much to promote such a
reform, but it cannot be too clearly understood
that nothing adequate can be accomplished
without co-operation on the part of Congress
and considerate and intelligent support
among the people. Reforms which challenge
the generally-accepted theories of parties and
demand changes in the methods of departments
are not the work of a day. Their permanent
foundation must be laid in sound principles
and in an experience whioh demonstrates their
wisdom and exposes the errors of their adver
saries. Every worthy officer desires to make
his official action au honor to his country. But
tbe people themselves, far more than their offi
cers in publio. station, are interested in
a pure, economical, and vigorous admin
istration. By laws enacted io 1853 and
1855. and now in substance incorporated in
the Revised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary
appointments to the several subordinate grades
in the great departments was condemned, and
examinations as to capacity, to be conducted
by the Departmental Boards of Examiners,
.were- provided for and made conditions of ad
mission to tbe publio service. These statutes
are a decision Dy Congress that examinations
of some sort as to attainments and capacity are
essential to the well-being of the public ser
vice.. The important questions since the en
actment of these laws have been as to the char
acter of these examinations, and whether offi
cial favor and partisan influence or com
mon right and merit were to, control the
access to the examinations. In practioe these
examinations have not always been open to
worthy persons generally who might wish to
bo examined. Official favoritism and partisan
influence, as a rule, appear to have designated
those who alone were permitted to go before
the examining boards, subjecting even the exam
iners to a pressure from the friends of the can
didates very difficult to resist As a conse
quence, the standard of admission fell below
that which the publio interest demanded.
It was almost, inevitable that a system
which .provided for various separate
boards of eixaminers, with no oom
mon supervision or uniform method of
procedure, should result in confusion, in
consistency, aud inadequate tests of capacity
highly detnmental to the publio interest.
A further and more radical change was
obviously required. In the annual message
of December, 1870, my predecessor declared
that "there is no duty which so much
I embarrasses tbe Executive and beade of
departments as that of appointments^ ccr Is
there any such arduous and thankless labor im
poseaon Senators And Representatives as that

capacity as a board, have been known as the
Omi Service Commission Congress for two
years appropriated the money needed for the
compensation and for the expense of carrying
on the work of the commission. It appears
from the report of the permission, submitted
to th^Pjcfldeat in April, 1874, that exanuna*
tions had been held iu various sections of the
and that an appropriation of about
f25,000 would bo* required to meet the annual
expenses, including salaries, involved in
discharging tbe duti^ of the commis
sion. The fOport was transmitted to
£ofigreBs by special message of April 18,
favorable comment
upon the labors cf the commission: "If sus
tained by Congress, I have no doubt the rul
can, after the experience gained, be so improved
and enforced as to still more materially benefit
the publio service, and relievo the Executive,
members of Congress, and the heads of de
partments from influences prejudicial to good
adiuinlatration. Tho rules, as thev have hith
erto been enforced* have resulted fwneficiallv,
as is shown by the opinions of the members of
tho Cabinet and their subordinates in
the departments, and in that opinion 1
concur." And in tke annual message of
[December or tho same year Similar views are
expressed, and an appropriation for continuing
the work of :the Commission again advise 1.
The appropriation was not made, and, as a con
sequence, the active work of the commission
was suspended, leaving the commission itseL
still in existence without the means therefore of
causing qualifications to be tested in any sys
tematic manner, or securing for the public ser
vice the advantages or competition upon any
extensive plan. I recommended in my annual
message of December 1877, the making of an
appropriation for the resumption of the
work of the commission. In the meantime,
however, comoetitivo examinations, nndcL
many embarrassments, have been conducted
within limited spheres in the executive depart
ments in Washington, and in a number of the
custom houses and postoftices of the principal
oities of the country, with a view to further
test thoir effects, and in every instanco thev
have been found to be as salutary as they are
stated to have bsbn undsr the administration
of n# predecessor. I think the economy,
purity and efficiency of tho public service
would be greatly promoted by their systematic
introduction, wherever practicable, throughout
the entire civil service of the Government,
together with ample provision for their general
supervision, in order to secure consistency and
uniform justice.
Reports from the Secretary of the Interior,
from tbe Postmaster General, from the Post
master in the city of New York, where such
examinations have been some time on tpaiL
and also from the Collector of the Port, the
Naval Officer and the Surveyor in that city,
and from the Postmasters and Collectors in
several of the other large cities, show that the
competitive system, where applied, has in
various ways contributed to improve the
public service. The reports show' tbat the
results have been salutary in a marked
degree, and that the general application cf
similar rules cannot fail to be of decided benefit
to the service. The reports of the Government
officers in the city of New York especially
bear deeided testimony to the utility ot
open competitive examinations in their respect
ive offices, showing that these examinations,
and ihe excellent qualifications of those admit
ted to the service through them, have lia«l a
marked incidental effect upon tho persons pre
viously in the service, and particularly upon
jhose aspirins
,n
i11""0 vo« been
on the part of those latter an increased inter
est in the work, and a desire to extend acquaint
ance with it beyond a particular desk, and thus
the morale of the entire force has been raided.
The examinations have been attended by many
citizens, who have had an opportunity to thor
oughly investigate the scope and character of
the tests, and the method of determining the
results, and these visitors have, without excep
tion, approved tho modes employed, and several
of them have publiely attested their
favorablo opinion. Upon such considerations,
I deem it my duty to renew the recommenda
tion contained in my annual message of Decem
ber, 1877, requesting Congress to make the
necessary appropriations for the resumption of
the work of the Civil Service Commission.
Economy will be promoted by authorizing a
moderate compensation to persons in the DUb
lio service who may perform extra labor upon
or under the commission as the Esecutiro may
direct. I am convinced that if a just anil
defiiite test of merit is enforced for
admission to the public service, and in
making promotions, such abuses as removal
without good cause and partisan and offi
cial interference with the proper exorcise of
the appointing power will in large measure
disappear. There are other adminiitiative
abuses to which the attention of Congress
should be asked in this connection. Mere
partisan appointment and the constant peril of
removal without cause very naturally lead to
an absorbing and mischievous political aetivitv
on the part of those thus appointed, which not
)nly interferes with the due discharge of offi
cial duty, but is incompatible with the freedom
of elections. Not without warrant in the view
if several of my predecessors ia the Presiden
tial office, directly in accordance with the law of
1871 already cited, I endeavored, by regulation
made on the 22d of June, 1877, to put some
reasonable limits to such abuses. It may
not be easy, and it may never, perhaps, be
necessary to define with precision the proper
limit of political action on the part of Federal
officers. But, while their right to hold and
freely express their opinions cannot be ques
tioned, it iB very plain that they should neither
be allowed to dovote to other subjects the time
needed for the proper discharge of their official
duties, nor to use the authority of their office to
enforce their own opinions, or to coerce tho
political action of those who hold different
opinions.' Reasons of justice and public policy
quite analogous to those which forbid the use
of official power for the oppression of the pri
vate citizen impoge upon the Government the
duty of protecting its officers and agents from
arbitrary exaotions. In whatever aspect con
sidered, the practice of making levies for
party purposes upon the salaries of:
officers is highly demoralizing to the public
service aud discreditable to the country.
Though an officer should be as free any other
citizen to give his money in aid of his opinions
or his party, he should also be as free as any
othet citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If
salaries are bnt & fair mmpomatinn for tfiA
time ana labor of the officers, it is gross injus
tice to levy tax upon them. If they are made
excessive in order that thev may bear the tax,
the excess is an indirect robbery of the public
foods. I recommend, therefore, such a re
vision and extension of the present statutes as
shall secure to those in every grade of official
life or public employment the protection with
which a great and enlightened nation shall
guard those who are faithful in its service..
Staking Fond.
The polioy of the United States steadily ad
hered to from the adoption of the constitution
has been to avoid the creation of a national
debt, and when, from necessity, in the time of
war, debts have been created, they have been
beeu paid off on the return of pease as rapidly
as possible. With this view, and for this pur
pose, it is recommended that the existing laws
for tbe accumulation of a sinking fund suffi
cient to extinguish the publio debt within a
limited period be maintained. If any change
of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed
necessary by Congress, it is suggested that ex
perience has shown that a duty can be placed
on tea and coffee which will not enhance the
price of those articles to tbe consumer, and
which will add several millions of dollars an
nually to the treasury.
The Courts.
The business of the Supreme Court is
at present largely in arrears. It can
not be expected tbat more muses
can be decided than are now disposed of in its
annnal session, or that by any assiduity the dis
tinguished Magistrates who compose the court
can accomplish more than is now done,
In the courts of many of the'circuits, also, the
business has increased to such an extent that
the delay of justice will oall the attention of
Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is
believed that afl is done in each cir
cuit whioh can be fairly expeoted from its
judicial force. The evils arising from delay
are less heavily felt by the United
States than by private suitors, as its
causes are advanced by the courts when
it ia seen that they involve tho discussion
of 'questions of a publio character. Tbe remedy
suggested by the Attorney Geneinl is the ap
pointment of additional Circuit Judges, and the
creation of an intermediate Court of Errors and
Appeals, wLich shall relieve the Supreme Court
of apart of its jurisdiction, while a larger force
is also obtained for the performance of circuit
duties. I reoommend wis suggestion to the
consideration of Congress. It would seem to
afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if
(en additional Circuit Judges are appointed, an
expenditure at the present rate of salaries of
not more than #60,000 a year, which would cer
tainly be small in comparison with tbe objects
to be attained.'
Foreign Belatlons.
Our relations with.,iorelgh countries have
Mhtihued peaceful. With Great Britain there
kio still unsettled questions, glowing on* ol tho
local laws of the maritime provinces, and the
action or provincial authorities deemed to bo in
derogation of rights secured by treaty to Amer
ican fishermen. The United States Minister in
London ha6 been instructed to present a do
mana for 1105^)5.055 in VioHr of thd damages
teoaifed by American citizen! at Fortunft bay
On the 6th day of January, 1878. The subject
has been taken into consideration by the Brit
ish Government, and an early replv is an
ticipated. Upon the completion of
tit# necessary preliminary examina
tions the subject of. out participation
in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by
treaty, will at once be brought to the attention
of the British Government with a view to ai
early and normanent settlement ot the whole
question, wnich was only temporarily adjusted
by the treaty of Washing,ton. Jj!
Sorts bavo
been made to obtain tbe reittoval of restrictions
found injurious to the exportation of cattio to
the United Kingdom. Some correspondence
has also occurred with regard to the rescue and

which has resulted in important modifications
of ths previous regulations of the Dominion
Government on the subject, in tue intereet of
humanity and commerce.
Iu accordance vruu uie juiuv loauiutiuu of
the last session of Congress, Commissioners
were appointed to represent the United States at
the two International Exhibitions in Australia,
one of which is now in progress at Sydney
and the other to be held next year at Mel
bourne. A desire has been expressed by ur
merchants and manufacturers interested in the
important and growing trade with Australia
that an increased provision should be made by
Congress for the representation of our indus
tries at tho MilboUrne Exhibition of next year,
and thb subject is Respectfully submitted ts
your faVorable ctiiisideratloh.
The assent Of the Government
haB
been given
to the landing on the ooast of Massachusetts of
anew and independent transatlantic cable be
tween France, by way of the Frenoh Island
of St. Pierre and this conntry, subject to any
future legislation of Congress on the subject.
The conditions imposed, before allowing the
sonnection with our shore to be established,
are such as to secure its competition with any
sxisting or future lines of marine cable, and
preclude amalgamation therewith to provide
for entire equality of rights to our Gov
ernment and people with those of France
in the use of the cAble* and prevent any
exclusive possession of the privilege as ac
corded by France to the disadvantage of any
future cable communication between France
and the United States which may be projected
and accomplished by our citizcns. An im
portant reduction of the present rates of
communication with Europe, felt to be too bur
densome to the interests of our commerce,
must necossarily flow from the eetiblislimeut
of this competing line. The attention of Con
gress was drawn to tho propriety of some gen
eral regulation by Congress of the whole sub
ject of transmarine cables by my pred
ecessor in his meBBage of Deo. 7, 1675, and I
respectfully submit to your consideration the
importance of Congressional! action in this
matter.
The questions of grave importance with
Spain, growing out of the incidents of the
Cuban insurrection, have been for the most
part happily and honorably settled. It may
reasonably ne anticipated that the commission
now sitting in Washington for the decision of
private cases in this connection will soon be
able to bring its labors to a conclusion. The
long-standing question of the East Florida
claims has lately been renewed as a subject of
correspondence, and may possibly require
Congressional action for its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to
Consular rights and privileges Bimilar to thoso
with other ppwers has been signed and ratified,
and the ratifications were exchanged on the
31st of July last.
Negotiations for extradition treaties with the
Netherlands and with Denmark are now in
progress.
Some questions with Switzerland in regard to
pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but
also occurred with respect to an asserted claim
by SwieB municipal authorities to exercise tutel
age over the persons and property of Swiss citi
zens naturalized in this country. It is poseible
this may require adjustment by treaty. With
the German empire frequent questions aiiae in
connection with the subjects of naturalization
and expatriation, but the Imperial Government
has constantly manifested a dosire to fctricth
maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations
in regard to them.
In oonSequence of the omission of CocgrfSh
to provide for a diplomatic representation ai
Athens, the legation to Greece \s been with
drawn. There is now no channel
of diploma: ic
communications between tho two countries,
and the expediency of providing for one in
como form is submitted to Congress. Rela
tions with Austria, Prussia, Italy, Portugal,
Turkey, and Belgium continue amicible,
and marked by no incident of especial impor
tance.
A change of the personal head of the Govern
ment of Egypt has taken place. No change,
however, has occurred in tbe relations between
gypt and the United States.
The action of the Egyptian Government in
presenting to the city of New York one of the
ancient obelisks which possess such historical
interest is highly appreciated as a generous
mark of international regard. If prosperity
should attend the enterprise of its transporta
tion across tbe Atlantic, its erection in a con
spicuous position in the chief commercial city
or the nation will be soon accomplished
The treaty recently mads between Japan and
the United States in regard to the revision ol
former treaties, it is now believed, will be fol
lowed by Similar action on the part of other
treaty powers. The attention or Congress is
again invited to the subject of the indemnity
funds received some years since from Japan
and China, which, witn their accumulated in
terest, now amount to considerable sums, If
any part of these funds is justly due to
American citizens, they should receive it
promptly, and whatever may have been re
ceived by the Government in excess of strict
ly-just demands should in some form be re
turned to the nations to whom it equitably
belongs. The Government of China has
signified its willingness to consider the
question of the emigration of its subjects to
the United States with a dispassionate fairness
and to co-operate in such measure as may tend
0 prevent injurious consequences to tbe United
States. The negotiations aro still proceeding,
and will be pressed with diligence. A question
having arisen between China and Japan about
the Looohco islands, the United States Govern
ment has taken measures to inform those pow
ers of its readiness to extend its good offices
for the maintenance of peace, if they shall mu
tually deem it desirable, and find it practicable
to avail themselves of the proffer.

nations on each side of the Rio Grande, nnner
the instructions of their respective Govern

confident expectation of the continuance of the
prevalence of quiet on the border of the two
countries.
The third installment of the award against
Mexioo under the Claims Commission of July
4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put

leads me to anticipate
an expansion of our trade
with Mexioo. and an increased contribution of

Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia fa

This is especially fortunate in view of the fact
that the question of an interoceanic canal has
recently assumed an important aspect, and is
now nnder discussion with the Central Ameri
can countries, through whose territory the
canal by the Nicaragua route would have to
pass. It is trusted that enlightened statesman
ship on their part will see that the early prose
cution of such a work will largely inure to the
benefit, not only of their own citizens and those
of the United States, but of the commerce of
ths civilized world. It is not donbted that,
should the work be undertaken under the pro
tective auspices of the United States, and upon
satisfaotocy concessions for the right of way
and its security by the Central American Gov
ernments, (he capital for its completion would
readily be furnished from this country and
Europe, which might, failing such guarantees,

Chili have also been strengthened by tha
reception of ia Ministry from tbat country.
The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili
still continues. The United Slates has not
deemed it proper to interpose in the matter,
further than to oonvey to all the Governments
concerned the assurance that the friendly offi

the restoration of peace upon an honorable
basis will be extended in case the.belligerents
shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cor

A provision for regular and more frequent

extension of crif carrying trade.
A recent revolution in Venezuela hafl been

The Indians.
The reports of the Secretary of tho Interior
and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
setting forth tho present state of our rolhtion*
with tho Indiau tribes on our territory, the
measures taken to advance the civilization am!
prosperity, and the progress alroady achioved
|y them, will be found of more than ordinary
interest. The general conduct )f our Indian
population his been HO sa tisfack ry that the oc
eurrenco of two disturbances which resulted
in bloodshod and destruction of property is
all the more to be lamented. Tho history of
the outbreak on the White River Ute Reserva
tion in Western Colorado has become so
familiar by elaborate reports in the public
press that its remarkable incidents need not be
stated here in detail. It is expected that the
settlement of this difficulty wdl lead to such
arrangements as will prevent fnrtner hostile
contests between tho Indians and tho border
aottlements in Western Colorado. The other
tisturbances occurred at the Mescalero Agency
•i New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a
small band of marauders, after committing
many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a
military force, made his way across the
'•lexican border, end is now on a
foreign soil. While these occurrences,
in which a comparatively small number ol
Indiana were engaged, are most deplorable, a
vast majority of our Indian population have
fully justified the expectations of thcHo v, luj
believo that by humane and peaceful influ
ences the Indian can be led te abandon tbe
babits of savage life, and to develop a capacity
for useful and clvilizcd occuojitims. Wl :'.'
they have already accomplished is Shown in ti
imrsnit of agricultural and mechanical work.
The remarkable success which has attended
the experiment of employing as freighters a
class of Indians hitherto counted among the
wildest and most intractable, and the
general and urgent desire expressed by
them for the education of their cliildren, may
be taken as sufficient proof that they wi.l be'
found capable of accomplishing much more
if they continue to bo wisely and fairly guided.
The Indian policy akotched in tho report of the

Last spring information was received of tbe
organization of an extensive movement in the
Western States, the object of which was the oc
oupation by unauthorized persons of certain
lands in ihe Indiau Territory ceded by the
Cherokees to the Government for the purpose
of settlement by other Indian tribes. On tbe
29th of April I issued a proclamation warning
all persons against participation in such an at
tempt, and by the co-operation cf a military
force theinvasion was promntly checked. It if
my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian
inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent
of the Executive: but it would bo un
wise to ignore tne fact that a Territory
so large and so fertile, with a population so
sparse, and so great a wealth of unused re
sources, will be found more exposed to the rop
etr.ion of such attempts as happened this year
when the surrounding States were most densely
settled, and the westward movement of our
population looks still more eagerly for fresh
lands to occnpy. Undor snoh circumstances
the difficulty of maintaining tbe Indian Terri
tory in its present state will greatly increase, and
the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to
prepare for such a contingency. I therefore
fully approve of the advice given to them by
the Secretary of the Interior on a recent
occasion to divide among themselves, in sev
eralty, as large a quantitv of their lands.as
they can cultivate, to acquire individual title
in fee, instead of their present tribal owner
ship in common, and consider in what manner
the balance of their lands may be disposed of
by the Government for their benefit By
adopting such a olicy they would more cer
tainly eecuro for themselves the value of their
poraessions, ana at tne same time promote
their progress in civilization and prosperity,
than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present
state of things in the Territorv.
The quo3tion whether a change in the control
of the Indian service should be made was, in
tho Forty-fifth Congress, referred to a joint
committee of both houses for inquiry and
report In my last annual message I expressed
the hope that the decision of tho question, then
in prospect, would arreat further agitation of
this subject, such agitation being apt to pro
duce a disturbing effect upon the service as well
a the Indians themselves. Since then, the com
mittee having reported, the question has been
decided in the negative by a vote in the
House of Bepreeentatives. For the reason
here stated, and in view of the fact that fur
ther uncertainty on this point will be calculated
to obstruct other much-needed legislation, to
weaken the discipline of the service and to un
settlo salutary measures now in progresBfor
the government and improvement of the In
dians, I respectfully recommend that the de
cision arrived at by Congress at its last session
be permitted to stand.

The Secretary of War further reports that
the work for the improvement in the South
pass of tho Mississippi river, under contract
with Mr. James B. Eftds, made in pursuance of
an act of Congress, has been proaeonted dur
ing the past year with a greater measure of
success in the attainment of results tban dur
ing any previous year. Ths channel through
Shb South pass, which, at tho beginning of
Jone, iSTfij had the depth of only Beven and a
half feet of water, bad, on the 8th of July,
LS79, a minimum depth of twenty-six feet, hav
ing a width of riot lt-ss than twenty-five and a
central depth of thirty feet Payments have
been made in accordance with tho statute as
the work progressed, amounting ixi the
aggregate to $4,£50,01:0, and further payments
will become due, ea provided by the statute and
in tho event of succc?n in maintaining the
channel now secured. The reports of the Gen
eral of tho Army and of his subordinates pre
sent a full and detailed account of tbe military
operations for the repression of hostilities
arsoag the Indians of tho Ute and Apache
tribes, and praise is Justly awarded to the offi
cers and troops engaged for promptness, skill,
and courage" displayed. The past year has
been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet
on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to
bolieve that the efforts of this Government and
Moxico to mamtain order in that region will
prove eminently successful.

The report of the Sucreiary of tho Ravv
shows continued improvement in that ch

chargeable to tho year, after deducting tho
amount of tlse^o special appropriations,
were 13,"4".,817.79 but this is subject to
a reduction of $:28-S,?25.OT, that amount
having boon drawn upon warrants, but
not paid out during the year. Tho amount of

$14,864,147.05, whioh exceed the appropria
tions for the present fiscal year §301,85*7.28.
The reason for this increase is explained
in the Secretary's report The appro
priations available for tho present fiscal
year are §14,5(W,i:50.( 7, which will, in tho
opinion of tiio Secretary, answer all the ordina

by tiio country while tbe citizens of Utah, in
very considerable number, uphold a practicn
ft'Iiieli ia condemned as a crime by the laws Oi
all civilized communities throughout the world.
Tbe law for tho suppicftsimi of ibi.-i offense was
enacted with great unanimity by Congrt Si more
tban eoven feon years ago, but has remained
until recently a dead letter ia tbo Territory o?
Utah because of the peculiar difficulties attend
ing its enforcement. The opinion widely pro
vailed among tho citizens of Utah that the law
was in contravention of the constitutional guar
antee of religions freedom.
This objection ia now removed. Tho Su
rjreme Court of the United States has dccidecl
the law to be within the legislative power
of Congress, and binding, as a rule of
action, for all who resided within tho
Territories. There is no longer any reason for
lelav or hesitation in its enforcement. It
nhould be firmly and effectively executed.
not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it
should bo amende:!, and, in aid of the
purpose in view. I recommend that more com
prehensive and more searching methods for
preventing as well aa punishing this crime be
provided. If necessary to secure obedience to
the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the
rights and privileges of citizenship in the
Territories of the United States may be with
held or withdrawn from those who violate or
oppose the enforcement of ths law on this
mbject
Legal Tenders.
The retirement from circulation of United
States notes, with the capacity of legal tender
in private contracts, ia a step to be taken in our
progress to a fair and stable curreucv, which
should be accepted aa tbe policy and duty of
the Government and tho interest and security of
the people. It is my firm conviction tbat the
issuo of the legal-tender paper money, based
wholly upon the authority and credit of the
Government, except in extreme emerg
ency, is without warrant in tho con
stitution, and a violation of sound finan
cial principles. Tbo issue of United States
notes during the late civil war, with the
capacity of legal tender between private indi
viduals, was not authorized exeopt as a means
.if rescuing the country from imminent peril.
The circulation of these notes as paper money
for any protracted period of time after the ac
complishment of tlr.s purpose was not contem
plated by the fr. mers of tbe laws under which
they were issued. They anticipated the re
demption and withdrawal of these notes at the
earliest practicable period consistent with tho
attainment of tho object for whioh they were
provided.

doncy of the proposition for unity of action be
tween tho United States and the principal com
mercial nations of Europe to effect a perma
nent system for the equality of gold and
silver in tho recognized money of tbe

refrain from new legislation on the general
subject The great ievivai of trade, in
ternal and foreign, will supply during
tho coming year its own instructions, whioh
may well be awnited before attempting further
experimental measures with the coinage. I
would, however, sirongly urge upon Congress
the importance of authorizing the Secretary of
the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver
dollars upon the present legal ratio. Themarket
value of the silver dollar being uniformly and
largely less tban the market value of the gold
dollar, it is obviously impracticably to" main
tain them at par with each other if both are
coincd without limit. If the cheaper coin is
forced into circulation it will, if coined without
limit, become tbe sole standard of value, and
fcnus defeat the desired object, which ia a cur
rency of both gold and silver, which shall be of
equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the
universally-recognized money of the world.
Capitol Ltbnuy,
To preserve and perpetuate the national lit

tbe national Legislature. Tho library gathered
at the Capitol still remains unprovided with any
suitable accommodations
for its rapidly-increas

the collection, increased, as it is, by the deposits
mado r.nder tho laws of copyright, by domes
tic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific
library of the Smithsonian Institution, call
boat once adequate and fire-proof. _The loca
tion of such publio buildings, which should
provide for the pressing necessities of the
present and for the vast increase of the^ na
tion's books in the future, is a matter which
addresses itself to tho discretion of Congress.
It is earnestly recommended
a* a measure
which should unite all suffrages^ and which
should no longer be delayed.
