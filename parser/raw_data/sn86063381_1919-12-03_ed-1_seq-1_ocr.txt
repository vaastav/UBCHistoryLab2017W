Bemidji's Quota Is $1,200 and
Should Met by Gener-
ous Purchases
Bed Cross Christmas seals will be
placed on the local market early Fri
day morning, and their sale will
carry a message of Christmas cheer
m millions of packages mailed in the
United States. The sale price is one
cent per seal, and every cent, aside
from the cost of manufacture, will be
turned over by the Red Cross to aidV
in the fight against tuberculosis.
D. S. Mitchell, director of the Be
midji campaign, reported this after
moon that this year's receipts promise
to exceed those of any previous sea
son. He bases this opinion on the
interest being taken in the campaign
and the advance call for seals.
At two meetings of the sale com
mittees, held yesterday afternoon,
plans for the campaign were corner
pleted and those in charge believe
that the $1,200 quota will be over
-subscribed. JL.

dthat a serious curtailment of alj. rail
away, service is. to go into, effect al
,most at once and to continue from
fifteen to twenty days.
The curtailment may affect nearly
J50 per cent of the trains now run
ning and is due to the coal shortage.
It means that where there are two
trains a day carrying parcel post
matter to and from certain points
there will be only one train during

amount of -extra work for the rail
way mail clerks and for the railway
mail terminal hands.
Christmas parcels should be
wrapped securely, plainly addressed
^nd mailed early. They shouro' be
labeled "Not to be opened until
Christmas" or something to that ef
fect*. The wrapping, plain address
and early mailing should be given
special attention.
The sending of Christmas packages
early not only means
promptydelivery
but it also insures
the safet of the
Christmas present which is always
imperilled by congested conditions in

CITY WILL REMOVE
IRON FROM ITS WATER
Springfield, 111 Dec. 3 The
hitherto accepted theory that iron in
drinking water improves its value as
such has no inducement for Spring
fielders.
The city commission is considering
the expenditure of $150,000 for a
plant to remove the iron. The city
fathers take the position that "de-
ironed" water not only is better for
drinking purposes but reduces the de
preciation of all equipment.

"TIPS" FO SETTLERS
IN CUT-OVER REGIONS
Many .Farmers From Other
Parts of Country Casting
Eyes in This Direction
By W. P. Kirkwood.
(Editor, Office of Publication, Uni
versity Farm, St. Paul.)
St. Paul, Dec. 3.Many farmers in
other parts of the country are cast
ing interested eyes at the fine farm
lands of northern Minnesota lands
where clover, like hope in the human
breast, springs eternal. The only
reason why more interested farmers
do not move to this clover and sure
crop country is the fact that large
numbers of them are lacking in ex
perience in handling such lands.
They are not quite certain that they
know just how to take hold.
For this reason some "advice to
the settler" was recently prepared by
the department of agriculture of the
University of Minnesota. This "ad^,
vice," based on the practical experi
ence of men in the field, first warns
against alarm at the use of the word
"settler" Occupying the lands of
Northern Minnesota need not mean
pioneering in the old sense. It may
mean, on the contrary"good lands
on roads near good towns, with good
schools, in good communities,- and
with _goq4 neighbors.**
Advice Boiled Down.
Try to provide for from |800 to
$1,500 for development work after
making the first payment on the land.
If this can't be done, however, and
you are barely making a living,
move any way.
See the land before buying.. Ex
amine the whole tract carefully
Locate on a road and not too far
from neighbors. Good land can be
found in such locations.
Eighty acres in the cut-over region
make a good farm for a man and an
average fifthTly in which are some
boys to help. Forty acres will be
enough for a man with no such help.
If funds are available without crip
pling working capital, a farm of 160
acres should be secured.
Spring is the best time to move to
such a piece of land. This gives op
portunity to get ready for the com
ing winter.
Qnly a small amount of stock
S:indfrom
hould be taken to a new farm of the
two to four good milking
cows, one team of horses, a brood
sow, and a few chickens.
Potatoes and vegetables of all
kinds for the home cellar, and
plenty of feed, especially roughage,
for the stock for winter should be the
aim of the first year's cropping.
A pasture should be opened by
clearing away brush and logs, disk
ing or working up the soil among the
stumps, and sowing a little clover,
timothy and blue grass seed.
If enough land is open and a mar
ket is near a small field of potatoes
should he put in
It isn't necessary to wait until
stumps are removed to put in a crop*
Often the brush can be cut and
burned,and good crops obtained
among the stumpsespecially hay
and pasture crops.
iBy the adoption of such a system
the cut-over farm can be made to
yield a living while being brought to
full development
NOTED COMPTROLLER
RESIGNS POSITION
(By United Press.)
Winnipeg, Dec. 3.J. Gordon
Steele, who "wrecked" the capitol
building for the government, has re
signed as comptroller-general of the
province to accept a position in New
York City.
Steele was appointed by Hon. Ed
ward Brown, treasurer to investigate
the capitol building "scandal" and
his investigation resulted in the jail
ing of the Roblin government, then
in control Sir Rodman Roblin,
former premier, is now operating a
garage on a back street of Winnipeg.
The Steele investigation disclosed
the theft of large sums in the build
ing of the 15,000,000 capitol through
faulty foundations and upper walls.
As a result of the battle the capitol
is still uncompleted and the province
has lost large sums through this fact.
Completion of the buildings has ne
cessitated expenditure of nearly |4,-
000,000 additional.
