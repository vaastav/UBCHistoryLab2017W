Men Rather Than Platforms.
Should Biyan and lloosevelt be
the presidential candidates nextyear,
it will be difficult to find any one
who will care to hear a discussion
over the platforms of either party.
These men are bigger than any par
ty platform.
At Kansas City on the 5lh inst. a
jury in the case of the State against
the International Harvester company
reached a virdict against the com
pany on 42 counts. This verdict
charges the company with being a
trust and entering into unlawful
combination to control the price of
harvesting machinery and to force
dealers to handle its products exclu
sively. The maximum penally which
may be imposed is $
1,000 on each
of the 42 counts.
During the month of November of
this year the issue of bank currency
was increased $47,428.94, and this
inflation of the currency by the pres
ent administration has the unquall
fiedapproval of the republican states
men who helped Cleveland to
maintain his Bcarce money policy
during (he financial panic of eleven
years ago. At that time it was
claimed that confidence and not
money was what the country needed,
and Cleveland and the country be
came the victims of these confidence
men.
The Recall of the Ambassadors.
Japan and Great Britain are allies,
and Japan and Great Britiau have
both recalled their ambassadors from
Washington. They will sail for
their respective homes about the
time our battleships start on their
voyage for the Pacific.
What does this meam?
These recalls certainly have ref
erence to the relations between this
country and Japan, and at best they
are not friendly acts but, possibly,
no more unfriendly than the dispatch
of our great fleet to the Pacific
Ocean.
The Naval Power of the United States
and Japan.
In warship tonnage this country
is second among the great naval
powers, Great Britian alone being
greater.
This country's ships have an ag
'gregate tonnage of 011,610 tons,
while those of Japan have only 374.
701 tons. But Japan has mora offi
cers and enlisted men in her navy
than this country. We have only
34,002 officers and men, while Japan
has 41,070. The United States has
22 battle ships to Japan's 11, and in
a big naval battle the big well
armored battle ship is supposed to
be a decisive factor. Then again
this country has 51 armored and
unarmored cruisers to Japan's 30
But in the smaller class of 'vessels
such as torpedo boats and torpedo
boat destroyers, Japan is far better
equipped than the United States
Of that class of boats Japan has no
less than 131, while this country
has only 48.
It would seem as though the na
val strength of this country was suf
ficient to prevent our being attacked
by Japan. But ships and gu)6 are
only one element of naval strength.
The men behind the guns count
largely in every battle. The Japa
nese may calculate from the ease
with which they destroyed the na
vies of China and Russia that they
could defeat the United States and
become the dominant power in.the
Pacific Ocean.
It seems almost incredible that
England would encourage her ally
to deliberately pick a quarrel with
the United States, but the events
of the past year are not free front
doubt on that subject. Atany_rato
oar great fleet will not reach our
western coast a day too soon. May
it prove a peacemaker in the great
est of the oceans.
With our regular army far below
the number of men provided for by
lr.w, with its_desertions about equal
to its enlistments, and with public
officials seriously considering the
advisability of resorting to consori]
tionto bring the army up to its
proper complement, what rank non
sense it is for the Senate to spend
a momenta time discussing the le
commend for the elimination of
the black regiments. Roosevelt's
hasty order in the Brownsville affair
commenced this agitation, and the
sooner it is ended the better it is for
all concerned. Before the rebel forts
at Petersburg and on many other
battlefields the American, negro has
demonstrated his qualifications as a
soldier.^
Bryan and a United Demccta'ic 'Party.
Governor Cummings thinks that
it will he Bryan and a unit^iV dem
ocracy next year. \TJieT Governor
attended the RiversVnd Ilariiors
Congress in Washington^ast week,
and had a good opportunilV to feel
the political pulse of the chjuiitry.
On his way home he stopped off
in Chicago and in a political dis
cussion in that city he is reported
to have said:
"The next presidential campaign
with Wm. J. Bryan as the canidate
of the united democratic party, and
the indications are
Buck
will be the
case, will be closer than we have
had for some time."
Editor Murphy at the "Nation's Heart.
Louis Murphy, editor of the Tele
graph-Herald, attended the Rivers
and Harbors Congress at the nation
al capital last week, and interviewed
a score or more of men who have
their lingers on the nation's heart,
where the pulse beats strongest,
He found that Roosevelt was dis
cussing the third term proposal with
his callers, which would indicate
that he might be induced to again
become a candidate but Mr. Mur
phy Concluded from all he heard that
Roosevelt would not be his party's
candidate for- the presidency next
year.
Mr. Murphy thinks that Hughes
will not be the republican candidate
if lloosevelt can prevent it. Mr,
Roosevelt has reason to suspect the
loyalty of the governor of New Yoik
to his policies which ho has borrowed
from the democrats and he does
not intend to permit Mr. Hughs to
succeed him.
A Map as False as Satan is Wicked.
The New York World is publish
ing a map, whenever it can think of
nothing worse to run against Mr.
Bryan, which purports to show the
condition to which Mr. Bryan has
reduced the democratic party. On
this map the democratic states and
territories are white and the repub
lican states and territories black
but the contention of the World that
Mr. Bryan is responsible for the fact
that much the larger part of its map
is black is false—unqualifiedly false.
Grover Cleveland and his Wall
Street advisers, the World among
the number, are largely responsible
for the color of the map.
Mr. Bryan had nothing to do with
the success or failure of democratic
candidates in 1894. That was at
time when the World and its polit
ical' idol, Grover Cleveland, were
running tho affairs of state. At the
congressional elections that year the
magnificent democratic represents
tion of 219 members elected in 1892
was cut down to 104. Did Bryan
have anything to do with that defeat?
Was Bryan a democratic loader
responsible for democratic policies
before he made his great speech
the Chicago convention in 1890?
Before Mr. Bryan became respon
sible for any democratic policy,
Cleveland and the policies advocat
ed by the World had practically de
stroyed the democratic party.
At the last elections held in the
severaljstates prior to the year 1890,
the democrats had lost in 30 and
won in but 9. That was the polit
ical map of the country when Bryan
ism, as the World terms genuine
democracy, commenced the work of
reorganization. FrAm that low ebb
the party has had to build. In the
first Bryan campaign, that of 1890,
great gains were made. Tho party
went into the contest of that year
with but 9 states and came out'with
22. The republicans commenced
the campaign of that year with 35
states in their column, and came out
with but 22. The electoral vote of
Kentucky
waB
devided that year and
not counted for either party. And
the Worl^ and Cleveland did all in
their power to defeat the democratic
ticket that year. These facts are
well known to the World, and if it
had any desire to be fair it would
make its map show tho states car
ried by Bryan when Bryan was a
candidate.
At the last 'national election the
democrats nominated a man for the
presidency who was satisfactory to
the World, and he was the worst
beaten candidate ever nominated by
the democratic party, Horace Greeley
not excepted. The map which th
World is publishing is a map show
ing conditions when its advice
followed, and not a map showing the
results of an election when Bryan
was a candidate. The World is a
democrfitic hoodoo.
Might Have Been Written By Bryan
From tbe New V'ork World,
Mr. Bryan approves President
Rio level
t's message. He could not
help it. Tli(re is so much in it that
lie had stood for and might have
written.
The Financial Situation.
In tlie language of Clrover Cleve
land "A condition and not a theory
confronts us." F(.r a correct solu
tion of tho problems of the present,
an iinderslamling of past conditions
is necessary. Kvidently the com
inonly accepted theories of events
aud conditions in the financial world
during the past few years was large
ly incorrect, otherwise the present
condition could not have come abrfut,
It would be'profitless lo revive the
discussions of 1890 when it is fairly
nviflent. from 11 to nniiTKonf t-vf-pt« tljg
Republican party lias completely
failed to fun isli a satisfactory solu
tion of the problems since confront
ing it. That discussion and events
since then seem to have removed
some facts from the realm of con
troversy. First, financial prosperi
ty depends on there being a suffi
cient quantity of money as well as
upon its quality. Second, Stability
of prices and market conditions de
pends not so much on confidence as
a sound basis for confidence.
Third, the banks are the greatest
medium of commercial activity and
upon the safe and orderly transac
tion of their business depends the
prosperity of the entire country. It
necessary then that the banks be
supplied with a sufficient amount of
money of undoubted quality and
that their business be conducted in
way to merit world wide confi
dence. Passing by the question
whether there is a sufficient quanti
ty of gold to transact the worlds
business, it may be admitted that
under the present laws and condi
tions it is the only money of un
doubted quality passing current in
the settlement of foreign as well aa
domestic debts. Therefore it is
necessary that banks should be sup
plied with sufficient gold or substi
stute readily changeable for it with
out loss to transact the business
they have to do, and thiB is one of
the chief bases of well founded con
fidence. Present experience shows
that in their anxiety to have every
dollar of deposits earning some
thing banks can not be trusted to
keep as largo -a supply of money
readily available as they ought.
Here then lies one of the chief diffi
culties of the present. The arbi
trary amounts of reserve required
by state and national laws have
failed to meet the case. The 25 per
cent .reserve required of New- York
banks answers but little purpose in
the transaction of business, for as
soon as it is encroached upon, capi
tal becomes alarmed, and it is of lit
tle value except for liquidation and
for that good securities would an
swer nearly as well. So in a lesser
degree it is with all other banks,
They loan down to what is com
monly accepted as the- danger line
and then some unforseen occurrance
does the rest. The reestablishment
of confidence in times like this de
pends on the point of view of the
depositor, small business man and
farmer. From this point and not
as ono having expert knowledge,
the following suggestions are offered
Do away with the national and state
laws requiring an arbitrary amount
of reserve and in place thereof adopt
a graded system. Take New York
banks for illustration. Allow them
to loan for instance GO per cent of
their deposits free of tax. On the
next 15 per [cent of their deposits
loaned levy a tax of one-half of 1
per cent. On the nextrU per cent of
their deposits above 75 per cent
loaned levy a tax of 1 per cent. On
the next 5 per cent above 80 per
cent lovy a tax of 2 per cent. On
the next 0 per
cent lew a tax
A Popular Play Indeed.
Js"©SS«
cent above 85 per
of 5 per cent and
to
lower tho arbitrary legal resorve
10 per.cent. Place similiar restric
tions on all state and national banks
Place these taxes in a special fund
to guarrantee depositors available
immediately when any bank fails,
Under these conditions the with
drawal of deposits through fear of
loss would never occur, nor would
the sacrifice of assets to provide
against runs. If, in addition to
this, no bank was allowed to accept
deposits to moro than eight or t(n
times its paid up capital and sur
plus and. the examination of bank
aecurities were somewhat more
thorough, all reasonable grounds for
distrust would be removed. If the
amount of money still remained
adequate two courses would be open
oneja slow and ordely liquidation
followed by slightly lower prices
the other, the addition to the stock
of money of something as good
gold, possibly silver certificates is
sued for bullion at market price in
quantities limited to the necessities
of the case. E. B. Porter.
SUakcspcaio'a "Julius Caesar" lias
been translated Into German nine
times, luto French seven, Into Italian
six, into modern Greek three, into
Latin and Swedish twice and iuto
Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Frisian, Po
lisli, Roumanian, Russian, Magyar,
Portuguese and Yiddish. There are
seven or eight English acting editions
of tho tragedy. But one attempt actu
ally to alter and improve it has ever
been made. This was in 1722, when
John Sheffield, duke of Buckingham
divided it into two parts at the death
of Caesar, calling it "The Tragedies of
Julius Caesar and Marcus Brutus," and
made many other changes. To enrich
this poor play, or, rather, these poor
plays, Pope furnished some choruses,
but they had tlie usual effects of ill ad
justed ornaments—they served onljr. to
make the meaunens of the thing they
bedecked the more conspicuous.

A young farm laborer called one mar
ket day at the registrar's office to
cord his lather's death. The registrar
asked the date ol' death.
"Well, lather ain't dbad yet," was
the reply, "but he will be dead before
morning, aud I thought it would save
me another journey if you would put
it down now."
"Oh, that won't do at all," said th
registrar. "Why, your father may
take a turn before morning and re
cover."
"Ah, no, lie wou't," said the youn
laborer, "iiootor says lie won't, an
he knows what he's given father."*
