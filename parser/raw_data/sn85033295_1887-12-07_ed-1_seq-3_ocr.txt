PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
To the Congress of the United States:
You are confronted at the threshold of your leg
islative duties with a condition of the national
finances which Imperatively demands imme
diate and careful consideration.
The amount of money annually exacted,
through the operation of present laws, Irom the
industries aud necessities of the people, largely
exceeds the sum necessary to meet the expenses
of the government.
When we consider that the theory of our insti
tutions guarantees to every citizen the full en
joyment of all the fruits of his industry and en
terprise with only such deduction as may be his
share towards tne careful and economical ma.tn
tenance of the government which protects him,
it is plain that the exaction of more than this is
Indeiensible extortion, and a culpable betrayal
of American fairness and justice. This wrong
Inflicted upon those who bear the burden of na
tional taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a
brood of evil consequences. The public treas
ury, which should only exist as a conduit con
veying the people’s tribute to its legitimate ob
ject of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place
for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and
the people's use, thus crippling our national en
ergies, suspending our country's development,
preventing investment in productive enterprise,
threatening financial disturbance, wid inviting
schemes of public plunder.
This condition ot our treasury is not altogether
new; and it has more than once of late been sub
mitted to the people’s representatives in the Con
gress, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet
the situation still continues, with aggravated in
cidents, more than ever presaging financial con
vulsion and widespread disaster.
It will not do to neglect this situation because
its daugeis are not now palpably imminent and
apparent. They exist none the less certainly,
aud await the unforeseen and unexpected occa
sion when suddenly they will be precipitated
upon us
On the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of
revenues over public expenditures alter comply
ing with the annual requirement of
THE SINKING FUND ACT,
was 817,859,735.81; durii g the year ended June
SO, 1886, such excess amounted* to $49,405 515.20;
and during the year ended June 30, 1887, it
reached the sum of $55,567,849.54.
The annual contiibutions to the sinking fund
during the three yeais above specified, amount
ing in the aggregate to $l3B G0',320.94, and de
ducted from the surplus as stated, were made by
calling in lor tnat purpose outstanding 3 per
cent, bonds of the government. During the six
months prior to June 80, 1887, the surplus reve
nue had grown so large by repeated accumula
tions, and it was feared the withdrawal of thus
great sum of money needed by the people would
so affect the business of the country that the sum
of 879,864,100 ot such surplus was applied to the
payment ot the principal and interest of the 3 per
cent bonds still outstanding, aud which were then
payable at the option ot the government. The
precarious condition of financial affairs among
the people still needing relief, Immediately after
the 301 h day of June, 188 7 , the remainder ot the
8 per cent, bonds then outstanding, amounting
with principal and interest to the sum of 818,877,-
500, were called iu and applied to the sinking
fund contribution for the current fiscal year.
Mo: withstanding these operations of the Treas
ury-Department representations ot distress in
business not only continued, but increased, aud
absolute peril seemed at hand, in these circum
stances the c mt'ibutiou to the sinking fund for
the current fiscal year was at once completed by
the expenditure ot $27,684 283.55 iu the purchase
of government bonds not yet due bearing 4 and
■i]4 per cent, interest, the premium paid thereon
averaging about 24 per cent, for the former and
8 per cent, for the latter, In addition to this the
interest accruing during the current year upon
the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the gov
ernment was to some extent anticipated, and
banks selected as depositories ot publi® money
were permitted to somewhat increase their de
posits.
While the expedients thus employed, to release
to the people the money lying idle in the treas
ury, served to avert immediate danger
OUR SURPLUS REVENUES
have continued to accumulate, the excess for the
present year amounting on the first day of De
cember to $55 2:8,70] .19, and estimated to reach
the sum ot $113,000,000 on the Both of June next,
at which date it is expected that this sum, added
to prior accumu ations, will swell the surplus in
the treasury to $140,000,000.
Th re seems to be no assurance that, with such
a withdrawal from use of the people’s circulating
medium, our business community may not in the
near future be subjected to the same distress
which was quite lately produced from the same
Aaus<*. And while the functions of our national
treasury should be lew and simple, and while its
be£t condition would be reached, 1 believe, by
its entire disi onnection with private business in
terests yet when, by a perversion of its purposes,
it ioly holds money uselessly subtracted from
the channc's ot trade, there seems to be reason
for the claim that some legitimate means should
be devised by the government to restore in an
emergency, without waste or extravagance, such
money to its place among the people.
It such an emeigency arises there now exists
no clear and undoubted executive power of re
lief. Heietoiore the redemp icn of 3 percent,
bonds, which were payable at the option of the
government, has a Horded a means lor the dis
bursement of the excess of our revenues; but
these bonds have all been retired and there are
no bonds outstanding tne payment ot which we
have the right to insist upon, ibe contribution
to the sinking tund which furnishes the occa
sion lor expenditure in the purchase ot bonds has
been already made ior the current year, so that
there is no outlet in that direction. In the pres
ent state of legislation the only pretense ot any
existing executive power to restore, at this time,
any part of cur surplus revenues to the peonle
by its expenditure, consists in the supposition
that the secretary of the treasury may enter the
market and purchase the bonds ot the govern
ment not yet due, at a rate of premium to be
agreed upou. The only provision of law from
which such a
power could be derived
is found in an sppiopiiation Dill passed a num
ber of years ago: and it is subject to the suspi
cion that it was intended as temporary aud lim
ited iu its application, instead of conferring a
continuing discretion and authority. No condi
tion ought to exist which would justify the grant
ot power to a single official, upou his judgment
of its nectssity, to withhold liom or release to
the business oi the people, in an unusual manner,
money held iu the treasury, and thus affect, at
his will, the financial situation of the country;
and If it :s deemed wise to lodge in the secretary
of the treasury the authority iu the present
juncture to purchase bonds, It should be plainly
vested, and provided as far as possible, with such
checks aud limitations as will define this offi
cial's right and discretion, and at the same time
relieve him from undue responsibility.
jia considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a mean of restoring to circulation the
surplus money accumulate g :n the treasury, it
shou and be borne in mind that premiums must of
course be paid upon such purchase, that there
may be a large ] art ot these bonds held as In
vestments which cannot be purchased at any
price, and that combinations among holders who
Are willing to sell, may unreasonably enhance
the cost of such bonds to the government.
It has t een suggested that the present bonded
debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest,
aud the difference between the old and new se
curity paid in cash, thus finding use for tee sur
plus in the treasury, The success of this plan, it
is apparent, must depend upon the volition of
the
HOLDERS OF THE PRESENT BONDS;
and it is not entirely certain that the induce
ment v. hlch must be offered them would result
in more financial benefit to the government than
the purchase of bonds, while the latter nroposi
tion would recuce the principal ot the debt by
actual payment, instead of extending it.
The proposition to depos t the money held by
the government in banks throughout the country,
lor nee by the people, is, it seems to me. exceed
ingly objectionable in principle, as estab ishing
too close a relationship between the operations of
the government treasury and the business of the
country and too extensive a commingling of their
money, tnus lowering an unnatural reliance in
private busine-s upon public funds. If this
scheme should be adopted it should only be done
as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent ne
cessity Legislative and executive effort should
generally be in the tpposlte direction and should
have a tendency to divorce, as much and as last
as can sately be done, the treasury department
from private enterprise. Of course, it is rmt ex
pected that unnecessary and extravagant appro
priations will be made for the purpose of avoid
ing the accumulation of
AN EXCESS OF REVENUE.
Such expenditure, beside the demoralization of
ail just conceptions ol public duty which it en
taiis, stimulates a habit of reckless improvidence
not in the icast consistent witn the mission of
ot r people or the nigh and beneficent purposes
of our government.
1 ha ve deemed it my duty to thus bring to the
knowledge of mj countrymen, as well as to the
attention of their representatives Charged with
the responsibility ol legislative relief, the grav
ity ot uur financial situation. The lal.ure of
the congress hereiolore to provide against the
dangers \vh ch it was quite evident the very
nature ol the difficulty must necessarily produce,
caused a condition ol financial disiitts and ap
prehension riuce your last adjournment, which
taxed to the utmo t ad the authority and expe
dients within execuuvf control; and these ap
pear now to be exhausted, lldisater results
from the continued inaction of Congress, the
responsibility must rest where it belongs.
Ihougb the .situation thus far cousileted is
fraught with danger which should be fully real
ized, and though it presents leatu es of Wioug to
the people as well as peril to the country, it is
bat a result growing out ol a perfectly palpable
and apparent cause. Cons autly reproducing the
Same alarming circumstances —a. congested na-
tlonal treasury and a depleted monetary condi
tion in the business of the country. It need
hardly be staled that while the present situation
demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a
like predicament in the future by the removal
of Its cause.
Our scheme of taxation, by means of which
this needless surplus is taken trom the people and
put into the public treasury, consists of a tariff
or duty levied upon importations from abroad,
and Internal revenue taxes levied upon the con
sumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt
liquors. It must be conceded that none of the
things subjected to
INTERNAL REVENUE TAXATION
are strictly speaking necessaries; there appears
to be no just complaint of this taxation by the
consumers of these articles, and there seems to
be nothing so well able to bear the burden with
out hardship to any portion ot the people. But
our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable
and illogical source of unnecessary taxation,
ought to be at once revised and amended. These
laws, a*, their primary and plain effect, raise the
price to consumers of all articles imported and
subject to duty, by precisely the sum paid for
such duties. Thus tne agent of the duty
measures the tax paid by those who purchase for
use these imported articles. Many ol these
things, however, are raised or mauulactured in
our own country, aud the duties now levied
upon foreign goods and products are called pro
tection to these home manufactures, because
they render it possible for those of our people
who are manufacturers, to make these taxed
articles and sell them for a price equal to that
demanded for the imported poods that have
paid customs duty, fco it happens that while
comparatively a few use the imported articles,
millions of our people, who never use and
never saw any of the foreign products, purchase
and use things of the same kind made in this
country, aud pay there or nearly or quite the
same enhanced price which the duty adds to the
imported articles. Those who buy imports pay
the duty charged thereon into the public treas
ury, but the great majority of our citizens, who
buy domestic anicles of the same class pay a
sum at least approximately equal to this duty to
the home manufacturer. This reference lo the
operation of our tariff laws is not made by way
of instruction, but in order that we may be con
stantly reminded of the manner in which they
impose a burden upon those who consume
domestic products as well as those who consume
imported articles, ana thus create a lax upon all
our people.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve the coun
try of this taxation. It must be extensively
continued as the source of the government’s in
come: and in a readjustment of our tariff’the
interests of American laoor encaged in manufac
ture should be carefully considered, as well as
the preservation of our manufactures. It may be
called protection, or by any other name, but re
lief from the hardships and
DANGERS OF OUR PRESENT TARIFF
laws should be devised with especial precaution
against imperiling the existence of our manufac
turing interests. But this existence should not
mean a condition which without regard to the
public welfare or a national exigency, must
always Insure the realization of immense profits
instead of moderately profitable returns. As the
volume aud diversity of our national activities
increase, new recruits are added to those
who desire a continuation of the ad
vantages which they conce ve the present system
of tariff taxation directly affords them. So
stubbornly have all efforts to reform
the present condition been resisted by
those of our fellow citizens thus engaged, that
they can hardly complain ot the suspicion, en
tertained to a certain extent, that there exists an
organized combination all along the line to
maintain their advantage.
We are in the midst ot centennial celebrations,
and with becoming pride we rejoice in American
skill and ingenuity, iu American energy and en
terprise, and in the wonderiul natural advan
tages aud resources developed by a century's
national growth. Yet when an attempt is made
to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be
laid upou every consumer iu the laud for the
benefit of our manufacturers quite beyond a
reasonable demand tor governmental regard, it
suits the purposes of advocacy to call our man
ufactures intant industries, still needing the
highest and greatest degree of favor and foster
ing care that can be wrung from federal legisla
tion.
It is also said that the increase in (he price of
domestic manufactures, resulting from the pres
ent tariff, is necessary in order that higher wages
may be paid to our workingmen employed in
manufactories, than are pain for what is called
the pauper labor of Europe. All will acknowl
edge the icrce of an argument which involves
the welfare and liberal compensation of our la
boring people. All
LABOR IS HONORABLE
in the eyes of every American citizen and as it
lies at the foundation of our development and
progress, it is entitled, without affectation or hy
pocrisy, to the utmost regard. The standard of
our iaoorers’ life should not be measured by that
of any other country less favored, and they are
entitled to their lull share of all our advantages.
By our last census it is made to appear that of
the 17,392,099 of our population engaged in all
kinds of industries, 7,070,493 are employed In
agriculture, 4,074 238 in professional aud person
al service. (2,934,870 ot whom are domestic serv
ants and laborers) while 1,810,250 are employed
iu trade and transportation, and 3,837,112 are
classed as employed in manufacturing and min
ing. For present purposes, however, the last num
ber given snould be considerably reduced. With
out attempting lo enumerate, it will be conceded
tnat there should be deducted from those which
itinciudes 375.143 carpenters and joiners, 285,401
milliners, dressmakers and seamstresses; 172,520
blacksmiths, 133.756 tailors, 102,473 masons, 76 -
241 ouichera, 41,309 bakers, 22,083 plasterers, and
4.891 eugaged in manufacturing agricu.tural iru
pemtnts, amounting in the aggregate to 1.214,023,
leaving 2,623, 089 persons employed iu such manu
facturing industries as are claimed to be bene
fited by a high tariff.
To these the appeal is made to save their em
ployment aud maintain their wages by reslsting
a change. There should be no disposition to an
svver such suggestions by the allegation that
they are in a minority among those who labor,
ana therefore should forego an advantage, in
the interest of low prices lor the majority; their
compensation, as may be aff cted by
THE OPERATION OF TAFIFF LAWS,
should at all times, be scrupulously kept iu
view; and yet with slight reflection they will not
overlook the fact that ihey are consumers with
the rest; that they, too, have their own wants and
these of their lam lies to supply from their
earnings, and that the price oi the necessaries
ot life, as well as the amount of their wages, will
regulate the measure of their weliare and com
fort.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to necessitate or
justify either the loss of employment by the
workingman nor the lessening of bis wages: and
the profits still remaining to me manufacturer af
ter; a utcessaiy readjustment, should furnish no
excuse lor ihe sacrifice of the interests of his em
ployes either in their opportunity to work or in
the diminution of their c ompensation. Nor can
the worker in manuiactures fail to understand
that while a high tariff is claimed to be necessary
to al.ow the payment of remunerative wages it
certainly results in a very large increase in the
price of nearly all sorts of manufactures, w’hicli
in almost countless forms, he needs ior the use of
himself and his family. He receives at the desk
of his employer his and perhaps beiore
he reaches his home, Is obliged, In a purchase
for family use of an article which embraces his
own labor, to return iu the payment of the in
crease in price which the tariff permits, the hard
earned compensation of many days ot toil,
Ihe farmer and the agriculturist who manu
facture nothing, but who pay the Increased
price which the tariff imposes upon every agri
cultural implement, upon all he wears aud upon
all he us sand owns, except the increase of his
flocks and herds and such things as his hus
bandry produces Irom the soil, is invited to aid
in maintaining ihe present situation and he is
told that a hign duty on imported wool is neces
sary ior the benefit or those who have sheep to
shear in order that the price of their wool may
be increased. Thej r , of course, are not reminded
that the farmer who has no sheep is by this
scheme ooliged, in his purchases of clothing and
woolen goods,
TO PAY A TRIBUTE
to his fellow farmer as well as to the manufact
urer and merchant; nor is any mention made of
the act that that the sheep-owners themselves
and their households, must wear clothing and
use other articles manufactured from the wool
they sell at taritl prices, and thus as consumers
must return their share ot this increased price to
thr trade-man.
I think it may be fairly assumed that a large
proportion of tne sheep owned by the farmers
throughout the country are found in small flocks
numb ring from twenty-five to fl.'ty. Ihe duty
cn the grade 01 imported wool which these sheep
yield, is It* cents on each pound, if of the value
ot o > cents or less and 12 it ot the value of more
than .So cents. It the liberal estimate of six
pounds be allowed lor each fleece, the duty
thereon would be 60 or 11 cents, and this may be
taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to
the farmer by reason ot this duty. Eighteen
dollars would thus represent the increased price
of the wool from twenty-five sheep and i‘36 that
from the wooi of tihy sheep and at present values
this addition would amount to afiout one-third
ot its price. If upon its sale the larmer receives
this or a less tauff profit, the wool leaves his
hands charged with precisely that sum, which
In ail its changes will adt.ere to it, umitit
reaches the consumer. When manufactured
into cloth and otner goods and material
lor use, its co-l is not only increased to the ex
tent of the farmers tariff profit but a lurther
sum has b< en added for the benefit of the manu
facturer under the imposition of other tariff
law*. in the meantime the day arrives when
the farmer fluffs it necessary to purchase woolen
aud material to clothe hi nisei f and his
family lor the w inter. When ne face* the trades
man for that pur{>ose he discovers that he is
obliged not omy to leturn in the way of In
creased prices, his tariff profit on the wool he
sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in
manufactured form, but that he must add a con
siderable sum thereto to meet
A FURTHER INCREASE IN COST
caused by the tariff’ duty on the manufacture.
Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he
has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result
of the tariff'system which, when he sold his wool
seemed so profitable, an increase in the pried
more than sufficient to sweep away all the tari.l
profit he received upon the wool he produced
and sold.
When the number of farmers engaged in wool
raising is compared with all the farmers in the
country, and the email proportion they hear to
our population is considered; when it is made
apparent that, in the case ot a large part of those
who own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff
on wool is illusory; and above all, when it must
be conceded that the increase of the cost of liv
ing caused by such a tariff, becomes a burden
upon those with moderate means and the poor,
the employed and unemployed, the sick ana
well, and the young and old; and that it con
stitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is
fastened upon the clot hing of every man, woman
and child in the land, reasons are suggested why
the removal or reduction of this.duty should he
Included in a revision of our tariff laws.
In speaking of the increased cost to the con
sumer of our home manufactures, resulting
from a duty laid upon imported aiticlesot the
same description, the fact is not overlooked that
competition among our domestic producers
sometime* has the effect Off keepiug the price of
their products below the highest limit allowed
by such duty. But it is notorious that this com
petition is too often strangled by combinations
quite prevalent at this time, and frequently
called trusts, which have for their object the
regulation of the supply and price of commodi
ties made and sold by members ot the combina
tion. The people can hardly hope for any con
sideration in the operation of these selfish
schemes. If, however, in the absence of such
combinaticn, a healthy and free competition re
duces the price of any particular dutiable article
of home production below the limit which it
might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and
if, with such reduced price, its manufacture con
tinues to thrive, it is entirely evident that one
thing has been discovered which should be care
fully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation.
The necessity of combination to maintain the
price of any commodity to the tariff point, fur
nishes proof that someone is
WILLING TO ACCEPT LOWER PRICES
for such commodity, and that such prices are re
munerative; and lower prices produced by com
petition prove the same thing. Thus where either
of these conditions exist, a case would seem to
be presented for an easy reduction of taxation.
The considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended only to en
force an earnest recommendation that the sur-
Elus revenues of the government be prevented
y the reduction ol our customs duties, and, at
the same time, to emphasize a suggest ion that
in accomplishing this purpose, we may discharge
a double duty to our people by granting to
them a measure of relief from tariff
taxation in quarters where It is most needed
and from sources where it can be most lairly
and justly accorded, is or can the presentation
made of such considerations be, with any degree
of fairness, regarded as evidence of unfriendli
ness toward our manufacturing interest*, or ot
any lack of appreciation of their value and im
portance. These interests constitute a leading
and most substantial element of our national
greatness and lurnish the proud of our
country’s progress. But if in the emergency
that presses upon us ourmanutacturers are asked
to surrender something for the public good aud
to avert disaster, their patriotism, as welt as a
grateful recognition of advantages already af
forded, should lead them to willing co-opera
tion. No demand is made that they shall fore
go all the benefits of governmental regard; but
they cannot fail to be admonished of their duty,
as well as their enlightened self-interest aud
sa ety, when they are reminded of the fact that
financial panic and collapse, to which the pres
ent condition tends, afford no greater shelter or
protection to our manufactures than to our other
important enterprises. Opportunity lor sa.e,
careful, and
DELIRKKATE REFORM IS NOW OFFERED;
and none of us should be unmindful of a time
wheu an abused aud irritated people, heedless of
those who have resisted timely and reasonable
relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping
rectification ot their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a wise and fair re
vision of our tariff laws is not underestimated.
It will require on the part of the Convress great
labor ana care, and especially a broad and na
tional contemplation ot the subject, and a patri
otic disregard of such local and selfish claims as
are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of
the entire country.
Under our present laws more than 4,000 articles
are subject to duty. Many of these do not in
any way compete with our own manufactures,
and many are hardly worth attention as subjects
of revenue. A considerable reduction c m be
maJem the aggregate, by adding them to the
free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no
features ot hardship; but the necessaries of life
use i and consumed by all the p.-ople. the duty
upon whith adds to the cost of living in every
home, should be greatly cheapened.
The radical reduction of the duties imposed on
raw material mtd iu manufactures, or its freo
importation, is of course, an important factor in
any effort to reduce the price of these necessi
ries: it would not only relieve tnem from the in
creased cost caused by the tariff on such materi
al, but the manufactured product being thus
cheapened, that part ot the tariff now laid upon
such product, as a compensation to our manu
facturers lor the present price of raw cnaterial
could be accordingly modified. Bucn reduction,
or free importation, would serve beside to large
ly reduce the revenue. It is nut apparent how
such a change can have any injurious effect upon
our manufacturers. On the contrary, it would
appear to give them
A BETTER CHANCE IN FOREIGN MARKETS
with the mauufactuiera of oilier countries, who
cheapen their wares by lice material. Thus our
people might have the opportunity of extending
their sales beyond the limits of home consump
tion-saving them f om thedepiession, interrup
tion in business, and less caused by a glutted
domestic market, and affording their employes
more certain aud steady labor, with its result
ing quiet and contentment.
The question thus imperatively presented for
solution should be approached ill a spirit higher
than partisanship and considered in the light of
that regard lor patriotic duly which should
characterize the action oi those intrusted with
the weal of a confiding people. But the obliga
tion to declared party policy aud principle is not
wanting to urge prompt and effective action.
Both of the grtat political parties now repre
sented in the government have, by repeated aud
authoritative declarations, condemned the con
dition of our laws which permit the collection
fiom the people ot unnecessary revenue, and
have, in the m st solemn manner, promised its
correction; aud neither as citizens nor partisans
are our countrymen in a mood to condone the de
liberate violation of these pledges.
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not
be improved by dwelling upon the theories of
protection aud free trade. This savors too much
of band.vlng epithets. It is a condition which
conftonis us—not a theory'. Relief from this
condition may involve a slight reduction of the
advantages which we award our home produc
tions, but the entire withdrawal of such advan
tages should not be contemplated, Tne question
of Lee trade is absolutely irrelevant; and the
persistent claim made in certain quarters, that
all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and
unnecessary taxation are schemes ot so-called
free-traders, is mischievous and far removed
from any consideration lor the public good.
The simple aud plain duty which we owe the
people is to reduce taxation to the necessary ex
penses of an economical opeiatiou ot the gov
ernment and to restore to the business of the
country the money which we hold in the treas
uiy through the
PERVERSION OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS,
These things can and should be done with
safety to alt our industries, wituout danger to
the opportunity tor remunerative labor which
our workingmen need, and with benefit to them
and all our people, by cheapening their means
of subsistence and increasing the measure of
their comforts.
The constitution provides that the President
;‘shall, irom lime to time, give to the Congress
information of the state of the Union.” It has
been the custom of the executive, in compliance
witn this provision, to annually exhibit to the
Congress, at the opening of its session, the gen
eral condition of the country, and to detail, with
some particularity, the operations of the differ
ent executive departments It would be espe
cial y agreeable to follow this c urse at the pres
ent time, and to call attention to the valuble
accomplishments of these departments during
the last fiscal year. Bull am so mucu impressed
with the paramount impoitauce of the subject
to which this communication has thus far been
devoied. that 1 shall lo.ego the addition ot any
other topic, and only urge upon your immediate
consideration the ‘ state of the Union” as shown
in the present condition of our treasure aud our
general fiscal situation, upon which every ele
ment of our safety and prosperity depends.
The reports ol ihe heads of the departments,
which will he submitted, contain full and ex
plicit information touching the transactions of
the business intrusted to them and such recom
mendations relating to legislation in the public
interest as they deem advisable. I ask lor these
reports aud recommendations the deliberate ex
amination aud action of the legislative branch of
the government.
There are other subjects not embraced in the
depart tmntal reports demanding legislative cou
sioeratlon aud which 1 should be glad to submit.
Some of them, however, have been earnestly
presented in previous messages, and, as to them,
I beg leave to repeal prior recommendations.
as the law maxes no provision for any report
