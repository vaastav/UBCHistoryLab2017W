Taft Says Criticism is Not
Against Protective Principle
IN MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
Which Also Deals with Panama Canal,
Postal Savings Bank, Parcels Post
and Conservation Asks for
Raise of Judicial Salaries.
Washington, D. C, Dee. 6. President
Taft's message to Congress was present
ed to-day. The message equals the rec
ords for the longest ever submitted. The
record was that of one' of Roosevelt's,
and it contained 40,000 words. President
Taft's message has about the same num
ber. It was in part as follows:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives: ' During the past year the foreign rela
tions of the United States have contin
ued upon a basis of friendship nml good
understanding.
The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two impor
tant international controversies befort;
the permanent court of The Hague.
The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since the fisheries convention of
1818, has given an award which is satis
factory to both parties.
Peace Commission.
Appreciating these enlightened tenden
cies of modern times, the Congress at its
last session passed a law providing for
the appointment of a commission of five
members "to be appointed by the presi
dent of the United States to consider
the expediency of utilizing existing inter
national agencies for the purpose of lim
iting the armaments of the nations ol
the world by international agreement
and of constituting the combined navies
of -the world an international force for
the preservation of universal peace and
to consider and report upon any other
means to diminish the expenditures of
government for military purposes and to
lessen the probabilities of war."
The work of the international fisheries
commission appointed in 1008, under the,
treaty of April 11. 100S, between Great
Britain and the United States, hue re
sulted in the formulation and recom
mendation of uniform regulation gov
erning the fisheries of the boundary wa
ters of Canada and the United States
for the purpose of protecting and in
creasing the supply of food fish in such
waters.
The Far East.
The center of interest in far eastern
affairs during the past year has agafn
been China.
It is gratifying to note that the nego
tiations lor a loan to the Chinese govern
ment for the construction of the trunk
railway lines from Hankow southward
to Canton and westward through t lie
Yangtse valley, known as the Ilukuang
loan, were concluded by the representa
tives of the various financial groups in
May last and the results approved by
their respective governments.
Tariff Negotiations.
The new tariff law in section 2 re
specting the maximum and minimum
tariffs of the United States, which pro
visions came into effect on April 1, 1910,
imposed upon the president the responsi
bility of determining prior to that date
whether or not any undue discrimination
existed against the United States and
its products in anjr country of the world
with which we sustained commercial re
lations. The policy of broader and closer trade
relations with the dominion of Canada,
which was initiated in the adjustment
of the maximum and minimum provi
sions of the tariff act of August, 1009,
has proved mutually beneficial. It justi
fies further efforts' for the readjustment
of the commercial relations of the two
countries, so that their commerce may
follow the channels natural to contigu
ous countries and be commensurate with
the steady expansion of trade and indus
try on both sides of tho boundary line.
The Department of State.
All tariff negotiations, so vital to our
commerce, and industry, and the duty of
jealously guarding the equitable and just
treatment of our products, capital and
industry abroad devolve upon the de
partment of state.
The efforts of that department to se.
cure for citizens of the United States
equal opportunities in the markets of
the worhl and to expand American com
merce have been most successful. The
volume of business obtained in new fields
of competition and upon new lines is al
ready very great, and Congress is urged
to continue to support the department
of state in its endeavors for furthei
trade expansion.
An instrumentality indispensable to
the unhampered anil natual development
of American commerce is merchant ma
rine. All maritime and commercial na
tions recognize the importance of this
factor. The greatest commercial nations,
our competitors, jealously foster their
merchant marine.
I alluded to this most important sub
ject in my last annual message. It has
often been before you. and 1 need not
recapitulate the reason for its recom
mendation. I'nlcss prompt action be
taken, the completion of the Panama
canal will find this the only great com
mercial nation unable to avail in inter
national maritime business of this great
contribution to the means of the world's
commercial intercourse.
For many reasons 1 cannot too strong
Iv urge upon the Congress the passage
of a measure by mail subsidy or other
subvention adequate to guarantee the
establishment and rapid development of
n American merchant marine, the res
toration of the American flag to its an
cient place upon the sejts.

INTERPRETER MAY TELL
OF HATtlE'S WORDS
Announcement Caused Excitement at To
day's Trial of LeBlanc Girl on the
Charge of Murder, at Cam
bridge, Mass.
Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 6. Excitement
prevailed at the opening of to-day's ses
sion of the trial of Ilattie LeBlanc for
the murder of Clarence Glover. It is
reported that Miss Gallant, the inter
preter who talked with Ilattie at the
third degree trial in the police station
the night she was arrested, will come
from Nova Scotia and testify this after
noon or to-morrow for the prosecution,
telling what the girl said in French.
Herbert Willey, who lent the police
his auto the night of the Glover murder,
testified that he aided in the first search
for Ilattie. Superintendent MeCall, who
went into the Waltham laundry, testified
that he saw marks upon the floor.
No witness has yet testified to seeing
Hattie Lelilanc enter or leave the laun
dry, where the shooting is said to have
taken pluce, and three efforts by the dis
trict attorney to introduce testimony
that more closely connected the girl with
the crime have been ruled out by the
court. On the other hand, the defense,
during the seven days of the trial, has
turned the attention of the jury from
the little Cape Breton girl to Mrs. Lillian
M. Glover, the widow, and the district
attorney has several times been obliged
to protect her against the attacks of
Melvin M. Johnson, leading counsel for
the defense.
Half a dozen witnesses testified yes
terday to seeing Mrs. Glover in her own
home about the time the shooting is
said to have occurred in the laundry.
Being cross questioned, Mr. MeCall
described the finding of Hattie's pin and
Judge Bond remarked that he thought
three others testified to finding a pin
and comb. After the surveyor testified
as to the laundry dimensions, Seymour
Glover was called.

pulled her through the window. In do
ing so he was painfully burned about
the hands.
Mrs. Gilmore was dead when Pimen
tal got her out doors. Parts of her

CONSERVATIVES GAIN LITTLE.
Already Trying to Influence King George
Against Liberals.
London, Dee. 6. To-day's prospects
are that the conservatives will make a
net gain of only four or five seats as the
result of the present general elections,
b"t thev are already trying to iniluence
King George against the creation of
l ici.,1 peeis by arguing that even the
small gain shows that the country is nn
f.torab!e to the lilwral'n program. The
present returns show the conservative
figures to be 11(5 and the liberals 7;

Frank Brackett of West Epping, N. H,
Victim of Hunters.
Manchester, N. II., Dec. 6. Frank
Brackett of West Epping was brought
to this city yesterday and carried to
tho Elliott hospital, where he was oper
ated upon for the removal of three shot,
received in his thighs in an accidental
shooting affair. Brackett, who is a
young man of 22 or 2'.l year of age, was
out in the woods surrounding his home
at Epping, Saturday morning, and after
a deal of fruitless searching for deer
at last struck a warm trail.
Aliout the tame time, Joseph St. John
and a party of friends, also from Epping,
who were deer hunting, came upon the
same trail. After a deliberate stalk
ing, they came upon what they supposed
was the deer, and immediately opened
fire. The object proved to be Frank
Brackett, and upon examination it was
found that a number of the buckshot
had lodged in hi legs. An attempt
was made at the time to remove them,
but there were three that could not be
withdrawn.
Doctors were called in, after the
wounded man had been carried to his
home, but it was found impossible to
extract the bullets. Monday miming a
bed vyas placed in the burgage car of the
train over the Portsmouth branch of the
Boston and Maine railroad, which ar
rives in this city at 10:0(5 o'clock and
the injured man was placed upon it. Im
mediately upon his arrival at the East
Manchester depot, Brackett was taken
in Wallace's ambulance to the Elliott
hospital, where search for the lead pel
lets was immediately begun. They were
extracted.
MUST PAY $10,000.
Government Makes a Demand Upon New
Orleans Lace Firm.
Washington, D. C, Dec. ().- As n result
of the investigation of imports of luces
and embroideries at New Orleans the
treasury department yesterday demand
ed from May & Ellis, a firm of import
ers in that city, the payment of $10.
000 in back duties-which the government
claims should have been paid upon em
broideries during 1907-08.
No criminal intent is charged, but
the undervaluations were due to feat
ures of the customs administration at
New Orleans, which recently was se
verely criticised by a grand jury there.
The investigation followed that criti
cism. It is believed by the department that
many of the agreed valuations in laces
and embroideries may be lower than ac
tual value.

Denial Made by John P: Harris of Pitts
burg, the Owner.
Boston, Dec. 6. John P. Harris of
Pittsburg, owner of the Boston National
Baseball club, who was in this city last
night for a few hours, denied the re
port that be bad sold the club to James
J. Phelan, a Boston banker, representing
a local syndicate.
Mr. Phelan, who had lteen quoted in
connection with the reported sale, last
night denied that he bad any financial
interest in the club and said that the
only way his name could be connected
with the rumored negotiations is that
he hiippcn to know the parties con
templating the purchase.
BABIES WERE RESCUED.
In Fire at Clarcmont, N. II., Last Night
Taken Out In Blankets.
Clareniont, N. II., Dec. C The four
tenement block, 24 Trcmont street,
owned by M. Ganmond, was burned
out last night. The fire broke out
of an unoccupied tenement on the first
floor.
The tenants were John Fleury and
wife and Mrs. Fleury's cousin, Alexan
der Brouse; Nicholas Montecalvo, wife
and two" young children, and the fam
ily of Charles E. Mann, consisting of
his wife and two young children and
Mrs. Mann's aged mother, Mrs. D. F.
Piper.
The fire spread so rapidly that the
tenants, must of whom were in bed,
escaped scantily clad with the mercury
nearly at zero. Two babies were tak
en out in blankets. All the tenants
lost clothing and household goods, and
property not burned was damaged by
water and smoke.
The firemen went into a room at the
top of the house and removed a burning
bureau in which was 300 in money be
longing to Mr. Henry. The Mann fam
ily suffered the greatest hiss, and had
no insurance. Mr. Mann is critically
ill in a hospital at Tewksbury, Mass.
The origin of the fire is not known.
It was burning furiously when discov
ered by three boys, C. L. Cann, John
Hackett and E. Stone, who were return
ing home front sliding and gave the
alilrm. The hoys also aroused the ten
ants and by so doing no doubt prevented
the loss of life.
The firemen were delayed in getting wa
ter by a broken valve stem on the first
hydrant topped, necessitating tho
running of ho-e lines through another
street. The loss is estimated at $2,
500 with an insurance on the building.
The same tenement was partially
burned out four years ago when it was
owned bv J. A. llurd.
RIDICULOUS STATEMENT.
Says Auditor Anable About Salary of
M. & W. R. R. R. President.
F. S. Aimble of Boston, general au
ditor of the Montpelier &. Wells River
railroad, characterizes, in a letter to the
Boston Globe to-day, the statement as
ridiculous that Dliuiel R. Sort well, presi
dent of the road, is getting $.50,000 a
year salary. His letter is as follows: ,
'"In the fitst place, the statement that
Daniel R. Sort well, president of the com
pany, was a Harvard 1911 man and left
college to accept the presidency of this
road is incorrect, he having been gradu
ated from Harvard in the class of 1907
and having been since he left college in
the employ of Fstahrook X Co., bankers,
until the death of his father last March,
when be assumed the care of his father's
estate as adminstrator and succeeded his
father as president of the Montpelier &
Wells River railroad.
"The statement that this road pays
its president a salary of $.50,000 a year'is
ridiculous, and the legislator making
such statement should have known that
it was untrue, as the annual report
made to the public service commission
of Vermont for the year ending June 30,
1909, on file in the office of the commis
sion at Montpelier, and from which the
figures relative to surplus were evidently
taken, shows that the total amount
charged during that year for salaries
and expends of general officers (in which
the president's salary is required to be
included) aggregated only $.5,.51 4.7,5.
"As to the further statement made
that this railroad pays $!0,WM) a rear
in dividends, it actually paid no divi
dends for a jteriod of 12 years from IS,
to 1902, and in that period accumulated
a surplus from which dividends of 5 per
cent., or sMO.oOO per year, were paid
during the years 1903 to 1908 inclusive,
but during the years 1909 and 1910 divi
dends of only 2'i per cent., or $20,000
per year, were paid, and-the net income
of the company for the vear ending
June 30, 1000, 'was only $ 1 9,300.27. or
$WH.73 less than the 2'i per cent, divi
dend paid.
"The balance sheet of June 30, 1000,
as shown in the report to the public
service commission, does show a Imlunee
of assets in excess of liabilities of .$210,
0H.5, but floes not show undivided earn
ings, as stated, of $10,309, or any other
amount: ami this same balance sheet
shows that of this surplus of $210,98.5.
? 1 03.302 is represented by the excess of
cash of road and equipment over its
capital stock of ?S(X 1,0110, and that a
further amount of f 19.474 is represented
by stock of materials and supplies on
band, the current available assets and
current liabilities at June 30, 1000. be
ing resectively $31,323 and $2H.33".I3,
showing a net balance of current assets
over liabilities of $2.08.5.87.
"The Sortwell estate, which does not
own the road, as stated, but does own
11 large majority of the stock of the
company, would be very happy if the
statements made as to the roiul being
the richest in the world in proportion
to its size and having a large available
surplus were true, but the facts do not
bear out any such statement, as is clear
ly shown above.
"Regarding the allegations made that
the passenger tariff is high, we have only
to say that we consider the rate a fair
one and will endeavor to prove this con-
tion it officially called on to do so.

PACKERS ASK POSTPONEMENT.
Would Await Result of Suit for Dissolu
tion of Packing Company.
Chicago. Dec. 0. The packers indi
dividualir indicted on the charge of con
spiracy for violation of the anti-trust
law to-d.ty filed a petition with Feder.il
Je('i' Carpenter. kinir a postpone
ment of the eases pending the disposi
tion of the suit before .Tud-je Land's for
the (involution f the National Packing
ixnijiany.
The Vermont Senate this morning dis
posed of what little business was on
hand in short order and adjourned, to
go into the House to hear the debate
on the EIroy Kent case, in which Kent
is condemned to be hanged next Febru
ary for murdering Delia Congdon. The
only business was tho passage by TIu
Senate of the weights and measures bill
with a further amendment, giving the
governor the power to appoint the com
missioner, which was tin? way the orig
inal oill read, until the House amended
it to make the officer elected by the
general assembly.
As soon as the EIroy Kent case came
up at 10:30 o'clock, Mr." Howard of Whit
ing yielded the floor to Mr. Webster of
Swlintou, who moved that, inasmuch as
the attorney general had spoken before
the House on the ease, John D. Spell
roan of Rutland, one of Kent's counsel,
be permitted to advocate his cause before
the House. This required a three-fourths
vote, and the rising vote showed 138
for the motion and 4(5 opposed, just
enough to adopt it.
Mr, Spellman said that, although Kent
bad a fair trial before an honest jury,
there had always been a doubt in his
mind as to whether the verdict was real
ly right, and he felt that as an attorney
he would not be doing his full duty un
less he did what be could to prevent a
man of unsound mind being sent to the
gallows, Mr. Spellman said that Kent
was of unsound mind by lineage. He
read abstracts of the testimony givct,
by Drs. Grout and Wasson of the state
hospital for the insane and of Dr. Shirres
of Montreal, an expert alienist employed
by the state in the trial. This testi
mony was that while Kent was probably
sane he was of unsound mind, of low
mentality, a degenerate and a moral
imbecile.
Mr. Spellman closed with an eloquent
to f.how that Kent came from an insane-,.
family and that a younger brother was
now under arrest, charged w ith the muT
der of his own father.
Mr. Spellman closed with an eloquent
appeal to the members not to disgrace
the state by Rending to his death a man
admitted by all the expert testimony to
be of unsound mind.
Mr. I'eck of Burlington asked Mr.
Spellman If the state did not furnish
money to procure such' witnesses as
Kent's counsel desired, and Mr. Spellman
said it did, as it always does in criminal
eases. He also said that be thought that
if a Mrs. Thaw had been at hand with
plenty of money some of the expert
testimony might have been different. He
considered that two letters from Dr.
Shirres of Montreal to Slav's Attorney
Jones of Rutland were capable of that
construction.
Mr. Howard of Whiting made an ex
tended speech in Kent's favor, which he
prefaced by asking Mr. Peck of Burling
ton, chairman of the judiciary committee,
which reported the bill adversely, if tlit
committee had communicated with the
authorities at the Waterbury asylum in
regard to the esse, or if Kent's counsel
had been given an opportunity to appear
before the committee. Mr. Peck an
swered no to both questions. Mr. How
ard said he would riot go into the ques
tion of constitutionality, as he thought
it was but a subterfuge and that mem
bers of the House should be men enough
to face this matter and stand up and
be counted. He also quoted from some
of the testimony given at the trial, gave
some of the family history, showing an
inherited tendency to insanity. Mr. How
ard told of an accident to Kent, in
which, when jumping from a train, his
skull was fractured, and, in removing a
splinter from the wound, two ounces of
brain tissue were removed. At the time
Kent escaped froth- the Waterbury asy
lum, his sentence at the state prison baa
expired, and if he was not insane they
bad no right to keep him at the asylum.
He thought the fact that he carved his
name 111 the vicinity of the crime was
strong evidence of his insanity. He
thought that as he walked through the
corridors the comments he heard were a
cry to crucify him, crucify him.
Mr. Peck of Burlington desired to ask
the attorney cpneral some questions.
Mr. Howard of Whiting objected, and the
chair ruled that this was a continuation
of Friday's session and that the attor
ney general could Vie heard. Thereupon,
the at torney general answered Mr. Peck's
questions and then addressed the House.
Without taking action on the bill, the
House adjourned at 12:1.5 p. m., and oil
the return resumed consideration of the
case'.
A Junket Killed.
Joint resolutions were introduced in
the House this morning as follows:
By Mr. Martin of llartland, granting
the Use of Representatives' hall to the
veterans of the Civil w ar Thursday even
ing, December 8. This was adopted on
the part of the House.
By Mr.. Stone of Wallingford, empow
ering the joint committee on the house
of correction to visit that institution at
the expense of the state and report by
bill or otherwise. This resolution was
favored by Mr. Stone and opposed by
Mr. Martin of Brookline. It was not
adopted.
A0S1LY tOA'iPLAINTS
WIRE TAKEN IL
By Aldermen at Regular Meeting Last
Evening, One About Sliding, Another
About Closed Station, Third About
a Telephone Pole.
The city council found but little bus
iness on hand to transact w hen they met
for their regular meeting last evening,
though later the board of aldermen
brought up several matters that kept
the meeting going for an hour and a
half. The clerk read a resolution for
the issuing of the 1 15,000 water bonds,
which were authorized at the recent city
meeting. The resolution provides that
the bonds be dated December 1, 1910,
and bear interest at 4 per cent., pay
able semi-annually, and that five of the
bonds mature on each December 1, be
ginning in 1010 and running utnil 1927;
also that the bonds be disposed of
through the Old Colony Trust company
of Boston. This was the first reading
of the resolution and when the council
adjourned it adjourned to 7 o'clock this
evening for the purpose of having the
resolution read a second time and passed.
The overseer of the poor's report for
November was read and acptcd, show
ing that he had expended $4.53.18 dur
ing the month. On recommendation of
the building inspector a permit was
granted to Mrs. E. C. Getehel to build
au addition to her house on Brook street.
Alderman Brown reported that many
complaints had been made about the
children being allowed to slide on any
or all the streets about the city as they
have been doing since the snow came.
The council immediately decided to rem
edy t It -4 trouble by setting aside the
same streets for sliding as last year,
viz., ward 1, Batehelder, St.; ward 2,
Park St.; ward 3. Long St.; ward 4,

tion of the council making an effort to
have the Central Vermont station kept
open nights for the benefit of people
who come and go on the night trains,

of going to the night train and finding

a cold car until it was time for the
train to leave. Several of the aldermen

go to the train to meet some one who
is coming in and if the train happens
to be lute they have to stand around
in the cold or storm. Alderman Hoyt

men be appointed to confe"r with the
railroad officials and see if satisfactory
arrangements could be made to have the
statiort open nights. Tho motion was

committee, Aldermen Hoyt, Wilicy and

Announcement was made to graniti
manufacturers of Ilarre and vicinity bj
circular letter from the Granite Quarrj
Owners' association last night that be
ginning shortly the price of Barre gran
ite will be increased and that hereaftei
stones will be shipped to manufacturer!
to correspond with the sizes ordered
rather than being left, with the margin
as quarried. It is understood that th
increase amounts to about five per cent
on the average.
The reasons given for the increase in
the price of ro"gh stock is the increased
cost of production, caused by advance
in price of supplies and labor. The new
agreement between the quarry owners
and their men goes into effect March 1.
The manufacturers got an inkling of th
proposed increase some time ago, so that
they were not entirely unprepared for
the announcement lust night. Neverthe
less, it caused considerable stir.
The statement given by the associa
tion is as follows:
"The increased cost of production in
the quarry inib'stry caused by advance
in price of supplies and labor places the
quarry owners under the necessity ol
raising the price of rough stock.
"The advance to meet the price of
labor meant a percentage higher than
is consistent with the welfare of the
Barre granite- industry, and the eo-.umit-tee
of the Granite Quarry Owners' asso
ciation have gone into this matter fully,
with a view of reducing as much as pos
sible the advance necessary.
"For some time past a condition has
developed whereby the quarry operators
have been furnishing stock from one
inch to three inches above the size or
dered, and while this entails a loss 01
10 per cent, to 20 per cent, on their
business, the manufacturers have reaped
no benefit.
"It has now been agreed between the
undersigned quarry owners that from
date of new price list stock will be
quarried as close as possible to size
ordered, and all quarry foremen will be
instructed accordingly.
"Further, that 110 allowance or replace
ment of stone shipped to customers will
be made, provided the stone will make
the size marked ami is not defective.
"All stones ordered rock-face shall be
charged according to the price list."
The statement is signed by fifteen
members of the Quarry Owners' associa
tion, as follows: Jones Brothers Co.,
Wells-La mson Quarry Co., Boiitwell.
Milne & Varnum Co., Barre Granite and
Quarry Co.. Stephen f: Gerrard, Consoli
dated Quarry Co.. Standard Granite Co.,
I). M. Miles, Marr A Gordon Quarry
Co., Manufacturers' Qi-arrving Co., Me
Iver A Matheson, E. I.. Smith & Co',
Wet more & Morse Granite Co., Doucette-
iBolcan Co., and .Tames K. Pirie. This
1 list includes most of the owners of qnnr
! ries on the Barre hill. It is understood
that there is prospect of a similar in
crease in the price of Quincy granite.
The Barre Granite Manufacturers' as
sociation has, with the National Asso
ciation of the Granite Industries of the
I'nited States, entered a protest to tho
interstate commerce commission over the
rules of car demurrage which went into
effect on IVecember 1. The rules were
promulgated by the commission on No
vember HI. and they provide that for six
months after December 1 fliere shall be
allowed 72 hours' demurrage on lumber
and forest products, coal grain and grain
products in Xew England, while on gran
ite the 48 hours' demurrage, decided upon
by the railroads, would remain in fore-.
The commission in its rules reported
as follows:
"We recommend that for 6ix months
following that date the free time upon
lumber and forest products, coal, grain
'and gr.fln products be extended from 48
I hours to 72 hours, provided, however,
I that the application of the average rule
shall only be allowed upon a 48-hour
basis.
The granite men have protested that
not only will this impose a hardship on
them in freeing their cars, but that the
railroads would in that case be called
on to do so much shifting that it would
be a hardship to them. It is specifically
stated in the commission's rules that
they are merely tentative and that if
the' application results in hardship they
will lie modified after six months, mean
while the commission "awaiting fuller
and more precise information upon the
New England situation." Therefore,
Barre granite men, in conjunction with
others in New England, hope in six
months to get a modification of the rules
regarding demurrage on granite cars.
