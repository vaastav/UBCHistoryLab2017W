St. Locis, Mo., Dec. 1. Chairman
Taubeneck, of the People's party has
issued s manifesto to the Populists of
the United States and among other
things, he says:
"The result of the late election is be
fore us. We have increased our aggre
gate vote about 100 per cent since 1S92
and have broken the solid south. We
have convinced our opponents and the
world that we are a fixed factor in poli
tics and have come to stay. A new par

been excelled by any new party in the
history of the country. Every populist
can be proud of the record we have

made this year. The People's party is
the only political organization whose
members stand as a unit in all sections
on the principles it advocates. The two
old parties have their eastern, nothern,
western and southern factions, each one
holding antagonistic views on all the
great industrial questions which are
forging their way to the front.
"In 12 out of the 14 states west of the
Mississippi river, which, in the past,
have been classed as Republican, the
People's party is first and second in
voting strength, all except Iowa and
California. In these 12 we have re
duced the Democratic strength to a
few stragglers, and had it not been for
the administration and gold-bug Demo
crats nominating dummy tickets for the
Democratic farmers and laborers to
support while they voted with the Re
publicans, we should have elected our
candidates in a majority of these states.
In the states south of the Potamac and
Ohio rivers we are second in voting
strength in eight out of 14 states, and
the Democratic party remains in con
trol by fraud and counting the colored
vote.
"In many respects this campaign has
been a phenomenal and stormy one; in
fact, it has no parallel in our history.
Many grave questions confronted the
committeee which required careful con
sideration, and perhaps but few realize
the critical position the party occupied.
The industrial army movement, as well
as the strikes and general discontent,
introduced a new feature into the poli
tical arena, which demanded close at
tention. On these questions we were;
flooded with letters demanding that our
committee issue an address indorsing
the industrial army movement and in-'
vriing every one to come to Washington,
while others as zealously demanded
that we denounce it in the severest
terms. The same was true of the great
coal and railroad strikes, which were
the cause of some very acriminius
correspondence between some good
Populists and headquarters. -Although
we at the time were severely criticized
by both sides for remaining silent, yet
I think that time has proven that the
policy of the committee was best.
"Populists, in making a special and
radical study of economic conditions,
are well aware that not all the evils of
our times proceed wholly from one
source. Our platform has been a broad
protect against the most visible and
most piratical forms of present mono
poly. At the same time, and above all
else, we have been the only political
organization of sufficient capacity and
information to comprehend that the one
paramount question on which depends
not only the immediate welfare of the
masses, but even the civilization of a
great nation. This is the money ques
tionthe question as to whether tho
American people shall be permitted to
have the vehicle of exchanging labor
and all things produced by labor, in
such a volume that they can live by
honest industry, and not be turned,
with no fault of their own, into beggars
and tramps is the paramount to all
others. ,
"As the demand for money is equal
to the demand for other things, so is
the demand for monetary reform equal
to the demand for all other industrial
reforms combined. The money ques
tion involves all others, and is one-half
of each industrial question the mind
can conceive.
"I believe we ought to begin at once
to organize for the great conflict of
1S56, and concentrate all our force on
tho money question. To do this we
must have a conference of all our lead
ers, map out a policy, and make a
vigorous educational campaign.'
COIiOBESS AGAIH 1H SESSiO'i
Congress Convenes for the FlnI
Fifty-Third Session.
NO APPLAUSE FOR THE MESSAGE
Mr. Clevelacd'a Message la Favor of the
Bankers Controlling the Financial
Affair f the Land.
Washington, Dec. 3. The opening of
the second session of the Fifty -third
congress after a recess of three months
made the big white marble capitol
building a center of interest today.
Early in the day th6 corridors began
to fill with the crowd which is always
attracted by the assembling of congress.
There was added interest, owing to the
political revolution which had recently
occured, but it was not a struggling
mass of humanity, such as some times
marks the great events of congress.
The president's message was to be
presented in both houses, and this
meant that there would be no sharp de
bates, as the reading cleik would have
the floor for two hours or more during
the reading of the message. The crowd
seemed te be drawn mainly to the house
end of the capitol, as it was here that
the recent political storm had made its
marks most apparent.
The galleries were well filled, though
not overcrowded, and the spectators
showed an eager interest in the arrival
of each conspicuous figure on the floor.
Congressional veterans who had spent
a good share of their lives in the house
of representatives came into it for their
final session, the recent tidal wave
having retired most of the leaders of
the majority, but there were but few
disconsolate faces among the defeated,
and they joined with the members of
the minority in good natured sallies
across the middle asile, which is the
political dead line.
Occasionally there was a round of ap
plause as some leader made his appear
ance. The best known ones Burrows,
Bland, Reed and Wilson were not
among the early arrivals, and the galle
ries were in expectancy until those
party favorites put in an appearance.
In the senate there was another crowd
which filled the galleries without any
crowding. A now rule has been put
into operation, limiting the reserve
galleries to those personally introduced
by senators, instead of thoso holding
cards of admissiour The senators were
late in arriving and some of those who
had been most conspicuous in recent
public events, notably Senator Hill of
New York, were absent. The usual
dignity and decorum which marks all
senatorial sessions kept the galleries
from showing their manifestations of
approval, which marked the opening of
the house session.
At 1:35 Mr. Pruden, the president's
executive cierk, appeared with the mes
sage, which, by direction of the speaker,
was read by the house clerk, Mr. Kerr.
The reading of the message occupied
one hour and forty-five minutes. It
was listened to with careful attention
and especially the portions relating to
the tariff and the banking scheme, but
there was no demonstration whon it
was concluded.
SEES XOTHIXG BUT GOLD.
Cleveland's Message for a Gold Basis and
ft Stab at Silver.
Washington, Dec. 3 The president's
message to congress is an exceedingly
lengthy one. Fully one-half is devoted
to foreign and diplomatic affairs, The
most interesting portion is the recom
mendations to congress on the financial
affairs.
His scheme to save the country from
bankrnptcy is to turn over to the
bankers the exclusive perogative of
supplying the country with money. It
wouid then rest with them to say how
much or how little circulating medium
the people should have. Should this
policv be carried out untold distress
and destitution would certainly follow
He has nothing whatever to say on the
arid land question or about irrigation.
He is also strangely silent about the
good or evil effects of the repeal of the
Sherman law. On the financial ques
tion he says:
"During the last month the gold re
serve in the treasury for the purpose
of redeeming the notes of the govern
ment circulating as money in the hands
of the people became so reduced, and
its further depletion m the near future
seemed so certain, that m the exercise
of proper care for the public welfare
it became necessarv to replenish the
reserve and thus maintain popular
faith in the ability and determination
of the government to meet, as agreed,
its pecuniary obligations. It would
have been well if in this emergency tne
authority had existed to issue the
bonds of the government bearing a low
rate of interest and maturing within a
short period, but the congress having
failed to confer such authority, resort
was necessarily had to the resumption
act of 1S75, and, pursuant to its provi
sions, bonds were issued drawing in
terest at the rate of 5 per cent per an
num and maturing 10 years after their
issue, that being the shortest time au
thorized by the act. I am glad to say,
however, that on the sale of these bonds
the premium received operated to re
duce the rate of interest to be paid by
the government to less than 3 per cent.
"Nothing could be worse or further
remove! from sensible finance than
the relatious existing between the cur
rency the government has issued, the
gold held for its redemption, and the
means which must be resorted to for
the purpose of replenishing such re
demption fund when impaired. Even
if the claims upon this fund were con
fined to tho obligations originally in
tended, and if the redemption of these
obligations meant their cancellation,
the fund would be very small But
these obligations, when received and
redeemed in gold, are not canceled, but
are reissued, and may do duty many
times by way of drawing gold from tho
treasury. Thus we have an endless
chain in operation, constantly deplet
ing the treasury's gold, and never near
a final rest As if this were not bad
6nough, we have, by a statutory de.
claration that it is the policy of the
government to maintain the parity be
tween gold nd silver, added to the
iorce and momentum of this exhaust
ing process and added -largely to the
currency obligations claiming this pe
culiar gold redemption. Our small
gold reserve is thus subject to drain
from every side. The demands that in
crease our danger also increases the
necessity of protecting the reserve
against depletion, and it 3 most unsat
isfactory to know that the protection
afforded is only a temporary palliation.
It is perfectly and palpably plain that
the only way under present conditions
by which the reserve, when dangerous
ly depleted, can . be replenished, is
through the issue and sale of the bonds
of the government for gold, and yet
congress has not only thus far declined
to authorise the issue of bonds best
suited to such a purpose, but there
seems a disposition in some quarters
to deny both the necessity and power
for the issue of bonds at aiL I cannot
for a moment believe! that any of our
citizens are deliberately willing that
their government should default in its
pecuniary obligations, or that its finan
cial operations should be reduced to a
silver basis. At any rate, I should not
feel that my duty was done if I omitted
any effort I could make to avert such a
calamity. As long therefore, as no
provision is made for the final redemp
tion or the putting aside of the curren
cy obligation now used to repeatedly
and constantly draw from the govern
ment its gold, and as long as no better
authority for bond issues is allowed
than at present exists, such authority
will be utilized whenever and as often
as it becomes necessary to maintain a
ufflcient gold reserve, and in abund
ant time to save the credit of our coun
try and make good the financial de
clarations cf our government."
TO REPEAL BANKING LAWS.
G rover's Flan to Make Thin ji Eav far the
Banks.
On banks and banking laws Cleve
land, in his message says:
"Questions relating to our banks and
currency are closely connected with the
subject just referred to, and they also
present some unsatisfactory features.
Prominent among them are the lack of
elasticity In our currency circulation,
and its frequent concentration in fi
nancial centers when it is most needed
in other parts of the country. The ab
solute diveroement of the government
from the business of banking is the
ideal relationship of the government
to the circulation of the currency of
country. This condition cannot be
immediately reached, but as a step in
that direction, and as a means of secur
ing a more elastic currency and obviat
ing other objections to the present ar
rangement of bank circulation.
"it is proposed to repeal all laws pro
viding for the deposit of United States
bonds as security for circulation; to
permit national banks to issue circula
ting notes not exceeding in amount 75
per cent of their paid up and unimpair
ed capital, provided they deposit wtih
the government as a guarantee fund in
United States legal tender notes, in
cluding treasury notes of 1390, a sum
equal in amount to 30 per cent of the
notes they desire to issue, this deposit
to be maintained at all times. But
whenever any bank retires any part
of its circulation a proportional amount
of its guarantee fund should be re
turned to it; to permit the secretary of
the treasury to prepare and keep on
hand ready for issue in case an in
crease in circulation is desired, blank
national bank notes for each bank hav
ing circulation; and to repeal the pro
visions of the present law imposing
limitations and restrictions upon banks
desiring to reduce or increase their
circulation, thus permitting such in
crease or reduction within the limit
of 75 per cent of the capital to be
quickly made as emergency may arise.
In addition to the guarantee fund
required it is proposed to provide
a safety fund for the immediate re
demption of the circulating notes of
failed banks by imposing a small an
nual tax, say one-half of 1 per cent
upon the average circulation of
each bank until the fund amounts to
5 per cent of the total circulation
outstanding. When a bank fails its
guarantee fund is to be paid into this
redeemed iu the first instance from such
redemption fund and its notes are to be
safety fund thusauguniented; and im
pairment of such fund caused thereby
to be made good from the immediate
available cash assets of said bank, and
if these should be insufficient, such
impairment to bo made good by pro
rata assessment among the other banks,
their contributions constituting a first
lein upon the assets of the failed bank
in favor of the contributing banks.
As a further security, it Is contemplated
that the existing proposition; fixing the
individual liability of stockholders, is
to be retained, and the bank's indebted
ness on account of its circulation notes
to be made a first lien on all its assets
for the purpose of meeting the expense
of printing notes, official supervision,
cancellation and other like charges.
There shall be imposed a tax of say one
half of 1 per rent per annum upon the
average amount of notes in circula
tion. It is further provided that there
shall be no national bank notes issued
of a less denomination than 10. That
each national bank, except in case of a
failed bank shall redeem or retire its
notes in the first instance at its own
office or at agencies to be designated
bv it.
"Another very important feature oY
this plan is the exemption of state
banks from taxation bjN the United
States in cases where it is'sUown to the
satisfaction of the secretary cf the
treasury and comptroller or the cur
rency by banks, claimiiig suck exemp
tion, that they have had onfei&ndiss
their circulating notes exceeding 75
per cent of their paid up and unim
paired espit&l; that their stockholder
are individually iiable for the redemp
tion of their circulating notes consti
tutes under their 6tate law a first lien
upon their assests; that such banks
have kept and maintained a gurantee
fund in United States legal tender
notes, including treasury notes of 1890,
equal to 30 per cent of their outstand
ing circulating notes; and that such
banks have promptly redeemed their
circulating notes when presented at
their principal or branch office.
"It is quite likely that this scheme
may be usefully amended in some of
its details, but I am satisfied it fur
nishes a basis for a very great improve
ment in our present banking and cur
rency system. I conclude this com
munication, fully appreciating that
the responsibility for legislation affect
ing the people of the United States
rests upon their representatives in the
congress and assuring them that
whether in accordance with recom
mendations I have made or not I shall
be glad to co-operate in perfecting any
legislation that tends to the prosperity
and welfare of our country.
"Another subject of pressing moment
referred to by the attorney general is
the re-organization of the Union Pa
cific railroad company on a basis equit
able as regards all private interests
and as favorable to the government as
existing condition will permit. The
operation of a railroad by a court
through a receiver is an anomalous
slate of things which should be termi
nated on all grounds, public and pri
vate, at the earliest possible moment.
Besides, not to enact the needed en
abling legislation at the present ses
sion, postpones the whole matter until
the assemblage of a new congress, and
iuevitably increases all the complica
tions of the situation, and could not
but be regarded a signal failure to
solve a problem which has practically
been before the present congress ever
since its organization eight years ago."
THE TARIFF.
Wants Coal and Iron Tut on the I'rje
LUt.
In the tariff recommendations of the
message, Mr. Clevand sajs:
"The tariff act passed at the last ses
sion of congress needs important
amendments if it is executed effective
ly and with certainty. In addition to
such necessary amendments as w ill not
change rates of duty, I am still very
decidedly in favor of putting coal and
iron on the free list. So far as the
sugar schedule is concerned, 1 would
be glad, under existing aggrations, to
see every particle of defferential duty
iu favor of refined duty stricken out of
our tariff law. I earnestly repeat here
tho recommendation I have made in
another portion of this communication
that the additional duty of one-tenth
of a cent per pound laid upon sugar
imported fom foreign countries pay
ing a bounty on its export be abrogated.
It seems to me that exceedingly im
portant considerations point to the
propriety of this amendment. With
the advent of a new tariff policy not
only contemplated to relieve the con
sumers of our land in the cost of their
daily life, but to invite a better develop
ment of American thrift, and create
for us closer and more profitable rela
tions with the rest of the world, it fol
lows as a logical and imperative neces
sity that we should renove the chief, if
not the only, obstacle which has long
prevented our participation in the for
eign carrying trade upon the sea. The
tariff built upon the theory that it is
well to check imports and that a home
market should bound the industry and
effort of American producers was fitly
supplemented by a refusal to allow
American registry to vessels built
abroad, though owned and navigated
by our own people, thus exhibiting a
willingness to abandon all contest for
the advantages of American trans
oceanic carriage. Our new tariff policy, 1
built upon the theory that it is well to
encourage such importations as our
people need, and that our products and
manufactures should find markets in
every part of the habitable globe, it is
consistently supplemented by the great
est possible liberty to our citizens in
the ownership and navagation of ships
iu which onr products and manufact
ures may be transported. The millions
now paid to foreigners for carrying
passengers and products across the sea
should be turned into American hands.
Shipbuilding, which has been protected
to strangulation, should be revived by
the prospect of profitable employment
for ships when built and the American
sailor should be resurrected and again
take his phee a sturdy and industri
ous citizen in time of peace and a pa
triotic and safe defender of American
interests in the day cf conflict. The
ancient provision of our law denying
the American registry to ships built
abroad and owned by Americans ap
pears, in the light of present condi
tions, not only to be a failure for good
at every point, but to be nearer a relic
of barbarianism than anything that ex
ists under the permission of a statute
of tho United States. I earnestly re
commend its prompt appeal.
