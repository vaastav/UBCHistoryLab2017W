IT'S TOO DEEP TOR US
When President Wilson in his message to congress asserted that in
his opinion the interned German ship officers and men should be in the
penitentiary, same as other enemy aliens, and not provided with lavish
quarters, fed on the fat of the land and allowed to have a good time, he
seemed to have awakened to the fact that the United States is treating
her enemy prisoners in a manner befitting a diplomatic mission from a
foreign country.
A few days ago Lieutenant Berg and others of the crew of a large in-
terned German liner escaped from their place of internment, but luckily
were recaptured, Berg and another officer being caught on the border and
endeavoing to get into Mexico.
Quite recently a story was published which stated that the United
States government was paying large salaries to these German prisoners,
enemies of the government, and the articles prompted an inquiry to the
Committee on Public Information, Washington. The writer said he had
heard the statements had said interned German captains were drawing
94,000 per year from ttffe United State*, whereas 4f tttCy W^ere serving on'
their own ships they wo\ild receive bul? $2,300.
The committee on Public Information replied as follows:
"It is entirely true that the government is paying salaries to German
officers In the detention camps in this country. In this connection I call
your attention to the laws and customs of war on land, Article 17 of the
Annex, adopted by the Hague convention, October 18, 1917:
"Officers taken prisoner shall receive the same rate of pay
as officers of corresponding rank In the country where they are
detained, the amount to be ultimately refunded by their own
government." You will perceive that in thiB matter we are merely bearing ourselves
with the proud punctilio for which the President pleaded in his war mes-
sage."
Maybe this is all right but we believe the German government con-
sidered its solemn treaties as "scraps of paper We think It might not
be out of place for the United States to stretch a little and consider any
agreement that would pay large salaries to enemy aliens, prisoners of the
nation which sunk the Lusitania with the heavy loss of life of American
women and children, a nation that has shelled life boats with women and
children struggling for their lives, a "scrap of paper" also. We can't
quite get the Idea of providing them with better comforts than they had
at home and paying them a fat salary in addition.
But, as we remarkedmaybe it is all right. However, we can't see
it.
THOSE "NEW NATIONAL ANTHEMS"
At various intervals some one bursts forth with a new so-called
patriotic song which some batted belfry individuals happen to seize upon
as being what the United States has been waiting for lo, these many years,
as the nation's sterotyped, nickle plated, ball bearing, duly recognized
anthem.
These "patriotls" have lost sight of the history of the United States.
They have lost sight of what this country has passed through and the his-
toric Incidents so dear to the hearts of every true patriot. These addle-
pated specimens of patriotism who would throw the sacred Star Spangled
Banner into the scrap pile and substitute some "artistic" modern day
piece of junk would rewrite the Ten Commandments, if they could get
away with it, arrogating to themselves the belief that they could improve
upon them.
There are a lot of misguided individuals who are always looking for
something to change in the history of the United States and in loved tra-
ditions. They like to prate upon the profanity of George Washington,
the father of his country they will talk glibly that Paul Revere never
made his historic ride they like to puncture the history of their country
and sneer at the gallant General Grant because he drank liquor.
The birth of the Star Spangled Banner was couched in one of the
most noted incidents of the War of 1812. It has served the United 'States
since that time and become recognized by the nation as Its anthem. Who
is there who can say ne can "vrlte a national anthem more beloved than
the one born in the early days of the War of 1812 when the United States
was in danger of foreign invasion?
Some of the best patriotic speeches we have heard were not uttered
by polished orators, yet some will say the Star Spangled Banner is not
a gem of the work of a music master.
But the Star Spangled Banner and Its author will live in the hearts
of the nation when the reformers of the national anthem won't even be
honored by having a side street named after 'em.
