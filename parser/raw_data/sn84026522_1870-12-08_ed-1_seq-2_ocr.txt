The Question of a Convention.
Several resolutions are now pending
before the Legislature on the above
lighly important subject. We ar.
phased to see the spirit which seems to
actuate the members in relation to the
Conventi .11. They are acting cau
tiously, cain.lv, deliberately. This .s
an earnest that they will act wisely and

In annecuon-with the subject of
Convention, we like the resolutions in
troduced in the. Senate on last Satur
day, declaring the sense of the people
of North Carolina in regard to the
hoaiestead and the riKht of suffrage p
The first resolution enacts that the
people of North Carolina are opposed
to any ameuduieut of tbe Constitution
which alters article 10 of that instru
nient, guaranteeing the homestead and
personal property exemption, and that
the decision of the Supreme Court on
this subject should remain the settled
law of the land. The second resolu
tioa declares "that the right of suf.
frage as secured by the Constitution
of this State ought, for all time, to re
main inviolable, thereby granting to
every class of our male population re
gardless of race, color or previous con
, . ,. f ;
the inalienable privilege ot

the people of North Carolina."
We admire the spirit of these two
resolutions, and heartily endorse them.
In calliug a Convention, it is well to
let the people know that we do not pro
pnse to interfere with the homestead
law and the riirht of suffrage. This

takes the wind completely Irom the!

sails of the Radicals who are attempt-
inz to raise a ircat hue and cry about !
the rights of which
the Democratic
Convention would deprive the people,
and especially the colored voters, if one
should be called by the Legislature.
We n:ust act in the purest good
faith; at the same time with strict
candor, impartiality and boldness.
A Convention will be called to cor -
rect abuses; to abolish the present evils
' under which our people are labr ring ;
to form a more suitable and economical
Constitution ; to da away with useless
and expensive offices; to lop off the
extravagant brandies which the carpet
bag abortion has introduced into our
system ; and, in a word, to retuod.-l

Removal of Governor Vance's
Disabilities.
The friends of General Abbott as
sert that, there is no probability that
Governor Vance's disabilities will be
removed by Congress, and iu the event
of the refusal of Congress to relieve
him, that Abbott will claim the feat iu
the United States S nafe. on the ground
cf receiving the next highest nutiiber
of votes. The Standard already boasts
that Abbott is entitled to the position
While it has beeD the policy of Con-
gres.a, heretofore, to seat the minority
candidates, when those who received
tho majority were ineligible, yet this
has beeu doue only in the House of
Representatives, and we trut it will
not be attempted in the Senate.
Gove'nor Vance, it is said, Las as-
surancesirom nigh Republican sources,

ises to resign, and thus allow the Leg -

ises ; but there seems to be a strong We too well know their onlv nhWt
feeling throughout the North in fivor
of enfranchisement and universal am
nesty, as we stated last week It mnu
h that the Radical Congress will pay
some heed to the popuhtr will on this
subject, so unmistakably expressed, re-
cently, through the ballot box, and pass
a general amnesty bill. If so. Governor
Vance will be permitted to take his
seat, and we will then have iu the
United States Senate an able champion j
and an eloquent advocate of our rights
nd interests. But we very much
doubt Covgresxional clcmencj.
The claim of Abbott to ti e Sena
torship is as arrogant as it is unfound
ed. Receiving only forty-three out oi
all the votes cast by the Legislature,
being a little more thau one fourth, it
will be a fit aud appropriate finale oil

themselves with infamy and disgrace.
It has been suggested by some that
the better plan to get rid of the whole
crew who have been preying upon the
vitals of the State for more than two
3ears. will be to call a Convention to
alter the Constitution, and thus wipe
out at one stroke the whole brood o'
political cormorants who have bank
rupted North Carolina, profaned the
sacred temple of justice, and through
the Legislative, Judicial and Exee

nieut combined, torn do.vn the safe
.Miards of the Constitution aud scatter

former greatness and glory.
In favor of this plaD, expediency,
economy and certainty are claimed.
We are iudifferent as to the process,
provided the guilty officials be speedily
ousted from their positions. It there
he any other plan than impeachment
whereby Holden. Pearson Junes, Watts
and others who have so plainly, shame
lessly and corruptly violated the law,
can he disposed of summarily, without
the delay, expense, excitement and
raucor which might be incidental to a
trial of impeachment, then it would
perhaps be belter to adopt that plan.

The above remarks apply with pecu

State, which have been parading their
(so-called) Democracy to the world,
and, at the same time, so far as their
pitiful influence was concerned, aiding
and abetting the Radical party. Is it
not a little remarkable that the editors
of such papers never in their lives
voted a straight-out old line Democratic

view of harmonizing all the elemeotB
opposed to Radicalism, much pains
have, been taken to give the old line
Democrats and Whigs an equal voice
in controlling the organization. We
regret the same wise policy has not
been pursued in this State. For the
sake of defeating the Radicals, the old
line Democrats in North Carolina, as
a party, have wheeled into line, and
have battled agaibsi.a"d will continue to
battle against the cohorts of Radical
ism, regardless of party names or asso

driven into the support of Radicalism
under any circumstances, or while
smarting undt-r any wrongs ; and while
we protest against the policy which has
excluded them thus far from almost
any share in the distribution of politi
cal honors won since the war by what
is known as tbe Conservative rart,
they wi!!, for the sake of harmony,
continue to labor with any organization

Bay of Samana. lie urges early action
on the part of Congress, aud suggests
that by a joint resolution of the two
Houses the Executive shall be author
ized to appoint a Commiason to nego
tiate a treaty with the authorities of
&an Domingo for the acquisition of that
island, and that an appropr'ation be
made to defray the expenses of said
Commission. The question might then
be determined, either by the action of
the Senate on the treaty, or by the
action of both Houses ou a resolution
of annextion, as in the case of Texas.
He calls the attention of Congress to
the continuance and extension of the
Mexican Free Zone, and to the Tien
stein marsacre.
In regard to the Alabama claims he
recommends thattongiess authorize
the appointmetit of a Conimissiou to
take proof as to these claims, and that
authority be given for their settlement
by the United States so that the Gov
ernment shall have the ownership of
the private claims as well as the respon
sible control of all the demands against
Great Britain. In regard to the Cana
dian fisheries, he complains that the
course of the Canadian authorities has
not been marked by a friendly feeling,
and intimates that if they should at
tempt to enforce a certain act of the
Dominion Parliament, it wi 1 be his du
ty to take such steps as may be neces
sary to protect the interests of United
States citizens. He asks that power
be conferred upun him to suspend the
operation of laws authorizing the
transit ot merchandise, in bond, th rough
the United States to Canada, and also
to suspend the operation of any laws
whereby the vessels of the Dominion
ire permitted to enter the waters of the

that measures may be taken to permit

gard to the currency the President says

very gratifying, but that the instabili

our prosperity. He- thinks that the
time hasarrived when, by wise and
prudent legislation, Congress should
look to a policy whicfi would place cur

day In regard to revenue reform he
says if i means to keep the revenue
down to what is necessary ior the sup
port of the Government and the pay
ment of interest on tbe public debt it
has his hearty support; but if it mean 9
failure to provide the necessary means
to defray all of th expenses of the

Serenade to .'Gov. Vance -Speech.
-His
Governor Vance was serenaded at
his lodgings at the Exchange Hotel
the evening of hia election as Senator.
Having just prepared to leave the city
by the Western train, the address was
necessarily short. He said:
Fellow Citizens : I hardly know
what to say, how much to say, and how
much not to say. I should be either
more or less than human if I did uot
feel grateful to you and the people of
North Carolina for many kindnesses.
1 am unable to account for the kind
; ui's ol the people in honoring me to
often.' 1 know it cannot be lor any
superior merit of oiy own. 1 can only
tribute it to one thing. Human

I State, in her sovereign capacity, at
J tempted to disserver her connection
I with that Union I then elected to go
j with my State, my kith and kio. Hav
iuir joined the army I determined to
serve the new cause with the same un
swerving zeal with which I had served
that of tbe Union. I was called upon

Governor ; 1 clung with you to the
cause, and did not surrender my au-

Cnniederate had laid down his arms.
Alter the war terms upon conditions
were held out to t.ht nonrile nf I h Smith.
1 would not accept terms that would
separate me from you and the brave
bos who went at your bidding. The
longest road has a turn. I did not
wish to rise until I could rise With you.
Thank God, that time has arrived. We
go up now. We may go down again,
but will go down together ; and 1 will
have witb me good company, the best
and bravest hearts in tbeland with me.
Lecausc our party has been triumphant
there are some who urge retaliation.
This should not be so. The best aoti-
, doie for tyranny, the strongest weapon
a-ar.t it, is tbe enactment ot just and
. ....
the government ol North Carolina in
our lianas, we snouia not ami to avenge
ourselves for tbe overriding of civil
iiberty auions us, but we should so ar
ranue that it cannot happen again
should see to it that no executive or
other authority can again attempt to
dvstroy our liberties. From the ob
taining of Magna Charta to the pres
ent day no attempt to override or
abridge it has been made that has not
more firmly reestablished liberty. May
it be so here. It is true that in the
last five years we have felt what it is to
be without trial by jury, to have arrests
among us without warrant, and the
freedom of the press abridged. All the
people understand it now. It behooves
us now to build up tbe great principles-
ot civil hbertj ou the eternal rock of
our great country. Let anger, revenge,
and retaliation be ignored, and let the
laws on your statute book bear the im
press of a free people determined legi
timately to maintain'their freedom. In
my place in the Senate, I shall endeav
or to serve my great State and my
country with honor. That I shall be
admitted to serve you scarcely admits
of a doubt. The President's message,
it is said, will foreshadow amnesty, and
the recnt elections show the hand
writing on the wall. There are many
great statesmen among the dominant
party in Congress, representing large
constituencies, among hom a tremen
dous revolution in sentiment on these
questions has taken place. Those men
and the great American people,wbo after
a long war of blood and carnage, result
ing in the freedom of the African, will
no longer tolerate the enslavement of
the Anglo-Saxon. Every law. both
State and national, should be respect-.-d
and obeyed by all our people, bit
terness and vituperation should cease,
and men, no looger endeavoring to de
stroy each other, should earnestly
strive to engender kindly feelings among
all classes of our citizens. To bring
about these desirable ends will be the
earnest aim of my life, in Congress and
else w here I thank you, fellow citizens
for your compliment.
After the performances of several
pieces by the Raleigh Colored Brass
Band, Governor Vance left on the
Western train foi hi hone in Charlotte.

The Homestead and Suffrage
Question in tlid Legisla
. ture. .
The following action of tbe Senate
on Saturday last upon a resolution de
claratory of the sense of the people t f
the State upon the subject of the home
stead, personal property exemption and
the right or sultrage, wiU be read with
interest, as emphatically falsifying the
charges of the Radicals that the Dem
ocratic party intended to interfere with
these privileges :
Jtesolved, That the people of North
Carolina are unalterably opposed to any
amendment of the Constitution whereby
the Homesteae and personal property
exemption, secured by virtue of artic
le 10, may be suspended and that the
constitutionality of said article, as ex
pounded by the Supreme Court ot North
Carolina, meets the approval of the
people of Nerth Carolina and should be
regarded as the settled law of the land..
Resolved, That the right of suffrage
as secured by the Constitution of this
State ought for aJl time to re.ua in in
violable, thereby granting to every
class of our male population, regardloss
of race, color or previous condition, the
inalienable privilege of voting for eve
ry office and place of trust conferred
by the Constitution, aod that any ef
fort to abridge the right of suffrage is
contrary to the genius of our Govern
ment and incomputable with the se
curity and rights belonging to the
people of North Caroiioa.
Mr Morehead moved to amend the
1st resolution by inserting "nor upon
the subject of mechanics' and laborers'
lein law," which was adopted.
Mr. Olds moved to amend by adding
the following proviso : Provided, It be
held as lawful, that tbe Homestead
shall not be exempt from executions in
criminal cases, which was voted down.
G. W. Price, (col.) offered a substi
tute for the resolutions declaiing that
any attempt made to amend tbe Cn
stitution at this time would be revolu
tiouary in its tendency and should not
be attempted, which was voted dowu
Mr Linuey offered to amend as fol
lows: '
Resolved further, That it be the sense
of this body that the Homestead pro
visions do not apply to damages rjcov-
ered iu action tx de icto
Mr. Morehead remarked that he
hoped that this resolution would go out
in such a form that a "wayJaring man
though a fool" would understand that
his Homestead was safe, that suffrage
would not be interfered with and that
a laborer could always under any cir
cumstance receive the compensation !
i - i iri j.l
be no latin phrase stuck to this, that
designing men might use to misguide
those who are not versed in law pharscs.
Mr. Speed endorsed the remarks of
the Senator from lloekinham, and was
opposed to all amendments that wt u'd
touch the-Homestead in any manner,
and the amendment was voted down.
On motion of Mr. Graham the clause
in the 1st resolution "meets the ap
proval of the people of North Carolina"
was stricken out and tbe rcsolutiou as
amended passed.
