Gov. McKinley says the voice of

which isall rightenoughj buthe makes
the mistake of confoundiug himself
with patriotism which is all wrong.
Theke are some Republicans who
seem to have an idea that the Presiden
tial campaign Is already on. Better
turn off some of the pressure boys.
You haven't fuel enough to keep it up
three yeare.
The Republican press should get to
gether. One Republican editor says
the new tariff bill discriminates agnlnst
the south, while another says the Wil
son bill is simply a sectional measure,
favoring the south. Get your heads to
gether, gentlemen.
Chairman Wilson and his demo
cratlc collengues on the House Ways
and Means committee should consider
the abuse they are getting from Re
publicans because of the tariffbill, the
very highest praise that could have
been bestowed upon them. II is cer
tainly regarded as such by all other
good Democrats.
Sugar should be on the free list, but
a tariff bill that puts it there is not a
tariff bill advocated by Democrats.
New York Tribune,
It was the Republicans who placed
a tax upon sugar and also granting a
bounty both outrages upon the cou
sumers.. Democrats hare started to
cutting off ths bounty and the tariff
will be taken off iu time;
Since' the Wilson tariff reform bill
has been made public and President
Cleveland sent his annual message to
Congress, the Republican calamity
claquers are making more noise than
ver. Let thera howl, they have had
their day. The Democrats are at the
helm now.and the people will be heard.
This country was Intended for others
outside of a few Republicans bosses,
rich corporations, and grinding mo
nopolista.
The President's Hewt.
We lay before our reader this week
the message of resident Cleveland.
The document Is lenghty, but U wan
ly, straightforward and easily under
stood.
As the document will be read by
everybody, it Is useless to here go over
nil it contains, but a few choice sayings
will not be out of place.
The president Is still Arm In his be
lief that the tariff needs revision, and
he heartily endorses the Wilson bill
and counsels Its passage; he starts In
on tariff revisl-m with a lecture on that
problem, iu which he congratulates the
country on the fact that the friends of
tariff reform are at last at the helm.
He then turns to congress and assures
that body that "if there Is any
thingiu the theory of a repre
sentation In public places, of the peo
ple and their desires, if public officers
are really the servants of the people,
and If political promises and profes
sions have any binding force, our fail
ure to give the relief so long awaited
will be sheer recreancy. .Nothing
should intervene to distract our atten
tion or disturb our effort until this re
form Is accomplished by wise and care
ful legislation."
As a legacy from the Republican ad
ministration the following statements
of Mr. Cleveland are pertiment.
At this time when a depleted public
treasury confronts us, when many of
our people are engaged In a hard strug
gle for the necessities of life and when
enforced economy is pressing upon the
irreat mass of your countrymen. 1 de
sire to urge with all the earnestness at
my command Iliac congressional legi
luiion be so limited by strict economy
as -to exhibit an appreciation of the
condition of the treasury and a sympa
thy with the straitened circumstances
of our fellow citizens.
The duty of public economy is also
of immense importance in lis intimate
and necessary relation to the task now
in hand of providing revenue to meet
government expenditures and yet re
ducing tho people's burden of federal
tuxutiou.
Indeed, it is true that no question is
of such great Importance as the tarifl
question at this time. Business is at a
standstill, money lies Idle in our banks,
workmen are anxiously waiting in
idleuess at their homes, hoping and ex
pecting that something will be done by
which business will be resumed and
prosperity come again.
The pension question is dealt with
fairly and honestly. In dwelling up
on this matter the President says:
"I am unable to understand why
frauds in the pension rolls should not
be exposed aud corrected with thor
oughness and vigor. Every name
fraudently put upon these rolls, is a
wicked imposition upon the kindly
sentiment in which pensions have
theirorigin; every fraudulent pension
er lias become a bad citizen; every
false oath in support of a pension ha
made perjury more common, and false
and undeserving pensioners rob the
people not only of their mouey, but
of their patriotic sentiment which the
survivors of a war, fought for the pres
ervation of the Union, ought to in
spire. '
The thousands of neighborhood?
have their well known fraudulent pen
sioners, and recent developments b,
tho bureau, establish appalling con
spiracies' to accomplish pension frft'igg.
By nonltaus uo lust wrong don
is to brave ana deserving pensioner
who certainly ought not to be con
detuned to such associations.
l'hosa who attempt, in the line 'of
duty, to rectify these wrongs shoulo
not be accused or enmity or ltidiiter-
etice to the claims of honest veterans.
The sum expended on account oi
pensions for the year ending June 30,
1893, was $150,740,407.14.
The cntnmiMtloner estimates thai
$105,000,000 will bo required to pay
pensions during the year ending J uut
30, 1804."
Got Vaccinated Quick.
While not desiring to be considered
an alarmist, Secretary Probst, of the
State Board of Health,' believes that
public attention should be called to
the necessity for vaccination.
"We have not had a general small
pox scare in this country since 1881,"
said the Doctor, "aud the result is that
very few of the children born since
then have been vaccinated. There
are lots or them ana an epidemic ot
small-pox might carry many of them
to their graves."
Dr. Probst says there are seats of the
epidemic now iu New York, Connecti
cut, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio.
Indiana, Illinois, fttinnesota, Kentucky
and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania there
are eight places where small-pox is epl
detnlc, and in five of them the health
authorities have been unable to dis
cover its origin. This puts them at
great disadvantage In trying to contro
it and stamp it out. It was due largely
to the inability of the State Board of
Health of Ohio to discover the real
origin of the disease at Akron last year
that prevented prompt control of the
epidemic there.
The discovery of the origin of the
epidemic at Knoxville and Nashville
Tenn.. shows that the condition is
alarming there. At the first-named
place it has beeu traced to a man who
cleans the railway cars, and at Louis
ville, Ky., to a man who is employed
in a laundry where the bedding of Pull
man sleeping cars is washed. These
facts are taken by Dr. Probst to show
that the germs are scattered along the
channel or travel in these states and
there is no telling how many have
been Infected.
The lesson of the hour is that every
one, and especially every parent, who
have children that have not already
been vaccinated, vaccinated at once
The Wilson tariffbill is all right,
notwithstanding the Republican howl
against It. In fact, that howl is enough
of Itself to convince any doubting
Domocrat that the bill is all right.

HINISTER WILLIS AWAITING INSTRUC
TIONS FROM WASHINGTON.
tine Ilia Arrival New . Development
Hare Hade It Necessary Far Illm to
Ileur From Mr. Cleveland Before Pro
ceeding to Carry Out Original Iiisiruc
tiona It May lie Several Week.
Port Townsknd. Wash.. Dee. B.
The barkoutino Klichitat, Captain Cut
ler, has just arrived from Honolulu
with advices to Nov. 'JO, fonr days after
the steamer Alameda sailed for Sun
Francisco.
In an interview published in the
Honolulu Evening Star, Minister Willis
is reported to have said:
"You are authorized to state that no
change in the present situation wil 1
take place for several weeks. I'brought
with me certain instructions from the
United States government on the Ha
waiian situation. Since my arrival
contingencies have arisen about which
neither the United States government
nor myself were aware when I left
Washington. I have thought best to
exercise the discretion allowed, and
submit those matters to Washington
before proceeding further to carry ont
my original instructions. No one need
fear trouble and no lawlessness will be
permitted."
This statement gave the annexation
its much satisfaction, aud the royalists
were much displeased.
The? editor of The Evening Star re
quested Minister Willis to submit a
statement to tho public to allay the
general feeling of uncertainty.
In a published interview Mr. Willis
said: "Yes. I believe that the time has
come when it is right and proper for
me ro use my discretion in this matter.
You are authorized to say for me that no
change in the prosent situation will
take place for several weeks."
Mr. Willis then made the statement
quoted above and added: "1 forwarded
my dispatches to Washington by today's
steamer, and until I receive an answer
to them no change will take place in
the present situation, nor will any bo
allowed."
"What do yon mean by the expres
sion 'nor will any be allowed?' "
"I must say just this, that until the
time comes for me to carry out my in
structions the peace and good order of
this coinmun ity will be kept undisturbed
in the interests of humanity; that any
attempt made by any parson or persons j
to make trouble will be promptly
checked and punished.
"You may put ths matter more plain
ly, and say that even if the provisional
government discharged all its troops
today no lawlessness would be allowed
for one moment under the present situ
ation of affairs. The whole Hawaiian
question is now in abeyance, and noth
ing that the newspapers can. Bay or do
will alter the situation one iota. I
make this statement on my own re
sponsibility and in the hope that it will
allay the present excitement. JNo one
need fear trouble and o lawlessness
will be permitted.
After this statement rumors began
to fly about that the queen's supporters
would make a final rally in her behalf.
The crews of the United States men-of-war
Philadelphia and Adams were held
in readiness to be landed on a moment's
notice.
The ouaen's advocate came out the
next day with a denial of the Willis in
terview, saying he was misquoted, and
bv inference gave encouragement to
the idea that Willis had or would re
ceive an imperative order to restore the
queen. Tho newspapers containing
iSlounts report narl not reacnea tne
islands when the Klickitat sailed.
Doubted In Washington.
Washington. Dec. 5. Officials of the
Btate department have received no ad
vices from Hawaii by the barkentine
Klicklitat, which arrived at Port Town-
send from Honolulu. They are inclined
to discredit and question the accuracy
of the purported interview witn minis
ter Willis in tne tionoiuiu evening
Star. They say that it would have
been improper for Minister Willis to
have thus expressed mmseir, ana tney
do not believe he made the statements
attributed to him.
The president and the department ot
state were evidently not expecting any
news from Honolulu Tuesday morning,
and the Associated .Press telegram, giv-
inn news received by a vessel irom
Honolulu, caused surprise. Secretary
Gresham was engaged Tuesday morning
with Justice Harlan, presumably on the
Bearing sea negotiation, and would not
ba seen. The impropriety of Minister
Willis' expressing as lie was reported to
have done bo was tne onty reason ad
vanced by other officials for discredit
ing the reported interview.

RUN DOWN ON A TRESTLE-
Lady Killed and Several People Injured
at F.a.t Liverpool, O.
East Liverpooi, O.. Dec. 2. A hor
rifying accident, resulting in tho death
of an estimable yonng lady and the in
jury of a number of others, occurred on
the electric street railway shortly be
fore 1 o'clock Friday morning.
About 20 Enst Liverpool people at
tended a private party at the bouse of
John Robinson, half way between the
sity proper and the East End. Shortly
after !!i o'clock the affair broke np. The
party from the city hailed the next car
westward, but was informed by the mo
lornian that it would run only to the
power bouse, a distance of a few blocks,
und that his was the last car.
The party then concluded to walk to
town, and to do so had to pass over a
trestle work, a distance of 100 feet.
They anticipated no danger, despite
the darkness, owing to the assurances
of the motorman that there, would be
no more cars. When half way across
the trestle the party was horrified to
see a car approaching from the east,
down a heavy inciine, at a terrific
speed.
Their screams were heard by the mo
torman, but he was unable to check the
car. and it came thundering toward
them. Some members of the party
jumped over the trestle, a distance of
about 13 feet, while others allowed
themselves to drop through the tics.
In the party were Mr. and Mrs. Mil
ler J. Harsha, a young couple, married
a little over a year ago, with their in
fant babe. Mr. Harsha advised his
wife to slip through the ties and acted
upon this advice himself. With the
baby in one arm he hung to the tie,
urging his wife to make haste, but be
fore she could follow him she was
struck by the rapidly moving car and
killed.
A number of others were painfully
but not dangerously injured.
Out of 14 in the party all but three
were more or less injured.
SKYSCRAPERS
AND EARTHQUAKES.
A Chic:.
Architect Hal Little Fear For
Structure! of Steel.
CniCAGO, Dec. 1. The earthquake
shocks reported from Montreal, Albany
and other eastern cities, have set the
occupants of Chicago skyscrapers seri
ously to thinking of what would prob
ably be their fate if this section ex
perienced a like seismic disturbance.
Chicago architects, however, do not
seem to feel any great apprehension as
to the danger to Chicago's tall build
ings from earthquake shocks, although
they admit that tho quake at Montreal
is bringing the matter pretty near
home.
"TThiie it is true that Chicago has
some extremely high buildings," said
an eminent architect in on interview,
it must be remembered that these
same buildings are constructed on a
new style of architecture. They are
built on skeleton frames of steel and
iron and are riveted and screwed to
gether from top to bottom. They could
not be shaken to pieces, and could
withstand any shock that was not great
enough to topple them over completely.
The real danger is m tne old cmia-
ings, constructed on the old plan. They
might rattle down, but none of them
are very tail, and many or tnem are
now being torn down and new style
ones built in their stead. In California
buildings are erected with earthquake
anchors attached to steady the walls
against shocks. I was in an earthquake
in that stats four years axo, and it is
not a pleasant experience. V hue tnere
might be no danger to the occupants of
ths tall buildings here in case of a
shock, I would nevertheless prefer to
be on the ground."
INCOME TAX
Will Probably Not Touch Personal Earn
ings nt All.
Washington, Dec. 2 .Congress meets
next Monday and the president s mes
sage will undoubtedly be one of the
most important ever delivered to any
congress. The silver question, the
Hawaiian question, the tariff question
and the income tax question will doubt
less all claim much of the document.
It is now Drettv well understood that
the committee on wavs and means have
prepared an income tax bill in aceord-
ance with the president's views. Chair
man Wilson says tne new tarin Din win
leave the revenues about &,000,000
short, and Secretary Carlisle agrees
with him in this estimate. 1 bis is to
be made np by a tax, not on private
earnings, but by making the levy on
corporations, successions and legacies.
The incoms tax will hi confined to
these limits.
Successions and legacies in this con
ntctions apply only to personalty and
inonevs. The Democrats of the com
mittee have also debided to increase the
tax on cigarettes and to impose a tax
oa playing cards. Both of these points
are definitely decided, the object, on the
on hand, being to tax a "nuisance,"
and on the other to tax an article which
can bear a heavy burden without any
individual feeling the weight of it. The

NOTES.
T BIS SATABIO MAJCSIT.
For the past week the daily papers, espec
ially thorn in ths east, have had tearoely
anything in them bnt foot ball. They told
ot of the 25,000 crowd at Springfield, Mate.,
of th 0.000 gathering at New York Than k-
giving, and of jie 20,000 at Boston on th
am day. They told ot of Wagger gaining
yard through Yale' center, of Sprinter
running aronnd Harvard't tight end, and of
Pother going- between Princeton' tackl
and gnard.
From th immense erowdt at th different
gamea, it stand to reason that fool-ball it
the most popular ont-door game in tne
United States to-day. Base-ball never drew
och erowdt, neither does cricket or lawn
tennis. We can hardly imagine the shont
that goes np from 60,000 throats, aa tome
brilliant play it being made by one of the
team.' Everybody hat to yell, even the
coolest men get worked np to th highest
pitch at one exciting rath succeed soother,
and t one by on the plnyers limp or are
earned from the field.
Foot-ball is a comparatively new game,
rising fast into favor, and it may fall like
Locifer, never to rise again. Even now it
is being condemned a brutal, and by those
who hare never witnessed a game, still the
best lover of th sport cannot call it a
friendly game for points only. It ha only
been within the last ten yeart that the game
has been played in States west of the Alle-
ghaniet, and nine oat of every ten of the
people living in the small cities and towns,
know little if anything abont it. Most any
one can get out and and play a creditable
game of base-bnll, bat when it oomes to
foot-ball a large number have to take a
back seat, for to play it, strength, endur
ance and quickness of thonght sra the
necessary requirements. Don't think thia
llndes to the old game you nsed to play
kind reader, where a round, inflated robber
ball was nsed, and sore shins were the only
results of playing. An attempt will be made
to give a short, rocgh outline of the Rugby
game, and it a farther knowledge is requir
ed, either see a first class game, and that
would be best, or take a checker board at
horn, using the checkers for men, patting
thera in the positions given. If you are
qnick nt seeing into anything, yon will not
be long in finding oat that the sport is as
scientiac and the maneuvers as complicat
ed as anything ever witnessed before.
Every team consists of eleven men with
snbsth ntes in case any of the regular plnyers
honld be disabled. Seven men play in tho
line" and are called "rushers." The men
on the ends of the line are the end rushet,
either right or left according to the end they
are on, the two men next to them are cniled
the riuht and left tackles, the next two, the
right and left guards, and then we have the
center man as center rash. These men are
as a rule all large, strong fellows, especially
the guards and center. Directly back of tho
center is the quarter back, a chort chunky
fellow; back of him and on each side are the
two half-backs, and then further back is the
fall back, this completing oar eie-eti men.
The rash line of seven men on a side,
stand facing each other, the center on one
team directly opposite the other center, the
guards standing in opposition to the oppos
ing guards, and so on. These two lines are
aa close to each other as it is possible to get
them, and have shoulder against shoulder.
One of the centers has the ball, an oblong,
leather covered, football, between his feet.
I'he quarter-back stopps behind the center
with arms outstretched, ready to receive the
ball when it i snapped back to him. He
ivesa signal, the ball is 6Bpped back, the
quarter passeB it to ono of the half-backs
who tucks it in nndsr his arm, aod starts to
get through and past the opposing line. The
signal of the qaarter-back means every
thing. It tells tba rush line jaat what men
to push aside to make a hole for the man
with the ball to get through, so that the ball
can be carried back of the opposing team's
goal. They, the opposing team, try to stop
the runner and throw him down. If one
side fails to advance the ball 5 yards in four
runs, it goes to the other team, and they re
peat the running, trying to push their op
ponents back nntil the ball is behind their
gjal posts. The side getting the greatest
number of goals, wins.
This is, as stated before, only a rough out
line, all the minor details being omitted.
What's the matter with our boys? They
don't teem to be matrimonially inolined.
Last week two of our leading society girls
were married to outsiders, and rumor has it
that two more will aoon leave ns. It ought
to be as natural to keep the girls at home.
at it is to keep wealth in the family.
'Twas midnight, and grow.ng later every
minute. Tha silence and hush of the black
and impenetrable night had settled upon
the great city. But hark! or hist! will do as
well. An officer was heard to emerge from
the back door of a saloon and mutter some
thing between hit false teeth. He then
stepped out into the above style of night,
and was soon lost to view. Hark again, ns
a woman's shriek pierces tha midnight air.
Every indication points to the fact that the
midnight air was pierced twice when she
shroke the second time. The officer, hear
ing those cries, quickly ascertained the
quarter from which they came and ran awift-
ly in the opposite direction. Men were now
coming from every point. They stopped in
front of the house where the shrieks were
seen ootnlna from. ! Stout men put their
fingers to their ears to shut out those heart
n sding cries. One man fainted. Another
pulltd from his pistol pocket a flask of
whtikey and fifty cents in gold. Hastily re
placing the money, ho gave the fainting
man a drink fr:m his flask. Then more
men fainted; the fainting was kept up nntil
th whiskey give out. It was horrible,
Meanwhile those shrieks were piercing the
midnight, which by this time waa full of
large, irregular pierces that one might put
one's leg thrbngh. One man, braver than all
the rest, olimbed upon the topmost pinna
cl of a beer keg and addressed the crowd:

"I can ruarrv any girl I please " was
his exclamation, but unfortunately
then he did uot please any; and there
was a plaiu reason for it. He had con
tracted catarrh of tne worst form, and
although a wealthy, educated, attrac
tive person every other way, He was
positively repulsive to his lady friends,
a number of whom rejected his offers
of marriage. A friend advised hitn to
use Dr. (sage's Catarrh Remedy. He
took his advice, and now is the most
popular beau in town, and he really
can "marry any girl be pleases" to ask.

Thinks of Swamp-Root.
"GREATEST REMEDY OF THE CENTURY."
An Effectual Cure for Kl.ney,
Liver and Bladder
Diseases.

C. T. Brown, A. M., M. D.
"When I discovered that Swamp-Bast
was not a patent medicine, but the
favorite prescription of an old and scientific
physician with which he had treated success
fully thousands of cases, my prejudice were
disarmed and I be-ran
to prescribe Swamp-Root
In my practice invariably with the most surprising-
results, earing many case which I
had considered hopeless. Whenever I find
any one suffering with pain In tb small ol
the back, a too copious flow or retention of
urine indicating; Kidney or Bladder 11
etae, I invariably prescribe Swamp-Hoot, and
it never fails to greatly benctlt the patient,
even in cases of Brleltt' Disease. I have
alto used it in repeated cases of chronic
diarrhoea which
It has never failed to cure
after all other remedies had proved useless.
For all Kidney, Bltdder or Liver diseases I
consider Swamp-Koot a perfect specific, and
the greatest remedy of thia century."
