WASHINGTON.
TUESDAY December 10, 1907
CBOSB7 S. NOTES Editor
Entered ax second-class mail matter at the poit
office at Washington, D. C.
THE STAB has a regular and perma
nent Family Circulation mnch mora
than the combined circulation of the
other Washing-ton dailies. As a Hews
and Advertising Medium it has no
competitor.
d'ln order to avoid delays on acoonnt
of personal absence letters to THE
?TAX should not bo addressed to any
individual connected with the office, but
?imply to THE STAB, or to the Editorial
or Business Department, according' to
tenor or purpose.
Politics From the Start.
It is to be a political session from the
very start. All roads will lead to Rome.
The democrats in both houses make this
manifest. Whether this is one of Mr.
Bryan's suggestions is not so much to the
point as whether it promises a reunited
democracy. There are many important
and difficult questions on the cards, and
nice management will be necessary In
the effort to capitalize them for cam
paign purposes.
The first question is the money ques
tion, and instantly the republican attitude
Is challenged. Did the President err in
his measures for the relief of the country?
Did he put himself into the hands of the
New York bankers and their financial cor
respondents? Was the suggestion of the
Panama bonds and the Treasury certifi
cates his. or Wail street's? And, as mat
ters stand today, are not the relations of
the government toward the great money
gamblers more fatherly and helpful than
at any time since the civil war? And Is
anything in the way of legislation to be
expected at this time not acceptable to, if
not secretly dictated by, what we know
as the New York crowd?
In the development of things along the
lines of these inquiries?if discussion leads
to development ? the south will have
charge of the prosecution, and the east
does not regard the south as a safe guide
in financial matters. Mr. Culberson and
Mr. Williams were free silver advocates
while silver was the paramount issue.
Mr. Tillman is of the same school. Mr.
McLaurin of Mississippi proposes a meas
ure for government issue as against cot
ton?which is populism, pure and very
simple?while Tom Watson of Georgia,
who was educated in the democratic par
ty. wants a new issue of greenbacks.
Will the eastern democracy "stand for"
criticism, or remedies, from these
sources? And if Mr. Bryan is to be elect
ed next year the necessary votes must be
found in the east. Texas, the home of
Mr. Culberson; Mississippi, the home of
Mr. Williams and Mr. McLaurin; South
Carolina, the home of Mr. Tillman, and
Georgia, the home of Mr. Watson, will
vote the democratic ticket without regard
either to candidate or platform. But not
eo New York or New Jersey, or Con
necticut or Indiana. These states must
be carried if the democracy is to win.
The President is consulting all sides,
from Wall street to Tom Watson. He'has
no plan. But he has a veto, and that
must be considered. And the veto power
probably explains his desire to acquaint
himself with all opinions.
Washington Is Doing Its Fart.
In making their plea to Congress to do
something to reclaim Pennsylvania avenue
from its deplorable condition on the south
ern side, and at the same time to provide
sites for the new buildings urgently
needed for public purposes, the citizens of
Washington are in a position to point to
their own enterprise as evidence that
they are doing their part in the effort
to make the capital worthy of the na
tion. They have contributed richly to the
city's development in-the way of artistic
and substantial construction during the
past few years. Indeed in a marked de
gree the business community has under
gone a transformation within the past
decade.
Yesterday the latest addition to the new
banking establishments of the city was
opened. There are now within a stone's
throw of the Treasury four financial in
stitutions housed in a manner befitting a
city of far greater sire than Washington,
architecturally a delight to the eye. of the
most permanent and substantial construc
tion, and harmonizing In their general
scheme of design. Other buildings are in
course of erection in the same neighbor
hood and will add richly to the general
effect.
What the bankers of Washington are
doing in the new financial center of the
capital the merchants stand ready to do
along Pennsylvania avenue, provided they
are assured of the conditions that are to
prevail there hereafter. It is common be
lief that the government intends to util
ize the land south of the avenue for pub
lie building purposes. The taking of a
site within the great triangle for the Post
Office Department, and another for the
Municipal building, followed by the intro
duction of bills for the taking of addi
tional squares for the proposed depart
ments of Justice and State are con
strued as plain evidences of the general
program. All the practical considerations
point to additional encroachments upon
this area by Uncle Sam. This Is all right
as far as it goes, but it should go much
further and much faster.
The Heyburn bill provides the means for
accelerating the process of giving the gov
ernment all the building sites it needs and
at the same time relieving the capital
of an incubus. It should be passed at
this session. '
If a little thing like Sunday closing so
agitates New York, what would that city
do with a well-developed prohibition
wave?
Maxim Gorky has decided to live in
Italy. He can find several musicians
there who will share his views about the
United States.
Bryan and Sound Judgment.
The San Francisco Argonaut, an inde
pendent newspaper, says:
"Our own opinion of Mr. Bryan is one
of mingled admiration and distrust. Most
distinctly we like his cleanliness of cnar
acter. his personal gallantry, his per
sistence of purpose, his courage in pro
claiming his convictions, no matter at
what cost. On the other hand, we can
but regard him as a man lacking that
sound quality of judgment essential to
responsible administration of great af
fairs."
These sentiments are widely held. Many
republicans entertain them, and some of
Mr. Bryan's own supporters are not with
out a suspicion that his judgment Is not
on a par with his fluency and brilliancy.
That quality needs strengthening?needs
development. ?
But what time has Mr. Bryan for devel
opment? He Is continually on the go.
He has no privacy. During his waking
hours he is always on view. When it Is
known that he is aboard a train the coach
In which he is traveling becomes the
mecca for the other passengers. All of
them want to shake his hand. When he
stops at a town to lecture he Is taken In
charge by a committee, a reception follows
at his hotel, and interviewers present
themselves for his opinions about the
latest happenings. When at home his
newspaper and his correspondence ocoupy
him. Ills hours of sleep are his only
hours of seclusion. His other hours be
long to a curious public, which in eleven
years has not wearied of him or of his
deliverances.
In the religious world, and particularly
in the Roman Catholic communion, the
leaders, the pastors, go every year Into
what they call a retreat. They retire for
a week or a fortnight from their pressing
duties, and spend the time in profound
reflection on matters both past and to
come. They thus strengthen themselves
for new labors, and return home refreshed
and the better prepared for the exactions
of their stations.
Mr. Bryan would benefit were he to copy
this custom. He should abandon for a
time his journeylngs and conferrings. get
the noise of admiring crowds out of his
ears, and settle down for a period of rest
and reflection. But a week or a fort
night would be too short. Months would
not be too much. He has been in such
a stir for so long that it would take
him no little time to get his bearings
amid perfect quiet. Once he "found"
himself, however, he would make prog
ress, and. properly supplied with books
and kept reasonably well informed about
the more important of passing events,
would return to the active world a
stronger man than he had ever been be
fore.
Mr. Bryan is too hurried. He has no
time to digest things, but catches them,
and disposes of them, on the fly. His
sparkle keeps up. He hears and talks, a
good deal. "Knowledge comes, but wis
dom lingers." Wisdom shrinks from such
ceaseless hullabaloo.
The Bemoval of Ahearn.
Gov. Hughes of New York has ordered
the removal from office of John F. Ahearn,
president of the borough of Manhattan,
for neglect of duty. This action, which
was expected, in view of the plain evi
dence that the administration of Ahearn
had been grossly incapable, if not corrupt,
has given rise to much gossip. Indicating
a disposition on the part of the sachems
of Tammany Hall to turn a little political
trick of an entirely characteristic sort. It
is proposed that Ahearn accept his pun
ishment without appealing to the courts?
In which enterprise he would be practi
cally certain to fall?and then for the
board of aldermen of Greater New York,
which is controlled by Tammany with the
assistance of Independence League votes,
to elect him as his own successor. It Is
argued that there is nothing in the law
to prevent the move, dismissal from of
fice not barring a man from ever again
holding office.
Such an action would be not merely a
distinct slap at the governor, but It would
show Tammany's utter disregard for pub
lic sentiment. Indeed, public sentiment
does not exist in the world ruled over by
the sachems. They do know, it Is true,
that the time sometimes comes when !t is
dangerous to tread too sharply on the
public's toes. They do know that occa
sionally the people cry for help when the
business of transferring cash from the
pockets of the taxpayers to those of the
heelers is conducted too greedily and brax
enly. But they do not know what pub
lic sentiment means. If they want their
man in office they put him In. by fair
means If possible. In order to preserve the
semblance of order; by other means, if
necessary.
The president of the borough has at his
disposal practically all of the patronage
of the city. The removed official was
thoroughly trusted by Tammany to do his
work properly, to provide a maximum of
places for the faithful. He was trained
to his job. It was unfortunate that while
he was doing his full duty by Tammany
somebody noticed that he was neglecting
the business of the city, leaving streets
unpaved, and otherwise causing Incon
venience and loss to Individual citizens.
From the Tammany standpoint Ahearn
neglected no duty, the governor to the con
trary, notwithstanding. It Is simply an
other case of differing views of the same
question.
Ohio.
Mr. Foraker's proposition for a primary
in Ohio is fair, and should be accepted.
The primary is the thing nowadays. We
settle as many questions as possible by
means of it. If Ohio is for Judge Taft
for President, as asserted by the Taft
boomers, the fact may be ascertained In
that way; if for Mr. Foraker the same
may be said. And why not an early date?
The sooner the contest is over the sooner
the country will know Ohio's choice, and
the sooner the Ohio republicans will be
able to adjust themselves to the decision.
The situation In the state Is anything
but comfortable for the republicans, and
unless properly treated, powerful as they
have been for years, it may get beyond
their control.
Italy's government has refused to sell
Paganini MSS. for 1200,000. Mr. J. P.
Morgan, the prospective purchaser, will
no doubt manage to bear up under the
disappointment. Paganini music requires
more practice than Mr. Morgan could
find time for, anyhow.
One advantage In being defeated for the
presidency is that you can enjoy the ex
citement of running for the office any
number of times. (
Distribution of a government campaign
fund would be a delicate matter. The
political pastry problem Is already suffi
ciently complicated.
The fact that the first person singular
pronoun is the shortest word in the lan
guage affords no promise of brevity In
discourses where it occurs.
A President's message which adds noth
ing to the smart vocabulary of the day Is
regarded as lacking In an important fea
ture.
Just to show that there are no hard
feelings, arrangements might be made to
send Aoki over home as the guest of one
of the battleships.
Pious framers of blue laws never sus
pected that they would ultimately make
their way into practical politics.
The surrender of Dinilulu, the Zulu
king, ought to afford an Inspiration for
the ragtime song writers.
Somehow W. J. Bryan seems to take
very little interest In Tom Watson's views
on the money question.
The Six-Day Hippodrome.
Another six-day round-and-round bicy
cle ride is in progress in New Yorlc, with
enough entries to keep the track fairly
well filled with contestants all the 'i""
There is a pretense of racing occasionally,
but owing to the conditions under which
these exhibitions of endurance are now
conducted practioally no displays of speed
are possible. Yet the public attends in
large numbers, paying good money for
the pleasure of hanging over the rails
and watching the spectacle of hired men
?for they a>e no more?pushing pedals
hour after hour and whirling around a
great saucer until the eyes are dulled
and the brain is wearied.
Is there a sort of hypnotism about the
circular motion that the stupid exhibition
attracts so many spectators? Or la there
present a hope that a "spill" may occur,
with a dozen riders falling In a bunch
and perhaps breaking arms and legs? In
either case the spectator appears as a
sorry creatm-e, less commendable indeed
than the. men who make It their business
to grind out the miles for the sake of &
few hundred dollars.
It was hoped several years ago that
the public patronage of these six-day
races would wane so that they would be
come no longer profitable. On the con
trary, there seem to toe Just as many
foolish people with the price in their
pockets each year to induce the man
agers of the shows to present them. The
same amount of energy and the same
sum' of money expended in some other
direction might produce results worth
while. This Is one of the big wastes.
In order to make Secretary Taft thor
oughly enjoy himself in Russia, it might
have been well to have some of the news
from the United States censored.
Mr. Foraker seems perfectly willing to
have the favorite son question In Ohio
decided by a popular vote.

SHOOTING STABS.
BY PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Being Shocked.
"Does Mrs. Prlmkln approve of the
theater?"
"No," answered Miss Cayenne. "If she
did I don't believe she would enjoy going
there nearly as much as she does."
A Purpose Attained.
"I hope," said the young orator, "that
my speeches make people yearn for bet
ter things."
"They do," answered the relentless
critic. "They make me yearn to be at
home, asleep."
Robert Reed.
"I never smoke," said Robert Reed.
"I thank my lucky stars
i That this is so, since I escape
Those Christmas gift cigars."
Consideration.
"You always applaud that candidate's
speeches."
"Yes," answered Farmer Corntossel.
"Why don't you vote to send him to
Congress, then?"
"Because It would be a shame and a
cruelty to keep him so long In silence as a
[ new member."'
Distinguishing Terms.
"Father," said little Rollo. "what la a
speculator?"
"Any one, my son, who goes Into Wall
street and loses."
"And what Is a financier?"
"Any one who goes into Wall street and
wins."
Agricultural.
Oh, de fruit crop is a failure
Mos* every year or so.
An' dar's never any tellln'
How de corn an' wheat will grow.
But dat kin' o' agriculture
Don' never bother me,
'Cauae I puts my whole dependence
On de gre't big Christmas tree!
De white folks plants 'em somehow,
An' de fruit is mighty fine;
It beats dat watermilyon
Dat's a-growin' on de vine.
I reckon I'd be happy.
Always Ilvln' at my ease.
If I only owned an orchard
Dat was full o' Christmas trees!
The Grant Statue at Washington.
From the New York Sob.
As a matter of fact, the spot chosen by
the functionaries who have or are sup
posed to have authority Is perhaps the
most unsuitable that could have been
found in Washington, barring, of course,
the slums and purlieus. The so-called Bo
tanic Garden lies at the foot of Capitol
Hill. It is very low ground, ground
which for years to come will toe cursed
with squalid and unlovely surroundings,
and which, even when the most ambi
tious schemes of municipal adornment
shall have been completed, will still re
main comparatively remote and inconspic
uous. Almost any part of the immense
park contemplated by the government
will be more attractive and more logical
when all 1? done, and meanwhile (which
Is to say for many years to come) the
monument to Gen. Grant will be tucked
away in one of Washington's most ob
scure and unconsidered corners. Neither
in the ugly present nor in the gorgeous
if problematic future will the proposed
adjustment satisfy the discerning and the
thoughtful.
Scott. Sherman, McPherson, Farragut,
Dupont, Thomas, Loyan and others have
"squares" and "circles" to themselves In
| the most beautiful and luxurious and
highly Improved sections of the city. The
Botanic Garden lies at the bottom of a
hill In what Is now the brother to a
swamp, and can never, under any con
ceivable dispensation be converted to
purely patriotic uses. As the eastern tall
end of the projected boulevard the half
swamp In question may be utilized to
more or less advantage In the general
scheme. As the site of a. monument to
the most colossal military figure In our
national history It seems offensively im
pertinent.
The Boy's Toys.
From the Columbus Son.
Patriotism Is a commendable trait of
character In the youth of our country, but
city officials, city physicians and parents
as well have learned that the toy pistol is
not necessary to celebrate the Fourth of
July. For in the trail of the toy pistol
comes the dreaded tetanus to claim Its
annual list of bright American boys. The
toy pistol has practically been relegated
to oblivion on account of the danger at
tefidlng Its use. It Is to be hoped that
the air gun will soon follow In Its wake,
for the death list due to this seemingly
harmles* toy Increases dally, and in a
manner that Is appalling.
A Good Thing.
Prom the Springfield Republican.
There cannot be too much agitation of
the question of the forests. Its forest re
serve policy is one of the fine things
about the Roosevelt administration.
How to Get in Line.
From the Chicago Tribune.
Mr. Hughes probably realizes as fully
as anybody else does that the best way
to get himself In line for the presidency Is
to be a good governor of New York.
New York's Lid.
From the Philadelphia Inquirer.
At this distance. New York city with a
lid on looks about as queer as it feels.
Which Way?
From the New York Tribune.
Turn, sinners, turn!?The Louisville
Courier-Journal.
Whither, colonel, whither this time? '
A Sure Qualification.
From the Toledo Blade.
The fifteen-year-old Pennsylvania boy
who has killed five bears In ten days may
be President some day.
So Slowf
From the Kansas City Star.
It is suspected th%t the Connecticut man
who has Just returned home from the
civil war must have stopped In Washing
ton to transact business at one of the
departments.
Slaughter of the Innocents.
From the Boston Transcript.
Forty-five thousand Christmas trees
have been shipped from North Adams to
various cities. Every year the gatherers
have to go farther afield?or a-mountaln
for them.

HRISTMAS is not a real Christmas unless there are
children. No Christmas present is so good as a present
which the whole family can enjoy. No single thing furnishes
so much entertainment, amusement and enjoyment to a family,
especially where there are children and young folks, as an
Edison Phonograph.
It supplies
all kinds of amusement
at little expense; it keeps you up to date with every kind of
music by the purchase of new Records, and it gives you a
means of entertaining your friends and neighbors, all of which
combined make the home the most delightful spot on earth.
A small sum invested in an Edison Phonograph will do this.
Have you seen and heard the new model with the big horn? If not, go
to the nearest dealer and see it, hear it, and buy it. If you cannot do that,
