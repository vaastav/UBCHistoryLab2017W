Fugitive Slave Law, , but ike immediate
peril arises from inoessi.it and violent ag
itation of the slavery question throughout
the North, for the last quarter of a'cantu
ry, has produced its malign inflaeut-e on

After referring to ths liicessant ugita
lion nguinst slavery st the North, for the
last twenty-five years, both by il.o press
and the people, and asserting that tho lime
of Congroas is occupied with violent
speeches on this never-ending subject, he
remarks how easy would it be for the
Ameriiun people lo set tie the slavery ques
tion forever and restors poaoe and harmo
ny to (he disiraoied country, which can
be done by letting the Stales alone and
permitting tnora lo . manage (heir own
Statu affairs; ns llioy only are responsible
bt foru God for slavery extending among

more right to interfere than with the sim

does not of itself aDord just oauoo for din
solving ths Cnion. ' '
llo relets to lb fact that the President's
proviuoo is not to make, but to 'execute
the laws. It is slloged as ons csuss for
immediate secession, that the Southern
States ate denied equal right wiili (he oth

what authority are theie denied? ' Not by
Congress, which has never pussed, and, I
believe, nover will pass, any act to oxuludo

lias solemnly decided that Bhive are uro
porty, and, like all oilier property, thoir
owners have a right to take thorn into the

However it msy bs proposed by tho

Practical Operations ol Pliualon How
it would Work.
. Prom the MamphU Bullstlo.1 f"'
We have, time and again, sought to
engsge and fix the attention, of oar fire
eatinsf friends npon the practical opera-
tion bl Disunion. yt ume cuuvoru
(o get them to think of bow it was to be
done, and of the many difficulties-to be
surmounted after it should bo accom
plished. Supposing them to be so exas
perated as to dare the treason of the aot,
we have urged upon them the-after, em
barrnsamenls that must surrounded it,
even if entirely practicable and peacefully
successful through ths imbecility of ths
".TV Air - L - 1 J
existing head ol ihe tederal Government.
The question ot postal arrangements, now
to be carried on without an interregnum
between the withdrawal of I bore of ths
Union and those of the revolted State
the question of the ramified relations of
debUr and creditor between the old and
new Republic, bow adjusted, and by what
tribunal tbe question of revenue and of
defence, how raised and Droviifcd. wheth
er as now, in tbe States, by direct taxa
tion or by imposts these aud a score of
other questions that ought - to be first iu
the mind of the those who ce itemplale
the stupendous revolution; but which seem
to have no lodgment there with the stormy
passions that animate them, are practical
questions, iu their very nature admitting
of no delay, unless the social as well ss
the political structure of socity is to be
involved in "one common ruin." We im
plore our hot brained friends to restrain
their feelings to pause and think. In
revolutions, tho lile and soul of tucoess
is (bought, not passion. A madman may
pull down. Only tbe same and cool mind
ed can build up.
If, under this exhortation, our friends
who sre now so passionately advocating
secession and disunion, and the forma
tion of a separate Southern Republic, can
so far restrain their tompers as to look
practically at ths enterprise thoy propose,
we have another aspect of the matter to
which wo invite attention. It is one ol
the duta Is of the remedial scheme they
have embrsoed, that however forgetful
they may be of it, must be mot at tbe very
door, and is in its very nature, essential
to bo determined at once. It is theques
tion of what kind of Government shall
take ihe place, in "the South," of the Un
ion (hat is to bo discarded. If is to be a
confederation of the revolted States, - with
a Congress of all, after the mode of the
"Old Thirteen," or is il a mere league ol
independent sovereignties? If tho first
named, what guarantees shall be provided
thu the example of "sco -ssioo" will not
be followed iu this new Conlederacy ss in
the old one? Will it not bocome wiso
men who wish peace, stability and secu
rity in their political relations, to guard
against such a probability, by converting
'ilia South" into a coruolidattd Rkbubmo?
Can any other safeguard against perpetu
ally recurring diuiutergralions be provi-
ded.
We think not. There are, indisputably,
within the fifteen Slave States, all the ele
ments of dislikos aud jealousies, having
thoii' origin in different babils, pursuits
and tone of education, that now exists be
tween the North and ihe South, and hence
wo applaud the good sense of Mr. Bars
tow, in his speech it Savannah, io advo
cating the cbliteration of all Slate lines,
and the consolidation of the South into s
bona fide republic. If, with all the induce
ments te adhere to "the more perfect Un
ion' made by the sages wbi framed our
present Constitution, we have found it im
possible to remain under one government
so well adapted, if faithfully administered
to do juslioe to all and benefit all, it would
surely be folly to try ths abortive expert
ments over again, upon precisely the same
plan. "
But there comes the rub, Can ths ad
vocates of "State Rights," and "Stats
Sovereignly" be brought to eurrendor
their oherished dogmas, and oonsent to
an ''obliteration of State lines?" Scarcely,
we think, and hence in the very outset
there is planted divirion and discord of
sentiment, r- sr soeing men like) Mr, Bars
low, will havo no confidence in any form
of governwit less solid; while other revo
lutionists, discontented if their section
does not got all Its demands, will fly off
irom the league, and form new combina
tions. '
' But stiDpoao this otherwise, and the Re.
public of the South established firmly, by
the obliteration ol the existing Btate Linos.
Is it certain that ths peouliar, institution
of the South would be any safer -than it ts
now? or as safe? Madman! stop and
think! With universal suffrage, as now
throughout the now consolidated ' Repub
lic, what guarantee would thrire be that
the Congress elected by itsoitizons would
not make stave proporty bear the burdon
of its support? If there wss so much of
"human nature" in the Legislature of
Mississippi as to double ths lax on that
species of property at us last session, in
order to pay for the srms ordered, would
I hero not be human nature ouougli in
the New Republic to make it, will he still
be, the pack horse of Its expenditures? In
how muoh would the slave owner be ben
efitted by the change of government?
Tho prtoector of such a Republic, torn
from a pre-existing government' avowed
ly for the better protection and safety ol
sluvery property, would, if he were wiso,
abolish universal suffrage, and make the
qualification of voters a direct interest in
slavery. But does any one suppose that
any suoh government could be found, with
the popular assent? ''
We beseeoh our disunion friends to
cease raving about "wrongs" they are
unable to clearly make manifest, and think
what it is they propose to do. We ad
jure them to cease delusive dreaming!
over Utopian schemes, and address their
understandings to tho actual condition of
things. Reason, cot passion, should guide
tl cm through the circumstances by which
they are surrounded. '
