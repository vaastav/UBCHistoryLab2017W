EiXrfmDON, Deo, 12.—rTherels great excite
ment in Paris over the attempt made Satur
day to take M. Ferry's life, and a rumor
that gained currency that plotters also in
tended to assassinate 1L Goblet Whether
others besides the miscreant now under ar
rest and his immediate accomplice were
concerned in the desperate work not
yet been determined. Detectives, however
an now at work on the oase, and there is
promise of sensational disclosures
The attempt to murder M. Ferry was most
deliberate. A man named Aubertine, a
rabid. revolutionist, appeared in the hall
of the Chamber of Deputies and requested
that Ferry be informed that a gentleman
desired to speak to him. The ex-Premier
responded, and at his appearance the
Would-be murderer drew a revolver and
fired three times at him. One of the bullets
struck Ferry in the che3t and another on
the right side near the lowest rib. The
wounds, however, were not serious, as Ml
Ferry was ablo to proceed to a hospital as
sisted by friends.
After the shooting a series of quarrels
also arose between the members of the
Chamber of Deputies, who had fiooked into
the lobbies during the excitement The
disputes were mainly waged between the
Moderates and the Radicals, and were
heightened by the charge made in a loud
voice by M, Rouvier that the Radicals had
by their course provoked weak-minded per
sons to commit deeds of violence. Several
scuffleB
ensued, and in some cases blows
were exchanged, but nobody received seri
ous injury.
Officers of the law saved the would-be
murderer from violence and hurried'him
off to prison. He became talkative and in
formed his guards that he was accompanied
by an ally, who had been selected to shootM.
Goblet, but that the fellow's courage failed
him, and he ran away before the attack was
made upon Ferry. The assassin is about
twenty years of aga Hp says he is a mem
ber of a group of twenty Revolutionists
that he and his comrades drew lots as to
who should commit the first murder, and
that the task of taking Jules Ferry's life
fell to hiin. He is not penitent—in fact, he'
seems to regret that he failed in his mur
derous undertaking.
Ferry passed a feverish night but was
able to rise yesterday morning. The fever
continued during the day, and it was feared
that his wounds would be aggravated' A
bulletin issued last evening said his
condition was satisfactory but a midnight
bulletin says thitit is less favorable: He
received thousands of cards and letters
yesterday, and Senators and Deputies of all
parties have called at his residenoe and
signed the register.
Aubertine, the would-be assassin, was ex
amined by the juge d'instruction yesterday.
He declared that he was an anti-Revolution
ist He said he was sorry that he had not
killed M. Ferry, and expressed the hope that
others be more successful. Aubertine prom
ised to reveal the names of his accomplices—
of whom he says he has nineteen—on Tues
day if the gang does not attempt to assas
sinate some of the members of the Rouvier
Cabinet before that day.
Aubertine is a man of 53 years, short in
stature, with gray hair. He was recognized
by several journalists as having given
them ridiculous pamphlets. A number
of copies of the Ferryists' paper.
La ItepubUque Francaixe,
Aubertine is the author of various pam
phlets and the inventor of several machines,
the failure of which has re.luued him to
deep. poverty, embittered his life and
brought on occasional attacks of iusane ex

that the man is "a crank," as political as

He has traveled through Germnhy. England

The shooting may be reasonably consid
ered a natural result of the extreme bitter
ness of factional strife that has prevailed
during the time that President Carnot has
endeavored to construct a Government
The selection of M. Fallieres no form a Min
istry and his retention of many of the
members of the Rouvier Cnbinet have
blasted the hopes of the subordinate wire
pullers and driven them to despair: These
men had pinned their faith upon the ap
pointment of M. Clemenceau, either as
Premier or having an important in
fluence over the new Government,
but Republican unity exploded when
the Cabinet making began. The Radicals
only wanted two out of the ten portfolios
and even these had been denied them. M.
Clemenceau combined the Republicans to
elect M. Carnot, but the moment Carnot
was Installed in the Ely
see the influence of
Ferry became all potent in Paris and the
Radicals were thrust aside.
The Moderates Insist that Henri Rochefort
aud his apostles are responsible for the deed
of the fanatic who assailed Ferry, and that
while revolutionary sentiments are dissem
inated the life of every Conservative states
man Fallieres, Goblet, Floquet, Rouvier
and others, and even President Sadi-Carnot
—is imperiled. It is probable the Govern
ment will cause Rochefort to be prosecuted.

and Informed President Carnot that he had
found it impossible to form a Cabinet on
the basis of a concentration of the Repub
lican groups, and had therefore abandoned
the attempt M. Lockroy and several other
statesmen to whom U. Fallieres made over

The President then charged Senator Tirsrd

On the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of
revenues over public expenditures, after com-1
plying with the annual requirement of the'
Sinking-fund act, was $17,850,735.34: during the
fear ended June 80,1866, such excess amounted
to $40,405,545.30, and during the year ended
June SO, 1887, it reached the sum of ft
The annual contributions to the sinking fund
luring the three years above specified, amount
tag in the aggregate to (133,058.830.94, and de
ducted from the surplus as stated, were made
by calling in for that purpose outstanding 3 per
cent, bonds of the Government. During the six
months prior to June 80,1887, the surplus rev
snue had grown so large by repeated accumu
lations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this
treat sum of money needed by the people, would
io affect the business
of the country,
that tnesum
Df 179,804,100 of |such surplus was applied to the
payment of the principal and interest of the
per cent, bonds still outstanding, and which
were then payable at the option of the Govern
ment. The precarious condition of financial
affairs among the people still needing relief,
immediately after the 80th day of June, 1887,
the remainder of the 3 per cent, bonds then
outstanding, amounting, with principal and in-'
terest, to the sum of #18,877,500, were called in
and applied to the sinking-fund contribution
for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operations of the Treasury Depart
ment, representations of distress in
business circles not only oontinued
but increased, and absolute peril seemed at
band.' In these circumstances the contribution
to the sinking fund for the current fiscal yeal
was at once completed by the expenditure of
187,684,283.55 in the purchase of Government:
f?t
.tter. In addition to this the Interest accruing ?»?f
during the current year upon the outstanding
bonded indebtedness of the Government was to
some extent anticipated, and banks selected as. -KyjyiMi
depositories of publio money were permitted t»
somewhat increase their deposits.
While the expedients thus employed to re
lease to the people the money lying idle in the
treasury served t* avert immediate danger, our
surplus revenues have oontinued to accumulate, '.v.MgJ
the excess for the present year amounting on
the first day of December to 155,8 ^,701.19, and
estimated to reach the sum of 1113,000,000 on
the 89th of June next, at which date it is ex
pected that this sum, added to prior accumula
tions will, swell the surplus in the Treasury to
(140.030,000.
There seems to be no assurance that with si
such a withdrawal from use of the people's
circulating medium our business may not in v
the near future be subjected to the same
distress which was quite lately produced
from the same cause. And while the func
lions of our National Treasury' should be
few and simple, and while its best con?'
dition would be reached, I beUeve»
by its entire disconnection with prl
vate business interests, yet when, by a perver- •Sipjr
sionof its purposes, it idly holds money Use
lessly subtracted from the channels of trade,' :r
there seems to be reason for the claim that
some legitimate means should be devised by
the Government to restore in an emergency
without waste or extravagance, such money tu v?
its place among the people.
If siAh an emergency arises there now exists
no clear and undoubted executive power of re
lief. Heretofore the redemption of 8 per cent
bonds, which.were payable at the option of the
Government, has afforded a means for the dls
bursement of the excess of our revenues but
these bonds have all been retired, and there are
no bonds outstanding the payment of which we t:
have the right to insist upon. The oontribu
tion to the sinking fund which furnishes the oo- .v
casion for expenditure in the purehaseof bonds
has been already made for the current year, so
there is no outlet in that direction.
In the present state of legislation the only
pretense of anv existing executive power to re
store at this time any part of our surplus rev-.
enues to the people by its expenditure, consists
in the supposition that the Secretary of the
Treasury may enter the market and purchase -\k
the bonds of the Government not yet due, at a
rate of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such
power could be derived is found in an appropri
ation bill passed a number of years ago and it
is subject to the suspicion that it was intended
as temporary and limited in its application, in
stead of conferring a continuing discretion and
authority. No condition ought to exist which
would justify the grant of power to a single I
official, upon his judgment of its necessity, to $11%
withhold from or release to the business
of the people, in an unusual manner, money
held in the Treasury, and thus affect, at his
will, the financial situation of the country and
if it is deemed wise to lodge In the Secretary oi
the Treasury the authority in the present junct
ure to purchase bonds, it should be plainly
vested, and provided, as far as possible, win
such checks and limitations as will define this
official's right and discretion and at the same
time relieve him from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring to circulation
the surplus money accumulating in the Treas
ury, it should be borne In mind that premiums
must of course be paid upon such purchase,
that there may be a large part of these bonds
held as investments which can not fee pur
chased at any price, and that complications
among holders who are willlng to sell may un
reasonably enhance the cost of such boAds to
the Government
It has been suggested that the present boad- ti
ed debt might be refunded at a less rate of in
terest, and the difference between the old and •2
new securities paid in cash, thus flndibg ttM
for the surplus in the Trearaiy. The saoeesr)
of this plan, It Is apparent, must depend vpoaqri
the volition of the holders of the present bonds,- -3
audit is not entirely certain that the Induce
ment which must be offered them would
suit In more financial benefit to the Govern
ment than the purchase of bonds, while tbe
ter "reposition would reduce the principal of
debt Dv actual payment, Instead of extending it ~.
