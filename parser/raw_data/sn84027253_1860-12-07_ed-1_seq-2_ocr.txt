FRIDAY,:::::::: DKC. 7, 1860.
pt We hoped to give the President's
Message in this week's paper, and waited till
the latest possible moment, but it did not
come to liand. We will probably be able to
publish it in to-morrow's DAILY.
Boo-IIoos! —Who Responsible
The "panic" of to-day is mainly attributa
ble to the mischief-making of sundry political
doughfaces, who have their abiding place
north of Mason and Dixon's line, but who
r-jally belong at the extreme south thereof.
Not knowing, or forgetting, that they are
duspised by the independence and manliness
of the South, for their base subserviency and
low cringing to the potent voice of command,
as it echoes from the snip of the driver's
whip,'" they "catch up the song" of secession
and Northern aggression, and "roll it along,''
over hill-top and valley, as though it were a
truth.
Last Winter, sundry of the above class
gathered together in our city, and boo-hooed
and slobbered over Helper's Crisis." To
day, they are boo-hooing about Northeri.
aggression Personal Liberty Bills" and
when they have proceeded thus far adown
tho catalogue, they pause for breath to hatch
up other agressions. They talk loud, boo
hoo, and wipe their eyes, and, when they
have done, Northern aggressions are summe i
up and stated in those "Liberty Bills ol youv
Abolitionists." ^STow, gentlemen Boo Uoo«,
you have boldly stated— a. the street-corner,
in the beer-shop, and in the counting-room
that Massachusetts, Connecticut and low*
have upon their statute-books a law whicu
prevents a slave-owner from enforcing tl
provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law in the
rendition of his property. You know this to
be untrue, or else you know nothing about it.
The Revised Statutes of Iowa, chapter 165,
section 4212, contains the sum and substan
of the Massachusetts Personal Liberty Bill
and reads thus:
"If any person, wilfully and without lawful
authority, forcibly or secretly confine or i»n
•prison any other person, against his will or
forcibly carry or send such person out of the
State or forcibly seize and confine, or inveigh
or kidnap, any other person, with the inten
either to cause such person to be secretly
confined or imprisoned in this State, against
his will, or to cause such person to be sent
out of the State against his will, he shall be
punished by imprisonment in the Penitentiary
not more than five years, or by tine noi
exceeding one thousand dollars, or by both
fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of
the court"
Now, stand up, any of you who dare, and
say that the above law is aggressive upon th
South—that it nullifies the Fugitive Slav
Law. Has it come to this: that we of th
North shall not be allowed to protect our ow
citizens in the enjoyment of their liberty, lest
peradventure, South Carolina shall involve
the nation in civil war Down with the pre
sumptuous idea 1 These laws were pass
cover such cases as the following: Th
Fugitive Slave Law provides that a slave
escaping from Missouri to Iowa shall be given
up, on claim and satisfactory proof that such
slave owes service or labor to said claimant in
Missouri. The affidavit of the claimant and
testimony of one or two confederates is suffic
ient proof, to most of our Commissioners
Suppose, now, that three desperate characters
in Missouri, finding their purses empty, and
no immediate prospect of filling them, con
c'ude to find a good "nigger" or two in Iowa,
which, at the auction-block in St. Louis, will
repl.nish those lean purses. They land at
Muscatine, and, going before our friond, Gen
Humphreys, make oath that, in 1845, or
thereabouts, Ben. Matthews and Geo. Manley
were their slaves, ran away, &c., and demand
their rendition. The General, ac.ing upon
the evidence and law, orders their return.
Who is there that doubts the binding validity
of that order? Suppose, instead of going
before the Commissioner, they hurriedly force
Matthews and Manly on board a steamer,
ass .-rting their right to their property, without
hearing that right established by a judicial
tribunal. Who says that such were lawfully
carried away Such would be a clear case
of kidnapping, and ought to be severely
punished.
On the Statute Book of no State is there a
sentence which prevents the lawful return of
a slave to bondage. There are laws, however,
as we have seen, lor the wilful and unlawful
imprisonment and carrying away of any per
son. Such protect the rights of a negro no
more than of a white man. Boo-Hoos, if you
are so servile, so cowardly, so timid, as to
surrender the rights secured you by the blood
of the Revolution, and place yourselves in the
hands of the freebooter and kidnapper,
whether from the North or South, own up at
once, and take your position at the side of
Southern nullifiers but, above all, do not be
found adding fuel to the angry fires of discord
and disunion, by misrepresenting and falsely
interpreting your own statutes.
Who is responsible? is a question every
Northern Democrat should ponder vvelL
PEESOXAI. LIBERTY LAWS. —The Provi
dence Journal calls attention to the fact that
the Personal Liberty w in that State now
in force, was passed in 1848, seven years
before the Republican Party was organ zed!
It says "It passed the Senate without
a call. In the House the ayes and noes
were ordered. There were lifleen Demo
crats. How did they record their votes
against this outrage of 'Northern fanati
cism With what solid strength did th y
vindicate the rights of the South and repu
diate this 'incendiary legislation.' Thirteen
of them voted for the bill, and only two
against »(. Had these thirteen voted
against it the bill would have been lost.—
The vote stood—ayes, 26 Whiga, 13 Demo
coats nays 14 Whigs, 2 Democrats More
than ont-third of the Whigs voted against it,
and less th n a seventh of the Democrats."
'I he Boston Journal also says the first
law of this kind in Massachusetts was passed
under the administration of Marcus Morton,
a Democrat, and the second one by a Know
Nothing Legislature, the ruling spirits of
which are now Bell-everett men 1 How do
Democrats like the record.

Correspondence.
[The follow ng letter from Judge Hastings
of California, to his brother, Dr. Hastings, in
this city, will no doubt be interesting to the
public generally. The writer was a resident
of Muscatine Iroin 1887 to 1849, during which
liine he held several offices of honor and trust
in the Territory:]
Tbe
election in Virginia has resulted curiously.
Nine Bell and six Breckinridge electors are
chosen, the difference having resulted from
tbe imperfect spelling of names in precincts
where there was not a sufficient number of
printed tickets. The highest Bell vote is
74,3^4 highest Breckinridge 74,180, lowest
Bell 72,186, lowest Breckinridge 70,980,
showing a yariation of some two or three
thousand votes. We don't think anything
like this has eve? before oowundia
any State.
NEW YORK, Nov. SO, 1860.
DEAB BKO UCII:— I hare, as you have
earned, been to Europe—been to Naples,
Rome, Leghorn, Genoa, Turin, Marseilles,
aris, London, Liverpool, &c., &c. have
pent many days in the Catacombs of the
ancient dead, and have been living, as it were,
in the houses
and temples of the people before
and since the Christian era. The ruins of the
early ages have made a deep impression upon
iuy mind, and changed my views somewhat
of this world. I cannot attempt to give you
description of what I saw, nor of the solemn
impressions upon my mind when, for instance,
in Rome, I stood at the block to which St.
Paul was ch lined in the Mamertinc Prison,
now underground, and walls perfect, and the
room in a good state of preservation and,
when I descended into the Catacombs of San
Sebastian, near Rome, where 144,000 of
Christian martyrs were interred underground
n the walls of the caverns, which caverns
un underground many miles. The whole ol
loine is a physical history of the Apostles
ind early Christians. After having spent
uany days in making my investigations, 1
isited the Vatican also, St. Peters', the
wonder of the world, which cost more than
$51,000,000. Here is the tomb of St. Peter
etore the grand altar. And, finally, I had
day for an audience with His Holiness, the
Pope and never shall the impression of his
benign countenance be ertsed from my mind,
when His Holiness took me by the hand and
nterrogated me for about a quarter of an
hour about my family, and the Catholics of
California and of Mexico, expressing how
tuuch he loved his children of California and
the United States.
Tell Foster that I believe the Union of these
States is dissolved, and that nothing can save
it but the immediate repeal of the hostile law:
enacted by Iowa and other States, in violation
of the Constitution. If South Carolina goes
out of the Union, we shall form the great
Pacific Republic,
and gradually absorb Mexico.
Yours, &c., S. C. HASTINGS.
[We have also been permitted to make the
following extract from a private letter to Suel
Foster, Esq., from his brother in Chicago:]
BBOTHBB SI-EL As to political squalls ana
troubles, secession would be a dangerou:
precedent. If South Carolina & Co. go
peaceably out, next the Pacific States and
Utnh will lollow and then will not South
rolina & Co. be quite as troublesome as
^dependent neighbors as they would be as
in integral part of the Union For some
years, I have thought that, owing to the cor
ruption of the Government aid its officials,
the days of our Republic were numbered
Reform or perish should be the motto ot
the Government. There is now some reason
able hope and expectation of reform. What
the result will be is beyond my ken but 1
suppose there will be some concessions made,
and the South will stay a plague-spot, whether
in or out of the Union. In the meantime, I
im in favor of enforcing all laws—Fugitive
Slave Law and al!. Of what use is it to lib
erate slaves, and have them spread broadcast
over our Northern lands—a set of lazy, pilfer
ing vagabonds? Better remain where they
are we have too many of them here now for
our good or theirs either.
Yours truly, JOHN H. FOBTBB.
To the Patron* or (lie "Iowa
Wreiily Messenger."
Tho publisher of the hw Weekly Messen
ger, the or?an of the Union party in Iowa,
is compelled to announce that it hag ceased
to exist. Its temporary suspension has
become permanent. Reason, "pecuniary
embarrassment," caused by coo great a num
ber of delinquent subscribers, together with
a huge pile of "promises to pay" which were
never heeded. The paper was published to
the extent of the publishers purse and
"cheek," with the hope that delinquents
would become ashamed and pay their in
debtedness but too few felt sorry to the
amount of their subscription. The publi
cation of the Messenger was not stopped for
want of sufficient patronage but for the want
of what wan due us to carry it on and make
it a "first class paper,' as the publisher
wished to have it. When it waa started it
was intended as a permanent institution,
»ut the proprieter having failed to get what
was justly :ne him from other sources, out
side of the paper, and having received not
quite one third of his subscriptions in
advance, he kept it up until he had involved
himself nearly three hundred dollars, and,
thinking that self-preservation was the first
law of nature, therefore, stopped at the end
of the campaign.

bers who are in arrears must bear in niind
that tbey «re held responsible for the
amount, and are requested to fettle for the

make up our heavy losses. To those ol our
friends who have come forward and paid
their subscription in advance and loaned
their influence to tho Messenger, and made
exertions to bavs it sustained -ihjtf trying
to prevent our being "thrown upon the cold
charities of Ibt) world''—we return our sin
oere thanks.
We have heard it intimated that the Mes
senger was got up fir a swindle. This, we
wish distinctly understood, is not the case,
as it was not our intention to swindle any
one, but to get up a paper that would be a
oredit to tbe city, and thereby give every
man the worth of his money. We leave it
for others to say whether tbe Meszcngtr was
not wbat it purported to be while it WR,
published We would again earnestly
reqaest that those who have paid for their
paper would .cail OD ua and get their money
or its equivalent, and not go around saying
that they were swindled. Notwithstanding
we have sunk considerable monev in this f°rt
enterprise, we hope to have enough left to
mako all square. Reepeotfully yours,
Sensible Speech by a Southern
nau.
Hoo. Alex. H. Stephens, one of the ablest
Democrats of the South, made a speech in the
Hall of the House of Representatives of
Georgia, on the 14th ult., in which he dis
cussed the question of proposed secession
with great eloquence and elfect. it was
delivered at the request of tho members ol
the Legislature. He took strong grounds
agaiust the threatened withdrawal of Georgia
noiu Itie (Jonlederacy, and ur^ed the Legis
lature to take uo step looking to that event,
without at least going back to the people and
learning unmistakably their will. Mr. Toombs
vas present, and frequently interrupted the
peaker, but the latter always had a ready
aiiswer, and in tne best temper. The follow
ing is what he says of .ur. Lincoln's flection:
J'he first question that presents itself is,
shall the people ol tue Soutli secede from the
Union in consequence of Hie election ut Air.
Lincoln to the Presidency ol the United
otates My country men, 1 tell you rank It/,
candialy and earnestly, thai 1 do ujL think
tfiut ttley ought. In my judgment, the elec
tion ol no man, constitutionally cnosen to liiul
aigU office, is suiiicieot cuusc lor any State to
separate lrom tne Union. It ou^ut to stand
by and aid smll in maintaining the Constitution
ol the country. To make a point
ol resistance
to the Government, to withdraw iroin it
because a man has been constitutionally
elected, puts us in the wrong. VV e are pledged
to maintain the Constitution. Many ol us
nave sworn to support it. Can we, therefore,
lor the mere election of a man to the Presi
dency, and that, loo, iu accorda .ce with the
prescribed forms ol the Constitution, make a
ttoiol ot resistance to the Uovci nuieiii, witnoui
oecoming the breakers of that sacred lnstru
meut ourselves, withdraw ourselves lrom it?
VV ould we not he in the wrong VV hatever
late is to belall this country, let it never be
laid to tne cuarge ot the people ot the South,
and especially to the people of Georgia, that
we were untrue to out national engagements.
Let the fault and the wrong rest upon others,
if all our hopes are to be blasted, it the Re
public is to go dowr, let us be lound to the
list mouieut standing on the decK, with the
Constitution oi the United States waving over
our heads. [Appliuse.J Let the fanatics o'
the North breaK. the Constitution, if such is
tneir fell purpose. Let tue responsibility be
upon them. 1 shall speak presently more of
uieir acts but let not the south, let us not,
oe the ones to commit the aggression. We
tvent into the election with tins people. The
result was different lrom what we wished but
the election has been constitutionally held.
W ere we to make a point ot resistance to the
lovernineut, and go out of the Uni^n on that
•ccount, the record would be made up here
after against us.
But it is said Mr. Lincoln's policy and
principles are against tne Constitution, and
that, if he carries them out, it will be de
structive of our rights. Let us not anticipate
a threatened evil. If he violates the Consti
tution, then will come our liiuu to act. Do
not lei, us break it because, forsooth, he may.
tf he does, that is the time for us to s'rike.
[Applause.] 1 think it would be injudicious
uid unwise to do this sooner. 1 uo u.t an
ticipate that Mr. Lincoln will do anything to
jeo( ard our safety or security, whatever may
oe his spirit to do it for he is bound by the
constitutional checks which are thrown around
niin, which a', this time renders him powerless
to do any great mischief. This shows the
wisdom of our system. The President of the
United States is no rimperor, no Dictator—he
is clothed with no absolute power, lie can
do nothing, unless he is backed by the power
of the Senate—he cannot lorm a Cabinet
without the same consent. He will be in the
condition of George III. (the embodiment of
Toryism), who had to nsk the \Vhigs to
appoint his Ministers, and was compelled to
receive a Cabinet utterly opposed to his views
and so Mr. Lincoln will be compelled to ask
of the Senate to choose for hun a Cabinet, if
the Democracy of that body choose tr put
him on such terms. He will be compelled to
do this or let the Government stop, if the
National Democratic men—for that is their
name at the North—the conservative men in
the Senate—shoul sodetermine. Then, how
can Mr. Lincoln obtain a Cabinet which
would aid him, or allow him to violate the
Constitution
"Why, then, I say, should we disrupt the
ties of this Union, when his hands are tied—
when he can do nothing against us V I have
heard it mooted that no man in the State of
Georgia, who is true to her interests, cou'd
hold office under Mr. Lincoln. But, I ask.
who appoint the office Not the President

can be appointed without the cnsent of the
Senate. Should any man then refuse io.iol
The subscription list has been placed in

likely to—so that is a mere pretence. But
if that furnished aground of secession, then
secession ought to have occurred four or
five years ago, when the laws were passed.
Lincoln bad nothing to do with that 'un
friendly legislation,nor has his election
any connection with it.
tfgf.Letters from members of Gongress
and otbors, in South Carolina, written before
the Presidential election, are exhibited,
proving that the revolutionary scheme of
seooession was concocted long ago, and that

ivent of tfr. Lincoln's success. The whole
Conspiracy will be exploded before long.

RICHMOND, Dec. 4.
Special dispatch to the 'limes:
The President's Message was received here,
this evening, and created a gr.-at sensation, on
account of the President's views and intentions
regarding secession. It goes very much
against the inclinations of the disunionists,
who aver that they ought to be allowed to
secede peaceably, if they can. Some are of
the opinion that the President's instructions
to the commander of Fort Moultrie will cause
a great deal of trouble, and serious apprehen
sions are entertained with regard to it. But
this is altogether an idle conjecture. Public
opinion is not yet made up in regard to the
matter. Conservative persons consider the
President's Message a cunning production

The President reviews the history of the

necessary to accomplish the object of peace is
for the slaveholding States to be let alone to
manage their owli domestic institutions in
their own way. The mere election of any
one to oliice is not just cause for a dissolution
of the Union. The antecedents of the Pres

PTKILI'US VoYAOE OF A LAKF. STEAMER.—
The steamer City -f Cleveland, which ar
riv3d at Cleveland from Detroit on Satur
day evening, had a most disastrous trip.
She left Detroit on Tuesday evening, and
was consequently exposed to the fearful
storm of Friday night. It was for a lor
time doubtful whether the vessel would ev
er reach a port, llercargoot coppei, valued
at ^25,000, was thrown overhoard as the only
means of saving her. The lake was lashed
jnto a fury, such a.s is seldom seen on Lake
Frie. proverbial for its heavy storms.—
Wherever the spray struck, it froze and tho
blinding snow was driven before the wind
like shot. If such was the night on tho
beach, imagine what it must have been out
i' the open lake upon a laden steamer.
The sea w .shed over the steamer continual
ly, and froze as it fell. The decks were
one mass of ice, and the wood work was
broken up at every wave.
I must relate a liltle incident, says
a correspondent, which happened last sum

After the passengers had retire 1 to their

could not be satisti with reference to the door
They kept singing out, from their night
caps the rheumatic "Chambermaid, shut
tho door! I shall die!" Thc aslhmatio:
"Chambermaid, open that door! I shall die!''
So the contention went on for some time,
and the yellow maid with a bandanna hand
kerchief on her head, was fairly flustered.
At lust, an old gentleman, disturbed by tho
altercation, and not wishing to show par
tiality, sang out from his own berth "Cham
bermaid, for Heaven's sake open that door
and kill one of those ladies, and then shut it
and kill t'other."
