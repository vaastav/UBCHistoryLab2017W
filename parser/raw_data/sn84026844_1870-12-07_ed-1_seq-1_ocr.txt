President Grant's Message.
1 nliko thu messages of liis predecessor,
those, of 'President GitAtrr are business '
rather than pqlitical documents. At least I
throe-fourths bf the present one relates in
various topics xiut intiny.wiae alllwl to 1
[Kiiillcs. What Is said by the President 1
asm the policy of the Administration is i
tersely and well said. lie is right on the 1
question of civil service reform and that
of urill m. free trade, though his mode of ^
treating llio iatter would hardly stand the
lire of criticism.
There is nothing startling in the message,
nor any need that there should be.
In llic main, it is n simple nntl practical '
review of tlio concerns ol chief public interest,
not polished nor always smooth in ^
style, but with a certain homely directness,
shrewdness anil honesty calculated to
win the respect and confidence of the pcopie.
This is how tlio message strikes ns as
a whole. Yet there aro portions of It that 1
we deem weak nnn misuiKuii. omiu iuu
President's statement of our differences '
iviili England atom Canadian affairs j
seem just, tliero are bints ol u. policy
looking to the forcible absorption of Canada,
an J tcrritoHal aggrandizement gencrnlly,
which we trast will find very little
sympathy with the people. Tbomostag- I
uressivo pert of tbs Message is that treat- I
ingof Canadian relations, 'i'he President I
treats the Aljibama claims with curt i
brevity, and makes a llank movement on i
England in the direction ol. Canada. His |
views upon this |>oint are similar to those
recently put forth by Buti.br, thorigh, of
course, stopping far short of Bbtleu's
warlike avowals. Whether the President '
repeats l!uti.i:it'a ideas, or whether Buti.kii
took his cue from thq President, is a '
question suggested by this portion of the '
Message. Wo trust the universal
eondemnatiotr of Brrt.Kit'? avowed
wish In use tbo JFishery"'difficulties
to provoke a war with Great Britain will
restrain both President mul Congress from
rash measures, which will, bo (omul quite
needless. Wc judge this part of the Mes- (
sage will create a sharp iifttercst in England
to see what Congress will do in
seconding its recommendations. Mexico, i
too, will probably be stirred somewhat
over the allusions to her unlriendly course ;
in the mutter.,of encouraging smugglers
'
We are among those who see with regret
that the President is determined to !
push through Congress, if he con, the ,
scheme (or the acquisition of Dominica, i
and wliolbMiuvfe tho President Is deceived j
and wrong in refereuce to that project.
We have expressed our opinion so often i
of tlds policy in general, and are so well i
satisfied of the rottcness of this scheme 1
in particular, that we do not care to repeat
them at any length here. The lol- ,
lowing comments Irom the Cincinnati i
(hiulleate severe, but just:
"The President urges the annexation of '
San Domingo with a list of benelits to .
eoiue Irom it, and of calamities without
it, which makes out that it is vital to our
national existence. He says'by it we
shall command tho sea, all the other is- .
lands, South America, and our own coast;
while without it we command nothing (
and arc commanded by everything; that {
it will pay the national debt without tax- .
ing the people, will cut off 100 millions of
imports anu restore our shipping and the
balance or trade, while without it lie can
not sec how we cau pay the debt; that it
will abolish slavery in Cuba, Porto lilco
mid Brazil, will settle the war In Cuba,
will carry out the Monroe doctrine, and (
thus give that good man rest in his sepul- ,
cher; will sup|Kirt ten millions in luxury,
will give us chcup necessaries, and lorce
*11 the other countries to buy our pro- ,
duels, and will give this country a rapid
stride toward greatness."
He Team that national existence will be
insupportable without San Domingo, and
that If wo do not take this prize some
other power will; therefore be advises
annexation on the joint resolution method
which General Butler proposed when it
appeared that the treaty could not command
two-thirds ot the Senate. This
mode liu another unpleasant odor from
theuse made of it in tho annexation of
Texas, to bring on a war with Mexico,
which wua not at all necessary to the annexation
! .'
Wo respect tho President's anxiety for
this annexation; lor lie believes that all
these benellts would How from it. Hut
Jio is deceived by adventurers who are as
unscrupulously pursuing their own private
speculations iu this purchase us Gould
and Fisk were when they |ierstiaded him
that the wellare of the country required
that tho Treasure gules ot gold should be
limited so us to let gold go up and good
prices prevail.
The greater commands the less. Our
continent commands the adjacont isles.
Not one of them could he held against us
nave by a superior navy; and a superior
navy would lake it if we had it. Thticxporis
are less than two millions, the people
indolent and turbulent, the climate unhealthy
to whites; it will support a people
In luxury, becauao tliey are content
with indolence and the spontaneous fruits;
but it can never bo made to pay us the (
cost of holding it. It any foreign power
want# to try it, let us bid'them welcome. ,
Our continent of 4(1 millions commands
it. Tho world is not turned so to|?y turvy '
that an adjacent island commands a con- 1
tinent. And to say that our public debt ,
hangs on it, is to giv? a )>oor character tn
our credit.
Tho greater par;t of the message, if uot .
always strong; is rather adroit, and calculated
to strengthen the President with
the people. In this respect, tho urgency
in regard to San Domingo is the chief
blunder ol tho -whole document. It will
only strengthen the determined opposition
to tin.- iacliemfc, and add fuel to the
tlaino of discord excited by it last winter.
The President would Iiutc harmonized
things and strengthened tho
administration far mora by leaving the
oclieme where the Senate loft it last winter.
Bxcept on this point, anil ono or two
others such as "Revenue Reform," on
which Republicans are divided, lliey will
generally receive the President's views
with a unanimity of lavor. lie has
avoided at least one rock by his entire
silcnce on the question of amnesty, that
being another matter on which the party
Is sharply divided. But in doing thU he
detracts somewhat iroin his rcputution<J>r
jiving frank expression to his views .on
all proper questions. Evidently iii JjIs
two years in the White House, tho President
has yielded something of his soldierly
bluntncas to the diplomatic necessities ol
[lie situation.

rilE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Comments of the New York Journals.
New Voiik, December 0.
Ail the Metropolitan journals have
slahorate comments .upon the President's
message aild accompanying State dociftneriLs,
this A. SI. The Tribune thinks the
[iromlnent fe?tares pi the administration
bntl already commanded the popular approbation,
but this message will still
more endear''tho President to the hearts
:>f his countrymen. The writer thinks
Hint "in regard to San Domingo, the President
is clearly right in his position, if not
misinformed as to tho material facts, and
iubmits that Congress will be constrained
by public sentiment to admit San Domin;o
into our Union, unless It can bo made
;o appear that her peoplo are preponderantly
averse to such a union." He thinks
tlio President's patience almost exhaust:d
by tho Cuban outrages, regrets the
lilcnce of the message ill rognrd to the
iVluhama claims, and esteems the PrcsiIcnt's
suggestions and recommendations
with regard to public laud and land
jrants, as wise and timely.
Tho Herald thinks the'President's raesmgo
Is a good Suite piper and a staunch
party platform. Thatas ail exhibit of the
management under bis supervision of the
government, in our Ibrcign and domestic
itfairs, there is much In it that is good
ind encouraging, and as a foreshadowing
if the general policy of his administration
there is nothing In it calculated to disabuse
the general confidence ol tho country.
Tho Zi'nKwsays tho mcssago is the best
inswer to those who insist that the mission
if the Republican party is ended, or imiiign
General Grant's titness for interpreting
tho wishes and promoting the interest
>! the people,nnd that the policy set forth Is
it once positive and practical. Tho writer
thinks it is clear that the Presklenthas no
idea of plunging the nation recklessly into
i war as a means of inanulacturlng party
:apital, yet that there is nevertheless
rather striking suggestivencss in tho brief
;innigraph which is devoted to the
iVInbama claim, nnd tho mildness of-tho
President's rclerence to tliut question reulers
more significant the firmness of his
remarks in regard to the fisheries.
The World sevcroly criticises tho mesinge,
and thinks it is a document which
needs a good deal or winnowing to separate
tho small amount of grain from the
lieap of chuff in which it is buried. The
ivriler Rays that the request of tho Prcsilout
for authority to uppoint a coniiuiadon
to investigate and audit the damages
;>f indlv duals liy thn Alabama deprenalious,
with a view to their payment by
iur own government, Is a proceeding cnlirely
without precedent, and that il his
lulvico is accepted, the precedent will be
set for making tho government responsible
for tho reparation of damages sustained
by our merchantmen of foreign powers
iu> incident to wars. Tho Sun can find
little merit or satisfaction in the message,
and terms it a povcrtyStrlckou document.

L"j their position. The eagerness to catch all
that was advanced with regard to the
Alabama claims was very great When .
that portion of the message was reached,
the tuembers looked earnestly toward the
clerk, while the representatives in the
",ij diplomatic gallery leaned forward with
*[[ their hands to their ears as if anxious not ,
to lose a word. The portion relating to
, the fishery question took everybody bv
surprise. and it was the general remark I
w that Uio authorship therooT was too much
, v; of the Butler style not to bo oosily recognizablo.
'* The general comment to-night on the
message is that it la more of an electioneer[0
ing document than a State paper, and that i
, where it does cot make a plausible state'L
mcnt it succecds in evading Ibsocs mostingeniously.
Tho mass of glittering gonerj,_
uilties contained hi the document, it is j
said, will make It a strong paper with tho
people, and il it is not any more logical
than a stump speech. It will prove equally
as convincing. Thl document is generally
summed up lis' adroit in its state [j
ments, skillful in the, arrangements, and
I ' lorcible, if not logical, in its arguments.
The only portions which Jbuvo given any
general surprise are those relating to the 1
, nsbefy question. It is thought that here
a very 9trong case indeed is made out
against the provinces.
