WINNSBORC, f?. C.
Wednesday, December 12 1900
We have read all of the President's
message, and we must confess to a
disappointment. It contains no definite
policies to be parsned in tbe
many difficult problems now awaiting
eolation. The hope was expressed by
many of tbe President's friends that
he wocld pnrsne hi' own judgment
and not be so moch nnder tbe influence
of sncb men as Hr. Hanca, but these
m?' '?? ?- ? ? - u* fvla
inenus uiutii uo u;ooppuiuttu u iuo
message, for it is non-committal
tbronghoat. Mr. McKiiiley is a good
man, and many of his private jadgments
are sonnd, but even his best
friends have complained that be allows
his own better opinions to be |
subordinate to those, of unwise ad-j
visere. The message does not discnss i
the trusts at length, and the President
coold not witfi good grace oe very
bard oo these combination?, after
Senator Banna, wbo is chairman of
tbe Republican National Committee,
bad declared that there were no tracts.
Tbe closing part of the message is tbe
beat, bat we fear that that part is
mere good rhetoiic that will bear no
. fruit It warns Congress not to wa?te
money in extravagant expenditures.
After such a sweeping Repnblican
victory it is very appropriate that tbe
ship subsidy bill shall have the right
of way. A dispatcb announced mat
"tbe Republican senatorial committee
on order of baiicees decided that the
hip subsidy bill should displace tbe
_ Spooner Philippine bill as unfinished
business." Why, of course. What
did the trusts ..contribute their money
to tbe campaign for? They bought]
the Jvictory, and they are justly entitled
to the first spoils of it. It was a
victory for them; it was a Republican
victory, and unquestionable Repnbli^
can principles should be the very lirst
to give >n; and what is better
established '.r.u that a ship subsidy
bill is an out and oat Republican
measure. The whole history of the
party has been to tax the masses to
help the rich, and bow could this be
HftMon rinna than hv making the masses
pay tribate to tbe great ship owners?
By all means, give the ship sau6idy
bill tbe right of way. It is the prosperity
of the trusts that McKiuiey has
brought, and let them enjoy it. They
hare paid for it; now let the people
pay the trusts.
It seems inherent in United States
troops to loot. The vandalism of
Sherman's army is known right herein
the town of Winnsboro. Hardly a
house escap3d. Tbe contrast between
Lee's army in Pennsylvania and Sber-1
man's in Georgia and Sonth Carolina i
is a matter o? history. No improve- j
ment, it seems, has been made in the
deseendenti of the men who constituted
the Federal army of '60-65. The
evidence of .outrageous looting in the
Philippines is convincing Tb churches
have no'- escaped. But after all, the
soldiers have a bad example set them I
in the Philippines by the Government<
itself, and bv cainin? DroDertv by I
force they are merely pcrgaiog a* individuals
what tbeir Government is
doing in the name ot war. The commercial
spirit that i? at the foundation
of the wjir for imperial, purpo-e-? is
reflected in the larceny of the soldiers.
How cau the Filipinos seeing these
things believe that their countrymen
are slain by the United States troops
for the good of the inhabitants of the
island*. This is called '-benevolent j
assimilation." hut it is not surprising:
that the Filipino* see no benevolence
in it.
?
Sjecretart of War Root, in his re
port, states that as about S6 per cent
of the Cubans are illiterate, universal
suffrage is not advisable. This admission
is especially interesting to the
Southern States coming as it does
from a member of a Republican administration.
If it is unwise that illiterate
Cubans should be allowed to
Tote, was it not unwise for the Republican
party to grant the right of I
suffrage to thousands of ignorant
negroes in the Southern States, and to
insist now that the Southern States
ball not adopt constitutional amendments
restricting tbe suffrage. We
ought to bear no more of tbe North
Carolina amendment and similar constitutional
provision* in other States
after this official report of the Secre-1
tary of War.
"In oar great prosperity we most
guard against the danger it invites of
extravagance in Government expenditures
and appropriations, and the j
chosen representatives of the people j
will, I doobt not, famish an example
ic their legislation of tbat wise econo?y
which in a season of plenty hnsb&nds
for the future."? President's
Message. Mr. McKinley is very innocent.
The idea of economy practiced
by a Republican Congress!
The President repeats his recom^mendation
tbat jurisdiction be given
the Federal courts in certain inter
national cases such as tbe lynching of
Italians at Tallalab. While some very
fttrong reasons can be advanced in
favor of tbe President's recommendation,
still we believe that the States
should be very reluctant in ?.:v turther
surrendering of their right5 10 tbe
- Federal Government. It is dangerous
tendency.

Pensions are still increasing, as appears

this congress will likely exceed
all others in jthe amount of appropriations.
LCZOJf VANDALISM CHARGED.
Accusations that Americans Desecrate
Churches ara Senewed.
From the Chicago Chronicle.
Milwaukee, Wis., November 29 ?
"If theae reports of tt.e desecrition ot
ha Philinninft r.hrirches be trne." said
Father J. J. Keogbt "then I do not
blamo the Philipinos for refusiag to
be pacified. And in a measure I
know them to be trae, because I my:
self have seen brought to Milwaukee
; articles which I know could not have
been sold, since no priest or Bishop
I has authority to permit them to be
sold. It is the worst sort of desecration
and it is the worst feature of our
administration in the Philippines."
The matter-of-fact fashion in which
presents of vestments, ccitly gold-embroidered
robes, altar cioths and sac
rificial vessels have been made to their
friends by soldiers returning from tbe
Philippines has at =last caused definite
expression by tbe priests of the city,
some of whom say that the chnrch
ought to make forma! petition to bave
the epo iation of tbe churches pat to
an end.
COMMCNION VESSELS AEE SOLD.
There was a general belief at first
that the matter bad been exaggerated
in tbe reports, but when soldiers began
to distribnte costly embroideries and
vessels which are never sold from a
cturch many prominent member* of
the Catholic eh arch thoaght it was
beat to interfere, at?d tbey hope that
the nhnrc.h mav do ?o.
"Right tbere," said Father Keogh,
:<is demonstrated the jastice aud the
necessity of that petition to have a
representative Catholic placed upon
the commission. Exigencies snch as
this mast arise, which cannot be dealt
with fairlv by tbo*e who do not,
understand the conditions. Father
Chappelle, the Papal delegate at Manilla,
has a right to {try to interfere if
this matter and its proof come to his
notice. If be does not the Cardinal
or any of the prominent Archbi h >ps
may be petitioned to take some steps.
"Too much cannot be eaii of the
harm which ail this is doin/ and, as I
say, I do not in the leawt bi-rne the
Filipino* for their relu&al jo be paci|
fled. They natarallv think we are an
| irreligious people if we do not respect
tb^ir boasts of worship Mid why
j should they not think so?"
papal delegate in charge.
Archbishop Katzer s>aid this moru!
ing that be very deeply d.p.'ored the
! desecration of the Philippine chhrchej,
which i? being almoit daily brought to
| notice. He said, however, that be|
cause of the presence of the Papal
| delegate in Mauilla he himself should
not at present take Mops of interfer'
ence, hoping that the spoliation would
! be stopped by the Government.
Father Scbinner, secretary to the (
Archbishop, said toat, while he be*
lieved the reports to be somewhat exaggerated,
yet thetakingof any article
whatever from a Uatbonc unnrcn \s
rega'ded as a desecration ai2d-^ftflnot
be too strongly protested against.
The articles wbicb have come into
possession of Milwaukee' people are
varied and beantifol, and have all apparentlv
come from Catholic chnrches
I of some wealth. They consist chit-fly
of silk robes, some of them beanti|
fully wrongbt and stiff with gold emI
broidery, and worked in medallions of
j great beauty. There are also chalices
I und urns, some of whx are for comj
munion service n-?.
UNAWARE OF DESECRATION.
; One h >ii8e in Miuvankee tins an ex
quisile old silver urn, brought from
a Manilla church, and l ow. having in
a window filled witti eartti and <jiowiny
ferns. The vestments are u?uaiiy
kept lockei away and are exhibited
no 7 and then, but some of them are
used as table aDd evc*r. asconcb covets.
One verv fine collection in Milwaukee
was broajjh' by a <*? ;leman who returned
from Manilla &ome tim * a*o,
and who said be believed ris chnrch
relic*" were taken from ? 'hurcb n?
Colo, on a march from ( a '-"cin o
Maiolad.
Tbe worst feature of it all, acordi
in? to the Driesta who have di&cuised
the matter) is the fact that those who
own the article* seem not to know
what an indignity has been placed
npon the chnrcb by the acts which
they frankly call vandalism. Snch
gifts are received from those who
often do not realize their value, and
are received a? any other interes'ins
relics, and no more value placed npon
them than npon the sword* aud bat
tons.which arc brought with them.
Robbed the Grave.
A startling incident of which Mr
John Oliver of Philadelphia, was the
subject, is narrated by him as follows:
"i was in a most are&arui condition.
My skin was almost yellow, eyes
sunken, tongue coated, pain contincally
in back and sides, no appetite?
gradu lly growing weaker day oy day.
Three physicians had giren me np.
Fortunately, r, friend advised trying
'Electric Bitters,' auC <o my great joy
and surprise, the first oottle made a
decided improvement. I continued
their use for three weeks, and am now
a well msn. I know they taved my
life and robbed the grave of another
rietim." No one should fail to trv I
them. Only 50 eents per bottle at
McMatter Co.'s dra? store. 6

to his grandmother, Mrs. S. A. Boyleston,
left on Monday for Baltimore.

following from the Lancaster
Ledger will be of interest to the re!a-'

p'8ce:
Married, *t the residence'of Maj.
B E Milller, in Lancaster, on Tbnrs
day, December 6th, 1900, Mr. Wm. A.
Corkili and Miss Moultrie Bucbmau.
The groom is bookkeeper of the Exchange
Bank at Chester, and the bride
is the amiable, accotnplifhed and fa-cinating
daughter of Mr. John H. Buchanan,
editor of The Chester Reporter.
They are two of Chester's most popular
young people. Their only" obj*ct
in marrying in Lancaster was to give
their Chester friends a big surpriseonly
the father of the bride and the
mother of the groom being apprised
of the object of ihe visit of the young ;
people to Lancaster. Mhs Buchanan
came over Wednesday ostensibly to
pay a visit t? her former schoolmate,
Misa Minnie Miller. The following
day Mr. Corkill, accompanied by Rev.
J. Grier, pastor of the Methodist
Church at Chester, came over. At
3 o'clock p. ro. they were driven in a
carriage to Maj. Miller's residencq.'.and
at fifteen minutes after 3, the minister
spoke tLe impressive words which

Through frioged lids to heaven,
And the pale aster in the brook
Shall see its image given.
The woods shall wear their robes of
praise,
The south winds softly sigh,
And sweet, calm days in golden haze
Melt d'jwn the amber sky.
Not less shall manly deed and word
Rebuke an age of^wroDg,
The graven flowers that wreath the
sword
Make not the blade less strong.
