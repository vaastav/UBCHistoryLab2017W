WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1012.
THOUGHT FOR TO-DAY.
How often have 1 heard the words:
" I wish I were rich nt Christmas
time, for then 1 could do so much
for others." How strange It Is that
wo never seem to learn tho lesson
that It is not the giving of things,
but the giving of self, which counts!
It Is the spirit of Christmas which
we must strive after not the multi
plication of gifts. Margaret Woodward.
HO NOT PUT RED CROSS STAMP
ON THE FACE OF A LETTER
The Red Cross stamps which are
being sold now to help the tuber
culosis patients, can not bo placed
on the face of a letter but are used
on the back and make a suitable
ornament.
CHANGING CHRISTMAS HURDEN
TO REAL CHRISTMAS .lOY.
Christmas giving has reached the
point In very many cases with the
custom of exchange gifts where lit
tle sentiment and no love are in
volved that to many Christmas giv
ing has become not a joy but a bur
den. Here and there a voice has
been lifted against the hypocrisy and
the desecration of the spirit of the
great day. This year comes an or
ganized effort in the formation of
what is termed "The Sensible Christ
mas League" to which many people
throughout this country are pledg
ing themselves. Tho league simply
proposes a pledge, which Its mem
bers in turn make effort to have
others take unto themselves. If it
suits you, pass it along to some
one who may be wavering but who
needs just a little encouragement
to fall into tho line where his ex
perience has told him long ago
should have been to avoid heart
burnings, disappointments, discom
forts and inconveniences on the
greatest day of the year when all
should have been joy and love In his
heart. Here it is:
" I will bo brave enough to give
only where love and sympathy and
helpfulness make giving worth
while. I will not turn Christmas
day into a day of barter and ex
change. I will make thoso whom 1
love and who love me happy, and
bring joy, as far as I am able, to
those who otherwise would have no
joy to the poor, tho lonely, tho 111,
the old, tho friendless and tho
helpless."
An endless chain Is being formed
of people who are willing to sub
scribe to this creed. You can start
a little chain all your own and
spread tho good that is going to
President Taft's message on our
foreign relations which was sub
mitted to Congress Tuesday last Is
worth more than usual Interest In
view of the unsettled conditions of
Europe caused by the war In the
Ralklns. Tho President calls atten
tion to what this government Is do
ing towards tho establishment of
peaco and expresses regret that he
lias been unable to bring about two
arbitration treaties whlh set tho
highest mark of the aspiration of
nations toward the substitution of
that form of settlement when in
ternational disputes are to bo ad
justed. Ho also comments on the
good offices of tho United States In
preventing a war between the South
American republics and tho effect of
our counsil In tho arranging for tho
cessation of hostilities during the
Civil war in China. Another im
portant work he mentioned as being
accomplished during tho year by the
American diplomatic officers In Eu
rope is tho investigation of tho ag
ricultural credit system In Europe.
Tho project to establish credit facili
ties for the farmers Is a concorn of
vital importance to this country both
as a means to afford relief to the
consumers of this country to a more
thorough development of tho agri
cultural resources and as a means of
maintaining tho prosent agricultural
population. "No ovldonco of pros
perity among well-established farm
ers should bind us to tho fact that
lack of capital Is preventing a de
velopment of tho nation's agricul
tural resources and an adequate In
crease of tho land under cultivation;
that tho agricultural production Is
fast falling behind tho Increase in
population, and that, In fact, al
though these well-established fann
ers are maintained in Increasing
prosperity because of tho natural
.increase In population, wo aro not
developing the industry of agriculture."
Democrats Wnnt Tariff Revised
Down Promptly.
Washington, T. C, Dec. 10. 'Pow
erful Influences within the Demo
cratic Party aro operating to Induce
Presldent-to-bo Wilson to call the
extra session of Congress very soon
after tho present Congress dies
March 4, Instead of waiting until
April as he has Indicated.
Tho Ways and Means Committee
will have its bill or bills prepared
before March 4. It Is felt that busi
ness will be less interrupted if the
Democratic task of putting down the
duty rates is quickly finished. Pend
ing tariff legislation is always de
moralizing to commerce and Indus
try. Governor Wilson said In an an
nouncement at Princeton soon after
election that he would call Congress
In extra session not later than April
25, but Representative Underwood,
tho Democratic leader of the House,
and others in Congressional author
ity, are understood to favor an ear
lier date.
The length of the session will
probably not so much depend upon
tariff as upon the other legislation
which may be considered.
While Mr. Underwood favors hear
ings by the Ways and Means Com
mittee he is not disposed to allow
them to long continue. In all prob
ability they will be ended after
three weeks' work. An effort will
be made to hear all persons Inter
ested In certain schedules during the
same day.
William J. Bryan is understood to
favor the prompt passage of the Un
derwood bills as they stand.
Cabinet builders here are speculat
ing on the significance of the press
despatches from Bermuda. Certain
keen observers of the situation aro
still disposed to consider Col. Bry
an a possibility as American Am
bassador at the court of St. James.
GETS VERDICT OF $7,200
Mih. Stiirliiick, Widow of Henry
Staibuck, Given Verdict by
Jury, In Suit Against Erie.
.Air. Stiii-buck Was For
merly of IIoiicsilulo.
The case of Mrs. Ida Starbuck of
Port .lervis, against the Erie Rail
road to recover for tho death of her
husband, Henry Starbuck, who was
killed on the Erie Dec. 4, 1911, was
tried before Justice Tompkins In
Supremo Court at Newburgh, Friday
and resulted in a judgment of $7,
200 for the plaintiff.
Henry Starbuck was 52 years old
at the time of his death. For 25
years ho had worked as a carpenter
and farmer, nine years of that time
for the Erie. Ho resided In Port
Jervls. On tho morning of Dec. 4,
1911, in company with Foreman
Theodore Durant and two or three
Italian laborers, he loft Port Jervls
by train from which he and the oth
ers of tho party alighted at Harri
man at about 8 o'clock, walking
thence southward about a milo and
a quarter to a culvert bridge that
was being repaired. This bridge
was 19 feet in length, and over It
pass four tracks, the two Inermost
tracks being known as tho main lino
and the others being used as sidings.
The weather that day was bitterly
cold, and the men after working for
a time went to a tool car where a
lire was burning, at which they
warmed themselves. This was at
about 11 o'clock. An Erie express
train leaving Jersey City at 9 a.
m., was duo to pass tho culvert
bridge referred to at that hour, and
the supposition Is that Starbuck be
lieved It had passed. Instead, how
ever, it was 35 minutes late. When
tho men returned to tho bridge, Star
buck, under tho direction of Durant,
wont to work on tho castbouiid
track, tho other men working to tho
west. Meanwhle a freight train had
drawn up between them. Tho ex
press train, still considerably behind
time, camo da b"hlng up the line, and
the locomotive struck Starbuck and
killed him.
Tho claim of tho plaintiff was that
tho tralii was then running at the
rato of 55 to GO miles an hour and
that no bell or whlstlo was sounded
to glvo warning of its approach to
Starbuck who was prevented by a
curve in tho track from seeing more
than 300 feet south from tho point
where ho was working. Tho plain
tiff claims that tho company was
negligent in that no warning signal
was given or sounded, and that tho
company failed to notify Starbuck
at tho approach of tho train, the
custom boing (so It Is alleged) for
tho proper porson In such a con
tingency to keop a lookout for tho
safety of tho men whoso attention
is necessarily taken up with tho de
tails of their work.
Tho claim was further mado for
tho plaintiff that Starbuck had a
right to rely on tho express train bo
ing on time or else oa receiving
warning of Its approach whon de
layed. Repairs to tho bridge had
beon In progress for two or threo
weeks, and It was known to en
gineers and others employed In run
ning trains ovor It as an unsafo
plnco for tho men omployed thoro.
Henco tho plaintiff claimed tho en
gineer In chargo of the express
train's locomotlvo should have used
extraordinary precaution thoro, es
pecially whon ho wns behind time.
Tho first witness sworn was Mrs.
Ida A. Starbuck, tho plaintiff In the
action, who testified that her husband
was In good health up to tho time of
his death by accident, and that his
earnings averaged ?C0 to $80 a
month. Tho couple had four chil
dren, all adults, two of thorn arc
married, whllo a son nnd daughter,
unmarried, reside nt homo with tho
mother. Henry Starbuck was de
scribed as a mnn of medium height,
weighing about 170 pounds,
James A. Wiley, a civil engineer,
described tho condition of tho track
and Edwin H. Starbuck and Mr.
Durant, tho foreman, gavo testi
mony. Fred Startup, an employe of Un
dertaker Fred II. Porter of thiB city,
testified to tho general condition of
tho body nnd tho fatal Injury In tho
right side of tho face. His testi
mony was Important for tho rail
road contended that Mr. Starbuck
was negligent In that he stood be
tween the rails absorbed by the
other train that was passing. Were
this true, tho man would have been
struck In the left side Instead of tho
right.
The caso was given to tho Jury at
four o'clock and they reported about
six. The attorneys wore Harry S.
Austin, with whom were associated
Samuel L. Sargent of New York and
Judge Seeger of Newburgh for the
plaintiff; and Watts, Oakes &. Bright
of Middletown for the defense. Tho
trial .was actually being conducted
for the Erie by Messrs. Oakes &
Bright. Port Jervls Gazette.
