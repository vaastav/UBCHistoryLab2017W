AN IMPORTANT DECISION.
The Supreme ConrtKcvcrscs tlie
Decision in the N. P. Tax
Title Case.
Opinions Huiuleil Down in a
Number of Other Stutsman
County Cases.
Stutsman County, as it is Told
About in the Sunday Argus
Write-up.
Supreme Court Decisions.
The state supreme court met at Grand
Forks Friday and handed down a num­
ber of decisions. The most, important
of these was in the Northern Pacific tax
title case from Cass county, in which the
decision of the lower court was reversed
and a decision rendered in favor of tho
county. The principle involved in this
case is the same as that at issue in the
well-known case from this county which
is now in the United States supreme
court and the amount of such certificates
issued by this county is said to be about
$20,000. In view of the importance of
the case the full text of the decision is
given:
Richard L. Tyler, plaintiff and respon­
dent, vs. Cass county, defendant and
appellant.
The defendant county, through its
treasurer, sold certain lands for delin­
quent taxes at the annual tax sale in
October, 1883. Tho land so sold was a
part of tho original grant by the general
government to the Northern Pacific rail­
road company. The lands were surveyed
at the expense of the United States and
earned by said company after the passage
of the act of congress of July 15,1870,
pertaining to survey fees and no part ot
snch survey fees had been repaid to the
United States at the time of such sale.
Prior to this assessment and levy of the
taxes for which said lands were sold tho
railroad company had disposed of the
land and conveyed them to third parties
by deeds and contracts and such third
parties were in possession. Said lands
were regularly assessed and ail tho pro­
ceedings leading up to the tax sale were
regular. Plaintiff bought the lands at
such tax sale and brings this action to
recover the purchase money he paid.
Held, That such lands were not taxa­
ble at the time of such assessment be­
cause the United States held the fee title
to said lands and had a lien thereon for
tho survey fees.
Northern Pacific Railroad company vs.
Rocue, 115 U. S. (500.
But that since land was a subject of
taxation in Dakota territory, prima facie
these lands were taxable. Taxation was
the rule, freedom from taxation the ex­
ception.
2. Held, further, That the assessor
being a judicial officer, where property
is exempt from taxation by class and not
by specific description, he has full juris­
diction, and it is his duty to decide in
each instance, whether or not a particu­
lar piece of property falls within any of
the exempted classes, and in this respect
the source of the law that establishes the
exemption is immaterial.
3. Held, further. That an 'erroneous
decision of an assessor in the matter of
exemptions does not deprive the tax pro­
ceedings of jurisdiction: but until such
erroneous decision is modified or set
aside by the proper tribunal, all officers
with subsequent function may safely net
thereon.
4. Upon a right of recovery at com­
mon law there is nothing in the case to
relieve plaintiff from the rule of cavBat
emptor, as announced by this court in
the case of Budge vs City of Grand
Forks, decided at this term.
5. Under the law in force when such
sale was made, the treasurer, in the mat­
ter of the collection of the taxes tvas
purely a ministerial officer, and when he
received the duplicate tax list with the
warrant of the county commissioners at­
tached, if such process was fair on its
face, and contained nothing that wculd
apprise the treasurer of any defects or
infirmities, and in a case when it does
not appear that the treasurer had liny
knowledge of any defects or infirmities,
such treasurer was fully fprotected f/om
personal liabilities in collecting the taxes
upon all property contained in his Slid
list so long as ho acted strictly within
the statutes. The law furnished hisau
thority for selling property for delin­
quent taxes. The warrant, with the tax
list attached, gave him the subject upon
to exerciso such power and authority.
0. The statute (Compiled Laws, ac­
tion 1,021.) which required the treasirer
to "sell all lands liable for taxes of ijny
description for the preceding year or
years" meant all lands liable for taxes as
shown by the process in his hands. He
could not refuse to sell lands on his 1st,
nor could he sell lands not on his list
7. Section 1,629, Compiled (\vs,
then in force, read as follows, "When by
mistake or wrongful act of the treasurer
land has been sold on which no tax vas
due at the time the county is to save the
purchaser harmless by paying him the
amount of the principal and interest at
the rate of 12 per cent per annum from
the date of sale, and the treasurer and
his sureties shall be liable to the county
to the amount on his bond, or the pur­
chaser may secure the same directly
from the treasurer."
Held, that the sale of lands in this
case was neither the mistake or the
wrongful act of the treasurer within the
meaning of said section.
8. Section 84 of chapter 132, law of
North Dakota for 1890, has no applica­
tion to a sale of lands made before: the
enactment of said chapter. The chart
concluded its opinion as follows:
We find no ground upon which re­
spondent has any right of recover^ in
XVaSu-i?
this case. The district oourt is directed
to reverse its judgment and dismiss the
case. Appellnnt to recover costs in both
courts, lie versed. All concur.
Among the other cases from this coun­
ty in which decisions were rendered were
these:
Gull River Lumber compauy respond­
ent vs. School District No. JW, Barnes
county, appealed from Barnes county.
Action to recover on school warrants is­
sued to build school house and declared
valid by trial court. Judgment reversed
and district court ordered to dismiss the
case.
Capital Bank of St. Paul appellant vs.
School District No. 53. Barnes county,
respondent,appealed from Barnes county.
Action to recover on school warrants is­
sued to build school house aud declared
invalid by trial court. Judgment af­
firmed.
Ove Johnson vs. N. P. 11. It. Co., ap­
pellant, appealed from Stutsman county.
Action for damages by prairie tire. Ke
versed unless plaintiff strike off interest
on value of property destroyed.
Thomas J. Larison, appellant vs
Dwight Li. Wilbur aud Johnson Nickeus,
appealed from Stutsman. Unversed and
remanded with instructions to sustain
demurrer.
The next term ot court will be held at
Fargo, convening Jan. 13th.
STURDY STUTSMAN.
One of the Best all Kouutl Counties
in the State--Prom the Argus Write
up.
The county is forty-eight miles square
and nearly its entire area is tillable, the
valuation of property of all kinds, as as­
sessed for taxation, is 84,150,000 the tax­
able lands are assessed at about $3,700,
000. The indebtedtiess of the county is
§03,5110, all represented by bonds run­
ning for long time and at a low rate of
interest the current expenses are amply
provided for by its ordinary revenues,and
its warrants are at par.
Tho population of the county is about
7,000 it will be perceived therefore that
a large proportion of the lands are still
unoccupied and may be obtained from
the government under the land laws, or
upon easy terms from the railroad com­
pauy the lards yet to be taken are fully
equal to those which have been taken
save that they lie further from markets.
Public warehouses for the reception and
storage of grain are erected at intervals
of a few miles along all the lines of rail­
way, so that produce need not be hauled
by team more than a few miles.
Stutsman county lies both in the
wheat belt and in the stock belt of North
Dakota, its pure water, abundant grasses
and wide ranges of rolling pasture lands
otter special inducements to stock raisers
which are being rapidly taken advantage
of. A year ago there were but a few
hundred head of sheep in the county, to­
day there are more! than ten thousand
the herds of cattle and horses are also in­
creasing but the sheep industry is con­
sidered by our farmers generally to offer
the surest and largest profits, the tlocks
need but little care in the summer, they
can range late in the fall and even during
the winter except on stormy days they
increase raidly and in this rather dry
climate and high altitude are free from
many diseases which have proved de­
structive in other regions. It has been
found that the wool of the sheep, like the
fur of wild animals, grows heavier and
liner in a cold climare than in the more
southern states and that the same sheep
which farther south sheared six and a
half and seven pounds will yield hero
from eight to ten pounds of wool. Stock­
men have not yet found it necessary to
purchase lands for pasturage, their herds
range on he vacant lands but the.v'ob
tun title to a few hundred acres from
which to cut hay when needed and on
which to build barns and corrals.
A CHRISTMAS REiUlM)K(l.
Dr. Archibald's Annual Card to the
Public—Xmas to be Fully Ob­
served at the Asylum.
To the relatives aud kind, thoughtful
friends of our dependent household:
I am constrained bv no selfish motive,
but to assist in adding to the enjoyment
and benefit of a "mind diseased" to issue
a "reminder" that "Xmas" comes again,
aud that little contributions of articles
suited for "Xmas" donations, or money,
will be gladly received, and thus enable
us to make this day a holiday in truth
and in fact, a flowery and p.unny spot to
all compelled to wander in tho darkness
of that "mental shadow life," from
which they poor creatures have no
redress or escape, and truly deserve the
pity, commiseration, find generous con­
sideration of the strong and well. Any­
one complying with the above request,
will please send by registered post or ex­
press in time receive articles, etc., as
early as Dec. 24. Very Respectfully,
O. WELLINGTON ARCHIBALD,

To the Public.
About a month ago, while laboring
under intense excitement from the effects
of drink, I misconstrued the utterences
of a frightened girl and made an assault
upon, and circulated an unwarranted re­
port about one of my best friends, Dr.
Jno. Harcourt. There is no one living
today that appreciates the doctor's skill
and personal worth more than I and it
will be one of the pleasures of my life to
do all in my power to undo the great in­
jury so unfortunately done him. Signed,

It is understood that an attempt was
made to insert another plank favorintr
the proposed sub-treasury scheme, bur,
that, after an animated debate, it was de­

amendment against lotteries.
No preference was expressed for any
particulai candidate for the United
States senate, but a resolution was
passed declaring it to be the purpose of
the alliance to favor the candidacy of no
man who is not known to be in sympathy
with their principles. A committee was
appointed to devise some plan for sup­
plying needy members of the alliance
with seed wheat. The arrangements for
establishing the two alliance organs
were completed and considerable stock
subscribed. The two organs are the
Normanden, Scandinavian, and the
Grand Forks,Independent.
The convention adjourned Wednesday
at midnight.

Co­
lumbian commission his friends here felt
that it was almost the same as giving the
state three members. In view of the
fact that the captain's influence is ex­
pected to be thrown to help secure North
Dakota the consideration to which she is
entitled, the following excerpt from an
interview that appeared in the Pittsburg
Dispatch of Nov. 20th, and which indi­
cates that he is one of the influential
men of that big commission, has an in­
terest for others besides bis many per­
sonal friends:
That Pennsylvania men. products and
manufactures will cut a prominent part in
the future of tho world's fair at Chicago,
seems to le the result of the ob­
servations of Mr. Leonard Wales, who
returned yesterday from a three day's
sojourn in the Windy City.
"The pace that Pennsylvania will
travel has been set by Pittsburg's mem­
ber of the National commission, Captain
William McClellan," said Mr. Wales,
"Captain McClellan made such a bril­
liant fight for General D. H. Hastings as
director-general that he naturally was
awarded the distinction of making Gen­
eral Davis' nomination unanimous. Be­
fore any committees were announced
President Palmer, of the National com­
mission, came to Captain McClellan and
asked him upon what committees he de­
sired to serve, as he had shown himself
to be a very decent man in the Hastings
Davis fight."
"Captain McClellan said that he
wanted to be on jnst such committees as
was the pleasure of the president. There
had been suoh a terrific struggle for fat
places that Senator Palmer was aston­
ished by the Pittsburg man's modesty,
W' t™TTr",
and forthwith placed him on the three
best committees: manufactures, classi­
fication and tariffs and transportation.
The committee on manufactures is of
keen importance to Pittsburg and Penn­
sylvania for the general expectation is
that Pittsburg will make an exhibit
which will justify her universal char­
acterization as the createst manufactur­
ing center in the world. As secretary of
the committee on classification Captain
MoClellan has just finished aud laid be­
fore the commission a first draft of the
grouping of exhibits which seems to be
universally commended for its clearness,
scopo and perspicuity."
Ilumtlu Kill Hot.
Buffalo Bill, the celebrated Indian
scout and Wild West showman, was a
passenger on tho delayed through train
Tuesday. He was asleep while the train
was at the station, and consequently
many of his admirers, who had heard of
his coming, were disappointed in not get­
ting a glimpse of his stalwart form and
long curling hair. From acquaintances
on the train, it was learned that Col.
Cody was going to St. Paul to report to
General Miles. It is said he feels greatly
chagrmned over the order of President
Harrison, countermanding tho order
from General Miles to arrest Sitting Bull
and remove him from tho reservation.
Cody w:.1 his escort were within eight
miles of Bull's camp when a courier over­
took them with the president's
order. It is said this was seemed
on tho petition of Indian Agent Mc
Laughliu, whose influence with Bull is
probably greater than that of any other
white man. Major McLaughlin does
not believo in the tactics of the war de­
partment regarding the arrest of Sitting
Bull, and his influence seems to have
prevailed with the president. Further
developments of an interesting if not
sensational description may be looked
for at any time. Sheriff Bingenheimer.
of Morton county, was an east bound
passenger also. He says that with the
cavalry and soldiers nuw at Ft. Lincoln
there is less anxiety among the citizens
and settlors. It is evidently the inten­
tion of the government to disarm the
Sioux as soon as possible. Every buck
has a good Winchester rifle, better arms
than the soldiers. "Where the}' got the
guns no one knows. It is expected that
there will be music in the air wbeu the
Indians are made to give up their arms,
but it is tho only way to make assurance
of no uprising either this winter or
spring, doubly sure, and the Indians
must submit when sufficient force ln.s
arrived to injure the success of the plan.

It is learned from private sources, sajs
the Bismarck Tribune, that Colonel
Dodge, attorney and political manager
for the Great Northern road in Dakota,
has been promoted and will shortly re­
move to St. Paul, where he will act as
assistant to Colonel Clough. This will
be news to Colonel Dodge's numerous
friends in Jamestown, who are highly
gralified at his brilliant progress in his
chosen profession. Mr. Dodge is regarded
as one of the best lawyers in the north
west and this second promotion is ample
evidence of the fact.

A Small Surplus Figured Out for the
Coming Year Under
the
The vast and increasing business of
the government has been transacted by
the several departments during the year
with faithfulness, energy and success.
The revenues, amounting to above $450,
000.000 have been collected and disbursed
without revealing, so far as I can ascer­
tain, a single case of defalcation or em­
bezzlement. The closest scrutiny of con­
gress is invited to all the methods of ad­
ministration and to every item of expen
diture.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The friendly relations of our country
with the nations of Europe and of the
East have been undisturbed, while the
ties of good will and common interest
that bind us to the states of the West­
ern hemisphere have been notably
strengthened by the conference held
in this capital to consider measures for
the general welfare. Pursuant to the
invitation authorized by congress, the
representatives of every independent
state of the American continent and of
Hayti met in conference in this capital
in October, 1889, and continued in ses­
sion until the lt)th of last April. This
important convocation marks a most in­
teresting and influential epoch in the
history of the Western hemisphere. It
is noteworthy that Brazil, invited while
under an imperial form of government,
shared as a republic in the deliberations
and results of the conference. The rec­
ommendations of this conference were
all transmitted to congress at the last
session.
International Marine Conference.
The international marine conference,
which sat at Washington last winter,
reached a very gratifying result. The
regulations requested have been brought
to the attention of all the governments
represented, and their general adoption
is confidently expected.
Tho Nlnve Trade in Africa.
At the conference of Brussels, to de­
vise means for suppressing the slave
trade in Africa, it soon became evident
that the measure proposed would tax
the resources of the Congo basin be­
yond the revenue avaihttle under the
general act of Berlin of 1884. The
United States not being a party to that
act, could not share in its revision, but
by a separate act the independent state
of Congo was freed from the restrictions
upou a customs revenue. The demoral­
izing and destructive traffic in ardent
spirits among the tribes also claimed the
earnest attention of the conference, and
the delegates of the United States were
foremost in advocating measures for its
repression. An accord was reached, the
influence of which will be very helpful
and extend over a wide region. As soon
as these measures shall receive the sanc­
tion of the Netherlands, for a time with­
held, the general acts will be submitted
for ratification by the senate. Mean­
while negotiations have been opened for
a new aud complex treaty of friendship,
commerce, and navigation between the
United States and the independent state
of Congo.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 1.—The second
session of the Fifty-first congress assem­
bled at noon. Unusual bustle and ac­
tivity was observable at the house and
in the corridors of the Capitol »t an
early hour, as a result of the prepara­
tions for the opening day. In the house
there were several new members sworn
in, and some other preliminary business
attended to before the appointment of
the usual committee to wait on the pres­
ident to notify him that congress was
ready to do business.
The senate met at noon and appointed
a committee to act with the house com­
mittee in notifying the president that
congress was ready to receive any com­
munication he might be pleased to make.
The senate took a recess until 1:30 p. m.
Shortly after reassembling the presi­
dent's message was received aud read
as foliowss:
To the Senate and House of Represent­
atives:
The reports of the several executive
departments which will be laid before
congress in the usual course will exhibit
in detail the operations of the govern­
ment for the last fiscal year. Only the
more important incidents and results,
and chiefly such as may be the founda­
tion of the recommendations I shall sub­
mit will be referred to in this annual
message.

ed by a republic. Diplomatic relations
were at once established with the new
government and it is
confidently believed
that the good relations of the two coun­
tries will be preserved.
The peace of Central Ameiica has
again been disturbed through a revolu­
tionary change in Salvador, which was
not recognized by other states, and hos­
tilities broke out between Salvador and
Guatemala, threatening to involve all
Central America in conflict. The efforts
of this government were promptly and
zealously exerted to compose their dif­
ferences and through the active efforts
of the representative of the United
States, a provisional treaty of peace was
signed August 26, whereby the right of
the republic of Salvador to choose its
own rulers was recognized. The kil­
ling of Gen. Barrundia on board the
Pacific mail steamer Acapulco while
anchored in transit in the port of San
Jose de Guatemala, demanded careful
inquiry, and resulted in recalling United
States Counsul Mizner from his post at
San Jose, for exceeding the bounds of
his authority in intervening, in compli­
ance with the demands of the Guate­
malan authorities, to authorize and ef­
fect, in violation of precedent, the
siezure on a vessel of the United States
of a passenger in transit charged with
political offenses in order that he might
be tried for such offenses under what was
described as martial law.
Tli« Nicaragua Canal Project,
under the control of our citizens, is
making most encouraging progress, all
the preliminary conditions aud initial
operations having been accomplished
within the prescribed time.
Claims Against Chili.
During the past year negotiations have
been renewed for the settlement of the
claims of American citizens against the
government of Chili, principally grow­
ing out of the late war with Peru.
Early and satisfactory adjustment is ex­
pected.
Out* Halations With China,
which have for several years occupied
so important a place in our diplomatic
history, have called for careful consid­
eration and have been the subject of
much correspondence which has re­
sulted in better relations betweeu the
countries.
In pursuance of the concurrent reso­
lution of Oct. 1, 1890, I have proposed to
the governments of Mexico and Great
Britain to consider a conventional regu­
lation of the passage of Chinese laborers
across our southern and northern fron­
tiers.
Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator
selected under the treaty of Dec. 0,1888,
rendered an award to the effect that no
compensation was due from the Danish
government to the United States on ac­
count of what is commonly known as
the Carlos Butterfield claim.
Our relations with the French Repub­
lic continue to be cordial. Our repre­
sentative at that court has very dili
gently urged the removal of the restric­
tions imposed upon our meat products,
and it is believed that substantial prog­
ress has been made towards a just
settlement.
Samoan
The Saruoan treaty, signed last yeai
at Berlin by the representatives of the
United States, Germany and Great
Britain, after due ratification and ex­
change has begun to produce salutarv
effects, alike just to the native anil
equitable to the three powers most- con­
cerned in trade and intercourse with the
Sauioan Islands.
Extradition and Seal Fisheries.
The new treaty of extradition with
Great Britain, after due ratification,
was proclaimed on the Soth of last
March. Its beneficial working is al
readv apparent. The difference between
the two governments touching the fur
seal question in Behring sea not yet
adjusted. The offer to submit the ques­
tion to arbitration,proposed by England,
has not been accepted, for the reason
that the form of submission proposed is
not thought to be calculated to assure a
conclusion satisfactory to either party.
In the tariff act duties were levied on
certain commodities which are included
in the reciprocity treaty now existing
between the United Stares and the
the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indi­
cating the necessary exception in favor
of that Kingdom. I hope congress will
repair what might otherwise seem to be
a breach of faith on the part of this gov­
ernment.
Claims Against Hayti.
Owing to disorders prevailing in Hayti
the terms of payments in the Van Hok
kelen award were not observed by
Hayti. A new agreement as to the
time of payment has been approved and
is now in force. Other just claims of
citizens of the United States will, it is
hoped, speedily yield to friendly treat­
ment.
