The official Italian report says:
Ott the Aelago I'lateau. beginning at
dn yesterday, the battle was re
newed with violence. The enemy,
profiting by the advantages gained the
previous day between Monte Tondare-'
car and Monte Badennecchc, brought
the action up to its fullest extent In
order to carry from the rear the for
midable bastion of Monte Castel flora-
btrto-Meletta dl Galllo; which effort
he had to give up and attack frontally.
The fighting continued fiercely the
whole day from the slopes south of.
Monte Castel Oomberto to the Foxa
spur. The ponderous effort of tho
tnemy carried out with crushing nu
merical preponderance, met with stub
born resistance and numerous counter
attacks by our troops which were de
fending the Meletta strong point,
ground being yielded fool by foot.
Only when tho rear line defence was
being garrisoned by our men was the
order given to withdraw to that line.
On Monte Flor and Monte Castel

eventuality of an uncertain retirement
a glorious sacrifice and a heroic de

Washington, Dec. 0. Postmaster
Burleson's annual report, In which ho,
termed portal employees' affiliation with
labor organizations a menace to the
country, stirred up the National Federa
tion ot Fostal Employees here to.-day.
Thomas F. Flaherty, secretary nnd
troasurer of the organization, defined Mr.
Burleson's attitude as "the Prussian Idea
of democracy." He denied that the alms
of the postal organization were selfish,
and charged that a Hurlesonlzed postal
service would meart Industrial disfran
chisement to a million wago earners.
Mr. Flaherty said: "I challege Mr.
Burleson to name an instance when
threats of a strike have been made by
the postal employees. By alluding to the
postal employees as iiotentlal revolu
tionists he is seeking to discredit them
and ca.it odium upon their present nglta
tlon for a badly needed wage Increase.
"If aftlttallou with tho American Fed'

Burleson pictures then he Is largely re
sponsible for this menace. It Is a sig
nificant fact that more postal employees

Pahih, Dec. 6. L'Homme Libre, M.
Cleraenceau's newspaper, publishes a
remarkable article by a French wrlrcr
In Switzerland, from which observatory
of Europe the clearest perspective of
what Is happening In Germany can be
obtained.
He warns the Allies thafitthc Teu
tons' winter campaign to weaken the
morale of the Entente has been begun.
Th6 Innumerable German splcc' and
agents In Switzerland have redoubled
their efforts to poison the minds of the
peoples and embarrass the Governments.
Iteports of Impending attacks In great
force on the western front with the aid
of troops released by Russia's defection
nre disseminated vigorously, with ru
mors of the Invasion of England nnd of
Imminent rupture between the United
.States and Japan. Summing up "what
Germany expects to accomplish, the
writer says:
"A military defeat, the overthrow of
the 'Clemenceau Government with the
poison of Bololsm In all Its forms will
weaken the patriotism of France and
give strength to Internationalism for the
purposo of splitting France from fnrrher
participation In the activity of the Allies.
Germany then sees the future war, a
war In whleh Germany battles with
England while Japan attacks the United
States.
"To nullify this audacious plan It' Is
our duty to redouble our vigilance ami

statement.
"Two nnd one-half companies Of rail

"with a strength of eight officers and

In tho neighborhood. At 6:30, four
officers and 280 men went to Gouzeau-

and an American Captain. The area
was three miles In the rear of the line
and none of the troops was e--..i;d.
"At 7:15 German barrage fire moved
on Gouzeaucourt after heavy ifhelllng to

some difficulty, due to the artillery, ma

London, Dec. 6. Seven persons were
kllW and twenty-one Injured In a raid
made early to-day on Kngland by about
twenty-flvo German airplanes; of which
only six reached London. Of the vic
tims three were killed nnd ten Injured
In the metropolis. Two of the raiding
Gothas were brought down and their
crews, six men In all, were, rapiurcu.
One of them was driven down In a field
nnd the. crew surrendered.
This Is the nrst raid on London for
moro than a month. Most of the bombs
dropped were incendiary nnd several
flre were started In the metropolis', but
they were quickly put out.
Tho report of Filed Marshal Lord
French, commander of the British home
forces, says:
A raid by about twenty-five enemy
airplanes took placo early this .morn
ing. The first group of raiders came
In over Kent at 1:30 A. M. and
dropped bombs In v.irlous places on
and near the coast. The necond group
made land shortly after 3 A. M
various machines proceeding up tho
Thames and some distance Into Kent.
Both the above groups appear to have
carried out preliminary attacks with
the object of drawing Biinfirc and ex
hausting tho defences, for It was not
until an hour later that the most seri
ous attack developed.
Between 4 and 5:30 A. M. two
groups of enemy machines crossed the
Kmicx coast and three groups the Kent
coast, proceeding toward London on
converging bourses.
Their tactical plan seems to have
been to deliver flo simultaneous at
tacks on tne rnpltal from the north
east, east and southwest. The wholo
of ono group, however, was turned
back by gunfire and the others, not
more than live or six machines, pene
trated Into London.
A report from a southeast England
coast town says the raiders crossed the
coast nt 3:ir o clock this morning, fly
ing o low that British. machine guns
were used iignlnst them nnd helped to
beat off the attack. From then until
6:1! o'clock raiders were crossing and
recrosslng tho coastline, but all their
Incendiary bombs fell In fields and their
explosive bombs Into the sea.
All the peouc had taken shelter and
there weie no casualties. The weather
watt Ideal for raiders. The maon was
extremely bright 111 a clear sky and no
breeze was blowing.
British prepared tho new line whllethey
still held Bourlon Wood.
This -morning the British operation
was completed successfully and, the Ger
mans had reoccupled most of the evacu
ated territory and were digging them
selves 'In. It was, naturally, a sad body
of British troops which made their way
from Bourlon wood. They had fouglit
through many bitter days to capture
and hold the place. They knew It was
best for them to go, still they hated .to
relinquish what had been won. Prob
ably the hardest part was the farewell
said at the graves of comrades scat
tered through the woods. They marked
each mound with Its little wooden cross
before they left.
Bourlon wood has been a nasty place
for the British to hold and It will he as
bad for the Germans. Throughout this
forest are pools of water over which
poisonous gases hang for twenty-four
hours after discharge from the shells.
From their new position tho British ar
tillery will be able to pour a steady
stream of explosives Into the wood. The
zone rrom which the Hritisn retired
south of Bourlon will also bo a hard
place for the enemy to build his de
fences, for It Is low lying ground domi
nated by tho new British lines. .
The new British line Is much stronger
than tho previous one. The British still
retain their hold on the famous Hlnden
linrg lines, which furnish Field Marshal

have not a yet taken the stand In
favor of either of the plans outlined
by the commission. At the conference
with Senator Newlands they Indicated
that while they wcro ready to relinquish
their rights to the Government, they be
lleye that tho regulation nnd directorial
functlpns ot the transportation system
should continue to repose In the hands of
the corporations themselves, '
It was Intimated bf7ouo member or
the board that there might possibly be
no objection to n nlan whereby the Presi
dent should appoint a rail r nnd adminis
trator who In theory might run the
railroads, but who actually would merely
wive orders which the Railroads Wnr
Board and the present tffiinngcriai organ
izations of the roads would carry out.
The placing of Government agents
directly In charge of tho railroads would
be decidedly objectlonnble under any
plan. The preponderance of sentiment
among ratlrond executives, however,
seems to bo In favor nt least of a fair
trial ot the first plan of tho commis
sion. Senator Hoke Smith Is not In favor
of lending any large" sum r.f money to
the railroads to be expended under their
direction and nt their own will, die
favors the creation of a Federal equip
ment trust, which shall lend necessary
rolling stock and other equipment to
tho railways, while title thereto con
tinues to reposo In the Government and
for which tlw railways will pay tho
Government adequate rental for the war
period.
The later disposition of such equip
ment when the. war Is over, Senator
Smith said to-day. was a matter to be
taken care of then. He believes tho
railways might then purchase such
equipment nt a price to he determined
equitably.
