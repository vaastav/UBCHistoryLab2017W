In the same connection he makes
strong recommendations as to how the
nation should deal with anarchy. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchy be not permitted, and requests
congress to enact legislation that will
prevent anarchists from foreign countries
landing upon our shores. He would also
have tne federal courts given jurisdiction
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, pr any
person who is in line for succession to
the presidency. He has no fear, however,
that the country will eve^ fall into an
archy.
"The federal courts should be given jur
isdiction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kill the president or any man
who by the constitution or by law is in
line of succession for the presidency,
while the punishment for an unsuccessful
attempt should be proportioned to the
timnnlty of the offense against our

The following comprehensive ium
tnary pf President Roosevelt* nteaaag* to
congress:
The president begins his first annual
communication with an official announce
ment of the death of the late President
MeKlnley. and a eulogy of his former
chief In which he says:
"It is not too much to say that at the
time of President McKlnley's death he
ww the most widely-loved man in all the
United 8tates, while we have never had
any public man of his position who has
been so wholly free from the bitter ani
mosities Incident to public life. His po
litical opponents were the first to bear
the heartiest and most generous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity
in publle life he united the tender affee
tlons and home virtues which are all
important In the makeup of national
character. A gallant soldier in the great
war for the union, he also shone as an
example to all our people because of his
conduct In the most sacred and intimate
of home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him, for he never act
ed with aught but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fall to
respect him who knew him in public or
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to excuse their
criminality by asserting that It is exer
cised for political ends inveigh against
wealth ana Irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be urged."
"The shock, the grief of the country, are
bitter in the minds of ail who saw the
dark days while the president yet hovered
between life and death. At last the light
was stilled in the kindly eyes, and the
breath went from the lips that even i*i
mortal agony uttered no words save of
forgiveness to his murderer, of love for
his friends and of unfaltering trust in the
will of1 the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with infinite sorrow, but with such
pride in what he had accomplished and in
nls own personal character that we feel
the blow not as struck at him, but as
struck at the nation. We mourn a good
and great president who Is dead, but
while we mourn we are lifted up by the
splendid achievements of his life and the
grand heroism with which he met his
death."

Anarchy Is a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should band
against thp anarchist. His crime should
tc irnde an offense against the law of
nations, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slave trade, for it
is of far blacker Infamy than either. It
should be so declared by treaties among
all civilized powers. Such treaties would
give to the federal jrovcrnment the power
of dealing with the cfime."
The TruKta.
The president sees cause for congratu
lation lor the nation in the business condi
tions of the present, but sees in the "tre
mendous anu. highly complex industrial
development wluh went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the latter half
of the nineteenth century" a serious social
problem for the prtstnt and future. He
does not believe that the old laws and old
customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and»d!strlbution of wealth of
the preseht time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any other governmental action, but to
natural causes In the business world, op
erating in other countries as they operate
in our own." In this connection he says:
"The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of Which Is wholly
without warrant. It *is not true that as
the rich have grown richer the poor have
rown poorer. On the contrary, never be
has the average man, the wage
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been so well off as In this country and
at -the present time. There have been
abuses connected with the accumulation
of wealth, yet it remains true that a for
tune accumulated in legitimate business
can be accumulated by the person spe
ctalty benefited only on condition of con
ferring immense incidental benefits upon
others. Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can only ex
ist. if the conditions are such as to offer
great prises as the rewards' of success."
But while he realises existing condi
tions, he emphastses the fact that congress
in providing remedies must act *wlth cau
tion, -M the men and -corporations "who
have built up our commerce and driven our
raUrmuto across the continent have done
grtat good to our people, and without
them the material development of which
we
am/so
justly proud could never have
taken place. Moreover, we should recog
nise the immense importance to this ma
terial development of leaving as unham
pered *8 is compatible with ths*publlc
good the strong and forceful men upon
whom the success of business operations
inevitably rests. The slightest study of
business conditions will satisfy anyone
capable of forming a judgment that the
personal equation Is the most Important
factor in a business operation: that the
business ability Of the man at the head of
any business concern, big or little. Is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf ttstween
strtklng suooess and hopeless failure."
Anptntr reason for caution in trust legis
lation which he gives "is to be found in the
International commercial conditions of to

PO'Hts to the fact that in the past
tne ignorant or reckleai urltntor hna
the
been

or reckless agitator has
,r**Hy effective friend of the
evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing- In dealing with business interests
ror the government to undertake by
crude and ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would be
to incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional disaster that it would be prefer
able to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the Impossible or the
undesirable serve as the allies of the
forces, with which they are nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to find out ln rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to what
extent and in what manner it is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies for tke Trust Evil.
But while he says the above is true, he
yet sees many evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
ch.ef is over capitalization, "because of
its many baleful consequences.'' He says:
'"The conviction of the American people
that the great corporations, known us
trusts, are In certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
is- based upon sincere conviction that com
bination and concentration should be not
prohibited, but supervised and within
reasonable limits controlled, and in my
judgment this conviction is right."
As a remedy for these evils he says:
"The first essential ln determining how
to deal with the great industrial com
binations is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the interest of the public
the government should have the right to
Inspect and examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged in inter
state business. Publicity Is the only sure
remedy which we can now invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way
of governmental regulation or taxation
can only be determined after publicity
has been obtained by process of law and
in the course of administration. The»first
requisite is knowledge, full and complete
—knowledge which may be made public
to the world.
"Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and joint stock or other associations de
pending upon any statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to proper governmental supervision, and
full and accurate information as to their
operations should be made public regu
larly at reasonable Intervals."
"The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
state, always do business in many states,
often doing very little business in the
state where they are incorporated. There
is utter lack of uniformity in the state
laws about them, and as no state has
any exclusive Interest in or power over
their acts It has ln practice proved im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therefore in the
interest of the whole people the nation
should, without interfering with the pow
er of the states *In the matter itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporations doing an inter
state business. This is especially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency ln its
business. There would be no hardship in
such supervision. Banks are subject to
it. and in their case it is now accepted
as a simple matter of course. Indeed It
is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so far as is now the case with the
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts ln
order to produce excellent results."
The president believes that it will be
possible to secure the needed remedies
for the trust evil under th»j constitution
as it now exists, but if congress thinks
otherwise he receinmends that a constitu
tional amendment be subm tted tnat will
co» fer the po*t» necessary.
In connection with the irusts he rec
ommends legislation creating a cabinet of
ficer. to b« krowii

neoe, whosa d« ties would be to deal
with all qu .scions concern'/ commcrce,
•luhcr and the mfebant marine.
Would Exclude the Chinese.
The message contains a strong recom
mendation lor t! e reenactment at once'
of tne present Chinese exclusion act, in
which connection he says:
"Wages are higher to-day In the United
States than ever before in our history
and far higher than in any other coun
try. The standard of living is also higher
than ever before. Every effort of legis
lator and administrator should be bent to
secure the permanency of this condition
of things and Its improvement wherever
possible. Not only must our labor be
protected by the tariff, but it should also
be protected so far as It is possible from
the presence in this country of anv la
borers brought over by contract or of
those who. coming freely, yet represent
a standard of living so depressed that
they cutf undersell our men in the, labor
market arid drag them to a lower level.
I regard it.as necessary, with this end
in view, to reenact Immediately the law
excluding Chinese laborers and to
strengthen it wherever necessary in or
der to make its enforcement entirely ef
fective."
He also recommends such legislation, by
an amendment to the Interstate commerce
law, as will protect the labor of one state
from competing with the prison labor of
another state, and also that the govern
ment cease being a party to this competi
tion by not purchasing goods made either
by convict labor or that in which women
and children are caused to work excessive
hours or at night.
In the labor unions of the present he sees
much that is good, in which connection he
says:
"Very great good has been and will be
accomplished by associations or unions
of wageworkers when" managed with
forethought and when they combine In
sistence upon their own rights with law
abiding respect for the rights of others.
The display of these qualities in» such
"bodies is a duty to the nation no:less
than to the associations themselves.-
Finally there must also in many cuses be
action by the government in qrder to
safeguard the rights and Interests of all.
Under our constitution there is much
more scope for such action by the state
and the municipality than by. the nation.
But on points such as those touched on
above the national government can ant.
"When all is said and done, the rule of
brotherhood remains as the Indispensable
prerequisite to success In the kind of na
tional life for "Which we strive. Each
man must work for himself, and unless
he so wortai no outside help can avail
him. 'Btit each man must remember also
that he is Indeed ljds brother's keeper,

The Tariff.
n°t
desire any change
1?. i? Present tariff schedule except where
such may be made In reciprocity treaties,
and recommends the adoption of reciproc
ity treaties and the general policy of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
roreign nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says:
"Every application of our tariff.policy to
meeiu?ur shifting national needs must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties must never be reduced below the
point that will cover the difference between
the labor cost here and abroad. The well
being of the wageworker is a prime consid
eration of our entire policy of economio
legislation.
"Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our industrial
well being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy in dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex
atious in the way of trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom We dispose of our surplus products
in the long run directly or indirectly pur
chase those surplus products by giving us
something in return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enable us to take from them
those products which we can use without
harm to our own industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
"The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the support once
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond- the reach of successful
competition.
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor."
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant
marine "discreditable to us as a nation and
insignificant to that of other nations which
we overtop in other forms of business."
and says we "should not longer submit to
conditions under which only a trifling por
tion of our great commerce is carried in
our own ships. Of this he says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely serve to build up our shipping in
terests, but it would also result in benefit
to all who are interested in the perma
nent establishment of a wider market for
Am':ri'-un oi3uci.s and would provide an
auxiliary lorc-n :or ihe ravy. Ships work
for tii'-ir fW!i cci.rtries just as railroads
work for tli- ir terminal points. Shipping

mad- i.Tv (.v.? 'o carry American
goods In Air' lean bniif ships."
His recorr.r.if (':Uicn on this subject is
only that "our government should take
such action as will remedy these inequali
ties. The American merchant marine
should be restored to the ocean."
Finances.
Under this heading the president recom
mends such legislation as will better safe
guard against the deranging influences of
commercial crises and financial panics and
such as will make the currency of the
country more responsive to the demands
of domestic trade and commerce.
Ho points out the iact that the receipts
from duties on imports ar.d internal taxes
exceed the exptnd'tures of the govern
ment, but counsels against reducing the
revenues so that there
wIj!
b^ the possi­
bility of a deficit.
"But after providing against any such
contingency .r.eans shceld be adopted
which will bring the revenues more nearly
within the limit of our actual needs."
He urges the necessity for strict economy
ln expenditures, but that "our national
needs forbid us to be niggardly in the mat
ter of providing whatever is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
Inter-State Commerce.
He points to defects in the interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments to correct them, in which connection
he says:
"Those who complain of the management
of the railways allege that established
rates are not maintained, that re
bates and similar devices are (habitually
resorted to, that ., these preferences are
usually in favor of the large shipper, that
they drive out of business the smaller
competitor, that while many rates are too
low many others are excessive and that
gross preferences are made affecting both
localities and commodities. Upon the oth
er hand, the railways assert that the law
by its very terms tends to produce many
of these Illegal practices by depriving car
riers of that right of concerted action
which they claim is necessary to estab
lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates.
"The act should be amended. The rail
way fs a public servant. Its rateB should
be just to and open to all shippers anke.
The government should see to it that
within its jurisdiction this is so and
should provide a speedy, inexpensive add
effective remedy to that end. At the same
time it must not be forgotten that our
railways are the arteries through which
the commercial llfeblood of this nation
flows. Nothing could be more foolish than
the enactment of legislation which would
unnecessarily interfere with the develop
ment and operation of these commercial
agencies."

president should have by la* the power
of transferring lands for use a*
forest re
wrres to the department of agriculture.
He already has 'such
"bower ln tne case of
lands needed by the departments of,war
and the navy." 7
Irrigation.
Irrigation ln connection with tfc* waste
lands of the west is a question to which
the president gives considerable attention,
and makes strong recommendations for
government assistance in reclaiming the
waste lands by assisting in their irriga
tion and the control of water rights wher
ever that is possible, and of this he says:
"ln the and region it is water, not land,
which measures production. The western
halt of the Lnited States would sustain a
population greater than that at our whole
country to-uay if the waters that now run
to waste were saved and used for irriga
tion. The forest and water problems are
peirhaps the most vital internal questions
of the United States.
"In cases where natural conditions have
been restored for a lew years vegetation
has again carpeted the ground, birds and
d«er are coming back, and hundreds of
persons, especially from the immediate
neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy
the privilege of camping. Some at leas*
of the forest reserves should afford per
petual protection to the native fauna and
flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger
kinds and free camping grounds for the
ever-increasing numbers ot men and wom
en who have learned to find rest, health
and recreation in the splendid forests and
flower-clad' meadows of our mountains.
The forest reserves should be set apart
forever for the use and benefit of our peo
ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the
shortsighted greed of a few."
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters^of the
arid region Great storage works are nec
essary to equalize the flow of streams and
to save the flood waters. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomplished by the in
dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching
interstate problems are involved, and the
resources of single states would often be
inade'£^uite. It is properly a national
function,-at least in some of its features.
It is as right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of another kind. The
storing of the floods in reservoirs at the
headwaters of our rivffrs is but an en
largement of our present policy of river
control under which levees are built on
the lower reaches of the same streams.
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other
public works. Where their purpose is to
regulate the flow of streams the water
should be turned freely into the channels
in the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws as the natural flow.
"The reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion of
our country, just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros
perity to the Atlantic states. The in
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate industrial production,
while wider home markets ana the trade
of Asia will consume the larger food sup
plies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In
deed, the products of irrigation will be
consumed chiefly in upbuilding local cen
ters of mining and other industries which
would otherwise not come into existence
at all. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful homemaking is but another
name for the, upbuilding of the nation."
He counsels against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises, tnat we let
experience on a small plan teach the pos
sibilities of greater undertakings. He also
cites the conditions ugd^r which the set
tlers of the west ars^atttimpting to build
homes on these ar^d. lftnds, and says:
"The security and, v$lue of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered in ordinary suits' at
law. With a few creditable exceptions,
the arid states have failed to provide for
the certain and just division of streams in
times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws
have made It possible to establish rights
to water in excess of actual uses or ne
cessities, ahd many streams have already
passed Into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"Whoever controls a stream feraotically
controls the land It renders productive, and
the doctrine of- private ownership ot waiter
apart from land cannot prevail without
causing enduring wrong. The recognition
of such owneranip. which has been per
mitted to grow tip in th* arid regions,
should give way $0 a mors enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of the pub
lic in the contvol and disposal
ot
the pub­
lic water supplies. Laws founded upon
conditions obtaining In humid regions,
where water ls too abundant to Justify
hoarding It.'have no proper application In
a Jry country.
"In the arid states the only right to water
which should be recognised is that of use.
In irrigation this right should attach to
the land reclaimed and be inseparable
therefrom. Qranting perpetual water
rightsto other -than users without
compensation to the public Is open to all
the objections which apply to giving away
perpetual franchises to the public utili
ties 'Of the cities. A few of the western
states have already recognized this and
have* Incorporated in their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state Ownership
.of water." y
T^e Colonies. V
Considerable attention is given the col
onies, and especially the Philippines. This
section *of the message begins by citing
the needs of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii cur aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional American
lines. We do not wish a regioivof large
estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves, till the farms they own.
All our legislation for the Islands should
be shaped with this end in view. The well
being of the average homemaker must
afford the tri^e test of the healthy devel
opment of the islands. The land policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled
on our homestead system."
Of Porto Rico he says the-island is thriv
ing as never before, and is being adminis
tered' efficiently rand honestly, lie deems
no legislation necessary except that con
cerning the: public lands of the island.
He calls attention to the fact that in
Cuba- the .independent government of the
island, will soon be in control, and in the
same connection urges strongly the need
of reciprocal trade relations with the new
nation, upo~n wTilcn subject ne says:
"In the case of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national inter
est why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application., and I most earnest
ly ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed
to the vital need, of providing for a sub
stantial reduction in the tariff duties on
Cuban Imports into the United States.
Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what
we desired that she should stand in inter
national matters in closer and more friend
ly relations with us than with any other
power, and we are bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures ln the interest of
her material well being."
For the Philippines he recommends much
in the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far nor
with too great haste. He says: "We hope
to make our administration of the Islands
honorable to our nation by making it of the
highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves,
and as an earnest of what we intend to do
we point to what we have done.
Already a greater measure of material
prosperity and of governmental honesty
and efficiency has been attained in the
Philippines than ever before in their his
tory."
He says we do not desire to do for the
islanders "merely what has elsewhere been
done for tropic* peoples by even the best
foreign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before, been ^pne for
any people of the tropics—to make them
fit for self-government after the fashion of
the really free nations."
But the Idea of the president is that we
cannot leave the islands at this time, of
which he says:v "To deave the islands at
tbis time would meai&thaf' they would
fall into a welter of murderous anarchy.
Such a desertion of duty on bur part
would be a crime agamst humanity."
But he believes sufficient progress has
been made along the lines under which we
have been working in the islands to war
rant us in passing new. legislation, but ln
this connection he- urges the need of cau
tion. He believes the time has come when
the Industries of which the Islands ara
capable should be encouraged by granting
franchises for their development, and of
this he says:
"Notfcfag better can be done for the Is
lands than to Introduce'lndustrlal enter*
prtsea.. Nothing would baneflt them sa
much as throwing them open to industrial
development. Tbe oeoaectlon be twees
idten«Mi«a4 mlBohd^ ls pnrverbial, and the
opportunity to do remunerative work is
one of tne surest preventives of war. Of
rourse no business man will go into the
Philippines unless IV ls- to his Interest to
do so, and It is Immensely to the interest
of the islands that &e should go In. It is
therefor* necessary that the' congress
should pass laws,by which the resources
of the islands caji be developed, so that
franchises (for limited terms of years) can
be granted to companies doing business in
them and every encouragement be given
to the Incoming of business men of every
kind.
"Not to permit this is to do a wrong to
the Philippines. The franchises must be
granted and the business permitted only
undier regulations which will guarantee the
Islands against, any kind of Improper ex
ploitation. But the' vast natural wealth
of the islands must-be developed, and the
capital willing: to develop it must be given
the opportunity. The field must be thrown
open to Individual enterprise, which has
been the real factor in the development of
every region over which our flag has flown.
It is urgently necessary to enact suitable
laws dealing with general transportation,
mining, banking, currency, homesteads and
the use and ownership of the lands and
timber. Those laws will give free play to
Industrial enterprise, and1 the commercial
development which will surely follow will
afford to the people of the Islands the
best' proofs ot the sincerity of our desire
to aid them."
The construction of & Pacific cable is
also urged, either that the government
lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and
the Philippines, or that an arrangement
be made by which the advantages ac
cruing from a government cable may be
secured to the government by contract
with a private cable company. This he
deems necessary for both commercial,
political and military, considerations.

Tk« Monroe Doctrine,
The president sets forth the objects of
the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in
which .it has been received by other
countries, and in connection with it says
this nation has not the slightest desire to
acquire any territory at the expense of
any of our neighbors, and cites our atti
tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our
good faith. He says also that "this
doctrine has nothing to do with th* com*-,
mercial relations of any American power
save that it in truth allows each of them'
to form such as it desires." That "w*
do not ask for any exclusive commercial
treaty with any other American state."
He says of this:
"The Monroe doctrine should be th*
cardinal feature of the foreign policy of
all the nations of the two Americas as
it is of the United States. Just 78 years
have passed since President Monroe In
his annual message announced that 'th*
American continents are henceforth not
to be considered as subjects for futur*
colonization by any European power.' In
other words, the Monroe doctrine is a
declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any non-Ameri
can power at the expense of any Ameri
can power on American soil. It Is in no
wise intended as hostile to any nation in
the old world. Still less Is it intended to
give cover to any aggression by one new
world power at the expense of any other.
It is simply a step, and a long step, to
ward assuring the universal peace of the
World by securing the possibility of per
manent peace on this hemisphere."
The Navy,
The president urges th* continued tip*
building of the navy as a means of per
forming our international duties as well as•
a protection and safeguard for our inters
national rights. He urge* that our pi*##
as a first-class power neoes«itates
building and maintenance of a navy
keeping with our place among the hattone
of the world, and says:
"So far from being in any way a prov«
cation to war, "an adequate and
trained navy is the best guarantee a

He calls attention to the need of an
isthmian canal,- and says:
"Its importance to the nation is by no
means limited merely to its material ef
fects upon our business prosperity, and
yet with a view to these effects alone it
would be to the last degree important
for us immediately to begin it. While its
beneficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states, it would
also greatly benefit other sections. If is
emphatically a work which it is for the
interest of the entire country to begin
and complete as soon as possible it is
one of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake with pros
pects of success and which when done
a^not only permanent assets in the na
tions material interests, but standing
monuments to its constructive ability."
Of the new treaty recently concluded
with England he says: "I am glad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Groat Britain,
conducted on both sides ln a spirit or
friendliness and mutual good will and re
spect, have resulted in my being able to
lay before the senate a treaty which if
ratified1 will enable us to begin preparations
for an isthmian canal at any time and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever asked ln connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction and maintenance of a necessarily
American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United Stateg.
alone shall do the work of building ana
assume the responsibility of safeguarding
the canal and shall regulate Its neutral use
by all nations on terms of equality
without the guarantee or Interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at ones
be laid before the senate, and if ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give effect to the advantages it secures
us by providing for the building of thai
eanal."
