Tbo Message.
The Message ol Prcskltni Grant, read in
Congress on Monday, is given on our second
page. The docni"-- tiossesscs, at least, the
merit of brevity. The Ytsideat gives us a
hasty, humdrum review t our foreign and
domestic affairs, makes r .cw ad eaptandmn re
commendations to wL.Ji coDgresa is not ex
pected to pay any attention, indulges in a few
platitudes, and tlieu dismisses the matter as
another disagreeable formality got along with
with the least pos&ihlo trouble. The ouly
point on which the President appears to gut
out of the old rut in wlndi he and his party
have been traveling since the inauguration of
the reign of radicalism und iiialiguity iit 1SG0,
is that where he recoil r) ends the granting ot
general uiuncMy to the Southern people ; but
Trh:'.tever glimmering of hutn&uity and com
mon sense there maybe in the rccomiiicnla
tion, is at once dissipated by another recom
mendation, that the odious kuklux bill be con
tinued in force. This is equal to a proposal
to release the prisoners from a penitentiary
that they may be put upon the rack or drawn
and quartered. The message is, in brief, cha
racteristic of Grant throughout, and that can
only mean that it is a fearful descent from the
annual presidential rtsume the country was
wont to receive in the better days of the Re
public. The News.
Congress met on Monday, a quorum being
present in botli houses, Besides reading and
referring the President's Message, very little
business was done. Speaker Blaine announ
ced the standing committees ofthe house,
"wLich are chiefly notnbla for the manner in
which the west is slighted. The senate, as
Usual, elected its committees. An effort to re
Store Sumner to the head of the Foreigu Af
.fairs committee, being opposed by Grant, fail
ed ignobly, and the position was given to the
-firtuous Cameron, who manifested his fitness
for it a year ago by expressing his opposition
ito allowiug the Alabama claims, saying they
were no more just than the Georgia, Florida,
or tho claims of any other rebel state ! Shurz,
'the ablest man iu the senate, is not placed
.at the bead of a single committee.
Senator Trumbull denounces as false the
statement of an "interviewer," that he was in
favor of the re-election of Grant.
The Illinois legislature has had a quorum iu
'both houses since Monday, and has been hard
;at work. No mcaanre of importance, howev
-er, has yet been passed.

The news from England relates chiefly to
the ".startling" progress of republican ideas.
A bolition of the house of 1 rds and an elective

The facts presented by Mayor Mud ill to the
City Council of Chicago, in bis recent mes
sage, as to tho power of t lie Council to assess
special tuxes for the improvement of streets
and Hide'.valks, place the gabble of the Ottawa
lujotlllrun about the responsibility :i:i,l ci'iiiu
crdity rf our city ainhiinMw in rcgu-'. to city
improvements in its true light. The Su
preme Coin t of the Slste," says M.iyor Mjdill,
"eiuec its re-organization under tin: new con
stitution, 1ms made decisions overruling all
its lo;-mcr decisions, which, carried to their
ulf incite sequence, work a perfect revolution
in tl.c cystein of special assessments, and in
deed overthrow them totally. The corpora
tioh counsel gives it an his opinion that these
lute decisions of the supreme ourt have so un
seUlcl the law of assessments fts to render it
lini 'vsible for the city to continue its Improve
iiu ,.'..-under the present charter, unless it is
desired that th-j cost licri.-ufter of all street op-cu.u.-.,
widening, or uiipioveiuer.ts mid bidc

thai there can be no pn.ibl,. Wuy of making
a special iis'ssment to pMy the cost of i.n im

Signs of Shame.
We are gratified to be able to aty at least
tbis much in favor of the editor of the Ottawa
Republican, that be shows tdgn f being
shamed of himself. The feeling, in his case,
to hare anj merit, should be easy and natural,
Lot the painfully labored column which he is
compelled to indite to eke out an apology
which could have leen said in three lines,
shows that even so lamentable an effort to do
manly thing, went eorelv against the grain.
The case was thU : There was a gentleman of
irreproachable character, whom almost every
soul in this community knows and esteems
whom even William Cullen professes to hold
iu the highest estimation, and whom he cor
dially greets on the street as a friend, smiling
and nuirking in his face while he stabs him in
the back ; and this gentleman, who is in no
public position no candidate for anything
a mere private citizen minding his own busi
ness, William Cullen brutally assails; and
when taxed with the meaDness of the act, he
admits it, bet makes this excuse : ' lie is the
personal and political friend of the editor of
the Fiiee Tuarcr, and the editor of the Frf.e
Thadrr says awful hard things about the re
venue thieves in our party, and he belongs to
a church, and lies in his paper, and he is a
scamp generally, but socially a clever fellow,
and I think his brain is softening,' Jcc., Ac.
That is William Cullen' apology for a cow
ardly and unmanly act! It would take the
lowest kind of a sneak thief to make a mean
er one.
As to the puerile attempt of tbo lityuLhcan
to say something funny at our personal ex
pense, his jokes might provoke a smile were
they not so shockingly butchered in fact
converted into nauseating dishwater, in their
transfer from the La &?,lte Pies. We re
commend, decidedly, that hereafter, when the
UepuUkan steals the wit (!) of the 7V.y, it do
so bodily. As to the "softening of the brain"
business, we take pleasure in guaranteeing
William Callen forever against any sueli ca
lamity. There can be no "softening of brains"
where there are no brains.
The Dixon Herald, a radical paper advo
cating au renewed lease of power for its party,
among other things claima for it "An econ
omical administration and gradual reduction
of the public debt." That's sarcastic. The
republican administration of which that pa
per speaks, last year collected from the peo
ple, mainly from the poor ut that, and not
from tho rich, Four hundred million of dollar,
and out of this enormous sum, less than nen
hundred millions have gone towards the pay
ment of the public debt. The remaining
three hundred millions were distributed
among assessors, collectors, guagers, post
masters itinerant spies and detectives, who
spied and detected nothing that did not yield
them a handsome revenue ; to carpet bag con
gressmen, members of southern legislat ures,
radical scalawags and thieves, and all really
to hold the radical party together and secure
Grunt's reflection. These are facts which
tax payers bhouid consider and ponder well.
OuiTUAKT. It is with more than ordinary
feeling of regret that we are called apon to re
oord the death of Joel W. Armntrotifr, of Doer
Turk. He died at his home on Saturday, Dec,
21, at 3 P. M., of typhoid fever, after im illness
of about eix weeks, agod 5-1 years, 10 months
and 2(i days. His remains were buried on Mon
day last, at the church yard, near hi lae resi
dence, where also lies tho body of bin lamented
sen MulforJ. Sir. Armstrong was among the
pioneer Hettlers of this oounty, haviuir come to
Illinois with his mothur, Elsio .Armstrong, who
litcly died at Morris, in 1831, and bus ever since
resided in thin county. From timo to time he
has bocu entrusted with diffruht local offices,
both of honor itnd responsibility, and in no esse
hs liu Ween otherwise tbttn a faithful public, ser

nolo citizen, and tho entire community regret
his death mid tympathizn with tho fuiuily in
thoir bere&vetnout.

BOMB MATTERS
Pepper Salt and Spire.
Fussing a saloon door, oas evening lately (It
nuy Ncm incredible, bat we do mantgs to get
by one occasionally, without going in) we saw a
pretty kitten shivering on the snowy aad ley
sije-walk. We picked the poor littU thing op
and carried it home. Within two hoars altar
wards that cat died it delirium tremtnt 1 Oar
enewirs insist that that eat caught tha disease
from inhaling our ("BeemusV) breath, bat we
think it contracted imiaa a potu in the usual
way; tie from constantly frequenting saloons.....
Jim Mclnhill an a retriever of drawing things,
is an improvement upon a Newfoundland dog.
One day lately, Jim mv "a cow with a arum
plod born," in the side-cut "all ferlorne," and she
was fast slipping uuder the ice. Seeing a tow line
near, Jim. cut it with his "little hatchet" and
hastily forming a "slip-noose," thtew it over the
cow horns and with the help ot some other
perilous soon hauled the bainte ou shore. Jim
tl.iius no reward, as he believe "virtue it Us
own ruwird." On the following day, at the same
pl tue, Jim heard a crv of distress, but this time
it was not from u cow, but a man an eld gentle
maa who was wheeling a hand cart. Jin ran
to the scene of action and procuring a rope,
slang one end of it to the mau in the water, who
was holding on th edgo of th io. The old
gent seized the rope, and was rapidly beiasr
pulled out. Finding that he was about to ha
-ved ho ehouted, "Hold on boy till I gt my
cart'" A gentleman from Erin, looking on, be
came so disgusted at this that he exolaimej
"By, shlide tho owld miser baek aad let am rot
wid his cart."
Us equaled SfcCEss. There seensi to be no
limit to the amount of business dene, cr that
ean be done at Reddick and Gillen's. Their dai
ly sales foot up la good round sums. In fact,
they show monthly balance sheets and quantities
of goods handled that would do credit to metro
politan wholsale houses. This firm are doing a
large jobbing business with merohants aronad
ns, in the smaller towns. They osn hold this
trade because they buy goods from first hands,
and in large quantities and at a discount be
cause they pay cash. Mr. Gillen's excellent
judgment and extensive experieaee as a buyer
guarantee that, no inferior goods ean aver be
found in this establishment, and this is also a
positive advantage to the inexperienced or
the amall buyer, as it saves a jonrney to the
manufacturers r tbo importer's warehouse, and
even when there could not buy so cheaply ss
from Reddick & Gillen here, aad besides, would
never be deceived as they warrant everything
they sell. While the wholesale trade of this
firm is quite an item, their retail business is
enormous. This comes from the reasons we
have enumerated, and from the fact that their
stock is always full in every department, and
ladies are always sure that whatever artiele they
may find at Reddick & Gillen's is in style sbd
new ar.d a'ood, a well s boing elegant and worth
wht is asked.
Remablb Insurance. It wis only a few
days befor tho great firo that the President of
one of the heaviest of the English insurance
companies (tlie Imperial, of London,) was in
Chicago with a viow t establishing an agency
here, but was so iitiprtsed with the precarious
ncss of our situation thit bo declined to yield to
the temptation of hih premiums and establish an
au'oney here. "I comot do It," said he : "you
have seme fine building's, bat you hav them
surrounded by very bad ones. Tho firt tinio
circumstances combino ngaiurit you, your whole
city will burn up." This experienepd under
writer had hirdty ticao t tret ont of tho country
beforo his predictio-j wis territdy verified.

for tha Northwest Wa observe, however, that
Messrs. Root & Cady, with ebaraoteristio Chica

The following, in reference to the Stock Piano,
which wa copy faom the Round Table, aocorda so
exactly with our own experieaee iothe.purehsse
of one of these instruments, that we endorse and
adopt it as oar own:
People who have tried to gat " putTT ia the
Bound Table are not usually disposed to repeat
the experiment. For tha very reason which this
statement implies we are quite willing at tims
ta aeoept the imputation of puffing for the sake
of doing a good that ws think is deserved.
When an article is offered to the pnblio whioh
we, as ana of tha publio, have thoroughly tested
sad proved to be good, ws feel justified in record
ing the experience, snd so Awarding the praise
whieh we are satisfied is honestly due. Now,
wa have tested in just such a way aSteok Piano ;
wa have subjected saek aa instrument to pro
traeted trial, and that at the baadaof experienced
and fastidious connoiiseurs; and we snake bold
to say on the strsngth of this that, all things
soasidersd parity and sweetness of tone, priee,
finish, snd tha various tochnioal quahtiss whioh
are most esteemed--the Stack Fisao Is every
thing that its makers claim, sad that thoae who
buy it are oerteia of getting a thoroughly good
instrument at a moderate rats.
Mrs. M. W. Baldwin, at her musio rooms in
