WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6. 189.
Tbe publication in The Evening Times of
yesterday of a synopsis of the annual re
port of tbe Secretary of the Treasury
(which will not be formally laid before
Congress until today) was ia direct coa
trnveulkw of tbe understanding that tbe
4c out (advance sbeets of which had
mm prepared for tbe convenience ff the
!ree) should not actually be printed until
the UfKMt itself had been received by the
Speaker of the House. It is customary
fa roco caeee to put the matter in type,
Mad await aoti&catioa from the Capitol
rJwt the report ia question has beea
actually presented ia Congress. Through
a jatstafcea bulletin that Mr. Gage's re
potc had been seat to the House simul
taaooosly with the President's Message,
order was gives to print the synopsis
prepared (and in type) ia The Evening
Times, and this was dose.
33m mistake was a grievous one, and the
apparent breach of fa Kb so serious that
The Times cannot sufficiently apologize
to Secretary Gage or to Mr. David S. Barry,
Ifce Washington correspondent ot the "New
York Sua," through whose courtesy (albeit
la the way of business) the original copy
of the apart -was recerrsd subject to the
OBnlWoac eationed.
The ilesunije.
A we took pleasure in remarking, In
our ewrfag edition of yesterday, the mes
touje of President McKinley to the Ptfty
sfxtk GMgeess, on the occasion of its first
westing, is a great state neper. But thou
saiMte, if not HHoo of Americans, will
Call to realise this personally, although
they may take the word of their favorite
foornals for the fact, because the message
Is nlingrtarr too voluminous to he gener
ally read.
There were three subjects as to which
It was desrrabie and perhaps necessary that
Mr. McKinley should make hie views,
potter, and intentions officially known to
Congress and die nation. These were, the
matter of our position and the Adminis
tration programme ia the Philippines;
that of ike government of our island poe
atisstous. and that of the gold standard de
signs of the party in power represented
by the Executive. AH these topics the mes
sage presents ia complete and excellent
form, leaving nothing to he desired in re
spect of scope and clearness of treatment
Bat these vital things is the aessage
unfortunately are drowned In a vast mass
of matter pertaining to subjects of intrin
sic interest enough to the people charged
-with their eoosWeraxlou. but which It
is suite unnecessary thai the President
should review at length, assuming that
he has departmental Secretaries enjoying
his confidence, whose reports could as well i
or better be SMfearitted ia lieu of all tbe
painful historiographies! labor to which
PreaMents so often and uselessly subject
themselves.
la other words, we mast positively de
plore the prospect that the preimtt mea
aaae, the Philippine, Cubaa. aad other
ceioaJai sections of which should be teed
aad studied by all Americans, will be
lamely lost to the msssw because they
ar lost la a skmgh of minor diplomatic
history, andal detain, and desiccated accounts-current
through which the ordi
nary citizen will not wade and dredge for
the pearls of such a magnum opus. We
are confident that the framers of the
CoaaUtntlon never intended that the Pres
ident of the United States should annually
transform himself into an Encyclopedia
and submit the whole contents
of am mind as well as a repetition of j " owmmerce, mB uvanwge
all things known or Imagined by bis Cabi- i whlch ls cerUln to ccrue to our PPIe
net and bureau omeers, in one fell essay ta tD dtecmy and opening of new
oa the history, philosophy, and statistics I makers through the intelligent efforts of
of emr times-analytical, descriptive, com- j trained and aWe representatives through
pemtlve and complete in one volume. The j 0ttt tke seaports of all tbe continents, are
Queen of England and Empress of India, considerations which should enlist the
rater over four hundred million people careful thought and study of the Senators
and an Empire on whose territory the ! and members of Congress generally, and
sen never sets, can say all she needs to i especially of those charged with the care
her Parliament la a third of a newspaper
ontunoa. What would make a cotwmn aad
a half of Tim Times should amply cover
everything necessary to include in a Presi -
altering to the vital portions of this
message, it would be dimcult to say toe
onach In praise of the stand taken by the
President la regard to Cuba. He ac
knowledges, as all true and honest Ameri
cans do. that we are under solemn aad
Mneang obligations to the people of Cuba,
to give them the blessings of a stable
government aad, after the safe establish -want
of the same, to allow them the full
exTcine of internal independence. Bat
the message does not hold out any idea
that this nation will Ignore it obligations
to olvflixatMsi or lose sight nf what It owes
to itself, by taming loose a half baked
to Ml into the anarchy that marks
lrkn Haiti, and to which state
it certainly would be doomed if now or
fcoon abandoned to (he mercy of its massed
ignorance and demagogues.
The true blue Americanism or the Presi
dent's statements, expressions, and recom
mendations concerning the Philippines do
not require argument to make them appear
so. His narrative of the acquisition of the
archipelago by the United States, of the
Agulnaldo Insurrection and his efforts to
crush it, is concise, complete, and satis
factory. His position that until the fullest
measure of order and respect for our sov
ereignty has been restored in Luzon the
military arm will have to continue in con
trol is unassailable. When peace Is as
sured, arrangements for the civil govern
ment to be provided by Congress will be
made as soon as possible.
The third matter iri""order of importance
considered in the message is the proposed
gold standard. Mr. McKinley now makes
his first bow to the public as an avowed
and uncompromising monometallist. Little
need be said in criticism of his novel posi
tion. It is, of course, dictated by what ha
no doubt regards as political necessity.
He asks Congress to establish the single
gold standard as a. permanent collar on
the neck of the nation and to fasten it so
llruily that it can never be removed.
Among other means to this end he trusts
that the Secretary of the Treasury will be
endowed with power and the mandatory
duty to issue gold bonds and increase the
national debt whenever the banks and
bankers think the time propitious to con
tract the currency and create a money
panic.
It is a Republican Congress he addresses,
and it has the necessary votes to force the
financial measures recommended upon the
country. It yet remains to be seen wheth
er or not it will do so.
MothuoiL'jj Bulldog: Tactics.
Whether he deserves it or not, Lord
Methuen is coming in for some severe crit
icism in connection with his bulldog fight
ing tactic5, not only at Modder River, but
at Belmont and Gras Pan. While the mili
tary writers in London treat the matter
with gome reserve, they arc beginning to
offer remarks on the- absence of precau
tionary movements, and cf generalship ob
servable in the reports of these encounters.
The latest accounts of the Modder battle
impress tho reader with the view that
Cronje carefully prepared a trap for his
antagonist and that the latter calmly walk
ed into it. That he fought his way out,
defeating tbe Boers and driving them
across tbe river, is creditable to his prow
ess and that of his men, but the critics
are saying that "this Is not war." Their
deduction is that tbe same result could
have been accomplished with a fraction of
tbe loss, if Methuen had been less head
long, and bad preceded his direct attack
oa the Boer entrenchments on the south
bank, with some turning movements. The
danger seems to be that his system is using
up men faster than they can be replaced,
and weakening his column out of propor
tion to the loss or demoralization he is in
flicting on his enomy.
News from Natal is too rigidly censored
to give us much notion of what is going
on in that quarter. The opinion however
is firmly fixed that General Joubert Is alive
and actively measuring strategical swords
with General Clery; also that Ladysmith
is safe, or wbb on Saturday. The Boere
appear to have withdrawn from between
Frere and Colenso, and from, between
Weencn and the river. The retirement
of the commando recently in front of
Frere, at Cheveley, and of tho forces be
yond Weenen, and the massing of fresh
troops along Grohler's Kloof, seem to In
dicate that Joubert expects the main at
tack oa his army to be delivered between
the Weenen ford and Colenso.
Buller and Clery are as mysterious as
ever. Where the latter may ue, is, so far,
something nobody is able to find out. But
the tension is too acute to last much long
er. News of a severe battle ought to be
forthcoming without delay.
Imnroviiif? the Foreign Service.
Among the estimates for Government ex
penditure during the fiscal year 1901, Con
gress is asked to Indulge in a very moderate
degree ot liberality in connection with the
improvement of our foreign service in a
few respects. These do sot include the
acquirement of properly in foreign capitals
and the erection of houses in which to
quarter our embassies and legations, for
which we are sorry. Perhaps the President
will make this a matter of special recom
mendation later on.
The estimates contemplate an Increase in
the pay of our Minister at The Hague from
seventy-five hundred to ten thoueand dol
lars. Even the latter sum will not cover
the reasonable expenses of his position,
but it will be some improvement Con
gress is solicited to raise the salaries of
a number of consuls at important ports,
where the emoluments at present are too
low to assure the Government of the serv
ices of first class men.
One minor appropriation proposed should
1 be made without hesitation or question. It
is for the maintenance of ten student in
terpreters at Pekin, at salaries of one thou
sand dollars a year each. The British Gov
ernment keeps a force of eighteen such
students at its Chinese legation, and hns
done so for years. The result is that its
j diplomatic and consular service in China is
! well supplied with Englishmen who can
speak, read, and write the Chinese lan
guage, while, with two exceptions, our
Government has to depend entirely upon
native interpreters who are frequently in
efficient or untrustworthy.
Ia many directions our legislators will
have to- prepare for the extension and
strengthening of our diplomatic and con
sular corps. Our new position as a world
power, the phenomenal increase of our
of foreign relations.
They should realize the growing necessi
ties or the hour in this respect, ana develop
a disposition to co-operate with the Secre
tary of State in the plans for Improving
the service which we have no doubt have
been suggested to him, as a result of long
experience in the department of which
J he is now the head, and as Ambassador
I at the Court of St. James. It may he in
. teresting to the foreign committees of the
two houses to remember iu connection
with any comprehensive scheme for onlarg
; In the scope of our service abroad, that
' within a year an excellent school of diplo
I macy has been established in the National
Capital, in connection with the Columbian
University. Among Its professors, two
distinguished Justices of the Supreme
Court, the First Assistant Secretary of
State, and other well known leaders iu
American thonght and national life are
numbered. It should not be forgotten thai
what West Point is to the Army and An
napolis is to tbe Navy, this interesting
university post graduate school of dip
lomacy promises to be to the diplomatic
and consular service, if it is properly sup
ported and encouraged.
The DIsKruntled CiiIuiiih.
Certain officious Cubans whose petulant
attitude is decidedly nauseating should
brush up their memories. They seem to
have forgotten many things, prominent
among which is the fact that America
stepped to the fore when they were writh
ing in the bondage of oppression and res
cued them from its toils. They also fail
to remember the ready sacrifice of good i ell as the galleries of both houses. Yes

.vmencan moou anu treasure x, .

The ingratitude ot persons who pose as
leaders of Cuban thought and affairs was
well Illustrated at the session ot the Emil
iano Nunez Club in Havana on Monday,
when Generals Maximo Gomez and Lacrct
and Senor Cisneros buried their personal
differences and concentrated their unrea
sonable ire upon the nation that succored
them. During the indignation meeting nu
merous opinions were expressed, all rooted
in the unfounded suspicion that America
would fail to keep her promises to bring
about conditions most beneficial to the isl
anders. Even General Gomez remarked
that the war was over and that it was time
for all to unite to accomplish tho aims ot
the revolution.
Cuba was promised the opportunity for
self-government when .her people had
proved themselves capable of managing
their affairs along peaceful and civilized
lines. It may not be irrelevant to remark
that the preliminaries necessary to such a
condition have not yet been conspicuously
in evidence. The conscientious apprecia
tion of defects and the earnest effort for
their elimination can scarcely result from
such insinuations and interchanges of idle
opinions as occurred at the club session
mentioned.
The infant that endeavors to run a foot
race before it has demonstrated its ability
to creep comes to sudden grief. As far as
is ascertainable, Cuba has done nothing
since American possession to prove her
capability of self-govornment. The cable
tidings have been confined to fault-findings
and more or less threatening declarations
by those who profess to be the mouthpieces
of the people. There is, however, no incli
nation to believe, without awniling devel
opments, that the idle and ambitious
trouble-mongers who have attracted atten
tion aro voicing the genuine sentiment of
the populace. An appetite for offices is
frequently conducive to a habit ot boister
ous talk, accompanied by violent motions,
especially when the subject is of Latin ori
gin. History has failed to record an instance
where America as a nation has deliberately
violated an agreement; and a form of gov
ernment best suited to Cuba's interest, to
the apparent needs of a benighted popula
tion, will come all in good timo. Mean
whllo the demonstrative individuals with
premature opinions and a surplus of in
uendo and invective should either subside
or go to work.
Some history-making measures are
scheduled for the action of tho new Con
gress, and notwithstanding the arbitrary
character ot the Reed House rules there is
a prospect that the popular wing of the
National Legislature may make things oth
erwise than stereotyped. For instance,
there is an interesting minority, with a
shrewd parliamentarian as Its guldiug spir
it, and a sufficient defection in the ranks
of tho ruling element followed by co-operation
with the Democrats might easily upset
executive plans concerning more than ono
cherished scheme for conserving Adminis
tration interests.
According to the esteemed Filipino junta
at Hongkong, Aguinaldo has expressed his
willingness to surrender to our Consul at
that place it he will go to Manila and there
receive the penitent Tagal's submission.
This Is interesting as well as alarming.
First it shows that Aguinaldo would rath
er fall into the hands of the Wildman of
Hongkong than of the wild men of the
Luzon mountains. Second, it suggests that
a number of influential citizens, official or
otherwise, who have had commercial in
terests in Manila, will quake in their boots.
Aguinaldo knows a lot that it would be
greatly embarrassing to have let out.
If the decision of the United States Su
preme Court in tho Addyston Pipe and
Steel Company case is to be a precedent,
which will make the Sherman law a live
instead of a defunct statute, then the op
pressing army of American trusts may well
view the situation with alarm. The ad
verse ruling of the highest tribunal deals
a severe blow to the aspirations of these
ambitious corporations and calls a halt on
tho determined efforts ot plutocratic con
cerns to stifle all competition. The de
cision of Justice Peckhara brands the
methods of the iron pipe trust as an un
lawful con&piracy. The campaign for the
annihilation of lawless combinations of
capital has been auspiciously Inaugurated.
In London opinion is general that the
Boer Government will hardly venture to
treat the new Consul to Pretoria, who is
a son of the American Secretary of State,
with incivility. That is a natural inference,
but we have our doubts. Since tho Boer
junta in New York failed to stir up trouble
between this country and England over the
war, as it doubtless had assured Kruger it
could and would, we suspect that Secretary
Hay's son would be about as much persona
grata as Cecil Rhodes' hoy would be. Oom
Paul knows little of the outside world, and
it he was not afraid to fight Great Britain
no one need be surprised if he should take
it into his head to Insult America, in the
person of our Consul.
The Open Door Policy.
(From the Boston Herald.)
As the experience of nglutul has shown, the
lcet colonial growth is found where the mother
country accords to the dependency the right to
trade wherever it pleases. If, instead of follow
ing this method, wc copy the Spanish plan of
exploiting- a dependency for the benefit of our
own people, regardles? of the industrial welfare
of iU) inhabitants, wc cannot make other than a
failure of our new policy of expansion. AVe
should affirm, without regard to what other na
tions may demand, the "open duor't policy for
tin- Philippine Ttlafld as an act of justice to the
lihpinojj themselves.

POLITICAL flOXES AND GOSSIP
The President's MeiiaBC-jrr. Me
Kinley's annual message, which was read in
both houses ot Congress yesterday, is un
hesitatingly pronounced to be the ablest
state paper that has bee& issued from the
White House bearing his signature. It was
more explicit tfndjf direct than any of Mr
McKinley's previous utterances, and was
evidently prepared vith great care. As a
rule, the reading of the President's mes
sage at the Capitol is not an event of ab
sorbing Interest The appearance of Major
Pruden with the official document has gen
erally the effect of clearing the floor as
' th Qt lhc Caultol
was not to empty benches. A quorum was
present in both the House and the Senate
during the vo hours or more that was giv
en over to the reading of the document.
Republican comment upon the message was
upon the whole favorable. Every import
ant point in it, it was said, had been3ub
mitted In advance to the President's po
litical advisers, with the result that scarcely
a word was Included in it that had not been
approved by the Republican managers. Mr
McKinley Is recognized today as the in
evitable nominee of his party next year
for President, and, therefore, his message
substantially defines the platform and pol
icy of the Republican pary in the Presi
dential cainpalgn. of 1900
Leading Democrats were averse to com
menting at length upon the message last
night. They preferred, they said, to care
fully read and digest Mr. McKinley's re
marks before attempting to analyze or crit- j
iclso them. Mr. McKinley's emphatic dec
laration in favor of the single gold stand
ard was received by the-Democratic lead
ers with satisfaction. Mr. McKinley, they
declared, has now burned his bridges be
hind him on the financial question. He can
no longer pose before the country in the
role ot bimetalllst. In the judgment ot
n good many conservative Democrats who
discussed the matter at the Capitol and
around the hotels last night, the predomin
ating issues In the Presidential campaign
next year would be silver and trusts. Very
little, they asserted, would be heard on the
stump next year about "Imperialism."
Senntor Hayvrnrd'M Denth. The
news of the death of Senator-elect Hay
ward of Nebraska, which waa received yes
terday, occasioned no surprise In the Sen
ate, as it had been anticipated for several
days. Judgo Hayward was elected just
after the adjournment of Congress last
March, and he consequently never qualified.
Governor Poynter, of Nebraska, Is a. Popu
list, and a friend of Mr. Bryan. Tho Legis
lature which elected Hayward has adjourn
ed sine die and will not come together
again unless the Governor issues a call
for an extra session, which he is not like
ly to do.
The point was raised yesterday t
that as Judge Hayward died before he was
sworn in no senatorial vacancy occurred
which Governor Poynter would have the
right to fill. Governor Poynter's appointee,
according to this contention, would be
piaceu m me same category vtuaj -"
other appointees of Governors
1.1UI1J Kll.un.-n
where the Legislatures failed to elect. If
Mr. Bryan should receive the appointment
to fill Hayward's vacancy It was Enid that
the point montioned might be raised ser
iously. Mr. Bryan's friends In Washing
ton hardly think that he will care to come
to the Senate at this time. They think
that ho will prefer to remain a private
citizen until lie receives tho nomination ot
the Democratic party for President next
year. Governor Poynter will probably
be governed by Mr. Bryan's wishes in the
matter. If Judge Hayward's immediate
successor is not. Mr. Bryan it will, it is
believed, be former Senator W. V. Allen.
It is a. singular fact that no man has ever
been nominated -ami elected to the Presi
dency from the Senate of the United States.
Presidential aspiaBt8--have grown almost
to regard the Senate as a veritable "hoo
doo." nennlilicnu. Convention Gossip.
Senators Piatt and Depew of New York
have undertaken a contract, it Is under
stood, to secure the Republican National
Convention for the metropolis of the coun
try next year. They have both been inter
viewed and say that New loric is
1 the proper place for the convention to
meet and that they will do overytning in
I tnejr power to have that city selected at
tho meeting of the Republican National
Committee in this city next week. Mr.
Piatt, It can be stated in tho strictest con
fidence, is not sanguine of capturing tbo
prize for his adopted town. He is letting
his colleague, Depew, do the hustling and
predicting in that connection. Mr. Oepow
is a new man In the field of national poli
tics, although he has been a Presidential
possibility In his own judgment for a good
many years. He does not fully realize
iust how popular the city of New York
is in the rural districts, but he Is in a fair ;
Iway to obtain some vaiuaoie laioruiiiuou
upon that point, it is believed, notore no
is many days older. The genoral opin
ion among Republican statesmen Is that
Chicago will bo selected for the place of
meeting for their national convention next
year.
The Wiiiiilriiii.i lloosevelt.
(Horn the New Yoik Ilvenlittr Post.)
The following is one of man similar enquhie
which eomu to us:
"Can you tell me- why it is that Governor
Hoosevelt has 'gone into training,' under the tui
tion of a professional pucilist, on the eve of- the
HSHsmbling of the legislature? The account
which i3 published of hi preparations sins
that lie his converted tlv billiard room of the
executive mansion into a kind of prize rins,
anil that lie 'trains in re(,iilar riim ountume.'
Tbiis i, I think, an entirely unpiecedented pro
oecdniff on the part of a Governor of a civilised
State, and I am curious to know what it fore-
shadows. Is he preparing for a liand-to-liand
tussle with Piatt, or ton l'an or Qiiifxr
We have no cxclu.ive information on thi suh
joct, and can only tay that it seems to u ex
plicable as a part of that ntrennow-. life uhielt our
Governor habitually leads. If Mr. I'latt or Mr.
I'ayn Ls made nervous by this new phase of the
life, that is.no affair of outs. We must coufeM
to a elicit emotion of surprise at the special te
of the Governor of a great State training in "reg
ular rinp: cobtuine" under a professional pugilist,
in one of the rooms in the executive mansion, but
it ia to be rememheied that that erudite and far
geeins statesman, Col. Abraham Gniber, predicted
that tho election ot the hero ot Sn Juan Hill to
the governorship .would! be equivalent to the
"comersioa of the executive chamber into a
shooting gallery." We are liing in a heroic
time, and mut set accustomed to thefic novel
development?. It ,is nof intpoffeible that when
the Governor gets himself in first-rate condition,
he may give exhibition, glove contests, in the
converted billiard room of the executive mauoion,
ill. order that the people, or a select portion of
them, may witness bis prowess in "knocking out"
chosen antagonist. That would be an object

Georgia's Treatment of the Xi-Bro.
(From the St. Paul Dispatch.)
The attitude of the I.cgialature of Georgia
toward negro disfranchisement, their turning
dawn, 137 to 3, of the proposition similar to the
constitutional amendments in other Southern
States, will go fir to plate this C'umnKnnialth
in the lead of all Southern btateq. It is the bt
answvf the State could make to the country's
outcry against Georgia's lynehings. Georgia hav
ing sufftrid moie than any other State at the

for tins action.

Cuban People.
HAVANA, Dec. . Tho contract obtained
by Michael Dady for constructing sewers
here was emphatically rejected today at a
meeting of the council. The vote was 12
to 3. It is believed that this anally dis
poses ot a question that has sauced much
trouble. Army officials had long felt that j
the contract was not only veld, but that it
would entail fearful extravagance on the
city. They believed, however, that the
matter should be left to the municipal
council.
Gen. Maximo Gomez ami the members
of Emlliano Nunez Club have published a
manifesto addressed to the Cuban people
saying that in these difficult times the peb
pie should unito to do their utmost for the
j good of the country. Cubans, the manl
I festo adds, are passing through trying mo
I ments and are anxious regarding the ful
I fillment of their ideal, but there is no
cause for anxiety. The American Govern
ment Is acting in accordance with the Joint
resolution adopted by Congress and the
message of the Secretary of War is reas
I suring. The manifesto then proposes that
tho municipalities of the Island act as pop
, ular agents by forming local conventions of
delegates, which shall elect provincial
members of a national assembly. This as
sembly shall select a committee to go to
Washington to act in the name of the Cu
ban people until an independent govern
ment shall be established.
"La DIscusion" says the fact that Cis
neros and Lacret have made friends with
Genoral Gomez does not justify what is 1
helne now snirt that th mnihJ.rs of the i
late assembly admit having been wrong In i
recrard to thnir hohn.vlnr tmvnrd General '
Gomez. Tho paper says the members of neither confer with anyone nor take up the
the assembly are extremely proud of what ' matter until after the funeral.
they did and they think today as they Iasrauch, however, as tbe fusion seati
thought then. Tho question was ono of ment is that Allen lost re-election by a
choosing between allowing General Gomez
to tramplo upon the rights and liberties of
a properly elected revolutionary assembly
or deposing him, which latter choioe was
adopted without personal feelings.
The papers here received President Mc
Kinley's message only in time to isauo ex
tras Containing' summaries. No comments
were made.
A group of Cubans has decided to peti
tion Mayor Lacoste to annul the order
against flying the Spanish flag on buildings
in Havana. The National party and the
veterans will be asked to lend their support
to the movement.
Twenty-six-municipalities have protested
to Secretary Capote against the new police
plan, which they say takes away from the
municipalities the control ot the police.
ELEVATOES AT MONTREAL.
IMuiin Mntiirtiifr to Divert
Grain
Trade From Xcw Yurie,
MONTREAL, Dec, o. Tho Montreal har
bor commissioners, after a consultation to-
(lay wth tIle representatives of the Connors
Syndicate, finally decided to agree to the
proposals of the syndicate to erect large
elevators and warehouses- at the port of
Montreal for the handling of grain shlp-
,nta fmm tho. WW A ls.ao nf tli ft
asked for will be given, to the syndicate,
and the construction of the elevators and
the warehouses will be commenced as soon
as practicable.
A penalty clause, will, however, be added
to the contract providing that if the syndi
cate does not-secure the quantity of grain
stipulated during the first three years, aaine
ly, 25,000,000 bushels during the first sea
son, and So.OOU.OOO during each of the two
other seasons, their properties shall be for
feited. Under the agreement the syndicate
will construct three large elevators besides
large warehouses at a total expenditure of
over 14,000,000. W. J. Connors, of Buffalo.
the head of the syndicate, in an interview
this evening, outlined the plans of tbe syn
dicate as follows:
"We intend to build up a port here that
will give employment to between 2,000 and
0,000 workmen, instead of about. TOO at pres
ent Wo shall bring, instead of S00 vessels
to Montreal during the season of naviga
tion, from 1.C00 to 2,000 vessels. We Intend
to divert a very large part of the traffic
that now goes by way of New York and
Buffalo to Montreal. Only two-tenths ot
the traffic ot the Canadian West now comes
to Montreal. We mean to bring the remain
ing eight-tenths here. We mean to show
that traffic can be handled cheaper here
than in Now York. We will land tho grain
in Liverpool half a cent a. bushel cheaper
than anybody else can. Wo shall have our
own steamers to bring the grain frorn, tht j
lakes to Montreal. There will very shorCy
be a fleet of these vessels pljing on the
canals and lakes. Our object is not to com
pete with New York or any other route. It
is the railways that we mean to compete
with. With the splendid waterways of
Canada we can utilize them in such a way
that we can beat the railways in competi
tion for the grain traffic."

DETROIT. Dec. 3.-Three members ot
the Deep Waterways Commission, Colonel
Raymond, of Philadelphia; Alfred Noble,
of Chicago, and George Wiener, met here
today to formulate a. final report to submit
to Representative Corliss, to bo used as
the basis of a bill to provide for the main
taining of tho lake lovels.
The report will recommend the building
of an automatic dam across Niagara River,
at the foot of Lake Erie, to cost not more
than $2,000,000. It is represented that such
a dam will not materially deepen the water
in tho lakes but will hold the levels as
nature intended them to be. The report
will be unanimous.
The three commissioners will alaO report
i on the speed and carrying capacity of the
vessels of the great lakes, and request
Congress to supply funds to pay for mak
ing a survey, with a view of dredging a
600 foot channel through the Detroit, St

THE DEAD SENATOR-RLKCT.
Monroe I. HujwnnlN I)rmUi IJhc to
3 H' nt nostra In.
LINCOLN. Neh.. Dec. 5. Monroe LHaad
Hayward, junior Senator from Nebraska,
died at 6:20 this morals at his home la
Nebraska City of progressive paralsis. af
ter an illness, of twenty-are days. Hh
physicians unhesitatingly asertb as toe
primary cause of death the great mental
and nervous strain be underwent during
tbe Senatorial struggle mst winter. The
contest lasted ten week, and, from the
first, it was Mr. Hayward against the neW.
Last summer, while making an open-air
address, be suffered the first stroke of
paralysis.
Overwork incident to closing up busi
cess to go to Washington brought on the
second attack.
Immediately upon receipt ot tbe news
I of Senator Hayward's death Ooveraer
Poynter sent condolences to the family,
and Issued a proclamation that all flags
on all public buildings throughout the
State bo placed at half mast natil after the
funeral.
The Governor absolutely refused to dis
cuss the question of who would be appoint
ed to succeed to the vacant senatorship.
He pronounced as false and infamous the
stories that he had conferred with anyone
regarding the matter at any time or that
anyone had been agreed upon. The mat
ter has never been mentioned, save casual-
ly by several Intimate friends, but he con-
sidered it a matter that good taste and
decency barred any discussion ot He will
n"ke and overconadence, it is pretty cer
tain that he will be named.
G. M. Hitchcock, editor of the "Omaha.
World-Herald," is the only other man men
tioned. Republican leaders say they will
request the Governor to call a special ses
sion to elect the successor, but as the Leg
islature ls Republican the request is cer
tain to be ignored. Mr. Hitchcock Is a
close friend to the Governor, and gave the
Populists loyal support last year. On the
other hand, however, the expression was
freely made that Governor Poynter would
offer the place to William J. Bryan, who,
after the hopelessness of Senator-elect
Hayward's condition became known, sud
denly canceled his engagements in the
East and gave it out that he intended to
take a rest until next spring. He Is not
now in Lincoln, and therefore, it is said.
he could not be charged with bringing any
pressure to bear upon the Governor. It is
also said that Bryan's appointment would
heal the breach between the Democrats and
Populists.
Monroe Leiand Hayward. Republican, of
Nebraska City, Neb., was born in Wills
boro, Essex county, N. Y.. December 23.
1S-10. He enlisted in the Twenty-second
New York Infantry at the beginning of
the civil war, and was- afterwards trans
ferred to the Fifth New York Cavalry, but
was discharged in December, 1862, owing to
disability arising from sickness. On re
turning home he entered Fort Bdward Col
legiate Institute, where he completed bis
education.
In the meantime bis father had removed
to Wisconsin, and he followed; studied law
at Whitewater, Wis., and removed to Ne
braska, in 1S67, settling at Nebraska City,
where he has resided ever since, and prac
ticed his profession. He was a Rtenibar of
the State constitutional convention in 1S73;
filled out a term on the district bench by
appointment of the Governor in 1388; was
the Republican candidate for Governor in
the fall ot 1S9S, and was defeated by 3,000
votes. He was elected United States Sena
tor, to succeed. William Vincent Allen,

LATJNCEING OF THE- BAILEY.
The Torpedo Mont Destroyer Chris
tened ni Morri.s lleiirlits.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. The United States
torpedo boat destroyer Bailey was success
fully launched at noon today from the
yards of her builders, the Ga6 Engine and
Power Company and Charles L. Seabury
j & Co., Consolidated, at Morris Heights, on
tho Harlem. A special train from the
Grand Central station took out nineteen
carloads of guests to the launching and
there were about 3,000 persons on band to
see the boat slide into the water. When
all was clear Captain Purdy blew a blast on
a boatswain's whistle, the clamps that held
her from sliding were unscrewed, aad the
Bailey glided slowly into the stream with
out a hitch.
As she started on her journey down the
ways Miss Florence B. Bailey, a grand
daughter of Rear Admiral Bailey, ex
claimed: "I christen thee Bailey," and
broke a bottle ot American champagne on
the port bow of the vessel. The vessel took
the ater with her bows dripping wine
and the band playing "The Star Spangled
Banner." With Miss Bailey were her sis
ter, Mary De P. Bailey, and their father,
Edmund S. Bailey, and a dozen or more
others.
The launching ot the Bailey is notable
for two things. She is the first modern
war vessel to be launched in New York
waters and she is the first vessel of the
torpedo boat destroyer class- built upon de
signs which are purely American from
stem to sLern. All the others are from
designs borrowed from naval builders
abroad.
