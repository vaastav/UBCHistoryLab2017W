The Citizen has got into a strait, with
the American after it on one side and the
Banner on the other. We do not care
to discuss with the Bannner the rela
tive merits of democracy and republi
canism. Tbe Banner has tieciacu tnac
question by deserting the democratic
ranks at a time when it stands in great
est need of the undivided efforts of its
adherents. The Mahonc wave that
threatens to overwhelm the south
looked too formidable for tho Banner
and it has turned its prow and set its
sails to catch the first breeze that cross
es tho Virginia line, and hopes to go
sailing into place and power with those
wba are cultivating administration fa
vor. The Banner has been a good dem
ocratic paper and if the World had not
headed itoffon the "compromise" pol

sailing "Sncedward" with all sails

The American misinterprets the Cit
izen upon ono point. The Citizen has
never advocated a rc-openlnfr of the
100-3 ouestion. We can readily see
what a dcnlorable catastrophe mat
would be. Wo have earnestly and ur
gently called for a council of the party
to adopt some other basis, but not to
leave the question open for one moment,
and never to leave this mooring until
the drag rope is safely fastened about a
better one. The failure of tho party to
adopt thia course before the question
was taken uo by the courts 'renders it
perpetually impossible. As far as the
Citizen was able to judge of what was
best in principle and for the party, it
has done its duty. The state is now in
tho hands of the republicans and we are
not alone in the opinion that it is like
ly to remain so. We deeply deplore it,
but we believe we will bo sustained by
all who have cared to read our utter
ances upon this question that the Citi
zen is blameless. We see no phase ol
the question now that is worth discus
sing.
M.,M.;-a tn the chair and au
dressed the Senate upon a question of
nrivtwe. He said that he hau been
f . ...
elected to the senate as a state crtuii,
democrat and all his acts had been in
furtherance of such views, and when it
came to the vote upon 100-3, in the
absence of anything better, he had vo
ted for it. A Iterwards, in the cuancery
nn.irt at Xah villa, he had been ac
cused of having accepted a bribe. He
ti.nn c0n r,n in a torrent of invective
and denounced the charge as slander
ous and malicious and the author as
liar and a son of the devil, ami demand
ed a full investigation by the senate
lie was followed by Senator Smith of
Fentress, the man who changed his vote
and carried the 100-3 bill. Ha gave a
history of his politics, showing that he
i,,r.to.l us n stare credit man. in a
district that voted 18,000 and gave ouly
2,700 to Vilon, and his vote was in
keeping with hi3 pledges, with the
views of his constituents and was right.
Notwithstanding this, he had been
charged with bribery. He understood
that tho man who made the charges was
in tl. linmc. nnil lie was not going to
dodge his name as Morgan had done
(Morgan interjected the remark that he
had omitted the name only out of self
respect.) John J. Vertrees had come
before the court and uttered lies against
him as foul as thedevil himself. Turn
ing and pointing a long, bony finger di
rect! r into Vertrees' face, as he sat
about ten feet behind him, he denounced
him as a liar and a scoundrel in going
outside of the record to accuse a man of
an infamous act when the bill upon
which he was speaking had not dared to
do so. He wanted a thorough invest!
gatiou and ho wanted to say as hard
things against Vertrees as had been said
arains him. Vertrees knew he was
sale from a challenge, as ho could not
do it, and if he did not like w hat he said
he could j:ot help it.
Senator Barrett then arose and joined
in the request for a committee of inves
tigation, giving fl. history of himself
that proved him (if correct) to be a state
credit man, and denouncing the charges
against him as baseless and malicious.
He called no nanus, and although he de
nounced the charges as slanderous and
malicious, he fell so far PelyW mith in
inyecliyo that it seeded tame. He said
he had been pursued as no other man in
the history of Tennessee had been

thought it necessary to go further into
the rrntter, he was willing to be tried
again.

retired to the very furthest part of the
chamber where walls shielded him from
behind, and he appeared restless and
watchful. Vertrees sauntered around
near him but seemed calm and only in
terested in tho discussion going on over
the resolution to investigate, but we im
agine he went around to measure the
man he intended to lay out. Trouble
was apprehended and policemen were
summoned and placed around the lobby,
but the senate adjourned and no difli-
culty occurred. Smith left the capitol
with Speaker Morgan and it is said he
eemcd ill at ease and looked carefully
about him as if fearing an attack. He
went to the Maxwell and eat down up
on the furthest single divan from the
entrance on tho left and was reading a
newspaper. Only a few people were in
tho rotunda. Directly Vertrees and a
younger brother entered at tho front
and passed through towaids tho closets
and had passed tho chair where Smith
was sitting, when tho younger one said,
"There ho is now." Vertrees at once
turned and went up to Smith, snatched
the paper down and spit in his face.
Smith jumped up and Vertrees says ran
his hand behind him, when Vertrees
drew a long and glittering Smith &
Wesson revolver and opened fire. Smith
ran around by the baggage elevator,
dodging by tho columns and into the
barber shop and thence into the cellar,
drawing his pistol after he got into the
barber shop. Vertices' first shot evi
dently missed Smith and knocked a hole
in the plastering, but two more shots
followed in rapid succession, one of
which entered the barber shop door fac

hurt and the ball was extracted later in
the day. The affair created enormous
excitement for some time. A turbulent
friend of Vertrees flourished his pistol
and kept the crowd bpek in a dramatic
anil threatening way for some time.
We heard the deed universally con
demned. It makes no difference w hether
Smith is guilty or not, so far as the
shooting is concerned. It is said "Ver

The second thought criticisms upon
the president's message all agree in
praising ifas a creditable, statesman
like document. The absence of refer
ence to the south as a distinct part
of tho union is commented upon favor
ably. It i3 the first time since the war
that the southern question did not enter
into a message as a distinct issue. In
deed, the abuse of the south was for
years the foundation stone of republi
canism and by it they were enabled to
hoodwink the north into an almost 60lid
opposition. The abandonment of that
idea is followed by the taking up ol an
other scheme upon which they hope to
thrive that is, the political dismember
ment ol the south by the Mahone pro
cess. The message does not refer to this
directly, of course, but the president
and the party have given themselves to
it. The message starts Mr. Arthur out
fairly, but we doubt very much, from
his former associations, whether he will

' The Harmony Question,
The American.!
We have devoted ourselves to some ex
tent to the arguments preseated by
those who would reach harmony at any
price from the standpoint of a desire for
such political combinations as may se
cure loaves and fishes at. any price. Our
conservative contemporary, ibe trv
laski Citizen, has recently furnished
us with the opportunity to view the same
subject from tho standpoint of a patri
otic desire to accomplish the best thing
for .he state and lor the democratic
party as au agency for good in the stato
and the nation. A warn of its earnest
devotion to principle and desire to d
vocate the best policy, we always differ
with our contemporary only alter aue
care and r flection.
Wo have failed to reach the same con
cision fro.n its premises. It declares
that it ha accepted the recent settle
ment and is able to see no reason why
it should not stand, beyond the division
it appears about to create in the party.
It declares its desire to preserve the
oartv intact even if it cost the re-open
ing of this questlop, thp setting aside
the settlement, aud leaving tho subject
for what the future may bring out of
un.'li Imrmrtiiv ns starts out with diS-(
carding what wo must regard an esen
tial principle. Examining the subject
first from tho standpoint of the present
and future intciests of thestate, it being
admitted by the Citizen that Its accept
ance destroys no right and involves no
sacrifice of principle, what will the s'ate
gain by abandoning th? settlement? It
will havo a question on its hands, pro
lific in direct corruption, fertile in pro
ducing speculation on both sides of It,
sure to lurtlier lower the tone of public
and p'ivata morals, leading to angry
passions and violence, vitiating the
principle Of private faith snd vegard for
obligations.
What will we gain in exchange?
Party harmony antidemocratic success?
Let us see. xnat state democracy wuicu
takes repudiation for its principle will
add no strength to national democracy
It will hang about the neck of the party
like the dead albatross upon the ancient
mariner. It wm corrupt and corrode,
and prevent that hold on' the conserva
tive intelligence pf the worth which can
only be won by pursuing the right to
defeat, if necessary, aud through defeat
to resurrection and final victory. But
of what kind will bo the harmony pro
duced? The party which broadens its
foundations to Jet i'u& worst etiind upon
them, mar (rain the worst, all of the
worst, if you will; it surely loses the
best. It surely gives the worst control
and installs the leaders ofthe worst as
its leaders. Which is the greatest pow
er, numbers or morals? How many
men who are wrong and standing ones
sentially false ideas, does oue man who
is right and based on the right, out
weigh? A party neglects this consid
eration at its peril.
If democracy determines to g in for
numbers, without regard to truth and
principles, we shal phcerfully and
without a moment's hesitation go with
what we regard as truth and principles,
and around that standard will gather,
as surely as there is truth and right,
the deserting numbers. We shall advo
cate such democracy as sacrifices a tem
porary and delusive harmony to truth
and right, and on that lir.3 win a future
triumph the tuoro thorough and lasting
that it has been so won.
We know ourcontemporary's patriot
ism too well to suspect its motives aud
we do" not doubt its courage, but we
think it has placed party above the in
terests of the state, and that it is a fatal
error. If democracy do not coincide
with the interests of the people, and
hence with the line of right, it will fail
if it start out with overwhelming num
bers. That such a compromise, such a
yielding, such a sacrifice, as will reopen
this question to serve as a shuttlelock
for aspiring lime servers, win not givo
numbers to such lemocracy as may pur
sue this line, we know already, n e un
derstand fully this tempest ia a teapot
raised by a few politicians here and
there. They have it almost entirely to
themselves.
Thero is but one way to deal with
this matter. Democracy must treat it
as settled; every interest demands it
Our contemporary admits that party
harmony alone demands another course
If that is true then surely party cannot
demand it. In any proper view of
party it must stand up only for what is
best for the state. Let it dare do other
wise and true democracy will not fail, or
die. Whether through defeat thus fool
islily forced by false measures of har
mony, or througli victory won before
a reasoning and intelligent people, it
will irrow the stronger lor standing and
combattinir 6uch democracy as dares
to yield essential principles for harmo

Journalists Passing Aray.
New Yerk Letter.
The death of Colonel Forney
brings home the fact that nearly all
the prominent journalists, who oc
cupied a leading position during
the civil war, are rapidly passing
away. There are Jew journals in
this city, numerous as they sre, that
are controlled by the same intellects
that were dominant then. Greeley,
Bryant, Brooks, liaymond and the
elder Bennett hare long since de
parted from the scene, and, though
their places are filled with younger
men of recognized ability, it is a
question whether they have that
commanding influence in the forma
tion or dire-tion of public opinion
which was wielded by their prede
cessors. Thurlow Weed and James
Watson Webb remain, but even
they anparenlly arc near their jour
ney's end. Mr. Forney frequently
was the zealous antagonist of more
than one of the old time journalists
above mentioned, and the conflicts
in which be has frequently engaged
with them, just after the breaking
out of the rebellion, were qf np ordi
nary bitterness, butat all times, and
under all circumstances, it is not
too much to say he was "a foemaji
worthy of their steel." Outside of
journalistic, literary and political
circles he had hosts Qt friends in
New York, and probably nowhere
will hie death be more widely or
more sincereiy regretted than here.

V.4!niNGT0N, Dec. 10. As stated in
list night's dispatches, it Is the inten
tion of tho administration to try and
break democratic rule in the southern
states, following up the success of the
movement in Virginia. As a confirma
tion of that statement, it may bo men
tioncd as a political fact that arrange
ments are now being made to wrest
Tennessee aud West Virginia from the
Democracy. The whole bent of tho
stalwart element of the republican party
and of the administration will be in that
direction. The cry has gone forth that
Tennesseo must be captured by the re
publicans, and every effort is being
made to Induce tho fulfillment of that
demand. The stalwart wing of the re-r
publican party is rallying to it; all that
the stalwarts and administration can do
to secure the overthrow of the democ
racv in Tennessee will be accomplished
.. . 1 1. - . 1 1 ..
WltllOUC scruple. it IS also a nunttimc
fact that the stalwarts are patting
Emory Sveer, of Georgia, on the baek,
and ur-rinsr him to become the Mahone
of Georffia. But it is to be placed to
fie credit of the political sagacity 01
the stalwarts and the administration
that they do not expect any immediate
Iruits from Georgia: theyoniy want
Mr. Spcer to inaugurate the endeavor.
Their tirst ob'eelive point is Tennessee,
and after that they propose to pounce
upon Arkansas; and then, if successful,
thev will devote themselves to other
states, being guided in their action by
the consideration as to where the chan
ces, carefully weighed, seem best.

Dr. McFarland, Lebanon, Tenn.,

J T.'i- 1 T ti.:
UUU1 lilbt, uv luui uunuci. xuia
stallion was owned for mauy years
by Maj. Allman, ol Corn ersville, and
was a stallion of considerable merit.
Competent iudsres say that the
most promising trotting colt in the
state is Elackthorjie, a three year-
old colt bv Blackwood, ir. out of
the dam of Largesse. Two of the
colts of this dam have sold for
$11,500, and Black thorne will
doubtless bell for a. large price
some day.
The great crack colts that Mr.
Swigert has bred have nearly al
ways been the victims of an unfor
tunate chain of circumstances. Yor
instance, to tak. the pases of Baden
Badeq, spendthrift and Hindoo. Ba
den Baden was beaten when it was
least expected by McWhirter;
Spendthrift bj' Falsetto and Hindoo
by Crickmore. It will also be re
membered that Mr. Swigert also
bred, Ivlngflaher, and sold him for
on immense price. Enquirer, how
ever, beat him badly at Saratoga
Baden Baden' was next beaten by
McWhirter, son of Enquirer, at
Louisville, for the Clark Stake3,
and Spendthrift vaa twice beaten
by Falsetto at Saratoga in 1879.
Taken all in all Enquirer is to
day the greatest sire Qf raoers. la the
United. States. For the last few
j'ears, it is true, that his colts have
not shown to much advantage. But
how was it in 1879? At Louisville
his sou Falsetto ran second to Lord
Murphy for the Kentucky Derby,
and won the Clark stakes in the
fastest time tLfc race was ever run,
we belieye. "Enquirer' daughter,
Fortuna, won the Louisville cup at
the samo meeting, aqd. BlwO Eyes,
his fcon, won the merchants' stakes
at the same place in 1 :551, as fast
time as this race has ever been run
in. Goodnight, another son, won
mile heats, at the same place in fast
time beating a CeM p,f goo4 aged
horses, while he was himself but
three years old. At St. Louis
Goodnight ran second to Lord Mur
phy for the January Btakes. At
Saratoga in the summer Falsetto
won the Travers and Kenner stakes,
beating the best colts in the east. A
match was arranged between the
owner of Eortuua - aud the owners
of Bramble for a. race at 2 miles,
and it ronulted in the easiest of vic
tories for Fortuna. In 1880 at
Chicago, Blue Eyes won the Gar
den City Cup at that place in 2:58 J,
bGating one of the btst fields that
ever started in America. The time
made in that : race has only been
beaten on one occasion by Spring
bok and Preakness, in a Jdead heat,
and only equalled I17 GJerhiore
this year, Iri l&Sl but few of his
colts have started In fact, but one
of them, Getaway, has been able to
win scarcely any money at all. This
colt, however, now has the best mile
and a quarter to. his credit ever run.
The reason why Enquirer's colts
have not appeared to move to ad
vantaga this year is due more to the
death of Col. Reynolds, the bank
ruptcy of Gen. Buford, and the lim
ited opportunities ot this stallion in
the stud for the past three j-eai s.
With the opportunities that will be
his at the Belle Meade farm Irom
this time on, it will be nothin
more than proper on the part of his
friends to expect to see liini stand
at the head of stallions as regards
tha amount of money won by their
colts, bfore many years.
