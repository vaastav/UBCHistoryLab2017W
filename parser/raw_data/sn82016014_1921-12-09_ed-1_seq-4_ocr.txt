revision of the revenue law. It may
be recalled that Senator Smoot, prior
to the passage of the recently enacted
revenue bill, predicted the enactment
of a ales tax law, "if not this year,
then next year." The fact that sev

fi W WILL FARMERS LEARN?
iS The willingness of employes in the
western shoe factories to take lower
wages is reported, with a result of
business activity ir this trade being
shifted from New England to the
west. This appears to be an Instance
where certain classes of wage earners
have been able to comprehend the
reasons for their unemployment, and
have taken a direc step for the re
covery of the business which would
help their jobs. If this vision of the
actual situation could impress Itself
upon all labor, the conditions in this
cnuntry, and In fact thruout the
world, Y-ould change promptly for the
better.
Just as soon as labor everywhere
roaches this common ground of un
derstanding and agrees to greater ef
ficiency at reduced wages, which
means larger production at lower
costs, the whole industrial machine
will spring into normal activity.
The farmer's present condition of
price-deflation but not of debt-deflation
also has its direct bearing on the
prosperity of the entire country.
After all, the farmer represents the
greatest single buying class In the
United States; virtually half the con
suming power of the country rests on
him. The farmer is postponing pur
chases now, not because of anyftvil
ful refusal to buy, but because of his
limited financial ability, due partly to
his wilful refusal to sell at high prices
when he had the opportunity. The
story is told of a Missouri farmer who
said a few days ago: "I priced a hat
for myself and it was $7.50. That
meant 37 bushels of corn, a full
wagon load. The hat I have on cost
me four bushels.- It will have to last
thru the. winter." ,
The farmer, rebelling against con
ditions, has allowed himself to be mis
led by the politicians, and instead of
getting his representatives to under
take some reform which will benefit
him, has been led in exactly the op
posite direction. Freight rates add to
the cost of manufacture, and so also
do taxes. Freight costs will be re
duced by drastic reduction in the cost
of railway labor. Wages and rates
should,, of course, be considered to
gether. Tho tax costs of the country are
most heavily borne by business, nc-t
tlons in the tilts which it absorbs.
but In the restriction in the use of
capital which heavy surtaxes impose.
Capital will not take business chances
of loss which It has to bear alone,
when a huge percentage of profit is
forfeited to the government.
The cost of doing business, includ
ing heavy taxes, is added to the cost
of things which the farmer buys, and
provisions for a low percentage tax,
widely distributed, would materially
reduce the prices of such things. And
yet the farmers' representatives stand
for keeping taxes high, and by con
trolling the vote the agricultural bloc
has been instrumental in defeating
real tax reform, with the result that
the present law is as bad for the
farmers as for every other individual
in the country, whether he pays taxes
or not.
Howat and his followers now are
between two fires. On one side are
the courts and on the other is the na
tional organization of miners. Tho
national executive board dealt the
outlaws the most severe blow they yet
have received when it ordered the Il
linois officers to stop collecting dues
to pay benefits to the strikers. When
their pay stops most of the fight will
be taken out of the strike leaders.
Deprived of leadership the miners
probably will return to work.
HENRY FORD'S RAILROAD.
Walker I. Hines, former director
general of railroads, and at one time
chairman of the board of the Santa
Fe railroad, says that it is contrary
to the public Interest for a large ship
per like Henry Ford to own and oper
ate a railroad by means of' which he
has a powerful leverage for obtaining
special consideration from the corn
men carriers of the country.
"But as long as this is permitted by
law," he says in the December Na
tion's Business, "we can at least con
gratulate ourselves that the D. T. & I.
railroad is in the hands of a genius,
who is willing to turn his railroad
into a laboratory for the making of
experiments which his resourcefulness
suggests. I shall be surprised if some
of the experiments do not turn out to
be valuable from the standpoint of
railroad companies in general."
After Ford took over the ownership
and management of the Detroit, To
ledo & Ironton railroad and switched
the traffic of his large Industry to
that lne, much was made of his abil
ity to reduce expenses and increase
traffic Income. The inference was
drawn that any other road. If man
aged by Ford or in the manner in
which he managed his road, could do
as well. Development of facts, it
seems, shows that Ford's management
of the road was not such as could be
adopted by all roads. In the first
place, owners of other roads did not
own large manufacturing plants
whose purchases of raw material! and
sales of manufactured goods coufd be
diverted to their own lines. More
over, Ford used the leverage of his
own shippin; business to Induce other
roads to favor his In routing ship
ments. This, obviously, could not be
done generally.
But ther is an equally important
disclosure in connection with the
working rules which other roads were
compelled to observe but from which
Ford's road was free. Under the na
tional agreements adopted under the
McAdoo regime, each class of work
must be dona by an employe who be
longed to a union of that class.
However capable a man might be of
doing the work, h i would not be per
mitted to do it if it belonged to some
other class of employes. Further
more, thnre was an understanding as
to the number of men who must be
assigned to certain work, with the re
sult that often men were standing
idle for no useful purpose. The roads
were required to pay the men for
checking in and out as they went to
and from their work.
These rules. It appears, did not ap
ply on Ford's road. If anything went
wrong with an engine, the engineer
or fireman fixed it if he could. The
fireman would get down and turn a
switch if no switchman were handy,
and would fix the switch if it got out
of order. While the men are on duty
on the Ford road, they put in their
time doing anything that needs to be
done and which they are capable of
doing. The station agent is permitted
to do odd jobs of carpentering around
the building, or paint it.
The railroad labor board has abro
gated many of the senseless and
wasteful rules adopted by the Mc
Adoo period of management, and,
presumably, the roads and the public
are to bo relieved of burdens which
did nobody good. Mr. Ford's road
will still have the advantage of pri
a'ely controlled traffic, but It will
not have so large an advantage in ,
working conditions.
The action of the railroads In re
ducing passenger rates for the holi
days is not entitled to be construed
Into a Christmas gift to the public.
It is In fact a recognition of the prin
ciple that a big business at a small
profit is better than a small business
at a big profit. Railroad passenger
business has suffered greatly from ex
cessive rates. The lower tariffs of
fered doubtless will bring some of the
Idle rolling stock into use.
The advance In the price of liberty
bonds is attributed by the Wall Street
Journal to heavy purchases made by
the banks. It appears that the bank
ers foresaw a reduction in interest
rates and hastened to put their money
into securities the interest rate on
which promised to be-permanent. If
anybody have a better explanation let
him bring it forward.
International
Sunday School Lesson
BI WTLIilAM T. EXIJS.
For December 11 Is, "Paul Writes to a
Friend" Philemon 1:1-25.
Bedrock on the Social Iroblcm.
Like a long arm reached out to all
the world, thrusting vast problems
under tho eyes of every nation, the
Washington conference on limitation
of armament and problems of the
Pacific has aroused peoples every
where to the gravity and the acuteness
of certain great issues. The vast con
cerns of peace and right and fraternity
have had first-page position in the
press of the whole earth. The educa
tional value of this wide-spread pre
sentation, and consequent discussion
of vkal themes is one of the ways in
which democracy works out its will.
Now into the thick of this interest,
with that timeliness which seems
nothing less than providential, Is pro
jected this Sunday school lesson which
many millions will study. The text is
one of the shortest books of the BJble,
the letter to Philemon, a wealthy
Christian of Colossae, written by Paul,
from his prison in Rome, and sent by
the hand of Onesimus, a runaway slave
belonging to Philemon, who had be
come a Christian under the apostle's
teaching.
In this brief persona.1 epist'e of six
hfindred words, so tender and inti
mate, that it has often been called
Paul's love letter, we find combined
an industrial problem, a social problem,
a criminal problem, an ethical problem
and a religious problem and a solu
tion for them all.
The Runaway's Romance.
No cold blooded, impersonal, theo
logian was this veteran preacher,
traveler, statesman, the apostle Paul,
whom we here find a prisoner In
Rome. As an oriental wine-skin drips
good wine wherever it is pricked, so
the life of Paul, wherever touched,
bleeds rich, red, human interest. How
full of personal greetings are even his
most philosophical writings. We know
that nothing could ever keep him
from his life work of presenting Jesus
Christ to people. So we are scarcely
surprised to lerirn, that along with the
soldiers and other persons who found
their way to the prisoner's presence to
talk over the new faith, there was a
runaway slave from Colossae named
Onesimus a word that means "help
ful" or "profitable," and one upon
which a pun is made in the letter be
fore us.
Rome, with its unspeakable slums,
was the haven of the runaway slaves
of an empire. The larger part of the
city's population was made up of these
miserable creatures. Young and ad
venturous Onesimus got to Rome, and
probably encountered hard times.' In
some way he learned of the famous
Christian preacher, Paul, as a prisoner
in the city. He recalled him as a be
loved and honored guest in the home
of his master, Philemon, the Christian,
of Colossae. Any face associated with
home would be dear to the suffering
exile, and so the runaway sought for
Paul, and found him a friend and a
father, and under bis gentle guidance
became himself a Christian, a member
of the same household of faith as hi
master.
That big fact settled several prob
lems indeed, conversion to Christianity
is the great settler of all problems.
Now that he had become a Christian,
Onesimus was obliged to do what was
right. By the laws of the time, and
by the prevailing ethics, he belonged
to Philemon, and must return. Right
eousness is always retroactive, and
calls for restitution. True the slave
was useful to Paul and he belonged
to the new brotherhood; but still,
right was right, and he" could never
have peace or joy in his religion until
he had returned to his legal master.
Back to 'Bondage.
Like a faded letter found In an attic
trunk, that gleams and glows with all
the fire of a living passion so this little
epistle of Paul to Philemon seems
still to throb with the pulsation of
warm blood from a beating heart.
He loved Onesimus. for the young
man, in gratitude and affection, lav
ished service and loyalty upon the
lonely old prisoner. He also loved
Philemon, the spendid Christian gen
tleman, memory of whose hospitality
brightened the darkness of the Roman
imprisonment:. He also loved Christ
supremely, and he wanted to heed the
claims of all three loves.
So, in phrases that stiil repeat them
selves, in the letters of friends to
friends, Paul sent Onesimus back to
Philemon "No longer as a slave, but
more than a slave, a brother beloved."
He did not deny the master's right to
own the slave; but like his Master,
who put himself in the sinner's place, 1
Paul could write, "If then thou count
est me a partner, receive him as my
self. But if he hath wronged thee
at all, or owest thee aught, put that
to mine account." j
It would be less fair to forget that,
even in the days of American slavery,
masters and slaves were often both .
Christians, dwelling together In mu
tual affection. Onesimus was going!
back to bondage tho the system of;
slavery received its death knell with
the coming of the gospel of liberty
but Paul's reasoning was that this re
lationship between owner and slave
was to be transformed by the higher
relationship of both to their mutual
Master, Christ. A bad system op
erated in a Christian spirit, may pro
duce better results than an ideal sys
tem operated by un-Christlan motives.
"The will to peace" means more than
the enactments of an international ;
conference. i
Down to Bed Rock. j
In the heart-beats of this brief let
ter from an aged prisoner to a die-!
tant friend concerning a runaway i
slave whom a Roman gentleman
would ordinarily scarcely have deigned
to notice we may hear the music of
the new era when our social and in
dustrial and political problems will
have been solved. For Paul's thesis
is that loyalty to a common Christ
supersedes all lesser relationships and
obligations. When two persons, both
sincerely want to do the will of Jesus
there will be no clash between them
on' account of class or social distinc
tions. The world is going to find
stability at bed rock only by accept
ing as supreme the will of the Lord.
The longer I observe life the more
deeply am I impressed with the com
prehensive practicability of the Chris
tian Endeavor pledge, "Trusting in the
Lord Jesus Christ for strength, I
promise Him that I will strive to do
whatever He would like to have me
do."
We may be sure that the relations
between Philemon and Onesimus were
solved by the consistent application
of this higher law, the will of God.
That is the only law that will settle
our present world problems. The
diplomats seem not to know It tho
millions of common folk do but the
clear and simple way out of the
tangled jungle of our times Is that of
loyalty to a Master who loves all ana
would have all live together in com
mon welfare and oeace.

OCE LITTLK HOU6S.
I'd like to have them think of me
Ab one with whom they liked to be;
I'd like to make my home so fair
That they would all be happy there.
To have them think, when life is done,
That here they had their finest fun.
Within. these walla with love aglow,
They live tomorrow's "Long Ago."
Nor is the time so far away
When now Bhall be their yesterday.
And thnv shall turn pnee more to see
The little home which used to be.
When comes that time I want them then
To wish they could be here again,
I want their memories to be
A picture of a kindly m.
To have them Bay how very glad
Their youthful lives were made by dad.
I want them to recall this place
As one of charm and tender grace.
To love these walls of calm content
Wherein their youthful years were spent,
A feel thru each succeeding year.
They lived their happiest moments here.
I feel I shall have failed unless
This house Bhall shelter happiness.
Save they shall find their truest mirth
Around their father's humble hearth.
And here life's finest joys attain,
I shall have lived mv life in vain.

Dorothy Dix Talks

Worli'a Highest Paid tTonu Writer.
Why They Do It 1.
At a recent luncheon given to a
bride-to-be each of the women present
was invited to tell why she married
the man she did, or why she wished
to get married, or why Bhe married
the second time, according to whether
she had tie husband, or had had two
husbands, or was looking for a hus
band. If the ladies told the truth, and
really got down to brass tacks about
their individual cases, it must have
been a most interesting: experience
meeting, particularly as regarded the
matrimonial repeater.
The question: "Why did I marry
the man I did?" is one that every wo
man asks herself with varying inflec
tions, and to which she gives a dif
ferent answer according to the state
of the matrimonial barometer. When
the weather is fair and sunny, and
hubby is wafting hot air in her direc
tion she is sure she married him be
cause he was the Only Alan in the
world for her.
But when the domestic skies' are
lowering, when husband growls over
ths bills, and is disgruntled, and un
reasonable, she opines tthat the only
explanation for her having married
that particular man was because the
fool killer was loafing on the job, and
not attending to business the day she
two-stepped with him to the altar.
Why anybody marries anybody else
is a conundrum that keeps everybody
guessing, as you may learn by attend
ing any wedding. The strains of the
bridal march are never quite loud
enough to drown out the chorus that
swells from every throat of: "For
pity's sake! Is that the bridegroom?
What in the name of heaven do you
suppose she ever saw In him to make
her want to marry him? Looks like
a scared rabbit trying to swallow his
Adam's apple, while he steps on his
own feet. I know men are scarce, but
it does seem as if she could have shut
her eyes, and run her hand in the
grab-bag and pulled out something
else than that!" - ,
"And what do you suppose made
him pick out Mabel for a wife? My
dea,r, she is three years older than he
is, and she is that made up I bet she
wouldn't recognize her own face if she
saw it in a mirror after it was washed
clean. Worse still she is one of the
vivacious kind that would give me
nervous prostration in two days,
imagine having to listen to her eiesle.
and exclaim, and have hysterics, and
wonder, and joy, and delight for the
balance of your life! Funny how
people mary, isn't it? Wonder what
makes them choose each other out
of a whole world full of people that
look as if they would have suited them
so much better."
And the answer is:- "Search me."
The question, Why do women marrv
a second time? was cynically answered
a long time ago by Ioctor Johnson
who said that a second marriage was
the ultimate triumph of hope over
experience.

A. R. W.
We had despaired of getting a rise
out of the "Hahvahd "old grads," but
Beekman Morris finally has obliged.
Writing in the Harvard Alumni Bui
letin in reference to certain observa
tions that have appeared herein, he
says: "I believe this oreamic manl
Testation too largely typical of anti-
Harvard sentiment latent in many lo
calities. Anti-Harvard is the only way
to refer to this sort of thing, which is
hardly predicated on sportsmanship,
breeding or fair-mindedness, or worth
the attention which honest criticism
commands, whether made by gentle
men or others." Further along Mr.
Morris observes that he doesn't care
what "any of the self-enlisted Harvard
haters say, think or do.
A time ago, when we were "kid
ding" Harvard and Yale about their
respective football schedules, we had
occasion to discuss the matter with a
Harvard man. "You may be able,
he saidV "to sting the Yale 'old grads'
to acerbetic retort, but no Harvard
man will fall for it. They're too
smart." We shall now proceed to col
lect the small wager made at the mo
ment the matter was in controversy.
To us, the curious tiling about a
Harvard man :s his belief that there
are "Harvard haters" and "anti-Har
vard sentiment latent in many locali'
ties." Why, we pause to inquire; why
the self-consciousness? We came out
of the corn lands, where a Harvard
man is a good deal of a curiosity, but
we never knew a 'Harvard hater" or
one who entertained latent sentiment
antipathetic to that university. In
1894 we assisted, up to our capacity
to do so in the etection of a Harvard
man as district attorney of Marianna
county. Later, we occupied, for eight
een years, a stall adjacent to the one
in which a Harvard man did his
browsing. We rubbed elbows with
him every day and found him entirely
human.
As becomes one whose "prep" school
was a potato patch and whose alma
mater was a cornfield, we have no
prejudice against any university. But
it is rather pleasant to De in position
where one Is not compelled, or ex
pected, to kiss any of them.
He's Doing It," Too.
Sir Your latest defi relative to your
apparent susceptibility on the proposi
tion offered by the Macksville Enter
prise intrigues me.
Some time ago I suggested an easy
way out by laying claim to Edward
Bok's offer of a cash gratuity to the
person doing the greatest service to
Philadelphia. I offered the subtle sug
gestion that you quit your job, an 1
thus automatically become the re
cipient of Mr. Bok's generosity.
I do not know if this Macksville
Enterprise thing is a creature of your
imagination, but if I were you I would
not spurn the offer. If you gain a
vote of confidence after your defi.
then Barnum sure did under-estimate
the crop.
Are you under any obligation to Cul
len Cain that you grant him free ad
vertising space, or is it just a "brother
act" to "kid" the boss?
And, by the way. did you mean it
when you proclaimed "1 f Winter
Comes" the best book of tbe year, or
was that another one of your "jokes"?
You'll remember me. J. R. I.
Of course, we remember J. R. I.
He is the chappie who wanted Hon.
Dempsey to stop his training lon
enough to 'come up from Atlantic City
and slap the column's face off. When
we suggested that J. R. I. substitute
for Hon. Dempsey, he declined the
commission. Of course, we remember
him. As for the balance of it. we
hope we shall always be found boost
ing for gentlemen who are as sane,
clean, straightforward, kindly and
courteous as Cullen Cain.
However. J. R. I. would miss the
column more than he thinks. One
who peruses it so closely and per
sistently that he recalls paragraphs
which appeared herein months ago is
in no position to give the column up.
We have no opinion as to the Hon.
Ruth's place in the firmament of
vaudeville. It is all right with us if
he knocks em dead. But if he 13
knocking 'em dead, why the herculean
effort to make it appear that he is
doing so?
As we have indicated, 'we haven't
seen the Hon. Ruth's act. That is

FOOD.
All life is dominated by the sur
vival instinct to get air, water, food,
and as great a measure of happiness
as possible.
Beyond the survival stage, however,
one is led or thrown into a devious
complexity of interests, circumstances
and problems.
In a way, everything" we take into
our existence or which affects our
bodies or our minds, is a food help
ful and nourishing, or else in one way
or another harmful and destructive.
When the salesman sells an auto
mobile, he tells the customer to drive
his car carefully and slowly for the
first few hundreds of miles. He ex
plains that the engine is 'stiff and
must not be over-worked that if it is
treated with consideration at the start,
the owner wiil be amply repaid by a
fine running: engine therearter.
The one who over-eats, strains his
bodilv engine. 3 If you worry, you tll-
minisn your prruiiiii iftjr-i.
Kood is to increase power and to
give very faculty and organ Its full
efficiency.
But everything about us must co
ordinate. Our minds must grasp
hands with our bodies. Thought can
not travel thru clogged brain cells,
nor expand and enlarge the scape of
the body if the body's wonderful parts
fail to respond to direction and lead
ership. Food is dominant whether it be
for the body or the mina.
And we need such an infinite va
riety for all that we want to be and
become! v
Art, music, literature, science, play,
work these are all foods essential
and necessary for a healthy and happy
existence.
Then why starve or grow weak in
possibilities when there is so much
from which you may draw?
Search for those things which build
and strengthen you most and stick
to them!

JOAN SELLS A STORY AN D COOKS
A MEAL.
CHAPTER S3.
Xow occasionally Margaret would
help Joan. &he was most critical of
her daughter's efforts, a fact that Joan
hailed with delight.
"I don't want you to tell me it's
good If it isn't, Mumsie!" she often de
clared. And Margaret respected her
all the more for her attitude. Indeed
Joan's manner commenced to undergo
a change. To Margaret's delight, Joan
treated her more as she did Martha
Handy and the girls who dropped in.
"You may stay and have luncheon
with me if you want to," she remarked
one day after Margaret had corrected
quite a pile of manuscript for her.
think you have earned something to
eat," and she brought out her chafing
dish, some eggs, some bread and but
ter. The eggs, scrambled, toast and
tea comprised the luncheon.
"Haven't you any sweets ?" Mar
garet, knowing her fondness for them,
asked.
"No, can't afford them! Not
healthy anyway," Joan replied, her
mouth full
"Won't you let me bring a jar of
Hannah s strawberry jam?4'
"Yes, you may if you like. I'm not
averse to an occasional present, Mum
sie. But I must not be a parasite be
cause I work. And Mumsie, look at
that!" she handed her mother a check
from a prominent and popular maga
zine. "That's why I told you I would
take the jam. I can buy jam now, so
I can afford to take it as a. gift.
"A hundred dollars!" Margaret ex
claimed in surprise.
"Yes, Mumsie, and a request for
more work, other articles. That is the
one you helped me with. I guess it
was a bit on account of your help
that it was accepted. I have all the
ambition in the world to write, but I
hte like thunder to read the stuff over
and correct it."
"I'll do it for you, dear, if you'll let
me.
"Let you! Why I'll pay you t do
it."
"These eggs are delicious, Joan.
However did you learn to do them "
"Common sense and several messes
wasted before I acquired the common
sense. Oh, I never was cut out for a
cook, but I'm going to do It until I
earn enough to hire one, which will
prabably be when I am old and gray.
"Not if you keep on at this rate.'
Margaret loked again at the check. "It
is wonderful, dear a hundred dol
lars!"
"It Is a great and glorious feeling
Mumsie, to earn money. I don't mean
because of the money, but because it
makes you feel so sort of proud of
yourself. I don t care a whoop for tho
money- I mean I wouldn't if I hadn't
to pay rent and eat; but I do care that
I earn it -that I have proved to my
self I was capable of doing something
oeside spend it.
"Thank you for my luncheon, dear.
It was very nice. 111 be down again in
a day or two. If you have anythirt?
ready oeiore, call me up. , I am de
lighted to help."
"Good old Mumsie," Joan kissed
her fondly.
"Good old Mumsie!" she repeated
after the door closed.
"I have an idea that this work of
Joan s is going to make us better
friends than anything else could have
done" Margaret told Craig Forrester.
"Shi is willing that I shall help her,
and that is a wonderful concession for
her."
"I don't see it that wav. Ton can
helpme by marrying me any-time you
"She received a check for tlOO this
morning for ar. article. Think of it,
Craig, that child earning S100. T nrr-!
so proud of her. aren't you?"
"Of course I am. I expect to be her
step-father, you know."
Ana she cooked mv luncheon an
it was lovely, and she says she loves
to have me help correct her manu
script, and oh, I am so happy over
her that things have turned out so
well!"
"She can't livefcrever on $100."
"Don't be a kill-lov. Thi nrtioi
she is doing is even better than the
one she sold, and that editor asked
ror more. bti will succeed nil richt
Of course it will take time, but I was
so afraid she would fail and be dis
couraged, yet still keep at it like thos
people down in the village do so
many of them, always hoping to do
something worth while, but never do
ing it."
"I wonder what she miirht sav if t
asked her if 1 might marry you?"
"Don't you dare, Craig Forester! If
you upset that girl now I'll never
marry you, never:"
"The apple cart shall remain riirht

HEART ANO HOME PROBLEMS

. Dea'r Mrs. Thompson: I am a girl
of 17 and have been going with a fel
low of 24. I love him dearly and he
loves me, but my folks do not want
me to go with him. . Now I am going
with a fellow of 17 and my folks seem
to like him very much, but I don't
like him as well as I do the other fel

go with him. What shall I do?
WORBIEDNESS.
You" are so young that I would ad
vise you to rely upon the judgmenfof
your parents. They do not want you
to go with the older young man be
cause they are afra'd you will care
too much for him and it will deprive
you of the variety of friends which
are your due at the age of 17. I
would suggest that you go with both
boys as friends if your parents are
willing.

Spider's Webs.

MITCHELL.
"The thing I like about Marie," said
I)ick as he hitched his chair closer to
the fireplace, "i"s that she Is so do
mestic." Louise made no reply. She glanced
sharply at her fiance's back and then
shrugged her shoulders slightly.
"Xou know, I met her about two
years ago at one of the club dances."
Dick continued; "let's see, why, that
was before we were engaged, wasn't
it?"
Louise was silent.
"Yes, sure it was," he went on.
"And I went to call on her one eve
ning. You see," he laughed, turning
around in his chair so that he might
look at her rather than the leaping
flames in the fireplace. "I want to
make sure it was really before yod
and I were engaged, or else you'll be
jealous."
Louise, too, 'laughed, but there was
no large amount of mirth in the tones.
"And I remember just as well the
little , iece of fancy work that she was
doiNg," Dick said. "It was a tidy or
or doily that she was sewing on,
and it had a lot of spiders and spi
ders' webs on it."
"Maybe they were symbolical," said
Louise's brother with a one-sided
grin. "I used to go with Marie, you
know."
Dick looked his disgust. "And
then," he continued, "I never saw her
again, for I went to Montreal and
when I came back she had gone to
California. I thought of her a lot of
times. I think a domestic girl ia the
prettiest sight on earth one who
sews or embroiders or something like
that." He was quiet for a few mo
ments. "You do you never sew,
Louise?" '
"Yes, but not when any one's here,"
she said succinctly.
"Do you like to sew?" he probed.
"Well, no," Louise answered truth
fully, "you see, I think that fancy
work, as a general thing, is rather
hard on the eyes, considering the re
sult. I never make lace or do any
thing in crochet work because it is
such close work, but as for sewing
well, I do make things. Can't say 1
love it, but you see," she laughed a
little, "it has to be done and so I
do it."
"Well." said Dick, "I must run
along. I have a wiring contract to
morrow that has to have an estimate
and I'm going out to do it myself. It's
out on Hyde Park boulevard."
"That's where Marie lives now
with her uncle," said Louise, "maybe
you'll see her."
. She did not know whether or not
her fance heard her, for he had taken
his hat and coat and was already part
way down the front steps.
The next day Dick Felton walked
thru the snow to the house on the
boulevard. It was a bitterly cold day
and he thought affectionately of the
evening when he could draw up to
the blazing fire in Louise's living
room. After all, Louise was a wonder
ful girl, he reflected, if only she liked
home-making better. She never had
a bit of white, sewing in her hands,
and to Dick there was something in
finitely attractive in a girl before a
fireplace with a bit of sewing.
He stamped up the stone steps of
the large house and after leaving the
lower floor until last, went rapidly
thru the upper rooms with the house
keeper, who indicated the changes to
be made in the wiring system. She
knocked decorously at each door be
fore entering. Dick smiled a little at
her evident awe of the family who oc
cupied this grand house, "or, after
all, he thought, they were probably
much the same as other people with
the same ideals, the same aspirations
and the same disappointments. . The
only thing which apparently troubled
them not at all was money, for the
house and its furnishings gave evi
dence of vast sums spent.
As he examined a table lamp In
one of the second floor rooms hs
coat, which was over his arm, acci
dentally knocked to the floor a very
elaborate w-ork basket, tumbling out
a number of spools of brlgntly col
ored silks and some fancy work.
Stoopinp, he picked it up, thinking
how pretty the bright colors looked
and wondering a little what the fin
ished resuit would look like. The
material had fallen so that the
stamped pattern of blue was clearly
visible.
Jt was spiders and spider webs.
He flushed a litjle as he recalled
the conversation of the night before.
He hoped that he hadn t hurt Louise
by his talking on about MarleVAt this
moment the door opened and a maid
with a perky cap hurried into the
room.
"Mrs. Dobbins." she said to the
housekeeper, "give me Miss Marie's
sewing basket, quick. Griirgs has just
announced company she'll wear that

paused, clapping her fingers over ner
lips as riei rose to his feet witll
another of the gayly colored spools.
"I'm going down and I'll take it to
Miss. Marie myself." he said suddenly.
-"You see, I know her remembered
her fancy-work, in fact."
A half hour later Louise in a shell
pink frock opened the front door.
"Louise." said Dick breathlessly.
"What do you suppose? That littie
piece of fancy-work that Marie eews
on is all sham and pretense. She's
working on the same piece now when
company comes that she was when I
went to call on her two years ago.
She might at least Irave sense enough
to change the piece. What do you
think of that?"
Louise laughed and drew back s
he tried to take her hands. "Don't
touch me, Dick." she said. "I I
wasn't expecting any one and I'm all
floury. Making doughnuts for to
night," she said with a blush.
"Do you mean to say that you bake
those delicious doughnuts that we have
so often?" he demanded.
"Why, of course."

he saw the sewing machine open and
piled with white cloth. (
"I'm making some house aprons."
she said, "and I sewed a while when

"And you never told me that yon

"After we're married," he flnlsheil

Hut Louise only smiled.

And we started to wawk to the pni-k
and Bert started to wawk with us and
we kepp telling him the most insult
ing things about himself we could
think of to keep him from injoyin-?

Wich he did enyways.
