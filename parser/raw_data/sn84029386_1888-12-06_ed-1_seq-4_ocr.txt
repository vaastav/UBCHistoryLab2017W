Here is a chance to buy Dry G-oods at prices which startle even the purchaser. When
we cut prices we sell, not at cost, but way below cost. We believe in this course, as the
goods are cleared out at once and room made for new stock. Come and examine our goods
and carry away something that you want at these tempting prices.

To Our Headers.
For several weeks, as our subscribers
are well aware, we have given the
readers of the Weekly Kefdector
but a scant amount of reading matter,
owiDg to the advertising pressure upon
our columns. In order to better ac
commodate our readers we commence
this week the regular issuing of a two
page supplement, containing fourteen
columns of reading matter. This
makes the Weekly Reflector with
its ten 7-column pages, 70 columns in
all, the largest weekly ever issued in
Dickinson county.
It is only by reason of the unexam
pled patronage accorded us that we are
able to give this immense amount of
reading for $1.50 per year. But our
circulation, which is larger than that
of any two papers in the county com
bined, and our exceptional advertising
patronage makes the additional outlay
warrantable.
Even with this addition to our space
we are compelled this week to send out
another supplement to accommodate
advertisers.
Subscribers to the Weekly Ee-
flectob, the largest and beat weekly
west of Topeka, who pay for one year
in advance will have their subscriptions
dated January 1st, 1889, and receive
the DaDer from now until January 1st
free.
The President's Message.
The President's message is before us.
If we should say we had read the
lengthy document it would tax the
credulity of our readers. If Mr. Cleve
land has not complied with all the
requirements of the statutes in such
cases made and provided it was not for
the want of space. He thinks of lots
more to talk about now than he did a
year ago.. If a multiplicity of words,
embracing a paucity of ideas indicates
progress, then Mr. Cleveland has ad
vanced since he wrote his free-trade
message in 1887. It would be scarcely
possible for a president, however much
of a mediocre, to write a message as
long as the one before us which should
be wholly destitute of information.
We have tried to separate the mes
sage from the writer of it, and if possi
ble judge of its merits from what it
really contains. But it is to no purpose.
The personnel of the President is so
intimately impressed upon every origi
nal sentence that it is impossible to
read the message without seeing its
author, and all the peculiarities of the
man are before our eyes.
Laying aside the disposition of the
President to emphasize the fact that
Grover Cleveland is President of the
United States of North America, the
message is thoroughly impregnant with
what is known in psychological par
lance as "sour grapes."
There is nothing good, but every
thing evil in the government. It is
sinking into the vortex of ruin withl
remarkable velocity.
'A century has passed. Our cities
are the abiding places of wealth and
luxury; our manufactures yield for
tunes never dreamed of by the fathers
of the Republic; our business men are
madly striving in the race for riches;
and immense aggregations of capital
outrun the imagination in the magni
tude of their undertakings."
He views with pride and satisfaction
the bright picture of our country's
growth and prosperity in the past while
only a closer scrutiny at the present
develops a sombre shading, He sees
the "health of the body politic" ruined
and "selfish greed and avarice" take
the place of "patriotic love of country."
"Devotion of American citizenship
for its own sake and for what it should
accomplish as a motive to our Nation's
advancement and the happiness of all
our people is displaced by the assump
tion that the government, instead of
being the embodiment of equality,-is
but an instrumentality through which
especial and individual advantages are
to be gained".

condition of affairs & evidently the
outgrowth of bitter disapp"?11111611

The President touches upon all ques
tions likely to require the attention of
Congress and he gives a great deal of
valuable information ancUusefnl sug
gestion which should be received and
acted upon. Inasmuch as this is the
last message, the valedictory as it were,
of the great Democratic exhibition, it
answers its purpose and it will go down
in history as a fair expression of that
party's opinion of itself and its ability
to control the government in a manner
satisfactory to the people.
Nearly 8500,000 will be laid out in
rebuilding Fort Eiley. It will be one
of the finest reservations in the
Nation when completed.
President Cleveland should have
confined his message to a plain state
ment of the condition of the Govern
ment in the past and present. The
people have just decided that they do
not go much on him or his party so far
as the future is concerned.
What with the Galloway circular and
the blizzard-manufacturing correspon
dents of eastern journals poor Kansas
has a heavy load to carry.
Mrs. Emma Malloy is in Kansas
again. Say, Emma, you needn't come
any further in this direction. Just
"Whoa Emma!" as it were.
The press of the Nation, irrespective
of politics, agrees in one important par
ticular regarding the message that it
is unconscionably long and dreary.
The Kepublicans, being practically
sure of the House, have a great re
sponsibility on their hands during the
coming years. They have to shape the
course of legislation and to do this in
the face of the fact that it is always
easier to sit back and find fault than
to carry on the battle will be no easy
task.
that everyone has a hand in it. A ster
ling character one who speaks for
himself and speaks what he thinks is
sure to have bitter enemies and warm
friends; both are as necessary to him
as fresh air; they keep him alive and
active.
Mr. Cleveland in his message refers
to the Sackville West matter as follows:
"Near the close of October last occur
rences of a deeply regrettable nature
were brought to my knowledge," etc.
We don't doubt that the circumstance
was "deeply regrettable" to Mr. Cleve
land as it was one of the chief causes
of his overwhelming defeat.
The reports of the various Cabinet
officers ought to be valuable articles.
They have had excellent opportunities
to learn something in the past three
months.
Old General Eice, of Ft. Scott, wants
an omce. The many friends of the
doughty old veteran will be glad to see
him have it so far as he is concerned
personally.
"Tacky" is the latest slang. It
means something which is ill-arranged,
unbecoming or in bad taste. A would-
be dude with too little sense to be dud-
ish is "tacky." See?
The Mormons are said to be getting
numerous in Canada. This makes the
outlook for annexation rather bright
than otherwise. Getting annexed is
the Mormons' favorite amusement.
Physicians say that gum chewing "de-

drains the glands of moisture and

"No condition in life shall give riBB
to discrimination in the treatment of
the people by their government" says
the President. Had this patriotic in
junction controlled the acts of the
Democratic party there would have
been no President Cleveland. The
basest kind of "discrimination in the
treatment of the people" of the
South made his elevation to the
Presidency four years ago a possibility.
The Charleston News and Courier
mournfully confesses that there was
too much South in Mr. Cleveland's
administration. Not more than the
South was entitled to from its political
strength in the Democratic party and
the electoral college, but decidedly
more than the North was prepared to
stomach. We are glad that this belated
confession is made by so influential an
organ of southern opinion. There has
been too much South in Democratic
legislation and administration. The
Mills bill was a sectional measure.
The Democratic party during the last
four years has been led by the Solid

The above figures show that the Pro
hibition party reached its greatest
strength m 1886 and that it has so rap
idly declined since that time that the
column of losses from that year is
nearly as formidable as the column
which represents the vote of 1888.
In a few States the Prohibitionists
have made apparent gains, but as these
are based upon their estimates rather
than the official returns, it is not
worth while to give them.
The above facts show that the Prohi
bition party is the strongest in off
years when State issues are most
prominent. That is, the prohibition
element is.stronger as a State than as a
Natior al party. Leavenworth Times.

Philadelphia Kecord : In a total rote
of nearly one million in Pennsylvania
the Prohibitionists polled a little more
than 20,000. Tet it is proposed, in be
half of this small number of voters, to
subject the State of Pennsylvania to a
contest over a prohibitory amendment
to the constitution. The Prohibition
ists ought to be able to muster at least
one-tenth of the voters of Pennsylvania
before demanding submission of their
amendment.'

The Prohibition party organs having
made loud claims of gains at the late
election over 1884, the New York Inde
pendent presents the figures showing
the highest vote of that faction in com
