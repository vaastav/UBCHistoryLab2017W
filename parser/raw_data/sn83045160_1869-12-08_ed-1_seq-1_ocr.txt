THE MESSAGE.
New Yon, December 7. The JfeiaM
save tliai Gran;1 nieesage is that of an
honest, eiear-headed, practical man. In
the reconstruction business he simpiy
looks to the execution ol the laws. His
plea for the funding of the public debt
and the trra.lual return to specie pay
ments wilXjneet with the general appro
bation of the country. It considers the
inmsage non-e nn in : 1 1 al on Cuban atiii'trs.
It is a good business message.
The Time says the message is one of
good news throughout.
The H orirf says this is the weakest mes
sage ever sent to Congress by an Amerb
can President. It considers that the mes
sage settles ibeCuban insurrection against
the patriots; and on linancial affairs it is
too Quixotic and chimerical for serious
voiisideraiiou.
The 'JYilmiie regards the message as one
of the wisest and most judicious ever
transmitted In Congress, and predicts its
hearty approval by the American people.

The Treasurer of l lie I nited States-has
prepttred an elaborate report, setting forth
the prose nt oosidition of the treasury, and
tarnishing a resume of the business of tbe
Treasurer's ohice from Isiil to tin' present
I term. The long and faithful servioea Ct
the present Treasurer is entitled to the

The Increase of receipts for the first five
month- of the present li-cal year is t he
sutr. ot $1.44:1.133 over the amount col
lected in the in -t live mouths of the last
fiscal year, ami is satisfactory testimony
as to the bateiatityof all perosoun employed
in that branch of the public service. The
amount paid bv w arrants for collecting
revenue from customs during the fiscal i
year ending Jiine3n. 1MB, wassu::7.s;. MS;

liT.'i.Mi show ing a decrease ofjluy, loi,7.ui.
The decrease in the cost of collecting the '
revenu-' has not beenatteuded bv anv loss.
Of the efficiency in the service, on the
other hand, it is lielieved that the means
for the detection ol smuggling are lietter
than ever before, and the eustotn-hnu-e
service is also constantly improving. It
ought to be understood that the cli'rf
means of collecting the internal revenue
and enlorclng the revenue laws must lie i
iound in tbe admiulst ration Of tbe apprais-
ers' department. Frauds and losses uris- !
ing from actual smuguling are unimpor- I
tant, when compared with the losses sus- i
tained through the incomjietent ordis-
honest exainiuurs and appraisers. As- j
sumiiig that honest men may lie obtained
for these important jiositions at the pres
ent salaries, it is true that an incompetent
appetiser or examiner may daily subject !
the government to losses far exceeding !
the amount af-tJa salary. Fnder exist
ing laws certain r v. nue officers and oth-
er i-ersons appraising and informers are j
entitled to shares in the tines, penalties j
and forfeitures. During the fiscal year !
18ti8-'tii the Treasury Department distrib-
uted the sum of fc.'6i7.:sl to sueholB-j
eers aud to informers in the vaiiuus cases i
arising under the custom and revenue '
laws, and a large additional sum was also
paid through th" Internal Revenue office.
The reason uisin which the laws granting
such allowances is based is, that officers
of the government are stimulated to
greater activity in the discovery of frauds
and In brink-inn ott.jL.Jeia to punishment. ,
I There can be no doubt thai Man is the
effect of this policy, but the experience 1
have had in the Treasury Department has
convinced me the that the evils attending
the system are greater than the benefits
derived from it. It often occurs that rev- !
enue officers are lead to assert claims in !
penalties to misrepresent the case to the
governrnent so as to secure jrreater ad
vantage to themselves: but a more serious
evil is found in a practice quite general of
allow ing persons a fraudulent course un
til a result is reached which will inure to
the beuetit of the officers ami informers,
instead ol checking the practices at the
outset. It is impossible to set forth, in
exact iengnage, the character of the evils
that grow out of the present system. I
mi, howev. r. Nearly of the opinion that
the government ought to rflyon public
OJtk-ers for the proper UiafalMinee of their
duties without stimulating them by any
contingent advantages. I have recom
mended an iuereana of salaries of custom
officers, and the abolition of tbe system of
giving to them a share of hues, penalties
and mrfeHurea will be an additional ren
aujt Jut all iutuciaan o! salaries in fbtede
partnat at dfthe pnHie service. It has !s.
isime a pramice lor ch f.ks and other per
sons w ho have held cilice in the Treasurv
Department to accent employment as
ajrents ,.r attorneys lor parties liayms: ,
claims aaniHt the liepartuient. and there .
is reason to believe in some cases the ill
formation obtained while in public ser
vice has been used in aid ol claimants.
Without detailing ail the objections to
this practice, I respectfully suggest a law
be passed ton ring persons from practicing
before the Tn .oiirv liepanmcut as agents
or attorneys in la-half of claimants, that
were pending when such persons were of
fjcersof th' Department.
Iu March last there were employed
in the Treasury Depart uieiit at
Washington, HS clerks, man am ire rs,
and laborers at a monthly cost of s-j-151.
Al present the wtioie u umber of such
etuployei-s is j: ;l, and their monthly pay
23,82,180, sbou-iug a decrease of expense
at the rate of Soi.7;i..sut per annum. It
lir.s o.-en found necessary, however, dur
ing the periods mentioned, to increase the
fo.ee in the Internal Revenue oltice anil
in tbe office of th" First Comptroller.
This increase iu ib aggmu'ate is at the
rate of (soil per iinuiiui. This stasaajaaflt
does not relate to the force employed in
the BaraaSJ of Kngraviug and Printing.
In March last there were special agents in

tion of the Department it is shipiicd to the

the disposition ot every sheet ot

each of several printing estab

sult compared with account on Treasury
Department. In an aggregate of about
7.mn',noo of sbeeta received by the agent
at the mills discrepances were found to
exist of six sheets of fractional currency
pajwr. for the money value of which the
companies doing the worM are responsi
ble. Il is believed that theso arraii;e-
menu furnish better security than here

sue of currency or other obligation

vcssela belonging to the department, ol
which twelve are sailing vessels :;iyl
twentv-four re steam, is. They .oy In
size from forty to fourhiindred and eighty
tons. hie hundred and seventy-tin ee oiii
cers and two thousand lour hundred men
are required to ill in these vessels, and
tbatr nuining expenses amount to alum
HKi,UOO a year. Five of these vessels arc
side-w heel .steamers of four hundred and
eighty tons, are lake steamer, and w ith
out commanders; they are rapidly dimin
ishing in value, while th care of them
involves an ex pemltt ure of about $70,000.
Vessels now in service have Is-en pur
chased and built, at various times, and, as
far as 1 can ascertain, without spe
! cial reference io the nature of
the duty to be performed, etc.,
and eert.iini v w ithout any matured plan,
j From one-half to tbree-iiiarters of the

I StMio.noo for the construe, ion ot four addi
j tiolial vessels, and proposals were issued
' and bids received under the authority
; tiius eoiiferred ujiun the Secretary of tbe
Treasiny, but no contracts have been
made. An examination of the subject
j has forced the conviction apqei ins that it
j is inexpedient to incur tho expenditure
until tan Departmet.t is in possession of
more accurate and eomplete information,
j I shall therefore take tho opinion of a
board of nam potent officers upon the fol
j lowing point-: First. The size and char
j aeter of tho vessels required by tbe na
ture of the service they are to perform.
Second. Whether they should be con
structed of iron or wood, or a combina
tion of the materials: whether the re
port of the Commissioner shall have been
received proposals will be issued for the
const ruction of four vessels as authorized.
In addition Jj) the parent mint of Phila

one at Denver, Col., and one at Portland,
Oregon. Since the commencement ot the
war the bnaehaa at New Orleans. Dahlon
ega and Charlotte have been closed. An
assay office, it is believed, will satisfy the
necessities of the the mining interests in
Coloradot as for the present mil v a lim
ited business is tieing done at the Port
land mint. Indeed, with the construction
of railroads, and consequent increased fa-
pi titles ior communication, i am oi opin
lrepaiatiops are making
mintaat Chariot tti and Dahlonega. The
mining and isiiningof the prnahMts metals
is now so large a national interest that ill
deer es more attention than it has tilths '
rto received. There i no bin can or
officer in the Treasury Department at
Washington, charged especially with tic!
management of this great interest. 1 '
therefore rocommeud that provision be
made for the appointment of a proper ,
pnfoer, to be entrusted with this branch of
public business, under the directionol tiu
Secretary of the Treasury.

There are two reasons, and each seems to
be the controlling reason, why bonds
should be exempt from State and local
taxes; it not bo exempted, the amount of
the tax imposed by the local authority
will be added to the Interest the Govern
ment w ill lie required to pay, and than
the National (Government will bo com
pelled to provide (br taxes imposed by the
ioe d authorities. Secondly, innamuch
as Ihe ability to borrow may, under some
cirtuiustanccs, lie essential Jjp t.lic preser
vation of the Uoveriiniciit, thl) jsiwers,
should not, even in time of pw.ee and
prosperity, be qualified by any concession
io tbe stii.es ot the right to tax. the mean
by which the National Government is
maintained. The right to use lawful pow ers,
free of any condition, east riot ion or
claim of another, is an essential condi
tion of sovereignty, and the rf atiuaal Gov
ern nwnt should never squander or qfialify
its power la this particular. In oifeimg
the new loan, citizens and subjects of
other governments should receive the
strongest assurance that tbe interest and
principal is to lie paid in coin, according
to the terms of the bonds issued, without
any deduction or abatement whatsoever.
In order to avoid the necessity of employ
ing an agent for negotiation "of the loan.
I respectfully recommend that a lllieral
eommi-sion be allowed to aabaettbara,
and that those who first subscribe be per
mitted toselectthe dssnof lioiuls in which
this suliscriylion resnecli vely shall be
made. I further rocoiumend,'in eoBjeee
tion with the proposvd loan, that the
banks established under the act to pro
vide national currency be require I to
sulistitute Isolds that may be iasne i

should be suffered to remain either f ir
purchase or redemption previous to 1K74.

that pnrpooo.tho ant Ira publicdebt would

hat wean 1874 and uWL The 10-4.1 bonds
could be paid, and provision also made for
the redemption of bonds which will bo-
ic due in the year I88L It may be wise
to reduce the loan to l,u00,ui0,000, w hich
would leave for payment previous to I 'I.
the sum of about MiTd.Ooo.OOO, or hardly
more than ti0.0otl,nii0 a year. Assuming
that the MOpoand loan will be lor au
amount not exceeding !Jio,o00,0tfl, I re
commend that ii be offered ill three classes
of taTO,OI),000 each, the first class of M m,
OOO 000 to Is- payable in iifteen year-, and
to lie paid in twenty years; tho second
class of 4HO,iOn,000 to be payable in twen
ty vears, and to bo paid in twenty-five
years; the third class of flOJ,000,000, to be
payable In twenty-five years, and to be
paid in thirty years. The eseeiitial con
dition of the new loan appears to mo to
be these: first, that tbe principal and in
teiit shall bo in.. payable in coin; sec
ond, that the bonds known as five-twenty
bond-- sball be received in exchange lor
DOW bonds; third, that tho principal be
payable in this country, und interest

to civti the various question that arise in
Ihn idmhllatialllQ of thn system that at
tention which is essential to the service.

Commissioner of Iiterpal Ilevenue. and
tho appointment ot a competent t onnnls
si.tiier, would render, tie; exeenUon
of
the custom and revenue laws much more
ellicieut and harmonious, while the reve
nue would probably be increased to the
amount of many mi'llion dollars annually,
nor is it probable that the expenses would
be materially greater, excluding interest
aoernad and not paid, aud deducting cash
on hand. The debt of tho Cnitcd Mates
on the first of March last was fi"iJ,.lii,.;2ii,
tM, and subject to the same condition it
was VtU.tKyrtfi9 ot) the first of the
j sat montli, showing a decrease of
71,901184 To. This apparent decrease of
the public debt is less than tho actual de
crease. Considerable sums have been
paid on account of war and other old
claims not previously ascertained,
and therefore not included iu any
debt statement. The account of March
lot, front the necessity of the ease, inclu
ded only tho Interest accruod and not
then payable, but as a matter of fact there
were outstanding and over due interest
coupons, of which several millions have
since been paid out of the ordinary rev
enue. Previous to March 1st no interest
account had ever beou kept with the sev
eral loans. Such measures as were found
practicable have been taken to ascertain
ihe exact condition of these amounts. The
have Increased, aud consequently a large
amount or currency has been withdrawn
from other sections to supply the demand
there created. The amount necessary for
the puriswes of the South will steadily in
crease lor the next two years.
The construction of tho 1'ai fie Railroad
is likely to result in the substitution of
paper for coin hv .people on the Pacific
coast. If is probable that tbe demand for
p iper for the purpose wili not be less than
thirty millions of dollars; as a' conse
quence, a very large quantity of coin will
bu withdraw n irrim circulation, and thus
practically tho coin will be increased on
the Atlantic coast, and paper circulation
in States east or the Bheky
Mountains lie matrrially reduced. These
changes will tend to diiniiiialfihs differ
ence between paper and coin, the ability
of the co u u try to resume specie payniem
will not licduo to any special legislation
on thai subject, but to" the condition of its
industries and to the financial relations
to other countries. These of course a ill
lie more or less dependent on the gein iai
policy of the Government. The war ex
hausted the country of its mat rial
wealth and yie States' of the South were
literally impoverished. A neeeesarj
condition for the resumption of speele
payment was the development of tin. in
dustry of the nation, both" South ami
North, and the consequent accumula
tion of moveable products of industry to
such an extent thai our exisirts
of those products should lie equal
substantially to our inqwrts.
There arc two evils in the present bank
system which require remedy by prompt
-and efficient legislation. The hrst is the
practice oil tho part of banks of allowing
interests on deposits. The effect of the
practice is t lint monies in the hands of in
dividuals, which otherwise might b.
loan. .1 for regular mercantile and other
business purposes, are diverted into the
i astody of banks upon the idea that If
Ihe security is not lietter, payment can be
obtained at a moment's notice. Country
banks and others remote from the large
centers of trade having received money
on deposit Jor w hich they pay Interpol,
ure enxfons la transfer 'such funds to
other Links, from which they will re
ceive an equal or larger amount of inter
est in return. They are stimulates! also
by the desire to' place their lunds where
they can be at all times commanded.
Thus influenced, large sums are placed on
dojiosit with liiiiks in cities, especially In
the city of New York, which is the great
center of trade and tinanco for the At- j
btntte Coast. In the ordinary course of'
trade the currency of the country tends
rapidly to the cities, it is unwise to '
stimulate this tendency by artificial '
means. But the evil doeis not end with j
the impoverishment of the country. I
the hanks in the cities may bo called on i
at any moment to respond to drafts of
their depositors. They decline to make
loans, representing siich fund on com
mercial paper, payable on time, but in
sist on making call loans, as they are
termed, with Government bonds or other
obligations pledged as collateral security.
Merchants generally will not borrow
money in large sums payable upan de
mand. The corisequeni-e is that moneys
thus accumulated in city banks are
loaned to persona engaged in speculative
pursuits. The extent of this evil is seen
in the fa t of the bank loans in the city
of New York in ltaiS; j9H,iOO,oiiO were
apon commercial paper, and fits.on0.000 on
demand, with a pledge of collaterals, an t
in lsoa, J!,000,000 were upon commercial
paper and SSO,000,000 in demand. In the
former year, fortj-one )ier cent., and in
the latter year, thirty-seven per cent, of
tho loan made by tbe New York bank
were upon demand of three per cant, cer
tificates. The additions to banking capi
tal might be so arranged as not to pro
duce serious disturbances in the finances
or business of the country, while addi
tional banking capital would be supplied
to the sections now in need of it, and this
w ithout any increase of the volume Of
circulation.
A further result is seen in the fact that
p irties borrowing moneys nnon commer
cial paper for legitimate comm. reiki pur
I .os. s, pay from tlirec to six cents addr-
lional interest per annum, as compared
with persons who liorrow money for spec
ulative purposes. I therefore respectluily
recounuena that a law lie passed prohib
iting, absolutely, payment of interest by
banks upon deposits, anil limit, also, their
ioaus upon collaterals to an amount not
exceeding 10 per cent of their capital. I
am satisfied, also, that the practice of cer
tifying checks, even if funds arc in the
bank to the credit ( I it.-' dr iWer ol check.
is fraught with eviL and that il ought to
lie entirely prohibited1.
Considerable progress has been made
upon the foundation of the poslotfice
building in the city of New York, and of
the paatoflhjs and independent treasury
building in the city of Boston. Tho Su
pervising Architect 01 Ihe Treasury De
partment is of the opinion that the w alls

During the fiscal year ending June 30, '
IS R, l ban was an excess of receipts over j
expenditures, including Ihe interest on ;
the pnblic debt, of c4y.4o-'5,H!l M. Of this -
excess 9t8,M3,S7t, as nearly rj can
now be ascertained, arose Marians
to March 1st. and remainder f:!,Wii,077,t43
between thai time and the l;rst day of
.Inly. This ec:ss was applied, lrom lime
lo time, to the purchase of five-twenty
bonds; and the excess of receipt since
July 1st has been used in the same man
ner. The purchases amounted, in the ag
g t-cg.it e, ou the el'tU day of November to
176,47800. A a large iart of the excess
of receipts that was rcalizeil on coin sales
of gold have been made from time to
time, and the proceeds applied to the pur
chase of bonds. W it hlhc exception of sales
of moderate amounts of coin in Chicago,
New Orleans, St. Louis and Baltiniore,for
tho payment ! du ies. the sale of gold
and the purchase of Ismda have been
made uniformly through the agency
ot the I nited States Treasurer (t New
-Vork, aiu) without expense tit the Cjoe
ernmeiit. Except the comparatively small
amouul paid for advert ising the proposals,
tho average premium on gold sold since
March 1st has been 82 8-100 percent, and
the ayern;;e premium paid for bonds has
been in tis-leu per com; iisin this basis of
the sales of guld ami the purchase of
bonds, the average prices paid for bonds
in coin has been 8S 55-loQ per uept, Tho

coin received for duties tlpou imported
goods should be aunually set apart as a

with the requirement I have purchased
nonm? i, uu. aiuoiuii ui c-,o-l.,oo, ami :
liesiiiuaieu lueiu asoeiouiu to me oil k-

thu compliance with the statute from the j
4th of March last. I have not felt myself
authorised pr required to make any pro- :
vision for tho time that elapsed aftor the j
passage of tbe act and previous to the
commencement of the adlrrinist ration. I
With au excess of means at my command j
I have purchased bonds in addition to
: h t-e purchased for the sinking fund to i
the amount of fAS,482,0o0. These are held
al a special fund, subject to the action of j
Congress, and I respectfully recotu-
mend that they be added to the sink
ing fund, and that any furthor pur
en a.-es that way bo made be so added ;
until tbe eross amount shall constitute
a fund equal to that which would buve
been created if there had been no delay
iu the execution of the law. The depre
ciation of currency is due to two causes i
first, oxoeselve Issue; and secondly, to
the want of faith in the Government and
tbe extent of the influence of the fii-Nt-named
cause cannot be ascertained. The
second is removed substantially v.-believer
on credit shall be so much improved
at home and abroad, that holders of bonds
are disposed to retain them. When the
public will become excited upon tinanoial
subjects, we shall be able to Judge! more
accurately the extent of tbe oven-issue of
paper money. It is also true that the
quantity of currency in the treasury

of t lie country unnot be fixed accu
rately since the close' of the war,
as il is necessary to paV for merchandise

stantially to the produi Is otLother coun
trie imported. There will be no demand
for specie for export except what may
arise lrom the circumstances that on'r
bonds abroad are sent home to bo -sold.
When the credit of the country shall be
fully established in Euroiie, and there
i -hail ne no doubt either of our ability or
our disposition to meet all of our obliga
tions, bonds heretofore, and now, to a
large extent held by merchants and bank
ers will bit transferred to capitalists for per
manent investment. When this change
shall have taken place, ihe probability of
o: - securities being sent home, under the
influence of political or linancial disturb
ances in Kngland, is very light, and when,
as a concurring fact, our exports, exclu
sive of public securities, shall Ik) equal to
our imports, specie payment may 1st re
sumed without even a temporary embar
rassment to the business of the country.

eannol omit to call the attention of
Gbngrasa to the inadequacy of Ihe salaries
paid to officers in the Treasury Depart
ment who exercise discretion and whose
acts on behalf oftho Government afthft di
rectly Its cinendituresor revenues. Some
of the salaries were fixed when the Gov
ernment, was organized, o hers when new
offieer- were added, and out few of the::;
have bean increased recently. It Is un
, i -tionably true that persons having
eiiunl abilities, and clothed with similar
rcsonsibility, receive much larger com
pensation from individuals and corpora
i ions. Although many of the officers now
in public service are "likely to continue,
froal the circumstance that their vocation
has led them aside from the ordinary
ebaaaV Is of banhseaaj yet as an act of jus
tice to thorn, an I in iho interest of the
Government, I recommend an iticrease
of their pay. Speaking g( nerally. thai in
crease of pay should extend to revenue
officers in custom service, as collectors,
BUrVeyOrS, naval officers, and especially
to appraisers and examiners in the ap
praiser's department. Should the recom
mendation to repeal the laws granting
shares of penalties and fines and forfeit
ures to public officers be adopted, it will
be necessary to increase tho salaries of
collectors, n aval officers and surveyors at
all the princip tl parts of the eonntry. It
is a plain trnth that the Government has
no right to expect the services of such
ompetenl men as appraisers and exam
nen at the present inadequate salaries in
the large cities. They are insufficient for
the support of a family, and, under such
circumstances, the Government is not
w ithout responsibility when it places its
officers in such positions that
the' are compelled to choose be
tween dishonesty on the one
j one baud and penury on the other. The
salaries of the Assistant Treasurer and
I tlier principtil atnatrs should also lie
'creased; and for so tstantially the same
' reasons it hiw been found impossible for
1 the last few vears to obtain the services of
! the most ellicieut clerks in the Treasury
I'cparuucni r.va p. tiy auuiliuil io ineli
lawful salaries through an appropriation
plaisl in the hands of the Svcretary for
that pursise. Tho distribution ol this ap
propriation is an unpleasant duty for tbe
Societal y. and cannot Is: performed with
out producing jealousy and discontent
among the department. Speaking gene
rally, it may bo said the heads of bureaus')
cbicl clerks, and clerks in charge of di
visions are inadequately compensated for
tho services they perform. The routine
of business of the Department can be per
formed in a satisfactory manner by clerks
receiving the compensation now provided
by the la.. but nto.n on whose discretion
and In e uiont the Government relies for
the proper transaction of the business of
' !. eonntry, and whose labors aro not lim
ited to tne ordinary hours of duty, should
be, made to feel that they are properly
compensated.

The proceedings of the first dsy, in Isith

was adopted, directing tho Postmaster
General lo report on the practicability of

ollice. With other unimportant proceedings,
the House adjourned.
Senate. Mr. Spencer iutroduced a bill
amending the Civil Kights bill of April !,
tflftt. It makes the testimony of negroes
competent iu the State courts. Laid on
t he tablo,
A bill to protect the freedom of transit
within the t'niled States, was introduced
by Mr. Carpenter.
Tho Vice Presiiient submitted amemo
rial from the Republican Convention of
Virginia," held November 114 and :K. re
viewing the election in that State, and ar
guing against the admission of the Sena
tors (jd representtaives elect.
Mr. sumner introduced a bill to fully
amend the Bankiug Act, and promote a
return to specie payments, as follows;
lie it enaeted, etc.. That so much of the
Hanking Act as limits the Issue of bills to
$.'100,000,000 is hereby repealed; and that
the existing banks may be enlarged, and
new banks may be organise at the dis-
crelion of the Secretary of the Treasury;
out no more onio iii.to sre now suiuor
i.tdhytbe Banking Act shall heroafter
be issued, unless tne secretary of the
Treasury at the time ol each issue can and
does cancel and destroy a like ainount. of
legal tenders; and the inoreaae of bank
bilk hereby authorised shall not exceed
$50,000,000 per year, which amount shall
be so distributed by the Secretary of the
Treasury as lo equalize as nearly as possi
ble the banking interests, of the different
States.
Mr. Sumuor indicated his reasons in fa
vor of tbe bill:
First, it will create a demand for our
national bonds, and to this extent fortify
the national credit.
Second, It will tend to satisfy those
markets of the country, especially
in the South aud West, where currency
and banks are wanting, and thus arrest a
difficult question.
Third, It will not expand or contract
the currency, so thst opposite parties in
speculations may support it.
Fourth. Under It the banks will be
gradually strengthened and propose to re
sume specie payment.
Fifth, It will give the South and West
the opportunity to organize banks, and
will interest the ports of the couatry to
this extent, in the national securities and
the national banking system, by which
both will be strengthened.
Sixth, It will, within a reasonable
time, relieve the country of the whole
greenback system, and thus dispose of an '
onporta 'i o'l stion, anil will give us a
r turn to siieoic payrnei. t.
The bill w .t i ,oi the present.
.Mr. TtnanbwH iMfodneed a bill to re
lievo the members of Congress from lm
portrTnitv. and to preserve the independ
ence of tiie different parts of the Govern
ment. It provi.'u that any member oi
Congress who shall directly or indirectly
recommend the appointment to an office
by the President, or the hea ls of Depart
ments, of any poison; or in any of tbe
Kxecutive Departments, except when
such recommendation shall ! in writing,
in response to a written request of the
head of Department, a-king information
thereby, the Senator giving his advice
consent, in the maimer proviib d by the
Constitution, shall be guilty of a misde
meanor, and on conviction thereof, shall
be fined 'not i x eroding M n for each o:-ten.-e;
and ii shall not lie lawful for the
President or be nt of any Department, to
appoint to office or employ in ms Depart
ment, any person who si, all In dilvctH
or indirectly recommended therefor bv
any member of rWna.ii as. or DeLogah
lrom a Territory, except in the manner
now provided.
Mr. Tratnbull exptaiaed his bill at gr a
length, afer wbkrh Mr. Davis sevej
criticized the appointments made by ti e
President. He aul that patriotism, ..r...
and inteJligeiice bad been, in many M
siauces, sup. , sciitsl by igSMSjssacO and t
obviate thin he desired ihe bill to lie made
sufficiently comprehensive aud complete.
The bill was laid ( the table, for the pie-
ent, and ordered to be printed.
On irfotioii of Mr. AfcCrcery, the bill to
relieve the eondit i. I ; persons frosn tin
legal and political disabilities' imposed bv
