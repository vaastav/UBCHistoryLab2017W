fifteen ne"rocs and one white leader, havebeen

tempted insurrection. No further particulars
received.
There have been tiroes when b th our taste
and judgment would have induced us to pass
by such an item as the above, but now we
have fallen upon times when we believe that
every class should know their respective posi

tempt at revolt will b3 met with speedy
vongeancc, and that every offender will bo
swung to the first tree. Let ihcm know that
tho white men of the S i th hive determined,
whether the Union be dissolved or not, that
they shall be obedient, submissive and quiet,
and that they shall continue to serve their
owners in the future as in (he past
As to the Northern people, scattered here
and there all over the State, we bgthcmto be
cautious ; and we also warn our citizens that

2TROH OUR CORRESPONDENTS.
Noble Sentiment from a Northern
Ulan.
Habtfokd, Nov. 29th, 18G0.
To-day has been set apart as a day of thanks
giving and prayer we think that the latter
should be especially recommended ; but after
giving thanks for an abundant harvest, general
good health, and peace with foreign nations we
must pause, for, with regard to internal peace
and harmony we fear that the appointment of
such a day is ill-timed. Yet fanaticism is blind
and while the churches and streets are filled
with persons who have been thrown out of em
ployment by the present stagnation in business,
prayers enough to i exch from here to North
Carolina will be made for the "poor African in
bondage," who is abundantly cared for and is
perfectly indifferent to panics and the pressure
in the money market.
We fear that the storm which has threatened
us for so many years is soon to burst in fury
upon us, and if the days of this Republic are
numbered as they seem to be the Republican
party is alone responsible for it. Yet we are
ml sorrv thiHhe crisis has come: if it had
come twenty years ago the country would now
be in a mucVi,etter stat we only wish that
:P4, , .,,
J
the South were united ; if they were and would
then proceed in a temperate way to set forth
their grievances and demand restitution there
wouldn't be enough lift of the Republican par
ty to make a village engine company. The
should demand that the nullifying States at tl e
North repeal their Personal Liberty Bills, that
the decision of the Supreme Court in tho Dred
Scott case be everywhere recognized and re
spected, and that further assurances be given
that this unreasonable and unwarrantable cru
sade against slavery be ended once and forever.
Until these things be done we will never con
sent to being a part of this Republic in nulli
ying the Constitution you have broken a bar
gain, and a bargain broken on one side is abai
g: it. broken on all sides, but for our rights we
w.ll fight to the last breath of life. If this was
fie tone of Southern sentiment wc do not think
lla" any person living now will ever see the
Union dissolved.
The feeling at the North has changed some
what since the election and we certainly be
lieve that the Republican party has decreased
by thousands ; the fact is that it was a danger
ous experiment and many have already suffer
ed by it ; it is from the abundance of the pocket
that the mouth speaketh, and as long as the
Southern ordeis come in the merchants are
dreadfully independent, but now that to a cer
tain extent they have stopped they have noth
ing to say.
Another fact worth stating is that the Re
publicans are beginning to find out that they
have been dreadfully taken in. They have been
led to suppos" that the election of Hi: Lincoln
would inaugurate a milienium for them and
the negroes, but now they see that his election
cannot affect rlavery one particle ; that he is
Constitutionally obliged to carry out the Ias
of tho land, the f'g:Jive slave law included ; that
so far as the extension of sla'-cry is concerns :
that the people and not the President will ev
ade, and that they have elected a Preside n'
who has but little power vested on him and
ltJK.t Con'.-ress which is far more important.
Let us hope then that the people v. ill soon
come to their senses that they will see that
the interest of our common country arc f.u
mrre important than the interests of any par
ticular section, and that they will bear in mind
that there is but one vay for us to be benefit
ted by tho rich legacy which our fathers have
bequeathed to us, one way to use it and but one
way to preserve it.
A military company has been organized among
he students of Trieity College in this city.
We presume that the prime object is to gain
the physical benefits which must always at
t(nda military drill. Independently of that,
Jimvowr military knowledge, no matter how
slight, is never out of place. They arc to be
furnished with arms from the State Arsenal,
and x-Governor Seymour, the hero of Chc
pultepec, in the Mexican war, will occasionally
drill them. Complimentary to Prof. Daves of
this institution who was mainly instrumental
in organizing the company, they have styled
themselves the Graham Guards. Long may
they Uourish. Yours, P.
G;ii.dsi! iico', Iec. 3rd, 1800.
Deaf Prognss : I paid a short visit to the
very thriving little town of Wilson on last Sat
urday. The intense excitement which pre
vailed there a few days since in consequence of
the reported threatened insurrection among the
negroes had entirely subsided after having the
matter thoroughly investigated and Ending
nothing to substantiate the report.
I had the pleasure of spending a few minutes
with l)r. Deems, who has much improved in
health by his recent European touf. I regret
to inform you of a sad accident that occurred
in his family on last Wednesday -.tight. His
very interesting little son Ed ly ha I boon re
quested by an elder brother to bring hiin a
pistol from another part of the house, and in
the act of complying with his brother's req est,
the pistol was discharged and the conttn's
lodged in the thigh of the unfortunate child.
The wound, though not very painful, is a very
ugly one, and a deep one, as the ball has not
yet bacn recovered.

THE
ABOLITIONISTS DISCOMFITED IN
BOSTON.
Boston. Dec. H. A John Brown meeting,
called by the abolitionists, was attempted to
bi held to-day irf the Masonic Temple, in this
city. The Temple was taken possession of by
the Union men. who organized a meeting for
themselves, and chose Richard Sullivan for
Chairman. Resolutions Were passed denoun
cing John TrDwn, jus'ifying his execution
and praising Virginia for the act. Fred. Doug
las, Redpath, Frank S-nViorn and other well
known abolitionists vainly endeavored to be
heard. Th ;re was a great deal of confusion,
and at last the police were called in, the hall
cleared and closed by order of the Mayor.

Washington, Dec. 3.
- Among the various propositions for quieting
the political troubles, is one to tho effect that
so much of the President's message as treats
on them shall be referred, in the House, to a
select committee of members from all the
States, with instructions to bring forward some
compromise measure.
Many who formerly believed that South
Carolina would be the only State to secede, arc
now satisfied from assurances from ihc Geor
gia, Alabama and Mississippi members, that
ihose Sfafes will make common cause with
South Carolina. There appears to be nothing
vhich gives conservative men a hope of the
continuance of the Union.
PrmuD rusr-ATCiJ.
Washington, Dec. 3. The projected meet
:ng of the Union Senators for this evening has
Ven indefinitely postponed at the suggestion of
Mr. Crittenden.
Several Southern delegations arc in secret
consultation to-night, 'i heir object seems to
b" to secure the co-operation of the border slave
afes to 4 he Secession movement.
Whilst some JJepublicans affect' to believe
'hat South Carolina only will secede, others are
beginning to be alarmed. Ev.n Sumner pri
atelv said to-day that tlr-rc was danger of Se
cession spreading.
The President's Message will offend the South
by i s posi'ion against Secession, a.d the Xorth
by its condemnation of the Personal Liberty
B lis. Parties claiming to be well posted say
that he will reeommend a general Convention
of all the S'a c, with a v ew to the adjustment
of difficulties.
It is evident fiat tho Administration f ars
trouble in endeavoring to execute the Federal
laws.
Notwithstanding there was an appearance of
studied courtesy, amounting almost to cordiali
ty, to-day, between members of the extreme
wings. North and South, a close, observer could
not fail to perceive occasionally flashes of indig
nation on the prt of those from the Cotton
Slates, foretelling a foming storm.

NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE COR

As before suggested in these columns there
is yet left a re nedy by which the Union can
be honorably preserved to the entire .satisfac

is now a s tt'ed fact that the South wil! nnf

the South, a b-ise recognition of her inferiority in

and r.s sneh on'- cntrled to those
wli'c'i ixvc r-i;il! v dis -prised to vas-

Bu inasmuch
as the

? or h m every
ro-Tcei. as a people, only asking for sitrjtle
justice, and nothing more, they have resolved
to hava it under the ;i?gis of the Constitution,
if they can, if not. in a separate government.
The people of the South. :?s a body, de-ire
the preservtit'on and perpetuation of the Con
stitution and the Union. T'-.ey are willing and
desirous that the Union of the States shall re
main intact, and the laws administered in ac
cordance with the. ".uaran'.ei s of the Constitu
tion as expounded by the fathers; but they
will ncv-'-r ar.e that the Cons'itr.tion shall be
interpret! d 1 their s: r o' s detriment, or the
bond.-: ,' the Union to 7 r.l tlvir destrrc-ion.
The idea prevails at the North. Ihat a. con
tinual submission to insult and aggression is
preferrel to disunion. It is a great miVakc.
The South is in deep and determined earnes.
She is tired and disgusted with the slavry ag
itation, and such is now the nature of affairs,
that all rejecting minds see that this question
must be forever settled, or the bonds of the
Union must and will be served. Therefore,
the South proposes a plan bv which all dis
tracting dift". renccs can be settled, and a plan
that each section and every interest, if agreed
to can be constitutionally protected and main
tained, to the satisfaction and justice of all.
Will the North consent that justice shall be
do e ? We shall see.
The plan is, that there shall be a convention
of all the States, a National Convention, which
shall convene in the city of Washington, on
(he first Monday in January next, composed of
two delegates " only, elected by th;; people
from en c 'Stats of the Confederacy, and that
these delegates be instructed by the people to
settle and arrange, in thirty days from the time
of me tinr, the question of slavery and all
other sectional differences, upon a National
bas:s, and if the convention can airrce upon a
settlem ent, that it', action before the fourth of
Mt rc'i, lSf.l. be referred to the people tor rati
fication or re jection. If ratified, let that settle
ment 1 c incorporated by the proper authority
as an amendment to the constitution.
Tf the North, however, in Convention fails to
the South her Constitutional demands,
then let it be understood that the two delegates
selected by the States of the South for a settle
nr be also empowered to sever the bond.-,
of ?he Union, and immediately proceed to form
Mi-h a government for the Southern States, as
is congenial to their taste, nited to their inter
ef 's, and will give them protection in all cases,
a:i 1 in all pursuits.
Bv pursung-t policy of tn:s sort, the Niuth
will lis j'jst'nl' d in the e3'es of all civilization.
Br.t if the South hastily secedes from the Unio..,
without making a final effort at an adjustment
of difficulties, we shall have wrangling and dis
con'ent .n our midst, and withal the censure of
other nations. Let us then act prudently,
calmly, discreetlj, harmoniously, but firmly.
If this policy is acceptable, it will supercede
the neces ity of seperale State action, and give
demagogues no opportunity to trifle with vital
.principles, or pander to the prejudices of the
timid and the ignorant.
In the meantime, every member of Congress
representing a Southern constituency, should
resign at once. Let us have ru thing further to
do with the Government until the eternal and
everlasting question of slavery is settled. If
the South cannot settle it in the present Union,
we Can doubtless do so otit of it. But it is her
first duty to settle it if possible upon honorable
and equitable principle, in the Union.

The descendants of the patriot heroes of 177-",
toi";:her with the citizens of the co;iny g .-ncr-
ally, in accordance with the call made through I
our columns, met at the Court Ilovse on Sa'- !
urday, and they have spoken in a language al-
tottetner unexceptionable, yet firm and sig-
n if! cant. !
Before the hour appointed for the meeting. !
the Court House was literally crowded, and j
the sidewalks leading to the house w-.re lined i
with ihe patriot sons of Mecklenburg, pressing J
forward to take part in the proceedings and
s.hane the sentiment which was about to go 1
forth as the voice of one man. All other meet
ings held in Charlotte since we have resided
here, when compared with the one held on
Saturday, sinK into utter signiticar.ee. it was
truly a congregration of the masses, and the-
have spoken as becomes Southern freemen.
without anv r?gard to past divisions or differ
ences, exhibiting a settled determination to
support and enjoy their rights at the risk of

Tlie President TIessage.
Tho Message was ssnt into Cony3's on
Tuesday and last night we had biys distribu
ting it 01 tha streets bifor t!rj mail tras open
ed. To-day we serve it in an. Eslra to each
of our subscribers. This is a Jittb faster thm
tho oil system and is only am-dishd. by
energy and a liberal expenditure of means.
All we ask in return is a conliauanca of the lib
eral patronage of oar fell a t citizins.
The Message is a long and an important doc
ument, and will repay a careful reading. Mr.
Buchanan takes a bold stand against secession,
saying that the election of Lincoln is not in it
self sufficient cause for a disseJut on of the Un
ion, and that he will do his duty. He advises
a convention of all the States for the purpose cf
amending the Constitution so as to settle the
question of slavery forever, and urgas that all
constitutional means should be exhausted be
fore secession, or revolution (he contends that
secession is revolution,) should be resorted to.
We may have more to say of it hereafter; we
have now neither time nor space to say more.
Wc urge all to read it for themselves and dim
ly consider its suggestions.
"I There no Hope."
Almost every hour in the day this question
is put to us: "is thcro no hops to save the
Union?" And this question is asked too by
old and young, rich and poor, by citizens and
strangers; by men in town and men from the
country. "Is there no hope to save the
Union 1" Alas 1 alas 1 wc fcar not. The mas
ses can do nothing ; the newspapers can do
nothing; the politicians can do nothing, and
so we can only wait, fear and tremble. The
sages of the land now assembled at Washing
ton, the agents and delegates of the people,
may do something, but we repeat that wc, the
people, are powerless. We can prepare for
the dread catastrophe -and determine to meet
it should it come, as our sires mat the aggres
sive encroachments of British tyranny.
" Is there no hope to save the Union ?'' is
asked by the young and blooming maiden,
is caught up and re-echoed by the young
mother and staid matron and dies out on the
limping tongue of prattling innocence. Would
to Heaven, for heir sake, the Union could be
saved ; but even they would not consent to re
main in the Union as degraded inferiors. .
"Is fierc no hope to save the Union?" Ah,
ask it of older and wiser heads than ours and
you will find them as ignorant on this subject
as little babes. The whole world is undergoing
revolution, and we do fear that, without some
interposition of Divino Providence, this fair
land is destined to share tho general destruc
tion. We know not what is to become of the coun
try or the people, but we advise tlie South, es
pecially North Carolin, to make speedy pre
parations for the worst

NUMBER 15.
Judge Dot;lus nnd lion. John 91c
Clcrnan-J at Washington Tlieir
Speeches, &c.
non. S. A. Douglas arrived ct Washington
on Saturday last and was most enthusiastically
received. In answer to a reception speech
from Mr. Ehnis, Judge Douglas spoke as fol
lows : '
"Judgo Douglas said that to be thus wel
comed by those who knew him so well, inspir
ed him with new energies in his public efforts.
He referred with pride to the lact that during
fie past canvass he had been able to avow his
sentiments in al! parts of the country, in the
North, South, East and West. From Bangor
to Missouri he had advocated the principles of
equr.l rights, equal justice, and equal protection
to all citizens. He believed the perpetuity of the
republic depended upon the triumph of the prin
ciple of non-intervention. He said tho federal
government had no power to interfere with
slavery anywhere except ia causing tho return
of fugitive slaves agreeably to the law and Con
stitution. He held the fugitive slave law to be
binding upot all good citizens; and if it had
been carried out in good faith the republic
would not now be in j eril and danger.
' 'Referring to lion. A. H. Stephens late
speech, Judge Douglas said he endorsed every
sentiment it contained, it inspired him with the
hope that there was a party yet strong enough
to save the country. lie accepted the Georgia
platform in all its features. T he Personal Liberty
bills should never have been tipon the statute
books of any State, no believed Congress bad
power to remove all obstructions to the Fugi
tive Slave law, whether resulting from State or
any other legisla'ion. Jadg-j Douglas remarked
that he had said nothing during the canvass
that did not meet the approval of his conscience,
lie urgad all Union men, all constitutional lov
ing men, to sink their bickerings and un:te to
save their country first, and quarrel, if they
plea3? !, afterwards.
"Mr. Lincoln having been elected according
to the constitution, he must lc inaugurated ac
cording to that constitution. What is there
to fear? Congrests will be against him. If he
violates his oath, violates the constitution, or
makes war upon the rights of any section or
anybody he can be impeached, for the Senate
still enjoys the confidence of the country. He
again exhorted his friends not to indulge in re
crimination ; to lot bygones bs bygones, rnd to
unite for the preservation of the Union. He
concluded by saying that on Monday he :hould
resume his scat in the Senate, without prejudice
or ill feeling towards anyone except the foes of
his country."
Judge Douglas was repeatedly cheered en
thusiastically. Judge Do.iglas having concluded, thocowd,
learning that the Hon. John Young Brown, of
Kentucky, was present having, called to see
Judge Douglas, vociferously calk-d for hira.
Mr. Brown, on being introduced, apologized
for bis inability to address them, having jut
got to the city, after traveling several days and
nights, incessantly. He, however, entertained
the crowd with a "few patriotic and Union-loving
remark?.
After leaving the r".idence of Judge Doug
las' the crowd repaired to Brown's Hotel,
where lion. John A. McCIernand was stop
png who, being called out, addressed them
saying.
Gf.stlesixn : Only having arrived in th ci
ty to-day, and claiming nothing of pulic con
sideration, either for what T am or for what I
have rlone, I am equally surprised and comple
mented by this demonstration of numbers and
music on so inclement anight. For seventeen
years it has ben my fortune to visit this city
at cons it 1ti3n.il intervals, as a representative
of a portion of the people of Illinois, and
throughout that protracted period I have al
ways been kindly- and hospitably treated by
you. for which, as well as for the honor of this
eail. I b-g to return to yo.i rav grateful ac-

Dear Prorfsst "Would roa liks to hear
something of boV taatters a:id things crc pro
gressing in the city of oaks ? If so, heru goc-a
for a page or two of g-ussip :
In the Hr it place, .f course, I xcasl s;cJc c-T
the Lrg'slature rnd its doin;5. W!l, it is
about the soberest body of legislators that have
met in Raleigh since my remembrance, wiv.-jh
fact is good "ground upon which to base the
hope that the acts and doings of the present
session will be such as shall tend to tha gene
ral good. The booy embraces all shades of
sentiment on federal affairs, from the most ra
pacious G re-cater. down to the most conserva
tive of consLrvativcs, as is manifest frctn trio
tone cf thu two or three dozens of resolutions
that have been ollured in the two houses in re
lation to federal matters. It is, I think, a rea
sonable guess to lay down the f blowing as tho
prevailing sentiment of a majority of tne l-a?-cembled
"wisdom " in this city: That North
Carolina should assume n conservative position,
neither rushing into secession or revolution fur
existing causes, nor, on the other hand, soo
mitting to any aggression on her rights by a
Republican administration, should aggression
be attc -opted ; but to be placed in an attitude
to act uK-'Ctivtly in any '.uicrgcncy. The idea,
of immediate secession on account of Lincoln's
elecli n, is, I think, daily becoming wcr-ker,
and the conservative element is daily augment
ing in strength
In the Smite tc-.lay but little was done, and,
that body adjourned at an cariy hour. In tho
House ot Commons, some little animation was
manifested in a discussion on a resoluti- n lath
er censnirng the public printer, Mr. Spelmau,
lor his tardiness m printing certain documents
ordered to be planted. The matter was finally
adjusted by the passage of a resolution and ap
pointment of a joint committee of both houses
to superintend tho public printing.
During the discussion of the resolution and
amendments, Mr. Fjgg, cf Madison, gave rise,
by the transposition of the words of a quota
tion he attempted to moke from the 11 book of
old sayings" to considerable merriment. He
was accusing the opposition of making an effort
to draw party lines on the question under dis
cussion, instancing some of the acts of mem
bers, and said that "the wind shows which way
the straw blows," an explosion followed v. hi oh
wa silenced by the Speaker's hammer.
The Grand Lodge of Masons commences its
session here this evening, and I guess will bo
very fully att 2 nded, judging by the large num
ber of delegates from subordinate Lodge.-: -hat
have arrived in the city to-day.
Should anything change to "turn up," I wiil
gi.eyou the earliest inoi-maliou thereof that
the mails will brinp, and .whetb'r r.rytl.ing
turns up or not. I wiii drcp you 11 lr-'-. every
