The President's Message
"Social justice comes first": this is the key
note of President Wilson's message to the Sixty
third Congress which went into regular session
last Monday, a document that maintains the
high standards of simple and lucid language so
characteristic of his utterances.
We are moving toward world peace, he says
in substance, and the United States is rightfully
in the lead. If we wish for a standard by which
to test all arbitration and treaty making we
have it in "Our own honor and our obligation to
the peace of the world."
But a great menace to our peace lies in that
cloud which has long hung over Mexico. Vic
toriano Huerta is but a pretender at best and
has lately come forth boldly as a mere dictator.
Urrtil he is eliminated, Mexico can have no peace.
We have adopted the policy of "watchful wait
ing." Developments have justified this attitude
and we may confidently expect to see this un
just dictatorship crumble of its own weight.
Meanwhile we have urgent problems of our
own, foremost at this time among which is the
currency question. It is necessary that every
other matter be laid aside by Congress that both
bodies may concentrate all their energies on
this.
That done the next necessary step will be to
arrange to give farmers some adequate form of
credit. The producers of our food are necessary
above all others, yet they do not stand on an
equal footing in the credit market with the for
ester and the miner. Of course we shall grant
them no special privileges, but we must give
them their due. We have long lagged behind
European nations in this, but the Congressional
Committee appointed some time since to inquire
into foreign methods of agricultural credits is
about ready to report and will then enable us,
doubtless, to frame suitable legislation.
But the large task confronting us is the fur
ther prevention of monopoly. The Sherman law
should stand, but the debatable ground that sur
rounds it must be reduced by more specific legis
lation. This is so important a problem a special
message will be needed concerning it.
The President then speaks in behalf of the
direct nomination of candidates for the presi
dency. He believes that political conventions
should be held after nomination and should in
clude all those candidates who are made respon
sible in carrying out a party's platform.
The executive message then sweeps out to our
insular possessions and lays down the doctrine
that we are not owners, but trustees of these is
lands and that our policy should make steady
progress towards their full and complete self
government.
Alaska, also, needs attention and should be
given a well rounded territorial government.
Means for supplying an outlet to her vast stores
of minerals must also be found: for this a gov
ernment built and operated railway is best fitted.
Also steps must be taken to prevent private mo
nopolizing and exploitation of Alaskan resources.
His special recommendations covered a plea
for a more adequate equipment of the Bureau of
Mines, for a railway employers' liability act, and
for measures looking to safety at sea.
He closes by congratulating Congress on its
energy and its progressive spirit and promises
his own hearty co-operation in all these matters
of importance to the nation.
Former-President Roosevelt was greatly
pleased with a cartoon exhibiting a work-worn
farmer reading "his favorite book" a copy of
the president's message. We believe the same
farmer and all the rest of us besides will take as
much pleasure in this present message as in any
preceding ones.
TheS erpent's Tongue
Here's a story from Kansas City.
A certain man came home from a hunting
trip, found that a personal friend while at a par
ty held in his own home had kissed his wife,
sharpened up his knife with calm deliberateness.
walked across the street to this friend's home,
stabbed him to death, and is now confined in a
prison cell.
A thrilling story, is it not? and food for the
dime novelists.
But here's the key to the situation: "But one
of the women who was there had to tell all about
it. She told someone and they told someone else
and it got into the shop where Mr. C works.
There a man gossiped too and he told Mr. C ."
This is a fragment from the story told by the
unfortunate murderer's wife before the coroner's
jury. In her account the facts were divulged
which were like this:
She was entertaining a few friends and neigh
bors oneevening to while away the long hours
during her husband's vacation. It happened
that one of the men had been drinking and at
tempted to kiss her. It was about this the wom
an told. The wife refrained from telling her
husband for fear he might, because of the sting
of the insult, attempt violence.
"But one of the women who was there had to
tell all about it. . . . A man gossiped, too."
And by the time the story reached the hus
bai:! the tale had become so twisted he was told
his dearest friend and neighbor had vilely in
cited his wife. And the man killed his friend.
A Matter of Teeth
Everything about the human animal from the
tip of his hair to the toes of his foot is receiving
the attention of savants and the offices of a con
vention. Therefore we are not surprised to learn
of the deliberations of a conference in Toledo in
which, for the forty-eighth time, the Ohio State
Dental society is endeavoring to preach the gos
pel of good teeth.
In view of the conditions there revealed, forty-eight
more conventions will be needed prop
erly to attend to the dentition of the Buckeye
state. The school children of that great com
monwealth, according to the doctors, are in a bad
way, fully one-half having defective teeth. So
serious is this condition it is estimated that these
defectives require, on an average, one-half year
longer to pass the first eight grades than sound
youngsters.
This means that dental caries is an imme
diate economic issue in any state where there
may be this loss of school time. If we estimate
that every child costs per school year thirty dol
lars, and that, we imagine, is below the level, it
costs the state for every 5,000 defective children
$75,000. That sum would more than pay for
proper care of the teeth even if the state were
to receive no more benefit than the saving in
school xpenses.
But it would receive returns far greater than
that. Teeth are a national asset. Dental caries
is one of the first evidences of racial decay.
When the teeth go, all other maladies are close
behind. Dr. Osier, often spoken of as America's
greatest physician, has said, "If I were to select
any one point in personal hygiene more import
ant than any other, I should unhesitatingly se
lect the care of the teeth. Bad teeth means dis
eased organs sooner or later and that in turn
means decreased vitality, low efficiency and un
happiness." Bad teeth are a handicap in every way. They
serve as breeding grounds for all manner of bac
teria; they make difficult thorough mastication
of food, so essential to good health; they give
one a malodorous breath; they spoil one's good
looks, and transform the mouth into a sewage
sink.
The necessary thing, of course, is right train
ing of children. We grownups are too far gone
to be able to do much with ourselves. But to
fix in a child the invariable habits of mouth hy
giene is to do for it a service of inestimable
worth. It is just as important to send the little
ones regularly to the dentist as to send them to
Sunday-school.

A Slap at Prudishness
"Damaged Goods" did not everywhere meet
with the same cordial reception accorded it in
Richmond. Here and there in some particularly
vicious community prudery got the upper hand
and much was said in the interests of "indignant
virtue." We wish all these prudes would chance
to light on the following poem; it would show
them a thing or two:
TABOO !
By BERTON BR A L E Y
You may put on a show that is full of suggestion
And subtle appeal to the sense,
And no one will murmur or mutter a question
But simply remark, "It's immense!"
You may crowd it with girls in the filmiest dresses
Or almost no garments at all,
And have them perform all the latest excesses
Of "bunnyhug," "grizzly" and "crawl."
You may hold up the truth as a subject for laughter,
Make vice look attractive and gay,
Give praise to the rounder, the crook and the grafter
And no one will whisper you nay;
But put on a play that is truthful and vital
In showing the wages of sin,
A speedy arrest is your certain requital
With plenty of newspaper din!
You may cover debauchery thinly with glamor
And no one will utter a word,
But strip off the veil, and the raucous-voiced clamor
Of "Indignant Virtue" is heard!
So put on your shows that are daintily shady,
Where vice wears her pleasantest mien,
But shun, shun the Truth she's a very nude lady
And therefore should never be seen!
From Harper's Weekly.
