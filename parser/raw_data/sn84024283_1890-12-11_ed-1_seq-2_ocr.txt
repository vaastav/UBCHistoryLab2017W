Houses.
Washisgiox, Dec L Promptly at
soon boih houses of Congress were
SiIIed to order, in the presence of
large and interested crowds of specta
tors. Numerous Coral emblems deco
rated the desks o faTorei Senators and
Representatives, and there was a merry
Cow of badinage over the results of the
lata elections.
TLe preliminary business having been
transacted, which consisted in adminis
tering the oath to a few new Senators
and members, the usual committees
were appointed to wait upon the Presi

in fusion and ready to receive any
communication he might be pleased to
At 1:30 p. m. Private Secretary Hal

and presented the Presideni'3 annual
message which was at cue 5 read. A

The message is as fellows:

Tiie vast and ixicreasiEsr business of the
Government has been transacted t-v the sev
eral departments iar;a tne vesu- witti f ji.tix
iuiness, energy and success! Ifce revenue,
amounting to above HOOJMMj.VX), has been col
lected and disbursed without revealing:, so
far as I can ascertain, a sinsrle case of de
f ak-at ion or embezzlement. An earnest
effort has been made to stimulate a sense of
responsibility and public duty is ail oScers
aca employes of every prade," and tbe work
lone by them has almost wholly escaped un
favorable criticism. I speak of these matters
with freedom, because the credit of this
food work is not mine, but is shared by the
heads of the several departments with tne
great body of faithful oJEeers and emploves
who serve under them. The closest serutlav
of Congress is invited to ail the methods of
the Administration, and to every item of ex
penditure. FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The friendly relations of our counrrv with
the nations of Europe and of the Kast have
been undisturbed, while the ties of eood will
and common interest that bind us to the
states of the Western Hemisphere have been
notably strengthened by the conference held
in this capital to consider measures for the
general welfare.

The International Marine Conference
which met at Washina.n last winter
reached a very eratifyinsres'-It. The reg-u-lations
sujrir eted have been brought to the
attention of all the Kovemroents represent
ed, and their general adoption is confidents
expected. The legislation of Coneress it
the last session is in conformity with the
fropos;ti.iis of the conference, arid tteproc

when the other powers have given notice of
.their adhesion.
TBE CS1ZILIAS REFtTBUC
Toward the end of the past year the onlv
-Independent monarchical government on the
Western continent, that of Braz.i, ceased to
exist and was succeeoed by a republic. Iip
Jomatie relations were at once established
with the new government, but it was not
-completely recoernized until an opportnnitv
had been afforded to ascertain tnat it had
popular approval and support. When the
course cf events had yielded assurances of
this fact, no time was lost in eitendine the
new government a full and cordial welcome
into the family of American commonwealths.
THE CESTBAi AMERICAN TROUBLES.
The peace of Central America has again
btn disturbed through a revolutionary
-change in Salvador, wnicb was not recog
nized by other States, and hostilities broke
out between Salvador and Guatemala, threat --en
i jig to involve all Central America in con
flict, and to undo the progress which had
been made toward a union of interests. The
-efforts of this uovernment were promptlv
and zealously exercised to compose tnei'r
differences, and through the active efforts of
tbe representative of the United states a
provisional treaty of peace was signed Au
guAt 'X, whereby the r.gbt of the republic of
Salvador to choose its own rulers was recog
nized. General Eseta, the Chief of the Pro
vmional Government, has since been con
firmed in the presidency bv the Assembly
AJ diplomatic recognition duly followed.
THE KHXISO OF BARKUXDIA-
" The killing of General Ttarrundiaon board
"tbe Pacific Mail Steamer Acapulco. while an
chored en transit in the port of tan Jose de
Guatemala, demanded careful inquiry. Hav
ing failed in a revolutionary attempt to in
vade Gautemala from Mexican territory
General Barrandia took passage at Acapulco
Cor I'anama. The consent of the representa
tives of the United States was sought to
effect his seizure, first at Champrico. where
tiie steamer touched, and afterwards at San
Jom. The captain of the steamer refused to
give up his passenger without a written or
der from the I'nited Mates Minister:
the latter furnished the desired
letter. stipulating as the conditions
of his action, that General Barrundia's life
: should be spared and that he should be tried
only for offenses grow in gout of his insurrec
tionary movements. This letter was pro
- -daced to the captain of the Acapulco by the
military commander at San Jos as his war
rant to take the passenger from the steamer.
-General Barrundia resisted capture and was
.killed. It being evident that the Minister,
.Mr. Mizner, had exceeded the bounds of his
.authority in in.rvening. in compliance with
the demands of tbe Guatemalan authorities,
to authorize and effect, in violation of prece
dent, the seizure on a vessel of the United
states of a passenger in transit charged with
political ofienses. in order that he uiiaht be
held for such offenses under what was de--eribed
as martial law, I was constrained to
-diMvo Mr. Mizner' s act and recall him from
-bis post.
THE MCARAGUA CANAL PROJECT.
The Xicaraena canal project, under the
control of our citizens, is making the most
-encouraging progress, all the preliminary
-conditions and initial operations having been
. accomplished within the prescribed time.
THE CHILIAN CLAIX.
During the year negotiations have been re
newed lor tile settlement of the claims of
American citizens aa-amst the Government
f Chili, principally growinz out of the late
war with Peru. The reports from ourMrn.s
ter at Santiago warrant the expectation of an
early and satisfactory adjustment.
CEtSA.
Our relations with China, which have for
several ve&re occupied (-- important a place
in our diplomatic history, have cailed for
careful consideration and haveteen the sub
ject of much correspondence. Tbec'mmuni
cations of tbe Chinese Minister have brought
into view the whole subject of our conven
tional relations with his country ; and at tbe
same time this Government, through its lega
tion at lYkin. has sought to arrange various
matters and complaints tonehicg the inter
ests and protections of our e tizens ;n China.
In persuar.ee of the concurrent resolution of
October 1, l!CJ. I have proposed to the Gov
ernment of Mexico, ani Gieat Br.tain, to
consider a conventional regulation of the
passing of Chinese laborers across our south
.ern and northern frontiers.
FRANCE.
Our relations with the French republic
continue to t cordial. Our representative
at that court has very diligently urtred the
removal of the restrictions imposed upon our
meat products, and it is bel.eved that sub
etantial prosress has been made uj wards a
Just M'tUement.

DA WAIT AXD TEE M'KISXET BILL.
In the Tariff act a wrong was done to the
Kingdom of Hawaii which I am bound to pre

levied on certain commodities which are in
cluded in the reelprocitv treaty now exietins
between the Uniu-d States and the Kingdom
of Hawaii without indicating tbe tiec-t-ssarv

The revision of our treaty relations with
the empire of Japan has continued to be the
subject of cons.deral.on and of correspond
ence. The ouestions involved are both
grave and deiic-ate; and. while it will be my
duty to see that the interests of the United
States are not by any changes exposed to
undue discrimination, I sincerely hopetnat
such revision as will satisfy the legitimate
expectations of the Japanese Government
and maiiita.n the present and long-existing
friendly relations between Japan and the
United s-tates will be effected.
MEXICAN AJTATES.
The friendship between our eountrv and
Mexico, bora of close neishboriiood and
strengthened by many considerations of in
timate intercourse and reciprocal interest,
has never been more conspicuous than now.
nor more hopeful of increased benefit to both
nations. The intercourse of the two coun
tries by rail, already great, is making con
stant grawth.
B.ELATIONS WITH SPAT.V.
The c-rdia: character of our relations with
Spain v. irrants the hope that by the contin
uance f methods of friendlv "negotiation,
much i ybe accomplished in the direction
of an a ustment of pending questions and of
the in ease of our trade. The extent and
develo- -nent of our trade with the island of
Cuba i: . est the commercial relations of the
United -rates and Spain with a peculiar im
portant e. It is not doubted that a special ar
ransej t-nt in reeard to commerce, based
upon: ;e reciprocity provision of the recent
Tariff ct. would c'perate most beneficiaiiv
for bo i governments. This subject is now
receiv .inattention.
JOH3T EEIC-sOS.
The - storation of the remains of John
Erics-- n to Sweden afforded a cr-atifving occasion-to
honor the memory of the e'reat in
vent ; . to whose genius our countrv owes so
much, .nd to bear witness to the unbroken
frien -hip wh.cli has existed between the
land "bich bore him and our own, which

THE VENEZUELAN CLAIMS.
On 'ie 2d of September last the commission
sppo nted to revise the proceedings of the
Clain convention between the United States
and nezuela of lVi brought its labors to a
close ' ithin the period fixed for that pur
pose. The proceedings of the late commis
sion v ere characterized by a spirit of impartiality--
and a hieh sense of just.ee. and ji in
cidei -. which was for many year the subject
of d -cussion between tbe "two government-,
has I - en disposed of in a manner alike hon
orable and satisfactory to both parties.
THE CONSULAR SEEVTCE.
The legislation of thepat few -ears has
evinced on the part of Contrre a growing
realization of the importance of the consular
service in fostering our commercial relations
abroad and in protecting the domestic rev
enue. A s the Konpe of operations expands,
increased provision must be made to keep up
the essential standard of efSciencv. The
necessity of some adequate measure of super
vision and inspection has been so often pre
sented that I need only commend the subject
to your attention.
ETNANCIAL-
The revenues of the Government from all
sources for the fiscal vear endine June 30,
Kj. were UttX2.(XZ&, and tbe "total ex
penditures for the same period were fciiS.6i5.

of these agereeates, and for the pur
pose of comparison the sum of Vo.J82 ."XT .92

account. The surplus for the year, includ
ing the amount applied to the sinking fund,
was Jloe.JM.tiC.ClS. The receipts for W were

EECEIrTS AND EXFE5TrrTEES.
The Treasury statement for the current
fiscal year, partly actual and partly estimat

TUKCH ASE OF SILVER BCLLION1.
The act "dire tine the purchase of silver
bullion and the issue of Treasury notes
thereon." approved June 14. I".', ha- been
administered bv the Secretary of the Treas
ure with an eirn st purpose to get into cir
culation at the earliest possible dates the full
monthly attiounts of Treasury notes contem
plated bv its provisions, and at the sane
time to give to th market for silver bullion
suc h support as the law contemplates. The
!-- Lit depreciation in the price of sil
ver has been observed w ,th resrrtt.
The rapid rise in price which antici
pated and followed the passage of tne
act was influenced in some degree hy specu
lation, and tne recent reaction is in part the
result of the same cause and in part of the
rteent monetary di-tunances. Some montiis
of further trial will be necessary to deter
minethe permanent effect of the recent l-iris-lation
upon s.iv.-r values, but it is :rratify;i!ir
to know tht the increased circulation se
cured bv the act has exerted and will cont inue
to exert a more beneficial influence upon
business and upon general values.
THE EittM FINANCIAL TLrilET.
The rceiit monetary disturbances in En
gland are not unlikely to suggest a re-exam-
ination of opinions upon tn:s suojecr. uar
verv large suppiv of gold will, if not lost by
impulsive legislation in the supposed interest
of silver, give us a position of advantasre in
pr:moting a p-rmanent and sale interna
tional agre-ment for the free use of silver as
a coin met ah
CIECTXATIOX OF MONET.
The efforts of the Secretary to increase the
volume of monev in circulation by keeping
down the treasury surp. us to tne lowest prac
tic-able limit have been unrem tt.ng. ana in a
rprr high degree successf ul. I he taies pre-
sented bv him. showing the increase o
inoaev in'cireulation during the past two de
cades" and espe-cially the table stowing the
increase during the eightee-n months he has

are interesting and instruct. ve. The in
crease of monev in circulation dur

THE r-OsT-OFFICK IFABTME5T.
The report of the Postmaster-Gener-al
stow? the most grat.fy;ng progress in the
import ir,t work committed to fcis direction.
The bus.hess methods have been greatly
improved. A large economy in expend f
tures and an increase of $4.7K(.
in receipts have been realized. The

THE ANTI-LOTTEKT LAW.
The passage of the act to amend certain
sections of the Reried Statutes relating to
lotteries, approved September 1?. 1W, has
been received with great and deserved pop
ular favor. The Post-Office Department and
the Department of Justice at once entered
upon the enforcement of tbe law with
sympathetic vigor, and already the public
ma.- have been largely freed from the
fraudulent and demoralizing appeals and
literature emanating from the lottery com
panies. THE 3SAVT.
The construct ion and equipment of the new
ships for the navy have made very sat isfac
tory progress. Since March 4. Is". nine new
vessels have been put in commission, and
during this winter four more, including one
monitor, will be added. The construction of
the other vessels authorized is beins pushed,
both in the Government and private yards,
with energy, and watched with the most
scrupulous "care.
ASM OR PLATES.
The experiments conducted during the
year to test the relative res. sting power of
armor plates have been so valuable as to at
tract great attention in Europe. The only
part of the work upon the new ships that is
threatened by unusual delay is the armor
plating, and every effort is being made to re
duce that to the minimum. It is a source
of congratulation that the anticipated in
fluence" of these modern vese!s upon
the esprit du corps of the officers and
seamen has been fully realized. Con
fidence and pride in the ship among
the crew are quiva!ent to a secondary bat
tery. Your favorable consideration Is in
vited to the recommendations of the Secre
retarv. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
exhibit wah great fullness and clearness
the vast work of that department and the
sat.sfactory" results attained. The sugges
tions marie" by him are earnestly commended
to ti-e confederation of Congress, though
tney can not ail be g.ven particular mention
here.
The several acts of Congress looking to the
reduction of the larger Indian reservations,
to the more rapid settlement of the Indians
upon individual allotments and the restora
tion to the public domain of lands in excess
of their needs, have been largely carried into
effect so far as the work was eon
fined to the Executive. Agreements have
been concluded since March 4.
involving the cession to the United
States of about lt.TX.VM acres of land.
THE PUBLIC IKMAI
The policy ou'lined in my last annual mes
sage in relation to the patenting of lands to
settlers upon the public domain has been car
ried out in the administration of the Land
Office. No general suspicion nor imputation
of fraud has been allowed to delay the hear
ing and adjudication of individual cases
upon their merits.
rKSSTOiNS-
The Disabilitv Pension act, which was ap
proved on the 27th of Jane last, has been put
into operation as rapidly as was practicable.
The increased clerical force as provided was
selected and assigned to work, and a consid
erable part of the force engaged in examina
tions in the field was recalled and added to
the working force of the office. The ex
amination and adjudication of claims have,
by reason of improved methods, been
more rap-.d than ever before. There is
no economv to the Government In delay,
while there "is much hardship and injustice
to the soldier. The anticipated expenditure,
while verv large, willnot.it is believed, be
in excess of the estimates made before the
enactment of the law. This liberal enact
ment of the general law should suggest a
more careful scrutiny of bills for special
relief, both as to the cases where relief i
granted and as to the amount allowed.
THE KOESOSJ.
The Increasing numbers and influence of
the non-Mormom population in Utah are ob
served with great satisfaction. The recent
letter of Wilford Woodruff, president of the
Mormon church, in which he advised h;s
peopleto refrain from contracting any mar
riage forbidden by the laws of the land."' has
attracted wide attention, and it is hoped that
it inf.uence will be highly beneficial in re
straining infractions of the law of the United
states. But the fact should not be over
looked that the doctrine or belief of
the church that polvgamons murriags j
are rightful and supported by Divine r-vela- j
tion remains unchanged. President Wood- j
mff does not re nounce the doctrine, but re- j
frain from teaching it. and advises against j
the Practice of it because the law is against j
it. Sow. it is quite true that the law should j
not attempt to dexfi with the faith or belief i
of anv one: but it is quite another thins, and j
the oii'v s.i'c thing, so to deal with the T-r- i
r-torv t'f Utah as that those who believe:
poly irtmy to be r.chtful. shall not have the j
power to" make it iawful. j

PEI AETMENT OF AGIlICrLTURE-
The re-port of the Secretary of Agriculture
deserves specinl attention." in view of the

! tion among the f".:m.er. looking to an in

i ai be found that the efJorss of the depart-
i n;e-nt have been inteii g-ntiv and zealousiv
d voted to the promotion of the interests
intru-ted to its cure. A very sub
stantial improvemerit in the "market
prices in the leading farm prod

price "of wheat advanced from SI e e-nts in

CATTLE INSPECTION.
The efforts of the Secretary to establish the
healthfulness of our meats against the dis

mercial success. The area "over which the
sugar beet can be succesf ally cultivated is
very large, and another field'crop of great
value is offered to the choice of the farmer.
TEE CIVTL-SESV1CE LAW.
The law relating to the civil service has, so
far as I can learn, been executed by those
having the power of aprxintment in the
classified service with ndeiitv and impar- i
tialitv. and the service has been increasingly j
satisfactory. The report of the commission f
shows a large amount of good work done '
during the vear with verv limited arnropria- i
tions."
LEGISLATION.
I congratulate the Congress and the courtry
upon the passage at the first session of the
Fifty-first Congress of an unusual number of
laws of verv high imnortance. That the re-
suits of this legislation will be the .juickening I
and enlargement of our manufacturing
dustries. larger and better iriarEets for our
breadstuffs and provision both at home and
abroad, more con-t int etnplovment and bet
ter wages for fmr working people, and an
increased supply f a safe" currency for the
transaction of business. I do not doubt
some ef the- mi-.c-urc-s w re en.ic-t'.-d at s'
late a period thit the beneficial effects upon
commerce which were ia the contemplation
e-f Congress h,ve as ye I but partially mani
fested then-selves.
TitAKE AT INTiUSTST.
The genera! trade and industrial conditions
throughout the country during the year have
shown a roark'-d improvement l"r many
vears prior to iss-the merchandise balances
of foreign trade had been largely in our fa
vor, but in that year nd the year fol
lowing thev turned airaiiist u. It is very
gratifying to know that the last fiscal year
agam'shows a balance in our favor f over
S.-j.lt. The bank clearing-, which fur
nish a good test of the volume of business
transaete-d for the first ten months of the
year KKi shew, as compared with tbe same
"months of 3 -(si, an increase for tbe whole
country eif about fc.4 per cent, whiie tbe in
crease "outside of th city of New York was
ove r 13 per e-ent. During'the mont h of Octo
ber the oleariugs of the whole country
showed an increase of 3.1 per cent, over
October, l, while outside ot New
Tork the increase was 111 per cent. These
figures sht-w that the increase in the volume
of business was verv general throughout the
country. That this "large business was being
conducted upon a safe and profitable basis
is shown by the fact that there were three
hundred less failure reported in October.
lfj. than in the same month of the preced
ing vear, with liabilities diminished by about
EXPORTS.
The value of our exports of domestic mer
chandise during the last year was tiver JiiS.
(Mf.i.V) greater than the preceding year, and
was onlv exceeded once in our history. About
$i''."yi.iiO of this excess was in agricultural
prcducts. The production of pig iron al
ways a good gauge of general prosperitv is
shown by a recent census bulletin to have
been 253 "per ce-nt. greater in than in
lX and tbe production eif steel 2X) per cent,
greater. Mining in e-oal has had no limita
tion except that resulting from deficient
transportation. The general testimony i
that labor is everywhere fully employed. aTiS
the reports for the last vear show a smaller
number of employes affected by strike? sni
l )ck-out- than in" any year since 14. The
derres:on in the price-s of agri
cultural troducts had been greatly
relieved and a buoyant and hope
ful tone was beginning to be felt by ail
our people. The-se promising influence
have been in some degree chee ked by the
surprising and very unfavorable monetary
events which have recently takn place in
England. It is gratifying to know tibat
these did not grow "in "any degree out
of the financial relations" of London
with our people, or out of any dis
credit attae-hed to emr securities" held
in that market. The return of our bonds and
stocks was cause-d by a money stringency in
England, not by any" loss of value or cred it
in the securities themselves. We could not,
however, wholly escape the ill effects
of a foreign monetary agitation, accom
panied by such extraordinary incidents as
characterized this. It is not believed, how
ever, that these evil incidents, which have
for the time unfavorably affected values in
this country, can long withstand the strong,
safe and wholesome- influences which are
operating to give our people profitable re
turns in all branches of legitimate trade and
industry. The apprehension that our tariff
mat again and at once be submitted to im
portant general change, would undoubtedly
add a depressing influence of the most se
rious character."
TITE M'KFNLET TARIFF.
The General Tariff act has only partially
gone into operation, some of its important
provisions being limited to take effect at
dates vet in the future. The general pro
visions" of the law have been in force less
than sixtv days. Its permanent effeot on
trade and prices still stand in conject
ure. It is curious to note that the
advance in the price of articles whol
Iv unaffected bv the Tariff act was
by many hastily ascribed to that
act. Notice was ntJt takea of the fact that
the general tendency of the markets was up
ward from influences whollv apart from the
recent tariff legislation. The enlargement
of our currency by the Silver bill undoubtly
gave an upward tendencv to trade and hafi a
marked effect on prices; but this natural and
desired effect of tae silver iigisiation was bv
many erroneusly attributed to the Tariff
TAP.IIT REVISION.
There is neither wisdom nor suggestion
that the subject of tariff jevision shall be
opened before this law has had a fair trial.
It is quite true that everv taritf schedule is
subject to objections. No bill was ever
framed. 1 suppose, that in all of its rates and
classifications had the full approval even of
a party caucus. Such legislation is always
and necessarily the product of compromise
as to details." and the present law is no
exception. But. in its general scope
and effect. I think, it will Justify the sup
port tf those who believe that American leg
islation should -onserve and defend Amer
ican trade and the wages of American work
men. The misinformation as to the terms of the
act. which has been so widely disseminated
at home and abroad, will be corrected by ex
perience and the evil auguries as to its results
ce.nfounded by the market reports, the sav
ings banks. irternatitnal trade balances and
the general prosperty of our people. Already
we tiegin to hear from abroad and from
our custom-houses that the prfihibitory effect
upon importations imputed to the act is net
just tied. The imports at the port of New
York ior the lir-t three weeks of November
were neariv s jr e-ent. greater than for the
same per.oci in Is-y and 29 per cent- greater
tiiaji in the same period of lss. And so far
troui being an act to limit exports, I conn
u ntiv bel'eve tbat under it we shall secure a
larger and more proiltable participation in
foreign trade than we have ever enjoyed, and
thut we shall recover a proportionate par-t.c-ipation
:n the ocean carrying trade of the
world.
IKoHIP.nOET OR EETAL1ATOST LEGISLATION.
There is no disposition among any of our
people to promote prohibitory or retaliatory
fejiisl-ation. Our pol icies are adopted net to
the hurt of others, but to secure for ourselves
those advantages that fairly grow out ef our
favored position as a nation. Our foraj of
govemn-ent. with its incident of universal
fuffrage, makes it imperative that we shall
save our working peeple from the agitations
and distresses which scant work and wages
that have no margin for comfort always
get. But afcr all this is done, it will be
found that our markets are open to friendly
commercial exchanges of enormous value
to the othe r great l'o wers.
feECTPKOCrTT.
There were but two methods of obtaining
control of this question open to Congress:
To place all these art.cles upon the dutiable
list subject to such treatv agreements as-
could be secured. or to place them all pres
ent'.v upon the free list, but subject to the re
inipbsition of specified duties if the coun
tries froni whicn we receive them should re
fuse to give u.- suitable reciprocal benefits.
This latter method, I think, possesses- great
advantages. It expresses in advance
the consent of Congress to reciprocity ar-
rangvments aSectiitg these products- which
must have e tiit-rw ise oeen delayed anA un
ascertained until each treaty was ratified by
the Se n jte and the necessary legislation en
acted by Concrv-s. Experience has shown
that some tri-aiies looking U reciprocal

in the Senate for

is more than an otlc-r. i.'iir part of the bar
gain is complete; cleiivery iias been made,
and when the countries from which we re
ceive sugar, coSc-e, teas and hides, have
placed on the ix free lists such ci our products
as shall be agreed upon, as an equivalent for
our c ncession. a proclamation of that fact
completes the transaction ; and in the mean
time our own people have free sugar, tea,
coffee and hides.

TEE INTXENATIONAL-ASSEEICA5 BANK.

of the incorporation of an international
American bank, with a view to facilitating
money exchange between the states repre-
sented in that conference-. Such an institu

EELIEF FOR THE SUPREME COUBT.
The bill for the relief of the Supreme Gonrt
has, after many years of discussion, reached
a position when "final action is easily attain
able, and it is hoped that any differences of
opinion may be so harmejnized as to save the
essential features of this very important
measure. In this connection I earnestly re
new my recommendation that the salarfes of
the Judges of the United States I'lstrie
courts be so readjusted that none of then
shall receive le?ss than S5,o:9per annum.
A NATIONAL BANKKL FT LAW.
The enactment of a National bankrupt law
I still regard as very desirable. Tbe Constitu
tion having given to Congress jurisdiction of
this subject, it sbotald be exerc.sed and uni
form rules provided for the administration of
insolvent debtors. The inconveniences re
sulting from the occasional and temporary
exercise of this power by Congress, and from
the conflicting State e-odes "of insolvency
which come into force intermediately should
be removed bv the enactment of a simple, in
expensive and permanent National bankrupt
law.
INTERNATIONAL COPTRIOBT.
I als-'A renew mv recommendation in favor
of leg.slation affording just copyright and
protect icn to foreign authoron a footing ot
reciprocal advantage for our authors,abroad.
TEE ABXD REGIONS.
The subject of the conversion and equal
distribution of the water supply of the arid
regions has had much attention from Con
gress, but has not yet been put upon a per
manent or satisfactory basis. The urgency
of the subiect does hot grow out of any
large present demand for the use of these
lands for agriculture, but out c-f the danger
that the water supply and its sites for
the neeessarv catch" basins may fail
iato the hands of individuals or private
ctrporat)ons and be used to render subserv
ient the large areas dependent upon such
supply.
THE POSTAL TELEGRAPH SCHEME.
The sse tf the telegraph by the Post-Office
repartment as a means for the rapid trans
na.ss.OB of written communications is. 1 be
heve, upon proper terms, quite desirable.
The Government does not own or operate
tbe railroads, and it should not, I think, own
or operate telegraph lines. It does, how
ever, seem to be quite prae-ticable
for the eovernmer.t to contract With
the telegraph companies, as it does
with tne ra.iroad companies to carry at
specified rates such communications
as tbe senders may designate for this method
ef transmission. I recommend that such
legislation le enacted as will enable the
Post-oSSee Iepartment fairlv to test by ex
periment the advantages ol such a use ol
uue teieraph.
ELXCTION LAWS.
If any intelligent and loyal company of
American eitizeas werereeiuired tc e-atalogue
the essential humane ce.nditions of National
life,! dc not doubt that with absolute unanim
ity they would begin with free and honest
elwtioria. And it is gratifying to know gen
erally there s a growing and non-partisan
demand for better election laws. But against
this S'gnof hopeani progress must beset
the depressing and undeniable fact that elec
tion law and methods are sometimes cun
ningly contrived to secure minority control,
while violence completes the shortcomings
of fraud.
In my last annnaj message I suggested that
the development of the exTsting law, provid
ing a Federal supervision of Congressional
elections-, offered an effective method of re
forming these abuses. Tbe need of such a law
has manifested itself in many parts of the
country, and its whoiesome "restraints and
penalties-will be useful m all. The constitu
tionality of such legislatien has been affirmed
by the Supreme Court- Its probable effect
iveness is evidenced by the character of the
opposition that is made to it. It has been
denounced as it it were a new exercise of
Eederal power and an invasion of the rights
of the States. Nothing could be further from
the truth. Congres Las already fixed the
time forthe election of members of Con
gress. It.has declared that votes for mem
bers of Congress most be written or printed
ballots. It . has provided for the appoint
ment by the Circuit Courts in certain cases,
and upon the petition, ot a certain number of
c.tizens' of election supervisors, and made it
their duty to supervise the registration of
voters conducted by tbe State officers; to
challenge persons- offering to register; to
personally inspect and scrutinize the
registry "lists-, and to affix their names
to the lists for the purpose of identi
fication and the prevention of frauds; to at
tend at elections and remain with the boxes
till the ballots-are Cottateel; to attach to tbe
registry lists and eiecbon returns any state
ment touching the accuracy and fairness of
the recistrv and election, and to
take and transmit to the clerk ot
the House of Representatives any evi
dence of fraudulent practices which may
be presented, to them. The same law
provides for the appointment of Deputy
United Mates mrsluu to attend at the polls,
support the supervisors in the discharge of
their duties and to arrest persons violating
the election I.iws. The previsions of this
familiar titleof the revised statutes have been
put into exercises by bcth the great political
parties, and in the North as well as in the
sHiuth. by the cling with the court of the
petitions rcQUired by law.
The present law stops just a littla
short of e-ffc-e-tivertes. for it surre-nders to
the local authorities all control over the
certification which establishes the prima
facie rtght to a s-at in the House
of Representatives. This defect should
be cured. Equality e.f re-presentatioa .
and the purity of tiKr eie-etors must be main
tained, or every thins; that is valuable in tur
system of efeivernnitit is iost. Thequalifica
tions f an eiwtior must be sought in the
law, not in tiie opinions, prejudices, or fears
of any class, however, powerful. The
path "of the eie-ctcr to the ballot
box must be free from the ambush of fear and
the anticipation of fraud; the count so true
t hat none si is 11 gainsay it. Such a law should
be absolutely rLon-part.s&n and impartial.
It should give the advantage to honesty and
the contrvjl. to majoritie-s. Surely there is
nothing sectional about this creed, and if it.
shall happen that the penalties of iawa-in.
tended to enforce these rights fall here and;
not thcire. it is not because the law issectic " al, .
but becauise. happily, crime is local and not
uiiivers.ih Nor should it be forgotten that
V-very law. whether relating to tiections
or "to any other subject, whethtii
enacned. by " the State or by tbe Nar
tion.. has force behind it. The courts,
the marshal or constable, the posse
comitatus. the prison, are all and always-be-h,ni
the law. one can not be justly
charged ith unfriendliness to any stsctiou
or cLiiS-who seek onlv to re-strain violations
of la. and of personal right. No cominmi'ty
will hud lawlessness profitable. No commu
nity can afford to have it known thtt the
officers who are charged wth the pres
ervation of ihe public peace and
the restraint of the criminal class-
are themselves product of fraud or
violence. The magistrate is- then witauct
respect and the law without, sanction Xne
floJis of lawlessne-ss cannot Ik- leveed, and
made to flow in one channel. The ki!!,rfcs of
n United States marshal carrying a, writ of
arresit for an eie-ctieii offense is fall of
prompting and suggestion to men who
are pursued by "a e-:Ey marshal for
a crime against life cr property.
But it is said tnat this legislation wili revive
race animosities, and sorae have even sug
gested that when the reaceful methods of
fraud are made impossible that they may be
suppla.nted by intimidation and violence. If
the preposd law gives to any qualified
elector by a hair's "veight t"re tfc-tt
his equal infiuence. or detracts by s
much from any other qualified elect

HOW M'KINLEYISM WORKS-
A CcDpirixm Showing the ECects of Be
publicsa Legislation.
Tboujrb MeKinleyism has been routed'
hcrse and foot its evil effects will be "
feit for months to come in lower wares,
bi2"fcer prices lor necessaries of life.
Tl '...I.; . A l rl..MnnoJ
times gnerallT- "in the matter of
wasres.. Keptsnlicans v.-ere assured by
Reed and McKinley, and even by Ben
Harrison, that protection meant more?
work and hisber remuneration and
cheapness was sr.ee red at as the
peculiar bane of American life. Now,
however, the workman finds that there
is less work, lower wages and higher
prices for tbe necessaries of life.
Of the truth of this assertion most
laborers are unfortunately painfully
aware and those who. wing1 to special
ly favorable conditions, baTe not yet
felt tbe evil effects of tbe ill-considered
and dishonest measure known as tbe
McKinley bill, have only to turn to the
news and editorial columns of Repub
lican papers to find abundant confirma
tion of tbe nn wisdom, of tbe chief
measure of Republican leg-islation.
Tfaus the Chicaero Tribune, which
lacked tbe couraEre f its con
victions or- convict&rns for its
co-jrace, and thus gave its usual half
hearted support to the- McKinley bill,
tb other day had half a column of
news headed Developments of tbe last
few days, 'r "Sorce reductions of waes
under the McKinlev bilL" From the
ji s
' 1
dispatches given we- learn that:
The spoolers-in tbe- Merrimac mills
have hai their pay reduced 15 cents
per day, tbe wages of tbe drawinrj-in
girls reduced, and there- is apprehen
sion of "a general cutrdowta" in wages.

This is quite a. respectable list and

Tbe Republican leaders are beginning '
to sens- tfceir party from a new- point of

in tfce past, it is the party of Mc
Kinley and Reed. It has stood an tbe'
way of peacefal progress; it has nursed
sectionalism aai it has raised its voic
for war when the people were ready to
forgive ana forget. It has tried to
tern this-Republic into a plutocracy; it
' has - lo-jte-i tfce psbiic treasury.-and it
has-threatened to perpetuate its-rale
