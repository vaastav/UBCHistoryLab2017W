exceedingly restive at the enforced con

tism in^both hneejoihti. For the past

has for years been subject to infrequent
attacks of this sort,' which usual ly, as
now, located in tendons about the knee
and confine hiui to his room for three or
four dfiys. The present oue is! yielding
to treatment, and will no doubt pass
away in a day or two.
You have heard hundreds of men, when
speaking of Sullivan, say, "He wins by
brute strength," and I have seldom seen
a man who advanced lite truth, which is
that Sullivan is as clever as any man.
His unquestioned ability as to being the
hardest hitter ever seen lias caused the
overlooking of the fast that his blow is
always planted where it will do the most
good, either upon the jaw or jugular
again it is certain that could an adversa­
ry so land his blow, Sullivan v^juld fall
as Quickiey as another, and yet, having
knocked out about GO men. he has never
been harmed*'
The truth is that Sullivan is a careful,
scientific tighter. You haye heard how
John Barleycorn had got the better of
him so that he couldn't stay. The recent
Sun Francisco mill furnished him an
wpponent who for years has been in
training,, that wh.en the occasion offered
he might meet Sullivan in the pink of
condition. Yet the first round saw Ryan
winded, while Sullivan is reported
finishing the battle perfectly fresh. Then
rumor said Sullivan might not stand
punishment. The chances are that
Paddy gave him more than one hard
rap, and yet we find him doing his work
at the finish just like machinery.
Do I think his equal as a pugilist
ever trod the earth? Certainly not. Take
the records of the Englishmen. When­
ever a man was knocked out with the
raw uhseven, ii was considered a iluke,
and don't think that Tom liver, Ned
Price
Or
lis leg/ inflicted a
serious wound. The bird then mdnnted
to the collar Of the infortunate man and
geemed determained to hear himi away
bodily. But just #t this crisiaMi Otbers
Came up and by their united efforts the.
the bird of liberty w*s_ finally copqtie^
and'eecurely pihfioned It was foua,d
that,his wjngs measumh 9 feet and 10
Inches froiBu tip'to tip, and his taio.a^
were orer four iuches lo ng. The places
whercxh^* made the atucfe vim nCaar
when die den of wolves had been, fotuaid
the previous week. The capture of the
eagle goes to explain the (ftctrtbat latley
the iarmers ia the vicinity of kthe
Washburn hojbe- have
John C. Heeneu ever put a man
to sleep. The latter in bis fight with
John Morrisy could Itit his man just as
oue would strike a sand bag, and still
,the latter lasted hn.ir enough Is win the
fight Hoy many times do you think
that Sullivan would have been forced lo
swing his right on such a man as
Morrisy Why, the first round would
have ended the fight. Sullivan has
knocked out 20 or 30 men wilh pillows
on his hancls, and the Roman gladiators
couldn't haul enough with brass
knuckles to end the battle at a single
blow. ,,
Even in imagination the ancients
never conceived such a hittfer as Sullivan.
Achilles, Ajax, and those babies who
were supposably out for the 3tuff, yet
when the gods wished them to win they
furnished a club or a big rock, and old
Sherm Thurston and Dad Ryan'' were
about ri^ht- when, after reciting the
exploits of prize fighters for all time, they
finished with: "John L. Sullivan was
