The Marquis'of Salisbury, the talented
leader of the English Tories, seei some
thing to admire at last in American insti
tutions. In a late speech at E linburgh,
he said: "I confess I do not often envy
the United States, but their institutions
possesses one feature which appears to
me a subject for the greatest, envy name
ly, their magnificent institution of the
supreme court. If their parliament pas
ses a measure inconsistent with the con
stitution of the country there exists a
court which will negative it atonce,thus
giving stability to the instiutions of the
country."
Alexander H. Stephens, the new gov
ernor of Georgia, possesses the quality
of mercy to such a degree as to cause
considerable dissatisfaction already.
Though only a month in office he has
pardoned some thirty or forty cases,
several of these being murderers sen
tenced to the gallows, and two of whom
he had defended on trial. He seems to
forget that it is his duty to execute the
laws and the sentences of duly consti
tuted legal tribunals, rather than to un
duly exhibit that natural quality of mer
cy, which is supposed to belong to com
mon humanity.
The dead letter office at Washington
will soon offer for sale a very large num
ofarticles for which owners have not
been found. The catalogue, which con
tains 250 columns of things to be sold
shows that carelessness has deprived
many thousands of people of presents,
and caused much loss to their intended
benefactors. Had the persons who
mailed them taken the trouble to write
their names and addresses upon them,
they would bave been notified pf the
failure to reach the persons for whom
they were intended, and a small expend
iture in postage would have secured the
turn of the article.
Henry L. Hazen, of the United States
War Department Signal Service, predicts
that the ooming winter will be a mild
one. His predictio; s are based upon a
thorough examination of all indications
in possession of the signal office. Mr.
Hazen, in making this prediction, disre
gards the assertion of meteorologists that
a cool summer is invariably followed by
a oold and etormy winter. But in this
weataer business no man knows what a
day may bring forth. The prophets are
daily confounded by different weather
from what was predicted. There is a
feeling abroad that the winters are grow
ing milder, but it won't do to bank on
thisimpression. A few mild winters may
be followed by severe ones that w ill
make the average the same a9 before.
Extraordinary stories of fortunes ac
quired in hop raising are told by the
people of Central New York. A letter
says that men, women and boys are
pointed out as they pass along the street
as having made fortunes varying from
$1,000 to $100,000 during the post two or
three months. Hop farms have this fall
doubled in value, with ready and even
eager buyers. Many appear to have ac
tually gone daft on the subject and are
laying great plans for another year
Growers have refused to make any con
tracts for next year's crop, even when
offered 50 cents a pound, altbougha lad

in all probability produce a much more
abundant crop next year.
Portland, Oregon, is enjoying great pros
perity and has made remarkable strides
of late in its character as the metropolis
of the Pacific northwest. In 1880 its
population was 23,000, and dose estimates
now place the number of inhabitants at
33,000—an increase of 10,000 in two years.
There were erected during this year 400
structures of every kind, and it is impos
sible to build houses fast enough. In
1881, the sum of $336,000 was spent upon
the thoroughfares; and in the course of
the present year about $500,000 more.
All the important business streets are
paved substantially with Btone bloekB.
The residence streets are macadamized,
and the sidewalks general y c.n in good
condition. Portland's manufacturing
products in 1882 will reach $6,000,000. Its
commercial progress has been very great.
The leading articles of export are wheat,
flour, wool, salmon and hops. As show
ing the colossal increase in the volume
of Columbia river shipments within the
past two year*, it may be mentioned
that the entire value of such shipments
in the year 1880 was $4,318,524, which
does not equal the value of the ship
ments of three months of the present
year. _
There are indications that well organ
ized effort will soon be made in Europe
to divert the current of immigration
from the United States. On the 6th of
January the German Colonization Soci
ety will hold a meeting at Frankfort-on
the-Rbine to devise schemes for the
foundation of German colonies. The
men at the head of this movement are
prominent manufacturers and merchants
who have made a study of the methods
by which other nations have progressed.
They see that England enjoys the profit
able markets of her colonies and that by
fostering the colonial system she has
built np an immense foreign commerce,
and they ask why may not Germany do
the same. The Germans are disposed
to found independent colonies of their
own, but where it is not stated. The
popular feeling is very much in favor of
the scheme, hut Bismarck is said to he
opposed to the colonial idea. The pres
ident of the London .Statistical Society
delivered an address in London last
week in which he maintained that the
growth in the United States would event
ually give the laboring classes of this
oountry great difficulty to live, and he
thought the stream ol immigration from
Europe and from our Easiern btates
would soon be directed to the northwest
ern part of Canada.

DREAMS.
A dream flew out of the ivory gate
And came to me when night was late.
My love drew near with the proud sad eyes
And the fathomless look of soft surprise.
I slept in peace through the summer night
As I dreamed of her eyes and their depth ol
light.
A dream came out from the gates of horn
And flew to me at early morn.
I ran to the stable and saddled my steed.
We rushed through the dawn at a headlong
Bpeed,
When I reached my love the sun shone

And I found her dead la the morning light.

THE ORIGIN OF COFFEE.
Tho Strife Which Was Occasioned by
Its Introduction as a Beverage.
From the London Times.
It is well known that the coffee plant
i3 not indigenous to Arabia, but was im
ported from Abyssina at a date which
cannot be accurately fixed. The taste
for coffee itself had a hard struggle at
first to find a general welcome among
the more select circles. Apart from the
oldest legend concerning Shadeli's drink,
the Madina Sheikh Abd-el-Kader is the
oldest authority on the use of the "blood
red Kaweh," as the Tunisian Ibn Waki
named the beverage. In the vear 1587,
not three hundred years ago, ne tells us
that in Yemen people made a drink
which so lightened the night watches
that the faithful of the place were able
to sing the praises of God more fervently
and cheerfully than could be done any
where else. According to him, the
Mufti Dbabani was the first to introduce
the insignificant little bean on Arabian
soil,having brought it with him from Afri
ca. Certain it is that the districts of Shoa
Eurara and Kaffa (whence the name), in
the south of the Abyssinian highlands,
from the original home of the coffee
plant. Dhabani was of sickly nature,
and since he belonged to the order of
the Soo (Ultra-Pantheists), who believed
that everything on earth and all being
emanated from the Godhead, he regard
ed a means of excitement of this kind as
a providential gift. The Metlinese and
faithful Meccons laid their turbaned
heads together in the public places,
when first they heard the news; a pious
sheikh in Aden was the first to drink the
"black juice" as a sort of public specta
cle. In Mecca itself, violent strife arose
soon after its introduction as to the pro
priety of using it. There were great
meeting
at last, probably after exireme pressure
3gB of learned and pious men, who
t, probably after extr
from the Mameluke governor, Khair
Beg, declared that coffee "disturbed the
brain, and intoxicated like wine." But
their opponents were ofanother opinion
and adduced the authority of the celebra
ted Bagdad physician Avicenna in their
defense whieh, however, did not prevent
the transgressor ot the edict forbidding
the use of coffee from being publicy
whipped. At the same time the zealots
of the Hedjaz proclaimed that all coffee
drinkers would appear before the All
Merciful on the resurrection-day with
black faces. While the great anathema
was being pronounced at Macca, the
brothers of the order at Cairo, the very
Mamelukes themselves, were already
re»eling in the newly-discovered luxury!
A confirmation of the Mecca decreeVas
therefore, not to be expected from the
Sultan, and he, K&nfu Alguri, quashed
the ordinance of his governor and sent
the latter into exile. Then many holy
Sheikhs, for example, the celebrated
Mohammed Harife, founder of one of
the four orthodox schools of Islam, took
the side of the coffee-drinkers. Thus
was the precious bean fully rehabilitated
in WôJtara r*3i at least.
CARD STORIES.
On one occasion, when Washington
Irving, Bancroft, and Everett were
chatting over diplomatic reminiscences,
the last named told how, after he and
the Neapolitan ambassador had been
presented to her Majesty Queen Victoria,
Lord Melbourne intimated that they
would be expected to join in a game at
whist with the Duchess of Kent. ' ' I play
but a very poor game myself," said Mel
bourne; "in fact' I scarcely understand
it; but the Duchess is very fond of it."
And I," said the Neapolitan to Everett,
am a very bad player, and should I
chance to be your Excellency's partner,
invoke your forbearance in
advance" ; to which the American envoy
replied that he knew very little of the
game himself. As he put it, three dig
nified personages, clad in gorgeous attire,
were solemnly going to play a game they
imperfectly understood, and ior which
none of them cared in the least. Upon
reaching the Duchess's apartments the
ambassadors were formally presented,
and then, at her invitation, sat down to
play. As soon as the cards were dealt,
a lady-in-waiting placed herself at the
back of the DuchesB, and the latter said:
"Your Excellencies will excuse me if I
rely upon the advice of my friend here,
for 1 must confess that I am really a very
poor player." This wasalmoBt too much
for Everett's gravity; a gravity undis
turbed for the rest of the evening, since
he found playing whilst under such con
ditions inexpressibly dull work.
Bold as he could be when the game
was worth the candle, Lord Beaconsfield
would never have been tempted to risk
so much on the cards; for, knowing the
weakness of his play, he carefully es
chewed anything like high Btakes. One
evening, at the time when parliament
was agitating itself about the Empress
ship of India, Lord Beaconsfield sat
down to whist with the prince of Wales,
and asked the latter: "What points,
sir?" "Oh, soverigu, if you please," was
the answer. Seeing the Premier's look
of annoyance, Mr. Bernal Osborne ob
served: "I think, sir, the Premier
would rather have crown points!" The
prince, taking the joke and the hint,
altered the stakes accordingly.
Marlborough was not above playing
for smaller stakes, though perhaps the
-reat captain did not play high out of
.ear of his loving Sarah, who had a
tongue, and knew now to use it; like the
lady wnose leige lord contrived that she
should not more than suspect the secret
of his bad hours, until, coming home at
six in the morning tired out with "at
tending on a sick friend," he dosed at
the breakfast table' and, solemnly pass
ing the bread, said, "Cut!" "That's your
sick friend, is it?" exclaimed the wife;
and what followed may be imagined.
A card-hating wife can upon occasion
set her scruples aside. Soon after the
close of the secession war, General For
rest and his wife stopped at a hotel in
Memphis, and upon examining their
purses, found the sum-total of their
wealth amounted to seven dollars and
thirty cents. The General, being duo
that evening at a house where poker was
sure to be played, proposed that he
should tempt fortune to the full extent
of his means, and asked bis wife to pray
for hie success. She would not promise ;
but he felt she was for him, and knew how
it would be. Let him tell the rest him
self.
"They had three tables—one was a
quarter-dollar table, one a half, and one
a dollar-and-a.half. I wanted to make
my seven dollars last as long as I could
make it, so I sat down to the quarter
table. By dinner-time I had won
enough to do better; and after we had
eaten, sat down to the dollar-and-a-h df
table. Sometimes I won, and then again
I'd lose, until nigh upon midnight, when
I had better luck. I knew Mary was sit
ting up anxious, and it made me cool.
I 6et my hat on the floor, and every
time I'd win I'd drop the money in the
hat. I sat there until day broke, and
then I took my bat up in both hands,
smashed it on my head, and went home.
When I got to m'y room, there sat Mary
in her gown. She seemed tired and
anxious, and though she looked mighty
hard at me. she didn't say a word. I
of
walked right up to her, emptied my hat
right into the lap of her gown, and then
we sat down and counted it. Just fifteen
hundred dollars even, and that gave me
£L stârt*^
The wife of Bishou Beadon loved
whist so well, that when the prelate told
one of his clergy if ho was able to sit up
half the night plaving whist at the Bath
Rooms, he must be well enough to do
duty at home, the invalided one silenced
him with: "My lord, Sirs. Beadon
would tell you that late whist acts as a
tonic or restorative to dyspeptic people
with weak nerveB" The Bishop's better
half would have sympathized with Gold
smith's old lady, who, lying sick unto
death, played cards with the curate to
pass the time awav, and, after winning
all his money, had;just proposed to play
for her funeral charges when she ex
pired.
There have been stranger stakes still.
In 1835, Henry and James Trotter sat
down at the Salmon Inn, Chester-le
Street, to play a game of cards against
Robert Thoms and Thomas Ellison, the
latter pair staking five shillings, and the^
former a child, the son ofaMr.and Mrs*
Leesh, who gave up their boy to the
winners. A traveller in New Zealand,
spending a night in a squatter's hut, was
invited to cut for a rubber of whist- As
he took his seat, he inquired: "What
pointB?" His partner responded in a
tone significant of surprise at such a
question : "Why, the usual game, of
course—Bheep points, and a bullock on
the rubber."
Even the sharpest of sharpers may
meet more than his match. Robert
Houdin happening to saunter into a con
tinental casino where a Greek was reap
ing a rare harvest at ecarte, looked on
quietlv until a seat became vacant, and
then dropped into it. The Greek, deal
ing dexterously turned a king from the
the bottom of the pack. When the deal
came to Houdin, he observed : "When
1 turn kings from the bottom of the pack,
I always ao it with one hand instead of
two ; it is quite as easy, and much more
elegant. See ! here comes his majesty
of diamonds" ; and up came the card.
The cheat stared at the conjurer and then
rushed from the place, without waiting
to possess himself of his hat, coat, or
stakes.
Another of the fraternity, after win
ning ten games at ecarte m succession,
tried his fortune againsta new opponent;
and still his luck held. He had made
four points, and dealing, turned up n
king and won. "My luck is wonderful,"
saia he. "Yes," said his adversary ;
"and all the more wonderful since I have
the four kings of the pack in my pocket!"
and the professor of the legerdemain
laid them on the table.
"1 remember," said agentleman who
had travelled in Russia, "being at a ball
given by the Empress to the late Em
peror, on his birthday. 1 was playing
at ecarte, when the Emperor who was
wandering about, came behind me to
watch the game. My adversary and
were both at four, and it was my deal.
'Now,' said the Emperor, 'let ue see
whether you can turn up the king.'
dealt, and then held up the turn-up card,
observing : 'Your orders, sir, have been
obeyed.' A dozen times afterward, the
Emperor asked me how I managed it ;
and he never would believe that it was
a mere hazard, and that I had taken the
chance of the card being a king."
The czar was as much astonished at
the result of his remark a3 the young
gentlemen, who, looking over a pretty
girl's shoulder, while she was playing
cards, observed : "What a lovely hand!"
"You may have it if you want it," mur
mured she ; and all the rest of the ev
ening he was wondering what her inten
tions were.—Chamber's Journal

THE TARIFF COMMISSION.
The Country Agreeably Surprises
by Proposed Reductions of Taxa
tion. t ,
The report of the tariff commission says
that their theory had been to make a sym
metrical revision and redaction of the tar
iff, keeping in view the relation which each
article on the list bore to every other.
They had then made the rate as low as it
possibly could be with a view to the suo
ceesiul protection of American industries.
It would be found upon a study of their
recommendations that nothing in them
could be touched without injury to business
interests as a whole, while at the same time
they had left a sufficient margin for the
protection of the various manufacturing en
terprises which had been developed in this
country and were at work in competition
with the skilled labor of the world.
There are some general features of the re
port which are prominent, such as the abo
lition almost entirely of compound duties
and the adoption of specific rates in place of
a combination of both specific and aa valor
em. There has also been a sweeping
chantre made by the abolition of all fees,
charges and commissions, which upon
some classes of goods will be equivalent to
a reduction of the tariff" rate. Tins is espec
ially true of pottery and other bulky arti
cles.
The tariff on Bessemer steel rails has been
reduced from $28 to $18 a ton, and on
blooms it is put down to { of cent a pound.
The duty ou raw wool has been made speci
fic instead of compound as before, and lias
been slightly reduced. The commission
recouimekds that or first-class clothing
wools, such as are commonly sheared in
the west the duty be 10 cents a pound on
those valued at less than 30 cents and 12
cents a pound on those valued at oyer 30
cents. It is the same on wools of the sec
ond class known as combings. The exist
ing tariff, which is compound, is equiva
lent to about 12J cents a pound on an aver
age for such wools as are produced by the
western growers. The recommended tariff
will only be about 2J cents less. This is
on unwashed wool. On washed it is about
twice as much. On some woolen goods the
compound duties are retained, but upon
lower grades there is recommended a very
large reduction of the tariff. The tariff on
the lower grades of wooleu blankets is re
duced about 50 per cent.
There is a reduction of about 10 per cent,
on carpets. The tariff on ready-made
clothing is cut down about one-fourth.
Tne free list is giveu a fur wider scope
than ever before and is headed by wood
pul •. Spices and all green fruit3 except
oranges, lemons and grapes are alto on the
free list. The dye extracts and crude chem
icals used in tne manufacture of medicines
are on the free list, as is quinine. A sin
gle copy of any ffireign publication, book,
pampnlet or newspaper is recommended to
come in free of duty in order that articles
of this kind may be sent from abroad
through the mails, Thera is a reduction oi
25 per cent, on printing paper. The cotton
schedule has beeu changed from A to I,
and Las been very much condensed.
There is a reduction of about 30 per cent,
on cottons with all compound tariffs abol
ished.
There is a new schedule on sugars and a
revolution in the method of levying
the tariff is recommended. The commis
sion recommends that all sugars which
are known as below t rado thirteen be
cut able according to the polar)scope test,
abolishing the Dutch standard. Above
this grade the commission recommend«
the retention of the Dutch Standard -j -m.
The effect of the recommendation would
be a considerable re motion of the duty.
On oranges, lemons and grapes, the only
dutiable fruits under the proposed revision,
there is simply a specific duty of so much
pet box. The duty on all medical prepa
rations is reduoed from 40 to 25 per cent,
ad valorem. The ed valorem duty on
iron ore is abolished, owiug to the varia
tion of values, and a specific duty of 00
per cent a ton, which auiounta to about 5
per cent, reduction, is recommended.
Analene dyes are now payiDg over 100 per
cent, and the commission recommends
that they shall pay 40 per cent. duty. On
salt there is a reduction recommended on
the article which comeo In sacks and bar
rels of from 12 cents per 100, thepreeen
duty, to 10 cents per 100, and upon salt in«
bulk from 8 cents j^er 100 to 6 cents per 100.
Duties on tobacco are removed, and the
dntv on cigars, cigarettes, etc., are made $3
a pound. There is no change recommended
in the dntv on lumber and none on grain
The duty cm fire crackers and playing cards
is raised from 50 j>er cent, ad valorem to 100
per cent, ad valorem. The tariff on all silk
goods has been very heavily reduced. Tak
ing the recommendation as a whole, the
revision will involve a reduction on the

Schodule D—Woods: There have been

Schedule F —Tobacco: There have been
no changes in this schedule, except the
abolition of compound duties and the sub
stitution of specific duties.
Schedule G — Provisions: As the duties
on this schedule are very low few recom

A slight decrease has been made in the duty
on rice, and the rates of the other items
enumerated in this schedule have been
made more harmonious. The duties on
dried frivts, mustard, and several other
minor articles have been reduced._

changes have beeu made in this schedule,
excepting that the rebate of 6 per cent, al
lowed for breakages has been abolished and
the schedules rearrang d. .

Interior Department—Secretary Tell
er's Report.
Secretary Teller in his report recommends
the diearming of the Indians and the pur
chase- >of their arms by the government. He
thinks this would remove the temptation to
go upon the war-path. They have no other
us 2 for gttns, because they have their lands
secured to them and reasonable provision
made fortbem, so that they need net fear. He
is opposed to the policy of giving the In
dians lands in severally, and recommends
the passage of a law to give each tribe a
patent, for the land the government has
guaranteed to it, leaving the Indians to
determine the question of allottment for
themselves. Very many of these reserva
tions contain large areas of valuable land
that cannot bo cultivated by the Indians,
even though they were as energetic and
laborious as the b*t class of white agricul
turists. AU such reservations should be
reduced in size, aiul the surplus not needed
ought to be bought by the government and
opened to the operation of the homestead
law, and it would thenaoon be settled by in
dustrious whites, who, as neighbors, would
become valuable auxiliaries in the worjc ol
civilizing the Indians residing on the re
mainder of the reservation. When thus re
duced the government should issue to the
tribe its patent, resting in the tribe the title
in fee simple as fully as It does to the 160
acres given to the Bettler. The secretary re
views the report of the commissioners ol
public lands, patente, and railroads. In
indorsing his recommendation for the repeal
ofthe pre-emption law and modification of
the homestead, he remarks that the pre
emption law, intended as a means of ena
bling the citizen wishing to make a home to
do so cheaply and speedily, has been used
largely to agsyegate large quantities of lands
for the benefit ofthe speculator, and not for
those for whose benefit it was intended. It
will be useless to repeal the pre-emption laws
if the opportunity shall exist to oommit
the same frauds under the cover of the
homestead law. If it is thought best to re
tain the pre-empti in laws, they should be
so amended that the filing for pre-emption
should preoede the entry at least one year.

The reptiles crowded upon one anotho',

Wheat—T here was nearly no trading in sampla
grain The bn Ik of this property is bought fot
shipment. Now, with the peculiar prevalent poli
cy of the railroads in force, there is a practical
blockade in the movement of wheat. It la charged
that there is wheat held on board cars sidetracked a
few miles outside of the city billed through on tran
sit rates to Chicago. And the stnfi is kept out there
to save the cars from being unloaded
aud reloaded with low rate flour from here. None
will buy anything and ran the risk of moving It
Prices are therefore on the down grade, with little
hope of anything better with the existing blockade.
Of course the result is foreseen, and freight will
be held back for a settlement and restoration of
full rates. Ten thousand bushels of No. 1 bard
sold in A at $1. A few care of same grade sold in
B at $1.01, but more offered at the same failed to
