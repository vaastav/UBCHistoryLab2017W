fortune all these were needed on thi
line of the main divide between the
Salmon river and Big Creek water
t-heris, from a point seven miles south
west of Salmon City toward the
southwest Bj reason of combining
all into one Job it was possible to
complete these for eighteen miles with

with the exception that because ol
t inttrruption by snow the stringing 01
the last six mi'es oi telephone wire
will be delayed until spring.
' There are large areas o( Pouglus

of this divide, and a fire break here
I can be used most effectively in pre
venting the cros-inp of any ordinaiy

I trail of the Salmon forest Is one
j which starts with three miles on the
I main continental divide and then
practically follows the crest of the
Bitter Root mountains for 04 miles
on the northern boundary of the for
est. This trail follows the Carpen
ter survey of the state line between
Idaho and Montana, vhi h is the
southern boundary of the Bitter Root
National forest of Montana.
' The trail starts at Bighole Pass,
through which a wagon road con
r.eetB Bighole Basin of Montana with
the Salmon River valley, of Idaho
and from this point a view is had ol
the Bighole Basin on the northeast
and of the valley of the North Fork
of the Salmon river on the southwest
Farther to the west the Bitter Root
valley is spread oul on the north Reg
ular patrol Is maintained on this trail
during the fire season, the eastern
halt by a Salmon forest ranger and
the western by one from the Bitter
Root forest. At two points commu
nication is had by telephone with the
supervisor's office at Salmon City.
Efficiency of Lookout Stations.
"Another lookout l maintained on
the Salmon forest at Baldy mountain
or Salmon City peak, which Is nine
miles by telephone line southwest of
Salmon At this point and also at
Rnrkv Point which is flue north on
the Divide trail are maintained in
strunients to Indicate the exact loca
tion of a distant fire. Bach of these
is like the face of a clock, a foot and
a hair in diameter placed horizont
ally exactly level, a loot and hall
high The margin of the dial is mark
ed with ICO degrees instead of hours,
and there is but one hand Bach
dial Is placed with "o ' degrv oxacl
ly north and by pointing the hand
toward B fire, its exact direction from
the lookout is known and the point oi
intersection of the directions from the
two stations known to the supervi
sor, enables him to locate the fire
very closely
A practical test of the Instruments!
In locating a fire between Garden
Creek on the south bank of the Sa I-1
mon river last summer. evidenced
their accuracy This fire was thirty
miles distant from either lookout, and
numerous valleys and ridges inter
vened.
"When not used each instrument isj
protected by a water proof oilcloth'
hood."

DIRECT PRIMARY
A SOUND ISSUE
Washington. D. C. Uec 5. The if,
sue of direct presidential primaries
brought Into public discussion 1,
President Wilson's message, promises
to be an important factor In the df
liberations of the Republican nutional
committee here December 16. Many
believe congress may provide prima
ilea that will do away with the need
of any nominating conentlons before
the next presidential election
It was pointed out today that if a
direct primary law was passed before
the 1110 election, the need for a
change of Republican representation
would disappear
Senator Jones, a member of the
law committee, returned to Washing
ton today and said plans were goinj J
forward for a national convention i
"I am In favor of some form of a -dlredl
primary," h said. "One plan j
that appears to be sound would pro
vide for direct primaries In the States
with national conventions m whlciii
delegates would sit In proportion tfl I
the vote in the states.
"Earn state would apportion Us del I
egates according to the strength ol I
the respective party candidates and
the national convention would make
the final choice "
