Picking a
Present
k& Platt
In-DOUGLASMAUOCH
HEN Harry Platt and
tbat girl friend of tbo
Greens (I forget her
name) were married.
It was one of those
my-gcodness gracious
just-thlnk-of-that nf-
fain, with no one in
on the secret except tho suburban
minister who tied the knot, the cab
man who drive thorn out thero and the
Ctrl from the minister's kitchen who
was a witness, and left a thumb-print
of grease on the certificate (she was
frying doughnuts at the time) and the
minister's wife (at least the name was
the same). Let's see, wbero was IT
.Oh. yes, when the Piatts were mar
ried, It being that kind of a wedding,
there was no chance to send them a
wedding gift as I would hare liked to
do, or to hare done, (whichever is
proper, or grammatical, though I'm
aura I can never tell which)
.But Mr. Platt la ono of the nicest men
In the offloe, that Is, he was before
this happened. So I felt we ought to
do something for him, Just to show
our good will and, anyhow, we're
dug down for others we thought much
less of. so why shouldn't we for him? ,
But the wedding was over, without In-,
YlUtloM, or even a reception, and'
they were housekeeping before we
knew it So what could we do?
Well, Just then
Christmas came
long not Just then
that two months
iter the wedding.
iThey were mar
ked October 29,
wo It waant Quite
(two months, but
that's close
enough. When
Christmas came
.long, that Is.
just before It
came along, I sug
gested that we
make up a purse
and giro them a
sort of delayed
wedding present.
Just to show our
good will. Every
body thought It
waa a splendid
Mea, that is, of course, except Mr.
Platt, whom, of course, I didn't con
cult. So I got up a subscription paper
went to everybody In the office
i(cept Mr. Platt, of course). I got'
MH.tO, Including ten cents from the
jjaaltor, who wasn't expected to give
anything but wanted to give some
thing, which shows Just bow popular
Mr. Platt was with everyone In the
Gliding, when a Janitor even would
kip la.
Christmas shopping Is hard enough,
joodness knows, when you do It for
ymraelf; but when you do It for a
lock company capitalized at $26.60,
wna x stockholders, with 28 different
kinds of Ideas and tastes, then Christ
hopping rises above a mero an
oyance to the dignity of a real trou
le. And that's what I was ud against
I thought It would be nice to get an
expression of opinion. So I went
around one morning and asked for
Mean. But I couldn't get a word. No-
Body could think of anything.
I
couant myself. At noon I went
teat and looked. I walked miles.
I priced, then I went back to
the office. Tou should have seen
ay desk. Honest, you would have
thought some one had turned In a gon
ral alarm. They couldn't wait for me
to get back. There they were 28 of
them, (that la, 27, or 28 with me).
They all had suggestions, and they
i all different.
The head book
keeper thought
an arm chair
would bo nice.
(He stands up all
day). The collec
tor thought a rain
coat would be
best, while Miss
J.ones suggested a
dress pattern.
They all said, of
courso, that they
left it entirely to
me; and then each
went away sadly,
aa much as to Bay
that he hoped I
wouldn't be so
foolish aa to bay
any of thoso other
things that the
others had proposed.
