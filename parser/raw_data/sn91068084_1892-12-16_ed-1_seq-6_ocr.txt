Scenes Attending the Opening of
the Short Session
The final session of the Fifty-second Con
gress was opened at noon on tha appointed
day for assemblage, and with probably a
brief intermission during the holidays will
continue until March 4, when a new f Vn
gress and a new Administration will come
into existence. The President's message
was not ready for transmission, so there
was nothing to do but to adjourn over until
next day. An unquestioned quo
rum was present in eic'a branch, so
that the routine work of the sa-jskm will no
doubt be promptly resumed after the Presi
dent's recom men Nations have been received
and read. A beautiful crisp winter day
ushered in the sessioa, and lonz before the
hour of noon spectators began to arrive at
the House wing of the Capitol in order to
secure advantage of seats in the gal
leries. Members als began to arrive
early and the scene presented on the
floor was a lively and bustling one.
In both Senate and House there was a rare
display of beauty in the galleries ani flow
ers on the floor, for although it was gener
ally understood that no business could be
transacted to-day, and that no communica
tion would be received from the President,
it is the habit of the Washington women to
be in attendance on the opening ceremonies
of Congres?, and to see that the desk of her
favorite statesman is suitably decorated.
Sharp upon the stroke of 12 Vice-President
Morton brought the gavel down, barely
missing a circular-shaped basket of roses
that rested on his desk, and the Sen
ate came to order. Chaplain Butler,
in his prayer, referred feelingly to
the President's recent afflictions. There
was a surprisingly large number of Sena
tors present, seventy-one of the eighty
eight being ready for business. Among the
absentees were the two New York Senators.
After the oDening prayer by the Chaplain,
Senator Morrill presented the certificate of
election of his colleague, Senator Red
field Proctor, of Vermont, for the unex
pired terra of George F. Edmunds, termina
ting March 3, 1S93, and for the ensuing term
of six years. Upon the arm of his ven
erable colleague, Mr. Proctor, advanced to
the dais of the Vice-President's desk, and
Mr. Morton administered the statutory
oath. Senator Sherman presented the cus
tomary resolution instructing the Secretary
to inform tho House that the Senate was
ready to proceed to business. Senator
Hale offered a resolution authorizing
the President to appoint a committee of
two to join a similar committee on the
part of the House to inform the President
that a quorum of each House was present,
and that Congress was ready to receive any
communication he might have to make. The
resolution was adopted and Messrs. Hale
and Gorman were named as the committee.
Mr. Sherman suggested that the Sen
ate should take a recess until 1 o'clock,
which was agreed to. On reassem
bling the Senate received a message
from the House of Representatives by
Mr. Kerr, its Clerk, announcing that a
quorum had appeared, and that it was
ready to proceed to business. At 1:33
Senators Hale and Gorman appeared, and
Mr. Hale reported that they hd performed
the duty assigned them. The Presid snt had
responded that he would send a me. 3age in
writing to Congress at the beginning of to
morrow's session. Thereupon the Senate,
on motion of Mr. Sherman, adjourned.
In the House, as the hand? of the clotfc
pointed to twelve, Speaker Crisp ascended
to the Speaker's chair, and as his gavel
dropped a solemn hush followed the noise
and confusion. The blind chaplain,
the Rev. Dr. Milburn, delivered a brief
and impressive prayer. Two hundred
and twenty-four members having responded
to the roll call, the Clerk was ordered to
inform the Senate that the House was ready
to proceed to business. A committee, com
posed of Messrs. Springer, Forney and
O'Neill (Pennsylvania), was appointed to
join a committee of tne Senate
to announce to the President that both
Honses were in session and ready to
receive any communication he saw fit to
make. Mr. Payne, of New York, presented
the petition of John I. Davenport, Chief
Supervisor of Elections for the Southern
District of New York, for a hearing before
the bar of the House of Representatives,
'he having been denied a hearing
by a committee of the House." It was re
ferred to the Select Committee appointed
to investigate the administration of United
States election laws in the city of New York.

the Sixth District of South Carolina; S. G.

elect came forward and were sworn in. The

of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti
tution and the report submitted by the

At 12:40, upon motion of Mr. McMillfn,
the House took a recess for thirty
minutes in order to give the committee ap
pointed to wait upon the President oppor
tunity to report. At 1:35 the committee
returned, and Mr. Springer announced
that the commission with which they were
charzed had been executed and that the
President would send a communication
to the House next day. Mr. English,
of New Jersey, announced the cieatb
of his colleague, the late Representa
tive Edward F. McDonald, and stated that
at a future time he hoped to submit some
appropriate remarks. He offere I the usual

HIS F0UETH TERM.
General Diaz Again Takes the Oath
of Office as President ot Mexico.
The fourth inauguration of General Por
firio Diaz, as President of Mexico, took place
with great pomp in the Chamber of Depu
ties, City of Mexico. The houses were
decorated and the streets were crowded.
The route from the President's house to the
Chamber was guarded by a double line of
soldiers. In the Chamber were gathered
the deputies, the diplomatic corps, members
of the Public Health Association, now visit
ing this city, and many other conspicuous
citizens and foreigners.
The constitutional oath was administered
by the President of the Chamber, M. Chav
ero. After the ceremony President Diaz
went to the palace, where he received con
gratulations for two hours. The highest
army officers presented him with an album
containing their autographs. During the
ceremony of inauguration cannon were fired
and bands played in the streets. All the
Ministers resigned, but were immediately
reinstad.
At S o'clock in the evening an inaugura
tion banquet, with 400 covers, was given in
the palace to the President by Senators and
Deputies. The palace was magnificently
decorated and illuminated. Fireworks were
set off, and almost every building in the
city was a blazj of light. The re-election of
the President is received with demonstra
tions of unqualified satisfaction everywhere
in the country.

building
Then a vote was taken, which resulted as
follows: Annexation, 418: Independence,
ninety-two; Remain as we are, twenty -one.
At the close of the meeting some one

141,518. There were 6417 railway postoffiae clerks,
7122 mail messenger routes and 2543 special
office routes.
Tae amount estimated as necessary for
the mil messenger service during the yeir
beginning July 1, 1893, is 91,275,000, which
is 6.25 per cent, more tnn the present ap
propriation for that service. The rate of
cost per mile traveled in the railroad service

DEPARTMENTAL ANNUALS.
Tho Reports of Secretaries
Roble and Elkins.
The Tear's Work in the Depart
ment of the Interior.
The annual report of Secretary Noble, of
the Interior Department, is an interesting
document and covers fully and in detail the
operations of the department. The volume
of work accomplished during the present
Administration is shown to greatly exceed
that of any preceding period. This view is
supported by a condensed summary prelim
inary to a description of the work of the
several bureaus under the direction of the
Secretary for the last fiscal year.
The General Land Office has worked oft
the vast accumulation of former years and
is now on current business, greatly to the
advantage of Western settlerr.; the Indian
Bureau has made great progqs in elevat
ing the various Indian tribes, in the work
of allotment? of land in severalty to indi
vidual Indians, the consequent disintegra
tion of their tribal relation, and tha de
velopment of schools. Great reform has
been accomplished in the purchase of In
dian supplies. The Pen-don Office has dis-
Eosed of an immense volume of work and
as exceeded all former records in the num
ber of final adjudications, both original and
upon appeals, executing the baneScent laws
for the soldiers of the Union. The Census
Office has finished nearly all of its immense
and highly scientific work, and what re
mains is rapidly nearing completion.
The Geological Survey has progressed
greatly in its topographical survey of the
States and Territories; in locating reser
voirs for the irrigation of the arid land, and
in its other useful divisions. The Railroad
Bureau has kept constant supervision of the
condition of the road beds and appur
tenances and given careful consideration
to the question of the maturing debts
of the subsidized railroads and the
future conditions which should govern
them. The Patent Office has kept up with
current work, and has introduced several
important reforms. The Bureau of Educa
tion has greatly extended its operations in
Europe and our own country, and the dis
tribution of the funds for agricultural
colleges, a difficult problem, Las been satis
factorily and efficiently handled.
Educational work among the Indians has
been greatly increased and improved in
efficiency. There has been an increase of
over thirteen per cent, in attendance of
children in the schools, the total for 1802 be
ing 19,793 scholars.
The reservation system is being rapidly
broken up, aDd the allotments of land in
sufficient quantity to enable each Indian to
have a farm, has developed a sense of indi
vidual importance and appreciation of per
sonal power that is rapidly disintegrating
the tribal relations.
Wherever it is possible the employment of
Indians in preference to whites, at the agen
cies and in schools is being practiced, and
many important positions are now filled ac
ceptably by educated Indians.
The Patent Office in preparing an exhibit
for the World's Fair which it is represented
will be a very satisfactory one to the Gov
ernment. The total number of applications
ior patents during the year was 45,945.
Tne volume of business handled and dis
posed of by the Pension Office during the
past year was enormous. There were on
June 30, 1892, S76,0()S pensioners borne apon
the roll?, being 19t',9JS more than were on
the rolls at the close of the last fiscal
year. The total amount expended for pen
sions during tho year was $139,035,6 12.CS,
and it is estimated that the appropriation
for 1893 of 9144,955,030 will leave a defici
ency. Some idea of the magnitude of tho
work can be formed from the fact that dur
ing tne year 5,375.120 pieces of mail were re
ceive J, and 4,316,616 pieces sent out.
The Secretary presents a bill framed to
give Alaska a better government, and is
very earnest in his recommendation that;
the condition of the Territory receiva the
attention of Congress.
The report also contains an account of tho
work up to date on the Nicaraugua Canal.
The Secretary expresses the opinion that
this enterprise is ot the utmost importance
to the welfare of the country in either peace
or war, and should have the favorable rec
ognition of Congress.
Secretary fcJlkins's Report.
The annual report of the Secretary of
War has been made public. Secretary
Elkins expresses gratification in being
able to tay that the Army has main
tained throughout the year its high
standard of discipline and efficiency. Since
the present organization of our infantry was
adopted many caauges have taken place in
the art of war, resulting, among other
things, in a material modification ot the
form of infantry regiments. Our stationary
condition in this respect has left us with an
obsolete organization, the defects of which
render immediate accion in organizing the
three-battalion formations for infantry
regiments. The Secretary recommends the
revival of the rank of Lieutenant-General
as a permanent grade.
Enlistments during the year have been of
an improved class ot men, the standard of
qualification having been raised. The
Secretary thinks the Army, under favor
able conditions, should be one of
the most desirable trades of youth.
It if. recommended that the pay o all non
tommissioned grades be increased, making
promotion thereto the object of legitimate
ambition, thereby inducing the enlistment
of the very best material to compete for pro
motion to those grades.
The announcement is made that our In
dian wars are nearly ended, and the neces
sity for massing troop3 no longer exists.
Seventy pjr cent, is now located west
of the Mississippi River. New military
posts are recommended in Montana, Arkan
sas and New Mexico. Tne presence of regu
lar troops in these States would familiarize
tae people with the Army, lead them to
b tter understand its operations and, it is
elieved. foster a kindlier interest in it.
The West Point Academy shows marked
advancement. Its cipicity is not overtaxed.
Vacancies in the list of cadets constantly
xist, which it is important should b3 kept
full. It is recommended that the President
be given authority to appoint ten cadets-at-large
each year.
The artillery, infantry, engineer and
cavalry schools have proved successful ex
periments. Toe only serious obstacle to the
rapid development of tha schools to their
full limit of usefulness arises from a want
of funds to conduct the exclusively scholastic
wort.
The importance of maintaining and im
proving the militia of the several States
is generally admitted. The National
Guard is the reserve force of the Army.
Attention is invited Co th-j necessary
appropriations for arming and equipping
this reserve force. In 18'J3 the
appropriations for the militia of the
States was $20Q0h The highly improved
arms aud equipments of the present day
cost more than treble what they did eighty
four years. An appropriatioa of least on
million dollars for this purpois is recom
mended. The Indian soldiers are doing excalleut
service, showing remarkable aptitude for
military duty.
He estimates that the total expenditures
of bis department for the fical year ending
June 39. 14, will be H $, 354, t: 79. 72, against
5l,2ia.U70.59 in 1S92 and e,532,ie.24 for
the present year.
the reclpte of the Tale-Princeton root
ball game at Manhattan Field, New York
City, were about 53, 000, and the expenses

ance of $29,000 to be divided between tha
