SYNOPSIS OP THE MESSAGE.
The president's message opens with n re
minder trat this session of congress wid
mark the close of a century of constitution
al existence. Ho reminds congress that
the constitution was the chart of guidance
laid down by the fathers of the country, and
that departure from It means failure of our
institutions. Ho draws a bright picture of
the country's growth, but says that "upon
more carelul inseetiou wo tind the wealth
and luxury of our cities mingled with
poverty and wretchedness and unrerauner
atlve labor. A crowed and constantly In
creasing urban popui tiou suggest the im
jHwerishment of the rural sections and dis
content with agricultural pursuits. The
farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's
simple and laborious Hie, joins the eatror
chase for easily ho juired wealth, and so
economic conditions have becorno difticult
of solution. We discover that the fortunes
realized by our manufacturers are no long
er solely a reward of sturdy industry and
enlightened foresight, but that they result
from tho discriminating favor or tho govern
meut und are largely built upon undue ex
action from the masses of our people. Tho
gulf between employers and the employed
is constantly widening and classes are rat
idly form mr, one-. comprising the very rich
und H)werful, while iu another are found
the toiling poor.
"As we v.ew tho rchlevement of aggre
gated capital, we discover t lie existence of
trusts, (v.mbina ions and nnwoHe, while
the eiti'en is struggling far in the rearer is
trampled to death beneath an iron heeL
Corporations, wi ich should 1? the carefully
restrained creatures of the law and the ser
vants of the people, are fast becoming the
people's masters. Still, conpratulatingour
aelves ujoti the wealth and prosperity of
our country, and complacently contemplat
ing every incident of ch miro inseparable
from these conditions, it is our duty as
patriotic citizens to inquire, at tho present
stage of our progress, how the bond the
government made with the people has been
kept and ierforiiied.
lustcad of It it. i ing the tribute drawn
from r.ur citizens to tho necessities of its
1 economical administration, the government
persists in exacting from tho substance of
the jKOple midions which, unapplied and
useless, lie dormant in its treasury. This
flagrant injustice and this breach of faith
and obligation a Id to the extortion atd tho
danger attending the diversion of the cur
rency of thocoun'ry from the legitimate
channels of business. Un ier the same laws
by which these results are produced, tle
government jtermits many millions more to
be added to the est of tho living of our
peop e and to be taken from our consumers,
which unreasonably swell the profl s of a
small but p iwerfui m'nority. The people
must still be t:ied for the supiort of the
government under the operation of tariff
laws; but to the extent that the mass of
our citizens are inordinately burdened be
yond any useful public purposes and for the
benefit of a favored few, the government,
under pretext of an overcise of its tax ng
power, enters gratuitously into partnership
with thc favorites, to their advantage
and to the in'urv of a vast major! v of our
people. This is not equality before the
law."
After the prelude the president argues
that such conditions are injurious to the
nation, making the government an instru
ment for private gain; and he says that the
farmers and laborers will see only too soon
that they are being tixed under un unjust
theory of taxation, without compensatory
favor. When this discontent and the self
ishness of the beneficiaries of protectee
tariffs are rralbed. we will realize that the
beneficent purposes of our government are
endangered. "Communism Is a hateful
thing, and a menace to pe:ico and organized
government. Hut the communism of com
bined wealth an I capital, tre outgrowth of
overweening cu i id ty and selfishness, whic h
inaiduously uudermines the Justice and in
tegrity of free institutions. Is not less dan
gerous than the communism of oppressed
poverty, which, exasperated by Injustice
and discontent, attacks w.th wild disorder
the citadel of rule.
"There are oopla who propose that the
government shall protect the rich and that
they in turn will care for tho laboring poor.
Any intermediary t.etwoen the people and
their government, or the least delo ration of
the care and protection tho government
owes to tho humblest citizen In the land,
makes the boast of free institutions a glit
tering d dusion, and the pretended boon of
American citizenship a shameless imposi
tion. "A Just and sensible revision of our tariff
lnws should be made for tho relief of those
of our countrymen who suffer under pres.
ent conditions. Such a revision should re
ceive the support of all who love that Jus
tice and equality duo to American citizen
ship; of all who realize that in this
Justice and equality our government finds
its strength and it power to protect tho cit
renand his projierty; of all who believe
that the contented competence and comfort
of the m ny accord better with the spirit of
our instttntions than colossal fortunes, un
fairly gathered, in the hands of the few; of
all who appreciate that the forbearance,
and fraternity among our people, which
recompense the value of every American
interest, are the surest guarantee of our
national pro-jre-s, and of all who desire to
;e the products of American skill and in
genuity in every market of the world, with
a result ng restoration of American com
merce" i Paternalism of government Is strongly d
YKunced, and the pietext of the wealth of
the government being sufficient excuse for
extravagant expenditure combated. In
thui class of false theory comes pensions
granted on no other ground than the appli
cant's need, pr vate relief bills, etc, wbieh
have oon-jc-ted congressional work and
prevented con (deration of really import
ant pubi c at airs. Among tho business so
avoided wer measures for the relief of tho
supreme court; for United States prisons;
for an equitable land law; and for revision
of the pension laws. Furthermore, under
plea of servinir the public good, there has
been great laxity in observing the parti
tions that divide proper fields of federal
and stato legislation; and closing this por
tion of his message, he quotes Andrew
Jackson's peroration on the constitution.
The president argue then on the neces
sity of tariff reform boing patent to all and
says it should be honestly met and effective
ly remedied. A plan should be effected,
fair and conservative toward existing in
dustries, but which will reduce the oost to
consumers of the necessaries of life, while
It provides for our manufacturers the ud
vautiige of freer raw m.iterbds and permits
no injury to tho interests of Amorican la
bor.' Dealing with tho stato of the union, the
president says foreign relations havo been
strengthened. Tho international questions
which still await settlement aro all reason
ably within the domain of a capable nego
tiation, and there is no existing subject of
dispute between tho United States and any
foreign power that is not suKcentiblo of
satisfactory adjustment by frauk diplo
matic troatmt-nt.
"The questions between Great Britain
and the United States relating to tho rights
of American fishermen under treaty and
International comity in tho territorial
waters of Cauada and Newfoundland, I
regret to say, aro not satisfactorily ad
justed." He recites tho diplomatic history of those
disputes. Ho then goes on and says:
"Having essayed in tho discharge of my
duty to procure by negotiation the settle
ment of a long standing cause of dispute
and to remove a constant menace to tho
good relations of the two countries, and
continuing to be of tho opinion that tho
treaty of February last, which failed to
receive the approval of tho senate, did sup
ply u satisfactory, practical and final ad
justment upon a basis honorable and Just
to both parties of tho difticult and vexed
questiou to which it related,' aud having
subsequently and unavalliugly recommend
ed other legislation to congress, which
I hoiHMl would sofllco to moot the
exigency created by tho rejection
of tho treaty, I now again iuvoko tho earn
est and Immediate attention of tho congress
to the condition of this Important question
as It now stands before them and the coun
try, and for tho settlement of which I am
deeply solieitlous. Near tho close of the
month of October last, occurrences of a
deeply regretable nature were brought to
my kcowled.'o which made it my painful
but imperative duty to obtain with as little
delay as possible, a new personal channel
of diplomatic intercourse in this country
with the government of Great Britain.
"Tho correspondence in relation to this
lncideut will, in due course, be laid before
you, and will disclose tho unpardonable
conduct of tho official referred to, in his in
terference by advice and counsel with
the suffrages of American citizens in tho
very crisis of tho presidential election near
at hand, and also in his subsequent public
declarations to Justify his action, suieradd
ing impugnment of tho executive and sen
ate of the United States, in connection with
important questions now pending in contro
versy between the two governments.
"The offense thus committed was most
grave, luvolvlng disastrous possibilities to
tho good relation of the United States and
(irout Britain, constituting u gross breach
of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of
the purely domestic affairs and essential
aoverignity of the government to which tho
envoy was accredited. Having first fulfill
ed the just demand of international comity.
by affording full opportunity for herma;es
ty's government to act in relief of tho situa
tion, I considered prolongation of the dis
cussion to be unwarranted, and thereupon
declined to further recognle the diplomatic
character of the jterson wboo continuanco
in such function would destroy the mutual
confidence which is essential to tho good
understanding of tle two governments, and
was inconsistent with the welfare and self
respect of the government of the United
States."
A survey of the Alaskan boundary is
recommended.
An arraugement with (ireat Hritain
looking to the removal of obstacles to tho
humane relief of shipwrecked bailors on
tho great lakes is suggested.
Tho relations with France on the im
press'ngof American ritiens into its mili
tary serviie, and the relations with Samoa
and China on the restriction act. are retold.
Tho convention with Japan is still in prog
ress. A consular coui t in Con a is recom
mended. Our r. preventative in Haytl has
been instructed to abstain from interfer
ence in the revolution now en there, while
due precautions for the observance of
neutrality laws have been taken. Sub
marine telegraph connection with Honolu
lu is recommended. A precise location of
the Mexican boundary lino is urged tr
avoid future complications. Claims of
American citizens against the foreign gov
ernments have been amicably settled.
Tlie president theu takes up the question
of naturalization, deal ng with It thus:
"With the rapid in reuse of immigration to
our shores and tho facilities of modern
travel, abuses of the generous privileges
afforded by our naturalization laws call lor
their careful revision. Tho easy and un-gu-irjed
manner in which certificates of
American citizenship can be obtained has
induced a cla-s, unfortunately large, to
avad themselves of the opportunity to be
come absolved from allegiance to their
native land, and yet by a foreign residence
escape any Just duty and contribution of
service to the country of their proposed
adoption. Thus, while evading the duties
of citizenship to to United States, they
may make prompt claim for its national
protection, and demand its Intervention in
their behalf. International complications
of a serious tiatuie arise and tho corres
pondence of the state department discloses
tho great number and complexity of tho
questions which have been ra.sed. Our
laws regulating tho issue of passports
should be care tully revised, and tho insti
tut on of a central bureau cf registration
at the capital is again strongly recommend
ed. Hy this meaus full particulars of
each case of naturalization in the United
States would be secured and prcrly re
corded, und thus many cases of spurious
citizenship would te detected and unjust
responsibilities would be avoided.
"The reorganization of the consular ser
vice is a matter of serious iniortanoe to
our national interests. The number of ex
isting princ pal consular officers is believed
to be greater than is at all necessary for
the louduct of the public business. It need
not be our policy to maintain more than a
moderate number of principal officers, each
supported by a salary sufficient to enable
the incumbent to live in comfort and so
distributed as to secure convenient sujer
visiou over a considerable district, I re-
1eatthe recommendations heretofore mado
y mo, that the appropriations for the
maintenance of our diplomatic and consular
service should bo recast; that tho so oalled
notarial or unofficial duties which our ro
resentatives abroad are now permitted to
treat as personal erquis tes, should be tor
bidden; that a system of consular inspec
tion should be instituted ; and that a limited
number ol secretaries of legation at large
should be authorizd."
The preparat ions for a centennial of the
inaugura ion of Washington, to be held at
New York, aro adverted to.
The message then goes on to deal wHh
the rejKrts of the various departments,
heretofore sent out by the press. The sur
plus in the treasury is put at f I04,(MM),IKK).
The money saved bv purchase of Imnds not
yet due is put at I J7,lti.,0i0. At first sight
this would scorn to be a profitable and sen
sible transact. on on tho part of the govern
ment, but as suggested by tho secretary of
the treasury, thesurplus thus oxpenddfor
tho purchase of bouds was money drawn
from the people in excess of any actual
need of the government, ami was so ex
pended rather than allowed to remain In
tho treasury. "If this surplus under tho
oieration of Just and equitable laws had
been left In tho hands of tho people. It
wou'.d havo teen worth in their bus noss at
least six per cent ier annum. Deducting
from the amount of interest upon the prin
cipal pnd p-emium of these bonds for the
time they had to run, at the rato of six per
cout, the saving of two er cent mado for
tho people by tho purchase of such bonds,
the loss will appcarto I e V,7M,u0.
"With regard to silver coinage, tho see
retary of the treasury recom mentis the sus
pension of the further coinage of silver,
and in such recommendation I earnestly
concur. For further valuable information
and timely recommendations, I ask the
careful attention of the congress to the sec- '
retary's report."
Tho reiorts or the war department are
given In abstract and tho recommendations
concurred In. The death of (Jen. Shorldan
is spoken of thus: ''The doath of lien.
Sheritlan in August last was a national
affile! Ion. Tho army then lost tho grand
estof its chiefs; the country lotn brave
and experienced soldier, a vlso and discreet
counselor aud a modest and sensible man.
Those who in any manner came within the
range of his ersonal association will never
fail to p y deserved and willing homage to
his greatness and the glory of his career;
but they will cherish with more tender
jienalbility the loving memory of his simple,
generous and considerate nature."
The movement for the return or mo Apa
che prisoners to their reservations is spok
en of as a dangerous and ill-judged piece of
philanthropy.
Tho report or the secretary or the navy is
given In abstract and the recommend itions
approved. The same disposition is made of
the postmaster general's report, published
to day, and recommendations made of legis
lative readjustment of much of its machin
ery. The president favors Mr. IMekinsou's
rlan to place the erection or postofnoo build
ngs in the hands of the department, on a
basis of business dono. Much legislation,
reasonable and proper at tho time it was
made, is out of date to day, and should bo
revised for the benefit of the postal estab
lishment. The work of the department of Justice Is
related, special attention boing called to tho
prosecution, in Utah, or offenders against
anti-polygamy laws, and tho opinion is ex
pressed thut under such a firm and vigilant
execution of these laws, and tho advance of
Ideas opposed to the forbidden practices,
polygamy within tho United Statos Is virtu
ally at an end.
Secretary Vilas' report has onof'a4uro
called attention to, that relating to public
lands "We have no excusu for tho v.o'a
tlon of principles cogently taught by reason
and example, nor for tho allowance of pro
texts which have sometimes exposed our
lands to colossal greed. Laws which open
tho door to fraudulent acquisition, or admin
istration which perm ts favor to rapacious
seizure by a favored few of expanded areas
that many should en'oy. aro accessory to
offenses against our national welfare and
humanity, not to be too severely condemned
or punished. Our doar experience ought
sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of
measures of legislation which will confine
tho future disposition of our remaining
agricultural lauds to the uses of actual hus
bandry and genuine homes. Nor should our
vast tracts of so-called desert lands he yield
ed up to the monopo'y of corporations or
grasping individuals, us appears to be much
tho tendency under tho existing statute.
Tho lands require but tho supply of water
to become fertile and productive. It is a
problem of great moment how, most wisely
for the public good, that factor shall b
furnished. I cannot but think it perilous
to suffer either these lands or the sources of
their irrigation to fall into the hands of
monopolies."
Legislation for tho adjustment of stato
grants is recommended, in trie equal Inter
est of the nation, tho states and tho set
tlers. The failure of the Sioux land treaty is
related. The number of rensionors added
to tho rolls during the fiscal year ended
Juno 3), iss. is vo.23, and the Increase of
pensions was granted in 45.7i cases. The
names t lf,730 pensioners wero dropjied
from tho rolls during tho year for various
causes, and ut the close of the year tho
number of persons of all classes receiving
pensions w.is 4.72.r.V. Of these there wero
MV survivors of tho war of 11'. 10,7.j7
widows of tl.oso who served in that war,
1(',(ki soldiers of tho Mexican war and 5,101
widows of said soldiers. One hundred and
two different rates of tensions aro paid to
these beneficiaries, ranging from F-i to
$410 M jer month. Tho amount paid for
pensions during the fiscal year was $7.",(7,
Nil i3. being an increase over the preceding
year of :.OS.MiO 27.
'I am thoroughly convinced," tho presi
dent says, "thut our general pension laws
should be revisod and adjusted to meet as
far us possible, in the Jigt.t of our experi
encc. all meritorious cases. Tho fact that
01 different rates of pensions
aro paid cannot, in my opinion,
bo mado consistent with Jus
tico to tho pensioners, or to tho govern
ment; and the numerous private tension
bills that aro passed predicated upon tho
imperfection of the general laws, which.
while they increase, in many cases, existing
inequality and injustice, lend udditional
force to tho recommendation for a revision
of the general laws on tho subject.
"The laxity of tho ideas prevailing among
a largo number of our ieop:o regarding
jmnsions is becoming every day more
marked. Ihe principles upon which they
should bo granted are in danger of being
altogether ignored, and already pensions
are often claimed becauso the applicants
aro as much entitled as other successful
applicants, rather than upon any disability
reasonably attributable to military servico
If tho estab.ishment of vie ous precedents
bo oont.nw d, und the grunting of pensions
bo not divorced from partisan and other
unworthy and irrelevant considerations.
and if the honorable name of veteran un
fairly becomes by these means but another
term for one who constancy clamors for
tho aid of the government, there is danger
that injury will bo dono to tho fame and
patriotism of many whom our citizens all
delight to honor, and that a prejudice will
be aroused un.ust to meritorious appuca
tion for pensions."

The adjustment of the relations between
the government and tho railroad companies
which have received land grantst and the
guaranty oi me puonc crouii in aia oi wo
construction of their roads, should recoive
early attention, and be treated as a puro!y
business proposition. After making reeom
mendutions relative to the District of Col
umbia, tho president concludes as follows:
"The consciousness that I have presented
but an imperfect statement of tho condition
of the country and its wants occasions no
fear that anyth;ng omitted Is not known
and appreciated by the congress, upon
which rest the rcs)onsibility of intelligent
legislation in behalf of a great nation and a

In many of tbs smaller towns of lows, ss

but all were coirn tint of tbs fact that In tbe
larger cltle, especially the ne towus, where
the sent meut of the majority was sgslnst
tbe enforcement of tbs law. Its execution
would be uu-hlll work and tbat it would be
several years before tbe traflic could
be control ed. Tbe Interior towns of one to
fifteen hundred Inbxblnants were the
, bope of tbe probiMtlouUts. It was
thought that la audi towns the law could be
put Into force at once, an t tbe results would
be so perfectly satisfactory that It would soon
of Itself establish a ntimmt that would
make It uo d.lhVult task to extend ita opera
tions Into the iarcer cities.
Hince Its Inception tbeae smaller towns lve
bad about all they wished to couteiid with
In enforcing tbe law. 'I hi "t;ood" were
