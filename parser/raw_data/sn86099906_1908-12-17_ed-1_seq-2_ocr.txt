THURSuAY, D-CEMBER 17, 1908.
THE BEST POLICY.
Commenting upon the difference
that has arisen between Port Arthur
and Beaumont in regard to certain
freight differentials, the Corpus
Christi Caller very wisely says:-
"We believe the two cities are mak
ing a mistake in thus flying at each
other's throats. Give and take
should be the policy of both, and this
applies not only to Beaumont and Port
Arthur, but to every town and city
on the gulf coast. The sooner the peo
ple realize that they can accomplish a
thousand times more by co-operation
than by individual effort, -the sooner
they will reach tlie goal of their de
sires. "Not so very long ago it was
Brownsville and Corpus Christi who
were regarded as being anything but
friendly to each other. They were
rival towns, and the spirit of rivalry
caused the people of one city to say
things against the other that were
not exactly complimentary. But they
soon saw the folly of their ways. The
two cities are still rivals in that both
are striving to become great and
prosperous, the one before the other;
but neither city is any longer at
tempting to build up by, tearing
down the other. It is a friendly and
honest rivalry such as no map need
be ashamed of.
"This friendly spirit and brotherly
love was amply illustrated at the wat
erways convention held both here an3
at New Orleans. The delegates of
both cities acted in perfect harmony
with the result that, in the first in
stance, through the assistance of Cor
pus Christi, Brownsville got' a conven
tion Tor nest year and through the as
sistance of Brownsville delegates at
New Orleans, Corpus Christi gets the
inland Waterways convention next
December.
"It pays to be reciprocal, and no
"Where does it pay better than between
towns and cities whose welfare and
success depend upon the develop
.,ment of the country."
A nice Christmas idea is suggested
hy a story in Holland's about a -man
. who, instead of sending the usual ex
pensive gifts to his well-to-do friends,
sent various useful gifts to poor peo
. pie in the names of the said friends.
'The latter were much surprised at
'receiving cards of thanks from the
recipients of the bounty which their
"eccentric" friend had indulged in
and credited to their acounts. Why
do we continue to heap up valuable
gifts upon those who are generally
able to buy all they may need, instead
of giving to those who cannot buy
many necessaries for their families?
Christmastlde Is too often fraught
with bitter feelings for many, as they
see the rich enjoying the bounteous
remembrances which their poorer
brethren are denied.
While those members of both sen
ate and house who actually laughed
when President Roosevelt's special
message upon the articles published
in the New York World, in relation
to the alleged scandal in connection
with the Panama Canal transaction,
may appear rude, yet it must be ad
mitted that the president has shown
himself lacking in dignity himself up
on more than one occasion, both in
bis attacks upon congress and upon
other organizations and individuals.
The vituperation indulged in by him
in speaking of the World will in no
way convince anyone of either the
truth or falsity of the charges. The
charges were so monstrous that many
conservative people have been almost
flaliam Colonization
willing to beliive without further in
vestigation tint they were merely a
campaign cacferd. Yet the American
sense of fairness and love of justice
would prefer jto have the matter In
vestigated ani the entire facts made
public. It would be more becoming
in the president, in The Herald's
humble opinion, to permit the matter
to be fully investigated. If the
charges be entirely false, the author
is assuredly beneath the notice of
President Roosevelt, and he can rest
assured that the American people
will see that due justice is done to
any who are proven to have defamed
reputable private citizens, as well as
the government.
The course of Gov. Campbell in
holding up the commissions of certain
1 Bexar county officials, on the grounds
that they may not be relied upon to
enforce the laws against gambling
and controliing the liquor traffic, has
caused considerable comment, and no
little criticism has been his reward.
While the governor may not have act
ed advisedly in presuming before
hand that the said officials will not do
their sworn duty, yet it cannot be de
nied that he .has good grounds, judg
ing by the previous "wide-openness"
of things generally in the Alamo City,
to suppose that the said officials would
not have been elected except with the
understanding between them and the
anti-Sunday law elmont of that city
that thy would not enforce the laws,
'erhaps it might have been more logi
cal, 'had he signed the commissions
and later secured evidence to prove
that the officials were not doing their
duty, when, he might revoke the com
missions of take such steps as-might
be necessary to put the unworthy of
ficers out of office. That some drastic
measures should be aken to force the
county officers to enforce the laws is
very probably true, and Governor
Torn1 will have the support and sym
pathy of all law-abiding citizens in his
efforts to accomplish that end.

Olmito Letter-
To The Herald:
Olmito, Texas, Dec. 12. Owing to
recent heavy rains, this section is in
One shape for winter, so the stock
man is happy.
Notwithstanding the boll weevil,
cotton, especially that planted early,
did well here this year. There have
been 7G2 bales of cotton ginned here
this year. Last year 3C2 bales was
the record.
J C. Bennett will gin once more
this season. No date is set yet' for
the final ginning. Your correspondent
has been informed that Col. Gay pro
duced 31 bales of cotton on 25 acres
of ground and did his share of feed
ing the boll weevils, too.
Those fine yam potatoes raised by
Mr. Tandy are far superior for the
table, even to the commercial banana.
Your turnip, neighbor, is some
what, "poco tardy." A fine quantity
of turnips was brought to your cor
respondent nearly two months since,
many of which out-weighed your
Brownsville specimen, by 1 oz.; also
a fine sample of yams, both brought
by the benevolent Miss Philpott of
San Benito. Miss Philpott raised cot
ton and corn on her farm, which did
as well as the turnips and yams in
point of -yielding.
Will some sage of the soil condi
tions, etc.. tell why every farm in
this fertile Valley does not. produce
yam potatoes?
Boyce Burress saw twelve peppers
weighed in'San Benito and the twelve
tipped the beam at 13 pounds. These
peppers sell for 13 cents per lb.
Seems as though it pays to raise
pepper.
Truly, there are various ways of
making an honest living in this fertile
Rio Grande Valley.
A family moved to our hustling
Brownsville country about three
weeks since, who anxiously inquired
of Si. lady who had visited this place
before, if cotton could be raised here.
The boll weevil made it impossible
to raise the fleecy staple at their old
home in Louisiana, so ' they came
here.
Mrs. Terrell, our efficient teacher,
will given an entertainment and
Christmas tree at the school house
on the Bennett farm Christmas eve.
Everybody is cordially invited to par
ticipate. Mrs. Tandy has returned home
after many months visit to her old
home at Meridian. Mrs. Tandy also
made a" visit to her young son, Master
Clieve, who is in school at Fort
Worth.
Mrs. S. O. Tansill and two little
girls have joined Mr. Tansill at his
home near Olmito.
Mrs. R. G. Rhodes of West Co
lumbia, the "old capitol," of Texas, is
spending the winter with her sister,
Mrs. King at Olmito.
