RECORDS TELL A STORY.
A certain newspaper in Raleigh "it
self an organized hypocrisy' has had
much to say about the employment, by
Gov. Russell, of counsel to assist the
Attorney General in the important
railroad litigation pending in the courts,
in many respects the most important
that has arisen in the State during its
existence. While the statutes do not
contemplate that the Attorney General
of the State shall appear for the State
in all matters where the State is inter
ested, as no provision is made for the
expense that would be necessarily in
curred in so doing, and it would be im
possible to do so, and also to be in at
tendance upon the sitting of the Su
preme court for about seven months in
the year, still one would think from
the wild statements made by the above
referred to newspaper, that not a cent
had been paid for extra legal services
prior to the present administration. A
cursory glance at the Auditor's reports
shows that more than $46,000 were
paid out for additional legal help dur
ing the terms of Attorney General
Kenan, Davidson and Osborne. In
some instances it was probably properly
expended, as when the Attorney Gen
era! was not able to attend to the par
ticular business by reason of pressing
public duties elsewhere; in many other
instances the Attorney General doubt
less could and ought to have attended
to the same without the employment
of any other counsel. The statutes
authorizing the Governor to employ
coulsjI were passed with a view to
giving the legal officer of the S:ate as
sistance in cases of great importance,
in which it become necessary to secure
the ablest It gal talent to be found to
meet the formidable array of lawyers
against the State. But be all this as it
may, the examination of the Auditor's
ports disclose the facts and lays bare
the contemptible and sneaking hypoc
risy of certain Democratic "axe grind
ers" and "organ grinders."
TIME EXTENDED.
Ia 1893 the Inter state Commerce
Commission passed an order rcquir
ing the railroad companies to place air
brakes and oth r safety appliances
upon their freight cars for the better
protection of life. Recently the rail
roads aeked for an exteneion of the
time allowed to complete" the work.
Last week the Commission extended
the time two years Of course this
will meet with approval if the time
given was too short. But the Commis
sion should not fail to insist on a strict
compliance with the act of Congress
requiring the appliances. The numer
ous fatalities among railroad men by
reason of badly constructed cars should
be a sufficient irc3ntive to the railroad
companies themselves in thi3 matter.
WHY IS IT?
To usa a slang phras3 the Raleigh
correspondent of the Charllotte Obser
ver "spoke a parable" when he wrote
recently:
"The question now is whether the
two conventions of cotton growers, or
indeed a score of such conventions,
can have any effect in uniting the far
mer8. It is remarked that of all classes
the farmers have the greatest power
and know less how to use it. They
know nothing of organfz Uion and dis
trust each other as to crops and to any
unity of action."
"Of all classes, the farmers have the
greatest power and know less how to
use it:" there's the whole thing in a nut
shell. "'Tis true 'tis pity 'tis 'tis true."
?he clipping from Farmers' Voice,
wfiich we publish on the first page,
contains some food for thought. The
writer of it speaks a truth, which,
while not generally recognized as such,
is none the less the truth when he says
that a "broader and mora inviting
field is open to intelligent farmers than
to any other class in this country."
The time has come when the unscien
tific and "slip shod" methods of farm
ing must go. We must have intelligent,
far seeing farmers who make the farm
their study. For such men there is
really a broad and inviting field.
THE COTTON CROP.
We have received from Lathan,
Alexander & Co., Bankers and Cotton
Commission Merchants, 16 and 18 Wall
St , New York," an estimate of the
United States Cotton Crop of 1897-1898.
Latham, Alexander & Co , we will say
are said to furnish as reliable esti
mates as to cotton and its price as any
firm known. Their figures are, of
course, not perfectly accurate, but they
are doubtless as nearly eo as any that
can now be obtained:
"Basing our calculations upon an ex
hau8tive correspondence with all the
cotton growing counties in the Southern
States, reliable information secured
from individuals and from travelers
through the South, and upon the per
centages of the crop marketed at num
erous points, eay they, the following is
our estimate of the total yield- by
8tates": .
TotalCrop. Bales.
Alabama 1,109 000
Arkansas 852,000
Florida 66 000
Georgia... 1.430.000
Louisiana 703 000
Mississippi . . .v 179 000
North Carolina 594 0( 0
SouthT 875 000
Tennessee, etc 395,000
Texas and Indian Territory. . 2,785,000
Total 10,188 000
Continuing, the letter says that
"during the month of July the crop
generally promised well, and large esti
mates of the yield were made, but in
August and September, adverse condi
tions prevailed and a marked deteriora
tion accurred. Drought was the princi
pal causa. During October and the
greater part of November favorable
weather was the rule, and the crop has
been materially increased thereby.
"AlthoUgh the crop was planted late,
the drought forced cotton to early ma
turity, and our correspondents say up
to this date the crop has been marketed
rapidly.
' 'In our opinion, the movement hence
forth will not prove to be in excess of
the movement of a normal cotton year.
"For a time quarantine restrictions
in a portion of the South retarded ship
ments, but to a much smaller extent
than was generally supposed.
The following additional figures pre
pared by the same firm show the posi
tion of cotton and prices on Demember

' SAN JOSE SCALE.
Pro'. W. F. Massey, Horticulturist,
Botanist and Entomologist N. C. Ex
periment Station and Pest Commis
sioner, writiDgin the Southern Planter
for December says that h?has recently
received from a new point in North
Carolina a specimen of lilac densely in
fested with the San Joso scale. He
says that he hag never had a report of
its attacking the lilac, and calls atten
tion to this fact, so that nurserymen
and others may be on their guard, as
they may not expect it on this plant.
"The plants named," continues Mr.
Massey, "were brought here from
Pennsylvania. Kerosene "spraying is
proving perfectly effectual. Oae place
slightly infested last spring has been
completely cleaned without damage by
spraying, when in full leaf, all kinds of
trees."

TRUTH.
The recent death of Gen. Clingman, (
poor ana inenaiess in the titate
Hospital at Morganton brings more
forcibly tc mind a bit of poetry which
Longfellow once wrote. This poem,
however, is one of those bits of litera
ture which contains more truth tjian
poetry:
"The soldier asked for bread,
But they waited till he was dead,
And gave him a stone instead,
Sixty and one feet high."
INJUSTICE TO PUBLISHERS.
In our issue of November 16 th, we
published a letter from Mr. T. W.
Wood, regarding the injustice done
seedsmen by the government. A re
cent issue of Farm and Home, com
plain of injustice to publishers of farm
papers in a pointed article, entitled,
"More Extravagance Stop It I"
Ic is as follows :
"Now it is Secretary Wilson who has
got the .printing fever. He is going to
ask Congress for a lot of money with
which to print hundreds of tons of ad
ditional documents for the United
States Department of Agriculture
But it has not yet been made clear
why the government should go into the
business of furnishing free documents
and agricultural papers to farmers, es
pecially when the regular press is is
suing such a quantity, -variety and
quality of agricultural matter at nom
inal prices vIf the government ia go
ing to do the publishing business of the
country, let it furnish all the books and
papers now published, for literary or
special purposes Why government
should seek to monopolize agricultural
publishing is not clear. There are a
thousand and one ways in which'the
department of agriculture can use
money to better advantage than by
printing additional Ions of "pub does,"
a large proportion of which finally go
to the junk shop. This printing abuse
extends to all departments, and is part
and parcel of the free seed humbug
and similar extravagances. If the in
coming congress wants to serve and
please the people, let it economize.
Millions of public funds are worse than
wasted, Extravagance has run riot.
In 1870 Federal expenditures got down
$300,000,000 for the year, and gradually
decreased until in 186 (after some
years of good time?) it cost only $242,
500,000 to run the national govern
ment. But with the advent of hard
times, public extravagance so increased
that the expenses averaged $358 600,000
annually for the three years 1894 5-6.
It cost 50 per cent, more to run the
government during the recent bard
times than in the good times before
1887 1 This thing has got to stop, or
new taxes will have to be imposed to
meet the increasing deficiency caused
by increasing extravagance. Both
parties have been guilty of this sin,
both should unite in reform.
The Southern Planter, for December,
also takes a firm stand against this ex
penditure of money which is a$ once
UDjust to publishers and a waste of the
people's money.;
The Planter says:
"We think ;the Sscretary (of Agri
culture) makes a mistake when he
proposes to increase the i33ue of free
literature from the department. We
believe that much of that already is
sued is wasted. This is largely evi
denced by the fact that the sales of such
copes of reports and publications, as
can only be had by payment, are very
email. That which can be obtained
for nothing is rarely appreciated or
valued. An extension of the free pub
lication and distribution of agricul
tural literature is an unfair competi
tion with the publishers of agricultural
journals, to which no other class of
publishers or businesses are sub lected,
and ought not to be favored. The
basis of this government is, equal
equal rights to all and favors to none."

Brother King, of Kirg'a Weekly, is
in "tough luck." His foreman has
been celebrating recently, and he, hav

now advertising for a printer who
doesn't use fire water.
The editor of the Dale County (Ala )
News has made the following appeal to
subscribers: "Friends, a little help
would be appreciated very much can't
you bring us some sweet potatoes or
corn? An editor once choked himself
to death trying to eat grass."
The Raleigh News & Observer has

paper recently started here. The Post,

appeared on time and is quite a lively

"When I'd get my paper all eetupend

a washstand, get it all leveled down
well in the chase, or the f razee in which
it was locked up, and then I'd call the
hired girl. She weighed about 210
pounds when she eat don. That's
what I wanted sitting down weight.
So after the hired girl cams in I icked
the type, laid oyer it the ebeet of paper
and on top of that the blanket, and then
I politely invited the hired girltoeit
down on the washstand. Two hun
dred and ten pounds, remember! The
result was just as good an impression
as you could get on any $100 hand
press made in the United Starrs. My
edition in those , days was about 230
copies, and the hired girl waa good for
the job at one sitting or rather 230
sittings. And she took an icte rest ia
it, too, and was just as ready for busi

WATCH HILTy
Watch that man about whom the
plutocratic press tells no lies. Think
twice before you vote him. Watch
that paper about which the plutocratic
press tells no lies. Think twice before
you subscribe for it. There's more
sense than fun in a little j y;e frcra
Puck. "I'm afraid," sain the candi
date, gloomily, "the other side has me
beaten and they know it " "Why do
you think so?" a&ked his friend. "Weil,
there are very few campaign lies being
circulated about me." Plutocrats and
monopolists don't waste their powder
on dead game.
A FOOLISH MAN.
What would you think cf a man who
fights another man armed with a gun
with ail modern improvements when
he himself has but a trifling eld bow
and arrow? You would probably call
him a fool perhaps something worse.
You would laugh at him. And yet,
did it ever occur to you that the farmer
who refuses to j in the Alliance cr
other farmers's organization is acting
just as foolishly ? He is trying to figbt
the monopolists who have modem,
well-supported organizations, when he
himself is alone, single-handed, using
the same weapons, we might say, which
were used by labor centuries ago.

CHEEK.
The position of the North Carolina
Democracy is now known to be fully
in accord with the Chicago platform,
and with W. J. Bryan. No honest
white man, who favors free silver and
genuine reform in both S sate and na

himself with the Democratic party.
Kinston Free Press.
We fancy that it requires a lot cf
cheek to read that section of the Demo

many on its success, and straight
make a statement like the above. But
some people will do almost anything
for the "good of the party."
"It seems to me you are r&tner
