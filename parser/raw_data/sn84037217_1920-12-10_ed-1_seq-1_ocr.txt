LEWISBURQ-, WEST VIRGINIA. FRIDAY MORNING-. DECEMBER 10. 1920
NUMBER 25
ROAD LEGISLATION TO BE ENACTED.
1 n connection willi the ratifica
tion of the $50,000,000 road bond
issue amendment by a majority in
excess ??r 100,000 at the general
election on November 2. the neces
sary legislation will be enacted at
Ihe coming session of the Legisla
ture. which convenes on January
12. to provide For the issuance of
portion of the amount authorized
;ind for the beginning of road con
struction work early in the spring
of 1921, if arrangements can be
perfected by that time. However,
jl is doubtful if legislation will be
linally enacted before March or
April, owing to another change in
Ihe West Virginia constitution,
which limits the Legislature during
the lirst fifteen days of its session
lo the introduction of bills, the
new constitutional amendment pro
viding that no bills so introduced
shall be acted upon until after
the Wednesday following the sec
ond Monday of March, when the
Legislature reassembles.
One of the lirst steps in formu
lating legislation to moke the new
amendment effective will be the
uppointinent of a joint legislative
committee by the Governor to
draft legislation covering the is
suance of bonds. The jiew system
authorized by the ratification of
the constitutional amendment puts
the control of construction of the
state highways under the State
I toad Commission instead of under
the county courts, as was the case
heretofore. The road system of
West Virginia will connect virtu
ally every county seat in West Vir
gi nia.
It is not probable, according to
Ihe best information obtainable,
thai more than -sr>.000.000 or *10,
000,000 in road bonds will be is
sued at first as it is believed that
some time will be required to con
struct the permanent roads frojin
the proceeds of even that large an
issue of bonds.
MATCH FOR BILLY SUNDAY.
Mary A. Vichestain. age 12, is
Pittsburg's rival to Hilly Sunday.
I lei* subjects range from the sim
plest lessons of the Bible to a re
futation of the Darwinian theory
of organic evolution. She is a
daughter of Joseph Vichestain.
for.iner police court magistrate, and
,i)w editor of a labor paper.
She has been preaching in the
churches of Pittsburg, since she
was !) years old. She has lately at
tracted the attention of national
church figures and is being ac
claimed as one of the most remark
able child evangelists the world
has ever known.
Off the rostrum she is shy and
almost a different little girl, but
hut when she apears before an au
dience there is an immediate
change und a whirlwind of oratory
follows, resembling generally that
of Billy Sunday.
Besides preaching in New Castle
I'a., she has addressed audiences
in Cleveland and many of the vil
liiijcs and townships near Pitts
burg.
FOR RELIEF OF FARMERS,

ilitation of that body would go a
long step towards furnishing the
desired relief by financing exports
of surplus crops.

told the conference he planned to
introduce measures making avail
able the profits of the Federal He
serve Hunks, amounting to about
?%11.000.000 for loans to agricultur
al interests.

I NEW INDUSTRY AT LONGDALE
Here is an article from a recent
number of the Hichjnond Tunes- J
Dispatch which we feel assured i
will interest many of our readers:
The announcement of the resig- j
nation of W. I.. Wight as Secretary
of the Southern Manufacturing
Company. with which he has been j
connected for the past twenty- J
nine years, to bccqtue Vice-Presi
dent and Trasurcr of Wight &
(Company. Inc.. calls attention to
one of Virginia's new industries, a
result of the World War.
For years the blast furnaces of
Virginia have been accumulating
vast quantities of slag, the unused
product from each cast of pig iron.
Kxcept for track ballast for rail
road. surfacing the highways in the
pig iron sections of the State, and
its general use for roofing, no oth
ier use was made in Virginia of the
1 by-products of the furnaces ? al
though in other sections of the
country it has been extensively us
ed as an aggregate in mass and re
inforced concrete construction.
It. C. Wight. President of the
company, having volunteered for
ar,my service during the war. and
noteing the general scarcity of ma
terial for government road build
ing. conceived the idea of utilizing
this large cacumulation of slag at
the Virginia * furnaces. Meeting
with great success in this enter
prise he used the accumulation at
most of the furnaces in the State,
and then purchased the Longdalc
property, near Clifton Forge. Va.. i
j where there was an accumulation
of several million tons of this slag
i from nearly one hundred years op
eration of the furnaces.
They have just completed the
erection of a large crushing and J
screening plant to prepare this slag |
jfor commercial purposes, and for
reclaiming by magnetic process,
the metallic iron to be found in it
Their plant is modern in every re
spect. is run by electric power, the
capacity being about one thousand |
tons per day. :
The Longdate furnace was in op- 1
eration for nearly a century, and |
until discontinued a few years ago i
was one of the brag furnaces.
This company now has a well
established business with the na
tional and State governments, and
also with railroads and general
contractors.
W. L Wight is a brother-in-law
of Mrs. J. N. Caldwell, of "Elm
hurst," and is well known to the
people of this community where
he has spent a portion of the sujii
jner for the past ten years with the
Caldwells. ,R. C. Wight, brother
of W. L., has already had the most
gratifying success in the operation
of the new business hut has only
now gotten the foundations laid for
a very large and profitable business
j hereafter.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO
| CONGRESS.
President Wilson's last annual
message 1 1 > Congress was sent l?> ;
that hotly hv messenger instead of
being delivered hy hi.ni in person.'
At the last moment the President
yielded to the viws of his physician
an<l; Mrs. Wilson and did not ven
ture to test his strength by going !
to the Capitol.
The message was comparatively <
short and did not take up the ques- 1
tion of the peace treaty in any j
form, referring to the League of j
Nations only by inference in his '
opening sentences, where he quot
ed Lincoln's "let us have faith that
j right makes might, and in that
j faith let us dare to do our duty as j
we understand it."
H|s concrete recommendations
to Congress in the message were:
Revision of the tax laws with '
simplifying of the ineojinc and
profits taxes.
Indpendcnce for the Philippines.
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in Government appro
priations and expenditures and
creation of a "workable budget
system."
Cold storage and other laws af
fecting the cost of living.
Federal licensing of corporations
as Recommended in previous mes
sages.
'Rehabilitation and training of
disabled soldiers and sailors. The
President did not indorse a bonus.
At its close the President wrote a
paragraph which might be regard- i
ed jis a valedictory saying:
''If have not so much laid before |
you* a series or recommendations
as sought to utter a confession of i
fnith. of the faith in which 1 was
i held and which il is my solemn
purpose to stand by until my last
lighting day. 1 believe this to be i
the faith of America, the faith of the
future, and of all the victories {
I which await national action in the!
clays to come whether in America
' or elsewhere."

WHAT THE LEAGUE IS COSTING.
What the League of Nations, or
ganized to maintain peace and now,
in session at Geneva, Switzerland,

in the various classes will have to I
pay during next year are as follows !
First class, 9101.700; second class.
-SM.080; third class. $02,700; fourth i
class, ?11,010; fifth class. *20,020;

THAT APE. |
Now we have another report of ?
the ape. gorilla or whatever form '
of man or beast it may be said to ;
be roaming around through this '.
section which many claim to have
seen.
Wednesday night. Dec. 8th, a
little after ten o'clock Calvin Hook
stool was returning horse-back
from Lewisburg to his home on
Muddy Creek mountain. When he
had gotten about one hundred
yards past the home of H. A. Mur
rill, on the HI ue Sulphur pike, he
says he heard a strange noise such
as would be made by a bear or
some other animal of the kind
when suddenly something sprang
frointhe roadside and raked him
with its claws tearing his army
overcoaf and trousers which he
showed. The horse was greatly
frightened, could not be forced to
go on, but turned quickly and ran
furiously back to town. Mr. Hook
stool, in the darkness, could not
see what it was that gave the horse
such a fright. Mayor H. M. Hell,
Henry Gilmer and others went at
once to the scene of the adventure
with Mi\ G's dogs. They could
find no track or other sign of an
animal.
So the proof of the appearance
of the what-is-it is not yet satis
factory.

& Ohio Railroad has applied to the
Interstate f'ommeree Commission
for authority to issue 92.690,000

CAMPAIGN FOB SABBATH OBSERVANCE.
Bishop Joseph K. Berry of Phila
delphia, who presided at the meet
ing of the hoard of bishops of the
Methodist Church. at Atlantic City
Nov. 29th. asserted that the Church
would support enthusiastically the
campaign which tlie Lords Day Al
liance intends to start in thirty
nine States to obtain laws compell
ing strict observance of the Sab
bath.
The South Carolina Methodist
Conference in session at George
town, S. C.. unanimously indorsed
a Sunday law abolishing all Sunday
trains, newspapers, mails and post
olliee hours, to set aside Sunday as
a day of rest for very Federal and
Interstate employe. Noah \V. Coop
er. of Nashville, who addressed
the conference, declared that every
one who rode on a Sunday train or
used the mails on Sunday, or read
a Sunday newspaper, was prosti
tuting the Sabbath. He predicted
that if America did not stop these
things, and observe the Sabbath,
the country would, in 30 years, be
in a plight similinr to that of Ger
many.
The proposed campaign ^ raises
an important question touching
both the power and the wisdom of
interference by Congrss or State
Legislatures in matters of religious
faith and practice.
GIRLESS TELEPHONE.
The girlless telephone has come
to New York. Early this spring
three exchanges are to be opened
where the caller on a telephone
will make his own call and will
no longer hear a gentle voice re
spond, "Line busy." The new sys
lein will enable the caller to get in
stantaneous service."
A small dial is attached to each
telephone. The person desiring the
call simply sets the dial at the num
her wanted and the machine does
the rest. The called number is rung
and if busy, the machine says so
without any human agency inter
vening. If the number is not busy
the connection is made at once.

as high as $7 per ton for handling "
the coal and that generally the
prolit of the defendants ranged
from $2.50 to $7 per ton.
GREAT FAITH IN PRAYERS.
Mrs. Robert House was not ,niur
dretl and left lying across the grave
of her dead husband, at Sylvester.
Ga., so said Sheriff Summers when

ed that she had obtained clothing
and had them ready. Tools also
were ready to open the grave. The.
