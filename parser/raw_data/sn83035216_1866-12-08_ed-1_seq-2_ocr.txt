RESTORATION OF THE STATES.
Tn my uiessuge of the 4th of December, i
1865, Congress was informed of the ihosif-1
tires wMeh had been instituted by the 1
Executive with a view to the gradual res- j
toratrftn of the States in which the insur-1
rection occurred to their relations with !
the General Government. Provisional j
Govonera had been appointed, Convert- j
tious called, Governors elected, Legisla
tures assembled, the senators and Uepre- !
seutatives chosen to the Congress of!
.1 . ir .. I . . . cv
xno cniioti .-tates. courts iia.l .ecu :
veuuu lor me cinoi cement oi laws long
in abeyance. Ihe blockade had been
removed, custom-houses re-established,
and the internal revenue laws put in
force, in order that the people might con
tribute to the national income. Postal
operations had been renewed, and efforts
were being made to restore them to their
former condition and efficiency. The
States themselves had been asked to take
part in tho high function of amending the
v: Constitution; and f thus sanctioning the !
extinction of African slavery as one of!
tho legitimate results of our internecine!
struggle. j
Having progressed thus far. the Exccii-!
tive department found that it had accom
plished nearly all that was within the
scope of its constitutional authority.
One thing, however yet remained to be
done before the work of restoration
could be completed, and that was the ad
mission to Congress of loyal Senators and
Representatives from the States whose
people had rebelled against law ful author
ity of the General Government. This
question devolved upon the respective
Houses, which, by the Constitution are
. miwTe the judges of tho elections, returns,
and qualifications of their own members;
and its ccnsMcration at once engaged the
attention of Congress. .
In tho meantime, the Executive De
partment no other plan having been
v projosed by Congress continued in its
efforts to perfect, as far as was practible
the restoration of tho proper relations be
tween tw citizens ot tlio respective
' States, and tho Federal Government,!
extending, from time to time, as the pub-1
lie intrests seem to require, the judicial, i
revenue and postal systems of the cou-n-'
try. ' .
AVitli the axtvk-e Mid cnse:.t of tho
Senate tlio necessary officers were ap-
Kiuled, and appropriating made by
ingress for the payment of their sala
ries. Tho proposition to amend the Fed
eral constitution, so as to prevent the
., existence nof slavery within the United
States or subject to their jurisdiction,
was- ratified by the requisite number of
. States; audi ou the 18th day of Decern-
, ber, 180or k was oflictirlly declared to
, have become valid as a part of the Con
stitution of the United States. All of
the States in which the insurrection had
existed promptly amended their Consti
tutions so as to make them conform to
' tho great change thus effected in tho or
ganic law of the land; declared null and
void all ordinances- wl laws of secession ;
. repudiated ull pretended debts and obli
gations created for the revolutionary pur
poses of the insurrection ; and proceeded
in good faith, to the enactment of meas-
' urcs for the protection and amelioration
of the condition of the colored race.
Congress however, yet hesitated to admit
any of these States to representation ;
and it was not until towards the close of
1 the eighth month of the session that an
exception was made iu favor of Teuiics
oe, by the admission of her Senators and
Representatives. ,

I
EXCLUSION OF LOYAL SOUTHERN SENATORS AND
REPRESENTATIVES.
I deem it a subject of profound regret
that Congress has thus far failed to admit
to seats loyal Senators and Rcpresenta-
tives troin the other Mutes, whose inhab
itants, with those of Tennessee, had en
gaged in tho rebellion. Ten States
more thmuc-burth of tho whole num
ber rcnt&iu without rcpresenta. ion; the
. seats of fifty nembers in the House ot
Representative and of twenty members
in tho Senate are jet vacant not by
1 heir own consent, not by a failure of elec
tion, but by the refusal of Congress to
Aocept their credentials. Their udmis
nion, it is believed, would have uccoin
plisliel much towards the renewal and
strengthening of ouj; relations as one peo
ple, and removed serious cause for discon
tent oik the part ot the inhabitants of
those-States, It would have accorded
with tbw grwit irineiplo enunciated in
theDecUrstioo ofCVmcncau Independence
that no people ought to bear the burden
of taxation, and yet be den ied the right
of representation. It would have beeu
fit consonance with the exores prvvis-
ions of the Constitution, that each f
ich Statu
shall' htwe- at least one Representative"
and "that tu State, without its con,ctrf,
shall be deprived of Ms equal suffrage
"in the Senate." Tlics prov isions wen
intended to aecure every State, and to
tho people of every State, the right of
representation in each House of Congress
and so important was it deemed by thy
frainert- of the Constitution that the
equality of the States in tho Seuate
thould bo preserved, that not even by an
amendment of the Constitution can any
State, without its oousent, be dcuied a
voice in that branch of the i'iitional
i
,
INTEGRITY OF THE STATES.
li u true, it lias becu assumed that thV
existence of tho States wns tcrminnted by
the rebellious nets of their hihnhitants,
nntV thnt tho insurrection having ;becn
snpjtassed, they were thenceforward to
lie considered merely ns conquered terri
tories. The legislative, Executive and
Judicial Departments of the Ooveiiiftwut
have, however, with great dis'inctness
and uniform consistencv refused to sanc
tion an assumption so incompatible- with
the nature of our republican system and
the professed objects of the war. Throng n
out the recent legislation rf Congress the
undeniable- fact makes itself apparent that
these ten political communities are no
thing less than States of this I'sinik At
tli very commencement of the rebellion,
each IUxtse declared, with a infr.imity as
remarkable as it was significant that the
war' trts "waged, upon our part in any
spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose
of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose
of overthrowing or interfering with tho
rights or established institutions of those
States, but to defend ami maintain the
supremacy of the Constitution nnd all
laws made in pursuance thereof, and to
preserve tho Union with all the dignity,
equality, nnd rights of the several States
unimpaired; and that as soon as these ob
jects'' were "accomplished the war ought
to cease." In some instances, Senators
were permitted to continue their legisla
p ,
. T'
tive functions, while in other instances
resentatives were elected and admit
ted to scats after their States had for
mally declared their right to withdraw
from the Union, and were endeavoring to
maintain that right by force of arms.
All of the States whose people were in in
surrection, as States, were included in the
apportionment of the direct tax of twenty
millions of dollars annually laid upou the
United States by the act approved 5th
August, 1801. Congress by the act of
March 4, 1SC2, and bv the. apportionment
of representation tKereunder, also re
cognized their presence as States in the
Union; and they have, for judicial pur
poses, been divided into districts, as States
alone can be divided. The same recog
nition appears in the recent legislation in
,TVreiuc to Tcnuesscc,
winch evidentlv
rests upon the fact
the State were not
hellion, but merely
that the functions of
destroyed by the re-
&!iicnitiktrtil .iiid tliof
principle is ot toursc applicable to those
States which, like Tennessee, attempted
to renounce their places in the I mon.
The action of the Executive Department
oi the government upon this suhject has
been equally definite and uniform, and the
purpose of the war specially stated in the
Proclamation issued by my predecessor
on me tiay oi reritemner, iwt. it
was then solemnly proclaimed and declar
ed that "hereafter, as heretofore, the wa
will be prosecuted for the object of practi
cally restoring the constitutional relation
between the United States and each of
the States and the people thereof, in which
States that relation is or may be suspend
ed or disturbed."
The recognition of the States by' the
Judicial Department of the Government
has also been clear and conclusive in all
proceedings affecting them as States, had
in the Supreme, Circuit, ami District
Courts.
QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS.
In the admission of Senators and Repre
sentatives from any and all of the States,
there can be no just ground of apprehen
sion that persons who arc disloyal will be
clothed with the powers of legislation; for
this could not happen when the Constitu
tion and the laws are enforced by a vigi
lant and faithful Congress. Each House
is made the "judge of the elections, re
turns, and qualifications of its own mem
bers," and may, "with the concurrence of
two-thirds, expel a member." When a
Senator or Representative presents his
certiUjato of election, he niav at once be
admitted or rejected; or should there be
any question as to his eligibility, his
credentials may be referred for investi
gation to the appropriate committee. If
admitted to a scat, it must lc upon
evidence satisfactory to the House of
wliic-h he thus becomes a member, that
he possess the requisite constitutional and
legal qualifications, it refused admission
as a member lor want of due allegiance to
the Government, aiTd returned to his con
stituents, they, are admonished that none
but persons loyal to the I mte States
will bo allowed a voice in the Legislative
Councils of the Nation, and the political
power and moral influence f Congress
are thus effectively exerted in 'tire interest
of loyaltv to the Government and fidelity
to tho L liion. Upou this question, so
vitally aflbcting the restoration of the
Union and the permanency of our present
form of government, my convictions,
heretofore expressed, liave undergone no
change; but, on tho contrary, their cor
rectness has been confirmed Ly reflection
and time. If the admission of loyal mem
bers to seats in the respective Houses of
Congress was wise ami -expedient a year
ago, it is no less wise and expedient now.
If this anomalous condition is right now
if, in the exact condition of these States
at tho present time, it is lawful to exclude
them from representation, I do not see
that the question will bo changed by the
efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these
States remain as they are, the right of
representation will bo no stronger the
'right of exclusion will Ik-no weaker
ADVANTAGE OF ADMITTING LOYAL SOUTHERN
MEMBERS.
The Constitution of tho United States
makes it the duty of the President to re
commend to tho consideration of Con
gress "such measures as he shall judge
necessary or expedient. I know ot no
measure more imperatively demanded by
every consideration ot national interest,
sound policy, and equal justice, tsaii the
admission of the loyal members from the
now unrepresented States. This would
consummate the work of restoration, and
exert a most salutary influence in the re
establishment of peace, harmony and fra
ternal feeling. It would tend greatly to
renew tho confidence of the American
people in tho vigor and stability of their
institution. It would bind us more
closely together as a nation, ami enable us
to show the world tho inherent and re
cuperative power of a Government found
ed upon tho will of tho people, and
i-stablished noon tho in bwi'ilcs nf lilxrtv.
just we and intelligence. Our increased
i . . . . . . .
ttttvvgih and cnlxnired prosperity would
u reii againy demonstrate the laluicy ot the
a rgaiuents against fa institutions drawn
from our recent putioiwl disorder by tho
enemies of republican government The
admission ot, loyal members froiu tW
States now excluded from Congress. y
allaying doubt and apprchcusion would
t uj ii capital, now awaiting an opportunity
for investment, into the channels of trade-
aud industry. It would alleviate the
present troubled condition of those States
and by inducing emigration, aid iu the
settlement of fertile regions now un
cultivated, and lead to an increased pro
duction Of those staples which have added
so greatly to the wealth of the nation nnd
tho Commerce of the world. New fields
of enterprise weuld be opened to out pro
gressive people, and soon the devastations
of war would bo repaired, and all traees
of our domestic differences effaced from
tlv minds of our f ottntrymeiT,
THE WORDS OF WASHINGTON, JEFFERSON, AND
JACKSON.
Iff cr efforts to preserve "tho unity of
Government which constitutes ns one
peoplej" by restoring ' the States- to the
condition which they! held prior to tho
rebellion, we should Ihj cautious, lest,
having rescue! our nation from peril of
threatens! ftistntegrrtion, we resort to
consolidation, and in tho end absoluto
despotism, as a remedy for the recurrence
of similar troubles) The War hnting ter
minated, and with it; all occasion for the
exercise of powers of doubtful constitu
tionality, wc should hasten to bring
legislation within tho boundaries pre
scribed by the Constitution, and to return
to the ancient landmarks established by
our lathers fort lie guidance ot succeeding
generations. "The Constitution which
nt any time exists, until changed by an
explicit and authentic act ot the whole
poirple, is sacredly obligatory upon all."
"If in the opinion of the people, the dis
tribution or modification of tho con
stitutional powers be, in any particular,
wrong, let it be corrected by an amend
ment in the way in which the constitution
designates. Rut let there lie no change
by usurpation; tor "it is the customary
weapon by which free governments are
destroyed!'' Washington spoko these
words to his countrymen, when followed
bv their love and gratitude, he voluntarily
retired from the cares of public life. "To
keep in all things within the pale of our
constitutional powers, nnd cherish the
Federal Union as the only rock of safety,'
were prescribed by Jefl'erson as rules of
action to endear to his "countrymen the
true principles of their Constitution, nnd
promote a union of sentiment and nction
equally auspicious to their happiness and
safety. Jackson held'that the action ot
General Government should always be
strictly confined to the sphere ofitsap
propiate duties, and justly and forcibly
urged that our tjovernment is not to oe
'maintained nor our Union preserved "bv
invasions of the rights and powers of the
several States. In thus attempting to
make our General Government strong, wo
make it weak. Its true strength consists
in leaving individuals and States nsmueh
as'possible to themselves; in making itself
felt, not in its power, but m its bench
cencr ; not in its control, but iu its protec
tion; not in binding the States more closely
to the centre, but leaving each to move
unobstructed in its proper constitutional
orbit." These are the teachings of men
whose deeds and services have made them
illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn
from the scenes of life, have left to their
country the rich legacy of theirexainple,
their wisdom, and their patriotism. Draw
ing fresh inspiration from their lessons,
let us emulate them in love of country and
respect for the Constitution and the laws.
TREASURER'S REPORT.
Tho report of the Secretary of tho Treas
ury affords much information respecting
the revenue and commerce of the country.
His views upon the currency, and with
reference to a proper adjustment of our
revenue system, internal as well as impost,
arc commended to the careful considera
tion of Congress. In my last annual mes
sage I expressed my general views upon
these subjects. I need now only call at
tention to the necessity of carrying into
every . department of the Government a
system ot rigid accountability, thorough
retrenchment, and wise economy. 'With
no exceptional nor unusual expenditures,
the oppressive burdens of taxation can bo
lessened oy such a modification of our rev
enue laws as will be consistent with the
public faith, and the legitimate and neces
sary wants of the Government.
The report presents a much more satis
factory condition of our finances than one
year ago the most sanguine could have
anticipated. During the fiscal year ending
the 3oth June, 1SG5, the last year of the
war, the public, debt was increased $841
902,537, and on the 31st of October, 1865,
it amounted to 2,;40,854,750. On the
31st day of October, 1800, it had been re
duced to ?2,oo 1 ,ti 1 1 ,000, the diminution,
during a period of fourteen mouths, com
mencing September 1st, 1B65, and ending
October 31st, 1SC0, having been f -206,570,
50). In the last annual report on the
state of the finances, it was estimated that
luring the three quarters of the fiscal year
ending the 30th ot June last, the debt
would be increased $1 12,194,947, During
that period, however, it was reduced w 1
196,387, the receipts ot the year having
been $89, 905.905 more, and the expendi
tures $200,51 9 ,235 less than the estimates.
XothiMg could more clearly indicate than
these statements the cxteut and availa
bility of the national resources, and tho
rapidity and safety with which, under our
form of government, great military and
naval establishments can be disbanded,
and expenses reduced from a war to a
peace footing.
JJurnig the fiscal year ending 30th of
June, 1H05, tho receipts were $558,032,
550, and tho expenditures $530,750,940,
leavhig uu available svrplus of $37,281,
080. It is estimated that the receipts for
the fiscal year ending tho 30th ot June,
1807, will he 374,001,380, and that the
excudkurcs will rach the sum of $319,
428,0 1 H, leaving in the 1 rersury a surplus
of $158,033,303. For the fiscal year en-
ling June 3()th. 1808, it is esti muted that
the reccijits will amount to $436,000,000,
and hat the expenditures will be $350,
2au,041 showing an excess ot $85,752,
350 iu favor of the Government. These
estimated receipts may Ihj diminished by
a reduction ot excise and import duties;
but after all necessary reductions shall
have been made, tho reveuuo of the pres
ent and the following years will doubtless
le sufficient to cover all legitimate
charges upon the Treasury, and leave a
large annual surplus to be applied to the
payment of the principal f tlio debt.
There nouns now to be no good reason
why taxes may not be reduced as the
country advances in population and
wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished
within the next quarter of aeiitury.
REPORT SECRETARY OF WAR.
The report of tho Secretary of War
furnishes valuable and important infor
mation in reference to the operations of
his department during the past year.
Few volunteers now remain in tho ser
vice, and they are being discharged as
rapidly as they can bo replaced by regu
lar troops. Tlie army lias been promptly
paid, f;irc,fully provided with medical
treatment, well sheltered and subsisted,
and is .to be furnilied y ith breech-loading
small arms. Tito military strength
of the nation has been unimpaired by the
discharge of volunteers, the disposition of
unserviceable or perishable stores, aud
the retrenchment of eijeuditure, iili
clent wnr material to meet any emergen
cy has been retained, nnd, from tho dis
banded volunteers standing rrady to re
spond to the national call, large nrmics
rnn- be rapidly organutcil, equipped, and
concentrated. Fortifications on the coast
and frontier have received, or arc being
irepared for more powerful armaments;
ake surveys mid harbor nnd river im
provements nre in course of energetic
prosectnn. ; l rfiorntiens nave wen
made for tho payticnt of tlio additional
liounties authorized during tho recent
session of Congress, under such regula
tions ns will protect the Uovernment
from fraud, and secure to tho honorably
dischnrgcdsoMicr the well-earned reward
of liis taithlulncss and gallantry. JUore
than sit thousand maimed soldiers have
received artificial limbs or other surgical
apparatus; forty-eight national cemete
ries, containing tho remains of 104,520
Union soldiers, havo already Ix-en cstals-
lisliedw Ihe total estimate ot military
appropriations is $25,2O5,G09.
REPORT OF SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.
It is stnted in tho report of the Secre
tary of the Navy that the naval force at
this time consists of two -hundred and
seventy-eight vessels, armed with two
thousand thrco hundred nnd fifty-one
guns. Of these one hundred and fifty
vessels, carrying one thousand and twen-
ty-ninc guns, nre in commission, rtisirio
uted chiefly among seven squadrons. Tho
number of men in the service is thirteen
thousand six. hundred. Great activity
and vigilance have been displayed bv afl
the squadrons, and their movements fiavo
been judiciously and efficiently arranged
in such a m inner as would best promote
American commerce, and protect the
rights and interests of our countrymen
abroad. The vessels unemployed arc un
dergoing repairs, or are laid up until
their services arc required. Most of the
iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the
vicinity of Philadelphia, a place which,
until decisive action should be taken by
Congress, was selected by tho Secretary
of the Jsavy as the most eligible location
for tlia-t class of vessels. It is important
that a suitablo public station should be
provided for the iron-clad fleet. It is in
tended that theso vessels shall bo in
proper condition for any emergency, and
it is desirable that the bill accepting
League Island for naval purposes, which
passed the IIouso of Representees at its
last session, should recive final action at
an early period, in order that there may
bo a suitable public station for this class
of vessels, as well as a navy yard of area
sufficient for the wants of the service, on
the Delaware river. The Naval Pension
fund amounts to $1 1,750,000, having been
increased $2,750,000 during the year.
The expenditures of the department for
the fiscal year ending 30lh June last were
$43,324,520, and tho estimates for the
coming year amount to $23,568,436.
Attention is invited to the condition of
our seamen, and the importance of legis
lative measures for their relief and im
provement. Tho suggestion on behalf
of this deserving class of - our fellow-citizens
are earnestly recommended to the
favorable attention of Congress.
REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.
Tho report of the Postmaster-General
presents a most satisfactory condition of
the postal service, and submits recom
mendations which deserve the considera
tion of Congress. . The revenues of the
Department for the year ending Juno 30,
1806, were $14,380,980, and tho expendi
tures $15,352,079, showing an excess of
tho hitter of $905,093. In anticipation
of this deficiency, however, a special ap-
i i,.. f r
propi union as mauu oy vuiigi csa in
the act approved July 28, 1800. Includ
ing the standing appropriation of
$700,000 for free mail matter, as a legiti
mate portiou ot the revenues yet remain
ing uuexpended, the actual deficiency lor
the past year is only $205,093 a sum
within $51,141 ot the amount estimated
in the annual report of 1804. The de
crease of revenue compared w ith tho pre
vious year was one and onc-hltli percent.,
and the increase of expenditures, owing
principally to tho enlargement of the
mail service in the South, was twelve
percent. On the 30th of June last there
were in operation six thousand nine hun
dred and thirty mail routes, with au ag
gregate length of one hundred and
eighty thousand nine hundred and twenty-one
miles, an aggregate annual trans-
Iiortatiou of seventy-one million eight
lundred aud thirty-seven thousand nine
hundred and fourteen miles, and an ag
gregate annuid cost, including all expen
ditures, of $8,410,184. The length of
railroad routes is thirty-two thousand
and ninety-two miles, and tho annual
transportation thirty million six huudrcd
and uine thousand four hundred and
sixty-seveu miles. The length of steam
boat routes is fourteen thousand three
hundred and forty-six miles, and the an
nual transportation three million four
hundred and eleven thousand cine hun
dred and sixty-two miles. The mail ser
vice is rapidly increasing throughout the
whole country, ,'ind its steady extension
in the Soutln-m States indicates their con
stantly improving condition. The grow
ing importance of the foreign service also
merits attention. The Postoflice Depart
ment ot ureal ijritam and our own have
agreed upon a preliminary basis foramw
Postal Convention, which, it is believed,
will prove eminently beneficial to the
commercial interests of tho L'uited
States, inasmuch as it contemplates a
reduction of the international letter post
age to one-half the existing rates; a re
fraction of postage with all other coun
tries to and from which correspondence
is transmitted in tlio British mail, or in
closed mails through the United King
dom ; tho establishment of uniform and
reasonable charges for tho sea and terri
torial transit of correspondence iu closed
mails; and an allowance to each Postofiioe
Department of the right to use all mail
communications established uuder tho
authority of tho other for tho dispatch
of correspondence, either iu open or
closed mails, on tho same terms as those
applicable to tho inhabitants of the
country providing the means tjf transmission.
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR'S REPORT.
jno itepori oi mo secretary ot tho
Interior exhibits tho condition -of those
branches of the public service which are
committed to his supervision. During
the last hscal year, lour million six hun
dred and wenl y-nuie thousand three
hundred nnd twelro ncres of public laud
were disposed of. one million eisrht hun
dred ami ninety-two thousand tive hun
dred and sixteen acres ot which were
entered under the homestead act; The
policy originally adopted relative to the
public lands has undergone essential
modifications. Immediate revenue, and
not their rupid settlement, was the cardi
nal feature ot our land system. Long ex
perience and earnest discussion have re
sulted 111 the conviction that the early
development of our Agricultural resourc
es, nnd the deffusion of an .energetic pop
ulation of our vast territory, are objects of
far greater importance to. the national
growth and prosperity tluvn me proceeds
of tho sale ot tho land to tho highest bid
der In 0H?n market. The homestead
enactments relieve tho settler from tho
1 payment of purchase money, and secure
kim a pcrmnncnt home, upon tho condi
tion ot residenoo for n term of years.
This, liberal policy invites emigration
from the old, nnd from tho more crowd
ed portions of the new world. Its pro
pitious results nro undoubted, and will
be moro signally manifested when time
shall have given to it ft wider develop
ment. Congress has mado liberal grants of
public land to corporations, in aid of the
construction oi rauroaus nn oincr in
ternal improvements. Should this policy
hereafter prevail, moro striugent pro
visions will be required to secure a faith
ful application of the fund. The title to
the lands should not pass, by patent or
otherwise, but remain in the Uovernment
nnd subject to its control until some
portion of tho mad has been actually
built. Portions of them might then, from
time to time bo conveyed to tho corpo
ration, but never in a greater ratio to tho
whole quantity embraced by the grant
than the completed parts bear to the en
tire length of the projected improvement.
This restriction would not operate to the
prejudice of any undertaking concerted
in good faith and executed with reason
able energy, ns it is the settled practico
to withdraw from market the lands falling
within the operation of such grants, and
thus to exclude the inception of a subse
quent adverse right. A breach of tho
conditions which Congress may deem
proper to impose should work a forfeiture
of claim to the lands so withdrawn but
unconvcyed, and of title to the lands con
veyed which remain unsold.
Operations on tho several lines of tho
Pacific Railroad have been prosecuted
with unexampled vigor and success.

PENSIONS.
Durintr the last fiscal venr tho nnimmt
paid to pensioners, including the expenses
ot disbursements, was thirteen million
four hundred and fifty-nine thousand nine
hundred ami ninety-six dollars; and fifty
thousand ono hundred and seventy-seven
names were added to tho pension rolls.
The entire number of pensioners, Juno 30,
I SCO, wag one hundred ami twenty-six thousand
seven hundred and twenty-two. "This fact fur
nishes melancholy nnd sinking proof of the
sticrihYes mnde to vindiciifc tho constitutional
authority of the Federal Government, nnd to
mtiintiiia inviolate, the integrity of th Union.
They impose upon us corresponding obligations.
It is estimated that thirty-three million dollars
will he required to meet tho exigencies of this
branch of the service during tho next fiscal

tiK'bl llmus.-uid seven huuilred and sixteen
patents for useful inventions nnd desiznn were

MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
As a subject upon which depends an imrnenso
amount of the production and commerce of the
country, I recommend to congress such legisla
tion ns may bo necessary fir Ihe preset vul ion of
the levees of the Misissippi river. It is a matter
of national importance Hint early steps should be
uiKon, not oniy to add to the efficiency of these
barriers against destructive inundations, but for
the removal of nil obstructions to tho freo and
safe navigation of that great channel of trade nud
commerce.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
. The District of Columbia, under cxls'.lng
laws, Is not cutitled to that representation in tho
x-..t :i
-.nimu.ii viruiieii muni, irora our earnest
history, has been uniformly accorded to each
Territory established from time to time withiu
oui limits. It maintnins necullar relnl.inn to
Congress, to whom Ihe Constitution hns granted
Ihe power of exercising legislation over the seat
of government Our fellow-citizens residing in
the District, whoso iuterests nre thus confided
to the special guardianship of Congress, exceed
in number the population of scrcralof our Terri
tories, and no Just reason is perceived why n
delegate of their choice rhould not be admitted
to u seat lu tno House of Representatives. No
mode seems so appropriate and effectual of en-
nhling them to make known their peculiar con
dition nnd wants, und of securing tho local
legislation adapted to them. I therefore re
commend ihe passage of n law authorising the
electors of tho District of Columbia to choose a
delegate to Do allowed tho samo rights nnd

OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
It is a subject of counralulalinn that no foreign
combinations against our domestic peace and
safety, or our legitimate hilhieuco nmong the

INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.
The entire success of the Atlantic Teleirrnnh
between the coust of Ireland and the Province
ot Newfoundland, Is no achievement which has
be;n Justly celebrated iu both hemispheres as

success will attend, nnd cvt-u greater results

The congratulations of Conirress to the Em
peror of Kussia, upon his escape from attempt
ed assination, have beea presented to that hu-
mauo sna enlightened ruler, and received by
him with expressions of grateful appreciation.
. Tlio Executive, warned of an attempt by
Spanish-American adventurers to Induce tho
emigration of freed men of the l'uited Btutes to
foreign country, protested sgaiust the project
as one which, it' couumiated, would reduce
the hi to a bondage even more oppressive than
that from which they have Just Wm relieved.
A sun ranee has been received from the Govern
ment of the Ht ate in w hich the plan was ma
tured, that the proceeding will meet neither its
lcncourttgciucnt nor approval. It is a qiu-stion
worthy of your consideration, whether our
laws upon this subject are adequate in the pre
vention or punishment of tho criuio thus
-meditated.
THE MEXICAN QUESTION.
In bo month of April last, as Congress is
aware, a friendly arrangement was made be
tween the Emperor of the French and the Pre
sident of the l'uited Htales for IIia withdrawal
from Mexico of the French expeditionary uiiU-
force. Th withdrawal tn tn 1 noiln
ires delarfcrm-ntsi tho first of w hich. It
iiTKiemmni, wouki learn- Mexico ill Aovcmhrr,
now past, tlie second Ira Marrli next, nnd the
third and last In Novrmbrr, ISH7. Immcdinto
ly upon th completion of tlio evacuation, the
tho French Government was to assume tho
siuno attitude of non-intervention, In regard to
Mexico, ns is held by the Government of tlio
United Ktntcd. Repealed assurance linvo been
given by tho- Emperor, slnro that agreement,
that he would complete tlio promised evacua
tion within the-period mentioned, or sooner.
It was reasonably expected that the proceed
ings thus contemnlated would produce a crisis
of great political interest in tho Kcpublic of
Mexico. The newly appointed Ministrr of the
United States, Mr. Campbell, was thereforo
ent forward, on tho Oth day of November lust,
to assume his procr functions an .Minister
Plenipotentiary of the United State to that Re
public. It was also thought expedient that ho
should lie attended in tho vicinity of Mexico by
tho Lieutenant-General of the Army of the
United Stntes with the view of Obtaining such
mformntion as might be Important to determine
the conrso to be pursued by tho United States
In ro-estabiisiiing ana niHintainuig necessary
and proper Intercourse with the Itepiiblic of
Mexico. Deeply interested In the cause of lib
erty nnd humanity, It see mod nn obvious duty
rm our part to cxerciso wnaicrer inuuenco wc
possessed for the restoration hnd permanent
establishment In that country of a domestic nnd
republican form of government.
Such was the condition of affairs In regard to
Mexico, when, on the L'2d day of Novemltcr
last, official information was received frntn
Paris Hint the Emperor of Franco had some
time before decided not to withdraw a detach
ment of his forces In the month of Novomlier
list. according to engagement, but that this
decision was mndn with tho purpose of with
drawing tho whole of these forces in the ensu
ing spring. Of this determination, however,
the United States hnd not received any notice
or Intimation; and, so soon as the information
was received by the Government, caro was
taken to make known its dissent to the Empe
ror of France.
I cannot forego tho hone that France will
reconsider the suhject, and adopt some resolu
tion In regard to tho evacuation of Mexico
which will conform as nearly as practicable
with the existing engagement, nnd thus meet
the just expectations of the United States.
The papers relating to tlio subject win be laid
before you. It is believed that, with the evacua
tion of Mexico by the expeditionary forces, no
subject for serious differences between France
and the United Stotes would remain. The ex
pressions of the Emperor nnd people of Franco
warrant a hope that tho traditionary friendship
between the two countries might in that case
be renewed and jiermanently restored.
A claim of a citizen of the United States for
indemnity for spoliations committed on the
highiccas by the French authorities, in the ex
ercise of a belligerent power agninst Mexico,
has been met by the Government of France
with a proposition to defer settlement until a
mutual convention for tho adjustment of all
claims of citicii3 nnd subjects of both coun
tries, arising out of the recent wars on this
continent, slian bo agreed upon by tho two
countries. The suggestion is not deemed un
reasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct
the manner in which claims for indemnity by
foreigners, as well as by citizens of the United
States, arising out of the date civil war, shall
be adjudicated and determined. I have no
doubt that the subject of nil such claims will
engage your attention nt a convenient nud
proper time.

GREAT BRITAIN.
It Is a matter of regret that no considerable
ndvnnre has been made towards nn adjustment
of the differences between the United States
and Groat Britain, arising out of tlio depreda
tions upon our national commerce and other tres
passes committed during our civil war by Brit
ish subjects, in violation of international law
and treaty obligations. The delay, however,
may bo believed to havo resulted in no small
degree from tho domed ie situation of Great
Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred
in that country during the last scssio'n of Par
liament. The attention of the new ministry
was called to the subject at en caily day, and
there is some reason to expect that it will now
bo considered in a becoming and friendly spirit.
The importance of an early disositioti of tlio
question cannot be exaggerated. Whatever
might bo tho wishes'of the two Governments,
it is innntfest that good-will and friendship bo-
tween tho two countries cannot bo established
until a reciprocity, in tlm practice of good
faith nml neutrality, shall be restored between
the respective nations.
THE FENIAN INVASION OF CANADA.
On the fith of June last, in violation of our
neutrality laws, a military enterprise against
the British North American Colonies was pro
jected and attempted to be carried on within
the territory ana Jurisdictions ot the tinted
Slates. In obedience to the obligation imposed
upon the Executive by the Constitution to see
thnt the laws are faithfully executed, all citi
zens were warned, by proclamation, against
taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceed
ings and tho proper civil, military, and naval
officers were directed to take all nocetssrv meas
ures for the enforcement of the laws. The ex
pedition failed, but it has not been without its
painful consequences. Some of our citizens
who, it was alleged, were engaged in tho expe
dition, were captured and havo boeu brought
to trial, ns for a capital offense, in the Province
of Canada. Judgment and sentenco of death
have been pronounced against some, while oth
ers have boon acquitted. Fully believing in
the maxim of government, that severity of civil
punishment for misguided persons who have
engaged in revolutionary attempts which have
disastrously failed, Is unsound and unwise, such
representations havo been made to the British
Government, in behulfof the convicted persons,
as, being sustained by an enlightened nml hu
mane judgment, will, it is hoped, Induco in their
cases an exercise ot clemency, nud a judicious
amnesty to all who were engaged In tho move
ment. Counsel has been employed by the Gov
ernment to defend citizens of the United States
on trial for capital offences In Canada ; nnd a
discontinuance of tlio prosecutions which wero
instituted in tho courts of tho United States
against those who took part In tho expedition,
lias been directed.
I have regarded Hie expedition as not only
political In its nature, but as also in a great nioa
suro foreign from the United States 4n causes;
character and objects. The attempt was un
derstood to be made in sympathy with nn in-
Hlirirpnt rifll-tv in Trr-luml nml Ii.. ati-II.-:.... ...
British Province on this Continent, was design
ed to aid in obtaining redress for political griev
ances which, it was assumed, tho people of Ire-
laixi una sunerea at tho lianas ot tho British
Government during a period of several centu
ries. The persons engaged In it wero chielly
natives of that country, some of whom had,
while others had not, bccoino citizens of tho
United States under our general laws of natu
ralization. Complaints of , inisgovernnient in
Ireland continually engage the attention of the
British nation, anil so great an agitation is now
prevailing in Ireland that tho Jhitibh Uovern
ment have deemed it necessary to suspend tlio
writ of haters eorpu lu that country. Theso
circumstances must necessarily modity the opin
ion which wo might otherwise havo entertained
in regard to an expedition expressly prohibited
by our neutrality laws. So long us thoso Jaws
remain upon our statute-books they should be
faithfully executed, und If they operate harsh
ly, unjustly, or oppressively, Congress alone
can apply the remedy, by their modification or
repeal.
THE EASTERN QUESTION.
Political and commercial Interests of the Uni
ted States are not unlikely to bo affected In
some degree by events which aro transpiring
in tlio eastern regions of Eurojie, and the time
seems to have coiuo when our Uovernnent
ought to havo a proper diplomatic representa
tion In Greece.
NATURALIZATION.
The Government has claimed for all pis-sons
not convicted, or accused, or suspected of crime,
an absoluto political right of self expatriation,
and a choice of new national allegiance. Most
of the European States have dissented from
this principle, and have claimed a right to huld
such of their subjects as have immigrated to and
been naturalized In the United States, and af
terwards returned on transient visits to their
native countries, to the performuuee of military
service In like manner as resident subjects.
Complaints arising from tho claim in this res
pect uiadu by foreign btatos, havo hentofore
been matters of controversy but wteu tho Uni
ted States and some of tb European Powers,
and the Irritation consequent upon the fuilure
to settle this question increased during the war
In which PiUHnia, Ituly and Austria wero re
cently engaged. While Great Britain has nev
er acknowledged the right of expatriation, she
has uot, for some years past, practically lnslst
d upou tho -opposite doctrine. Franco titt
re., cqusiiy ror .rarln , and Prussia lis pro
Posed a lrot"le, which, ahhongl evlnelnir
ncresscd liberality hn not been .JccpTed by
the United States. Peace Isnow prevailing ?.
