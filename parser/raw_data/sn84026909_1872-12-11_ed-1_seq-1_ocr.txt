HARVEST HOME.
All sa114V gathered in
Is Autumn's golden grain;
Row sweet to hear the ringing cheer
That greets the last full wain
We may not even call
An ear of whent our own,
But where's the heart t,.at takes no part
In bailing Harvest Home.
Then let thanksgiving songs
Be o'er the country spread,
To Him to whom the praise belongs
For sending daily bread.
For He whose gracious eye
Has slumbered not nor slept,
Again has sent a rich supply,
And twell His promise kept.
So let thanksgiving songs
Both far and wide be spread,
To Him to whom the praise beloz,gs
For sending daily bread.

THE DEVIL'S FOOTPRINTS.
-:o:
BY J. A. JOHNSTONE.
Yes, this is a queer old house,
and there is a story connected
with it, which, perhaps, you would
like to hear. It is a bitter night,
so draw your chair near this crack
ling wood fire, and don't start so
every time old Boreas whistles
through the hall, or sends his imps
to beat tattoo on the window
patnes. Now you look comfortable,
I will begin.
An old gentleman and his two
grand-solls once lived here. sole
survivors of a numerous family.
One was the son of the old mai's
eldest boy. and the other of his
only dauhter. When they were
quite young, they were bright,
handsome lads, and seemed to well
merit the loving pride, with which
their grandflath"er regardted them.
The eldest who was ten years
of age and but six months older
than his cousin. betrayed the
Spanish blood which he derived
from his mother in his clear olive
skin, and dark curling locks ;
w hile the ruddy cheeks, frank blue
eyes. and finely eut lips of the
younger equally denoted the pure
Saxon dles:-eint.
As time passed on, the grandlfa
t her became uneasy at observing
the domineering spir'it of Maurice
the elder, over his cousin William;
and as the latter had no idea of
tamely submitting to imp)osition,
altercations arose, which seriously
alarmed the old gentleman, as he
was anxious to foster a close anti
enduring affection between them.
Hattempted tmaethem
share everything in common, and
as the school they attended was
some distance from home, he gave
them a pony which one was to
ride a certain part of the way and
thent fatsten to a tree for the other's
benefit. IIe soon found, however,
that when Maurice started first, it
was all ride, and no tie with him.
Thus it was in all things. The
selfishness of Maurice seemed to
grow with his growth, and as the
determination of William was con
stantly opposing it, they became
more and more estranged from
each ot her. The grandfather could
riot help approving many times of
the conduct of Wilham while at
the same time he was compelled
to gravely censure Maurice. This
caused a fierce jealousy to take
possession of the latter, which
planted the seeds of a hatred which
after wards sprung up and bore bit.
ter fruit.
The cousins now sought comn
panions to suit their different
tastes. Ma:urice would often be
Sseen on the wharf watching t.he
incoming or outgoing of sonme ship
or else listening to some wonder
I ul sea yarn told by a garrulous
sailor, till he thought it would be
a fine thing to run a way arid push
his own fortune, with no cousin in
the way for a stumbling block. It
follows, of course, that one morn
ing he was missing.
N~o trace of the misguided boy
was discovered up to the death of
the grandfather, who, indignant
at the ungrateful behavior of Mau
rice, left the whole of his estate to
William. The will was opened in
a this very room by the family at.
torney. As he was proceeding to
read it,befo're the assembled friends
and vouthful mourner, a footstep
was~beard in the hall, the door
openIed, and Maurice with sun.
burnt face, and sailor clothing,
stood before them. William start
ed forward to receive him; but
with a cold gesture t he other waved
him back, and motioned the law
ver~ to proceed. As soon ais the~
y 2-outents of the will were known,
a dark frown settled itself upon;
the face of Maurice.
William noticed this, and step
ping to his side, laid his hand on
his shoulder, saying: "Cousin, dc
not think I1 would defraud you o
your rights, In our childhood
we wer~e taught to share alike
and thus it shall be now. In
few days we can arrange every
le thing to our mutual satisfaction
be- We are children no longer ; let ut
Worf ,'ta -t a snch. Will you not be
tily away, muttering something
ab)ut- his cousin "always making
fine speeches when he thought
any one was round to hear them."
William looked hurt.; his face,
flushed, and he seemed ready to
retort ; but with an effort restrain
ed himseif An awkward pause
ensued, and then one by one, the
friends took their departure, and
the cousins were left alone. What
passed between them was never
known ; but it was understood
that some E-ind of a reconeliation
had been effected. They went in
to society together, where Maurice
when he ch-se, made himseit'quite
brilliant. The demon jealousy,
however, was but sleeping. Once
in a while, one might see it flash
ing from his eyes, as he saw that
his cousin was more trusted and
loved than himself.
At 'Jength William brought. a
fitir-haired bride to his home. -
-Never did the house seem so full
of sunshine before. Everything
that was staid and ugly was meta
morphosed beneath her touch;
and it was a delight, to hear her
merry laughter, or sweet singing,
as she passed through the rooms.
Maurice who had ever regarded
woman as a sort of useless crea
tion, betran to notice the uiusual
brightne.ss around him, and in re
lecting on the cause, turned his
eves on his cousin's .vife. Ali
why is it, that some unseen pow.
er seems ever to encourage the
evil within us, impelling us on to
our fate ? Why could not Ma
Iice perceive that it was to the
magical touch of womankind in
general we owe that enjoyment of
cuntort and refinenieni, which
surrounds us, and riot to one in
parti;ular?
Every day bright glances were
thrown upon him from those more
brilliant than she,who unconscious
ly opened his eyes to the value of
woman. To him they wereas no
thingin comparisvn. He felt him
self drawn more and more towards
her. She was to hini like a new
volime, whose every page reveals
some unexpected novelties.
In proportion a his love gained
strength, the jealousy of his cous
in reused itself within him: but
this time it was hand in hand with
deceit. He dared not show his
feelings, for to quarrel with Wil
liam would be to banish himself
from her who had become neces
sory to his life aid happiness.
fHe would sit in his room, often,
picturing to himself' what life
might be to him if his cousin did
not exist. To her , ho was the
object, of his unholy passion, he
dared not breathe a word of his
thoughts, for she was purity itself.
and would have scorrie1 him as ho
deserved.
The young couple occupied the
room over this, opposite which is
a covered stairway, outside the
hiouse, leading directly to the garn
dlen. Maurice had the back room,
and as he sat there one winter
night something like this, when
demons seemn to laugh and shriek
round the house, in a fit of pas
sion, he vowed he wvould sell his
soul to the devil. it' he could rid
himself of his now hated cousin.
His words seemed to be caught
up by a mysterious voice, but he
laughed and shook off the fancy.
Somnetia e after this, William's
wife expressed a desire to visit her
mother who lived a considerable
distance fr'om the city. William
wvas quite willing she should do so
as theire wvas trouble about some
pr'oper'ty belonging to. him, in
what was then the lar west, which
needed his presence, and might
take as long as three months.
When Maur-ice heard of this, be
tossed all night on his pillow, at
the thought of the separation.
At last he started up wildly, lean
ed his head on his hand, an.d thus
remained until the gray light of'
morning stole in upon him.
At breakfast he laughingly said,
"they seemed bent on forcing him
to keep bachelor's quarters ; but
hat he was going to rebel, and
would go to Europe instead."
-'Don't let your roving spir'it catch
you again," said William. "'I
think it has ; but 1 shall chargo
you both with the cause, for I
should .not have thought of it if
you had not spoken of going away
The conversation di'opped, after
some talk of the preparations no
eessary. Mauirice suggested the
propriety of' discharging the ser'
vants and closing the house, as it
was impossible f'or him to tell how
long William might be obligod to
remaimn out west. William ap
proved~ of this, and so the matter
wats settled.
The vessel Maurice engaged pas.
sag"e in, would sail two days bef'ore
W ilim lef't for the West. WiI
Iiamn was' to take his wife to her
mother's, and leaving her there,
would i'each home at ten the next
night, wh ere lie proposed to sleep,
and start fresh again the next
morning.
Both Willham and his wife saw
iMaurice off. The ship moved
p)roudly from the whar-f, as if sen.
sible of the cheering of'the thronge
.az.ine aifter her. F'riends strin,
ed their eyes, and waved their 1
handherchiefs till the vessel di- 1
appeared from view ; then they
separated, each going his appoint
ed way.
Maurice watched the movenen tS
of the pilot, and when his boat i
came alongside to take him ashore,
he quietly stepped into it, as a Ie
turning friend of one of' the pa
seng~ers.
The wharf was deserted when
they reached it, but Maurice fold
ed a large cloak about him and
drew his cap over his eyes lest lie
should meet some acquaintance.
He then made his way to a notl
where he was unknown, and wait
ed there until night-fall ; under
cover of which, he returned home
letting himself in with a duplicate
key.
All was cheerless and deserted.
After seeing that everything had
been left secure, he retired to rest;
but in William's room instead of
his own.
The next day he busied himself. 1
collecting a number of brieks to-'
guther, and inixinga certain quan- I
tity of mortar, which he carried 1
into a room called the buttery. I
This room had a brick flooring I
with the exception of a square
place in the centre consisting of
wooden planks, covering the open- 1
ing to a long disused dry well.
As these boards were a stein lower I
than the surrounding floor, Wil- 1
liam's wife had often expressed a
desire to have it filled up even
with brieks. in order to make the
room more convenient for use.
William had neglected doing this,
and now Ilaurice proceeded to
take up the boards and examine
the well. le found it to be about
fifteen feet in depth with solid ia- i
Korilly all around.
He remembered his grandfiither I
saying it had been used for the
pu11rpose of preserin g winl ter storeCs]
of perish->le artiices. A ier ex- 1
aminii tbe well,to his satisftct ion,
instead of proceeding with his
work. lie left it as it w%as. and
busied himself with other matters
till night again closed in, and with
it a witches' revel seemed to be
inaugurated ; for the wind howled
round the house, and the rain beat
against the window shutters as if
it would burst them in.
Maurice now lighted a fire in
this very room in which we are
sitting ; he had not lone so before,
lest the neighbors should observe 1
the the smoke risimg from the
chimney. He let the heavy cur
taiis fal befbre the windows, for
fear a ray of light should be seen
from without. He then placed a
light on a stand which lie drew i
near the fire, and also rolled for
ward a lounge.
Then he went to the sideboard
and filling a decanter with wine,
brough t it with glasses, and placed
them on the table. Just here he
seemed to be overcome for the
first time wit.h some inward em o
tion. Leaning his arms on the
man tle with his head resting up-I
on them, he stood gazing a long
time into the fiire. At length he
rousedl himself with ani impaftient
exclamation, and filling a glass
with wine draiik it off at once.
Taking up the other glass lie.
poured into it a snmall portion of a
colorless fluid from a vial which i
he 1eplaced in his pocket. Next|
he lighted a (igar and with a book
in his hand threw himself on the
sofa with his face towards the
dooir. All was silence now save
the crackling of' the fire, and
steady pouiring of the rain.
Time seemed an eternity to
that gloomy watcher, whose ev
ery action up to this time, had
been as coolly performed as if on
ly of' every (lay importance. NOW,
however, when all wvas .prepared.
and lie but awaited his victim,
Nature would have her sway ; and
the battle between right or wrong
Igoing on within him, showed it
sel f in the clammy moisture of his
brow, and alternately quiverin
and coinpressed lips. You will
soon: see which spirit gained the
victory. C
N%ot long after ten o'clock, a
key tuirned in the lock of' the out
sideoor f'ootsteps moved along
the hall, the door of this room
opened, and William enteired. HIe
started as if' he saw a ghost he.

did he not believe his cousin to be
tar away on the broad Atlantic?
Maurice broke idhe silence.
"You are startled, no wonder ;
but you nieed not tremble any
longer for I1 am flesh and blood.
You see our vessel sprung a leak
Ijust as we got outside, and as the
car'peniter could not find ik we were
obliged to put back inito por't. As
no other ship was in i'eadiness to
sail. I returned home.'
William endeavored to recover
himiuelf arid greet his cousi.1 pleas
antly, but his fright had almost
unnianned him. "Pour yourself
a glass of wine," said Maurice,
pushing towards him the decan-;
ter, at the same time taking up:
his own glass, which he bad pre-,
Iviously filled. William did so,
drank it to the last drop. and then
seatedlhihself by the fire'
,hanked his cousin For the warm
-eception he had given him. but
aid, "why did you not open tihe

IaUrice replied that lie wishe-d to
;urprise him and did not think of

Soon William exclaimed that
ie had never felt so sleepy before
n his life ; Maurice said it was I

im to lie down oi the lounge for

MARRIA6 E AND CELIBACY.
Those dry but useful peoph who
delight in statistics have been in
vestigating the effect of imiarriag
and Celibacy on mortality. They
have demonstrated to their satis
faction the beneficial effect of
marriage upon longevity. The
last person who has devoted his
attention to this subject is M.
l3ertillon. His statistics cover!
the States of France, Holland and
Belgium. According to M. Ber
tillon. between the ages of 20 and
35, out of 1.000 married men
there are 6 deaths; and out of~
1.000 bachelors 10 deaths, and
out of' 1,000 widowers 22 deaths.
Between 30 ansd 35 the deaths in
the san 3 number are: Married
men 7, bachelors 11, and widowers
17. Between 35 and 40 years of'
age the mortality per 1.000 is:
Married men 1. bachelors 13, and
widowers 17. Continuing these
calculations through different se
ries ofycars, the advantage are on
the side of the married men.

ifhe Greenville and Colu-.lbia Railroad,
u-der the act and deci,ions upon the
'act, is a corporati.n subject to the pro
Visi'llis of the bankrupt act.
As t > the thi:d que.stion, I ha)ld that
the intere-t conpons severed from the
b,nds are commercial paper, and if the
Lireenvi'le Railrad were "a banker,
broker, merchant, trader, manufacturer
ar i;nor," the ron-payment of its cou
pons for fourteen days would be an act
of bankruptcy; but as i does not (in -
my opi. ion) fall within any one of these
classe.s, the .penalty for such stoppage
adoes notL a'tach.
As to the fourth ques-tion, (acting in
stead of ajury,) I have not been able to
finda the inasolvency of the company, or
decide that it i- insolvent.
As to the fifth and sixth questions,
not having found the Greenaille and
Columbia Railroad insolvent, it is tun
n:cessary- that I should decide thema.

fever and ague.- Tne convention

observed the parson as he season

thus:

"Certainly," return ed the pa

'The Hoosier took tihe proffered
phlial and feeling himself proof
against any quantity of raw wbis
key, thought that he could stand
the "red salt" with impunity, and
accorditngly sprinkled a junk of

anid forthwith introduced it into
his capacious mouth.
It soon began to take hold. He
