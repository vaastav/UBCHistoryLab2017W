At Bismarck general satisfaction
seems to prevail over the dismissal of
the oasea of the state against Wm. Do

ele which ia the cause of all the trouble
was published in the Bismarck Settler

Dolan and MoHugh, who published tbe
article in the paper they publiabed.
When the oaae came to trial last winter
change of venue was taken to the Mor­

by the state's attorney to dismisa the

WASHINGTON, Dec.
14.—Major General
Brooke arrived in Washington from
Fortress Monroe early in the day, and
was closeted for more than an hour in
consultation with Secretary Alger. He
then, in company with Adjutant Gen­
eral Corbin, proceeded to the White
House, and when he returned to the
war department it was formally an­
nounced that the president had desig­
nated him to be military governor of the
island of Cuba, anew post which car­
ries with it all the control over the mil­
itary and civil branches of the island
formerly exercised by the captain gen­
eral under the Spanish regime.
Each of the six provinces of Cuba will
have its own military gauernor, just as
General Wood is now military governor
of the province of Santiago, but all of
these will receive their instructions
directly from Major General Brooke,
who is the supreme authority of the
island. Thus in Havana, General Lud­
low will be governor of the city, bnt
answerable to General Lee, governor of
the province of Havana, who in turn
will be answerable to Major General
Brooke, the governor of the island.
A BOUSING WELCOME.
American Troop* Amued at the Feeling
Shown by Cubans at Havana.
HAVANA, Dec. 14.—The First North
Carolina regiment, which arrived here
Sunday on the United States transport
Roumanian, disembarked during the
morning and marched through the city,
with band and colors, to camp at
Marianao. By the time the regiment
had reached the suburb of Cerro many
hundreds of men, women and children
were following, all showing deep emo­
tion, the men embracing one another,
the women weeping from excessive joy
and the children shouting endearing
names as the North Carolinans marched
through. The troops were amazed at
the feeling displayed. Several hundred
Cubans followed the regiment all the
way to Marianao, a distance of four
miles.
The Two Hundred and Second New
York also marched through the city
to the railway station. The route,
which was a mile and a half long, was
the most direct course from the landing
place to the station and did not pass
through the principal streets. There
was only the ordinary number of people
on the streets and it was only occasion­
ally that cries of "Vive Espanol," "Vive
Americanos," or "Vive Cuba Libre"
were heard. The onlookers were only
curious at seeing the American visitors.
Tbe troops are bound for Pinar del Rio
province.
GENERAL LUDLOW NAMED.
Designated Flnt Military Governor ol
Havana City.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. Secretary
Alger has designated General Ludlow
to act as first military governor of Ha­
vana city with fall powers to deal with
all local questions. He will leave for
his post shortly. General Greene, at
Havana, will remain there until re­
main there until relieved by General
Ludlow and then come home to be re­
tired.
DOSS FILE A PROTEST.
Take Esceptlon to Certain Action* of the
American Commiuioo.
MADRID, Dec. 13.—The government
entirely approves the memorandum of
the protest against the action of the
United States commissioners filed by
Senor Montero Rios at Paris.
The memorandum protests against the
refusal of the Americans to surrender
the securities deposited in the treasury
of Cuba and Porto Rico by private
Spaniards remarking that "never has a
civilized nation committed such an act
of violence."
Secondly, it protests against the ulti­
matum demanding the Philippines.
Thirdly, it protests against the posi­
tion in which those Spaniards are placed
who desire to remain in Cuba.
Fourthly, it protests against the ref­
erence to the destruction of the Maine in
President McKinley's message to the
United States congress. On this point
the memorandum says:
"Spain has proposed arbitration, but
the United States refuses to give her the
right which is given to a criminal—
namely the right of defending herself.
The Spanish commissioners leave the
care of fixing the responsibility of the
explosion to the whole world which will
say whether those are responsible who
desire the truth or those refusing to
seek it."
IOWA'S CROPS.
Total Talnation For the Tear Not Lei)
Than **25,OOO.OOO.
DES MOINES, Ia., Dec. 13.—The ag­
gregate values of the soil products of
Iowa for this year are not less than
$225,000,000. says Director Sage of the
Iowa Weather and Crop service in hia
annual report. Corn yielded 289,214,
850: averaging 34.5 per acre. In many
counties the yield is far above previouj
estimates. About 10 per cent was un­
merchantable. The total yield of spring
wheat is 10.152.352 bushels, wintei
wheat 3,16S.916 bushels, oats 139,915,340.
Commission Banquet* Porter.
PARIS, Dec. 14.—The United States
peace commissioners gave a banquet
during the evening at the Hotel Conti­
nental to the United States ambassador.
The company toasted President McKin
ley, Ambassador Porter and the United
States peace commissioners.
Remains of the Cuban General and
Patriot to Be Taken Home
on a Warship,
Which This Government Will
Place at the Disposal of the
Cnbans.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.—The funeral
of General Garcia, Cuban commander,
will be held at 10 o'clock at St. Patricks
church in this city. The body will be
placed in a metallic casket and depos­
ited in a vault at Arlington pending its
removal to Cuba. Date of removal hat
not yet been fixed, but this government
will place a warship at the disposal of
the Cubans for this purpose. This ar­
rangement is said to be in accordance
with the wishes of General Garcia's
family and his comrades in arms.
The Dolphin will probably be desig­
nated by the navy as the vessel to carry
the remains of General Garcia to Cnba.
She is now lying at the Washington
navy yards in command of Captain
Lyon and having been fitted for accom­
modation of the president she is well
suited for service of this character.
DEATH OF GENERAL GARCIA.
Hi* Laat Thoughts Were of the Country
He Had So Long Fought For.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.—General Calix
to Garcia, the distinguished Cuban war­
rior and veteran and head of the com­
mission elected by the Cuban assembly
to visit this country, died here shortly
after 10 a. m. at the Hotel Raleigh,
where the commission has its headquar­
ters. The sudden change from the warm
climate of Cnba, with the hardships he
had there endured to the wintry weather
of New York and Washington, is re­
sponsible for the pneumonia which re­
sulted in his demise. He contracted a
slight cold in New York, which did not
assume an alarming stage until the early
part of last week. On Tuesday night
General Garcia, in company with the
other members of the commission, at­
tended a dinner given in hiB honor by
General Miles, and it was a result of the
exposure that night which culminated
in his death. During the 12 hours or
more preceding his dissolution General
Garcia was
Unconscious Moat of the Time.
At intervals he recognized one or more
of those about him. In his dying mo­
ments as all through his busy and ac­
tive life his thoughts were for his be­
loved country and its people and
amongst his last words were irrational
murmurings in which he gave orders to
his officers on his staff for the battle
which he supposed was to occur and in
which he understood there were only
400 Spaniards to combat. Several
members of the commission and Mr.
Rubens, their counsel in this country,
were in the bed chamber when the end
came. The remains were immediately
prepared for burial and were placed on
a bier in the room in which he died.
By direction of Major General Milesa
detachment of soldiers from Battery E,
Sixth artillery, was detailed as a body
guard for the remains. General Garcia
left a large family, only one of whom,
Justo, a captain on his staff, was with
him when he died.
It Honored in Death.
After General Garcia's death steps
were taken to notify the government
officials here and also the executive com­
mittee of the Cuban assembly, which
has its headquarters at Marianao, Cnba.
Secretary Jose Villalon, of the commis­
sion, sent a telegram to Mendes Capote,
the president of the Cuban assembly,
who is now in Havana. As soon as the
death became known a number of visit­
ors, including many public men, came
to the hotel to express their condolences.
President McKinley manifested his sym­
pathy by sending a suitably worded let­
ter, and Vice President Hobart sent his
card. Among those who called were
Senators Foraker, Money, Proctor and
Chandler and Generals Lawton and
Wheeler.
GAVE HIS LIFE FOR CUBA.
General Garcia Spent Much of Hi* Time
Fighting for Cuban Liberty.
General Garcia, whose name will be
ever linked with those of old patriots
who have fought against unequal odds
for the freedom of his country, has had
a most active and varied life, much of
which has been spent in fighting for the
cause or Cuban liberty which he had the
satisfaction of seeing accomplished so
short a time before his death.
He was a man of culture and refine­
ment, of splendid education and came
from a distinguished family of Jiguand,
•f Santiago de Cuba province. He was
born in Cogquin, Oct. 14, 1839, and was
therefore in the 60th year of his age.
General Garcia was educated in Havana
and in Spain. In 1664 he was married
to Isabel Veles. General Garcia was
the original conspirator in the uprising
of the Cubans against Spain in 1868, and
in that war, under Gomez, he attained
the rank of a brigadier general. In 1875
he attempted another revolution but was
unsuccessful and was banished to Spain
in 1880, where he remained until 1805,
when he escaped and returned to Cnba.
His active participation in the last rev­
olution is familiar to all newspaper
readers.

WASHINGTON. Dec. IB.—Consul Mon
aghan in a report to the state depart­
ment notes the progress of a formidable
movement among the German manu­
facturers to combine against the Amer
can iron and steel manufacturers. They
have become much alarmed at the de­
velopment of American capacity to com
pete with them in their own German
markets. The movement is conducted
very quietly to avoid disturbing pnblic
confidence and injuring themselves, but
for that reason is the more formidable.
The consul also contributes an inter­

BARBAROUS FILIPINOS.
Shocking Treatment of Friar* Who Have
Been Captured.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 14.—The Manila
correspondent of the Hong Kong Press
gives details of the shocking treatment
of friars and other prisoners captured
by insurgents in the Northern part of
the island of Luzon. General Leybe,
who was sent by Aguinaldo to attack
the cities in the extreme north of Luzon,
sent a report to his chief that he had
brought the entire section raided com*
pletely under the control of the Fili­
pinos. Leybe also mentions in his re­
port the capture of 124 friars and lay
brothers. From many Spanish sources
come reports of terrible actrocities com­
mitted by rebels, who are said to have
looted the churches in the towns of
Caigayaa and Apairi.
