act. lie baa been at wort on this speech for a
long time. The fact that he would come out for
repudiation got raised abroad, and many friends
ined to prevail epon him to destroy his pile of
manuscript. lie was not to be persuaded, and
the House gave him an hoar in which
to read It. There wxs a perceptible

the exclusion of yersoas ineligible under me Four
teenth Afnentriievt, and permitting no dDUnc

Mr. MORTON'S amendment wav read, requiring
ifal the Legislature shall lx provoiuua! until
lifter it has rat fled the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Atuet-dments, and the state la represented m
congress, acd it provides penalties for the exer
tlreof office bv ineligible persons.
Mr. CARPENTER thought tne amendment no-
Dfceerary acd pernicious. It mlgttt give m the
Southern people a good reason to cay that while
m a condition of <iure*s the terms of their ad
mission were dictated by congress. He did not
want future a Jeff. Darts to bring in abU of ex
ception* and move for a new trial
Mr. DRAKE said the rebels of the South should
be made to feel Dy Congress that the infamy of
that Georgia Legislature should be wiped out by
an act of retribution, and that the loyal men of
thfl bute should be heard and abocla be repre
sented. It mast be understood that there ts a
Cccgreia of the utuon that wields the sovereignly
of the nation, and whose {tower could no: be

Mr. MORTON said the original bill required the

TRCMRULL’S JUDICTARV HILL.
Upon the cxplranou of me marnrag hour, the
uiiCLi*bcd bonnes*, being the bi l io regulate the
appellate Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Was
taken up.
Mr. lUUMBMLL raid he folly recognized the
nocesiliy for a division of the powers of me
government, believing ihe concentration of all
power m the bauds cf the few tended toward
respotism, and that the liberties of the people
could culy lx permanently maintained by the
fnilctt regard fur the ngnts acd powers or the
General Government and of tne b’atcs. While
vlcldlrgnlt Just respect to the Judiciary, hta ob
ject was elmply to define by thlsbill the powera of
that department, and this definition would
not exceed by one step the limit which
tr.c Nupieme coon had already laid down.
The bin had not been framed with any view of
intern ring with any question now pending, but
to take from the Court a jurisdiction which U now
calmed to posset*. In support of the position
that the Ccurt bad no jurisdiction over political
question*, tne language of the Sapremo Court,
in various decision*, furnished evidence. In the
coarse ot a lengthy orgameol, be contended that
npon questions involving a conflict between a
State and the cons tltniion it was the duty of me
Coart to define me meaning of me sovereign
authority, which wra me constitution. Toe
Court bad never claimed antnomv «to
decide political questions, as was shown by the
language of me Court itself lu various decLuons.
It hart repeatedly conceded to Congress the an
thoitty vested therein by the coh*:*tuuou Io de
cide what government was me established one In
a state. The Idea appeared to have gained ere
detce that the object or the blit wo* to overthrow
tic Dgiianl powers of the Judiciary, acd rats he
(riiphaiically dented, in conclusion, Mr. rtum
lull suurumed au amendment rcxtrlcttog the
powers or the Justtecaor the Supreme Court m
issuing writ* of hab*t* cnrj.us to the cases of per
sons within their respective districts.
Mr. THAYER moved to again take up the Geor
gia bill.
Mr. TRUMBULL said it was essential to have
prompt action upon the pending bill, inasmuch as
ttlons were being male to bring t>*forc the Su
preme Court questions which might ferthtreom-
I hcate the status nf the Ucorgm question and
olinllar pollUi al action.
Mr. DRAKE said the statement of the Senator
(rum H’lLois was usothtr evidence that there sat
to another room of tuc Capitol a tribunal winch
was ?o tx arp» aicd to as tn«* superior Congress of
the United S'aioa. lie wanted the American peo
ple to know that fact.
THE CTORGU PILL AGAIN TAKEN CP,
Tic Georgia m:i wus then t*keii up.
>Jr. CAIH’LNTKU said he would never rote to
admit the State until she had adopted the pro
posed amendments; but be cuuia not see the
ftenefit to accrue from an announcement la Con
gress to tbat effect at tbit time. Tbe question with
Mm a as simply one of expedience
Mr. THURMAN said me question was whether
the constitutional aiLCDdmebti were to be forced
upon tbe people oi Georgia and other bouthern
Elates, against the will of their people; tor It
could not be denied that a majority or the people
there were uppottd lo tLem. Tbe Stale oi onto
bail rejected the Fifteenth Amendment, and la tae
banie c( the people u( that Statu be protested
against the attempt to coerce a State
into doing that which was repugnant to tbe ma
■jorii vct per people. Ohio t»v ao.iwo majority bail
declared aaoiajt the Fifteenth Amendment and
it* rauflcatiou. By the coerc'oa or Che Southern
State Legislatures In Its support, they would tit
tuatly loicu upon Uhlj os weil oa noon Georgia, a
Uw to £hich tae people o( both Statu* were op*
posed, it tbe amendment ataoutd become part
of the constitution It would l>e equally
a law Xor Ohio as lor any other State, and, there*
fore, in the tame ot the people or the country, be
protested against tbe bit', lie could only express
his regret m view or tbe apparent determination
of Congress to cut loose from sll constitutional
precedents and Ignore tbe plain restrictions or
Congressional authority nndcr the constitution. “
Mr. SAW Viill said that if the people ot Georgia
bad learned anything or the temper or tbe Amen,
can people, they would tot refuse to adopt the
FUUenm Amendment, lor by its adoption they
could produce some proof that their cosmtioa was
such as to warrant restoration to their lamer
relations to the Union and government. In the
case of onto, it was not in the power of
Congress, cor did n become its duty, to
impore conditions in connection with tbe action
oi tbe State upon tbe proposed amendment, but
Georgia occupied a vastly different position. la
the rght of erects In that State in the post eight
tears, it became an Imperative duty forCongrvM
to aqnire Into the condition of its people, and, by
imposing conditions, to ascertain whether that
State could be admitted wttn solely to the slater*
hood of States.
Mr. BATAItt) said the tmpoiUlon of this new
condition tn the rase of Georgia «a* an additional
reatnre ot Us unialrcesa and Injustice. It llios*
iraied the fact mat no definite limit could be as
signed within which this piohlbitory action ap*
I diiil to the lately re be Ilium Slate* would termi
nate, and It mast depend on tbe caprice and
pleasure ot the dominant party In Congress.
By this bill Congress bad assumed to sit
in judgment n;oa tbe qualification*
of the Legislatures of States, and determine the
rights of voters in the Sraics. lie deprecated
that, becante of the evil and cosseqacnces Ittelv
to ersne from their example, and because the pre
cedent might return to plague it* Inventor*. The
means need to accomplish the ratification of the
pending constitutional amendment, lathe cose ot
Georgia, were almost farcical; bat though the end
might be secured, and the amendments be made
to tbe tatioool confutation by the mean* pro
posed, tt was impossible for Congres* to do that
against which the national Initinc*. revolted. Toe
negro could cot be made the superior of the white
man.
Hr. WILLIAMS maintained that to Congress
beloaged the power to determine
whether or not an amendment to the constitution
hart been adopted by the requisite namber of
State*, and to decide whether, in the event of the
passage of a mil by Congress declaring the adop
tion of a constitutional amendment which, in point
of fact, had never been acted upon, t: would be
contepded there w»* no power under the coretn*
incut 10 determine what was the law. Mr.Will
lams aakl. that a declaration by Congress that |
a constitutional amendment bad been I
ratified by ihree-foartha of the States
coaid tot be disaffirmed by the
judiciary; that power belonged exciaarefy to the
political department of the government, and, at
members of congress elected are under the so*
ictsnity of an oath, it was not to be readily u
turned that they would prove more recreant in
the matter referred to than in any others. The
Supreme Court might declare a law m conflict
with the confutation to be null and void. Its
power extended over sll questions arising under
the constitution, bat no: to the qncsuoa affecting
tbe existence nt the constitution itself.
Hr. now Aim said the amendment of the Sena*
tor from Indiana was not coercive, but left to the
pwoplccf Gtionjia the alternative of remaining la
the pmem condition or adopting the proposed
amimlmcnt to the constitution, li any excuse
were wanting for the imposition of this condition,

Mr. KDHUMVS reviewed the reconstruction
measures of Congress in their applicability to

HU not ocemrd advisable at this time to comply
with the request eoutalucd m the resolution. Re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Adairs.
POSTAL MAI TBIW.
Mr. DAWES offered a resolution calling on the
Podcaster General for Information, whether
any perron holding a United States office tuts
been employed by that to treat with
foreign cations to regard to posts }mattere,and, if
so, m conformity io what law, acd at what ex
pense, and from what appropriations paid.
Adopted.
The House then, at 8 o'clock, went Into Com
mittee of the Whole. on me President's annual
message, Mr. Allison In the chair, and wo* ad
dressed by Mr. MUNOBN In criticism of the
financial policy of me government. He advo
cated repudiation nf me national debt.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York, said the gentleman
from Ohio sold, acd wen aaid, mat be spoke only
forhlmtelL If what he said bad not been tab! on
the floor of the House, tn me presence of all of
us, I should coifed it necessary to disclaim all
responsibility for ms advocacy of repudiation, and
I mink I may *peak for the Democratic member*
from New York State, at well as for mvaelf, that
the national debt never has been, never can be,
never vriti be, repudiated. While much of what
the gentleman said is true, all mat relates to repo
ctetion wc utterly disclaim. We expect to pay
every cent of the debt, according to contract, and
undcrabeturand reduced system of taxation,
«c think it win be os easily paid aa the debt of the
war of 1518.
Mr. KERR Bald: While I remember very well
that my mend from Ohio (Mr. Mangen) did us on
this side the Justice to remark mat, in whatever
he was about to say, be would attempt to bind
Lot-ody but himself, yet I deetnlt an act of datv
to myself and to tnose whom I represent, and, I
believe 1 say U w'.th becoming modesty, to the
whole Democratic party of this country, to say
that I do notcndcree r*-pulla‘.lon la any form, and
that I do not believe that ihat great and honors*
Me paity of which I have the honor to be a ham-
Men ember, endorse any such theory. Wane I
approve of very much of what my friend from
outobss said, and while t believe ihat mere is
very great truth la much that he has saM, I think
It mv dmy to ray as much es I have now said, and
cuter my emphatic dirclaiuier of the conclusions
at d theories of my fnesd.
Mr. rdAXTM said: lam glad the gentleman
from Ohio makes no pretence ol representing any
political partv In the remarks he has made. The
congressional District 1 have the honor to repre
teat on this floor pays Into the Treasury mare
taxes than two or three of the Western States
combined, and 1 can assure the gentleman be rep
resents the sentiments of no political party tninat
district. For one, I here declare that no party, no
hope of political advancement will ever Induce me
to taror any measure tending toward repudiation ,
either dlrrctlv or indirectly; or any measure tend
trg to prevent this government from m*cnargiDg
every obligation Incurred In me suppression ol the
rebellion, and in strict accordance with the letter
a: d spirit of that law creating toe obligation. In
N half of the Democracy 1 represent, 1 heresy re
pudiate all rrpndtatore.
Mr. RANDALL said: I am utterly opposed to
repudiation. The moment allowed to me gives
me the opportunity to remonatrate agatnu me
enunciation of anv scheme of legislation which. I
believe, would place my country m a dishonest al
titude before the world. Not only do 1 believe that
we should pay the debt, but I believe what u of
vastly mere importance, mat the country has the
ability, the disposition, and the resources to pay.
T agree with the gentleman from Ohio, that this
debt was negotiated at ruinous rates. That is a
matter of Just criticism against me party who
then controlled the government, and made the ne
gotiation; but as those who sold the bonds npon
which is stamped the faith and credit of the cotta
tty, 1 say that repudiation stands in no other light
except the light of dishonesty.
Messrs. IHJTTEB. COX. and WOODWARD
expressed similar sentiments. During me dis
cussion the Republican members gathered around
the speakers, evincing intense interest la me pro
ceedings.
Mr. GARFIELD, at me close of the discussion,
suggested mat when the committee rise. It re
port a resolution mat me proposition, direct or
indirect, to repudiate any portion of me debtor
the United States, la unworthy the honor and
good name of the nation, and mat this House,
without distinction of party, seta the seat of con
demnation on any and all nch propositions. The
motion was ruled not of order. Inasmuch as it bad
b«en agreed upon mat co business should be
transacted either in the House or committee.
Mr. FITCH addressed the committee in favor
the :atnc<l ate recognition ot tbe independence of
Cobs, and Mr. WILLARD defended the position
Utkin in the President's message on mat subject.
Mr. GAHFIELDthen. by nnantmons consent,
moved tbat the committee report lo the House

the gunboats by running barges them tt
with petroleum, tut d*d not try u. Tseymay
possibly make an effort to-night.
It it stated that an attempt wav to have been
made to-night to destroy the Spanish gunboats
lying at the toot of Thirteenth street, North River,
by a party of fifty Cuban sympathis
ers. Information was given by one of
t&e party to the Spanish authorities
in tune to enable the latter to adopt the necevsaiy
measures to defeat the scheme. An extra force
of armed men was placed on tbe gunboata, and
the Cnbattf, finding the’rderign had leaked out,

ctraci:
In ibis dsy of jovons peace, p;iV!c safety, and
fnll erjoyruunt of ihe richest abundance of God's
•timings, we have asseranled to celshrate the
thin] annual holiday ol the Society of the Army of
•he Cumberland, ana commemorate the hallowed
tr.vcd*nlps formed beside the cvmp.flrcs, the
weary marches, and under the misty smoke ot
battle. We have stepped atlde from the
)<Qsy waits of daily life, and have
wended our way hither from tar
distant boiteii to stand In solemn retrospection,
l and in band, wltbnaltc-d hearts, honorable pur
liofcj',and united devotion, to pledge anew our
allegiance to the truth, Christianity, and univer
sal liberty, those Imperishable principles
which, under tbe win of unerring Providence,
vindicated the claims of humanity, severed the
galling tetters of the bondman, guaranteed the
rights of tee American citlxe*', punished treason
aud rebellion not unmercifully, and preserved tbe
grandeur of onr national unity. We are not here
to breathe the spirit of discord, rekindle the
passions of war, nor to invoke the demon of
political strife. Ours la a mission of good
will to all teen, fraternal harmony and the homage
of living acknowledgments of reverence to tbe
heroic dead, whose memories are forever en*
shrined in the hearts of the great brotherhood of
the society of thu Cumberland. Su’d we claim the
dearly purchased privilege of bearing testimony to
ihe military prowess, patriotism, heroic devotion,
and the gentlemanly deportment of tbe loyal sot*
dlcrof America, we thahk the Giver of au good
tbat thetr efforts were not in vain; tbat the legacy
of a free government,beqaeat hed to by os ocr revo
lutionary fathers, has not perished in this genera
tion. We are also thankful that to some of us
it has been granted to witness the fruits
patriotic bravery and wisdom, each trail?, my
friends, a* civil revolution*, do not often nrtag
form. Wbat reward, jewel, or cron, mold the
kingdoms cf the old world bestow in comparison
with the nocoracd gratification of having united
to securing to evciy American citizen equality be
fore the law, suuuiity to oar republican Institu
tions, and the happy realization of the wavering
hopes of the friends of freedom nshered into ex
istence T What wonderful ebanges are now be

Wbat grand rc*uiu have been achieve:! since Gen
eral Slurman, the world's admired hero, tented
the firtt battalions of tbe future Army of tbe
Cumberland on the picturesque slopes of Greca
Hirer? How vividly wc remember tits prophetic
sonooßcercent that It would require quadruple
more of power than the armed force then ou the
field to reach the stronghold* of the great rebel
lion? We also well remember that his clear and
cotrpreticruve estimate or the herculean task on
tu&d at race deprived him of his command and
signally disgraced some of the authorities at
U aihxgioo. How great a fulfitment of the destl

left acquiring the first rudlmcau of war!
oh. how changed the subsequ-ut scenes In
the great drama that ensued from the time when

In closing, be said:
“Mi triendr, 1 would have you bear wUb me

Men may come, and men may go, bat tae memory
