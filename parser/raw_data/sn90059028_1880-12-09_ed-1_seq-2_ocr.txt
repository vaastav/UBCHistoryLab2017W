CURRENT TOPICS.
BUSINESS men at the east are clamoring
for a new national bankrupt law, and gener
ality favor the Lowell bill now before the
judiciary committee of congress. The va
ried and conflicting insolvency laws of the
states and territories, area perpetual an
noyance to business men and a uniform
gystern seems to be generally demanded.
THE scarcity of cars east of Chicago is
severely felt in Minnesota. The Minneap
olis milters are compelled to store most of
the flour manufactured, and there is talk of
shutting down their mills. In the mean
time, a large number of elevators where
they purchase wheat are filled to overflow
ing, and as a temporary relief the millers
have sold and are shipping 500,000 bushels
to Chicago.
REV. DR. J. D. FULTON, a sensational
preacher of New York, believes that the
perehilia of the planets may have caused
diptheria, and that there may be coming on
the world calamities that have not been
hitherto known, besides plagues, and
storms and tidal waves, which will swamp
whole cities there are plagues sleeping in
the hands of God to which the contagion
THERE has been a steady decline for sev
eral days past in railroad securities, from
the high figures on last week, owing to the
active demand for money. In some cases a
premium has been paid, in addition to 6ix
per cent, per annum. The bank presidents,
however, say that millions of dollars are in
their vaults for want of use, which is a del
icate intimation that proper securities would
bring it out.
Sioux CITY and the country round about
is enthused by the discovery of a vein of
excellent coal, four and a half feet thick, at
Ponca, Nebraska. Prof. Aughey, the Ne
braska geologist, declares that the discovery
is of incalculable importance. The coal was
found at a depth of 580 feet, and measures
will be taken at once to sink a shaft and
bring it to the surfaee in sufficient quanti
ties to supply the demand of that section
for cheap fuel.
THE great political papers continue to fill
their columns with speculations in regard to
the composition of President Garfield's cab
inet, but as yet nothing is definitely known
in regard to the matter. That it will be
composed of new material is the only thing
that seems to be settled. The discussion
brings into prominence a very large number
of politicians whose peculiar qualifications
for the positions to which they aspire, are
not generally recognized.
now devastating our homes would be but as
a drop before an impending hower. Speak
ing particularly of diphtheria, Dr. Fulton
says this disease may be the result of a dis
turbance in the atmosphere consequent up
on the perihelian of the four great planets
—Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn. In
542 and 1665 three of the planets—Mare,
Jupiter and Saturn—were in p«rhelion, and
these were the worst plague eras of which
history has any record. In 1720 Mars and
Jupiter were in perihelion, and in the sin
gle city of Marseilles, France, 52,000 out of
75,000 of the population died.
EVEN those who believe the world is
growing better will be surprised at the au
thoritative statement, that while New York
city has increased 75,000 in the last five
years, crime has diminished twenty-five
per cent. This cheering result is attributed
to a variety of causes, the chief of which
are, the influence of the churches the grow
ing temperance sentiment, which has been
much more marked in other places than in
New York the discouragement of wilful
pauperism by systematic charities the en
forcement of attendance at school, and the
punishment of truancy by the authorities,
and the extensive mission work among the
most degraded and wretched of the popula
tion.
LAST November is remarkable as the
coldest November in ten years. The means
during this period are given by the signal
service observer at St. Paul, as,follows:

The highest temperature for last Novem
ber was 58, on the 3d, and the lowest, 18
degrees below zero, on the 25th. The pre
cipitations of moisture was also the larg
est in ten years, being 2.93 inches or over
an inch more than the average of the month
for ten years.
SECRETARY THOMPSON'S report on naval
affairs refers at length to the object he had
in view in sending shipB of war into as many
foreign ports as possible, which was to en
able the authorities and people of those
countries to understand that it is our desire
to cultivate with them the most amicable
commercial relations, and that both their
own interest and ours would be thereby
promoted. He recommends an increase of
the navy, and thinks that good policy re
quires the national government to employ
all its legitimate powers to increase, the
strength of our mercantile marine and says
that the increase of one should be propor
tioned to that of the other.
THE census tables have not been com
pleted but they are in a state of forward
ness to warrant the statement that the pop­
ulation of the country was almost exactly
50,000,000 when the census was taken. Al
abama, New Hampshire and Connecticut
have been nearly stationary for the last ten
years, while the largest absolute increase
has been in the city of New York and ad
joining counties, which from 1,456,631 in
1860, went to 1,765,415 in 1870, and thence
to 2,257,282 at the enumeration on the 1st
of June last. Facts and exact figures are
looked for with a great deal of interest by
political economists, and the general public
as well, and for a long time will afford
fruitful topics for discussions.
"THE Story of Endymion"—the title of a
new novel by Lord Beaconsfield, just pub
lished in London and New York—is having
an immense sale, owing more to the name
of the author than to its real merits. Near
ly all the characters are titled, and even the
few plebian personages who begin life as
tailors, milliners and lodging-house keepers
become railroad kings and baronets, mem
bers of parliament and countesses. The ac
tion begins at the time when Canning is on
his death-bed, and the duke of Wellington
is the hope of conservative England, and
comes along down to the fifties and sixties.
Lord Beaconsfield was paid $60,000 for the
manuscript of the work, and the publishers
en both sides the Atlantic will be handsome
lv remunerated for their large investment.
THE flannel question absorbs the Boston
mind at present. Many people are certify
ing that cotton undershirts, drawers and
stockings, are vastly preferable to flannel,
in every respect. A leading physician says
that the best results are accomplished by
wearing cotton in preference to any other
article next to the person, because of its
being a vegetable product, a fair non-con
ductor of heat to and from the body, and
also in a small degree an absorbent,—in
fact, possessing every essentially good fea
ture, and none that are objectionable. The
argument in favor of flannels as against cot
ton, is not presented, but it is not to be in
ferred that cotton will be immediately sub
stituted for wool, though experiments are
always in order.
THE presidential electors of Minnesota,
consisting of Joseph A. Thatcher of Good
hue county, L. G. Nelson of Kasson, J. T.
Williams of Mankato, William Schimmel of
St. Peter, and Knute Nelson of Alexandria,
met at the State capitol in St. Paul, on
Wednesday last, and cast their votes in due
form for James A. Garfield for president,
and Chester A. Arthur, for vice president.
The electors by unanimous vote, elected
Hon. Joseph A. Thatcher, of Goodhue
county, as messenger to carry the official
report and deliver it in person to the vice
president of the United States at Washing
ton. J. T. Williams was appointed as cus
todian ot the returns to be deposited, one
in the postoffice in St. Paul, directed to the
vice president, and the other to be handed
to the United States judge at St. Paul. The
electors of all the other States, with the ex
ception of Georgia, also met and cast their
votes, according to law and in accordance
with the popular vote. The Georgia vote is
possibly lost to Hancock and English, for
non-compliance with law. The statutes of
the United States provide, in section 135,
that the electoral colleges of the several
States shall meet on the first Wednesday of
December and cast their votes. The Geor
gia code provides that the governor shall
notify the electors to meet at the capital on
the first Monday of December, to be ready
on the Monday following to cast their votes.
This the governor has done, but the electors
did not meet, and it is thought by leading
officials and lawyers that they have no right
to meet and vote next week Wednesday.
CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY.
MONDAY, DEC. 6, 1880.
SEXATE.—Forty-eight senators, or nearly two
thirds of the entire body, were in their seats at
noon. The vice president called the senate to
order, and the chaplain offered prayer appro
priate to the .occasion. Mr. Brown of Georgia
and Mr. Pugh of Alabama were sworn in to fill
existing vacancies. Nothing beyond necessary
routine business was then transacted, until the
arrival of the president's private secretary with
his annual message, after the reading of which
the senate adjourned. Senator Grover of Ore
gon, of whose bad health there has been so
much said lately, was present all day.
HOUSE.—At exactly noon, the Speaker called
the House to order. Number of Members
present 227. Tke members from both sides
commingled freely and all seemed in the best of
humor. Alexander Stephens rolled around in
his easy chair, and received the congratulations
of members upon his improved health. Gar
field's vacant chair and desk was appropriated
by Page, of California. The President's mes
sage was received about 1:30. Bills and reso
lutions were presented from different States, re
lating to the tariff for the temporary increase
of the Supreme Court Justices by Mr. Con
verse, fixing the salary of the Resident at
$25,000 per annum, payable monthly by Mr.
Ward, appropriating$10io,000for a monument
to Gen. Layfette, to be erected on the site of the
battle of Brandywine. After the announcement
of the death of Bepresentative Farr, of New
Hampshire, the House adjourned.
A Raid on Oleomargarine.
The butter dealers of Chicago have had a
conference for the purpose of protecting the
trade against adulterated butter and cheese,
which are at present flooding the market.
Recent exposures of the villianous character
of the compounds which are manufactured
and sold as butter has greatly damaged busi
ness, and rendered some action necessary.
The only feasible plan suggested was that
dealers in the bogus article be compelled to
label it under its appropriate name. The
last legislature passed a law requiring this
to be done, but no steps have been taken to
enforce it, and it is practically a dead letter.
Resolutions were adopted requesting the
produce exchange to take action towards
enforcing obedience to the law and prom
ising hearty co-operation. Some $1,200
was raised on the spot to further the object
of the meeting, and active war will be made
on the disgusting traffic.

Cattle on Railroads.
The supreme Court of Minnesota has
rendered the following decission, which is
of some importance to parties concerned:

adjoining lands may stray upon the track on ac
count of the absence of a fence. The adjoining
land owner is not to be deprived of the use of
his land by the failure of the company to fence,
and in using the same he has aright to expect
this course of conduct on the part of the com
pany. Whether in exercising nis right to use

ligence, contributing to no injury to hisvattie is
ordinarily a question of fact for a jury, to be
determined with reference to all the circum
stances ofthe case, and the duty of the company

to graze upon his land or to go to a spring
thereon, in broad daylight, is not such negli
gence on the part of the land owner in law,
notwithstanding the company's road is un
fenced, and notwithstanding there is another
railroad within a few hundred feet
