place also, at the beginning of the new
year, and then, let ns hope, will he com
pleted the work of recotmmiotion.
With an acquiescence n the part of (he
whole people In the national oblixatlnna
to pay the public debt created as the price
of our union, the pensions to oar disabled
oldiers and Bailors, and their widows and
orphans, and In the changes to the Con
aliuition which have been mnde neeeaaarv
by a great rebellion, there ia no reason
why we should not advance In material
prosperity and hnpplness, as no other na
tlon ever did after so protracted aud Ie
vaUog a war.
THE WAR IN EUROPE.
The Presiient stntes that tfoon after the
war broke out our Minister in Paris was
instructed to afford protection to German
and other oitisens iu the French Capital,
whloh duty has been satisfactorily perform
ed. Ou the proclamation of a Republic In
France, our Minister waa Instructed to
offer the congratulations of the President
and people of this country. An appesl
was made to our Government to join with
the European powers In efforts to restore
peace. The President replied that our e
tablixhed policy forbade Us to Interfere In
European affairs. He add: ''Should the
time come when the action of the United
Suites can hasten the return of peace by a
single hour, that action will te heartily
taken.'
NEUTRALITY.
In vlewf the large number of persons
of French and German birth living In tbi
country, It was deemed prudent to lxsue a
proclamation soon after war waa declared,
defining the duties of the t.overomeut td
iia citizen In preserving neutrality, which
materially assisted ia preventing ila viola
tion. j
CUBA AND SPAIN.
Affalrsla'Cuba have not materially chang
ed since the last session of Contrress. In
the early part of the contest in that island
nspeoted persons were subjected to ar
bitrary arrest, imprisonment, military trial
and execution, and coiiflm'ication of prop
erty by the Cuban authorities. As far as
these proceedings effected American eitl
aens they were In violation of the treaty of
1795 between Spim and this country, and
our Government was compelled to appeal
to Madrid f ir redrew. A Joint tribunal
wss proposed for the settlement of cluim
of our citizens for past violations cf the
treaty, and und"r tbis proposition the
-dalrn of the American ship, "Lloyd As
plnwail" for illegal seizure and dctentiou
by the Cubin authorities, baa been settled
by an award of il9.70'.i W to the U. S. foril
owners. The cluim of the American
whale ship "Canada" has been settled in
like manner, the British Minister, .Sir Ed
ward Thornton, having acted as aibilralor,
and awarded the U. S. Sl00.7t0.09 In gold,
which has been paid. It is hoped that
Rpain will agr-e to settle all other pending
claims in the same manner, and negotia
tions with thtt object are still pending. It is
also claimed by our Government that in
future our treaty rights shall be fullhfully
res pec ted in Cuba.

liow this result is to be otherwise ac

Domingo is an adhesion to the Monroe
doctrine ; h it measure of national
protection - it is an assertion of our
just claim to a controlling influence
over the great commercial truffle aoon
to flow from west tieast by way ot
the Isthmus of Darien ; it is to build
up cur former merchant marine ; U is
to furuisli a new market for , the pro
duels of our farms, shops and manufact

and ultimately so in Brazil ; it is to
settle the unhappy condition of Cubu,
and end an exterminating conflict ; it
is to providw honest means of paying
our honest debts, without over, taxing
the people ; it is to furnish our citizens
with the necessaries of every day life
.it cheaper rates than ever before ; and
i( is. in fine, a rapid stride toward that
greatness which the intelligence, indus
try and enterpris - of the citizens of the
United States entitle this coun ry to
assume among nations. -
-In view of the importance of this
question, I earnestly urge upon Con
gress an early expression ol its views
as to the best means of acquiring fcan
Dominen. My suggestion is that by
joint resolution of the two Houses of
Congress the Executive be authorized
to appoint a commission to negotitate
for a treaty with theauthorities or Han
Domingo, for the acquisition of that
island, and that an appropriation be
made to defray the expense of such
ommission. The question may then
be determined ty the action of the two
Houses of Congress upon a resolution
iif annexation, as in the case of Texas.
"So convinced am I of the advant
iges to follow from the acquisition of
San Domingo, and of the great disad
vantages I might say almost calam
ines to flow from non-acquisition,
that 1 believe the subject has only to
be investigated to be approved."

THE FISHERY QUESTION.
of
of
it
-
The President states that the authori
ties ot the "Iiomiuiou of Canada" have
recently manifested an unfriendly feeling
towards our fishing vessels on theit coasts,
Vessels fishing within three miles of the
eoasts "have been seized without notice or
warning, in violation of tre custom prev
iously prevailing, and have been taken
into the Colonial porta, their voyages
broken tip and the vessels condemned."
"The statutes of the Dominion of Canada
assume still broader and more unteuuble
jurisdiction over the vessels of the United
States" even to declaring such vessels,
their tackle, Ac. to be forfeited if found
tishing within three miles of the British
coast. .The President says: "It ia not
known that any condemnations have been
made under tbis statute. Should the au
thorities of Canada attempt to enforce it,
Hi become my duty to take such steps
it
as may be necessary to protect the rights
ol the citizens of the United States."
The claim is now set up by her Majesty
officers tbat our fishing vessels have no
riht to enter the British porta in North
America for the purpose of trading, except
to purcliase wuud aud water, and that they
must depart within twenty-lour hours, af
ter receiving notice to leave. It is not
known that any of our vessels have- been
seized under this claim,. but the President
declares it caunot be acquiesced in by our
Government, and that it Is contrary to the
Convention of 18.18. Anticipating that
these unfriendly acts of the Canadian au
thorities may be repeated the coming tea
sou, be recommends Congress to autho
rise him to suspend by proclamation,
operations of the laws authorizing
transit of goods, wares and merchandize
bond, or access to the territory of
United States from Canada ; and further,
should such an extreme measure become
necessary, to suspend the operations
any lata whereby the vessels of l be Do
minion of Cinada are permitted to enter
the waters of the United States."
FREE KAVIOATIOS fiT TKB 8T. 'lAWBESCE.
The President states that a similar un
friendly disposition has been manifested
by Canada, in claiming a right to exclude
our citizens from the navigation of the
Lawrence river. He says :
"This river constitutes a natural outlet
to the ocean for States of the Union with
an aggregate population of about 17,600,
000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate
rtonnage of 661,367 tons upon the waters
which discharge into it. The foreign com
merce of Our ports on these waters is open
to British competition, and the major part
of it is done in British bottoms. If
American seamen be excluded from
natural avenue to the ocean, the monopoly
of the direct commerce of I lie lake ports
with the Atlantic svouJd be in foreign
hands, their vessels dn trans-Atlantic voy
ages, tiavinir an- access to our lake ports
wlj(.h w,,,,; 4, tfenifcd loaUoerican ves-
ee8 on similar voyages. To state ouch
proposition is to refute its justic."
Tbe Preideut cites the example of other
'nations which have declared the naviga-
tion of great riven fcee to tb peopl
the countries bordering upon themj and
states that Mr. Clay, during the adminis
tration xif Jobs Quiney Adams, unques
tionably demonstrated tha natural right of
our citizens to the free navigation of the
St. Lawrence to and into the sea, even
though passing through the territory of
another power.Tbe President says ; . (
"This right does not exclude the co-equal
right of the sovereign possessing the terri
tory througti whica tlie river debouches
into Uie sea, to make such regulations re
lative to the policy of navigation as may
be reasonably 'necessary j but those regu
lations should be framed in a spirit ol
coutityk and should nut impose needless,
burdens upon the commerce which has the
right of transit. It has been found in
practice more advantageous to arrange
these regulations by tuutual agreements.
The L ulled States are ready to make any
arrangement as to the police of the St.
Lawrence, which tuay U suggested by
Great Britain. .
' v ' : ' '
The whole nation is interested In se
curing cheap transportation from the agri
cultural States ot the West to the Atlantic
seaboard. To the citizens of those States
it secures a greater return for their labor ;
to the iubabilauts of the seaboard it offers
cheaper food ; and to the nation an in
crease in the annual surplus of wealth. It
is hoped thai the Government of Great
Britain will see the justice of abandoning
the narrow and Inconsistent claims to
which uer Canadiau froviuces have urged
her adherence."
OUR DEPRESSED COMMERCE.
The President refers to the fact that the
greater share of our foreign commerce is
now carried ou in foreigu vessels. He
says t
"The cost of building iron vessels, the
only ones that can compete with foreign
ships in the carrying trade, is so much
greater in tho United States than in for
eign countries, that without some assist
ance from the Government they cannot
successfully be built here. There will lie
several propositions laid before Congress
in the course of the present session, loot
ing to a remedy for this evil. . Even if it
should be at some cost to the National
Trensurv. I hope such encouragement will
be given as will secure American shipping
on . the high seas, aud American ship
building at home."
1HI FINANCES OF TAB GOVERNMENT,
We copy In full (ho paragraphs of the
Message referring to tbis important 8ub
ject, and commend them to the special at
tion of our readers :
The estimates for the expenses of the
Government for the next fiscal year are
$18,244,346.01 less than forthecurrent one,
but exceed the appropriations for the pres
ent year fot the same items, $8,972,127.55.
in the estimate, however, is iucluded $22,
338,278.37 for public works heretofore be
gun under Congressional provision, and of
which only so much Is asked as Congress
may choose to give. The appropriation
for the same works for the present fiscal
year was $11,984,818.08. ,
The average Value of gold, as compared
with national currency, for the whole of
the year lbti9, waa about 134, and for
eleven months of 1870 the same relative
value has been about 115. The approach
to a specie basis is very gratifying, but the
fact can not be denied that the instability
of the values of our currency is prejudicial
to our prosperity, and tends to keep up
prices, to the detriment - of trade. The
evils of a depreciated aud fluctuating cur
rency are so grest that now, when the
premium on gold bus fallen so much. It
would seem that the time has arrived
when, by wise and prudent legislation.
Congress 'should look to a policy which
would place our currency nt par with gold
at no distant day. The tax collected Irom
the people has been reduced more than
eighty million dollars per anuum. By
steadiness in our preseut course, there is
no reason why in a few short years the
national tax gatherer may not disappear
from the dour of the citizen almost entire
ly. With tho revenue stamps dispensed
by the poslmasiars in every community; a
tx upou liquors of all sorts, and tobacco
in all its forms, and by a wise adjustment
of the tarill', which will put a duty ouly
upon those articles which one could dis
pense with, known as luxuries, and on
those which we use more of than we
produce, revenue enough may be pro
duced after a lew years of peace and the
consequent reduciiou of indebtedness, to
fulfill all our obligations. A lurcher re
duction of the interest account may te ro
lled on to make this practicable.
REVENUE REFORM.
If it means this, has my hearty support.
If it implies a collection of all the reve
nue for the support of Government, for the
PHvment of principal and interest of the
public debt, pensions, etc, by directly
taxing the people, then 1 am against ''reve
nue reform," aud confidently believe tho
ueoule are with me. If it means failure to
provide the uecessarv means to defray all
expenses of the Government and thereby
repudiation ol the public debt and pen
sions, then I am still more opposed to
such kind of "leveuue reform." "Reve
nue reform" lias not been defined by any
of its advocates to my knowledge, but
seems to be accepted as something which
is to Biipply every man's wants without
any cost or effort on his part. . A true rev
enue reform cannot be made in a day, but
must ia) the work of national legislation
and of time. As soon as the revenue can
be dispensed wilh, all duty should be re
moved from coll ee, tea, aud other articles
of universal use, not produced by our
belves. The necessities of the country
compel us to collect revenue from our im
ports. An armv of Assessors and Collect-
! o:s is not a pleasant sight to the citizens,
but that or a tariff Tor revenue is necessa
ry. Such a tariff, so far as it acta in en
couragement to home products, atTords
employment to labor at living wages, in
oontrnat to the pauper labor of the Old
World, and, also, aids iu the developemeut
of home re&ources. .
ARMY AND NAVY.
the
the
in
the
of
St.
the
The army has been gradually reduced
j ud the act of July, 1870, and it will not
exceed, at the beiriuning ol next year, tne
number authorized by law. A very sat
isfactory reduction Is shown in the ex
penses of the army for the last year, for
details of which Congress' is referred
the report of the Secretary of War.
The President recommends an appro
priation for a new building f.r the War
Department.
The expenses of the Navy were reduced
last year about one million below those
the previous yeur, or to less than nineteen
millions. The estimates for the current
year are $28,205,G78.37.
The appropriations made for the last
and current years, were evidently intend
ed by Congress to be, and are sufficient
oujy to ker p the navy ou its present .foot
ing, and for thereparing and refitting
our old Rhlps. This policy mnst. of conrse,
gradually but surely destroy the navy,
and is, itself, far from economical, as each
year that it ia pursued the necessity for
more repairs in ships and navy yards be
comes more imperative and more costly,
and our current expenses are increased
the mere repair of ships, many of which
must soon be unseawortby aud useless.
I hope during the present sesaidn
Congress to be able to submit to it a plan
by which naval vessels ran tie built and
repairs made with a great Saving upon
the present cost. It can hardly be wise
statesmanship in a Government which
represents a country with over five thou
sand miles of coast line, on both oeeans,
exclusive of Alaska, aud containing 40,
000,000 of progressive people, with rela
tions of every nature with almost every
foreign country, to rest with such inade
quate means of enforcing any foreign pol
icy, either of protection or redress. Separated
by the ocean from the nations
the eastern continent, onr Navy is our on
ly means of direct protection to our citizens
abroad, or for th enforcement of any for
eign policy.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.

of
The accompanying report of the Post
master General shows a most satisfactory
working Of the Department. With fbe
adoption of the recommendations con
tained therein, particularly those relating
to a reform in the franking privilege and
adoption of correspondence cards, a self-
sustaining postal spstem may speedily
looked lor, and at no distant day, a furth
er reduction of the rats of postals will

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
Alwsvs favoring practical reforms,
I respectfully call your attention to one
abuse of long standing which I would like
to see remedied by this Congress. It is a
reform in the civil service ol the country.
I would have it go beyond the mere tenure
of office of clerks or employes who do not
require the advice and consent of the Sen
ate to make their appointments complete.
I would have it govern, not the tenure,
but the manner of making all appoint
ments. ' - -
There Is no duty which so much embar-
asses the Executive and heads of Depart
ments as that of appointments, nor is there
any such arduous and thankless labor im
posed on Senators and Kepresentatlves as
that of finding places for constituents.
The present system does not secure the
best men and often not even nt men for
public places. The elevation and purifi
cation of the civil service of the Govern
ment will be bailed with approval by the
w hole people of the United Slates. -"
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
Reform In the management of Indian af
fairs has received the special attention of
the Administration from its inauguration
to the present day. The experiment of
making it a'missionary work, was tried
with a few agencies given to the denomin
ation of Friends, and has been found to
work most advantageously. All agencies
and superintendencles not so disposed of
were given to officers of the army.
The act of Congress reducing the army
renders army officers ineligible for civil
positions, Iudian agents being civil offi
ces, I determined to give all the agencies
to such religious denominations as had
heretofore established missions among the
Indians, and perhaps to some other de
nominations which would undertake '.the
work ou the suuie terms,ta3 a missionary
work.
The societies selected are allowed to
name their own agents, subject to the ap
proval of the Executive, and are expected
to watch over them and aid ibem aa mis
sionaries and christians, and civilize the
Indian, and to train bim in the arts of
oeace. The Government watches over
the official acts of these agents, and re
quires of them as strict an accountability
asiftttev were appointed in any other
manner.- I entertain the confident hope
that the policy now pursued will iu a few
years bring ail the Indians upon a reser
vation where they will live in houses, and
have school houses and churches, and
where they will be pursuing peaceful and
self-sustaining avocations, aud where they
may be visited by the law-ahidin white
man with the same impunity that he now
visits the civilized white settlements. I
call your special attention to the report of
the Commisioner of Indian Affairs for full
Information oh this subject.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
'
of
of
During tho last fiscal yenr 8,095,413
acres of public lane's w-ts disposed of.
Of this quantity, 3,693.05 acres were
taken under the homestead law, and
2,159.515 81 acres sold for cash. The
remainder was located with military
warrant, agricultural college or Indi
an scrip, or applied in satisfaction of
grants to various railroads, or for
other public uses. The entries under
tho homestead law, dqring the past
yea?, covered 961,541.55 acres, mr
than those during the preceding
year. Surveys have been vigorously
proseeuted to the extent of the means
applicable to the purpose. The quan
tit' of land in market will amply
supply the present demand.
Tho President refers to tho existing
laws which secure . homcpteads to
actual settlers on' public lands on
much more liberal terms than former
ly, and which place a home within
the reach of all. Ho approves this
pol'cy, and also the setting apart to
new States of certain lands for educa
tional purpose,'. Ho adds :
When ample provisions shall have
been made for this object, I submit as
a question worthy ot serious consider
ation, whether the residue of our na
tional domain should not be wholly
disposed of under the provisions of
the homestead ana pre-emption laws
In addition to the nvnran and
overflowed lands granted to the States
in which they arc situated, the lands
tuaen under tho Agricultural College
acts, and tor internal improvements,
or improvement purposes, under the
act ot September, 1811, and the nets
supplemental thereto, there had been
convoyed up to tho close of the last
fiscal year, by 'patent or other equiva
letit evidence of title, to Slates and
coipiratior s, 2.733 25 and 13 100 acres
for railways, canstls and wagon rouds
It is tstimatcd that an addi
tional qnanthy, ot 1 i 4,i M,iS.i acres
is btiil duo under grants lor like
uses. The policy ot mus aiuing tne
Stales in building works of internal
improvements was inaugurated more
than forty years since by grants to
Indiana and Illinois, to aid them in
opening canals to connect the wa
ters of the Wabash with those of
Lake Eric, and the waters of the
Illinois with those of Lake Michigan.
It was followed with somo modifica
tion in the grant to Illinois of alter
nate sections of public land within
certain limits to tho Illinois Central
Railway.
Fourteen States and sundry corpo
rations have received similar subsi
dies, in connection with railways com
pleted or in process of construction.
As the reserved sections are rated at
the double minimum, the sale of them
at the enhanced price has thus in
many instances indemnified the treas
ury for the granted lands. The con
struction of some of these thorough
fares has undoubtedly given' vigorous
impetus to tho developemeot of our
resources and the . settlement ol
the more distant portions of the
country.
It raaj-, however, be well insisted
that much of our legislation in this
regard has been cbaructerizod by in
discriminate and pi;ofi!icliberality.
The United Slates should not loan
their credit in aid of any enterprise
undertaken by Suites or corporations,
unless the projected' works ate cf
acknowledged national importance.
I am strongly inclined to tho opinion
that it is expedient and necessary to
stop subsidies of either description, but
should Congress determine otherwise,
I earnestly recommend that the rights
of settlers, and of the public, be more
effectually secured by appropriate
legislation. ,
THE PATENT OFFICE.
of
Durinr the year ending Septem
ber 20, 1870, there were filed in the
Patent Office 19,411 applications lor
the extension of patents ; 6,bZi pat
ents, Including reissues and designs,
wore issued ; 110 extended ; and 1,080
allowed but not issued by reason ot
the non-payment of final fees. The
receipts of the office during the fiscal
year were $130,31)4.29 in excess of its
expenditures.
THE CENSUS.
of
be
be
The work of the Census Bureau
has been energetically propecnteJ; the
preliminary report, containing much
information of special value and in
terest, will be rady lor delivery
during lhe present eession. The re
maining volumes will be completed
ni h all dispatch consisteet with
perfect ocouracy in . arranging nd
classifying tho returns. We ehall thus
ut no distant day bo furnished with
an authentic record of our condition
and resources. It will, I doubt not,
attest the growing prosperity of the
tountry, although during the decaao
which has just closed, it was so se
verely tried by tbe great wit Waged
to maintain its integrity and to secure
and perpetuate our fred institu
tional , ;.---'.
PENSIONS.
During the last fiscal year the sum
paid to pensioners, including the cost
of disbursement, was $27,780,81 I II,"
and 1,758 bounty land warrants were
issued. ' At its' close 198,680 names
were on the pension rolls. The
labors of the Pension Offlco have been
directed to a severe sciu inyofthe ev!
dence submitted in favor of controvert
ed claims, and to " tho- 'discovery- of
fictitious claims which have boon
heretofore allowed. The appropria
tion for the employment of special
agents for the investigation of frauds
has been judiciously used'and tho
results obtained have been of unques
tionable benefit to the Borvice.
EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE.
The eubjeets of education aud agri
culture " are of' great interest to the
success of our Republican institutions,
happiness and grandeur as a nation.
In tho interests of one a buroau has
been established in the Interior De
partment, the Bureau of Education ;
and in the interests ot tho other a
separate Dopartment, that of Agri
culture. I believe great general good
is to follow from the operations of
both these bureaus, if properly
fostered. I can not commend to your
careful consideration too highly the
reports of the Commissioners of
Education and ot Agriculture, nor
urge too strongly liberal legislation
to secure their efficiency.
MISCELLANEOUS.
Treaties for the extradition of crim
inals have beea coucluded with sever
al of the Central American republics,
and others are in pr6gress.
The early action of Congress U re.
quested in regard to the commission
heretofore appointed oa claims against
Venezuela,
The President states that after the
recent massacre of French and ltussian
residents in China, he requested France
and Germany to suspend hostilities in
that quarter, and to direct their naval
officers to act with ours in the future
protection of Americans and Eu
ropeans in China.
The naturalization, treaty, and the
treaty abolishing mixed courts for
the suppression of the slave trade,
have been ratified with Great Britain
An error was discovered last April
in the boundary line between the U
States and British Possessions,' near
Pembiana, by which the fort of the
Hudson's Bay Company is found to be
within the real limits of the U. States.
The President consented that the
British occupation of the Fort should
continue for the present ; and he rec
ommends the appointment of a joint
commission to fix the true boundary
line from the Lake of the Woods to
the summit of the Rocky Mountains.
A new building is needed for the
preservation of the Government ar
chives in tho State department, and
Congress is asked for a suitable appro
priation. The President recommends that all
powers and duties in relation to the
Territories, with which the State De
partment is now charged, be trans
ferred to the Interior Department
and that the payment of soldiers' pen
sions bo transferred from the Interior
to the. War Department, and that
naval pensions to the Navy Depart
ment. He also recommends that the
Postmaster Oeneral and Attorney
General be authorized to issue all com
missions to officers appointed in their
respective departments
Tne' Message very appropriately
concludes with the following clear
and Intelligent statement of the
MISCELLANEOUS. POLICY OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
In'conclusion, I would sum up the
policy of the Administration to bo,
thorough enforcement or every law ;
faithful colli ction of the taxes provided
for: economy in the disbursement of
the same a prompt payment of every
debt of the" nation ; a reduction of taxes
as rapidly as the requirements of the
country will edmit ; reduction of tax
ation and tariff to be so arranged as
afford the greatest relief to the great
est number; honest and fair dealings
With all other people, to the end that
war, with all its blighting conse
quences, may be avoided, but without
surrendering any right or obligation
due to us ; a reform in the "treatment
of Indians, and In every department
of the civil service of the country
and a firm purpose in securing a free,
untrarameled ballot, by which every
man entitled to cast a vote may do
just once at each electionrand without
fear of molestation or proscription on
account of his political faith, nativity
or color. U. S. GRANT.
