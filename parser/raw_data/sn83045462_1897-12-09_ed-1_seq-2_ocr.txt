SEVERAL ACCIDENTS TODAY
NEW YORK, December 9.?The early
Jiours of the fourth day of the great six
day bicycle race found eighteen men still
pedaling away for honor ar.d profit. The
men were all seemingly determined, with
the possible exception of Stephane, who
had developed a case of stubbornness which
his trainer had a hard time combating
The motion of the wheel is beginning to af
fect the riders' brains, and even in the fitful
snatches of sleep which they allow them
selves they imagine they are still riding.
The men must be forced to sleep most
Instances by the trainers. They want to
be up and away at the pace which has
shown no lagging since the start.
Miller Afraid to Sleep.
This is most plainly evinced In Miller's
case. With more than fifty miles in the
lead of the second best man he is anxious
und insists upon sticking to the track. Not
only that, but he spurts whenever any one
offers him the chance. He Is jealous c.f
every lap made by the other.*, and is fear
ful lest during an interim of rest his lead
will be stolen from him. As a matter of
fact he could spend three hours on his
cot without serious less, but his trainers
cannot convince him of that. The wonder
ful endurance of the men is best shown
by the actual time spent in sleep by the
leaders. Miller had slept just one hour
and six minutes in the first seventy-two
hours of the race. Rivierre rode 1,124
miles without a wink of sleep, and he then
took two hours. Waller had slept three
hours. Rice five hours, Moore six hours,
Pierce six and a half hours, Golden nine
and three-quarter hours, and Stephane
seven hours in the same time. Elkes made
l.COO miles In the first seventy-two hours,
despite the fact that he had slept twenty
hours. The actual time spent off the track
by the leaders is as follows:
_ Miller, 2 hours; Rivierre, 3 hours; Waller,
hours: Rice, (J hours; Moore, 7 hours:
Pierce, 7 hours; Golden, ICM/i hours; Step
har.e, 'J hours; Elkes, 21Vi hours.
Two Fa I Im During; MorniiiR.
There were two falls during the early
morning hours. Pierre, who has been par
ticularly unfortunate in that respect, fell
at the 4th avenue end of the track about
2 o'clock. Gray was so close behind that he
threw himself forward to save himself.
Gray was so rattled that he jumped from
bis wheel. Moore ascended so high on the
Madison avenue bank about .'1 o'clock that
he slipped down the curb. 41e was unin
jured. Kurloiifc as the clip has been (luring
I he days that. h.!?ve passed, the pace during
this mornii^f v-fi* something terrific. Wal
ler, who came on about 1 o'clock, set the
ball rolling and "kept It up for three hours.
Miller, who ftai* been sleeping, jumped In
behind as sqoh^s he had returned to the
track, and uotli men raced around the
track lap Shot*1 lap, the sleepers all the
while yelling like mad. Hale let himself
out in dead easiest this morning. Begin
ning abouL2, o'jclock, he clipped off lap
after lap at such a pace that Rivierre, who
tcok pace 'from him. had to drop out.
Schinneer fodo' steadily with Rice and
Elkes. keeping him company, and the trio
took on many laps in that manner. Hale,
it is claimed,-WjuSt beginning to show his
true form, und will be heard from at the
finish. ?<- ?
Selilimeor Hum Trouble*.
Schinneer had troubles this morning.
Fir-t Ill's" WfroM became damaged' a fid he
had to dismount; to have it reyalrfd. Then,
nt 0:30, he Xell off and hurt his knee, forc
ing him off for twenty minutes, lie fell
again at 7:15. but remounted and was ofT
again. It was reported at 5 o'clock that
Stephane was 111. The nature of his ail
ment could not be ascertained. Golden was
not feeling Well. He left, the track at 4
o'clock, after having peevishly said fiat he
had not had enough sleep. Stephane was
stretched on his cot. unable to sleep. His
eyes, dreadfully bloodshot, stared wildly.
He was brought into shape at 5UX) o'clock,
when he returned to the track. Golden's
illness was of short duration. He stayed off
for an hour and returned much refreshed,
having slept forty-five minutes.
At 10:30 there was a bad collision on the
2lilh street side of the garden. Rice was
setting the pace, with Schinneer and Ri
vierre sprinting behind. Simultaneously
Schlnner and Rivierre started to pass tne
leader. Schinneer's wheel swerved toward
the outside and collided with Rivierre and
both riders fell. Hale, who was riding
slowly in fourth place, jumped from his
machine quickly and saved himself from
a bad fall. Enterman, Pierce, Moore and
King were not so fortunate. They were
riding in a close bunch and neither could
steer clear of the fallen men. Pierce's
wheel struck Schinneer and he fell, carry
ing the others with him. Pierce and
Schinneer were carried to their quarters,
but if'er being rubbed for a few moments
both; remounted, and, amid the cheers of
the crowd, they again set out on their long
ride. The others had meanwhile resumed
their places in the race. All of the riders
were pretty badly shaken up, but none of
them was badly hurt.

NOW IN BUDGET COMMITTEE
Sharp Discussion of Naval Bill in German
All Parties Aailraa to Kaon How the
Necessary Money la to Be
Raised.
BERLIN. December 9.?The relchstag to
day resumed the debate on the first reading
of the government's naval bill. Heir Ham
ir.acher, national liberal, said that his party
unanimously approved the principles of
the measure and attached the greatest im
portance to the navy. In connection with
the export trade, the speaker thought the
ctmmerclal policy of the United States and
Great Britain should be particularly con
sidered.
Herr Gailer, people's party, said his
party would oppose the bill, which, he as
serted, was the first step toward the estab
lishment of naval absolutism.
"Guns," Herr Gailer continued, "cannot
open new markets. South Germany is ab
solutely opposed to the measury."
Herr Zimmermann said the reform party
desired to favorably consider the measure,
but they demanded guaranties that the
burden of new taxation would not fall upon
the distressed middle classes. He believed
a majority of the party would vote for an
amended bill.
The Bavarian Peasants' Association, said
Herr Hilpert. reserved Its decision pending
the government's explanations relative to
the manner of providing the money neces
sary.
After other speeches had been delivered
the naval bill was referred to the budget
committee.
PENSION* CLAIMS REJECTED.
Several Important Holing* by As
nlKtunt Secretary Davis.
Mr. Davis, assistant secretary of the In
terior, has made rulings In several cases
which will a(Tect a large number of claims
now before the bureau. One of them is in
the claim of Gardner P. Van Alstlne, late
Company E, 7th New York V. H. A. The
appellant Is o pensioner under the general
law at the rate of $45 on account of loss
of right leg so near the hip Joint as to pre
vent the use of an artificial limb. He ap
plies for an Increase to $72 per month for
total helplessness. The report of the medi
cal referee under date of September 21.
1897, says: "The present rate of $45 per
month Is the specific rate allowed for loss
of leg so near the hip joint, as to prevent
the use of an artificial limb for which
soldier Is pensioned. The helpless condition
of the pensioner Is shown to be due In part
to rheumatism and disease of heart for
which not pensioned." In his decision, As
sistant Secretary Davis says:
"The mere fact that the claimant is dis
abled to such an extent as to require
the constant aid and attendance of another
person is not sufficient to entitle him to a
rating of $72. It must be shown that the
disabling cause or causes are either due to
his military service or that they are the re
sult of the cause on account of which he
is receiving pension, in this case the sol
dier Is in receipt of a pension of $45 per
month on account of amputation so near
the hip joint as to prevent the wearing of
an artificial limb. It is not allegi-d, neither
is it attempted to prove, that rheumatism
and disease of heart, which appear to be
shown in part to contribute to the claim
ant's present condition, are due to his mili
tary service, or that they are the result of
amputation. 1 am therefore constrained to
hold that the claimant's present condition
is due In part to other than the pensioned
causes, and therefore the claim is re
jected."
Another claim Is that of Marion Johnson,
late Company C, 1st Iowa Cavalry. In
this case there Is no evidence as to the
existence of the pensioner's disability for
the time to which the appeal relates other
than the certificate of medical examina
tion, as found on tile, there being a mass
of evidence in opposition to the board of
examination, and in this case Assistant
Secretary Davis makes the following im
portant ruling, to-wit:
"That the ratings given by a board of ex- ;
amlning surgeons are not necessarily to be
accepted by the pension office. They are to
be considered In connection with the de
scription given by them and the other evi
dence as to the extent of disability, and ..ie
rating for pension fixed accordingly."
Claim for increase in this case was re
jected.

Outside Influence Felt in Stock Mar
ket Today,
IMPROVEMENT III ENTIRE LIST
Sugar Recovers Sharply From the
Break of Yesterday.
GENERAL MARKET RErORTS
Special Dispatch to The Evening Star.
NEW YORK. December 0.?The condition
of the trading -on the stock exchange today
was of a much broader character, ami was
quite active. There was a steady continua
tion of the upward movement ail day. and
a more contented feeling was in evidence
amongst th?> large buyers, who have been
taking all the stocks of late. Tnat the real
outsider has been absent from the stock
market there seems to be no doubt, but it
is a certainty that there has been a great
deal of money invested in the bond market
recently, which has caused an unprece
dented state of activity. There **as still
the same activity in this market tod ly,
with a further improvement In all classes.
The commission business was more active
today than usual, and the general opinion
was that outsiders were after stocks.
The opening of the market was quite dull
with figures slightly lower, but London
orders soon commenced to be felt, and
with large orders from commission houses.
Jointly caused an early rally. This early
movement continued throughout the day
with very slight recessions. There was no
particular news in evidence, and no sensa
tional features to the trading.
The disposition of the traders regarding
the Sugar dividend seemed to have cnangei
over night, for at the opening they com
menced to buy the stock and it easily ral
lied two points. It was comparatively quiet
today and fluctuated within this radius.
Manhattan scored the greatest rise of the
active specialties today, advancing from
106 to iU8Vfe. The buying was from a source
that is closely identific 1 with the affairs of
the company. The decision of the appellate
court as regards the legality of the pro
posed underground rapid transit plan is ex
pected every day now. and the general gos
sip is that it will be favorable to the pres
ent systems. Metropolitan was likewise
strong, and after opening up one point it
further advanced.
There was the same marked strength
among the grangers and southern stocks.
Of the latter group. Southern preferred
was the most prominent on continued talk
regarding probability of dividend.
The weakness in Union Pacific was due to
the news from Washington to the effect
that the Senate had passed a resolution for
the postpon ment of the Kansas Pacific
sale, and seeking further information of
the Attorney General.
The foreign exchange market was a shad*
! firmer, witn rates abroad the same. The
demand was fair. The range of prices con
tinued upward to the close, with a slight
slump in Sugar during the last'hour and a
further decline in Union Pacific the excep
tions.

Loi.frlinn<l Popira of Ultrra Kot to lie
Kept In the Treasury.
The Secretary of the Treasury has or
dered heads of buieaus and divisions to
cease the practice of making and keeping
long-liand copies of letters. These officials
are Instructed to make carbon copies of all
typewritten letters, as well as letter-press
copies. These will be kept in the treas
ury and made into books.
The Secretary says that it Is no longer
business-like to follow* the old and honored
process of making copies of letters by hand
for keeping on file. It is out of date, he
says, as the modern typewriter does the
work quicker and better.
The longhand practice was abandoned
by some of the bureaus of the treasury
years ago. but Is still maintained in others
Letters sent out were copied in a book of
records.
The small number of clerks who have
been employed as copyists under the old
system will be continued in the service at
other work.

Disbursing Officer Damellle of the Dis
trict government, in addition to his regu
lar semi-monthly payment of salaried em
ployes. will also pay those who desire It
again the 22d or 23d instant. In order that
they may have funds with which to meet
the holiday demands upon their purses. Ha

will not accept the offer.
