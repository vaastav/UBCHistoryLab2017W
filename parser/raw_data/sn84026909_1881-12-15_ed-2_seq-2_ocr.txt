The President's Message.
The firstMessage of President
Arthur was presented to Congress
t'o 6th. It is very long; so long
that we cannot find space for it,
but wIl attempt to give some of its
main features. After speaking of
the great calamity that befell the
iation in the death of President
-field, he congratulates the coun
try.upon the rare good fortune en
joyed during the year in abundant
harvests, the freedom from the
ragages of disease, and the peaceful
relationa existing between this and
other nations. He devotes a large
space tthe discussion of our diplo
matic and 'consular relations with
other governments, in. which there
is nothing of special interest. In
regard to the finances, he states
that the oidinary revenues from all
sources for the year.ending June
30, 1881F:were $360,782,922.57: the
ordinary expenditures lor the same
periodbeing $260,712,887.59. The
revnttie f6r the.present fiscal year
he estimates at'$400,000,000, and
the -expenditures at $270,00,000.
Herirecomends the reduction of
the reienue'by removing the tax
t6in iaties,' proprietary articles,
bank, cheeks and bank deposits;
but..in view of. the drain made
upon the Treasury from the pay
ment of arrearages of pensions,
he thinks if not advisable at present
to rednee tlhe taxation on liquors
and tobacco, -He coincides with
the reommendation of Gen. Sher
rian -tha'the number of ienlisted
eitth army be increased to
the maximum allowed by law-30,
000. Ee'also reicommends that the
navy and'ouE harbor fortifications
be put in a more efficient condition
so as to pro~vTeigaint any emer
acen The receipts frpm the Post
OBie)epartue'nt for-the past fis
esf yend were $36,785,397.97 ; the
expsnide' $39,251,.736.46. He re
commends that the money order
system he so changed as to reduce
$the fees for-post ofiie money orders,
and to allow sums up to $100 to be
sent tg~ rder, instead of $50, as
no~IIoyedbyair. In regard to
Indian affairs, he says that the plan
formerly-pursued of settling the
-Indians upon -res4rvations remote
from 'ivilization has pr'oved totally
ia~aifctory and disastrous ; and
thali the- plan lately pursued of set
tling-them in the midst of civilized
bomniunifres and thus allowing
Thern"to be 'sbsorbed among the
Whited and 7,o be benefitted by
schools and by the ordinary indus
tries and pursuits of life, is working
well. Thedesident urges earn
estly -upon Congress the duty of
-srressig polygamy. The diffi
cly amounting almost to an im
.posibility, of proving polygamous
mz&riages, be thinks can be obviated
to a great degree by removing the
incompetenfof tif wife to testify
against -the husband; and by re
q uiridg; under heavy penalties, per
sonis performing marriage ceremo
nies in:theTerritories to file certifi
cates ofsuch marriages in the Su
preme Cotruf t1ffTerritory. The
President estirates that it will re
qi~e$2355 00,000 to pay pension
c.1nime d4ti- present year. :He.ad
vocates' thensystem of competitive
examinations in the civil -service
and a fixity6f-tentre, so that per.
-sons applying for appointments
niavte '&rhz?ieas to their fitness,
hatlt pro,motions shall depend upon
merit, and that appointees may feel
secure in their positions so long as
they do the -duty
The sum of $1,000,000 is lying in
ile'ational Treasury that has ac
cumulated from unclaided money
orders. Considering that the money
order syste.mv as,eatablished only
:eighteen years ago,.and that money
cannof(>e sent by post:office order
-oYVer $50, 'the -fact that such an
amonthas gone astray gives some
i4-a of the vast amoiunt of money
that has ben senLJby this method.

TI Stale Grange
Met in Columbia the 6th instant,
the session lasting three days.
James N. Lipscomb. Worthy Mas
ter. delivered his annual address.
which was referred to the appropri
.te conlmittee. A motion was adop
ed that a (.owwittee from the
xrangc confer immediately with
he agricuitural committees of the
Iwo houses on the subject of the
ien law.-- 8tamning committecs I
-verC appointed, and officers made
their reports. A resolution author
zing the Worthy Master to deliver
lectures on the work of the Grange
throughout the State was adopted;
a motion that each Grange be as
sessed )10 to pay his traveling ex
penses was lost; and a motion that
each Grange contribute what it can
for this purpose was adopted. The
committee appointed to enquire
into the feasibility of starting an
agricultural journal reported, re
commending that the Grange give
its support to any newspaper that
would open its columns to the
Grange. A resolution asking aid
from the National Grange for needy
members of the State Grange was
adopted. Columbia was selected as
the next place for the annual meet
ing.
There :, a very general disposi
tion among persons with families
in the country to come to town.
The chief reason is that the free
school system has rendered it al
most impossible to have good pri
-te schools in the country; and
the workings of the free schools is
so fitful and uncertain, and the pay
so small, that it is almost impossi
ble to get good schools in the coun
try. Persons with several children
to educate find it less expensive to
rent --out their farms and live in
town than to send their children to
board ; besides they thus keep their
children under their own eyes and
under the influence of home life and
the family circle, and this is an im
portant consideration.
Some of the opponents of the
lien law seem to think that if there
were no liens there would be no
debts. So intelligent a man as
Mr. Rucker, of Anderson, in a
speech favoring the repeal of the
law gave as one of the reasons why
the law should be repealed that
persons who give liens are com
pelled to plant nearly all their farms
in cotton to enable them to pay
their liens. Suppose they got cred
it on some other basis than a lien
on a mortgage for instance ; or on
no security at all-wouldn't they
have to raise cotton all the same to
pay their debts ?
Washington Newsi.
Postmaster-General Thomas L.
James has resigned.
The President has nominated
Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, of New
Jersey, to be Secretary of State,
cice James G. Blaine. The Senate
confirmed the nomination.
A bill was introduced in the Sen
ate the 12th authorizing the Secre
tary of the Treasury to pay the
necessary and reasonable expenses
incurred in behalf of the late Presi
dent Garfield to the amount of
8100,000.
The Cotton Crop.
The Charleston Exchange has
just made a report based on 54 re
plies from 27 Counties, average
date November 30th. From these
replies the total yield in the State
as compared with last year is esti
mated as follows: Two replies esti
mates the same as last year : three
at i ; fourteen at J: twventy eight
at 4: ten at i.
Three-fourths of the crop has
already been marketed.
The prosecution began last week
to pro.dnce evidence in rebuttal in
the Guiteau case. A number of
physicians testified that they did
not believe the defendant crazy,
but thought he was shamming.
Several persons who had known
Guiteau a long time gave their
opinion, substantiated by facts,
that it was not craziness that was
the matter with him but meanness
anad depravity. It begins to look
decidedly squally for Guiteau.
Superintendent of Education
Thompson makes two excellent
suggestions in his report to the
Legislature. One is that the School
Commissioners be appointed by the
.State Board of Examiners. The
other is that the power of local tax
ation for school purposes be given
to the school districts, with the re
striction that only property holders
be allowed to vote on the question.
A theater at Vienna burned down
the night of the 9th instant during
a performance attended by 2,000
people. The number of lives lost
is reported_at 917 ; most of these
perished by suffocation and by be-.

Legilative---The Lien Law. &c.
The bill to repe-d the Lien Law was
discussed at !ingth in the louse Fri
,iav. Mr. lhauj, argued tha! 0h,
law wa.: n-.eeity a t p'reset lIr.
4ay,o .\ 'bevilk-. spse the r-:pea
of the law ; he e!:iutd zhi.t it had
worked great raod that a time would
co:.e ffr its repeal, but now is nutt thr
tit,: .,r. Allen, of Spartanbura,
spoke on the same side, and said it
woud be a great hardship on the poor
man to repeal the law and thus Ie
prive imi of the only means of credit
be has. Mr. Wilson, of Newberry.
opposed the repeal If the law wer(
repealed many poor white men as well
as blacks would be compelled to worb
for w:t.es. The merchants would not
be hurt by the repeal of the law, and
the farmer wouid not be benefitted
Landlords would give no bL ter termi
for supplies furnished than tnerchants
give. le thought the effort to repea
was un effort to build up the laodlord
at the expense of the merchaut. Hi,
colleague (Mr. Sligh) had said thal
the profits of the Newberry mere-hanti
were from 20 to SO per cent. Thif
was either gross ignorance or gros.
misrepresentatiou. He (Mr S ) bac
said that the days of the Lien Lam
were numbered. The advocates of tb
bill say thar if this Legislature do iou
repeal the law the people will sent
representatives here who will. HI
(Mr. W.) hoped the people would sem
representatives to take cure of theil
interests, and if they chose to repea
the law the responsibility would be oi
them. Mr. Scarbort;ugh was oppose(
to the repeal of the law now on accoul
of the bhort crops. Mr. Dargan, o
Sumter, was opprsed on the saun
grounds. Mr. Rucker, of Anderson
favored the repeal because (1) by put
ting the farmer in the power of thi
aierchaut to whom be had given i
lien it prevented his getting the bene
fit of competition : (2) it cuapelle<
the farmer to raise nearly all cotton t
enable him to pay off the lieu ; (.3
the law induced many to undertak
the runing of farms who were no
capable of doing so successfully. Mr
Murray, of Anderson, opposed th,
repeal. le said that the advocates u
repeal claimed the law was injurin
the poor people of the State, and y(
these poor people were not the one
asking for repeal. The law has eua
bled many a man to w.-rk himself int
the possession of home aud land. Mr
fHemphill. of Chester. favored a repea
now, to take effect at a future time
so did Mr. Verner. of Ueonee. Mr
Hntson. of Hampton, said that so fa
as he could see the only persons whi
would be benefitted by the repeal wer,
the lawyers. Mr. Sligh replied to hi
colleague Mr. Wilson. who har
charged him with gloss ignorance o
misrepresentation He said that hi
(Mr. S.) bad not confined his remark
to the merchants of Newberry; noJ
had he confined his statement of thi
interest charged for advances to an~
one year. He intended his remark:
to cover the whole period of the exist
ence of the law: and he was prepare<
to substantiate what he had said Mr
Racker stated that if the advocates o
the repeal failed in repealiug the law
at once, they would then cffe: an
amendment that the repealing aic
should take effect Oct. 1, 1882. A
vote was then taken on the bill t<
repeal the law immediately, and was
lost by 70 to 37.
A bill to simplify and amend crim
inal pleadings, the principal objeci
being to do away with the long and
tedious method of drawing indictment,
and to substitute therefor simple:
forms, was lost in the House Saturda~
by a vote of 48 to 26.
Mr. Johrstone, of Newberry, Chair
man of the Committee on Wavs and
Means, reported the appropriation bil
Monday ; the total being $095,640.50
In the Senate Monday the bill t<
repeal the Lien Law was indefinitel'
postponed.
Mr. Dlevereux, of Charleston, gavi
notice of a bill to prevent me'rehante
charging lienors more than 7 per cent
over the cash price of the goods sold
on liens.
The General Assembly has accepted
an invitation to visit the Atlanta Ex
position. and the members will go th~
20th inst.aot.
'The bill providing for calling
Constitutional Convention is undeo
consideration, with very little pros
pects of being passed.
The bill to make the Stock Las
extend over the whole State will pass
a few Counties, Colleton, Georgetown
and one er two others in the loV
country, will probably be excepted
with the proviso that they build thi
line fences.
The election bill passed the Setnat<
Tuesday. It provides for S boxes al
