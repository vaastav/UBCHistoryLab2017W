What Do You Mean
I t That conspicuous and ablo Republican
Journal the Commercial Gazette of Cincin
nati avers plainly that Mr CLEVELAND
was fraudulently elected President
i What i the meaning of this assertion
Where and how was tho fraud committed
and what i the proof thereof When such
a charge a this Is made by a newspaper or
a citizen not destitute of sanity the evi
r dence t establish tho fact should b pre
1 sented with It e that tho people may Judge
whether the accusation Is a piece of political
blatherskite or a statement of solid truth
Our Impression Is that In tho present CO
te aston Is political blatherskite but
It the Commercial Gazette show real
t I te Cmcl Gler can any rl
testimony t support Its accusation tho
ii public will listen to It with serious attention
r and not with ridicule

districts either in caucus or at the polls for
f no other reason than that they represented
Impracticable tariff theories extravagant

t Looking Back at the French Election
Now that the Presidential crisis Is over we
e eee that while the French republic has
passed through it safely the French Con
rtltutlon or la other words tho mould In
which free Institutions were provisionally
cast by the Versailles Assembly has in real
ity though not as yet ostensibly been
profoundly modified The WALLON Consti
C tution of 1876 wa it will b remembered
the hybrid product of a compromise between
ten Orleanlsta and Republicans With
the close of 1887 wo fled that nearly every
feature of it intended to propitiate tho mon
ironists and invest them with
arit Ivet tem constitutional
power has been virtually eradicated What
b not been lopped off by revision is lost by
desuetude In spite of n tho balances and
safeguards provided by the organic law
there are in fact at this time but two
ter ar tatt thi tmo active
sod preeminent organs of power in France
thai of the republican majority the Cham
ber of Deputies and that of the radical
masses of tho Paris population The former
K crt the Presidential crisis the latter ex
erclsed a weighty and probably decisive in
fluence on its solution
The abortive attempt made on Saturday
In the Congress by M MICHKLIN t Intro
duce constitutional
duc cntttona amendments abolishing
the Senate and making tho Presidents
tenure of office terminable at the will of the
National Assembly was inopportune If not
supererogatory I was not worth while at
I such a Juncture t waste time In adjusting
I formula t fact when tho fact was unmis
I takable The fate of Marshal lUtJUnox
11 and the fate of M GREW had shown that
the endeavor of tho WALLON Constitution
I t make the President Independent
of the lawmaking organ by elect
r ing him for seven years was a failure
It was clear that without the application of
I mechanical force or in other words a coup
dla executive power like water could
rise no higher than Its source That was
proved as long ago 8 January 1879 when
Marshal MAOMAIION sent in his resigna
tion having discovered that unless he would
govern I accordance with the will of tho
Chamber of Deputies he could not govern at
a thaoumeitrtouetdemcttre was the
alternative Imposed on him by OAUBKITA
or a it has been coarsely paraphrased in
Yankee Idiom Submit or git I
From that hour the provision making tho
President Irremovable for the term of seven
rears was a dead letter So long however
1 M the Senate retained in fact as well as law
the ort powers with which the Or
t leanlata h Intended t endow It the Chief
Maaietrate might mao t net the two
branohoe of the
bnoe te Legislature at loggerheads
t
and thus at all events defer his downfall by
compelling n now Parliamentary election
Thus on Juno 231877 Marshal MAoMAnoK
although the republicans had then about
tho samo majority In the Chamber Dep
uties as they have now was ablo t dissolve
the Intractable Parliament because tho Sen
ate by a majority of 2 assented to tho
measure To this expedient the Marshal
thought of recurring In December of tho
same year and ho would certainly have done
so In January 1870 sooner than resign
had not the Senate by that time become so
preponderantly republican that its sanction
of a dissolution was out of tho question So
too tho other day 1 GHKVY sounded tho
Senate In tho hope that It might rutlf y his
appeal t tho electors Although M tInEWfl I
fidelity t tho republic was not questioned
tho Senate refused because slnco tho trench
nntchangcs Introduced In composition by
constitutional revision It has truly become
what advanced Radicals always accused It of
being a supernumerary an excrescence a
fifth wheel t tho coach It has lost the
sense of Independence and tho courage of Its
opinions It trembles for Its own existence
which I perpetually menaced It bows t tho
supremacy of tho Chamber of Deputies and
meekly registers Its will
But the offacomont of tho Senates co
ordinate authority and tho subordination of
tho executive t tho lower Chamber aro not
tho ouly points In which tho fundamental
alms of tho WALLOX Constitution have been
frustrated The Versailles Assembly essayed
t guarantee Franco against the dreaded
preponderance of Its chief city Neverthe
less since Saturdays election while It Is
patent that henceforward In French politics
there Is no GOD but tho Chamber of Depu
ties It Is equally apparent that Paris Is Its
prophet The people of Paris speaking
through tholr Municipal Council virtually
disfranchised between JOO and 300 members
of the Right In the Congress although they
held their bvlrtuo of the
scat by exactly annie
mandate as their republican colleagues by
that If like M
declaring I even a republican 1m
FERRY should b made President mainly or
largely through reactionary votes he should
b forthwith confronted with a popular p
rising What we witnessed last week In
Paris was In fact a second peremptory sum
mons from tho Sections to tho Convention
and had It not been heeded wo might have
also seen repeated the 13th Venrlfmiaire could
Gen SAUSSIEB have shown himself as ruth
less with his artillery as was Gen BONA
rAHTE But this time the will of tho Par
sians was not dolled
I Is doubtless fortunate for Franco that
owing t tho firm and truculent interposition
of the Paris municipality 11 FKBIIV was
beaten In tho contest for the post of Chief
Magistrate by a man less conspicuous In
deed but of unstained character and whoso
name is a synonymo for unflinching loyalty
to free institutions I Is nevertheless true
that of her written Constitution her funda
mental organic regulations only a remnant
has retained vitality and now that they
will have ample leisure It may behoove
French statesmen to adapt the laws more
closely to tho facts lest all law should lose
Its sanctity
Mr Ijiiinar on Indian Lands
The Secretary of the Interior suggests
very correctly that the ninny millions of
acres coming back to the possession and use
of the Government under tho Indian Allot
ment act may help to quiet apprehensions
created by the rapid diminution of tho pub
lic land area of late years through sales
and grants The truth I that this diminu
tion whero It I mado In accordance with
law and public policy and where It con
tributes to tho progress of civilization and
of productive Industry Is anything but a
evil Tho Government to has regained
from lapsed grants and cancelled entries
during tho two years and seven months
prior t Oct I 1887 no less than 45GG33Di
acres Now comes a new source of acquisi
tion in the severally allotment agreements
t b made with tho Indian tribes
I appears that the Indians with whom
negotiations have already been undertaken
are those of only a very few reserves since
the policy t appeal frt to such as already
welcome the allotment project but tho
agreements with these few provide for the
cession of millions of acres besides the sur
render by certain tribes of claims t large
areas ot territory the quantities and limits of
which are rather Indefinite I can well b
understood that when the work of
undert negotia
tion proceeds to still larger bodies of Indians
nominally occupying larger areas enormous
tracts will eventually b secured t the Gov
ernment for the use of the people as a whole
The entire western part of tho Indian Terri
tory amounting t about 11000000 acres U
likely to be among these acquisitions should
tho seven or eight thousand Indians now
there b transferred to allotted lands In tH
eater portion as tho Indian Office proposes
Secretary LAMAII does not exaggerate In
declaring the general allotment law of Fob
8 1587 t b the most Important measure
ever enacted In this country affecting our
Indian anal I enables every Indian to
become a citizen with a farm of his own
under the full protection of the laws and to
havo a share In a largo tribal annual income
derived from the sale of surplus lands with
a title also for him and Id heirs or his legal
representatives t the eventual distribution
of the principal of tills funded price of the
lands thus sold The Government and the
settlers will also profit by the operations of
the law and tho former will be able t reimburse
imburse Itself for Its purchases of Indian
lands by selling them again The reserva
tions will b brought under civilizing in
fluences and the concentration of the In
dians will b bettor for all

The Boat to Go t England i
The authentic denial published on Sunday
of the story that Gen PAINE would send tho
Volunteer across tho Atlantic next summer
t contest for tho cups won hero by the Ge
nest and now in tho possession of tho Irex
suggests another enterprise for that samo
impose which yachting men would love t
boo undertaken and which would In every
way b moro proper than an expedition by
tho Volunteer
The boot t cross the water t race for
the Geneetas cup is tho Mayflower By the 1
transfer of the yachting superiority from
her t tho Volunteer the Mayflower is free
t engage in contests and to seek new triumphs
umphs whoreversho can best find thorn and
certainly there Is no such promising field
for glory for an American centrnboardor
as English waters Moreover there Is I
no boat which could more properly make the
attempt t win laurels there than the May
flower Not occupying the first place among
our boats there would b little t lose by
testlnghermerltson the other side
ttni merit on te although
we do not make this suggestion with any
thought that It would materially influence
the condiict of her owner But there Is still
another reason for thinking that a Mayflower
victory 1 England would b particularly
pleasing to American yachtsmen Although
though the Volunteers superiority was
not disputed it cannot b main
ma
mined that the champion of 1886 in
her contests with Gen
cntt PAs latest
I
J
I ±
celebrity w accorded a thorough oppor
tunity t test the effect ot her alterations
I was generally understood that the May
flower appeared for the trial races a greatly
improved boat over her previous form but I
in the very first race she met with such an
accident that no sailor would deny that It
loft her crippled and she was beaten by a
quarter an hour Tho regatta committee
doubtless very properly wore satisfied
tho better boat and
that tho Volunteer was btrr bat ali
concluded not t havo another triala con
clusion that was never criticised by Mr Mon
OAK and so the Mayflower failed of chance
to prove conclusively tho value of her now
and painstaking owners Improvements
Such n demonstration would certainly have
been of the greatest Interest t the yachting
public and for that reason we hope that tho
Mayflower may b sent t England during
the season of 1833 She will there have an
opportunity of showing her true form t her I
admirers her and wo have no doubt ot
showing also that she Is a swifter und more
in the British chops
powerful scngoer even to DrOh chop
than the ellmwalstcd cutters which the
English cranks have fondly thought would
sail over tho watery grave of the frt Amen

Must Lie Cant Help It
Tho World printed yesterday a double
leaded despatch stating with circumstan
tiality all tho contents of tho Presidents
message to b delivered today to Congress
This feat had its parallel when the World
hung the Chicago Anarchists two hqurs b
fore tho fact and sold tho harrowing details
for a cent t Its swindled readers There
was this difference however the Anarchists
wore really about t b hanged whereas
President CLEVELAND I not about t de
liver tho message ascribed t him by the
World
What a remorseless and fearful fate it Is
that ordains this eternal lying by the World I
Besides It Is a public nuisance
The TwoCent Postage Stamp
Neither the Hon DON M DICKINSON nor
any other man should b confirmed by tho
Semite as PostmasterGeneral of the United
States unless It is distinctly understood that
he Is pledged t abolish tho present twocent
postage stamp of detestable and disgusting
green and restore the old color which is de
manded by the unanimous voice of the
people and by all sound principles of
aesthetics
Wo wish Mr VIA nothing but good but
if ho goes out of office this week or next
week or some other week without having
first corrected the one colossal mistake of
his administration ho will go out with a
cloud upon his reputation and a heavy load
on his conscience
Let us not b misunderstood This Is a
very Important matter For tho first time
In art the
tho history of American postal nr
department had succeeded In clothing tho
chaste and satisfactory design of the two
cent postage stamp in ink of a color that
answered the requirements of good taste
TITIAN himself would havo approved of it
I was an ideal postage stamp the brown
twocenter and tho hue lent additional
dignity even t the majestic profile of
GEOKQE WAsuraaTOH
Then suddenly without warning without
plausible pretext or reasonable explanation
tho amazing edict Issued from tho General
Post Office which inflicted upon slxtyfho
million Americans the crude pale cold
sickly humiliating green postage stamp of
today I was a unprecedented blow at
taste It like sud
progressive good tt was lke a
den plunge from rosthetlo enlightenment
back into mcdlioval darkness
Perhaps no single small thing exercises
such a profound and perpetual educational
influence upon the artistic sense of the na
tion a the unit stamp of letter postage I
Is under tho oye every day In the year a
dozen perhaps a hundred times a day It is
closely associated with every sentiment and
every emotion known t the human heart
It helps the mighty wheels of commerce to
go around it accompanies the missives of
friendship It convoys the tender protesta
tions of love The green stamp cheapens the
welcome epistle and adds unnecessary pan
t the unpleasant document Give u back
the dull warm Venetian red I Tako away
forever from our sight the odious enormity
the obtrusive offensiveness of this unhealthy
hue which has been severely but not too I
severely described as stowed spinach
mashed against a white marble tombstone
The Democratic party cannot afford to go
Into the Presidential canvass of next year
burdened with tho responsibility of a refusal
t rectify tho most tremendous and far
reaching aesthetic blunder of the ago

WASHINGTON Doe 5Mr James A Jewell
supervising special agent In his annual report
to the Secretary of tim Treasury says thai

post year on account of seizures by tpeclt
ngontd duties and fines and forfeitures On
the subject undervaluations he says
I Notwithstanding the foot that there hag
been Increased vigilance on the partof tho offl
core at the ports generally and especially
the prineinal ports there appears > ery little II t
any decrease in this efforts of foreign rhlpparg
to evade lawful duties upon all classes ot good
subject to high ad valorem rotes There Is lit
tie doubt that the opportunities for evasion
afforded by our high ad valorem duties OB
many articles tends to Induce large Riociilntlv
Importations and thus to swell the reveaui
from customs to time detriment of If Kitlmsti
trade and competing domestic production
The Increase of Importations during the ItM
year Is probably atari duo lu some measure to
time legislation of 1883 as construed by tlm
courts with respect to coverings which uu
afforded n convenient moans of evasion
At the port of New York during the past fla

additions wore made by Importers anti 17803

XllK IOOACCO ZAX
BeaeoB Why tt Khontd be Abolished
To THE EDITOB OP THE SUN Sir Yon
are as I see by your paper strongly In favor of
abolishing the internal novonuc on cigars an4
tobacco as a means ot stopping the further ac
cumulation of a surplus In the Treasury
As the amount annually derived from this In
ternal revenue on cigars and tobacco is about
30000000 the abolition of this tax means that
30000000 which for years havo boon raid to
tho Government which has no earthly need or
use for the money In tho future will remain
among the public and as but lately ne have
boon on lImo vorgo ot a financial panic tho an
nual saving to the public of such a vast sun
u III to n great safeguard against the recurrence
of such u financial crisis
Those are time main reasons why the Internal
revenue on cigars and tobacco should bo abol
ished But there are other reasons besides
The Internal revenue creates and favors mo
no poly
liy its laws and restrictions tt effectually pro >
vents vast numbers of people tram starting la
business on their own account and rompeR
thorn to work for others Instead Thus It chocL1
the development and growth of Industry in
this country Now In these times when tin
laboring ncoplo have shown their dissatisfac
tion the abolition of a law favoring und tend
ing to create a monopoly becomes an Impera
tive necessity
I am a Democrat and I believe that the Bern
ocratlo Administration by abolishing this un
necessary and unjust internal revenue as soon
as practicable will do much toward furthering
the prosperity of the country and ttiiM
strengthen Itself for tim coming Presidential
