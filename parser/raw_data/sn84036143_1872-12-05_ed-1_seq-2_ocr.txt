THCBUUT, OECEMBEB 5, 1878.
TUE 1UMAOE.
To-day we present to our numerous
read«» the President's Message complete.
Special occasions, like the present, require
special effort of a journal which seeks to re
tain its prestige for enterprise and the en
dorsement of the public as being up
to the<tge And generation in which it is pub
lisboA. It -thus happons Abat the p eo p le of
Montarfa, though three thoasand miles dis
tant from the National Capital, are privi
leged quite as soan as most of their brethren
in the great cities of the States to acquaint
themselves with the contents of the Presi
dent's important communication to Congress
on state affairs. H
The document printed this morning is the
fourth annual message of President Grant,
and is a flt terminal paper to his first four
years' eminently successful administration, of
the Government. It is a paper that will boar
careful perusal, and one well calculated to
provoke only words of commendation and
approval from tbe fair-minded and honest of
all parties. Few If any questions of State
importance that would naturally suggest
themselves to public men have been omitted
from proper consideration in the message.
Oar opportunity only enables ns to briefly
outline the document, and a fuller knowledge
of its contents must be gleaned from a read
ing of thé paper itself.
The message opens with thankfulness to
Qod that the nation for the past year has
been blessed with peaoe at home and abroad,
for general prosperity vouchsafed the peo
ple and country. The Geneva and San Juan
Arbitrations are dwelt upon at some length.
The awards favorable to the United States
in each instance are noted, and the labors
of those prominently Identified in bringing
'he differences at issue to a happy termina
tion are extolled. That portion of the Treaty
of Washington relating to the Fisheries is
adequately considered, and the adoption by
Congress of legislation to carry its provisions
into effect is recommended. The Northern
Boundary Line, our European relations,
treaties with the Austro-Hungaiy and Ger
man Empires and with Sweden and Norway,
the Statistical Congress, International Ex
hibition, eta, are concisely[paragrnphed and
tersely treated. Mexico is referred to, its
chronic revolutionary tendencies lamented,
and hopes of a brighter future for our Bister
Republic, ander new govern mesial auspices,
are indulged. Regret at tbe continued dis
orders in Cuba is expressed, and Spain is
censured and held responsible for the la
mentable state of affairs in the Antilles.
"I cannot doubt,"' remarks the President,
"that the continued maintenance of slavery in
Cuba is among the strongest inducements to
'the continuance, of this strife. A terrible
wrong Is the natural cause of a terrible evil."
The settlement of king-pending difficulties
between Spain and the South American Re
publics is gratlfyingly mentioned, and further
disturbances in that quarter will not, it
hoped, occur. With Jupan and China our
good relations are reported unchanged. The
powers and duties relating to the Territories
are thought to belong more properly to the
Department of the Interior than to the De
partment of State, and a change to comport
with this order of things is recommended.
The dizzy array of departmental figures,
embracing Government receipts and expend
itures, concerns the whole nation, and tvill
be carefully scanned. Taxation, and its
great reduction in the past few years, are
spoken of, and further reduction at this time
deemed impracticable. Synoptical abbre
viations of the departmental reports have
been heretofore received and published in
our telegraphic reports, and the message
contains little more information in these
particulars than that which the Herald has
already laid before hs readers.
Our hurried review is made at a late hour
of night, and reference to other portions of
the message is necessarily omitted. Most of
our friends will not fail to peruse the docu
ment itsélf, and their own intelligence will
grasp much that our cursory mention leaves
unsaid.
BAlliROAD HOIK IN CALIFORNIA
During the year about to close, says the
San Francisco Bulletin, the Central Pacific
Railroad Company has laid 250 miles of track
on its two main lines, in the northern and
southern portions of the State. The South
ern Pacific is now operating to Salinas City,
and in a few days twenty-five miles more of
road on this line will be opened, making the
length of the Southern Pacific beyond Sun
Francisco 145 miles. Work is still steadily
prosecuted on the Oregon road, which has
now reached the head of Sacramento valley.
We believe work is also continued on tbe
San Joaquin Valley branch. It Is probable
Chat there will be still more railway track
laid in the State during 1878. The Central,
at course, will push the roads above named
towards completion, and may build the Bantu
branch to Oakland. Work will be under
way os the North Pacific coast road, and on
the narrow-gauge roads projected north and
south of Son Francisco,' and on tho San
. Diego eu i of the Texas Pacifie. These va*
' rious enterprises must have ah important
t Influence in quickening industry, ftaje und
j immigration.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and Jloiue of Iiepreeentativc* ■
CONGRATULATORY.
In transmitting to you my fourth anuual
message, it is with thankfulness to the Giver
of all good that, as a nation, we have been
blessed tor tho last year with peace at home
and abroad, and a general prosperity vouch
safed to but few people. With the excep
tion of the recent devastating fire, which
swept from the earth with a breath, aS It
were, millions of accumulated wealth in the
city of Boston, there have been no overshad
owing calamities within the year to record.
It is gratifying to note how their fellow
citizens of the city of Chicago, under simi
lar circumstances ayear earlier,and the citizens
of Boston are rallying under their misfor
ttmes, Böff fflfe prosperf is that their energy
and perseverance will overcome all obstacles,
and show the same prosperity soon that they
would had no disaster befallen them. Other
wise we have b6en free frem pestilence, war,
and calamities which often overtake nations,
and, as far as human judgment can penetrate
the future, no cause seems to exist to threat
en our present peace. >
THE ORNE VA ARBITRATION.
When Congress adjourned in June last, a
question h^d been raised by Great Britain,
and was then pending, which, for a time,
seriously imperilled the settlement, by friend
ly arbitration, of the differences existing be
tween this Government and that of "Her
Britanie Majesty, by the Treaty of Washing
ton which had been referred to the Tribunal
of Arbitration, which met at Geneva, in
Switzerland. The Arbitrators, however, dis
posed of the question which had jeopardized
the whole of the treaty and threatened to in
volve the two nations in unhappy relations
towards each other, in a manner entirely sat
isfactory to this Government, and in accord
ance with the views and the policy which it
had maintained. The Tribunal, which had
convened in Geneva in December, concluded
its laborious session on the fourteenth day of
September last, on which day, having availed
itself of the discretionary power given to it
by the treaty, to award a sqm in gross, it
made its decision, whereby it awarded the
sum of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity
to be paid by Great Britain to the United
States for the satisfaction or all claims refer
red to its consideration. This decision
happily disposes of a long-standing
difference between tbe two governments, and
in connection with another award made by
the German Emperor, under a reference to
him by the same treaty, leaves the two gov
ernments without a shadow upon the friendly
relations which it is my sincere hope may
forever remain equally unclouded. The re
port of the agent of the United States, ap
pointed to attend the Geneva tribunal, ac
companied by tbe protocols of the proceedings
of the arbitrators, arguments of counsel for
both governments, awards of tbe tribunal,
and tbe opinions given by tbe several arbi
trators, are transmitted herewith. I have
caused to be communicated to the heads of
the three friendly powers who complied with
the joint request made to them under the
treaty, the thanks of this government for the
appointment of arbitrators made by them
respecting it, and also my thanks to the emi
nent personages named by them, and my ap
preciation of the dignity, patience and im
partiality and great ability with which they
discharged their arduous and high functions.
Her Majesty sGovernment lias communicated
to me its appreciation, by her Majesty, of tbe
ability and indefatigable industry displayed
by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on tbe
part of this Government, during the protract
ed inquiries and discussions of the tribunal.
I coidially unite with Her Majesty in this ap
preciation. It is due to the agent of the
United States before the trihunul, to record
my appreciation of the marked ability, un
wearied patience, and the prudence and dis
cretion with which he has conducted the very
responsible and delicate duties committed to
him, as it is also due to the learned and emi
nent counsel who attended the tribunal on
the! part of this Government, to express my
sense of the talents and wisdom which
they brought to bear on tbe argument in
the case, and the result so happily
reached. It will be the province of Con
gress to provide for the distribution among
those who may be entitled to it of their res
pective shares of the money to be paid. Al
though it is not payable until one year from
the (bite of the award, it is deemed advissble
that no time be lost in making a proper ex
amination of tbe several cases in which
indemnification may be duc. I consequently
recommend the creation of a board of com
missioners for that purpose.
THE BAN JÜAN BOUNDARY.
By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty
of Washington, the respective claims of the
United States and of Great Britain in their
construction of the treaty of the 15th of
June, 184«, defining the boundary line be
tween their respective territories, were sub
mitted to tbe arbitration and award of His
Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide
which of the claims is most in accordance
with the true interpretation of the treaty of
1846. His Majesty the Emperor of Ger
many, having been pleased to undertake the
arbitration, has the earnest thanks of this
Government and the people of the United
States toi the labor, pains and care which
he has devoted to the consideration
of this long pending difference. I
have caused an expression of my thanks to
be transmitted to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft,
the representative of tüis Government at
Berlin, conducted the case, and preferred tire
statement on the part of the United States
with the ability that ids past services justified
the public in expecting at his hands. As a
mendier of tire Cabinet at the date of the
treaty which gave rise to the discussion be
tween the Governments, as the Minister to
Great Britain when the construction pro
nounced unfounded was first advanced, and
ag the agent and representative of this Gov
ernment to present the case and to receive
the award, he was associated with the ques
tion in all its phases, and in every stage has
manifested a patriot •c zeal and earnestness in
the maintenance of the claims of the United
States. He is entitled to much credit for the
success which lias attended the submission.
After a patient investigation of the ease and
ot the statement of each party, Jiis Majesty
the Em|ieror of Germany, on the 31st day of
October last, signed bis award In writing, de
creeing that the claim of the Government of
the United States, that the boundary line be
tween the territories of Her Britanie'Majesty,
and the United States should lie drawn thnij
tl»c De Haro channel, is most in accordance
witli the true interpretation of the treaty
concluded on the 16th of June, 184b, between
the agent of Her Britanie Majesty and the
United States. Copies of the case were pre
sented on behalf or each Government, ami of
tbe statement in reply to each, and a trans
lation of the award are transmitted herewith.
This award confirms the United States in
their claim to the important archipelago of
islands lying between the continent and Van
couver's Island, which, for twenty-six years,
ever since the ratification of the treaty, Great
Britain has contested, and leaves us, for the
first time in the history' of the United States,
agnation without a question of disputed
boundary between our Territory qnd the pos
sessions of Great Britain on this continent.
It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the
prompt, spontaneous action of Her Majesty's
Government In giving effect to the award in
anticipation of Boy request from this Gov
ernment. Before the reception of the
award signed by the Emperor Her Majesty
had given instructions fqr| tie removal of
her troops,iwhich'had lieCn stationed inert,
and for the cessation of all exercise or el; '
of jurisdiction, SO as to'teaye the Un
States in conclusive possession of the lately
disputed territory. 1 am gratified to be ablé
to announce that tho orders for the removal
of tue troops have been executed, and the
3r - - - -
litary joint occupation of San Juan has
ceased. The islands are now in exclusive
possession of the United States. It has now
become necessary to complete the survey and
determine that jiortion of the boun
dary line through the Haro channel upou
which the commission which determined the
remaining part of the line were unable to
agree. I recommend the appointment of a
commission to act jointly with one which
may be named by Her Majesty for that pur
pose. The experience of the difficulties at
tending the determination of our admitted
line of boundary after the occupation of the
territory and its settlement by those owing
allegiance to the respective * governments,
points to the importance of establishing, by
national objects or other measurements, the
actual line between the territory acquired by
purchase from Russia and tbe adjoining pos.
sessions of Her Britannic Majesty. The
region is now so sparcely occupied that no
conflicting interests of individuals or of ju
risdiction are likely to interfere to the delay
or embarrassment of tbe actual location of
the line if deferred until the population shall
enter and occupy the territory, but some trivial
contest of neighbors may again array the
two governments in antagonism. I therefore
recommend the appointment of a commis
sion to act jointly with one that may be ap
pointed on the part of Great Britain to de •
termine tbe line between our territory of
Alaska and tbe coterminous poscssions of
Great Britain.
FISHERIES.
In my last annual message I recommended
the legislation necessary on the part of the
United States to bring into operation the arti
cles of the Treaty of Washington of May,
1871, relating to fisheries, and to other mat
ters touching the relations of the United
States towards the British North American
Possessions, to become operative so soon as
the proper legislation should be had on the
part of Great Britain and the Possessions.
That legislation on the part of Great Britain
and its possessions had not then been had,
and during tbe session of Congress a question
was raised which for a time created a doubt
ns to whether any action by Congress in tbe
direction indicated would become impor
tant—a question which has since been dis
posed of, and I have received notice that tbe
Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of
the Provincial Government have passed laws
to carry the provisions of the treaty on the
matters referred to into operation. I there
fore recommend your early adoption of legis
lation in the same direction to carry out on
the part of this government.
NORTHERN BOUNDARY l.TSS.
The Joint Commission for determining the
boundary line between the United States and
the British possessions, between tbe Lake of
the Woods and the Rocky Mountains, has
organized and enteral upon its work. It is
desirable that the force be increased, in order
that the completion of the survey and deter
mination of the boundary line may be sooner
attended to, and to this end I recommend that
a sufficient appropriation be made.
OUR EUROPEAN RELATION'S.
With France, our earliest, and with Russia,
the constant and steady,friends of the United
States; Germany—with whose Government
and people we have so many cases of friend
ship, and so many common sympathies, and
tho other powers of Europe, our relations are
maintained on the most friendly terms.
TREATIES.
Since my last annual message, an exchange
lias been made of ratifications of a treaty
with tbe Austro-IIungary Empire, relating to
naturalization; also, a treaty with the Ger
man Empire, respecting consuls and trade
marks; also, a treaty with Sweedeu and Nor
way, relating to naturalization, all of which
treaties have been duly proclaimed.
STATISTICAL CONGRESS.
Congress, at its last session, having made
an appropriation to defray tho expenses of
commissioners on the part of the United
States to the International Statistical Con
gress, at St. Petersburg, the persons appoint
ed in that character proceeded to their destina
tion, and attended the session of tbe congress.
Their report shall, in due season, be laid be
fore you. This congress meets at intervals
of about three years, and has held its sessions
in several of the countries of Europe. I sub
mit to your consideration tbe propriety of
extending an invitation to the congress to
hold its next meeting in the United States.
TIIE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION,
to be held in 1876, would afford an appro
priate occasion for such a meeting. Prepar
ations are making for
THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION,
to be held during next year at Vienna, on a
scale of very great magnitude. The tendency
of these expositions is in the direction of ad
vanced civilization, the elevation of industry
and labor and the increase of human happi
ness, as well as of greater Intercourse and
good will between nations. This exposition
is to be tbe first which will have been held in
Eastern Europe, and it is lielieved that Amer
ican inventors and manufacturers will be
reaily to avail themselves of this opportunity
for the presentation of their productions if
encouraged by proper aid and protection. At
the last session of Congress authority was
çiven for the appointment of one or more
eu
' agents to represent this Government at the
Exposition. The authority thus given has
been exercised, but in the absence of any np
priation, there is danger that the important
benefits which the exposition offers will, in a
large degree, be lost to the citizens of the
United States. I commend the subject strong
ly to your consideration, and recommend
that an adequate appropriation be made for
thut purpose. To further aid American ex
hibitors fit the Vienna Exposition, I would
recommend, in additlontb an' Appropriation
of money, that the Secretary of the Navy be
authorized to fit up two naval vessels te trans
port, between our Atlantic eitles and TriesW,

MEXICO.
Since your last session the President of
the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his
high character and by his services to his
country, has died. His temporary successor
has now' been elected with great unanimity
by the people, a proof of confidence on their
"irt in his patriotism, and which it is be
eved will t.e confirmed by the results of his
administration. It is particularly desirable
that nothing should be left undone by tbe
government of either Republic to strengthen
their relations as neighbors and friends. It is
much to be regretted that many lawless acts
continue to disturb the quiet of the settle
ments on the border between our territory
and that of Mexicofand that complaint» of
wrong to American citizens in i various parts
of the country are made. The revolutionary
conduct in which <our neighboring Republic
has so long been Involved has in some degree
contributed to this disturbance. It 14 to be
hoped that with a more settled rule of order
through the Republic, which may be expected
from "the present government, the acts of
which just complaint is made will cease. The
proceedings of tho Commission under, the
convention with Mexico of the 4th of July,
1868, on the subject of claims, have unfortu
nately been checked by an obstacle, for the
removal of which measures have been taken
by the two governments which it is believed
will prove successful. Tbe Commissioner
appointed pursuant to joint resolutions of
Congress of the 7th of May last to inquire
into the depredations on the Texas frontier,
have dilligently made investigations into that
subject. l'heur report upon the subject will
be communicated to you. Their researches
were necessarily incomplete, partly on ac
count of tho limited appropriation made by
Congress. Mexico, on the part of that gov
ernment, lias nppointeil a similar Commis
sion to investigate these outrages. It is not
announced officially, but the press of that
country state that the fullest investigation is
desired, and that the co-operation of all par
ties concerned is invited to secure that end,
I therefore recommend that a special appro
priation be made at the earliest day prac
ticable, to enable the Commissioners on tho
part of the United States to return to their
labors without delay.
CUBA.
It is with regret that I liaye again to an
nounce the continuance of the disturbed con
dition of tbe island of Cuba. No 1 advance
towards the pacification of tbe discontented
portion of the population has been made,
while the insurrection has gained no advan
tages and exhibits no more of the elements
of power or of the prospect of ultimate suc
cess that were exhibited a year ago. Spain,
on the other hand, ha9 not succeeded in its re
pression, and the parties stand apparently in
the same relative attitude which they have
occupied for a long time past. This contest
lias lasted now for more than fonryenrs.
Were it seen at a distance from our neigh
borhood we might be indifferent to its result,
although humanity could not be unmoved by
many of its incidents wherever they might
occur. It is, however, at our own door. I
cannot doubt that the continued maintenance
of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest
inducements to the continuance of this strife,
A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a
terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and
the introduction of other reforms in the ad
ministration of the government of Cuba
could not but advance the restoration of
peace and order. It is especially to be hoped
that the present liberal government of Spain
will voluntarily adopt this view. The law
of emancipation, which was passed more
than two years since, lias remained Unexe
cuted in absence of regulations for its en
forcement, It was but a feeble step toward
emancipation, but it was a recognition of tbe
right, and was hailed as such and exhibited
Spain in harmony with the sentiments of
humanity, of justice and sympathy with the
other powers of the Christian and civilized
world. Within the past few weeks regula
tions for carrying out the laws of emancipa
tion have been announced, giving evidence
of the sincerity of intention, at present, to
carry into effect the law of 1870. I have
not failed to urge the consideration of the
wisdom of the policy, and the justice of a
more effective system for the abolition of the
great evil which oppresses a race and con
tinues a bloody ancl destructive conflict close
to our border, as well as the expediency and
justice of conceding reforms of which the
propriety is not questioned. Deeply im
pressed with the conviction that the contin
uance of slavery is one of the most active
causes of the continuance of the unhappy
condition of Cuba, I regret to believe tiiat
citizens of the United States, or those claim
ing to be such, are large holders in Cuba of
what is there claimed as property, but which
is forbidden and denounced by tbe laws of
the United States. They are thus, in defiance
of tho spirit of our own laws, contributing
to tbe continuance of this distressing and
sickening contest. In my last annual mes
sage I referred to this subject, and I again
recommend such legislation as may be pro
per to denounce, if not prevent and discour
age, American citizens from holding or deal
ing in slaves.
SPAIN AND TIIE ALLIED REPUBLICS.
It is gratifying to announce that the ratifi
cation of a convention was concluded under
the auspices of this government, between
Spain on the one part and the allied Republics
of the Pacific on the other, providing for an
armistice, has been exchanged. A copy of
the instrument is herewith submitted. It is
hoped this may be followed by a permanent
peace between tbe same parties. The differ
ences which ut one time threatened the main
tenance of peace between Brazil and the
Argentine Republic, it is hoped are in a way
to be satisfactorily adjusted. With these
states, as with the Republics of Central and
South America, we continue to maintain the
most friendly relations. It is with regret,
however, 1 announce that the Government of
Venezuela has made no further payment on
account of the awards under the convention
of the 25th April, 1866. That Republic is un
derstood to be now almost, if not quite, ttnn
quilized, and it is hoped, therefore, that it
will lose no time in providing for the unpaid
balance of its debt to the United States,
which, having originated in injuries to Its
citizens by Venezuela authorities, and hav
ing lieen acknowledged by a treaty in the
most solemn form known among nations, it
would seem to deserve a preference Vtver
debts of a different origin and contracted in
a different manner. This subject is again
recommended to Congress for snob action as
may lie deemed proper,
•JAPAN AND CHINA.
*Our treaty relations with Japan remain un
changed. An imposing embassy from that
interesting and progressive nation, visited
this country during tho year that is passing,
but being unprovided with powers for'thi:
signiug of a convention in this country, no
conclusion in that direction was reached. It
is to be hoped, however, that the interchange
of opinion which took place during their
stay in this country has led to a mutual ap
preciattyn of the interests which may be ac
cepted when the revision of the existing trea
ty shall be undertaken. In this connection, I
renew my recommendation of a year ago,
that to give importance arid to add to the
efficiency of our diplomatic relations 'with
Japan and China, and to further aid in main
taining the good opinion of these peoples, and
to secure to ns our share of tin* commerce des
tined to flow between these nations npd the
balance of the commercial world, an appro;
priation should be maife to support at' least
iopr Amctiwm youths in each oi these coun
tries, to serve as a part of the official family
oFdur Minister*; 6wr ienreséfitntin*». wotflit
not even then he placed upon an equality
witli the representatives of Great Britain and
some other powers. As now situated, our
representatives in Japan and China have to
depend for interpretations and translations
upon the natives of those countries, who
know our language imperfectly, or procure
for the occasion the services of employes in
foreign business houses, or' the interpreters
to other foreign ministers.
THE TERRITORIES SHOULD BE UNDER T11K DE
PARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.
% I renew the recommendation made on a pre
vious occasion, for the transfer to the De
partment of the Interior, to which they seem
more appropriately to belong, of all the pow
ers aiid duties in relation to the territories,
with which the Department of Siate is now
charged, either by law or by custom.
BELIEF OF CITBSSNS ABROAD.
Congress, from the beginning of the Gov
ment, has wisely made provision for the re
lief of distressed seamen in foreign countries,
but no similar provision, however, has hither
to been made for the relief of citizens in dis
tress abroad, other than seamen. It iB
customary with other Governments to
authorize their consuls to extend such relief
to their citizens or subjects in certain cases.
A similar authority, and an appropriation to
carry it into effect, is recommended in tho
case of citizens of the United States, destitute
or sick. Under such circumstances it is well
known that such citizens report to foreign
countries in great numbers, though most of
them «re able to bear the expenses incident
to the location, there arc some who, through
accident or otherwise, have become penniless,
anil have no friends at home able to succor
them. Persons in this situation must either
perish, cast themselves upon the charity of
foreigners, or be relieved at tbe private
charge of our own officers, who usually, even
with the most benevolent, dispositions, have
nothing to spare for such purnoses. »Should
the authority and appropriation asked for bo
granted, care will be taken to carry the be
neficence of Congress into effect, so thut it
shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily be
stowed.
