PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
To tti flwiiK und llnuar of J;fir, ..,, :
In transmitting to you my fourth animal
rursaje, it in witL thankfulness tu the Giver
of all good, that as a uatiou we have be u
blessed for the last year with peace at home
and abroad, am' general prosperity vouch
safed to but few eople. With the exception
of the recent devastating tire which swept
from earth wiCi a breath, an it were, milium
of ai .mui iUti ! wealth in the city of Boston,
t her ha l o u do overshadowing calamities
within the year to record. It ia (ratifying
to unto how liUe thoir fellow citizens of
the city of Chicago, under similar circum-t-tauoea,
a year earlier, the citizens of Uoaton
ate rallying m4k their miMfortuuea, and the
prospect la that their energy aud persever
ance will overcome all obataclaa, and show
tue aame pros-ierity MM that they would
hare have bail bad no disaster befallen them.
Otherwiae, wo have been free from pesti
lence, war, and the calamities which often
overtake nation. And, aa far a human judg
ment can penetrate the future, no cause
sertu to exiat to threaten our present peace.
When Congress adjoin ned in June laat, a
question had leen raiaed by Great Britain,
and MM then peutluu", which for a time se
riously imperilled the settlement by friendly
arbitration of the difference exiating be
twecii this Government and that of her
Britannic Majeaty, which, by the Treaty of
Washington, hail been referred to tbe'tr
buual of arliitration which had met at Geueva,
in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however!
disposed of the quetiou which bad jeopard
ized the whole of the treaty, and threatened
to involve the two nation in moat unhappy
relations toward each other, in a manner en
tirely satisfactory to thia Government and in
accordance with the viewa aud the policy
which it had maintained. The tnnunal which
hid cenvened in Geneva, in December, con
cluded its laborious seasion on the 14th day
of September laat. on which day, having
availed itaeif of the discretionary power given
to it by the treaty to award a üm in gross, it
made its dcos :on whereby it awarded the
um or wto.ulKi.OuO in gold, aa the indemnttv
to be paid by Great Britain to the luited
4itesfoi tin satisfaction of all the claims
referred to :ts consideration. This decision
happily, dispoaea of along standing difference
I fwecn two (icverrinieiits, and in connection
with another award wade by the German Em
peror under a reference to 'him by the same
treaty, leaves the two Government without
a shadow upon the fneudlv relationa win. h it
I my sincere hope may fortver lemain
remain equally unclouded. '
The report' of the agent of the United
States, appointed to attend the Geneva tri
bunal, accompanied by the protocols of the
proceeding of the arbitrators, the aiguments
of the counsel of both Governmeuta. the
award of the tribunal, and the opinions given
by the several arbitrators, ia tianamittcd here
wr.li I .have caused to 1 transmuted to the
liea la of the rhree fneudlv poser who com
plied with the joint request made to them
under the treaty the thank of thia Govern
ment for tLe appointment of arbitrators made
by them respectively, and also my thank to
the eminent pcrx-nages named bv them, and
my appreciation of the dignity, patience, jm
pa.tialitv, and great ability with which they
Iii barged their anJtHI and high functioua.
Her Majesty's Goveitimeut has communi
cated lo me the appreciation by her Majesty
of the ability arid indefatigable industry dis
played by Hf. Adams, the arbitrator named
öl, the part d tin Government, during the
protracted inquiries ai.d dictissions of the
tribunal. I cordially unite with bei Majestv
in tin arnreciatioii
It is due to the agent of the United State
l-e:oro the tiiS mil. tn record my appreciation
cf the marl.cd alulity, unwearied pitien p.
.md tiie prudence anil discretion with which
lie hat cond i ted the ran retoiiilln
delicate duties committed to him. And
i: is alao due to the learned and eminent
' Hinsel who attended the tribunal on the part
of tins Government, tn express my sense of
the talent and wisdom which they brought to
'year in the ligament of the 1011 It so happily
reached. It wi! lie the province of Congress
t j provide foi tb" distribution, among those
WIM are entitled to it. of thtir resjiective
shares of the money to 1 paid.
Although ÜM sum awarded is not parable
Until tue y, ar Horn tue MM of tiie award.it
is deemed advisable that no time be lost in
uialung a pi' er examination of the several
i es in whi.-li ii.demnnicatioii may he due. I
consequently tec. turnend the creation of a
Boiiidof Commissioners for the pnrjose. By
the thirty-fourth aniclo of the Treaty of
Washington tins respective claima of ' tbe
United States and of Great Britaiu in their
construction of the treaty of the 15th June,
UM, detiuiug the boundary line between their
respective territories, were submitted to the
arbitration aid award of bis Majeaty the Em
e:.n of Germany, to decide which of these
claima ia m. - in accordance with the true in
terpretation of the treaty of 1846. Hia Ma
jetv the Imperor of Germany having been
pieaaed to undertake the arbitration haa the
earnest thank- of this Government and of the
United States for the lalwr. paina and care
which he has devoted to the consideration of
this long-pf i. ding difference. I have caused
au expression ot my thanks to ha communi
cated to his Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the
representative of this Government at IWhn.
conducted the case and prepared the state
ment on the part of the United States with
tbo alulity that hü past service jntitied the
public in expecting at bis bands. Aa a mem
ber of Cabinet at the date of treaty which haa
Siren rise to the discussion letwecn the Gov
ernmeuta : as the Minister to Great Britain
when the MMtflMttM now pronounced un
founded ws- llrst advaticcd, and as the agent
and representative of the Government to
present the case and receive the award, he
has been assoc. a od with the queation in all of
its phases, and in every stage haa manifested
a pat riot I.- zeal aud earnestness in mainten
ance of the claim of the United States. He
is entitled to much credit for the success
hieb has attended the submission. After a
patient investigation of tbe case and of the
statements of each party, hia Majeaty the
Kmperor of Germany, ou the 21st day of Ort o
I '-r last, signed hia award in writing, decree
ing that the claim of the Government of the
United States that the botindarr line betweea
the territories of her Bntanmc Majesty and
the United States should be drawn through
the Haro Channel, is most in accordance with
the true interpretation of the treaty conclude 1
M the 15th of Juue. 1846. between the agenv
of her Britannic Majesty and of the United
Sites. Copies of the caae presented on be
half of each Government and of the state
ment in reply tag each, and a translation of
tin award, are transmitted herewith. Thia
award conurms tbs United State in their
claim to the important archipelago of islands
lying between the continent and Vancouver's
Island, which for twenty-eix years, ever since
the ratification of the treaty. Great Britain
lias contested, and leaves us, for the first
time in tbe history of the United States aa a
nation, without a queation of disputed bound
ary between our territory and the possessions
of Great Britain n the continent.
It is mv grateful duty to acknowledge tbe
prompt, sponi.no 'us action of her Majesty's
Government in giving effect to the award. In
anticipation of any request from ttua Govern
ment, and before the reception in the United
States of theaward signed by tbe Kmperor.
lier Majesty bad given instructions for the
removal of her tro ps, which had been sta
tioned there, and for the cessation of all ex
ercise or claim of Jurisdiction, so as to leave
the United States in exclusive possession of
the lately disputed territory. I am grateful
to be able to announce that the orders for
the removal of the troops have been exe
cuted, and the military Jomt occupation of
an Juan lias ceased. Tbe iaianda are now in
tbe exclusive poaaaaaion of the Unite I Statea.
It now become neceeaavry to complete the
survey aud determination of that ortion of
tue boundary hue through the Ilaro channel,
upon which the Commission which deter
mine 1 the remaining part of tbe Im were i na
ble to agree.
I recommend tbe appointment of a Com
mission to act jointly with one which mar I
named by her Majeaty for that purpose. Ex
perience of be uifbciiltiea atteudiug tbe de
termination of our admit ted hue of boundary,
after the occupation of tbe tern t err and ita
settlement by thawe owing allegiance to tbe
reapectire Government, point to the im
portance of establishing, by natural object
or other monuments, the actual hue between
the territory acquired bv purchase from Bua
sia, and tiie adjoining poaaeaaioua of her
Britannic Majeaty. Tue region ia now ho
sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests
of indiMilualrt, or of jiiriediction, are likely
to interfere to the delay or embarrasament of
the actual location of tbe line. If deferred
uutil po ulation ball enter aud occupy the
territory, aotue trivial oonteat of ueighbora
mar again array tbe two Governmeuta in an
tagonism. I therefore recommend the ap
pointment of acommiaaiou to act jointly with
one that may be appoiuted ou the nart of
Great Britain, to determine the line between
our Territory of Alaska and the co-termino ua
possessions ut Great Britain.
Iu my last annual message I recommended
the legislation neceaaary on the part of the
L int. (I State- to brinir into operation tbe ir-
aooner attended to. To this end I recommend
that a sufficient anpronrialion be made.
With France, our earliest allv j Buaaia. tbe
constant aud steadv friend of iba thai.
ted Slates i Germanv. with whose Govern
ment and peeple we have aa many causes of
friendship, and so nianv common svmoathie
aud tbe other power of Europe, oiir relations
are maintained on the moet fneudlv terms.
Since my last annual meattage tbe exchange
haa btu made of tbe ratification of a treatv
with tbe Aiistro-Hunirarv Empire, relatim; to
naturalization ; also of a treaty witii the Ger
man bmpire. respecting Consuls and trade
marks ; alao of a treaty with Sweden and Nor
way, relating to naturalization . all of which
treaties hive been duly proclaimed.
Cougreee. at ita laat session, having made
an appropriation to defrav tbe expenses of
ommi-. oners on the part of tbe United
f cial
lly to be h.UMid that tbe :.re-..'i' lii.t.til
Govenimeut of Spain will voluntarily adopt
thia view. The law of emancipation, which
wae pasted more than two years aioce. haa re
mained unexecuted in the abaeuee of regula
tion for its enforcement. It wae but a feeble
step toward emancipation, but it was the
lecoguitiou of right, and vaa hailed aa auch,
and hibited Spam in harmony with tbe a n ti
nier, ts of humaaity and of juetica, and in sym
pathy with tbe other poarers of the Cbiistian
aud civilised world. Within the past few weeks
tbe regulations for carrying out tbe laws of
emancipation have beeu announced, giving
evidence of the sincerity of the intention of
the present Government to carry into effect
the law of 1170. I have not faded to urge
the consideration of the wisdom, the policy,
and tbe justice of a more effective ayatem for
tbe abolition of the great evil which has op
pi eased a race and continues a bloody and de
structive contest cioae to our border, aa well
aa the expediency and the justice of conced
ticles of the Treaty of Washington, of May,
1871, relating to the fiaheriea, and to other
mattera touching the relations of tbe United
Htatea toward tbe British North American pos
session, to become operative aa soon aa tbe
proper legialation should be bad on the part
of Great Britaiu aud the possesions. That
legialation ou the part of Great Britain and
ita possesions hau not then been had, and
during the session of Congress a question waa
raise., wnicti tor the time laiaed a doubt
whether anv action by Congress in the direc
tion indicated would become important a
queation which baa since been disnoaed of.
aud I have received notice that tbe Imperial
Parliament and tbe Legislature of the Pro
vincial Government nave passed lawa to carry
tbe provisions of the treaty on tbe matter's
referred to into operation. I therefore
recommend your early adoption of the legis
lation in the aame direction necessary on the
part of thia Government.
The Joint Commisaion for determining the
boundary line between the United States and
tbe Uhtish jssesaiona, between the Lake of
the Woeds and the Kocky mountains, has or
ganized and entered upon ita work. It is de
sirable that tbe force be increased, iu order
that the completion of the survey and tbe de
termination of the boundary line may be
'ng reforms of which the propriety is uot
questioned. Deeply impressed with "the con
viction that the continuance of slavery ia one of
the most active causes of tbe continuance of

tion of taxation by tbe acts of Congress at its
last sesaion. the expenditure of the Govern
ment iu collecting the revenue will be much
reduced for the next fiscal year. It is verv
doubtful, however, whether "anv further re
duction of so vexatious a burden on anv peo
ple will be practicable for tbe present. "At all

woutd recommend that no more legislation be
had on the subject unless it be to correct er
rors of omisaiuu or commission in tbo present
lawa, until sufficient time has elapsed to
prove that it can be done and still have suffi
cient revenue to meet the current expense of
the Government, pay interest on the public

Detailed statements of the disbursements

though these bare been somewhat inei eased
by tbo recent acts of Congress to enforce the
rights ef citizens of the United States to vote
in tbe several Hutes of the Union and to
force the provisions of tbe Fourteenth Amend
ment to the Constitution of the United States
and the amendment thereto. I cannot quea

regret to say, have associated tbemselvea
together in some localities to deprive ct'.er
citizens of the right guianteed them bv tbe
Constitution of the United States, and M that
end they have committed deeds of violence,
but tbe prevention and puniabment of manv
of these persona have tended greatly to the
repression of such diaordera. I do not doubt
that a grat majority of tbe people of ail

of about three years, and hae held its sessions
in teveral of the countries of Europe. I sub
mit to your consideration the propriety of ex
tending an invitation to tbo Congress'to bold
its next meeting tu the United States. The
centennial celebration, to be held in 1876,
wonld afford au appropriate occasion for such
a meeting.
Preparation are making for tbe Interna
tional Exposition, to be held during tbe next
year iu .eiina, on a scale ot verv great rati;-
laimed as Dronertv
but which is forbidden and denounced bv the
laws of the Luited States. They are 'bus. in
defiance of the spirit of our laws! contributing
to the continuance of this distressing and
sickening contest. In my last annual message
I referred to this subject, and I again recom
mend snch 'egislation as may be proper to de
nounce, and, if not prevent, at least to dis
courage American citizona from holding or
dealing in slave.
It is gratifying to announce that the rati
fication of the convention concluded under tbe
auspices of this Government, between Spain
on the one hand and the Allied Republics of
tiie Pacific on tbe other, providing for an
uitude. Tbe tendency of tbee exnositiona is i armistice, have been exchanged. A codv of
in the direction of advanced civilization aud ,ne instniroent is herewith submitted, it is
the elevation of industry, of labor, aud the in- Impel that thia may be followed by a perm a -
crease of human happiness, aa well aa of
greatei intercom-.- aud good-will betweeu na

which will have been held in Eastern Euro;,
it is bebeved that American inventors aud

The differences which at one time threat
ened the maintenance of peace between
RrazU and the Argentine Republic, it is
hoped, are in the way of satisfactory adjust
ment with these States, as with the Bepuldics
of Central and Southern America we continue
to maintain the most friendly relations. It is
with regret, however. I announce that the
Governor of Venezuela has made no fun her
ayments on account of the awards under the
t'onvention of the 25th of Apnl. 1835. That
Repnblic ia understood to be now almot. it
not quite, traiiuuiUzed. It is hoped, there
fore, that it will lose no time in providing for
the unpaid balances of its debt to the United
States, which having originated in injuries to
its citizens by the Venezuelan authorities, and
having been acknowledged pursuant to a
treaty in the most solemn form known among
aa soon aa practicable, having due regard for
tbe interests of the debtor class and the
vicissitudes of trade and commerce, and con
vertible into gold at par.

The attention of Congresa will be called
dnring its present session to various enter
prises for the more certain and cheaper trans
portation of the constantly increasing surplus
of the Western and Southern products to the
Atlantic seaboard. The subject is one that
will force itself upon tbe legislative branch
of the Government sooner or later, and I sug
gest, therefore, that immediate steps lie taken
- l -it a a a . m . . " .
to Rain au avauaoie information to insure
equitable and just legislation. The route to
connect the Sliasissippi Valley with the Atlan
tic, at Charleston, S. C. and Savaunah. Ga.,

tion to the Savannah aud Ocmulgee rivers,

complished engineer of the army. "Second
and third new routes will be proposed for fie
consideration of Congress, namely, by an ex
tension of the Kanawha and James river canal
to the Ohio, aud by extension of the Chesa
peake and Ohio canal. I am not prepared to I ,im

ment to protect citizens from the lawless do
mge of such combinations. Applications have
been made to me to pardon persons convicted
of a violation of said acts upon the ground
that clemency in such cases would tend to
tranquillize the public mind, and to test the
virtue of that policy I am disposed, so far as
my sense of justice will permit, to give to
these applications a favorable consideration,
but any action thareou is not to be construed
as indicating any change in mv determination
to enforce with vigor such act so long as the
conspiracies and combinations therein named
disturb the eace of the country. It is much
to be regretted, and is regretted bv no one
more than mvself. that a til-c -s-irv his vpr
existed to execute the mforcement act. N"o

of applying it may never again be demanded.'
The Secretary of tbe Interior reports satis

Since your last session, tbe President of tbe
Mexican Republic, (bstintusbed bv his high
character aud by hia services to his country,
has died. His temporary aucceaaor has uow
been elected with great unanmity by tb peo
pele a proof of confidence on their part in
bis patriotism and wisdom, which, it is be
lieved, will be confirmed by the resulta of his
administration.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should be left undone by tbe Government of
either Republic to strengthen their relatiiuns
a ueigbbors and friends. It is much to be
regretted that manv lawless act continue to

neatly recommended to tbo attention of Con
gress for such action as may be deemed
proper.
Our treatv relations with Japan remain un
changed. An imposing embassy from that
interesting and progressive nation visited thin
country dnrint; the year that is passing, but
leing unprovided with power for the signing
of a convention in this country, no conclusion
in that direction was reached. It is hoped,
however, that the interchange of opinions
which took place during their stay in this
country had led to a mutual appreciation of
the interests which may be promoted when
tbe revision of the existing t-eaty shall be
undertaken.
In thia connection I renew my recommenda
tion of one year ago. that to give importance
anu to add to ttir emciencv cf onr diplomati
disturb the quiet of the sertiementa on tbe ! relations with Japan and China, and to further
liordcr between onr territory and that of ! IM ln maintaining the good opinion of these
Mexico, aud tbat complaints or wrong to
American citizens in various p-rtsof thecoun
trp arc made. Tbe revolutionary condition in
which tbe neighboring Republic' baa so long
been involved has, in soma degree, contribu
ted to tin disturbance. It ia to be hoped
that with a more settled rule of order throngh
out the Republic, which nuy be expected f r. .tn
the prescut Government, tbe acta of which
just comolaiut is made will cease.
Tbe proceedings of tbe Commission under
the convention with Mexico of the 4th of July,
1868. on the subject of claims, have unfortu
nately l e.-u checked by an obstacle, for the
removal of which roea tires have been taken
by the two Governments which, it is believed,
will prove successful. The Commissi oners ap
pointed pursnmt to the joint resolution of
Congress of the 7th of May last, to impure
into depredations on too Texaa frontier, nave
diligently made investigations in that quar
ter. Their report upon tbe aabject will be
communicated to you. Their researches were
necessarily incomplete, partly on account of
tbe limited appropriation made by Congress.
Mexico, on the part of tbat Government, has
appointed a similar Commission to investigate
these outrages. It is not announced officially,
but the press of that country states that the
fullest investigation is desired, and that the
co-operation of all parties concerned is invited
to secure that end. I therefore recommend
that a special appropriation be made, at the
earliest day practicable, to enable tbe Com
missioners on tbe part of tbe United Statea to
return to their labors without dely.
It is with regret that I have again to an
nounce a continuance of tbe disturbed condi
tion of tbe Island of Cuba. No advance to
ward the pacification of the discontented por
tion of the population haa been made, while
tbe insurrection has sained no advantages,
and exhibits no more of tbe;e!eraente of power
or of the prospect of ultimate success than
were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the
otber hand, has not' succeeded in repression,
and the parties etand apparently in the same
relative attitude which they have occupied for
a long time past. This contest has lasted now
for more than four years. Were it seen at a
distance from our neighborhood we might be
indifferent to its result, although humanity
could nor be unmoved by many of ita inci
dents whenever they might occur. It h, how
ever, at onr door. I cannot doubt tbat the
continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is
among tbe strongest inducements to the con
tinuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is tne
natural cause of a terriblo evil. The als . litem
of slavery and the introduction of other rc
forma in the administration of the Govern
ment in Cuba could not fail to advance th
restoration of peace and order. It ia ee-
people. and secure to the United States its
share of tbe commerce destined to flow be
tween these nations and the balance of the
commercial world, an appropriation be made
to support at least four American youths in
each of these countries, to servo as 'a part of
the official family of onr Miuistrv there. Our
representatives would not even then le placed
upon an equality with tbe representatives of
Great Britain or some other powers. As now
situated, our representatives in Japan and
China have to depend for interpreters and
translators ut on natives of those countries
who know our Unguage imperfectly, or pro
cure for the occasion the services of employes
in foreign business houses, or the interpreters
to otber foreign Ministers.
I renew the recommendation made on a
previous occasion of tue transfer to the De
partment of the Interior, to which they seem
more appropriately to belong, of all the
powers and duties iu relation to tbe terri
tories with which the Department of State is
now charged by law or by custom.
Congress, from tbe beginning of the Gov
ernment, has wisely made provision for the
relief of distressed seamen in foreign coun
tries. No similar provision, however, haa
hitherto lieen made for the relief of citizens
in distress abroad otber than seamen. It ia
understood to be customary with other Gov
ernments to authorize Consuls to extend such
relief to tbeir citizens or subjects in cettain
cases. A similar authority and an appropria
tion to carry.it into eff et are commended in
cases of citizens of the United States sick,
under such circumstances. It ia well known
tbat mich citizons report to foreign countries
in great numbers ; though moat of tbem are
able to bear tbe expenses incidental to loco
motion, there are some who, through accident
or otherwise, become penniless, and have no
fnends at home able to succor them. Per
sons in this situation must either perish, cast
themselvea up n the charity of foreigners, or
be relieved at the private charge of onr
officers, wbo, usually, even with the most
benevolent disposition, have nothing to spare
for su.di purpose Should the authority and
the appropriation asked for be given, care
will be taken to cairy the beneficence of Con
gress into effect, that it shall not lie nn
necessarily or unworthily besrowod.

I monstrated by past experience. That the un
precedented growth in population and pro
due's of the whole country will require ad-
ditional facilities and cheaper means for the
I more bnlky articles of commerce to reach tiie
I tide water and a market will be demanded in
the near future is equally demonstrable. I
would therefore suggest either a committee
or commisioner be authorized to consider this
! whole question, and to report to Congress at
some future day for its better gnidance in
I legislating on the important subject. Tbe
, railroads of the country have been rapnllv ex
tended dnring tbe last few yeais to meet tbe
growing demands of producer, and reflect
much credit upon the capitalists sad mana
ger engaged in tbeir construction. In addition
to these, a project to facilitate commerco by
the building of a ship canal around Niigara
Falls on the United States side, which
has been agitated for manv years, will no
doubt be called to your attention this session.
Looking to the great future of the conntrv and
the increasing demands of commerce, it might
lie well, while on this subject, not onlv to
have examined and reported upon, the various
practicable routes for connecting tbe HaMM
sippi with tide water, bnt tbe feasibility of an
almost continuous land locked navigation from
Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Such a route
along our coast would be of great value at all
times, ana of inestimable value in cace of a
foreign war. Nature has provided the greater
parr or tins route, ana tbe obstacles to be
overcome are easily within the skill of the
engineer. I have not alluded to this subject
with the view of having any further expendi
ture of public money, at this time, than may
be necessary to procure aud p'aco ell the
necessary information before Congress in an
authentic form to enable it hereafier. if deem
ed practicable and worthy, to legislate on the
subject without delay.
It is evident unless steps are taken to
preserve our navy, that in a very few years
the United States will be the weakest nation
upon the ocean of all the groat Dowers. With
an energetic, progressive, business people
like ours, penetrating and forming business
relations with every part of the known world,
a navy strong enough to command the re
spect of our flac abroad is necessary for the
full protection of their rights. I recommend
careful const le ration by Congress of the
recommendations made by the Secretary of
tiie Navy.
The accompanying rcpert of the Post
master General furnishes a full and satisfac
tory exhibit of the operation of tbe Post
office Department during the year. Our
postal communication with all parts of the
civilized world have been placed upon a most
advantageous footing by the improved postal
conventions and arrangements recently con
cluded with the leading commercial countries
of Europe and America, and the graufving
statement is made that, with the conclusion
ol a satisfactory convention with France, the
details of which have been definitely agreed
to by tbe head of the French Postal" Depart
ment, subject to the approval of the Minister
of Finance, little remains to be accomplished
by treaty for some time to come, in respect
to reduction of rate, or improved facilities for
postal intercourse.
I have heretofore commended the abolition
of the franking privilege, and see no reason
now for changing my views on that subject.
It not having been favorably regarded by
Congress, however, I now suggest a modi
fication of that privilege to correct its glaring
and costly abuses.
I would recommend also the appointment
of a committee or commission to take into
consideration the beat method, equitable to
private corporations who have invested their
time and capital in the establishment of
telegraph Unes. of acquiring he title
to all the telegraph lines doc in operation,
and of connecting thia service with the
postal service of the nation. It is not
probable that this subject could receivo tho
proper consideration during tho limits of a
short session of Congress, but it may le
initiated, so that further action mav be fair
to tbe Government and M private parties
concerned.
Tu report of the Secretary of the Treasury

vears his been in arrears
has been brought down to a recent date, and

tiie poncy which was a lopted at the begin-
; of the Admir sttatien with regard to the
management of tue Indians ha been as suc
cessful as ns most anient frieuds anticipated
within so short a time. It haa reduced the
expense of their management, decreased their
forage upon the white settlements, tended to
give the largest opportunity to the extension
of the great railways through the public do
main and the pusbin the setltenieut into the
more remote districts cf the OMMtty and at
the same time improve tbe condition of tue
Indians.
The policy .viil be maintained without any
change, excepting such as further experience
may show to be necesry to render it more
efficient. Tbe subject of converting
the so-called Indian Territory, south of Kan
sas, into a home for the ludiäns, and erecting
thereon a Territorial form of government. i
one of great importance as a complement of
the existing Indian pobev. The question of
removal to the Territory baa withiu the past
year been presented to manv of the tribes
resident upon otber aud less 'favorable por
tions of tbe public domain aud has generativ
been recoived by them as a nreliuiinajv sten
lo the organization ot ejeb a terntorv will be
i necessary to confine the Indians now resident
I therein to farms of proper size, which should
be secured to them in fee. the residue to bau ed
for the settlement of othar friendly Indians.
Efforts will be made in the immediäte future
to induce the removal of as many peaceably
disposed Indians only to the Indian Territory
as can be settled properly without disturbing
the harmony of those already there. There
is no other location now ava.'able where a peo
ple who are endeavoring to acquire a knowl
edge of pastoral aud agricultural pursuits can
be as well accommodated as upon the unoccu
pied lands of the Indian Territory.
Affairs in tbe Territories are generally satis

In bnt one of them. Utah, is tbe condition of
affairs unsatisfactory, except so far as the
quiet of the citizens' may bo disturbed bv tbe
real or imaginary danger 'of Indian hostilities.
It has seemed to be the policy of the Legis
lature of Utah to evade all responsibility to tbe
Government of the United States, arid evm
to now a position in hostility to it. I recom
mend a careful revision of the laws of the
Territory by Congress, and the enactment of
such a law as tbe ono proposed in Congrews
at its last session, for instance, or something
similar to it, as will secure peace, the e. pial.tr
of all citizens before the law, and the ulti
mate relinquishment of polygamy.
Tiie ninth census i- alut completed. Its
completion is a subject of congratulation, in
asmuch as the use t i be made of tbe statistics
therein contained dApeods very greatly on
the prompitude of publication. The Secretary
of tbe Interior recommends tbat a census be
taken in 1875, which recommendation should
receive the ready attention of Congress. The
interval at present established between tbe
Federal census is so long that the informa
ion obtained at the decimal periods to the
material comhtiou, wants and resources of the
nation is of little practical value. After the
expiration of the first half of that period, it
would probably obviate tbe constitutional pro
vision regarding the decimal census, if a cen
sus taken in 1875 should be divested of ail
political character, and no apportionment of
Congressional represenation be made under
it. Such a census coming as it would in the
last year of tbe first century of our national
existence would furnish a noble monument of
the progress of the United States during tbat
century.
Tbe rapidly increasing interest in education
is a most encouraging feature in tbe current
history of the country, and it i no doubt true
that this is due in a great measure to the
efforts of the Bureau of Education. That
office is continually receiving evidences which
abundantly prove" ita efficiency, from the
various institutions of learning and educators
of all kinds throngnout the country. Tbe
