SENATE ACTION.
Resolutions on the Monroe Doctrine and
for the Recognition of Cuba Introduced
In the Senate.
Washington; Dec 4. Resolutions on
the Monroe doctrine and Cuba were
introduced in the senate yesterday by
Senators Lodre, Cullom, Allen and
CalL Senator Lodge's resolution is as
follows:
That the congress of the United States
deems it proper to assert, as a principle in
which the rights and interests of the United
States are involved, that the American conti
nents, by the free and independent condition
which they have assumed and maintained, are
henceforth not to be considered as subjects for
future colonization by any European-powers.
That we should consider any attempt on
their part to extend their system to any por
tion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our
peace and safety. With the existing colonies
or dep ndencies of any European power we
have not interfered, and shall not interfere,
but with the governments who have declared
their independence and maintained it, and
whose independence we have, on great consid
eration and on just principles acknowledged,
we could not view any interposition for the
purpose of oppressing them or controlling in
any other manner their destiny, by any Euro
pean power, in any other light than as the
manifestation of an unfriendly disposition
toward the United States.
That in accordance with the doctrine laid
down by President Monroe, as stated in the
preceding resolutions, the United States de
clares that it proposes to maintain the princi
ples embodied in that doctrine, and will re
gard any infringement of it or any attempt on
the part of any European power to take or
acquire new territory on the American conti
nent, whether under the pretense of boundary
disputes or otherwise, as an act of hostility to
the United States.
That the president be requested to com
municate these resolutions to the governments
of all nations with whom we have relations of
amity and commerce.
Senator Cullom also introduced a
resolution on the same subject. It is
as follows:
That the policy proclaimed by President
Monroe and since known as the Monroe doc
trine is, Dy precedent and tradition, the recog
nized, rightful policy of the United States, and
that this government will regard the estab
lishment by any European power of any new
colonial dependency or of any protectorate
over any existing or future .government, or the
control or ownership of any interoceanic canal
on the continent of America, as a dangerous
menace to the welfare and prosperity of the
United States.
Senators Call and Allen introduced
resolutions for the recognition as bel
ligerents of the Cuban insurgents.
That of Senator Allen declares in favor
of the purchase or annexation of all
islands in close proximity to the main
land. His resolution follows:
Resolved. That it is the sense of the Senate
that the government of the United States of
America should promptly recognize the revo
lutionists of Cuba, who are now honestly
struggling to secure their independence of the
Spanish government, as composing an inde
pendent nation, possessing all the rights there
of, according to the laws of nations.
That all islands in close proximinty to the
United States of America should as speedily as
possible, by treaties of purchase, be annexed
to this government as essent ial to our safety ir
times of war and the convenience and neces
sity of our commerce in times of peace.
That the wise declaration of President Mon
roe known as the Monroe doctrine is a well
establishei policy of the government of the
United States and should be promptly and ef
fectually maintained by the government in its
original purity and purpose.
That, while the government of the United
States should not needlessly or hastily embroil
itself with any foreign power and should only
resort to extreme measures in cases of abso
lute necessity, a firmer and more prompt pol
icy on the part of this government in main
taining the rights of American citizens abroad
should be introduced and pursued.
Senator Call's resolution reads:
Resolved, That the government of the United
States recognize a condition of public war be
tween the government of Spain and the gov
ernment proclaimed and for some time main
tained by force of arms by the people of Cuba,
and the United States of America hereby de
clare that they will maintain a condition of
strict neutrality between the contending pow
ers and accede to each all the rights of bellig
erents in the ports and territory of the United
States.
The congress of the United States protests
and remonstrates against the barbarous man
ner in which the war in Cuba has been con
ducted, and the president is hereby authorized
to take such steps as may be expedient in his
judgment to secure ar: observance of the laws
of war by civilized nations.
TO SUCCEED JACKSON.
Kufus W. I'eckham Named for Associate
Justice of tlie Supreme Court.
Washington, Dec. 4. The president
has nominated Rufus W. Peckham, of
New York, to be associated justice of
the United States supreme court to
succeed the late Howell E. Jackson,
of Tennessee. It is believed his nom
ination will be satisfactory to Senator
Hill, whose opposition was successful
in preventing the confirmation of
Messrs. Hornblower and Wheeler Peck
ham, two New Yorkers, whose names
were sent in by President Cleveland for
the supreme court judgeship, now held
by Justice White, of Louisiana. Sen
ator Hill, on several occasions, has
spoken very highly of the nominee.
The nomination will go first to the
senate judiciary committee, which al
ways scrutinizes closely the record of
persons named for the supreme court
bench, but in view of the high reputa
tion of Judge Peckham, it is believed
confirmation will follow as speedily as
consistent with the importance of the
office.
IN WALLER'S BEHALF.
The Kansas Delegation Will Look Earnest
ly After the ex-Consul Case.
Washington, Dec. 4. The Kansas
delegation in congress is determined
to leave nothing undone to secure the
release of ex-Consul John L. Waller
from his imprisonment in France.
After the president's message had
been read yesterday the entire delega
tion of senators and members, includ
ing republicans and populists, held a
meeting to decide upon their course of
action. It was resolved to push a reso
lution in both houses calling upon the
president for all the papers and corre
spondence in the case. Several mem
bers thought this resolution should be
accompanied by one stating it to be
the view of congress that the president
should take immediate action.
FOUND DEAD.
m.wwv iucu discovered tronn to Death in
St. tonls.
St. Louis, Dec 4. Two men were
found frozen to death in this city yes
terday. The body of an unknown
man, about G5 years of age, was found
in Ilirsch's warehouse on Spruce street
at 10 o'clock. The body was in a fear
fully emaciated condition and almost
without clothing. Another man, whose
identity is also unknown, was found
lying dead near the Wabash tracks on
the outskirts of the city this forenoon.
It is believed that the man fell from
or was struck by a train, and died as a
result of exposure to the cold weather.
NATIONAL BANKS.
Report of the Comptroller of the Currency
Number of National Banks Suggrentioua
ftelatlTrt to the Increase of Note Issue.
Washington, Dec. 2. The report of
Hon. James H. Eckels, comptroller oi
the currency, gives information in de
tail in regard to the organization, su
pervision and liquidation of the na
tional banks for the year ended Octo
ber 31, 1895, and similar information
as far as obtainable relative to banks,
banking companies and savings insti
tutions organized and doing business
under the laws of the several states
and territories.
The total number of national banks
organized since the date the first cer
tificate of authority was issued, June
20, 1863, to the close of the report year,
has been 5,023, making a yearly aver
age of 152. Of the number organized,
there were in active operation on Oc
tober 31 last 3,715, with, an authorized
capital stock of $664,136,915, represented
by 285,190 shareholders, or an average
capital stock of $178,772 for each bank;
average number of shares to each,
2,136, and of shareholders, 77. The
total amount of their circulation out
standing was $213,887,630, of which
amount $190,180,961 was secured by
United States bonds and $23,706,669 by
lawful money deposited with the treas
urer of the United States.
During the report year forty-three
banks were organized, located in
twenty different states, with an ag
gregate capital stock of $4,890,000. Of
these new bf.nks, twenty-eight, with a
capital stock of $2,530,000, are in the
northern and northwestern section of
the country, and fifteen, with a capi
tal stock aggregating $2,360,000, in the
south and southwest. The number of
banks organized during the year was
less than 30 per cent, of the yearly av
erage. The comptroller recommends a num
ber of amendments to the national
banking law.
In making suggestions relative to
the increase of note issues, the comp
troller uses the following language:
The issuing of circulating notes to the par
value of bonds deposited to secure the same
and the reJucing of the per cent, of semi-annual
tax levied upon such notes has been urged
by all the secretaries of the treasury who
have touched upon the subject at all and by
every comptroller from the time of and includ
Comptroller Knox. The provision of the law
prohibiting the former and the provision of
the law governing the amount of the latter,
however, are still unchanged upon the statute
book.
At a time when the desire is so frequently
expressed that there be a larger issue of bank
notes and complaint is made that national
banks are Indifferent to the note issuing func
tion vested in them, it may well be considered
by congress whether it would not be wise to
do that which will make it of sufficient inter
est to the national banks to pay greater at
tention to note issues. The profit of banking
in the United States is now largely in the de
posit feature of it, and thus it Is of greater
concern under existing circumstances to the
banks to secure deposits than it Is to issue
notes upon a return so small as to scarcely
justify the expense and trouble entailed
thereby.
Banks are not eleemosynary institutions,
and therefore engage only in that which prom
ises a margin of profit. "While on the one
hand entitled to no more favors than are
granted to other corporations or enterprises
carried on by associated individuals, on the
other they should not be denied any privileges
which they may justly claim, and for the de
nial of which no possible excuse can be given.
It is unquestionably true that national banks
would largely increase their note circulation
if the embarrassment arising from the need
less locking up of a large part of their capital,
available for other purposes, and the lessened
profit through excessive taxation now imposed
did not confront them. They certainly would
do so if the legal tender issues of the govern
ment were paid and cancelled and the channel
now clogged by them freed for bank-note cir
culation. The experience of this and other countries
conclusively demonstrates that the best and
most rational not3 issues are those put forth
by banks. It likewise demonstrates that is
sues made direct by government are always
expensive, and under every circumstance a
source of danger to such governmentsind loss
to their people's business interests. No clearer
proof of this could be had than that furnished
by the difficulties which we have witnessed on
the part of this government in its efforts to
maintain the full credit of its practically lim
itless amount of demand obligations.
The advantage accruing to the government
by the substitution of a bank note for a treas
ury note currency would be immeasurably
great. The need of maintaining a gold reserve
to meet tho recurring demand obligations,
now never retired, would, within a reasonable
time, be obviated, and, delivered from this
vexatious and expensive difficulty, the treas
ury department could return to its legitimate
function of collecting the revenues of the gov
ernment needful to meet governmental ex
penses and disbursing the same.
With the relief gained to it through the re
moval of this burden would come a greater one
to the business interests of the individual citi
zen, whose every operation would no longer be
harassed by the uncertainty springing from a
fear that either in the present or the future
the currency obligations now forced by his
government through the provisions of an in
flexible law into the avenues of trade and com
merce may be discredited and dishonored.
The relegating of note issue entirely to the
banks would give a better guarantee of meet
ing the varying wants of trade, which is im
possible with a legal mandate decreeing as
amount of treasury issues of no greater and nl
less volume at one season of the year than an
other, whether or no there be a corresponding
increase or lessening of the demand for cur
rency to transact the business in hand.
It is suggested in connection with
the above that as a necessary element
to the security of proper elasticity of
issue in our bank-note currency sec
tion 9 of the act of July 12, 1882, regu
lating the retirement and issuing oi
circulation to banks within a fixed
period of time, should be repealed and
also that Fuch amendment should be
made to the law as will necessitate the
banks keeping in the office of the
comptroller of the currency a sufficient
amount of bank notes as will enable
them to secure circulation at once, in
stead of after a period of delay, fre
quently of sufficient duration as tc
make the issue unavailable to relieve
the pressure existing at the time ol
ordering the same.

FAVORING SILVER.
rhe Transmississippi Congress Closes It
Work Free Silver Resolutions Adopted
Omaha, Neb., Nor. 29. After five
hours discussion of the financial issues
the Transmississippi commercial con
gress yesterday declared for the free
and unlimited coinage of silver, 16 to 1
basis, and adjourned at 6 o'clock. The
vote was 50 for gold, j 27 for silver. W.J.
Bryan led the friends of the white
metal, and J. L. Webster, of Omaha,
the opposition. The debate was spir
ited and participated in by most of the
delegates. This resolution was finally
adopted:
Whereas, An appreciating money standard
Impairs all contracts, bankrupts enterprises,
makes idle money profitable by increasing its
purchasing power and suspends productive
forces of our people; and
"Whereas, The spoliation consequent upon
the outlawry of silver in the interest of the
creditor class by constantly Increasing the
value of gold, is undermining all industrial so
ciety; therefore
Resolved, That we demand the Immediate
restoration of free and unlimited coinage of
gold and sliver at the present ratio of 16 to 1,
without waiting for the aid or consent of any
other nation, such gold and silver coin to be
alike a full legal tender of all debts, public and
private.
Mr. Webster, on behalf of the minor
ity of the committee, presented the
following:
Resolved, That we are In favor of true bi
metallism, which consists in the largest pos
sible use of both gold and silver as the stand
ard money of the country compatible with the
lower of the nation to maintain the equal
purchasing and debt-paying power of the two
metals, that we are emphatically opposed to
the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1, under present ex
isting conditions: that such coinage
would destroy the parity between the two
metals; that the silver would drive the gold
out of circulation, and thus destroy bimetal
lism and produce silver monometallism: that
we believe this long continued agitation of the
silver question has had much to do with the
present financial depression, producing want
of confidence, threatening the stability and
permanency of prices, and Is a constant men
ace to the natkmal credit, exciting apprehen
sions abroad and uncertainty at home.
President Bryan asked unanimous
consent to introduce the following me
morial on behalf of the Nebraska dele
gation: Whereas, We believe that an exposition of
all the products, industries and civilization of
the states west of the Mississippi river, made
at some central gateway, where the world can
behold the wonderful capabilities of these
great wealth-producing states, would be of
great value, not only to the transmissfssippi
states, but to all the homeseekers in the world;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the United States congress
be asked to tako such steps as may be neces
sary to hold a transmississippi exposition in
Omaha during the months of August, Septem
ber and October, In the year 1898, and that rep
resentatives of such states and territories in
congress be requested to favor such an appro
priation, as is usual in such cases, to assist in
carrying out this enterprise.
Resolutions were also adopted in fa
vor of a congressional appropriation
for defending the harbor of San Diego
by war vessels and fortifications; for
the improvement of waterways, and
for a deep water harbor at San Pedro.
A long resolution urging the various
state governments to take legislative
action relative to irrigation was sub
mitted and passed. Salt Lake was
selected as the next place of meeting
and the body adjourned permanently
at 6 o'clock.

West.
At Kansas City, Mo., in the presence
of 10,000 spectators, every one of whom
was an intense partisan of one side or
the other, the Missouri Tigers met and
defeated the Kansas Jayhawkers. The
score was 10 to 6. The game was so
close that the result was in doubt up
to the moment time was called with
the ball but a few yards from the Mis
souri goal. It is the second game Mis
souri has won from Kansas in five
years.
At Omaha, Neb., Nebraska university
defeated Iowa university, 6 to 0, Iowa
thus finishing the season without scor
ing in the inter-collegiate series.
At Chicago two interesting games
were played. The contest between the

ton Athletic association resulted in a
tie, 4 to 4. The Chicago university
eleven was shut out by Ann Arbor, the
score standing 12 to 0.
At Philadelphia the university of
Pennsylvania won from Cornell by a

Panic at a Fair.
Woosteb, O., Nov. 29. During the
progress of a church fair here an im
mense crowd was packed into the city
armory, when a lamp in one of the
booths exploded, setting fire to the
draperies of Miss Myrtle Elser, an at
tendant. A rush for the single exit, in
which dozens of women and children
were trampled, occurred. Fully 10C
persons jumped or were thrown from
the windows, many being badly cut by
glass. Mrs. Carrie McKee, of Jeffer
son, was thrown through a window,
sustaining injuries which will likely
prove fatal. Jennie Putnam, a 10-year-old
cripple, could not help herself and
received internal injuries which will
cause her death. Mrs. Milford Snyder
and Miss Sharp were trampled by the
crowd. Many others were more or
less injured.

TROLLEY CAES AND PILLS.
From the Evening News, Newark, N. J.
Mrs. Anna Burns, of 838 Plane Street,
Newark, N. J., is a decidedly pretty bru
nette, twenty-six years old, tall, and a pleas
ing conversationalist. On the ground floor
of her residence she conducts a well-ordered
candy store. . When our reporter visited her
store she, in response to a question, told him
a very interesting story.
"Until about two months ago," she began,
'I enjoyed the very best of health and could
work night and day if necessary. Suddenly,
and without any apparent cause, I began to
suffer from intense pains in mj head', in my
limbs and temples. Almost distracted with
this seemingly never ending pain I tried
cure after cure, prescription after prescrip
tion aDd almost a gallon of medicine of all
kinds. Nothing did me any good. In fact
I became worse. The knuckles of my hands
soon became cramped and the pain in my
hips became more and more distressing each
day. Business in the store had to be attend
ed to, however, and so I was obliged, suffer
ing as I was, to keep more or less on my
feet, and occasionally I was forced to go
out. This was the ordeal I dreaded. Each
time I went out I trembled when I came
near the car tracks, for my pain at times
was so severe that I was obliged to stand
perfectly still, no matter where I was. On
one occasion I wa3 seized in this way while
I was crossing the tracks on Market Street,
and there I stood perfectly rigid, unable to
move hand or foot while a trolley car came
thundering along. Fortunately it was
stopped before it struck me, but the dread
of it all lasted as long as my pain, for I nev
er knew when crossing the tracks whether
I would not drop t the ground in my agony
and be crushed to death. My anxiety to get
well grew apace, and I had about given up
in despair when I saw in the Evening TCews
one day an advertisement of Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills. Here was something I hadn't
tried before, and I lost no time in getting to
the nearest drug store. There I paid fifty
cents for a box of these truly wonderful,
health-restoriug pills. Before I had finished
taking half of the pills I began to feel re
lieved; the pains in my hips gradually dis
appeared, and for tho first time in many
days I felt as if there was some hope. I
continued to take the pills, and the more I
took the better I felt. I finished one box,
got another, and now, having taken only a
few of the second fifty cents' worth. I am
free from all pain and as happy as the day
is long. Since I began to take Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills I have gained thirty pounds, and
now when I cross the car tracks I don't care
if there is a dozen vehicles near by. ft is a
great relief, I assure you. and suffering hu
manity has a never-failing friend in Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale Peopie. I
know what I am talking about. I speak
from experience."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements necessary to
give new life and richness to the blood and
restore shattered nerves. They are also a
specific for troubles peculiar to females,
sirch as suppressions, irregularities and all
forms of weakness. In men they effect a
radical cure in all cases arising from mental
worry, overwork or excesses of whatever
nature. Pink Pills are sold in boxes (never
in loose bulk) at SO cents a box or six boxes
for $.50, and may be had of all druggists,
or direct by mail from Dr. Williams' Medi
cine Company, Set snectady, N. Y.

Strange Things In This World.
There is a man to whom rice in any
form is poison. Some friends wished
to test this person's susceptibility, and
at dinner surreptitiously got him to
partake of biscuit in each of which was
a grain of rice. He ate two or three
biscuits and soon after had to leave the
table, declaring that he was being poi
soned by rice, though he was absolutely
certain he had not partaken of any.
The other case was one in which the
juice of a gooseberry acted as a power
ful excitant and produced at once a vir
ulent skin eruption. This man was so
very susceptible that he could detect
gooseberry juice even when it was mas
queraded as champagne. At a public
dinner he whispered to his neighbor it
was gooseberry juice they were drink
ing and as proof he turned up his shirt
sleeves and showed him the rash devel
oping. That man was clearly intended

Power unless managed with gentleness
and discretion, does but make man the
more hated; no intervals of good humor,
no starts of bounty, will atone for tyranny
and oppression. Jeremy Collier.

compelled to assert liberty, the significance
of the individual, the grandeur of duty, the
power of character. Emerson.
