The only painting by a native artist was
I the Antletam Bridge, the work of a very
I promising artist of this city, Mr. Mcliod,
Otaxoux's "Spring" was exceedingly ad.
mired. It represents a May morning, In a.'l
the' sweetness and rich blossomings of that
delicious month. Tho picture is the prop
erty of a gentleman In New York, but it
should not be allowed to leave our city,
For want of room we cannot particularise
the many notable gems of th collection,
which was s very interesting one, as repre
renting the tastes of the different owners, aa
well aa the differing genius of the artists who
produced the pictures. The water-color
paintings belonging to Mr. FiAirxLiit FntLF
excited much admiration. They were pur.
chased by their owner daring his late visit to
Europe, and some of them are undoubtedly the
finest specimens of water colors In this country,
The fruit piece, belonging .to the Secretary
or War, painted by Ubtiel, Is an exquisite
picture It does not represent the "fruits Of
the rebellion." "The Valley of the W.ia-
hleon," the largest painting exhibited, is
line landscape. "The Song of the Shirt,"
which Mr. Itioos considers the best picture
in his valuable collection, might be cited
against the theory that poetry is abore
painting among the Una arts. The "Oronp
of Horses," belonging to Mr, AniDOn, is one
of the best efforts of Walkxr, who is dls
tlngulshed in that line of art. The "Child
Blowing a Feather," by tViiTXRUALTiB,
attracted much attention. It represents a
little one, who, on awaking In the morningi
had discovered a loose feather.and was blow.
log It up Into the air an Innocent amusement
Indulged in by all children raised on feather
beds, we believe.
One of the fine water-colors, "Cook's
Folly, Gloucestershire, " was painted by Miss
Auxlia B. Edwards, the talented novelist,
and author of "Barbara's Courtship." An
other, a marine view, which was much
praised, was the work of the distinguished
artist J. G. PniLr, of the English "Society
of Painters In Water Colors." Some Inter.
estlng original pencil sketches by the late
Joni Luce of tho London Fundi, were
also on exhibition.
After having feasted their eyes upon the
pictures and discussing their manifold beau
ties, the company were invited to partake of
the following :

The dishes abore enumerated were made
up in the most artistic style, and the punch
was voted a work of "high art" by all who
tasted it. After supper those inclined to
dancing enjoyed that amusement to a reas
onably late hour. Among the distinguished

"The WaAttlnsrton Mutual CotU Com.
pny."
We direct the attention of our readers to
the circular printed In to-day's paper with
the above heading. It Is the only fair, prac
tical arrangement we hare yet seen or heard
of to get rid of the extortion on fuel. The
parties originating and proposing thesohem
have lived in and are familiar with the coal
region and all Its mining operations. They
are patties of position and character, and are
endorsed by some of our best people. It Is
no speculative scheme. Several of such
companies are now In successful operation in
Boston and New York, furnishing the very
best quality of coal to their shareholders at
from three to four dollars per ton less than the
ordinary retail price. This company, if it
can be got up and put in operation, will
supply a great want known and felt here by
all
The proposition commends itself by its fair,
open offer. No one Is asked to pay or ad
vance any money, until a committee of our
own cltltens go and examine these collieries,
and all the facilities of getting out ooal and
getting It here, and report back that all Is
fair and satisfactory. No time should be
lost, but the matter should bo taken hold of
at once, in good earnest. A meeting should
be called, a nrst-rate committee appointed,
and, if their report Is favorable, we believe
the stock will be eagerly taken In a few
days.

The wreck of the Bemocratle party was not
the fault of Barnegat, but from the fact of
the concern being too heavily coppered, and
from over weight of the metal, sank. It was
a total lots of cargo and crew, without in
surance. The community at large suflered
nothing by the event.

THE PRESS OH THE PRESIDENT'S
MTXHRArilC. a,
The-Fhlladelpht North American says
This mesial e la a document of marked
ability, and In all the parts of It which do
not merely rurnisn a resume or the depart
mental reports, it will challenge the admira
tion of the publlo far and wide.
The Cincinnati Oatetithu the following:
There it nothing In this the portion of the
message relating to reconstruction antago
nistic to the policy already indicated by
Congress, but the reverse
The message, as a whole, will, we feel con
fident, be approved by the supporters of the
Administration generally, both in and ontof
Congress.
The Chicago RtpMiean (0. A. Daxa)
says 1
The message of the President of the United
States was read yesterday in Congress, and
it will be received by the country with that
respect and attention which It Is officially
entitled to, and with that satisfaction which
Its high patriotism and frank statesmanship
will extort from honest men of all parties the
world over.
Upon the whole, we think the country, in
view of the doubts and uncertainties of the
past six months, will feel very grateful for
the message. It is exceedingly well written,
ana oeirnye luni earnest tnougnt ana dellb
eratlon which it characteristic of the Presl.
dent. It will prove more gratifying because
of the total absence of any spirit of resist
ance or defiance to the well-known wishes of
the people In the matter of reconstruction.
and because, therefore, It promises the ut
most harmonr between the Executive and
the National Legislature.
The Richmond Sentinel declares that
"the message U in most respects what it was
expected to be " "It is not to as; It was
sent to Congress." It will doubtless be
cause of unceasing agony to the President
that he did not address his message "To the
editor of the Sentinel."
The Concord (N. II.) Democrat says:
" It is a frank and candid statement of
facts and views, showing an honest heart and
an upngnt purpose."
The New York World tayi "President
Joiuisor's message is notquite free from In
consistency." The Boston Journal says:
The message Is creditable to the head and
heart of Andrew Johnson. It is a sufficient
tribute to his sincerity of character to say
that It Is, in its leading positions and general
tone, Just about what most people had an
ticipated, thus baffling a few enthusiasts, on
the one hand, who had Indulged the notion
that the President would acknowltdge his
reconstruction policy a failure, and Recom
mend the substitution of severer measures;
and a few mischief-making alarmists, on the
other, who have long been busy In predicting
a fierce quarrel between the President and
the majority of tho Administration members
of Congress.
The Wheeling Intelligencer says the mes
stge is an unusually clear and well-written
paper.
The Philadelphia Daily NtK$ observes
that
"However men may differ with regard to
tome of the views presented, It will not be
denied that the paper throughout is pervaded
by a tone of dignity and calm seriousness
which Indicates deep reflection and a pro
found sense of the solemn responsibility
which at the present time rests upon the
Chief Magistrate of the great Republlo of
our western continent"
The Outside Congress.
This large and Intelligent body Is composed
altogether of Southern meo-bers, most of
whom mistook Washington for Richmond,
and are decidedly out of "soundings." It
has all the elements of a deliberative body ex
oept occupation and organisation. It is fer
tile with Senators, Representatives, and ter
ritorial delegates. Owing to the somewhat
stupendous hotel tariff of Washington, the du
ration of the outside Congress is "sllghtnally"
dubious. It is a perambulatory affair; gen
erally tin, standing, and holds Its principal
session at Willards. When it adjourns it
will, if it can, adjourn to meet at the Capi
tol. It has one advantage over the inside
Congress, it is not subject to the pressure of
the lobby or the hopeless persecutions of the
'button-holer," Its honorable members are
painfully suffering from a terrible repression
of eloquence. Long years having elapsed
since their rhetoric has been vented in this
locality they are naturally anxious to try
their art again at "soaring the great eagle."
Their principal grievance therefore is not
that the Congress has shut them out but has
cruelly and heartlessly shut their mouths.
We say,ln all kindness to our outside friends,
"wait for the wagon, there's a, good time
coming,"
Kentucky, Out Kentucky!"
The Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky Is
a candidate for the United Etatos Senate.
In furtherance of his operations he addresses
a discourse to the people through the news
papers, in whloh he says:
"Nor will I, as her (Kentucky) representa
tive, if it falls to my lot to give the casting
vote, degrade her by voting for the Constitu
tional amendment, if all the bayonets from
Maine to the Rio Grande were pointed at
my throat to enforoe oompllanoe,"
We can imagine Gov. Brarlxtte reading
this remarkable message of his Lieutenant.
An Irlthraan's hors kicked up and smashed
the da?h-board one day. "Ah "' says Pat,
"Is that ye're at ! If it's yerself Is goin to
get In, I'll be either getting out."
Three Mor Statee for the Anti-Slavery
Amendment.
We hare the announcement by telegraph
to-day that the Legislature of Georgia has
ratified tho anti-slavery amendment. The
Senates of Oregon and California have done
likewise. The lower branches of the Legls
latures of those States will follow suit. To
tal for ratification, thirty States.
A cortertior of soldiers and sailors of
Maryland, who served in the late war, was
held at Baltimore on Wednesday. A dele
gation was present from the Washington
League. The convention endorsed the pres
ent registration law of Maryland.
The Senatorial contest in Iowa waxcth
warm. A dispatch says Hon. Jonx A. Kas
bun and Oen.W. L Vardever are among the
candidates.

ternoon, before Joetlee Walter, ta the Criminal
Court room, at the CUr Hall.
Mr. Joiepa H Bradley, Jr., appeared far the
Corporation of Wmblngton, and itr. W, B,
Webb, A. O. Riddle, and Joieph U. Stewart for
the Orange aad Alexandria rallruad, and General
Welle for the Waahlngtou aud Alexandria road.
It will be remembered that thle cne wat com
menced on Taeday evening lat, when never al
wltaeuiea were examined, after wli ch tt wae
adjourned until tula afternoon. The cuae la on
a warrant against John Shulta, Jamee. Dojle,
Robert Illnimao, and L. J. ULlbert, employee!
of the Orange and Alexandria railroad, who were
arrested on the train some dare ago and brongbt
before Justice Walter for running the trains
through the streets.
The flrat wttneps examlood this afternoon was
the Hon. B. B. French, Commltelouer of l'ublle
Building, for the defence, who leetlHed that he
thought tbe trilni ran alow enough for anyone
to get away. Always heard the bell ringing and
blowing of whittle as they came around the
carve at the foot of Capitol Hill.
W, V. Montgomery teatlfled that he wae In
charge of the railroad bridge acroaa the Potomac.
Coming np the grade between the bridge and
Eleventh street the trains ran aboat six rmlea an
hour; from there to the Baltimore depot a man
could walk aa fait ae the trains ran. A red flag
was displayed lathe day time, aud belle rung;
at night, lantern were displayed. Did not see
any flag before the 16th of jiovember.
Dr. James E. Morgan, for the proaecutlon, tes
tified that he had an office next door to Maryland
avenue and Twelfth street. Since the 10th of
October train had not been ran eo frequent as
before. Aa far aa speed waa concerned the com
pany had managed It as well as any could. But
what was objected to waa running by a tea id,
causing horses to runaway, lie thought run
ning the cars through the elty by steam was pre
judicial tothe Uvea and health of the cltlsena. It
wa the uae of ateam which was generally com
plained of, and It was now a pnblle Inconve
nience and Injury.
By the defence: Witness thought to run the
care by steam through the streeta of any city was
a nultanc. Had seen aorae of the engineers on
the road blow the whittle when horaea would
paie them ao the horae would run off. Tula wa
complained of, and It wa stopped. For the naat
two years the cara had been run very alow while
the Government had charge of the road.
Capt. James L. McQulre teatlfled that he thought
the esglnee ran very slow over the road now;
wltneaa had walked as faat aa the cars ran al ng
the atrceta.
Col Welle remarked that at leaat foriy trains
Ssrdaypaseed through the city u( Koc better,
ew ork, and sixty five per day through the
streets of Ifewark, New Jersey.
Mr. Bradley remarked that If trains did pass
through other cities. It waa no reaaon why they
hould run through this city, and these compa
nies, had leglalailve sanction to run the train
through thoae cities, which thla company had
not.
Norman Ilarlatoa had known the trains to run
slow after getting on thla side of the Long Bridge.
Waa night watchman on the Long Bridge, flags
were on the train daring the day, and lanterns
at night.
The testimony was here closed, and
Mr. Bradley, for the prosecution, aald this
Proceeding was inat.tatea at tue instance or the
oard of l'oltce Commissioner. The formalities
of a warrant and an Investigation bad been gone
through with; the parlies appeared, pleaded
and defended. The purpose of the warrant waa
to ascertain if a nuisance wa being committed
here. He called attention to the atatute of the
16th of July, 18ta, and read It.
The present company who were now running
ears over the road had leaaed the road from the
Washington and Alexandria Kallroad Company.
Mr Balaoread from the 12th vol. Statutes at
Large, page 603, granting certain prlvllegea to
the Washington and Alexandria Kallroad Com
pany, which forbid aald company to run car by
ateam through the streets of Washington orover
the Long Bridge without flrat having obtained
the consent of Congress and the corporate
authorities of tbe city of Washington.
Also, regulating tbe speed to such rate aa tbe
authorities of Washington shall from time to
time prescribe. Be asked that suitable means be
adopted to prevent tbe recurrence of this nuis
