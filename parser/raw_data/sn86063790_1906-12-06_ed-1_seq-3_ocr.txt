the People's R
J IS STRONG ON MORALITY
Mr. Roosevelt writes a Particularly
Strong Message In Which He Deals
With Live Issues, Such as Injunctions,
Lynchings and Their Causes, |
and Other Matters of Vital Inter- j
est to the Whole Country.
^--s^^The following is the substance of
the- annual message of President.Roosevelt
to Congress, as read in both
V *1
v houses:
Introductory.
To the Senate and House of Repres j
\ entatives:
* As a nation we still continue to enjoy
a literally unprecedented prosperity;
and it is probable that only reck-1
less speculation and disregard of ligitimate
business methods on the part
of the business world can materially
mar this prosperity.
No Congress in our time has done
more good work of importance than
the present Congress. There were
? v several matters left unfinished at
your last session, however,, which I
~ irmsf earnest.lv hone von will com
^ '^Vy ' i" " / |
piete before your adjournment.
-Corporation Campaign Contributions.
- v.' again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing
to the campaign expenses of any
party. Such a bill has already past
one House of Congress. Let indivi-duals
contribute as thev desire; but
tm let us prohibit in effective fashion all j
corporations from making coatribuk|"-\
tions for any political purpose, dill;':
reetly 01* indirectly.
P^Government's Eight to Appeal in
Criminal Cases.
Another bill which has past one
^ V Bouse of the Congress which it is
EvJ urgently necessary should be enacted
into law is that conferring upon the
' Government the right of appeal in
criminal cases on questious of law.
This right exists in manv of the
States; it exists in the District of
fColumbia by act of the Congress. It
Igp is gf course not proposed that in any j
case a verdict for the defendant on I
the. merits should be set aside. Re- j
"i-.f centiy in one district where the Gov- I
-eminent had indicted certain oersons !
for conspiracy in connection with rebates,
the court sustained the defen"
dant's demurrer; while in another an
Xindictment for conspiracy to obtain
rebates has been sustained by the
-court, convictions obtained under it,
. and two defendants sentenced to im ;'M
. prisonment. The two cases referred
| tc may not be in real conflict with
I -each other, but it is unfortunate thai
there should even be an appearenr
coifflict. At present there is no way
k- by. which the Government can cause
Wp/. sue^ a conflict," when it occurs, to be
*solved by an appeal to a higher court;
and the wheels of justice are blocked
'"without any real decision of the question.
I can not too strongly urge
^ the passage of the bill in question.
c5'\ A failure to pass it will result in
seriously hampering the Government
in its effort to obtain justice, especially
against wealthy individuals or j
corporations who do wrong; and may j
also prevent the Goyernm^nt from ob- j
? taining justice for wageworkers who j
are not themselves able effectively to !
contest a case where the judgment of I
an inferior court has been against;
them. I have specifically in view a I
recent decision by a district judge '
leaving railway employees without
remedy for violation of certain so^
; called labor statute. It seems an absurdity
to permit a district juedg
against what may be the judgment
the immense majority of his col.
leagues on the bench, to declare a
policy of resorting to the criminal
law solemnly enafcted by the Congres
to be "unconstitutional/' and then
to denv the Government the right to
have the Supreme Court definitely
decide the question.
It is well to recollect that the real
efficiency of the law often depends
not upon the passage of acts as to
which there is great public excitement,
but upon the passage of acts of
this nature as to which there is not
much public excitement, because there
is little public understanding of their
importance, while the interested parties
are keenly alive to the desirability
of defeating them. The imporV
. tance of enacting into law the particular
bill in question is further increased
by the fact .hat the Government
has now definitely begun a

commerce cases where such a course
offers a reasonable chance of success.
V Setting Aside of Judgments and
Granting of New Trials.
In connection with this matter, I
would like to call attention to the
very unsatisfactory state of our cirrninal
law, resulting in large part from
the habit of setting aside the judg?
ments of inferior courts on technicalities
absolutely unconnected with thi
merits of the case, and where there
is no attempt to show that there ha-*
been, any failure of substantial justice.
It would be well to euact a law
gi nil
Are Suggested to

epresentatives
i
j
providing something to the effect
that:
Xo judgment shall be set aside or
new trial granted in any case, civil
or criminal, on the ground of misdirection
of the jury or the improper
admission or rejection of evidence, or
for error a% to any matter of pleading
or procedure unless, in the opinion
of the court to which the application
is mad?, after an examina
tion of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively
appear that the error complained
of has resulted in a miscar-,
riage of justice.
* Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the
matter by the demand that the right
of applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolishing
altogether the use of injunctions
in such cases would stand the test of
tha courts; in which case of course
the legislation would be ineffective.
Moreover, I believe it would be wrong
altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions.
It is criminal to permit
sympathy for criminals to weaken
our hands in upholding the law; and
if men seek to destroy life or property
by mob violence there should be no
impairment of the power of the courts
to deal with them in the most summary
and effective way possible. But
so far as possible the abuse of the
power should be provided against by
some such law as I advocated last
year.
In this matter of injunctions there
is lodged in the hands of the judiciary
a necessary power which is nevertheless
subject to the possibility of grave
abuse. It is a power that should be ex
eicised with extreme care and should
be subject to the jealous scrutiny of
all men, and condemnation should be
meted, out as much to the judge who
fails to use it boldly when necessary
as to the judge who uses it wantonly
or oppressively. Of course a judge
strong enough to be fit for his office
will enjoin arfy resort, to violence or
intimidation, especially by conspiracy,
no matter what his opinion may
be of the rights of the original quarrel.
There must be no hesitation in
dealing with disorder. But there
orust likewise be no such abuse of the
injunctive power as is implied in forbidding
laboring men to strive for
their own betterment in peaceful and
lawful ways; nor must the injunction
be used merely to aid some big corporation
in carrying out schemes for
its own aggrandizement.
Lynching.
In connection with the delays of
the law, I call your attention and the
attention of the nation to the prevalence
of crime among us, and above
all to the epidemic of lynching and
mr>h vinlencp that sDrinsis ud. now in'
one part of our country, now in another.
Each section, North, South,
East, or West, has its own faults; no
section can with wisdom spend its
time jeering at the faults of another
section; it should be busy trying to
amend its own shortcomings. To
deal with the crime of corruption it
is necessary to have an awakened
public conscience, and to suppliment
this by whatever legislation will add
speed and certainty in the execution
of the law. When we deal with
lynching even more is necessary. A
great many white men are lynched,
but the crime is pecularlv frequent in
respect to black men. _ The greatest
existing cause of lynching is the perpetration,
especially by black men,
of the hideous crime of rape?the I
most abominable in all the category
of crimes, ever worse than murder.
Mobs frequently avenge the commission
of this crime by themselves torturing
to death the man committing
it; thus avenging in bestile fashion a
bestile deed, and reducing themselves
to a level with the criminal.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
upon; and when mobs begin to lynch
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere of their operations and lynch
for many other kinds of crimes, so
that two-thirds or the lynchmgs are
hot for rape at all; while a considerable
proportion of the individuals
lynched are innocent of all crime.
Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated
on one occasion some years ago: "I
can say of a varity that I have, within
the last month, saved the lives of
half a dozen innocent negroes who
were pursued by the mob, and
brought them to trial in a court of a
law in which they were acquitted."
As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi,
has finely said: "When the rule of
a mob obtains, that which distinguishes
a high civilization is rurrendered.
The mob which lynches a negro
charged with rape will in a little
while lynch a white man suspected of
crime. Every Christian patriot in
America needs to lift up his voice in
loud and eternal protest against the
mob spirit that is threatening the integrity
of this Republic." Governor
Jelks, of Alabama, has recently spoken
as follows: "The lynching of any
person for whatever crime is inex
%
cusable anywhere?it is a defiance ot
orderly government; but the killing
of innocent people under any provocation
is infinitely more horrible; and
yet innocent people are likely to die
when a mob's terrible lust is one:
aroused. The lesson in this: No
good citizen can afford to countenance
a defiance of the statutes, no matte;
v. hat the provocation. The innocent
[frequently suffer, and, it is my obesrj
vation, more usually suffer than the
i guilty. The white people of the South
i indict the whole colored race on the
I ground that even the better element.!
lend no assistance whatever in ferI
reting out criminals of their own col101.
The respectable colored people
I 4. i.nt 4a 1> q vVinr (lioir orimi.
LLIUSi. ICitlll 11UL lu 11U1 ,J*JL
nals, but to assist the officers in bringing
them to justi;.. inis is the
larger crime, and it provokes such
atrocious offenses as the one at Atlanta.
The two races can never get
i on until there is an understanding on
J the part of both, to make common
cause with the law-abiding against
criminals of any color."
Moreover where any crime "committed
by a member of one race against
a member of another race is avenged
in such fashion that it seems as if
not the individual criminal, but the
whole race, is attacked, the result is
to exasperate to the highest degree
race feeling. There is but one rule
in dealing with black men as with
I white men; it is the same rule that
must be applied in dealing with rich
men and poor men; that is, to treat
I -each man, whatever his color, hi?
creed, or his social position, with
even-handed justice on his real worth
as a man. White people owe it quite
as much to themselves as to the colored
race to treat well the colored
man who shows bv his lice that he deserves
such treatment; for it is sure4-lvn
liiolvocf incilnm fn pnennrflpp
in the colored race all those individuals
who are honest, industrious,
law-abiding-, and who therefore raak:
good and safe neighbors and citizens,
Reward or punish the individual on
his merits as an individual. Evil
will surely come in the end to both
races if we substitute for this just
rule the habit of treating all the members
of the race, good and bad, alike.
There is no question of " social equality"
or "negro domination" involved;
only the question of relentlessly
punishing bad men, and of securing
to the good man the right of his
life, his liberty, and the pursuit oi
his happiness as his own qualities
of heart, head, and hand enable him
to achieve it.
Every colored man should realize
that the worst enemy of his race is
the negro criminal, and above all the
negro criminal who commits the
dreadful crime of rape; and it should
be felt as in the highest degree an
offense against the whole country,
and against the colored race in particular,
for a bolored man to fail to
help the officers of the law in hunting
down with all possible earnestness
and zeal every such infamous offender.
Moreover, in my judgement,
the crime of rape should always be
funished with death, as is the case
with murder; asault With intent to
commit rape should be made a capital
crime, at least in the discretion
cf-the court; and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow immediately upon the heels of
the offense; while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need nol
be wantonly shamed while giving testimony,
and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details
The members of the white race or
the other, hand should understand
that every lynching represents b\
just so much a loosening of the bond;
of civilization; that the spirit oi
lynching inevitably throws inti
prominence in the community all the
foul and evil creatures who dwell
therein. No man can take part in the
torture of a human being withoui
| having his own moral nature permanently
lowered. Every lynching means
just so much moral deterioration in
all the children who have any knowledge.of
it, and therefore just so much
(additional trouble for the next generation
of Americans.
Let justice be both sure and swift;
but let*it be justice under the law,
and not the wild and crooked savagery
of a mob.
Capital and Labor.
In dealing with both labor and capital,
with the questions affecting botli
corporations and trades unions, there
is one matter more important to remember
than aught else, and that i:
the infinite harm done by preachers
of mere discontent. These are men
who seek to excite a violent class hatred
against all men of wealth. Thev
seek to turn wise and proper move
rnents lor tlie better control 01 cor
porations and for doing away with
the abuses cannected with wealth, into
a campaign of hysterical excite
ment and falsehood in which the aim
is to inflame to madness the brutal
passions of mankind. The sinistei
demagogs and foolish visionaries who
are always eager to undertake such a
camapigp of destruction sometimes
seek to associate themselves witli
those working for a genuine reform
in governmental and social methods,
and sometimes masquerade as the
reformers. In reality they are th=
worst enemies of the cause they profess
to advocate, just as the, purveyors
of sensantional slander in newspaper
or magazine are the worst
enemies of all men who are engageJ
in an honest effort to better what i?
bad in our social and governmental
conditions. To preach hatred of the
rich man as such, to carry on a campaign
of slander and invective against
: him, to seek to mislead and inflame I
to madness honest men whose lives v
are hard and who have not the kind r
of mental training; which will permit t
them to appreciate the danger in the c
doctrines preached?all this is to com- n
1 mit a crime against the body politic c
and to be false to every worthy prin- v
ciple and tradition of American nat- e
: ional life. Moreover, while such
rceaching and such agitation may
: give a livelihood and a certain notoi
rietv to some of those who take part s
: in it, and may result in the terapor- h
< ary political success of othres, in the f
long run every such movement will t
either fail or else will provoke a vio- a

not merely in undoing; the mischief e
wrought by the demagog and the agi- 1
' tator, but also in undoing the good s
1 that the honest reformer, the true t
upholder of popular rights, has pain- *
fully and laboriously achieved. Cor- ri
1 ruption is never so rife as in com- t
i munities where the demogog and the li
: agitator bear full sway, because in l
such communities all moral i
bands become loosened, and hys- J
tcria and sensationalism replace the a
t spirit of 'sound judgment and fair s
' dealing as between man and man. In
! sheer revolt against the squalid anar1
chy thus produced men are sure in
! the end to run toward any leader who |
! can restore order, and then their re- 1
i lief at being free from the intoler- ^
- able burdens of class hatred, violence, c
i and demogogy is such that they can ^
: not for some time be aroused to in- 0
? dignation against masdeeds by men of c'
i wealth; so that they permit a new s
l growth of the very abuses which were t
! in part responsible for the original I
outbreak. The one hope for success 1
for our people lies in a resolute and *
fearless, but sane and cool-headed, I
advance along the path marked out 2
last year by this Congress. There \
must be a stern refusal to be misled c
> into following either that base crea- *
; ture who appears and panders to the *
- lowest instincts and passions in order 1
i to arouse one set of Americans *
i against their fellows, or that other c
I creature, equally base but no baser, *

mulate or add to an already huge
fortune, seeks to exploit his fellow- )
Americans with callous disregard to 1
their welfare of spul and body. The v
' man who debauches others in order to 1
obtain a high office stands on an evil
? equality of corruption with the man s
who debauches other for financial *
? profit; and when hatred is sown the 2
1 crop which springs up can only be
evil.
! The plain people who think?the f
1 mechanics, farmers, merchants, work- v
1 ers with head or hand, the men to v
! whom America traditions are dear, s
1 who love their country and try to Y
i act decently by. their neighbors, owe u
t it to themselves to remember that the \
most damaging blow that can be 0
1 given popular government is to elect ^
an unworthy and sinster agitator on ]
a platform of violence and hypocrisy. r
Whenever such an issue is raised in r
, this country nothing can be gained t
; by flinching from it, for in such casj c
> democracy is iteseif on trial.' The Y
? triumph of the mob . is just as evil a E
thing as the triumph of the pluto- f
l cracy, and to have escaped one danger s
avails nothing whatever if we sue- r
' eumb to the other.' t
Railroad Employees' Hours and Eight \
Hour Law. c
I call your attention to the need of s
? u:n i: il. i _ c c
pusaing a uiu uiuuiiig IUC jjumuei UL v
hours of employment of railroad em- c
ployee6. The measure is a very mod- 1
erate one and I can conceive of no t
serious objection to it. Indeed, so s
far as it is in our power, it should be 1
our aim steadily to reduce the mini- 2
ber of hours of labor, with as a goal 1
the general introduction of an eight- ^
hour day. There are industries in f
which it is not possible that the hours *
' of labor should be reduced; just as 2
there are communities not far enough r
advanced for such a movement to be v
for their good, or, if in the Tropics, 1
so situated that there is no analogy *
between their needs and ours in this 2
matter. On the Isthmus of Panama, *
for instance, the conditions are in 2
every way so different from what
' they are here that an eight-hour day *
' would be absurd ; just as it is absurd,
I so far as the Isthmus is concerned,
' where white labor can not be employ- .
ed, to bother as to whether the neces- *
sary work is done by alien black men *
or by alien yellow men. But the v
wageworkers of the United States are A
' of so Jiigli a grade that alike from 1
the merely industrial standpoint and ]
from the civic standpoint it should
be our object to do what we can in s
the direction of securing the general 2
observance of an eight-hour dav.
* 1
Employers' Liability.
L Among the excellent laws which the s
. Congress past at the last session was ?
an employers' liability law. It was y
L marked step in advance to get the j
1 recognition of employers' liability on j
. the statute books; but the law did not j
, go far enough. In spite of all preeau
L tions exercised by employers there are
; unavoidable accidents and even
, deaths envolved in nearly every line
! of business connected with the mechanic
arts. This is inevitable saerij
fice of life may be reduced to a mini.
mum, but it can not be completely
. eliminated.
. Investigation of Disputes Between r
Capital and Labor. ^
; The commission appointed by the t
i President October 16, 1902. at tiie re- s
; quest of both the anthricite coal ap- I
[ eiators and miners, to inquire into, t
! consider, and pass upon the questions *
i.-- controversy in connection with the <
' strike in the anthricite regions of 1
\
Pennsylvania and the causes out of
fhich the controversy arose, in their
eport, findings, and award expresr
he belief ''that the State and Fedral
governments should provide the
:iachinery for what may be called th ;
umpulsory investigation of controorsies
btween employers and
mployees when they arise/'
Withdrawal of Coal Lands.
It is not wise that the Nation
hould alienate its remaining coal
jnds. I have temporarily withdrawn |
rum settlement all the lands which
he Geological Survey has indicated I
s containing, or in all probability'
ontaining, coal. The question, how
ver. can be properly settled only by
tgislation, which in my judgment j
hould provide for the withdrawal of
liese lands from sale or from entry; i
nve in certain especial circumstances, j
i'he ownefship would then remain in
he United States, which should not,
icwever, attempt to work them, but
>ermit them to be worked by private
ndividuals under a royalty system,
he Government keeping such control
is- to permit it to see that no exces- j
ive price was charged consumers. j
' Corporations.
The present Congress has taken
ung strides in the direction of seeurng
proper supervision and control
iv the National Government over
orporations engaged in interstate
ir-siness?and the enormous majority
d corporations of any size are engagd
in interstate business The pasage
of the railway rate bill, and only
o a less degree the passage of the
)ure food bill, and the provision for
nereasing and rendering more effecive
national control over the beef)acking
industry, mark an important
idvance in the proper direction. In
he short session it will perhaps b:
lilncult to do much further along this
ine; and it may be best to wait unt:i
he laws have been in operation for a
lumber of months before endeavoring >
increase their scope, because only
peration will show with exactness
heir merits and their shortcomings
r.d thus give opportunity to define
? ^ -xi
mar iuliner remiuiai legiamiiuii u?
.eeded. Yet in my judgment it will
it the end be advisable in connection
nth the packing house inspection law
> provide .for putting a date on the
abel and for charging the cost of inpection
to the packers. All these
aws have already justified their entetment.
Agriculture.
The only other persons whose welnre
is as vital to the welfare of the
rhole country as is the welfare of the
rageworkers are the tillers of the
cil, the farmers. It is a mere truism
o say that no growth of cities, no
growth of wealth, no industrial devlopment
can atone for any falling
iff in the character and standing of
he farming population. During the
ast few decades this fadt has been
ecognized with ever-increasing clearless.
There is no longer any failure
o realize that farming, at least in
ertain branches, must become a techlical
and scientific profession. This
neans that there must be open to
'armers the chance for technical and
cientific training, not theoretical
nerelv but of the most severely praclcal
type. The farmer- represents a
jeculiarly high type of American
:itizenship, and he must have the
:ame chance to rise and develop as
>ther American citizens have. More>ver,
it is exactly as true of the farner,
as it is of the business man and
he wageworker, that the ultimate
uiecess of the Nation of which he
'crms a part must be founded not
done on material prosperity but upon
ligh moral, mental, and physical deelopment.
This education of the
cnner?self-education by preference,
>ut also education from, the outside,
? i l__
is with all other men?is pecuiany
leeessary here in the United States,
vhere the frontier conditions even in
he newest States have now vanished,
vhere there must be a substitution of
i more intensive system of cultivaion
for the old wasteful farm manicement,
and where there must be a
letter business organization among
he farmers themselves.
Marriage and Divorce.
I am well aware of how difficult it
s to pass a constitutional amendment,
nevertheless in my judgment the
vliole question of marriage and di*orce
should be relegated to the auhoritv
of the National Congress. At
>resent the wide difference in the
aws of the different States on this
nbject result in scandals and abuses;
md surely there is nothing so vitally
'ssential to the welfare of the nation,
lothing around which the nation
ihould so bend itself to throw every
j? ?i __ it. i i:r>_
aieguaru. as toe iiouuc jilc ui. iuc
iverage citizen. The change would
>e good from every standpoint. In
^articular it would be good because
r would confer on the ,Congress the
xjwer at once to deal radically' and
'ffieiently with polygamy; and this
ihould be done whether or not mar-'
iage and divorce are dealt with. It
s neither safe nor proper to leave
he question of polygamy to be dealt
vith by the several States. Power to
leal with it should be conferred on
lie National Government.
When home ties are loosened; when
nen and women cease to regard a
vortLv family life, with all its duies
fully performed, and all its reiponsibilities
lived up to, as the life
iest worth living; then evil days for
he commonwealth are at hand. There
ire regions in our land, and classes
>f our population, where the birth
ate has sunk below the death rate.

Surely it should need no demonstra*

from the standpoint of the nation,

a sin which is the more dreadful 0
exactly in proportion as the men. and '

International Morality.
On the question of International .
morality Mr. Roosevelt comes out
strongly, advocating clean dealing between
the nations of earth and also
strongly advocates international arbitiation
as a means of settling'all di?.
Acuities that may arise. . . ' .
American Shipping. -.0
Let me once again call the atteniion
of the Congress to two subjects,
concerning which I have frequently
before communicated with them. One :*:M
is the question of developing AmCri- -jd
can shipping. -T trust that a law eml.odying
in substance the views, or a
major part of the views,exprest in tho
report on this subject laid before the
House at its last session will be past. jj|S
I am well aware that in former yean
objectionable measures have been pro.' /fg;
posed in reference to the encourage-Cig
ment of American shipping; butVsffo.
seems to me that the propose^meiaure
is as nearly unobjectionable
any can be. It will course hene^*/y^
fit primarily our ^seaboard ' States,
Maine, Louis iaj>r; and Washingtoo p
but what benefits part of our peoplo ;
in the end benefits all; Just as Government
aid to irrigation and forestry
in the West is really of benefit, not .
only tp the Rocky Mountain States,
but to all our country. If is prove /MM
impracticable to enact a law for the-~
'encouragement of shipping generally,
then at least provision should be made ^
for better communication with South.
Amenca, notably for fast mail lines *g|
to the chief South American \ports. .'.fSppS
It is discreditable to us that our bus!- :vlS|
ness people, fdr lack of direct communication
in the shape of lines '
steamers with South Ametica, should , c:
in that great sister continent be at-A-.'>"-^?
disadvantage compared to the business
people of Europe.
Currency Befonn. '
I especially call your attention to,
the second subject, the condition ;<&
our currency laws. The! national v-al
bank act has ably served a great pur- - -"'{
pose in aiding the enormous businessyAj ;>1?
development of .the country;. 'ami- J|sj
within ten years there has been an
increase in circulation per capita ^
from $21.41 to $33.OS! For several'
years evidence has been accumulating
that additional legislation is needed,
The recurenee of each crop sdasaif
emphasizes the defects of the presebfr.^ig
laws. There must soon be a revision
of them, because to leave them as they 'r.
are means to incur liability of business
'disaster. Since' your body ad- jjBj
journed there has been a fluctuation
in the interest on call, money from 2
per cent to 30 per cent; and the
tuation was even greater during "the'.-Tgjja
preceding: six months. The Secretary ^1
of the Treasury had to step in and by
wise action put a stop to the moat >^S|
violent period of oscillation. Even
worse than such fluctuation is the ad-' -'
vance in commercial rates and the uncertainty
felt in the sufficiency of < r-Jsg
credit even at high rates. All ccor-'"* '?cfi
mercial interests suffer during eaeh >~?jp
crop period. Excessive rates for call v
money in New York attract monejr..'fV^
from the interior banks into the spCr.
culative fields; this depletes the fund- .
that would otherwise be available'.foi " V?
commercial uses, and commercial bor-V V
rowers are forced to pay ^abnormal

tice the President says:
The Congress has most wisely proV
vided for a National Board for tha ,?'0j
promotion of rifle prietise. Excellent
results have already come from this . '^Sf
law, but it does not go far enough.
Our Regular Army is so small that-in ' f
any great war we should have*.to
trust mainly to volunteers; and in. ^ a.7
such event these volunteers should ' 'f&d
already know how to shoot^ for if a . v"
soldier has the fighting edge, and v
' ability to take care of himself in the X
open, his efficiency on the line of. |
battle is almost directly proportion-^ P ate
to excellence in markmanship. g-'
We should establish shooting gaflar
ies in the large public and military ' v,"
schools, should maintain national tar-^
get ranges in different parts of the , ; ^
country, and should in every way en- - v ?
courage the formation of rifle clubs
throughout all parts of the land. The >*
lit lie Republic of Switzerland offers
u- an excellent example in all matters .
