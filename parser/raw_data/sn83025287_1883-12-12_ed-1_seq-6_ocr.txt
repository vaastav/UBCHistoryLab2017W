The senators were grouped around and the
scene was impressive.
Such a prize a? the St. Louis postoflice
is esteemed to be is in no danger of going
begging. First upon tho list of appli
cants is "Boss" Filley, who had the office
before Mr, Hay who has just resigned and
wants to try its sweets again. Ex-Mayor
and ex-Congressman Nathan Cole, desires
it, and also.Geo. W. Frisbaclr, the veteran
journalist, also Rodney D. Wells, W. K.

C. '.'. Bennett, who has been a postoflice
oCueial for sixteen years.

lithe Cammis-iioncr of Agriculture
:i cabinet oilioer be? It was a matter of
;>rime urgonc3 with the Granger?, when
th.atoscvet order was at its hey-day, to
press upon Congress and the President,
the propriety of giving the head of the
Agricultural bureau a seat in the cabinet.
Tho ingress of Farmers, which sat in
convention with the Louisville exposition,
indicated a hearty desire that
the commissioner bo mado a
number of tho cabinet. Last
year the Uonse passed a bill making this
change. Mr. Nimmo, chief of the bureau
of statistic?, o'-.e^ts to the project, and
gives his reasons as follows:
First, that, it would create an executive de
partment with no executive functions, aud hav
ing the simple bureau occupation of furnishing
information; secondly, that no addition infor
nation would be gained by making tho com
missioner a cabinet ollicer; ihiniiy, that the goo
logical survey and bureau of education' alroady
<lo a portion of tho work proposed tor -ft..! how
cabinet officer; finally, that the present bureau's
t-pecialibts ia arriculturo would have to turn
their attention to subjects not connected wiih
agriculture. The Senate did not pass the Bouse
bill, and those and other objections should be
answered beforo tho proposed change is at
tempted.
Mr. Nimmo's ground i? well taken, and
ha-= produced profound respect at Wash
ington.
PRESI DENIIA L SUCCESSION.
No proper provision exists, is the case
of tho « ..leva!, death or inability of both
the President and Vice President for the
snitabie exercise of the Executive func
tions. In the last congress Senator Hoar
introduced a bill which passed the Senate,
but was not acted on by the House provid
ing for the succession of cabinet officers
in a prescribed order, and the person to
whose lot it fell to act in tbe Executive
capacity was to exercise and discharge the
powers and duties of the office for the re
mainder of tho unexpired term, or until
the President's disability was removed.
Senator Hoar has re-introduced the bill,
with an important change however, under
the new bill the person succeeding to the
offico holds it only until a President can
be eleoted by the people, and he is-re
quired to summon congress in session
within twenty days after assuming the ex
ec^tiv? office. Some law to guard agaiss*
the contingency of a vacancy is demanded
and should be passed by the present con
gress, which should not, as
did the 47th congress, dodge
the responbility. It will be muoh
more satisfactory to have the trouble ol
an extra election once in a while than »c
have the matter remain in a state of doubt.
The plan of Senator Hoar may not be th«
wisest, but it affords protection and until
something better is devised, the consider
ation necessary to make the bill a la-..
should be accorded to it. The feature tc
immediataly call an extra election in case ol
vacancy is good and the office should nevei
ba in the hands of a man not elected to ii
by the people.
CURRENT COMMENT.
A Notable breakfast has just bdea, given Hen
ry Irving by the Clover Club of Philadelphia.
The members of the club are principally jour
nalists, although numerous prominent person
ages in the profession;, official and business
circles are upon its rolls. The President is Mr
Moses P. Handy, managing editor of the Phila
-- V.i in Press. The . customs of this club an
out of the conventional order of things. Al
attempts at stereotyped' speech-making art
barred, the' relation of any anecdote more thai
two we3ks old is effectually stopped by a gen
eral cry of "chestnut" and the singing of "Aulc
La'ig Syne." The tables are pscubar, one be
ing in the shape of a four-leafed clover and
around the stem is set another in the form of a
horse-shae. The president sat at the toe of the
hsrse-shoe, with Irving on his right and Charles -
Wyndham on his left. One pleasant feature of
the affair was the presentation ay Hon. Thomas
Donaldson to Mr. Irving of the watch Edwin
Forrest carried during the last twenty years of
his life. Mr. Irving was very much surprised,
as ao intimation had reached him of this feat
ure of the occasion. He kissed the relic rev
erently and in a very felicitous speech returned
his thanks and promised so long aa he lived to
carry the watck, as a momenta of the great
American actor, and a reminder of the generous
treatment and open-handed hospitality extended
to himself ia this country.
President Abthub -joins in with tke Cheap
John's of his party in recommending national
aid to education, owing, as he puts it, to "the
alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions '
of the country ,' ' Logan, atd that school of pa- i
triots propose to furnish this national aid by
wholesale, - creating a big maohine covering the '
whole country with no end of office holders.
Arthur, in his characteristic insincere-half-heart
ed methods to deal out national aid; by retail,
or, in his own language, "the aid to be given
only wherevar adequate piovisioc3 has not al- ,
ready been mado." This plan would involve a
no less amount of public burden and a no less
number of tax-oating office holders than the
wholesale scheme, and be infinitely more compli
cated and vexatious. If the lavish and unwar
ranted expenditure of money were curtailed at
Washington, instead of the devising of new pro
jects to dive into the treasary, the public would
not be so • entirely without confidence in the |
professions of their public servants.
Edward MoPHEBSON turns up as a candidate
for Secretary of the Senate. He has been in '
office at Washington for twenty years, and quite '
.i portion of the time as Clerk of the House.
Whenever the Republicans have gone out of
power in tho House, Mcpherson has been on ■
their hands, and whan, as two years ago they
got back again, as a natural sequence Mc-Pherson
bobbed ia again also. What luck this veteran
tax-eater may have now to get on to the Senate
pay-roll is immaterial. If that place is not ob-
able, ha will surely contrive to lit him
self in somewhere else. He will bo on hand as
long a, the Republicans lave eny offices to give
oa c.
Taa hideous sea serpent is said to have
"bobbed up serenely" again. This tima off the
Now Jersey shore in a levised and enlarged edi
tion. It ha* been suggested that it might have
been one of Robeson's old cruisers, but their
well known inability to float so far, ought to
put a stop to such insinuations. It must have
been a really and truly live sea serpent this
time, for Capt. Green of the life saving service
gives an elaborate description of the creature;
closing his report with the remark and "this is
tho truth."
Manlx Shotwell, of Concord, Jasks-n co.
Mich., has boon, by the misfortune of sickness,
deprived of the use of his arms, but as a student
of telegraphy at Ann Arbor Uaiveraity he ads
and rociavos messages with facility. On the ta
ble in front of him area pencil and a stick.
Taking tho pencil liotwocn his teeth ho can
write a good hand— that is what one would
call it—and with the stick in his mouth and
resting on tho key he cua send messages at the
rat-j of about seventeen words par minute.
Tub Millard Fillmore will case, in which the
i-aaity of the wife of the ex-president is in dis
pute, recalls the fact, the Buffalo Express says,
that the widow of President Lincoln became in
sane before she die I, and that Martha Washing
ton .-.' ed very queerly, shutting herself up in a
room at Mt. Tft-non, without a fire, for eighteen
months, and letting no one see her except the
cat, which came through a hole which she cut
j for the purpose.
Tins Boston Herald thinks that Senator Ed
munds' new anti-polyga my bill contains several
goad features, foremost among which is the
abolishing woman suffrage in Utsi. "This is
right of tho slaves and dupts of the Mormons
has proved a bulwark or defence for polygamy,
:-. .1 it should be withdrawn." There is fsol
for thought in that proposition.
Taa Mobile Register giv»s as one of the rea
sons for the increase of oriaie "the increase of
libertinism, fostered in its growth by tho in
decent periodicals and paMications with which
the land hai boon flooded."
A Man has just died in New Bedford, Mass.,
who has boon in business in tho samo apart
ments CI years. An instance like this in this
restlos?, hustling land of curs may be sat down
alt romarkablo indeed.
Tub stock of the horse car railroad in Now

A young lady of Anderson, S. C, declined an

ALISEBT LEA FIRE UU»3.
Scouufbredly Attempt to Doatroy the Town
by Fire—lacendiarisia Rampant—Engiue
Disabled, etc.
I Special to tha Gl»ba.|
Albbbt Lea, Minn., Dec. 10.— Daring
the past few Jdays there has bean quite an
excitement in this city owing to fire buc-s
attempts. Tharsday morning last at 1 a.
m., an attempt was made to fire the two
story building of N. L. Kelson, occupied
as saloon on first floor by G. Pixfcham
■ and seoond floor as dwelling. Fortunately
the smoke awakened the hired girl, who
1 awakened the Pinkham brothers, and by
' great exertion the fire was extinguished by
' taam and soma neighbors without oalling
1 oat the ire engine. The fire was undoubt
edly the work of a fire bug, as a quantity
i of rags saturated with benzine were dis
. •©▼• red. A hoi« had been bored in the
, Biding through whioh oil had been poured.
. Oa Sunday morning, the 9th, at about 3
- a.m., tke fire alarm called out the engine
' and it was found that the addition to the
• rear part of A. Wiegand's saloon was on
» fire. Kerosene had been poured on
I -•• side of the building, also on the roof,
. bnt owing to the damp weather that
_, had prevailed for the presiding two days,
. ignition waa vary slow, and by dint of hard
labor it was got under control before any
very serious damage was sustained. About
r tn* time the blaze was under control the
t engine for the first time in the many fires
it has battled with gave out. The remain
ing few charred'- embers were easily
qaonched with pails. On examination of
the engine the same evening it was discov
ered that some - dastard, presumably the
■ fire bag, had run .a : crowbar through the
- suction pipe, thereby making it impossible
- to keep sufficient water in the boiler. Had
the fiend aoocoeded in his attempt there is
• hardly any doubt but a serious loss of ' life
- would have occurred, as both buildings
J were occupied in the second : stories and
1 were closely adjacent to other buildings
3 oenpied in second stories tas resiienoes.
i Indignation is very high, and if the mis
- croaat ia caught '\ it -, will ; undoubtedly be
1 short prayer and tight rope, with a loss of
- breath to somebody at present - unknown.

[Special Telegram to the Globe.] »
Chicago, Dec. 11.—At the opening to- 1
lay there was no trace of yesterday's enor- 1
nous boom in the speculative list. Every
;hing was lower than the prices establish- c
3d on call, but with the possible exception
of provisions were fairly steady. Specu- i
ation did not start out very active. The ,
jountry is either staying out of the market <
3r is coming in with timid orders to sell, I
rhe bulls are still confident that every- i
thing points their way. "Now for in- <
stance" said one this noon, a great many
people expected a break to-day. They
said, . "Oh, there is always a break
liter a boom" but it did not come. Things
simply took a rest, but everything evened _
up without the expected reaction and you ,
will see it go a little higher next time. •<
In the nfarket for wheat there was a fair (
3egree of activity to-day, and while prices _
were somewhat unsettled the general tone _
was weak, and at the close December was
about 1c Tower than at 1 o'clock yesterdcy. ,
January 1c lower, February lj£c lower and ,
May IJjjO lower. There was some irregu- _
larity in the fluctuations of tha session
covering a range of about 1)40. The open- _
ing was about %o below yesterday's (
closing at 1 o'clock, sold irregularly up ,
%o to %c, but finally became very heavy, .
chiefly in consequence of the break in ,
corn, and fell 1)40 from the highest point,
cht-.uged some and closed easy. The re- ,
ceipts were smaller yet. On the call tho
market was only moderately active and
offerings fair. Prices ruled a shade lower
and trading was principally in May.
In the market for corn a large business
was transacted, but aggregate trad
ing not co large as yesterday.
Fluctuations were very frequent
but withal there was less excitement than
yesterday. Yesterday afternoon influenced
by full deliveries of corn on December
contracts, the market broke off fully lo on
the afternoon call. This morning it open
ed stronger and after some slight fluctu
ations prices advanced about _?^o. Later
under free offerings the market declined
l@l%c for the various deliveries and
finally closed about l^o iower for Decem
ber, l,^o lower for January and lo lower
for May than the closing at about 1 o'clock
yesterday. There was more disposition to
realize, and on each bulge the offerings to
sell were very large. Receipts were small.
On call there was. fair demand and cfi'er
in_js liberal. Prices were firmer and %@
%o higher. Trading was principally in
May.
Oais were very unsettled owing to 'i„
receipts. Cash and near futures were in
gocd demand early and sold higher, but
tho demand subsided, and other markets
being easier the market became depressed
declined and closed lower. May did not
show much strength. The sample trade
wa3 light. Buyers have held ofi' since the
j late advance, and receivers find It expedi
; ent to let consignments of the better
j grades go to store, On call tho demand
I was moderate and prices easier. Trading
j was in May.
Cash rye was'unchanged in prices. Fu
[ tares ware f>drly active. The market j
j opened with fair buying orders, and there I
*■» 3i@Mc advance. Longs, it
j wab saia, sold quite freely. Sample lots
• were quiet. On call the demand was
\ moderate and prices steady with sales in
January.
Barley was hardly as firm on holding up
to the prices established yesterday, with
nearly a dead market for samples and
only the lowest prices could tempt a buyer
to pßrohase, and this was having its influ
ence or not in bringing about a depressed
tone. No. 2 cash sold slow. Samples were
more thanusnally dull and many c^.ri are
being placed in store as unsalable on track
with home buyers suffered. On call it was
rather quiet ai,d prices steady. Trading
was about divided between January and
February.
In flour a quiet market was noticeable,
and saios were light with home buyers not
j bidding for any quantity and shippers
and exporters were out of the trade, and
iaud exporters were out of to fair grades',
taking little beyond low to fair grades,
which can be had at reduced prices and on
forced Bellini/. Rye flour slow. Back
wheat flour end all millelnffa doing well.
In provisions quite an active busi
ness was done, but on unsettled
feeling prevailed daring the greater por
tion of the session on 'change and prices
ruled with marked irregularity. Specu
lators tiaded with considerable freedom.
Shippers were inclined to do only a mod
erate bueiaees, as auiaide parties are glow
to pay current prices. Foreign advices
ware decidedly more favorable to holders,
and Liverpool quotations were advanssd
Is 9d on lard and Is 630,2 i on bacon,
wails pork was unchanged. East
ern markets were without materi
al change. The receipts of
product wero moderately large and tho re
ceipts unasually heavy, particularly of
meats. Daring the early part of the day
an easy feeling prevailed and lower prices
were accepted, but during the - middle of
the session a steadier market was exhibited
and a portion of the decline was recovered.
Toward the close the feeling was easier
and closed tame. Considerable interest
was manifested in the market for
mess pork, and trading was quite active.
An unsettled feeling prevailed, however,
and prices fluctuated considerably. The
market opened rather weak at 10@20c de
cline, and a farther reduction of 10(ijl2_^o
was submitted to. Later the market was
stronger and prices rallied 10@20o, but
settled back again 30 35c and closed
steady. The shipping demand was light.
On call the demand was rather light, bet
prices were steady. Sale* were confined
to the February and May options.
The lard market exhibited considerable
activity, bat the market was rot very
strong. Prices on the whole range declined
15g25c per 100 pounds and ruled ea*y to
the close. The offerings were free and the
demand active. Inquiry on shipping ac
count was moderate. On call the inquiry^
was moderately active and
prices a trifle lower. Sales
I were in February. A good trade
1 was reported in the market for short rib
tides. OSeringß were moderately large.
. The v inquiry was fairly active. Prioet
: fluctuated considerably within a moderate
ange, and ruled 15® 30c lower per 100
bs. The shipping demand was moderate.
)n call it was rather quiet and prices with
int material change. Trading was in
Fanuary and February.
It was rumored yesterday that the wheat
ihortage of Illinois alone tor this year is
rery nearly equal to the whole visible sup
ply. People who take that view of
he case may very well
je excused if they are
lot scared by the magnitude of the latter.
Parties along the Dcs Moines and Ft.
Dodge, (la.) railway say that buyers are
paying 250 per per bushel Jfor corn, bat
will only take about one-fifth of what is
)ffered them, going through the farmer's
wagons and sorting out that which is good
caving the poor stuff to be carried back
mmc.
. A telegraph operator said that ester
lay's business was the largest handled by
me companies since the McGeoch failure,
ibont 1,100 messages were received by
the Western Union company for points
not in direct communication with the
chamber of commerce, which was some
thing very unusual. The interest in the
rapid changes in prices yesterday was evi
dently very wide spread and intense.

[Special Telegram to the Globe.]
New Yoke, Dec. 11.There were tome
stocks made to appear firm for a few
moments this morning, evidently to assist
the selling movement which followed, and
continued with an occasional let up into
the afternoon hours. Large blocks of
stocks were thrown upon the market re
gardless of prices. The declines in many
cases were quite serious, there
was much excitement and the
feeling was decidedly feverish.
During the day Oregon Transcontinental
touoh6d 3'J?4_, Union Pacific ~j 4 . C, 13. &
Q. 120, Northwestern 116^, ' St, Paul 96,
and Oregon railway 105. Many ethers
were off over 1 per cent. The sellers of
Oregon Transcontinental stated that the
dividend would certainly be passed and
disposed of the etock with a will. The
rallies near the last were rather feeble and
the feeling seemed to be that the bears
would probably depress prices still more
tomorrow.
The following earnings are announced
for the first week in December:
Alton, increased $15,000; St. Paul
$69,000; Northwestern $68,000 and Oiat-ha
$25,000. The consummation of tho tri
partite agreement between the Union Pa
cific, Rock Island and St. Paul, war? gener
ally known this morning, but Wall street
is still unwilling to believe that any seri
ous trouble is imminent. Tho lowa pool
stocks resisted the decline very stubborn
ly. . Union Pacific went down more readi
ly, while the Villard stocks daring the
morning were the weakest on the lisK It
was known that the Rock Island com
pany, had given notice of with
drawal from the lowa pool and after this
prices were steadily declared. There is a
very large short interest in the market,
which acts as a prop to prices and presents
a precipitate decline. The fall details of
this bipartite agreement are not made
public, but if it is that is epresenl dto
be it is not easy to discover any encour
agement for the bulls. A disastrous war
of rates seems inevitable, which will
largely reduce the earnings.
