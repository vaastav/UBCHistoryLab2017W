THE NEW STATE SENATE.
The new senate ot Missouri will not
Iobo anything in ability and dignity by
tbe recent election. Some well kuow
and valuable members will retire, but
tbe standard of intelligence and integri
ty baa been maintained In tbe new
body. Among tbe recently elected
senators we note tbe following :
Maj. James N. Bradley, of Bates
county, has had experience in former
legislative bodies, aud has a deserved
repntation as a very intelligent, well
informed legislator. He is a farmer
bat has been much in public life and is
as well posted in public affairs as any
man in tbe state.
Mr. Charles F. Cochran, the newly
elected senator from the St. Joseph
district, will come to the senate with
laurels already won in another slate
He is an eminent lawver, an editor of
state reputation, and an orator of great
eloqueuce.
Mr. Eapeuschied, of St. Louis, is
gentleman of fine ability, and is
proper representative of the worth and
intelligence of the commercial roetrop
oils of tbe atate. His colleague, Mr.
Stone, is one of tbe rising lawyers of
St. Louis and is as well known for bis
sterling integrity as for bis ability.
Mr. Hendrickson, ol Jasper, Mr
Rouner of Knox, Starke of Cooper
Weeks of Callaway, and Colley of
Newton are strong men strong iu
tellectually as well as in integrity
They are leaders in thought and enter
prise in their respective communities
and wllllntelligently direct legislation
affecting the agricultural and Industrial
Interests.
Messrs. Stephens and Mines come
with reputations as flue lawyers and
excellent business men. Dr. Newberry
will impress legislation with his expert
ence, courage and earnestness. Some
of (he tew republicans elected to the
senate are men ot more than average
ability.
Taken all together the next sonat
will be a most reputable, dignified and
conservative body of gentlemen.
PABNELL'S DEGRADATION.
The case ot Charles Stuart Parnell
onoe more demonstrates tbe fact that
tbe regard for private morals is greater
than any admiration for tbe individual
based upon bis public works. No man
bad a greater hold upon the hearts of
his countrymen than did Parnell. His
Intelligent and heroic work in behalf of
Irish liberty made him the Idol of his
countrymen, and tbe admiration of all
liberty loving people. Bat tbe magnlfl
cent repntation bnllded upon the aflec
tiona of tbe people and tbe achieve
mentt of his splendid intellect fell to
tbe earth nlterly demolished when it
wat supported only by a rotten founda
tion of depraved private morals. All
honorable publio reputation is supposed
to bave a solid basis of personal worth
Tbe two are inseparable. Tbe public
expects consistency. Tbe preacher can
not preaob the doctrine of Christ and
practice the precepts of tbe devil. Tbe
statesman can have no honored place
who preaohes the purest political prin
elples and practices tbe immoralities
that sap tbe foundations of our social
structure, and debase the aancity ot
domettio life. Parnell ceased to be
great man and a worthy leader when
he ceased to practice the private
virtues. Tbe cause with which he was
so Ittimately identified will miss his
genius, bat It will be tbe gainer in tbe
end, becaosa It will also miss the shame
hit private life would reflect upon
ust cause. His Intellect can easily bo
supplied, but without bit utter over
throw from leadership the pernicious
nest of bit example would have been
more fatal than all tbe efforts of
Ireland's enemies. The publio Is not
prone to pry too closely Into tbe private
lives of eminent statesmen. On tbe
contrary it is disposed to be charitable
to 'he weaknesses which only affect tbe
Individual. ' But a protest which Is of
itself eternal condemnation noes no
ben genius lends itt potency to the
desecration of divine law and to social
debasement. Tbe flat is inexorable
that there can be no enduring fame
unless it be feunded on private virtue.
Mr. and Mrt. B. M. Yost, of Jeffer
son city, suffered the loss of their little
daughter. Marguerite, one day last
week. Mrt. Yost is the niece of the
Rev. John W. Dunn, a former rector of
Christ church, this city, and she and
her husband bave many friends here
who will symhathlze with them In t heir
affliction. Marguerite waa a sweef
little blue-eyed bad. not qnlte two
years old, and In her spotless innocency
hat been transplanted to the glorious
garden of the Master, there to await in
the spirit ever an Infant, tbe arrival of
her loved ones of earth.

The Globe-Democrat on last Satur
day said: "It Is said that tbe presi
dent's message will make about thirteen
columns. Thit signifies, we fear, that
be It going to talk too mncb about
things which, as Carlyale nsed to say,
It wonld be Interesting not to meu
lion.' " It certainly was a propbet
that lime, for tbe democrats could not
want a better document to go to tbe
country on in 1S92 than this very same
president's message.
There will toon be three vacancies
on tbe circuit bench ol tbe state to be

Us been in session at Clinton this
week.
Mr. rarnell, in a manifesto, publish
ed last Saturday, reveals the secrets of
an interview with Mr. Gladstone in
which be says that gentleman said
IrUh representation would have to be
reduced ; that land tenure was a ques
tion to be held from the proposed
Irish parliament; that the Irish con
stabulary would have to be left lo
imperial control, and that a period of
ten or twelve years was suggested as
the limit of the time during vbich the
appointment of fudges and resident
magistrates should be retained iu the
bands of the imperial authority. Mr.
Gladstone the next day denies ever
having made the statements, or any
thing like them. Mr. Parnell also
endeavored to incite Irish sentiment
against Mr. Gladstone, by praying not
to be thrown to tbe English wolves. It
looks a little as If Mr. Parnell were
willing to risk all in order to turn at
tention away from the O'Shea scfhdal.
We find tills in tbe personal column
of the Globe-Democrat: "Mr. Joseph
B. Shelby, of Butler, Mo., registered
at the Laclede last night. A Globe
Democrat reporter interviewed him
respecting the minor that his father,
Gen. Joe Shelby, intended to enter the
senatoripl contest against Senator Vest.
Mr. Shelby said: 'My father will not
permit his name to be ineutioned in
that connection. It is generally known
throughout the state that he does not
indorse Senator Vest.' Col. ,I.L. Pace,
of Butler, was with Mr. Shelby. He
said, respecting tbe report: 'As an inti
mate friend of Gen. Shelby, I am pre
pared to state that he will not euter the
senatorial race. Iu fact, he will sail
for Europe with his daughter about the
1st of January, to bo gone for several
months.'
Prof. Thurston in bis Forum article
on "Electricity as the Motor of the Fu
ture'' among other things says: "I
have very little question that where
railways are carrying large numbers of
passengers on short routes, as on our
elevated systems of road where, if
ever, we may reach enormously high
speeds tbe electric motor, or some ad
vanne even on that latest marvel of in
vention and engineering, must come
into use.' Heat, light and electricity
will then conspire in that coming revo
lutlon which shall combine tor us tbe
tbe speed of the biid, the comlorts of
home and the safety of the hermit's
cell. And what must come will
come."
"Tbe report of the commissioner of
pensions shows that 21,000 pensioners
died last year. This death rate is likely
to Increase in each succeeding year to
an alarming extent equal, at least, lo
tbe number ot new names added to the
rolls, and therefore the pension ex pen
ditures will not be materially enlarg
ed." It has been some years, Mr. O.
D.. since Mr. Garfield said that when
tbe pensions reached f,uuu,uuu per
annum they should recede, yet they
have continued to increase until thit
year tbey will be over $135,000,000
With a republican administration you
would have been no better propbet
than was Mr. Garfield.
Tbe Globe-Democrat said last Satur
day: "The friends of the federal elec
tion bill are mistaken if tbey think that
tbe people are any more favorably dis
posed towards said measure than they
were when it was put aside in obedience
to their protest. They do not desire
any legislation of that sort, nor can tbe
republican party afford to take such a
step under present circumstances." On
Monday Mr. Harrison recommended
the force bill more virulently than ever.
The Australian election law, at pros
ent applicable only to towns ot five
thousand inhabitants or more, has
worked so well in Missouri, that there
is a demand almost general for il
application to tbe entire slato and to
all elections, and there Is little douVt
that tbe law will be amended to con
form to tbe demaud. Tbe country boss
as well as the ward boodler must go.
Tbe old Idea that one could starve to
death in a day or two's fasting will
have to give way. There was Tanner I
Mow we nave succi; and tbe papers
only the other day contained the in
formation that Benjamin Wright, aged
82, fasted five months be for s be went
to his fathers. This last story is from
Trenton, N. J.
Mr. Quay proposes to slick to his
chairmanship of the national republican
committee, and to hold bis tongue.
All the worse for the republican party.
Now let them mount a tattooed man as

Ii is understood that there will be a
meeting of the state warehouse aud
railroad commission at St. Louis on the
15th inst., to fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of Hon. Jasper N.
Burks, receutiy elected to the stale sen
ate. Nobody but a Kansas man would be
guilty of removing headstones from
soldiers' graves and then putting ip
bills for supplying their places, but
Benjamin Homer, of Abilene, Kansas,
bas been arrested for such a crime.
Mr. Mueller, of St. Charles, having
decliued, because of sickness in bis fam
ily, the governor has appointed Mr.
Weeks, of Jasper, as the republican
member ot tbe committee to settle with
the auditor and (re isurer.
It Is understood that Mr. Henry W.
Ewing, for many years clerk ot the
state supreme court, will not be a
candidate for reappointment, and in
consequence there are a large number
of applicants for the place.
Mr. Harrison in his message indorses
the McKinley bill, insists on the force
bill, and laughs at freo silver. Mr.
Harrison evidently Is a daisy, even if
the bees don't know it .
Tbe greatest rebuke to Reed's con

There is very littlo to be said about
Mr. Harrison's message. There is noth
ing striking In it, except the wonder
ful density cf the man that could neith
er bo made to learn or forget anything
by the political revolution ol Novem
ber 4. Ho stands by the McKinley bill
which the people repudiated ; he lauds
the force bill, and makes a puerile and
untruthful defence of the measure,
when he should know that an immense
majority of the people coutemu it as a
partisan aud dangerous measure, lie
ridicules free coinage ot silver. He
tries to explain the Barruudia affair
Indeed, be does all those things which
be ought not to do; and leaves undone
all those things which he ought to do,
Not to speak of the dead level of the
document as a literary production, it is
no mere figure of speech to say that it
will prove to be a formidable club with
which to break republican heads in 1892
The baudsoinest lloral tribute ever
tendered any member of congress was
placed upon the desk of Hon. Clifton
R. Ureckenrldge last Mouday, when he
was sworn in anew as a representative
iu the nlty-lirst cougresa. The roses
were fashioned to the shape of eqnl-
balauced scales. Speaker Reed did not
admire it.
The Kansas papers eav that Senator
Ingalls will soon startle congress by
recanting his political faith iu the Mc
Kinley bill and tbe demonetization of
silver. Such recantatiou would bo a
big bid, but a humiliating one, for the
aliauce vote for senator. But his name
is Dennis, nevertheless.
It matters little whether congress
heeds or disregards tbe warning of the
alliance concerning tho force bill. A
little more infamous legislation here
and there will make no difference with

Hannibal Journal: In suggesting
that Wm. II. Hatch, our distinguished
representative and honored fellow-citi
zen, should bo called by bis party to
the high office of the speaker of tbe
national house of representatives, we
feel that we are but giving expression
to the wishes of many thousand of dem
ocrats in every state and territory of
the American union.
Carroll ton Democrat : While con
gratulating tbe democracy, and tbe peo
ple of Missouri, over our returu to an
"old time" democratic majority it
should not be forgotton that one factor
which played no unimportant part in
bringing It about was tbe wise and just
administration of our popular governor.
No campaign thunder was t'ouud by the
opposition in any official action ot Dave
Francis.
Knox County Democrat : Not two
years ago by something over three
months, tbe republicans took charge of
the government, finding a big surplus
in (he treasury. Siuce then our re
ceipts have constantly increased and
yet il is now necessary to consider how
we may increase the Income of the gov
eminent, in order to raise tbe monoy
to meet its annual expenditures. That
tells tbe story.
Greenfield Aavocate: As a defaul
tcr, but successful republican campaign
manager, Matthew Stanley Quay was
"Senator Quay" with the republicans
aud was lionizrd by his parly. As a
lailure however, he is to tbe republicans
and democrats alike "Defaulter Quay"
and there is no man so despicable to tbe
parly which so recently lauded him to
the skies. Thus the ops and downs of
political prestige are marvelous.
The Pulaski Co, Democrat: An
Abilene (Kas.) man recently helped lo
settle up th9 estate of his father, who
died in the stale of New York, and al
though there were several thousand
dollars involved and tbe property was

entire cost of administration was only
thirty cents for postage and paper
The property was divided into equal
portions, and all heirs took, their choice.
1'aln.yra Spectator: Hannibal now
boasts of a romance in real life. Last
week a lady got off tbe train at the
union depot and, walking up to a by
stander, asked him it he knew anything
of one Thomas Bissell. It happened
that Thomas Bissell waa tbe man ad
dressed and so informed the inquirer,
wbeu she staled that she was his wife,
from whom bo had been separated for
twenty years. He recognized her and
immediately took her to bis heart and
home. They are now living together
as happy as clams at high tide.
Monroe City Democrat: Miss Irene
Iloyt, the heiress of a New York mil
lionaire, has taken up a curious fad.
She is a collector a collector of corner
lots. She has picked up a number of
flue pieces of property in New York,
and bas made many such investments
in other citios. Wherever a comer lot
seems worth adding to her interesting
collection she always becomes its pur
chaser, no matter what the price. Her
highest delight is found in such acqui
sitions. Miss Hoyt is perhaps the first
collector who has made comor lots a
speciality, but there is no reason why
her inexpensive and amusing fad should
not be as popular as tbe pursuit of old
coins, autographs und postago stamps.
Hardin News: Missouri bas almost
everything under the sun that is worth
