HANNA AT WASHINGTON
He Has Opened Headquarters
There From lieed the
Next Speaker
From Our Regular Correspondent
Washington Dec 7th 189U
The reigu of MarkHanna has
opened in Washington He is
attracting more attention from
Repnblican Senators and Rep
resentatives than the opening
of Congress and the Presidents
message combined and he
seems to be greatly enjoying it
Congress has no favois to dis
tribute at this seasiou while
Hanna has been by the bar
rel The republicans who have
been reelected to congress want
0 work Hauna for their friends
aud those who will cease to
draw Congressional salaries 011
the 3rd of March are auxious
to make connection with other
public salaries at the earliest
possible moment thereafterand
they racognize the necessity of
getting on good terms with
Hanna in order to do so Han
na has no particular respect or
reveience for anything except
monpy He went through the
pretense of listening to protects
by the local republicans against
the selection of a gold democrat
for chairman of the Inaugura
tion UomnUtee but he never
has any idea of going back on
tliB promise he had made to
the clique of millionaire real
estate speculators to select thn
man they had named for the
place both as a reward for his
campaign contribution and as a
meaus of putting a man under
their control in a way to get
into the good graces of McKiu
lny and into a local office where
he can inliuiiitce the expendi
ture of the district of Columbia
funds in a waj to ben iit their
investments If I wanted any
thing from Hanna I sfiould
hunt up the millionaire who
had contiibuted to his commit
tee for a backer instead of
bothering with political in
flence MarK regards politics
as simply a question of money
and not of principles and 1
make the prediction right now
now that the millionaires of the
country will be far more in
fluential with the McKinley ad
ministration than the politic
ians N
How to do nothing while
pretending to be trying to do
something will be the motto of
the republican leader during
the present session of Congress
It has been fully decided at
Canton that an extra session
of congresB shall Me called to
pass a tariff bill and that noth
ing must be done at this nes
sion to give the republican op
ponetits Of aii extra session of
whom there are many an ex
cuse for saying there is no
necessity for one Uader the
ciirnmstances this will not be
a difficult task The regular
appropriation bills can eanily
be manipulated so as to take
up all the time of the short
session

of the Cabinet and doubt MACEO OUTGENERALS
less of many of Mr Cleve
lands admirers in private life
But it has had about the same
effect upon Congress as a whole
as the distribution of a batch
of temperance or religious tracts
would have had It has been
received with indifferencev It ia
neither praised nor denounced
to any marked extent although
eome features of it may a little
later on the be made the text
for some interesting speeches
Tom Reed is today the most
independent man in the repub
lican parly McKinley heeds
his support far more than he
needs anything that McKinley
will have to give and nobody
knows it any better than the
bigman from Maine who will
be elected Speaker of the next
House without raising a fiuger
although the McKinleyites
would give much tor some
scheme that would enable them
to down him but they dare uot
make an open move in that di
rection
Those enemies of the demo
cratic party who had somehow
most probably because they
wished it gotten the idea that
Senator Hill intended to at
tempt to knock the botton out
of things by making a speech
in the S9uate in which he would
pay all his political and some
of his personal debts by telling
things that ought not to be told
and saying things which were
best left unsaid have been
barking up the wrong tree
Senator Hill may think he has
political wrongs to avenge but
it can be staled upon the veiy
highest authority that of him
selfthat he hasnt the slight
eat idea of assuming the role of
a public avenger on the iloor
of the Senate and that instead
of trying to widen the breach
between democrats he will en
deavor to the extent of his in
fluence to bring about a better
state of party feeling
Representative Berry of Ky
whowas reelected has this to
say of the election in that state
On a fair and square vote
Kentucky would have gone for
Bryan by at least 25000 major
ity But money was used with
out stint and it is one of the
most potent factors in modem
politics I here is always a pur
chasable element and when
money is as plentiful as it was
in Kentucky this year there is
no trouble in getting mercena
ry recruits But the democrata
elected seven out of the eleven
Congiessmen in spite of the
corrupt methods of the opposi
tion and two years hence the
democratic ticket will Bweep
the state
WEYLER
The Wily Cuban Commandef
Maneuvers His Troops to
t
Good Advantage
Havana Dec 8 The exact
whereabouts of General Wey1
ler are not known but he is
believed to be hunting fof
Maceo in the mountains in the
extreme eastern part ol Finaf
del Rio while the insurgent
chief has seemingly doubled
on his tracks turned the flank
bf the Spanish general and
passed in his rear in the direc
tion of this city crossing the
military line at will and pos
sibly being by this time in the
vicinity of the capital of Cuba
If Maximo Gomez has car
ried out the plan attributed of
passing westward to the sup
port of Maceo a junction of
the two main bodies of the in
surgent forces may be expe f
ed shortly
Nothing appears to be
known of the strength of the
insurgent force with Antonio
Maceo in this province In
fact it was not until the news
was being passed from person
to person in the streets that
the authorities would give a
half admission as to the truth
of the report that Maceo had
crossed the military line This
it is believed will change the
whole campaign and import
ant events may occuf within a
soorr time There is no doubt
that the insurgents have re
cently increased in numbef
about the capital The stray
bands of twenty or thirty ban
dits have now swollen to pro
portions ol insurgent forces of
from 20000 to 40000 men
It seems to be admitted and
believed that Maceo will strike
before Weyler can hurry back
from Pinar del Rio Indeed
it is currently reported that
the captain general has been
wounded in an engagement
with the insurgents before the
