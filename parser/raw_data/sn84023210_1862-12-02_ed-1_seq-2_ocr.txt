Indian Atrocities at tha West.
Since the Iodiun war at the West has been
brought to a ctoo, and the leading uctors in tho
Moody outrages therein enacted, to the number
;! about four hundred, have been secured and
trieif t heir crimes, the lublic have, for the
lirst tiie, fccen put ia poMtcsaion of authentic
ovidenr3..Qu;teracing most, or all, the horrid do
!ails or this demon-like outbreak o the Sioux
fndiarvsi. Tiiesc atrocities, aa dtvoluped during
li trials of The perpetrators, have not their
parallel, probably, in the whole history of In
dian warfare. The whole number of mm, wo
taen aud children that havo wet death, or fatee
i-.voree iharnleath, by the bullets, arrows, toma
ivxv.i and brutsl pasnions of tho fiend?, has been
over six hundred. In King Philip's war, which
affords perhaps lhe ne.arebt parallel, about the
same number, it v true w.to slain. But King
Philip's war left examples of no such barbarities
as this. There, no women wero ravished, and
lew children slain. These Sioux have long been
known B8 the most ruthlew, bold, active and
implacable of all the red tribes 'of the West.
Their physical strength t.eniwell to correspond
with their c-jutage an 1 ferocity. Among the
details of the terrioio harvest of death they
!,Hve teen reaping in Minnesota, several instan
ces are cited wl.t.ra they have sent arrows with
such amazing force as to p.vss oinpletely
through the bodies of their victims, and ono
whom the same arrow pawed clear through one
tnd slew a' second one standing in the range.
This seems incredible. Dut it will eem lesi so,
when the crcat strenirth of their bows anl the
peculiar manner in whieh they discharge their
.irrows, are better undorsuiod. When about to
bring down any important game, whether buf
falo or man. they throw themselves on their
Iv.cka in the shape of a half moon, plice both
:'oet on tho centre of the bow, and, raping ths
bow string with both hands, and Btvetcliing
themselves with a power enough, probably, ta
raise five hundred woigiit, bring the heel of the
arrow, kept in line by one too and ono thumb,
to the eye, glance over it, and send it :;u its
almost unerring mesag; o' death.
Thc four hundred Indiao prisoners have
icon tried, con vie tod, and seutoncoi to be
hanged. And there, unexpectedly, the matter
;s allowed to rcn. The officer having them in
charge sends a ui-ssag 10 the President aking
his consent to their exeedtion. Itut the Prosi"
dent says no don't execute them, except one or
two of the loaders. This interference of the
President is severely denounced by tho people
along tho Western tiordoM ; and, it is said, they
liave extensively leag'ied together to rush in and
"rian them cjt.victed turLiiers, 10 the last man,
on tin: lirst attempt on the part of the govern
ment to liberate them. Most pople, probably,
at tho first blush, feel inclined to sympathize

Mr. Fletcher of dvendish, said :
Mr. Syf.ikar : The melancholy duty of an
nouncing the death of Mr. Weed has been im
pressively performer), but my silence on this pen
sion would not only do violence lo my own 'eel
ing"., hut would be in strange contra-t with ihe
sorrowful emotions that swell the bosoms of all.
We mourn the ions of a valued friend and broth
er. For a citizen, friend, and colleague we mourn
and it i- fifing and proper that we should jive
some recorded evidence of our sympathy and
grief lor the sudden and appalling death of our
Iriend. I have not ai isen, Mr. Speaker, fer the
purpose of eulogy or panegyric, but to express
my deep sorrow for the loss of a worthy colleague,
and to pay some poor tribute to his memory.
How hVeliug and ev.iiieeent is the life of man I
He who was moving a i ong us but y esterday, is
motionless in death ; that voice to which we lis
tened, is hushed lorever : thai home, so la'e the
scene of family jy, is shrouded in gloom ;
there, hearts are crushed and bleeding! How
like a vapor is human li e ! X!an i here to-day ;
to-morrow knowtth him no?. As the transient
grass, " in tho mottling it fl iuri-heth, in the even
ing it is cut down and withered)." Let us draw
profiiiaole instruction from this s' leinn and im
pressive admonition, so that when our summons
sloill come, we; msy te found ready.
Mr. Ihinton said he had enjoyed an opportu
nity of becoming acquainted with tho deceased
d iriri the I ist session, In matters of legislation
be had freq ien'ly had conciliation w ith him, and
had ooticeU his uniform politeness and urbanity.
He ii.id never thought of the d.e sed a tn re
liable to sudden dcnh than others. Suddenly
sir.cken down while in lhe uppurent enjoy
meot of health, his decease was a ssleo n
tid monition to those associated wiih him. It
should iemi.nl all, how vmiii and unworthy
are t'.e rivalries and contt ntit ns which arise from
emuIa ioD among men. It should teach a les
son of charity and good will, and increase the de
sire to live u life ol honor and purity, in this
world, an I to lay up tras:ires hi the wor d to
come. It was eminently fitting on such an occa
sion, lo olfer, as provided by tho resoiuiions,ym
pithy ai d winds of condolence to the frienis and

"Waste of Mind in Politics.
In a free country like onrs there is a pro
diginus waste of mind in the excitemc-.it and
discussions of ptrty pulitici. The mental
efforts devoted often to a gubernatorial, and
especially a presidential election would be
si,lfijietit, if turned into the channel of lit-
craturc and scierife, to rai?c our couotry
once to th highest rank on the scale of know
ledge. Did these periodical excitements pre
pare the niinl te engage with greater arioi
in literary puiiuits, they ought not to be
vtccd a.s a wasta of intellect ; but their
tendency is decidedly the reverse, N.) men
arc so little likely to become eminent in 6ci
ence or literature as strong political partisans
The organs of combativencss aud sell-esteem
booh become so ciccssivcly developed as to
stifle the reflective faculties:. In few eases
indeed these electioneering battles must be
fought to ?ave the liberties of the country ;
but in general, an impartial aa uncommitted
man will see that there is scarcely anything
to choose between the rival candidates as to
ijcneral cha.acter. Ar.d when he perceives
how sharp and furious the contest becomes
