fn regard to tho resumption of specie pay
ments the language of tho report iaaafollowa:
The imnortant duly Impoggd on this depart
menl br the Keaiimptfon set. approved January
14. 1878. haa been ateailily pursued during tha
paat year. The plain purpose of tho act la to
semira to all iBieraStg and nil classes the Isino
flts of a sound currency, redeemable In coin,
with the least poeaihla dlaturlsinoa of existing
rights and contracts. Three of Its provisions
Inn been aulsytnntlally carried Into execution
by the gradual substitution of frsctlonal coin
for fractional ourroncy, by the free coinage of
Sold, and by free banking. There remalnannly
is completion of prainrationa for resumption
In ooln on tho first day ot January. 1870. and its
maintenance thereafter upon tho basis ot 01
lating law.
At the dale of my annual report to Congress
in December. 1877. It was deemed necessary as
a preparation for nsvttmpHon to accumulate In
tbe Treasury s coin reserve of st least forty per
ni . nf the amount ot Vnitcd Stste notes out
standing. At that Hnm It waa anticipated that
atanding. At Hint lime It was anticipated that
under the provisions of Ihe ftisxumption ait the
volume of United Stste note would be reduced
to 1,100.000.000 by Ibo 11 day of January. 1870. or
aoon thereafter, and that a reserve in coin nf
812O.iiini.0OO wouldthen bo aufllolont. Congre.
however. In view of the strong popular feeling
agalnat a contraction of the currency, by Iho not
approved May 31. 1878. forbade Hie retirement
of any Vnltod Stste note after thnt dale, leav
ing the amount In circulation 814A.A8l.ulA.
I' pon the principle nf nnfety upon which the
department was acting, that forty per cent, of
coin was the smallest reserve upon which re
sumption could prudently Is commenced. It
became nnoeseei y to inerssse thu coin reserve
Pi ti t-
At the close of Ihe year 1877 thla coin reserve,
in excess of coin linbilllies. amounted to 883. -OI6.ll80.IHI.
of which I15.IHHI.IHM) wcro obtained
by the sale of four and a half por cent,, nnd 125.
(XH IsH) by the asle of four per oent. bonds, lha
residue tsdng sui plu revenue. Sulieuunlly.
on the I n I. lav ol April. 1878. the Secretary en
tered Into a contrnet with cerlnln bankers In
New York and Ixmdon for tlie snlo nl I'm '",
000 four nnd a half tier cent. Isvnds fur resump
tion purposes. The lainds wero sold at n pre
mium of one an 1 a hnlf i t cent, nnd . i . I
interest, lesa a eommlaalon of one-half of one
per oent. The contract has been fulfilled, and
tho net priKeeiie. I-Vj.Mhi.ihhi, hnve been psid
Inlo tha Treasury In gold coin. The 85 .VhI.ihhi
coin paid on the Halifax awnnl hnve MM
replaced tiy the sale of that sinoiint of
four per cent, bonds sold for resumption Puf
p.vaee making the nggregnte amount of tainda
sold lor these purpose I'.I5..Vhi (hhi. of which
IMjmOuO were four an. In hall per cent, bonds,
nnd I3u .Vhi.OOO four per cent, bonds. To this
has la.en lidded the surplus revenue from time
to time. Tim amount of coin itold In the Troaa
urv on the 2.1d day of November last. In excess
of coin sufficient to pay all accrued coin 1 last p 1 1 i -ties,
was 1141. 8H8.IU0, and constitutes the coin
PSBBrrs prepared for resumption purposes.
Tills sum will la; diminished somewhat on the
1st of January next by reason of the large
amount ot Interest accruing on that day In ex
cess of the coin revenuo received mennwltlle.
In anticipation of resumption, nnd iu view of
tba fmt that the i I ..: n of Culled Stale
notes Is mandatory only at the office of tlie As-
notee Is mnmlntory only at tlm otneo of tlm As
sistant Treasurer in Iho city of ROW fork, it
was deemed Important to eecuro tho co
operstinn of tlm nsaociabal banks of that
cly In Ihc ready collection of draft on
those hanks ami in the payment of
Treasury dralt held by them. A satisfactory
arrangement bus la-en madeby ynlck nil drafts
on the banks held bv tho Trensnry nro to
paid at the Clearing House, and all drafts on the
Treasury held by them nro to Is' paid to the
Clearing House at the office of the Asalstant
Treasurer. In l ulled statoa notes: and. after
the 1st of Jaminry. t'nitcd States not'-i aro to lie
received by them aa coin.
Kvery step In these preparations for resump
tion haa been aia-ouipanied with Increased
business and confidence. The invumulatlon of
coin, instead of Increasing Ita price, a
wss tenr-d br msny. bus steadily reduced its
premium in the market.
The current receipt Irom revenue arc luffl
ciet,l lo meet the current expenditure as well
as the accruing Interest on tho public dnbt.
Authority I conferred by the refunding BOt
to redeem lix isr cent, bonds, ss they be
come risileomnble. by tho pfoaaodd of the
ale of bonds 1,'arlng a lower rate of In
terest. The unfMU Slate! note redeemed
under the Ilosuiuplion act arc. therefore, llm
tie. i; means provided for we purchase of
bullion or coin with which to maintain resump
tion, but ehouid only ! paid "Ut when limy can
lai lined to replace nu t ijunl amount of coin
withdrawn from the resumption fund. They
mny.il is true. l. used for current purpoc
lite other money, but when ao used He ir pUtOO
is filled by money received from taxes or other
SOU rOCI ,,f revenuo.
Dy the act apprcrVedJunal, lfrTS, tho Secretary
of the Treasury is Butooriaed to constitute any
lUpetiutandent of a mint or assay, r of any
suss)' Hi " an assistant treasurer of the Timed
states tu receive gold coin orbulllon on deposit.
Ily Iho legislative Appropriation lull approved
July IU. 1878. the Secretary of the Treasury la
autnorl. od to Issue coin .vertifleate In payment
to depositors of bullion al the several mints snd
assay offieee ol the I'lilled States. These pro
visions, intended to secure to the pro lie "ers of
bullion more spoisly payment, will aa
csssarily bring into thu mini nml
Tress iry th" greai body of the preoloul
nmlals mined In the united States, and will
tend greHtly to tlm ensy and steady supply of
biilliou for coinage. UnltOU States notes, wuon
at nnr with com. will be readily r Ived for
bullion instead of coin certificates. After
resumption the distinction between Ooltt
and ended States notea should be, as
far as pra. unable, abandoned in llm cur
rent .affair of the uovarnipentl ami there
fore lio coin certificates should b" ill"d
exeept wharu expressly re.piired by the pro
vision ..f I w. aa in the ease of silver c.'i till 'ctes.
Tii" gold eeillficnt. s hitherto Issued by virtue
of the discretion conferred upon lite Sec

By existing law. customs duties and the In
terest ol llm public debt lire payable in coin,
and a poniog of thu dutlcn am specifically
pledged ns a special fund for the payment of the

upon tlm other. As we cannot. Willi due regard

Tlie Secretary is of the opinion that a change
ol Ihe law is not necessary to authorize this Jt.

toiua duties on and alb r tho llisi day of Janu
ary, 1878, While they arc redeemable an I are

day of January next, and while united Htatoi
Holes are redeemed at the Treasury, limy la- re
ceived the same as coin by the olll. is ..i this
ilepartinant in all payments in all par's of the
United status.
Wnon the Hcsutiipllon n 't passed, gold WB0

in paymsnt of all debts. That act ' pntamplated
reSUUlptb'li ill gold Colli only. No silver coin

The net approved Kcb. 2. IsTS. made a very im
portant ci.ang" in ourooinagoayttum, Tbooil
vcr dollar provided for waa made a legal lender
for all debts, public and priv ate, ex. . pi where
otlierwisc expressly silpulnteil in Hm coiitrimt.
Tlm law Itself clearly slo ws that tho silver
dollar wns not to supersede ling. Id dollar: nor
did Congress propose to adopt the single stand
ard of sliver, but only to create n biinetalli
slttiiilnrd of silver and gold of BQUOj value and
e.jual piircliaaing powori Congress, therefore,

tier montlli but did not limit Hm uggr-'gaie
amount, nor tbo period of time during which
this coinage hIioiiUI couliuue. Th" market
value of the silver in Ihe dollar nt the .lute
of the passage of the act was '.III cents In
gold coin. Now it Is about 8ti cents Iu gold
coin. II it was intended by Congress lo au pi

try, but in Kuropean couiuriea. hns established
Hint a certain auinuui of silver coin may bo.
maintained u circulation nl par with gold,
though of less intrinsic bullion value. It was,
no doubt, tlm Intention of Congress lo provide
B Opln In silver which would answer a multi
tude of the purposes of business life, without
banishing from oircuUUlou the established gold
ooln of Hie countryi TO accomplish this it ia

principle of flnsnoo. will become the solo ooln .

will circulate. If, howevor. the Issuo of ths sil
ver dollars Is llmitistl to an amount demanded
for circulation, there will be no dcproclntioa.
snd their convenient uso will koop liicm at pag

The amount of auch coin that can thus b
mnlntalnml at par with gold cannot ho fairly
pvatoii until roaumptlon Is accomplished. Ag
yet paper money has tieen deprecintisl. and sil
ver lollara being receivable for customs dues,
have naturally not entered Into general circula

of such duos, snd thus Hie only otToot of
the attempt nf tho department lo clroiilstn thosa
baa hen to diuiinlab the gold reve
nue. After resumption these coins will
circulate In nonldernbln aums for
amall payment. To tba exlont that i,'
auch demand will give employment to silver
dollars their use will be an aid to resumption
rather than a hindrance, hut If issued In ex
ec of audi demand they will at once tend to
disniaisi gold and become the aole standard,
and gradually, aa they Increase In number. Will
fall to thnir value aa bullion. Even the fear or
iiaplclon nf such sn excess tends to bsnlsh
gold, snd, if well established will esnsc s con
tinuous drain of gold until inipcrntive noons
lty will compel rcumption In ilver slone.
The serious effects ol audi a radical change In
our standards of value cannot la. exaggerated ;
and Ita poaalhllllT will greatly disturb confi
dence in resumption, ami mny make neeeaaary
larger reserves and further wale of tainda.
Tlio Secretary, therefore. eaniot!y Invokna
The Secretary, therefore, earnestly Invokes
Ihe nttentlon of Congre to thl obj"t. with a
view that either during the present or the next
session Hie amount of silver dollar to lie leaned
be limited, or their ratio to gold for coining
purposes be chsnged.
Oohl nnd ellver havo varied In value Irons
tinm to t line in the hlsbirr of nations, and lawa
havo be-1 . passed to meet this changing value.
In our country, by the act ol April 2. IT 2 tha
ratio between them waa fixed at one of gold tot , (
fifteen of silver. Ily tho net of June 28 .1834.
the rntlo was changed to one of gold to lixteaa ,
ofillver. Kor more than a century tho market
valuo ot the two metals liml varied between
those two ratios, mainly resting at Hint inc. I br
tho I-ntln nation, of one to fifteen nnd a half.
Hut we cannot overlook the fact that within
few yonrn. from causes frequently discussed In
Congress, A groat chango haa i urred in the
relative vnlue of the two nmtala. It would aoon
to lie expedient to recognize this controlling
fact uie tbut no nation alone can change bv a
oareful readjustment of tho legal ratio for eoln
agoof one to sixloen. so na to conform to the
relative market value of the two melnls. Tha ;
ratlna heretofore fixisl were alwnvi made with
that view, and. when mmle. did conform aa
near ai might be. Now that the production
and uae of the two metals havo greatly changed
In relative value, a corresponding change must ,
M made In Ihe coinage ratio. There ia n i
po ullnr force or aan tlou In tho present rntlo
that should make us In sllate to adopt another.
when. In the markets of the world. II ia proven
thnt such ratio I not now the true one. Ths
addition of OBn-tenth or onn-elghth to the thick
noes of Iho silver dollar would scarcely Isy per
ceived as an Inconvenience by llm holder, bill
would Inspire confidence, and add greatly to its
circulation. As prnva are now bnsed on I'nltcd
Slates iiole at pat witlig.dd.no disturbance of
values would result from the Changs,
It appears from tne r nt eonferooMO at
l'nrl. invited bv ua. Hint other nationa will not
join with u In fixing nn Internal! toil ratio,
ami that na"h country must adapt Its laws to its
OWn Policy, The tendency ol Into among com
meroial nation Is to the adoption of a single
aintnlsrd of gold and the Issue of silver for
fractional coin. We may. by ignoring this
tendency, give temporarily InerBBBM value to
the Mores of silver held Iu llcrmany and Kmncs
IBS Stoma 01 silver lulil ill i rranea
until our market abaorhsthem. but by adopting
a ailver slainlard as nearly e,jtiul to gold aa
priicth nhle we make a market for our largs
production ut silver, and furnish a full, honest
dollar thai will bo hoarded, transported, or clr

Aliko iiitereiteit In silver ami gold, ns the groat

Secure the largest use and circulation of both
