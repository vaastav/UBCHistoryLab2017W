The Ghost of Pugh Uidaje.
' This little fiction, calculated to make
the superstitious on Pugh Ridge, Bel
mont county, remain indoors at the
time o' night when "grave yards yawn,"
appeared in the Barnesville Enterpris 61
the 5th inst ' The parties are Mr. Ham
mono, in the flesh, and tbe departed
spirit of Mr Louden: ..
On or ahout the 4th of November,
1878, Mr. Hammond was visiting Mr.
Noffsinger, one of his neighbors, and
his general conversation was regarding
the new director M be appointed for the
school, and general topics that will come
up during the evening's intercourse.
Ahout nine o'clock he started for home.
We let him tell the rest of the story ; --
After I bad, been "out of the . house
and walked, say two hundred yards, at a
point in the road where lays a black wal
nut top blown down, I discovered some
one walking towards me, and in a mo
ment be was so near me that I involun
tarilv put out ray hand, so as to lay it,
on him, and found that I could not. I.
however, continued walking with him
along the road until I come to the gate
of the lane that leads into my house 1
knew all the time who it was, and recog
nized distinctly Mr. Louden. Although
I was not home at the time of his tuner
al, I saw him dressed in black clothes,
with shoes on, in his bare head and with
a handkerchief tied under his chin. His
eves, mouth, teeth, whiskers and gener
al expression of his face were as dis
tinctly outlined to me, aa they were the
last time I saw him before his death.
did not speak to him; nor he to me, but
all the time along the road he continued
to waltc, keeping up with me, and I con
fess I was walking pretty fast. At tbe
eate spoken of, I had to slip my hand
around the post to unfasten the - gate,
and I did so very .quickly.passed through
so as to avoid having further, company
with, him , but quick as I . was, when
bad closed tbe eate, I found that he was
still near me.' At this I was compelled
to place both hands on my hat, for all
that I conld do, I felt it rising, as though
it would leave' me.' I could distinctly
hear the old man walking, could see bis
motions, and if bo disposed could have
touched him. The lane from the main
road to my house is about two or three
hundred yards long, and at a point in
tbe road, where I had newly graded it
to avoid, a little hill, and where tbe
ground is lower than any other point on
the road my companion seemed to stop
and hesitate, as though he would speak
to me, and then turned and walked rap
idly away in the direction of the grave
yard where he was buried. The dis
tance to my house not being far, I was
soon within tbe house, relating this won
derful phenomena to my family. Why
the old gentleman should be disturbed,
or why Jbe should seek .me, especially, to
relate any grievances from which he may
he suffering, I cannot surmise, but the
facts are as 1 have related them to you
without exaggeration or equivocation.'
jarTha i Committee appointed to ex
amine the Annual Report of the Com
missioners of Franklin county, say in
their report to tbe Court :
'Your committee find that under the
present statute regulating the payment
of claims against tbe Infirmary, it would
seem that the County Auditor has no
discretion in the matter, but must draw
his warrant on tbe treasury for tbe
amount claimed when signed by the In
firmary Directors; likewise that the
County Commissioners have no control
over disbursements for supplies on ac
count of the Infirmary, and that the
itemized bills for 6nch supplies only
come before them in their semi-annual
settlement with tbe Infirmary Directors,
at which time said claims for supplies,
etc i have already been paid.' J i
"In view of the increasing expendi
tures, on behalf of the Infirmary, . and
in order that the disbursements of pub
lic moneys may be! confined to as few
officials as possible, tbe committee here
by suggest the following amendments to
the statutes which now exist :"
First That all claims against the In
firmary should be verified under oath, to
be correct as to the amount and value
by the person or persons furnishing such
supplies. - -; -
Second That all such claims, before
payment, should be audited and allowed
by the Commissioners as other claims
against the. county are audited nand al
lowed.: Y ;;; v.'l'T
" ThlrdApplications for relief 'should
be made under oath, specifying that the
person applying is needy, and is - with
out tbe available means of support.
If the Legislature will not abolish the
useless office ' of Infirmary 'Director, ' it
ought to adopt the above . amendments.
