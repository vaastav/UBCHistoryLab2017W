FOR MORMON SUCCESS
PRESIDENT CHARGED WITH US.
ING HIS INFLUENCE AT RE-
CENT ELECTION.
SENT SECRETARY TAFT TO IOAHO
SENATOR DUBOIS CLAIMS MOR-
MONISM WAS ONLY ISSUE
IN THAT STATE.
Washington, Dec 14.President
Roosevelt was directly charged in the
senate during the day with using his
influence for the election of Repub
lican Mormon candidates in the recent
election in Idaho and Utah. The
charge was made by Senator Dubois
in the course of a speech in which he
discussed the right of Reed Smoot to
a seat in the senate The address
was of considerable length, the first
portion being devoted to a review of
the Mormon church Mr. Dubois as
serted that polygamous marriages
were still being contracted, although
surreptitously, and that an aristocracy
of polygamists was being built up by
the church officials, who now arrange
and select these polygamous mar
riages. But no record of polygamous
marriages is kept which is available
for the American people. Because of
this he pointed out the futility of pass
ing a national law prohibiting the
practice.
As to Senator Smoot, he said, it
made no difference whether he ^as
or was not a polygamist.
"Smoot," he said, "represents the
church and not the state and would
do the bidding of the church before
he would serve the real interests of
the state or of the nation
Turning his attention to the cam
paign preceding the recent election
Mr. Dubois read the press dispatches
of Oct. 22, which stated the president
had sent Secretary Taft into Idaho
to speak in
Advocacy of Law and Order.
At that time, Mr Dubois said, he had
telegraphed the president that the only
issue in Idaho was the desire of the
Mormon hierarchy to continue to dom
inate the politics of the state and that
the president had been misled if he
thought there was any other issue.
Mr. Dubois referred to messages of
Presidents Buchanan, Johnson, Grant,
Hayes, Garfield, Arthur and Cleveland,
oiting what he termed "the menace of
Mormonism," and proceeded:
"I call attention to these messages
of the presidents for two purposes
"One to indicate the views of our
former executives the other to mark
the contrast between them and the
present occupant of the White House.
Mormonism is more insidious, more
dangerous and a greater menace to
our government and civilization today
than it was at any particular period
when these messages were addressed
to congress Yet President Roosevelt
does not deem the subject worthy of
mention in a message filled with sug
gestions.
"The non-Mormon citizenship of
Utah and of Idaho think they are en
titled to the support of law abiding
citizens everywhere in their efforts to
maintain American citizenship in these
Mormon states and if they cannot re
ceive that they have the right to de
mand that the president of the United
States shall not use the great power
vested in him in the interest of those
law defying and un-American organiza
tions In their determination to rule
the politics of this section of our
country."
WOUND PROVES FATAL.
Ex-Senator Brown of Utah Dead at
Washington.
Washington, Dec. 14.Arthur Brown
of Utah, formerly United States sen
ator, who was shot by Mrs. Anna M.
Bradley of Salt Lake City when in his
apartments at the Hotel Raleigh Sat
urday afternoon, died at midnight at
the Emergency hospital.
Mrs. Bradley will set up the defense
that she was justified under thG "un-
written law" in shooting Mr. Brown.
Just before Senator Brown's death
one of the assistant district attorneys
made another fruitless effort to secure
an ante-mortem statement, but the
senator refused to talk.
Mrs. Bradley is on the verge of col
lapse and her physician says that it
may be several days before she will
be able to appear in court.

District Attorney Jerome Threaten*
to Expose Connection.
New York, Dec. 14 In speaking of
bis efforts to suppress gambling in
this city District Attorney Jerome
said that if certain men, who, he said,
weie both poolroom proprietors and
had political affiliations, did not close
their places at once he would serve a
grand juiy subpoena upon every dis
trict leader in Manhattan and Bronx
boroughs, both Democratic and Re
publican. If that means was neces
sar to get at the bottom of the con
nection between poolrooms and poli
tics in this city he declared he would
use it Mr. Jerome had already ob
served that there was some indication
on the part of the persons to whom
he was referring to be defiant and he
intimated that if this alleged attitude
was persisted in the seventy district
leaders would all be required to tell
what they knew of the existence of
poolrooms here.

First Masses Celebrated Outside the
Pale of Law.
Paris, Dec. 14.There was an im
pressive response to the clergy's ap
peal to their parishioners to attend the
first masses celebrated outside of the
pale of the law A correspondent of
the Associated Press visited a dozen
churches, including Notre Dame dea
Victoires, St. Germain d'Auxerrois,
where the signal for the St. Bartholo
mew massacre was given St Roch
de Madelaine and St. Augustine. Ev
erywhere it was the same stoiy. The
front gates of the churches were
closed, but the Catholics, by the gray
light of dawn, were streaming through
the side portals The interiors of the
buildings were well filled in several
places there was music, but nowhere
was there the slightest attempt to in
terfere with the service or create a
disturbance. There were three police
men stationed outside the porticos of
the churches to prevent any possible
disorder, while police officers in plain
clothes were on duty inside to note
the infractions of the law, taking the
names of the officiating priests and
approximating the number of those
present with the object of making re
ports to the justices of police
Early dispatches from the depart
ments say that wherever mass was
celebrated chaiges were diawn up and
summonses issued. At Chalons the
Abbe Renaudin claimed that the
church bells were not rung and that
no person was invited to mass and
that therefore the assemblage had not
the character of a public meeting,
whereupon he was compelled by a po
lice officer to inscribe his protest upon
the summons.
STATE'S CONSENT NEEDED
MINNESOTA MAY BLOCK NEW IS-
SUE OF GREAT NORTH-
ERN STOCK.
St. Paul, Dec. 14.President Hill's
proposed Issuance of $60,000,000 In
new stock to the shareholders of the
Great Northern Railway company may
be sidetracked for the time being.
Attorney General E. T. Young, in an
swer to questions regarding the con
templated issue of new stock, issued
the following statement:
"In my opinion thei is no doubt but
that under a propel interpretation of
the law as it now stands no new stock
can be issued by a domestic railway
company without obtaining the con
sent of the state, through the railway
commission.
"Before such consent can be given
the commission must give a public
hearing on the question, in which hear
ing the purpose for which the money
is to be used and the necessity for
the new issue of stock must be fully
shown.
"In showing the necessity for this
issue the company would have to show
what it did with the proceeds of the
$25,000,000 stock issued last February,
which has not as yet been accounted
for in any public way.
"This proposed issue would increase
the stock of the Great Northern com
pany to $210,000,000.
"The bonds of the system are now
about $215,000,000, which would make
the capitalization of the 6,000 miles of
road $425,000,000, which exceeds $70,-
000 per mile for both main line and
branches, where much of the road,
especially the branch lines, cost not
to exceed $2,000 per mile.
"The dividends on this excess cap
italization is an unwarranted tax on
the patrons of the road and, instead
of increasing its stock, which is now
about $60,000 per mile, the company
ought to show some justification fpr
its present capitalization."
FOUND DEAD IN NEW YORK.
New Jersey Clergyman and Young
Woman of Same Place.
New York, Dec. 14.A man about
fortyVears old, believed to be Rev. C.
S. Quinn, pastor of St. Agnes church
at Atlantic Highlands, N. J., and a
young woman, thought to be Miss B.
Kiley, also of Atlantic Highlands, were
found dead in a room on the top floor
of an East Eighteenth street board
inghouse. The room was filled with
gas, which had escaped from a par
tially open jet in the room. The
couple had been at the house since
Tuesday evening. The man called at
the house last week and inquired about
the price of a room for a married
couple. When informed that it would
be$4 per week he said that was rather
too much for him to pay, as,he was
out of work. He was not seen again
until last Tuesday, when he called and
engaged the room. In the evening he
returned with the woman. They car
ried between them four grips and
satchels.

BIG SLICE FOR THE STATE.
Carnegie Advocates Heavy Inheritance
Tax.
New York, Dec. 14.Andrew Carne
gie, in an address before the National
Civic federation, said that he believed
that the major portion of the estates
of enormously wealthy men should go
to the state upon the death of the pos
sessor of the fortune. Mr. Carnegie
opposed a graduated income tax.
"I think an income tax would pene
trate business to the core," said Mr.
Carnegie. "I think this country would
never regret anything so much as to
impose such a tax. I differ with the
president strongly on the subject of
the income tax. But I am in a pecu
liar position on the inheritance tax,
advocating chat as something like get
ting a better distribution of wealth.
The subject of wealth distribution will
not down."
Mr. Carnegie said he believed, in
asmuch as the wealth properly be
longed to the community, the latter,
on the death of the possessor, should
acquire a great portion of the wealth,
having had a large part to do with its
development.

TEN MEN IN SMA8HUP.
Bad Spill in Six-Day Bicycle Race at
New York.
I'e York, Dec. 14.One of the
worst spills in the six-day bicycle race
now on at Madison Square Garden oc
curred at 7 25 a. m. Ten of the thir
teen riders went down in a smashup.
The spill came after a mad sprint in
which Fogler was prominent.
Eddie Root was picking up his part
ner, Fogler, when the latter's wheel
was run into by Matt Downey. In a
second there was a crash and the
thousands of spectators who had re
mained in the garden during the night
saw ten of the riders scattered over
the track. The police and spectators
jumped on the track and helped to
pick up the fallen and stunned riders.
Vanoni of the French-Italian team
was thrown over the protecting fence
into one of the boxes. He sustained
painful injuries, including a gash on
his thigh, and Hollister of the Salt
Lake City team was said to be suffer
ing from a possible fracture of the,
skull.
The race was suspended for quite a
while and the injured men were car
ried to their quarters. In the mean
time a corps of carpenters hurried to
repair the track, which was ripped and
torn for fully twenty yards.
All the riders with the exception of
Hollister and Vanoni were able to
continue when the race was resumed
after a delaj}r of nearly an hour and a
half. The partners of the two injured
men continued the grind and it was
believed "at that time that both Hoi-1
lister and Vanoni would be able to
resume after two or three hours' rest.
BRANCHES IN MANY CITIES
"KNOCKING" ALLEGED CAUSE OF
FAILURE OF CUMMINGS COM-
MISSION COMPANY.
St. Paul, Dec. 14.The Cummings
Commission company, one of the larg
est and best known brokerage houses
in the Twin Cities, has suspended
business.
The following statement, sent out to
all of the Cummings offices through
out this state, the Dakotas and as far
north as Winnipeg, sums up oriefly
the cause of the failure:
"The systematic 'knocking' that has
been goLig on against this company
for some time has created such a con
dition of affairs that our attorneys ad
vise us to close up all accounts so as
to protect in a measure all alike. It
will be a few days before we can give
results."
A. J. Cummings, head of the con
cern, says the failure has come about
simply because business has fallen off
and heavy expenses have eaten up the
resources of the company.
The Cummings Commission com
pany is what is known as a private
wire house, with a multitude of offices
in the towns and cities of the North
west, catering to the country specu
lative trade.

Actor Attempts 8uicide in Japanese
Fashion. I
New York, Dec. 14.A sensational
attempt at suicide was made in a
Sixth avenue saloon by a man who de
scribed himself as Rankin Duvall, an
actor, forty years of age. Duvall en
tered the saloon and walking up to
the lunch counter picked up a long
bladed cheese knife and, turning to
the bartender with a smile, asked:
"May I use this?"
"Certainly," replied the bartender,
thinking he was about to carve some
cheese for himself. Instead, to the
horror of the people in the saloon, he
unbuttoned his coat and vest and,
pressing the point of the knife to his
abdomen, threw himself heavily to the
floor so that the big blade ripped his
body. Before any of the men close by
could spring on him and wrest the
knife from him be had thrust the
weapon twice more into the frightful
wound.
Duvall did not lose consciousness
and when asked why he had done
such a thing replied: "Oh, I'm a
criminal that's all."
At the hospital where Duvall was
taken it is said he has only a slight
chance for recovery.
Duvall is said to be the son of a
Baltimore merchant. He recently
played in the "Darling of the Gods,"
in the last act of which he nightly
enacted committal of suicide in Japa
nese fashion. At the hospital he said
he lately has been playing in "Madame
Butterfly."

REPUBLICS UEyBERS TO CAUCUS
EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO COM-

Washington, Dec 14.The house
committee on merchant marine has

amendments confining government aid
to Oriental and South American ship
ping and opposition of the Republicans
to the measure developed at once.
