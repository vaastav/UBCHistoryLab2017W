" The bill for the admission of the so
called State of West Virginia into the
Union passed the House of Represen
tative on the 10th inst., by a vote of
ninety to fifty-five. It passed the
Senate at the last session, and now on
JJ?JU.aPPr?val of tke Prudent
o ocoorae a law. T-jaut, as me tin,
the Constitution said to have been rati
fied by a vote ef the people within the
limits of the proposed new State, has
been amended for gradual emancipa
ting it will again be submitted to the
people for ratification in its amended
form. Though the real sentiments of
the mass of the people said to be in
cluded within the new State Bhould be
the other way, there can be little doubt
out that, through Abolition pressure
and management, a majority will be
reported in favor of the Constitution
as amended by Congress. It is begin
ning to be pretty well understood how
elections are ' conducted in districts
where Abolitionists, "dressed in a lit
tle brief authority," have full sway.
' But . these matters are of small mo
mint compared with the revolutionary
character of the measure itself. The
bill is not a bill for the constitutional
admission into the Union of a new
fcjtate, but for the unconstitutional di
vision and consentient destruction of
nn existing State in tho Uniun one
of the original "Thirteen." By the
Constitution, no new State can be e
rected out of an old one without the
consent of the Legislature of the latter.
It is idle to pretend that the Virginia
Legislature ever consented to the cre
etlon of this new State. The Legisla
ture, to called, which met at Wheeling
and affected to represent the whole
State, and in that capacity to consent
to the formation of a new State, did
not in fact represent a third of the
State, and could in no sense be called
the Legislature of the State of Virgin
ia. The measure admitting this new
State and dismembering Virginia, is
therefore, unconstitutional, and is, as
Thad Stevens characterised it in Con
gress, strietly revolutionary,
; Th majority in Congress has thus,
in the passage of this bill, inaugurated
a revolution, or in other words, has
commenced the work of dissolving the
Union. For the constitutional integ
rity of the Union eannot be preserved,
Bnlert' integrity of
eacB4 every State w also preserved.

The proceedings in the McDowell
Court Martial, are bringing many
thing to light, which have heretofore
be; hi'l. The most important fact
brought to public view, is a letter from
Prusident Lincoln to General McDow
ell, instructing him to lay aside the
Richmond movement, and to co-operate
with Fremont in the destruction of
Jackson. McDowell obeyed with a
heavy and a sad heart, for he knew
what the, consequences w&uld be. The
result was the battles before Richmond
ani ihe almost destruction of Mc'Clel-
4au's army. Had the President fiOt in
tci fered had ho not tried to play the
generals-McDowell worid have joined
McClellau with 40,00(5 men and Rich
mond would havo been taken! The
whole failure, therefore, of last Sum
mers's campaigns, falls upon tho Pres
ident, and upon him alone. He, it
was who produced the disasters upon
the Chickahominy and before Wash
ingtou! His imbecility and unfitness
for command nearly ruined both the
armies of McClellan and Pope. His
ordering McDowell to let Richmond a-
lonc to run on a wild goose chase af
ter Jackson was iust what the Con
federates desired. After thus pre
venting the capture of Richmond, he
had the meanness to try tomakescap
goats of McClellan ond McDowcll,and
held them up to the country as the au
thors of ins mistake! lie was defici
ent in generosity and magnanimity, as
he has proved himself in soldierly qua!
ities! Thanks to the McDowell court
martial, the country now knows the
author of the Richmond miscainage
It was not General McDowell; it was
not McClellan; but Abe Lincoln,
President of the United States! Up
on him let it rest through all time with
crushing weight!

LKTTEIl FROM THE PRESIDENT TO HOBATIO
PKYMOURi'
The President hu written letter to Ho
rio Seymour, urging him to drop attention
to party" interests and concern himsell gome-
what for the interest ol the nation; dwelling
on tba suffering ol the West Irom the clos
ing of the Misiis-ippi Kiver, and expressing
the hope thoy will be able to alleviate tbe
suffering somewhat by presenting railroad
monopolies and reducing the present tariff
on freight. As deemed by those who ought
to know, the letter appears to be s some
what curious document.
This is certainly one of the coolest
and most impudent proceedings that
has lately come under our observation;
and if the President is not genteely
rebuked for it by Governor Seymour,
we much mistake the character and a
bility of the man. Tho President's
letter and the Governor's reply will be
a valuable contribution to our political
literature.
It is, indeed, rich for Mr. Lincoln
to advise Mr. Lincoln to advise the
Democratic Governor t6 drop "party"
and look after the interests of the na
tion. Just at this time there is no
good way to save the nation to do it
a service except through the instru
mentality of the Democratic party.
. The President, by, his devotion to
the abolitiou party, has brought about
the present state of things, and wo can
only get rid of the latter by defeating
the President's scheme to make this
a party p-bolition war to liberate the
negroes. There never was so strict a
party man as the President. lie Las
not done a single act in his whole term
without considering the question
whether it would help or injure the Re
publican party. In his Inaugural Ad
dress he decalred that the Chicago plat
form would be a law unto him during
his administration! He put his party
creed above the Constitution he had
sworn to support. If the President
wants to alleviate the suffering of the
west, why don't ho do it? He alone
has the power. Why did he not rec
ommend to Congress the repeal of the
infamous Morril Tariff, which robs the
West of a hundred million of dollars
for the benefit of New England manu
factures? Why did he not recommend
the repeal of the internal tax upon
whiskey, tobacco and other western
products, which is so ruinous to the
West, and I is" throwing thousands of
people out of employment? lie has
done none of these things.. His ad
ministration has discriminated in fav-
oV of New England and against the
West. .Governor Seymour and his
friends cannot do justice to the West,
but the President and his party can.

It is thought by some that, in con
sideration of the general incompetency,
inefficient, inertia and sympathy with
the reWlion of the officers jf the army,
the fce.;t use to which they could be
put by the Government would be to or
ganize them into Cewrts-martial and
see them to trying each other. Thct
they are, ene and all guilty of the of
fenses we have enumerated, is shown
by proof which it does not become us
to dispute the almost unanimous de
clarations of the newspapers of tho Ad
ministration party; and that they would
upon that evidence, find each other
guilty, there is little reason to doubt,
judging from the results of those that
have already taken place.
It n-ay be suspected that, in making
tlijs suggestion, we are speaking in a
spirit of ireny. We scarcely know
whether we are doing so or not. The
thing, as it stands, is so nruch beyond
the power of ordinary exnirzeration
that even irony becomes tame and in
adequate and caricature fails to come
up to the indescribable ludicrousuess
of the reality.' Never did a party in
power carry the backbiting of itself to
an extreme at once so sad and so laugh
able. "Everybody, from tho President
down to the captain in military branch,
the tax collector in the civil, and the
editor in the party, seems imbued with
the bitterest hatred, the most pro found
contempt, or both together, for every
body else. In the estimation of each,
all the rest are fools or villains, or a
compound of the qualities of both.
The spirit of universal detraction
has flourished unsupprcssed, until it
has brought on a stato of anarchy,
which has paralyzed the Government,"
demoralized the army, and introduced
foar, distrust, contention ond rivalry
in every branch of tho public service.
The heads of departments are rivals of
the President, of each oilier, and of
every fortunate General. The Gen
erals are antagonists, each looking
upon a success gained by another as
unfavorable to his own aspirations.
Out of these has grown, without doubt,
some of the disasters which our armies
have experienced, and many of the fail
ures to do that which the people had
been led to expect at their hands.
; In the military service the thing is
culminating, as might have been expec
ted, in numerous Courts-martial, the
bnsiness of which is not to try fairly
tho accused party, but to find some pre
text npon which he may be disgraced.
The existence of such Courts is the
best proof that could possible exist of
tho state of anarchy to which the army
is reduced,aa their proceedings are also
the most efficient meant to intensify
and perpetuate such anarchy.---Enq.

Ifo. 11. W A. M. Everything laatnigbt was

fixed for crossing lbs river. During lbs night
tba por. toons were conveyed lo the rrret, and
tba artillery of ons hundred and forty three
peicea placed is position opposite. At five
o'clock Ibis morning tta rebels fir. d two aig
nal guna and during the latter pait of tht
night rockets weie frequently seen witbie
their lines.
At rive o'clock lb construction of three
bridges in front of the city wat commenced.
When ibt bridges were about half completed
tbe enemy opened a murderoua fits of infant
ry from the houses on tba river bank. Up
to ihit time not s shot had bean fired Irom
our tide. Thaengineera were driven from
Ihe bridges, and several kit ed and wounded.
At six o'clock Gen. Burnside ordered all
(be cuds to be opened on the city. Tba can
ooade which bat continued up to the precent
time is terrible. The city is on fire, and its
destruction appears certain.
1 he enemy about seven o'clock Ibia morn
ing opened with their heavy guna Irotn their
works, but so br have don au aeriona irju
ry. Gen, Franklin constructed his bridges
about three miles below ilia city, meeting
with but slight opposition. lit troops are
crowing, and the gunboata are shelling tbe
enemy about lilieen miles dewn tl. rirer,
where tbey have been concentrating their
forces lor the past lew days.
The concentrated fir ol our batteries on
tleci'y hvi Hie cifuct of driving back the
enemy's infantry, and the work on the bridg
es has again been comenced. 'i he trooija
are all under arms near iht river, prepared
to ruh over as soon as the bridges are com
pleted. Noon On the attempt being made lo fin -
ish the bridge in (rent of the city, the tebel
infantry again opened their tire, when our
artillery in position was again opened on the
city, the rc.-ult being that tbe city was fired
in scversl new places.
The enemy has used very little artillery
up to ibis time, as it would endanger their
own men who are holding the liver front.
uui nsiue has just issued an order lo con
centraio every available gun upon the city.
under tbe cover of the fire of Inch it is Le
liereJ the bridge can be finished.
Th killed aDd wounded do not amount (o
more Ihar fifty men. .
Evening. LSut little firing took place
between oi e and three, during which lime
all the available battel ies were placed in po
sition. They numbered one hundred and
seventy six guns. At a signal all opened un
tho city. The fire was terrible, btit the reb
el sliarpsnooters could not tie driven Irom
hiding places. Tbe shot and bbell went
through the houses, in many cases setting
them o fiie, causing a dense- smoke which,
together wnli the explosion ol so large a
qii 'ti ity of powder, almost hid tbe city from
vitw.
It became evident that the bridges could
not be built except by a bold dash, and vul
ui.teerswere called lor to crust in small boats.
The order was no sooner gite than hundreds
stepped forward; but as all could not go, a
bout one hundicd were selected. They were
coon on their way, while the artillery threw
a pei feet storm ol iron hail on the opposite
bank. Tbey reached Ihe opposite shore but
not without lobs. With fix d bayonets
they lushed upon they enemy, killing several
and taking one hundred and one piuoners,
who were safely landed on this side.
At half past four two bridge were finished
opposite the city, when the troops immedi
ately began to cross over. The enemy
were noon driven from the city back to their
line of woiks.
The l wo bridges in front of Gen. Franklin
were 'Successfully laid early in the day,, but
his troops did not crust uulil the two upper
ones was ready.
A sufficient lorue is now on tbe opposite
side of ihe river to resist anv attack that is
likely to be made." The rebels fired but tew
guns in the mornii g, and none in the a'ter
noon, although their works were io easy
range. . :, '
During the forenoon the rebels burnt Ihe
rnlroad bridge ouuide of the city. Between
thirty and tortv bouses were burnt, mosuy
in the buisinest part of the city.
During i be day between eight thousand
and nine thousand rounds of ammunition
weie fired by our artillery. .

first ridge of hills in lb rear of lb ci'y, on
which the enemy had his guns posted be
hind earthworks, could not be carried ex
cept by a charge of infantry. Sumner assign
ed that duty to French's division, supported
by Om Howard's. The troops advanced to
the works at ten minu'es before twelve
o'clock at a brk run. Th enemy's guns
opened a rapid tiro on them.
Vhe:i within nm-kei range of the ridge
ihcy were met by a terrible n:e from the in
fantry, who were posted behind a stone wall
and some houses on the right of the line.
This checked their advance, and they fell
back to a smalt ravine, but not nut of musket
range. At this time another bidy ol troops
moved to their assistance in splendid style,
notwithstanding gaps had been made in their
ranks by the reliel artillery.
When they arrived at the first line on a
double quick, and with the command of fix

they were forced to face was loo much, and

and were brought back. From that tune the

Tbe resolu ion rela'ive to arbitrary arvesls
ol certain citizens of Delawar was taken np.
' Mr. Morrill contended that tho t solution
at it row rtood was not a mi re resolution of

tnd ho (Morrill) should vote no such lesolu
lion He claimed sbal in thit stale of war
and rebellion, wilh lh land lull of traitors
and (pica, the Commander in Chief bat th
right io arrest such men. Nrton. not even
the Senator Irom Delaware (Saul-bury.) ha
Claimed that these ran wer loyal. - Tairo
had been many arrest mad, and th pr p
er prfesumptlon is that tbe President ha
been arresting guilty men. and aimply doing
hi duty i lie (Lincoln) ought to do it.' it
will not do to pretend that whole Slats)
and ill its people are loyal. It ia known
that the State of rffentucky has been nest
of traitors. Three out of every lour of the
able b idled men of Kentucky bav goue .lv
rebeldoin, and nobody it left, rhere but old
women. Yet the Senator from . Kentucky
(Powell) asks for commiseration, tor then

Mr. Sloirell contended there wit Ho
ground lor complaint that men were afrenled
on suspicion. Men were always arrested tftt
suspicion of crime. ; - ' ' - " ' - r ;
Mr. Wright moved to amend th retotiN
lion so as to make the call upon ' tht Presi
dent instead ol upon the Secretary of War.
: Mr. Wright said he knew no man was
permitted to liva in the South who had ' any
symyatby with the North; tie would lik
to see some of the spirit that wai shown by
Stonewall Jackaon. When h found' forty
seven of his men skedaddling from the battle,
he marched them in Iront of the regiment
and h .d every man of them shot. ! Instead
of this, we have a prop-witinn for Conven
tions, etc. He (Wright) ! would aland by
tho Government and the President 1 II'
would have the power of the Government
(elt by every traitor North and South.- - !
Mr, Bayaid argued at some lenplh o
show the atfiirs ol the State of Kentucky
had nothing whatever lo do with the 8tat
of Delaware, and that true ' loyalty ' to' the
country did not Imply loyally to any singlo
individual. If this is a free 1 country lb
people in it certainly tiava a right to inquire
into the acta of ihe President. .- ' -r .?.
Mr Powell said he had said the Hre-i dent
had violated the Constitution, and he was
read toy pruva it. He Hefied tht Senator
Irom Maine, or any Senator on this floor, to
compare lists on this question. He denied
that three out of four of th people of tho
State of Kentucky were in lha rebel army.
Three-fourths ol the people of that 8 ate at
not in arms at all, and he be'ieved that thero
were mbre men in the Union than rebel
army. He (Powell) wanted to indulge in
no personalities with any Senator hero, as:
there was a way to settle personal matter
t-lsehere, and he wanted Senators to meet
his arguments fairly. He did' not believe
this Union could rver be restored by tore
of arms. Therefore he bail opposed tho
war, and should continuo to oppose it. Ho
