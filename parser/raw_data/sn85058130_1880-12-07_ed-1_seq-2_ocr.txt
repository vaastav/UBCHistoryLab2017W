PRESIDENT HAYES latest and last
annual message to Congress is spread
before the HERALD readers this morn
ing In order to publish it in fall
and et the same time furnish the
customary amount of telegraphic
newa and miscellaneous matter we
issue a twopage supplement The
message is longer than any of the
Presidents previous eflusions and we
do not hesitate to pronounce it an
able and valuable state paper With
the country in its present prosperous
condition and the contented sat
isfied feeling that everywhere
prevails it would be difficult for
his excellency to frame a message
that did not read well to tne millions
of people in the United States
There has never been a period in the
nations history when a better showing
ing could be made than is presented
today The republic is enjoying
perhaps the most prosperous year of
its existence Then why should not
Mr Hayes be able to present a re
markably good message and one
which must be received with pleas
ant satisfaction everywhere But the
rrnntloman maces Ihft TTlifttflkG Ol
gentleman
attributing to himself and his policy
this happy condition of things I
and my policy are implied iI
not written all over the document
when Mr Hayec and his policy had
nothing whatever to do with bringing
about the present circumstances
Neither he nor his eminent finan
cier Mr Sherman could have re
duced the public debt BQ it has beer
reduced if the country had not been
prosperous nor is either of them
responsible in the slightest degree for
thin prosperity The earth the rain
the Eunall the elements combined
to add to the wealth of the republic
never before have there been such
harvests as were gathered in 1879 and
1880 and the Old World has fur
nished a steady and profitable market
for our products Industries have
been stimulated by reason of their
lagging elsewhere money has been
plentiful and in this new land
possessing unlimited mources has
found abundant opportunities for
investment The mines have
yielded up their wealth and labor
has been constanty and profitably
employed What has Mr Hayes or
his administration done for the coun
try It is true a portion of the public
debt has been refunded in bonds
bearing a lower rate of interest but
this was not the work of Hayes The
solidity of the republic and its ability
to keep its promises to pay floated
the loan and would today enable us
to issue 8J or even 3 per cent bonds
for every dollar of the debt that will
become payable during the coming
four years Mr Hayes claims too
much and plumes himself too
loudly over circumstances that be
had nothing to do with creating
His civil service reform talk reads
prettily but how has it been in prac
tice shameless fraud There has
been no civil service reform
The presidential oidera were
of no more force than EO
many school boy scribblinga His
appointees paid no attention 10 his
orders and even disregarded them
eo far as he could without bringing
himself into public contempt
Officials and placeholders have Leen
assessed as heavily and BB openly for
political purposes as under any ad
ministration The President forbade
the participation of federal officials in
political affairs yet from bis cabinet I
ministers to petty postmasters they
have publicly disregarded his com
mand and ha has winked at tho vio
ation The satisfactory condition oC
the republic socially and indus
trklly is due eolely to the
country itself and not tc
the policy of the administration
admitting that Mr Hayes admini
stration has ban a policy and pursued
it But in the main the message is
a ceod one and will be eo received by
the country and the civilized world
It is good because it could not well
have been made otherwise How
ever there are some objectionable
points in it The first is the al usion
to Utah It is quite generally under
stood hereabouts that the portion of
the message of chief local interest
waa framed by one of our federal I i
judges at the request of Mr Hayes
and adopted by him The judicia
gentleman must t be surprised to fine
that his queer suggestions have ob
tained such high recognition ant
tbs country will perhaps wondei
also It seems strange that in
this enlightened age and in
the free republic of America
such nnrepublican and monstrous
ideas of the government of a com
0 munity should have been born in the
brainof an intelligent being Can
i anyone bean verdant to believe that
what Mr Hayes proposes in regard
to the Mormon people could ever be
sanctioned by our American citizens
r or the American people In this republic
>
public we do not go backward Pro
gress improvement and advance
I 9 iP ment have been the cry from the be
i ginning Whatever system of govern I
h1 mont is given to this territory will be
f better than the one that we are cow
living under and instead of losin
any of their limited rights as citizen
c the people will acquire others belong
1 ing to them but which they have
1 never been able to obtain The wild
suggestions of a judge ere not law I
1 and no more are tho careless recom
mendations of a president statutes
If they were the Utah people twenty
I
years ago and almost every
year since would have been
in great danger of legal an
nihilation Whatever there may
be that is wrong or unlawful in this
territory must be cured by lawful and
regular methods No extreme meas
ures and especially such as are mon
strously vicious wicked and unlawful
in themselves will accomplish any
thing Congress perhaps under
stands this if Mr Heyes and his
Utah judicial adviser do not We
need have no fear that A provisional
I
government for this territory will be I
provided nor that the 150000 per i
sons in this and other territories
against whom the President raves
will be deprived of any more of their I
rights
