Weather predictions, like some women, are often fair but false.
oo ;
Rushing the Russians seems to be General von Hinden'ourg's favor
ite form of exercise.
oo-
Perhaps Carranza would be just as happy now. if the Americans
hadn't evacuated Vera Cruz.
oo "..
, It is all right to urge a stronger navy; it is all wrong to lie about
the navy we have,
i . . oo .
' Life isn't all beer and skittles, ' but then most people are willing
enough to do without the skittles, whatever they inay be.
v . oo
It is hard to say whether it is more grimly humerous or sickeningly
pathetic Germany fining Belgium for violating her own neutrality.
oo
If the casualty rate of the first four months of the war keeps up.
peace may soon be obtained by the simple process of elimination.
oo
Another outrage that calls for a clarion note from the Oyster of
Oyster Bay is Mr. Taft's persistent and pestilential happiness over the
election figures.
oo
"We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and
ideals, we never shall have, a large standing army." President Wilson.
A statement that ninety-nine citizens will applaud for every hundredth
P".ir of jingo ears it offends.
oo
Fifty-five millions of dollars a day is the estimated money cost of
the European war. The cost in human life, suffering, misery, blasted
hopes and general ruin cannot be computed.. It is indeed a price that
staggers humanity.
oo :
No message of President Wilson's has met with" more widespread
popular approval than his latest. Every word of it is sound, safe, sen
sible doctrine. It appeals to the minds of the people in substance and
phrasing. It is assuring to business and gratifying to every peace-loving
citizen. Only one class finds in it aught to criticize the chronic jingo
and his disapproval s drowned in the chorus of popular acclaim.

MR HERRICK'S BOOM
Being an Ohio man, Myron T. Herrick is ex-officio a Republican
candidate for president; but being an experienced Ohio man, Mr. Her
rick had no hesitation about looking into the mouth, of the gift horse
that his enthusiastic friends presented to him when he arrived from
Trance a few days ago.
Mr. Herrick is not likely to open headquarters on the strength of
the presidential boom that was esccfrted down to meet him at a New
York pier. Although he has held only two offices, he has had years of
political experience. Some two decades ago he was one of three men,
including Mark Hanna, who paid off William McKinley's business debts
in order that there should be no embarrassing obstacles in the way of
Mr. McKinley's nomination for president, and an Ohio man who was
the political associate of Mark Hanna knows that Republican presiden
tial larks do not fall from the skies.
Mr. Herrick will have no illusions about his sudden presidential
notoriety. He will sit tight and wait; yet Republican lightning might
flash further and strike worse.
I'O
WHY NOT A NATIONAL EXCHANGE FOR LABOR?
Secretary Wilson, of the department of labor, has touched upon a
good idea in his suggestions regarding the bringing together, on a
national scale, of the "jobless man" and the "manless job."
It often happens that in certain states, as during the harvest season
in the west, there is brisk demand for labor, whil in other states or
sections there may be many "jobless men." .
It surely would tend to promote trre general welfare if Uncle Sam
would use his good offices in the way of equalizing labor conditions by
providing something in the nature of a National Labor exchange; just
as the states, acting severally, should each provide for a State Labor
exchange.
In fact, city and state exchanges could work together with a national
exchange to form practically one harmonious system. So there might
be full and trustworthy information at all times of labor conditions in
all parts of the United States, accessible to everybody.
This would not 'be reducing labor to the plane of a commodity, but.
on the contrary, would be highly humanitarian.
It would tend to prevent the overcrowding of labor markets such as
now often results through misinformation, or from the deliberate spread
ing of false reports as to local conditions. Sacramento Bee.

. EDISON "STARTS OVER AGAIN"
Witnessing at the age of sixty-seven the destruction of his great
workshops, Thomas A. Edison exhibited true American spirit when he
said to the reporters:
"I'm pretty well burned out just now, 'ooys, but I'll start all over
tomorrow. There'll be some rapid mobilizing here when this debris cools
off and is cleared away. I'll go right to work to build the plant over
again. It is just a temporary set-back; don't forget that."
There never would have been any Thomas A. Edison such as Vne
world knows if the bearer of that name had yielded easily to reverses,
says the New York World, but his courage in the presence of disaster
late in life is none the less noteworthy. No one need imagine that a
man of such triumphs has not also been profoundly schooled in defeats.
Ii is the 'jabit of years which now fortifies him against adversity.
We know of no habit that is better worth cultivating. Nearly all
human endeavor s attended by more or less failure or misfortune. There
arc many, who never surmount their first affliction. Most of the com
paratively few who, gain great success have "started all over again"
many timet.
The industry, perseverance and self-discipline of Mr. Edison have
ong been an inspiration to the young men of America. During all these
years he has created something besides electrical applliances, and quite
as important he lv;.s been building character. It is character that c:i
alcs him in old age to meet frowning fortune undismayed.
