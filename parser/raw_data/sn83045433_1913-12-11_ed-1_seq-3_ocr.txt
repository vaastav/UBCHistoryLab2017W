.President Wilson outlined bis "trust
busting" plans, and bis remedial trust
legislation to Chairman Clayton yester
day and to the House Judiciary Commit
tee which consulted him.
The President does not believe that the
New Jersey trust laws can be applied
to the country.
e is opposed to a government com
mission to execute the anti-trust laws.
He believes that personal penalties ap
plied to those who violate the anti-trust
laws Will stoo combination Mnd Individ,
uals from trying to establish monopolies
ana corners in markets.
ne opposes any amendments to the
Sherman anti-trust law, because such
amendment would throw that law again
before the Supreme Court for interpreta
tion and three years would pass before
there would be a ruling.
The President has asked the House
Judiciary Committee to recommend legis
lation, supplemental to the Sherman anti
trust law. which shall embody the best
provisions of the State laws against mo
nopolies and combinations in restraint of
trade.
Chairman Clayton, with his delegation
from the House Judiciary Committee,
told the President that no bill could be
Presented from his committee without a
hearing air. Clayton asked jesterday
that all members of the House proposing
anu-trusl legislation should tell the com
mittee wherein the existing Uuv can be
lmprovea.
To Ilenr Corporation Men
Samuel Untermyer. of New York, who
conferred with Chairman Clayton a week
ago. is to be a leading witness. The
first fight is to be made against the svs
tem of interlocking directorates among
tig corporations. Following the hearing
"""). wnen memoers or congress are to
appear, a number of big corporation men
are to be called.
Chairman Clayton said esterday he
could not outline the trust legislation to
be presented to the House, because his
committee was made up of Representa
tives from many States and each of
those States had local laws governing
trusts, which would have to be consld-e-ed
by the national law-making body
when It came to the framing of an inter
national and an Interstate commerce
law.
The House Judiciary Committee re
jected the plan of Representative Mor
gan, of Oklahoma, that the Interstate
Commerce Commission should have abso
lute powers of condemnation where a
question of the right to Interstate com
merce was involved. This throws the
question of determination back into the
Federal District courts, the Commerce
Court having been abolished

R. W. WELLS PROMISES
TO WORK FOR CiPITA.
HyarUviDe Attorney Announce CnE-
daer for Congress from Fifth
Maryland District
Robert W. Wells, of Prince George
County, has announced his candldacv
for Congress from the Fifth Mainland
district and will run In the primaries
against Representative Frank O. Smith,
If the latter seeks re-election
Mr Wells is a Arm friend of tbe Dis
trict of Columbia and has made a study
of its conditions and needs, which he
declares are almost identical with those
of Maryland. Should he be elected. Mr.
Wells says that he will work for the
District and be Its representative as well
as the one that sent him to Congress.
"It Is true." Mr Wells said jesterday.
that I have decided to enter the pri
maries next ear I have consulted with
my friends and the assurances of sup
por which already have been given me
convince me that I will win.
"My decision Is final and I shall been
at once to organize my campaign. This
will result In a personal canvass of the
district and before I have finished I ex
pect to meet and greet every Democrat
Ir the district I shall confine my cam
paign to a discussion of national Issues
and shall make no attacks whatever
upon any opponent I may have."
Mr. Wells Is a resident of Hyattsville
and practices law In the Maryland and
District of Columbia courts. He has a
wide reputation as an advocate, particu
larly In criminal cases He has been sc
tive In Marv land politics for years and
was urged by many friends to make the
race for Congress at the time J. Enos Ray
was nominated against Thomas Parran
three years ago
Representative Frank O. Smith, who re
deemed the Fifth District from Republi
canism In the last election, has not indi
cated whether or not he would be a can
didate to succeed himself. He Is not In
high favor Just now with many of the
organization leaders In his district, and
may decide 'that one term is enough for
him.
This announcement Is particularly Inter
esting because It Is rumored that Judge
Ashley Gould, of the District Supreme
Court, Is to be a candidate for the Re
publican nomination. Judge Gould, until
he was appointed to the bench, lived In
Montgomery County and was a few years
ago a candidate for "the Republican Cor
gresslonal nomination against George A.
Pearre. He is now, it Is said, about to
move Into Prince George County.

A constitutional amendment to pro

The only way to handle the liquor
traffic is to destroy It. said Senator Shep

principles, for the expenditure of public
money to the end of attaining the great
est public benefit.
An elaborate welcome had been planned

and made an addres.
Atr. Newman's explanation of the Ideal
that has guided the Commissioners In
their difficult task of Drenarlntr the Dls
trlct'8 estimates, was applauded at fre
quent Intervals. The applause was
especially vigorous when he said.
Congress follows our recommendation as
to street Improvements, lt will not be
possible to point to a single dollar of
me appropriation as having been made
or expended for purposes of real estate
exploitation."
liliiresa of 3fr. Xeivmnn.
In part. Commissioner Newman's ad
dress was as follows:
"We decided first that we wo61d en
deavor to find out from the citizens' as
sociations Just what each community
constuered necessary in the way of street
Improvements. We decided that we would
ask the associations to take us on trips
cf Inspection of each neighborhood, so
that lt could be pointed out to us Just
what was needed. Our Idea was that we
would obtain, first. Whatever organized
public opinion there was, and, second,
that wa would sea with our own eves
Just what was wanted'tind near with our
own ears Just why it was wanted.
'We began carrying out this policy
very blithely and full of hopes and high
purposes, but. after making six or seven
Inspection trips with representatives of
citizens associations, we found that It
was coins to be a physical Impossibility
to cover tho District In that way. We.
therefore, did what we believed was the
next best thing we asked tho associa
tions to submit to us In writing: the im
provements which they wished to recom
mend In the order of their importance
or need. When we had recelveed prac-
tieallv a complete list or such recom.
mendatlons. covering practically the en
tire District, we had made a single com
prehensive table, showing those recom
mendatlons. With this in our bands we
got Into an automobile and visited every
community whose association had sub
mitted recommendations, and personally
Inspected the street which they recom
mended for Improvement. Altogether, I
think we spent a week or ten days going
over the -District with a fine, tooth comb
ana isuxuiiAnxing; ourselves wiia uie con
dition in each neighborhood.
"With the written memoranda contain
ing the recommendations of the associa
tions In our hands, and with a picture
of the conditions themselves In our
minds, we sat down and prepared our
recommendations to Congress.
"At that point In our work we evolved
another principle of procedure, and that
was as to which streets we should se
lect to recommend for Improvement. The
principle agreed upon and followed was
this: First, that we would recommend
for Improvement those squares in which
the Improvement of private property was
complete or practically complete. That
is. If we found a block built up with
houses on both sides of the street, occu
pied, and In use by the people who owned
or rented those houses, wo recommended
that that block te paved. Tbe feeling we
had about It was that there is absolutely
no reason why a street which ls'com
Pletely, or practically completely, occu
pied should not have the best possible
improv ement-
"Another principle which. we followed
In a few cases was that of recommend
ing for Improvement certain streets
which, although not completely built up
and occupied, were extensively used for
through traffic from one community to
another. In some of those cases there
has been a block recommended for Im
provement which was not a finished
street, so far as residents are concerned,
but a street whose Improvement was
considered necessary because of through
travel upon It.
"Following these two principles, we
found that in almost all cases our rec
ommendations were the same as the rec
ommendations of the citizens of the vari
ous neighborhoods, demonstrating con
clusively to us that the attitude of the
citizens is eminently fair and In no sense
selfish.
No Heal Estate Exploitation.
I think you will be glad to know an
other result of adherence to this street
Improvement policy on our part. When
we got all through making up ouf sched
ule of streets to be recommended for Im
provement, we found that there was not
one foot of Improvement recommended in
which the expenditure of the public
funds for that Improvement would result
In benefits to any speculative real estate
dealer. If Congress follows our recom
mendations as to street Improvements. It
will not be possible to point to a single
dollar of the appropriation as having
been made or expended for purposes f
real estate exploitation. The basis of
our recommendations will be found to
be the actual needs, of actual residents
of each block. I also believe that If
Congress follows our recommendations lt
will be Impossible for any section of the
city to feel that it has been discrimi
nated against to Its disadvantage and
to the adrantaga of any other section.
"I tell you these things, not becaOM
we are seeking your approval and not
because of any pride In having achieved:
a good result, but because we are new
to the positions which wo hold, and want
you to know what we are doing and
how we are doing It, to the end that
you may bring lt to our attention If wa
are not serving you as you ought to be
served. No Board of Commissioners
would deserve any credit for working
out a policy and practice as to street
Improvement such as J have outlined to
you, because such a policy and practice
Is. In my opinion, nothlnr more than
right and Just."

Hearings on various bills to bar from
Interstate commerce mlsbranded and
adulterated articles of every descrip
tion were begun by a subcommittee of
the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce yesterday.
Representative Campbell, of Kansas,
author of one of the bills which applies
specifically to shoes, urged the commit
tee to enact legislation to keep Im
pure goods from Interstate trade, saying:
"No manufacturer ha3 the right to
filch from the public on an article which
is not what It purports to be. A reputable
manufacturer would not put his name
on an adulterated product."
Campbell brought to the committee room
a number of shoes which he said were
not made of pure leather.
The bills pending before the House
committee require also the labeling of
s!lk,cotton. and woolen fabrics, with a
statement of their actual composition.
Several Washington merchants and
Harry Fisher, a Buffalo, N. Y, merchant,
attended the hearing yesterday and will
be heard later. The merchants before
tbe subcommittee yesterday were Harry
