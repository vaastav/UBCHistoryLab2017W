THE LAND FRAUD INDICTMENTS.
There are undoubtedly two ways of
looking at most of the indictments con
cerning public lands that have been
brought by the federal grand ;ury in
Topeka recently. While these are
spoken of as land frauds, only a few of
them are lealiy fraud cases those in
which frauds have been practice 1 !n
se.-urjng title to public land. persons
guilty of these crimes should, of course,
be severely punished.
Most of the indictments, however,
have been for fencing public lands
lands open to homestead, and to which
the cattlemen fencins it in have no
claim. This is not a fraud, but simply
a misdemeanor in violation of law.
The defense of the cattlemen is that
they own all the territory surrounding
the government land and that they sim
ply fence their own property; that they
cannot help it if the government land
happens to lie inside cf theirs; thxt the
government land as a rule is not rrcod
for anything except grazing and would
not be homesteaded even if it were -not
fenced. Some of them also assert that
they have been assured by government
inspectors that they would not be prose
cuted for fencing public lands without
first having been given due notice to
take their fences down.
This is the cattlemen's side of the case,
but the Tact remains that they were
openly violating the law, and they
knew they were. They have r.o right to
assume that the government hind would
not be homesteaded If it were not fenced
it does not belong to them and they
have no more right to it than though
it belonged to a private individual.
The Berry traged in Cheyenne coun
ty was largely the result of fencing pub
lic lands within the' Dewey ranch
lands on wheh the Berry family settled.
Trouble necessarily followed. Govern
ment land inside of a big ranch pasture
would need to be of considerable value
to tempt the average man to homestead
it and risk having:, trouble with the
wealthy land owner who has it entirely
surrounded with his own. lands and
fences.
If a- ranch owner has been promised
immunity from prosecution by a. govern
ment official, that is a matter for the
court to take into consideration in try
ing the case. The fact remains that the
law has been violated. The only right
way to do is to respect and obey the law.
The cattleman who does that will have
no trouble with the government.
TOPEKA AND THE GAS BELT.
The Commercial club of Topeka is
orfering free gas for a year to all fac
tories located there. The gas is from
the Kansas Natural nmins and comes
from Montgomery county. This is
the same gas which lite Topeka papers
yelled so loudly last year should be
sent throughout the state for the pur
pose of reducing the price of the
"poor man's fuel.'' The residents of
the county where the gas was in use
and where it. was discovered and de
veloped with their money, at their
risk, are to see the product of their
daring sent to TopeKa, not for the
"poor man's fuel." but for the rich
man's greed. And a lot of legislators
who cared nothing for the equities in
the case prevented the passage of a
bill to prevent it. ill the people
ever elect a legislature that will pass
honest laws? Iola Record.
Isn't the Record's memory a trifle
overheated? As the State journal re
members the controversy about piping
gas last year, the gas belt people said
they had no objection to piping it
within the state, but they did object
to piping it over to Missouri. The
rallying cry was "Kansas gas for Kan
sos," and as Topeka is in Kansas it
naturally s'upposed it is is entitled to
natural gas, providing it is willing to
pay the price.
If the State Journal is not mistaken
numerous gentlemen, not only in To-
peka but also from other parts of the
state, have put both money and labor
into the gas belt, developing the fields,
and it is difficult to see how it is "the
product of the daring" of the people
of Montgomery, or any. other single
county.
The gas belt still has a tremendous
advantage over towns which have to
depend on piped gas. Down there gas
is almost free, while Topeka has to
pay twenty-five cents a thousand feet
for it for household use and fifteen
cents for manufacturing purpose.".
Why should the gas belt begrudge us
the use of a little of its products, inas
much as we are willing to pay for it?
AS TO VENE7AELA.
One of the subject? which has been
before the American . people to a con
siderable extent during the last three
or four years is our controversy or
supposed controversy -with Venezuela,
and it is a matter of some moment
that not a word concerning this sub
ject appears in the presidents mes
sage. This is taken to mean that our
alleged difficulties with Castro's coun
try have been disposed of, for which
the American people will be extremely
grateful. The Washington Post, in
discussing this matter says:
"An interesting and significant fea
ture of the president's message is to
be found in the careful, almost osten
tatious, industry with which it ignores
Venezuela. For two or three years
past, and up to the moment of Mr.
Root's assumption of the portfolio of
state, Venezuela has been a burning
issue. During the Hay regime, with
'Loomis, acting,' to the: fore, we were
scowling at Venezuela almost con
stantly. It is not too much to say. in
deed, that we contracted the habit of
threatening Castro and. promising him
hostile ultimatums and naval demon
strations any fine morning you might
name. We nursed in our affectionate
arms the bleeding martyrs of the New
York asphalt trust. Their wounds
were ours. Their wrongs ranked in a
iiosom which but no matter now.
Castro was a devastating tyrant. Our
adventurers In Venezuela were the
pathetic victims of his wickedness.
XewsoaDer correspondents enjoying
the confidence of the state department
told their papers every day that some
thing dreadful would, happen right
away, if not sooner, and the always
credulous and complacent home editor
reproduced the oracle under glowering
headlines. Yet. now the president,
after careful contemplation of the
fads submitted to him by intelligent
and honest menr omits Venezuela in
the formulation of his deliberate horo-
cope. And there we are! The lnol-
dent
closed -honorably, thank
and the country has reason
heaven
to rejoice in the fact that President
Roosevelt at last has at his elbow an
adviser who wants - the - light- and
knows how to turn it on."

in the friendliest spirit to Brother
Stubbs. It costs nothing, and if at the
end of a year Stubbs can find that if it
is not good advice, he can bring it back
and get his investment returned. This
looks fair enough.

FREE SEEDS.
About the most ridiculous thing
that has come to notice lately is the
action by the leading seeds dealers in

fact not half of the free reed is ever
planted, it is usually unreliable and a
gardener would not waste time upon
it. The free seed graft is a moderately
harmless diversion for our congress

say anything against it. The seeds

THE NEW CONGRESS.
The Fifty-ninth congress assembled
yesterday with a. large Republican ma
jority, in which it is impossible not to
take satisfaction as an evidence of the
people's trust in the party and its policies,
but which from other points of view is
not without its disadvantages. Speaker
Cannon's short address acknowledging
his deserved re-election, after piomising
faithful and impartial performance of
dutv on his part, justly enforced upon
the minds of the members their duty to
attend to business and make the session
a success. It not infrequently happens
in legislative bodies that a small majority
is really more competent to transact
business than a very large one, because
under a greater sense of responsibility.

Miss Granniss' Decision.
(By A. M. Davie-s Ogden.)
It is so fatally easy for a misunder
standing, to arise.
Johnson, galloping swiftly through
the long lane of overhanging June
green, was musing somewhat bitterly
upon this fact. It was over a month
now since be bad seen Helen Grannis.
A month which had done a great deal
toward quickening a spark, hitherto
not entirely recognized, into a vivid
flame. He had tried to see her but un
successfully, and now bis thoughts were
brooding as so often before, over that
last unfortunate meeting. Was he to
blame or she? Yet how could the
fault be his?
Once again he went back, mentally,
to the beginning; that day when he
had telegraphed t0 as( j ghe would
ride. They had often spoken of so do
ing, and this had been his first oppor
tunity. The answer had been that she
would be at the club at 4 o'clock.
Johnson, promptness itself, cantered
over from the stable at 4. precisely.
There he waited. He waited until half
after four; he waited until quarter of
five. There was no sign of Miss Gran
nis. At last, reluctantly, he rode to
wards the rark, wondering what could
have happened. The first person ho
met, walking her horse slowly down
the main drive in the direction of the
gate, was the girl herself and with her,
talking eagerly, was Ransome Sinclair.
The man of all others whom Johnson
most detested.
For a moment Johnson had stared,
really incredulous, unable to trust his
eyes.
Then, with a formal lifting of his
hat, he was past, the dark red mount
ing to his cheek, and rage in his soul.
Had she forgotten the engagement? Or
had she, deliberately thrown him over
for Sinclair? Sinclair with his mil
lions, who could give her everything.
In the sudden blackness revealed by
the flash of Jealousy, Johnson realized
for the first time how much this slen
der, dainty girl, with her pretty little
air of stateliness meant to him.
He had hardly gone a mile before
the impulse which had made him bow
and pass on looked the height of
ridiculousness. Of course there was
some mistake. Why had he not
stopped and asked? But although he
turned at once, it was too late; the two
had vanished.
He had telephoned that night. Miss
Grannis was out for dinner. He had
called the next afternoon. Miss Gran
nis was not at home. He could not
write, for there was nothing to say.
tine could not ask a lady why she had
chosen to riele with another. The week
after when he tried calling once more,
the house was closed. He found that
the family had departed for their
country place.
Johnson was in despair. But it was
not entirely a bad thing for him; it
taught him a lot.
As he turned in now at the New
lands place, and dropped off his horse,
some one moving down by the tejinis
court suddenly brought tils heart into
his mouth. Could it be she? He
knew that Miss Grannis and Ida New
lands were great friends. Was it pos
sible she might be stopping here for a
week end? With tingling pulses he
went forward. It was it was'. And
he might never have known! Some
how he managed to answer properly
the greetings of Ida and the men
grouperl about, then he turned to Miss
Grannis.
He was unreasonable enough to be
disappointed when the girl gave him
merely a conventional smile. He felt
that he was the one with the right to
be angry; Ida Newlands looked sharp
ly at them both. She knew Helen
Grannis well enough to divine that
something had occurred.
Now, as s-he saw Johnson, after a
moment, turn aside, her nimble wit
leaped to a sudden guess at the truth.
And as she caught Johnson's flush as
Sinclair came across the lawn, her
conviction deepened. But what could
be done? In this last month Sinclair
had been pushing his advance hard.
She knew that Helen was wavering.
Ida did not fancy Sinclair, it was her
brother who had asked him today.
And she did like Jolinsor.. With a
swift" inspiration she jumped to her
leet.
"Let's have some tennis," she ex
claimed. "Helen. I will challenge you
and Mr. Johnson to try to beat Mr.
Sinclair anil myself. Here's your
raccjuet." pretending not to see the
girl's reluctance. It was the only way
she could think of to bring them to
gether. Johnson could put up a strong
game. He was tall, with long legs
and arms that seemed to cwver every
corner of the court. And Helen had
a clean, telling stroke. Sinclair, how
ever, was no mean adversary; they
would have to play up. But Johnson
was not thinking of tennis. This was
his chance. He must make the most
of it before she joined that chattering
group. As he brought the balls to
Miss Grannis for her service, he
looked down at her for a moment.
"Why did you not come to the club
that day?" he asked abruptly. "I
waited, and waited "
"Waited!" echoed the girl. "Why "
"Ready" interrupted Sinclair, and
Helen Hashed a ball over the net.
Johnson, his heart beginning to beat
fast, tightened the grip on his racquet.
There had been surprise, unmistak
able surprise, iu Helen's eyes.
"Eid you not expect me to meet
you at the club?" he demanded as
they changed courts.
"You lost that point," was the im
patient response. "No, of course not.
1 always mount at the park entrance."
"But the maid said" persisted
Johnson.
"Then the maid was mistaken. Ah,
be careful." as he nearly missed a re
turned ball.
A strange desire not to be beaten
had suddenly sprung to life in her
breast. They must win this set, she
and Johnson; they must not be
beaten by Sinclair. She looked
across the net at his red. rather
heavy face. Could she marry him?
Her family had hoperl for it; he was
a splendid match, of course and yet
what did Harry Johnson mean by
asking why she had not come to the
club? She had told the maid to say
that she would be at the park en
trance and then to telephone the club
for her horse.
"Waited there an hour," said
Johnson. "And then to meet you
coining out of the park with another
man. What could I think?"
"Ah," said the girl with a quick, in
drawn breath. Couldn't he have
known that she was only walking her
horse up and down while she waited?
The meeting with Sinclair had been
pure chance. She, too, had waited,
growing more and more annoyed with
the awkward position in which she
found herself. Annoyed also by Sin
clair's veiled remarks upon Johnson's
tardiness, his polite wonder. And
then to have Johnson appear, raise
his hat and pass on! The girl bit her
lip again at the memory.
Then suddenly as she caught the
look in his eager, earnest eyes, her
own softened. After all, he had a bad
time, too. And all through that
stupid Marie's having the messages
confused. With an impulsive gesture
she turned. . . .
"Do -play." she exclaimed. "we
must get this set."
Sinclair. rather sulky hi. uem
forced to play on a hot Rfternoon. had
hitherto not chosen to exert himself,
letting the games go to his adver
saries. But now he was beginning to
be Interested. If they were to win,
Johnson must concentrate. And John
son, all at once infected by something
in the girl's manner straightened him
self. The other side should not win a
single game. Love three, love four!
Sinclair, subtly aware of an unwonted
tension in the air. strove his utmost,
unavailingly. Johnson, his mouth
shut hard, played as though muscled
with steel. Love five! Helen was
breathless, her lips parted. Love six!
Set!
With a great sigh Johnson faced
her.
"We've won." he whispered exult
antly, just loud enough for her to
hear. Helen, her eyes unfathomable,
glanced for a moment across at Sin
clair Sinclair, with his millions, then
the sweetest, tenderest smile curving
her mobile mouth, she lifted her face
to Johnson.
"Yes." she said softly "a Love
Match." (Copyright, 1905, by P. C.
Eastment.)
