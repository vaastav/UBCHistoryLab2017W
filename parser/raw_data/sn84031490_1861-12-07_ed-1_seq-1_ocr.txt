SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1861.
CsT" Both Houses ot Congress stand ad
j i aimed over to Monday. There is no report,
therefore, this morning.
dT’Thc Van Wyck Investigating Com
mittee of the House will make their report
i;n army frauds, next Monday. The report
has been delayed some days in the hands
of the printer. It was intended to he ready
«’ii Tuesday last, following the President's
Message.
t3TAtt*ac of apprehension is noticeable
hi the New York press of Thursday, lest
by mean? of tampering with returns in dis
tricts still to be heard from, an attempt
will be made to unseat Opdyke, and give
the election to Gunther. Fortunately it is
r.t‘. Wood, for Fernando stands third on
the list; but it will not be much better for
the city that the Tammany candidate suc
teedr. which is unlikely.
England admits Jeff. Davis's priva
te ers all the privileges of her ports: the

that the Sumter was permitted to coal at

THE CANA Si ENLARGEMENT.
();*. the fourth page, in the report of the
]•, . ;;r a of Supervisors, trill he found the ac
;i i: of that body in relation to the Illinois
end Michigan Canal. A proposition was
made to appropriate five hundred dollars
t "wards the survey: hut some of the mem
ber,- doubting whether the Hoard had an- j
tlioritv to make it, the resolution was not
d. It will be seen, however, that
Uk v pledged themselves to co-operate with
others, and do all in their power to secure
s-i desirable an object. The entire nation
an immense interest in the enlarge
ment of the canal; and it ia only necessary
that its relations to the military' necessities
of the country should be understood to se
cure all requisite aid from Congress to
complete it at an early clay.
DISPENSABLE MEANS.
Or.c word used by President Lincoln in
Ids Message was murdered by the tele
graph, probably tbe most important and
pregnant in the whole. The telegraph
made the term ** dispensable" read “ defen
sible!' The President’s phrase was as fol
lows :
The T':ion 77 hi preserved. and Tunes all dis
means must C*tii4jilvyed.
According to Worcester, the first mean
ing of the adjective thus used, is ‘‘that
which maybe dispensed,” though the word
itself is one which Mr. Lincoln brought
with him from the Courts. The President
avows his determination to use all means
available and possible for the preservation
of the Government. But we submit that
the telegraph was not altogether wrong;
the means to which we must come at last
win tK* also •• defensible ” in the light of Hu
laanhy, Progress and Justice.
< OTTOS GROWING IN ILLINOIS.
S .rglmm has given us a prairie promise
i-f sm charine, and a few years hence we
h/.-.v require no sweets from Pixie Land.
There Is now an added prospect.lhat we of
Illinois shall grow our own shirts. Recent
ly we gave a historical sketch of the former
cul'ivuliun of the cotton plant in this State
in the aute-stcamboat-and-raUroad-days of
I*4o, when thousands of yards of linseys
werf made of Illinois cotton and wool
We shall refer to the subject more at length
a? h deserves, and the discussion of its cul
ture will be carried on by “Rural’s” letters
in our columns. To show that it is really
an impoUant topic of commercial value
and interest, it deserves to be stated that
we have the information from an unques
tioned source, that five thousand acres in
Illinois will be planted with cotton the
coming rear.
SAVING SLAVERY.
The country has a striking example of
how saving slavery works, in the case of
(jtn. Sherman at Port Koval. He has de
clined ty employ the slaves of the South
Car- .lina rebels, and has disregarded the in-
El: uMions of the TVar Deportment, but has
conducted his campaign, as far as possible,
-on pro-slavery principles. After the fleet
captured the forts and drove away the
rebels, he landed his army and wrote a
UVei deevs: to the chivalry, most affection
ately worded, which they as scornfully spit
ujK)n and rejected. The remainder of lus
lime has been spent in “ fortifying.” A
month has passed away since he landed,
atid not a thing has been accomplished—
gave what the fleet has done. His army is
in a country where the blacks outnumber
the whites six to one, and yet he has not
availed himself of this loyal element as he
•was directed by his instructions to do. At
lust accounts he had not even taken pos
session of Beaufort, beyond keeping gun
boats in the harbor, to prevent the slaves,
who were abandoned by their masters,
from committing depredations on the pro
perty of the run-away rebels. This expe
dition has already cost the Government
over Jive millions of dollars, and such are
the beggarly results up to last advices.
Suppose Gen. Sherman- had pursued the
f>] - .pr?i*.c course, a?his instructions directed,
and had issued his proclamation, calling
upon all Union men without distinction of
c olor, to rally to the support of the old flag,
the summons would have been answered
with joyous alacrity by tens of thousands
YOLTJME XV.
of lotjU people, who would hare flocked to
kis standard, to serve the Union cause. He
could have had an army by this time, of
50,000 men, and Charleston and Savanah
might be in his possession, and the rebel
flyfo© into the interior, panic stricken,
and pursued by his victorious colums.
Every day his army would have
receive thousands of recruits, only too glad
to obey his commands. Gen. Sherman
might have had an' hundred thousand
blacks, male and female, gathering and
baling cotton. He might have loaded, by
this time, twenty Government transports,
and dispatched them to Hew York with !
that much prized commodity. If Sherman
had taken hold of the work iu downright
earnest, he had the materials at hand with
which he could crush but the rebellion iu
South Carolina and Georgia within eight'
weeks from the day he landed at Hilton
Head: and he had it hr his power
to have palsied with, terror the whole rebel
confederacy. Had he pursued such course
no rebel army would be holding General
McClellan at bay, and fliauntingits treason
able flag within ate of the capital and
"White House. He could occupy the fortifi
cations at 3lanassas without a battle. There
would be a Bull Run to Richmond of the
terror-haunted traitors. But by this vigor
ous mode of waging war slavery would
•‘get hurt/’ which is contrary to the policy
which animates either the Generals or the
Administration—the Secretary of War ex
cepted, who has been extensively “ mod
ified-' 1 How much longer is the war to be
conducted on the policy of protecting sla
very while feebly trying to save the Union?
THE ARKANSAS TRAVAILER.
Governor Rector, of Arkansas, is in trou
ble: Ins heart is a -well-spring of melancholy
and bitterness. He travaileth over the con
dition of his State, and, as wc tldnk, Idts
slip incautious -words. He does not felici
tate himself, or his people, in any paragraph
in the Message Gubernatorial He is not
jolly. He isn’t even tolerably easy in his
mind, if we may judge from this mysterious
insinuation:
••llore treason lurks in Arkansas, nmlcrthcgarb
of patriotism, than most men conceive of.’ 1
He refers to the absorbing interest the
cost of the war will possess, and justifies
the expression by showing that it has a -
sorled for the war, up to Nov. Gth, §1,041,-
GO3. The unhappy Arkansites have
hastened to dance to Dude, and they must
now pay the fiddler to the tune of a war
tax of tito per cent. , and that, too, with r.
happy prospect ahead for a State without a
dollar in the Treasury, and over cars (a
mulish pair) in debt at that. Happy State,
happy Gubernator.
The 21th Illinois, Col. Heekor.
The Hecker regiment imbroglio seems to be
more badly mixed than ever. It will be re
membered that among the last acts of Gen.
Sherman, in Kentucky, was the acceptance of
the resignation of the officers (Major Kune
and others) who had been ordered to Spring
field, to await a decision in the case, and the
reinstatement of CoL Hccker, who had been
spending his time in Lebanon. Straightway
Col. Hcckcr sent to the Governor of Illinois
the list of the officers whom he desired to
have appointed, and there being some objec
tions to them, Lieut. Governor Hoffinan was
called to Springfield to confer with Governor
Yates, and see what should be done. Upon
his suggestion Governor Yates decided to fill
the vacancies by regular promotion, thus
throwing overboard Col. Hcckcr’s entire list.
But the end was not yet- Orders came from
the War Department to General Buell, a few
days since, ordering that Col. Hecker’s offi
cers should be mustered out of the service,
and the old officers (Kune, etc.,) reinstated;
the Department not having heard of the ac
tion that was being taken by Governor Tates.
1 xhc officers were accordingly mustered out.
Col. Hecker has again returned to his home In
Lebanon, and, wc understand, has resigned.
Lt. CoL Mihalotzy is in temporary command.
It is uncertain what the old officers will do,
whether return to the regiment or not. Many
of them, since their discharge by General
Sherman, have been making other arrange
ments. We hope the end of this troublesome
controversy will be reached, and the regiment
saved from demoralization and disgrace.

Col. Austin Light.
It was with pain that we recently gave what
we knew was the true explanation of the
charges against CoL Austin Light, of the
Tates Phalanx, now in Maryland, which have
resulted in his being dismissed from the ser
vice. But it was, we felt, better that one
should suffer, if within the bounds of strict
justice, rather than that a false imputation
should rest on higher authorities on account
of his discharge—an event not to be kept se
cret. In another column we give a detailed
statement of the case, and this, we desire to
:idd, comes from a source entirely new, the
information originally reaching us from Wash
ington. It will be observed that the formal
smd honorable discharge of Col. Light, which
appears in our columns, and is being used as
a proof of his innocence from the charge of
desertion, bears date 1853, several years ante
cedent to his re-enlistment and the events
that followed. We are sincerely sorry for
Col. Light. We know how popular he was
with his fine regiment. We have given our
reasons for having referred to the matter. We
are not mistaken.
Indian Troubles.
The Red Pike Indians arc getting trouble
some. The St Paul j Pioneer says that on
Wednesday last Messrs. Burbank & Co., of
that city, received a message from the Chief
of the Red Lake Indians, on Red River, in
forming them that they could no longer occu
py that portion of the water running through
their lauds, without paying tribute, and re
quested Mr. Burbank to meet him at Red Lake
within a stated time and make payment of
$40,000 for past privileges, or else they would
bum or lake possession of their boat, the An
son Nortlmp. At the earnest solicitation of
the people of Georgetown, Gov. Ramsey has
ordered out one of the two companies ordered
to Fort Abercrombie,to be stationedat George
town, in order to protect the lives and prop
erty of the whites in that settlement. Bar
bank & Co. have agreed to furnish good win
ter quarters for the soldiers.
From Farnaworth’s Cavalry*
We irive in another part of our paper to-day
a variety of information, in communications,
from the camp of Coh Farnsworth’s Illinois
Cavalry. From another source wc learn that
vexations and grievous delays have been ex
perienced in receiving their outfit, and that in
some departments of the same the rascally
contractors have had their “perfect work.”
Furnishing 3 lb. blankets when 5 lbs. is the
regulation, is a difference appreciable just
now. Five hundred of their horses still stand
at the picket ropes, wnNantoffd, in December.
The progress in drDI by the regiment is
highly spoken of, and yet it is hard to see how
it is so good as to justify their taking the field
before they have been provided with sabres.
The entire armament of the 1200 men to-day
arc forty carbines, for guard duty. The com
ing neck they are to take their position to
trout of Alexandria, in Gen. Sumner’s col
umn.
From MlMonri.
Senator Waldo P. Jolmson has not taken
his scat, and probably never wilL The vacan- •
cy, it is rumored, is to be filled by Colonel
John B. Henderson, from the Interior of the
State. Trusten Polk has taken his seat, but
will not enjoy a long term of its enjoyment.
He is to be brightened up a little by a process
announced in our dispatches of last night, as
already begun. Probably Frank Biair will
succeed Polk, by appointment of Gov. Gam
ble, in a short lime.
An order is to be forthwith issued by Gov.
Gamble for an election for Representative in
Congress in the District lately represented by
Gen. John B. Clark, gone to the Southern
Confederacy, and also in the District from
which Gen. John W. Reid was elected, who
has followed Clark- It is desirable that the
representation of Missouri in Congress should
be speedily filled with loyal men.
THE CASE OF COL. AUSTIN LIGHT,
Cause of his Dismissal from Service.
Austin Light, ex-Colonel of the 39th regi- |
ment, better known in this city aa the Tates }
Phalanx, enlisted in the regular army of the ;
United States on the 28th day of June, 184S, |
in the, cavalry recruiting department. He |
served his term of enlistment, which expired \
in 1853, and was honorably discharged from ;
the seirice on the 28th day of June, 1853. i
His discharge is signed by Capt. C. F. Buff, :
Brevet Major, U. S. A. He afterwards rc-cn
llstcd as a private in Company D, Ist Cavalry, ;
in the spring of 1857. He was promoted to ;
Fourth Corporal before the expiration of many I
weeks. This company was commanded by !
Capt. James Mackintosh. He served in this I
position during the Cheyenne expedition under j
Col. Sumner, and on the return of the regiment j
from said expedition in the winter, he re- i
ceived a ten days' furlough from his Captain, j
At the expiration of his furlough Corporal
light did not return. In other words, he
deserted the service. He had at that time
only served one year of his new term. Subse
quently, and in 1859, he once more enlisted in
the infantry for the general recruiting service
of that arm. He was thereupon despatched
to St. Louis as recruiting sergeant in said
service. He was there recognized by his for
mer commander, Col. (now Gen.) Sumner.
Under his orders he was arrested as a deserter,
tried by a. Court Martial, and condemned to be
flogged and drummed out of the service.
In laying these facts before the public I
cannot forget that the charge of injustice lias
been preferred against the movers in this mat
ter. It has been asserted that petty jealousy
dictated it, and that envy and malice had fur
thered it. Whether a desire on the part of
these gentlemen who are engaged in both the
regular and volunteer services, to keep their
profession free from the disgrace of having iu
such high command officers who arc in re
ality deserters —I say whether this natural
wish on their part be petty jealousy, malice or
envy, or the contrary, I shall not here pretend
to determine. Suffice it to say that were our
regiments commanded by deserters, our
chances In this war were small, and wc think
our opinion will be indorsed by every intel
ligent man cither in the service or out of it.

The t7. S. Sanitary Commission.
The recent report of the United States Sanitary
Commission contains details of the condition
of the army, and is therefore very voluminous.
Since their organization they have received and
expended two hundred thousand dollars,
raised from voluntary contributions. During
the month of November they have spent one
thousand dollars per day for articles for inva
lids in the army. Twenty-five inspectors arc
employed by the Commission, whose duties
arc to ascertain the necessities oflhchospitols^

Blcnker, which it is thought will result in his
leaving It for another command, lies between
him and Col. Stahl, acting as General of one
of the Brigades. A faction has sprung up be
tween the officers and men, and it is thought
that Gen. Banker will terminate his connec
tion with the division.

CHICAGO, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1861.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
THE INTERIOR.
GENERAL LAND OFFICE.
The business of tbe Department of the Inte
rior has lost much of its usual interest through
the interruption of commercial and agricultu
ral pursuits by the war. The General Land
Office, especially, shows the result of this de
cline. The army has swallowed up almost en
tirely the class of enterprising men who arc
usually the purchasers of Government lands,
and sales in the Northern States are almost
suspended. On the 80th of September last
there was an aggregate of 134,218,330 acres of
land surveyed and ready for sme. During the
fifteen months, ending Sept. 30,1861, the De
partment disposed of 5,289,532 acres. Of this
amount over two millions acres have been lo
cated with bounty land warrants; one and a
half millions gold for cash, producing $925,299;
and about a million granted to Louisiana,
Michigan and Minnesota, for railroad pur
poses. The war has thus reduced the receipts
of the office to a point but little above the ex
penditures of the Department, its net income
during the year being but $200,000. The
bounty land warrants and scrip issued up to
Sept. 00, 1861, cover an aggregate of 71,717,172
acres. The lands have been distributed thus:
Acres.
For revolutionary services 8.300.612
For services in the British war. 4,850,130
For Canadian volunteers T2130
For services in the Mexican war, &c 51,138,970
Yet to he located on warrants and scrip
already issued - 7,45i.T2
The report questions the propriety of is
suing bounty land warrants to the volunteers
now in the national army. A warrant for 100
acres to each volunteer would absorb over
100,000,000 acres. The warrants are now sold
In the market at fifty cents per acre; and an
attempt to realize on their warrants would de
press the soldiers 7 grants to even a much
lower value. Speculators would buy uplands
largely under such circumstances, and would
be the chief gainers by these public
benefactions. The Secretary, therefore,
recommends that the volunteers be paid
either in cash or by Government securities.
It is suggested that in Heu of the mineral lands
of California and New Mexico being free, the
Government shall make them a source of rcv«
enue by levying a charge for the privilege of
working tlie mines. The Report makes a
strange statement respecting the commission
appointed to “ run and mark the boundary
lines between the territories of the United
States and the State of California. 17 Fifty-tFve
thousand dollars was. appropriated for the
work by Coneress, and $37,551 of the amount
placed at the disposal of Sylvester Mowry, the,
Commissioner for the United States. The
Secretary finds, however, that the whole of
the latter sum and twenty thousand dollars
more had been expended, and thework only just
begun. The running of boundary lines be
tween the U. S. territories and Texas has been
completed.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
Indian affairs are in a yen* -unsatisfactory
stale. The Cherokces. Chickasaws, and Choc
taws have suspended all intercourse with the
agents of the Federal Government, the South
ern agents who were iu office on the 4th of
ilarclThaving employed their influence in in
citing those tribes to revolt. The Department
has no official advices confirmatory of the
newspaper reports that a portion of the natives
have been organized as a military force. The
withdrawal of the Federal troops and the em
ployment of threats by the rebel agents,
coupled with promises that the Confederate
government would assume the responsibility
of their annuities, have been the chief means
of inducing their revolt. The payment of
annuities to’these tribes has been suspended;
but the Secretary recommends that Congress
shall make the usual appropriations, so as to
provide the fulfilment of the treaty stipula
tiouslf it should afterwards be found expe
dient to pav the annuities. The tribes ou the
the Pacific slopes have shown symptoms of
turbulence. The withdrawal of troops from
New Mexico has given license for the commit
tal of depredations by some of the tribes in
that territory. The tribes in Kansas and Ne
braska are loyal and progressing in civiliza
tion. The licenses to trade with the Indians
have been so shamelessly abused by cheating
the natives and selling them goods at a profit
of three to four hundred per cent., that the
Secretary recommends that all such licenses
be revoked, and the Indians supplied with
goods and implements only through the
agents of the Department.
THE PATENT OFFICE.
No Department shows more severely the
effects of the war on our industries than the
Patent Office. Instead of being a source of
revenue, the expenditures of the Department
from Nov. 1 to Sept. 30,1561, exceeded its re
ceipts by $82,785. This has necessitated the
discharge of thirty clerks, and the reduction
of the salaries of those retained. The report
complains that the clerks of the United States
District Courts fail to forward copies of works
copyrighted at their offices, the object of col
lecting in one library copies of all the copy
right literarv productions of the country
being thereby defeated. To remedy this, it is
proposed that ike sole power of granting
copyrights be delegaledto the Commissioners
of Patents.
PENSION OFFICE,
The number of pensions during the year has

The Report promises that a digest of the
long-expected census shall shortly appear.
The result, It is said, will prove the last de

that, to supply a public want generally felt, a
bureau of statistics and agriculture shall be
added to the Department of the Interior,
which has the recommendation of not adding
to the expenditure of the office.
AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
Bv an order of last May, the execution of the
law'for the suppression of the slave trade was
confided to this Department. The Secretary
convened the Marshals of all the loyal Atlantic
States at New York, and explained to them all
the devices of the traffic. The result of this
energy has been the capture and condemnation
of five vessels. One person has been convicted
as the captain of a slaver, and sentenced to
death—the first instance of a capital convic
tion on record; and another has been found
guiltv for tilting out a slaver at Boston. With
in a little more than a year, 4,500 Africans, re
captured by our cruisers, have been taken

Armory for Chicago—Naval Station

[Washington Cor. (Ist) Milwaukee Sentinel.]
Bong oxer at the Department* the otter
dar, I learned of a new proposition no tv on the
tapis, and which will be brought with consid
erable force before Congress, at its present
session. It is to erect a National Armory at
Chicago, build a Navy Yard at Milwaukee, and
strongly fortify the‘Straits of Mackinac. I
could”write a small sized volume on the bene
fits of having the Navy Yard at Milwaukee,
and the facilities which its harbor affords, over
others, but as you can do it so much better
than I can, Til let you do it. As to fortifying
the Struts, that should not be neglected a
dar, for it is a moment fraught with too much
, importance to be neglected. lake Michigan,
with all its huge ports, would be thus protec
ted. From what I can learn, the matter re
ceives especial favor among the Congressmen.
The President and Secretary Cameron.
A serious disagreement has occurred be
tween the President and Secretary Cameron,
which will doubtless result in a chance In Mr.
Lincoln’s constitutional advisers. While the
cause of this disagreement is to be deplored,
inasmuch as it exhibits a deficiency on the
part of the President that not to be ex

have been made aware of the position of Mr.
Lincoln and members oT his Cabinet, is not to
be regretted. The light which was carefully
denied by the President, in his Message, has
thus been, by accident, shed upon the country.
The Secretary of War has reflected the senti

Two Bullies Shot Dead,
A few days since, while Lieat. Sloan, of the
New York Thirty-first Regiment, was officer
of the guard, a number of bullies of the regi

called out the guard, but they not obeying, he
drew his revolver and shot one of the leading
mutineers, named Scottie, dead. Gen. Frank
lin investigated the matter, and finding it to
be a clear case of self-defence, he took no far
ther notice of it. Three days since, a round
robin was sent to Gen. Franklin, threatening
the life of Lieut. Sloan, if he was not tried for
the killing of Scottie. Two days since, Sloan
was again attacked by the same party, and he
again settled the difficulty by shooting an
other dead, since which event he has not been

“ The case in regard to pirates by the in

longer than twenty-four hours, anS from, supplies
except of coals for twenty-four hours’ consump

by the answer of Earl EussclL affirms tho.sepiratcs
to visit her ports and stay at thel£own pleasure,
receiving supplies without restriction. We find it
difficult to believe that the Goverpmcnt of Great
Britain has constituted this exception withfnD de
liberation. I intimated in a preceding dispatch
thehopc that the subject might bojeonsidered be
fore it should be necessary for hs to consider
what remedies we can adopt to pffivent the evils
which must result to our comment from the pol

thereupon. Meantime lam diiectjdby the Presi

several prominent secessionists spoke, urging
a united effort in behalf of the rebels. Similar
meetings have been held in Clay, Ray, and oth
er river counties, and subscriptions for money,
clothing, &c., are in circulation. It is not,
perhaps, generally known, but- it is be
lieved to be a fact that the court of Saline
countv, (Claiborne Jackson’s residence,)
in JulV last authorized commissioners to raise
sloo,dbo to be expended for the benefit of
Price’s army. Other comities along the Mis
souri river arc believed to have done the same
thing. It is stated on good authority, that
when Price was besieging Lexington, a dele
gation of citizens was sent to him from Saline
eounrv with an urgent request that he
would not allow his army to enter that
community, which was complied with. The
reason of* this request was because of the
creat dread entertained by the inhabitants of
that comity of the plundering propensities of
Price’s rebels. The counties along the Mis
souri Iriver, west of Jefferson City, are the
richest in the State, and have furnished nearly
as many men and as much means in behalf of
the rebellion as the balance of the State, while
they have been almost entirely exempt from
marauders, and have merely been “visited”.by
Federal troops.

the case, points to the recent visit of the

Wood, who has just returned from Washing
ton, succeeded in procuring two thousandsa
bres and revolvers for the equipment of Illi
nois cavalry. These, and the four thousand
French muskets recently sent to Cairo, will
do for a beginning in arming and equipping
our Illinois soldiers. We need a great deal
more of the same sort.
Col. w. P. Kellogg, of the 7th cavalry, is
in Washington, securing arms for his regi
ment. He has already shipped 1,140 sabres,
and will send forward a like number of pistols
in a day or two.
The following Is a correct statement of
the number of troops now in Camp Butter;
I’faniry.—SS d regiment, Col. Logan, 781; 46th,
Col. Davis, 492 ; 49th, Col. Morrison. 453; Tates
Sharpshooters, 820; nnaasisned.4so-total, 2,496.
• Cavalry.— 6th regiment. Lient. Colonel WiloTt
967 ; 7th, CoL Kellogg. 738; 10th, Colonel Barrett,
SSI-total, 2.592.
Artillery —Major Stollbrand’s battalion, 813.
Total nmnber of troops in camp, 5,800.
The barracks willbe finished before the close
of the week, should no untoward circumstance
prevent, when the comfort and convenience
of the boys will be greatly improved-
We are Informed that the.- delay m the pay
ment of the soldiers at Cainp Butler arises,
from the difficulty in getting proper muster
rolls from the officers of companies or squads
upon ■which to make Ibe-payment, Captains
Wilcox and Hempstead, United States Axmy
Paymasters, have been in the city for some
weeks, waiting to have this done, when they
will immediately proceed to make payments
to the boys at camp.
—At the close of the session of the court mar
tial upon Col. UpdegrafF, of the sth Cavalry,
we are unable to make known the decision of
the court, as its proceedings had to be ap
proved by the Commander-m-Cluef to render
them binding. Owing to the severe illness of
Gov. Yates, “this approval has not, until re
cently, been rendered. We may now be per
muted to state that the finding of the court,
which has been approved by the Governor,
was that Col. Updograff be dismissed from the
service. The sth Gavalrv is, therefore, with
out a Colonel.
Rebels vs. Refugees.
[From the Missouri Democrat, 6th.]
Some six hundred dollars’ worth of clothing,
blankets, <fcc., belonging!© exchanged Conip
Jackson prisoners,’-'has been Justly confiscat
ed, and assigned for distribution among the
Southwest refugees. These goods had been
assiduously gathered by H. B. Belt, to be by
him forwarded to their respective claimants in
the lines of the enemy. The work of accumu
lating the articles was.permitted to progress
until the day preceding that of the contemplat
ed shipme nt. Much Jov was thus allowed to
•nl ven the spirit s of secession circles, and great
magnanimity was displayed in the gathering
of valuable contributions for the aid and com
fort of traitor friends among the rebels. There
was, therefore, ‘bitter disappointment, and
curses less loud than deep, when a file of sol
diers appeared at Belt’s depot, in the Church
ill building, and removed thcprecionsbaggage
cn masse to the Provost Marshal’s office. '"That
functionary considerately permitted each of
the rebel braves to retain his uniform and
some articles of prime importance, but reserv
ed the rest for the cause of the country. The
property will very slightly compensate the
victims'of rebel tyranny in the Southwest for
the losses and sufferings so mercilessly and
needlessly inflicted upon them.
From Western IttlssourJ,
[From the Missouri Democrat. 6th.]
TVe understand that Jcnnison's command
has evacuated Kansas City by order of Gen.
Hunter, and is retiring: toward Leavenworth.
The Union families aiid merchants are conse
quently preparing to leave the place, cam-lag
with them all the provisions and household
supplies in their possession. The telegraph
office is to be closed immediately at Indepen
dence, as well as Kansas City, and in a few
days the rebels will have full swing in all
. the territory west of "Warrensbunr and south
from the Missouri river to the Arkansas lino.
The number of Union men left in Pettis, Sa
line, Lafayette and Jackson counties Is very
small, and the secessionists themselves wifi
be the greatest sufferers by the depredations
of Price’s gang.
A Dawning Sense.
[From tie Cincinnati Gazette. Dec. 4.]
At last it has dawned upon the slow, obtuse
and over-indulgent Northern mind, that it is
verr foolish to be petting, protecting and fos
tering that element in the South which is em
ployed most effectively against the Govern
ment; that it is idle to declare dumb ships
and dead acres confiscated, while doing no
thing about property that can think, talk, dig
trenches and fight. ’ The simple absurdity of
this appears to" have struck many minds at
once—the folly of lunger upholding and
strengthening the only element of the South
ern population that gives the rebellion a for
midable character.
