? J
We have Congress on our hands ?
once more.
r ( I
The length of the President's mes- o
sage also indicates the prevalence of F
the expansion idea. ?
Mr. Bryan says the Republicans
had too much money in the last campaign.
They also had too many votes.
It is stated that Mr. McKinley's plu- 11
rality of the popular vote is 877,900.
It is enough for all practical purposes.
Strawberries from California are
being sold in the East at a dollar a 1
dozen. The berries are not as large j
as the price. s
If every peg is to have a hole there ^
will have be a vast increase in offices j,
in West Virginia under the next administration.
r
A glance at Congress will convince a
almost anyone that the taxation of the w
people is out of ill proportion to their o
representation. ^
ii
If there is a trust of any sort that f
is not getting all that it is entitled to,
just let it step up and make known
its wants to Congress. t]
A Philadelphia man who recently w
went into bankruptcy reports asset9 at 1
$25 and liabilities at $2,S31,0S3. He
made a pretty complete job of it. t
The fact that the increase in our u
standing army is to be a permanent
one is proof positive that the trouble 0
in the Philippines is also permanent, n
The census will give an increased ^
numbei of Congressmen but it is not I
likely that there will be more states- I
men as a result of our greater popula- e
tion.
o
It is said that the lobbyists in
Washington are more numerous than 8
they have been for a long timo and L
are well prepared to make things in- c
teresting for Congressmen. y,
There will be no trouble in get- ^
ting plenty of officers for the proposed p
increase in the army, but it is quite g
certain that few of the private soldiers t;
now in the Philippines will re-enlist. "
The Secretarv of the Navv has n
- - J *
signed the contract for over $16,000,. F
000 worth of armor plate for war ves- v
sels now being constructed. Ain't it ^
nice to be a monopoly with a cinch ? E
It is said that General Egan, who e
had the trouble with embalmed beef, v
is to be restored to favor again. It is E
stretching matters a trifle to construe t
the election as a vindication of Egan r
?but then everything goes these days. 1
Sympathy is one thing and real
help is another. President Paul Kruger
is getting plenty of the former but t
absolutely none of the latter in his tour
of Europe.
Nations are a good deal like indi- ^
viduals in this respect. t
West Virginia has had the office Jof
Internal Revenue Commissioner so
long that she has come to regard the c
place as belonging to her. There are h
therefore a number of candidates from
this State for the vacancy caused by !;
the recent death of Commissioner Wil- J
son. j
The President wauts an ocean ca- j
ble between this country and our ^
Philippine possessions. It has not yet j
been decided whether we shall sub- (
eidize a company and have our leg J
pulled for jears to come, or to go j
down into our pocket for a lump sum j
of about fifteen millions. ]
The Pennsylvania Steel Company,
which has immense iron works at (
Steelton, Pa., has notified its 6,000
workmen that their wages are to b?
reduced 10 per cent, beginning with
January 1st. This is not the sort of
prosperity that tLcoo ritizens of Pennsylvania
voted for a few weeks ago. ,
Strong efforts will be made at this
session of Congress to commit our government
to the work of building the i
Nicaraguan canal, the cost of which '
will be about $200,000,000. We fa- j
vor the schema. Time was when we
did not, but if the United States is to
embark on an era of expansion and '
world-wide exploitation we say let's '
go the whole thing. It has been shown
that the people will staad almost unlimited
taxation, and therefore there 1
should be no hesitation in building ]
????! J i._ 1 "
mt n itajn^udu taum Ul UUUeiiaKlLlg *
any other great enterprise limply on ]
account of the cost. Hooray for the
old Hag and the appropriations.
The Pennsylvania Railroad and the ]
various roads which it controls, includ- ,
ing the Baltimore & Ohio, Norfolk & t
Western and Chesapeake & Ohio, give '
notice that they will advance coal <
freight rates ten cants a ton, beginning \
with the first of notf Anri 1 I .
pers of soft coal have already advauced
prices eighty cants a ton since last (
April, but thsy will probably take ad- ,
vantage of this opportunity to add \
thirty or forty cents more.
There's something absolutely coldblooded
in the way the railroads and
the coal operators are gouging the
people.
Still, that's what the people voted
for last month.
The President's Message.
President McKiuley sent Lis annual
nessage to Congress on Monday. It
s a very lengthy document, the greatr
part of which is taken up with a
liscussion of foreign affairs.
The President shows that for the
-ear ending June 30 last there was a
urplus in in the Treasury of $79,>27,060.18;
that during the same
>eriod the war cost $134,774,767.73,
>r $95,066,486.69 less than during the
(receding similar period, and that the
iavy cost $55,953,077.72, or $7,989, 26.53
less than during 1899.
On the money question he says:
It will be the duty, as I am sure it
rill be the disposition, of Congress to
rovide whatever futher legislation is
ieeded to insure the continued parity
inder all conditions between our two
arms of metallic money, silver and
;old."
He advocates a reduction in taxaion
to the amount of $30,000,000 a
ear. Immediate action is urged to
romote American shipping. On the
ubject of trusts, he makes the same
ecommendations he made in his last
lessage, and thinks those that are inirious
should be restrained.
Much ot the Philippine chapter is
eminiscent, but declares that late reorts
from the Commissioners "allow
yet more encouraging advance toward
good government in the interest
f humanity and with the aim of
uilding up an enduring self-eupportig
and self-administering communif"
After reviewing the circumstances
f the constitutional convention in Cua,
the President announces that when
be convention concludes its labors he
rill transmit to Congress the constituion
for such action as it may deem
dvisable.
The necessity for a Pacific cable beween
the United States and Hawaii,
;ith extension to Manila, is urged
new.
As to the army, the President recmrnends
a minimum of 90,000 anil a
maximum of 100,000 men. Included
a this number authority should be
iven to raise native troops in the
'hilippines up to 15,000, which the
'aft Commission believes will ba more
ffective in detecting and suppressing
nerrillas, assassins and ladrones than
ur own soldiers.
"In our great prosperity we must
uard against the danger it invites of
xtravagance in Government expendiures
and appropriations, and the
hosen representatives of the people
rill, I doubt not, furnish an example
a their legislation of that wise economy
which in a season of plenty husands
for the future. In this era of
reat business activity and opportuniy
caution is not untimely. It will
ot abate, but strengthen confidence,
t will not retard, but promote legitimate
industrial and commercial expansion.
Our growing power brings
nth it temptations and perils requirng
constant vigilance to avoid. It
must not be used to invite contlicts,
lor for oppression, but for the more
elective maintainance of those prin.1

A Guilty Couple Caught.
The Martinsburg World says that
he adventures of a young couple from
Maryland ended in that city last Tueslay
evening by both, one a pretty
'oung girl of nineteen years and the
ither an insurance agent about tweny-six
years of age, being landed belind
the bars of the Berkeley county
ail to answer the three serious charges
>f adultery and two other kindred
:rimea. The charge of bigamy will
ilso be preferred against the man.
The couple, William Strine and
rennie M. fiouck, have been living at
Mathews' boarding-house for the past
ouc weeks under the name of Mr.
ind Mrs. Johnson, the man making a
iving for himself and his alleged wife
>y soliciting insurance policies for the
Provident Life Insurance Company.
So particular notice was taken of the
jouple until Tuesday afternoon, when
Deputy-Sheriff Franklin K. Gersey, of
pnnntr v.t u-lin wua split
I I CUCl IV XX VWUUIJ } ^-4,, ??*..% WW..*
by the man's real wife to bring back
ber runaway husband, informed the
local officers of his mission.
It appears that Strine, who is from
Fountain Rock, Md., tired of the association
of his wife and eloped with
young Miss Houck, of Lewiatown,
Md. Prosecuting Attorney Pitzer
took hold of the case and had three
warrants sworn out before Justice
Byers, which Deputy Sheriffs Hardy
and Tabler served on the surprised
couple. They were placed in jail to
think over their wrougs until given a
preliminary hearing.
Strine owns up to the fact that he
is not married to the girl, but says
his wife drove him away from home
and is now trying to get out her spite
by prosecuting him.
At a hearing the other day Strine
wa? held for court, but the young
woman was discharged and returned
home with her father.
