THE INSULAR CASES.
i
Important Decisions Handed Down
by Supreme Court.
Government Mnst Repay Unties ( ol
lected on Imports from Philip*
pines—Customs Levied Aaralnst
Porto Rico Are Legal.
Washington, Dec. 3.—Porto Rico and
the Philippines became domestic terri
tories immediately ttpon the ratifica
tion of the treaty of peace. The con
stitution followed the flag to all of the
islands, and they immediately became
territories of the United States.
Duties levied in this country against
the products of those islands under the
Dingley law were illegal and must be
returned, but merely because of the
failure of congress to act. The islands
never have been foreign since the
treaty of peace.
The power of congress to pass laws
for the regulation of the territories is
unrestricted. It comes from the con
stitution itself.
The Foraker act, providing civil gov
ernment for Porto Rico, is constitu
tional. The duties ix levied in the
United States and in Porto Rico alike
were legally collected because they
were imposed by an act passed in pur
suance of the constitutional right of
congress to govern the territories as it
sees fit.
Alldutiescoilectedon goods between
the United States and the Philippines
under the Dingley tariff are illegal, be
cause the Dingley tariff specifically
fixes duties on goods coming from for
eign countries, whereas the Philip
pines are domestic.
Congress Can Provide Tariff.
The right of congress to legislate for
the government of the Philippines is
affirmed.and under that right a special
tariff can be provided by congress at
San Francisco and at Manila on goods
going in either direction.
The Philippines art in exactly the
same condition as Porto Rico was
just prior to the passage of the For
aker act. As soon as congress legis
lates for the Philippines those islands
can have free trade or otherwise with
the United States or with other coun
tries, as congress sees fit.
These general principles embody
the sum and substance of the two im
portant decisions handed down in the
supreme court Monday.
W ill Result in Legisla l lon,
The immediate result of the decisions
will be the passage of a law by con
gress establishing a form of civil gov
ernment, no matter how simple, for
the Philippine islands, and establish
ing tariffs on goods entering the is
lands from the United States or else
where. The same act will provide for
the collection of taxes in the United
States on the products of the Philip
pines, and those will not be at the Ding
ley rates, but at such rates as congress
shall fix. The new law will be in its
general principles the same as the
tariff features of,the Foraker act, be
cause it will provide and must pro
vide under the ruling of the court that
the taxes levied on goods brought
from the Philippines shall be used for
the government of these islands and
shall not be turned into the treasury
at all.
Washington, Dec. 3. —Chief Justice
Fuller on Monday announced that aft

DISCUSSED BY CABINET.
Decision)* of Supreme Court in In
sular Cases Quite Satisfactory
to Government.
Washington, Dec. 4. —The cabinet
meeting Tuesday was principally con
sumed in a discussion of the insular
decisions handed down Monday by the
supreme court. On the whole it is
believed the views of the majority of
the court were quite satisfactory to
the administration. It was pointed
out that the ultimate results of the
decisions are in a measure speculative
at present with the exception that
the customs duties collected in this
country on goods slfipped from the
Philippines since the ratification of the
Paris treaty will have to be refunded.
It is not thought, however, that the
aggregate will be large and Secretary'
Gage expects that it will be within
$1,000,000. He called attention to the
fact that the great bulk of the im
ports from the Philippines were acT
mitted free of duty under our gen
eral tariff laws, notably hemp, which
is one of the leading staples of the
islands.
"’he present tariff laws now in op
eration in the Philippines, Mr. Gage
thinks, will need little or no revision.
It was prepared after the most thor
ough and intelligent investigation
and is said to be highly' satisfactory
to the business interests of the is
lands. The preparation of a tariff on
Philippine importations into the Unit
ed States, however, is expected to con-\
siime considerable of the time of con
gress. but there is expectation that,
pending a final settlement of the ques
tion, congress by joint resolution may'
continue 1 the duties imposed by the
Dingley tariff and thus, if it is so dis
posed, cut off a flood of imports which
might follow the announcement that
all duties were removed.
Manila. Dec. 4. —Tim local newspa
pers published extras on the news of
the United States supreme court’s de
cision that the Philippines were
American territory' and that the im
position of duty on articles imported
into the United States from the Phil
ippines is improper. The decision
caused jubilation among the mer
chants and the general public. Repre
sentatives of the principal business
houses say' it will revolutionize the
entire trade of the orient. Civil au
thorities believe the law applies only
to goods going to the United States,
and are anxiously awaiting an official
communication, since, if the decision
holds here, new means for obtaining
funds to run the government will be
necessary'. Gen. Luke Wright, the
vice governor, thinks a general revi
sion of taxation is imperative.
DESPERATE DOOMED MAN.
Murderer Awaiting Execution In Jail
at Mount Holly, X. J., Mates
Dash for Liberty.
Mount Holly, N. J., Dec. 4. —Charles
Brown made a desperate attempt to
break jail a short t:me before the
hour set for his execution Tuesday
morning. As his spiritual adviser,
Rev. J. C. Diesinger, of Camden, was
leaving the cell, in compliance with
a wish of the prisoner that he be left
alone half an hour to prepare himself
for death. Brown suddenly rushed
from his cell armed with a piece of
lead pipe, which he brandished at the
guards. Surprised by the suddenness
of the attack the guards fell back.
Brown dashed down the corridor,
sprang down a short flight of steps and
had reached the kitchen. He waved
aside guards who were following him,
jumped through a window and reached
the yard, where he armed himself with
an ax. One of the deputies who ap
proached the desperate man was
struck on the arm with a piece of pipe,
but others closed in cm Brown and
overpowered him. He was manacled
and placed in his cell to await execu
tion.
At 10:05:30 he was hanged. He
walked to the scaffold without betray
ing the slightest fear and had calmed
down completely after his desperate
attempt to escape from jail.
Death was almost instantaneous.
Washington Hunter, for complicitly
in whose murder Brown was hanged,
was a wealthy retired former of 70
years, and lived with his wife at River
side, N. J.

GIVE THEIR VIEWS.
Foreign Editors Comment on Presi
dent’s Message.
Criticism on the Whole Is Rather Fa
vorable—Position on the Canal
Question Not Regarded as
Cause for Apprehension.
London, Dee. 4. —The London daily
papers, looking at President Roose
velt’s message from the point of view
of its literary power and the wealth
of weighty- matters discussed, regard
it as one of the most characteristic and
remarkable messages ever sent to con
gress. At the same time the papers
recognize its conservative and busi
nesslike moderation and that no at
tempt has been made, as the Morning
Post remarks, “to strike an attitude
or carry- his listeners away-.”
Somewhat Skeptical.
On the whole, however, thA news
papers are skeptical of any great out
come from the president’s efforts in
the direction of reform of the trusts,
anti-anarchism or reciprocity, the idea
being that the senate will effectually
step in and prevent any great changes
in the existing sy-stem.
Most of the papers remark upon the
tone of exultation adopted by Presi
dent Roosevelt in dealing with the
canal question, but they do not show
the slightest disposition to cavil
thereat.
The Daily Telegraph says it would
have been an inconceivably disastrous
blunder to have opposed America’s
wishes in this matter and thus driven
her to build a still greater fleet than
she already contemplated, which, it is
safe to predict,will 20 years hence make
the United States the second sea power
in the world. The Telegraph thinks
that President Roosevelt’s policy- is
calculated rather to diminish than to
increase Europe’s exaggerated dread
of “the American danger.”
No Cause for Apprehension.
The Standard is similarly of the
opinion that nothing in the message
need in the smallest degree excite anx
iety or apprehension abroad. This pa
per comments upon the president’s un
compromising assertion of the Monroe
doctrine as somewhat unnecessary, in
asmuch as there is little desire on the
part of any- foreign power to extend
its area of militarism to the new
world.
Regarding President Roosevelt’s
spirited enunciation of Monroeism,
the Chronicle says: “Whether the
European nations are likely- to re
spect this American prohibition
much longer, when the desirable
colonizing grounds of the world are
being snapped up in a headlong race,
must depend ultimately- upon the
ability- of the United States to en
force their prohibition.”
The “Thunderer’s” Views.
The Times in an editorial on the
message says it is distinguished by
a clearness, firmness and reserved
strength which do not require the
adventitious aid of rhetorical pyro
technics or popular platitudes. “We
certainly have no fatilt to find,” say-s
the Times, “with his language to
wards the British government, or in
deed with his foreign policy general
ly. It is not easy to see how the ex
clusion policy can be enforced. The
United States would to-day be poor
er in many of the finer elements of
its national character if an entrance
fee had been demanded of every set
tler in the early day-s of coloniza
tion.” The Times thinks that re
ciprocity- and the trusts will prove
thorny- problems.
In Germany.
Berlin, Dec. 4. —The message of Pres
ident Roosevelt caused a mild thrill in
Germany. On the boerse, where it was
eagerly awaited, the message was re
ceived with uncommon interest and
the market generally- was slightly
stimulated upon the posting of a bul
letin containing President Roosevelt’s
utterances about trusts. The shares
of the steamship companies fell one or
two points on account of the immi
gration inspection paragraph and the
proposed development of the merchant
marine.
President Roosevelt’s words concern
ing the restriction of immigration con
tain an unpleasant suggestion in the
present state of depression, when, as
the Berliner Yolks Zeitung says, the
hard times make an overflow of the
laboring population of Europe neces
sary-. The free trade and liberal
newspapers welcome the reciprocity
recommendations, but regret that
President Roosevelt did not recom
mend a specific tariff reduction.
The first impression of the presi
dent’s message in German official cir
cles is that the repression of an
archists by international agreement is
much more likely to be carried through
upon the initiative of the United States
than by that of any- other power. An
anti-anarchist proposition from Ger
many- along the same lines as that of
President Roosevelt is probably al
ready on its way to the state depart
ment at Washington.
Taking the message altogether, it
Iras been favorably received both pop
ularly and officially-. The references
it contains to the late Empress Fred
erick are especially appreciated.

THE CUBAN CAMPAIGN.
Maso’* Follower* Declare That Of
ficial Interference In Elec
tion I* Inevitable.
Havana, Dee. 4.—A cablegram
signed by Eusebio Hernandez, presi
dent of the democratic party, has
been sent to Secretary of War Root.
This message says:
“The friends of Gen. Bartolome Maso
hear with great satisfaction your declara
tion that official Interference in the com
ing elections will not be tolerated, but un
der the present arrangements interference
is inevitable, as all members of the cen
tral canvassing board are candidates for
office and are also members of the execu
tive committee of Senor Tomas Estrada
Palma. One of these is the secretary of
state, and other high officials also can
didates. Both high and low officials are
openly working in the interests of Senor
Palma, who is said to have the support
of the United States government. The
situation is delicate and the Cuban people
are alarmed at an alleged attempt to
force a president upon them. They ask
for a fair and honest election.”
A delegation representing Gen.
Maso will shortly leave here for
Washington to submit these facts to
the administration and to suggest
certain changes to insure fair elec
tions. Eusebio Hernandez also rep
resents the coalition of the national
and independent republicans. The
lower classes are enthusiastic over
the candidacy of Gen. Maso. Much
feeling is being worked up against
the official Cuban element, whom the
Masoists claim control the election
machinery.

posing the former heir apparent, Pu
Chun, son of Prince Tuan, the au
thor of Boxer troubles, is generally
considered as the strongest proof
yet given of the sincerity of the em
press’ leaning towards reform. Con
sidered with previous edicts, this
last one appears to corroborate the
belief among Chinese officials that

anti-foreign policy of recent years.

A CURIOUS WINDMILL.
In It* Construction Nature and Me
chanics Are Strangely and Ef
fectively Blended.
A windmill is apt to be a very
prosaic and ugly construction, but
many attempts have been made with
varying success to beautify these very
useful and economical power produc
ers. Our engraving - illustrates how
nature and mechanics are sometimes
blended. The trees serve only as a
support for the platform at the top,
and as side rails of a ladder, it being
necessary only to provide rounds.
The trees serve also to stay the iron
supports. The windmill, which was
;
A TREE WINDMILL.
built by J. G. Benster, of Moline, 111.,
is of peculiar construction, there be
ing no gear wheels nor crank, the
power being transmitted by an in
volute wheel which is a part of the
steel wheel to which the fans are at
tached. The surface of the involute
is perfectly smooth, as is also that of
the wheel attached to the pitman car
rier, the one rolling upon the other.
The mast is of tubing, the pitman
being carried down inside. The
wires for throwing the mill out of
gear are attached to a thimble on the
outside of the mast. From this it will
be seen that the trees are not needed
for actual support.
A number of these mills have been
attached to trees and have been giv
ing excellent results. It is also pos
sible to carry the mills around on a
wagon and set them to work at any
part of a field.—Scientific American.
RURAL DELIVERY.
How the System Has Materially Add
ed to the Cash Value of
Farm Lands.
The most recent provisions of the
rural delivery system make every wag
on a post office and a money order
office as well. Stamps are sold, money
orders are both issued and paid, and
letters are registered. The carriers
are allowed to deliver packages, other
than mail parcels, when such tasks do
not interfere with prompt service.
The farmers were at first inclined to
look at the plan as short lived. The re
ceptacles which they prepared for the
mail were, in thousands of instances,
of the crudest material that could be
found about the farms. Tomato cans,
stove pipes turned on end, cigar boxes
and tin pails all served for mail boxes,
and one farmer in Washington coun
ty, Pa., constructed a box by making
over an old hobby horse and mount
ing it upon a stake in front of his gate.
The carrier often discovered the box
nailed to the nearest fence, or attached
to a tree half-way between the road
and the family residence, instead of
being within easy reach of the mail
wagon.
It is estimated that the value of land
along rural delivery routes has in
creased from two to five dollars an
acre. Then, too, there is an educa
tional value in the rural free delivery,
in that thousands more magazines and
periodicals are finding their way to
people’s homes. The oldest route in
the United States runs out from Hope,
Ind. More carriers are now making
daily rounds wdthin the boundaries of
this state. If they went in a straight
line in relays they would cross the
continent every day. The total length
of the routes is 5,395 miles, and the
area covered is 8,014' square miles.
They serve 196,712 people who two
years ago were compelled to travel
from one to ten miles for their mail.

A straw ice house will do good serv

straw stack of many a farm may thus
be turned to good account. The
cheapest sort of a framework which

need not be tightly boarded up will
answer. The floor should be leveled
up and a drain consisting of a trench
partly filled in with stones dug to
carry oil; meltage water. Entrance
should be through a long passage
with several air locks to effectually
cut olf air currents. All surface wa

such a stack and hogs kept out or
they will burrow in and admit air to
the ice.—Theron L. Ililes, in Ohio

How to Keep Butter Sweet.
I believe the following is the best
method of keeping butter sweet:
Pack the butter in half-gallen jars as
soon after churning as it can possibly
be got into good condition. Exposure
to light and air injures the flavor and
keeping qualities of butter more than
many buttermakers are aware of. Tie j
a thick cloth over each jar and sink at I
once in a solution made after this !
formula: Make a strong brine with
all the salt the water will absorb. To
each gallon add a tablespoonful of
pulverized saltpeter, a tablespoonful
of pulverized borax, and a teacupful
of granulated sugar. Scald and skim
thoroughly, and strain through a
thick cloth. For home use probably s
sufficient number of larger jars cai
be found in which to store the buttei
jars. I never yet saw the wooden
package that left butter as sweet as il
found it.—Ohio Farmer.

Thrown from His Cab akl
Killed.
The following is a most interesting and, in
one respect, pathetic tale:—
Mr. J. Pope, 42 Ferrar Road, Streatham,
said:
“Yss, poor chap, he is gone, dead—horse
bolted, thrown off his seat on his cab he was
driving and killed—poor chap, and a good
sort, too, mate. It was him, you see, who
gave me the half-bottle of St. Jacobs Oil
that made anew man of me. ’Twas like
this: me and Bowman were great friends,
bom’? gentleman had given him a bottle of
St. Jacobs Oil which had done him a lot
of good; he only used half the bottle, and
remembering that I had been a martyr to
rheumatism and sciatica for years, that I
had literally tried everything, had doc
tors, and all without benefit, I became dis
couraged, and looked upon it that there was
no help for me. Well,” said Pope. “You
may not believe me, for it is a miracle, but
before I had used the contents of the half
bottle of St. Jacobs Oil which poor Bow
man gave me, I was a well man. There it is,
you see, after years of pain, after using rem
edies, oils, embrocations, horse liniments,
and spent money on doctors without get
ting any bettey, I was completely cured in
a few days. _ I bought another bottle, think
ing the pain might come back, but it did
not, so I gave the bottle away to a friend
who had a lame back. I can’t speak too
highly of this wonderful pain-killer.”

A CLERGYMAN’S DISCOVERY-
Fredericksburg, Ind., Dec. 2.—Ac
cording to the positive declaration of
Rev. E. P. Stevens, of this place, that
gentleman has found a remedy for all
diseases of the Kidneys and urinary
organs. For years he suffered severe
ly with these complaints, inconti
nence of the urine, making life a har
den to him, but he never ceased ex
perimenting in the hope that flome
day he would discover a remedy.
After many failures he has at last
succeeded and is to-day perfectly
cured and a well man, and explains
that his recovery is due to the use of
Dodd’s Kidney Pills. This remedy has
been successfully applied to many
cases of Lame Back, Rheumatism,
Bright’s Disease, Diabetes and other
Kidney Diseases, and there seems to
be no case of the kind that Dodd’s Kid
ney Pills will not care. This is the
only remedy' that faffs ever cured
