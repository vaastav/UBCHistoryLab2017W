Why does not the "Seafotd News"
acknowledge that years ago Sussex
county Orders under Dem>cr»ile uiai
agement were as dbaracefully discount
ed as now, and why does not the ''Union
Bepublican" acknowledge the existing
facts under Republican tule, just as
bad, and why do not they patriotically
join in an effort lo point out the way to
refo m in county afiaits? Why?
Two of the three Democratic titc
tion commission* re of Kentucky decid
ed the-Republican candidate for Gover
nor was elected by 2,383, and lie «as
Sworn in on Tuesday. All cred t to
those n en v. ho did their duty when
called uroa to set disgrace! ully pan

press which has patrically urged the

LET TRUTH PREVAIL.
Frederick Edsn B.tcb, who is con
nected with the Treasury Department
in Cuba, has written a letter to the
Sussex Republican iu Georgetown in
which he advocate s au alliance ot Un>
ion and Regular Republicans ou State
issues and an agreement between them
to let the United States Senalorehips
remain vacant in the event of Republi
can success.
Mr. Bach says much more but the
suggestion that no alliance be made
with Union Republicans to elect Ad
dicks to the Senate brings fro a the
diacreputable and irrespousibl "Suu"
of Wilmington tbe charge lhat Mr.
Addicks paid $5,500 to Mr. Bach for
his services at Dover last » inters to
aid Addicks' election. Note the fact
(1) The 'Sun" makes the accusation,
not Addicks, and that tho "Sun" is
not financially responsible, uor ye 1 has
it any creditable standing among news
pipers. The "Sun" says anything.
(2) What proof istheteos the charge?
—none.
(3) Why was it made? As an Inci
dent in the figb' before the Nalional
Committee now in »es- ion a' Washing
ton for recognition. As the Uuiou Re
publicans stand to day they have no
national association with any -Nstional
Party. They are a faction in Delaware
organized as an
As proclamied by Mo. AJdick» him
self, the sole puepose to elect Addicks
ty) the U. S. Sonate. They have so far
failed, through Democratic aid has been
inraked, an they will fail in the end.
Geo. James H. Wilson is Delaware's
Represeuative iu the National Com
mittee. He is being represented by bis
aon-io-Iaw-law^ Mr.IIeury R. Thomp
son, of Wilmington, a gentlemen iu
«very competens to look af er lt-publi
çan interests there.
The editor because of illness is uot
able to put Ins thoughts to tbe paper as
much as he desires (o do so, but he asks
for a suspension of Judgement as lo the
impecunious "Suu" changes against an
able Republican a« ay from borne they
always stab in tbe back and that the
truth shall and will prevail.

ed in tbs House to-day to c mtinue for
one we€k. Tbis bill vonl uot only re
ceive tbe vote of every Republican in
the House, but it will git from ten to
fifteen Democratic votes, making Us
passage by a large rr»jnily certain.
Never before has there been such un
animity iu favor of a financial measure.
Tbe reason may be found in tho fact
that this bill has tbe approval of the
business sentiment of the c uintry
So far, the democrats have shown
themselves to be afraid of the bill as a
whole, confining themselves Lo attack
ing it in spots. Tbey may work them
selves up into attacking it more direct-,
ly as the debate progresses. They will
ba given every opportune , and if they
wish more time than has been ailoted
to them, tbey can easily get it, as the
Republicans will be perteotiy willing to
give them a part of their time.

Gen. Léonard Wood will return lo

If be knows that bis nomination to be

step toward making bim Military Gov

One of the most important comuLt
tees of the present House, will be the
Insular Committee, which wifi have
charge of all legislalim pertaining to
the Island possessions of the U. S.,
the foimation of which has been au>
Iborized by the House. This Commit
tee will ba c imposed of t he ablest mem
bers of the House, and it will he a high
honor to be a meviber of It. Repre
sentative Tawney, of Minn., who was
the author of the resoluMou providing
for the Committee, will, it is thought,
be ils chairman.
Speaker Henderson purposes to stick
closely to business during the session
of Congress. He has declined an in
vitation to attend tile banquet, 0 f the
Middle Bex Club, of Boston, on April
27tb, next,—Grant's l irtlulay—and
says he will decline all similar invita»
(ions while Congères is in sassion.
The statement made by Roberts
that polygamists had been appointed
Postmasters in Utah, by the President
and confirmed by the Senate, was news
to the President, the Senate, aud the
Post Office Department, which irnmedi
ately began an investigation to ascer
tain the trutbiulness of the statement.
If there is a polygamist post-master in
Utah, or elsewhere, he will be dismiss
ed from office as soon as the proofs are
ia the bands of lite Department. The
House Committee that is investigating
the charges against Roberts is working
diligently. Its report is almost certain
to be against Roberts.
In order that there may be no
ground for a charge of partisan.-hip in
the action of the Senate Committee on
privileges and elections, on the cases
involving the seats of Senators Scott,
of \V. Va. Senator Clark, of Mont.,
and the right of Mr. Quay to be seated
on the appointment of Gov. Stone, of
Fa., that Committee is not included
among those upon Which Republican
representation wi 1 be iucreased to cor
respond with the Republican majority
in the Senate. That Senator Scott will
retain his seat, and that Mr. Quay-will
be seated, is regarded as reasonably
certain, and those who have looked
closely into the evidence to support the
charges against Senator Clark, ex
press the opinion that it is not strong
enough to unseat him.

studious at Dover.
Wednesday at 2 P. M. the Institute was

tendent of the schools of Kent County.
It is io he much iegretie.1 that more of
the Laciurs were not preseut, us Prof. Ttn
dal'a addiei-s, as usual, wus full of pratical
advice ami suggestion to the teachers.
Those who failed to hear him missed a rare
and iducational treat.
After which Rt. Rev, Leighton ColemaR i
Bishop ol the Diocess of Delaware, address
ed the Institute. For the last two or three
years Bishop Coleman has been present at
these annual gatherings of tue teachers and
as his remarks ate always so full of good
advice to the teachers, he is always received
with a warm hearty welcome.
On Wednesday Evening the Institute was
treated to a grand lecture on ''Democracy"
by Prof. Ruby R. Vale, Esq., of Philadel
phia, Pa.
Thursday morning the Institute was ad
dressed on the subject of Language by Miss.
L. A. Kirby, Asst. Supt. of the PuLlic
Schools of Philadelphia.
The interest manifested on the part of the
teachers present Bhowed that Miss Kirby
had struck the keynote on Language. Miss
Kirby is an educator in the fullest sense of
the word aud all who heard her were no
doubt able to carry away with them some
pratical thoughts on this very important
subject which they can utilize in their
school rooms.
This talk on Language wae followed by a
talk on Geogtaphy by Mrs, Mary Church
Terrell of Washington, D. C., member of
the Board of Education and President of
the National Association of Colored Wom
en. In the afternoon Miss Kirby again
addressed the Institute on the subject.
"Some Qualities in a Teacher that Win."
It is needless to say that this subject one in
which every teacher shonld give a thorough
study. This was followed by an address on
the life of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe by
Mrs. Mary Terrell, which was well received.
Thursday Evening, Dr. P. 0. Connell, of
Princess Aune Academy, Md., lectured to
the Institute. Dr. Connell's remarks were
heartily and enthusiastically cheered by the
audience. The musical part of the pro
gram consisted of solos, recitations and
quartetta.
Friday A. M. the Institute was addressed
on the Subject of History by Mrs Mary
Church Terrell- This paper showed a very
careful preparation and was attentively
listened to by the teachers. This was fol
lowed by a talk on "Reading-", by Miss Lil.
lian Wallace, Supervising, Principal of
Landreth's Public Schools, Philadelphia,
Pa, Miss Wallace's address, like that of
Miss Kirby's, was full of practical sugges
tions. In the afternoon at 2 o'clock, Miss
Wallace again addressed the Institute on
the subject of "Arithmetic".
Friday Evening the exercises were entire
ly of a musical character. Prof. Robert
Robinson of Philadelphia, presided at the
piano. Mrs. II. Agnes Warren, in her
sweet, charming and musical voice, brought
down the house with one of her favorite
solos, eutitled "Ring, Blue Balls, Ring."
As an encore she Sang, "Coming thro' the
Rye", with variations.
This was one of the most interesting and
instructive Institutes that nave ever been
held and; the Executive Committee is de
serving of much credit for the very excel
lent program.
All those who-visited the Institute dur
ing its sessions pay a high compliment to
; the creditable work done, much of it ex
iceltent, and the manager of the Opera
House says it was the moat orderly gather
i iug he bas had for r long, long time. In
i comptimen t to Mr. George H. Jones, teacher
of the Middletown school, and Chairman
of the Ex. Com. togetbei with the other
members or the committee the following
note is added: —.
''Your Institute was a magnificent suc

ulations for the efficient service you

Philadelphia, Monday, Dec. 11. lM. |
I/mked, we will store things
bought now until Christmas time ,
and deliver them.
[ Christmas-shopping made
easy.
Out-of-town people, have
you any idea how comfortable
it is to shop at Wanamaker's?
You leave your parcels and
wraps at the parcel-room, near
the door (Market and City
Hall Square), and then begin
ÿour looking just as comfort
ably as if we brought each
counter into your own home.
When you make your first
buy, ask for a transfer-slip,
have each purchase marked
on it, and when you have fin
ished buying, go to the trans
ifer-desk, give shipping direc
tions, and pay for all at once.
In the meantime, take lunch
In the basement or in the tea
room (third floor Chestnut
fetreet—by the way, the earlier
the comfortabler) and, if you
get tired, rest in the waiting
room on the first floor or the
basement, whichever is near
jww
est.
As for amusement, there's
plenty of it—with the cat
show, the bird-show, -the pic
tures, the toys, the furnished
rooms, the different stores full
of pretty things—books, fancy
rticles, jewelry, and all sorts
of small stuff in the middle of
the store, the bric-a-brac on
the second floor, and so. on.
Every part ofthe store thinks
it is a Christmas place just
now, and, if you think so too
—why so it is. There are
some good culinary souls
Who'd rather have a new kind
bf baking-tin for Christmas
than anything else—and why
not?
Ask anybody, who has his
hat 'off, where anything is.
There is nothing so good
natured as a crowd, and we
catch its good-nature easily.
It is our business to be good
natured, anyway—who has any
business to be anything else
when he's thinking of Christ
mas?
Perfumes
If it's for a woman, there
can't be any daintier Christ
mas box than a box of per
fumes. We have the boxes
in various pretty gift styles
containing generous sized bot
tles.
Violet and Lilac perfume«, three
