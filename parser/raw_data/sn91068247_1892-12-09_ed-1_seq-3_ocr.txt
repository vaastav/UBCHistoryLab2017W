Last Message.
The President's message was read to
both branches of Congress on Tuesday
last. At the opening the President says :
"In submitting my annual message to
Congress I have great satisfaction in
being able to say that the general condi
tions affecting the commercial and indus
trial interests of the United States are in
the greatest degree favorable. A com
parison of the most favored period in the
history of the country will, I believe,
show that so high a degroo of prosperity,
and so general a difference of the com
forts of life were never before enjoyed by
our people."
Mr. Harrison as he has repeatedly pro
claimed is a high protectionist, endors
ing tho McKinley bill with all that it im
plies, and continues to stand up for it
oven in its adversity, and defends his ad
ministration the best he knows how,
with the hope that it may strengthen him
with his party as a probable candidate
for 1896.
The message is lengthy, embracing
over fifteen thousand words.
Tho Atlanta Journal's Washington cor
respondent says : During its reading Mr.
Reed walked to the chair and asked :
"Mr. Speaker, when this is finished,
are you going to follow the usual cus
torn and adjourn in memory of the dear
departed."
Judge Turner, of Georgia : "He acts
like a lawyer who has a fair trial, loses
his case and then abuses the jury. He
concedes that the people's verdict is
against his policy. He argues that this
verdict was under the mo6t prosperous
conditions. The conclusion, therefore, is
that the people don't know what is good
for them."
Colonel Oates, of Alabama : "He seems
determined to go down with colors flying.
He is bluffing against the verdict of the
people."
Mr. Shivcly, of Indiana : "It is a splen
did exhibition of extreme federalism.
He insists that tho people must change
their views."
Mr. Brvan. of Nebraska : "He is like
tho school boy who whiningly says
If
I've done anything that I'm sorry lor I'm
glad of it."
The Richmond Dispatch thinks it is
plain that the President is retiring Irom
office in a melancholy mood. It is incom
prehensible to him why the people failed
to re elect him. Evidently he much fears
that his countrymen have made a grave
mistake. His spleen towards the solid
STuth is exhibited by his unnecessary
reference three or four times to the
"rebels" and "rebellion" ; by his anxiety
to have some sort of Federal election law
passed, and by his demand for a public
sentiment which shall put a stop to
ly nchings."
We publish elsewhere the correspon
dence between the committee of the Alli
ance and tho Progressive Farmer. As
will be seen, the Farmer gets down on
its knees and says it "won't do so any
more." We take these expressions of
Eenitence with a great deal of allowance,
ark this prediction : During the next
campaign, if the Progressive Farmer and
its party live so long, it will be as rank a
Third party sheet as it has been in the
campaign just ended. Concord Times.
We do not know the limit of "for the
present, but the Progressive farmer
says : "Now the election is over. Let
political discussion stop for the present."
We do not think a newspaper that has
expressed such bitter hatred for the
Democratic party, one month before the
election, can be sincere one month after
in its "won't do so any more." it's a case
of "Will you walk into my parlor said the
spider to tho fly."
Let the Farmer's Alliance nave an
organ that represents and can advocate
tho principles of the order with a clean

Jay Gould died at bis residence in
New York City on Friday, December
2nd. Pulmonary consumption was the
disease which killed him. A sketch of
his life shows he took advantage of all
opportunities, which enabled him to
amass a fortune of one hundred million of
dollars, but in some respects his career is
not t0 De emulated.
He was born in 1836, at Strattan Falls,
Delaware county, New York. His father
was a farmer, and also ran a grocery
store, very naturally Jay spent his
early days on the farm and behind the
counter. His educatiou was limited and
he did not have much of a start in life,
"but got there just the same." At six
teen be was clerk in a fancy goods store
of Squire Burnham, near Strattan Falls.
The shrewdness ot Jay Gould developed
early. He heard his employers speak of
buying a small tract or land near Albany.
Jay got there first, bought the land and
closed out a profit. He invented a mouse
trap and sold the patent. When he was
eighteen years old he surveyed Delaware
county, and made a map which is still in
use. After the survey he went into
partnership with a man who owned
tannery, in Pennsylvania, and during the
next three years he made money and got
a good start. He early developed a habit
of buying out his partners. He bought
out his partner in the tannery but soon
sold it, and went to New York to live,
His life since then has been spent in Wall
street, with which his namo has become
inseparably connected.
Gould's policy has always been to buy
up two or three badly paying nulroads
i . i
consolidate inem unaer a new name
issue bonds at a good price and sell out
at a profit. When the buyers found that
they were unable to operate the road at
a profit Gould would buy it back at a
much lower figure. Gould's wealth is
estimated at from $100,000,000 to $150,
000,000.
The story is told that once Jay Gould
was in Europe, and sent his card to Baron
Kothschud. The baron sent back word
"Europe is not for sale."

FROM OUR RALEIGH CORRESPONDENT.
Raleigh, N. C , Dec. 6, 1892.
This is a busy week so far as the vari
ous State officials are concerned, as they
are making up their reports. Gov. Holt
has done some work on his message. It
will be a good document. That may be
depended. Your correspondent would
have greatly liked to see Gov. Holt give
his State four years more of his services
in the executive office. Whatever he has
done has been well done. It is not in the
least flattery to say that, and the State
is really his debtor. That cannot be said
of all public officials.
The State's bonded debt is at this date
$3,281,686.25. The legislative joint com
mittee appointed to inspect the books and
vouchers of the treasury and of the audi
tor's department meets next week.
It is intimated by one of the holders of
stock in the State Alliance business
agency fund that he intends having a
complete investigation made of the affairs
and the finances thereof.
The number of pupils at the two insti
tutions for the deaf mutes and blind
(white and colored) is now 215, of whom
70 are colored.
The legislature will be asked to appro
priate $60,000 for the completion of the
school for deaf mutes at Morganton. It
is figured that the amount named will
complete it.
The strength ot the State Guard bas in
the fiscal year increased 25 per cent, or
400, bringing it up to 2,000. There is a
good deal of interest in regard to the
next Adjutant-General. The elections of
field officers last week resulted in a good
many changes. Two of the oldest offi
cers in the service retired, these being
Cols. Jones of the Second and Anthony
of the Fourth regiment. The troops do
not get enough drill and practice in ac
tual work. But it costs money to get
these things done.
ihe btato geological board met last
week and heard a very complete report
made by State geologist J. A. Holmes.
1 his covered two years operations and
hows that the State has secured a great
deal of work in return for its investment
of $10,000 a year for the survey. Prof.
Holmes says that the expenditure of
more money will prove judicious. Maybe
the legislature will take that step. The
government survey goes along step by
step with ihe State one. North Caro
ina has luck once in a while and this is
certainly one of the cases.
Ihe survey is under various heads, or
subjects. These have been taken and
followed with much system. Take the
iron ores, fur instance. In no less than
fifty counties explorations and analyses of
these ores have been made. Much new
nformation is thus gained. Capitalists
are watching with interest all theso de
velopments. The collection of exhibits for tho
World's Fair has gone on systematically
with the survey. Prof. Holmes says
many superb specimens are ready to go
to Chicago. Now that the funds are in
hand, tor use by the World s Y&Cr board,
everything progresses. Mr. T. K. Bruner
and State chemist H. B. Battle have
spent a week at Chicago, making final
arrangements for the space for the exhi
bits and also tor the cases, stands, etc., on
which the exhibits will be made. This is
called the "installation." It is expensive,
costing some $10,000, since all the fittings,
etc., in the exhibition buildings must be
of the best materials and designs. Efforts
are being made to get more space for
North Carolina.
The Baptist State convention meets
here Thursday. It will have 400 dele
gates, and a great many visitors. Its gain
n membership during the year will ap
proximate 12,000, the officers state. It
embraces in its territory all the counties
east of the Blue Ridge and three west of
it. in this territory are 42 associations,
with 1,700 churcheR, of which 47 were
organized during the year. Rev. Dr. R.
H. Marsh is the president ot the conven
tion and will in all probability be re
elected. Tho number of convicts is now 1,130.
This is a smaller number than in a good
many years past. In the penitentiary it
self there are only about 100. The nam
ber on the great btate iarms on the .Koan-
oke is steadily increasing. These farms
have done exceedingly well in tho way
ot crops, it is. ot course, tarmmg on a
vast scale, and with 900 trained laborers
In many respects the experiment is of
peculiar interest, The convicts in this
work do not come in the least in conflict
with free labor. This problem is solved
as is the other one of making the peni
tentiary self supporting.
The courts will have to pass upon two
cases of vital importance to the public
schools. One is whether the constitution
must not be obeyed and the public
schools kept open four months in the
year, even it it does cost over the lawiui
boj cents on the $1UU ot property and the
$2 on the poll. The other quostion is as
to the constitutionality or the present
mode of disbursing the school taxes
which are expended in the counties in
which they are raised, irom somethings
your correspondent has heard it appears
that the present method is not constitu
tional and that the school tax ought to
go into the State treasury and thence be
paid out, per capita, among the school
population. However, that is for the
courts to decide.
Next week the Supreme court will
complete the call of appeals. It is now
at work on those from the eleventh dis
trict. Nearly all the dockets are lighter
than usual. In the past six or eight
years litigation, certainly in this court,
bas very greatly decreased. This term
all cases are disposed of : there being
no cases put at the end of the docket.
Tho public schools have during the
year just closed done better work than
ever before. Mai. Finger tells me. lhat
excellent officer is justly proud of the
great improvement of the schools under
his administration of their affairs. The
teaching is better, and so are the teach
ers. More money is the one thing now
needed. The public school system, the
backbone of North Carolina, is at last
strong.
Several North Carolina Congressmen
have been here. They say they do not
favor an extra session of Congress in
March, later in the year they do not
oppose a session. They desire no hasty
work.
The State returning board bas been in
session several days. It canvassed the
fifth Congressional district returns and
gave the certificate to Settle, the Repub
lican nominee. This result was not un
expected, nor does it create any dissatis
faction. Settle's plurality was 329, his
vote being 14,075; that for Williams,
Democrat, 13,746; that for Lindsey,
populist, 4,358, while Love, the prohibi
tion nominee got only 424.
The canvass ot the electoral vote
showed that Cleveland received 132,951,
narrison 100,346, Weaver 44,752, Bid-
well 2,636. The total vote cast was only
280,685. It is very strange that it was
so light. Chairman Simmons expected
it to be at least 305,000. Tho prohibi
tionists made a beggarly showing. Their
chairman told mo a month ago that they
would poll ten thousand voles a. I least.
Your correspondent said "Cut down
your figures and make them a fourth as
large." it was a close guess.
In the Federal circuit court here to
morrow there will be tried the first mur
der case ever tried in it. The defendant
is Zach Rhodes, a deputy U. S. " marshal,
who killed a moonshiner named Edwards,
in Duplin county.
Lee b. Overman, ol ICowan, appears to
have very slight opposition for the speak
ership of the next house.
Ihe Democrats ot Johnston county,
which gave Cleveland 2,200 majority,
make formal claim to the Democratic
banner.

The Extension of Southern Trade.
The fact that American cotton man
ufacturcrs have, during the past season,
found a ready salo in foreign markets.
particularly in China and Brazil, holds
out the hope that within a few more
years our cotton goods will compete
actively with Enghsj and other Euro
pean manufacturers in supplying, not
only the demands of the eastern coun
tries, but the trade ot the bouth Ameri
can States, which have hitherto drawn
the great bulk of their cloths of all
makes from Europe.
The extension ot the demand for
American made cloth must necessarily
benefit the southern growers of raw cot
ton, because it will increase the domestic
demand for raw material. In addition to
this, however, it is probable that the
southern mills will reap a share of the
extension of the foreign demand for cot
ton manufactures. Being near the fields,
and with facilities for securing raw
material at a minimum of cost, southern
mills will be in a position to compete on
the very best terms with all competitiors
in foreign markets.
Mexico bas recently reduced her duties
on cotton goods 20 per cent, while the
reciprocity treaties afford American cot
tons every advantage in a number of
Central and South American markets.
Southern mills ought to supply the great
bulk ol this demand, at least lor the plainer
makeB, and as soon as the manufacture of
the higher grades is attempted with such
grades also. Eventually transportation
across the Isthmus of Panama will be
secured either by canal or ample rail
connections. Such facilities would give
southern mills a great advantage not
only in South American trade, but in that
with Uhtna'and the EaBt as well, as boutrj-
ern ports would then be brought many
thousand mile nearer to such portions ot
the world than is now the case. JSevo

JW The State canvassing board de
cided that Mr. Thomas Settle was duly
elected to the Fifty third Congress from
the fifth Congressional district at the late
election. Tbo contest hinged upon the
vote of Stokes county. The contestant,
Mr. A. H. A. Williams, contended that
the canvassing board of Stokes county
was intimidated by the threats of armed
men. political friends of Mr. Settle, who
were present when the votes were Deing
canvassed, and that these threats pre
vented the board from fully passing upon
them. This was denied by Mr. Settle,
who maintained that the board was not
deterred from performing its duty accord
ing to law, and that the returns showed
he was elected. The btate canvassing
board, by a vote of 3 to 2, decided in
favor of Mr. Settles contention and
awarded him the certificate of election.

A large seaport may grow up
from commerce and shipping, but no in
land town can grow and prosper with
out manufacturing. There must be
something to employ labor. Manufac
turing not only furnishes employment
for labor, bat continually brines money
from elsewhere to add to the capital of
the place. The farmer markets his crop
and the money which it brings is
sDent with the merchant and sent off
again. The manufacturer ships the pro
duct of his factory and the money is paid
for salaries, labor and raw material and a
large portion of it remains at home and
gradually the community grows rich.
We have known towns boomed up and
for awhile everything looks rosy, but tail
ing to establish manufacturing, in every
case the last end of that town was worse
than the first. Warrenion Record.

JNo better preparation for the hair bas ever
been invented than Ayer's Hair Vigor. It re

Anson has a Kaolin Mine. Anson
county brown stone has achieved a
reputation all over the country as being a
stone ot the very best quality, and now
it is probable that in the near future
Anson county kaolin will be used in the
manufacture of the hnest crockery and
china. On the plantation of Mr. Shep
herd Edwards, two miles from Folkton,
this mineral is found in exhaustable
quantities and it is believed that the

found. A hill, containing at least ten
acres, to a great depth, is composed of the
