WAsiiiiniTot, Pie. 1!). Tho speaker an
iioumvd the committee on rules us follows:
Messrs. llamlnll, Mills, Reed mid Cannon.
Mr. Dibble, of Kouth Carolina, offered
n'solution referring to th committee on np
proprlatiom tho reports of tho court
claim, on the French Kiti:itun claims, with
Instructions to that committee to report all
claims which have been decided fuvorubly to
the claimants in the general dellcicncy bill
Mr. mount, of Georgia, objected to ill
stri'.c'lu;; a committed to rcHrt back claims
winch would involve millions of dollars, bo.
fore the resolution containing such Instruc
tions had been considered by a committee.
Mr. Randall coincided In this view, and
liiKgrMed that tho resolution be referred to
the committee on claims.
Mr. Pihhlerald that the amount Involved
in the ejmliation claims was variously csii
liiaU'd at from H,(mi,ik) t f:),usl,no(i. Ac
cording to Ihe best estimate he could make,
the amount Involved was about $10.11,000,
., . . a. .
1 ur ainoimi involved 111 ma resolution was
only $4IH,iiSH Hut if the government owed
the claimants the inonev, as had been de
cidi-d by the court of claima, the question of
amount was of secondary importance.
Mr. Jtlount could see no i-ciinoii w hy theso
claims hould be placed in any more favor
able KKition than any other claims, since
the act referring the filiation claim, to the
court nl claims expressly declared that Ihe
rcrt of the isiurl should Hot be considered
111 the riglil ol a judgment, but merely as ad
visory to Congress.
Mr. Pibhle denied that there was anything
in the resolution to commit the House to
favorable action in the matter of these
chums.
Mr. Reed, of Maine, suiiikirled theresolii
timi. Congress bad referred the claims to a
court for judicial ascertainment, and the
court had decided In certain raws ihe I'nited
Mules was liable. It sccim-d to him that after
having kept the claimants waiting for nearly
eighty years, Congi-i. ought How to liikke
no more dilatory opniiiion to the claims,
but might to come t"iian ly up to tho yes or
110 nnser.
