Home, Dec.
13—
Great excitement pre­
vails at the Vatican because, of the ac
tual situation in France and news from
France is eagerly awaited. The pope
received Cardinal Vincent Vanutelli
mid during the course of the conver
sation saul the Vatican declined re
sponsibility for what might happen in
France.
It is believed here that the coming
conflicts may prove more serious than
those which occurred at the time of the
taking ot the iriventories and it is sug
gested that if worship is held privately
the faithful may have to be supplied
with tickets to attend mass and other
religious ceremonies.
Expulsion Causes Consternation.
The exzpulsion by France of Mgr.
Montagini, secretary of the papal nun
ciature at Paris, who has represented
the Vatican at the French capital since
the recall of the nuncio, has caused not
only astonishment, but consternation

at the Vatican. Jie .was arrested and
his house searched, after which he was
escorted to the frontier by the police.
According to Vatican officers this step
Is an evident proof that the French
government wishes not only to strike
at the church as a religious institution,
tout to represent it as an enemy of the
republic and allied with the republic's
foes.
Furthermore the officials character
ized this step as taken in a spirit of
meanness, as the French government
knows the Vatican cannot, because of
Its position, Indulge in similar action
as a reprisal with the individual who
Is looking after French interest at
Rome.
Historic Day For France.
This is an historic day for France.
The struggle which began in 1S30 with
the banishment of the Jesuits, ended
today with the legal rupture of the
bond which for practically 1,000 unin
terrupted years had united church and
state.
By refusing to make the required
declarations under the public meeting
law7 1SS1, public Catholic worship,
except by schismistic organizations, to
morrow becomes illegal.
The scenes in some of the churches
today were extremely touching. Not
in years has there been such an at
tedance at mass. The number of wom
en w-as especially large and was note
worthy as indicating the religious in
difference of the male population. Al
though seven-eighths of the inhabitants
of this city are nominally Catholics, in
no parts of the city were the churches
crowded.
The officiating clergy read the regu
lar offices for the week as usual, with
out referring to their illegal status to
.. morrow.
Depression Manifest.
Nevertheless the depression of the
Catholics were manifest. Many women
emerged from the cathedral, their eyes
streaming with tears and lingered on
the pavement to discuss what to do
•when the clergy shall be turned out of
their churches.
But, on the eve of the struggle, it is
becoming more apparent that both
government officials and higher eccles
iastics are resisting the advice of the
intemperate minister of public worship,
Briand, who announces that "the gov
ernment cannot bo driven into the trap
of closing the churches." and Cardi
nal Richard, archbisnup of Paris, has
strongly censured the placarding ap
peals of the clericals to make violent
resistance to the law officers.
War Minister Picquart ordered the
recruiting officers to require the eccles
iastical students to present their cer
tificates tomorrow'. Those who fail to
do so by December 20 will be ordered
to join the colors January 7. The or
der affects 5,500 students.
Leaving the Rectories.
Cardinal Richard says:
VNo violence, but passive resistance
to an unjust law, after exhausting all
protests at every step."
This is the disposition so far as high
er ecclesiastics are concerned, but their
followers.evidently have no intention to
submit and are preparing to assume
GRIMES PAYS KANSAS,
INCIDENT IS CLOSED
Topeka, Kas.. Dec. 1".—P. E. Grimes,
ex-state treasurer, today voluntarily
paid to Kansas 59.3S1 for which tho
Investigation committee some time ago
held his administration responsible.
The alleged shortage was never'con
steered in the light cf a defalcation and

for years.. The investigation showed

the role or iViartyrs, abandon the,
churches and organize private worship.
Cardinal Richard and many bishops
have already begun the removal of
their private effects from the episcopal
mansions, and the clergy is preparing
to leave its rectories and move into
hired lodgings.
It Is announced that these parish
priests have received many offers of
places in which to hold religious ser
vices. but there is not the slightest in
dication they intend to take advantage
of the sole remaining chance to retain,
their churches, namely by making the
declarations called for by the new!
law.
The government continues to present,'
a calm front, although the ministers!
realize that additional legislative pow
er will be necessary if serious troublej
shall occur.
Cardinal Gets Notice.
Formal notice was served today on
Cardinal Richard and the bishops and
parish priests that they must evacuate:
their residences tomorrow. On the hope
of affecting a compromise several depu
ties telegraphed to the mayor's com
munes asking them to induce two Catli-1
olic laymen from each parish to make'
a declaration under the law of 1SS1,
which the pope has forbidden parish
priests to make.
The tone of the republican press of
all shades indicates that if the pope
imagines that an uncompromising at
titude will compel the French govern
ment to open negotiations with the
Vatican he has woefully mistaken the,
temper of the people. Republique
Francaise says:
"The time has passed when the pope'
could successfully threaten to release
French subjects from their allegiance.
Defiance of law will only expose the
pviests to being regarded as subjects,
of a foreign power by which they would
forfeit their rights as Frenchmen."
Merry Del' Val Barred.
Immense quantities of documents*
were found at the nunciature and taken
to police headquarters.
The courier from the papal secretary,
of state, Cardinal Merry del' Val, bear-,
ing dispatches from Rome, was turned
back at the frontier today.
Among other measures the cabinety
proposes to introduce in parliament is
a bill authorizing the government to
expel ecclesiastics whose presence is|
considered dangerous to public peace.

TRIAL MARRIAGES HELD
SOCIAL PURITY FOE
Chicngo, Dec. 13.—Trial marriage was'

Congregational church.
"Marriage," he said, "is the human
relationship that forms the nucleus
around which gathers the home. Any
theory or suggestion that strikes a
blow at its permanency stabs to the
very heart tiie mother of all that is
dearest and purest and truest in our
present day civilization.

she received Isaac's proposal was to
run and tell her mother. The modern
Rebecca runs off and gets married and
then telegraphs back that she and

•Roosevelt, in Special Message
Tells Congress Justice De.
mands Privilege.
Washington. P. C., Doc. 13.—Congress
today received from President Roose
velt his special message on Porto Rico,
of which the following is part:
"I doubt whether our people as a
whole realize the beauty and fertility
of Porto Rico, and the progress that
has been made under its admirable
government. We have jus.' cause for
pride in the character of our represen
tatives who have administered the
tropic Islands whieii came under our
flag as a result of the war with Spain
and of no one of them is this more true
than of Porto Rico. It would be impos
sible to wish a more faithful, a more
efficient and a more disinterested pub
lic service than that now bi'ing ren
dered in the island of Porto Rico by
those in control of the insular govern
ment.
Glad to Be Under Flag.
"There is a matter to which 1 wish to
call your special attention, and that is
the desirability of conferring full Amer
ican citizenship upon the people of
Porto Rico. 1 most earnestly hope that
this will be done. 1 can not see how
any harm can possibly result from it,
and it seems to he a matter of right
and justice to the people of Porto Rico.
They are loyal, and they are glad to
be under our Hag, they are making
rapid progress along the path, of order
ly liberty. Surely we should show our
appreciation of them, our pride in what
they have done, and our pleasure in ex
tending recognition for what has thus
been done, by granting them full Amer..
ican citizenship.
PLURAL MARRIAGES IN
DARKENED ROOMS IS
UTAH CHARGE.
Senator Burrows Calls Up Res«
olution to Have Reed
Smoot Expelled.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 13.—At the
conclusion of the morning's business in
the senate today Senator Burrows,
chairman of the committee on privil
eges, called up the resolution declaring
that Reed Smoot is not entitled to his
seat as senator from Utah.
Mr. Burrows said there had been no
proof submitted to sustain the allega
tion that Smoot is a polygamiEt, adding
that the recommendation of the com
mittee on privileges and elections in
favor of declaring vacant the seat of
,the Utah senator is not based on such
,a charge.
He said the impeachment is based en
tirely upon the connection of Smoot
with the governing body of the Mormon
•church. He referred to this body as
a hierarchy and said -it has practically
every political position in the Utah gov
ernment.-
He said Smoot's membership in the
•church governing body which incul
cates a belief in polygamy is conceded
•that proof is positive that in spite of
the manifesto of 1S90, issued by the
head of the church, counseling suspen
sion of polygamy, a majority of the
members of the hierarchy are today
openly and confessedly defying the
laws of the land prohibiting such
crimes.
The record was declared so shocking
as to challenge credulity.
Burrows said:
"It is shown by the testimony that a
majority of the apostles are living in
a polygamous cohabitation, including
President Smith. Plural marriages are
performed in secret in darkened rooms
on highways remote from habitation."
Burrows concluded by saying:
"I submit that the organization that
fosters and encourages crime prac
tices polygamy and polygamous co
habitation desecrates home under
mines and shakes the foundation of
human society and government and de
fies the authority of state and national
government is not entitled to have its
representative in the senate of the
United States, and I therefore ask the
adoption of the resolution."
Nominations Sent to Senate.
Washington, D. C., Dec. l.v—The
president today sent the following
nominations to the senate:
Captain on active list to rear ad

Government Halts Operations
on Gigantic Project at Belle
Fourche, S. D.
RECOMMENCE: IN AFRIL
Valuable Discoveries by Geological
Survey of Water Underlying',.,
the Entire Black Hills
District.
Washington. Dec. 11.—The geological
survey reclamation service announces
that owing to the cold wi-att'cr work
on tin.' dam embankment. Belle Fourche
irrigation project, South Dakota, has
been discontinued and probably will
not be taken up again before April.
The total progress on this embankment
to date is 219.000 cubic yards. The
closing down of work on the dam made
•available a large force ot" nu for oth
er work. The men employed by differ
ent contractors, as well as those under
ithe direct supervision of the govern
ment engineers, have been placed on
canal excavation, finishing structures,
etc., as soon as unfavorable weather
'made concrete and embankment work
impossible.
In many respects this is one of the
most remarkable irrigation projects yet
undertaken by the government. It in
volves the construction if one of the
greatest earth dams in the world, a
structure over one mile long. 3 00 feet
'high in the highest place and 20 leet
wide on top. its cubical contents will
be nearly half those of the pyramid of
Cheops, which is estimated to have
occupied 900 years in construction.
The Belle Fourche dam will be com
pleted in less than one year. This
dam will create a reservoir CO feet deep
with a water surface of about 9,000
acres when full.
Creste More I han 1.G00 Farms.
More than 1.000 new farms will be
created by this project in a valley
where the principal product has been
low grade range cattle, and the value
of lands which now range from $5 to
$10 per acre will be increased to $75
,and upwards.
With the rapid increase in settlement
in western South Dakota, especially in
connection with the Belle Fourche
reclamation project, the question of lo
cal water supply has taken on much
interest. The surface waters in many
portions of the area are not satisfac
tory in quality or quantity, so that the
deeper seated and artesian waters will
have to be extensively utilized. The
United States geological survey lias
been in vestigating these underground
waters for several years, and a report
now in preparation by -Mr. N. H. Dar
ton will set forth the results.
Water Under Entire Black Hills.
It has been found that the entire plains
region adjoining the Black I!Ills is under
lain by Dakota sandstone carrying a largo
volume of water under considerable pres
sure. This water lies at depths of 5C0 t"
2,000 feet, or even more, and in many dis
tricts, especially along the valleys, will
afford large artesian Hows. The investi
gations have been carried on with the'
view of ascertaining the precise depth to
the waterbearing sandstone, at all points
and the limits of the area in which an nr
.tesian tlow is available. Thi.i area hr.s
been found to be much more extensive
than was originally supposed, and artesian
•waters may be obtained at many localities
where local supplies are greatly needed.
Some preliminary predictions that the wa
ter would be obtained in the larger val
leys east of the Black Hills have been
abundantly verified by the success of a
number of wells along the line of the new
railway from Pierre to Rapid City, in a re
gion where the surface waters are mostly
•of an unsatisfactory quality.
The report on the underground waters
of the northern Black Mills region will lie
completed in a few weeks, but several
months will be required for the engraving
ot the maps with which it is to be illus
trated.

AFTER BACKING HIS
THEATRICAL WORK
New York, Dec. 12.—Mrs. C. C. At
tvood, a dashing young widow in a pic
ture hat, used a silver handled riding
whip on Kugene B. Sanger, a theatrical
agent, in front of his office in the,
Knickerbocker Theater building, on
Broadway. She was welting him at a
lively clip when Policeman John Brady
interfered.
The widow was mad clear through,
and Sanger was so uncertain as to
what to do that Policeman Brady
thought the best way to settle the diffi
culty was to have a police magistrate
hear both sides. An hour later Mrs.
Atwood was at the bridge of Jefferson
Market police court. Then it developed,
according to the story told Magistrate
Mayo, that she was an angel—a theat
rical angel.
"I gave Sanger and his partner, Rich
ftrd Pittman, $3,000—every cent I had
in the world—to back their theatrical
agency," said tiie widow emotionally.
"That was about a year ago, soon aft
er I came here from Mexico Cily. I
pawned all my jewels to raise the
money and Pittman went with me
vvhcn I negotiated the loan. 1 was
cheated out of the money, and that is
all there is to it."
FREES HER CUB BY
OFF LE6
Chambord Junction, 1'. Q., Dec. 12.—
Henry Tate, a trapper, got track of a
silver gray fox, ant) used his utmost
skill to catch the valuable animal. He
I set several traps, and was sure that
the fox sprung one of them. Thinking
that the steel jaws were not heavy
enough to hold so clever a prisoner, lio
.finally set a wolf trap near an old log,
,anil then baited it with a live chicken.
For three days he fed the chicken
without even getting sight of the fox,
but on the fourth he heard sounds as
he neared the spot. The sounds were
evidently made by two animals, but
not foxes and he approached cautious
ly. Peering through the bushes he saw
an old bay lynx and an S-months-old
cub directly over the trap. The young
one was crying out with pain, while the.
uld one now and then snarled and
grunted.
Tate thought that he had both ani
mals in the trap, but he soon saw he
•was mistaken, for the old lynx jumped
away a few feet, sniffed for danger
signs and then returned to her off
spring, which had been securely nipped'
by a foreleg. She seemed to be ex
ceedingly busy, and the trapper, al-.
ways on the lookout for some new
I phase of animal life, determined to
fathom the mystery before he shot the
animals.
Working around to a better point of
vantage, lie observed that the mother
Jynx was liberating the cub by cutting'
off its leg with her sharp teeth. As she
gnawed the cub squealed, but the par
ent paid little attention to his outcries.
Evidently he hadn't the nerve to do
the job himself, so she had taken mat
ters into her own hands. She worked
carefully but with determination, and
at the end of a few minutes the lynx,
was free.

A Peace Commission.

cpient speech thanked parliament
the president name and read the fol
lowing message from the president: "1
am profoundly gratified ami touched by
the signal honor shown me through1*
your body In conferring on me the
Nobel peace prize. There is no gift
I could appreciate more and WISH it
•were in my power to fully express my
gratitude, I thank you for it, thank you
in behalf of the United States for what'
I did 1 was able to accomplish only as a
representative of the nation ot: which
for time being I am president. After
much thought I have concluded that
the best and most fitting way to apply
the amount of the
prize
is
by
using it,
as a fund to establish at. Washington a
permanent industrial peace committee.
The object will be to strive for better
and more equitable relations among
ly countrymtn who are engaged
whether as capitalists or wage work
ers in industrial and agricultural pill--'
suits. This will carry out the purpose
of its found'-r.
MOVE BOOSTED BY
I. CORTELYQU
"'ostal Chief Declares Efficient1
Postmasters Ought to
Be Reappointed.
Washington, P. C., Dee. 12.—Post
master General Cortelyou in his annual
report gives the good roads move a.
boost in tills language:
"In co-operation with the department
of agriculture, systematic efforts have
been made during the year to secure!
the improvements of the roads trav
ersed by rural carriers. Koail oliieials
in the states of Illinois, Iowa., Maine.:
Minnesota, Missouri, New .Jersey, New
"York and Wisconsin have asked for
and by instruction of this department
have obtained information from rural
carriers as to tho condition of the,
roads, bridges and culverts upon rural
routes, of what materials the roads are
composed, how frequently and in what
manner they are worked, and what
road building materials are available'
in each vicinity. Postmasters, of rural
delivery ollices in. the states named,
have been requested by the department
to aid the state anil ioea.l oliieials in'
all efforts to secure the betterment of
the highways on which rural routes,
are maintained.
Mr. Cortelyou also says:
"The receipts of the year were $167,
032,782.95 the expenditures, ?17S,'M'J.
778.89 excess of expenditures over re
ceipts, $10,516,99i.94."
Favors Reappointments.
A considerable number of postmast
ers failed of reappointment because the
records showed that they had not given,
sufficient, personal attention to their of
fices. The department's policy of rec
ommending the reappointment of effi
cient postmasters has unquestionably
brought about a considerable improve
ment in the service. It is a further in
centive for postmasters to become pro-,
ficient in the management of tln-ir of
fices and to see that the mail service,
for which they are responsible is con-
ducted in the best possible manner.
