all agreements provide for payment in sixty days.
The Vnlon Pacific's supplies are marked with the
company's name, which does not cost extra. The
company now has three hundred agreements, and
under them buys annually about $50,000,000 of sup

"We never find it advisable to advertise, because
■we do not want to let the middlemen, who are not

Mr. Thorn*. "The system of advertising for com

compulsory award to the lowest bidder, has broken
down- I see no value to it. but a great deal of
unnecessary waste and expense."
ACCUSES FORMER FIASCE.
Widow, Held for Larceny, Says Be
quest Was Withheld from Her.
A well dressed woman who, wh«n arrester! at a
Broadway department store on Monday, refused
to give her name, was shown to be Mrs. Anna F.
Egan. a widow, last night In the Night Court.
She has been a prisoner at the Jefferson Market
prison since Monday night under a charge of petit
larceny of merchandise valued at $7 10 from the
department stor«. The police say Ehe admitted
the theft, saving that the world owed her a living.
The woman told Magistrate Walsh that Richard
K. Berminßham, of the bureau of highways, had
been the executor of her husband's estate and had
failed to make proper return of the money in
trusted to him. Magistrate "Walsh adjourned the
case to investigate her story, and last night ha 3
Berminghain In court. Bermingham said be was
the executor of the estate of the woman's hus
band, Thomas Jerome Ejran, who died in 1597, but
said he left only $1,500 insurance, and this, he said.
was left In trust for Ega-n's three children. Since
that time, he declared, he had given Mrs. Egan
between $1,600 and J1.700. Mrs. Egan said he had
given her only JSSO. She said then that in the
same year an aunt. Mrs. Annie Hoey, died and
left her $10,000. She at first said that Bermingham
had been responsible fcr the disappearance of a
part of that, but later admitted that none of that
money had passed through his hands.
Bermingham said he had been engaged to marry
Mrs. Egan, but that Ehe had written scandalous
letters to various persons about him and his chil
dren, and he therefore broke the engagement.
Mrs. Egan wed her husband's will, which
showed that it had never been offered for probate.
Berminsham said he had been advised by a
lawyer not to offer the will for probate, as the
amount was small, and thus save the expense. A
man who said his name was McGrath, and a cousin
of Mrs. Egan, told the Magistrate that she had
fallen a year ago. Since then, be said, she has
been acting strangely at times.
Magistrate Walsh reserved decision until Tuesday
night so that an examination could be made of
records as to the mortgage on the house at No.
664 East 136 th street, said to have been purchased
by Mr?. Egan. In the mean time Mrs. Egan is
under $300 bail.
HALF A BILLIOX MOVED.
National City Bank Transfers Its
Wealth to New Quarters.
Under the watchful eyes of a squad cf police, pri
vate detective* and armed guards, who formed a
double cordon across the street, the employes of
the National City Bank Barely and without inci
dent transferred yesterday more than $35,000,000 in
gold, silver and bills and between Moß.lsa,osl and
J500,900,000 in securities from the strongboxes in the
old building at No. 52 Wall strePt. to the huge
aiTr.Gr plata steel vault in the remodelled Custom
House across the street, which will be the home o?
the bank In the future.
The transfer of the cash a:;.: securities began
immediately after the bank closed for business, at
no* a, and was not complete.! until about 4 o'clock
in the afternoon. There was no stopping of traffic
during the transfer, but the police kept a sharp
eye en every one ■who passed and did not permit
any persons to loiter in front of the entrances to
the buildings. Tiie moving was done by the four
hundred clerks and other employes of the bank,
who worked in squads. As each equad left the old
building, carrying a. strongbox ailed with specie or
securities, it was surrounded by private detectives,
who marched with it across the intervening space
to the new building through a double row of police
and armed guards.
The transfer by President J. Lawrence Marcellua
of J-2.000.uu0 from the old to tho new building of the
Dime Savings Bank, at DeKaib avenue and Fleet
street, Brooklyn, yesterday, was also without inci
dent. The bank's business will be carried on ** the
new building for the first time to-morrow. It is
one o^ the oldest and most prosperous of the city's
financial institutions.

Man Killed During Storm, Buried at
Sea from the Scharnhorst.
The White Star^liner Teutonic and the steamer
Seharnhorst, of the North German LJoyd Linp,
both storm tossed throughout their entire passag-e
across the Atlantic, arrived here yesterday with
no visible signs of Their hard battle with wind and
wave. The Teutonic, which can easily log 450 knots
for a day's run, was unable to do better than 2SO
knots for the best day, and on Sunday the terrific
westerly gale which she encountered after clearing-
Southampton on December 9. held her down to 202
knots. The Teutonic's passengers were seasick
and her officers were weary. Captain Smith, who
was on the bridge constantly when not taking a
brief nap. was greatly fatigued ben he docked his
vessel yesterday. Several passengers who managed
to get "on deck for a few hours declared that the
waves which pounded the T tonic on Sunday
curled higher than the crow's nest and swept by
the Teutonic at forty miles an hour, it was esti
mated.
The Scharnhorst. which left Bremen for New
York on December 5, had two weeks of the gale.
Waves were recorded in her logbook as mountain
ous and the gale chronicled at hurricane force.
The big liner, however, came through unscathed.
On December 12 Janos Kazub. a steerage passenger,
Ml to the deck as the Scharnhorst lurched, and
fractured his BkOlL He died several hours after
be fell and was buried at sea.

The American liner Philadelphia, which is ex
pected to arrive in Southampton a day after Christ
mas, was held at her pier fifteen minutes yester
day before sailing to take on ISO sacks of Austral
ian ma.il that had been late in arriving at San
Francisco. She took to Europe 3.204 sacks that had
come in after the Oceanic and the Lusitania had
sailed on Wednesday. The White Star liner Teu
tonic which arrived yesterday two days late from
Southampton, brought ha 4.3C3 sacks of Christmas
mail.
COLD AIR SHIP LIMPS INTO PORT.
The steamer Cartago. of the United Fruit Com
pany which went on the rocks off the Utilla reef
on November 18. coon after she was put in the
New Orleans and Colon service, came into pert yes
terday for repairs at the Morse Ironworks, In
Sou*h Brooklyn. She was known as the cold air
sh'p because of her splendid cooling equipment,
which carried to her staterooms the cold air from
the refrigerating plant between decks. When the
Cartago went aground It was thought that she
would b« a total loss, but the '■ Chapman
Wrecking Company took hold of her and brought
her up to the city.

Clerks Feared "B. Nelson" Was Lightweight
Champion — "Just a Mistake," Says Manage/-.
The clerks at the Hotel St. Regis were thrown
Into excitement yesterday when a prospective guest,
accompanied by a valet and with considerable bag
gage, walked up to the desk and announced him
self as "B. Nelson and man. ' One clerk was on
the point of sending the new arrival to a suito
when a scared fellow clerk whispered to him that
the diminutive guest v-as none other than Battling
Nelson, the lightweight champion of the world.
Complications seemed Imminent when the stranger
suddenly discovered that he had mad* a mistake
and come to the wrong hosiery. Whereupon he
summoned his valet, and, calling a taxlcab. left
the hotel.
Assistant Manager Elliott of the St. Regis ad
mitted last night that a "Mr. Nelson** had come to
the hotel, but denied that he had been turned away
on account of a full house. "I am Mr* it was not
Battling Nelßon. the pugilist." said Mr. Elliott,
with great earnentnesui. "Besides, the Mr. Nelson
who came here was looking for some other hotel.
It was just a case of mistaken Identity,"
