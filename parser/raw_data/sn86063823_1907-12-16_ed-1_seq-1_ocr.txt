DEDICATE
NEW CHURCH
IMPRESSIVE SERVICE A FITTING
CLOSE OF GREATEST MEET
ING EVER HELD HERE.
SFVENTYONE ADDITIONS
Old Church Members Declare There
Were More Professions of Faith at
This Meeting Than at Any Other
One Ever Held in Roswell. Church
Has All Its Indebtedness Covered
by Subscription.
The enlarged and re-built house
of worship of the Christian church of
Roswell was dedicated at the Sunday
morning service, the dedicatory ser
vice being the appropriate close of
the tremendous revival which has for
three weeks been attracting general
attention. There were seventy-one ad
ditions to the church during the meet
ing, nearly all of them upon profes
sion of faith, and this, the old -church
members declare to he the largest
number or conversions at any one
meeting in the history of Roswell.
Rev. R. R. Hamlin, the evangelist,
preached the dedicatory sermon, which
was a plea for the Disciples of Christ,
eloquent and appropriate.
A beautiful solo was sung by Evan
gelist Daugherty, and a special music
al program was rendered by the choir.
After this service the pastor, Klder
C. C. Hill, made a financial statement,
in which lie said that the new build
ing had been erected at a cost of
$7,000, of which $4.iHi had been paid
and $1,000 more "had been subscribed.
He said that with the revival expenses
to "pay," there was a deficit of about
$2,400, 1ut that this money would pay
for everything, including the price of
the seats in the church and the work
of stuccoing the outside of the build
ing, which is yet to be done. He made
a plea for cash and subscriptions, and
in a very few minutes the whole sum
was subscribed. With every debt of
the church covered by cash in hand
or subscription, Mr. Hamlin dedicated
the house to the use of God by asking
for the Divine blessing.
At the meeting yesterday morning
there was one conversion, and seven
more came forward last night, all
grown men. Both morning and even
ing the house was packed, and last
night many were turned away.
The evangelists will leave Tuesday
morning, but before they go will give
a benefit entertainment for Miss Eva
Nelson, who has assisted through the
meeting and desires to complete 'her
imisical education. Rev. Mr. Hamlin
will give a lecture tonight, assisted
"by Mr. Daugherty, who will use his
stereopticon In putting on something
entertaining. The best of music will
be given. The entertainment will be
held tonight at the Christian church.

With the departure of the fleet the
officers of the Mayflower proceeded
to get under way almost at once so

head of the formidable column and
lead the way to the reviewing "point

were issued at the same time upon

the time the battle ships began to

as Taggart, chairman of the Demo

W. Fairbanks will be the chief candi
date in Chicago for . the Republican,
presidential nomination.
"I learned enough in the East on
this question," said Mr. Taggart, "to
cause me to make this assertion. The
fact that President Roosevelt has de-
jclared himself absolutely out of the
Tace, coupled with the fact that the
Republicans will not allow themselves
to be Influenced in favor of Taft just
because he is Roosevelt's favorite,
convinces me that Mr. Fairbanks will
have the ibest show of any man be
fore the convention.
"Everywhere in New York I had
people asking me the question,, 'How
about the man from Indiana?' Of
course they alluded to" Fairbanks. I
informed them that the man from In
diana was all rigbt, but also told
them that the Democrats will bring
forward a man who can defeat any
one the Republicans nominate."

CURRENCY
MATTERS
THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CUR
RENCY TREATS OF RECENT
FINANCIAL FLURRY.
PROPOSES A REMEDY
Mr. Ridgeley Would Establish a Cen
tral Bank of Issue by the Govern
ment. This Would, He Says, Ena
ble Banks to Meet Sudden Calls for
Money.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 16. In his
annual report to congress made today
Wm. B. Ridgeley, comptroller of the
currency, treats of the recent money
tightness in the United States, and
suggests . a remedy. The report says
that the deposits in all the banks re
porting to the comptroller were
$13,099,615,348, a gain of over five
hundred and sixty-eight millions with
in the past seven years. The total
stock of money reported the first of
July, 1907, was $3,115,600,000.
"The conditions which led to the
panic in October and November were
not due to failures of individual
banks," says the report, "they were
not due to lack of confidence on the
people in the banks, but to lack of
confidence on the part of the Ibanks
themselves in their reserves. They
feared there was not sufficient cur
rency, and the result was a currency
famine.
The remedy for this state of affairs
is to improve the reserve system so
that the reserve deposits can be kept
in banks where they will surely be
available. We must impart to our cur
rency system some element of elas
ticity so that when there comes a
sudden demand for currency it can
be supplied to the banks without de
pleting the supply of reserve money.
These desirable changes can best be
accomplished, in fact, CAN ONLY BE
SATISFACTORILY ACCOMPLISHED
THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT j
BY THE GOVERNMENT OF A CEN
TRAL BANK OF ISSUE AND RE
SERVE."

THE CARRIZOZO PIPE
- LINE IS A BIG THING.
L W. Adams has returned from, a
two weeks' stay at Parson and Cap-

work on his mining claims, and toe
reports that the work of laying the
Carrizozo water pipe line 1b in prog-
ress in spite of the chilly weather in
the mountains. The line, he says, has
to be seen to realize its magnitude.
As many know, -the line is (being laid
from this side of. the Oapitan water
shed to Carrizozo and Santa Rosa, a
distance of 157 miles, and will cost
something over a million dollars. The
main part of the pipe is 12 inches fit
diameter, but in places it is increased
to sixteen inches.
The pipe was made in Elmira, N
Y. It is constructed of Canadian
white pine, is coated over with tar,
in which is rubbed & thick coat of
sawdust. The pipe is buried about
feet. The pipe line starts in the south
fork of the Bonito, three miles from
the point where the south fork joins
the north. It will carry pure,-cold wat
er, composed almost entirely of melted
snow. The water is being secured by
the Rock Island railroad to use in its
engines, and its purity will mean an
immense saving on the boilers, as the
water now being used (between Aroa-
rillo and El Paso is generally .very
bad. The men that furnished the pipe
say that this is the longest line of this
kind in the world.

TALLMADGE CASE WILL TAKE UP

AFTER CHRISTMAS.
ONLY EIGHT WITNESSES
Eight Days Have Been Consumed In
the Examination of About One-Third
of the Prosecution's' Witnesses, and
Then Comes the Defense,
"I do not expect the present case
against the Tallmadge brothers to be
finished before Christmas," said
Judge G. A. Richardson, one of the
attorneys for the defense, this after
noon. Major Llewellyn, for the gov
ernment, admitted that he would not
be surprised if the case takes up the
time of the court that length of time,
and since both sides agree on the sub
ject, it is quite probable that the holi
days will come with the Tallmadge
case still on trial.
The prosecution has 25 witnesses
on its list, and in eight days only
eight witnesses have (been examined.
This shows how slowly the case has
been progressing and the percentage
in the volume of evidence yet to be
brought out. After the prosecuting
witnesses will come those for the de
fense.
All day Saturday and part of today
the court was engaged in examining
Judge Howard Leland, register of the
land office, former Receiver D. L. Gey-
er, and others, showing the records
in the case. Thus far the government
has been offering evidence to show
a conspiracy on the part of the Tall
madge brothers, and now -they will
try to show acts that followed in car
rying out the plans of the alleged con
spiracy. Harry endall was the first
witness put on the stand show
these alleged acts. He was on the

LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF
CURRENCY LEGISLATION.
Washington, Dec. 14. It can .be
3tated on the highest authority that
the sub-committee of the House
Committee on Banking and Currency,
now dealing with the Bubjeot, can
have its way, no effort will be made
by the present congress to adopt leg
islation remedial of the present finan
cial condition. All the energies of
that committee will (be directed toward
the framing and passing of laws more
general in character and which will
be intended to preclude shrinkage of
the circulation entailing wide-spread
financial distress. Assurances of elas
ticity by the adoption of the credit
currency system may be recommended
or some different measure toward the
same and may eventually be decided
by the committee for the correction
of .the present condition. The sub
committee held a four-hour confer
ence today with its chairman. Repre
sentative Fowler, of New Jersey, at
which the bill that the sub-committee
has undertaken to draft was earnestly
discussed, but no decision as to its
precise character and scope was
reached. It is not likely the sub-com
mittee will Ibe ready to report on the
bill until after the holidays. Men high
n the world of finance will be given
an opportunity to appear before the
committee to present their views on
the proposed measure. Much time will
be spent in both house and senate in
considering the .bill when reported,
and it is the hope of the members of
the committee that the finances of the
country will have so adjusted -themselves
by that time that there will be
no necessity for legislation looking to
the correction of present conditions.
