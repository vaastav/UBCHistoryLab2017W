In order .to make assurance

the Senator cn Monday
introduced a bill into the Senate, re

Legislature. The President and Con
gress will not permit that State to

therefore, we meet with, them we in
variably desire that our readers may
enjoy tLecu The-following from
the Courier of yesterday! h a splendid
specimen aa improvement, if any
thin?, on its "'Sunday Law" edi-toriala'-lt
is designed to make party
capital out of President Geant's Mes-
sage. Thus the Courier:
But Mr. Grant now tells ua that
foreigners who become citizens of the
United Siates, but who go abroad in
the interest or trade and commerce,
and who become domiciled for a term
of years upon foreign Boil, must not
ftrnect the protection of the Amen
can flag in their foreign homes. They
must be looked upon as adventurers,
claim: nz the protection ol this Uov
ernrsent, but contributing nothing
to its revenues, because they; dwell
in other lands. They, must bo re
farmed as cheat3 and imnosters. de
inandinir Protection, but avoiding the
support of the Government. So says
Mr. Grant!
' American citizens native and to
the manor born," may go abroad and
invest their means in speculation.
Let the hand of-tyranny tall upon
their shoulders, and the power of their
native government 'is stretched forth
lor their protection. But because a
m citizen was unfortunate enough to be
born abroad, he must be abandoned
in the hour of his trial because he
had cot been fortunate enough in his
new home to accumulate wealth that
would afford him protection and com
fort ! , - :
Will the people of the United State a
sustain such an outrageous dogma f
Is our Government to fail of its
support of naturalized American citi
zens when traveling or doing business
1 abroad I .
Is tho new doctrine of Mr. Grant
to supplant the longestablishcd policy
or the American republic f
, , There are other -matters connected
with the message equally monstrous
We shall call the attention of the
peop!o to them. We Ehall expose the
approach to Imperialism in our teems
war, as best we can.
The message of Mr. Grant is full of
the most glaring recommendations of
wrong, and contains but little that is
right and commendable. It3 foreign
policy is its most terrible feature, and
- its domestic recommendations, in
' their mildest sense, are intolerable to
a people who have been free and seek
the continuanco of freedom.
Turning to the President's Message,
we find the following paragraph to be
the cause cf the Courier's indignation :
The unsettled political condition of
countricss less fortunate than our
own sometimes indueos their citizens
to come to the United .States for
the sole-purpose of becoming nat
uralized. Having secured this, they
return to their native country and re
side there without disclosing their
change of allegiance. They occupy
official positions, or positions of trust
or honor, whiGh can only be held by
citizens of their . native land; they
travel under " passports describing
them as such citizens, and it is only
when civil discord, after, perhaps,
year3 of quiet, threatens their per
sons or their property, or when their
native State drafts them into its mili
tary service, that the fact of their
change of allegiance is made known.
They reside, permanently out of the
United States. They contribute noth
ing to .its revenues; they avoid the
duties of its citizenship, and they only
make themselves known by a claim of
protection I have directed Diplo
matic and Consular omcera of t
United States to scrutinize carefully
all such claims of protection. The
citizen of the United States, whether
.1 natives or adopted, who discharges his
duty to hi3 country, is entitled to its
complete protection. While I have a
" voice in the direction of affairs,. I
shall not consent to injure the sacred
" right by conferring it upoa fictitious
or fraudulent claimants. -.
So the Courier would have the Gov
erhmeht of the United confer all the
; benefits of citizenship upon men who
permanently reside in foreign lands,
holding positions of honor and trust
,? which they could not hold were their
American citizenship known, and who
draw their naturalization papers only
when their, native States draft them
into military service. They avoid all
tho dutie3 of citizenship, and only
make themselves known by a claim of ,
I protection. They are to all intents
; and purposes fictitious or fraudulent
claimants, and arc not entitled to the
protection of the Government. We
honor the President for his manly re
pudiation of these bogU3 American I
citizens. Citizenship imposes duties
as well as confers privileges. Those
who refuse to discharge the duties,
are not entitled to the privileges.
Tns Missouri Democrat closes an
article onlhe IUchardson-McFariand
difficulty, ia . JSW 'York, with, the
following paragraph, which has in it
much that is worth remembering:
As a rule, it may to said thart a
husband and wife luxve once lived
happily together, there can never be
a separation without misconduct by
three persons, the husband, the wife
and somebody else. The husband
who never neglects his wife will not,
as a rule, ever have to buy a pistol to
snoot her . seducer. The wife who
never fails ia her duty to her husband,
Hi;-0 a3 a rulo hav5 seek pro-ft-
um BOme other man. And
!n,n ? De-?cr interferes between
husband and wile, who never makes
himself to the wife a nearer friend
than her husband, who never seeks
herlovo on the one hand draws
too near if she invites, on the other,
will never as a rule get shot by an
'infuriated husband." There mav
be exceptions to these rules. But
there are not many. And we think
a study of them likely to bo more
beneficial than Mr. Prothingbam's
prayer or Mr. Bcecher's remarks at
the funeral. , .

Mnsic Teaching Suggestions.
Tn this letter I will 'depart, in
ropaarire. from the subiect which the
heading suggests, a3I wish to speak
tlv hear it stated or surmised
hv scientific men (or those wno
ouht to be) tnat singing is an idju
ry, that it has injured this person or
thnt nPTson. and thereby convey the

is supposed to be scientific and who
is generally wen miormeo, wn
very naturally exert a wide spread
influence, especially over those (and
tho class is laree) who very seldom, if
ever, reflect or reason irom causs to
effect." What 13 tne result t it is
this : " Why do you let your daughter
take lessons in singing f Why do
voa let her 6inz -so much? Don
you know that she will have the con-
- aA . Ml t Mil'
sumntion. ll vou co tnat it will kui i
The-ocly or most fitting reply to such
a stupid thought would be, ".Non
sense ' And yet this would not De
areument. To those who think or are
well informed, it seems almost m
credible that any argument or discus
iirm is necessary to dissipate the
mind of such a cross error, lie
Hcrt fnr iiist & moment that tb
suggestion is not in regara to mm
but to "her." I have never-heard
this reason given why boys should not
study vocal culture and practice sing
ing. Why so? Is.it because boys,
or young men, never devote or give
attention to this valuable and inter
esting study? or, as Bassini says, be
cause the organism of woman is bo
different from that of man that she
cannot exercise tho lungs and chest as
men do during the act of respiration.
No one believes the former, (not
even in this city) and every physician"
or common sense person, will ridicule
the idea as being very absurd. -The
reason if there is aDy why ladies
(women, I should say) cannot exercise
the chgst and lungs properly andpAy
siologically, whether during the act
of singing or not, is evident. , It need
not ; be stated . here. ; My pupils,
whether private or class, understand
me upon this point, and if they fail to
give heed to the plainly spoken sug
gestions and. advice, it is cither be
cause they are not fully convinced of
tho benefits to bo derived from put
ting the suggestions injo practice
every day or they lack physical en
ergy and mental force to make the
requisite effort. This latter is too
often the reason, I fear In ninc
tenths of the cases, where any lDjury
results from vocal practice, it is be
cause the proper. organs or muscles
7ie motive' potcfr are not brought
into exercise. This mode of practice
is just about as absurd as to attempt
to lift a heavy weight with the arm by
simply exercising the muscles of the
arm or leg. Men are at fault in this
respect, the same as women, though
not to the same degree.
I will here remark that this igno
rance of the laws of health ought to
be corrected in our common schools
and colleges, and I venture to say
that in the majority cf schools where
Physiology" is recognized as an im
portant branch of study and instruc
tion is actually given but very little,
if anything, is said in regard Jto the
coirect method of breathing. And if
the Bubject is hinted at, it is not made
practical. Not one professional elo
cutionist in ten does justice to his
class in this particular. Tho " Min
ister's sore throat " is the natural re
sult of ignorance. But to finish what
I havo to say upon this subject would
mrVe it too long. More anon.

Midsummer Mght's Dream in Boston.
Marie Twain's Cor. EalTalo Express.
Boston has ; resurrected "Midsum
mer Night's Dream," and doing it
after a more splendid fashion than
has ever beea attempted with a
Shakesperian play in America before.
In consequence, Selwyn's thoatre is
likely to be crowded for many a com
ing night. , Some of the scenery in
this new wonder ia marvelous. In
one part of the play the curtain rises
upon a spcctacl-j something like this:
In the foreground a lake as smooth
and as glassy as a mirror; about its
borders a luxurious growth of trop
ical plants; in tha center a very small
island, with one or two stately trees
on, it whoso roots are hidden among
blossoming plants and both trees
and plants are faithfully mirrored in
the lake; beyond are two or three
simikr islands, one behind another,
and each glassia,; itself in the water
the outlines of the trees and reflec
tions growing fainter and fainter in
the'.receding distance; in the far back
ground the lake narrows to a winding
river, which, is soon lost among tow
ering mountains. A11 this in a rich,
dreamy sort of twilight. .i
Presently a mellow radiance -begins
to m suffuse the sky behind , the
mountains; it grow?, brightens, and
a silver edge of the moon peeps
above a distant crag; in a few mo
ments the entire moon appears, casts
an amber glory over trees, islands,
lake and river drifts behind a cloud
appears again is lost behind a orag,
but marks it3 course with a silver
edge as it moves along then comes
out full in tho heavens again, and
straightway its wrinkled and glitter
ing reflection ' comes shimmering
across tho water, just as you have
seen a catspaw of wind mark its ap
proach on a river. It is enchant
ingly beautiful. Nature herself could
not spirit away a twilight more deftly
and replace it -with the tender luster
of the moon more hapDily.
Presently tho Ecene "become a pano
rama. The islands go drifting away
out of eight, the lake crows broader
and broader, till its burnished surface
stretches away into an enchanted
distance; and now its perfect natural
ness is made still more noticeable as
curves and "shreds of Eeawced and
other trifles floating on it3 surface
drift into the quivering track of the
moon and are instantly lit up with a
bright sheen and then drift out
gam and take the dull hue they had
before. Directly, right in tho fore-
round, a small island glides into
iew with a venerable rum en jt Uvo

bases the fallen entablatures, wreatr-
ed with ivy. Imagino tho picture of
the guttering sea around about tms
oneJy old temple on its paten ot
island, and the yellow disk of tne
moon appeariDg and disappearing as
it shows between the black columns
one moment, sliding their fluting3,
and hides behind an intervening on
the next.
The temple elides away, and we
ose it and regret it. But shortly tho
placid sea begins to assume a chilly
ook, and in another moment a vast
iceberg, undermined with huge arches,
comes into view then a brilliant
group of such. An arch of blinding
lght (Lne aurora boreaiis), lalls upon
thc.ECJne, and whatsoever wander3
into it flitting fanes, swimming
water-spirits, swans, doomed and
pinnacled -icebergs are glormed ror
that moment, as n tee iigninins
clothed them. The elouda in the sky
are filled with all manner of fantas
tic little devila and such things, and
presently among these clouds appears
a great, round, dimly defined disk;
with two female figares in it, royally
attired, but with such a soft, exquis
ite film about them' that they eeem
unreal,- intangible,; spiritualized an
illusion, a dream, a vision, almost a
part of the cloudy surroundings.
