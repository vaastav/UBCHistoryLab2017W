Chaplains' Opening Prayers Scores of
Office-seekers Will Flock to Capitol.
ARCHBALD TRIAL ON TO-MORROW
Legislators Will Adjourn To-day Out of Respect for
Vice President Sherman and Others Who Have
Died During Congressional Vacation.
The last session of the Sixty-second Congress will convene at noon
to-day. Practically a full representation of both houses is in Wash
ington ready for the Chaplains' opening prajers.
In addition to Senators and Representatives, there is an unusually
large number of outsiders who have been drawn to Washington at
this time for one reason or another. Many Democrats have come on
to interview Senators and Representatives about office under the new
administration.
A considerable representation from commercial bodies and indus
trial enterprises is here to inquire about the tariff. The announcement
by Chairman Underwood, of the Wajs and Means Committee, that
gearings will begin immediately after the holidays was a signal to all
the industrial interests and to im-
porters to hurry to Washington
and make' their plans to be heard,
Real Bailneu To-morrow.
Little of Importance will be done In
either House to-dar. Both Houses will
adjourn almost Immediately after being
ailed to order, out of respect for the
memory of notable men who have died

other reason, both Houses would prompt
ly adjourn out of respect for Vice Presi
dent Sherman, but there have been va
cancies created b death In both the
Senate and House since the adjournment.
The Archbald case, an Impeachment
tral which involves Judge Robert W.
Archbald, of the United States Commerce
Court. Is on the calendar for to-morrow.
President Taft'a first message, dealing
with foreign relations, will go to Con
gress tomorrow. His second message,
dealing with general subjects, will be
submitted Friday, according to present
information. With the knowledge that
the Senate will prompUy adjourn, the
President will hardly send in any nomi
nations to-daj, in the Judgment of Sen
ator. The Supreme Court will divide Interest
to-day with the two Houses of Congress.
The court will meet at noon, after two

the Ninth circuit.
II embers of the House who have ar
rived in Washington are giving most
of their atention to the preparation
of the general appropriation bills.
There is a general sentiment expressed
bj Senators and Representatives that
the session which opens to-morrow
will probably transact very little im
portant business outside of the general
appropriation bills.
The Ways and Means Committee of
the House will be busy with tariff
hearings and it Is not unlikely that
the Democratic members of the Fi
nance Committee of the Senate will
be in dally touch with these hearings,
believing that In this way the tariff
legislation may be expedited after- it
has been -submitted to the extra ses
sion. It is the experience of leaders
in Congress that more than half of
the struggle to pass a tariff bill occurs.

lation. One of the most Important bills be
fore the House is the employers' lia
bility and workmen's compensation act,
which was passed by the Senate at the
last session and is now before a com
mittee of the House. This bill was
prepared by a special commission of
which Senator George Sutherland of
Utah, was president, after prolonged
bearings and an exhaustive Investi
gation and report on the general sub

One of the sins crying to heaven for
vengeance is the hideous example given
by the smart set to their domestics and
retainers. The vices that they practice
in their drawing rooms, dining halls, and

Father Vaughn's book, "The Sins of
Society," caused a great sensation at the
time of its publication, because of its
pregnant denunciation of modernity with,
its cluster ot-vices. and he has Just com
pleted a new book; "Socialism from the
Christian Standpoint. He says he

the Socialist, and grateful to the Social
ists for revealing the social sores that
were bidden away from all but its vic

new book. "I do not believe In the So

night and was so badlj crushed he may
be crippled for life.
William H Lelmbach, a grocer, of
607 Sixth Street Southwest, stopped the
car Just after it struck the boy. picked
up the lad, and made a quick run to
Providence Hospital. The grocer de
livered the little patient into the care
of nurses with a request that no ex
pense be spared in attending the lad.
Re-entering his touring car, Lelmbach
drove to the Fourth Precinct Station,
where he reported the accident to the
police His explanation of the mishap
was later verified by a number of wit'
nesses. who agreed that the accident

said the lad ran Into the machine.
The child was playing with several
companions at Sixth and School Streets
as the touring car, driven by Lelmbach
accompanied by his wife and two daugh

north In Sixth Street at slova speed.
Mrs. Lelmbach saw the children play

Joseph Regan evidently did not hear the
auto horn, for he Jumepd over the curb

his brother a few feet behind. Half way
across the street the child ran Into the

Lieut Gen. Nelson A. Miles, retired
commander-in-chief of the United States

Westminster.
That recent proposed changes in the
militia organization, with regard to re
organizing It Into tactical divisions,
thereby securing greater efficiency in
time of war, has any immediate war
like significance. Is not believed by Gen.
Miles. He holds that this nation is far
too powerful to be lightly molested by
any other nation At the Bame time, he
urges an adequate military establish
ment and a state of preparedness as the
best guarantee of peace.
But compulsory military service is In
his opinion wrong. "The United States
must not be Germanized." he says. "The
strength of our standing army should be
one soldier to each MOO Inhabitants, and
this ratio should bo recommended to the
European powers."

"DIVINE SARAH"
"PIPED ASHORE"
Mme. Bernhardt Gets Rousing
Welcome When She Lands
in New York.
New York. Dec L Mme Sarah Bern
hardt, the famous tragedienne, and her
company of twenty-five arrived to-day
on La Savole, and are to-night rushing
over the country In a special train bound
for Chicago, where the great actress
opens her first American season in
vaudeville to-morrow afternoon.
The "Divine Sarah," looking not a day
older than ' on her previous farewell
tours, which run back some years, an
nounced that this was not a farewell
tour, and this was taken by many to
mean that It should properly be termed
a post-farewell visit. The actress was
welcomed on the pier by about 300 of
her countrymen, who cheered wildly as
she descended the gangplank, leaning
on the arms of Capt, Tourette. of the
Savole, and Louis Tellengen. madames
leading man. Several of her friends, in
cluding one man who rushed up and
kissed her. were there to greet Mme.
Bernhardt, who exclaimed In French:
"Oh, I am bo happy to be back once
morel"
The tragedienne was "piped ashore" in
true nautical style. The sailors lined
up on the deck of La Savole. and as
Mme. Bernhardt went down the gang
plank gave three rousing cheers., She
waved her hand and smiled in reply.
Mme. Bernhardt stood the voyage well,
although there was considerable rough
weather on Thursday, when La Savole
passed through what the sailors termed
a cyclone.
Mme. Bernhardt wore a yellow doe
skin coat, three-quarters length, trimmed
with brown fur, a brown hat to match,
and brown featln shoes. She carried a
huge bouquet of chrysanthemums and
juueniwi ueauiy roses, -n uu vvk
ers'she said:
"I am delighted to bo back in America
again, and t want jou to say for me
that this is not a farewell lour., Now,
I know you are going to esk me bow

Strong Efforts to Be Made to
Prevent SelKtlon of Banker
as Inaugural Chairman.
SAY HE IS BULL MOOSE
Other Candidates Still in the Field.
Nothing to Be Done Until Wil
son's Return to America.
Appeal to President-elect Woodrow
Wilson to disregard the selection of
Eldridge E. Jordan, the Washington
banker slated for the Inaugural com
mittee chairmanship, by conferences of
authoritative Democrats held here and
in New York, probably will be made.
It was learned last night.
Allegations that Mr. Jordan not only
has not been closely affiliated with the
uemocratlc party, but even that he has
been a Bull Moose, have been frequent
ly made since It was made known that
his name had been submitted to President-elect
Wlson, and many Demo
crats are not pleased with the choice
offered for Mr. Wilson's Indorsement.
It was stated last night that Demo
crats of national influence would take
up with Mr. Wilson the question of
th selection of the inaugural com
mittee chairman, and urge upon him
consideration of men who were
possessed of the required ability and
the same time are more closely
and prominently allied with the mili
tant order of Democrats.

The announcement of Mr Jordan s se

never had official recognition, and neither

ot Mr. Jordan any friend of Mr Jordan
will talk about the chairmanship except
to own to the soft impeachment, alreadv

That the opposition to Mr Jordan s
appointment may be carried far can eas
ily be comprehended when it is recalled
that members ot Congress and of the
Democratic National Ccmmlttee have
taken a very zealous interest, perhaps a
more lntene Interest than ever before.

taken into an actual contest with Mr.

and select a "dark horse."
Word Received.
No word from either Gov. Wilson or
WlllUm F McCorabs, Democratic na

the Inaugural committee chairman was
received last night. Outwardly at least
the case is unchanged. The men con
cerned are not talking. Telegraph wires
have borne mystic magic messages to
far parts of the country, and lengthier
letters are on their way to Important per

are to be conferences, the gist of the talk

London, Dec. 1 While the announce

Despite the tenacity with which the
Turkish representatives at Bagtche have
Insisted on the retention of bcutarl and
Aorianople as Turkish territory, there
can be but little doubt that both sides win
welcome a cessation of hostilities on an
honorable. basis. Turkej, not vet recov

to continue the struggle with the dash
