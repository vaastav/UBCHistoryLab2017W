ate liquidation of chureh property,
and also voted to call out 5500 stu
dents for the priesthood to the colors.

Women lake More Interest Than Men
Paris, Dec. 11. There was a large
attendance at mass this morning,
mostly women, Indicating the men are
Indifferent to the fight on the church.
The priests named the services for a
week without reference to the illegal
tatus they will assume after today.
The government says It Is not to be
forced Into a sensational attitude by
the Intemperate. Cardinal Hlchard,
archbishop of Pat is, says there will be
no violence, but only passive resistance
and will axhaust all protests at every
step.
C hurch and lergy KcIh-IUous.
Pan?, Pee. 11. The new law pro.
viding for the separation of church
and Male came Into effect today and
never In the history of the country,
since the great revolution, have more
drastic changes been made. The
church and clergy are rebellious, the
Vatican points the finger of scorn to
France, and Lui-jpe generally looks
on the sequestration us marking an
epoch In the world's hlsUiry.
Tinier the new law the churches will
rem. tin open for public worship as
provided by the law of the assembly
of 1SH1, but the change not only af
fects France but the Roman Catholics
all over the world, as the movement
ha betn made to strike at the foun
dation of the religion. Fiphty-four
blrhops, two cardlnalB and upu.trds. of
2'.'0P prlerts under the law of toduy
uie unprovided for.
Cardinal I.ecol, archbishop cf l!or
ricaiix, has issued nn appeal to the
faithful not to Join "faise Catholics
and bad priests In Ihe formation of
associations to lake over the church
property." In an epistle, supposed to
be inspired from the Vatican, he warns
all French Catholics that they will
lose the right to confess and receive
the sacrament If they take part In
tho movement.
The cardinal archbishop of Rouen
today Issued a proclamation condemn
ing the action ol the government and
an appeal to tho Konian Catholics of
the world points out the attempt to
undermine the faith. His manifesto
winds up with the words, "Those who
help the movement will not only die
In a state of sin, but the obligation will
resit upon their posterity so long as
the memoiy of the robbers remains."
Decision of the Vatican.
Passive resistance to the operation
of the government's , program is the
gist of the decision of the Vatican,
which Is given In full below:
Prtlslon a ft lie Vatican.
The decision of the Vatican, which
Is In the form of answers to specific
questions, may be summarized as fol
lows: "P'irlrh priests, vicars, etc., must
remain paMve ir.d may not co-opcr-ate
In any act of sequestration, hut If
tho bishop considers that the refusal
of the treasurers tQ.suriender the keys

Europe." "
nance of their families, but parish
priests, and other Catholics cannot
participate In acts of sequestration in
any manner unless the sequestered
ecclesiastical paity Is permitted to pay

"Churches, preshyterins, episcopal
mansions, seminaries, etc.. which are

of nbsolule necessity, and after the
administrator has signed n declara
tion not to attempt In any way to
abtldge the liberty of the lessee.
"If called to the colors ecclesiastics
must appeal to the council of state
hat pending the council's decision
should their failures to respond to the
call sulilecl them the penalty of

and, if cultural associations are form
ed the pailsh priest must remain ir
his church and continue to say mass
until driven out by violence.
"If n schismatic priest appears the
legitimate priest must leave tht

noil r.ii-in i: iro In Jeopardy.
Yuma. Aiz., Dec. 11. The awful I
scourge of the uncontrolled Colorado)
river Is again raging at Imperial val-j
ley and tearing away the barriers be-
tween them. The entire current of
the river Is ngnln flowing almost un
restricted through entirely new chan
nels Into Imperial valley, and the
Coachella valley Is doomed, though
the process of Us obliteration will be
slow until the waters reach a higher
general level by tho filling up of Im
perial valley to the high water mark
reached during the past summer.
What Is known ns the Hind dam
wns thrown across the channel form
ed last summer, nnd nn earth dike
was built up parallel to the rrver for
10 miles, mainly In Mexico. On the
Arizona side of the river Is the gov
ernment dike. Three days ago water
found Its way through both dikes,
flooding large areas. This was
thought to be serious, but was net
considered critical until last night,
when the water developed a distinct
channel, nnd this morning disclosed
the fact thnt the entire river had
fonnd Its way around the Hind dam
Into the channel from which It was
Just barred. The dam Itself la un
injured. The new movement Involves ngnln
moving the main lino of the Southern
Pacific to higher ground unless the
water can be brought under control.
A thousand peoplo In Snlton basin
must lose their homes. Including a
quarter of a million acres of farm
ing lands, the Southern Pacific must
build 200 miles of new mnln line, and
Irrigation about Yumn must be oban
doned. The government lnguna dam
irrigation project mny become an Im
possibility. At a conservative esti
mate not less than $25,000,000 of
present values are at stake upon the
success of the efforts to close the
break.

Is Omniscient In Ftali Politics and

Smith Equally Culpable In That Re.
spoct.
Washington, Dec. 11. Burrows,
chairman of the senate committee on
privileges and elections, opened the
Smoot debate this afternoon. In a
speech of 30,000 words, carefully pre
pared, he marshaled arguments
against seating Smoot. Early In the
argument he said there is no evidence
thnt Smoot Is guilty of polygamy.
He referred to the position of Pres
ident Smith as a laborer In the Mor
mon hierarchy, the husband of five
wives and the father of 43 children,
and quoted Smith's testimony that
congress had nothing to do with his
private life. He said Smoot is dis
qualified because of being a member
of the Mormon hierarchy Interferes
with the functions of state because
the hierarchy of which he Is a mem
ber, encourages polygamy, and be
cause Smoot as a member of the hie
rarchy had taken an oath hostile to
the government of the United States,
and Incompatible with his obligations
as a senator.
He reviewed the domination of the
Mormon church In politics, and said
there Is no case In Utah showing the
defeat of a man favored by the Mor
mon church, nor of one's election
when the church opposed him.
