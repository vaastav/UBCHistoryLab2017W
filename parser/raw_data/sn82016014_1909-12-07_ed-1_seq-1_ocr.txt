TAFT SPEAKS OUT
His Annual Message to Congress
Delivered Today.

Similar Ones Before.
OMITS BIG QUESTIONS.
Such as Anti-Trust, Interstate
Commerce and Conservation.
But These Will Be Handled in
Communications Later.
FOR CIYIL PENSIONS.
President Thinks They Will
Benefit Government Service.
Economy in Expenditures
Strikes Him as Most Important.
President Taft's message to con
gress, which is printed in full else
where in this issue of the State Jour
nal, is a voluminous document com
prising some sixteen thousand words.
Nearly half of it is devoted to a de
tailed report of the activities of the
department of state since the begin
ning of the Taft administration. Presi
dent Taft explains the devotion of so
much space to state affairs by stating
that there Is no provision by statute
or custom for a formal report by the
secretary of state to the president or
to congress, and a presidential mes
sage is the only means by which the
conditions of our foreign relations can
be brought to the attention of con
gress and to the public.
Except as to the relations between
this government and Nicaragua it is
pointed out by the president that the
United States is on a most friendly
footing with all of the other nations
of the earth.
As to Nicaragua.
Concerning the difficulties with
Nicaragua President Taft says: "Since
the Washington conventions of 1907
were communicated to the govern
ment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party, this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another, and
in turn by all of the five Central
American republics, to exert itself for
the maintenance of the conventions.
Nearly every complaint has been
against the Zelaya government of
i'?aragua, which has kept Central
America in. constant tension and tur
moil." He says that the efforts of the gov
ernment to promote peace have been
appreciated by a majority of these
countries who are loyal to their true
Interests, and that it is unnecessary to
rehearse the sad tale of unspeakable
barbarities and oppression alleged to
have been committed by the Zelayla
government. Continuing, the presi
dent says: "Recently two Americans
were put to death by the order of
President Zelaya himself. They were
officers in the organized forces of a
revolution which had continued many
weeks and was in control of about
half of the republic, and as such, ac
cording to the modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations, they
were entitled to be dealt with as
prisoners of war." The president
then tells of the termination of diplo
matic relations with the Zelaya gov
ernment and of his intentions to take
such steps as may be found to be
consistent with this government's
dignity in protecting American in
terests in Nicaragua, and he says it
may be necessary for him to bring
this subject to the attention of con
gress in a special message. He ad
vocates legislation which will permit
of the reorganization of the state de
partment along the lines suggested by
Secretary Knox, which were made
public the other day.
Economy Urged.
. President Taft insists that the most
important question presented to th3
administration is that of economy in
expenditures and sufficient revenue. He
Bays that on June 30. 1910. the ordinary
expenditures will exceed the revenue
by $34,075,620. If the $38,000,000 which
willi be expended during the year for
the Panama canal, and the $1,000,000 to
bo - paid on the public debt, is added
to this sum. it will make a total deficit
of $73,075,620. He points out that the
Panama canal expenditures will be met
by bond Issues and that it is now ex
pected that the total cost of the canal
will be $375,000,000. He says tht under
his direction the estimates for expendi
tures for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1911. are less than the appropriations
for the current fiscal year by $42,818,000.
1 his, with the income expected during
that period and excluding the prfymnta
on the Panama canal work, will leave
a surplus in the treasury of $35,931,000
on that date. He tells congress that
the estimates have been cut to the
quick and that a further parirg down
of them by congress will result in seri
ously hampering the proper adminis
tration of the departments. He be
lieves that much economy in govern
ment administration can be obtained
ty a reorganization of the clerical
forces of the government.' a reclassifi
cation of the kind of work they do,
so that it will be possible for clerks of
high ability to receive more compensa
tion than others; and the elimination
from the government service of those
who are inefficient from any cause, "and
as the degree of efficiency in all de
partments is much lessened by the re
tention of all the employes who have
outlived their usefulness. It is indispen
sable to any proper system of economy
that provision be made so that their
separation from the service shall be
easy and inevitable TL is Impossible to
make such provision unless there is
adopted a plan of civil pensions."
Sugar Trust Frauds.
The president states hat the sugar
trust frauds are to be probed to th-j
very bottom; that the department of
justice and the treasury department are
exerting every effort to discover the
wrong doers in connection with them,
including officers and employes of the
companies who may have been privy
to the fraud. He also states that in
vestigation of these frauds by congress
at present pending the probing going
on by the departments of justice and

treasury, might by giving - immunity
and otherwise, prove an embarrassment
in securing the conviction oi the guilty
parties.
No Tariff Tinkering Planned.
It is President Taft's idea that the
maximum and minimum clause of the
new tariff law is not likely to lead to a
tariff war with any other foreign coun
try and hat he will do his best to avoid
any such controversy. On this matter
of the tariff, he calls attention to the
fact that the tariff board's work will
probably take from two to three years,
and that if its findings are of such
"character as to show generally that
the rates of duties imposed by the pres
ent tariff law are excessive under the
principles of protection as described In
the platform of the successful party a;
the late election, I shall not hesitate to
invite the attention of congress to this
fact and to the necessity for action
predicated thereon." He believes that
it will be unwise for congress to at
tempt any tariff legislation until the
tariff board is able to report.
Army and Navy Affairs.
On armv and navy matters the presi
dent calls attention to the points of
the secretary of war and also the
secretary of the navy. He endorses
the plans of a joint army and navy
board for the establishment of an ex
tensive naval base in Pearl harbor,
Hawaiian Islands, rather than in Ma
nila bay. He also urges the construc
r'on of additional coast . defense at
Chesapeake bay and expresses his sym
1 athy with the plans of Secretary
:Iever for a thorough reorganization
c-f the navy department: He also joins
Mr. Meyer in asking congress to au
thorize the construction of two first
cass battleships and one repair ship.
The Law's Delay.
Considerable space is devoted by the
president to the discussion of th-s law's
delay in this country. He says he does
not doubt that much of the violence
tnd cruelty exhibited in lynching is
i irectly due to tne uncertainties ana
iniustice growing out of the delays in
t'ials, judgments and executions there
of by the courts. He says that both
rtate and federal courts are defective
in these particulars, but in all prob
ability the defects are less in the fed
eial courts. He says that a procedure
n state court3 should generally roiiow
th m-ocedura in the federal courts.
and he asks congress to authorize him
to aDDOint a commission with authority
to examine the law and the -equity
nrocedure of the federal courts of the
ttrst instance, the law of appeals from
.hose courts to the court of appeals and
to the supreme court, and tne cost
imposed in such procedure upon pri
vate litigants and upon the public
treasury and make recommendation
with a view to simplifying and ex
pediting the procedure as far as pos
Fible and making it as inexpensive as
may be to the litigant of little means.
Issuance of Injunctions.
He calls for the enforcement of his
party's pledge for legislation that will
Tore accurately define by statute the
procedure in the federal courts with
respect to the issuance of the writ of
injunction. He suggests that the is
suing of such writs be forbidden with
out previous notice and a reasonable
, nnnrtiinitv to be heard on behalf of
ill parties to be enjoined unless it
Snail appeal uic "
court that the delay necessary w bi
such notice and hearing will result in
irreparable injury to the complainant.
He would limit the life of such emer
gency injunctions to seven days, unless
a full hearing the court should decide
that it was necessary.
The Postal Deficit.
. President Taft pays particular at
tention to the postal deficit, and says
it is largely caused by the low rate of
postage of one cent a pound for sec
ond class matter. He says the actual
cost of transporting this matter is
nino cents a pound. He thinks that
congress should look into the mattery
and possibly raise this rate on mag
azines and periodicals because they
are much heavier than newspapers
and contain much higher proportion
of advertising to reading matter.
Other Recommendations.
He advocates strongly the redemp
tion of the Republican party's pledge
for the establishment of postal sav
ing banks. He also favors the ship
subsidy plan and thinks that it might
be Btarted with the government's
profits on foreign mail. He asks for
a $50,000 appropriation to be used by
the secretary of commerce and labor
for the employment of special inspec
tors to investigate the white slave
traffic and bring those responsible for
it to justice. He thinks there is need
for the establishment, of a federal
bureau of health- He also asks for
a law compelling candidates in elec
tion of members of the house of rep
resentatives and the committees in
charge of their campaigns to file with
the government a statement of ' the
contributions received and expendi
tures incurred in the campaign for
such elections, and that similar leg
islation be enacted in respect to all
other elections which are constitu
tionally within the control of con
gress. Reasons for High Prices.
"Speaking generally, the country is in
a high state of prosperity.." says Presi
dent Taft in concluding his message.
"There is every reason to believe that
we are on the eve of a substantial busi
ness expansion, and we have just
garnered a harvest unexampled in the
market value of our agricultural pro
ducts. The high prices which such pro
ducts bring mean great prosperity for
the farming community, but on the
other hand they mean a very consider
ably increased burden, upon those
classes in the communit7 whose yearl.'
compensat'on does not expand with
the improvement of business and th-
general prosperity. Various reasons are
given for the high prices. The propor
tionate increase in the output of gold,
which today is the chief medium of ex
change and is in some respects a meas
ure of value, furnishes a substantia ex
planation of at least part of the in
crease in prices. The increase in popu
lation and the more expensive mode of
living of the people, which have not
been accompanied by a proportionat-!
increase in acreage production, may
furnish a further reason.
"It is well to note that the increase
in the cost of living is not confined
to this country, but prevails the
world over, and that those who would
charge increases in prices to the ex
isting protective tariff must meet the
fact that the rise in prices has taken
place almost wholly in those products
of the factory and farm in respect to
which there has been either no in
crease in the tariff or' in many in
stances a very considerable reduc
tion." Important Matters Omitted.
Such important questions as amend
ing the anti-trust and interstate com
merce laws, and the laws for the con
servation of the national resources,
Mr. Taft announces he will discuss
with congress in a special message In
the near future. i
NEAR ZERO MARK.
Coldest Weather of Season in
Kansas.
Mercury Here Drops to One
Degree Above.
STORM WAS SEVERE.
Traffic on the . Railroads Is
' Delayed.
Street Car Service Is Restored
This Morning.
After a night of wind and snow To
peka people awoke shivering in a tem
perature of 1 degree above zero. It
was again the coldest weather of the
year. This temperature prevailed at 7
and again at 8 o'clock this morning.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the temperature
began to rise slowly.
And there is the promise of the
weather man that the temperature t6
morrow will be much more to the lik
ing of the average citizen than is the
case today. The storm of yesterday
was caused by the combination of an
area of high barometer in the north
west acting in conjunction with an
area of low barometric pressure in New
Mexico. The axis of the cold weather
is west of theRockyMountains and seems
to be moving toward the South Atlantic
states. It is expected to be past To
peka and this section of the country by
tomorrow. Last night the thermometer
legistered 12 degrees below zero at Miles
City, Montana. At Bismarck, North Da
kota, the lowest temperature recorded
last night was 10 below zero and in
South Dakota the temperature tumbled
to zero. The zero weather line, how
ever, is moving north rapidly today.
Last night was the worst night of
the year in Topeka, ' From 3 o'clock
until the last car reached the barns
the street car service was demoralized.
The snow drifted in on the tracks and
cars was stuck on everj grade aloig the
line. Snow sweepers did little good be
cause the wind blow the fine snow
back upon the track rapidly as it was
removed. People waited from 6 until
8 o'clock for ears to take them home
from work and many of them did not
get cars at that time, and walked in
stead. Others who waited left the cars
and walked home, when they found
what a task it was to get home by rail.
In many cases it was necessary for the
conductor of the car to sweep the snow
eft the rail ahead of the car, vnd even
at this stow rate travel was difficult.
The street car men worked ail night
trying to get the lines in shape to nan
jile todav's traffic .This morning the
service, while delayed, was' r.ot bad
when compared with the service last
niffht.
Trouble for Railroads.
All over Kansas the storm has
caused trouble for the railroads and
delayed traffic. There is not a great
deal of wire trouble as it was too cold
for the snow to cling to the wires.
But the snow which fell drifted in the
cuts and for a time it was almost im
possible to get trains through. Rock
Island train No. 2 w-as ten hours late
according to reports received here
from the western parts of the state
this morning. It was held up six
hours on account of snow.
The temperatures reported from
over the state by the railroads range
5 below to 10 above zero. The low
est temperatures were recorded in
southwest Kansas, around Bucklin.
The wind was strong and the most
severe storm yet reported was in that
section of the country. Trouble on
the Rock Island between Topeka and
Herington was reported and caused
some delay last night but this morn
ing all the trains are moving. A slight
derailment at Dwight assisted the
storm in delaying traffic. All trains
are late today.
The Santa Fe reports snow and se
vere weather all over . Kansas but
early morning reports indicated that
there was not so much trouble with
the drifting snow as was feared. The
storm ceased about midnight after a
fall of snow which amounted to from
one and a half to three inches. The
heaviest fall of snow reported by the
Santa Fe in Kansas is on the Strong
City Newton line.
Unsheltered stock suffered in last
night's storm. It was the third day
of the storm and was the worst ex
perienced this winter for such stock.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the wind
was bruwirg 22 miles an hour from the
northwest and the temperature had
risen to 8 degrees above zero. The pre
cipitation last night amounted to .23
inches. Following are the hourly tem
peratures to3ay:

HEARING THE MESSAGE
Great Interest Manifested by Both
., Democrats and Republicans.
Washington, Dec. 7. The first an
nual message of President Taft was
presented in both houses of congress
ly Assistant Secretary - Latta and in
both houses was received shortly after
i2 o'clock.

the message began at 12:12 p. m.
rreat interest was manifested by both
Republicans and Democrats.
There was a full attendance of sena
tors on the floor of the chamber and
as soon as copies of the document had
been furnished to them they riveted
their attention upon the printed pages.
While the secretary of the senate read
the president's words, many senators
hastened over the pamphlet hunting
lor subjects in which they were espe
cially interested. Others proceeded in
;he more orderly way of following the
reading from the desk.
The portions of the message which
attracted most attentions were those
relating to the complication with Nica
ragua, the minution of public expendi
:ures, the custom house frauds and the
tariff act.
The one phrase which attracted most
f ttention was found in connection with
the president's treatment of the Zelaya
Incident of which he spoke as "the
fad tale of unspeakable barbarities."
At 1:40 p. m. the reading of the
message was concluded in the house
and that body adjourned until Friday.

pected at any time. None of the To
peka officials were able to give out
any gossip on the appointments this
afternoon. At the office of the gen
eral manager, Henry Lautz, assistant
to the general manager, had .heard
from General Manager Hurley that
Mr. Gorman had taken the appoint
ment of first vice president of the
Rock Island. The new position ac
cepted by Mr. Gorman was a source
of regret on account of his efficiency
and value to the Santa Fe. How
ever, with their civil service system In
active ODeration the Santa Fe is able
to fill the position with an experienced
man and it is hoped by Topeka as
sociates that Mr. Koontz will be ten
dered the important position in Chi
cago. ,
In case Mr. Koontz goes to Chi
cago his position of general freight
agent in Topeka will undoubtedly be
filled by another Topeka man, R. G.
Merrick, who is at the present time
assistant. There are three other as
sistants, F. C. Maegly of Chicago, F.
H. Manter and C. W. Cook of Topeka.
There are also two general freight
agents from other lines of the Santa
Fe who are eligible to the Topeka
position. " . ' "

TWO CENTS.
THE GAS RUNS LOW
Manager Issued a Warning to
Consumers.
Pressure Has Been Going Down
Slnee Noon. .
TRELEAVEN PUZZLED.
Unable to Offer Explanation of
the Shortage.
Left This Afternoon to Inves
tigate the Situation. .
At 10 o'clock this morning L. G.
Treleaven, manager of the Consumers'
Light, Heat & Power company In this
city, issued a warning that there would
be a shortage of the gas supply this
ufternoon and tonight.' Efforts were
being made all morning to secure more
gaa for Topeka but the pressure waa
going down steadily and there waa no
promise that the situation would be re
lieved by the supply of more gaa.
Mr. Treleaven felt the situation
keenly, especially In view of the fact
teat, believing the assurances he has
had that there would be plenty of gas
this winter, he has so declared. He
will leave tonight for the gas fields
and make a personal Investigation of
conditions there.
"You may rest assured," said he,
rJK,as 80011 as I can learn anything
I will let Topeka people know It I
am as much at a loss to know what
to do as anyone. We have been told
fcd along that there would be plenty
oi gas this winter. If the Kansas
Natural Gas company would only fur
nish us the gas we could deliver it.
They are supposed to furnish us the
gas at the city limits. We can't give It
ut when we don't get It. I don't
know why we do not get the gas any
more than you do.
"We are pinched for gas this after
noon an" will be tonight I believe.
Something may happen to avert this
lut I do not expect it The only
reason I can give you for this is that
the pressure here Is going down all
;he time. I am trying to get Kansas
City by wire and get south from there
and learn what is the matter.
"It is a thankless Job. We operate
rere during the summer at the loss
cf $100 per day. Then we get a spell
of weather when we could sell some
gas, when the people would use it and
:he Kansas Natural people fail to sup
ply us. Then we have to bear the
brunt."
Mr. Treleaven said this morning that
tnere was a shortage of gas last night
between 6 and 8 o'clock but that the
pressure-was normal early this morn
ing. He did not care to discuss th-j
matter early today because he is pre
paring "to leave for the gas fields and
ascertain true conditions for himself.
In commenting upon the shortage of
gas this morning Mr. Treleaven denied
the report that -the gas company has
more than reached the limits of consumers-who
can be supplied with gas
with the present system. He declared
50 per cent more meters could be in
stalled and the people supplied with gas
provide-' the gas was forthcoming. H
declared the 12 inch main which brings
the gas from Haskell here is large
enough to carry gas for a 50 per cen
increased consumption.
Why the gas is not to be had is th
question the people would like answered
and Mr. Treleaven declares there Is no
one who wants to know this more tha.i
himself. It is for this purpose that ho
will make the trip south. It does seem
rather strange for the gas company to
go on making new connections when It
can not supply the customers it has.
Last night there were many com
plaints of poor gas pressure. While the
pressure may have been normal at th-j
supply station It was not over the clt7.
In the residence districts the ga
burned feebly in lights and stoves until
well towards midnight. At that time it
became a little stronger but this morn
ing there were more complaints of a
short supply of gas. And these com
plaints were not in outlying districts
but in the down town residence section.
At this time the cold was most severe.
At 1 o'clock today Mr. Treleaven
said : i
,. "We are beginning to feel the
pinch. This wilt continue. I don't
know just hdw bad it will be. We
will not go out but we are going to
be badly pinched for gas, and people
living on the outskirts will be badly
in. need of gas. I am hoping for the
be3t, but I know that we will be badly
in need of gas in Topeka until, prob
ably, late tonight."
When told that telephone messages
reported plenty of gas at Lawrence
and Ottawa. Mr, Treleaven said these
towns would have plenty of gas as
long as Topeka had any gas at all. .
There will be do difficulty at either
place, he declared until the gas had
gone completely out here.
"We get only the surplus from these
towns," he said. "As long as we get .
any we can rest assured that there is
plenty . of gas in Lawrence and
Ottawa. Only when the supply here
fails entirely can they be short of
gas. .
"Kansas City, . St. Joseph or Atch
ison would be more likely to be short
of gas than either Lawrence or
Ottawa. They arc 'dead end towns
the same as we are." .
Mr. Treleaven left at 1:35 o'clock
for Kansas City, on his way to the
Kansas gas fields.
