well known "Vashington Hotel property,
in the lower end of the borough, of Mr.
.lacob Hicstand, and will take possession
in the Spring. The Washington has al
ways been a popular hotel, and, wo pre
sume, will lose nothing of its popularity
under the new landlord. i
The Chief Justiceship.
The President has appointed the Hon.
Salmon P. Chase, late Secretary of the
Treasury, to the chief seat in the Supreme
Court of the United States. The new
Chief Justice will bring to the Bench
eminent legal attainments, and those va
ried qualities of head and heart which
cannot fail to make the popular Judge,
and to show the wisdom of the President's
selection. The nomination was sent to
the Senate on Monday, and was immedi
ately confirmed, without reference to the
Judiciary. This was done in courtesy
to Mr. Chase, who was. formerly, a mem-:
her of the Senate.
The citizens of Stroudsburg had the
pleasure last Wednesday Eve. of listening
to Rev. Wm. B. Marsh, Agent of the U-
nited States Sanitary Commission. Af-
tr his address clearly stating the designs,
the workings, and the needs'or the Com
mission, the ladies preseut, organized an
Aid Society, cs auxiliary to the Commis
sion. The following are its officers,
President, Mrs. ROBERT PITTS,
Treasurer, Mrs. SAMUEL DREHER,
Soc'y, Miss CAROLINE MILLER,
With five Directors.
The object of the Society is to secure
and make further garments, stores, aud
all kiuds of Hospital supplies. We be
speak for the Society the benevolence
and co-operation of all.
The Society will meet every Saturday
afternoon in the Seminary, where it will
be glad to meet any of the ladies who de
sire to work in the good cause, and to re
eeivc coatributious from the benevolent.

Queer.
Not knowing ibt difference .between mere
pot-houee political partisanship andrUrue p&
triotism, the Squire' thought ihe5$6 listen
ing to a political sermon, at the JRwe byterian
onurcn, on manHssiyimr day. -lie never
was more mistaken in a supposition in his
life. The clergyman who officiated, the
Rev. Mr.'Evcritt, is anything but a pohti
cian and is. nrohablv. the last maU who
, r , v.
would undertake to preach a political ser
mon. He doubtless has his views, as every
right-minded man has, on the relative mer
its of parties in this country ; but we have yet
to hear of his first attempt to intrude thoBe
views upon his friends with whom he comes
in daily contact, much lc6s upon a congrega
tion, composed, as he well knows, of men
with opposing opinions. The Rev. gentle
man, on the occasion referred to, felt it to be
his duty to impress upon- his hearers the
necessity for thankfulness and for earnest
prayer, and in the course of his remarks gave
abundant reasons why the necessity should
be. acceded to. His offense had this extent
and no more.
The Democratic papers have hardly yet
got through publishing Bishop Hopkins's po
litical tirade in favor of Slavery, which they
periodically applaud to the skies. But not
withstanding this, with a queer kind..of con
sistency for which they are noted, they do
not hesitate to attempt to pull any and every
clergyman to pieces, who has independence
lough to think and act as though the ac
complishment of the work of his Divine
Master was of more importance than the
opinions of men. Low indeed must the mor
als of Democracy be sunk, when its leaders
can see nothing in good but a ghoul to harrow
up their souls. If in their experience they
have no cause for thankfulness, they certainly
have much cause for prayer that the good
God will open their eyes to the evils sur
rounding them, their ears to the calm recep
tion of the burning truths of His Gospel,
ana their understandings to the right appli
cation of those truths.

The Second Session of the Thirty-Eighth

A noteworthy Fact.
You can always tell from the advertis
ing columns of a newspaper who do the
largest business and sell the cheapest.
The.busiuess men gifted with enterprise
and industry, having goods to sell, will
strive to outstrip competitors, and inform
the public through the press what he has
for sale. This is so, and if our readers
wish to test the fact for themselves, let
them make a note on their next shopping
tour of the difference to be noticed be
tween the establishments of advertising
and non-advertising firms. There will
be found evidences of thrift, indications
of prosperity in the advertising firm, a
"snap1' and a wide awake air about the
employers and clerks, in striking contrast
with dull, plodding ways of the ''old
fogies," who don't "waste" money in
advertising. If purchasers wish to jcuow
where they will find the choicest goods
end the newest styles, they will carefully
study the advertisiug columns of their
home paper.
Mr, F. A. Dony, tho editor of the
Hawley Free Press, an intensely disloyal
paper
was drafted about two weeks ago.
The following is a portion of tho oration
he delivered upon the occusion' in the
next issue of his paper:
"Wo are not legally drafted. We
known it, and it is not unknown to Mr.
rohe.
"Such being the case, if Mr. Yohe
attempts, without further notice, to set a
pack of the refuse of the bar-room and
the bachaealia upon our trail, as sure as
we have life, we will call upon the people
for protection, and with our eyes toward
Heaven, and fervent prayer to Almighty
God to attest the sincerity of o.ur purpose,
we'll fire the first gun of a Northern Rev
olution." In defiance of all this cas. Mr. Dony
was arrested at his residence in Cherry
Rid-ie, on Monday night, by tico of the
attaches of the Provost Marshal s office.
at this place, and taken to Easton. No
resistance was offered. Perhaps his for-
ces were demoralized, by the capture of
their leader, or his gun was out of order,
but more likely he was carryiug out his
well-kuown peace principles. Honesdale

Copperheads Come' to Grief.
John Rantz, ring.-leader of the Co
lumbia G.ounly Conspiracy to resist the
draft, and Samuel Kline and William Ap
pieman,, co-adjutors in the same w.ork,
were recently tried by a military com
mission at Harrisburg and found guilty.
The -sentences, which have been approved
by Gen. Couch, commandant ot this De
partment, are as follows: John Rantz
is to pay a fine of $1,000. and to be im
prisoned 2 years in Fort Mifflin. Sam
ule Kline is sentenced to two years im
prisonment in Fort Mifflin. William
Appleman is fined $500 and is to be im
prisoned in Fort Mifflin until the fine is
paid, provided such imprisonment shall
not continue longer than a year.

The Princeton (N. J.) Standard says:
"The night before the electionIn ,
of Cranberry, in one of the hotels, said :
"If Abraham Lincoln is reelected, i hope
my soul may be dragged down to h 1."
These were his last words ; he instantly
fell off his chair, and died the next morn
ing. The Belvidere (N. J.) Intelligencer
adds : "We learn that a person in this
county was so enraged at the re-election
of Mr. Lincoln, that he declared he
wduld sell his property and ''drihk it up.
Thatafternodu he was! seized with palsy,
and the next morning he was a corpse.

Eclipses.
Next year there will be four eclipses
two of the sun and two of the moon.
The eclipses of the sun occur on the 25th
of April and the 15th of October; those
of the moon on the 11th of April and the
3d of October.
A fight occurred at a place called Tim

Pennsylvania, on Friday, between a lot
of deserters and Company F of the 201st

lasted for about an hour, the soldiers driv

wounding two of them. The remainder
escaped.

Ayer's Cathartic Pills
ARE the moat perfecLpurgatite which we
are able to produce or which v.e think
has ever been made by any body. I heir ef
fects have abundantly shown to the commu
nity how much they excel the ordinary med-
tcines in use. They arc sate and pleatant
to take, but powerful to cure. 1 heir pene
trating properties stimulate the vital activi
ties ot the body, remove the oDsirucuon 01
its organs, punly the bloud, and expel dis
ease. They purge out the foul humors which
breed and grow distemper, stimulate alugi&h
or disordered organs into heir natural action,
aud impart a healthy tone with strength to
the whole system. Not only do they cuth
the every-d:iy complaints of everybody, but
also formidable and dangerous diseases.
While they produce powerful effects, they
are ut the same time, in diminished doces,
the safest niid best physic that can be em
ployed lor children. Being sugar-coated,
they arc pleasunt to take; and being purely
vegetable, are free from any risk of harm.
Cures have been made which surpass belief,
were Ihey not substantiated by men of such
exalted position and character, na to forbid
the suspicion of untruth. Many emineni
clerirvmen and ohysicinns have lent their
named to certify to the public the reliability
ol our remedies, wmie outers nu e sent ui
the assurance of their conviction that, our
Preparations contribute immeoeely to the re
lief of our afflicted, suffering fellow rucn.
The aient below named h pleated to fur
nibh grttlid our American Almanac, contain
ing directions for the use and certificates ol
their cilres, ol the following complaints:
Cotivcness, Billions Complaints, Rheuma
tism, Dropsy, Heartburn, Headache arising
from foul stomach, .Nausea, indigestion. Mor
bid inaction of the Bowels and Pain nriiijr
therefrom, Flatulency, loas of Appetite, all
Diseases which requircan evacuanl medicine.
They also, by purifying the blood and stimu
lating the sytem,cure many complaints which
it would not be supposed they could reach,
such as Deafness, Partial Blindness, Neural
gia and Nervous Irritability, Derangements
ot the Liver and Kidneys, Gout, and other
kindred complaints arising from a low alute
of the body, or obstruction nf its functions.
Do not be put off by unprincipled dealers
with other preparations which they make
more profit on. Demand Ayer's and take
no others. The sick want lhe beat aid there
is for them, and they should havo it.
