CLOSE ON HIS HEELS
Four Hours' Fight With Aguinaldo's
Guar2. '
LATE YICES FRON GENERAL OTIS
Uprising in Negros is of Small
Account
ON TIIE WAY TO MANILA
Gen. Otis has made the following report
of the latest military operations in the
Philippines:
"MANILA, December 9, 1899.
"Adjutant General Washington:
"A dispatch from Young, Vigan, yester
day says that escaped Spanish prisoners re
port a four-hours' engagement on the 3d
instant between his troops and Aguinaldo's
guard near Cervantes. fifty miles southeast
of Vigan, with heavy loss to the enemy,
who is being pursued. Our loss was one
killed, six wounded. The inhabitants of
their own accord join the troops in repair
ing the trail and in carrying subsistence.
Have pushed the column to San Jose, south
of Bangued. Howse's column Is on rear
trail; Batchelor's battalion of the 24th is
out of reach, north of Bayonbong, evident
ly descending the river. The natives re
port that fighting occurred twenty miles
north. The navy reaches -parri tomorrov.
A column of MacArthur's troops, 23th In
fantry, reported near Iba, west coast Zam
bales; Grant's column is near Subig bay;
Lawton is in Bullucan province today ,with
sufficient troops to overcome upposifion and
scatter the enemy. OTIS."
In the following message Gen. Otis shows
that the reported revolt In Negros does not
amount to much:
"MANILA, December 9, 1899.
"Adjutant General. Washington:
"Information Is received that the Negros
revolt is of minor Importance; Byrnes is In
rapid pursuit of the disaffected party;
Hughes is in the mountains of Panay, en
route to Capiz. OTIS."
The Thomas at Colonbo.
The quartermaster general has received
word that the troopship Thomas oil the
way to Manfla arrived at Colombo this
morning, and will leave that port tomor
row for Singapore. The Thomas left New
York November 2, and carries the 47th

&hree troopships taking reinforcements to
the Philippines by the transatlantic route.

Brooklyn Gains on the New Orleans.
It now looks as if the cruiser Brooklyn
would beat the cruiser New Orleans after
all in the race for Manila. According to
advicets - ' ed at the Navy Department
the Bro,klyn arrivid at Singapore on the
7th instant, and so ar as known the New
Orleans has not yet reached that point.
Both boats were at Colombo at the same
time, and the Brooklyn left that port one
day ahlad of the New Orleans, Up to that
time the New Orleans had been gradually
gaining on her bulkier rival. She started
from the United SLates flve days later than
the Brooklyn, and on leaving Colombo was
but one day beh:nd. It has been suggested
that the officers of the Brooklyn were not
aware that the.New Orleans was endeavor
ing to overtake them until that vessel ap
peared in the harbor of Colombo. and that
they then decided to putt the big cruiser on
her mettle. The run from Singapore will
he the last lap on the trip, as the vessels
will no! stop again until they reach Ma
nila.
The Manmuense Returning.
Gen. Otis reports that the Manauense,
which had such a rough passage from San
Francisco to Manila, has started on the
homeward voyage. This fact satisfies offi
cials of the department that the condition
of the vessel has been misrepresented and
that she is perfectly seaworthy.

The surgeon general argues that as the
existing medical organization was Insuf
ficient for the army of 25,000 men on a
peace basis, it is manifestly inadequate to
the largely increased, army and the many
additional garrisons, including those in
Porto Rico. in Alaska and in the Hawaiian
Islands, to say nothing of the future medi
cal needs of the army in the Philippines.
Even with the increased number of medical
officers provided for in the proposed bill.
he says, it will still be necessary for many
years to come to employ a considerable
number of contract surgeons to meet the
requirements of the service.
Mr. Gonpers Better.
President Gompers of the Federation of
Labor, who was injured in a bicycle acci

to leave here Sunday night for Detroit to

AT THE WHITE HOUSE
Three Republican Leaders at the
Executive Mansion.
NEITYERI NA INALCHA IANSHIP
President Petitioned to Intervene
in the Transvaal.
CALTFORNIANS AND TARIEF
At the White House today were three
men, one of whom will manage the republi
can campaign next year. They were Sen
ator Hanna. looking well, but showing
some effects of rheumatism; Henry C.
Payne. the republican national committee
man from Wisconsin. and Representative
Dick of Ohio. Senator Hanna and Mr.
Payne went to the Executive Mansion to
gether, a basis for further suspicion that
Mr. Payne will succeed the Ohio political
general in handling the republican end of
the next big contest.
When asked about retiring from the man
agement of the campaign next year, Mr.
Hanna repeated the statement made in a
recent interview: "No one is authorized to
say what I will do." said the senator. but
he stopped at these carefully chosen words,
and nothing could induce him to commit
himself one way or the other.
Close friends of the senator say that he
will do next year the same work for th.'
republican party that he did three years
ago. If he is physically able he will be
President McKinley's choice, and that is
what settles the selection of a chairman.
Judge Ewart Calls.
Senator Pritchard was at the White
House with several North Carolinians,
among them Judge Ewart. Judge Ewart
was originally selected for the bench be
cause President McKinley had known and
liked him when they were in the House to
gether. Senator Pritchard favored another
candidate. but when he saw the President's
desire he withdrew his own candidate and
has since supported Judge Ewart. who has
been twice nominated. The question now
is whether the President will again send
Judge Ewart's name to the Senate. Al
though it can be claimed that the Senate
has not directly voted on the case the
President has no desire to put himself in
antagonism to that body.
The effort now being made is to show the
President that if the name is again sent in
Judge Ewart will be confirmed. many sen
ators having offered to support him who
have heretofore held aloof.
Another matter soon to be presented to
the President is a petition signed by the
attorneys of Judge Ewart's district. Every
attorney, except eight, in the forty-seven
ecunties of the district have signed a peti
tion asking that Judge Ewart be continued
on the bench. This petition is to be pre
sented to Senator Marion Butler. who has
led the fight in the Senate against Judge
Ewart.
Judge Ewart will cntinue to hold court
1,ntil a successor Is appointed, or until the
end of the present term of Congress. H he
is to remain on the bench longer than the
end of this Congress he will have to be
nominated again.
For Peace in the Transvaal.
Senator Burrows of Michigan presented
to the President an elabourtely prepared
petition asking that the chief executive
tender the good offices of the United States
in the settlement of the difficulty between
great Britain and the two South African
republics. The petition is signed by a com
mittee representing Hollanders of Michigan.
There are thousands of Hollanders in that
state, and they are all deeply interested in
the contest now waging. They recently held
a giganti' meeting and appointed a commit
tee to present suitable resolutions to the
President. He stated in his message that had
"circumstances suggested that the parties
to the quarrel would have welcomed .any
kindly expression of the hope of the Ameri
can people that war might be aerted" the
good offices of the United States would
have been tendered. The petition will be
referred to the State Department, but no
action will be taken.
Californians and the Tariff.
Senator Perkins and the republican and
democratic members of the House from
California talked with President McKinley
this morning about reciprocity treaties,
which, they feared, may encroach upon
California interests. The particular treaty
touched upon was that recently negotiated
with Jamaica. Mr. Daniels, a represen
tative of the Los Angeles board of trade
and chamber of commerce, submitted to
the President the views of those organiza
tions, which handle the interests of the
fruit growers and wine makers of southern
California. Mr. Daniels said that the
growers of citrous fruits do not fear that
the treaty with Jamaica will affect their
Interests now, but the fear is that the
tieaty may open the door to other treaties
which may prove injurious.
The President assured the delegation
that the members would be consulted rela
tive to future treaties bearing upon fruits.
This'was entirely satisfactory to all con
cerned.
A Judge for Alaska.
Senator Foster of Washington talked to
the President about affairs in Alaska. Judge
Johnston, the only federal representative
of the judiciary In Alaska, has resigned,
his health having braken under the strain
of overwork. He will serve until a suc
cessor is nominated. Senator Foster will
present a candidat!. Senator Foster says
that Congress will be compelled to enact
some laws for Alaska, among which must
be one providing for two judges, two dis
tricts and two different sets of court offi
clals. This is one of the recommendatioes
made by Presi4ent McKinley.
Other Callers and Their Business.
Senator Daniel called to ask the appoint
ment of C. B. Taylor as a lieutenant in
the Marine Corps. The President gave Mr.
Taylor a card directing his designation for
examination,
Senators Morgan and Pettus called to
look after the interests of a constituent
who is In trouble, Senator Morgan says he
is going "to do his best" to secure action
on the Nicaraguan canal at this session.
Senator Spooner went to the White House
with his future colleague. Senator Quarles,
one of the new men in the Senate. They
paid their respects.
-Among other callers were Senators Baker.
Proctor. Hale. Nelson, Bate. Fairbanks and
Warren. and Representatives Lacey, Cueh
man, Lanham, Prince and Overstreet.
Senor Quesada called with Gen. Demetrio
(Castilio Duany and Richard Dias Aibertin.
General Duany is civil governor of the pro
vince of Santiago, Cuba. He talked with
the President tep minutes sboot the wishes
and needs of the Cuban people, and thanked
,the President for the tenor of his mnethage.
Senator Scott of Weat Virginia and Rep
resentative Br'omweli of Ohio called to urge
the promotion of Colonel Burt of the 25th
Infantry to be a brigadier general. Colonel
Burt retires soon, and h's friends desire
his promotion before that event. Senator<
Scott is working hard to secure the pro
motion.

GEN. AINSWORTH'S REPORT.
Recommends a Reduction In i"
Force of Thirty-Two Clerk*.
The annual report of Gen. F. C. Aina
worth, chief of the record and pension of
ffiee of the War Department, shows that
the enormous business of the office has
been promptly dispatched. More than
ninety-six per cent of the cases received
during the fiscal year. aggregating 18-.01.
were disposed of within twenty-four hours
from the time they reached the office, and
not one case remained unacted upon at the
close of business hours at the end of the
fiscal year. These cases related to the ser
vices of volunteer forces of the United
States during the revolutionary war, the
war of 1812, the various Indian wars, the
war with Mexico. th. war of the rebellion,
and the more recent Stii:ish war. By the
reproduction of the - s of individual
military service by ti;.x record card
system the applicatio of that system to
the current correspondcnc.. and the adop
tion of other improved methods, the busi
ness of the office has been greatly expedited
and it has been possilbl.. to materially re
duce the clerical force. ()n the recommen
dation of the chief of the' office, a reduction
of 314) was made in the clerical force in
14. a further reduction of fifty was made
in 1KI!5, and a stilt further reduction of
twenty-five in P17. In the ,timates sub
mitted by Gen. Ainsworth, for the coming
fiscal year, a still furtlr reduction of
thirty-two is provided for, naking a total
reduction of 47 clerks. repr'senting a per
manent saving of over $461UM11 annually, in
the appropriations for the clerical force of
the office. Adding to this the saving ef
fected in contingent and other expenses.
It is shown that the cost of maintaining
the office has been . Pernianetitly reduced
by fully $t10,000 annually. Gen. Ainsworth
says that in all of the reductions that have
been made in the clerical force of the office
the selections for discharge have been
based strict'y upon the efficiency records
of the clerks, a liberal allowance being
made in the ratings on account of honor
aile military or naval service.
CAPITOL CHIM.MEVS.
Nearly a Hundred Seattered Oser the
Rig Roof.
The chimneys of the Capitol are one of
the unique features of the city. Distribut
ed over the large area of roof which covers
the big structure are nearly a hundred
chimneys. They were built in the dais
when heating was secured from open grate
fires and they have always been the soum cC
of much annoyance. Strangely enough.
although the Capitol stands on a high hill
ard is surrounded by a great park, these
chimneys have been noted chiefly for their
failure to "draw," and whenever a high
and shifting wind has prevailed there has
been a tendency for them to fill committee i
rooms with a volume of smoke and to scat
ter wood ashes over the floor and furniture.
It was to reduce the annoyance arising
from this defect that cannel coal was in
troduced. hot that could not remedy the
"smoky" features of the chimneys. In the
old days when there was plain furniture
and little frescoing the dust and smoke
were not so destructive as they became
when more elegance crept into the com
mittee rooms of the Senate end of the Cap
itol.
For many years the architect of the
Capitol struggled with this problen and
each chimney was experimented on sepa
rately, and now they iepresent a great va
riety in height and general appearance be
cause of the patented fixtures with which
they have been provided. By one means or
another the difficulty with the chImneys
has very largely been met, and today they
are comparatively under control. One in
genious device has lately been introduced
which effectively prevents the wind from,
blowing down the chimneys. It is a con
trivance whereby strong currents of wind
blowing down galvanized iron pipes sur
mounting the brick chimney is allowed to
escape before it enters the brick chimney.
and this device has corrected some of the
most troublesome cases. Gradually the
Capitol has had furnace heat introduced in
nearly all its parts, but there are some
places where open grate fires are depended
on to warm rooms. As a rule the open
grates are retained as luxuries rather than
necessities.
CROWDING OUT THE SILVER ISSUE.
Mr. Sibley on the Increasing Volume
of Gold Produetion.
The free silver people are much disturbed
over the attitude assumed with regard to
the money question by Representative
Sibley of Pennsylvania. who was heretofore
one of their chief apostles of free silver.
Those who he'ard his declaration at the
Newlands dinner, though there was some
ambiguity about it. generally agreed that
the drift of It was that the silver question
was being crowded out of its important
place by the abundant production of gold,
and that there would in the future be a
still larger Increase in the volume of gold
production.

plest manner. The majority opinion of
Commissionf'rs Pryor and Ellis and the mi

were not read. as was the original inten

to the offlev of the clerk in the state su

Few Persoma Present.
There was no crowd around the buildit.g
and no interest was manifested in the work
save by those engaged in it. The three
commiseioners were all apparenti in good
humor, although Commissioners EiN and
Pryor. who had done the motl work in
preparing their long and elaborate optiniont.
looked worn and tired. The certiricates, a&
soon as signed. were filed with the secre
lary of state, and commissions will be iW
sutd to the successful candidates at once
by Gov. Bradley. Late last night. when the
decision had gone forth to, the public. Comt
missioner Ellis, upon whose shoulders the
greatest part of the work of preparing the
opinin has falleti. discused the mattev
froelv.
"This las been a hard thing for moo" he
said. his eyes inflamed by loss of sleep and
the ieavy lfies in his face hearing eIo
quenti witness to the truth of his state
mnt. -It has been a hard thing for, all of
its. I wish, however, that the peoop'e of
the country should know how nobly Judge
Pryor has acted in this matter and how
conscitmtiously he has done what he con
sidered his duty, He is a great man, one of
the greatest. In my opinion, that Kentucky
has v,-r produced.
Mr. El' 1View of the Matter.
'Speaking for myself," Mr. Ellis added.
"I say frankly I did not like to do tils
thing. but under the law and the evidence
there is nothing else I can do and be ant
honest man."
"The proceedings before the board were
so overwhelmingly in favor of the republi
cans, and they had so much the better of
the arguments. that it is almost idle to
discuss the affair. There was, to the minds
of Judge Pryor and myself only on-' thing
to do, and that we have done. I know
there are plenty of men who think that
strong democratic partisan as I have Atl
ways been. I should have remained a dmo
cratic partisan and voted otherwise. But I
have donie what my conscience and my
long career as a lawyer tell me It- right,
and t will do otherwis" for no man. or
upon no consideration."
Mr. Goebel Deellaes to Tal
Mr. Goebel was apparently in the bIe of
humor after being told that Mr Taylor a
oertificate had been signed. He laughed
and shook his head when asked if be had
anything to say.
"Not i thing; I am not talking."
"Wh-tn will you mak' a contest?
"I have rot decided yet, and .uf -o ,
,annot diosuss when I do not know it my
self."
The defeat-i candilate was game to !he

as modest and reticent as usual.
"t 'xtected it. of course." he said. '1
