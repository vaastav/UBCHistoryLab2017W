Balfour and the BI1L.
Loroox, November 29. In the house of
commons Mr. Balfour, chief secretary of
Ireland, introduced the Irish land bill. He
said the government policy was the same as
in 1889. But for simplicity, the bill bad been
cut in half. Both portions, however, were
practically the same as in the bill of 1839.
Among other changes embodied in the new
bill, one had reference to the objection taken
at the last session to a limit of twenty years
purchase then proposed. That limit did not
appear in the new bill. Cries of "Hear,
hear!" Further power would be given the
viceroy to extend the period of five years,
during which 8 per cent, of the purchase
money wa3 payable. In regard to increasing
the powers of the local authorities, Mr. Bal
four said that he considered the original pro
posals therefor in the bill were the best that
could be devised. Land purchase in Ireland
was not a local question, at all. The govern
ment was using the British credit to
carry out this vital reform, not primarily, for
the benefit of this country, or that, but for the
bene tit of the empire as a whole. Conserv
ative cheers. Another consideration is the
fact that the land question in Ireland was
largely used for political objects. It would
be absurd, therefore, to leave to communi
ties under the excitement of agitators to de
termine whether they should adopt a remedy
f;oing to the root of agrarian discontent.
Parnellite laughter-1 If they were to give
local control in any form, it ought to be by
a plebscite of rate nay, or enabling them
under the safeguard of the ballot to vote
ojon the question of granting a contingent
portion of the guarantee fund for each county.
Mr. Labouchere moved an amendment
against pledging the imperial credit for the
Eurchase of land until the country should
ave given its consent at a general election.
The amendment was rejected by a Tote of
268 to 117.
Mr. Gladstone. Sir William Vernon Har
court and Mr. Morely walked out before the
vote was taken.
' "riom Rynn's Wort In Mexico.
tVAsmxGTON, D. C, November 28. Minis
ter Ryan is coming back from Mexico. He
got leave of absence to visit Kansas, but there
is reason to believe he will come to "Washing
ton, and that his trip has something of a diplo
matic nature.
A year ago Minister Ryan came to Wash
ington to lay before the treasury department
the impolicy of making a ruling discriminat
ing against the importation of Mexican lead
ores. He showed that the United States
would be the greater sufferer, as it would in
evitably invite retaliation on the part of
Mexico, aud might alao help to transfer
smelting industries across the border.
The ruling, however, was made and it was
followed by a stringent provision in the Mc
Kinley tarirf bill. The carbonate mine own
ers in the United States have not yet gotten
rich by the discrimination in their favor, and
Mexico has managed to smelt a good many
of its ores at home.
Now a new tariff bill is preparing. Wnat
its provisions are is kept secret. But reci
procity is in the air. In spito of all they say
about the discourteous treatment given them
when the house of representatives refused to
make effective the Grant reciprocity treaty
of 1S83, the Mexicans still want enlarged
commercial relations with the United States.
They want to encourage sugar production
in the sugar producing belt of their country.
They can do this only by having a free mar
ket in the United States assured them.
Inall probabdity Mr. Ryan brings, along
the draft of a reciprocity treaty which wiil
be submitted to the senate this winter. In
return for free sugar it will insure the Mexi
can market for the farm products of the
United States, particularly live stock, and
also will be to the gain of manufacturers.
Farmers Can't Afford to Feel Corn.
Kashas Ctjt, Mo., November 29. John
Nesbitt, general live stock agent for the
Alton, is in the city. "There are not many
fat cattle west of here now," Mr. Xesbitt
said. "Shipments are rather light now, and
the season for heavy lots of cattle to come in
is past. The range cattle have nearly nil been
marketed, and there are very few fat ones in
Kansas to selL Corn is worth too much to
make it profitable to feed it to cattle at pres
ent prices. The exporters will find it diffi
cult this winter to supply the foreign de
mand for fat cattle. Corn is now in Kansas,
say, 40 cents a bushel; it would be impossible
to get it for less. It takes seventy bushels to
fatten a steer or $28. The work of feeding
is worth certainly H more. The steer, as
native feeders are now selling, at 2X22Jic,
would cost, say $27.50, 6uch cattle weighing
on an average 1,000 pounds. Good feeding
will put about 300 pounds on the animal, and
the feeder can sell it for 3 cents a pound.
The animal cost altogether $0 and brings
only $65. Too see that is not worth the
trouble.
"I was in Chicago three days this week,
and during that time the receipts of cattle at
the stock yards were 65,000 head; of that
number there were not 2,000 good cattle.
There axe about 6,000 head in the stock yards
here, and I will venture that there axe not
EDO good fat cattle in the number.

CozxncBix, S. C, November 29. A tele

tnink it will be a good thine but it isiiotyet

new and strontr association, succeeding the
present Western Railroad association, to give-
a distribution of territory in wnicn eacn roaa
is .represented. Stockholders most assert
themselves. It i all right when their divi
dends are paid. The stockholders are quiet,
but when the financial returns are not forth
coming there will be an overturn, just as in
a national elfcbon when times are bad there
will be a change. A very d'ght advance
in rates and a union of traffic offices will
make a big difference to railroad stockhold
ers. There are railroads enough in the wesU
era country for the next five years. We
want now to intelligently develop the coun
try and have it grow up to the capacity of
the roads without ruining shareholders by
competitive rates, which are an advantage to
nobody."
Nearly 1,000 Bushels of Potatoes on On
Acre.
Nrw Yosr, November 29. The most mar
velous achievements in crop raising erei
known is the result of competition, in whict
farmers all over the country have joined tht
past season, to win prizes which were offered
by the American Agriculturist. So extraor
dinary have been the yields obtained by sev
eral competitors that the result seems tc
signify almost a revolution in the scientific
practice of agriculture and the discovery of
new and priceless secrets of nature's Iabra
tory. To have actually crown 135 bushels oi
oats on one acre, 43,560 square feet; 738$
bushels of potatoes on one acre, eighty bush
els of wheat on one acre, and 225 bushels of
shelled corn within the limits of one acre,
wa3 the magnificent total of the Agriculturist
crop competition of 1&&. In each class these
were the largest crops ever grown on one
acre.
The winner of the first prize i3 William J.
Sturgis, of Buffalo, Johnson county, Wyo.
His acre of potatoes yielded 974 bushels.
The crop was crown on virgin soil, without
manure or fertilizer, but the land was rich in
P-sash, and the copious irrigation was of
water also rich in saline material. There
were 22,800 sets on one acre and 1.560 pounds
of sets containing one, two and three eyes
were planted of the early Vermont and Man
hattan varieties. The profit on the crop on
this first prize acre was $714, exclusive of
$500 in prizes. The yield described is, of
course, phenomenal, but the natural condi
tions were also, to say the least, unnatural.
Andersonnlle a C A. K. National Post.
Macos; Ga., November 29. The site of
the old Andersonviile prison is now the prop
erty of E. S. Jones post, G. A. R., of Macon.
Commander L D. Norford, of Jones post,
has returned . from Americus, where the
formal transfer of the p'roperty was made.
The purchased negotiations for which were
begun a year ago, included eighty acres of
land on which were located the stockade,
fortitfications, rifle pits, eta. of the historic
prison. The land was bought from George
Kennedy, a negro, and the purchase price was
$1,500. In thirty days the work of convert
ing the site into a national G. A. R. post will
be begun. The money for this purpose has
already been contributed by G. A. R. men in
Georgia and elsewhere. The purchase will
be surrounded by a 100 feet driveway and
wide avenue, which will lead to the railroad
station. Walks, drives, fountains and bed3
of flowers and rare shrubs and berries will
be plentiful, and in the center of it an eleva
tion will be erected also an elegant club
house for the use of members of the G. A. R.
and their guests. Each point ofspecial in
terest will be marked by a suitable monu
ment or building, and at Providence Spring
a building will be erected for the holding of
decoration exercises. The superintendent,
J. M. Bryant, of the Andersonville national
cemetery, will overlook the work.
Population Flsjnres.
Washtsgtos, D. C, November 29. Super
intendent Porter has concluded his final de
termination of the population statistics of
the country. The total differs by 141,710
from that .contained in the bulletin issued
from the census bureau on October 28. This
change is due to the correction of errors of
what is termed the first or rough count, and
the addition of names ascertained to have
been omitted from the enumeration. The
verified population of the United states in
1890 is 62,622,250.
The German Floods.
Bekus, November 29. The medicinal

From the leadership or the Na

Chicago, December L The Tribune spe
cial cablegram from London says it now
seems certain that Parnell will not retire
from the leadership of the Irish party, no
matter what pressure may' be brought to
bear upon him. Gladstone's position, thus
becomes mora difficult thn ever.
It is (mite possible Gladstone will announce
the impossibility of carrying the home rule
scheme any farther during his lifetime nd
propose a union of his party on the basis of
the old radical program, leaving Ireland cut
altogether.
This would force nearly all the liberal dis
sentients back into the ranks, and leave the
conservatives in a minority and liable to be
turned out of office.
Loxdox. The manifesto which Mr. Par

questions involved in the present political
crisis, is made public
Jt definitely settles that Mr. Parnell will
not voluntarily retire from the leadership of
the Irish parliamentary party. The mani
festo is of great length, and sets forth why,
in Mr. Parnell's opinion, it would be disas
trous to the best interests of the party for
him to withdraw at the present time
Mr. Parnell defies his political opponents
and appeals to the people of Ireland to sus

Summary of the VTeelc's Trade,
Nzw Yoke. December 2. R. G. Dun &
Cc's weekly review of trade says:
The past week has not improved the busi
ness outlook. The difficulty of obtaining
commercial loans increases. Leaders appear
to have been induced by recent events to
strengthen themselves. Merchants are mora
cauti us about extending obligations or
maki g any but necessary purchases, fear
ing a falling off in the retail trade on ac
count of the extensively reported advance in
prices. Meanwhile speculation has been re
viveu to an unhealthy extent in some airec
hons on the theory that the troubles are over.
The money markets are thus loaded with in
creasing demands for carrying securities and
products at a time when trade especially
needs liberal supplies. In the interior money
is more stringent and the scarcity begins to
affect trade at important centers, though the
volume of trade is very large.
Ire outlook for the great industries is less
clear, but the sceculative markets have been
advancing. Wheat ha risen 6J4, corn 2j,
lard 15, coffee a . Cotton is a sixteenth
lower, and oil 1 cent lower. Breadstuff's are
high r. Tin' is higher, but copper and lead
are a hade weaker.
Th business failures during the last seven
days were 249, against 274 last week, and 249
the same week last y"-5r.
The i'rcseui Presented.
tVASHEfGTOs, D. C, December 2. The
medal which Admiral DeSilveira presented
to President Harrison was made in Rio de
Janeiro upon special order of the govern
ment. It is commemorative of the very
friendly relations existing between the two
repubhes in consequence of our prompt re
cognition of the official existence of the
new born republic The metal is palladium
and gold, the two metals being symbolic re
spectively of Brazil and the United states.
It is about three inches in diameter and
weighs fouiteen and three-quarters ounces.
On one face is an allegorical figure represent
ing Brazil, and a five pointed star, encircled
by a lurel wreath, upon which is incribed
this 1 tto: "Estados Unido Do Brazil, 15 de
Nove ibro de 18S9." The date named is
that which the new republic counts as her
national birthday. Upon the reverse of the
medal is the figure of an American eagle
bearing m its claws the coat-of-arms of the
United States, with branches of oak and
laurel. The eaglo is represented as flying
toward Brazil with an olive branch of peace
in its beak. Around it is the motto: "A
Republica dos Estados Unidos do America."

Losdox, "December 2. Gladstone has is

which he denies in toto the statements made
by the Irish leader in regard to the retention
of th Irish members of the imperial parlia

difficulty in Ireland: tho control of the Irish

Mr. Gladstone then speak3 of the proposals

Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden last November,
in the event of the liberal party winning at

Mr. Gladstone declares that no single sug

creased five million, and the railroad mile
age 11,000,000.
The report recommends the establishmemt
of the postal telegraph and postal savings

The report refers to the efficacy of the lot

During the past two years 14,072 postmas
ters have been removed. The number of
poetoffices is 62,401.
The revenue from letter portage last year
was $38,000,000. One cent letter postage
would cut that revenue in half, but an in
crease in revenue would result from an in
crease of business at the lower rate and
from the completion of legislation to collect
proper postage on sample conies of so-called
newspapers, and? on paper covered books,
the latter of which keeps a $1,000,000 out of
the postal income for the benefit of certain
book publishers. The rcDort recommends
more civil service examinations to keep away
the, political place seekers. The revenues
for the department for the fiscal year, the
report shows, was S60.S5a.7Ki. Th ex
penditure and haoihties were $66,635,083.
Tho deficiency for the year was, therefore,
$5,786,300.
Secretary of the Treasury's Report.
WASHiWGToy, D. O, December 2, The re
port of the secretary of the treasury shows
an increase during twenty years past in all
kinds of money in circulation among the
people of $727,000,000, an increase per capita
from $19.97 to $23.96. During the last ten
years tho average monthly increase was $3.
967,000, and an increase per capita of $3.59.
The increase for eighteen months, from
March 4, 18S9, to October 1, 1890, was $93,
866,813, while there was a decrease for eigh
teen months, from March 4. 1885, to October
1, 1856, of $21,829,493. It is stated that this
large increase since March 4, 1889, is mainly
due to the present policy of keeping the sur
plus as low as possible by the purchase
and redemption of bonds, thereby saving in
terest and restoring the currency to circula
tion, while the large decrease in circulation
for the corresponding period, from March 4,
1835, to October 1, 1883, was due to the oppo
site policy.
Gould Says tho Kansas City Stock Yards
Ha Been Favored.
New Yohe, December 1. The Tribune
prints an interview with Jay Gould, in which
he says President Adams, of the Union Pa
cific, is a theorist who has conducted many
affairs of the Union Pacific without the
I knowledge of the directors. Mr. Gould said
he learned when last m Kansas City that Mr.
Adams personally owned control of the stock
yards there, and that while the railroad was
carrying in their live stock at bare cost of
transportation the stock yards earned $1,000,
000 the past jear. Such action as this, Mr.
Gould said, would never bo permitted under
the new management. He believes that the
Burlincton & Quincy and the Rock Island
will both come into a plan for securing better
results from the western business. No fur
ther changes, he said, were to be made in

Increase of Shipments of Cattle.
Washisgtoit, D. C., December 2. The
work of inspecting cattle for export by the
Jepartment of agriculture is now fairly un
der way. The agents of the bureau of ani
mal industry have, during the past few days,
inspected 6,967 head of cattle. The ports at
which the inspection of these cattle was
made were Boston, New York, Philadelohia,
Baltimore and Newport, the largest number
being shipped from Boston. Since the estab
lishment. August 23, of a system of inspec
tion by American official veterinarians of
all cattle landed in British ports from the
United States, the veterinary officers of the
department of agriculture report the inspec
tion, up to November 8, of 1OJ.00O cattle,
lacking a few head. These figures denote an
increase in shipment of live cattle from this
country to British ports over the very large
shipments of the last fiscal year.
Sew Jlrilcin Indians.
Foet Wrf gate, N. M., December 2 Ru
mors are current here of a probable uprising
among the Navajoe Indians. Numerous set
tlers and ranchera are making inquiries into
the sudden departure of the Sixth cavalry.
Post traders and others report the Indians as
very insolent and overbearing. They are
holding large dances, and it is believed that
the Messiah craze has reached them. They
are even holding their dances near the limits
of the post, being led by the medicine men.
The ranchers are reporting losses of cattle
being killed and horses stolen and their cow
boys attacked. General Carr. through his
long acquaintance with the Indians and his
Indian policy, has held them in check, but
now that the Sixth cavalry has withdrawn,
settlers and citizens are very apprehensive.

sTx-IenSs of tho Measure Claimed Fulfill,

Sees lan Western Senators Deter
mined and TFIa.
"vtASHurGToy, D. CL, December?. The re
publican senators were xi caucus for an hour
and l half, engaged in the consideration of
the order of business. The main topic of
discussion was the national elections bilL
The friends of this measure recalled to their
fellow senators the implied pledge given at
the caucus last session that the bill, if allowed
to go over until the reassembling of con
gress, would be taken up and pressed to a
final vote without the intervention of other
business. They urged that the time had
come to redeem the pledges, and that tho
senators should at once proceed to the con
sideration of the bill. Certain .senators, who
have in the past been set down as opponents
of the elections bill, or who, at least, were
supposed to be lukewarm in its support, ob
jected, not to the general principle of the
bill itself, but to the adoption of a policy
that, in their judgment, would probably re
sult i. blocking all other important legisla
tion Curing the remainder of this congress
without a guarantee of successful termina
tion of the attempt to pass the elections bill.
Several western senators, however, insisted
that with a proper spirit of determination on
the part of the majority the bill could be
passed. After a long discussion the caucus
agreed that the elections bill should be taken
up in the senate with the understanding that
it should be kept before that body until
finally acted upon. Furthermore, to guard
against expected opposition from the demo
cratic minority in the line of dilatory tactics,
a committee of five senafors was appointed
to cooperate with the republican members
of the committee on rules in the preparation
of a rule to secure closure of debate when
desired by the majority. The old caucus
committee on the order of business was re
appoited, and instructed to prepare a pro
gramme to govern the proceedings of the
ienate after the elections bill shall have been
disposed of. It is stated that there was no
votes cast against these determinations of
the caucus.
Opening of the Short Session.
Wahhisgtos, D. C The closing session
of the Fifty-first congress has opened.
The attendance of members was consider
ably larger than is usual on the first day of a
session, although many familiar faces, espe
cially on the republican side were missing,
the fact possibly tending to indicate that
their owners felt less interest in legislation
since the developments of a few weeks since.
Speaker Reed, bright as ever, was on hand
an hour before noon, and there was nothing
in the hearty manner with which he greeted
his friends to indicate that he bad been badly
shaken up in the recent political cyclone.
Napoleon McKinley, too, was in his imper
turbable mood, and answered back the sallies
of some of his democratic friends with a
quick, keen-pointed and albeit pleasant
tongue.
JIAJJT YISTTOBS.
With the exception of the few seats re
served exclusively for the members of the
president's family and for the diplomatic
corps, every available seat in the vast gal
leries, which surround the chamber of the
house, was occupied early in the forenoon by
spectators eager to witness the proceedings
of the second session of the Fifty-first con
gress. The steps' leading to the wide portals were
utilized as resting places and the open doors
furnished standing room only" to belated
arrivals.
A tasteful pyramid of flowers adorned tho
speaker's desk. On the democratic side, Mr.
Kerr, of Pennsylvania; Mr. Holman, Mr.
Wilson, of West Virginia; Mr. Flower and
Mr. Vaux were the recipients of handsome
floral designs and on the republican side,
Messrs. Flick, Harmcr and Atkinson, of
West Virginia, were not forgotten by their
friends.
The house was called to order promptly at
noon, and after the roll call, disclosing the
presence of 227 members, a committee was
appointed to notify the president that con
gress was ready for business. The new
members were then sworn in and a recess till
150 taken. Upon reassemblinc the oresi-
dent's message was read. The president's
message covered some forty pages of type
written manuscript, or a total of thirteen
thousand words.
JUDGE HABVET SWOTCT Ef.
Just previous to the reading of the mes
sage, the speaker laid before the "house the
credentials of David A. Harvey as delegate
from the territory of Oklahoma, and upon
motion of Mr. Perkins, of Kansas, the oatb
of office was administered to him.
THE SEKATE.
After a session lasting but a few minutes,
the senate took a recess lasting to 150 o'clock,
to allow the joint committee an opportunity
to notify the president that congress is pre
pared to resume business.
Shoemakers Will Not bo Ran by Their
Employes.
RocHESTEB, N. Y., December 3. There
aas been a strike in the factory of the P. Cox
Shoe Manufacturing company since June
last against the introduction of the Rochester
lasting machines. Twenty of the leading
manufacturers have signed the following
manifesto:
"We, the undersigned shoe manufacturers
of Rochester, N. Y., hereby agree that, on
ind after December 1, 1890, we will dismiss
from our employment all members of the
Boot and Shoemakers' International union
until such time as the strike against te P.
Cox Shoe Manufacturing company shall have
been completely abandoned and the rights
claimed by the following preamble be con
ceded and all opposition to the same with
drawn. "This association claims for themselves
and their associates the right to introduce
any machinery they deem desirable and to
mploy help to operate the same in such
manner as they may elect, either by the day,
week or piece."
The Stonx nations Increased.
ASBisGTOri. D. C, December 3. The
lecretary of the interior has directed that the
Sioux Indians be supplied with increased ra
tions sufficient to confirm to the agreement
made in 1877. The appropriations for sup
plies for the Sioux haTe decreased every year
upon the supposition that the Indians were
becoming men. and more capable of main
taining themselves. Owing, however, to the
partial failure of the crops for the pact year
or two. and restlessness of the Sioux, which
is believed to be in a measure due to the re
duction of rations, the secretary ha ordered
gn increase.
Drawing tha Line Very Close.
Paeis, December 3. The French govern
ment Mill not allow the importation into
France of Prof. Koch's lymph on the ground
that the importation of medicines, the com
position of which is not known, is fllesal, a
law prohibiting such importations being in
existence.
