greater
crcuit.
The Gcnoral, in tho introduction of his
rejoiudor, assigns as an exouso for the crit
icism on my public conduct that this was
merely incidental to his alleged official re
port to President Lincoln on tho condi
tion of our fortifications, and was not pri
marily intended for myself, From this
statement otio would conclude that ho had
made such a report. Rut whore is this to
be fouud ? For it he roieis to tho Intel-
renul m flin Intnl.
ligoncor of tho !ilst of October ; but thero
I diseovor nothing but his letter of four
points to Mr. Soward, ditcd on tho ad
March, ISfil , adviaing tho incoming Pres
ident how to guide his administration in
faco of tlio threatening dangers of tho
country. In tho single introductory sen
tence to this letter lie barely rcfors to his.

but it contains uolhiug liko an official re
port on the condition of the fortifications?.
Whether the introduction of this lottor
to tlio publio without the consent of Presi
dent Lincoln, by one of tho General's
friends, in a political speech during a highly
excited gubernatorial canvass, had inilu-
cnecd Ir.tn to prtpare his criticism on my
conduct, it is not for tne to determine.
At what period did General Scott ob-
tain tho six hundred recruits to which ho
rofers in his rejoinder? This was certainly
after tho dato ol his 'views,' on tho iiuth
October, 1800 ; becauso iu theso ho states
emphatically that the forces thon at his
command wcro "in all fivo companies only
within reach to parrison or reinforce the
(nine) forts mentioned in tho 'views.'
Uid ho obtain these iccruiis in Novcni-
ber ? If so, had ho visited Washington
or written and explained to mo in what
manner this military operation could bo
accomplished by th four hundred xioii in
tho fivo companies, and tho six hundred
recruits, I should havo given his roprcsen-
tations all the consideration eminently duo
to his high military reput.vion.
But ho informs us he did not arrive in
Washington uutil tho P-ith of Deccmbor,
Hissteond recom nicudation to garrison
these forts must consequently havo been
made according to his own statement, on
tho 13th, 10th, ymh, or IltHli of Decent- '
bcr, or on more than ono of these days.
At this period tho aspect of publio affairs '
had greatly changed from what it was iu
October. Congress was now iu session, ,
nml our relations with tho Scccdinj; Cot-.
ton States had been placed before thorn by '
t-Iio President's message. '
Proceedings had been instituted by that (
body nitli a view to tho oompromiso of:
tho dangerous questions between tho
North and tho South; and tho highest
hopes and warmest aspirations were then
untcrtniiii'd llr their success. Under those
circumstaucs it was thu President's duty

IICIU ItUUUrCUS Ol
thousands of undoubtedly bravo soldiers,
would havo abandoned in terror their un
lawful and rebellious designs, had General
Scott distributed among their numerous
forts four hundred and eighty men in Oc
tober, or one thousand men in December!
Thi- requires no comment.
I have never boon ablo to obtain a copy
of the speech of Mr. Floyd, at Richmond
to which I presume Gen. ticott refers ; but
I learned both at thu timo and miico, from
gentlemen ol'bigh respectability that in this
cauic speech bo denounced me mot bitter
ly for my determination to staud by and
sustain tho Uuion with all the power I
possessed under the Constitution and the
laws.
And hero permit mo to loniark that it
is duo to Gcnciral Scott as well as myself
to deny that there is any portion of my
answer which justifies tho allegation that
'tho os-L'rcsident sncors at my 'mWi'
device' (tho words 'weak devico' boiu
marked cs u quotation) for saving tho
forts." This mital;o I must attribute to
his ''accidental visitor. '
And in this connexion I emphatically
declare that tho General, neither befuj-o
nor after the publications of his "views"
in the National Irtelli.enccr of tho ISth
January, IHOI , without my consent, as-
I o J "'""" lining 1111.1

from the deep iinpro5.iou which tho occur

iuai iccior. ite iris csmntiffit them, antl
j now lor the fii.-t tini?, and in a saroaslic
, and no kindly tpirit, refers to tho alleged
slealing of public arms by Secretary Floyd
aud their tratiRB'Ttation to tho South in

conclusive answer to this allegation is that
' notwith-t Hiding tin; boasting of Mr. Floyd
' at KieltiiKinii, cviilectiy with tho view of
i conciliating tus new nines, cited by tlio Uon
eral as hu authority, no public arms wcro
over ttolon.
j This fact ia ostabliihod by tho report of

tho testimony before tho Commilteo estab
lish :
1. That the Southern State received
in 1S00 less in.-ie.id of ti-ioro than tho quo
ta of arm.i to which they wcro entitled by
law ; and that t'uoo of tltein North Car
olina, Misiissippi and Kentucky received
no arms whatever, and this simply be-
cause thoy did not ask for thorn. Woll
may Mr. Stanton havo said in tho House
"that there are a good deal of rumors and
speculations and misapprehensions as to
tho true stato of facts iu regard to this
matter'
2. Secretary Flovd, under suspicious
circumstances, on tho "JJid of Decoiuber,
1360, ami but a few days before ho left
the Department, had, without tho ktiowl-
edge of the Prciidetit, ordered one hundred
and thirteen (1 13) colutnbi.ids and cloven
(11) thirty two pounders to bo transported
from Pittsburg to tihip Island and Galvcs-
ton, in .Mi-iisiij pi and cxas.
ThU fact was brouhtto tho knowlodgo
of tho President by acomuiiiuicatiou from
PilUburg; and Secretary Holt immediate-
ly thereafter couiiteriiiaudi tl the order of
his prcdece.-eor, and the counon wcro ucv-
cr sent. Tho promptitude with which wo
actod dieted .1 votu of thanks, dated on
tho 4th of January, lb'01, from tho Select
and or.nnon Councils of that city, "to tho
President, the Attorney General, aud tho
acting Sooro'ary of War.". (Mr. Holt.)
After this statotuont how shall wo ao-
count for tho explicit declaration of Gen. ;
Scott that, "accidentally hearing early in
3 lurch that under tho posthumous order j
(that of Mr. h loyd of tho sWu December) I

And this is tho same Secretary Holt
who had countermanded "tho poulumous
ordor" in tho previous December. And, ,
ttraugo to say, these guns, but for tho al- ,
lencd interposition of Geiiural ticott, wcro
about to bo sent so lato as March from tho
Loyal States into those over which Jeffer-
son Davis had then for some timo presided! ,
Had General Scjtt reflected, for a mo-;
tnent, ho cotild not havo fallen into this
blunder. It is quito manifest ho was wiih-
out a printed document aud my (his) own :

A Strange Story.
The following wonderful story i3 told
by a correspondent of the Dublin Evening
Mail:
'I his is tho age of discoveries, and ono
of such a startling nature has just been
in ado in an English county that it syeuis
out of place in the region of rober fact,
and to belong purely to tho atmosphere of
tho three volume novel. Here are tho
circumstances the namts for tho moment
I am not at liberty to indicate :
Tho Earl of mariijd not long ago,
and brought his hrido home to one ot the
old family mansions which members of
tho English aristocracy regard with an
affection amounting to veneration. Tho
hdy, however, bcittg more continental in
her trslcs, after a nliort residence in tho
apaituieut appropriated to her u.-o csprrg
ed a wish to h.tvo a boudoir tu the vicin
ity of her hod ro mi. Tin' noble cu'l wottl't
gladly hiive comp'ied with the r quiMt,
but upon oxaminttiioii, it was found that
the rooms, as somotimci happens in antique
bui'ditig's, were i-o awkwardly di.-tributcd ,
tltst by no conceivable arranoment could
the de.Mrod boudoir bo fitted in. 'There
upon it became necessary to invoke profes
sional ussiitanco, an architect was
summoned from London. He examined
the house narrowly and said thero seemed
to bo nothiug for it but to build, though
at the ,ssme timo he could not rosiH tho
impression that thero must bo another un
discovered room somowhsro in that wing of
tho mansion. Thu noble carl laughed at
tho idea ; the oldoit servants aud retainers
of the fami'y w "re questioned, and declared
thai tluy had ucvji' heard even a rumor of
its existence
Tho ordinary methods of tapping, etc,
wcro rcsottcd to, but without effect. Still
tho architect retained his convictions, and
declared himself ready to stako his profes
sional reputation on tlio result. TIuj earl
at last consented to let tho walls be bored,
and, when an opening had been made, not
only was a room found,but a right presen
ted itself which almo.-t defeats attempt at
description. Tho apartment was fitted in
tho i ichf.it and most luxurious stylo of 150
years since. A quantity a ladies' apparel
lay about tho room, jewels wcro Bcattored
on tho droning t.iblo, and, but for the
faded ap.ct which everything wore the
chain1 er might havo been tenanted half an
hour previously. On appro'iohing tho bed
tho most curioiu fight of all was scon, ami
this it is that affords tho ouly cluo to tho
mystery. The oouoh held the skoloton of
traces ofvioloueo, and proving that boi'oru
ho expired ho must havo received sumo
dreadful injury. Tho secret connected
with this tale of blood has been well kept,
for not merely had all tradition of tho sccno
faded away, but even tho oxi 'tenco of tho
room itself was forgotton Tho survivors,
probably, walled up tho apartiuont at the
tune, and its contents remained hcrmeti
cally soalcd up to tho present day, when
according to tho best calculations, after tho
laspo of a century and a half, daylight has
accidentally penetrated this chamber of

A Wonderful Architect.
Do you know tho typo -setter ia an ar
chitect ? You know those bits of lead and
zino lying over, across and against oach
othor. like tho tangled braids of a mer
maid's hair? And yet they form an army
more powerful than ovor fought on tho
tented field. Yestcrdny they stood up
'form' trnly, in a thousand forms. You
may look upon tho little bits with a smile
on your lips, but you little dream thoy

ten. They havo sometimes mado you
smile, and sometimes shudder. 'Stocks 1'
Isn't thero something iu that word I
Havn't you been head and heels iu them
for years, and don't your feelings rise aud
with them alternately ? A little further on
youcomoto tho 'Married.' Ah 1 I tho't
that would make you smile. I saw you
kiss a baby thon, and that word unraveled
it all. You havn't forgotten the day you
went courtiug, havo you ? Then thero was
magic in the utterance. You stood at the
altor on tho rtrongth of tho happiness you
felt, and if you havo not always loved tho
girls as you onght to, thoro is no one you
lovn as well. You secretly bless tho day
when the single word 'Married' was
wreathed liko a sacred archway over the
joys of you and yours Don't you remom
ber little Minute she whom you loved so
well she with tho bluo eyes and auburn
curls I When Death's dark Angel folded
her little delicate hands over hes snowy
bosom, and sealed her lovely eyes with its
icy fiugcrs, don't you romouiber how tho
great tide of sorrow came surging o'er
your smitten heart? You little thought the
other day whon you picked up the paper
that the word 'Died,' of only four letters
which you laughed at as they lay dusty
and dirty iu thoir square liomei would
make you weep would make you think of
har whom God hath taken.
If you come to his office, the printer will
show you how to distribute knowledge.
Ho will pull to pieces tough, wiry argu
ments that yestortlay defied the world.
Those pretty palaces which the poet
wrought wiil have to come down, and their
golden fancies become to-morrow tbo in
teguments of tho politician's prose. In
they go those mctalic dwarfs, scattered
broadcast like good seed, which shall bring
foith sixty, ayo an huudred fold. 'Sixty
I lives lost' and 'Prcntico's last joko' march
in together, and tho printer whistles Yan
kee Doodle as carelessly as if human life
was below par, and so it is. This is tho
printer's life and business.
A Printing OSea is a great bowling al
loy. Tho printer nets up pins tho world
keeps talloy, tho editor puts tho ball in
motion, and away it goes, carrying death
and destruction in its front, sending a pin
hero nnd a pin there, while a noUy rabble
always stand by to chfer and hiss down
tho players. Somo play for money ; and
a few a prcrious few do it to patronizo
tho bo.a and bless mankind. No matter
what tho balls aro mado of or how they
go, if thoy only hit tho mark. The crowd
pocket tho spoil and tho honors are left to
tho proprietor, who g 'o behind the scenes
and starves in his shirt sleeves. And bitch
is life.
When the printer die, tho world just
gets a g'limp-c of his va'uu as his coat-tail '
vatiiih' s into g'ory, and then it looks ory
bail, rubs its head a little, calls him a
clever fellow ays only fault was in bciug '
poor, aud then the world shoves his sym
pathy out of sight into that idiom tho hu-1
inau heart, and on rolls the Juggernaut as
though nothing had happoncd. j
Somo day the people will wako up and ;
find a screw iost in the jagged machine of
human progress. If you do, don't wasto 1
more sympathy than possible on thoso my I
theological follows who print your books
and papers. I
JKSyBill Ross is n great tompcronoo lec
turer, and at Rushville, Illinois, was
preaching to tho young on his favoiito
thome. Ho said : 'Now boys, when I ask
you a question you mustn't bo afraid to
answer mo, When yon look around and
see all these fmo houses, farms and cattle,
Do you ever think who owns them all now?
Your fathers own them do thoy not' 'Yes
sir !'" shouted a hundred voices. 'Well,
whore will your fathers bo in twenty years
from now.'" 'Dead ?' shouted tho boys.
'That's right. And who will own all this
property then ?' 'Us boys!' 'x.igbt. Now
tell me did you ever, in going along tho
street, uotico tho drunkards lounging
around tho saloon doors, waiting for some
body to treat thorn?' 'Yes, sir I lots of
them.' 'Well.where will they bo in twen
ty years from now?' 'Dead.' 'And who
will bo tho Drunkards thon ?' 'Us boys.'
Biily was thunderstruck for a icomant ; but
rccouering himself tried to tell tho boys
how to escape suoh a tate,
Increasb of Rats. Tho Fanner's
Gazette ( Euglish) assorts and provss by
figures that otio pair of rates will havo
progony and deooudatits amounting to no
less than O.'i 1,000 in three years. Now
unless this immenso family can bo kept
down, they would su.itaiii 00, 000 hutnau
beings. It will be far wiser for tho farmer
to turn his attention to tho destruction of
rats than nuall birds.
Certainly it will. Whoever engages in
shootiug small birds is a cruel man ; u ho
over aids in exterminating is u benefactor.

Miscellaneous.
Jon Bnouw. Joo Brown was nico
young man, generally ; but ho had his
faults, nnd who has not? When whiskey
was in circulation, Joo never refused to
tako a glass, and sometimes wbiskoygot
the bettor of hirn ; but to do Joo justico,
it tlid take an awful quantity of whiskey to
turn him into a fool. Ho got married
lately, and started a little home of his own.
It used to be Mrs. Joe's practice to havo a
plato of something nico waiting on the
tablo when ho got homo lato at night.
One night ho got home just bluo onough
to try to open tho door with a Gvo cent
peico, and pull of his boots with a tooth
pick ; but still ho was hungry, and not oo
very drunk after all. Ho fouud tho tablo
and seatod himself. 'What an old bruto
I am (hie!) any way, to go and get (bio!)
drunk, and my wife homo hero fixing rao
(hio') such a nico plato of cabbago.' Ho
pulled the plate up, and aftir seasoning it
to suit, his taste, began with knife and fork,
to cut tho 'cabbage;' but 'nary gash'
could ho make ! Ho sawed and swore, and
aawed and swore again. Ho took it in his
hands and tried to tear it ; but it was in
vain. Ho began to saw and swear again.
Ho took it in his hands, and, at last, either
cut or swore a peice off. Ho put it in his
mouth and tried to chew; but that was no
go. Ho laid down tho 'cabbage' and began
to swear, which foon brought his wife from
her dreams, and into tho room.
'What's tho matter Joo ?'
'Matter enough, (bio) Sally I can't oat
this cabbago.'
'What cabbage, .loo ? Nothing thero as
I can seo, but my two uight cups soaking
in a plato of starch 1'
'Oh (hie) Jerusalatnl Sail let's goto

Bob YO addon's Horso Trade.
'You know Bob Wadden, I guess,' Baid
Undo Miko.
'Not that I recoiled,' I replied.
'Well, Bob was nn amazin' hand at tra
din'hcrsoj, aud generally camoout ahoatl,
too. I never knew hira really girdlutl and.
the underbrush cut but onco.'
'How was that Uncle .Mike ?'
Why, you sco, Bob had been gettin' a
gray horco in aonio of his dealing, that was
jist about ns nico to look at as ovor put his
noso through tho rack sticks, ho was a hn
man lookiu' horc, and notbin' shortor ;
ho was always lookin, artor, stars, and
oarried his tail like tho nation! flag on tho
4th of July; but ho wouldn't w'ork ho
wan above it, ho'd almost stop when ho
saw hisnhadow following him, for foar ho
might bo drawin' it.'
'Now, then,' says Bob, 'some individual
is bound to be picked up.'
'So makin' an excuse that old Gray'a
shoes wanted fixen,' hoscnthitn to tho
blaokiinith's harnessed up his t'other hor
ses hitched thorn to a wagon load of stones,
drovo down to Sam Hcwi't's, stopped bo
foro his door, took out tho noar horse and,
harucsscd up the gray in his place, went
in, took a drink and waited around till
somo fellow should come along who want-
eu to fpocuiaie. tio noun t waitod long
when ho seen some feller oomiu' down tbo
road liko all creation, bus horse nndcr a
full run while be was sawin the bits nnd
hollcrin' wo, wo ! with ull his might antl
main. Ho mauaged to stop him nftor a
littlo by Sam Hewitt's nnd turning him
around, he camo up a slappin, his hands
aud iu a toarin' passion with his horso.'
'He's nover ready'to stop,' says he, 'that
horse ain't, and though he's tho best horso
I ever owned, yet I m determined to get
shut of him.'
'Well, just then, oat oomos Bob, and
mounted his wagou, just as if ho was goin'
to drive off, wheu, says ho, Hallo, stran
ger, peibapi you'd liko to deal with mo
for a steady ono ?'
'Why yes,' said the stranger, 'I would
liko something a little more quiet than that
go-ahead, auap-dragon ra.-cal of mine."
'Well,' says Bob, nftor nfow words with
mo, 'thetc's my gray here' your sorrel,
what's yonr proposition ?'
'Now you aro talking,' said the atrancr
examining tho gray as ho stood hitched to
the load ot stone ; 'Ml givo you sorrel and
tho best forty-dollar cloak in my wan-on
for tho gray.' D
'Douo,' raid Bob ; 'just unhitch.'
Neither of them asked t'other questions,
'causo noithcr of them wanted to answer
any. Tho horses were exchanged, Bob
got his cloak, and tho atranger got into his
wagon, took up his lines, and bidden' 'cm
good bye, was about to start, whon gray
put a stop to it and wouldn't budgo a hair.
Iu vain did tho strangor whip aud coax
not an iuch could ho get. Thoro sat Bob
laughing ia his sleeves, almost ready to
burst, to seo how tho stranger was tryino
to Btart and couldn't. Not a word did
the stranger say, however but aftor he bad
got quito tired, and hail given up trying it
any more, ho came and sat down ontho
horso blook. Bob thought ho might as
well bo going ; so picking up tho rfbboDs,
go along says he, Tho sorrel ..turnod hia
head and looked back at him, as much as
to say,don't ynu wish would ? but didn't
stir or pull. In vain Bob ooaxed and pat
tod,sorroll was thero and wasn't any whero
olso.
'VVell, I reckon it's my turn to laugh
now,' said tho stranger ; I supprso youMl
call again when you come to town ?'
'Oh, yes,' said the stranger, 'you can
start him if you'll only bring some sha
vings nnd kindle a fire under him as I did '
Thon bo laughed again, and when I
camo away, they were playin' a gamo to
sco who should take 'cm both.

my prayer is that they may all hang to
