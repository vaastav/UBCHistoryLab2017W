Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, as they cannot
redch the diseased portion of the ear.
There is only one way to cure ca
tarrhal deafness, and that is by a
1 constitutional remedy. Catarrhal
Deafness is caused by an inflamed
condition of the mucous lining of the
Eustachian Tube. When this tube is
inflamed you have a rumbling sound
or imperfect hearing, and when it is
entirely closed. Deafness is the re
sult. Unless the inflammation can
be reduced and this tube restored to
its normal condition, hearing will be
destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness are caused by catarrh.which
is an inflamed condition of the mu
cous surfaces. Hall’s Catarrh Medi
cine acts thru the blood on the mu
cous surfaces of thet system.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
i for any case of Catarrhal Deafness
that cannot be cured by Hall’s Ca
tarrh Medicine. Circulars free. All

THE FIRST WAR CONGRESS
Senator Chamberlain, of Oregoi ,\Vho
| Sponsored Many Important Vleas
-1 ures, Reviews Record of A'cum
plishment.
1 _
(By George E. Chamberlain.)
i “It may be stated without qualifi
cation that no Congress since the
. adoption of the Constitution has such
j a record of accomplishment as has
i the first session of the Sixty-Fifth
Congress-—the first War Congress,
j This statement has particularly' to
do with legislation that has been
| made necessary for placing the
country in a proper attitude fior a
I defensive as well as for an offensive
i world war.
"On the second day of April. 1917,
| ihe President delivered his message
! to Congress calling attention to the
! iact that America because of the
I attitude which the Imperial German
l Government hnu assumed was al
i ready in a state of war, and advising
[ a.; to the needs of the country for
! oriugiug that war lo a successful
i onciusion. On the fifth day $f the
I same month Congress adopted a
j resolution declaring that a state ot
j .v ar existed, and on the next dijr the
! President’s proclamation ot war was
i issued.
"V\ uh the exception of a few laws
| which were passed during the pre
( ceding session providing for a ire or
ganization of the Army and ah in
crease of the Navy in the number of
: battleships and in the personnel as
| well, America was practically uhpre
! pared to play its part in the jgreat
: war of history. Immediately, £how
j ever, upon the issuance of the Presi
j dent’s proclamation and as soon as
I the needs of our country were brou
| ght to the attention of Congress leg
| islation began to be formulatedJ dis-
I cussed, and enacted w hich the
j demanded.
•’There has been a disposition in
| some quarters 10 criticise Copgres
-1 sional action and to charge
| ness upon the part of the AdnMuis
-1 nation. Such criticism was aid is
I wholly unjustified, however much
• merited might be a criticism ; that
j Congress had acted with too fbuch
i haste, for between the declaration ot
war and the adjournment of Con
gress everything was done which
seemed to be necessary in order* that
America might play her part in an
international cataclysm.
"It would he impossible in a short
statement to go into details with ref-
I erence to legislation which has been
j enacted, but it is proper to call at
j tention to a few of the most salient
j measures. First of all as an efficient
i measure for raising an Army the se
lective draft law easily occupies the
first place. The draft was urged by
Washington and his generals as nec
essary to the successful carrying out
of the Revolutionary War, and a
reluctant Congress finally enacted
such a law without the power to en
force it, and one of the first Acts of
Congress under the Constitution was
the compulsory service law of 1792,
which remained on the statute books
until its repeal by the so-called Mck
law, in 1903. That -
flcable and uns&ited t omodern "cbn
ditions and in a war such as that
which is waging now- would have
been wholly lacking in efficiency. Jef
ferson favored such a law, and one
of the ablest unofficial pronounce
ments of President Lincoln was in
favor of the draft Act of 1863.
‘‘Before Great Britain had pro
ceeded far with the preformance of
her part in the pending struggle her
statesmen and military leaders rea
lized that such a law' was necessary
to raise an efficient Army, and after
a long struggle such an Act was fin
ally. passed.
‘‘The same thing is true of Cana
da, and 'only within the past few /
months has such an Act been passed
by the Canadian Parliament, so that
it will be seen that in the Very be
ginning of the participation by the
United States in the war Congress,
profiting by the mistakes of her Al
lies, promptly passed the selective
draft law' which compels those be
tween the ages of 21 and 31 years
to recognize that the rights of citi
zenship involves a reciprocal duty
and makes every man within mili
tary age respond to a call to the col
ors when his service is needed.
“Within this period of six months
therefore w'e have seen an Army of
a million men raised by the volun
teer system supplemented by the se
lective draft law. This Army has
been raised, too, by the civilian for
ces of the Government, and we have
had the remarkable spectacle within
recent weeks of more than 300,000
young men mobilizing to their res
pective rendezvous unaccompanied by
military leaders and practically on
orders issued by the Commander in
Chief of the Army through appro
priate tribunals in the different
States. If the w'hole Army could have
been raised by this method instead
of through a resort to the volunteer
system the burdens would have fal
len with less w'eight upon individu
al communities and would have been
more equitably distributed through
out the several communities in the
several States, thus affording pro-1
tection against the depletion of la- j
bor in commermal, agricultural and
industrial life.
“Next in importance was the Act
appropriating $640,000,000 for the j
construction of aircraft, and later j
the bill providing for the creation of i
the Aircraft Board. Under these |
two Acts the United States w'ith a j
possible output of a few airplanes i
per year will now', through the mobi- j
lization of its industrial work, be ah- |
le to construct airplanes in suffiei- ■
ent numbers to meet her own re- j
quirements and possibly those of,
her Allies as well. If as has been j
asserted in many quarters these ma- 1
chines are to be a determining fac- |
tor in the war America is prepared |
to perform her part both' in the num- |
her of machines to be furnished and j
in the splendid personnel to operate |
them.
“But w'hile plans for the reorgani
zation and mobilization of a large j
land force were being placed upon |
the statute books and carried into j
execution the naval program has not |
been neglected. This program was
enlarged and the Navy ordered to be
increased by the addition of torpedo j
boats at a cost of $6,115,000 and 26 j
coast submarines at a cost of SSO,- |
000,000, and the President authoriz- j
ed to expend in his discretion, in or- j
der to secure more expeditious de-!
livery of material, $215,000,000, j
while by the Act of April 17, 1917, i
$100,000,000 was appropriated to be |
expended by the President in his dis
cretion.
“Supplementing this legislation
and in order to laise money to meet
the vast expenditures which the war
imposed the Act of April 24. 1917,
gave authority for the issuance of
$7,000,000,000 of bonds and certifi
cates of indebtedness.
“On May 12, 1917, an Act was
passed authorizing the President to
seize all vessels belonging to citizens
• of enemy nations. It was under this
Act that the enemy vessels which
were interned in the rivers and har
bors of the United States and the
colonial possessions were taken
■ charge of by the Government; not,
however, until many of them had
been so crippled by their former of
ficers and crews as to render their
iraediate use impossible.
“On the 15th of June the Espion
age bill passed, for the protection of
the Government against alien ene
mies, and made their crimes punish
able by severe fines and imprison
ment, or both. The same bill gave
the President, absolute control over
the movements of all vessels, foreign
and domestic, in the territorial wa
ters of the United States, with the
right to take possession of the same.
It penalized injury to foreign ves
sels within the same waters and for
bade interference with or obstruction
of exports to other countries. It au
thorized the President to withhold
clearance of vessels carrying sup
plies or information to belligerent
nations and the detention of any
armed vessels domestic >r foreign,
coming within the waters of the
United States, and to seize arms and
ammunition intended for export. It
authorized him to prohibit exporta
tions to any oi all countries by pro
claimation, except at such times and
under such regulations as he might
fix, and empowered him to refuse
clearance to any vessel, domestic or
foreign, carrying such goods. This
act was extremely broad in its terms
and covered many conditions that
might arise and which threatened
danger to the country.
“One of the most important mea
sures is that of June 15, 1917, ap
propriating $750,000,000 for the
construction of a merchant marine to
take the place of shipping now being
destroyed by the ruthless submarine
policy of the Imperial German Gov
ernment. It is hoped that, when
once under full headway, the losses
sustained in the ocean-carrying busi
ness will be more than compensated
for by Ihe construction of new ves
sels.
“The act which evoked much bit
ter criticism and opposition, botn in
the Senate and >n the House of Rep
resentatives, is (hat of August 10,
1917, known as the Food Control
Bill. Its constitutionality' as well as
its provisions were assailed, and yet,
when the vote was had, few in either
body voted against it —another evi
dence that the Congress has been
and is ready' to do all that may’ be
deemed necessary in this crisis.
“Another act of equal importance
is that of August 10, providing for
the stimulating of agrculture and
facilitating the distribution of agri
culture products. These two meas
ures, taken together, will enable the
President and those appointed by'
him, to carry out their terms to sta
bilize prices and control the food
products of the country, both for our 1
own and our allies’ uses.
“The act of June 12, 1917, amen-j
datory of the war risk .insurance j
measure of September 2, 1914, pro-;
vides for the insurance of the officers j
and men of merchant vessels, pro- j
vides for the insurance of the officers |
-and men of merchant vcissld,.-pro
vides compensation in cases of per-1
manent disability incurred in the i
course of their business, and broad- \
ens the former act in its terms, ap- 1
propriating $50,000,000 for carrying ;
out the purposes thereof.
"One of the very' important meas- j
ures which passed in the closing days !
of the session was the bill providing :
for the insurance of soldiers and sai- j
lors composing the military' and na- j
val establishments. It is believed
that this measure will greatly reduce i
the pensions which every war has
compelled the Government to pay
and at the same time make the men
of our Army and Navy' feel that their
/loved ones at home will be cared for
if in the emergency of war the worst
befalls them.
“Attention only been called to
a few of the more important meas
ures that have been passed at this
session of Congress. There are nu-

; uierous provisions in the various ap
; propria!ion bills enlarging ihe pow- <
i ers of Ihe President in the conduct |
-of the war and appropriating large ,
> sums ol money. It is difficult in a ■
i statement of any reasonable length J
, to show their importance.but enough .
i has been given to show that no for- 1
- mer Congress has ever done so much, \
• and in so little time, to assist our i
j country, as has this one in the most 1
- dangerous crisis that has ever con
f fronted it.
"The question is sometimes asked
■ if the country approves of this legis- ]
- lation. The unanimity with which ■
■ Senators and Representatives have ‘
• stood for it all indicates that it is ,
i sustained by the people. Having •
■ been forced into a war with the J
; most efiicient military despotism the
world ever knew, motives of patriot- •
• ism, our country ’s safety, the liberty J
of the citizen, and the perpetuation ,
i of our institutions, all demanded •
- prompt, radical, and effective legisla- J
1 lion. Opposition to legislation that ,
has been passed is sporadic. It will •
be found in groups of extreme paci- J
r lists, pro-German sympathizers, and •
, among men who care uot what the •
• fate of our country may be. It may J
I safely be predicted that, when the •
country fully realizes the dangers •
which threaten, there will be few, if J
any. in these several groups so bold •
[ as to express opposition to the tak- ■
: ing of whatever steps may be neces-! J
> sary to perfect our defense.” •
And Who Is My Neighbor? \\
l i i
This question was answered by our ]
Lord, in the story of the Good Sa-j
maritan, and, while the world is at I
' war, suffering and devastation in ev- - 1
1 ery land, and in our own loved conn- ;
try, we are beginning to feel the i
pinch of hard times; soon we’ll feel j
the grip of harder times. While the j
clouds of want and suffering loom j
before our vision, the question comes]
to us, and who is my neighbor? The j
answer comes, it is !he man or wo
man or family, who is hungry, with j
no food, who is shivering from cold,
with no fuel, whose bodies are feel- i
ing the biting cold winds with scant ;
clothing; this is no fancied picture, i
but a condition which will confront
us during the coming winter. Shall i
we be the Samaritans of help, or |
will we pass by, little concerned in j
suffering humanity, to receive the -
condemnation of our Blessed Master, I
“Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of |
the least of these, ye did it not to I
me?”
Your opportunity is at hand, the j
call is made, what will be your an- |
swer?
The Associated Charities of Cam- j
bridge, under the influence and :
management of the ministers of our |
city', is a worthy and commendable j
association, worthy of our confidence |
and assistance to relieve the de- j
| mands of the hour. Let us prove |
! our confidence in them, and our I
| sympathy in suffering humanity, by j
| liberally subscribing and giving to I
! this most worthy cause. j
With a population of 7,000, with ! *
I wood and rood costing three times as ,
j much as it did a few years ago.tbere i
| must necessarily be much suffering.
| I would suggest that this associa- I
; tion, through its recently appointed j
i committee of ladies, solicit a fund 1
jas follows: $1 per year as annual j
I dues, and $1 or less per month, for I
j the months of December, January, j
j February, and March. Let us mea-
I sure up to our full duty as citizens. !
