the brother has been trying to carry
the Order "into politics."
Tom Watson, of Georgia, i3 re
ported to have said recently: "I en
listed in the cause of reform for life, and
I will never cease my labors until my
exhausted hands are folded across my
lifeless breast." He asks, " who will
follow?"
The prize fight craze ha3 struck
North Carolina at last. There was a
"mill" at Durham one night last
week. Much whiskey was consumed
and a good deal of money wasted. Per
haps the. world will grow wise enough
to stop such things after awhile. fc
Not long ago a gentleman who is
not a farmer said : " If I was farming
I would raise nothing but hay and
hogs." That is pretty good that far,
but the doctors tell us we must "diver
sify." How . could he raise hay with
hogs, or how could he raise hogs with
hay ? The man evidently is a hay seeder,
and very green at that.
DANGER AHEAD.
It is not certain that the price of
cotton will be as high next spring as it
is now, though ikehould go higher. In
either case it will tend to influence our
farmers to plant another large crop.
There is danger in this. To be on the
safe side our Southern farmers must
not depend upon cotton hereafter. It
will do for a surplus crop, but under
no circumstances should it be made a
leading crop, at least not while the un
certainty of prices exist. The only
hope in the cotton belt is to raise, as
far as possible, something to eat and
wear. Cotton may be a good price ; it
may drop down to 6 cents again. Bet

DETERMINED TO B . ILD IT UP.
The Atlanta Constitution publishes
a long interview with Bro. C. H. El
lington, President of the Georgia State
Alliance, in regard" to the future of the
Alliance in that State. Bro. Ellington
says the recent election, has put tho
Alliance in the background temporar
ily, but thinks the outlook splendid
for rebuilding. The differences as to
methods cf getting reforms demanded
is the only trouble. All those who
have joined the Alliance from pure
motives will stick to it through thick
and thin, regardless of how they voted.
THE SIXTY-SECOND ANNUAL
MEETING OF THE NORTH
CAROLINA BAPTIST
STATE CONVENTION.
WARM TIMES IN ALABAMA.
According to a dispatch in our news
columns the Alabama Legislature is
wrought up. The Alliance members
cf the body want to reduce salaries of
all officials, it Feems, and the officials
are calling them anarchists. We sup
pose they only want to reduce them in
proportion to the prices of farm prod
ucts. If that be the case they are
right. However, those who undertake
to put matters on an equal basis,
"equal rights to all," may expect op
position and need not be surprised if
their opponents characterizo them as
anarchists, socialists, repudiationists
or an thing else.
A CHANGE WILL COME.
While reform may be retarded at
every step and reformers lose all hope
at times, still the movement will go on
in some way, under some plan.
Tyranny, injustice, wickedness has its
day. Trusts may prosper for years
and laugh at the Jaws and protests of
the people, but the patriotic will crush
them out in the end. The spirit of
equal rights is not dead. Political
parties may ignore the mot o for a
long time, but they will come to grief.
We have p3op!e among us who are al
most desperate now, but they should
not be permitted to shape the policy of
any party or organization. Pure,
patriotic men are needed in this crisis.
Conservative men are next to honest
men in importance. In this way there
will be a peaceful solution.
RAISE YOUR MEAT.
Our exchanges are full of big hog
storiei. The hogs are said to weigh
from 200 to 700 pounds each. This is
fresh evidence of what is already
known that as large hogs can be
raised in North Carolina as anywhere
in the world.
Very few of our farmers can make
any money under present conditions,
and the best thing in the world to do
is to raise something to eat and wear.
Meat can be bought at low prices for
cash at any time, but there is no cash
to pay for it. Hence the wisest thing
to do is to raise it yourself. If you can
raise one good hog, it will prove a good
thing for your family. You know
whether the hog was sick or well when
killed. You know the advantage of
V m m n mm m

Begin now buying pigs, if you have
none, and raise your own meat. Thi3
would be a good topic for discussion in
your Alliance, and is "strictly non
partisan."
WILL NOT FELLOWSHIP.
NO BEGGING REQUIRED.
Ever since this Republic .has existed
there has been a wide diversity of
thought in politics and religion.
Churches have been divided, leading
men voting against leading men.
Every other organization, has been rent
asunder. Even before the war some of
the campaigns were as bitter as the
one of 1892, though not fought on
principle vs. fraud, as this one was. In
the recent campaign the object was to
crush out reform thought at a single
Mow. The plutocratic press, inspired
by the great monopolists, furnished the
material to create-bitter party, race
and sectional feeling to a larger degree
than ever before. In this way men,
good men, too, were 44 wrought up" on
-politics who hardly ever took any ac
tiVa niri before. Such men will not

We recently heard of a member
withdrawing from a Sub -Alliance be
cause some of its members voted with
he People's party. He being a strong
Democrat, he said he couldn't 44 fellow
ship" with those who voted on the
other side.
Every fair minded man will condemn
such a course. If the Alliance is a non
partisan organization, why attempt to
make all its members vote with any
one party? We have contended all
the time that it was right for the mem
bers to vote with whatever Dartv
t
adopted our platform, but if any mem
ber could not see his wav oAesir to do
-
so, then he should not be criticised.
The leaders who have taught the mem-
Ders certain duties are open to criticism
when they attempt to get the members
to practice what they have not
preached, but the masses are not to be
held accountable for what they believe
is right. The Progressive Farmer
boldly urged the members to stand by
our platform and for that reason it is
called a 44 partisan paper.'- We were
partisan enough to stand by the plat
form. We expect to stand by it as long
as we can endorse it. Now i that right
or wrong?
The sixty second annual meeting of
the Baptist State Convention convened
in this city Thursday evening, Dec. 8th.
The opening sermon was preached by
Rev. J. S. Hardaway, of Oxford, after
which the Convention was regularly
organized by the election of the follow
ing officers: Rev. R. H. Marsh, Oxford,
President; Rev. H. A. Brown, Win
ston, T. M. Pittm .n, Esq , Henderson,
Rev. R. T. Vann, Scotland Neck, Vice
Presidents; N. B. Broughton, Raleigh,
Rev. N. B. Cobb, Raleigh, Secretaries;
J. D. Boushall, Esq., Raleigh, Treas
urer; W. N. Jcnes, Esq , Raleigh, Au
ditor, and Rev. C. Durham, Raleigh,
Corresponding Secret iry. N. L. Shaw,
of Warrenton, was appointed Assis
tant Secretary.
FRIDAY MORNING,
There were more than three hundred
delegates reported present at the open
ing of the morning session. Rev. J. J.
Hall, D. D., pastor of the Tabernacle
Church, welcomed the Convention to
the church and to the hospitality of the
city in an appropriate address, which
was responded to in an address equally
as appropriate in word, spirit and de
livery, on behalf of the convention, by
E. K. Proctor, of Lumberton.
The chair announced the usual com
mittees, and welcomed a host of visit
ing brethren coming with fraternal
greetings from other States.
Rev. C. Durham read the annual re
port of the Board of Missions, which
will make 22 pages in the minutes,
hence is too long for this report, but
we give some extracts for many of our
readers who will read them with in
terest,
STATE MISSIONS.
During the year just closing eight of
the ministers who have done mission
ary work under the board have died.
One new association was formed; and
two have been blotted from the map
by consolidation with others. In 1872
there were 1,489,000 Baptists in the
United St-aUs; now there are about
3,500,000, or the number has mora than
doubled in twenty years, making now
about one in twenty of the entire popu
lation. In 1872 the B iptist colleges and
seminaries in the United States owned
$3,467,100 in property, etc.; now they
own $29,000,000. About one in six of
the population of North Carolina is a
Baptist. Work of missionaries in the
State this year: Sermons, 11,486; mis
sion churches supplied, 228; out sta
tions supplied, 427; Baptisms, 1,142;
added by letter, 1,294; churches organ
ized, 62; Sunday-schools organized, 63;
houses of worship finished, 2S; cost of
these house of worship, 33,6C0; houses
of worship now building, 87. Many
fields have become self sustaining.
home missions.
This part of the report gives informa
tion about the mission work, of the
Southern Baptist Convention, among
the Indians, the foreign population in
the Southwestern States and Territories
and wherever there is need anywhere
in the Southern Stites, and also in
Cuba. The results of the work of this
board for the year ending May 1, 1892,
may be summarized as follows: Mis
sionaries, 365; weeks of labor, 10,640;
churches, and stations, 1,324; sermons
and addresses, 46,866; prayer meetings,
14,042; baptisms, 5,274; received by let
ter, 5,973; total additions, 11,785; Sunday-schools
organized, 342; teachers
and pupils, 17,785; religious visits, ;54,
336 ; churches constituted, 179 ; houses
of worship built, 80 ; Bibles and Testa
ments distributed, 4,304 ; pages of tracts
distributed, 919,472
FOREIGN MISSIONS.
This also is a part of the general
work of the Southern Baptist Conven
tion, but a department of the work of
the N. C. Board, through and in har
mony with which it works. The fields
occupied by the missionaries under the
direction of this Board are : Southern
China, Central China, Northern China
Africa, Italy, Brazil, Mexico, and
Japan. In these fields there are thirty
main stations and 155 other stations,
where there are 38 male and 53 female
missionaries, assisted by 21 ordained
and 60 unordained natives, they have
74 organized churches with 2,723 mem
bers. Baptisms this year, 434; con
tributions, $3,956.09. They have 15
schools with 748 scholars.
The contributions to the objects of
this Board have doubled with every
decade since 1815, the report last year
showed receipts $44,657.42, and this
year $53,319 56, an increase in one year
of $8,668;i4, which is the most remark
able increase in the history of the
Board.
SUNDAY SCHOOLS.
The interest of this part of the report
centres largely around the Sunday
school Supply Store, which was estab
lished by order of the Convention 1881
2, and has been in operation ten years.
In that time, with very limited re
sources, it lias aided 855 indigent Sunday-schools,
and through its aid 831
new schools have been organized. The
i
and the total business to $67,180.93.
This report shows a decided improve
ment in this department since last re
port. After the reading of this most enter
taining and instructive report, the
Convention was addressed by Rev. H.
A. Frost, representing the Sunday
school periodicals, Rev. W. B. Bagby,
Missionary to Brazil, Rev. H. A. Tup
per, D. D., Secretary of the Foreign
Mission Board, Rev. W. D. Powell,
Missionary to Mexico, and Rev. D. W.
Herring, Missionary to China.
At 2 o'clock the Convention ad
journed to meet at 7 p. m.
evening session.
When the hour for order had arrived
every available seat in the Tabernacle
was occupied, and many were standing
in the aisles. After singing a hymn,
and prayer by Rev. A. J. S. Thomas,
of S, C, the great Convention was
called to order and the report of the
Board of Edu ;ation was read by Rev.
W. R. Gwaltney, This report shows
the design of the work of this Board is
to assist indigent young ministers in
securing collegiate education, and that
the ten missionaries from this State in
foreign fields is an evidence of Divine
blessing upon its work. The Board
aided 42 students last year, many of
whom are now at the Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary at Louisville.
This year the number helped has been
37, and more than 40 applicants now
seeking recognition. In behalf of these
40 he appealed for liberal, contributions.
Rev. V. E. Hatcher, pastor of Grace
street Church, Richmond, Va., and
President of the Education Board of
the Virginia Baptists, was called to
the rostrum, and in a strong address
of nearly an hour's length, showed the
human and ti e divine elements in the
call to the Gospel ministry, and the
obligations resting upon all God's chil
dren to hold up the human hand in the
divine work. After his address, a col
lection amounting to $535 in cash and
pledges was taken up.
Prof. A. T. Robinson, of the South
ern Baptist Convention, was next in
troduced and laid before the Conven
tion the claims of the institution he
came to represent. He said there were
now 17 students there from North Caro
lina. These could count among their
number some of the brightest intellects
that could be found in the State, but
that they were needing help. They
would get it from other States if North
Carolina would not help them, but he
had an abiding faith in North Carolina
that she would not permit this. A
collection was taken for this object in
cash and pledges amounting to $510.
The report was then adopted and the
Convention adjourned to me ?t at 9
Saturday morning.
second day morning session.
The weather after the shower of last
night was perfectly delightful. The
Convention assembled at 9 :30 and spenc
half an hour in devotional exercises,
conducted by Dr. Ellis, of Baltimore.
At 10 o'clock sharp President Marsh
wrapped for order. The minutes of
yesterday were read and approved and
the report of the Committee to Nomi
nate Board of Elucation was read and
adopted. Committee on place for
holding, and preachers for, next meet
ing, reported, recommending Elizabeth
City as the place, Rev. W. B. Oliver, of
Fayetteviile, to preach the sermon, Dr.
J. W: Carter, of. Raleigh, Alternate.
Report adopted.
Rev. C. Durham read an extract
from the report of the Board of Mis
sions, relating to State missions and
addressed the convention on the im
portance of the work. He was followed
by Dr. C. E. Taylor, President of Wake
Forest College who, in his earnestness,
and thorough knowledge of the work
and its importance, was able to elicit
and hold the attention of the Conven
tion until it scarcely seems possible
that any person in that -vast audience
could fail to see and appreciate the
great good that has come and is still to
come, to not only North Carolina, but
to the whole world from just this class
of Christian work.
Rev. F. M. Jordan, of the Western
N. C. Convention, then addressed the
Convention, giving some of his experi
ences as a missionary in North Caro
lina, briefly sketching some of the fields
when he first visited them and con
trasting the same fields now with their
condition then, etc.
Secretary Durham then said the
Board had done more work the past
year than during any other year of its
history, and that the report shows
the Board in debt more than $1,800.
This was mostly brought forward from
last report, but ought to be cleared off.
Subscriptions in cash and pledges were
called for and more than $1,200 raised.
Rev. R. T. Vann offered a resolution
authorizing the Board to borrow money
when needed to pay the debts. After
some discussion this passed almost
unanimously.
a sat announcement.
At this juncture the chair announced
in a voice choked with sadness, that Rev.
u: Uoward had been called home by
a telegram announcing the death of his
son, killed on the railroad, and that
Rev. R. Van Deventer was detained at
home on account of the death of his
father.
THE SPECIAL ORDER
The Centennial of Missions was now
announced, and with Dr. F. M. Ellis
as first speaker. He reviewed the one
hundred years of missionary work
from the time of William Cary, clear
ly showing in his clear, rhetorical
logic that the evangelization of the na
tions through the foreign mission
spirit and work of the churches is the
one important and true work of the
Master Dr. Powell, Missionary to
Mexico, was the next speaker, and it
is safe to say this address will linger
in the hearts of those who heard it,
as the incidents related ly him,
gathered from his experience on the
field, will ever remain fresh in all our
minds.
EVENING SESSION.
The Tabernacle is again literally
packed. After prayer, Rev. J. B. Har
rell leading, the special order was post
poned 30 minutes to hear the report of
Ministerial Relief Board, and short ad
dresses on the work and its impor
tance were made by Rev. J. W. Al
bright and H. A. Reams.
THE ORPHANAGE
was now taken up. The report of the
committee read as follows:
To care for the orphans is one of the
highest dutie-3-of the denomination.
We have an orphanage near Thomas
ville, N. C, including a valu ible farm,
with building sufficient to accomodate
125 children It gives us pleasure to
mention that a legacy was recently
left by Miss Fannie A. Miller, a mem
ber of the High Point Church, for the
purpose of erecting an additional build
ing. Every part of the State is repre
sented at the orphanage and we cordi
ally recommend the work to the sj m
pathy and support of the denomination
throughout the State.
Walter A. Montgomery, Esq , Bro.
"Jack" Mills, and Rev. A. E. Dickenson
of the Religions Herald Richmond,
delivered very interesting and feel
ing addresses, after which a collection
amounting to something more than
$200, mostly in cash, was taken up
and the Convention adjourned
SUNDAY'S SERVICES.
All the pulpits in Raleigh were sup
plied by members of the Convention,
except the Episcopal the Catholic and
the Primitive Baptist, and it being a
beautiful day, every church was filled,
at both Sundays school and preaching
services. Especially irteresting ser
vices were held in the Baptist churches.
The Convention will not adjourn be
fore Tuesday, though as we go to press
first thing Monday morning, we have
to cut the report short here. We'll
finish it up next week.
THE GRAPE DISTRICT.
! peritv" t.nfZvir7f
thathecouS' r IT'
I for thf hntf -lia sompni. -i
Even in
A New York writer says: 44 The
largest vineyard area of native grapes
in this country runs through western
New York and into Pennsylvania
along Lake Erie, forming a belt of
land which annually yields from 50,000
to 60,000 tons of table grapes for mar
ket. Whiie this represents the amount
sold in the market as table grapes
there are many thousands of tons in
addition which are utilized in other
ways or left to rot on the vines. It is
estimated by growers that over 50,000
acres are planted with grapes in that
region, and the Lumber of vineyards
increases every season. Probably no
part of the country offers better facili
ties and "richer grape soil than can be
found there."
What about North Carolina as a
grape-growing section? Around Ral
eigh grapes grow as well, perhaps, as
in the famed " grape district." Of
course the New York belt has many
advantages in the way of markets, ba
ing so near the great cities, but they
grow as well here, the flavor is unex
celled, and the time will come when it
will be a profitable business here.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Harrison issued his last
annual message to Congress on the 8th
inst. ne stares on. wim iae usual
"great prosperity " racket, as follows:
" In submitting my annual message
to Congress I have great satisfaction in
being able to say tnao the general con
ditions affecting the commercial and
industrial interests of the United States
are in the greatest degree favorable.
A comparison of the existing condi
tions with' those of the most favored
precedent in the history of the coun
try will, I believe, show that so high a
degree of prosperity and so general a
difference of the comforts of life were
never before enjoyed by our people."
Then follows a long list of statistics
showing the amount of capital invested
in manufacturing enterprises now as
compared with 1880, the number of
mile3 of railway built in the same
period, etc. He leaves the public to
