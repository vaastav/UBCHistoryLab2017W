ON POINTS! OF LAW
Lengthy Arguments Made in the
Boniue Case Today.
IANY 9=T013 FOR THE JURY
Height the Pistol Was Held Sub
ject of.Much Discussion.
UNDER ADVISEMENT
When Justice Anderson ordered the ad
journment of Criminal Court this after
noon the third week of the Bonine murder
trial was ended. The indicafons are pro
pitious for the trial lasting' throughout the
coming week. The examination of expert
witnesses has dragged along wearily for
several days. due to frequent objections and
the arguments of counsel as to the rele
vancy or competency of certain testimony
sought to he adduced. Every point of impor
ti rce has been thoroughly contested by the
attorneyt on both sides. Just before the ad
journment of court on Saturday afternoon
,.f Jast week Attorney Keene addressed the
,jury. stating the points that the defense in
tended to prove. The defendant's counsel
are united in the belief that they have thus
far been successful in showing that Mrs.
Ronine could have had no motive for kill
ing James Seymour Ayres. Jr., other than
t protect herself when, according to her
confession, she was assaulted on entering
his room. They are coanfident they have
brought out the fact, substantiated by sev
eral witnesses, that the defendant's physi
cal condition was such that she could have
had no u-terior motive in entering the room
of the deceased.
Two expert witnesses have testified that.
by the surest tests known to science, blood
was found on the wrapper that, admitted
by both sides, Mrs. Bonine wore on the
- night of the tragedy.
Throughout the trial. which has attracted
the' attention of the whole country, District
Attorney Gould and his assistant, Mr. Tag
gart, have looked after the interest of the
government with recognized ability and
fairness. Mr. Douglass, the senior counsel
for the defense, with his assistants, Messrs.
Keene. Fulton and Leckie, have made a
strong fight to save the life of their client.
and have been equally fair and able in the
conduct of their side of the case. The fact
that Mrs. Bonine Is the first woman to be
tried for murder in the District of Colum
bia since the trial of Mrs. Surratt for com
plicity in the death of President Lincoln
has made the case one of more than ordi
nary local interest.
Even greater interest will be taken in the
arguments to the jury. Mr. Taggart will
make the-opening argument for the govern
ment. Hie will be followed by Mr. Fulton
and Mr. Douglass for the defense, and Dis
trict Attorney Gould will close for the gov
ernmi nt.
Imnsortant Point.
There wore some empty seats at the fore
noon session. and there was a noticeable
absence of women, who have been much in
evidence during the past few days. For
imer Coroner Carr was again called to the
stand to finish his examination. The most
important feature of the day was the argu
ment of counsel following the objection of
District Attorney Gould to a hypothetical
question interrogated by Mr. Douglass.
Justice Anderson recognized that an lim
portant law point was to be decided. and
that the arguments would take up con
siderable time. Out of consideration for the
jurors he ordered them taken to their room
pending the arguments and decision of the
legal points in dispute. Colonel Dan Rans
d-ll. sergeant-at-arms of the United States
S.nate. was an interested spectator, occu
pring a seat on the bench beside Justice
Anderson. Mrs. Bonine gave more than
ordinary attention to the argument of Mr.
Douglass. She was clad in the same brown
waist, navy blue jacket and skirt that she
ha, worn much of the time during the
trial.
Yesterday afternoon. when the court room
was crowded in the main with women, a
well-dressed woman accosted one of the
Justices of the Supreme Court of the Dis
trict of Columbia in the corridor of the city
hall, and. not knowing with whom she
was conversing, asked:
"Will you kindly tell me where the room
b is in 'Which Mrs. Bonine is being tried?"
.I will not." the justice responded firmly.
"And I will further say that the place for
you is at home with your family, if you
have one.
More Expert Testimony.
When the proceedings were resumed this
morning Attorney Douglass stated that he
desired to withdraw for the time being the
question that was under consideration yes
ttrday at the hour of adjournment and to
proceed with the examination of Dr. W. P.
Carr along different lines. The witness was
atsked if he had made any measurements of
Mdrs. Bonine. and he replied that he had.
Hecr height was five feet one and one-fourth
inches with her shoes on and four feet
'deven and three-fourths inches In her
:'ocking feet. Dr. Carr recited the results
of a large number of other measurements
of the deftendant which he had made.
"From the description of the hip wound
receivei by Ayres. as recited by Dr. Glaze
brook, can you tell the length of the leg
from th.- entrance to the wound to the bot
t.om of the foot?" Attorney Douglass asked
the witness.
United States Attorney Gould objected on
the groun~d that the question involved a
matter of calculation, and that any mem
ber of the jury was as competent to make
the calculation as was the witness.
Attorney- Douglass argued that the ques
tion was one of anatomy, and was clearly
and pu~rely within the scope of expert tes
tirsony.
"If the ansiter to the question is ma
terial."~ remarked the court, "does not its
-ele-vancy- go to the distance between the
floor and the point entered by the bullet?
I f that is so. you must know the position
of the leg when the shot was fired, and
then to assume it was in an upright posi
tio~n is to assume that the body ifas in an
oui'ght po'ition at the time."
The court had previously ruled that it
iN not for experts to go into the matter
'If the posture of the person firing the
shot and the posture of the person receiv
ing the same.
Replying to an inquiry of the court, Dr.
Car declared that being given only the
height o'f a person, and the location of a
wound. he could tell with approximate ac
euracy the distance of wound from the
bottom of the foot.
After lengthy argument, the question was
admitted. Dr. Carr gave as his opinion
that the distance from the point of en
trance of the wound in Ayres' left hip to
the bottom of the foot was 38%s inches.
Anethew- Asgument.
"Doctor.'' Attorney Douglass next asked,
"in your opiaion, what dIfference, if any,
would there be in the height or direction of
the wound, assuming that the party receiv
ing the wound is -eiter walking or run
ning?'*
An objection was entered by Mr. Gould,
and the court, after suggesting that the
?ssue be fully argued, permitted the jury to
retire from the room until disposition should
be made of the question.
In support of his contention, Attorney
.Douglass spcke for an hour, first dissecting
w'hat he claimed to be the government's
theory of the Icase. and later quoting a
large number of author'ities.
Mr. Gould. in replying, remarked that be
would make plain the manner in which the
case would go to the jury.
"Counsei has attempted to confine the
government to a definite theory," said Mr.
Gould. "My associate in his opening ad
dress did suggest a possible theory that
might be explanatory of the king. liar
Ung stated the facts ineidental to the trag
edy with the utmost frankness, he added
that most of the details of the namir were
onatters of mere peutmn. My amonet

death of Ayres was due to violeace, ad

The United Stat'e Attb'ney then proceeded
to read from authorities. In tpe midst of
his argument, It being 12:5 Vclock, the
court directed a recess for half an hour.
Point Under Debate.
The entire afternoon session of the court
was taken up with the discussion. United
States Attorney Gould speakng for nore
than half an hoiur in support of the eon
tention that the question was one for' the
jury, and was not a question for the ex
perts' opinion.
Attorney Douglass closed the debate,
again speaking at length. The court took
the matter under advisement, and at 2:W
o'clock an adjournment until 10 o'clock
Monday morning was taken. The jury did
not appear in the court room during the
afternoon.

Pabile Improvements.
Mr. George W. King, from the committee
on public improvement, read a letter from
the secretary of the board of Commission
ers, in reference to certain work scheduled
for Georgetown during the coming year,

with the wording of the letter: and showed
by figures taken from the annual reports
of the Commissioners for the years named
that something like $26.000 in the way of
unexpended balances remained to the credit
of this section, dating back to 18,49.
He further stated that Congress appro
priated so much for the specific improve
ments, which up to date have not been
touched, and the same streets are still
scheduled for improvement. The matter
created some discussion, and the committee
was instructed to continue in the work,
and if regarded to be necessary, to lay the
matter before Congress.
From the committee on public health Dr.
George Wood spoke of the need of having
physicians to the poor for West Washing

Hadley Doyle that the association approve

assist in the movement. The resolution
was passed.
Mr. J. W. Bogley reported that the
Georgetown and Tenleytown road officials
were willing to confer with citizens in rela
tion to the establishment of a parcel freight
system on their lines, and that the confer
ence will be held shortly.
A letter from the secretary of the board
of education was read, in which it was
stated that the present arrangement of
night schools, made for the purpose of con

Its character, will continue during the pres
ent school year. In accordance with these
plans there will be no night school in
Georgetown duirIng the current school term.

EXCITING TIMES DESCRIBED
The Navy Department has. made publip
the following extracts from the reports of
Capt. Perry of the Iowa, who had charge Of
the United States forces on the isthmu,
during the recent disturbance In that quar
ter, dated November 25:
"After the force was landed .at Piuan
Railroad Company's wharf yesterday after
noon I learned that Gen. Alben had gone
out on the regular train at 2:45 p.m. witA
00 troops.
"Later in the everiing tle train returned
to Panama,being-unable to-get througAp,4
cause just as soon as It stopped, near Rio
Grande Superior, the contending forces -en
gaged Immediately and the passengers
would have- been endangered had It gone
on. The train due to arrive at 6 p.m. from
Colon stopped at Matachin for the -lIht
for the same reason, so the Interruption of
the transit was complete.
"I decided to send an armed force of 150
out by the 8 a.m. train the next mofning
fthis Monday morning) to clear the line. So
an armored car was prepared during tWe
night and manned with part of a- company
and two Colt guns. This went ahead of
the engine, flying the United States- flag-,
The remainder of the detachment was In
the cars, with orders to permit no armed
persons to enter and under the command
of Lieut. Commander G. H. Peters, U-L N.
who is commanding the force on shore. I
accompanied the train.
The Railway Line Opened.
"By the time we reached Colon it was
completely understood from one end of the
line to the other in the future and while
this disturbance continues the trains would
be guarded by United States forces and-un
der the United States flag. On the Vgy
back to Colon the greatest respect was
shown and no objectionable act was com
mitted by either conservative or liberal sol
diers.
"I have arranged to have a United States
guard of forty on every passenger ffikfu
hereafter, which will insure order. anr
safety, without stationing any detachments'
anywhere except in Panama and Colon.
"I need no more force, either in ships or
marines, and am holding sufficient force In
reserve to meet any contingency likely to
arise.
"My frequent cablegrams since the last
weekly report have made you familfar-with
the essential features occurring during a
week of excitement an," agitation on- the
Isthmus, but In order to put you In p.a
session of a more comprehensive view of
the situation, I will detail at length the in
cidents as they have come to my under
standing.
Insurgents Capture Colon.
"As stated in my last report, Governor
Alban had left Panama by water with 800
troops on Sunday night, November 17, for
Chorrera to attack the liberal force en
camped there, supposed to be quite large.,
leaving in Panama only about 200 soldiers
with Senor Aristides Arjona, acting gov
ernor.
"There was An impression In Panama
that a decisive battle was impending be
tween these -two forces, and both on Mon
day and Tuesday there was an air in the
streets of expectancy, anxiety and possible
approaching disaster, but no news. 'Noth
ing had been heard from Alban up to Tue*
day night, when the regular train arrived
soon after 6 o'clock with the news that-ihe
train which left Panam at- 245 p.i. 'or
Colon was boarded near 'Mgtachln by about
150 liberals, who paid their fares to Gatin,
and cut telegraph wires, preventing tele
graphic communication between Panama
and Colon.
"It was afterwards learned that this de
tachment of liberals continued on the
north-bound train until just outside of Co
lon, where they descended, and keeping
close along by the cars in the darkness as
the train entered Colon, completely siir
prised the government guard and opened
fire. The totn soon fell Into their pos
session.
Notified the Acting Governor.
"I had gone on shore at daylight thefol
lowing morning (Wednesday) to Inform my
self as to the situation, and learned at the.
consulate general, at 5 o'clock, that the cut
wires were not yet repaired and there was
no telegraphic communication with Colon.
Went Immediately to the railway station
to find the. news confirmed, also that the
liberals wereo preventing liniemen from re
pairing wires. I then sent my first, cable
gram to the department.
"Afterward learned at consulate gen
eral that one rail had been re
moved during the night by lib
erals. Then made appointment to go with
cortsul general as early as the acting gov
ernor would receive us, to notify him of his'
obligation to protect the transit, In accord
ance with treaty.
"This reception took place soon after 9
o'clock, and while written letters werd bre
sented to the acting governor, stating the
case and requesting a reply, the matter
was discussed at length, and an -early an
swer requested. Made arrangements 'to
land forces, and send officer to Colon. -o
carry dispatch to commaanding officeer of
Machias, Instructing him to be pirepared s
land force and take possession of Gatun,
but not to act until further orders. '
"Officers also had instructions to see lib
eral leader and notify him that interfer
ence with transit -must immediately
cease. During afternoon received deaf~
ment's dispatch Instructing me to notify
all persons concerned, Including Insurgent
leader, that Interference must cease, otherz
wise land force, etc.
. Commniention Restored.
"The telegraphic communication with
Colon was restored during Wednesday
afternoon, and all trains were running oui
time and unmolested. Received a tele
gram from Lieutenant Commander Ma
Crea reporting condition at Colon and stat=
ing that he had landed a detachment qt
Machias' men to protect the railroad com
pany's property in Colon, which actli ,
approved.
"Completed arrangements for landing fpre.,
and felt that It was sufficient to me
any emergency likely to -arise;' with.te
Marietta due and the Cqncord to a~e

resolution called for the appointment of a

WROTE TO PRESIDENT.
Queer Aeties of Adrisa Piekhardt of
14ew Jersey.
A young man, who gave his name as
Adrian C. Pickhardt and said his home is in
Plainfield, N. J., was locked up at the sixth
precinct station this afternoon by Detective
Howlett, and the police surgeons were noti
fled to examine han to determine his men
tal as well as his physical condition.
He had been drinking, and the detective
feared he was on the verge of delirium
tremens. Pickhardt, who gave his age as
thirty-two years, has been writing letters
and sending messages to the President. To
Detective Howlett he declared that he Is
distantly related to President Roosevelt by
marriage, and under the circumstances he
thought there was no harm in requesting a
loan.
The money he wanted to pay his fare to
New York. and he promised faithfully to
send a check for the amount as soon as he
reached New York. A letter found on him
when he was searched at poice headquar
ters indicates that his checks are not worth
an Investment.
The letter was sent him by Thos. Costello,
a cabman. who inclosed a bill for cabhire.
a loan of $2.50 and 31.50, the amount paid
because of the protest of Pickhardts check.
In the letter Costello told Pichhardt that
he had driven him from 6:W a.m. until 7:W
p.m., had loaned him the amount stated
and accepted a check which proved to be
worthless. Two pawn tickets issued by
New York pawnbrokere showed that a suit
of clothes and a silver spoon had been
pawned for smal amounts.
Plckhardt had thirty cents in his pocket
when the oficer arrested him near the
Baltimore and Potomac depot. For sev
eral days the young man has bean loitering
about the depot and nearby hotels, and it
is said has indulged fa cab rides for
which he still owes the driver.. So far as
the detective could learn this afternoon
Pinkhardt wrote no letter. of a threatening
nature. Friends of the prisoner In New
Jersey will be informed of his arrest.

GENERAL MARKET REPORTS
SpeeLal Diftatcb to The eavmig Itar.
NEW YORK. December 7.-In the London
stock market today Americans opened
steady, but soon afterward weakened.
Prices, In the main however, were at about
a parity with our closing prices of yester
day. The coppEd shares in that market
continued to show weakness, Rio Tintos
declining to 41%. a lose ft a point from yes
terday. and Anaconda sold there equal to
11% as compared with 81% here yesterday.
In the local stock market the feature at
the opening was the demoralization ex
hibited in Amalgasmated Copper stock,
which, after opeisgt of &4 pints, de
clined steadily to 65, a drop of wi points
from yesterday's highest quotation.
As, heretofore, there was no news on
this specialty to account for the further
decline, and it looked as if the people who
have been predicting 4 for the stock were
nearer right than some of the Insiders
were when. according to rumor, predic
tions were freely distributed that the stock *
Would sell at IN-It was then around 12.
and that has not been many wceks ago.
either.
Considering the sentimental effect of this
great weakness in Amalgamated Copper.
the railroad list showed surprising resist
ance. Prices, as was to be expected, were
lower, but the losses in most cases were
not great, and those declines that extended
over 1 per cent occurred In issues that
have been marked up in the recent past by
manipulative pool tactics. Manhattan and
New York Central showed early losses ot
1% and 1%. respectively. The former, how
ever, regained most of Its loss on covering
of shorts.
Rock Island lost 1% after opening up %;
St. Paul and Union Pacific lost about 1%.
There was some disposition to buy stocks
after the first break. on the theory that the
market was becoming oversold, but the
Publication of the weekly bank statement,
showing an Increase of over five millions in
loans, and that the surplus reserve had
been cut In two, stimulated fresh sales for
both accounts, which was further aggra
vated by another collapse In Amalgamated
Copper stock, which sold at 6f 3-s. against
70 at the close yesterday.
The absence of support in this stock, ex
cept from the shorts covering, was accept
ed by many people as foreshadowing a re
duction in the next dividend payment.
New York Central was conspicuously
weak, losing nearly 4 per cent, and the de
cline was regarded as Indicating the post
ponement of the so-called Vanderbilt deal.
St. Paul lost over 2 per cent on western sell
ing.
Union Pacific resisted stubbornly around
'par, but fnally broke a little under that
price owing to persistent selling, Atchison
lost about 2 per cent. Notwithstanding in
side support Missouri Pacific was forced
down over 1 per cent, and after the first
hour of trading there were numerous de
clines of 1 per cent and over in the general
railway list.
Manhattan was very erratic, the fuctua
tions being frequent and wide apart, but
the stock finally closed practically un
chnged from the opening price.
In the industrial .- General Electric de
clined about 2% and Sugar 1%. A ne United
States Steel stocks, American Car and
Foundry and American Locomotive issues
all showed good resistive power, consider
ing the general weakness elsewhere In the
market. In the final dealings the covering
of short contracts caused a slight rally
from the lowest prices, and the general
market closed fairly steady.
Government bonds were unchanged; rail
road bonds fairly steady and showed ao
siderable activity.
The weekly bank statement follows:
Reserve, decrease, MSS,39, loans, in
crease, UaGM; specie, decrease, $U.4
