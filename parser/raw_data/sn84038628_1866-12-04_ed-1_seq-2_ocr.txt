RESTORATION'.
A review is tien madeof the facts set
forth in the last messaee. relative to the
measures which the executive had taken for
the eradual restoration el the southern
states to tbe Union, soon as appointing pro
visional governors, eto. Only one tbtug tnen
remained, the message sajs, to be done, and
that was the admission of loyal representa
tives to congress. This question was devolv
ed solely upon congress, . In the meantime,
the President says, no other plan having
been proposed, he continued his efforts to
perfeet restoration through the judicial, rev
enue and postal system of the country. The
south had Also ratified the amendment abol
ishing slavery ; conformed their social laws
to the fact ; repudiated the rebel debt, snd
proceeded, in good faith, to legislate tcr tbe
amelioration ot the eoiored race. The presi
dent then speaks as follows "CcEsress,
however, yet hesitated to admit any of these
states to representation, and it was cot until
the close ot tbe eighth month ot the session
that an exception was made in favor of Ten
nessee. I deem it a subject of profound re
gret that congress has thus tar failed to ad
mit to scats loyal senators and representa
tives from the other states, where the inhabi
tants, with those of Tennessee, had evgsged
in rebellion. Ten etates more than one
fourth of the whole number remain without
representation, Tbe ssats of fifty members
of the house, and twenty of the senate, are
yet vacant ; not by their own consent ; net
by a failure of election, but by the refusal of
congress to accept their credentials. Their
admission, it is believed, would Lave accom
plished much towards the renewal and
strengthening of our relations as one people,
nd removed serious cause for discontent on
the part of the people ot those elate?. . It
would have accorded with the great princi
ples enunciated in the declaration of Ameri
oan independence, that no people ought to
bear the harden cf taxation and yet be deni
ed the right of representation. It would
hare been in coneononoe wits the express
provisions of the constitution, that each state
shall have at least one representative, and
that no state, without its consent, fchail be
deprived of equal seffrare ia the senate. These
provisions were ictecdeil to secure to every state
the right of representation in congress, and so
important was it deemed by tbe fraiaera of the
constitution that tbe equality cf tbe states shall
be preferred in the seriate, that not even by an
amendment of the constitution can any ktatc,
w ithont its consent, bo denied a voice in that
branch of national legislation. It fcas ben as
sumed that these sutes, by rebellion, became
territories; but all departments cf the govern
ment, with great distinctness, refused to sanction
trj assumption so incompatible with tbe nature
of our republican system, and the professed ob
jects of the war. Throughout tbe recent legis
lation of congress, the urjeniable fact makes it
self apparent that these ten political commoni
ties are nothing less than states,'
The President then quotes the Crittsnden
resolution of 1S51, on the object of the war.
and reviews the legislation cf congress,
wherein tha etates are recognized ; and also
in Mr. Lincoln's proclamation. He then pro
ceeds again, as follows : "In tbe admission
of senators and representatives from all ot
the states, there can be no just grounds of
apprehension that persons who are disloyal
will he clothed with the powers of legislation,
for this eouid not happen when the consti
tution and the laws are enforced by a vigi
lant and faithful cungrese. Each house is
the judge of its own members. A senator,
or member, may be admitted or rejected, or
his credentials referred to a proper commit
tee. It admitted to a seat, it must be cc
evidence, satisfactory, that he possesses the
requisite loyal and constitutional qualifica
tions. If refused admission, and sent to his
constituents for want of due allegiance, they
are admonished that none bnt persons loval
to the United States will be allowed in the
councils of the station, and the political pow
er and moral influsnoe of congress are thus
effectively exerted in the ioterests of loyalty
to the government, and fidelity to the Union.
Upon this question so vitally affecting the
restoration of the Union, and the permanency
of our form of government, my convictions
heretofore expressed have undergone no
change, but, on the contrary, their correct
ness has been confirmed by reflection and
time, If the admission of loyal members to
eats in congress was wise and expedient a
year aja, it is no less wise and expedient
now. If this anomabus condition is right
now if in the exaot condition of these states
at the present time, it is lawful to eiolade
them from representation I do not see that
the question will be changed by the effect of
time. Ten yeare bence, if these etates re
main as they are, the right of representation
will . be no etrjnger, and the light of exclu
sion will be no weaker. Tha constitution
makes it the duty of the President v recom
mend to the consideration of oongreea SUCQ
measures as he shall deem expedient. I
know of no measure more imperatively de
manded by every consideration of national
interest, sound policy and equal justioe, than
the admission of loyal members from the un
represented states. It would consummate
restoration, renew vigor and stability, allay
doubt, induoe emigration, and open new
fields of enterprise."
- The President eonoludes on restoration by
repeating the warnings of others against a
consolidated despotism, and does not make
the slightest referenoe to the pending consti
tutional amendment, nor to the much talked
of amnesty and suffrage questions. All be
says of zesonstraction I have given verbatim.
MEXICAN AFFAIRS.
The President speaks as follows on Mexi
can affairs : "In the month of April last, as
congress is aware, a friendly arrangement
was made between the emperor of Franco
tad the President for the withdrawal from
Mexico of the French expeditionary forces.
inis withdrawal was to be eaeetea
detachments, the first of whh it was un
derstood was to leave Mexioo is November,
the second in March, the list 1 JNevam
ber, 1867. Immediately en : the cosaptetion
of the evacuation ht. F reach geveramsnt
was to assume the tame attitude ia regard U
non-intervention as held by the jr,0verment
of the United States. : Repeated assurances
have been given by the emperor: since that
agreement, that he would complete the pre
mised evacuation within the period named,
r even eooner. Ik was reasonable to expect
that the proceedings thus contemplated would
produce a crisis of great political interest in
the republic of Mexico. The nswly appoint
ed minister of the United State, Mr. Camp
bell, was therefore cent forward on Nov. 9,
to assume his functions. -It was also thought
expedient that he should be attended in
Msxioo,'by the -lieu tOBant- general of the
United States srnay, with, the view of ob
taining such information as might be x im
portant to determine the coarse to be pur
sued by the United States, in reestablishing
and maintaining necessary and proper inter
course with Mexico . " s - - - - - -
I Deeply interested in the course cf liberty
and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on
Our patt to exercise whatever influence we
possessed fcr the restoration and permanent
establishment ia that ceufitry f a democratic
and reoubUoan form, of government, Such
was thetwnditien of affairs in" regard loHex-
ico, when, on the 22d day of November, of
ficial inferasation was received from Paris
that the Emperor had some time since decided
not to withdraw a detaoarnent of his forces
in the month of November, ' according to
agreement : but that this decision was made
for the nuroose ot withdrawing the whole cf
these forces in the ensuing spring. Of this
latter determination, however, the United
States has received no notice or intimation,
and, so soon as information was received
from this government, care was taken to make
known its dissent to the Emperor of France.
I cannot forego the hope that France will re
consider the subject, and adopt 6ome resolu
tion in regard to the evacuation of Mexico
which will conform to the existing engage
ment, and meet the expectations ot this gov
ernment. - The documents on the subject will
be laid before congress. With the evaauation
of Mexico by the French, no serious differ
ence between France and the United States
would remain."
OCR RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN.
Oa oar relations with Great Britain, the
President writes as follows : "It is a matter
of regret that no considerable advance has
been made toward an adjustment of the dif
ferences between tbe United States and Great
Britain, arising cut of the depredations on
our commerce, and other trespasses commit
ted during the civil war, by British subjects,
in violation of international law and treaty
obligations. The delay, however, may be be
lieved t have resulted in no small degree
from the domestic situation cf Great Britain.
An entire change of ministry occurred in
that country during tbe last session of parlia
meat. The attention of tbe new ministry
was called to the subject, at an early day,
and there is some reason to believe that it
will be oocsidsred in a beooming and friendly
spirit. Tte importance of aa early deposi
tion ot the subject cnrt be exaggerated.
Whatever might be tbe wishes cf the govern
ment, it is manifest that good feeling and
friendship between the two countries cannot
be established until a reciprocity in the prac
tice cf good faith and neutrality shall be re
stored between tha respective nations."
THE FENIAN INVASION' OF CANADA.
The President then alludes to the fenian
invasion cf Canada as a violation of the neu
trality laws. and to the proclamation which be
issued, and the trial and sentence of captured
lenians, and says: "Sa?h representations
have been made to Great Briuia tswill, it
is hoped, induce judicious amnesty to all ho
were engaged ia the invasion."
COXCLCDIXG REMARKS.
After referrrcg briefly to th- annual te
ports, and reoommendmg that tbe District cf
Columbia be allowed a delegate in congres?,
the President concludes as iol.'cw : '-In the
performance of a duty imposed bj the consti
tution, I have tbus submitted to the repre
sentatives of tbe states and the people euch
information cf our domestic and foreign af
fairs as the public interest may require.
Oar government is now undergoing its mott
trying ordeal, and my earaess prayer is that
the peril may be successfully and final! v
parsed without impairing its original strength
and symmetry. The ictererts cf tbe nation
ere beet to be prometei by tbe revival of fra
ternal relations, the complete obliieratica of
our past differences, i.nd the inauguration of
ail the pursuits of peace. Directing our ef
forts to the accomplishment of these fret
finds, let us endeavor t-j preserve fcarmcrsy
between tbe co-ordinate departments of the
government, thtt each, in its proper sphere,
may e'rdialiy co-rperate with the other in sh
earing h maintenance cf the constitution,
the preservation of the Union and the perpet
B.lty offree institutions.
