Monument to the Maryland
Pilgrims. —Aa the 25th of March.
1884, wilt ba tha 250th an oi Ternary of
tbtlMtn* of I WMaryt**l Pilgrims
at tit. Mary'*, it ia proposed in Balti
more circlee to prospect for fund* to
erect a monnateot io that city to com
memorate the act. It was contem
plated originally, it aeenM, to locate
the monument el or near tba spot in
ibia county vrliera the Pilgrims ac
tually landed, bat Baltimore, we
learn, baa now been substituted, and
it ia in that city that tba proposed
meioment in lo be ereoted. It im
premm us as quite an original idea to
erect a monument lo perpetuate the
memory of en act an hundred or
more milts distent from the place
where it occurred and in preference
to the piece ittelf. Bt. Mary’s rirer
is indeed remote from the centres of
'
population, but that it is difficult of
'I come, we deny, and cite the Cheas
|ake, tba Potomac and St. Mary’s
, river as evidence of the fact. Our
local feeling may somewhat warp oar
judgment, but we certainly think
that a monument to commemorate the
landing of the Pilgrim Fathers would
devalop deeper feeling*, and ba more
appropriate and impressive, if located
on the banka of tbo tic. Mary’s- than
at any other point in the State.
Tub President's Message.— The
meaiMga of President Arthur was sent
to Congress on Tuaaday of last week.
It ia unpartizan, of readable length,
plain apoken "sufficiently compreben
ahre, and to the point. Among its
recommendations ia one that prompt
a tops should be taken to construct an
interior coast line of defence by wa
ter ways acrom the peninsula of Flori
da. along the coast of Florida to Hamp
ton Honda, between the Chesapeake
Bay and Delaware river and through
Capa God. The President opposes
any redaction in the revenues of the
government He recommends that
the rejected trade dollar be taken by
themintaanddspositorieeaabullion at
slight discount upon silver. Tl a Sec
tetary of the Treasury proposes that
the trade dollar, he exchanged for
the legal tender dollar, dollar for
dollar, and he I hns driven from circu
lation. The President wants $60,-
I*oo,ooo taken from thg surplus in
the treasury to rehabilitate the navy.
He does not look with favor upon the
proposed postal telegraph. He in
vitee Congrnm to extend educational
facilities in portions of the country
where gient illiteracy exists. He
wants Congress to rejeal the act mak
ing Utah a territory and to assume
control over the Mormons by means
of a Commission to blot oat polygamy.
He recommends that Congress should
paas laws to protect people from the
injustice practiced by railway corpo
rations in freight charges and closes
his message by suggesting to Congress
the passage of a new Civil righte bill
gnaranteeiag colored people the rights
which were intended to be secured
them by the 14th Amendment.
Though wide differences of opinion
undoubtedly exist as to tba merits of
some of the President's suggestions,
none of them have yet been assailed
by the democratic pram either in a
hostile or captious spirit.

"TrilK Alewife. —la tha Easton
Jjedgcr, of late date, appears as en
tertaiaing article on “The Fish called
Alewife.” As oar people are inter
ested ia anything that pertains to
tha fish, wa reproduce parts of it, pre
miaiag, that a few years ago, a news
paper article on this alewife would
have occasioned the remark, that the
writer was hard poshed for a subject.
Than, although the good qualities of
the alewife as a manure wee well
knows la tide water farmers, it had
not begun to be worked op as a com
mercial fertiliser, and a large ‘school"
of thane hah was not, ns now, a rare
sight m our waters. The common
alewife has bow become a tish of liter
ature, and “grave writers are search
ing his haunts, _ investigating his
habits, following with the pen bis
pursuers, and writing him up gener
ally from his cradle in the great deep
to his grave as a fertiliser in the fox
mom* field*’*
The ioWper goea on to say; “Ale
wife our fecund fish is celled ia the
Dataware sad Chase yaks bays, (cor
rupted into old-wife by the fishermen,)
I mt hie adtnliflc name ia Breuomiia

devil cnee tech the shape of
an alewife or aosabuaher when he
aaiaad Antony Van Coilaor, the tram
Wer. • v-laird in Knickerbocker's
history of New York.
44 ‘lt was a dark and stormy night
, ■■ I . I 11 Lf! 1 1 .■
when the good Antony arrived at the
creak, sagelv denominated Harlem
River, which separates Manhattan
from the mainland. The wind wa*
high, the elements in pm uproar sod
no Charon could be found to ferry the
adventurous sounder of brass across
the water. For a short time he re
posed like an impatient ghost upon
the brink, and thtfh, bethinking him
self of the urgency of hi* errand, took
a hearty embrace of his atone bottle,
swoie most valorously that he would
swim acrom in spite of tha dayjl, and
daringly plunged into tha chasm. An
old Dutch burgher, famed for his ver
acity, averred t hat he saw the day vai
in the shape of a huge moes-bunker,
tries the sturdy Antony by the leg
apdf drag him beneath the wave*
Nobody ever attempts to swim across
the river after dark; Mid as to the
moee-bankers, they are bald in such
abhorrence that no good Dutchman
will admit them to hia table who
loves good fish tnd hates the devil.*
“The alewife is now serving a more
practical purpose than lending hip
aelf to the writers of ihsse old tradi
tions. The range of Ibis fish extends
from the Bey of Fnndy to tbo St.
John’s river, Florida, aod all down
this coast line there are fish factories
where the menhaden are worked np
into oil and qpmmercial fertilisers,
am) from the fiffit of April Uktbe firaf
of November thousands of men are at
work catching the fish by the millions.
Tha trade report for 1881, for instance,
places the alewife catch at 454,192,-
000 fish. A vast amount of capital
ia invested in this industry- There
have been fears that the menhaden
schools would be destroyed bv the
progrees of this industry, and* with
their disappearance from our coast,
beya and rivers, would disappear also
those fish, notably the tailor or blue
fish, which feed upon the alewife; bat
this is not likely to happen, at least
foi yean to coma, u the fecundity of
the alewife is wonderful. Some au
thorities say that two millions of eggs
have been taken from a single fish.
The number used, or that can be used,
by the factories, is a very small frac
tion of the immense number that
•warm on the Atlantic coast, within
tba limits above named every season;
and a not much larger fraction of the
number destroyed by other fish every
year. Professor Baird, a recognized
authority on all fish subjects, esti
mates that tan thousand millions of
•lewivea are deatroved daily by blue
fish alone during the seraou of four
months on tba New England coast;
•ad Profeasor Goode, reasoning upon
Professor Baird's data, concludes that
in tha whole range of the ale-wife and
in tba season of six months three
thousand billions of alewives are an
nually destroyed."

Mweru. Editors:—ln perusing the
interesting columns of the Beacon of
the 6(h inri., we see that our odorif
erous friend, “H. B.,’’ (which is “Hot
Box' ) has again fallen into error—
this time by accusing usof havingsug
rd “the removal of the present
i which is postmaster) at Bt. Clem
ent's Bay. We simply called atten
tion to a communication published in
the Enterprise, in which the writer
(not we) suggested a change in that
office because of alleged irregularities
and pious mismanagement of the pre
sent incumbent. But seeing the bat
tering requirements named for a more
suitable "r, Mv’ (which is postmaster)
we did think we would taka time by
the fore-lock, as "they" say, in behalf
of that suffering community, and es
pecially in the interest of THE “gen
tleman" who, abova all others of our
limited acquaintance in that “delive
ry," seemed so admirably qualified to
fill the bill, thinking, of course, that
the influence of our “more fortunate
iierternity," as his old and familiar
'friend, would be acceptable and suf
ficient in accomplishing the change
suggested by that aggrieved corres
pondent. We had, and have, no pre
judice against the present “honest,
competent aod trustworthy" P. M. at
that office (the complaint referred to
teemed lo be based upon the fact that
there was a superabundance of these
good qualities exercised there, especi
ally on JSkmdoye) and while we nave
not the pleasure of his personal ac
quaintance, we are persuaded that he
nor the many other postmasters pos
sessed of the same commendable vir
tues Mid resident of the county will
not feel over flattered at tha easy and
pleasing (to H. B.) “requisites for a
firat-ol&as postmaster" which he deems
so essential, via.; “no conscience, plen
ty of bran and little sense," in the
first of which, at least, H. B. seems to
abound. Indeed, neither may they
feel much complimented by hia mod
est disclaimer of having “fallen so
low" as lo apply for or accept an of
fice—even a poatoffioe—at the hands
of the present regime; and it ia to ba
hoped tha t these gentlemen in your
county who have so long and faith
fully occupied offices under “the pre
sent regime'* will not ba so regardless
of the public good, under a sense of
•elf-reapect, as to resign because, for
sooth, through the kind information of
H. 8., they may suddenly discover their
sad and fallen estate. Oh! H. 8., H.
8., thou odoriferous “Hot Box." don’t
be an sensitive in your nobler feelings,
nor ao very fastidious with your offi
cial aaeociatioas! And for the public
weal, do not bo so reckless ia your
pleasing sad bock-handed compli
ments lo your “honest and trustwor
thy" neighbors. Aod should you
ever fail ao low aa to apply for an of
fice at tha “sticky hands ’ of the pre
sent regime, (and you may yet ia this
particular oaaa, it wan the offioe rath
er sashing the man.) don't you know.
H. 8.. that the recommendation of “a
gee llamas." while t>eiag*meoh mors
difficult tor you to obtain, would not ba
aa potent and appropriate, ia your
oaaa, aa the power and influence of
our “more fortunate paternity," who
ia an much batter qualified lo rightly
appreciate and more clearly represent
your charming qualities and fitness
for office under the present or any
"other regime f While recognizing the
bopfelMMHW* of onr chance in a com
petition with you. H. 8., under tha
*oi* requirement named in tha origi
nal proposition. yat it would afford on
great pleasure to accept the appoint
ment, io case of a vacancy, with the
•seared “emoluments" appertaining
thereto; but at present we have other
more pleasing engagements closer io
“headquarters. ’ where the coveted op
portunities “to capture the letters and
appropriate their content#" are more
fnqneot wed remunerative. And be
ing a non-resident of that “delivery,”
we are not eligible to tha position ao
kindly tendered; besides, wa don’t
think wa can measure up to the spe
cifications aa well aa yourself (which
is manifest) for it ia not so much the
“fear of the devil”—even your “hon
est" one—that would prompt us to ba
“honest and trustworthy" in tha dis
charge of onr duties, either private or
official, as it would baa regard for ths
commands of Him. who save, “Thou
shalt not bear false witness," (Exodus,
xx-16) to which we have before vain
!v called your neglected attention.
By the way, H, 8., (which ia “Hoi
Box") isn't it about time for “that
particular letter’’ to torn up? Let
us and the anxious public know when
the disconsolate wanderer returns,
either with or wilbont its “bard-
or “ill-gotten hoard." Til!

IN MEMORY OF RICHARD H. REEDER.
Daring the present year death has token
from enr midst revere! of the most worthy and
respected'citizens of our county. The reflect
ing portion of their surviving fellow-citizens
pay a just tribute to their character for useful
ness and exemplary conduct, but who cau ful
ly describe the lasting sorrow and affliction
which the melancholy sepnmlioo caused in
tba family circle in which they were so beloved
nod honored.
The death of Richard H. Reeder causes re
flection (not upon the brevity of life, for be
was well advanced ia years f luit upon the
lust which n community suffers alien men
such • he are taker, from them. I have fre
quently len present when Mr. Reeder has
been the subject of conversation, and all joined
in the declaration that he was a man of most
estimable cbarKCtsr. I know of no man more
worthy of such ezpren-ioa. for he had many
admirable traits. In my judgment, Mr. Ree
der pasmreed the attributes of a perfect gen
tleman. He was well educated, intelligent,
well-informed, friendly, hospitable and with
all. modest, engaging and of becoming man
ners. Those who were intimate with him,
I amine bis friends, and no one properly con
stituted ron'd be bis enemy. Notwithstand
ing the gentleness of his manners, there was
a becoming spirit of independence in tbs main
tenance of bis opinions, for reflection formed
his com id ions, nod they guided him ia bis
dur.
Mr Reeder, although well qualified, never
pspired to or sought public office—indeed, tba
means by which public trusts have been at
tained were repulsive to him. la such a po
sition, however, be would hare given lo the
public the benefit of a writ-informed mind a
Ei*d judgment and a conscientious, honest
art. The only public position lie ever oc
cupied was one to which be was summoned
by constituted authority as a worthy citizen
The Jury has been hy some denomiaaltd ll e
ptludinm of onr rights, and when we consid
er the highly important duties nt a Juror, the
designation appears to be deserved The lift,
liberty, prosperity of the citizen and almost
everything we value, as also the preven'ion of
crime, generally come under the supervision
of and are affected hy the verdict of a J ary ■
Reflection cannot but display the value'of
good and faithful Jurymen. If there ever was
amongst ns n Juror of more mine to the pub
lic than Richard B. Reeder. I have not been
able in a long practice nt the bar in oar Court
to discover him. Juries made up of such men
are invaluable.
Mr. Reeder. I am informed and believe,
lived and died a stacereand fisitlifn! Chris
tian, nod was hopeful of a Blessed Home be
yond ths grave, through tbs merits of bis Re
deemer. This well bared hope no doubt min
gles much comfort with the grief st their se
pontioa of bis truly pious widow sod daugh
ter, who dearly loved him, and to whom ho
was a devoted husband nod lather.
In Uiis brief testimonial of the worth of my
dcnnrtad friend, I have said nothing bat what
I bri&eve just and true, and I feel confi leot
that those who knew Mr. Reader well wUI
confirm my estimate of his character.
