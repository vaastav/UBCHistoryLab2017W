diplomatic gallery had been ohanged aver tc the
of the hall, while to the right of the re
porters' gallery a special flection had been set
ftpuvTi fcr the families of members of Congress.
The Tapirters' gallery, an usual on important

the usual crowd of bummers, loafers and mis

f CLERK M'PILEKSON RAVPED TO CRDTR
and ca'ied the roll. Nearly every member was in
Ills pie ce. The Louisiana members and two dis
tricts from Arkansas and two Irom West Y irginia
were omitted as lacking the usual prirci facie
oare. As soon as"this form was concluded Mr. May

another and different purpose. This carried, Mr.

nated Fernando Wood, while the spectators looked
lor tl e democratic bolt which, It was reported,
wss oout to be disclosed. After a pause Mr. Hol
mur. nominated Mr. Cox, of New Y'ork, who briefly
declined.
THE VOTE WAS THEN TAKEN
. and exhibited a good deal ol discipline in the re
publican side of the House. Blaine received every
republican vote in the Chamber, and also two libe
ral republican?namely, Eroinberg's, of Alabama,
and General Bannlng's, of Ohio. Whitehonse.

the irate and determined Holman. Mr. Stephens
wu3 complimented with a vote, and Mr. Wood, of
New York, voted for Heyeri-r Climer, ol Pennsyl
vania, receiving himself nearly the entire demo
cratic vote?77 in number. The bolt-tad evidently
fizzicd out.
BLAINE WAS NOW ESCCETEP TO THE CHAIR,
and his speech was one et the moat noteworthy
events of the day?clear, genial and with a broad
patriotic ring that made a good platform from
?which to bound lightly into the Presidential race.
The impression on the President makers in lront

of New York, a siern loe to such monopolies,

LOCATINO TTIE SEATS
By a propot and graceful courtesy exception
were made in favor ol Mr. Dawes as the senior
member of the House and Mr. Stephens by reason
of his age, to fir ml ties and long services, and thus
those gentlemen had the plates they warned. The
reet had to abide the lottery. Mes<rs. Negley,
Eld ridge and Scofleld came early and
oicked good places. Mr. Laruar took Mr.
Beck s scat and held It ror him till bis turn
came. Holman and Mll'on Taylor had good
luck. Mr. Ciymer purposely look a back ?cat, as
did Mr. Harlay, while Mr. uat'lcia bad to do the same
from mcessUy. Mr. Batler came late, and finding
all the jood seats op the radical side occupied,
marched over, amid general laughter and ap
plause, yid took up his quarters among the de.
raot-acy. Messrs. Maynard and Hyoper had to
'ollow suit.
THE ONLT 9CENB
that disclosed any party feeling during the day
grew nut 01 the resolve ol the republicans to send
the case of Messrs. Shanks and Kna-pp, from the
Ninth dvtrlctoJ Indiana, to the Committee on Elec
tions. ip vain did tne democracy insist and nrgo
that Mr. Knapp had a prima facts case; in vain did
? hey ask for time. The confllet led to two yea
?ml nay votes at a season when all were wearied
out and hungry, but the republicans triumphed,
of course, in the end.
VARIOUS COMMENTS
'are made on the day's proceedings-one, that there
publicans, having a large majority, will role
rough shod over their oppopeuts, and thus create
? bitter ami ugly feeling during the session; the
ether, nvv a distinguished democrat. is a lament

A tvosy Day la tbe Senate.
The meeting of the Senate to day, save that It '
'?as the beginning of a new Congress, did not
possess any more real interest than during
a proBy debate. Senator Carpenter presided most
of tiro time the Seuate was in session. Senator
Runner waa congratulated on all sideB for Irs re
covery and vigorous appearance. Senator Brown
low. still feeble ami irrtrm, was in his seat. The
caucus to-morrow will not, It Is thought, change
*ny of the committees. The election of an execu

and a chaplain are fhe only offices to be Ailed.
Unimportant Uiplomntlc Correspondence
ArrompsnyUg the President** A1 es
se ge?Secretary Fi*H'* Lilt Instruc
tions to Minister Sickles Itt Behalf of
the Cuban Insurgents.
Toe diplomatic correspondence accompanying
the President's Message is, so far as the printed
volume goes, unimportant, and does not relate to
the more recent action of our government In regard
- to Spanish rnle in Cnba. In a letter addressed
' by Secretary Fish to Minister Sickles
August 27 last?he says that "previous
despatches from Madrid are not calculated to com
mand confidence in the expectation of a satisfac
tory settlement ot the troubles in which Spain
fLr.de herself involved, either In respect to her
ltiternal or colonial atfhlrs or her relations with
ether Powers. As to the former wo can bnt sin
cerely regret that the effort to establish
a republican form of government does not give
greater promise of success. The United States
promptly and cordially extended its recognition
and the moral effects of its sympathy to the new
government. It hn9 further manifested Its
friendly interest by abstaining from Insistence m
the presentation of complaints, on account of the
frequent failure of compliance with assurances
of Intended reiom In the government
of Cuba and of the reparation of wrongs done to
the persons and property of American citizens.
Keoent information from Havana shows that the
decree for the release of the embargoed estates
had not at a very late date been proclaimed,
and that influence seemed to be at work
to induce the withholding of the publication
and the consequent nullification of the de
cree. ? ? ? The President has heard with
deep concern and regret the announcement said
to be made by a member of the Ministry of Spain,
that no reforms will be granted and no notice
taken of the demands of the Insurgents In Cuba as
long as they do not lay down their arms. ? ? ?
In the interest of Spain no less than
In that of Cnba; in .the interest of
the United States in the Interest of humanity. The
President hopes that such may not be the deter
mination of Spain, and yon will not fall to urge
upon the Ministry the tendency of such policy and
the Importance in this direction of pacification and
, the arrest of the further destruction of
property an<i the waste of human life;
of the disavowal or abandonment of a
policy so inconsistent with the possibility
of a restoration of peace. ? ? ? it is, therefore,
that It appears to us, as friends of Spain, of urgent
importance that Spain, in the exercise of her
historic wisdom, voluntarily recall the incon
siderate declaration of a Minister (ir, indeed, it
were made), that the granting of reforms to Cuba
will not be entertained while the Insurrection
lasts, and the President desires that you impress
in a friendly and delicate way, the paramount im
portance of action rather than promise in the di
rection of reforms, of wulch the wisdom of the
government at Madrid have more than once re
cognized the propriety."
The subsequent correspondence with our Minis
ter at Madrid relates more directly to the exlstlte
troubles in the island of Cuba, and is reserved to
accompany a message to Congress whenever the
present negotiations are regarded as settled.
Attorney General Williams To Be Chiel
Justice.
During the session of the Cabinet to-day the
President formally tendered to Attorney General
Williams the position of Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, that gentle
man, as he afterwards said, having received no
previous Intimation of the designation. Judge Wil

The Cabinet met at half-past eleven o'clock, all
the members being present, an 1 remained in ses

pectation of receiving the Joint committee of the
Benate and ilonse of Representatives instructed
with the dnty of informing the President
the two houses had organized, and were prepared
to receive any communication he might be pleased
to make them. The committee not appearing by
half-past three o'clock, a telegram was sent to the
Capitol inquiring into the Rtate of aifairs in Con
gress, and on receipt of the reply the
private secretary of the President iniormed
the gentlemen of tne press in waiting
for copies of the Message that the
document would Dot be sent to Congress until to
morrow. They bad beeu there at least three
hours, besides a full force of operators were at the
instruments in the telegraph office to transmit the
message over the wires, and they were similarly
disappointed, but there Is no question the docu

tweive and one o'clock to-morrow.
Secretary Richardson's Report.
Secretary Richardson had sent advance copies
of his financial roport to New York, Philadelphia
and Boston to be distributed to the press at the
time the President's Message should be delivered to
Congress; but, owing to the President's Message
not having been communicated to Congres to-day,
the Secretary this afternoon telegraphed to the
government officers having his report in charge to
retain u until to-morrow.

Important Meeting of the Committee of
One Hundred?A Mandamus To Be Ap
plied for to Compel the Throwing
Open of the Boohs.
The Newark Citizens' Committee of One Hundred
held an Important special meeting last night. The
attendance, both of members and of citizens, was 1
unusually large, and nrnch enthusiasm and earnest
ness was manifested in the proceedings. A cor;
rcspondence was read between the Chairman or
the committee and Mayor Kicord, in wnich the
Mayor was earnestly requested to exercise nls
authority In compelling the officials to throw open
their books to the committee. The Mayor's reply
was a shifting, wishy-washy letter, setting
forth his earnest desire to aid the committee, but i
promising no action. It was of the old Dackboneless
stripe. The committee on Auditor's accounts pre
sented a report, which was unanimously adopted,
utterly disposing of the semi-official explanations
by the officials of the exposures tn former reports.
A committee was appointed to consult legal ad
vice in regard to going before the conrts and ap
plying for a mandamus to compel the officials to
throw open their books.
Chairman Courier made a stirring speech, in
which he clearly showed that If t e credit ol the
city was Injured the blame rested on the officials.
AN ADDRESS
to the citizens at large was reported upon favor
ably by a sueoial committee and ordered issued.
The address is a calmly worded and careiully
condensed resume' of the work accomplished by the
committee from Its organization two and a hall
mouths ago up to the date ol the arrogant refusal
of City Auditor Dawes to allow the Committee of
Experts to examine his accounts, Ac,,
the object of the committee lelng to state direct
to the people in Its own language the pith of what
has been discovered. The reason given is that the
local press has been divided seriously In Its treat
ment of the committee and its work, the greater
portion treating it most unfairly, and the
lesser portion too kindly, perhaps, according
as it best suited the policy of the papers.
"In the first place," says the address, "It must be
kept steadily in view that the committee was com
missioned by the people to make a thorough lnvos
1 tigation into the financial and other department
1 affairs of the city, and to see whether the people's
I work had been doue properly and honestly?not as
some persons seem to thtnk, to act as public prose
cutors and convict certain persons of s>tate prison
offences." Then follows a brlei and succinct state
ment of what lias been discovered by the commit
tee In regard to the finances. "The committee,"
says the addre?s, "through Its sub-commit tee on
auditor's accounts, has discovered ample evidence I
to warrant it in making the following positive
statement, to witThat on a comparison alone of
the printed reports of officials there have been
found a series ot bond and balance discrepancies
which are
GROSSLY AT VARIANCE
with good, plain, simple and honest business con
duct?discrepancies, which. It found by any Armor
corporation In the accounts oi their servants,
would surely result In their being discharged and
branded, at least, as incompetent." The result of
the Investigation in financial matters is summed
up in the statement "that the conduct and man
agement of the financial affairs or the city, at least
in many notable instances, have not been in ac
cordance with good business principles or even
with law." Regarding its revelations on the
transactions ol commissioner "Joe" Young, It is
set forth that enongli evidence has been discov
ered "to show conclusively that the knowledge
obtained by Mr. Y'oung tn his capacities as a paid
city official has been frequently used, not tor the
best interests of the city and citizens generally,
but lor the personal interest
AND MONETARY PROFIT
of a few persons, past and present city officials
and their connections, and that, too, In a manner
that. If not positively punishable by law as a crime,
Is, to say the least, unjust, scandalous and dis
graceful In the worst degree." It closes with an
appeal for continued co-operation on iha part of
citizens.
