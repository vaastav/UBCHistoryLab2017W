THE HAYES ADMINISTRATION.
Never in the days of American
politics, except perhaps in the time
of Tiler, was there such a mix of
political views as now pour over the
land. The peace which the country
longed for, and which the Radical
leaders so loudly promised should
follow a quiet acquiescence in the de
cision of the fraudulent Electoral
Commission, seems to-day more dis
tant than ever. Nor can the respon
sibility of this present and increasing
uncertainty be laid at the door of the
Democratic party. ; It has filled the
measure of patriotic sacrifice and
forbearance. The Republican party
and its leaders must be held account
able for whatever of dissension and
disaster shall flow from the anoma
lous condition of affairs now existing
in the country. Having fraudulent
ly secured the election of Hates to
the Presidential chair, by means too
well known to be forgotten, the Rad.
ical leaders are suddenly awakened
to the fact that they have the wrong
man. At first they spoke jocosly of
his country notions, and contcmptu
ously of his rural statesmanship;
then ridiculed his Platonic theories
of government and his visionary
ideas of administration. Now, how.
ever, they are ready to charge him
with betrayal of the wolfish mother
that nursed him, snd with conspiring
to destroy the political organization
whose accidental representative he
was, that he might build from its
broken ruins a party more willing to
do his behests.
We do not understand Hates. He
has neither the ability" nor the cour
age to become the leader of a new
party, nor does he or his intimate ad'
risers for one moment seriously con
template such a step. The simple
truth is this. By the Electoral Cora
mission fraud, Hates suddenly, and
to his utter surprise, found himself
the unlawful occupant of the seat of
a man whom the people had selected
for their Chief Magistrate by more
than a quarter of a million majority.
A more conscientious man - might
have hesitated to accept office under
such circumstances. A bolder man
might have braved tie contempt and
despised the opposition of his politi-
cal opponents. , But Hates was nei
ther delicately sensitive nor sternly
brave. He was simply cunning. He
rolled the responsibility of the Re
turning Board rascality upon tne
shoulders of a doubtfully constituted
commission, whose partisan decis
ions made the triumph of fraud pos
sible bv refusing to let truth and
honesty combat it Suddenly, how
ever, he found himself walled in
obstacles unforseen. He was hedg
ed by the threatened anarchy of the
South.' bv the restlessness of the
North, by the solid Democratic ma
jority in Congress. Under such cir
cumstances a partisan policy was
simply an impossibility. It could
not have lived upon such a sea for
single month. In this strait Hates
bethought him of his letter of accep-1
tance, a aocument nevet intended
him, or' his trainers in the political
ring, and with its sugared plums be
gan a season of political coquetry
that-would have shamed a Dodge
Venice in the middle ages. It was
here that the rupture between Hates
and his party began. He courted
the South, and his party divorced
him from bed and board. The South
spurned his tender advances, and
the rejected aspirant stood out in
cold alone. Civil Service was sent
up like a rocket and went out
shame, and now his truckling sub
serviency to the Shylocks of the conn
try is the last feather that will sink
the fraudulent and rotten adminis
tration into the depths of contempt.
In Ohio, the militia of the first
class, who are liable to do duty, un
der all circumstances, numbers 366.
429. In the second class, which
liable in certain cases to duty,
number 63,158, making a total
nearly a half million-' men.
On the subject of civil service Mr,
Hates is not so happv. He deals
the stale clap-trap of Curtis and
man milliner school of politicians
without enough of animation thrown
in to lead us to think that he belives
his own theories. This part of h
message is confronted with an array
of facts well known to the country
which puts the stamp, if not of false
hood, at least of insincerity upon
every word and line on this subject.

the Hon. Thomas M. Brown, mem-

works for western interests, on the
financial question of relief he. says:;
I am a republican, but as you
know am not in accord with the ad-
ministration on the currency ques-
tion. I may say in passing that the
resumption act will be neither re-
nor materially modified; nor
will any bill remonetizing silver and
restoring it to its old place in the
money of the nation become a law.
The senate and the administration
stand sternly and inflexibly opposed
all financial legislation that looks
toward any interference with exist-
ing laws. We must get ready for
gold payments in 1879, for it must
come. If you noticed my record you
know how deeply 1 regret that events

ted.

adds one more proof to what we have
always said, that the legislation

The above from the Indanopolis

journal has a lively appreciation
the Golden Calf business of the Rad
ical party. But there is one consola

ucn a thing as this was not heard
of during the days of carpet-bag rule
in the South. No sooner, however,
is a Democratic home-rule establish-

a land pleasant and desirable to live
in. Under Republican carpet bag
rule, the Northern people and news-
papers maintain that a Northern
man could not live there nt all. We
have always thought that it made
great difference what kind of rulers
a people had; and here we hare

But he
says neither congress nor its crea

that the federal government which

made by this de-facto government;
that the fraud was without remedy,

It is surprising that Justice Strong,
holding the views he here avowp, did
not vote in tavor of awarding ote of
the Oregon votes to Tilden. . That
vote was certified under the seal of
the state to have been cost for Til

neither congress nor the electoral
commission nad any rig lit to en be-
hind the certificate nnd inquire into
the state elections for electors, yet
he waived his stiff state-rights rule
in the case ot Uregon, which he re-
fused to waive in the case of Louis

This is the exact truth in a nut
shell; and, if Hayes had so declared
when he took the oath of office, he
would have been in a different posi-
tion from what he is now. On the
touther question, he is doingexact-
ly what the democrats pledged the'ni
selves to do, but he uttered no such
sentiments when a candidate, and he
is now acting in direct opposition to
the known and expressed wishes of
those who voted for him. If he had
the manhood to declare that he has
become a convert to democratic prin
ciples, that he is acting with the par
ty that -cast the greatest number of
votes, that 'his policyis no inven
tion of his own, but that of the par
ty which opposed and defeated him

understood and appreciated. His
false pretence is what is making him
the contempt and ridicule of all in

McMAHON-SOLDIERS' HOME.
Mr. McMahon Mr. Chairman, I
have heard a great deal in this
House, from the other side, in the
last two or three years, about disa
bled soldiers; but when I came to
probe what it meant I never found
that it amounted to anything except
the patronage that some republican
congressman wanted from a demo
cratic House for some one-armed re
publican whom he kept here under
a resolution of the House, and the
small bumcombe of a political speech.
1 represent a district which has with-
n its limits 3,000 disabled Union
soldiers, many of wheme vote the re
publican ticket as regularly as they
take their breakfast each morning;
but I never heard of any of those
men getting places here, in any de
partirent of the government or un
der a republican House, through the
nflnence of any republican member
of congres. -
I never heard of one of these men
gettiug a place in your departments
here, although you have 80,000 or
100.000 at the disposal of the heads
of those departments. You could
not muster your office holders on a
section of land: but there are few
soldiers among them.
I have seen time and again disa
bled Union soldiers from the Soldiers'
Home putting applications for office
into the differct departments and
before roe stands the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. Butler.) one of
the sincere friends of the soldiers at
tne soiuiers iiome, an.a one oi us
managers, who can cofirm what I say.
nave seen time and again such ap
plications made by disabled Union
soldiers for places' under a republi-
pan administration, but. because!
they had lost their power by pover-
ty and distress as part ot the politi-
cal machinery of the country, they
were no longer available as candi
dates for office, and their petitions
have uniformly failed, although pre
sented to these exclusive friends of
the disabled soldiers so rich in- sym
pathy and patronage, but so poor in
performance.
Gath, in his Washington letter to
the Enquirer says, of Hayes' admin
istration:
When we consider that the Admin-
tration has already passed nearly
nine mouths, or nearly one-fifth of its
whole career, it may occur to us that
Hayes has not dealt with any thing
vigorously. He is still confronted
by. an embittered Congress; he has
do civil service policy that is under
stood ; he has emancipated the South
em whites, but without clearing the
docket of contests for four seats in

his appointments . through the ben
ate, nearly a year after he came to
his office. As the Senate will soon
be Democratic, Hayes can fraternize
with it and make his Administration

party that wou the war and the par

Mr. Louis A. Godey has finally re

It is prettvwell settled that the
wreck of the United States steamer
Huron was the result of the reckless
ness of the commander and the stu
pidity of the navigator. While it
poor comfort to the bereaved to know
that both were drowned, it vindicates
a common sentiment of justice and
makes human life that much more
safe upon the seas.
. In view of the fact the Democrats
will press the admission of Eustis,
of Louisiana, to the Senate, it is said
that Pinchback will again make his
appearance as a contestant. He
holds that he is entitled to the seat
now claimed by Eustis, and bases
his claim on a set of credentials
which were never brought into the
former contest and never referred to.
