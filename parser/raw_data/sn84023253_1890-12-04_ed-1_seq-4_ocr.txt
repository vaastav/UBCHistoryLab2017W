It may be a merely accidental coin
cidence and it may be with well-considered
intention that just about the
time the Legislature adjourns and
its members are to be let loose upon
the state the Northfield News makes
t his plea :
There is one institution we need in Ver
mont, and must have, and that is a
school for idiots. Now we must send to
Massachusetts or elsewhere to have our
idiots taken care of, and the consequence
is that in order to make a jjood apjear
anee we do not send away nearly so
many of these unfortunates as we should
educate if we had a school of our own.
The Iiellows Falls Times has been
sold again, the third time within the
year. K. C. Allis, who has owned it
for the past eight months has sold
thepaier to A. W. Emerson, who
will be its editor and manager, and
D. H. I'lumer, a hotel man of Lake
wood, X. J., who is a silent partner.
This change is for the letter. Mr.
Emerson was assistant editor of the
Times while it was edited by Edwin
A. Start, now of the Caledonian.
He is a young man of energy and
ability, a clever writer, with excel
lent ideas of what goes to the mak
ing of a good newspaper. He is
popular in Bellows Falls and will
succeed there as the head of a paper
which enjoys one of the lest fields in
the state.
The departure of Gen. E. Burd
Grubb of New Jersey to his new post
as minister to Spain is important in
view of our present relations with
that country. All the great com
mercial bodies of Cuba are demand
ing a reciprocity arrangement with
this country. The commercial situa
tion in Cuba at present is of so seri
ous a nature that some relief of the
sort is necessary and the Spanish
government, hitherto deaf to any
suggestions of this kind, -has been
compelled to give attention to these
demands of its Cuban subjects and
to consider the acceptance of a reci
procity treaty for its West Indian
colony. On the other hand it is
understood that Gen. Grubb goes to
Spain with full instructions from the
state department so to act as to
bring about if possible the arrange
ment of some such treaty. Every
thingseemsfavorableto a reciprocity
arrangement which would be espe
ciallv desirable to all concerned in
this case.
The annual report of the na'3r de
partment begins to be more interest
ing and to savor less of ghastly
skeletons and mouldy hulks than it
has for some time past. The present
report states that since March 4,
1889, nine new modern vessels have
been completed and put in commis
sion, while during the winter four
more will be added to the list. Five
others are more or less advanced in
construction. The secretary an
nounces that we have now attained
a speed standard of our own, a
standard unsurpassed in any navy
of the world. The secretary speaks
of thegreat superiority of nickel stee
armor, as shown by recent tests, and
of the success attained in making
rapid firing guns of large calibres
The plea for a naval militia is re
newed, as is the recommendation
that the revenue marine service be
consolidated with the navy depart
ment, where it properly belongs
The report gives gratifying evidence
of progress.
Late advices from the seat of the
Indian troubles show that there has
been some criminal lying bv reckless
correspondents at Pine Ridge agency
and that if there is now any danger
of bloodshed it is the result of the
extraordinary measures which have
been taken to overawe the savages
measures which would not have been
deemed necessary' had the Pine Ridge
agent understood the Indian char
acter as he should to be fit for his
position. So far as the religious
propaganda among the tribes is
concerned there is no evidence that it
has in it the seeds of trouble. It is a
close imitation, from the savage
standpoint, of Christianity as the
Indians have learned it from their
missionaries. The real trouble with
the Sioux is that the paternal gov
ernment which pretends to care for
them has not hall fed them and hun
ger has bred discontent. Let them
be put to work and taught to main
tain themselves, instead of to live in
idleness on the nation's allowances
and there will be little danger o
trouble.
The platform upon which the
Farmers' Alliance is substantially
unanimous embraces the following
planks :
1. The abolition of national banks
and the calling in of their notes.
'J. The issue of legal tender United
States Treasury notes "in sufficient vol
ume to do the business of the country on
a cash system.
3. The free and unlimited coinage o
silver.
4-. The prohibition of the alien owner
ship of land, and the reclamation of all
lands heretofore ceded to railways and
not now actually used by them.
5. The prohibition of speculation in
agricultural products, and of dealing in
"futures.
6. The restriction of jrovemmen
revenues to the actual exjenses of the
government economically administered
7. Thegovernment control and opera
tion of railways and telegraphs in the
interests oi the jK-ople.
8. The prohibition of trusts or "com
bines" among corporations, and of usuri
ous interest.
With this the Northwestern Alliance
and the Farmers' Mutual Benefit
association of Illinois are in har
mony.' How far the Farmers
League, which is the political organ
ization of the farmers in the eastern
and middle states, subscribes to some
of these points of doctrine we do not
know, but it has been stated that it
too is in harmony with the Alliance.
RETROSPECT. !
It is not an agreeable task to pass
n retrospect the work of the late
Legislature, which did its best ser
vice to the state by adjourning. The
Caledonian has frankly expressed
tself upon the leading matters that
have come up during the session and
does not need to repeat itself now,
as it has nothing to take back on
any of these points; but a general
survey of the results, as closely sum
marized by our correspondent in an
other column, may not be unprofit
able.
The only important progressive
measure, of all that were before it.
which the Legislature can be cred-
ted with having enacted into a law
was the ballot reform law. This,
after standing in pickle all through
the session, went through in its last
hours. That it passed at all was
owing to the promptness of a demo
cratic member of the house, Mr.
Marshall of Brattleboro, who got
his bill in promptly at the opening of
the session and kept it lefore the
Legislature steadily.
Against this one piece of positive
legislation put this array of meas
ures killed : Separate agricultural
college bill; bills for insurance and
immigration bureaus; to regulate
fares on railroads; to prevent the
organization of bogus medical col
leges; providing for weekly payment
and fortnightly payment of wages;
to prevent double taxation; grant
ing municipal suffrage to women
taxpayers.
In school legislation the law was
tinkered again in a way that gives
no assurance of satisfactory results
but rather appears like a retrogres
sion for which sufficient reason can
hardly be given.
The corporation tax law, one of
the most important measures, will
have to be tested before judgment
can le passed on it. It was given
little consideration by the members
as compared with its importance.
Two acts of the session should be
tamped as highly discreditable, the
election of two of the members to
vacant judgeships and the shameful
penuriousness of the appropriation
for the world's fair. Against the
gentleman chosen to the bench we
have no word to say, but this docs
not excuse the reprehensible custom
of making the highest judicial posi
tions in the state a matter for politi
cal trade and dicker. We hope the
time is not far distant when such
a practice will be given up. The
Legislature of 1890 was not one of
the kind that begins such high-
minded reforms.
The appropriation of five thou
sand dollars for the world's fair will,
as one disgusted member expressed
it, just about provide for an exhibit
of one of Commissioner Valentine's
abandoned farm maps, and perhaps
no more appropriate exhibit could
be found for a state so niggardly in
the matter of advertising itself.
A summary of the legislation of
1890 might be added to the exhibit.
It would help explain the abandoned
farms.
No, this retrospect is not a pleas
ant one for the people of Vermont
to take.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The president's message is a good
document. We may or may not
agree with all the president says,
yet no one but the blindest partisan
can deny that he covers concisely
and fully the various interests
touched by the general government
The message seems in some sense to
bean attempt to assume a leader
ship in his party which the presi
dent does not and probably cannot
possess. It is a courageous docu
ment, maintaining firmly as it does
the republican position on the tariff
and the federal elections bill, in the
face of the recent party defeat.
Especially noticeable in the docu
ment is President Harrison's urgent
appeal to Congress to go to work at
once on important legislation and
push it.
The first part of the message, deal
ing with foreign affairs, is especially
satisfactory, indicating the existence
of a definite and dignified American
policy in the state department.
The statement of finances is fairly
satisfactory, showing that without
any extravagant increase in expendi
tures the surplus, that bugbear of re
cent years, is reaching a vanishing
point. There will doubtless be
found those, however, who have
complained because there was a sur
plus and have denounced it as a
source of danger to the republic
who will now denounce the party in
power with equal vigor for extra va
gance in getting rid of it. Of such
stufl" is partisanship made.
The presentation of the case for
steamship mail subsidies is one of the
most forcible arguments in the mes
sage, which is really worth reading,
for the general idea it gives in brief
compass, comparatively, of the af
fairs of government, and the leading
questions now up for consideration.
A LOST-LEADER.
We know of nothing in recent po
litical "history comparable to the
sudden fall of Charles Stuart Pamell
from the dizzy height to which he
had climbed by reason of his remark
able abilities. Here is a man whose
achievements as the leader of his
people in a great political struggle
have fixed the attention and com
manded the admiration of the wes
tern world ; whose firmness, moder
ation and dignity have commanded
the highest respect; and who has
been the honored associate and co
laborer of one of England's greatest
statesmen and best men. There he
stands with the eyes of millions
upon him.
Suddenly, as by some Jekyll and
Hyde transformation, this hero
stands revealed as the destroyer of a
home, the betrayer of a friend
the committer of a crime darker
than blackness.
It matters not what the decision
of his followers may be. Pamell has
fallen, fie is "a lost leader" indeed.
The people who have trusted him
can trust him no longer, since the
breach of trust of which he stands
confessed is the grossest of which man
is capable. It may be that personal
purity and high moral living are not
to be insisted on in the men we exalt
to high places, but when they are no
longer considered requisite for high
honors and leadership, may God
help the people that scorns them.
Senator Hoar's manifesto to the
republicans of Massachusetts is a
weak document, unworthy of the
able statesman who wrote it. Its
appeal to precedent and its failure to
recognize anything as involved in the
recent elections are unfortunate for
his party. It is for such men as
Senator Hoar, men of principle and
patriotism, to snatch from petty
politicians the direction of the repub
lican party and redeem its great
reputation, making it equal to the
demands of the hour by recognizing
its shortcomings and striving firmly
to correct them. An apologetic
tone is best neither for the party nor
for the nation.
There has been a deep significance,
not apparent perhaps to the casual
observer, in the interchange of cour
tesies during the past week between
the visiting Brazilian embassy and
naval officers and the officials of this
country. These courtesies have been
marked on both sides and far beyond
the strict requirements of interna
tional etiquette. They are the evi
dences of the peculiarly cordial feel
ing that has arisen between the two
countries as a result of the prompt
recognition of the Brazilian republic
by the United States and the sending
of the White Squadron to Rio Janeiro,
at a time when its moral support
was worth much to the new govern
ment. These things augur well for
the promotion of reciprocity and of
closer connections between two coun
tries which can be of great use to
each other.
Postmaster General Wanamaker
in his annual report earnestly urges
the establishment of a postal tele
graph and combats the objections to
it by instancing the success and
economy of government mail service
Regarding the assertion that it
would be corruptly managed by the
party in power, the postmaster-gen
eral says that "stringent law and
penalties hedge around the postal
system, jealous eyes watch it and it
is ever open to public observation
and inquiry." Probably Mr. Wana
maker knows something about this.
"The telegraph business," he con
tinues, "in the hands of private in
dividuals, is not so hedged about
and is much more likely to be used
for corrupt purposes." There is
something in this. An official liar is
under more restraint than an unoffi
cial liar. It appears by the report
that 14,072 postmasters were re
moved during the past two years
and 26,680 appointed in the same
time. The report criticises the ten
dency to appropriate money for cost
ly buildings merely for the sake of
display. The deficiency of the de
part men t for the year was $5,786,
300, a small net gain over the previ
ous year.

LEGISLATIVE REVIEW.
What Was Done and Not Done and How
Jt Was Done.
Special Correspondence of the Caledonian.
Montpelier, Dec. 3.
The Legislature of 1890 having
accomplished its labors, a birds-eye
view can now be taken of the whole
field to see to what extent the expec
tations of the people have been real
ized and to compare the work done
with that of previous legislatures.
It must be admitted that the record
has been disappointing in many re
spects. The keynote of the state
campaign was reform and retrench
ment in the matter of expenditures.
It cannot be denied that this was
borne in mind, as was attested in
debates nearly every day. Yet econ
omy manifested itself too often in
cutting off expenses in wrong direc
tions and in continuing expenses
which might as well have been cur
tailed, if not abandoned altogether.
If members came with a firm deter
mination to work hard and conscien
tiously during the session, that good
resolve was soon lost sight of. No
improvement was -shown over pre
vious legislatures in this respect.
Till the very last of the session only
three days in the week were utilized
to their fullest extent. Friday after
noon sessions presented a thin atten
dance, there were no sessions Satur
day and Monday afternoons gave
sparse audiences and little of impor
tance was transacted then, lrw-4-ue-
anxiety to escape the censure which
the Legislature of two years ago in
curred, the opposite extreme was
reached and the Legislature which
has just adjourned will go on record
as doing nothing of importance.
One of the most boyish freaks devel
oped toward the close of the session
was the slamming of desks when an
uninteresting speaker had the floor.
After the speaker had restored par
tial order by rapping vigorously
with the gavel, members were taken
usually with a violent fit of cough
ing. Although this practice was to
be condemned, it caused several dull
speakers to abbreviate their remarks
much to the comfort of the listeners.
The unpleasant feeling which
cropped out toward the close of the
session between the two branches of
the Legislature is sincerely to be re
gretted. Each body thought the
other was killing rather too summa
rily its own pet schemes. The House
declared it would oppose anything
coming from the Senate and the lat
ter body reciprocated. It served as
a hindrance to bad legislation get
ting through but at the same time
prevented some meritorious meas-
uies from being enacted.
There were introduced in all 576
bills, 233 of which have become
laws. By far the greater part of
these are acts of incorporation and
bills of a private nature. The appro
priations call for something like $8S,
000, about half the amount raised
two years ago.
The state tax for 1891 will be 18
cents. This is a slight reduction
from what it has been heretofore
The Senate was much more liberal in
its views than the other branch of
the Legislature. Members of the
House could not divest themselves of
the oath they had sworn to their
constituents to keep expenses at the
lowest possible point. The non-con
tinuance of the bureau of immigra
tion and industrial interests is an
instance in question. The Senate
was quite ready to continue this
work but the House refused point
blank.
The niggardly policy of the House
was shown in its refusal to make a
suitable appropriation for the
world's fair. A great mistake was
made by the committee in asking for
$30,000 at first. When the process
of cutting down began it was easy
to keep on until the lowest point
was reached. If $10,000 had been
asked for at first it could have been
obtained in all probability. It has
been suggested that the Vermont
Legislature be taken to Chicago and
put on exhibition as a natural curi
osity. What can be done with the
$5000 appropriated is not yet deci
ded upon. The bill was got through
at the urgent request of Gov. Page
who explained that if Vermont took
no part in the celebration it would
be a serious disadvantage in getting
appropriations from the federal gov
ernment for our harbors. It is hoped
the next Legislature will be more
liberal in the matter of appropria
tions.
The corporation tax law is one of
the most important measures en
acted. When the bill was first intro
duced several corporations entered
formal complaints against the rate
at which thev were to be taxed. The
rates were revised and made accejv
table to the interested parties.
The reduction in the number of
supreme court judges was a reform
universally demanded all over the
state. The House did its duty in this
matter but the wisdom of the Senate
again intervened to circumvent the
public expectation, l ne action on
the weekly and fortnightly payment
bills shows that the state is not yet
ready to place arbitrary restrictions
on the business relations between
the employer and the employee. The
valued-policy bill was a metsure
much agitated but the bill was never
reported from the committee. This
was done out of senatorial courtesy
to the author, Senator Dow. It was
seen at once that the bill could never
pass the Legislature owing to the
great amount of opposition devel
oped in the weight of evidence pro
duced. The question of double taxation is
one of the most difficult and intricate
to deal with. Senator Nichols intro
duced by far the best bill bearing on
the subject. This passed the Senate
safely but the House believed it a
piece" of legislation of doubtful ex
pediency, consequently the bill was
consigned to the company of the
great majority.
The passage of the ballot reform
bill was quite unexpected. Being
introduced at a late hour in the ses
sion there was insufficient time to
give it the consideration its impor
tance deserved. However, the com
mittee labored zealously to urge
its merits on the minds of the mem
bers a majority of whom received it
favorably. While there is not such
a crying need in Vermont for this re
form as in other places where corrup
tion in voting exists yet it is hoped
that by it many of the flaws in our
present voting system may be rem
edied. The greatest fight of the session
was over the agricultural college and
the final outcome is a serious disap
pointment to the state at large.
Several senators voting against the
bill will have a chance to explain
matters to their constituents. In
this as in other matters they seemed
to labor under the delusion that they
were representing themselves rather
than those who sent them. At any
rate the institution at Burlington
has been given a tremendous shak
ing up and the authorities promise
to make some showing during the
coming two years in comparison
with what has been achieved for the
past twenty years. It is reasonably
sure, if this is not done, that the
larger portion of both branches in
the coming Legislature will be pleged
for separating the college in spite of
the 'isacred compact.
The school question took an unex
pected turn at the last moment. It
was supposed that the bill drawn up
by the committee would satisfy
every one. After listening patiently
to the complaints and views ol mem
bers a bill was prepared removing
the objectionable feature ot county
supervision and providing for the
town system. No sooner was this
bill before the House than it met
with a storm of opposition from
those who recommended the changes
adopted. The demands of the clam
oring mob were complied with and the
hated town system was dispensed
with. Great surprise was manifested
that this bill should pass the Senate
as it finally did about three hours
before adjournment by a majority of
one. The enactment of this law is
to be deplored. While some features
of county supervision may be advan
tageously corrected, the main prin
ciple is right and the results achieved
have been all that could nave oeen
expected for the short time the law
has been in operation. 11 the law
had remained in force two years
longer it is reasonably certain that
no change would have been effected
two years hence. The office of county
examiner is instituted. When this
official is allowed to give three per
mits to one applicant the stringency
of examinations which the past law
brought about is weakened so the
standard of teachers' qualifications
must be lowered. His other duties
are to assist at teachers' institutes.
It is doubtful if persons can be found
in all the counties to till the offices.
No one can afford to devote his time
exclusively to this work for the sal
ary paid.
The action of the Senate in reject
ing the constitutional amendments
proposed is open to censure. Nearly-
all possessed more or less merit and
this Legislature would have done
well to allow them to go through
and let the public pass judgment on
their feasibility. It is safe to assume
that none would be adopted which
were not demanded by the people.
Now none can be introduced again
till ten years have elapsed.
In the promotion of Judge Thomp
son to the supreme bench the Legis
lature loses its ablest debater and
wisest counsellor. His leadership in
the last House is unquestioned and
his familiarity with every detail of
lawmaking rendered his services in
valuable. The democrats have given a good
account of themselves. The side
they took upon the leading issues
was well maintained. Messrs. Mo
loney of Rutland and Bullard of
Underbill were brilliant speakers and
quick to catch any point which
could be used to their advantage
Senators Roberts, Nichols and Har
vey showed the most ability and did
the greatest amount of work for the
other branch.
The real effect of the work done
cannot now be given. The results
of the operation of the laws put into
effect, and the platform ot the next
campaign in regard to the issues of
this year not settled, will give evi
dence of the people's verdict on the
legislation ot 1890.

A certain proportion of Insurance Policies
written bv all companies are never taken or

great honor to have the name of doing an
immense business, whether the same is ever
actually placed or not. Some companies pay
extremely large salaries, and their office and
agenev exenscs are exorbitant. It might be

Don't it look reasonable that with such a
showing as the Old State Mutual makes, in
both the above important features, that you
are absolutely sure of better results at their
hands ? I think so. Remember that every
liberal feature known to Life Insurance is
contained in my endowment bonds, but still
my motto is. Don't take my word or any
other agent's) for it, but investigate.
