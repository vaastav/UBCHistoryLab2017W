A government divided against Itself
cannot settle a coa'l strike. Secretary
of Labor Wilson, who was secretary
of the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica for eight years, and should know,
says the miners should have an ad
vance in wanes of St per cent. Pro
fessor Garfield, who is federajefuel ad
ministrator, and should know, says
4 per cent is enough. If the secretary
of labor had not been chosen from
the ranks of the" miners, might not
these two gentlemen have been more
nearly in accord? It seems difficult
to evade the conclusion that for the
most of the existing labor troubles the
Wilson administration is responsible.
They began with the passape of the
Adamson law. This blunder has been
followed by others in swift succession.
Unfortunately for the steel workers
they had no representative in the cab
in' I.
The price of United States senator
ships appears to have advanced along
with prices of everything else. They
are quoted at $5DO,0OOTh Michigan. It
will be remembered by many Kansans
yet livinir hat a senatorship was once
fold here on the open market for
$00,000. I!ut that was when election
rented with the legislature.
The coal miners will lose their
strike, just as have the steel workers,
the longshoremen, the Boston police
men and other labor organization's
recently. Meanwhile every such inci
dent brings grist to the mill of the
syndicalist, the Bolshevikl and the I.
W. W. All these will be ready to say
to union labor: . "We told you so;
your unions are no good; you can't
win that way: ours Is the only method
that can bring success." These radicals
have not wanted the strikes to be suc
cessful. Their business is to start
strikes; not to win them. A strike
settled on terms of mutual justice and
understanding is the last thing; they
want to see. When will loyal law
abiding, self-respecting working men
learn that they are being used as cat's
paws by the Reds?
They always do things in Kansas,
says the Des Moines Register, adding:
"The people of Kansas are forming
one big union to keep the womep and
babies warm when the thermometer
goes lower."
Time was when we paid a dime
for a yellow backed novel that re
cited the improbable deeds of Impos
sible heroes and heroines. Now we
obtain the same result by going to
the movies.
The government owes the railroad
owners $900,000,000. It reports a
profit of $11,000,000 In October. At
that rate It would take a long time
to pay the debt.
Republican opponents of the peace
treaty continue to point to the fact
that 9 Democrat - senators voted
against ratification. But these
Democrat senators did not vote against
the treaty of Versailles: they voted
against the treaty framed by Senator
Lodge's committee. It is useless to
try to cloud the issue. The people
know.
There Is no real division of Interest
in this country. Intolerance alone can
divide us into classes. We all are, or
ought to be, workers. What is going
on Is a struggle for leadership. The
men who spend their time thinking
out a better way of life while other
men are working out a better way of
life want to take over the plant they
want to begin at the end and harvest
the fruit, or, better sti!l..have others
harvest the fruit for their benefit.
Some of there men honestly believe
that they can serve the mass of the
workers better than the men under
whose leadership the mass of the
workers have steadily advanced to
ward the satisfaction of all their wants.
But who beside themselves believes
that they can? Not even the mass of
the workers believe it. Others among
the radical leaders are entitled to less
respect they are clearly self-seekers
men seeking private ends wealth
or power, who ruthlessly employ the
workers as stepping stones. These
are the men in between the men who
cannot succeed unless they separate
the mass of the workers from their
natural leaders, the planners, the build
ers. They want the country divided
into classes. The bigots, the intoler
ant, the fanatical, no matter what flag
they fly, help the radical toward their
goal.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
While the annual message of Pres
ident Wilson, delivered t' congress
Tuesday, covered much ground, the
two subjects uppermost in the public
mind were omitted from considera
tion. These are the peace treaty and
the railroad problem. The president
announced that they will be taken up
at a later date.
Among the'' most important of the
president's recommendations is the es
tablishment of a budget system for the
nation's finances. A bill for this pur
pose already has passed the house?.
A separate bill is expected from the
senate and some action may reason
ably be expected before the session
ends.
In stirring up the tariff issue Mr.
Wilson may start something that he
will find it difficult to stop. Specifi
cally he asks for protection for the
dye stuff Industry, . altho he must
have 'been familiar with the report of
the tariff commission, appearing si
multaneously with his message, which
report says:
There are indications that--the
United States soon will be indepen
dent not only of its former enemies.
Germany and Austria, but of all other
foreign countries in the matter of dye
stuffs, synthetic medicinals, optical
and window glass and other commodi
ties. American manufacturers now
have a large output of these goods, all
of which were Imported before the
war, and most of the domestic trade
is being satisfied thru home produc
tion. The absen ie of any suggestion for
a solution of the labor problem is
likely to be disappointing to the pub
lic. In the matter of the coal strike,
the president appears to be astride
the fence. While maintaining the in
violability of labor's right to strike,
he apparently endorses the action of
the federal court In enjoining the
miners from exercising that right.
The suggestion of a revision of the
income and excess profits tax law
probably will meet with general ap
proval. It is widely believed that the
latter form of taxation has much to
do with keeping up abnormal living
costs. .
The president has laid out sufficient
work for congress to keep it busy far
into the coming year.
Attorney General Palmer's cam
paign to reduce prices appears to be
making no headway. Bradstreet's
weekly food Index number, based on
the prices per pound of thirty-one ar
ticles used for food, is $5.10, compared
with $5.05 the previous week and $4.93
for the week ending November 28,
191$. Last week'a number reflects a
gain of one per cent over the week
before and of 3.4 per cent over the
like week of last year.
THE SPENDING ORGY.
t :
The total exports of this country!
for the ten months ended October,
last, were valued at $(,602,000,000, or
about three and one-half times the
pre-war value. Foodstuffs and food
animals alone accounted for 36 per
cent of this vast sum; manufacturers
made up 33 per cent of the sum.
.During the first nine months of the
current year we exported $725,000,000
worth of breadstuffs, $34,000,000 in
fish products, $81,000,000 in fruits
and nuts, $40,000,000 worth of vege
tables, and $965,000,000 worth of meat
and dairy products.
Such colossal shipments were never
before known in our history, and the
huge bulk of them go to Europe. We
have been denying; ourselves and sell
ing -to Europe 1,129,000,000 pounds
of refined sugar, for Instance, export
ed during the first nine months of the
year, mainly to Europe; while the cot
ton growers disposed of $716,000,000
worth of cotton.
How can any body reasonably ex
pect that living prices can come down
under these conditions? Attorney
General Palmer, when he undertook
to bring down costs mus have known
that it could not be done.
But there la something that the
people themselves can do to help the
situation. They can spend less money
for luxuries and refuse to buy high
priced wearing apparel. High wages
share with exports in responsibility
for high prices and not thru increas
ing the cost of production alone. They
have resulted In a spree of extrava
gant expenditure. Any merchant will
tell the seeker after Information that
It is the wage and salary earners who
are buying $15 shoes end $75 suits and
coata and not well-to-do and business
people.
Those persons, who, as a result of
the war, are earning "good money"
and spending It as they go, and there
are millions of them, are due for a
rude "awakening from their dream of
affluence when prices and wages f ill,
as they are certain to do, unless these
spendthrifts lay by , something while
they have the chance. The low price
of Liberty bonds probably Is due large
ly to this same class of spenders, who
; having acquired the habit of prodi-
Isality. frequently supplement their
earnings by sacrificing their Invest
ments in the best security in the
I world., -

GIVING AWAY THE EARTH.
.Washington, D. C, Nov. 30 Amer
icans, as a people, have been reckless
ly" giving aray or selling for a song
their share of the surface of the earth
ever since the nation was founded.
This is the gist of an historical
study of our public land policy which
has been made by Leifur Magnusson
for the Labor department. '
The labor department has held all
along that the land question is at the
bottom of the present industrial un
rest in this country, and that the fail
ure properly to utilize agricultural
lands has much to do with the high
cost of living.
It is well known that as long as we
had' a great body of fertile land in
this country there was little unrest.
Fifty years ago the immigrant came
to this country because of the oppor
tunity it offered him to become a land
owner. Foreigners did not accumu
latein cities to form centers of agi
tation. They went, west and speedily
became American farmers. The pan
ics of those day 8 of 1873 and before
were ameliorated by the fact that
we still had rich public lands. Labor
ers out of work and business men who
had failed alike went west and took up
homesteads.
Now there are no good public lands
left. There are still millions of acres
of vacant lands, but nearly all of this
area is either grazing land or down
right "desert. Expensive reclamation
is necessary before any considerable
proportion of it can be used for" agri
culture. In a word, there is no lon
ger any opportunity for the man with
little capital , or no capital to engage
in agriculture. The safety valve which
kept the industrial engine from blow
ing up for so many years has been
practically closed. To reopen this
safety valve would be a way out of
our present difficulties.
This in brief is the argument of the
labor department, and of all those who
think that the land problem is at the
bottom of our troubles. To reopen the
-,1. l ace.c In the anil
was the real motive back of all the J
"land-for-soldiers" measures which
were introduced into this congress,
and were for a while so widely dis
cussed. These measures had a curious
history. They were generously en
dorsed in theory, but nothing adequate
has been done. Some of the western
states have passed progressive land
laws, but that Is all.
Mr. Magnusson tells the story of our
public lands from the first. In the
beginning the national governrhent did
not own any lands, but these were
ceded to it by the various states. It
bjgan by selling these lands in large
parcels to various individuals and
companies in order to raise money to
pay off the Revolutionary war debt.
Lands now worth hundreds of dollars
an acre were sold for less than a dol
lar an acre. Later the government
began selling lands to settlers on
credit a system which resulted in
nothing but confusion. It also tried
selling lands for cash to settlers. Then
about 1841 it began making the great
grants of land to railroads which have
caused so much trouble and litigation
since.
Along about 1840 a situation began
to arise much like the" present one, in
that there was a great deal of unrest
in the country. Then, as now, many
students believed that the land of
fered the solution of the difficulty,
and the agitation began which finally
led to the passage of our present
homestead law. George Henry Evans,
an Englishman by birth, was a leader
in this movement and was perhaps our
first land reformer. He was backed
up -by Horace Greeley with his power
ful New York Tribune, and by the
labor organizations which were just
beginning to grow up with the rise of
the factory system in New England.
He was opposed by the New England
manufacturers who were afraid that
to make access to the land easier
would result in raising the wages of
labor. In other words, the line-up In
that distant day was surprisingly like
the line-up on the land question now,
except that now, perhaps, some of the
capitalists are In favor of a progres
sive land policy as a cure" for unrest,
v Evans stood for the same basic
principles as the more radical of the
land reformers today. He believed
that land should be given free to ac
tual settlers In homesteads of equal
size, and that the settlers should not
have the right to sell these home
steads, but only to exchange them for
other homesteads. He contended that
some such provision was necessary to
prevent speculation In lands, and to
prevent large bodies of land from get
ting into the hands of single owners,
who might rent them or let them lie
Idle. This Idea of prohibiting a, man
to sell his homestead was opposed by
the conservatives of that day on the
ground that it was an infringement
of the right of private property.
The situation is much the same to
day. The more radical measures pro
vide 'that the government should re
claim lands and give them to settlers
as fully-equipped far; j on some long
time payment plan, but without the
right to sell them, the title to the
lands remaining always In the govern
ment. But this principle fails to find
adequate backing in congress, and the
Lane bill, which contemplates the
selling of the farms outright. Is the
only one that commands much sup
port. It Is notable, too. that back In the
forties p.nd fifties the farmers of the
middle west opposed this land reform
movement on the. ground that It
would produce too many farmers, and
so lower the prices of farm products.
Ana mey are opposing land reform
on the same ground today. This

MOTHER O MINE."
I have been thinking about the great
unrest in the world. And I have been
believing that a lot of it would be
cured if only a great crowd of new
mothers might be imported into the
world!
For, you- see. a mother Is able to
cure 'most everything.
From the little tot who bumps his
head and gets a great big fat "tiss"
that Immediately heals it, to the strong
man who goes to his work in life,
after the benediction of a mother's
last kiss, so does this marvelous in
fluence mold and make worth while
every effort that a human being is able
to perform.
It's the "Mother O' Mine" thought
that embodies the noblest impulses of
which we are capable.
shows how little the main centers of
interest in the country have shifted
in half a century. The chief differ
ence in the political outlook is caused
by the growing strength and confi
dence of labor. .
The propaganda carried on by
Evans. Greeley and their associates
finally resulted in the passage In 1862
of the Homestead law, which was
signed by Abraham Lincoln, and
which embodied the general. principles
upon which we have acted in the dis
posal of our public lands ever since.
This law did not really embody the
principles for which Evans and Gree
ley had fought at all. It gave the
homesteader the right to sell his land,
and in fact opened up an era of enor
mous speculation and much fraud.
Subsequent acts enabled men to take
up also timber, stone, coal and mineral
lands. There was a time when one
Individual could acquire 1,120 acres
of government land in -his own name
under various-laws: Also, after resid
ing for, a short time ou-a piece of land,
a man could sell a "release" to some
one else. All of this made it easy for
individuals to acquire great areas of
agricultural, timber and mineral lands,
which they held for speculative pur
poses. Ne verth . ss, the homestead law did
much good for the time being. If it
permitted a great deal of speculation
and fraud, it also enabled many bona
fide settlers to obtain valuable farms.
In a clumsy and wasteful way it pro
vided that outlet for surplus national
energy which was so badly needed.
About 1880 it began to be realized
even by congress that our homestead
laws were less than perfect, and they
were modified, but by that time much
of the damage had been done. Nearly
all of the good agricultural land had
already passed into private ownership.
In 1900 began the last epoch, in the
history of the national lands that of
conservation. Theodore Roosevelt
was a notable leader of the conserva
tion movement, and His strongest
claim to the gratitude of tne Ameri
can people rests upon his work as a
conservationist. As a result of this
movement, the national forests have
been set aside, assuring the people of
an adequate timber supply, and of
splendid free play grounds for all time.
The western coal lands have been kept
In the hands of the government, and
will be developed by a leasing system
under government supervision. The
great natural resources of Alaska have
been kept under government "control
to a considerable extent.
Thus the problems of coal and tim
ber have been in a measure solved.
At least, these resources have been
safeguarded. It is the agricultural
lands which present the greatest and
the most difficult problem. Only the
great organised power of. government
seems able to convert our remaining
arid, swamp and cut-over lands Into
productive farms. The individual set
tler cannot begin to contend with the
task. The Labor department urges
that this necessary work of reclama
tion be done as socm as possible so that
opportunity may be substituted for un
rest. cd rape
I was wawking home yestidday not
looking for enything, and I found a
key thinking, G, if the bolt on the

Wich as soon as I got home I went
up to try it, and the bathroom door

for suppir- and I went down stairs
and we started to ea being stake un

j and ma sed, Wat on erth Is keeping

by this time.
And she went out In the hall and
called up, Willyum, Willyum. Wat?
I cant heer wat you say. And she
came back and sat down agen, and
pop kepp on not coming down, and
after a wile ma sed, Benny, go up

and ask him if he Intends to come
down to his suppir.
Wich I went, up to do, the ferst

Gosh, G, I forgot to unlock It, Meen

outside it, saying. Is that you, pop '

weather it was him or not.
Sir? Wat door? I sed, and pop sad.
This door, this door, ware do you

I have in mind a wonderful mother,
who sent her boy out Into the world
with these words: "My boy come

Thru the winding paths and ways
of strife and pain and sorrow, as well
as of Joy, does the spirit of a mother
follow and lead. A mother never runs
out of -love or forgiveness or any
thing that is helpful.
Long years ago did rry mother go
away. But she comes back with the
opening of every day to tell me what
to do. And all that I am of wisdom
or of good, I feel that I owe most to
her.
"Mother O' Mine" you look so
beautiful to mo where you are! The
stars keep telling me about you.
It's the mothers who are going to

Evening Story
Keeping Fashionable.
, BY R. RAY BAKER,
Elza Correll believed In clothes.
"Clothes make the man and they
also make the girl," she told her sis
ter repeatedly. "Some day you'll learn
that youought o dress up more and
keep fashionable."
Certainly Elza kept fashionable.
Eight dollars constituted her weekly
stipend earned by mixing tempting po
tions at Silverworth's drug store. Elza
was one of a half dozen girls who pre
sided within the circular formation of
marble at which airplane sundaes,
submarine splits anl tank sodas were
served, and the high cost of living,
the fate of the League of Nations, the
future of Jugo-Slavia and the salaries
of the film stars discussed.
But the eight dollars to return to
the subject. - Of the eight dollars, two
went for board and room and the re
maining six were expended to adorn
Elza with fashion's latest creations.
Board and room for two dollars a
week? Yes. you see Elza lived at
home, as did her sister, Isabel.
Isabel clerked in Flemmel's dry
goods store, and her share of the
world's goods every week was seven
dollars. Of this seven two went for
board and room, 15 cents purchased
cinema thrills at the Palace theater,
an average of 68 cents was used for
wearing apparel and $3.14 was de
posited in the bank.
Contrasted with Elza's extensive and
expensive wardrobe, Isabel's adorn
ment wss like a minnow unto a gold
fish; yet the latter seemed satisfied
with her lot in life and never com
plained about her rather drab, never
theless neat, attire.
Nor was there reason to complain;
for Isabel could have afforded more
attractive garb as well as her younger
sister could better afford it, in fact,
because she had several hundred dol
lars in safe keeping.
With the situation as it was re
garding clothes, the two girls should
have changed positions. Silk at a
soda fountain was as out of place as
cotton behind the silk counters, where
Isabel presided. Yet each of the girls
was an expert in her particular line of
endeavor.
Klza had a secret. She was- In love.
Evry afternoon there came Into
Silverworth's drug store a fascinat
ing, neatlv-dressed young man who
had the ginger-ale habit. The sun
might forget to shine, the clock
might stop, the river might run
dry, but always at 2 p. m. John Hen
dricks settled himself at his favorite
place at the marble counter (unless
someone else got there first) and or-,
dered ginger-ale. ,
Then he would plunge into the
depths of a newspaper and remain
absorbed in it until his beverage ar
rived, when he would fold the paper,
thrust it into a pocket and sip of the
cooling concoction, while his eyes
roved abstractedly and looked at noth
ing particular, altho seeming to take
in everybody and everything in his
range of vision.
Yes, Elza Correll loved John Hen
dricks. She did not know his name,
she had -no knowledge of his vocation,
she had never spoken a word to him
or been addressed by him except on a
matter of business. She waited on his
order; but John Hendricks noticed
her not at all.
Being fn love with some one she did
not know, Elza felt that it behooved
her to interest him if it lay In her
power; so she paid even more atten
tion to her clothes and deprived her
self of all forms of amusement so that
she might make herself what she
styled "presentable" before the "gin-gle-ale
fiend." Be It said to her
credit that she did not purchase her
raiment on credit.
- "There's one hopeful thing about
It," she told herself. "He's a bru
net and I'm a blonde; and they say
that's the way it ought to be."
It seemed fine to be in love, eve""
if it was unrequited. Elza thought, and
then she got to wondering If her sis
ter had ever experienced the exhllara-
I tion attendant on being paid attention
j by' the little winged god with bows an.
j arrows. One day Elza observed:
J "Isabel, it's about time you got mar
ried. Bat there's no ch.-ince In the
I world, for you. with those plain
clothes you wear."
I To which Isabel replied merely with
j a smile and went her way.
J "She's a deep one," Elza mused.
"That's the way with brunets. The
, ginger ale fiend must be a deep one
too."
But in spite of her natural charms
for Elza was a goo l-lookir.g girl as
sisted by her modish attire, John Hen
dricks continued to og-der his ginger
ale, read his paper, sip his drink and
hurry out of the store.
One morning as- she lay In bed
snatching a few extra minutes of semi
slumber, a startling fact crept into
Elza's brain. , She had no clean
clothes! She had been working hard
er than usual of late and had allowed
her. soiled garments to accumulate.
She had intended to wash out a waist
and skirt the night before, but had
forgotten to do it
She leaped from the bed,- on the
verge of &s panic. Horrors! Go be
hind the soda fountain with soiled
clothes! Impossible! What was to be
done? There was nothing that could
be done unless oh, she couldn't do
that, and yet well, it was the only
course.
She shook her sister, who was not
due at the clothing store until Elza had
been mixing drinks for an hour.
"Isabel!" cried Elza, "Wake up! Can
you let me wear a? waist and skirt -of
yours today? I hate to ask you, but
mine aren't fit."
Isabel sat up and rubbed her eyes,
and yawned, then glared at Elza as
tho debating whether to rend her
limb from limb; - '
"You want to borrow a- waist
and skirt?" she said, as tho she could
not believe her ears. "You queen of
fashion you want to wear my plain
clothes?"
. Elza. felt somewhat abashed.
"Well, no, I really don't want to,"
she replied, "but there's nothing else
to do."
So it was that Elza Correll. fashion
plate of Silverworth's soda emporium,
appeared that morning in plain attire
startlingly plain, so plain that her
fellow workers were awe-stricken and
talked in undertones.
While she worked Elza became filled
with; apprehension.
"What will the ginger-ale fiend
think?" she wondered, and resolved to
keep out of sight at 2 o'clock. But
this proved Impossible, for at 1:45 a
rush began and every available hand
was needed.
"Maybe he won't come today," Elza
thought, but she realized- she might
as well hope to halt time itself in Its
flight. Sure enough, at 2 o"clock in
walked John Hendricks. He seated
himself and waited for his order to be

SANDRA THE JEALOUS
? By JANE PHELPS
ROSE WRITES THAT SHE IS
VNHAPFY.
CHAPTER CXL
I returned to the nursery.
. "Mr. Graham insists that I apologize
to you. Miss Lane. I do so to please
him, not bacause I feel I am in the
wrong."
'Most second wives think they
should rule," she returned calmly, hef
face without change of expression. I
understood: she was getting even with
me for my "old maid."
I paid no attention but left the
room boiling with anger.
"I'll get rid of her some way, she'll
see if 1 don't!" I said to myself as I
winked back the hot hot tears. I
wouldn't cry; if I did she might think
I was crying because of what she said,
I'd not give her that satisfaction.
Just then Hetty brought in the mail.
I was delighted when I saw Rose's
bold chirography. At least I could
forget that odious Miss Lane for a
time. I had given up all idea of a
walk.
"Dear Sandra:" she commenced, "I
am so miserable I mast talk to some
one, and there is no one here that I
know well enough, and I also don't
want to make mother unhappy by tell
ing her. But 'I feel sometimes as" if
I should go mad! Walter goes out
night after night. When 1 ask him-
where he has been, he refuses to
answer or else he Ilea He isn't hon
orable, Sandra. . Your husband was
right. No woman ever could be happy
as his wife. As a sweetheart, yes.
Then he was all courtesy, all thought
for my comfort, all seeming love
toward me. Now he is so different.
"Do you think I have lost all pride
to write you In this way, Sandra? I
haven't! I would cut my arm off be
fore I'd let the home folks know, and
for goodness sake don't tell Mr.
Graham. He is an honorable man.
good and kind if he Is so much older
than you. Do you remember how I
used to say you would be unhappy to
be number two; to marry 'grandpa?'
And you are so comfortably happy
now or seemed to be when I waa
there. No one knows how much In
love I was with Walter or thought
I was, which amounted to the same
thing in my case. But I cannot feel
that he is true to me. I try to get rid
of that- thought, but It is Impossible
for me to believe otherwise. , He es
corts women I do not know to restaur
ants and theaters. There mnv be
girls were busy, and 'service" was a
byword at Silverworth's.
"Well, here goes. . All Is lost," she
murmured and approached John Hen
dricks. For the first time in history
he smiled at her.
"Hello!" he said pleasantly. "I'd like
a ginger-ale. You're new at this Job
aren't you?"
Elza's power of speech was para
lyzed momentarily, but she managed
to get It In working order long enough
to stammer:
"No oh, no; that is, not especially
new. I've been here off and on."
"Never noticed you before," said the
ginger-ale fiend. "Must be you had
different hours." - )
Elza deigned- no reply. She busied
herself with the ginger-ale while John
plunged into his newspaper, laying it
down to smile at her again as she re
turned with his favorite drink. And
it was a friendly smile, a sincere smile;
"nothing fresh about it," as Elza re
marked afterward.
When she gave him his check, in
stead of leaving he said:
"I've asked Miss Joyce to Introduce
us. I need some one to help me use a
couple of tickets at the Temple to
night.'
Miss Joyce, another soda fountain
worker, thereupon ' formally made
them acquainted, and arrangements
were made for the theater party.
When Isabel went home that after-
noon she found Elza enthusiastically
busy at the washtub. The news was
too good to keep and Isabel was in-
formed of the big event of the day at
the soda counter. After hearing her
sister's story she said:
'Elza, you made a hit with that
younpr man because you wore plain
clothes my clothes. Take my ad
vice and leave off the jraudy stuff
toniRht. You can have my best dre.s.
Elza completed her work at the
tub, but when John Hendricks called
for her she was attired In her sister's
Sunday garments. v
One week later Elza announced to
her sifter that she was Einjr to marry
John Hendricks, the real estate man.
'Congratulations," said Isabel. "As
long as you've confided in me I might
as well tell you that I'm to become
Mrs. Welding the wife of the assist
ant manager of our store."
"Congratulations yourself, returned
Elza. "You certainly did have the
right idea about clothes, Isabel. John
told me last night, when he proposed,
that he had been long looking for a
girl who didn't overdress. After all,
clothes don't make the girl. They help
a lot but they must not be overdone.
"Do you know anybody who wants
to buy a second-hand wardrobeone
that's guaranteed against Cupid's Ar
rows?" . '

ON SECOND THOUGHT
BY JAY E. HOUSE.
From Philadelphia Public Lel(tr.
For us the c.cision of the United
States Supreme Court upon the valid
ity of "war-time prohibition is a mere
exercise of legal phraseolocry which
carries no significance. The dilemma
which w faced uncomplainingly last
June still confronts us. We have no
place to store anything.
"Discussion among our editorial col
leagues as to the ability of the mem-
bers of the industrial conference to do
anything in the very Important mat
ters which confront them finds us
fecund with ideas and suaeestions.
They can adopt a set of resolutions.
They can and probably will present tho
presiding orncer with a cold watch or
a set of sleeve links.
But Inasmuch as the conference la
made up of sterling citizens gifted In
the matters of education, culture and
good taste, the probability that they
will buy a, diamond scarfptn for any
body may be regarded as remote.
" Indubitably, the people ot this coun
try are for the covenant of the leaguo
of nations. But they can be relied up
on to put up no such frght for It a

Meanwhile blame for the defeat of
the treaty pact In being traced by its
proponents and its opponents to vari
ous sources. Both the president and
the senate have been implicated. As
usual, however, the Hearst newspapers
Ludendorff says American prisoners
didn't know what they were fighting
for. Which is unimportant but inter
esting, in that it indicates Ludendorff
finally conceded America was In tho
war.
You may recall, in the event thnt
you read his memoirs, that up to tho
time of their completion Ludendorff
had made no such concession.
A reader hazards the conjecture that
we have mingled little with the class
to which the miller-poet of Middle
town belongs. On the contrary, wo

before we left the farm.
