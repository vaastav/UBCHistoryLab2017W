STATEHOOD BILL INTRODUCED
N HOUSE Br REPRESENTATIVE
HAMILTON OF MICHIGAN
ADMINISTRATION
DIFFERS FROM FORMER ACTS I:
. , - , . ,. , ... ,. . ,
Provides for Adoption of Constitution, Its Ratification bv the
People of the Proposed State of New Mexico After Which
President is to Proclaim the Admission of the New State
and the People Will Then Proceed to the Election of Their
Officers; Liberal Appropriations of Public Land for Sup
port of State Institutions; Similar Provisions for Admis
sion of Arizona Incorporated in the Measure.
The bill for the admission of the
territories of New Mexico und Ari
zona into the union of states, and the
bill which it Is believed Is certain will
pass the United States congress at the
session just opened was Introduced In
the house of representatives yester
duy by Representative Hamilton of
Michigan, chairman of the house com
mittee on territories. Today, Tues
day morning, it will be Introduced in
the senate by Senator Horah of Idaho
That the bill will puss congress at this
session does not admit of a doubt.
This statehood bill is an adminis
tration measure. It is said to have
been written by President Taft in col
laboration with Secretary of the In
terior Ualllniger and Attorney (Jen
eral Wiekershum. it is designed to
meet the objections offered to former
measures of this kind and is likely to
go through both the house and sen
ate practically without amendment.
Every effort will be brought to bear
for its rapid passage and as far as
known now practically all opposition
to the measure will be withdrawn and
New Mexico will be a state this year.
Tlie I'ill provides for the election
of delegates to a constitutional con
vention at which a constitution will be
drawn up for the new state of New
Mexico, to be submitted to the people.
It provides, however, that oflfcers for
t;iL. state shall not. bo elected at the
time of the vote on the ratification of
the constitution, but shall ho chosen al
an election to bo held after the ((in
stitution lias been passed upon by the
president and the stale of New Mex
ico ia formally proclaimed. There
after the people will proceed to the
election of a slate government and
until such time the present territorial
officials will remain in their posi
tions. The capital is to remein at
Santa Fe until 1U15, aftir which date
the people may vote on its location.
The bill makes liberal appropria
tions of land for the support of terri
torial Institutions, allowing ll'ii.uue
acres for university purposes.
The bill us affecting New .Mexico
follows in full, similar provisions being
made in the case of Aziroua:
