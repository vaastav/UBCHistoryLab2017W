Since the conyening of Congress, one
year ago, the Nation has undergone a
prostration in business and industries

indulging in the theories as to the cause
of this prostration, I will only call your
utbcuwuii w uio uict, auu one question,
as to which it would seem there should
be no disagreement During this pros-
trauon iwo essential elements or prosper

capital. Both have been largely unem-
ployed where security has been undoubt
ed, uapitai Has been attainable at very
. moaeraie rates, where labor has been
wanted, it has been found in abundance,
necessaries and comforts of life could be
purchased with the wages demanded.
Two great elements of prosperity there

ity. for its variety of products to feed
and clothe people, and in the amount of
surplus to spare to feed leas favored peo
ple. Therefore, with these facts in view,
it seems to me that wise statesmanship at
mis session 01 congress wonia aictate
the ignoring of the past, and the di
recting in the proper channels these
great elements of prosperity.
The debt abroad is the only element
mat can, wnn aiways a souna currency,
enter into our affairs to cause any con
tinued depression in the industries and
prosperity of our people a great conflict
lor national existence made necessary,
for tempory purposes, the raising of large
sums of money from whatever source at
tainable. It became necessary, in the
wisdom of Congress, and I do not doubt
their wisdom in the premises, regarding
the necessity of the times, to devise a
system of national currency, which it
proved to be impossible to keep on a par
with the recognized cuirency of the civ
ilized world. This begat a spirit of spec
ulation, including an extravagance and
luxury not required for the happiness or
prosperity of a people, and involving,
both directly and indirectly, foreign in
debtedness. The currency being of a
fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe
to hold for legitimate transactions, money
focame a subject of speculation in itself.
These two cases, however, have involved
xis in a foreign indebtedness, contracted
in good faith by the borrower and lender,
which should be paid in coin, and, ac
cording to the bond agreed upon when
the debt was contracted, gold or its
equivalent. The good faith of the Gov
ernment can not be violated toward
creditors at the expense of national dis
grace. Our commerce should be encour
aged, American ship building and carry
ing greatly increased. Foreign markets
sought for the products of the soil and
manufactures, to the end that we may be
able to pay .these debts. Where a market
can be created for the sale of our pro
ducts, either of the soil, the mine, or the
manufactory, a new means is discovered
of utilizing our idle capital and labor to
the advantage of the whole people. But
in my judgment the first step toward this
object is to secure a currency good wher
ever civilization reigns one which, if it
becomes superabundant with one people,
will find a market with some other. A
currency which has as its basis the labor
necessary to produce it, which will give
it its value. Gold and silver are now
the recognized mediums of exchange the
civilizea world over, and to this we should
return with the least practicable delay.
In view of the pledges of the Ameri
can Congress, when our present legal
tender system was adopted, and the debt
contracted, there should be no delay,
certainly no unnecessary delay, in fix
ing by legislation a method by which we
will return to specie. To the accom
plishment of this end I invite your sp
lal attention. I believe firmly that
there can be no prosperous and perman
ant revival of business and industries
until a policy is adopted, with legisla
tion to carry it out, leading to a return
to specie basis. It is easy to conceive
that the debtor and speculative basis
may think it of value to them to make
so-called money abundant, until they
can throw a portion of their burdens
upon others; but even these I believe,
would be disappointed in the result, if a
course should do pursued which will
keep in doubt the value of the legal ten
der medium of exchange. A revival of
productive industries is needed by all
classes, and by none more than the hold
ers of property, of whatever sort, with
debts to liquidate for realization upon
its sales. But admitting that these two
classes of citizens are to be benefitted by
expansion, would it be honest to give it?
Would not the general loss be too great
to justify such relief? Would it not be
just as honest and prudent to authorize
each debtor to issue his own legal ten
ders to the extent of his liabilities, as to
do this? Would it not be safer for fear
of over issue by unscrupulous creditors,
to say that all debt obligations are ob
literated in the United slates, and now
we commence anew, each possessing all
he has at the time, free from incum
brance ? These propositions are too ab
surd to be entertained for a moment by
. thinking people. Every delay in the
preparation of final resumption partakes
of this dishonesty, and is only less in de
gree as the proposition is held out that a
convenient season will at last arrive for
the good work of redeeming our pledges
to commerce. It will never come, in my

opinion, except vj positive action oi
Congress or by national disas
ters, which will destroy for a
time at least, the credit of individ
uals and the State at large. A sound
currency must be reached by the total
banktuptcy of the credit and the integ
rity of the nation and individuals. I
believe 'it is in the power of Congress.
at this session, to devise such legis
lation as will restore confidence,
revive all the industries, start us at the
career of prosperity, and save the credit
of the nation and of the people. Steps
toward the return to a specie basis are
the great requisites to tHs, devoutly to
be sought for consummation, and there
are others, which I may touch upon here
after. A nation dealing in a currency
below that of specie in value. labors
under two great disadvantages: First,
having no use for the world s acknowl
edged medium of exchange, gold and
silver, these are driven out of the coun
try because there is no demand for their
use. Second, the medium of exchange
being of a fluctuating value, for after
all it is only worth jnst what it will pur
chase of gold and silver metals, having
an intrinsic value just in proportion to
the honest Labor it takes to produce them.

to the foreign producer, who receives
nothing in exchange for the product of

t seems to me that nothing is clearer
than that the greater part of the burden
of the existing prostration, for the want
of a sound financial system, falls upon
the working man, who must, after all,
produce the wealth, and on the salaried
man who superintends and conducts the
business. The burden falls upon them
in two ways by the deprivation of em
ployment, and bv the decreased purchas

venture to suggest two or three things
which seem to me as absolutely necessary
to a return to specie payments. The first
freat requisite is a return to prosperity,
he legal tender clause to the law. au
thorizing the issue of currency by the
National Government should be repealed,
to take effect as to all contracts entered
into after a day fixed in the repealing
act ; not to apply, however, to the pay
ment of salaries by the Government, or
other expenses, now provided by law, to
be paid in currency, in the interval
pending between repeal and final re-.
sumption, provision should be made by
which the Secretary of the Treasury can
obtain gold as it may became necessary,
from time to time, from the date when
specie resumption is commencea. xo
this might and should be added a revenue
sufficiently in excess of expenses, to in
sure an accumulation oi goia in me
Treasury to sustain redemption. 1 com
mend this subject to your careiui con
sideration, believing that a favorable
solution is attainable, and that, if reached
by this Congress, that the present and
future generations will ever gratefully
remember it as their deliverance from a
thraldom of evil and disgrace. With
resumption, free banking may be author
ized with safety, giving full protection to
bill-holders, which they have under the
existing laws. Indeed I would regard
free banking as essential, it would give
a proper elasticity to the currency. As
more currency should be required for the
transaction of legitimate business, new
banks would be started; and, in turn,
banks would wind up their business
when it was found that there was a super
abundance of currency. The experience
and iudgment of the people can best de
cide just how much currency is required
for the transaction of the business of the
country. It is unsafe to leave the settle
ment of this question to Congress, the
Secretary of the Treasnry, or the Exec
utive. Congress should make the reg
ulations under which banks may exist,
but should not make banking a monopoly,
by limiting the amount of redeemable
nnnor nirrenrv that shall be authorized.
Such importance do I attach to this sub
ject, and so earnestly do I commend it to
your attention, inai l give it pronimeuce
Dy introducing it at me uegiuumg ui vum
message.
During the past year nothing has oc
curred to disturb the general friendly
and cordial relations of the United States
with other powers. The correspondence,
submitted herewith, between this Uov
ernmentand its diplomatic representa
tives of other countries, are satisfactory
as to the condition of all questions be
tween the United States and the most
of those countries; and with few excep
tions, to which reference is hereafter
made, the absence of any points of differ
ence to be adjusted. The notice directed,
by the resolution of Congress, of June 17,
1874. to be given to terminate the Con
vention of July 17, 1858, between the
United States and Belgium, has been
given, and the treaty will accordingly
terminate on the first day of July, 1875.
This convention secured to certain Bel
gian vessels entering the ports of the
United States exceptional privileges,
which are not accorded to our own ves
sels. Other features of the Convention
have proved satisfactory, and have
tended to the cultivation of mutually
beneficial commercial intercourse and
friendly relations between the two coun
tries. I hone that the negotiations which
have been invited will result in the cele
bration of another treaty which may
tend to the benefit of both countries.
Our relations with China continue to
be friendly. During the past year, the
fear of hostilities between China and
Japan, growing out of the landing of an
armed force upon the Island of Formosa
by the latter, has occasioned uneasiness.
It is earnestly hoped, however, that the
difficulties arising from this cause will
be adjusted, and that the advance of
civilization in these two empires may not
be retarded by a state of war. In con
sequence of the part taken by certain
citizens of the United States in this ex
pedition, our representatives in these
countries have been instructed to impress
unon the Governments of China and
Japan the firm intention of this country
to maintain a strict neutrality in the
event of hostilities, and carefully prevent
any infraction of the law on the part or
our citizens. In connection with this
subject, I call the attention of Congress
to a generally conccaea iact, mat vue

who come to our snore, ao not come
voluntarily to make their homes with us.
and their labor productive of general
prosperity, but come under a contract
with head men who own them almost
absolutely. In a worse form does this
apply to Chinese women. Hardly a
terceptible per cent of them perform any
onorable labor, but they are brought for
shameful purposes to the disgrace of the
communities were settled, to the great
demoralization of the youth of those
localities. If this bad practice can be
legislated against, it will be my pleasure as
well as my duty to enforce any regulation
to secure so desirable an end.
It is honed that negotiations between
the Government of Japan and the other
powers, looking to the further opening of
the empire, ana to tne removal oi various
restrictions upon trade and travel, may
soon produce the results desired, which
can not fail to inure to the benefit of all
parties. Having on previous occasions
submitted to the consideration of Con
cress the propriety of the release of the
Japanese Government from the further
payment or indemnity, unaer we con
vention of October 22, 1864, and as no
action had been taken therein, it became
hit duty to regard the obligations of the
Convention as in force: and as the other
powers interested having received their

SortlOn 01 ine lnueniuuT in liui, me
linister of the United States in Japan
has been notified that this Government
has not received the remainder due to
Uia United States under the Convention
of Simonsky. I submit the propriety of
applying the income of a part, If not tne
whole, or this fund to the education
in the Japanese language of a number
of young men to be under obligations
to serve the Government for a specified
jAKE
time as interpreters at the legation and
the consulates in Japan. A limited num
ber of Japanese youths might, at the same
time, be educated in our vernacular, and
would result to the mutual advantage of
both Governments. The importance of
having our own citizens competent and
familiar with the language or Japan, to
act as interpreters, and in other capaci
tices connected with the legations and
consulates in that country, cannot readily
oe over-estimated.

made at the opening of the last session of
Uongress, that a special court be created
to hear and determine all claims of aliens
against the United States, arising from
acts committed against their persons or
property during the insurrection. It
appears equitable that opportunity should
be offered for persons of other States to
E resent their claims, as well as to those
ritish subjects whose claims were not
admissible under the late Commission, to
the early decision of a competent tribu

The legislation necessary to extend to
the Colony of New Foundland certain
articles of the Treaty of Washington, of
the 8th day of May, 1870, having been

and was duly proclaimed on the follow
ing aay.
A cony of the proclamation is sub
mitted nerewith, and a copy of the re-
Sort of the Commissioner appointed un
er the act of March 19, 1872, for survey
ing and marking the boundary between
the United States and the British Pos
sessions, from the .Late or the Woods to
the summit of the Rocky Mountains, is
herewith transmitted. I am happy to
announce that the field work of the
Commission has been completed, and the
entire line, from the northwest corner of
Lake of the Woods to the summit of the
Rocky Mountains has been run and
marked upon the surface of the earth.
It is believed that the amount remaining
unexpended of the appropriation made
at the last session of Congress, will be
sufficient to complete the work. I re
commend that the authority of Congress
be given to the use of the unexpended
balance of the appropriation in the com-
ftletion of the work of the Commission,
n makiBg the report and printing the
necessary map.
The court known as the Court of Com
missioners of Alabama Claims, created
by an act of Congress during the last
session, has been organized ana has com
menced its work; it is to be hoped, that
the claims admissable under the provis
ions of tke aet may be speedily adminis
tered. It has been deemed advisable to exer
cise the discretion conferred upon the
Executive at the last session, by accept
ing the conditions required by the Gov
ernment of Turkey, for the privilege of
allowing citizens of the United States to
hold real estate in the former country,
ard by assenting to a certain change of
the jurisdiction of the Courts in the lat
tei. A copy of the proclamation upon
these subjects is herewith communicated.
There has been no material change in
our relations with the independent
States of this hemisphere, which were
formerly under the dominance of Spain.
Marauding on the frontiers between Mex
ico and Texas, still frequently takes
place, despite the vigilance of the civil
and military authorities in that quarter.
The difficulty of checking snch trespasses
along the course of a river or such
length as the Rio Grande, and so often
fordable, Is obvious. It is hoped that the
efforts of this Government will be sec
onded by those of Mexico to the effectual
suppression of acts of wrong.
J? rom a report upon the condition of
the business before the American and
Mexican Joint Claims Commission made
by the agent on the part of the United
States, and dated October 28, 1874, it ap
pears that of the 1,107 claims hied on
the part of citizens of the United States,
483 had been finally decided, and 75
were in the hands of the umpire, leaving
4C0 to be disposed of. Of the 998 claims
filed against the United States, 726 had
been finally decided upon. One was be
fore the umpire, and 271 remain to be
disposed of. Since the date of such re
port, other claims have been disposed of,
reducing somewhat the number still
Sending; others have been passed upon
y the arbitrators.
It has become apparent in view of
these figures, and ot the fact that the
work devolving on the Umpire is partic
ularly laborious; that the commission
would be unable to dispose of the entire
number of claims pending prior to the
first day of February, 1875, the date
fixed for its expiration. IN egotist ions
were pending looking to the security of
the results of the decisions which have
been reached and to a further extension
of the commission for a limited time,
which it is confidently hoped will suffice
to bring all the business now before it to
a final close.
The strife in the Argentine Republic
is to bo deplored, both on account of the
parties thereto, and from the probable
eilects on the interests of the trade in
that quarter, the United States being
among the principal loose rs as vet. So
far as i am aware there has been no
violation of our neutrality rights, which
as well as our duties in that respect, it
shall be my endeavor to maintain and
observe. It is with regret that I an
nounce that no further payment has
been received from the Government oi
Venezuela, on account of wars in favor
of citizens of the United States.
Hopes have been entertained that if
the republic could escape both foreign
and civil war for a few years, its great
natural resources would enablo it to hon
or its obligations.
Though it is now understood to bo at
peace with other countries, a serious in
surrection is reported to be in progress
in an important region of that republic.
This may be taken advantage of as an
other reason to delay the payment of the
dues of our citizens.
The deplorable strife in Cuba continues
without any marked change in the rela

The insurrection continues, but Spain

subject of the relations of this country
and Spain.
I have again to call the attention of
uongress to the unsatisfactory condition
of the existing laws with reference to
expatriation and the election of nation
ality. Formerly, amid conflicting opin
ions nnu uecisions, it was aimcuit to
exactly' determine how far the doctrine
of perpetual allegiance was applicable to
citizens oi me umteu oiates.
Comrress. bv the act of the 27th of
July, 1868, asserted the abstract right of
expatriation as a fundamental principle
of this Government. Notwithstanding
such assertion, and that the necessity of
frequent application of the principle,
no legislation nas ueen nau ueumng
what acts or formalities shall work ex
patriation, or when a citizen shall be
deemed to have renounced, or to have
lost his citizenship. The importance of
such definition is obvious. The repre
sentatives of the United states in foreign
countries are continually called upon to
lend their aid and the protection of the
United States to persons, concerning the
good faith or the reality of whose citi
zenship there is at least great question.
In some cases the provisions of the trea
ties furnish some guide. In others it
seems to be left to the persons claiming
the benefit of citizenship, while living
in a foreign country, contributing in no
manner to the performance of the obli
gations and duties of a citizen of the
United States, simolv as a shield from
the performance of the obligations of
citizens elsewhere. .
The status of children born of Amer
ican parents residing in a foreign coun
try, of American women who have mar
ried aliens, of American citizens resid
ing abroad, where such question is not
regulated by treaty, are all sources of
frequent difficulty and discussion.
Legislation on these and similar ques
tions, particularly defining when, and
under what circumstances expatriation
can be accomplished, or can be presumed,
is especially needed.
In this connection, I earnestly call the
attention of Congress to the difficulties
arising from fraudulent naturalization.
The United States wisely, freely and
liberally offers its citizenship to all who
may come in good faith to reside within
its limits, on their complying with cer
tain prescribed, reasonable and simple
formalities and conditions. Among the
highest duties of the Government is to
afford firm, efficient and equal protec
tion to all its citizens, whether na
tive born or naturalized. Care should
be taken that a right carrying with such
support from the Government should not
be fraudulently obtained, and should be
bestowed only upon full proof of a com
pliance with the law. There are frequent
instances of illegal and fraudulent nat
uralization and of the unauthorized use
of certificates thus improperly obtained.
In some cases the fraudulent character of
the naturalization of a person has ap
peared upon the face or the certificate
itself; in others, examination discloses
that the holder had not complied with
the law, and in others certificates have
been obtained where the persons holding
them, not only were not entitled to be
naturalized, but had not even been within
the United States at the time of the pre
tended naturalization. Instances of each
of these classes of frauds are discovered
at our legations, where the certificates of
naturalization are presented either for
the purpose of obtaining passports or in
demanding the protection of the legation.
When the fraud is plain on the faces of
such certificates they are taken up by
the representatives of the Government
and forwarded to the department of the
State. But even the record of the Court,
in which the fraudulent naturalization
occurred, remains, and duplicate certif
icates are readily obtainable upon the
presentation of these for the issue of pass
ports or the demanding of the protection
of the Government. The fraud some
times escapes notice, and such certificates
are not unfrequently used in the tran
sactions of business to the injury of in
nocent parties, without placing any ad
ditional obstacle in the way of the
obtainment of citizenship by the worthy
miu wen intentioneu ioreiguer wuu comes
in good faith, not without. I earnestly
recommend further legislation to prevent
fraudulent naturalization and to secure
the ready cancellation of the record of
every naturalization made in fraud.
Since my last annual message exchange
has been made of the ratification of
treaties of extradition with Belgium,
Ecuador, Peru, Salvador, also of a treaty
of commerce and navigation with Peru,
and one of commerce and consular privi
leges with Salvador, all of which have
been duly proclaimed, as also a declara
tion with Russia in reference to trade
marks. The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, which, by law, is made directly
to langress, ana lonns no part oi mis
message, will show the recipts and ex
penditures for the fiscal year, and the
amount received from each source of
revenue, and the amount paid out for
each of the departments of Government.
It will be observed from this report that
the amount of receipts over expenditures
has been but $2,344,882.80 for the fiscal
year ending June 80, 1874, and that for
the current fiscal year the estimated re
ceipts over expenditures will not much
exceed nine millions of dollars. In view
of the large national debt existing, and
the obligations to add one per cent, per
annum to the sinking fund, a sum
amounting now to over 134,000,000 per
annum, I submit whether the revenues
should not be reduced or the expendi
tures diminished, to reach this amount
of surplus. Hot to provide for this sink
ing fund is a partial failure to comply
with the contracts and obligations of the
Government. ' At the last session of
Congress a very considerable reduction
was made in the rates of taxation and in
the number of articles submitted to tax
ation. The question may well be asked
whether or not in some instances un
wisely. In connection with this subject,
too, I am of the opinion that the means
of collecting the revenues, especially
from imports, have been so embarrassed
bv legislation as to make it questionable
whether or not large amounts are not
lost by the failure to collect, to the di
rect loss of the Treasury, to the prejudice
of the interest of honest importers, and
taxpayers.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his
County
report favors legislation looking to sped
payments, thus supporting the views
previously expressed in this message
lie also recommends economy in the ap
propriations, and calls attention to the
loss of revenue from repealing the tax
on tea and coffee, without benefit to the
consumer; He recommends an increase
of ten cents a gallon on whisky, and
further that no modification be made in
the Banking and Currency Bill passed at
me last session oi uongress, unless me
modification should become necessary by
reason of the adoption of measures for
returning to specie payments, in these
recommendations I cordially join.
I would suggest to Congress the pro
priety oi readjusting me tanrx, so as to
increase the number of articles upon
which duties are levied. Those articles
which enter into our manufactures, and
should be entered free; these articles of
manufactures which we produce, con
stitute part of but do not produce the
whole, that part which we do not pro
duce should enter free also. I will in
stance fine wool dyes, etc. These must
be imported to form a part of the manu
facture of the higher grades of woolen
goods, and chemicals used as dyes, com
pounded in medicines, and used in vari
ouswaysin manufactures, come under
this class. The introduction free of the
dyes of such wools as we do not produce
should stimulate the manufacturer of
goods reauirine these that we do pro
duce, and therefore would be a benefit
to home production. There are many
articles entering into home manufac
tures, which we do not produce ourselves,
the tariff upon which increases the cost
of producing the manufactured article.
All corrections in this regard are in the
direction of bringing labor and canital
in harmony with each other, and of sup
plying one of the elements much needed.
The report of the Secretary of War,
herewith attached, and forming a part of
this message, gives all the information
concerning the operations, wants, and
necessities of his department, and con
tains many suggestions and recommenda
tions which I commend to your special
attention. There is no class of Govern
ment employes who are harder worked
than the army omcers, and none who
perform their tasks more cheerfully and
more efficiently, and under circumstances
ot greater privations and hardships, leg
islation is desirable to render more effi
cient this branch of the public service.
All the recommendations or the Secretary
of War I regard as judicious, and espec
ially commend to your attention the fol
lowing: The consolidation of Govern
ment arsenals : mileage to officers, trav
eling under orders; the exemption of
money received from the sale of sub
sistence stores, from being converted into
tho Treasury ; the use of appropriations
for tho. purj)osc of subsistence, without
waiting lor the beginning of the hscal
year, lor which the appropriations are
made ; for additional appropriations for
the collection of torpedo material; for
increased appropriations for the manu
facture of arms; for relieving the various
States from indebtedness, for arms
charged to them during the rebellion;
for dropping omcers from the rolls of the
army without trial, lor the ouense ot
drawing pay more than once for the same
period; for the discouragement of the
plan to pay soldiers by checks ; and for
the establishment of a professorship of
rhetoric and English literature at West
Point
The reasons for the recommendations
are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently
in the report attached. I also recommend
that the status of the staffcorps of the army
be fixed, where this has not already been
done, so that promotions may be made
and vacancies filled as they occur in each
grade. When reduced below the number
to be fixed by the necessity for such leg
islation, is especially felt now in the Pay
Department. The number of vacancies
in that department is below the number
adequate to the performance of the du
ties required by law.
The efficiency of the Navy has been
largely increased during the last year,
under the impulse of the foreign com
plications which threatened us. At the
commencement of the last session of
Congress, most of our efficient wooden
ships put in condition for immediate
service, and the repairs or our iron-ciad
fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor.
The result is that most of these are now
in an effective state, and need only to be
manned and put in commission, to go at
once into service. Some of the new
sloops authorized by Congress are al
ready in commission, and most of the
remainder are launched and wait only
the completion of machinery to enable
them to take their places as part of our
effective force. Two iron torpedo ships
have been completed during the last
year, and four of our large double-tur-
reted iron clads are undergoing repairs.
When these are finished everything that
is needful to our navy, as now author
ized, will be in condition for service, and
with the advance in the science of tor
pedo warfare, the American navy, com
paratively small as it is, will be found
powerful for the purposes of a peaceful
Nation.
Much has also been accomplished dur
ing the year in aid of science, and to in
crease the sum of general knowledge and
further the interests of commerce and
civilization. Extensive and much needed
soundings have been made for hydro-
graphic purposes, and to fix the proper
routes of ocean telegraphs ; the surveys of
the Great Isthmus have been undertaken
and completed, and two vessels of the
navy are now employed, in conjunction
with those of England, a ranee, and uer
many and Russia, in observations con
nected with the transit of Venus, useful
and interesting to the scientific world.
Estimates for this branch of the public
service do not differ materially from
those of last year, those for the general
support of the service being somewhat
less, and those for improvements at the
various stations, rather larger than the
corresponding estimate made a year ago.
The regular maintenance, and a steady
increase in the efficiency of this most im
portant arm in proportion to the growth
of our maritime intercourse and interests
is recommended to the attention of Con
gress. The use of the navy during peace
might be further utilized by a direct
authorizatien of the employment of naval
vessels in surveys of the supposed navi-
Sble waters of other nationalities in this
mtlnent, especially tributaries of the
two great rivers of South America, the
Orinoco and Amazon. Nothing prevents
under existing laws such exploration,
except that expenditures must be made
in such development of commercial in
terests advantageous to the people reached
and to those who may establish relatione
with them.
Tne education of the people entitled
to exercise the right of franchise I re

and especially so in republics, where
neither education nor previous condition

over our vast territory. The rapidity
with which new sections are being set
tled up, thus increasing the carrying of
mails in a more rapid ratio than the in
crease of receipts, is not alarming. The
report of the Postmaster General, here
with attached, shows that there was an
increase of revenue in his department In
1873 over the previous year of f 1,674,
411, and an increase of cost of carrying
the mails, or paying employes of $3,041,
467 91.
The report of the Postmaster General
gives interesting statistics of his depart
ment, and compares them with corres-
Iuuuiug statistics ot a year ago, snowing
a growth in every branch of the depart
ment. A postal convention has been
concluded with New South Wales, an
exchange of pestal cards, established with
Switzerland, and negotiations pending
lor several years past with t ranee, have
terminated in a convention with that
country which went into effect last Au
gust. An International Postal Congress
was convened in Berne, Switzerland, in
September last, at which the United
States was represented by an officer of
the Postal Department of much expe
rience and of good qualification for the
position. A convention for the establish
ment of an International Postal Union
was agreed upon by the delegates of the
countries represented, subject to the ap
proval ot the proper authorities oi these
countries.
I respectfully direct your attention to
the report of the Postmaster General,
and to his suggestions in regard to an
en ui table adjustment of the Question
or compensation to railroads for carrying
mans.
Your attention will le drawn to the
unsettled condition of affairs in some of
the Southern States. On the 14 th of Sep
tember last, the Governor of Louisiana
called upon me, ns provided by the
Constitution and laws of the United
States, for aid in the suppression of
domestic violence in that State. The call
was made in view of a proclamation
issued on that day by D. B. Penn, stating
thas he was elected Lieutenant Governor
in 1872, and calling upon the militia of
the estate to arm, assemble and drive trom
power the usurpers, as he designated the
officers of the State Government. On
the next day I issued ray proclamation,
and commanded the insurgents to dis
perse within hve days from the date
thereof, and subsequently learned that
on that day they had taken forcible pos
session of the State House. Steps were
taken by me to support the existing rec
ognized State Governmens; but before
the expiration of the five days, the in
surrectionary movement was practical!
abandoned, and the officers of the State
Government, with some minor excep
tions, resumed their powers and duties.
Considering that the present State Ad
ministration of Louisiana had been the
only government in that State for near
ly two years, that it has been tacitly ac
knowledged and acquiesced in as such
by Congress, and more than once ex
pressly recognized by me, I regarded it
as my clear duty, when legally called
upon for that purpose, to prevent its
overthrow by an armed mob under pre
tense of fraud and irregularity in the
election of 1872.
I have heretofore called the attention
of Congress to this subject, stating that
on account of the frauds and forgeries
committed at said election, and because
it appears that the returns thereof were
never legally canvassed, it was impossi
ble to tell thereby who were chosen; but
from the best sources of information at
my command, I have always believed
that the present State officers received a
majority of the legal votes actually cast
at that election. I repeat what I said in
my speccial message of February 13,
1873, that in the event of no action by
Congress I must continue to recognize
the government heretolore recognized by
me.
I regret to say that with preparations
for the late elections a decided indication
appeared in some localities in the South
ern States, of a determination, by acts
of violence and intimidation, to deprive
citizens of the freedom of the ballot be
cause of their political opinions. Bands
of men, masked and armed, made their
appearance; White Leagues and other
societies were formed, large quantities of
arms and ammunition were imported
and distributed to these organizations;
military drills, with menacing demon
strations, were held, and with all these,
murders enough were committed to
spread terror among those whose politi
cal action was to be suppressed, if possi
ble, by these intolerant and criminal
proceedings. In some places colored la
borers wore compelled to vote according
to the wishes or their employers, under
threats of discharge if they acted other
wise, and there are too many instances
in which, when these threats were disre
garded, they were remorselessly exe
cuted by those by whom they were made.
I understand that the t iltcenth Amend
ment to the Constitution was made to
prevent this state of things, and the act
of May 31, 1870, with amendments, was
passed to enforce its provisions, the ob
ject being to guarantee to all citizens
the right to vote and to protect them
in the free enjoyment of that right en
joined by the Constitution, to take
care that the laws bo laiiniuuy ex
ecuted; and convinced by undoubted
evidence that violation of said act had
been committed, and that a widespread
and flagrant disregard of it was contem
plated, the proper officers were instructed
to prosecute the offenders, and troops
were stationed at convenient points to
aid these officers, if necessary, in the
performance of their official duties.
Complaints are made of this interference
by Federal authority, but if said amend
ment and act do not provide for such
interference under the circumstances as
above stated, then they are without
meaning, force or effect, and the whole
scheme of colored enfranchisement is
worse than mockery and little better
than a crime. Possibly Congress may
find it due to truth and justice to ascer
tain, by means of a committee, whether
the alleged wrongs to colored
citizens for political purposes were real
or the reports thereof were manufactured
for the occasion. The whole number of

Virginia, at the time of election, were

all the forts from the Delaware to ths
Gulf -of Mexico.
Another trouble has arisen in Arkan
sas. Article 13 of the Constitution of the
State, which was adopted in 1868, and
upon the approval of which by Congress
the State was restored to representation
as one of the States of the Union, pro
vides in effect that before any amend
ment proposed to the Constitution chall
become a part thereof, they shall be
passed by two successive Assemblies, and
then submitted to and ratified by a ma
jority of the electors of the State voting
therein. On the 11th of May, 1874, the
Governor convened an extra session of
tar.

on the 18th of the same month, passea
an act providing for a Convention to
frame a new Constituion. Pursuant to
this act, and at an election held on the
30th of June, 1874, the Convention was
approved, and delegates were chosen
thereto, who assembled on the 14th of
last July and formed a new Constitution.
the schedule of which provided fer the
election of an entire new set or btate
officers, in a manner contrary to the then
existing election laws of the btate. Un
the 13th of October, 1874, this Constitu
tion, as therein provided, was sub
mitted to the people for their
approval or rejection, and according
to the election returns was approved by
a large majority of those qualified to vote
thereon, and at the same election persons
were chosen to nil an the state, county
and township offices.
The Governor elected in 1872 for the
term of four years, turned over his office
to the governor chosen under the new
Constitution, whereupon the Lieutenant
Governor, also elected in 1872 for a term
of four years, claiming to act as govern
or and alleging that such proceedings by
which the new Constitution was made
and a new set of officers elected, were un
constitutional, illegal and void, called
upon me as provided in Section 4 of the
Constitution, to protect the State against
domestic violence. As Congress is now
investigating the political affairs of Ar
kansas, I have declined to interfere with
the subject. Executive interference with
the affairs of a State is repugnant to the
public and to the feeling of those who
from their official capacity must be used
in such interposition, and to him or those
who may direct it. Unless most clearly
on the side of the law such interference
becomes a crime. With the law to sup
port it, is is condemned without a hear
ing, i uesire mereiore mat an necessity
for executive direction in local affairs
may become unnecessary and obsolete.
I invite the attention not only of
Congress, but of the people of the
United btates, to the causes and effects of
these unhappy questions. Is there not
a disposition on one side to magnify
wrongs and outrages, and on the other
side to belittle them or justify them ?
If public opinion could be directed to a
public survey of what is, and to rebuke
wrong and aiding the proper authorities
in punishing it, a better state of feeling
would be inculcated, and the sooner we
would have that peace which would
leave the State free indeed to regulate
their own domestic affairs. I believe on
the part of out citizens of the Southern
States the better part of them there is
a disposition to be law-abiding, and to
do no violence, either to individuals or
the laws existing ; but do they do right
in ignoring the existence of violence and
bloodshed in resistance to constituted
authority? I sympathize with their
prostrate condition, and would do all in
my power to relieve them, acknowledg
ing that in some instances they have
had most trying Governments to live un
der, and very oppressive ones in the
way of taxation for nominal improve
ments, not giving benefits equal to the
hardships imposed. But can they pro
claim themselves entirely excusable for
this condition? 1 hey can not. Violence
has been rampant in some localities, and
has, further, been justified or denied by
those who could have prevented it.
The theory is raised that there is to be
no more interference on the part of the
General Government to protect citizens
whithin a 7tate where the btate authori
ties fail to give protection. This is a
great mistake. While I remain Execu
tive all the laws of Congress and the pro
visions of the Constitution, including the
amendments added thereto, will be en
forced with vigor, without regret that
they should have added one jot or tittle
to the Executive duties and powers. Let

Southern questions ; the advocates of

agrees with the great principles ot state,

erally he is opposed to negro rule. This
is a most delusive cry. Ireat the negro

remain, and soon the parties will be de

ciples. Then we shall have no complaint

The report of the Attorney General
contains valuable recommendations re
lating to the administration of justice in
the courts of the United States, to which
invite your attention. I respectfully
uggest to Congress the propriety of in
creasing the number of Judicial Districts
in the United States to eleven, the pres
ent number being nine, and the creation
of two additional judgeships. The terri
tory to be traversed by the Circuit
Judges is so great, and the business of
the Courts so steadily increasing, that it
is growing more and more impossible for
them to keep up with the business re
quiring their attention. Whether this
would involve the necessity of adding
two more Justices of the Supreme Court
to the present number, I submit to the
judgment of Congress.
The attention of Congress is invited to
the report of the Secretary of the In
terior, and to the legislation asked for by
him. The domestic interests of the peo
ple are more intimately connected with
this department than with either of the
other departments of the Government.
Its duties have been added to irom time
to time, until they have become so oner
ous that without the most perfect system
and order it will be impossible for any
Secretary of the Interior to keep trace of
all the official transactions having his
sanction and done in his name, and for
which he is held personally responsible.
The policy adopted for the manage
ment or the Indian affairs, known as the
peace policy, has been adhered to with
most beneficial results. It is hoped that
a few years more will relieve our fron
tiers ot Indian depredations. 1 commend
the recommendation of the Secretary for
the extension of the homestead laws to
Indians, and for some sort of territorial
government ror the inaian lerntory. a
great majority of the Indians occupying
thin territory are believed to be incapa
ble of maintaining their rights against
the more civilized and enlightend man.
Any territorial form of government given
them, therefore, should protect them in
their homes and property for a period of
at least twenty years, and before its final
adoption should be ratified by a majority
of tnose affected.
The report of the Secretary of the In
terior, herewith attached, gives much
interesting statistical information, which
I refrain from giving an abstract of, but
refer you to the report itself.
The act of Congress providing the oath
which pensioners must subscribe before
drawing their pensions cuts ofi from this
bounty a few survivors of the war of 1812,
residing in the Southern States. I rec
ommend the restoration.' of this bounty
to all such.' ' The number of persons
whose names would be restored to the list
of pensions is not large. They are all
old pensioners who could have taken no
part in the rebellion, and the services for
which they were awarded pensions were
in defense of the whole country.
The report of the Commissioner of Ag
ricnlture, herewith, contains suggestions
of much interest to the general public,
and refers to the approaching Centennial,
and the part his department is ready to
take in it. . I feel that tha Nation t
large is interested in having this expo
sition a success; and commend to Con
gress such action as will secure a greater
general interest in it. Already many
foreign Nations have signified their in
tention to be represented at it. It may
be expected that every civilized Nation
will be represented.
The rules adopted to improve the civil
service of the Government have been ad
hered to as closely as has been practicable
with the opposition with which they
meet. The effect. I believe, has been
beneficial on the whole, and has tended
to the elevation of the service, but it is
impracticable to maintain them without
the direct and positive support of Con
gress. Generally the support which this
reform receives is from those who give it
their support only to find fault when the
rules are apparently departed from. Re
movals from office without . preferring
charges against the parties removed are
frequently cited as qepartures from the
rules adopted, and the retention of those
against whom charges are made by irre
sponsible persons and without good
grounds is also often condemned as a
violation of them. Under these circum
stances, therefore, I announce that if
Congress adjourns without positive legis
lation on the subject of civil service re
form, I will regard such action as a dis
approval of the . system, and will aban
don it. Except so far as to require ex
amination for certain appointees, to de
termine their fitness, competitive exam
inations will be abandoned. The gentle
men who have given their services with
out compensation, as members of the
Board, to devise rules and regulations for
the government-of the Civil Service ef the
country, have shown much zeal and
earnestness in their work, and to them,
as well as to myself, it will be a source
of mortification if it is to be thrown
away. But 1 repeat that it is impossible
to carry this system to a successful issue
without general approval and assistance,
and a positive law to support it.
I have stated that the elements of
(ro8perity to the Nation's capital and
abor, skilled and untrained, and pro
ducts of the soil, still remain with us.
To direct the employment of this is a
problem deserving the most serious at
tention of Congress. If employment
can be given to all labor offering itself,
prosperity necessarily follows. . I have
expressed: the opinion, and repeat it,
the first requisite to the accomplishment
of this end is the substitution of a sound
currency in place oftne of a fluctuating
value, ibis secured, there are many in
terests that might be fostered, to the great
profit of both labor and capital. How
to induce capital to employ labor is the
question. The subject of cheap . trans
portation has occupied the attention of
Congress. New light on this question
will, without doubt, be given the com
mittee appointed by the last Congress to
investigate and report upon this subject.
A revival of shio-buildine and particu
larly of iron steamship-building is of
vast importance to our National pros
perity. The United States is new pay
ing over 11,000,000 per annum for
freights and passage on foreign ships, to
be carried abroad and expended
in the employment and support of
other people, beyond a fair percentage of
what should go to foreign vessels, esti
mating on the tonnage and traveler each
respectively. It is to be regretted that
this disparity in the carrying trade ex
ists, and to correct I would be willing to
see a great departure frem the usual
course of the Government in supporting
what might be usually termed private
enterprise. I would not suggest as a
remedy direct subsidy to American lines
of steamships, but I would suggest tho
direct offer of ample compensation for
carrying the mails between Atlantic and
and seaboard cities and the Continent on
American owned and American built
steamers, and would extend this liber
ality to vessels carrying the mails to the
South American States, and to Cen
tral America and Mexico, and would
pursue the same policy from our Pacific
seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific.
It might be demanded that vessels built
for this service should come Up to a
standard fixed by legislation,, -tunnage
and speed, and all other qualities look
ing to the possibility of the Government
requiring them at some time for war pur
poses. The right also of taking posses
sion of them in such emergency should
be guarded. I offer these suggestions,
believing them worthy of considerations
in all seriousness, affecting all sections and
all interests alike. If anything better
can be done to direct the country into a
course of general prosperity no one will
be more ready than I to adopt this plan.
Forwarded herewith is the plan and
report of the Commissioners appointed
under the act of Congress approved June
20, 1874, to wind up the affairs of the
District Government. It will be seen

Canal Bonds $75,000. and Washington

hands of the Commissioners of the Sink
ing Fund $1,748,054 87, leaving an actu
al debt, less said fund, of $12,994,613 24.
In addition to this there are claims pre
ferred against the Board of the District,
amounting in the aggregate, reported by
the Board of Audit, $3,147,787 48, of
which a greater part will probably be re
jected. This sum can with no more pro
priety be included in the debt of the Dis
trict Government than the thousands of
claims against the General Government
can be included as a portion of the Na
tional debt, but the aggregate sum thus
stated includes something more than the
funded debt chargeable exclusively to
the District of Columbia. "
