WATERTOWN. WIS.
GAVE HIMSELF UP.
Thomas Beckwith, a Boston Em
bezzler Asks to be Arrested
in Chicago.
Chicago, 111., Dec. 3. —Thomas Beck
with of Boston, Mass., walked into the
Harrison street police station and asked
to be arrested. He confessed to the em
bezzlement of $15,000 from Niles A Cos.
of Boston. Mass. His request was quick
ly complied with.
Beckwith, who had but $2.50 left of
the $15,000, said that he chose to give
himself up rather than commit suicide,
which course he had first decided upon.
Beckwith broke down completely and
cried like a child.
According to his confession, Beckwith
was, up to three weeks ago, secretary for
Niles & Cos., pork packers, at 77-70 South
Market street, Boston. Six years ago he
began to take small amour cs of money,
the implicit faith the firm put in him
rendering this easy.
“Then I commenced to drink.” said
Beckwith. “I had never used liquor till
then, nor gambled, but the amount finally
grew so large that 1 needed something to
brace me, and I drank. Three weeks
ago 1 went on a hunting trip in Maine,
and while there I received a message from
my family saying my private bank account
had been attached by the firm. I knew
then that I was discovered, and boarded
the first train for Chicago, reaching here
with SIOOO. Last night 1 drank excess
ively and when I awoke this morning I
found I had been robbed of $700.”
Beckwith said he then determined to
commit suicide, but thoughts of his young
wife made him change his mind. Beck
with’s home is in Summerville, Mass,
DEFIES THE LAW.
Gov. Tanner Says He will Not
Submit to Arrest—lndict
ments Void.
Chicago, 111.. Deo. 3. —Gov. Tanner de
fies arrest. He declares that be will kick
any officer who attempts to take him fit
custody as a result of the indictment re
turned against him by the Macoupin, coun
ty grand jury.
The governor challenges the right of a
grand jury to interfere with him in the
exercise of his official duty as he interprets
it. He says that the indictment voted
against him for alleged malfeasance in of
fice and palpable omission of duty was
the premeditated product of a Democratic
grand jury. He believes that lie is the
victim of a Democratic plot, and that
politics was one of the inspirations for the
recent sensational action of the Macoupin
county grand jury, and will therefore ig
nore it as a bit of farce-comedy.
The legal phase of the indictment of the
governor of the state sent many of the
lawyers in this city to their books yes
terday. It is almost generally held that
the indictment stands as a serious moral
indictment and will serve to voice the
sentiment of many as to the action of the
governor, but that legally it is void.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
A Critical Review of the War
with Spain.
NO POLICY OUTLINED.
Executive Says We Must Await Sign
ing of Treaty Before Dis
cussion Begins.
Washington, D. C., Dee. 5. —President
McKinley's second annual message, sub
mitted to Congress today contains about
20,(X)0 words. Following are the more
important; features of the message:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: Notwithstanding the added bur
dens rendered necessary by the war, our
people rejoice in a very satisfactory and
steadily-increasing degree of prosperity,
evidenced by the largest volume of busi
ness ever recorded. Manufacture has
been productive, agricultural pursuits
have yielded abundant returns, labor in
all fields of industry is better rewarded,
revenue legislation passed by the present
Congress has increased the treasury’s re
ceipts to the amount estimated by its
authors; the finances of the government
have been successfully administered and
its credit advanced to the first rank,
while its currency has been maintained
at the world’s highest standard. Military
service under a common fiag and for a
righteous cause has strengthened the na
tional spirit and served to cement more
closely than ever the fraternal bonds be
tween every section of the country.
In reviewing the controversy which led
up to the war with Spain, the President
takes up the thread of narrative where it
terminated in his last message. He con
eluded: “Jt was honestly due to onr
friendly relations with Spain that she
should be given a reasonable chance to
realize her expectations of reform to
which she had become irrevocably com
mitted.”
It became evident, however, that the
proposed plans were barren of good re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
reconcentrados, among whom the rate of
mortality frightfully increased, the prof
fered expedient of zones of cultivation
proved illusory and it was apparent that
nothing save the physical exhaustion of
Spain or the Cubans and the practical ruin
of the island of Cuba could result from
the struggle then in progress.
Destruction of the Maine.
At this critical juncture, the destruc
tion of the battleship Maine occurred.
Concerning it the President said: “It is
a striking evidence of the poise and
sturdy good sense distinguishing our na
tional character that this shocking blow,
falling upon a generous people, already
deeply touched by preceding events in
Cuba, did not move them to an instant,
desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the
existence of an end of danger and dis
order at our doors that made possible
such a deed, by whomsoever wrought.”
Resuming the war narrative, the Presi
dent directs attention to the measures,
including the $50,000,000 appropriation
for national defense, taken To place the
country on a war footing, and adds; “It
is sufficient to say that the outbreak of
war, when it did come, found our nation
not unprepared to meet the conflict.”
Reference is made to the apprehension
of coming strife by the continental pow
ers. voiced in the address to tin* Presi
dent through their ambassadors and en
voys. and to the President’s reuly there
to. Still animated, however, by the hope
of a peaceful solution of the difficulty and
obeying the dictates of duty, the Presi
dent relaxed no effort to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuban struggle.
Negotiations with the Madrid government
proved futile so far as practical results
were concerned, and then it was that
the President presented the question to
Congress, saying:
‘Tn the name of humanity, in the name
of civilization, in behalf of endangered
American interests which give ns the
right and duty to speak, and to act, the
war in Cuba must stop.”
The result of this statement of the case
was the adoption of the memorable joint
resolution by Congress, declaring the pur
pose of the United States to intervene
between the Spaniards and Cubans.
Following swiftly upon the enactment
of the resolution came the severance of
diplomatic relations between the two
countries, the proclamation of a blockade
of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers,
and the formal declaration of the exist
ence of a state of war. All other govern
ments were immediately notified of the
existence of war and each proclaimed
neutrality.
“It is not among the least gratifying
incidents of the struggle that the obliga
tions of neutrality were impartially dis
charged by all, often under delicate and
difficult circumstances,” remarks the
President.
Critical Review of the War.
The President reviews at length the
work of preparation for war, referring
particularly to the enlistment of the vol
unteers, to the material increase of the
navy in both men and ships and to the
precautionary measures taken for the pro
tection of the seaboard coast and cities.
“The aggregate number of mines placed
was 1535, at the principal harbors from
Maine to California.”
Referring to “the difficult and important
character” of the work performed by the
signal corps, the President says: “This
service was invaluable to the executive in
directing the operations of the army and
navy. With a total force of over 1300
the loss was by disease, in camp and
field, officers and men included, only five.”
As to the authorized loan of $200,000,-
000. which was taken entirely by small
bidders, the President says: “This was a
most encouraging and significant result,
showing the vast resources of the nation
and the determination of the people to up
hold their country’s honor.”
Taking up chronologically the events of
the war. the President reviews them care
fully. The first encounter was the shell
ing of Matanzas on April 27. This was
followed by an engagement which was
“destined to mark a memorable epoch in
maritime warfare.” This was Commo
dore Dewey’s wonderful victory at
Manila on May 1. “The effect of
this remarkable victory,” says the*
President, “upon the spirit of our peo
ple and on the fortunes of war was in
stant. A prestige of invincibility thereby
attached to our arms, which continued
throughout the struggle.”
The President says that “only reluct
ance to cause needless loss of life and
property prevented the early storming
and capture of the city (Manila) ind
therewith the absolute military occupancy
of the whole group.”
Lieut. Hobson’s Exploit.
Following the memorable trip of the
battleship Oregon from San Francisco
to Key West and the bombardment of
San Juan and the forty or Santiago,
to which special reference is made, the
President says: “The next act in the
war thrilled not alone the hearts of our
countrymen but the world- by its excep
tional heroism. On the night of June 3
Lieut. Hobson, ailed by seven volunteers,
blocked the outlet from Santiago harbor
by sinking the collier Merrimac in the
channel, under a fierce fire from the
shore batteries, escaping with their lives
as by a miracle, but falling into the hands
of the Spaniards. It is a most gratfying
incident of the war that the bravery of
this little band of heroes was cordially
appreciated by the Spanish admiral.”
The campaign of Santiago, resulting in
the investment and the capture of that
city, is referred to as a brilliant achieve
ment. A brief review is then presented
of the decisive naval combat of the war
on July 3, resulting in the complete de
struction of Admiral Cervera’s fleet. Con
cerning it the President says: “Where
all so conspicuously distinguished them
selves, from the commanders to the gun
ners and the unnamed heroes in the boil
er rooms, each and all contributing to
ward the achievements of this astound
ing victory, for which neither ancient nor
modern history affords a parallel in the
completeness of the event and the mar
velous disproportion of casualties, it
would be invidious to single out any one
for special honor.”
In tills connection the President says:
"Nor can we be unmindful of the achieve
ments of our builders, mechanics and ar
tisans tor their part in the construction
of our warships.”
Tribute to Dead Heroes.
As to the success gained by the arms of
the United States in Cuba, the President
says that the earnest and lasting grati
tude of the nation is unsparingly due.
“Nor should we alone remember the gal
lantry of the living: the dead claim our
tears and our losses by battle and disease
must cloud any exultation at the result
and teach ns the awful cost of war how
ever rightful the cause or signal the vic
tory.”
4 he total casualties in killed and wound
ed in the army during the war with Spain
were: Officers killed, 23; enlisted men
killed, 257; total, 28°; officers wounded,
ILL enlisted men wounded, 3 404; total,
Th Of the navy: Killed, .17; wound
ed, 07: died ns result of wounds, 1; in
valided from service, 0; total, 91.
“It will be observed that while our navy
was engaged in two great battles and in
numerous perilous undertakings in block
ade and bombardment and more than 50,-
000 of our troops were transported to dis
tant lands and were engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skirmishes
in unfamiliar territory, we lost in both, arms
of the service a total of 1008 killed and
wounded; and in the entire campaign by
land and sea we did not lose a gun or a
Hag or a transport, or a ship, and with the
exception of the crew of the Merrimae,
not a soldier or sailor was taken prison
’fhe President bears testimony and pays
fitting tribute “to the patriotism and devo
tion of that large portion of our army
which, although eager to be ordered to the
post of greatest exposure, fortunately was
not required outside of the United States.”
The did their whole duty and earned
the gratitude of the nation. The Presi
dent then says: “In tracing those events
we are constantly reminded of our obli
gations to the Divine Master for His
watch!nl care over us and His safe guid
ance, for which the nation makes rever
ent acknowledgment and offers' humble
prayer for the continuance of His fa
vors.”
Peace Negotiations,
The peace negotiations which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago
and the preparation and signing of the
protocol are discussed at length. Re
telling to the work of the peace commis
sioners in Paris the President says:
“Thes>e negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be able
to lay a definite treaty before the Senate
with a review of the steps leading to its
signature.
“I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment tenure of the new possessions
which will come to ns as the result of
the war with Spain. Such discussion
will be appropriate after the treaty of
peace shall he ratified. In the meantime,
and until the Congress has legislated oth
erwise. it will be my duty to continue the
military governments which have existed
since cur occupation and give to the peo
ple security in life and property and en
couragement under a just and beneficent
rule. ,
“As soon as we are in possession of
Cuba and have pacified t’’e island it will
be necessary to give aid and direction to
its people to form a government for them
selves. This should be undertaken at the
earliest moment consistent with safety
and assured success. It is important that
our relations with this people shall be of
the most friendly character and our com
mercial relations close and reciprocal. It
should be our duty to assist in every
proper way to build up the waste places
of the islands, encourage the industry of
the people and assist them to form a gov
ernment which shall be free and inde
pendent, thus realizing the best aspira
tions of the Cuban people.
“Spanish rule must be replaced by a
just, benevolent and humane government,
created by the people of Cuba, capable
of performing all international obligations
and which shall encourage thrift, industry
and prosperity and promote peace and
good-will among all of the inhabitants,
whatever may have been their relations in
the past. Neither revenge nor passion
should have a place in the new govern
ment. Until there is complete tranquilli
ty in the island and stable government in
augurated military occupation will be con
tinued.”
Other Foreign Relations.
The President says that with one ex
ception, the rupture with Spain, the In
tel course of the United States with the
great family of nations during the past
year has been marked with cordiality.
Concerning negotiations with the Argen
tine government, initiated with a view
to removing differences in cable rate
charges imposed against messages pass
ing from and to the United States, the
President expresses his sincere desire for
an international agreement whereby in
terchange of messages over connecting
lines may be regulated on a fair basis of
uniformity, and adds:
“It would be strange were the nations
not in time brought to realize that modern
civilization, which owes so much of its
progress to the annihilation of time by the
electrical force, demands that this all-im
portant means of communication be a heri
tage of all peoples, to be administered and
regulated in their common behalf.”
To the killing and wounding of strik
ing miners in Luzerne county, Pa., which
aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun
garian government, many of the miners
being subjects of that government, the
President expects to reach a harmonious
understanding on the subject with Aus
tria-Hungary.
The hope is expressed that the restric
tions imposed by Belgium on the impor
tation of American cattle will at an early
date be relaxed, so as to admit live Amer
ican cattle under proper regulations.
The Nicaragua Canal.
The President expects that the Nica
ragua canal commission will shortly be
able to report finally. “I have not hesi
tated to express my convictions,” says the
President, “that considerations of expedi
ency and international policy is between
the several governments interested in the
construction and control of an inter
ocoanic canal by this route require the
maintenance of the status quo until the
canal commission shall have reported and
the United States Congress shall have
had the opportunity to pass finally noon
the whole matter.”
The President regards, in view of our
newly-acquired interests in the Pacific
ocean, the construction of such a mari
time highway as now more than ever in
dispensable.
Concerning the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire, the
President says that our position among
nations gives the equitable claim to con
sideration and friendly treatment in this
regard, and that it will be his aim to serve
our large interest!! in the Orient by ail
means appropriate to the constant policy
of our government.
Reference is made to several claims of
citizens of the United States pending
against other nations and to the settle
ment of other claims during the past year.
After reviewing the work of the Paris
exposition commission the President rec
ommends that the appropriation for the
exhibit of the United States at the Paris
exposition be increased to .$1,000,000.
Our relations with Great Britain have
continued on the most friendly footing,
and the President says it would give him
especial satisfaction if he should be au
thorized to communicate to Congress a
favorable conclusion of the pending nego
tiations with Great Britain in respect to
the Dominion of Canada.
Report on Hawaii.
The President reports that the Ha
waiian commission lias fulfilled its mis
sion and that its report will be laid be
fore Congress at an early day. “It is
believed that their recommendation will
have the earnest consideration due to the
magnitude of the responsibility resting
upon you to give such shape to the rela
tionship of these mid-Padtic lands to our
home union as will benefit both in the
highest degree.”
Referring to the proposal of the Czar of
Russia for a general reduction of the
great military establishments the Presi
dent says: “His majesty was at once in
formed of the cordial sympathy of this
government with the principle involved
in his exalted proposal and of the readi
ness of the United States to take part in
the conference.”
The President says that the newly-ac
credited envoy of the United States to the
Ottoman portc carries instructions looking
to the disposal of matters in controversy
with Turkey for a number of years.
Alluding to the financial affairs of the
country the President says in part: “The
secretary of the treasury reports that the
receipts of the government from all
sources during tin* fiscal year ended June
JO, 1808, including $94,751,223 received
from sale of Pacific railroads, amounted
to $405,321,835, and Its expenditures to
$443,308,582.
"It is estimated upon the basis of pres
ent revenue laws that the receipts of the
government for the year ending June 30.
1800. will he $577,874,047, and its ex
penditures $080,874,047, resulting in a de
ficiency of $112,000,000.
Needs of the Army.
Under the act of congress approved April
2G, 1897, authorizing the president in his
discretion, upon a declaration of war by
congress or a declaration by congress that
war exists, I directed the increase of the
regular array to the maximum of 62,000,
authorized in said act.
There are now in the regular army 57,862
officers and men. In said act it was pro
vided “that at the end of any war in
which the United States may become in
volved the army shall be reduced to a
peace basis by the transfer in the oame
arm cf service or absorption by promotion
or honorable dlyoharge, under such regu
lations a> the secretary of war may es
tablish, cf supernumerary commissioned of
ficers and the honorable discharge or
transfer of supernumerary enlisted men,
and nothing contained in this act shall be
construed as authorizing the peiunanent
increase cf the commissioned or enlisted
force of the regular army beyond that now
provided by the law in force prior to The
passage of this act except as to the in
crease of twenty-five majors, provided for
in section IS thereof.”
The importance cf legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest and the recommendation of
the secretary of war for that purpose has
my unqualified approval. There can be
no question that at this time, and prob
ably for some time in the future, 100,000
men will be none too many to meet the
necessities of the situation. At all events,
whether that number shall be required
permanently or not, the power should be
given to the president to enlist that force
if in his discretion it should be necessary
and the- further discretion should be given
him to recruit within the above limit from
the inhabitants of the islands with the
government of which we are charged.
It ie my purpose to muster out the en
tire volunteer army as scon as the con
gress shall provide for the increase of the
regular establishment. This will be only
an act of justice and will be much appre
ciated by the brave men who left their
homes and employments to help the coun
try in its emergency.
Additions to Navy.
The following recommendations of the
secretary of the navy relative to the in
crease of the navy have my earnest ap
proval;
1. Three seagoing sheathed and coppered
battleships of about 13,500 tons trial dis
placement, carrying the heaviest armor and
most powerful ordnance for vessels of
their class and to have the highest prac
ticable speed and great radius of action.
Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and
armament, $3,600,000 each.
2. Three sheathed and coppered armored
cruisers cf about 12,000 tons trial dis
placement, carrying the heaviest armor
and mc.'.'t powerful ordnance for vessels
of their class and to have the hignest
practicable upeed and great radius of ac
tion. Estimated cost, exclusive cf armor
and armament, $4,000,000 each.
3. Three sheathed and coppered pro
tected cruisers of about 6,000 tons trial
displacement; to have the highest practi
cable speed and great radium of action and
to carry the most powerful ordnance suit
able for veesel.3 of their class. Estimated
cost, exclusive of armor and armament,
$2,150,000 each.
4. Six sheathed and coppered cruisers
of about 2,500 tons trial displacement; to
have the highest speed compatible with
good cruising qualities, great radium of ac
tion and to carry the most powerful ord
nance suited to vessels of their clas.s.
Estimated cost, exclusive of armament,
$1,141,800 each.
I join with the secretary of the navy
in recommending the grades of admiral
and vice-admiral be temporarily revived,
to be filled by officers who have specially
distinguished themselves in the war with
Spain.
The Pension Roll.
There were on the pension rolls on June
30, 1898, 993,714 names, an increase of
nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls
on the same day of the preceding year.
The amount appropriated by the act of
Dec. 22, 1896, for the payment of pensions
for the fiscal year 1898 was $140,000,009.
Eight million, seventy thousand, eight
hundred and seventy-two dollars and forty
six cents was appropriated by the act of
March 31, 1898, to cover deficiencies in
army pensions and repayment in the sum
of $12,020.33, making a total of $148,082,-
892.79 available for the payment of pen
sions during the fiscal year 1898. The
amount disbursed from that sum was
$144,651,879.80, leaving & balance of $3,431,-
012.99 unexpended on the 30th cf June.
1898, which was covered into the treas
ury. There were 389 names added to the

at the second sescion of the Fifty-fifui
congresc, making a total of 6,486 pen

The expenditures were $1,081,633.79, leav

English Trout in Africa.
Fourteen years ago Lachlan Mac
lean carried 20.000 ova of English trout
to Capo Colony with the object of experi
menting with the acclimatization of that
lish in Africa. In spite of various difii
culties and failures the experiment proved
successful. The tremjt. having once be
come established, flourished, and the in
land streams of the Colony are now being
gradually stocked with the fish.
THE NATION’S FINANCE.
•*
Comptroller Dawes Makes Some
Important Recommenda
tions to Congress.
Washington, D. C., Dec. s.—The an
nual report to Congress of the comptrol
ler of the currency. Charles G. Dawes,
for the year ending October 31, has been
made public. Making a general state
ment is to the condition of the national
banks during the year as shown by tbe
five reports required from the banks, the
comptroller then goes on to discuss vari
ous financial reform schemes that have
bun advanced, lie does not review in
detail the plans for the modification of
the currency and banking systems, which
are now the subject of economic and gen
eral discussion throughout the country,
but confines his discussion to the general
principles underlying all of them, because
they seem to ignore the interests of bank
depositors, with whose protection the
comptroller is particularly charged.
Discussing the assumed danged of cur
rency contraction and the methods pro
posed to secure desired elasticity of cur
rency. the comptroller decides:
b a- —That there is existing no such con
dition of the United States finances, reve
nues, or credit as to justify the proposition
that the shifting of the burden of gold re
demption of outstanding currency from the
government to the banks is so important as
to necessitate of itself radical changes and
concessions in national banking laws relative
to the issue of notes, which changes and con
cessions would not be considered wise if the
interests of the community, irrespective of
government finances, were aione considered.
Second—That if, from considerations of
general public policy Irrespective of govern
mental finances, bank note issues secured
only by commercial assets of banks seem un
wise. that the resources, credit, and financial
condition of the United .States are such that
by means of revenue laws and other amend
ments to law suggested by the President in
his last annual message, a safer ratio be
tween its outstanding circulation and gold
reserve can be attained, the stability of the
present gold standard insured, and the cur
rency maintained upon a souud basis without
contraction.
“In tlie bank note issues of foreign coun
tries, in case of insolvency.” says the comp
troller, “the noteholder would, it is under
stood, enjoy no preference over the deposit
holder. They would share ratably in the as
sets. To give the credit which enables notes
of these great banks to circulate, restricted
by stringent laws as they are, no injustice
to depositors such as is proposed in these
plans for the United States is necessary, in
one country only—Canada—are the notehold
ers preferred over the depositors in case of
insolvency. The note-issuing banks of Can
ada are thirty-eight in number, with a com
bined circulation of about $38,000,000.”
Fairness to Depositors.
The comptroller states that he cannot
accept as safe any deductions? drawn
from ihe banknote system of these cen
tral institutions of eastern Canada which
would tend to justify the applicaCon of
the laws governing that system to the
3000 national banks of this country, and
lays down these propositions;
Asa fundamental proposition, any bank
note system depending for security upon the
commercial assets of banks and sanctioned
by government should be inherently fair in
its relation to the deposit-holding Creditors
and the note-holding creditors of an insolvent
bank.
No system is inherently fair which -rentes
a preference of the note-holder over the de
posit-holder in the distribution of the assets
of an insolvent bank. The necessity of the
preference under any such system in this
country to give security and credit to the
notes demonstrates that it is the depositors
of the country and not the banks upon whom
the great weight of the guarantee of the
note issue must fall. If the present condi
tions of governmental currency demand re
forms, to secure which will entail cost, it is
better for the government, as the representa
tive of all the people, and under all the cir
cumstances connected with our banking sys
tem, to pay an ascertained and exact cost
direct than to endeavor to evade it by grant
ing extensive currency privileges to batiks
which of necessity must reimburse them
selves from the coin muni tj* and the depositor
class for any cost which tney incur in assum
ing the burden of gold redemption or main
taining the credit of their notes.
Plasticity of Bank Currency.
The comptroller discusses the question
of the elasticity needed in bank currency
and commenting upon the great elasticity
of the check and draft circulation of the
country says;
While in this country, with its extended
system of banks and its great development
of check and draft system, some degree of
elasticity in bank note issues is desirable, it
is not essential that it should be an amount
so large as to make necessary for its security
any injustice upon the depositor and thus,
by interfering with the check and draft sys
tem, defeat one of its own prime objects.
Asa conclusion the comptroller would
make the following recommendations in
regard to the present laws governing the
issue of national bank notes:
First—The existing bank note system,
based upon deposit of government, bonds as
security, should not now be abandoned.
Second—Foi the purpose of allowing elas
ticity to bank note issues to protect the banks
and the community in time of panic, a small
amount of uncovered notes, in addition to the
secured notes, should be authorized by law
under the following limitations:
They should be subjected to so heavy a
tax that they could not be issued in normal
times for the purpose of profit, but would
be available in times of emergency. The tax
should be so large upon the solvent issuing
banks as to provide a fund which, in connec
tion with the pro rata share of the assets
of an insolvent bank, would be sufficient to
redeem the notes in full without necessitat
ing any preference of note-holders over de
positors of any insolvent issuing bank. The
tax should be so large as to force this cur
rency into retirement as soon as the emer
gency passes.
Such a currency could be used only to les
sen the evil effects of the too rapid liquida
tion of credits which are collapsing under a
financial panic, but could not be profitably
used as a basis of business speculation and
inflation. It should be to the business com
munity what the clearing-house certificates
are to our cities in times of panic—a rem
edy for an emergency not an instrument of
current business.
The comptroller states that in the ad
ministration of_ insolvent banks in the in
terest of creditors he lias effected an
imal savings approximating $lOO,OOO.
Concerning bank examinations, he re
ports that during the year he has ex
tended over the cities of New York, Bos
ton, Philadelphia and Baltimore the sys
tem of semi-annual visitations by exam
iners, in force in all other sections of the
country. He has utilized tiie examiners
in investigations into the credit of heavy
debtors of banks where such indebtedness
constituted a menace to the safety of
banks, and where, despite the criticisms
of the comptroller and the efforts of the
bank officials, no material reductions in
the amount of the indebtedness could be
lunh He adds;
Notwithstanding the number ofh auks in
operation on September 110, 1898, is less than
at any date of report since December 19
1890, the amount of individual deposits, loans
ami discounts and total resources is greater
than at any time during the existence of the
national banking system. On September 2<>
for the first time, the aggregate resources
reached and exceeded the 54.000.000.000
mark, the increase since October 5 1597 be
ing 5998.:!77.:;:i7.i0
A comparison of the last returns with
those of October 9. 1897. indicates an increase
luring the year of $104.992.180 in loans and
liscounts: $79.194.980 in government securi
ties or deposit with the treasurer of the
United States to secure circulating notes ano
public deposits and the amount, held bv the
banks, 897.001.527 in special and legal 'tend
ers.
The reduction of $29.■46.9,000 in the amount

The comptroller recommends that do
mestic branch banking should be legal
ized in communities of less than 2000 in
habitants, many of which are now un
able to support independent banks, hut
opposes the granting of any more liberal
privileges of branch banking than these,
on the grounds that such privileges would
place the larger hanko of the grear cities
m competition with the banks of the
smaller communities, and would probably
result in a rapid centralization of the
banking business of the country in the
bands of a constantly-lessening number
ot institutions.
In connection with this branch of Ids
report he discusses at length the neces
sity for the establishment of interna
tional and intercolonial branch banking,
hanking in the Colonies.
Of the Hawaiian and Porto Rican
hanking and trade situations he says;
'lhe foundation for the greater growth of
trade between the United States and her
felonies must be speedily and firmly laid in
proper banking laws, which will result in
enabling her merchants to do business with
the people of the colonies without the disad
vantages existing at present.
Our present national banking laws do not
authorize the establishment of American in
ter-colonial banks, nor could any national
bank establish a branch in a territory or
colony such as Porto Rico or Hawaii, even it
our present laws unchanged were extended
over it.
While it is questionable whether Congress
should legalize the establishing of foreign or
colonial branches by national banks trans
acting business under the present law. that
it should at least pass laws authorizing, un
der proper restrictions, the general incor
poration of banks organized to carry on in
ternational and intercolonial banking,
distinguished from domestic banking, admits
of no reasonable doubt.
Unless some such legislation is provided
the American exporter and importer, in his
trade with America's own colonies, will he
compelled to endure all the disadvantages
under which, in all South American markets,
and in many other markets in the world, he
now labors in bis competition with foreign
ers enjoying superior banking facilities.
Ho says in conclusion:
‘‘ln view of the conditions and neces
sities of our trade with our new terri
tories of Porto Rico and Hawaii, and
with other South American countries, as
"well as with those other territories over
which our country must exercise a more
or loss measure of control, the comptrol
ler earnestly recommends the passage of
laws authorizing the incorporation of
banks organized for the purpose of car
rying on international and intercolonial
branch banking.”
