I- . rT"l HAT the city water supply at the
present timo is a constant raon
.'; ;I aco to the health of the Tosi-
i dents of Salt Lake nud that
drastic an,d important changes should
' be mado looking toward tho protection
and sanitation of tho city watersheds
and streams, is the substanco of tho re
port of the sub-committco of the Coin-
racrcial club committee on sanitation
and public health, which was made to
a membership mooting last night and
adoptod. The committee mado its re
port after two months of investigation
into the existing conditions in the four
crhjods from -which the city's supply
of water is taken.
Outsido of the matter of protecting
public health through, tho control of the
t water supply probably tho mosl import-
ant recommendation mado was that the
Mj wafer of Eig Cottonwood canyon bo
impounded by tho construction of a res-
j Say Supply Small.
Hj j The committee, in its lengthy report,
i calls attention to tho fact that the city
1 water supply per day is 9,000,000 gal-
Jons, which, allowing forty-five gallons
por day for each pcrsqn, moans that the
city ha3 only two ordinary days' water
supply available at a time, ,Thc Tcport
mentions tho fact that. .New York city
HJ keeps a supply stored Sufficient to last
li73 days.
Hj Tho members recommended that the
report of tho committee, which covers
twenty-eiglifc closely tj-pcwritlcu pages,
Hj bo ordered printed in pamphlet form by
( tho board of governors and distributed
' for the benefit of the public. Tho mem-
bors of the sub-committee which has
Hj conducted tho exhaustive investigation
into city water supply conditions arc:
William Bowen, chairmnn; Dr. Georgo
W. Middloton, Dr. Tx. W. Tyndalc. Jo
beph A. West and "W. Mont Ferry. They
J were assisted throughout the entire iu-
vostigation by E. A. Shcrmau of Ogdon,
Hj district forester of the United States
Hj forest service, and E. II. Clarke of this
, city, supervisor of tho Wasatch national
forest, which is in tho vicinity of the
watershed', citonding southward to Pro
vo canyon.
Recommends Legislation.
t "Wo have abundant proof that politl-
j ' clans do not make good sanltists," says
I the report of the committee, and It
1 j therefore strongly tirgcs that the mat-
tor bo kept from becoming a political
issue. Tho committed calls attention to
- tho fact that in tho development of the
state, buclncss interests have so fully
j I absorbed the public attention that this
fl r matter of health and sanitation has been
overlooked to a great extent. The com
mittee recommends tho passage of logls
latlon that will largely extend the Jurls
diction and powers of the stale hoard of
health.
In an.troduc.lnc: the recommendations
and findings of tho committee, tho report
xnys: "Tho condition In serious, alarm -Ingly
serious, and imiat hc immediately
corrected and brought under control. AVe
plulnly etata that no man can afford to
oppo.s thin movement who hopes to rc
tain the respect of this communltv. be
ho privato citizen or public official.'"
For City Control.
1 The report calls attention to tho fact
, that Salt Lake City holds Jurisdiction
over Us watersheds for a distance of
only ten miles, that ten miles Is scarcely
otic-half tho distance to the summit o"f
! Parleys canyon, and that it carries only
i a part of tho way up Big Cottonwood
I ami the other canyons. It insists that
' tho proper tribunal be immediately pelt-
tloncd to extend tho city's rights to the
1 topmost point and bring all of each shed
, under tho city's absolute control.
The committee began Its work on
October 11. Parley's canyon was the
first to come under its inspection. Crltl
i clRm In made of tho lack of proper pro-
tectlon " of tho intake reservoir, from
which tho water Is taken. The report
advises the construction of a wall not
1 lesn than two feet In height above the
present wall to deflect tho wash from
tho railroad grade.
Say Conditions Are Filthy.
! 1 "At Roach's half way hoimc. the condl-
tiona wore of such a character as should I
never have been permitted. " savs the
roport. "SVc fail to notu that tlk-rc It

At Bullock's ranch and above the
., committee found chickens and cows In

i mlt conditions wero found to be fair
according to the report. Sheep trails
wero found within six inches of Ioun-
tain Dell creek and there were open
, bridges over which sheep cros, with no
provision made to prevent dirt from
dropping into the water below.
, City Creek Better.
Conditions In City Creek canon were
a found to hc better. In most cases cx-
tHtlng conditions In that enhyou arc re
1 i ported to be pat-sable and can
; be kept up to standard with little difil-

Terrible Suffering
Eczema AH Over Baby's Body
"When my baby was four months
old his face broke out with ecaema,
and at sixteen months o agct his face,
3iands and arms wero in a. dreadful
ntate. The eczema spread all over IiIh
! body. We had to put a mask or cloth
over his face and tic up his hands.
Finally we gave him Hood's Sursapa
xilla and In a few months hc was en
tirely cured. Today hc Is a healthy
boy." Mrs. Inez Lewis Baring, Maine.
Hood's Sarsaparllla cures blood dis
eases and builds u.p the system.
Get it today in usual llcjuld form oi
Chocolated tablets called Sarsatabs
will have no reason to entertain fears.'.
"Carelessness and IndliTcrencc" arc
used in the report to describe (he al
lrged lack" of effort, to keep conditions
up to standard In Dig Cottonwood can
yon. It states that owing to the fact
that there is no part of this canyon, or
Parleys canyon, where waste can be de
posited without ultimately finding its
way Into tho city water supply, the en
tlro territory must be put under regu
lations which will compel a strict ob
servance of sanitary rules. .
The construction camp of the Utah
Light & Power company at tho entrance
to Big Cottonwood Is criticised by the
committee The disposal of waste mat
ter there is alleged to be insanitary.
Similar conditions arc reported to exist
at Stairs station and at Camp No. C.
Kccommendatlons aro made for changes
at .Maxfield lodge, nnd at the "Old Mlno"
tho report says that "conditions are ab
solutely without excuse, and worso than
that, they have existed this way for
years,"
Forest Rule Commended.
Commendation Is made of the "high
standard of cleanliness" at the AVasatch
forest nurseries and the rangers' quar
ters. The American Mining company Is
reported to lease its ground for sheep
grazing each season and there Is noth
ing to prevent the waBh from the hill
going directly Into tho creek.
Tho construction of an Inclnorator is
recommended for Brighton. "Taken al-1
together." reports the committee, "Brigh
ton is at the present the most to be
feared of any of the conditions exist
ing in all of our canyons." A number of
recommendations are made regarding the
disposal of waste there.
On account of the weather the commit
too could not visit Emigration canyon.
Tho report slates that such water as
comes from tha,t canyon is taken Into
tho .city through subterranoan How. In
cinerators are also recommended in that
canyon.
For Proper Safeguards.
In concluding its report, the commit
tee frames tentative legislation for cities
and towns and for tho state, looking to
ward tho establishment of proper safe
guards on all watersheds. It recommends
the bill of the state board of health which
proposes to turn tho control of all springs
and water supplies over to the Jurisdic
tion of that hoard. It calls attention to
the fact that there was "an utter lack
of Interest" when a similar bill came be
fore the legislature of 1911 and failed of
passage. It recommends the creation of
a lobby committee of the Commercial
club to urge and promote interest In the
passage of the bill at the next session of
the legislature.
Another bill Is recommended which
would givo the cities, towns and villages
of the state control of their entire wa
tersheds. Two bills and seven city ordi
nances arc suggested in tho report.
In speaking of the matter of impound
ing the water of Dig Cottonwood tho com
mittee proposes that "the pcoplo of Salt
Lake demand of their commissioners that
they Immediately take measures to im
pound the waters of Big Cottonwood can
yon, which supplies four times as much
water from its stream sources as anv
other canyon used by the city. That it
Is right and proper for the people to make
this demand for their own defense, and to
provide themselves with an ample sup
ply of water for all uses and purposes in
storage reserve to provide against the
calamity of a break, landslide or lack of
precipitation or drought."
Papers by Experts.
Excellent and comprehensive treatises
on subjects relating to sanitation and the
prevention of contagious and Infectious
djseasca aro added to tho report. "Ele
ments of Drainage From Bacteriological
Standpoints" la tho title of a paper by
Dr. Georgo W. TSIIddlcton; "Tho Bacteri
ology of Typhoid Fever" is ably discussed
and some startling information on tho
subject Imparted in a paper by Dr. R. TV.
Tyndalo; ''What Other States arc Doing
in Their Mountain "Roglons Regarding
Sanitation" is told in a paper written
by J. A, West, and William Bowen, chair
man of the subcommittee which jriade.the
report, adds an instructive treatise on
"The Physical Disposal of Drainage to
Avoid Contamination to Water Courses."
One of the interesting features of the
meeting last evening was a discussion of
tho methods of preventing tvnhold enl-
I demies, by Dr. T. B. Bcatty, secretary
of tho stale board of health, and one
of tho factors in arousing the interest
which the Commercial club has taken
In the present investigation of water
supply conditions both here and through
out the state.
Typhoid Ravages.
Dr. Bcatty told his auditors that tv
phold fever, which hc tcriped tho most
easily preventable of all diseases, claims
on an average of 300 victims in Salt
Lake City each year. He termed the
lack of protection of the city water
supply "a dangerous menace to tho pub
lic health." He suggested an immedi
ate and thorough inspection of the vari
ous streams, with the destruction or
removal of all Impurities' discovered.
Dr. Bcatty furthermore suggested that
a rigid patrol system bo established cov
ering the Ptrcamsj and watershed. He
said he believed a sand filtration ev8
tcm would be the best solution of tho
water question and that It should receive
tho early attention of (he city authori
ties. Ho advised tho boiling of all wa
ter used for culinary purposes at tho
present time.
In substance. Dr. Beatty's address was
the same as the ono ho drllx'crcd when
the fprmor water supply protection bill
was before tho legislature at Its last
session.

WASHINGTON, Dec. c Presi
dent Taft will make no fur
ther effort to have congress
reduce the tariff. In a "gen
oral" messago to congress submitted
today, the president learly indicated
his intention of leaving further tariff
revision to ?-tr. Wildou and the congress
just elected.
"Now that a new congress has been
elected on a platform of tariff for
revenue only, rather than a protective
tariff, and is to revise the tariff on
that basis J said tho pesident, "it is
needless for mo to occupy tho time ol!
congress with arguments or recom
mendations in favor of a protective
tariff."
This message, the second submitted
by the president sinco tbo present ses
sion began, will bo his last of a general
character. It dealt with ovcry depart
ment of the govcranicnt except tho
stato department, recommended much
of the legislation which Mr. Taft pre
viousl' bad urged upon the attention of
congress, and look up and discussed at
length several subjects comparatively
new.
Deprecates Battleship Policy.
Mr. Taft came out strongly against in
dependence for tho Philippines, pro
posed, ho said, in a bill now before con
gress. He deprecated tho new policy of
ono battleship a year instead of two, and
indorsed again the scheme of currency
reform proposed by tho national mone
tary commission.
Conservation was lightly touched, the
president recommending the amendment
of bills now before congress so that wa
ter power companies which dam naviga
ble Tivcra will contribute to the Improve
ment of these streams.
4 Ho declared that no radical 4
4 change in the Sherman antitrust 4
! law was needed, and praised the
4 supremo court for its recently an- 4
4 nounced changes in rules or equity -
4 procedure. In this connection the
4 prosldcnt nsked congress to pass 4
4" legislation which would allow tho 4
v supreme court to formulate ruins 4
Y of procedure under the common 4
Y- law In federal courts and predicted tf
4 '-hat such action would facilitate
4 justice in those courts and reduce 4
4 tho cost of litigation to the public 4
Good Word for Goethals.
The Punauift canal was dismissed in a
few words, tho president, pronhnsvlng Its
opening In tho latter half of WIS. Tie
took occasion, however, to dcelaro that
congress should reward the work of
Colonel Goethals by an appointment as
major general with tho provision thut ho
become chief of engineers when tho term
of tho present Incumbent expires. He
mado only a brief reference to tho dis
pute with Great Rrltaln over tho Panama
cunal act and said that when a formal
protest was lodged against that act it
would bo taken up by tho United States,
The army tho president discussed at
some length. He praised thu army legis
lation of the last congress, but :mld that
provision should bo mado by law so
that the nation's foreign regiments may
bo always maintained upon a war foot
ing; and hc urged the passage of tho
pending military pay bill, designed to
make service In the militia nioro entil
ing, and showed that the homo army will
be nothing more than a "skeleton" until
congress provides that It be concentrated

I- "In the Philippine islanda wo r
I- have embarked upon an expcrl- v
meat iinpreccdenlwl In dealing h

I. President Taft.
"We iiro dcvelopinp there conditions

Through the unifying forces of a common

In local self government, wo are en
deavoring to evolve a homogeneous peo

For educational. nanllary and political
reasons, tho president said, this country
should not consent lo grant Independence
at this time, ...
"Tf the task wo havo undertaken in
