ties In the county, 83 community projects
have been conducted during the present
year, and the County Farm Bureau has
announced that It stands ready to en
large this work next year.
Tho program of work which the Chit- 1
tenden County Farm Bureau has out
lined for 1921 includes organization in
every community in the county where
the farmers are willing to back the pro
ject; the promotion of better farm man
agement through the keeping of exact
records; dairy improvement to promote
bettcr breeding nnd disease eradication;
tho development of a permanent system
of soil fertility and efficient handling of
crops; the Improvement of the quality of
maple products so that they will bring
better prices; the promotion of efficiency
In household management through home
records and home conveniences; educa-
tlon along the lines of food preparation
for The furm worker and the growing
chlld; promotion of sewing clubs giving
instruction about how to provide better
;lothing for less money; boys' and girls'
clubs to educate the young peoplo in Im-
proved farm and homo practices and
train them for rural leadership; to do-
velop tho best county fair In Northern
New England.
A program such ns this surely deserves
tho support of every farmer in Chltten-
den county. If the farmers are found
ready to cooperate with each other In
such a program for the betterment of
..
mcmselves and the entire population of
the county, wo are sure that those In
the towns will be ready to cooperate with
those on tho farms "for better markets

Wc shall all want to remember President
Wilson in the future for the great good
ho did In manifold ways rather than as
the embodiment of tho defects attributed
'o him by partisanship. President Wilson I
evidently looked Into the future when he
paid v he had not so much laid before
Congress a series of recommendations as
he had sought to uttor a confession of
faith, of the faith in which he was bred,
and "which It Is my solemn purpose to
stand by until my last fighting day."
That is characteristic of Woodrow Wll-
son. Whatever may have been his short-
comings, in diplomacy and as a Judge of
what the American people wanted, ha
stood by his guns to the very end. In-
deed, his pathetic Illness was In effect
tjhe net of a commander "going down with
his ship."
And yet President Wilson does not omit
concrete forms of Hugeci'lvcness for thi
nation's lawmnkers. He outllnct In gon-
eral terms some of the aids the country
manifestly needs nlthough he does not
outline In each case tho way in which
that aid can be effetlvcly extended. His
program Includes revision of ,tax leglsla-
