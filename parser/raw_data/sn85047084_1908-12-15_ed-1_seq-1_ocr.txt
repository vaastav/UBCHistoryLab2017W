ON SCRAP PILE
Yacht Hawaii Would Not Sell
for Enough to Clear Her
of $3000 Debt.
"If the yacht Hawaii were to be
Lroken up, she would be worth several
thousand dollars tor old metal, but I
doubt if anyone would buy her for
that price as a yacht," said W. II. Mc
Inerny yesterday, discussing the sought
ifor disposition of the racing craft that
Aost somewhere in the twenty thousands
and which is ballasted now with a debt
of three thousand. Mr. MclDerny went
further in one stage of the discussion
and gave as his opinion that the yacht
could not find a buyer willing to take
her over for the amount of the balance
due on her, except as scrap.
"I have nothing to" do with the plan
of asking the contributors to the yacht
fund to transfer their share in the
yacht to the Hawaii Yacht Club," he
said. "All I know is that the yacht
is in the keeping of three of us, and
that besides the thousand dollars we
each advanced for the race, all the cost
of her upkeep now falls on us person
ally. I think the plan proposed now,
however, is the best one. As things
are, each contributor holds a receipt for
money donated to the yacht fund, but
no one actually owns any snare of the
yacht. By transferring their stock to
the Yacht Club and becoming members
of the club, however, they would own
just the same in the yacht as now and
also have an interest in the club, which
has tangible assets. I do not know of
any other way to settle the ownership
of the boat. There would be no use
selling her with an idea of paying back
the contributors on a pro rata basis, be
cause she would not bring enough. Peo
ple will pay seven or eight thousand
dollars for an automobile, but no one
ere wants to put that amount of money
into a yacht any more."
US
hours to go over the long list of names
and kokua the special committee find
ings. The endorsements were made last
night solely on the basis of the carat
mark on the applicant's Democracy,
there being no attempt to delve into
the fitness of the various applicants for
the particular place each wanted on the
county payroll. The decisions in that
respect will be up to Fern and Jar
rett. Then, before the great time of ac
tually holding office comes, will come
the battle between the Democratic
Mayor if there is a Democratic Mayor
and the Republican Supervisors. So
far as the police force goes, of course,
Jarrett will have a free hand.
In all there were applications from
one hundred and seventy-three real and
near Democrats for various jobs on the
police force, and one hundred and four
teen for jobs under the Mayor. The
applications of more than half the will
ing ones were endorsed and'G. J. Wal
ler named to present the lists of the
eligible ones to Messrs. Fern and Jar
rett. In the rush for places it is singn
lar that the majority of Democrats
wanted the minor jobs. For the im
portant places only the few names given
at the head of the column were en-
j dorsed. There was only one application
j in sight for the office of County Engi
j neer, one of the best plums on the tree.
Johnny Wilson, who was supposed to
; be slated for this job, and perhaps is,
was not mentioned either as an appli
! cant or as one endorsed. 'Ihere was
only one application on file for the of
fice of secretary to the Mayor, that of
Lnaries Jj. itnodes. it seemed to be a
surprise to some present that no appli
cation was in from Henry W. Kinney,
of the Bulletin staff, who was supposed
to be doing some considerable canvass
ing for the position.
No one wants to be Senior Captain
of Police, evidently, although there is
room for putting n. A. Juen in the
role of applicant for that high post,
his endorsed application being for
"something on the police force."
From what could be gathered at the
meeting there is only one applicant for
the post of Chief of Detectives who
has a chance, that being the present
detective, who holds down the chief
tainship firmly. It was stated that
Sheriff-elect Jarrett favors Kalakiela
and will retain him in office.
The position of Coachman to the
Sheriff is something new, but may have
been added to the list of positions to
balance an expected one of Chauffeur
to the Mayor. Mr. Fern, It is said,
has already been sounding the Super
visors to learn if they would stand
an appropriation of $3000 for a 1909
model automobile for the 1909 model
Mavor.
There are plenty of applications for
the position to be vacated by Deputy
Sheriff-elect Rose, that of Sheriff's
clerk. For this job the committee has
endorsed the applications of Fred Tur
rill, Solomon Meheula, J. W. Asch and
Jose J. Diaa.
Among some of the other endorse
ments are the following:
receiving clerk, police station Wm.
A. Hall, George K. Lowe, S. H. Ka

It was explained after the meeting
last night that the choice of the Dem
ocratic Mayor or Sheriff is not neces
sarily limited to the endorsed list
when filling places. It may be that
neither one will be satisfied with the
names of the men presented by the
committee for certain positions, and
may nominate others. It is expected,
however, that the endorsement of the

ISOI AND HIS
WIFE ARRESTED
Two
Charges Already Against
Them Widespread
Conspiracy.
Warrants were issued yesterday
which seem to indicate that a wide
spread conspiracy has been discovered,
comparable to the Ten Dollar Club of
six or seven years ago. The criminal
acts which the investigation of United
States District Attorney Breckons seem
to have unearthed are the importation,
on quite an extensive scale, of Japa
nese women for immoral purposes.
Isoi, who figured quite importantly
in the Ten Dollar Club cases, and late
ly in the matter 0f a loan to Sheriff
Iaukea, and his wife Chise are be
lieved to be at the head of the combi
nation to carry on this unlawful busi
ness, and warrants for their arrest
on two separate charges of this of
fense were issued yesterday by United
States Commissioner Kingsbury ,on com
plaints sworn to by United States Dis
trict Attorney Breckons.
The two were arrested on the first
warrant ajid were released on bonds
furnished by Y. Anin and Kawamodo
in the sum of $1000. Later the other
warrants were issued and thev were
arrested a second time and released
ngain on bonds in the same amount
signed by two Japanese.
Ohiro, a Japanese man, was also ar
rested in connection with one of the
same cases.
In the two charges on which Isoi and
his wife have been arrested it ii
stated that the cwo Japanese women
whom they are charged with importing
were taken by Chise, Isoi's wife, to
Hilo to carry on their immoral trade
there. One of them, Miyo Nakamura,
has told the authorities about the
whole matter. She was brought here,
and was married to a Japanese, man
at the Immigrant Station. He at once
disappeared and the woman entered a
life of prostitution on the prompting
of Isoi and his wife. Though she made
considerable money, it practically all
went to Isoi and his wife.

LITTLE PINK
SLIPPER LOST
Police Department Investigates
the Waikiki Road Auto
Accident.
Investigation of the automobile acci
dent on Waikiki road Sunday night was
held in the office of Chief of Detectives
Kalakiela last evening, and all. who
were able to attend were present.
Among them were Frank Lewis the
chauffeur of the Kissel car which ran
car
j into and demolished the buggy driven
by Ed Duisenberg; Charley Ludwigsen,
Mr. Heine and another young man, all
ot whom were in the auto and were
upset into the duck pond. Bert Lloyd
who saw the accident from a Kapid
Transit car, gave testimony.
The accident occurred shortly after
11 o'clock. The buggy and two autos
were all headed in the same direction
toward Waikiki. Lewis' car was in
the rear. The auto in front of Lewis's
swerved to one side and passed around
Mr. Duisenberg 's buggy, and the Lewis
car, when within. a hundred feet of the
buggy swung over in the same direction
with the buggy and smashed into it,
throwing it against a telephone pole.
The machine was thrown around, smash
ed into a telephone pole with its front
gear, and struck a fence with the rear
portion, spilling the occupants from the
tonneau into a duek pond,
Mr. Duisenberg and Miss Eoth, who
were in the buggy, were- thrown violent
ly to the ground, and were both re
moved later on to the Queen 's HospitaL
During the night it was .thought that
Mr. .Duisenberg 's life was in' danger,
as he is a sufferer from heart disease
Yesterday it was understood that he
felt pain in his side, but both patients
are expected to be all right soon.
The two autos were traveling at
rapid rate, and fairly whizzed past the
electric car. Ed. Lewis told the Sheriff
yesterday that when Frank Lewis saw
the buggy ahead of him he honked his
horn, and that this action no doubt
caused Mr. Duisenberg to turn his bug
gy, unfortunately, to the side toward
which the auto was swinging to avoid
it. The result was a collision.
Mr. Duisenberg was driving about
the middle of the road, or, according
to some witnesses, a little to the right
of the center. He was within his
legal rights as to the use of the road,
A young ladv in the Lewis auto
after being fished out of the' 'duck
pond complained bitterly that she had
lost one of her pink slippers. A search
was made for the dainty piece of foot
gear, but it was not found.
A gentleman who resides in Kapio
lani Park says that the dizzy rate at
which autos travel on the Waikiki
y
road at night has made that thorough
fare unsafe for drivers of buggies and
hacks after 10 o'clock. There is real
need for stationing a motorcycle po
lice officer on the Waikiki road every
night, to prevent racing.
Another accident was narrowly
averted on the Waikiki road yesterday

KI SAYS HE SHOT
YEE IBJEIF-DEFENSE
Ki, the Korean who was arrested a
few nights ago for shooting another
Korean named Yee Sing, stated to Chief
of Detectives Kalakiela last evening
that he shot Yee Sing in self defense,
claiming that Yee tried to kill him with
a butcher knife. The knife was found
in front of Mr. Denison's house the
following morning, where the shooting
occurred.
"Pity for my child caused me to
search for the place where Yee Sing
had hid my wife from me," said Ki.
"I followed him all around town that
night, not wishing to harm him, but to
find where he was keeping my wife."
He admitted that he had a revolver,
but was unused to such implements of
warfare. When the two men came to
gether at the corner of Wilder avenue
and Makiki street, they had a long con
versation, Yee admitting that he was
living with Ki's wife. Yee pulled a
butcher knife when the argument be
came heated and made a slash at Ki,
and at that time Ki pulled the revolver
and fired at Yee.
