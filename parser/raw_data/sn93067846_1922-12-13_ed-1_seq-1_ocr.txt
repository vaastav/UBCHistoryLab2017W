MEET IN
_L0ND0N
France Regards It as
Last Effort to Obtain!
United Action by Al-j
lies on German Rep
arations
Paris, Dec. 7 (By the Associat
ed Press).?Premier Poincare will
'leave a? noon tomorrow for Don
don to attend the conference of al
lied premiers which is regarded by]
many here as the last great effort 1
of the entente to reach an agree
ment .on Germany's reparations bill J
before France sets out independent
ly to collect in her own way.
The meeting is looked upon as in j
many respects the most important}
since the armistice, involving as it j
does the continuance of friendly co-}
operation between France and I
Great Britain. A lesser, but none
the less important factor, is the
prevailing-impression that M. Poin
care's political existence is at st?ke
in the policy for which the pro
posed Brussels financial conference
stands.
Unless the premiers decide in
London to convene the Brussels j
meeting many observers, believe
M. Poincare will ,find his useful
ness at an end. Others think that
the ^rench premier, in the event
of a disagreement at London, will
proceed to the execution of his
plans for the occupation of the
Ruhr valley and the exploitation
of the occupied Rhineiand before
making way for someone else, but
faith in the efficiency of this
scheme of penalties appears to be j
decreasing in official Quarters, and |
many say it will never be resorted
to.
French optimism over the
makeup of the new British govern
ment has given way lately to a feel
ing pf pessimism in view of certain
definite indications that Prime
Minister Bonar Law holds to sub
stantially the same views of rep
arations as did Lloyd George.
Although the British have dis
closed no stated policy since the
resignation of Lloyd George, Pre
-m*er Bonar Law seems to agree
with his predecessor that Germany
should be given ? long moratorium
from cash payments, that the to
tal of the indemnity should* be re
duced and that no military meas
ures should he used in attempts
to force Germany to pay.
M. Poincare's much discussed
plan of settlement, although with
held on the eve of the London meet
ing because of the sensational Bal
f our note, is expected to be placed
before the present meeting, but it
appears that he will reveal it only
in its broad outlines, reserving the
detailed plan for the Brussels con
ference.
However, it is learned that the
following definite propositions,
while not constituting the plan, will
?r?babiy guide the French in their
arguments in London:
1. No. moratorium to Germany
without the surrender of productive
guarantees such as mines and for
ests.
2. Reduction of from 40,000,
000,000 to 50.000,000,000 gold marks
in the German indemnity only on
condition that there, be a parallel
reduction in the French and other
allied debts.
3. Revision of the percentages
of the German payments in favor
of France. France, at present is
entitled to 52 per cent, but would
claim Great Britain's 22 per cent,
in return for fixing the indemnity
at the suggested amount.
4. When the voluntary de
fault of Germany is definitely es
tablished or when Germany refuses
to carry out the financial reforms
of balancing her budget and sta
bilizing the mark, penalties would
?he imposed. These would include
extension of the allied occupation
of the Ruhr so as to permit a cus
toms cordon around that territory,
and the economic exploitation and
general administration ? of the
Rhineiand.
On the other hand, the British,
backed by Italy and Belgium, hold
that it is useless to convene the
Brussels meeting unless there is a
clear preliminary understanding on
certain points which M. Poincare
would leave for consideration at
Brussels. These are the fixing of a
reasonable sum of indemnity and
the methods of its payment: re
distribution of the payments among
the. allies, cancellation of the al
lied debts so far as possible with
out affecting America, methods by
which Germany's finances can be
restored under allied control, and
the raising of a loan for Germany.
The Belgians have frankly said
that they will not issue invitations
for the Brussels conference unless
there are bright hopes of its suc
cess.
It was evident tonight that an
allied agreement is impossible if M.
Poincare insists upon military
measures to coerce Germany, but
there are indications that Bonar
Law will agree to seizure of the
German mines and forests if France
abandons her socalled Ruhr plan.
When the allied debt comes up it
is certain the position of the Unit
ed States will be thoroughly dis
cussed. Therefore there is much
speculation regarding the presence
in London of the American am
bassadors to Germany and Bel
gium, a few days before the pre
ibKshed April, 1850.

CONGRESS
Intends to Invite Governors to
Conference
Washington. Dec. 8.?President!
Harding in addressing congress to-}
day announced his intention to in- [
vite governors to a conference1
with the view of adopting definite
policies for co-operation in enforc
ing the prohibition law, which he
declared was unlikely to ever be
repealed. He asserted if statutory
enforcement was contrary to pub
lic opinion a rigorous enforcement
would concentrate public attention
oh the needed enforcement. He
proposed the abolishment of the
railroad labor board, creating aj
labor division for the commerce j
commission and caid some step was
necessary to provide a tribunal,
that could enforce decisions and I
safeguard: the public... He urged
co-ordination of all transportation
facilities, railroad; water and mo- j
tor trucks; more extended credits >.
to farmers and* registration of
aiieps and a strict examination of,
emigrants, and . constitutional
amendments giving congress au
thority over child labor and re-1
stricting the issue of tax exempt
securities. He said American for

threatening cloud.
STRAIGHT TALK
ON BOOTLEGGING
Commissioner Haynes Holds
Conference With Prohibi
tion Agents in Colombia
Columbia. Dec. 8.?Plain talk is
said to have been handed out by
Prohibition Commissioner Roy A.
Haynes at his conference here to
day with state prohibition agents.
Reporters were barred from the
conference, but it is understood a
report of a recent secret investi
gation of conditions in the state
was made. It is also stated that
at least one change in the per
sonnel wa3 suggested, as a means
to more efficiency in enforcement
methods.
Attending the conference with
the commissioner was his assistant,
Sherman A. Cuned, Judge Jamev
J. Britt, of Asheville: Col. L. G.
Nutt, of Washington, chief Of pro
hibition agents. State Director
Bowen of Greenville, and R. Q.
Merrick. divisional enforcement
chief of Savannah.
A reader writes in to ask if su
idr gloves come from Sweden. No.
miers" meeting. The question is
asked, will America play some
important part behind the scenes
or openly during the conference.
So far as can be ascertained in
Paris the American ambassadors
are not in London at the sugges
tion of the state department, but
it is believed they would not meet
just prior to the allied conference
without the consent of the Amer
ican government.
Ambassador Harvey's recent ref
erence to the premier's meeting as
the most important since the ar
mistice also is regarded as signifi
cant in official circles.
The participation of Premier
Mussolini of Italy adds a note of
uncertainty in the opinion of offi
cials since he has announced he
will demand a greater share <>f the
German indemnity for Italy.
The respite given Germany on
August 31 last expires January 15,
when she is scheduled to pay 500.
000.000 geld marks, (me thing ap
pears certain, namely, that if no
agreement is readied in London.
France will never consent to fur
ther relief for Germany without
the definite guarantees already
suggested.
There is the slight hone that
Chancellor Hugo Stinnes may pro
duce some satisfactory plan at the
last moment to prevent the occu
j pation of the Ruhr but no indica
! tion of such a plan has yet been
I seen.
"Be Just and Fear
T?RKSPLAN
TO EXPEL ALL
THE GREEKS
Proposal Meets With
Strong! Opposition
from American Rep
resentatives at the
Lausanne Peace
Conference
Lausanne, Dec. 7 (By the Asso
ciated Press).?True to its tradi
tional humanitarian policy, the
United States government took a
strong position at the Near East
em peace conference today in pro
testing against expulsion of the
Greek population from Constanti
nople. Apprehensions that the
Turks would insist on deporting all
the Greeks from their sacred city.
proved to be we.l founded when j
at a meeting this afternoon of the I
subcom mission on the exchange of
populations a Turkish representa
tive arose and announced defi
nitely that departure of all the
Greeks was one of the features of
their program concerning the ad
justment of populations.
The American representative
then took the floor and read the
following statement:
"The American delegation is not
in accord with the proposals for
new compulsory movements of pop
ulations unless it is clearly shown
that good purposes will be served,
as might be the case in the ex
change of prisoners or of popula
tions where exchange is necessary
to serve humanitarian ends.
"Without discrimination between
the parties to the negotiations for
exchange, the American delegation |
is unable to approve the movement
from Constantinople of the Greek
population of that city, particularly
under conditions which will send
an urban people, used to partisan
ship and commerce, to a rural dis
trict.
"We will not hesitate to express,
in pursuance of our legitimate hu
manitarian interests, our protest at
any such* dislodgment of human
beings."
Subsequently the representa
tives of France. England and Italy
joined in the discussion and strong
ly advised the Turkish delegates
to change their minds about send
ing the Greeks away from Con
stantinople; they urged the Turks
to reflect and not act harshly on
this important question. They
pointed out that Turkish insistence
on such deportation would en
danger the entire negotiations rel
ative to the exchange of popula
tions and prisoners of war.
The former Greek premier.
Venizelos. declared he would not
sign any agreement whereby his
fellow citizens would be obliged to
leave the city where thej^ had re
sided for centuries and had done
so much for the prosperity of all.
He made it clear that the Greeks
would accept the exchange plans
only on condition that the Greek
residents were permitted to remain
in Constantinople.
The Greek delegation issued a
statement that the holy see's ap
peal in behalf of the Christians in
Constantinople was not based on
Grecian information but on ob
servations by Vatican representa
tives that the Greeks were being
mistreated.
"Turkey should listen to this high
cpiritual authority," says the state
ment, "and take measuies to re
assure the Christian populations of
Turkey."

Columbia, Dec. 8. ? Roy A.
Haynes. national prohibition com
missioner, arrived here this morn

into conference with the. prohibi

expected that sensations would de
velop at the conference, as it was
learned before the meeting that re
port of an investigation which has
been under way secretly for six
weeks would be made to Mr.
Haynes at this time and that the
report was severe on the agents in
this state, charging them with in
efficiency in enforcing the prohibi

MURES LAW
I INTRODUCED
Congressman Steven
son Introduces Bill
to Enable Buyers to
Get What They Buy
Washington, Dec. .7.?A bill to
amend the cotton futures act to
enable buyers of contracts to de
mand delivery of grades of cotton
they desire for use in manufacture
was introduced today by Represen
tative Stevenson (Democrat) of
South Carolina.
The bill would divide contracts
Jnto three classes, "A," "B," and
"C." Class A would include mid
dling fair, strict good middling,
good middling and strict mid
dling. Class B would include strict
middling, middling, strict low mid
dling and good middling yellow
tinged. Class C would call for
strict low middling, low middling,
strict middling yellow tinged and
good middling yellow tinged.
I ' Under the bill a trader would
stipulate the class of his contract
and the grade of cotton wanted.
Delivery of one-third of the con
tract would be required in that
grade and the remainder permitted
in the two grades next in order.
Mr. Stevenson said passage of
the bill would tend to equalize the
price level as between the futures
market and the actual value of the
cotton, which he said had worked
to the disadvantage of the actual
product. It also would 6ave the
spinners and others the necessity
of an extra transaction, he added,
when delivery to-them on contracts
included cotton they could not use.

ister Approves in
Part Turkish Pro
posals for Regula
tion of Dardanelles
Lausanne, Dec. 8 (By the Asso
ciated Press).?Georges Chicherin,
the Bolshevik foreign minister,
abandoned his previously extreme
ly hostile attitude regarding the
Dardanelles question at this after
noon's peaceful cession of the Near
Eastern conference and express
ed approval of the Turkish pro
posals for regulation of the straits
.with the reservation that he must
see the actual words of the sec
tions covering the various points at
issue before he could give full ap
pro^! to them.
Japan today spoke for the first
time on the straits problem. Baron
-i;ayasfii. the Japanese representa
tive, said that Japan, as a power
having great .shipping interest in
ihe Mediterranean, hoped for
trade in the Black Sea and.was
vitally interested in the regulation
of Near Eastern waters. He was
entirely in accord with" the words
of Richard VVashburn Child, the
American ambassador, concerning
the. straits and liberty of com
mr rce in the Black sea and raid he
had listened with great delight to
the statements of Ismet Pasha on
behalf of Turkey, who had ap
proached the difficult problems in
a sympathetic and conciliatory
manner. Baron Hayashi added
that the address of Lord Curzon,
the British foreign minister, had
"assured Idm that a solution of the
strait3 question was hearing.
Review by Curzon.
Lord Curzon opened the session
with a long detailed review of the
points on which the Turks differ
ed from the entente plan and re
plied to questions on which Ismet
Pasha had asked further informa
tion "* at ^the^.morning session. His
address indicated that most of the
questions on which the entente and
the Turks, differed were proper sub
jects for discussion in an infor
mal way by military and naval ex
perts, and expressed the opinion
that such discussion would bring
forward the necessary technical in
formation which would undoubt
edly form the basis for agreement.
The only harsh note of the ses
sion came when M. Chicherin and
M. Rakovsky. also of tlie Russian
delegation, demanded 'that Russia
be admitted to all informal dis
cussions which may take place be
tween the military and naval ex
perts of the Turks and the entente
on the straits question.
Lord Curzon held this would be
impossible as these discussions
would be informal and wholly un*
official. He said Russia had no right
to demand xepresentation when the
other powers interested in the
straits were making no such re
quest. In case the problem of the
straits was discussed in full con
ference or by a subcommittee.
Lord Curzon explained that the
Russian experts would be welcom
ed.
Acceptance by Turks.
In opening the session. Lord Cur
zon said he was glad the Turks had
accepted the principle of demili
tarized zones on the straits, provid
ed they were assured adequate pro
tection; that the Turks had ac
cepted the principle of free passage
of warships and merchantmen in
times of peace or war, and also in
principle an international commis
son to regulate commercial navi
gation. He added that the Turks
had laid down the basis of the
regime they desired to see applied
to the straits and that it seemed
possible to harmonize this with the
entente views.
The Turks withdrew their sug
gestion that the powers should not
be allowed to maintain warships in
the Black sea. so that the question
was not discussed at the afternoon
meeting.
Taking up in order the sugges
tions Ismet Pasha made at the
morning session on which Turkey
desired further explanation. Lord
Curzon said that on the question of
[ guarantee that Constantinople
I would be free from attack the al
lies felt the allied proposals were
adequate so far as military and
naval guarantees were concerned.
He indicated, however, that, as in
the case of Thrace, further inter
national guarantees of a political
character were worthy of consid
eration.
This question had been a matter
of study on the part of the allied
jurists in order to reconcile their
views.
On Ismet Pasha's suggestion that
there should be a limitation of
naval forces entering the Black
sea. Lord Curzon declared he
thought, the principle laid down by
the allies was sound, but that the
allies were willing to interpret it
in a liberal way and felt sure a
satisfactory formula could be
worked out after conversations.
Commentng on Ismet Pasha's
point that there should be liberty
of passage through the straits in
peace and in war for commercial
ships, with Turkey having the

BILL NEAR I
COMPLETION
[Amendment Eliminat-'
ed and Compromise1
Inserted in Its Place.1
Before Senate Soon
Washington, Dec. 8.?Considera
tion of the administration shipping
bill was virtually completed today
by the senate commerce commit
tee with the elimination of the jiad
den amendment attached by the
house and substitution of the Willis
Lenroot compromise and with the
approval of more than half a dozen
other important changes.
The measure will be approved
finally by the committee and pre
sented by Chairman Jones to thr
senate tomorrow and on Monday
che long and. hard senate fight will
begin.
The rejection of the Madden
amendment and the approval of
the compromise substitute ended, a
deadlock which had existed in the
committee since it began consid
eration of the measure. Wednes
day. The committee acted after
Chairman Lasker of the- shipping
board had appeared before it arid
had accepted the compromise on
^eing told that unless either the
Madden amendment or the com
promise were retained the bill
could not be reported. Mr. Lasker
previous to his appearance before
the committee had declared fhe
proposed substitute unsatisfactory.
The compromise, which was.sug
gested by Senator Willias (Repub
lican) of Ohio and drafted by Sen
itor Lcnroot (Republican) of Wis
consin, provides that the approval
of congress shall be required for
an increase in the amoanfof* govr
ernment aid to ship operating com
panies over the amount fixed in
the initial contract. The TVfadden
amendment. which President
Harding a few days ago informed
the senate committee would Jeop
ardize the whole government aid
program, provided for government
aid through annual appropriations
by congress. , -
The other changes made l>y the
senate committee in the - bill in
clude: ?' -
Insertion of a provision limiting
the total annual aid to. he given by
the government to ship operatin'g
companies to $30,000,000 dollars.
Elimination of sections^ giving
-essel owners income tax exemp
tions on profits invested in the
*>uilding of new ships and on re
ceipts from the sale of vessels,
?rovided these receipts are used
to build new ships.
Addition of a provision that no
contract between the government
and a ship owner for the extension
of government aid shall extend
more than 15 years.
Insertion of a provision that no
application for a contract for gov
ernment aid shall be refused until
after public hearing.
Addition of a provision that
loans from the construction ftmd
shall net be extended to- corpora
tions for the building of vessels to
?arrv the products of the corpora
tions.
Reduction from 75 to 50 per cent,
in the amount of tonnage which a
vessel* owner must have under the
\merican flag in order to receive
government aid.
The income tax exemption sec
tions were eliminated after the
shipping board had informed the
committee that no special benefit
in the production of pew tonnage
would be derived from such exemp
tions. The proviso inserted with
respect to the construction fund, it
was explained, would prohibit gov
ernment loans for the building of
ships to such concerns as the Stand
ard Oil company and the United
Fruit company, which use their
ships largely to carry their own
products.
The administration shipping bill
was reported favorably to the sen
ate today by the commerce com
mittee.

right of search in case she was at
war. l ord Curzon said the allies
were agreed. While the British
foreign minister said the allies be
lieved the Sea of Marmora ooulcl
not de definitely excluded from the
demilitarized zone, as Ismet Pasha
desired, because the sea is a
geographical continuation of the
straits, it was quite possible with
out interfering with the right of
free passage for the defense of the
Sea of Marmore within certain
j limits and this question doubtless
I could be worked out by the experts.
J Replying to Ismet Pasha's con
tention that the demilitarized zone
was too large. Lord Curzon said it
might be possible to make changes
in it in the vicinity of Constanti
nople. The allies, he added, would
grant the request of the Turks that
Turkish troops be permitted to
cross from one side of the demilitar
ized zone to another if they were in
transit. As to ismet Pasha's sug
gestion that Turkey must have ar
senals in the demilitarized zone
Lord Curzon declared this ques
tion would not be difficult to settle
but that it could naturally better
be considered when the military
and naval clauses of the treaty

ceau, closing his visit to Washi
ton this afternoon with a "torn
address, expressed the hope
diplomacy would find the way
bring America back into Eure
affairs through what he ifitei
ed as an "overture" by^JPresit
Harding in the annual message
executive had read xto congrecs'
few hours earlier.
"I was greatly comforted','
the war time premier of France^
i'"when I read in the message' or
your president the following lines!
They are not very long, but; they**
arc very suggestive:
" The four power pact, which ?
abolishes every probability of war
on the Pacific, has brought a new
confidence in maintained; peacei
and I can well believe it" might'..
be made a model for like assur-,
ances wherever in the world anyv\"
common interests are concerned,"*:';
"So you 'see,*' continued thW
Tiger, ~rhr.t even these . who . are.
supposed io. disagree, really agr.ee
at the very bottom of ..their-f ce&?g v
and reasoning power-That isjyhat;^
I ask. and I hope ihis i? some^
thing like an overture,, tnat some
light will be coming, and I wilt
be very glad if it comes from
America and I hope that dipfe^
macy will have something to say
about it, and talks may be engag
ed'in, which, I am sure, cap.
bring nothing but good for us all."
When Clemenceau's reference to
the president's message was called
to the attention of the. White :
House, it was said that there
no comment, to be made .and...that,
there was no intention of elab--:
orating on the president's state-'
ment to congress.
.Clemenceau's address, delive?^;'
before an audience, which includ
ed many diplomats, goverrunenit
officials and- members t)f both
houses' of . congress, was, its--'-es
sence the "peace message" he*
j-first delivered . inChicago. Butr
apparently "sensing that bffie?al
: Washington would Judge of him
and" hi? mission by this speech. 8&>'
' spoke -deliberately and chose hi*
words\jtf{h''?reat ..precision.
The former premier ans.v?t-k*j
the aiguhlent that the A*tui^H
taxpayer Can not pay France's bill
with ? the ?'? asserti on that Francr
could not nay those of Germany,
I and argued that Ameri -a should
help to make Germany payr;,\
M. Clemenceau asked why- the
United States, went to war; wheth-/
er it was to help France or to make
democracy safe. If it was for the
latter reason, he asked that the.
United States look, afar and
the barbarism of the Turks
j the anarchy of Russia.
? The "Tiger" boarded his special:
train shortly after 9 o'clock to gor
to Philadelphia, where he is sched
