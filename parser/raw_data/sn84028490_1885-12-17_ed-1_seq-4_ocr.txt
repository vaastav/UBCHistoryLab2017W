A GOOD WORK WELL DONE.
The City Couucll at Its Monday night's
session performed a good act, and dl.1 a
wise piece of legislation, In passing the
ordlnanoe repealing ths ordinances
levying a special assessment tax on
property located on Walnutstreetand in
Central Sewer District No, 8, to pay for
the construction of the Walnut street
storm water sewor, and providing In
stead for the payment of its construc
tion out of the general sewer fund, as
all other Improvements of a like charaO'
ter have been paid for. The vote on the
passage of the ordinance was a unani
mous one, and showed the Counoll to be
In harmony with publlo opinion In gen
eral on thin Important question.
The olty In the first place by Its own
acts, as Mr. Roberts clearly showed tn
bis sound .argument on bohalt of the
repeallog orJInanoe, was directly re
sponsible for tbe deplorable condition of
affairs .whloh so.loog existed on Wal
nut street now happily obliterated by
the completion of the sewer, or drain, as
some prefer to call it and it was clear
ly tbe duty of the olty to furnish the
remedy necessary for the relief
of people living and owning prop
erty along Ithe line of the street.
The onoe unsightly and un
healthy condition of Waluut street
was not. brought about through the
natural rainfall on the street, but was
the effect of draining a large section of
the olty's territory luto that thorough'
fare, by means of sewers oonttrooted by
the olty, and paid for out of tbe general
sewer fund.
A large number of storm water sewers
have been constructed all ovor the
city, which have all been patd for out of
the general sewer f uud, with no thought
of any epeolal assessment, and It wea
clearly a piece of rank Inj istlco to
slnglo out Walnut streot, whose beauty
and usefulness had been all but destroy
ed by the olty's acts, on which to levy
a special assessment for an Improve
ment which It wus the rightful duty of
the city to make.
But all's well that ends well; and
although Mr. Adlor may think the Wal
nut street storm water sewer a frau I, as
he has several times lgnorantly and
dogmatically endeavored to make .him
self believe It Is by rash assertions In
Counoll, we beg to assure blm that It Is
not, bot as now comploted, Is an excel
lent piece of work, and is performing its
duty In an almlrable manuer, to tbe
entire satisfaction .of all concerned.

KxDresstog the opinions of an Intel

gan and Sherman that if we lived In
outh Carolina or Mississippi, where
Ignorance wan In the voting majority,
we would not lot It vote unless it voted
our way. If during he coming session
of Con green the Chinese of California
could be lawfully olothed with the prlvl

their owu executive olUcers to enforce
them, we would see them driven by
bayonets into the sea, annihilated anil
damnod, before we would submit to the
legal imposition wuion would imperil
that whloh Is dearer to us than the law."
NoSmthornerever put the question

Propositions to amend tbe House rules
were submitted Wednesday by Messrs.
Morrison and Springer. Among other
things It Is proposod to divldo the ap
propriate committees. The Committee
on Ruins was announced, to whloh these
vnrlou changes wero referred. It con
sists of the Speaker, Randall, Morrison,
Rood and Ulsoook. The Speaker will
probably bold the balance In this coin
inltte, as Morrison and Reed favor a
ohunge, while Randall and Ulsoook op
pose It. There will be a lively debate
on the subject In the House, but the
ohanoos are the proposod amendments
will carry if reported favorably from
the committee.
Mb, Tiliikn In his letter to Speaker
Carlisle proposing to draw on the sur-
f lus In the Treasury to put the nation
n an attitude of dofonne, has been sin
gularly fortunate In securing the gen
eral approbation of the couutiy. His
Ideas are generally right In themselves,
and manifestly well-timed. Mr. Ttlden's
plan would put In olroulatlon millions
of money whloh would othrwlse be Idle,
employ labor, whloh would not be em
p'oyed, and create a demand for osrtalu
manufactured articles whereby employ
ment would be given to the mills aud
shops of the country.

A Variety of Opinion on the Civil Service
Reform Law—Flunkeyism Banished
from President Cleveland's
Administration.
Special to the DAILY DEMOCRAT.
Washinoton, D. C.Ueo. 16 . h. The at
tacks on the civil service law may be
looked for from many sources. Opinions
differ very muoh lu regard to Just what
should b'idoiio, Judge Benny has his
followers, who will Insist upon an ab
solute repeal. There are others who
think that the Commissioners should
simply be limited In the rules that they
may enact.
In conversation with Judge Holman,
of Indiana, to day, lie told your corre
spondent that he had already examined
several bills and that they were aa vari
ous as the men who wrote them.
"Wiiat tiu you favor?' 1 asked.
"Oil. I think the rules should be bo
amended that when a State I entitled
',o an appointment all the persons from
that State who bave passed the required
examination should oe entitled to have
their names sent to the appointing nlll
cer, and he should then be uutrammeled
In making his seloctlon,"
Mr. Randolph Tucker, of Virginia,
said that the law was passed an an ex
periment to a large exteut aud It would
be very strange if tt did not need modi
fication. Mr. R indall would not say anything
upon the subject for publication. He Is
feeling quite badly over the modification
of the rules whloh cripples the Appro
priation Committee.
GAUVIKLD, BIBCOCK AND RANDALL
Were the members who practically
made the present rules of the House, and
Mr, Randall feels called upjn to die
fighting for them.
The bill of Representative Caleton, of
Michigan, by whloh he proposes te regu
late navigation on the taken and among
other things compel captains to leave a
correct list of passengers at porta Is
meeting with approval with members.
It Is very likely to pass.
SENATOR DANIEL.
John W. Daniel, the newly elected
Senator from Virginia, Is just entering
upon his first term lu Congress. He Is a
characteristic Virginian tall, angular,
smooth-faced and old fashioned, lie Is
the pr'de and the hero of the Old Do
minion, where old fasblonod stump ora
tory seems to still have an muoh sway
and foroe an In the days of Patrick
Henry and John Randolph. It
wan generally conceded that the
ethe nf Senator thin time should goto
Representative Barbour, who has done
so much to win the light. Besides, Har
bour is over 70 years old, and If he Is
ever to be honored he should bo honored
now. A committee waited upon Mr,
Daniel aud presented thin phase of the
rae to him Iu answer, be 'aid:
"I do not ask advice of my friends, I
demand their support," and they sup
ported him. It will be remembered that
tionator-Dloot Daniel delivered the ora
tlou at the dedication ot the Washington-,
monumeut last spring.
A SENSIBLE ADMINISTRATION.
There has not been an administration
for many yearn so quiet In a soi-UI way
as this bids fair to be. Miss Cleveland
Is almost a literary recluse and cares
nothing for society. Her brother, the
President, Is constantly employed with
his busluess, aud looks upon all the
formalities ot the swell gatherings here
with the utmost disgust. The faot of
the Marshal being relieved of the duties
ot chief flunkey m ana that there will
be very little lluukey business done.

THE SUPREME COURT DECISION.
The eleot Ion oases which were Satur
day deoldod by the Supreme Court of tbe
State, In favor of the D 'inocratlo Sena
tors from Hamilton county, reversing
tbe doolslon of the Republican Circuit
Court of that county, were In substanoa
three In number one brought by the
Democrats to obtain Soertlfliates for the
Domooratlo Senators, another by the
R publicans to obtain certificates for
the Republican Senators, and a third
case brought by tbe Attorney General,
at the rrq'iest ot the Governor and the
Secretary of State, to compol Mr. D illon,
the olerk at Cincinnati, to certify the
Ham' I ton county returns as to the State
officers to Colnmbus for Immediate
counting. The Supreme Conrt decided
to hear and decide these cases together,
because they grew ont of the snmo facts
and were predicated upon the same
points of evidence aud law, The dools
lon of the Court settles all three of these,
and will make the Senate Democratic
by three mi Jor It y, and leave the Repub
licans but a bare majority of three on
joint ballot. It is a bitter pill for the
fraud Booking Republicans, but tbey
will have to swallow It, as there Is no
going beyond tbe Bupreme Court. It Is
the last oourf of appeal. The deolBlon
Is also a damper on John Sherman's
hope for a return to the C. 8. Senate, as
It is said there are sevoral Republican
membors of tho Legislature who will
not vote for blm under any clroum
oen. Unlucky Renubllcansl Uubapny

WHO WROTE THE MESSAGE?
This Is a queer world, and Washington
Is ns queer as any part ot It. The un
locked for literary excellence of the
message has Bet unfriendly gossip to
speculating as to Its authorship. Kvery.
body but tbe president in suggested.
Lamar wrote the passage about the In
dians, Miss Cleveland got in her work
about the Mormons, and the fine Italian
hand of Lamout is clearly dlsoernable
throughout. So the quidnuncs wag their
tongues and look exceedingly wise. I
onoe asked Mr. Tlldon what sort of
writor Mr. Cleveland Is. "blr, said the
old en go, sententlounly, "be In a man
who would rather write a bad dooument
for himself than get a good one of some
body else." My notion In that the Presi
dent oan well afford to be the author of
such ' bad documents" as his first mesa
age without seeking other help for a
better. Henry Watterson In Cornier-Journal.
