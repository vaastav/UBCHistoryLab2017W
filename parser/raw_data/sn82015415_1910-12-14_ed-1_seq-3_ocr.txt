TAFT URGES EXTENSION OF
EIGHT-HOUR LABOR LAW
(From President Taft's Message.) ,
In 1892 the present eight-hour law
was passed, which .provides that the
services and employment of all lablr
era and mechanics who are now or
may hereafter be employed by the
government of the United States, by
the District of Columbia, or by any
contractor or sub-contractor on any
of tho public works of the United
States and of tho said District of Co
lumbia, Is hereby restricted to eight
hours In any one calendar day, and it
shall be unlawful, etc., etc.
This law has been construed to limit
the applications of the requirement to
those who are directly employed by
tho government or to thoso who are
employed upon public works situate
upon land owned by the United
States. This construction prevented
its application to government battle
ships and other vessels built in pri
vate 'shipyards and to heavy guns and
armor plate contracted for and made
at private establishments.
The proposed act provides that no
laborer or mechanic doing any part
of the work contemplated by a con
tract with tho United States in the
employ of the cintractor or any sub
contractor shall be required or per
mitted to work mqre than eight hours
a day In any one calendar day.
It seems to me from the past his
tory that tho government has been
committed to a policy of encouraging
the limitation o ftho day's work to 3
hours in all works of construction Ini
tiated by Itself, and it seems to me
illogical to maintain a difference be
tween government work done on gov
ernment soli and government work
done In a private establishment, when
the work is of such large dimension
and involves the expenditure of much
labor for a considerable period, so that
the private manufacturer may adjust
himself and his establishment to the
special terms of employment that ho
must make with his workmen for this
particular job. To require, however,
that every small contract of manu-
ifacture entered Into by the government
should be carried out by the contrae
tor with men working at eight hours
would be to impose an intolerable
burden upon the government by limit,
ing its sources of supply and excluding
altogether the great majority of those
who would otherwise compete for its
business.
The proposed act recognizes this
in the exceptions which it makes to
contracts.
"For transportation by water or
land, for tho transmission of intelli
gence and for such materials or ar
ticles as may usually be bought In the
open market whether made to con
form to particular specifications or
not, or forthe purchase of supply by
the government, whether manufactur.
ed to conform to particular specifica
tions or not."
I recommend that instead of enact
ing the proposed 'bill, tho meaning of
which is not clear and definite and
might be given a construction embar
rassing to the public interest, the pro
sent act be enlarged by providing that
public work shall be construed to In
clude not only building and work, up
on public ground, but also ships, ar
mor and large guns, when manufac
tured In private yards or factories.
One of the great difficulties in en
forcing this eight-hour law is that Its
application under certain emergencies
becomes extremely oppressive and
there is a great temptation to subor
dinate officials to evade it. I think
that it would be wiser to allow the
President, by executive order, to de
clare an emergency in special In
stances In which tho limitation might
not apply, and, in such cases, to per
mit tho payment by tho government cf
extra compensation for the time work
ed each day In excess of elgh hours.
I may add that my suggestions In
respect to this legislation have the
full concurrence of the commissioner
of Labor.
NEW YORK, December 14. After
dominating tho American Sugar Re
fining Company, better Known as tho
Sugar Trust, for years, the Havomey
er frtmlly stepped down from control
tdday with the resignation of Horace
Havemeyer, the son of the late H. O.
Havemeyer, as practical head of tho
great company.
At the same time Arthur Dorner,
treasurer of the company, also handed
In his resignation, ana new men un
affiliated with tho Havemeyer Inter
ests will assume the practical man
agement of the corporation's affairs.
While it is not officially admitted
that the recent prosecutions by the
government and the petition now be
fore the federal corut for a dissolu
tion of the alleged trust, have any
thing to do with the resignation of
Mr. Havemeyer and Mr. Dorner, It
Is the belief in financial circles here
that this Is the main reason for the
severance of the connections by tho
Havemeyer family with the company.
Until a meeting of the board of di
rectors is held it is improbable that
any official announcement will no
made regarding tho successors to
Havemeyer and Dorner.
JURY OF WOMEN MAY
DISCUSS TOO LONG
OLYMPIA, December 14. The first

case at bar is not an Important one,
but lawyers and court attendants aro
wondering how long It will take them
to reach a verdict. The entire city
is much Interested In the result.
REGULARS WIN AFTER
DESPERATE FIGHTING
EL PASO, December 14. Word was
recelvqd here last evening that n
clash between the regular Mexican
troops and the insurgents in the State
of Chihuahua, near Cerro Prieto, took
placo yesterday, resulting in a victory
for the regulars. '
The fighting was desperate for
hours, and even after the rebels had
been driven back to the foothills they
fought from every vantage point. For
a time they held the regulars in check
and finally retired, carrying with them
their wounded, but leaving seventy
dead on the field of battle.

JOIN THE NAVY

"Fighting Bob" Evans' advice to young '
men is to enter the navy. The fa
mous sea fighter has just returned
from Now York to his home here. I
"I would advise any young man who
was trying to decide cn a career to !
enter the navy,'' said Admiral Evaus
tnrlnv "Itn .til i 11, ... I
ivuuj . uc (.ill it;i;i IcglCL Hit
perience it gives him. The navy turns
out young men, who entered the train
ing school inexperienced and of little
value to themselves, or to any one
else, skilled mechanics, steamfitters,
blacksmiths, carpenters, wireless ope
rators, telegraph operators. When
they graduate they have had an expert
training for Industrial life and are fit
ted to take positions in large indus
tries. Should Serve Government.
"But," continued Admiral Evans, "a
man who received his education fron
Uncle Sam should bo willing to servo
his country after he has received bis
education. He should remain in the
navy, unless there Is some very press
ing reason for htm to leave."
Admiral Evans related an incident
in his- own life, showing that he might
have become an activo member of the
steel trust had he desired He paid
that an offer was made td Mm while
he was steel expert in 1888 for the
navyTJy, one of the steel magnates to
enter the steel business.
Doesn't Regret Millions.
"I turned tho offer over In my mind
that day," said Admiral Evan3. "The '
government had given mo my educa-'
tion with the idea that I should work j
for the government, and I felt It was
my duty to remain in the navy. So I
refused the offer. I havo never been
sorry, even when I have heird of other .
men who entered the business much
later and havo become wealthy. I .
place a greater value on the friends I
havo made around the world during
my service In the navy than I do on
the millions made in steel."
Admiral EvanB declared ho was
glad to be back In Washington and
that life in New York city was far
more dangerous than life on.a battle
ship. "In New York," ho said, "it is
as. much as a man's- life Is worth to
cross one of the busy streots "
