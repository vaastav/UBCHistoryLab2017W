The number of failures In Kovcmbernt
New York wore about tho same as in Octo
Ixr, but the amount of liabilities about two
million dollars, aro fortunately only one
half a much.
Tho War Department has Issued orders
for the departure of a number of troops in
fantry, cavalry and artillery to tho Rio
Grande, tt Is stated that these troops are
sent to the border solely for the protection of
tho settlers on the frontier, and not because
of any new complications with Mexico.
The estimates of tho Secretary of the
Treasury for the expenses of tho Government
for tho fiscal year ending June 30th, 1ST!),
aggregate $280,888,796. The estimates for
tho current fiscal year were $299,011,071,but
the amount appropriated by Congress was
$220,968,070, or $72,043,601 less than the
estimates.
At TitUburg, on Saturday of Inst week,
the following July rioters were sentenced :
Daniel Moran and Alexander McAllister,
for malicious mischief, each pay a fine of
$500 and be imprisoned six months in the
work house j J. M. Green, for diverting a
twitch, $1500 fine and 6 months in the
Penitentiary. Thomas McCall, for striking
Assistant Superintendent Watt, when the
latter attempted to movo tho switch, 1500
fine and imprisonment for one year. James
Ciarter, for making incendiary threats, $2000
fine and 22 months in tho penitentiary.
Matthew Marshall, forfiringcoke cars,$5000
fine and 6 years and 10 months in the peni
tentiary. The latest exposure of savings bank
frauds is that of tho New Kochelle, and tho
modtu operandi, as described by tho Tribune,
cannot he more simple and direct in effect
ing tho end aimed at. Tho secretary, it
eeeras, had been systematically stealing the
funds. His process consisted chiefly in put
ting into his own pockets the cash that was
deposited, tho only record of the deposits be
iuginthepassbooks. This method of fraud,
though not new in banking experience, is,
nevertheless, ono of tho things that good
management always guards against. Such
doings cannot bo carried on for a length of
time unless the trustees aro neglectful of
their duties, since a comparison between tho
pass books and tho ledger would at any time
reveal it.
Eight thousand people have signed a
petition to Congress, prcsonted by tho Hon.
Hendrick B. Wright, of this Stale, asking for
tho enactment of a law under which tho
Government should lend $500 to each indi
vidual settler on tho public lends, taking a
mortgage therefor on tho land, also given to
the settler. The Kansas Farmer expresses
i-urprise at the discovery that there aro so
many "wild and visionary pcoplo" as to
furnish eight thousand signatures to the pe
tition. But thero is no reason for surprise.
It Is better to sign a petition asking for a law,
however impracticable and foolish, which is
designed to help working men to obtain
farms, than to enact a law which will prac
tically rob working men of at least ten cents
on the dollar; and there are a good many
advocates of the latter kind of legislation.
When a man boasts that ho " never
bolted a ticket in his life," that ho never
voted for a man belonging to the opposite
party for an office, and declares that ho
never will, other peoplo are warranted in
holding him to bo a demagogue, or a knave,
or a fool. But, says an exchange, Senator
Patterson, who made this kind of a declara
tion before tho Senate, a day or two ago, has
had the misfortune to be proved a knave
for other and more weighty reasons. While
he is a very prominent figure In the Senato
determining the rights of other men to a
scat there, a committee of tho Legislature of
his own State is pioclaiming him a knave,
fleeted to his high office by tho grossest kind
of jiersonal bribery and corruption. Thero
does not seem to be any question of tho
truth of the charges made against him, for
they are reasonable, and supported by a
great mass of testimony, largely gathered
Irom his followers and adherents. If the
Benate could,for a few days, rise above party
spirit, or sink belqw it like Patterson, there
might still bo somo uncertainty about But
ler's admission, but none about Patterson's
expulsion.

Tlio President's Mcssnrrp.
On Monday last President Itnycs sent his
first annual Message to Congress, of which
tho following is a brief synopsis : the Message-
opens with a full discussion of the re
sults of his "discontinuance of the uso of tho
army for tho purpose Of upholding local go
vernment " in the States of Louisiana and
South Carolina. Under tho circumstances
ho deemed that course not only a constitu
tional duty and requirement, but a much
needed measure for tho restoration of local
self government and the promotion ofnation
al hnrirlony. As to the results of his action,
he says t " Thero has been a general re-cs-tablishmcnt
of order and of tho orderly
administration of justice; Instances of re
maining lawlessness hard become of raro
occurrence j political turmoil and turbulcnco
have disappeared; useful industries have
been resumed ; public credit in the Southern
States has been greatly strengthened; and
the encouraging benefits of a revival of com
merce between tho sections of the country
lately embroiled in civil war aro fully en
joyed." -Upon these results ho thinks tho
country is to bo congratulated, and to this,
we havo no doubt, a large majority of his
fellow citizen will say Amen 1 He has no
apprehensions or misgivings, his explana
tion is frank and manlv. and ho has " abid
ing faith that time will lurnisn nmple vin
dication of his course." That part of tlio
Mcssago winch uiscutses uio bouincrn ques
tion is followed by an earnest oppcajlo Con
gress, to the Legislatures, Executives and
Courts of the States for protection iinil help
in every just form to the cpfiancUised color
ed people that object "is very dear to his
heart."
Then comes tho discussion of resumption
and of the currency and finance, as related
to the proposed silver dollar coinage. Tho
President favors such policy and measures
only as will load to tho resumption of Epocio
payments, and thus place our internal trade
and foreign commcrco in harmony with tho
system of exchanges based upon tho pre
cious metals as tho intrinsic money of tho
World. The policy of resumption Euould bo
fiursued by every suitable means, and no
egislation is deemed wiso that discharges
tho importance or that would retard the at
tainment of that result. Wavering inpur
ijoso of unsteadiness of methods, bo far from
relicvine- cxistine trouble would only tend
to increased and prolonged disturbance of
values, and poosibly end in serious disorder,
dishonor and disaster to both Government
and people. Tho industrious masses, wheth
er skilled or unskilled as to tncir occupa
tions, should bo compensated in money
which is in itself fixed in its exchangeable
value. This is most certainly secured by a
currency exchangeable in gold coin. As to
tho attempt to make the 4121-grain Bilver
dollar circulato as an equivalent for a gold
dollar, the Message suggests the impracti-
1. ;!!' t -!..! . rl !!... . il.
Ullll UI Kit ing uuiiiiui'iciui miu.iuij lu wiu
two metals, in viewof tlio fluctuations in tho
price of silver, iho President holds that
such equality of commercial value, and a
limitation of tho amount for which tlio pro
posed silver dollar shall bo a legal tender,
aro essential conditions for keeping such dol
lars anu goiu uounra in circuiuuon ui me
samo time. "Without these conditions" tho
President fears "that only mischief and mis
fortune would flow from the coinage of sil
ver dollars with the quality of unlimited
legal tender. ' Any expectation oi tempor
ary relief from an issue of silver coinago to
pass as a legal tender, at a rato materially
above its commercial value, tho President
regards as "a delusion." For several rea
sons, set forth with great clearness and force,
lie believes mat any legislation looking to
the payment of either tho interest or princi
pal of the Government bonds in the proposed
silver coinage, would not only bo a breach
of faith by the Government, but a serious
loss in money, ns it must inevitably prevent
tho progress of funding the debt at lower
rates of iutcrcst. Adherence to good faith,
and tho payment of interest and principal in
gold, tiie only coin recognized at the time of
the negotiation of the bonds, will enable the
Government to effect a still further saving
of $20,000,000 a year in interest, and an ag
gregate of $300,000,000 before tho debt final
ly matures. It is suggested to Congress that,
in any legislation it adopU for tho coinage
of a silver dollar,said legislation should limit
its legal tender function, should equalize its
commercial value with that of tho gold dol
lar, and sl'ould expressly exempt tho pub
lic debt and interest from payment in anv
coin of less commercial value than that of
the present gold coinage of tho couutry.
This means that Congress need not expect
the President's approval to the Bland bill in
any form in which that notorious measure
can bo put. "Wavering of purpose" and
"unsteadiness of methods" about tho resump
tion of specie payments, which means liv
ing's bill, and the attempt to forco tho clip
ped coin falsely called "the dollar of the
fathers," nre things that aro to reeeivo no
countenance from the President of tho Unit
ed States.
Tho next subject in order and in import
ance is that relating to tho reform of the
civil service, and to its enfranchisement Irom
Congressional interference. In this, as well
as in regard to tho currency, and Southern
self-government, tho President adheres to
the ibIicv announced in his letter of accept
ance and in his inaugural address; and he
believes that he is in accord with tho peoplo
on tho subject. It is his purooso to adhere
to ihe y Ian of the Constitution in tho matter,
which invests the President with the power
of selection finu gives to tne cenaio mo pow
er to consent or reject. This ho regards ns a
wise distribution of powers, and he nuietlv
reminds Senators In na incidental way that
they can exercise theirdlities as "disinterest
ed and Impartial judges" ot the fitness of his
selections, all tho better if they have no
hand in nrcHunp their friends anil favorites
upon him beforehand. This little touch of
humor and satire is managed with rare and
delicate skill. He also reminds Congress
mat the uivil service Commission has still
a legal existence, and is at work, although
there is no appropriation to pay its expenses,
and he asks for an appropriation.
Our foreign relations are all in such ami
cable condition that no remark upon that
part of tho Message is required here, except
to say mat mo rresiucni uojies me tieet irom
Mexico, notwithstanding the border bother
ations, and that he would like to havo some
legislative he) p about the Venezuelan claims.
Then follow references to the depresfion in
iraue ; me acsiranmy oi extending tne lor
eign markets for our products ; and the na
tional finances, which are in cood condition
and will be better if there isno antt-resump-

The President is a little astray about this,
and had better "let well enough alone,"

There is no doubt much suffering from
want of employment, though tho distress in
consequenco is greatly exaggerated, as in
point : Itepresentativo Ewlng, in his recent
speech in Congress favoring tho repeal of
tho ltesumption act, mado the assertion that
the president of tho Dayton and Southeast
ern Railroad had told him that hundreds of
men had been offering to-work on tho road
for bread and meat. Col. D. E. Mead, presi
dent of tho road mentioned, authorizes the
statement that men havo never yet offered
to work for bread and meat, and that tho
company has, in fact, much trouble in cm
ploying laborers at good wages. It may
further bo said that the contractors of the
Springfield Jackson and Pomcroy Narrow
Gauge Itoad are also needing a largo num
ber of men to work on their road, and offer
good wages to all who will apply for steady
employment.
