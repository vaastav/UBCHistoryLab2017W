THE NEW CONGRESS.
A Democratic House.
! For the first time in eighteen years,
the Democrats control the lower House
of Congress. Of the two hundred and
i ninety-two members who com pose the
House, one hundred and seventy-two
Iare Democrats, fourteen Independents.
|and one hundred and six Republicans.
! Of the whole number, one hundred and
; eighty are new members, and of these
'one hundred and twenty are Democrats,
and less than sixty are from the South
iern States.
! As the President and Senate are Rc
jpublican, the work of legislation does
I not promise to be very harmonious, and
the House may antici^tUe constant
cheeks in the exercise of its powers, and
:obstacles in the work of reform. Jlold
I in>r, however, the purse strings of the
1 ,t Ml,,I M-ifl, ., |,?|CU ?f
i power lor two years, derived directly
} from the people, it is able to command
] a controlling inlluenee upon the vferions
departments of the national administra
tion, ami to do much in the way of re
form, ami in moulding the policy of the
(Jovernincnt for the next two years.
To the full extent of it* powers, it is
anticipated that the work of retrench
ment and reform will he fully carried
out. Expenses will he cut down with a
free hand, and every department of the
service will feel the touch of the prunint:
knife, in tin* lopping oil' of abuses and
corruptions. It is supposed that tlie
total expenses will be red need some

penses of 000,000 will bo largely re
dueed?the river and harbor appropria
tions cut down?the army and navy
reduced, and lavish expenditures check
ed iu all quarters. In fact, economy
and reform will be th/-order yf the day,
and will be used as a winning card to
control the next Presidential election.
In all these efforts at reform, the House
may anticipate the opposition of a He
pumicau fenaie; out, mooing me purse
strings and furnishing; the motive power
of the Government, it eaii at any time
lictate terms to that hotly by a refusal
to furnish the appropriations.
We may anticipate a long session, and
that noeilort will be spared to unearth
all the abuses and corruptions of the
administration, anil that (lie zeal of the
House will be quickened by the hope of
getting up some telling documents for
the Presidential election. The key note
of its policy is well sounded in the ad
mirable address of Mr. Lamar before
the Democratic caucus, and we are sure
that the Senate will follow the course
pointed out by the distinguished Missis
sippian, to restore the Government to
the principles and practices of its found
ers. The election of Mr. Kerr to the
speakership seems to have given general
satisfaction, and we may anticipate the
utmost harmony in the ranks of the
party in carrying out the work of the
session.

Too .tinny Non-Produccrs.
Mr. Daniel Dennett, of New Orleans.
has written an article, for the Time#
newspaper of that place, givinirifood and
sutlicicnt reasons why Louisiana is poor
and tlie Crescent City unthrifty. He
shows that not one acre in ten of the
soil of the State is in cultivation, and
not one acre in ten of the richest lands.
Almost exclusively upon agriculture
the people depend for prosperity, and
yet not one in seven fo'lows the plow or
works the hoe. Me shows, too, that out
of a population of seven hundred and
twenty-six thousand, in 1S70, the enor
mous and startling proportions of six
hundred thousand arc non-producers.
And this is true of the hest farmiair and
finest stock-raising State on the conti
nent! He says: "What we want i?
ten men at the nlow handle where we
have one. We Want much less land, to
the hand, and more complete cultiva
tion. We want hundreds of thousand
small farms, in 1870 Louisiana had
but 28,0110 farms and plantations. It
ought to have had at lea-t. 200,000 farms.
Our .State, if under a high state of culti
vation, like some portions of Europe,
with large investments in home facto
ries, mills and machine shops, could ea
sily support a population of live mil
lions. It now but poorly supports one
seventh of live millions- The German
Empire, with a surface about equal to
that of live such States as Louisiana, and
with a soil far inferior to ours, supports
forty-three millions of people, a larger
population than that of the United
States in 1*70. If Louisiana, Mississip
pi, Texas, Arkansas and Alabama had
live men at the plow, where they now
have one, the business, prosperity and
wealth of New Orleans would increase
about in the same proportion. New
Orleans looks for prosperity from a
. i rup.>i
I'l 1 PIUI'U, uiiu uiiiiiiiitj imui
population. Our State hive is too weak.
We want more bees lo secure an ample
yield of honey.?There are too many
drones and too many moths in the hive.
That's exactly what's the trouble. A
good .State government is a very good
thing i?nd a bad Stale government is a
very bad thing, but there are oilier good
ami bad things besides these."
These remarks apply to the whole
Moulli, ami to nownurc more lorejoiy
tlnm to our own State and County. We
haveliumlruils of acres of ?*in productive
lands, lacking cultivation because so
many of our people of all classes, sexes
and conditions crowd our towns and
villages or linger about cross-road stores,
whilst the plow stands idle in the fur
row, and our lands are lying waste. The
labor of tlie field lies at the basis of all
our prosperity, ami if this be lacking,
it is folly to talk of honest government
and oppressive taxation.
Important Decision.
The Auf/wita C/ironicfr &' &rnfinrfre
fers to a decision lately made by an
Ohio Court, which is very important to
all merchants ordering produce from
the West. The decision is to the ell'ect
that the bill of lading covers only the
goods actually received, and that the
railroad company is not 1 initio beyond
that. The C. & S. says:?
"It is to be presumed that this on.se
will find its way to the .Supreme Court
of Ohio, and if the decision of the lower
Con it. he sustained hy this tribunal, it is
prohahle that there will be a revolution
in Augusta in the method of doing
business with the West. The custom
whieh prevails here now, and which has
tkivtvuiliwl fn?' coViM-111 v/ifiru will nf i?r?
cessity he abolished, as no prudent
dealer \v<#uItl !'r?*J 'ale in continuing it.
if a provision dealer orders a car load
of c??ni or of bacon from Ohio or Chica
go, the shipper draws a sight d"aft for
the price, attaches to it the railway
company's bill of lading, and forwards
it for collection. The dealer pays it,
taking the bill of lading a guarantee
that the goods for which he pays have
been delivered to the railroad, and are!
on the way to Augusta. Hut under the
decision published this moruiug he is
absolutely at the mercy of the shipper,
and takes the bill of lading at his peril, j
If he has ordered ten thousand bushels j
of corn and pay a Right draft, with hill
of lading attached, f<>r the price of ten 1
thousand bushels, and only one thou-'
sand bushels arrive, lie lias no redress
in the event of the insolvency of the
party from which lie purchased.* A ease
similar to that reported in < incinnati is
pending in Maryland, ami in thai State
the lower Court held that the railway
company was responsible upon its bill
of lading, whether the goods were actu
ally received or not."

The most important matter of Lcgis
lative business during (lie past week
' has been the supply or tax bill which
passed the House at 1 mill less than tiie
figures agreed upon a week ago. The
! sum amounts to iij mills, distributed as
follows:
Sec. 1. l-'or salaries 1
J I'lMll (lliU tJUU 1 UliMt; 1 11 r) L I
till ions 11
;5. Public schools 11
1. Expenses General A*scni
1)1 v 11-10
5. Priming \
(i. Interest on public debt 2
14. JJeticiences 1 2-5
OA
This is ] of a mill less than the bill of
the last session which the (iovernor ve
toed, and a fraction less than the one
lie recommended. The House also on
Wednesday passed the bill to its third
reading which provides for the pay-,
incnl of certain claims (the big bonan
za.) It levies A mill annually for fourj
tmikiv Tlin I v i I 1 to hiiv Mil'tMin i mini if - <
!edncss (the little bonanza) will be re
j ported back from the Com in it tec of
I Ways and Means, to which it was re
'committcd. It is expected to levy 18-15
of a mill annually for four years. So
the whole levy wiil be. except for the
counties, within 11 mills.
This is regarded as a triumph of the
moderate party and is owing to the.per
sistent eflbrts of the (Governor, and the
most discreet of the members. The
bill 84 mills county tax for Abbeville, A
mill of which is to pay delicienccs of
the present year.
In the Senate, a bill to repeal Section
55, Chapter CXX, of the General Stat
utes, relating to liens on crops, after
being amended so as to take effect on
the 1st of January, 1877, was passed to
a third .leading.
A bill to amend an act to establish l>y
liiw mu vuimg [irt'CMit'is V1 niv >?iiwu?
' counties of the .State, after amendment
was passed to a third reading.
The Judiciary Committee reported
favorably on bills to amend the law in
relation to obstructions in streams; to
amend the law in relation to arrest,
commitment and bail; to amend the
law in relation to Trial Justices in Co
lumhia; to auihori/.e the foremen of
: trrand juries to administer oaths; to re
| lievc defendants in criminal cases from
1 attendance on the Supreme Court pend
ing appeals; to amend chapter of the
General Statutes, relating to ipiarantine.
In the House, were introduced a bill
to repeal an act to secure advances for
agricultural purposes, call I he lien lu\v;j
jabill to encourage tl>e restoration ol
I old buildings, and the erection or new
( lies; a bill to repeal an act to repeal j
the usury laws of this .State, and to;
'limit the rate of interest a bill to tax
owners of dojjs.
In the Mouse, Mr. W. M. Holland in
troduced a bill to compel merchants and |
others sampling cotton to return the
samples to the bale before weighing the
same ; bill to repeal an act entitled "An
I act for the better prot?ci<>n of land!
jowners and persons routing land to oth-1
I ers for agricultural purposes," and to;
amend an act relating thereto, and bill
to establish a new judicial and election j
!county from portions of the counties of!
Abbeville, Laurens, Newberry and
Edgefield, to be known as Ninety-Six
County.

The Conservatives have. as yet, no can
didates iu the field. A. B. Knowlton,
(if Orangeburg, is strongly supported
by Ilayne, of Marion, and the Orange

from this fact is Whipper's main rival.

Charleston delegation, and is by no

the light will be between Judge Maher

half of good roads, ami the benefit of ^
utilizing convict laborin building iheui, 0,
! which applies with equal force to our.d<
Own State and section. He thusdis-jP
i i I
courses upon the ways and means: ! *
"How can we have good roads? Make 'p

j ways wrong to insult honest mechanics ()|
| by teaching convicts their trades. We'ai
can't build a railroad by every man'sjst
I house. JVrhaps we have enough rail- u
! roads until increased production sluill!(>J
,give them more to do. Perhaps nobody uj
likes to see the.State govcrinnent hiring: j(,
i its convicts to individuals, for farming, j f(,
brick-making, or any thing of the sort. at
Make good roads of our army of con
victs. We need the roads, and don't
know what to do with the convicts, ta
We can try the experiment at least?it t)
can't be worse than the experiments we
have made, llow can it lie managed V ul
How can the htate and county govern- ?i
ments adjust themselves to the work? (,|
Who shall furnish the tools? the
guards? the food? We elcct Legisla- c<
tors?that is we elects mem hers of the i f()
Legislature, to answer such questions. |
They can lind the answer if only they | fl
are willing and capable. G
Convict labor, making good roads in 1 ni
Georgia, would conflict with no form of G
skilled labor. Road-making is a public it;
work of general utility. si
It may take twenty years to make ui
rrtuul rruutu itrhnrn nur lmnrilp npffl thpm. ill
Jilit what will we prcL for our convict
labor if wo do not use it in some such
way? A few thousand dollars a year.
(Jood roads in a few counties would in
crease the revenues of the State by in
creasing the value of property for more
than the pitiful hire we receive for our
convict labor. If any Legislator wish
es. to deserve a monument, wishes to
make himself historic in Georgia, let w
him frame a law that shall turn our b<
army of convicts upon our bad roads, jds
and work them till they are good. We
and our children will call hint blessed." ti

The most important question now be
fore the State press, and under discussion
by our planters is, whether it is cheaper
to fence in the stock of the country or
the crops. Taking into consideration rc
the fact that we are almost exclusively
an agricultural people, and that little or
no attention is paid to stock of anyI'.1"
kind, except work animals, it appears)'?
to us thai there can be no question as to
which plan would be the least trouble
and the least expensive tothe farmer.
The cost of building and repairing!*",
fences every year is greater than the
\vilin? nr nil i! /.vlnelc rn11tii 11 irh.1, l;irire in
the country. Besides, in the greater!
portion of our country the wood land tu
allords little or no pasturage worth the ik
name. Kvery intelligent planter knows i
that cuttle mutiingover cultivated lands!
and eating oil' the vegetable matter, do
inlinitely more damage than I he benefit' of
they derive therefrom. Wherever the sli
no i'enee law lias been adopted it works di
admiralilv, and the planters would not. |a
for any consideration return to the old th
system. * j pi
We notice some have introduced billsjsii
for some of the Comities in the State ly
Legislature to have a fence law. We i)
trust the law may be made general, and w
that it be so framed as to ahoiv the Coun-1 X

President's Message.
"Vasiiiuton, December 7.
The Presidents message opens: In
ibmltting my seventh annual message
> Congress in Llie centennial year of (
;ir national existence as a free ami in-|,
ependeiit people, it affords me great;]
leasure to recur to tin; advancement!
iat has been made from the time of the

lie President earnestly recommends
iat a constitutional amendment be
ibmitted to the legislatures, making
the duty of each Slate to establish and
,revt*r maintain free public schools, ;
lequate to ilie tdueation of ull children j ?
i the rudimentary brunches, irrespeet-l,

ieroof, either by legislative, municipal'
r other authorities, for the benefit or j
d, directly <?r indirectly, of any relig-j.
us sect or denomination, or in aid orj
u* the benelit of any other object of I
ly nature or kind whatever.
lie alludes to the importance of cor-|
ictini* the evil of vast' amounts of un- I
,xed church property, mid estimates
nit by 1S90, if unchecked, this proper- 1
' will reach a sum exceeding uOO,- J
0,0(10. He would suggest the taxation

ily the last resting place of the dead
Relations vvith most foreign powers >
)iitinue on a satisfactory and friendly
oting.
Alluding to smuggling through the
ee zone and cattle raids on the Rio
rande, the President says an exped
ient of an armed vessel on the Rio
rande for (hat purpose is on trial, and
^is hoped that, if not thwarted by the
mllowness of the river and other nat
ral obstacles, it may materially eon trili
te to the protection of the herdsmen of]
exas. I
Discussing specie resumption, the!
resident says: ''Too much stress can
Dt he laid upon this question, and J!
iipe Congress may be induced to in-|
ire the consummation of the act of thej
st Congress at its last session to bring j
jout specie resumption on and after I
inuary 1, 1879, at the farthest. It!,
ould be a great blessing if this could i
2 consummated at even an earlier

A later than January 1, 1877. A hear- J
reaction would set in at once, and'j
itli it a desire to make the currency i
Inal to what it purports to be.
lie suggests that Ihe Secretary of the 11
reasury be authorized lo redeem say i'
)t to exceed $2,000,001) monthly of le- '
U tender notes by issuing in theirsiead

lie suggest that some better means l?e j
innd for verifying claims Against the;
ivernment than through the Court of j
lainis, especially those growing out of
ic late war. They are in nearly every I
istance exorbitant.
The President says: "Make educa-i

Our Next President.
'rlitnr Pri'HH k Banner:
There has probably never been a rpies
oii before the people that haa excited ai
lore lively interest than as to who will j
race the Presidential chair next. I i
o not propose in this article to put the!
ublie mind at rest on the subject, hut I j
mply aim to arouse the people out of!
le lethargy into which they have al
tweii themselves to fall after the late
lepublicau tritiniph. All over the coun
y the Republicans are rejoicing over
n: downfall of the Democratic hopes,
ml the merry fellows are congratulating
Boss" Grant on the certainty of his
.-election lor a third term. The money
uestion seems to have turned Ihepub
c mind from the right track, and cen
tred it on money. CSrantand his jolly
row arc truly thankful at the sudden
irn of affairs. Washington set the ex
inple of limiting the Presidential term
> two years :tt most, sind now we have
Yankee tanner who is so eminently
seful as chief executive, as to demand
third term over the heads of seventeen
ther Presidents. He even goes fur
ler?he makes a great sacrifice in serv
lgsucha little penny concern as the
nitcd Slates of America, the tame na
on the presidency of which our illus
ious Washington considered an honor
> hold.
The whole thing of Grant's adminis
ation has become disgusting to decent
fwntl<* Tim fnwii'ivri i>>. 1 ii icti?rc cm if is;
lid, have become so disgusted at the
isgracel'ul rowdy, drunken frolics at
10 National Capital, that they very re
ictlantly coiue as ministers to Ulysses'
our'.
Now the question has been agitated
>r a l'?ng time, ''Are we to have Grant
ir u third term? The election next
car is to he one of the most important
iat has ever occurred in America. It
in the centennial year, ?hcn we are
) cclehra'e our lirst one hundred years
f independence.
If Grant is elected for a third term, it
not dillicult to see whether we will
k*er cab-orate another century of inde
im deuce. "Anything to heat Grant."
