latter result was. however, when the
" stay-at-honics were largei.v in evi
dence: many Democrats who didn t
vote for Darker for keeping a time
lock on his lips till after nomination,
and some others voting for Roose
vc'.t because of his espousal of DotllO
cratie doctrines. Doubtless some of
them voted, likewise for Prohibi
tion. it would seem, from these
signs that prohibition sentiment has
lately been'making wonderful strides
all over the country. Who would
have supposed tiiat in this year of
ltit»7. Kentucky, famous the world
over for the excellence of its corn
juice as one of the trinity of its
lioasted greatness, should have " gone
dry?" It cannot be regarded as a
''partisan" issue that accomplished
this, either, for the same contention
came very near ousting the Republi
cans in that home of the trusts. New-
Jersey. from its entrenched power.
Statistics compiled at Washington
shows that HH.tiOO.OOP of the eighty
odd million inhabitants of the United
States now live in communities in
which the law does not permit the
sale of alcoholic beverages, in other
words, considerably more than one
third of all the inhabitants of the
country cannot buy liquor in their
neightiorhood at licensed liars, and
in the great majority of these dry
communities, should any of the in
habitants defy the law and spend
money to quench their thirst they
would run the imminent risk of penal
ties, and subject to condign punish
ment the persons from whom they
bought the liquor.
The bare suspicion that Vice Pres
ident Fairbanks authorized the serv
ing of the festive cocktail at a lunch
eon given by him to President Roose
velt in Indianopolis has "cookedhis
goose," as effectively for the Presi
dential nomination, as if it had fallen
from the spit into the fire. It like
wise prevented his own church from
electing him a delegate to the Gen
eral Conference. Only three years
ago he was unanimously elected a
delegate.
When the news was flashed over
the country that Roosevelt drank
champagne at luncheon in St. I/xiis,
his little by-play of turned glass ind
afterwards filling and gulping it
down, did not suit those who, all
though noted for their love of cold
water, do not carry it on both shoul
ders at the same time. As sop to the
whale, he approved the constitution
of Oklahoma, which carries a prohi
bition clause to run twenty-live
years.
It is predicted by persons who have
watched the trend of affairs at the
National Capital, that, should a long
debate on the Hepburn bill be
brought on, the Prohibitionists will
take advantage of the opportunity to
raise the question of prohibiting the
sale of liquor in the District of Co
lumbia, and that a law to this effect
will be adopted. It is only four
years ago, by special enactment that
received nearly every vote in l>oth
branches of Congress, a law was
passed against the sale of alcoholic
beverages in the restaurants in the
Capitol. Congress a year later, pro
hibited the sale of all liquors at army
posts. Uncle Sam's lighting men
were thus deprived of the privilege,
as old as the army itself, of purchas
ing at post canteen allowances of
grog which, in the judgment of their
officers, they could stand without in
jury to the service. A Federal stat
ute was enacted more than fifty
years ago against the sale of liquor
to Indians on or off their reserva
tions.
These instances show the attitude
of the national lawmakers toward the
temperance movement whenever they
are confronted by it. There is not
now in Congress a member elected as
a Prohibitionist, and although the
majority of the States have espoused
the prohibition cause in one form or
another, there are said to be only
twenty-two State legislators who
were elected on the Prohibition
ticket.
In this State there are 50 so-called
dry towns, in Oregon there arc 12
dry counties out of 33; in California.
Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado,
the anti-Saloon League is active;
Maine, North Dakota, Oklahoma and
Kansas and Georgia after 1903. are
Prohibition States, and in all other
States except Montana. Idaho, Wy
oming, Nevada. Utah, there are
towns or counties that have gone
dry. By the term "dry" is meant,
however, in most places, as here,
suppression of the traffic on Sundays.
The 50 dry towns in this State, come
under this inhibition, and doubtless
this is true in many other States.
A Mot' NT AIN near Montpelier,
France, called Mt. Brinquez, 1.200

sweeping everything before it.
The Robinson Disbarment Case

W 11. Hell and Thomas M. Vance ap
p-ared for Judge Robinson. Mr. J
II A levandor. Assistant Attorney
General. -t.ited he was a member of
the griev ance commit tee ot the
Washington Har Association, which
eommittee deemed it proper to look
after such matters as now before the
court, called attention to the eon
temptihle allegations contained in
the petition for rehearing in the
Marie Carrau controversy, whieh
formed the basis of the present dis
barment proceedings. Hon. Thomas
M. Vance was somewhat severe in
his denunciation of the attitude of
attorney Alexander; was willing to
meet him as a representative from
the Attorney-General's oil ice, but
considered he had no right to ap
appear before the Court and assume
the I Jar Association had condemned
Judge Robinson, when it had done
nothing of the kind; that he (Vance)
is a member of such body and know
it was not in the habit of condemn
ing any member unheard. If it
should pursue or countenance any
such policy, the sooner its mission
shall end the better. Therefore he
was forced to the conclusion that
Alexander's pretensions were gratui
tous. General Vance grew eloquent
when he observed that he would
rather face the gallows than to have
his integrity as a member of the
profession assailed by a judgment of
disbarment; that the odium of such a
ruling would follow an attorney
wherever he might go. even to the
jungles of India or Africa, quoting a
passage of Roman history to illus-
trate his {mint, lie admitted such a
decision may not work a forfeiture of
an attorney's license from the Fed
eral courts, whose jurisdiction is
foreign to that of the State tribunals.
The arguments of Attorney Shocks
and Judge Hell, of Seattle, were
pointed and forcible. The latter
claimed his relations with Judge
Robinson had been intimate for sev
eral years; knew his client was in
clined to uniform courtesy to courts
and members of the bar and had felt
deeply over the outcome of the S d
livan nuncupative will controversy.
Since Robinson had made ample
apology, the court should lie consid
erate. Attorney Falknor claimed he
appeared because the court had di
rected the Attorney General's oflice
to institute the present
that he believed that the court had
the power to protect its own dignity
from invidious assaults upon its own
integrity. After the conclusion of
the arguments the matter was taken
under advisement.
There was a report at the State
house that soon after tin; objection
able document was filed, that Miss
Carrau took a copy thereof to the
Timis oflice, at Seattle, and the edi
tor hesitated about publishing the
contents in detail. Hut it is claimed
by the Judge's friends he was no
party to that transaction.
NEW HENNEPIN CANAL NOW OPEN.
The United States steamer Marion
was the first steamer to pass through
the Hennepin Canal, which was com
pleted last month, after the enter
prise. which connects the upper Illi
nois River with the Mississippi at
Rock Island, had been under way for
thirty-six years. The Marion was
the first lioat to traverse the entire
length of the canal, which is aliout
eighty miles, and she put in ten days
on the trip. She plowed through ice
all the way, and as navigation in that
section has closed for the winter, it
is probable that no further use will
be made of the canal until next
spring. The boat started into the
canal at liurcau on the Illinois River
and worked her way through to Rook
Island. On reaching Rock Island
she was greeted by a chorus of whis
tles. The canal was recently com
pleted under the direction of Major
C. S. Riche, of the Corps of United
States Engineers, who was trans
ferred to the Rock Island district in
11(03. and has had charge of the canal
since that time. It was begun by
the Government in IH7I. at a time
when the railroad facilities of the
country had not reached their pres
ent stage of development. The
working plant had not boon OIK- rated
since the work began, but a few
years ago, when it became apparent
that the commerce of the country
demanded the improvement of the
waterways, the work of construction
was taken up and the canal was
pushed to completion. The topog
raphy of the country made it nec
essary to build several locks in the
artiticial watercourse.

That Message.
Tin- Pr<->idcnt s message to Con ;
gn-.s is given ui nn abivviated form
in this number of tin* STANIIAUD. It
is unnecessary to publish it entire,
as it is very improliable that more
than one in ten of our readers could
tint! time to wade t broach 11 it* vapid
|Miiii|x»ity of liiis State papers when
tlie writer is actuated by fixed pol
icies and keeps on presenting them
with endless iteration.
The present message is. if |M>ssilile,
more Kooseveltian than those which
have preeeded it. in that lie now
openly advocates principles that were
condemned by the forefathers and
made the subject of constitutional
guaranty by them. He o}icnly advo
cates centralization of Federal power,
as well as the admission to this coun
try of the countless hoards of foreign
heathen nations, to usurp the privil
ag»'S of home labor and the rights of
American citizenship, lie Seems de
termined to recognize an equality
here of the dirty and demoralizing
little Japs, that has only seemed to
accentuate their insolence towards
our people and produce an insuffera
ably overbearing demeanor towards
the world's powers.
It is a fact that during the official
reading of the document Itefore Con
gress, many topics presented were,
omitted, by agreement of the mem
bers. so as not to waste time by lis
tening to the stilted arguments that
had been the subject of previous mes
sages. Take from it what has been
stated in other form and many times,
and there would be very little left of
it. The main points are made to
bear, when possible, as a corelative
trend upon those fundamental ideas
of the founders of our government, to
show that they erred in making a
careful adjustment- of the duties and
jtowcrs of the general government,
and as careful a consideration of the
r ghts specially reserved to t he States
as being nearer the people, in fram
ing the Federal constitution. It was
a paramount object, likewise, to main
tain and safeguard the dignity of
our citizanship. This was shown in
providing the qualifications for hold
ing office and the rules prescribed for
admission of aliens to the enjoyment
of political rights even from the most
civilized nations.
It has always been a prerogative of
the usurper in dividing the fate of
nations that have retrograded, to first
degrade the citizanship, and in this
method we see the hand of a Hamil
ton, to change our form of govern
ment, ot distinctions of caste, and
hereditary rule, such as would,unre
strained mark the reign of a tyrant,
ready to divide his subjects into two
classes, liars and fools.
S vni.E. MARTEN ASH MINK. —A cor
respondent. to decide a l>et, has
ssked us to describe the distinctive
characteristics of the Sable, the Mar
ten and the Mink. While these ani
mals have many points that are held
in common. l*:ing carnivorous and of
the weasel family, their habitation is
not so universal. The sable is found
almost exclusively in the frozen
mountains of Kuropean and Arctic
Russia. It is specially prized for its
fur, and a singlo skin is often sold at
from S2O to SOO, according to One
ness and color. The hairs of the
sable are so soft that they will lie
any way they are placed. The color
of the fur varies with the season. In
summer, it is brownish with white
sjtots on the head and sometimes a
greyish neck. In winter, the fur
is much darker, but not so much as
to justify the use of its name for a
synomym of jet blackness. The var
ious species of marten, mink and
fisher, are found in this country, but
their furs are of little value selling
at from $1.50 to $2.50, varying in
color from ash to grey and yellowish
brown with sometimes small splotches
of white alxnit the throat and neck.

Seattle leads in tnost things, and
it is now at least one ahead of Taeo
ina, in having a thief who stole from
the contribution-plate. After the au
dience had been carefully panhandled
and the members had chcefully and
and oliediently coughed up several
hundred dollars, some sneak thief re
morselessly appropriated the whole
amount to his own use. That re
minds us of, and is almost bad as, a
story told of that talented butcxcen
tric genius who once lived in this
community, Mr. Horatio Ailing. It
was said that had once been a preach
er, which of course made his part the
more easy. He organized a society
of his own, whose nets and pitfalls
were not held up as a menace to in
spire righteousness, a sect in fact
whose creed might not primarily in
terfere with anybody's politics or re
ligion. It is hardly necessary to say
that it readily found adherents. The
attendance at the first meeting was
large and the contributions liberal;
but unfortunately the liberality of
the new dispensation seemed to have
immediate effect upon the Stewarts,
two of the main pillars, who innnedi
pocketed the "swag." This unfair
preceding broke up the church, its
" pastor" declaring that no creed on
earth could 1)0 expected to iive on

that modesty forbade; and be called
attention to the fact that he did not
attend the Kansas City Convention,
l»ocauso he was a candidate at that
time. He declared, with a smile, "It
may be necessary for me to practice
a little modesty, although it is unu
sual for me to do so."

Land laws should be revised to pre
vent monopoly and promote home-mak
ing.
National forests should be extended

TiieWinlock Traoeuv. —A dread
ful encounter took place at Winloek.
Monday morning, while Night Watch
man E. E. McFadden was attempt
ing to arrest a couple of burglars,
going by the names of Albert and
George Cavoie, who had l>eon caught
in an attempt to rob the local l»ank,
the post office and drug store. They
were caught carrying a bundle, and
while the Sheriff and one of his posse
were searching the package both
men started to run down the road.
McFadden sprang after them when
they turned and tired two shots,
striking McFadden in the chest
above the heart. The wounded man
sank to the ground and was carried
to the hospital. The renegades then
took to the brush, the posse close
after them. One fugitive was dis
covered and a volley tired, where
upon it was found the two burglars
were dead, one shot through the
stomach and the other in the heart.
The package they carried contained
all sorts of burglars' tools, leaving no
doubt either of their occupation or
j their guilt. It is thought that the
| true name of one of the men was Al
bert Mitchell, as a card bearing that
name was found on him. Neither of
the crooks was over 20 years of age,
but their possessions show that they
were undoubtedly experts in their
business. At last accounts the condi
tion of McFadden, the wounded of-
Ucer, was considered quite precarious.
