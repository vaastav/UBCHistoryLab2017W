THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The President's message to the
Congress contains nothing new or
striking. In brief it is practically a
wpetition of what he has heretofore
recomniended. He refers to the usual
?objects touched upon In such docu?
ments, in his usual style. The only
fftAtures of hla message worthy of
special comment are bis reference to
railroad control by the natianaj
government, and his fling at the
Democratic attitude on injunctlous
aftVting labor organixatione. In
reference to the first proposition Mr.
Roosevelt would direst the state? of
ail control over railroads doing an
Interstate business, and in this con?
nection he says: "The opposition
to government control of these great
corporations makes Its most effec?
tive effort in the shape of an ap?
peal to the old doctrine of States'
rights. The proposal to make the
national government supreme over,
prefore to give it complete
\over, the railroad? is merely
rt*aJ to carry out to the letter
e prime purposes, if not the
rpoae.for which the conntitu
