THAT KAHN BILL. AGAIN.
It Ib no pood going to the top of the
nearest hill to look for trouble. -It is
therefore no Rood for any one to de
cide that the Knhn bill will pass. There
are many unwise bills presented to
Congress, nnd they do not pass. There
arc many specious bills put forward
and they never come to fruition. Con
Bressman Kahn's bill Is specious, but
it Is by no means certain that It will go
through.
There Is a decided bait in the matter.
2t was a clever move to suggest that
the Federal Government should take
the whole of the expense of our leper
colony off our hands. The expense Is
a very heavy one. At the last session
of the Legislature J186,000 was voted
tor the support of the Leper Settlement
and the segregation and collection of
lepers, and $38,400 was voted for sala
ries of people looking after the lepers,
the total being $224,400 for two years,
or $112,200 annually. This does not rep
resent anything like the total cost for
a great deal is done by private charity
- In-adldtlon o the public funds expend
ed. There can be no doubt that this is a
very serious drain upon the taxpyers
of the Territory. But there are some
things that are greater than money.
"We have devoted ourselves heroically
to the stamping out of leprosy among
our people. We have very nearly suc
ceeded. The number of lepers sent to
the settlement is yearly becoming
smaller. If we are left alone we will
eradicate the disease. The glory of
having succeeded in such a noble and
such a self sacrificing fight is worth
far more to us than money. And Just
as we are on the threshold of success,
comes some one who knows nothing of
our conditions and our stern and un
compromising fight, and proposes to
practically undo the good we have suc
ceeded in doing, offering us a money
sop in compensation. It Is to be hoped
no one in the Territory will be tempted
"by such a paltry bait.
Our main hope Is that the bill may be
killed in committee. Every one inter
ested in the Islands should work in
the hardest way possible in Washington
to defeat this measure which
and utterly unjust.
is cruel
WORTH STUDY.
A very remarkable and a very valu
able article from the pen of Sir Rob
ert Hart, has appeared simultaneously
in the British Fortnightly and the Am
erican Cosmpolltnn. Sir Robert Hart
. has spent his life in China. If any
European or American knows China
better 'it is a matter of grave doubt.
,He has been forty-five years in the
country, has hardly ever taken a vaca
tion and has been intimately connect
ed with the principal public men of
the empire. He has always been a
reticent man, and "when he breaks sil
ence In this way, what he has to say
upon a subject so intimately known
to him is certainly worth careful read-
ing and full consideration.
The article describes In a general
view the siege of the Peking Legations,
and the tale is well told, but others
and more practiced pens have done this.
The value of Sir Robert Hart's paper
is his view on the Chinese problem and
on the causes which brought about
.the Boxer outbreak. There is no stud
ent of Chinese affairs, and they are
s among the most Important of affairs to
us as a nation, who can afford to pass
by this clear exposition of the situa
tion, and the deductions as to the fu
ture. Sir Robert shows that there was am
ple warning of the coming storm, only
no one would listen to the warning or
reau me signs of the times. The ru
mors that the dynasty was to be upset,
the foreigners were to be exterminated
on a given date, that China was to be
partitioned among the powers and so
forth wer,e constant. The English pa
papers published at Tientsin, Shanghai
and Hongkong saw what was coming
on, nut were laughed at for their pre
diction. The world's powers could not
believe that the quiescent Chinese could
break forth Into an organized move
ment which would tax their utmost ef-
forts to curb.
The Boxer movement, as viewed by
blr Robert, Is a patriotic movement.
Moreover he says that it was the direct
teaching of the Europeans which
brought It about. Europeans and Am
ericans who wanted to sell guns, rifles
and ammunition to the Chinese, were
eager to have the Imperial Government
establish a standing army. The Chi
nese officials listened to these sugges
tions, made some show of following
them, and thought. The result of that
thought was that a volunteer system
was the thing needed. Their last obser
vation was the success o the volun
, teer Boers against trained troops at
..Majuba Hill, and emphasized after the
movement commenced by the check of
trained troops by popular lives at the
Tugela, Magersfonteln and the early
struggles of the Boer war. Moreover,
educated Chinese are not ignorant of
American history at the close of last
Century, In a fortnight, we will .have
to say two centuries ago,
Sir Robert Hart dwell strongly on
this. He nay "foreign encroachment
had reached Its limit. When foreign
force ordered the canhlcrlng of nn ofll
clnl, that ulllclal became the more pop
uliir. He quotes the names of many
whom he considers nble man, nnd then
says:
"However mistaken may have been
their rending of foreigners, and how
over wrong their manner of action,
these men eminent In their own coun
try for their learning and services
were nnlmntod by partlotlsm, wore en
raircd at foreign dictation, nnd had the
courage of their convictions. We must
do them the Justice of allowing they
were actuated by high motives and
love of country; but that does not al
ways or necessarily mean political ab
ility or highest wisdom."
Looking to the future Sir Robert says
that the Boxer will not die out, but
that It will Increase and spreud In pro
portions that we will be unable to con
trol and will simply defy us. It Is the
civilization of the West up against the
civilization of the East, with numbers
nnd cohesive power on the side of the
latter. This able observer believes most
thoroughly In the "yellow peril." At
the present time he sees but three
courses, partition, change of dynasty
or patching up the Manchu rule. Par
tition he shows impracticable in the
long run. A new dynasty he sees no
man of mark sulllclently able to found.
The patching up, he considers the saf
est and most diplomatic course to be
persued. But whatever is done, the fu
ture Is yet big with fate, and the West
ern world Is not going to sponge China
from the slate of practical politics.
There is according to Sir Robert only
one solution which will be of permanent
usefulness. That solution Is the spread
of Christianity. If the country would
accept the gospel, Its people might be
reasoned with. Until it does so, there
will always be a different plane and
there never can be Satisfactory and
safe intercourse, Sir Robert's conclud-"
Ing words are:
"If, in spite of official opposition and
popular irritation, Christianity were to
make a mighty advance and so spread
through the land as to convert China
into the friendliest of friendly powers
and the foremost patron of all that
makes for peace and good will; that
too would prick the Boxer balloon and
disperse the noxious gas which threat
ens to swell the race-hatred progam
and poison and Imperil the world's fu
ture. "The words imperil the world's fu
ture' will doubtless provoke a laugh
well, let them do so, but let them
stand! Twenty millions or more of
Boxers, armed, drilled, disciplined, and
animated by patriotic if mistaken
motives will make residence In China
impossible for foreigners, will take
back from foreigners everything for
eigners have taken from China, will
pay off old grudges with Interest, and
will carry the Chinese Hag and Chinese
arms' into many a place that even fan
cy will not suggest today, thus pre
paring for the future upheavals and
disasters never even dreamed of.
"In fifty years' time there will be
millions of Boxers in serried-ranks and
war's panoply at the call of the Chinese
government; there is not the FlJrhtest
doubt of that. And if the Chinese
I Koverntnpn continues to exists It 'will
encourare anil it will be quite right to
enooura-- uphold and develop this
national Chinese movement.
"Of course, common sense may keep
China from initiating an aggressive
poncy anu irom going to extremes; but
foreign dictation must some day cease
and foreigners some day go, and the
episode now called attention to is to
day's hint to the future."
That last paragraph is wortli a good
deal of attention. That the Cabinet
and President of the United States
have thoroughly appreciated the situ
ation has been shown by their action.
How the powers will come out of th'eir
Imbroello remains to b" seen. But this
is certain that whatever is done Is
fraught with momentous Influence up
on the future of our descendants. The
Chinese question is a very serious one
indeed.
The proposed tunnel between Africa
and Europe is not regarded as a safe
financial scheme by many prominent
men even In France. The engineering
dilliculties might not be so great, but
the traffic would be expensive and there
never could be the amount of freight
and the number of passengers which
the promoters figure on.
Judge Sllllman announces that he
foresaw the present dlfilculty in mak
ing an appointment to the vacant sec
ond circuit, before he retired. Every
man has a right to do the best for him
self, but one must ask if ex-Judge Sllll
man could forsee so much, why did he
ever accept the position in the first
place. It looks very much as If he set
to work to keep a chair warm, and
now finds that it is getting cold for the
gentleman he kept Its heat up for.
In his message to Congress, President
McKinley made mention of the system
of getting Consular reports before the
general public daily. It is an Innova
tion which has struck the commercial
world with surprise. Most countries
publish such reports yearly, and only
a few half yearly or quarterly. Ths
result is that little good Is derived
from the reports. The United States'
system, which is unique, has put our
commercial men ahead wonderfully.
The great German trans-Atlantic
steamship lines use only American
coal. The Deutschland, before setting
out to break the speed record of the
sea, filled up her bunkers at New York.
So that if the Germans can build gig
antic steamers and the finest of ma
chinery, they require American coal to
get the best results from their work.
A test was recently jnade of Ohio coal
on the Bavarian State railways and
the fuel was found to be superior to
the best native coal. At Hamburg,
West Virginia gas coal haB been tested
and found superior to the Cardiff
standard. It is only scarcity of ton
nage and consentient pmrhitnni
freights which prevent American coal
from relieving the German coal famine.
Certainly we are a fortunate: ennntrv
with our almost exhauatless natural re
sources, and our natural nush. nnd
enersry. to make usepf them. The Unlt-
