Application? havo been made to me to-par

not to be construed as iadioating any change

i t is inuoh to be regretted, and is regretted
by no one more than myself, that a necessity

DEPARTMENT Or THE INTERIOR.
The_ Secretary ot the Interior reports satis
factory improvement and progress in each of
the several bureaus under the control of the
?Interior Department. They are all in excel
lent cobdition. The work which in some of
(hem for sora'o ytfar* has been in arrears, has
been broni>bt down to a recent date, and in
all the current business has been promptly
dispatched.

8 increased yield of all kinds of produce.
?ven in those States and Territories where
tuning is the principal business, agricultural
vjbrodaets have exceeded the local demand, and
-.?"liberal shipments have been made to distant
gpfe.
During the ygar ending September 30,
?'-1872.-there were issned from the patent office
k. 13,626, patents, 233 extensions and 556 cer?
tiScatcs and registers of trade-marks. During
'the same period 19,587 applications for pat
enta,jncludint:reissues and designs, have been
received and 3,100 cave|t? filed. The fees
received daring the same period amounted to
$700,954 '88', and the total expenditures to
$623,'55>3'90', makins tho net receipts over the
expenditure 3577,400 96. Since 1836 two
hundred" thousand applications for patents
have been filed, and about 133,000 patents is
sued. The office is being conducted under
the same laws and general organization as
were adopted at its original inauguration,
when only from one hundred to fivo hundred
applications wero made per annum. Tho
Commissioner shows that the offico has out
grown the original plan, and that a new organ
ization has become necessary. The subject
was presented to Congress in a special com
munication in February last, with my approval
and the approval of the Secretaay of tho In
terior, and tho suggestions contained in said
communication were embodied in the bill that
was reported to the House by the committee
on patent* at the last session. The subject of
the reorganization of the patent office, as con
templated by the bill referred to, is one of
such importance to the industrial interests of
the country that I commend it to the atten
tion of Coneress.
The commissioner also treats the subject of
the separftion of the Patent Office from the
Department ot tho Interior. % This subject is
also embraced in the bill heretofore referred
to. Tho commissioner complains of the want
of room for tho model gallery, and for tho
working force and necessary files of the offico.
It is impossible to transact the business of the
office pronerly without more room in which to
arrange files and drawings that must be con
sulted hourly in tho transaction of business.
The whole of tho Patent Offioo building will
. goon ho needed, if it is not nlready, for tho
accommodation of the business of the patent
office.
TKNSIOSS.
Tho amonnt paid for pensions in tho last
ftsoal year was 830,169.340. an amount larger
by 83,708,434 than was paid during the pre
ceding year. Of this amount 82,313,409
were paid under the act of Congrecs of Feb
ruary 17, 1871, to survivors of the war of
1812. The aDnual increase of pensions by
the legislation of Congress has more than kept
pace wi'h the natural yearly losses from the
rails. The act of Congress of June 8,1872,
has added, an estimated amouut of ?750,000
per annum t> the rolls, without increasing the
sumberof pensioners. We cannot, therefore,
loook for any substantial decrease in the ei
penditares of the department for some time
to come, or so long as Congress continues to
so ohange the rates of pensions.
The whole number of soldiers enlisted in
the war of the rebellion was 2,688^523. The
total number of claims for invalid pensions is
176,000, being but six percent, of the whole
number of enlisted men. The total number
of claims on hand at the beginning of the
year was 91,689; the number received du
ring the year was 26,574 ; the number dis
posed of was 89,179?making a net gain of
12,604. The number of claims now on file
is 79.0S5. On the 30th of June, 1872, there
were on the rolls the names of 95,495 invalid
military pensioners, 113,518 widows, orphans
and dependent relatives, making an aggregate
of 208,923 army pensioners. At the same
time there were on the rolls the names of 1,
449 navy pensioners, and 1,730 widows, or
phans and dependent relatives, making the
whole number of naval pensioners 3,179.?
There have been received since the passage
of the act to provide pensions fot the survi
vors of the war of 1812, 36,551 applications
prior to June 80,1872. Of these there were
allowed during the last fiscal year 20,126
claims; 4,845 were rejected during the year,
leaving 11,580 claims pending at that date.
The number of pensions of all classes granted
during the last fiscal year was 33,838. Du
ring that period there were dropped from the
rolls fbr various causes, 9,104 names, leaving
a grand total of 232,229 pensioners on the
Tolls on the 3 th of June, 1872. It is thought
that the claims for pensions on account of the
war of 1812, will mil be disposed of by the
first of May, 1873.
i^^iaesgpiated, that $30,480.000 will be re
cwmnebdatfon should receive the early atten
tat of Congress. The interval at present
eitwligKcd bewtween the Federal census is so
long that the information obtained at the de
cennial periods as to tho material condition,
wants and resources of the nation, is of little
practical value after the expiration of the first
half that period.
It would probably obviate the constitutional
provision regarding the decennial census, if a
census taken in 1875 should bo divested of all
political character, and no reapportionment of
congressional representation be made under it.
Such a census, coming as it would in the last
^year of the first century of our national exist
ence, would furnish a noble monument of tho
progress of the United States during that
century.
EDUCATION.
The rapidly-increasing interest in educa
tion is a most encouraging feature in the cur
rent history of tho country, and it is no douht
true that this is due, in a great measure, to
the efforts of the bureau of eduoation. That
office is continually receiving evidences which
abundantly provo its efficiency from the vari
ous institutions of learning and education of
all kinds throuehout the country.
The report of the commissioner contains a
vast amount of educational details of great in
terest.
t The bill now ponding before Congress pro
viding for tho oppropriatino of tho net pro
ceeds of the sales of public lands for educa
tional purposes, to aid tho States in tho gen
eral education of tho rising generation, is a
matter of such great importance to our real
progress and is so unanimously approved by
the leading friends of education that I com
mend it to the favorable attention of Congress.
TERRITORIES.
Affairs in territories are generally satisfac
tory. ^ Tho energy and business capacity of
the pioneers who are setting on the vast do*
mains, not yet incorporated into States, are
keeping pace in internal 'improvements and
civil government with the older communities.
In but one of them, Utah, is the condition of
affairs unsatisfactory, except so far as tho
quiet of the citizen may be disturbed by real
or imaginary danger of Indian hospitalities.
It has seemed to be the policy of the legisla
ture of Utah to evade all responsibility to the
government of tho United States and even to
hold a position in hostility to it.
I recommend a careful revision of fhe
present laws of the Territory by Congress, and
the enactment of suoh a law, (the one pro
posed in Congress at its last session for ins
stanoe, or something similar to it,) as will
secure peace, tho equality of all citizens bo
fore the law, and the ultimate extinguishment
of polygamy. Since the establishment of a
territorial government for tho District of Co
lumbia tho improvement of tho condition of
the city of Washington and surroundings, and
the increased prosperity of the citizens is ob
servable to the most casual visitor. Tho na
tion being a large owner of property in this
city should bear with the citizens of the Dis
trict its just share of the expense of these im
provements.
I recommend, therefore, an appropriation
to reimburse the citizens for the work done
by them along and in front of publio grounds
during the past year, and liberal appropria
tions in order that the improvement and em
bellishment of tho publio buildings and
grounds may keep pace with the improvements
mado by territorial authorities.
AGRICULTURE.
Tho report of the Commissioner of Agri
culture gives a very full and interesting ac
count of the several divisions of that depart
ment?the horticultural, agricultural, statisti
cal, entomological and ohemical, and the ben
efits conferred by each upon tho agricultural
interests of tho cpuntry. The whole report
is a complete history in detail of the workings
of that department in all its branches, show
ing the manner in which tho farmer, mer
chant and miner is informed and the eitent
to which he is aided in his pursuits. The
commissionermakes one recommendation, that
measures be taken by Congress to protect aDd
induce the planting of forests, and suggests
that no part of the public land should be dis
posed of without the condition that one-tenth
of it be reserved in timber, where it exists,
and where it does not exist inducements
should be offered for planting it.
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.
In accordance with the term, of the act of Con
ress approved March J, 1871, provid ing lor the cele
ration ol tho ono hundredth anniversary ot Amer
ican independence, a commission has been orga
nized consisting ol two members from each of the
States and Territories. This commission has held
two sessions, and has mado satisfactory progress in
organization and in the initiatory steps necessary
for carrying out the provisions of the act and (or
*1?? the provisions of the act of June 1st,
1S7~, creating a Centennial Board of Finance.
A preliminary report of progress has been re
ceived from the presidentof the commission.and ia
herewith transmitted.
. 1* will be the duty or the commission at the com
ing session to transmit a full report of progress
made, and to lay before you the details relating to
the exhibition of American and foreign arts, pro
ducts and manufactures, which 6y the terms ofthe
act is to he held nnder the auspices of the govern
ment of the United States in the city oIPhiladelDhia.
in the year 1876.
The celebration will be looked forward to by
American citizens with great interest ss marking
a century of greater progress and prosperity than is
recorded in thehistorvof any other nation, and as
serving a further good purpose in bringing together
on our soil people of all the commercial nations of
the earth in a manner calculated to secure interna
tional good feeling.
CIVIL SERVICE,
An earnest deaire baa been felt to correct abnaea
which ttayegrown op in the civil aerviceof thecoun
try, through the defective mode of making appoint
menta to office. Heretofore federal office* have been
regarded too much aa the toward of political servi
cea. Under authority of Congress rules have been
established to regulate the tenure of office and tbe
mode of appointment*. Itcanuotbe expected that
any system of rules can be entirely effective, and
prove a perfect remedy for the existing evils, until
tbev have been thoroaghly tested by actual practice,
and amended according to the requirements of the
service. During my term of office it shall be my
earnest endeavor to ao apply the rulea aa to secure
the greatest possible reform in the civil service^ of
the government, but it will require tbe direct action
of Congress to render the enforcement of tbe system
binding upon my successors, and I hope that the
experience of the past year, together with appro
priate legislation by Congress, may reach a satis
factory solution of this question, and secure to the
public service for all time a practical method of ob
taining faithful and efficient officers and employ
ees. U. S. Grant.

INDUSTEIALSOGIETY.
From a notice of the proceedings published
in our local columns, it will be seen that the
Industrial Society is to hold its next regular
meeting on Friday next, at 2 o'clock, P. M.
This is for the benefit of tbo people who live
out of town. The farmer?", perhaps more
than any;?tf?isjrof&!> of our citizens, feel the
of a forward movement of some sort.?
The negro labor, of which wo had quite an
abundance after the war for a year or two, is
gradually decreasing, and the exodns from
the couuty is more apparent this fall than
ever before. Problems of tbe knoltiest sort
begin to stare our landholders in the face,
and it is tolerably certain that it will no longer
do to let ourselves drift with the current
without mnkiog sorno effort to help ourselves,
other than what has been already tried.?
Some think that the tenant system will have
to bo generally resorted to; and, indeed,
some of our best farmers, we are informed,
are buildiog new tenant houses with this idea.
Whatever experience in this county teaches,
it is certain that the tenant system in the na
ture of things must be an inferior one ; it is
equally certain that in all ages and countries
it has proved itself a ruinous one. In a coun
try where the tenant system is generally re
sorted to, it is only a question of time how
soon the most fertile regions will become un?
productive barrens. Some men seem to think
that our Valley land, like a cat, has nine
lives ; but they forget that it has nine only.
We say, then, a forward movement of some
sort is necessary. The Industrial Society af
fords an opportunity to make the experiment
at least. There, gathered in council, the
mcr,c power of collected experience may
achieve something. The programme contemn
plated, as shown by the subjects embraced in
the spheres of the standiug committees, looks
very muck like business. Let our farmers,
then, come in on Friday and see for them
selves, and not only farmers, but all classes
of our citizens.
The object of the association is to seek out
ways and means to add to the general wealth
of our county. To do this it proposes to de
velope our resources in every practicable teat/.
Discussion must of course precede actioo,and
hence the preliminaries are to investigate and
report upon, to present and consider, all tbo
various projects for promoting our county in>
terest'. And indeed we imagine that the
mero physical good of our people will not alone
bo considered. There are evils groater than
poverty that need to be gotten rid of; and
philanthropy could seek nothing more worthy
of its best efforts, than how to give employ
ment to those of us who for the want of it,
must perforce grow into evil ways. For in
stance, where this side of tho Cannibal islands
is missionary labor more needed, than in cer
tain mountain regions of our county ! And
what missionary would be as efScient as he
who would employ the people living there in
gathering the rich treasures that may be found
in the forests and caverns of our beautiful
mountains !
FUNERAL OF HORACE GREELEY.
Tbe funeral of Horace Greeley took plnoo
in New York on Wednesday last, and is said
to have been the most imposing ever accorded
a privato citizen in this country. President
Grant, Senator Henry Wilson, Minister Wash
burne, Secretary of War Belknap, Senator
Carl Schurz, Lyman Tremaiuo, Vice-Presi
dent Colfax, Postmaster General Creswell,
General Dix, Governor Morgan, General
Sheridan, Governor llandolph, of Now Jer*
soy, and other men of noto were present.?
The corpse was borne by ten men ; next came
the clergy, mourners and then the Tribune
Association; next the Ilerald Club ; then fol>
lowed in succession military and civio officers
of tbe United States, located in this and ad
joining cities ; officers of the government of
the Slate of New York and of other States,
now in this city ; the Mayors and members
of tho Comniou Councils of Brooklyn,.Tersey
City, Long Island City, Newark, Paterson,
Elizabeth ; representatives from Philadelphia,
Baltimore and other cities ; then came judges
from all tho court*, aud a line of citizens of
immense length.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
As a matter of record, and in order that
all of our subscribers may have the benefit of
perusing the document and forming their own
judgment in regard to its merits and demerits,
we lay before our readers in this issue of the
Spirit, the President's message in full.
In this message, says the New York World,
President Grant makes many recommenda
tions, but they relate mainly to gathering up
the tail ends of spent questions. The emerg
ing, rising future has not dawned upon his
obtuse mind. Ho has not the foresight to sow,
ha has not the vigor to reap ; ho merely fol
lows as a gleaner behind those who have put
in the seed and gathered the harvest. There
was never before such a collection of the odds
and tail-enda of bygone subjects.

respecting it as a grand holiday of olden times
in Englaud. Its observance is fast dying out,
and ere long it will only linger in a few remote
rural districts. The reader of English his

many folks both old and young in England at
this time. The name has been appropriately
bestowed iipon a young hippopotamus, which
first saw the light in the Zoological Garden,
London, on the 5th inst.': No youngster of
its species has yet been reared in England,

The Congressional Election.
The following is the full text of Senate bill
No. 4, which has wonderfully stirred the ire
of the Radical press throughout the State,
and has at least this argument in favor of its
passage :
A Bill to extend the timo for ascertaining
and certifying the result of the election
held on the twenty-fourth day of October,
1872, for Representatives in the Congress
of the United States.
Whereas, It has been represented to the
Legislature that in some of the counties of
this State the Supervisors have failed or re
fused to ascertaion the result of the election
held on the twenty-fourth day of October,
1872, for Representatives in the Congress of
the United States, and to certify the same as
required by law ; therefore.
Be it enactcd by the Legislature of ITfst
Vinjinia :
That in any county of this State in which
the result of the election for Representatives
in the Congress of the United States, held
on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1872,
has not been ascertained and determined by
j the supervisors thereof, according to the Code
of West Virginia, it shall be the duty of the
I supervisors of such oouDty, to meet at tho
court house thereof on or before the first d?y
of December, 1872, and carefully and im
partially ascertain the result of said election,
and prepare and transmit to the Governor of
the State certificates thereof, in all respects
according to the provisions of said third chap
ter of the Code; and the Governor shall there
upon ascertain who were elected for Repre
sentatives in the Congress of the United
States at said election, and make proclamation
thereof in the same manner and with like ef
fect as if the result of said election had been
ascertained and certified by the supervisors of
tho several counties within tho timo hereto
fore prescribed by law.
2. Any Supervisor who shall, without suf
ficient cause, fail or refuse to perform any of
the duties required by the preceding section,
shall, in addition to any penalties which he
may have already incurred, bo deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor, and. upon conviction, shall
be fined not less than fifty nor more than two
hundred dollars.
3. This act shall bo in force from and after

Committee.
New York. December 3 ?The national
democratic committee have'issued the follow
ing :
Ueartqiinrtrrs National Drmnrrnfic Cnm
viitter., Now York December 3, 1S72.?The
democratic national convention did, i.i July,
1872. with nn unanimity unprecedented in
the history of the party, nominated as their
candidate for the office of President of tho
United States Horace Greeley, of New York.
Six States cast their electoral vote for him at
the Inte eleotion, and millions of men in the
other States where we failed of success testi
fied their appreciation of his noble character
and the cjre.it services ho had rendered tho
country by voting our electoral ticket.
But Horace Greeley is dead, and the splen
dor of the political victory achieved by his
opponents is now diminished by sorrow which
this sad event has cast upon the people whom
he loved, and who regarded him as one of
the best, truest and bravest of men. The les
sons of his pare and blameless life wiil long
remain impressed upon the age in which he
lived. ?
Every beat of his great heart was in sym
pnthy with humanity in its broadest form.?
He loved the government, he loved his fel
low-men, and tho labors of his whole life were
to elevate the condition of making. No
struggle for liberty, oivil or religious, was
ever made on the surface of tho earth since
his manhood began with whioh he did not
affectionately sympathize, and to which he
failcjl to give faithful and powerful aid.?
Every day of his life abounded with acts of
kindness, of charity, of forgiveness and love
Not his stricken family alone, but a stricken
people sorrow for a loss so wholly inscrutable
and almost unparalleled.
The national democratic committee, in be
half of a great party, who achieved honor by
their faithful effort to elect him to the first
office in the government, will do all in thoir
power to honor his name and memory.
Augustus Schei.l.
