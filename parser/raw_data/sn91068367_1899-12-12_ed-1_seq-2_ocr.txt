THE MVELMINGTON MESSENGER, TTJESD.
, DECEMBER 12, 1899.

SOME POINTS IN THE MESSAGE.
In a rapid view of the message it was
stated that certain points might be
noticed from time to time. It was bo
long and so full of points one survey
could only grasp a pointhere and there.
The more it is considered the more ob
noxious to Just criticism it appears.
The president i3 an artful dodger, and
shows adroitness in both avoidance and
advocacy of pet plans and theories.
For Instance, he is known to have been
the extrefnest of extreme high protec
tion advocates, but he does not con
sider the present awful, most radical
of robber' tariffs or hint even at a re
auction. It is true that some eight or
ten months ago at Boston he made re
marks that looked favorable to a lower
tariff tax schedule, but he has evident
y bobbed back to his old love and is
wrapped now in burning affection.
Then again the great high tariff ad
vocate while saying much about trusts,
and really in places writes as if they
were ver,y bad things for the country,
makes no practical suggestion as to a
remedy. We said we suspected sincer
ity on the part of republicans when
th?y talked or wrote against trusts,
th natural outgrowth of their darling
p t, a high tariff tax that oppressed
Borne 7,000,000 for the benefit of 2,000,000
Oi ;J,000,000 prosperous, even rich benefi
cl iiies who so greatly flourish under
tl ; bounties granted under a robber
tii a, that is alike unrigheousness,
uiijust and unconstituional. How can
ai y honest, sensible, informed, obser
vant man repose the slightest confi
dence in a party that for thirty years
hus been plundering the country, op
pressing the poor, outraging justice
and common sense and been faithless
and graceless in a thousand political
acts? They have laid their great
greedy hands upon the pockets of the
millions of toilers and bread-winners,
and their legislation has been in the
interest of the rich and the upbuilding
of a stupendous autocracy and pluto
cracy. Said Depew in 1896, "I can name
ten men in a circuit of ten miles around
New York City who can precipitate in
one hour the greatest panic the world
has ever known. They can stop every
wheel of industry at once." The pos
sibility of such a statement lies in the
fact that his party has steadfastly leg
islated to that end through three de
cades of dishonest and oppressive gov
ernment. We are not singular in such
a view. It prevails widely among
thinking, reading, observing people all
over the land. The able Charleston
News and Courier makes this just re
flection upon one point raised by the
president that of trusts and com
bines: "The trusts anl combinations which
have led to the restraint of trade, and
confined the . benefits resulting from
class and sectional legislation to spe
cial industries and selected communi
ties, are all .the legitimate outcome of
republican policies, which Mr. McKin
ley so well represents. We have no
wish, however, 'to judge tthe president
harshly his message speaks for i'tself
and, while its glowing periods will
doubtless appeal to the emotionally in
clined, in our opinion the whole pur
pose of the message will be condemned
by the sober-minded, and those who
have a care for the integrity of our re
public." It is noticeable that McKinley is
more guarded, more reticent in what he
says of trusts than his vicious, leprous
Man Friday was in the Ohio cam
paign. Mark Hanna stood forth cham
pioning trusts, and he was the light
man to favor so detestable and flagiti
ous a combine known familiarly as
trusts. Mark was doing a proper work
representative of his beastly, depraved
character. McKinley really writes as
if he was out of touch with his cor
rupt henchman for he says that if "the
present law can be extended more cer
tainly to control or check these mono
polies, or trusts, it should be done with
out delay." But he offers no remedy.
He is like an empiric in medicine who
visits the patient, feels pulse and skin
looks at the tongue and takes the tem
perature, talks with Solomonic preci
sion in general platitudes, and yet of
fers no relief, prescribes no remedy.
If the patient is suffering and some
remedy known to the household as
possibly efficacious under certain con
ditions can be found, let it be-applied
at once, and then comes "the good
morning" farewell and out goes the
pretender. Dr. McKinley thinks the
great American people (the patient)
are afflicted and sick perhaps, and yet
he offers no restorative, but contents
himself by referring the case to the
American congress, that may be as full
of quackery as himself and equally in
competent. Dr. McKinley has no con
fidence in the skill or sincerity of his
brother political doctors in the con
gress. As to Philippine matters, we had
more to say on Wednesday than of
other points.
The president cannot evade hi3 re
sponsibility in precipitating a war
t against a very weak, impotent people,
'' that he professes to believe belong to
the great United States by purchase
at the price of two dollars per head.
He labors hard to create a plea in just
ification of his usurpation of power as
well as his brutalities enforced at the
cannon's mouth. There is no doubt
that the congress did not expect any
such game to be played as he has play
ed, or it would have been grossly re
creant if it had not taken decided
steps ,to prevent the presidential esca
pade. His plea, specious and mislead
ing, that the Filipinos were entirely
favorable to the $2 a head sale is not
according to facts. They were not al
lowed and say in the matter. The News
and Courier intelligently and cor
rectly says of McKinley's plea of Justi
fication that it cannot be true "in view
of the fact that no means whatever
had ever been employed by the United
States goverrunent to ascertain the
wishes of the people of those islands,
the Intimate associations o fthe repre
sentatives of the United States gov
ernment having been almost entirely
confined to the representatives of the
Philippine people who were engaged in
a war for independence against the
government of Spain. The president's
denial of Aguinaldo's claim that he
was promised independence by any of
ficer of the United States in return for
his assistance is not warranted by
facts, and does not agree with the
statements which were made by the
official representatives o the United
States before this government had em-
"barked upon the policy of blood and
desolation in the Philippine Islands.
All the excuses that can be made now
will not'rub out the record of the Unit
ed States in that country?'
The responsibility of war rests upon
the action of the president, and he de
serves the censure of every true man
and real patriot for his usurping con
duct. We agree with our Charleston
contemporary that it ia a question for
investigation that the congress "ought
to inquire why the president assumed
the sole prerogative of that body in
engaging in a war without its author
ity. There has no been a time Once
the first guns were fired at Manila,
when the president could not have
called the congress together and re
ferred this whole question to that
body for settlement. He cannot share
his present responsibility with con
gress, and he cannot escape the enor
mity of the offence which he has com
mitted." The little fellow must bear
his own burden of censure and walk
the burning marl alone and unshel
tered. CAUSES OF THE liKTTMU PRICES
FOU COTTON'.
The newspapers and cotton guessers
have tried their hand to fix the
size of the crop. Now tthey are
discussing the reason of the advance in
cotton in the last few months. If one
were to go to guessing as to the rea
sons why ,he might content himself
with the old rule of political economy
that never fails, that of supply and de
mand. Since 1870, we have tried to
write scores of columns upon over
production in cotton. Twenty years
ago the smallest crop produced more
money than the large crop of
years produced. In recent years too
much cotton has been grown for the
world's consumption. The result has
been low prices, ruinous prices to a
great many deserving farmers. The
crop is much below expectations.
Whatever the precise number of bales
it is known that the crop is short by
some millions of bales. In the last
three months the visible crop is over
a million bales below what it was a
year ago. The decrease is said to be
18 per cent. It is also thought that the
crop will be 1,500,000 below what the
demand will be. If that is so, then the
cause of increase is patent. The Hous
ton (Texas) Post, an able exchange,
says that from "September until Jan
uary the visible supply usually in
creases rapidly, but for the past few
weeks the amount marketed has been
only a few thousand bales ahead of
the world's consumption. During the
past week, for instance, the supply only
increased 22,000 bales, while for the
same period last year 272,000 bales were
added to the world's stock of the
staple."
All southerners must rejoice in the
advance in cotton. It means a great
many tens of millions of dollars to the
southern people above what the old
low prices gave. North Carolina in
creases its crop of cotton, and an in
crease of 2 or 3 cents a pound puts
thousands of money in the pockets of
our farmers. It means more facto
ries and more prosperity. But be
guarded ait one point. If the pres
ent remunerative price of cotton
should cause the planters to lose
their heads and pitch a tremen
ous crop for 1900, and if matured
should reach 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 or
more even, then what? The farmers
would "hear something drop," and it
would be the price of cotton. The law
of supply and demand never fails, it
is infallible. Make too much cotton
and down will go the price and per
haps to the low prices of recent years.
Be warned in time. If a great crop is
planted, it is planted for five or six
cents a pound. An increase of $10 or
$12 a bale is very alluring. Be not de
ceived. It is very certain that the
grasping, rascally trusts have had
nothing to do with the rise in the price
of cotton.
HOME FOLKS.
If possible the proposed $20,000 appro
priation for the Cape Fear above this
city should be increased as that sum
would be insufficient to accomplish the
purpose indicated. It might be enough
for a year, but the necessary sum
might be hereafter withheld. It will be
better to begin with $50,000, and take
chances of securing more as the work
progresses and the actual need appears.
It will take no little money to carry
out all the improvement from here to
Fayetteville that are needed.
A correspondent of the Raleigh Post
at Washington, N. C, writes of a visit
of Bishop Watson of this town. He
says:
"He made his annual visitation and
administered the sacred rite of confir
mation to twelve persons. As usual his
sermon was -beautiful, logical and elo
quent, and the esteem in which he is
held by all denominations was testi
fied to by the large congregation, made
up in part from the other city churches.
Bishop Watson is truly an ideal bishop
and sheperd to his flock, going
through all weather to our scattered
country parishes, ever staying with the
poor of the congregation in preference
to the affluent, thereby gaining a sure
knowledge and understanding of their
needs and desires that would be well
nigh impossible under other circum
stances. He is indeed venerated and
appreciated at his true work."
He is truly "apostolic" in his visits
to the poor rather than to the rich.
He is a faithful worker, now eighty
two year3 of age, and sets the robust,
younger man a noble example of zeal,
devotion, piety and abundant labors.
He is held in high esteem in Wilming
ton by all who know this venerable ser
vant of God.
The negro Methodist conference at
Clinton received a woman into the min
istry, which is "something new under
under the sun" in these parts. A close
study of the New Testament might be
of advantage and prevent mistakes at
that point.
The Charlotte Observer holds that the
Farmer's Alliance as being for the pop
ull3t party. How it is just now we do
not know but awhile back it was
thoroughly' controlled and badly crip
pled in its usefulness by the populists
lead by that flopper and demagogue of
the first water, Marion Butler.
There is a new hero for, North Car-
olina. His, name is Isaac Brock, (born
in Buncombe county on 1st March
1788, now in his 111th year, and said to
be the oldest man in America. He was
born, before the United States hid a
life. He has seen twenty-two $resi
dents elected. He has fought inj four
warsl He shod a horse when 99t He
has been written up in Texas papers.
On 4th December 1898, the Waco Times
Herald had a sketch of him. On 11th
December 1898, the Dallas Moping
News had a more elaborate biogrtphy,
as did also the Chicagp Times-Herald.
He is a worthy citizen of unblemished
name. His old farqily Bible tells his
age. He lived much of his life near
Waco. A sketch before us says: j
"A short time ago by request, ncle
Isaac came to Waco and sat for his
picture. In his hand he held a fstick
cut from the grave of General Andrew
Jackson, which has been carriel by
him ever since. Mr. Brock is a digni
fied old gentleman, showing few pigns
of decrepitnde. His family Bible is
still preserved, and It shows thai the
date of his birth was written 111 jears
ago."
The tobacco growers are "getting
mighty tiied" of being robbed by the
cigarette gang. They mean business,
and we can but hope that some plan,
some measure of relief can be hit upon
that will take their heads out., of the
cigarette trus't noose, and have some
chance for freedom and returning pros
perity. Our Raleigh special of yester
day noting the gathering of the tobac
co growers in that town, gave this:
"The price of tobacco is lower, "vhile
production is smaller, and there ;s no
decrease in demand, so the price does
not follow the usual laws of stpply
and demand."
If all other plans should fail tc put
bits in the mouths of trust fellows,
there is one that cannot fail. Let
every tobacco grower in the south not
grow a plant in two years. Then the
robbers would get faint at heart, and
would open their eyes tc decency and
honesty and right doing. No tobacco
no cigarette product. Ben Duke might
commit harri kari.
We have never favored preventing
railroads from granting passes. It is
really an usurpation of power ttat is
tyrannical and undemocratic. A rail
road is a public carrier but not a pub
lic enemy. It is owned by private cit
izens. They should be able to trans
port any man they choose to transport,
just as any one of the owners might
take a friend to church or court in his
private carriage. It is an abuse of
power to forbid issuing free passes to
friends. The Southern railroad has
been fined $1,000 for giving a free pass.
This is not the first fine paid. The
state supreme court makes the deci
sion. It is a bad law and wrong.
BREVITIES.
It is said by the Charleston News
and Courier that many negroes in that
city are wild with fear believing that
the world will soon end, and about the
Christmas time.
The Denver Evening Post has a poet
who sings of a prevailing style; The
poem opens in this wise:
"Have you seen the jaunty maiden
tripping lightly 'long the street
With an old gray goosequill sticking
in her hat?
She is neat and she is natty and most
ravishingly sweet,
With the old gray goosequill sticking
in, her hat."
That was horrible work out in Ken
tucky, burning a negro to death for
raping and murdering a lady. The
penalty was terrific, the crime was
devilish beyond description.
Senator Harris says that Kansas is
for Bryan. He says he is "absolutely
certain that the unanimous desire of
all those who wish to see successful
co-operation of all the different ele
ments in Kansas opposed to the repub
lican party ,is heartily for the renom
ination of the Hon. W. J. Bryan." Tam
many is for him also, and so is the en
tire s.outh.
Teddy Roosevelt has gone into train
ing In wrestling. He has a tutor.
What's up? Does he anticipate "wah?"
Georgians favor the franchise for ne
groes indefinitely. They do not have
trouble at the polls down there as the
whites are 60,000 in majority, but they
have a great many crimes and rapes,
etc.
John Bright the great English ora
tor, who served so long In parliament
with 'Mr. Gladstone said this as given
by Sir Edward Russell: "He always
spoke of Gladstone's oratory as if it
were on a higher level than his own.
'Oh, it is easy for him,' he would say.
'His mind has everything in it, and
he has only to turn on the steam.' "
Bill Bynum, who deserted the demo
crats in 1896, has been rewarded by
McKinley with an office that pays
$8,000 a year. Traitors from democ
racy are usually well paid. Patterson
in Tennessee, another of the tribe, gets
$3,000 a year salary.
, The New York World prints a big
picture of well named Brigham Rob
erts, his three wives, and their three
homes. The handsomest wife, number
two, has the shabbiest house.

Winston SentLniel: Harry Penn, an
old colored man, was found dead last
night on the Old Town road, beyond
Belo's pond, by a farmer who was com
ing to Winston with a load of tobacco.
It appears that Penn went out yester
day afternoon with a team from the
livery stable and went out in the coun
try. On his return the horses became
frightened and ran away, throwing
him out and (inflicting injuries, which
it is thought, caused instant death. A
large hole was cut in his head. John
Mitchell, who was struck by the shift
ing engine on the N. & W. road, about
12 o'clock yesterday, died about
o'clock this morning at the N. & W.
passenger depot. He never resumed
consciousness.
Charlotte Observer: An unknown
white man was run over by the train
on the Southern yard in Charlotte, last
night, and instantly . killed. His head
was severed from his body; his legs
and one arm were cut off.. It is not
known how the frightful accident oc
curred. About 11 o'clock freight train
No. 56 pulled through the yard, and
it was this train which run over the
man. Mr. John L. Rae, of Provi
dence, and Dr, Fitz, who lives in the
eastern suburbs, were painfully and
it is feared seriously injured last eve
ning by a runaway accident. Physi
cians were summoned. Dr. Fits was
suffering dreadfully with his back, and
Mr. Rae with a dislocated shoulder and
broken arm. Dr. Fitz has been an in
valid for years, which makes his in
juries all tle more serious.
Winston Sentinel: Mr. Wesley Mil
ler, who resides near Styer's Mill, four
teen miles west of Winston, met with
a painful accident last Thursday. He
was out in the woods hauling logs or
wood, when, he was caught between a
tree and the wagon. Thinking there
was no danger, he told his driver to
drive on. The horses moved off and
Mr. Miller's ribs on the left side were
badly mashed. A report received to
day says that Mr. Miller was thought
to be slightly improved, though not
out of danger. We are both glad
and sorry that the University of North
Carolina won the foot ball game in
Atlanta, with the University of Geor
gia. Glad from a state pride stand
point; sorry because of the stimulus
that may be given to the brutal foot
ball business.
