TUKl-ACIKiCATION OF TIIK COUNTUY
continues to be, until it is Hilly accomplish
ed, and must remain tin- in om important of
our iinliimal interests. 'I lit- earnest purpose
ol good ritiu'UB cim-iiilry to unite their
illoils in these endeavors is evident It
found decidid expression in llic resolutions
amiounitd in ib'.O by the national conven
tions of tbi' leading political pailiis of tile
country. 'I line whs. n widespread appre
hension that llic momentous' icsulls in our
progress as a nation, marked by tbu icccnt
amendments to the constitution, were in
imminent jeopardy; tluil llic good under,
standing which prompted their adoption in
tliu interssl of devotion to the general wel
fare, might prove barren truce; and that
the sections of the country once engaged in
civil btrite might be again almost as widely
Severed and disunited as they were when
at rayed in arms against cacli other. The
course to be pursued, in my judgment,
seems wise, and the presence of this emer
gency was plainly indicated in my inau
gural address. It pointed to thctime, wliicli
nil our people desire to sec, when a genuine
loveot our whole country, and all that con
cerns its Ituc welfare, shall supplant Ihe
distinctive force ol mutual animosity of
races hnd of sections. Political opinions
havedtlleicd widely as to the measures
best calculated lo secure this great end.
This was lo be expected. The measures
adopted by the administration have been
subjected to severe ami varied criticism.
Any course whatever which might
have been entered upon would ceitainly
nave encountered uisnust anu opposition.
These measures weie, in my judgment,
nuchas were most iu harmony with tliu
constitution and with the genius of our
pioplc, and best adapted under all the cir
cumstances to attain the end in view. The
beneficent results already appaicnt prove
that these endeavors aie uot lo be regaitled
a nieie experiment, and should sustain
and encourage us in our dibits. Already,
in the brief lime which has elapsed, the
immediate effectiveness, no less than the
justice of Ihe course pursued, is demon
strated, ami I have an abiding faith that
time will furnish its ample vindication.
In tliu mieds of a great majority of my
fellow citizens, the discontinuance of (lie
ai my lor the purpose of upholding loeal
Eovirr.uicnts in two of the states of the
Union was no less a constitutional duty
antlrequitcmtnt, undir tliu circumstance

niiiiburo lor llie restoration oi Iccal self-
rovonment and the promotion of national
harmony. lhewiili(ii.wal ol the troops
ceptingthe nomination for the presidency,
and again upon my inauguration, that the
policy of resumption should be pursued by
every suitable means, and that no legisla
tion would be wise that would disparage
tbe importance or retard Ihe attainment of
that result. I have no disposition and cer.
Utility no right to question the sincerity or
integrity of opposing opinions, and would
neither conceal uor undervalue tbe consid
erable dillieullies, and even occasional dis
tress which may attend the progress of Ihe
nation toward this primary condition
j to its general and peiiiiancnt improve-
ment and prosperity. I must, how.
i ever, adhere to my most earnest convic
i Hon thai any wavering of purpo-e, or
t unsteadiness in the methods of reducing tbe
i inconvenience inseparable from a transition
Hem an irrutci-mabli' to a redeemable cur
rency, would only lend lo increased and
pioionged distui banec in values, and unless
lelteved, must end in serious disorder, dis
honor and disaster in the financial ullairs
of the government and of the people. The
mischief which I apprehend and earnestly
ocprecaie, are, conuued lo no one class ol
the people, but seem lo me most certainly
lo threaten the industrious masses, whether
their occupations are of skilled or common
labor. To ihein, it seems to me, it is of
prime importance that their labor should
be compensated in money which is itself
fixed in exchangeable value, by beiug irre
vocably measured by the labor necessary
lo its production. 1 his permanent equality
of the money" of the people is sought for
and can ouly be gained by the resumption
of speeie payments.
Tiie rich, the speculating, the operating,
llic moneylealing(classes, may not always
feel the mischief, or may find considerable
profit in a variable currency, but the mis
fortunes of such a currency to those who
are paid salaries or wages, are inevitable
and remediless.
Closely connected with this general sub
ject ol'the resumption of specie payment,
is one subordinate but still of grave impor
tance. I mean ihe

is only the ceitain, plain and piactical Iraits
of such legislatiou that 1 desiie to recom
mend to j our attention. In any legislation
piowding lor a siher coinage-, legulaliug
its value i nd imparting to it the quality of
legal tender, it seems lo me of great impor
tance that congress should not lose sight of
Us action and operation in a twololel ca
pacity in two oislinci diieclions. If ihe
luited States government were free from a
public debt, its legislative dealing with Ihe
subject of eilvtr coinage would be purely
souicign and governmental, under mue
sli hints but lliote ol a constitutional power
the public goe-d as eiiicted by the pic
posed legislation, hut in the aitual cil
ci.mstaiite's ol the nation with a vs.sl public
di bt, distributed very widely r.mong our
own citizens and hilel in gnat amount also
silver coinage of the same denomination,
anil oi a limitation ol the amount lor which
the silver coinage is to be a legal tender,
are essential to maintaining both in circu
lation. If these conditions can be success
fully observed, llic issue from the mint of
silver dollars, would alloul material assist
ance to lie community in redeeming paper
money and would facilitate the rcsumpliou
of specie payment and its permanent estab
lishment. Without these conditions I fear
that only mischief aud mistortune would
follow from a coinage of silver dollars w ilh
the quality of unlimited legal teuder, even
in private transactions. Any cxjuctalion
oftemiKrary ease from an issue of silver
coinage to pass as a legal lender at a rale
materially above its commercial value, is,
I am persuaded, a delusion, nor can I think
there is any stilistaiitial distinction be.
tween an original issue ol silver dob
lars at a nominal value, very materially
above their commercial value, and the
restoration of the silver elollar at a rale
which ouco was, but has ceased to bu ils
commercial value. Certainly llie issue of
our silver coinage, reduced in weight ma
terially below ils legal tender value, would
not bo any the less a picscul debasement of
the coinage by reason of its equaling, or
even exceeding iu weight, a good eoimige,
wliich, at some past tune, had been com.
mcrially equal to the legal tender value
assigned to Hie new issue. In recommend-
ing that the regulation of any sliver coin
age, which may lie authorized by congress.
should observe these conditions of
commercial value, I am governed by the
feeling that every possible increase should
bo given lo llie volume of metallic, money,
which may be kept in circulation, and
thereby every ixissible aid a Horded to the
people in the process of resuming speeie
jmment. It is bee-atie of my conviction
that a disregard of these comiitions would
frustrate the good results which are elesiieei
from the proposed coinage, and embarrass
with new elements ol lonlusion certainly
the business of the country, that I urge
upon jour attention these considerations. 1
icsp.ecltuUy lecommcnd lo congress that
in sny legislation providing for a silver
coinage, and imparling lo it" the quality of
legal tender, Ibeie be lnijnissed on meas
ures a liim pieivision cummins llie nublic

nonce oi us intention. The government
of Italy, vailing itself of this lacilily, has
now given the required notice, and tbu
treaty will acconlinnly end on Ihe 17th of
September, 1878. It is underslooel, how
ever, that lie Italian government wishes to
lenew it in general scoiie, desiring only
certain modifications in some of its articles.
In this disposition I concur, and snail hope
that no serious obstacles may intervene to
prevent or delay tliu negotiation of a satis
factory treaty.
Numerous questions in regard to parties
not naturalized and exempt from mili
tary service, have, continued to arise con
cerning emigrants from Germany, who
have relumed to their country. The pro
visions of the treaty of l'Vbruary 22, IStitJ,
however, have proved to be so ample and
so judicious that Ihe legation of the United
states al Berlin has I iceii able to adjust all
claims arising under it, not only without
detriment to the amicable relations exist
ing between the two governments, but it is
believed without injury or injustice to the
naturalized American citizens. It isdesir
able that ihu treaty originally made vvilh
the North German Union, in 1767, should
now bu altered so us lo i pply to all the
states of the empire of Germany.

The long commercial depression in the

subject of the possible increase of our for

ment, not only with Europe, but with
other countries, especially with the stales
and sovereignties of the western hemi

the question of methods by which they
could bring the respective countries of
their olllcial residence's, and the United
States into closer commercial relations. In
obedience to these instructions, examina

been made by these ollicers and transmit

total expenditures for the same period
were $i5S,liCi),0O3.1W, leaving a surplus

the legislative and executive departments

purpose indicatid belore my accession to
othce, I indtavoicil to have my own
views distit.ctly understood, and upon my
iuauguiation, my accord with the public
opinion was stated in leims lelieved lo le
plain and unimbipuous. Jly experience
in the exicutive (Units has strongly eon
filmed my belief in the great advantage
the country' would find in observing sii icily
the plan ol llie constitution which imposes
upon the exicutive the sole duly and re
sponsibility of the selection of the federal
ulhciTs, who, by law, are appointed, but
not elected, and which, in a like manner,
asisgns to the senate the complete right
lo advise and consent to or reject the num.
inalions so made-, whilst the house of repre
sentatives stands as the censor of Ihe per
foimance of official duties, with the pre
rogative ol investigation, aud providinc for
all cases of direlection. The fell-meshi-s i
and imperfections in the civil service may,
as I think, be traced, in most cases, lo a
perfect confusion of the duties aissigued lo
Ihe several departments of the government.
My purpose, in this respect, has been to
reiuin to the system established by the
fundamental law, and to do this with llie
hearty cooperation and the most cordial
understanding with the senate and house of
representatives. The practical difficulties
in the selection of the numerous ollicers
for posts of widely varying responsibilities
and duties are acknowledged to be very
great. No system can be expected to se
cure absolute freedom from mistakes, and
tliu beginning of an attempted change of
custom is quite likely to be more embar
rassed in tins re$iecl than al at any subse
quent period, llis here that the coiistitu.

the great wisdom accorded to it. It

nominations on wliich they may be
disiulereoteel and impartial judges, secures
as strong a guaranty of freedom from er

iu human airairs. In addition to ibis, I
lecognizo the public advantage of making
all nominations, as nearly as possible, on
personal knowledge, in tliu sense of being
live from mere caprice or favor. In lliese
directions and in those offices w Inch special
training is of greatly increased value, 1

the renewed attention of congress lo what
has already been done by the civil service
commission, appointed in pursuance of the
act of congress by my predecessor, to prepare
anu revise the civil service rules, in regard
to much of the departmental service espe
cially at Washington. It may be difficult
to organize a better system than that which
has thus been provided, and it is now be
ing used to a considerable extent under my
direction. The commission has a still legal
existence, although for several years no ai
propnalion has been made for defraying ils
expenses. Believing that this commission
has rendered valuable service In improving
the administration of the civil service, I
recommend that a suitable appropriation
be made to enable it lo continue its services.

MEXICO.
The revolution which recently occurred
in ilexico, was followed ly Ihe accession
of the successful parly to power, and the
installation ol its chief, Gin. Diaz, in the
presidential office. It has bi-in the custom
ot the United Slates, when such changes of
government i ave Heretofore occurred in
Mexico, lo recocni7e and enter into offi
cial relations with the de facto government
so soon as it should appear lo have the ap
proval ef the .Mexican people, and should
manifest a disposition to adhere to the ol
Iigations of treaties and international
friendship. In the present case such olll
cial recognition has been delayed by occur
rences on llie llio Grande bonier the
records of wliich have already been com
municated to each house ol congress, in
answer to their recent resolutions of in
quiry. Assurances have been received that
the authorities at the seat of the Mexican
government have both the disposition and
the power to prevent and punish such un
lawful invasions and depredation. It is
earnestly hoped that events may prove the
assurances to be well founded. 'Ihe best
in teres ta of both countries require Ihe
maintainance of peace on the bonier, and
llie development of commerce between the
two republics. It is gratifying to add that
this temporary interruption of official re
lations has not prevented due attention by
llic representatives ot tlie tinted btales ut
Mexico, to the protection of American citi
zens as far as practicable. Nor has it in
terfered with the prompt payment of the
amounts due from Mexico to the United
States under the treaty of July 4th, 1802,
and awards of Ihe joint commission.
While I do not anticipate an interruption
of friendly relations with Mexico, yet I can
not but look with some solicitude upon a
centinuancu of tlic Inntler disorders, as
inspiring the two countries to emotions of
popular feeling and mischances of action
wliich arc naturally unfavorable to com
plete amity. Firmly determined that
nothing shall be wanting on my part to
promote a good understanding between the
two nations, yet I must ask the attention of
congress to actual occurrences on the bor-.
der, that the lives and properly of our citi
zens may be adequately protected, and
peace preserved.

Another year has passed without bring
ing to a close the protracted contest between
Ihe Spanish government and the insurrec
tionists in the island of Cuba. While the
United Suites h ive seduously atist.iincd
from intervention in Ihe controversy, it is
impossible not to feci that it is attended by
incidents affecting our citizens. Ap-irt
from the efiect of hostilities upon trade be-
iween us anil uuua, their progress is mevi
Uibly accompanied by complaints, having
more or le-ss foundation, of searches, arrests,
embargoes anil oppressive taxes upon the
property of American residents, and unpro
voked interference with American vessels
and commerce. It is due to the government
of Spain to say that during the past vear it
has promptly Jisavoweel and offeree! repa.
ration for any unauthorized acts of unduly
zealous subordinates, whenever such acts
have been brought to its attention. Never
theless, such occurrences cannot but tend to
excite a feeling of annoyance, suspicion and
resentment, which are greatly to be depre
cated, between the respective subjects and
citizens of two friendly powers.
VENEZUELA AWARD.
Much delay, consequent upon accusations
of fraud in some of the award, has occur
red in respect to the distribution ot the
limited amount due from Venezuela under
llie treaty of April 25th, wliich is applicable
to the awarels of the joint commission cre
ated by that treaty. So long as these mat
ters are pending, congress or the executive
cannot assume either to pass upon the
question presented, or distribute the funds
received. It is eminently desirable that
definite legislative action should be taken,
