Tttf rrh HnPiit of Libert
I any anarchist think he ought
to ponder on the suggestive utter
ances of the Presidents message in
which lie poluta out the cliaraeter anJ
Luiikeqitrneea of the crime of anarcliv
n anarchist in one who seeks lib
er v through disorder The retifton
hi U readier this conclusion it itself
disordered and he who argues thus
5- josbessel of an insane delusion
There is no liberty worth having- ex
cept ordered liberty the kind of Iili
trt expressed in Tennysons verse
ci h brating the land
J MIW coverniWDt
A land of jlMt and old renown
Where freedom slowly broadens down
From precedent to precedent
Tlie common thought of sane minds
Mi- manifested by ivliit the lresiilent
calls a ftim commentary upon the
foilj of the anarchist the interven
tion of the laws at which Mr McKin
levV assabvin had struck for his pro
tection from the enraged people
whom lie jiretenued to wne The
people knew that lie was striking- at
the symbol of the liw which made
them free
If any anarchist can rellect let him
reflect on the Presidents statement-
which is absolutely i ound that the
Miccess of anarehv would result in
loss of liberty for the essential law
would in self defence be obliged to
str igthen and give harshness to the
forces of order
V striking illustration of this is
the quick response of the civilied
world to the Presidents suggestion
that anarchy be made a crime against
international law- like piracy The
aassination of 3Ir McKiuley is like
lv to make anarchistic assassinations
speeches and writings a crime
against the law of all civilized coun
tries Anarchy is the deadliest ciemy
of liberty
Onr PorelKii Irlrinl
Among the most striking manifes
tations of the larger place we are
holding in the worlds esteem is the
universal interest oclted by tlie
Presidents message
The war with Spiin was a little war
and quickly done for but it attracted
attention to our possession of some
eiifriging international traits which
threat LlriUiin was quickest to recog
nise and to some formidable quali
ties to which other Powers are mani
festing respect
since the war of 1812 the United
States has been a Power to be reck
oned with We have had a large and
a fine influence in the world and that
influence lias usually been exerted for
the amelioration of hard conditions
for the elevation of mankind and for
the promotion of peace During tliese
narlv ninety jears no European
Power would Jiave lightly entered
into war with us
What difference then is tliere on
nceouit of the Spanish war Largely
in the matter of outward respect
and in the treatment of our interna
tional principles Most of the foreign
iiwspapers liked to ignore us Most
of them did not know that our Pres
idents wrote messages JCearly all
effected to contemn us and about all
gave us the impression that they were
alllicted with bad manners
Tliis is changed A marked cour
ier prevails in our international re
lations This ought not to change our
ovn attitude but it is Fomething to
rejoice over for good manners breed
good feeling and good feeling makes
for peace therefore the compliments

ontli African HorrorH
new thing has come out of South
Africa Miss irobhouse the lady who
has given to tlie press the most pic
turesque details of misery in the
Uoer concentration camps lias been
deported It may be that Miss llob
house did good work during Iier visit
to South frica but laymen and
en who have never had any
nee of the serious suffering and
horrible devastation of war are likely
to prove harmful agents at a time of
uethe hostilities Miss llobhouse
from her lights may be perfectly
sincere and honest but to judge of
conditions dependent upon war it
is necessnrv that the audit should
be one accustomed to the sights and
scenes of war The horror of the
battlefield of a countrj stricken by
war of the lone woin ii and chil
dren left on ilevtisUteil territory is
one tJiit a isitor used to the ltivuii
ous comfort of a modern city cannot
appreciite and cannot understand
Miss llobhouse may be and prob
ably is nHolutelv honest in her esti
mate of the misery existing in South
Africa bit her estimate is an esti
mate devoid of a standard She has
described sorrows wjiicli can be seen
on nn street of any town in am
countr A djing babjiii Fifth Ave
nue or in Avenue A is as pathetic to
the person who has not seen one as
in a concentration camp on the South
Afiieau veldt
In the davs before the foundation
of concentration camps befoie Miss
llobhouse had ever visited South
Africa theie were widowed women
and orplnned children within the
lloer lines in South Africa They
vveie destitute of the means of sup
port The Uoer Government granted
them no relief no medicine no medi
cal attendance Their lot was in
finitely worse than that of the
Uoer women in tlie Uritish concentra
tion camps i
The winter sportsman continues
to get tangled in fences and bushes
with serious or fatal results And
his friends continue to hold indigna
tion meetings anent the brutality of
football
Mrs Carrie Nations offer to elim
inate the cafe in Paris has failed to
result in a free trip to Kurope
Aguinaldos continued plotting
after his oath of allegiance has de
stroyed every vestige of sympathy
for liim A change of islands might
not benefit liim but would be quite
likely to prove advantageous to the
American cause in the Philippines
Aguinaldo appears to be a conspira
tor without a conscience If he the
alleged highest type of the native
will resort to trickery after a solemn
oath of fealty the Tagals are a
hard proposition Confidence in them
would appear to be wasted and to
trust them in any place of power or
responsibility absolutely suicidal
Owing to the removal of certain
individuals from CongreBs there is
little prospect that tlie Congres
sional Kecord will be jellow at this

A Marj land man has been attacked

Are XVe Creditor of Debtor t
The financial editor of the Londo t
Times savs that this country is still
a debtor nation that we have bor
rowed a good deal of money for the
perfecting of our consolidation
schemes and tliat though we owe
lcs abroad than we did the balance
is not jet on our side of the ledger
and will not be for many 3 ears to
come
It is impossible to say that this Is
not true but there is nothing alarm
ing in the fact if it be a fact Ac
cording to the published statistics
the number of undisclosed items in
our international account must be
enormous In the ten years ended
June 30 J901 this country sold abroad
products of its own exceeding in
v il le the foreign goods it puichased
b about SV OOOOOOOO Now business
balances arc settled a least annually
If there were no transactions be
tween this country and foreign coun
tries but plain merchandising tlie ex
cesses of our imports of gold for
these ten jears should have equaled
the excesses of our exports of goods
As a matter of fact tlie excess of our
inports of gold for tills period was
Mil aout 16000000 so that on the
face of tlie public bocks Kurope
owes us on ten years of trade more
than
Hut tills is absurd 1urope lias
been paving us in a hundred ways
which are not chronicled in ofllcial
statistics in enjoyment of travel in
at least one steamship line and tliere
must lc a large absorption of our ex
cess of exports in pying debts and
Interest We doubt ir the London

else can state the international ac
count accurate v

Til 8 TIMES WASHINGTON JRiPAY DECEMBER G 1901
PERSONAL -
Prncticlnir latvr lit the Woit
To hear the reminiscences or two such
men as Senator Clark of WjDmtng and
Judge D A Holmes of Chicago erst
while law partner of Senator Mason Is
worth an mans while They were talk
ing In the lobby of the RSggs of tho days
whea both wire struggling oung lawyers
the Senator out la Wyoming and the
Judge In Northwestern Neuraska at a
lime when Doc Middleton and Kid
Wade were at the head of organized bands
of horse thieves
Just as I got located said the Sena
tor there came en an election for prose
cuting attornev and the candidate who
won had never studied or practiced the
law Like necessity be knew no law
He sent for me having observed my re
cent shingle and remarked that hed like
to engage me to run the office for him
franklv admitting that as far as Knowl
edge of drawing an Indictment was con
cerned his mind was a howling wilder
ness I asked him why In thunder he
ran for the place and ho Ingenuously
owned that he had a grudge against the
white haired that was lo
cated up the street and when he tri
umphed over him his rev ease was com
plete Ills campaign expenses had ag
gregated S and If Id reimburse him to
that eMent all the future emoluments of
the oflien were mine We closed the deal
and I stepped Into a flourishing business
at once
My debut In the profession was greatly
like the Senators remarked Judge
Holmes The prosecuting attorney who
put me to work for him knew how to
draw an Indictment but he got me to fix
up a batch of them against the most les
pcrate lot of villains and cutthroats that
ever disgraced tho country I was young
and verdant and drew up the papers with
thoughts of futuie glory My prlnclral
who was a giant physically claimed he
was too III to attend to the matter
though I found out later that he never
had a sick day In his life Court came on
and I naturally supposed he would glvo
personal attention to tho prosecution of
the outlaws I said as much to him but
he stopped me Imnicdlatel Not If 1
know mvself Its your business Holmes
jou Indicted those devils and Ill be
hanged if jou dont try the cases
A Itctleent ltepreentiitle
With an air of gloom on his face Hon
J Wesley Gaines of Tennessee sat in
the lobby of the Fairfax and talked guard
edly concerning his recent trip to the
Philippine Islands It may bo that the
fearful ocean perils he encountered and
the narrow escapes ho had on tho Sheri
dan and the Warren are main factors in
the suppression of the exuberant spirits
and readj flow of talk that of yore char
acterized the gentleman who represents
the famous Old Hickory district of tho
Voluateer State If Congress can only
coau him out ot his reticeace It will be
fortunate for the couatry for It will then
get the real facts In the way of Informa
tlon touching our island possessions
I dont wish to be latervlewed about
my trip said Mr Gaines because there
aic many things Ive got to study out
and mature an opinion about By the
way I made a speech over there that
seemed to please the natives greatly and
they voted me thanks for my address The
situation Is very complex and I took co
pious notes Hut this thing of circum
navigating the globe Is terrible And
with a deep sigh the gentleman from
Nashvlle withdrew
A Change ot Sentiment
If I had known the depth of the bit
terness against the national Republican
iet that existed in Denver in 19G I
never would have driven out In my car
lLtce along the principal avenues and
sticts on election day with McKlnley
lkrrs attached to my horses said Col
George W Cook a prominent citizen ot
tho Colorado Capital who Is stopping at
the Normandlc
It was this way Although I owned and
worked several silver mines my Republi
canism was paramount and I thought Id
show that there was at least one man in
Denver who wasnt afraid to fly his colors
But I never quite counted en raising such
a racket as my appearance that afternoon
precipitated A mob that easily number
ed GOO men and boys followed mo with
shouts and Imprecations and threats cf
personal violence As I paid no attention
to their Insults they resorted to throw
ing missiles and a lump of coal cut a
painful gash In my head This angered
me and going home I got out my Win
chester and ordered my servant to drive
me back down town against the entreaties
of my wife The mob started after me
again but they could not help seeing that
Winchester and perhaps buspectcd that
my carrying It was not Intended as a
joko At all events tho crowd melted
away and I went home later without mo
lestation
Just four years later there was an
other election in Denver Wondering as
to the changes time had wrought I got
Into the Identical rig in which I had rid
den In 1S96 and was driven along the
same thoroughfares by the same colored
boy The samo McKlnley flags were on
my horses but this time they created no
public Irritation only laughter and ap
plauso on the part of many citizens who
remembered the rough treatment given me

TRIBUTES TO McKINLEYS FAME
The Tvrn Vlriuorliil frojrili to He
XJIisciikhimI Ilcrt
The two projects for the erection of
national memorials to the late President
McKlnley an arch In this city and a
monument at Canton will be the subject
of a conference In this elly tomorrow
between the promoters of the two asso
ciatons
Mich Interest Is being shown in tho
outcome of the meeting and the hope Is
gcnerallj expressed that such an agree
ment will bo roached as will assure tl 0
success of both undertakings A large at
tendance of members of each association
Is expected at the conference which will
be held nt tho Arlington
Those who are Interested In the McKln
ley National Memorial Arch Association
advance the claim that the Capital of tho
natiou as the mccca of all patriotic citi
zens should be the site of the first and
chief memorial to the late head of tho
General Government As President Mc
Klnleys services were given for the whole
nation and not for any local section the
national arch committee members are
firm In their opinion that the recognition
of such services should be made at the
place where they were rendered with such
conspicuous success
Tho deslro of the people of Canton to
honor the memory of their distinguished
fellow citizen Is well appreciated and cor
dially approved here but It Is not rcgird
ed as of equal national character with
the proposed memorial at the Capital of
tho country Comparatively few people
It Is believed would ever find It conveni
ent to make a trip to Canton for the solo
purpose of vIoAing a monument how
ever grand but the thousands of visitors
who annaally Journey here would find a
McKlnley arch of equal If not greater In
terest with the Washington monument
The claims of Canton on the ground that
the Ohio city was the late Presidents
home town will be fully set forth by the
board ot trustees of the monument asso
ciation A meeting will be held in this
city prior to the coafcrcnce with the exec
utive committee of the arch association
and with two or three exceptions every
member of the board Is expected to be in
attendance
The correspondence between Senator
Hanna for the monument plan and Com
missioner Macfarland in behalf cf the
arch project will be laid before the trus
tees for their final action before going
Into conference The extent to which the
trustees will be willing to recede from
their present position will there be de
termined for It is well 1 nderstood now in
both o janlzation3 that each side must
make some concessions to the other If an
agreement of any sort Is to be reached
It Is not thought likely that either ps
soclatlon each organized with the same
laudable purpose will care to antagonize
disinterested persons In all paits of th9
couatry by refusing to be liberal In com
ing to a mutual understanding for the de
velopment of a common plan of action
Ryerson Ritchie secretary of the Can
ton Monument Association left Cleve
land last night for this city to attend the
meeting of tho board of trustees here to
morrow Regarding probable develop
ments he said-
A committee recently appointed 13 ex
pected to appear before the trustees and
advocate a union of forcei if not a con
solidation of their association with tho
McKlnley National Memorial Arch As
sociation It is well known that the
trustees of the Monument Association are
uncompromising In their attitude on thl3
subject They believe that the people of
the country prefer to honor William Mc
Klnley by the erection of a memorial at
his grave In Canton Atter this Is done
tho proposition to erect a lultablo
memorial at the National Capital may
be taken up as provided by resolution of
the trustees who intend to use any sur
plus funds for that purpose
Several men of national distinction
will bo added to the board of trustees
a3 honorary members and reports show
ing the progress ot organization through
out tho entire country will be recelvd
With two exceptions the Governors of
all the Sutes and Territories have al
ready accepted election as honorary
members Governor elect Franklin Mur
phy of New Jersey was In Canton jes

INDIANS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
Pleased With Presidents Remarks
Aliout Itctl Men ns Hough Hitlers
Tho stolid faces of five big Ute Indians
from the Uintah Reservation In Utah
lighted up yesterday at the White House
when their Interpreter told them that the
President had said that he had fifty In
dians in his regiment of Rough Rlder3
during the Spanish American war and
that they were crackerjacks The
braves who are at Washington to look
after certain Interests connected with
their lands were evidently greatly pleased
that tl e President should thus rank their
kinsmen with tho rest of his valorous
command
The Indians were escorted to the White
House by II P Mvnter their agent They
waited for a considerable time in tho ante
room but were finally ushered iato the
President s office He extended to each of
them as they were presented a most cor
dial welcome but his words seemed to
have little effect upon the compoauro of
tho Utcs
Turning to the Interpreter the Presi
dent asked blm to tell the Indians that he
had fifty of their people In bis regiment
and they were crackerjacks And It
was In the outer ball when the Inter
preter explained to them the Presidents
words that the Indians first gave evi

The Cuban Economic Commission under
the guidance of Its counsel State Senator
Pavey of New York called at the War
Department again yesterday to pay Its re
spects to Adjutant General Corbin
Incidentally the commissioners met Sen
ator Hanna and Senator Foraker and did
not fall to talk to them about reciprocity
with Cuba
Senator Hanna asked a number of ques
tions and assured the commissioners that
he was firmly of the opinion that some
form of reciprocity should be adopted to
assist the Cubans Senator Hanna was
anxious to know what the commissioners
would advise In the way of legislation
They argued that the duty on sugar and
tobacco coming into the United States
from Cuba should be reduced but were
not prepared to say Just how this could
be accomplished at this time
The commissioners met Senator Foraker
In the reception room cf the Secretary of
War and upon being presented brought up
the same subject
Senator Foraker assured them of his
sympathy with the general principle that
the duty should be reduced but said he
had not studied the subject enough to say
what reduction he would favor
He explained to the delegates that It
would be a waste of time to argue with
him the question ot a reduction as he was
already convinced tnat something should
be done He too failed to see just how It
will be accomplished
