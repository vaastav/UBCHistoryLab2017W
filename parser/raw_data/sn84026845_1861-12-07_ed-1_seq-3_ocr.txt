gtigy-THEiR Names.?Wo stated yesterday
on the authority of a reliable man that the
two lieutenants recently captured near
Romney, were Singleton and Jones. This
is a mistake. A letter was yesterday re
ceived from Col. Thoburn, stating that the
imprudent lieutenants were Hall, of Capt.
Melvin's company, and Freeman, of Capt.
Stephens' company. They were captured
at a place called French's, about nine miles
from Romney, whilst they were vainly en
deavoring to talk an old woman out of
some butter.
,B&"Mittens for the Soldiers.?Capt.
Milhous, Co. C, 1st V?. Regiment, will
leave about the middle of next week for
Romney. His company is without mit
tens, of which they are very much in need.
He desires that the patriotic ladies of
Wheeling and Martinsville, who wish to
contribute to the comfort of the soldiers
in this respect, shall be notified. Mittens
may be left at Rice's store in Martinsville,
or at the Government store house in this

jggyTHE Campaign in Western Yik
OI.via.?The telegeragh to-day announces
the arrival of General Rosecr?n3 and staff
at Wheeling, which he proposes making his
headquarters during the winter. This
means, of course, that the campaign is over
in Western Virginia, and that winter quar
ter? are the only matters to be attended to
at present. The campaign there has been
a hard one, and our boys will doubtless be
able at the close tff the war, to look back
upon those mountains as the scene of the
most trying experiences of the war. Much
terrible marching and some (rood fighting
has been done over and about the Western
Virginia hills, but the rebels having given
up the field in disgust, our men can now
build their cabins and sit down to talk over
the events of the vear.?Pitts. Chronicle.
BiayROBBKRY AT THE McLl.UK HoUSE.
Night before last, two or more of the nu
merous young thieves who infest the city,
went into the McLure House aud stole
about a hundred dollars worth of clothing
from the boarders. They raised the win
dows and threw the clothing into an alley
back of the house, and their confederates
carried the articles away. The house was
full of people, and the robbery was perpe
trated at a very early hour in the evening.
J6@?No More Cavalry.?The Govern
ment has now between sixty and seventy
tbousaud Cavalry,and the Secretary of War
has notified the Governors of the loyal ]
States, oar own among the number, that no
more Cavalry will be received. The in
complete Cavalry regimeuts, thereforei
must cither be consolidated or mustered 1
in as Infantry, or they will be disbanded.
Jdfcjgf We are informed, upou reliable au
thority thnt the reports in reference to the
mail robberies between Green Spring aud
Romney is false. A number of bags with
out locks were sent down from Romney to
Green Spring, and a report gained curren
cy that they had been rifled of their con
tents.

house of E. H. Fitzhugh, which has been
selected by Gen. Rosecrans to be used for

and the streets swarmed with gaily dressed
Indies.

Questions and Answers.
IA great wny] from Noah's Times and Messenger of
this week.
Question.?t am a youth of eighteen years,
have just completed my course at the Pub
lit School, and am beginning to think at
tentively concerning a business for life. I
have not chosen an avocation. But what
ever business I think of, I find will require
of me some knowledge that I have not, j
and which ray echool course neither inciu- 1
ded nor inculcated. Wealth, of course, is !
one of myjobjects, and I know it is to be i
acquired by industry,- butig there notsome
science of wealth, some fundamental rules, a 1
knowledge or which would aid roe In my
abot 1 I ace men wasting their substance
in law cuits. -t wiah to learn the relation :
ctwecn ordinary business transactions
and the laws of the country, that 1 may!
avoid the vloletlftn of the latter, and so el- 1
cape litigation. Again, in our country,!
?where banks are eo numerous, whose is- I
wait* most of the enrreocy, ii seems j
1 to me that every business man ought to un
; derstand the principles of Banking and Cur
; rency. Are there not also many valuable
, maxims by men of wealth, in regard to
! the net of acquiring and managing pro.
: perty ? Upsides these subjects, account
; antship must be indispensable to every intel
ligent business man, to say nothing of its
! being of itself equal to a trade or art by
: which to gain a livelihood. Can you, Mr.
! Editor, direct me to the most eligible books
; or other means of acquiring these various
I branches of knowledge ?
Answer.?Vortunateiy it is in our power
to afford our correspondent the informa.
! tion he seeks. Mr. Hitchcock, a gentle
man who possesses the treble advantage of
' being at once a practical business man, 11
j thorough accountant, and an urbane and
skillful instructor, devotes his entire time
to aiding young men in acquiring precise
ly thosekinds of knowledge which our cor
respondent asks for, and to him we com
mend all who are similarly deficient.

From Missouri
1 Sedalia, .Mo., Dec. 5?Yesterday a p-ir
ty ot' exasperated citizens, of all parties,
attacked a gang of returned rebels from
? Price's army, under Oapts. Young and
Wheatley, about 20 miles west of here,
killing seven and wounding ten of them.
Among tbe killed was Capt Young. None
of the citizens were killed or severely
; wounded. Tbree of the wounded rebels
i have since died.
Judge Birch, who has been a prisoner iu
Price's camp for some time past, arrived
here to-day, having been released on pa
I role.
I Rolla, Dec. 5.?Advices from the South
west say McCalloch has goue into winter
quarters on Pea Ridge, near Bentonsville,
Benton county. Ark., where he is putting
up barracks for his troops.
Nothing definite is known of Price's
movements.
Gen. MuBride was at Springfield with
^,000 men on Sunday last.
St. Louis, Dec. 5.?Gen. Thos. L. Price,
commanding at Jetfetaon City, will run for j
Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the '
I expulsion of John \V. Reid.
Judge Wo, A Hall, member of the State
Convention, and M. C. Hawkins, have been
named for the race in the district lately ,
represented by John B Clark. Both are
understood to be stroug Union men.
Kansas City, Dec. 5.?By order of Gen. j
Hunter, Col. Jennison's regiment moved U>
a point midway between Kansas City and :
Leavenworth yesterday.
All communication between here and
Iudependen i3 cut off.
The rebel Havs, with 300 men, visited
Independence on Monday, and seized all
the horses belonging to the Pacific Stage
Company, and made a geueral confiscation
of all the property of Union citizens.
St. Joseph, Dec. 5.?Gen. Prentiss made
a speech to a large crowd ot citizens here
yesterday, in which he said, ''As God is
my judge, evert" secessionist in this city
shall take an oath of allegiance to the U.
S. Government and to support the Stars
and Stripes, or I will send them to work
oil the trenches of Fort Smith, and all per
sons who are hereafter found expressing
secession sentiments shall take the oath."
The speech caused great consternation
among tlic secessionists, and was received
with applause by the loyal citizens.
Troops were sent down to Platte county
last night to look after Sigordon's band of
rebels.
Sedalia, Dee. D.?Our latest advices
from the South are that Price has removed
a part of his force from Oscela to a point
5 miles distant, where he has established
bis headquarters,
Gen. Rains' command remained at Osce
ola.
A train of DO wagons, fiomx Lexington,
laden with supplies for Price's army pass
ed unmolested within IS miles of this
pinri- on Monday last.
There are four recruiting ollire> o;i*n
in Lexington, enlisting recruits fur I'rie. 's
army.
Meetings have been held in Lexington
and in Clay, Ray and other river counties,
urging a united effort in behalf of the reb
els, and subscriptions for money, clothing,
are in circulation.
It is believed to be a fact that the Coun
ty Court of Saline County (CI lib Jackson's
residence) in July last authorized Commis
sioners to raise $100,000, to be expended
for the benefit o! Price's army. Oilier
counties alongthe Missouri are believed to
have done the same thirg.
It is stated on good authority that when
Price was beseiging Lexington a delega
tion of citizens was sent to him from Saline
cotin'y, with an urgent request that lie
-bould not allow his army to enter that
county, which was complied with. The
renson.for this request was the dread en
tertained by the inhabitants of the plun
dering propensities of Price's rebels.
The counties on the Missouri river west
of Jefferson City are the richest iu the
State, and have furnished as many men
and as much means in behalf of tlie rebel
lion as the balance of the Slate, while they
have been almost entirely exempt Iroin
marauders, and have been rarely visited by
Federal troops.
Leavenworth, Dec. G.?Brig. Gen. J.
\V. Denver has arrived, and has been as
signed to the command of all the Kansas
regiments.
A portion of Lane's brigade remains at
Fort Scott.
The Fourth regiment is ordered to
Wyandotte.
TheFirst Cavalry, known as Jennison's
regiment, is stationed at Johnny Leake in
tbe Delaware Reservation, nearly opposite
Parksville, Mo.
The Second regiment is nearly recruited,
and will occupy the village of Kic.ipoo, 10
miles above this city.
The river remains open, but trouble is
anticipated with marauding parties when
it freezes over.
Trains are again running on the Platte
Count}' road, and our mail communications
east are re-established.
Kentucky Legislature
Louisville, Ky., Dec. G.?K. F. Bnrnes,
I)isuuiou,of Owen county, offered a se
ries of resolutions, iacluding a demand 00
the Federal Government for the return to
Kentucky of Ex-Governor Moorchead and
other political prisoners, and affirming
that the President's Message foreshadows
the impossibility of preserving or recon
structing the Federal Union. Referred to
the Committee on Federal Relations.
The Union members to-night are itold
a caucus to agree upon the resolutions re
garding the present state of affairs, which
will probably be offered to-morrow.
New York, Dec. 6.?The Ship Yorkshire
from Liverpool, reports on the 28th Nov.,
in hit. 44? 14', long 60? 41', passed a
steamer, bark rigged,showing the rebel flag.
She appeared to have lost her bulwarks.
She had a spread Eagle on her stern and a
white wheelhouse. She was steering South
East. The steamer Vauderbilt arrived
to-day, and will return to Port Royal im
mediately, with Quartermasters supplies.
The steamer Baltic sailed this morning for
Fort Pickens, with the 75th N. YorkReg
iment.
The French steam frigates Pomore and
Calinet sailed to-day.
The steamer Bavaria has arrived from
Southampton. Her dates are to the 20th

The U. S. steam transport steamer Van
derbilt has arrived from Port Royal. She
left on the 3d inst., but brings no news of
importance. The town of Beaufort is still

Loctsvjlle, Dec. 6.?The steamer Pinlt
Varble, from here with a c?tton mill ma
chinery, proceeding to Nashville tinder a
oermit from Secretary Chase, was seized
i>y the rebels, and ts held by Lieut. Mc
Gavoch, commander at Fort Donelson,
awaiting orders from Gen. Johnston. The
machinery was taken to Nashville.
The Louisville papers unanimously con
tlctDU tbe policy of Secretary Cameron In
reference to the emancipation and pros
pective arming of the tlave*. The Jour?

Prom Washington
Washington, Dec. 6.?Lieut. Col. Rey
nolds lias been appointed resideut agent at
ort Royal, under the general regulations
relative to securing and disbursing of tlie
properly found or brought within the ter
titory now or hereafter occupied by the
U. S. forces in the disloyal States. He bus
been ordered to report to the Secretary of
the Treasury.
A bill will soon bo introduced in Con
gress authorizing the organization of a
steam fire brigade, as a large amount ol
government property has recently been de
stroyed for want of some such organiza
tion. There can scarcely be a doubt ot
the passage of the measure.
There are 4G persons from Maryland and
Virginia in the county jail, arrested by
.constables on presumption that they are
fugitive slaves. A difficulty exists in the :
way of their immediate discharge, from
the fact that it cannot yet be ascertained '
whether they are all contraband and as I
lojal citizens have the light to claim a
surrender of their property.
,1( i
Philadelphia, Dec. 6.?Papers contain I
extracts from documeuts accompanying the
Presidents Message relating to foreign af- j
fairs in the course of Secretary Seward's '
instructions to Minister Adams. He says !
the President neither looks forr.or expects !
any actual and permanent dismemberment !
of the American Union, especially by a line !
oflatitude. The improvementof our many j
channels of intercourse and the perfection :
of our scheme of internal exchanges, and
the incorporation of both of them into a ;
great system of foreign commerce concur- j
ring with the gradual abatement of the
force of the only existing cause of alienn
tiou, have carried us already beyond the
danger of disunion in that form. The so j
called Confederate States, therefore in the I
opinion of the President are attempting !
what will prove a physical impossibility.
Necessarilv.they build the structureof their j
government upon the same principal bv i
which they seek to destroy the Union, j
namely, the right of each individual mem- j
ber of the Confederacy, to withdraw from j
it at pleasure and in peace. In another part !
the Secretary says : In short, all your ar- !
guments must belong to one of three classes' '
namely, first arguments drawn from the !
principles of public law and natural justice I
which regulate the intercourse of equal |
states. Secondly, arguments which con- '
cern equally the honor, welfare and hap- j
ptness of the whole Union. Thirdly, argu- j
ments which are equally conservative of '
the rights and interests and ever sentiments
of the United States, and just in their
bearing: upon the rights, interests and sen
tments of Great Britain and all other na
tions. And again Secretary Seward says,
the President would regard it as inconsis
tent with his habitually high consideration
for thegovernmeutand the people of Great
Britain to allow me to dwell longer on the
merely commercial aspect of the question
under discussion. Indeed he will not for
a moment believe that upon the considera
tion of merely financial gain, that the gov
ernment could be induced to lend its aid
to a revolution designed to overthrow
the institutions of this country and involv
ivg ultimately the destruction of the liber
tics of the American people.
The President will not dwell on the
pleasant recollection that Great Britain,not
a year ago, manifested, by a marked atten
tion to the United States, her desire for a
cordial reunion, which, all ancient pre
judices and passions being buried, shall be
a pledge of mutual sympathy and interest
forever; therefore, the United States are
not indifferent to the circumstances of a
coiutnon descent, language, customs and
religion, which recommend a closer sym
pathy between themselves and Great Brit
ain than either might expect in its inter
course with any other nation. The States
are one of many nations that have sprung
from Great Britain herself.
It has been thought by many who have
studied modern history profoundly that
the success of the nations thus deriving
their descent from Great Britain might,
through many ages, reflect back upon that
kingdom the proper glories of its own great
career.
The Government nnd people ol Great
Britain may mistake their commercial in
terests, but they cannot become either un
natural or indifferent to the impulse of an
undying ambition to be distinguished as
the leaders of the nations in the ways of
civilization and humanity.
From Fortress Monroe.
Foktukss Monroe, Dec. 5, via Balti
more, 0.?A flag of truce arrived from
Norfolk to day, bringing several Charles
ton passengers, but no news of any kind
can be gleaned from them, except what is
contained in the Norfolk Day Bool- of to
day. It contains the message of Gov.
Letcher to the Rebel Legislature of Vir
ginia. One of the main points in it is the
regret that Portress Monroe is not in the
possession of the Southern Confederacy.
The rebel Congress, at its session on the
3d inst., passed a resolution of thanks to
Gen. Sterling Price, for his active services
in Missouri during the campaign.
Gov. Letcher uiges a forward movement
and says that the batiks of the Potomac is
not the place to fight, but the struggle
should take place on the banks of the Sus
quehanna.

to Norfolk, with a number of letters and
considerable clothing for the Union pris
oners at Richmond.

Grant street, Pittsburgh, says :
Last July, while running on the river,
on a cotton boat plying between Natchez
and New Orleans, I was taken with Fever
and Ague. For eight long months I suf
fered with this dreadful disease. The
srvater part of this time I was unable to |
work, and spent at least fifty dollars for I
dliferent medicines, but found no perma
nent relief. Three weeks ngo, one of my
friends insisted upon my trying Bccrhave's
Holland /Sitters, saying that a cure was I
guaranteed. After taking it for one week, '
I must say 1 was a sound man. I have j
been at work now for two weeks, and have
had no return of the Chills or Fever what- i
