WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The following1
Is the message of President Cleveland
as transmitted to congress:
To the congress of the United States:
The constitutional duly which requires the
president from time to time to Rive to the con
gress information of tho state OT the union, und
recommcnd to their consideration such meas
ures as be shall judge necessary ana expedient,
is fittingly entered upon by .commending to the
congress a careful examination of the detailed
Statements unJ well supported recommenda
tions contained in the reports of the heads ot
department*, who are chiefly charged with the
executive work of the government, in an ef
fort to abridge this communication as much as
is consistent with is purpose, I shall supple
ment a brief reference to the contents of those
departmental reports by the mention of such
executive business and incidents as are not
embraced therein, and by such recommenlu
tions as appear to bo at this particular time
appropriate.
Peaceful Foreign Relations.
While our foreign relations have not at all
times during the past year been entirely free
from perplexity, no embarrassing situations
£ess
amain that will not yield to the spirit of fair
and love ot justice, which, Joined with con
sistent firmness, characterize a truly American
foreign policy.
.Argentine and Brazil Boundary Question.
My predecessor having accepted the offlce of
arbitrator ot the long-standing missions bound
ary dispute, tendered to the president of the
ArgenMne Republic and Brazil, It has been my
agreeable duty to receive the special envoys
commissioned by those states to lay before me
evidence and arguments in behalf of their re
spective governments*.
The Brazilian Insurrection.
The outbreak of domestic hostilities In the
republic of Brazil found the United States alert
to wulch the Interests of our citizens in that
country, with whioh we carry on Important
commerce. Several vessels of our new navy
are now and for some tlmo have been stationed
at Rio do Janeiro. The struggle being between
the established government, which controls the
machinery of administration, and with which
we maintain friendly relations, and certain
officers of the navy employing the vessels of
their command In an attack' upon the
national capital and chief seaport, and
lacking, as it does, the eletneuts ot di
vided administration, I have failed to see
that the insurgents can reasonably claim recog
nition us belligerents. Thus far the position of
our government has been ihatof an attentive
tut impartial observer of the unfortunate con
flict. Emphasizing our fixed policy of impar
tial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as
ucw exists. 1 deemed it necessary to dbtavow
in a manner not to be misunderstood the un
authorized action of our late naval commander
In thoso waters in saluting the revolted Brazil
ian admiral, being indisposed to countenance
an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to
the local insurrection.
Chilian Claim Question.
Ttio convention between our government and
Chill, having for It* objcct the settlement and
adjustment of the demands ot the two countries
•gainst each other, bas been made effective by
the organization ot the claims commission pro
vided for. Tbe two government* falling to ugrce
tipon the third member of the commission,
the good offices of the president of the Swiss
republic were invoked, as provided in the
treaty, and the selection ot the Swiss vepre
•entutive is this country to complete the organ
ization was gratifying alike to the United
Suites and Chili. Tua vexatious question of so
called legation asylum for offondcrs against the
state and its laws was presented anew in
Chill by tho unauthorized action of tho late
United Stales minister in receiving into his of
ficial residence two porsons WHO had just
failed in an attempt at revolution and
against whom criminal charces were pending
crowing out of a former abortive disturbance.
The doctrine ot asylum as applied to this case
Is not sanctioned by the bes procedejits. unil,
-when allowed, tends to encourage sedition und
strife. Under no circumstances can the repre
sentative!? of this government be permitted,
'tinder the ill-defined fiction of extra territorial
ity, to Interrupt the administration of criminal
(Justice iu the countries 10 which they are ac
credited. A temperate demand having' been
pi arte by the Chilian gove.-ntnenl tor the correc
tion of this conduct In the instance mentioned,
the minister was instructed no longor to har
tior the offenders.
Chinese Registration.
The legislation of last year, known as the
Geary law. requiring the registration of all
Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the
United S'au-s. and the deportation of all not
•com illy lug with the provisions of th» act within
lime prescribed, met with much opiiosition
frcm Chinamen in this country. Acting upon
the advice of eminent counsel that the law was
unconstitutional, tiie great mass of Ctfioose
-laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its val
idity, in good fattli declined to apply for the
-certificates .required by its provisions.
A test case upon pro ceding by habeas
-corpus was brought before the supreme court,
.and on May 15. It03, a decision was made by
that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed
that under the recent amendment of the act
-extending the tima- for registration the Chi
nese laborers thereto entitled who desire to re
side in tills country wilt now avail themselves
•of the renewed privilege thus afforded of estab
lishing by lawful procedure lUeir right to're
main. and that thereby tho necessity of en
forced deportation may to a great degree be
avoided.
The Murder of Missionaries In China.
It has devolved upon the United States min
ister nt PcKin, as dean of the diplomatic body
end iu the nbsence of a representative ot
Sweden and Norway, to press upon the Chlneso
government reparation for the recent murder
of Swedish missionaries at Sung-Pu. This
question is of vital interest to alt countries
whose citizens engage in missionary work in tho
interior.
The Slave Trado In Africa.
By article 18 of the general act of Bressels,
slimed July St, 1MM, for the suppression of tue
slave trade and the restriction of certain in
jurious commerce in the independent state of
the Congo, and in the adjacent zone ot Central
Africa, the Uuited Stales anu the other signa
tory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means
for the punisbmeut of persons selling arms and
ammunition t.» tt»e natives and tor the confisca
tion ot the iuhibited articles.
It being the plain duty of this government
to aid in suppressing the nefarious iraflU-, im
pairing us It does the praiseworthy und civ
ilizing efforts now la progt-vss in that region. I
recommend that an act be passed prohibiting
the sale of arms and intoxicants to the natives
in tho regulated zone by our citizens.
Kxtradltion Treaties.
Cosla Rica has lately testified its friendli
ness by surrendering to the United Stules. in
the absence ot a convention of extradition, but
upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a
noted fugitive from justice. It Is trusted that
the negotiation ot a treaty with that country
to meet recurring oases ot this kind will soon
be accomplished Iu my opinion treaties for
reciprocal extradition should be cow-laded
with all those countries with which tho United
States has not already conventional arrange
ments of that character.
I have deemed it titling to express to the
governments of Costa Itica and Colombia the
governments of Costa Rica and Colombia the
kindly desire of the United States to see their vvhlthpromptsd it

pending boundary dispute finally closod by
arbitration ir. conformity with tho spirit of the
treaty concluded between them some years
ago.
The French Republic.
Our relations with the French republic con
tinue to be Intimate aud cordial. 1 sincerely
hope that the extradition treaty with that
country, as amended by the senate will soon be
operative.
Germany.
While occasional questions, affecting our
naturalized citizens returning to the land of
their birth, have arisen in our intercourse with
Germany, our relations with that country con
tinue satisfactory.
S Great Britain.
The questions affecting our relations with
Great Britain have been treated In a spirit of
friendliness. Negotiations aro In progress bu-
twesn the two governments with view to sooh
oooenrrjat action as will make ths award and
regulations agreed upou by the Behring see
tribunal of arbitration praetloaUy effective
sad it is not doubted that GreatBrltaln will
cooperate freely with this country for
Che accomplishment of that purpose. The
dispute growing out of the dnodnlnat
lag tolls imposed in the Welland
MlHSI HAAa A»am*a A# a A.
upon cargoes of oereals bound to
and from the lake ports ot the United States,
was adjusted by the substitution of a more
equitable schedule of charges, and my prede
cessor thereupon suspended his proclamation
imposing discriminating tolls upon British
transit through our canals A request for ad
ditions the list of extraditable offenses cov
ered by tho existing treaty between the two
countries Is under consideration.
Haytl.
During the past year an American citizen em
ployed in a subordinate commercial position In
Hay it, after suffering a protracted imprison
ment on an unfounded charge of smuggling,
was finally liberated on judicial examination,
upon urgent representation to the Haytien
government a suitable indemnity was paid to
the sufferer. By a law of Hay ti a sailing vessel
having discharged her cargo is refused clear
ance unlit the duties on suoh cargo have been
paid. The hardship of this measure upon
American shipowners who conduct the bulk of
the carryiug trade of that oouulry has been in
sisted on with a view of seouring the removal
of this cause of complaint
Honduras.
Upon receiving authentic information ot the
firing upon an Amerloan mail steamer touching
at the port ot Amapala, beoause her captain re
fused to deliver up passengers in transit from
Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the
military authorities of Honduras, our minister
to that ounlry under instructions protested
against the wanton sot and demanded satis
faction. The government of Honduras, ac
tuated by the sense of justioe, and in a spirit of
the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the
illegal conduct of its offlcers, and expressed
sincere regret for the occurrence.
It is confidently anticipated that a satis
factory adjustment will soon i.e reached of the
questions arising on tot the seizure and use of
American vessels by Insurgents in Honduras
and the subsequent denial by the successful
government ot commercial privileges to those
vessels on that account.
Republic of Liberia.
A notable part of the southeasterly coast of
Liberia between Cavlly and San Pedoro
rivers, which for nearly halt a century has
been generally recognized as belonging to that
republic by cession and purchase, has been
claimed to be under the protectorate of France
in virtue of agreements entered Into by the na
tive tribes over whom Siberian coutroi has uot
been well malotalued More recently, nego
tiations between the Siberian represent
ative and the Frenoh government re
sulted In the signature at Paris of a treaty
whereby as an adjustment certain Liberian ter
ritory is ceded to France. This convention
at last advices had not been ratified by ths
Llberlau legislature and executive Feeling a
sympathetic tuterestin the foriuues of this lit
tle commonwealth, the establishment and de
velopment o.' which were largely aided by the
benevolence of our countrymen, und which con
stitutes the only independently sovereign slate
on the west coast ot Africa, ihis government
has suggested to the French government its
earnest concern lest territorial impairment in
Liberia should take place without lier uncon
strained consent.
Mexico.
Our relations with Mexico continue to beof that
close and Irieudly nature which should always
characterize the intercourse of two neighboring
republics. The work of relocating the monu
ments marking the boundary between the
countries from faso del Norte to the Paclfio Is
now nearly completed. The commission re
cently organized under the conventions of U84
and 18s9 it is expected will speedily settle dis
putes growing out of the shilling currents dl
the Rio Grande river east of Kl Paso.
Nicaragua and Guatemala.
Nicaragua has recently passed through two
revolutions, the party ut tirst successful hav
ing in turn been displaced by another. Our
newly-appointed minister, by bis timely good
offioes, aided in a peaceful adjustment of the
controversy involved in the tirst conflict The
large American interests established in that
country iu connection with tho Nicaragua canal
were uot molested. The canal company
has, unfortunately, become financially seriously
embarrassed, but a generous treatment, has
beenexieuded to it by the government of Nic
aragua. The United States are especially in
terested iu the successful achievement of the
vast undertaking this company has in charge
That it should be accomplished under distinc
tively Amerloan auspices, and its enjoyment
assured, not only to the vessels ot this country
as a channel of communication between our At
lantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships
of the world in the interests of civilization, is a
proposition which, iu my judgment, does not
admit of question.
Guatemala has also been visited by the po
litical vioissitudes whioh have afflicted her
Central American neighbors, but the dissolu
tion of her legislature and tue proclamation of
a dictatorship have been nnattended with civil
war.
Kxtradltion with Norwajr and Russia.
An extradition treaty with Norway has re
cently been proclaimed and exchanged.
The extradition treaty with Russia, signed in
March, le87, and amended and confirmed by the
senate In February last, was duly proclaimed
last June.
Tho Ram can Troubles.
Led by desire to compose differences and con
tribute to tho restoration of order in Samoa,
wnich for some years previous had beeu ihe
scene ot conflicting forelgu pretensions and na
tive strife, the United States, departing from
it* policy consecrated by a Centura of observ
ance, entered four years ago Into the treaty of
Berlin, thereby becoming jointly bound
with England and Germany to establish
and maintain Maiietoa Laupepa as king of
Samoa. The treaty provided for a foreign
court of justice a municipal council for tue dis
trict of Apia, with a foreign president thereof,
authorized to advise the king a tribunal for
the go ttlement of native and foreign land titles
und a revenue system for the kingdom. It
imposed upon the three powers that part of the
cost of the new government not met by the
revenue ot the islands.
Ka.ly in the lite of this triple protectorate
the native dissensions it was designed to
quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of
tne new king, refusing to pav taxes and de
manding the election of a ruler by native suf
frage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and
a large nnmber ot his adherents were in open
rcbclliou on one of the Islands Quite lately
as the request of the other powers, and in ful
fillment of its treaty obligation, this govern
ment agreed to unite in a joint military move
ment ot such dimensions as would probably se
cure the surrender of the insurgents without
bloodshed. The warship Philadelphia was ac
cordingly put under orders for Samoa, but be
fore she urrived the threatened conflict
was precipitated by King Maliotoa's at
tack upou the insurgent camp. Mataafa
was defeated und a number of men
killed. Tho British und German naval ves
sels present subsequently secured the surren
der of Mataafa and his adherents. The
defoated chief and ten ot his principal support
ers were deported to a German island of the
Marshall group, where they are held as prison
ers under the Joint responsibility and cost ot
the threo powers.
This incident and the events leading up to It
singularly illustrate the impolioy of establish
ing alliances with foreign powrs.
Relations with Spain.
More than fifteen years ago this government
preferred a claim against Spain in behalf of one
of our citizens, for property seized and confis
cated in Cuba. In 1886 the claim was adjusted.
Spain agreeing to pay. unconditionally, us a
lair indemnity, il,&M,000. A respectful but
earnest note was recently addressed to the
Spanish government Insisting upon prompt ful
fillment of its long- neglected obligation. Other
claims preferred by the Uuited States against
Spatn, in behalf of American citizens tor prop
erty confiscated in Cuba, have been pending for
many years.
At tho time Spain's title to the Caroline is
lands was confirmed by arbitration that gov
ernment agreed that the rightsiwhlch had been
acquired there by American missionaries
should be recognized and respected. It is sin
cerely hoped that this pledge will be observed
by allowing our missionaries, who were removed
from Ponape to a piace of safely by a United
Stales warship during the late troubles be
tween the Spanish uurrlson and the natives, to
return to their fields ot usefulness.
The reproduced caravel, Santa Maria, built
by Spain aud sent to the Columbian exposition,
has been presented to the United Stafs in
token of amity and ir. commemoration of the
eveut it was designed to celebrate. 1 recom
mend that in accepting this gift, congress

Will Protect Armenians.
The right to exclude any or all olasses of
aliens is an attribute of sovereignty. It Is a
ngbt asserted and, to a limited extent, enforced
by the United States with ihe sanction of our
highest court. There being no naturalization
treaty between the United States and Turkey,
our minister at Constantinople has been in

that government to enforce Its declared polloy

gratifying consummation. The ratification by
Venezuela of the^onven Hon,or tbe arbitration of
the long deferred claim of the Venezueliut trans
portation company, is awaited.
The Hawaiian Affair.
It is hsrdly necessary for me to state that the
questions arising from our relations with
Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment.
Just prior to tbe installation of the present ad
ministration the existing government of Hawaii
bad been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of
annexation had been negotiated between the
provisional government of the island* and the
Uuited States aud submitted to th* senate for
ratification. This treaty I withdrew for exam
ination,and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount,ot
Georgia, lo Houolulu as a speolal commissioner
to make an Impartial investigation of the oir
cumstunces attending the ohange ot govern
ment, an o' all the conditions bearing upon the
subject of the treaty. After a thorough and ex
haustive examination Mr Blouut submitted to
me his report, showing bjyond all question
that the constitutional government of Hawaii
had been subverted with the aotive aid of our
representative to that government, and through
the iutimldatlon caused bv the presunne of an
armed naval force of the United States which
was landed for that purpose at the in
stsnce of our minister. Upjn the faots
developed It seemed to me the only honorable
course tor our government to pursue was to
undo tbe wrong that had been done by those
representing us and restore as far us prac
ticable the status existing at the time of our
roroible intervention. With a view of accom
plishing this result within tbe constitutional
umits of executive power, and reoognizing ail
our obligations and responsibilities growing
out of any changed conditions brought by our
unjustifiable interference, our present minister
at Honolulu has received appropriate instruc
tions to that end.
A Special Message Forthcoming.
Thus far no information of the accomplish
ment ot any definite ntsutts has beon received
from him. Additional advices are soon ex
pected. When received they will be prumptly
sect to the congress, together with all other in
formation at hand, accompanied by a special
executive message fully detailing ail the facts
necessary to a comp.ete understanding of tho
case, and presenting a history of all tbe materi
al events leading up to tbe present situation.
Favorable to Arbitration.
By a concurrent resolution, passed by the
senate February 14, 1680. and by the house of
representatives on IheSdot Api i, following, the
presldeut was requested to "invite,from time to
time, as fit occasions may arise, negotiations
with uny government wltn which tho United
States has or may have diplomatic relations,
to the end that any differences or dis
puieB arising between the two govern
ments which oaunot be adjusted by diplo
matic agency may be referred to arbitration
und be peaceably adjusted by such means."
April 18, 189J, the international Amerioau con
ference of Washington uy resolution expressed
the wish thai all controversies between the re
publics of America and the nations or fcurope
mignt bo settled by arbitration and recom
mended that the government of each nation
represented in that confeieuce shpuld commit
nluate this wish to all irieudly powers
A tsvorable response has beeu received from
Great Britain in the shape of a resolution
adopted in parliament July 16 last, cordially
sympathizing with ihe purpose in view, and ex
pressing the hope that her majesty's govern
ment will lend ready cooperation to the govern
ment of tbe United States upon the basis of the
concurrent resolution above quoted* It affords
me sgnal pleasure to lay tuis parliamentary
resolution before the congress, ar.d to express
my sincere gratification that the sentiment of
two great and kinJred nations is thus authori
tatively manifest In favor of the rational and
peaceable settlement of international quarrels
by honorable resort to arbitration.
Grade of Foreign Envoys Raised.
Since the passage ot tbe act of March 3,1893,
authorizing the president to raise the grade ot
our envoys- to correspond wiih the rank iu
whioh foreign countries accredit their agents
here. Great Brltaiu, Frauce. Italy and Ger
many have conterred upon their representa
tives at ibis capital the title of ambassador,
ani I have responded by accrediting the agent
or the United states in thoso countries with
the same title.
A like elevation ot mission is announced by
Russia, and when made will be similarly met.
Tnis step fittingly comports with the position
the United Stales holds in the family ot na
Hons. During my former administration 1 took
occasion lo recommend a rccusl of the laws re
lating to the consular service £1 order that it
might become a more efficient agency in the
promotion of the interests it was iu tended to
subservo. The duties and powers of consuls
have been expanded with the growing require
ments ot our toreiga trade. Discharging im
portant duties uffeciing our commerce and
American citizens abroad, and in certain coun
tries exercising judicial functions, these offi
cers should be men of character, intelligence
and ability.
Copyright Extended to Denmark.
Upon proot that the legislation of Denmark
secures copyright to American citizens on
qual footing with its own, the privileges ot our
copyright laws have been extended by procla
mation to subjects of that couutry.

Repeal of the Sliver Purchasing Clans*.
The recent repeal of the provisions of law
requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the
government as a feature of our monetary
scheme bas made an entire change in the com
plexion of our enrrenoy affairs I do not doubt
that tbe ultimate result of this aotlon will be
most salutary and far reaching In the nature
•f things, however, it is impossible to know
at this time precisely what conditions will be
brought about by the change, or what, If any,
supplementary legislation may, in the light of
suoh conditions, appear to be essential or ex
pedient
Confident of the Future.
°f course, after the recent financial perturba
tion, time is necessary for the reestablishraent
of business confidence. When, however,
through this restored confidence the money
whioh has been frightened into boarding places
is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey ot
tke situation will probably disclose a safe path
leading to a permanently sound currenoy,
abundantly sufficient to meet every require
ment of our increasing population and busi
ness. In the pursuit of this object we should
resolutely turn away from uilurtne and
temporary expedients, determined to be con
tent with nothing less than a lasting and com
prehensive financial plan. In these olrcutp
stanoes I am convinced that a reasonable delay
lo dealing with this subject, Instead of being in
jurious. will Increase the probability of wise
action.
The Monetary Conference.
Tbe monetary conference whiob assembled at
Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned to
the 30th day of November in the present year.
Ttte considerations just staled ana the fact that
a definite proposition from us seemed to be ex
peoted upon the *eassembliug of the conference
ted me to express a willingness to have the
meeting still further postponed. It seems to
me thailt would be wise to give general authori
ty to the president to invite other nations to
suoh a conference at anv time when there
should be fair prospeot of accomplishing an
international agreement on the subject of
coinage.
Kecommendation Regarding Bonds.
I desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom
of amending the existiug statutes in regard to
the lssuanoe of government bonds. The au
thority now vested in the secretary of the
treasury lo issue bonds is not as dear as it
should be, and the bonds authorized are disad
vantageous to tbe government both as to the
time of their maturity aud rate of interest.
Immigration Statistics.
The superintendent ot immigration, through
the secretary oi the 'reaaury, report* thi.1 dur
ing the last fiscal year tnere urrived at our
ports 44J.793 immigrants. Ot these 1.U63 were
not permitted to land under the limitations ot
the law, and 577 were returned to .be couutries
from whence tbey oame, by reason ot their hav
ing become publio charges The total arrivals
were 141,034 less than fur the previous year.
Prevention of Uiveasn.
The seoretary in his report gives an account
of the operation of the marine bosp tal service
and ot the good work done under its supervision
in preventing the entrance and spread of con
tagious diseases. The admonitions of the last
two years touching our public health and
the demonstrated danger the Introduction
of contagious diseases trotu foreign ports has
invested tne subject of national quaruuine with
increased iuierest. A more general aud har
monious system than now exists, acting
promptly und diroctly everywhere, and con
stantly operating by preventive means to
shield our country from the invasion o" disease,
aud at the same time having oue regard to the
rights and duties ot local agencies, wo.ild, I be
lieve, add greatly to the saiety of our people:
The War Department.
The secretary ot war reports that tbe
strength of tue nsinv on t!ie joih day of Sep
tember last was 23.T78 enlisted men and 2,144
oDtcers. Tbe total expenditure of the depart
ment for the year ending June 30, 18Ki, amount
ed to (31,906,074.91 Ol this sum, »1.992,5*1.95
was for salaries aud coiitingeu-. expenses «23,
877,828 35 for the support ot the military estab
lishment (6,077,033. IS for miscellaneous ob
jects, and t&i,&i8,6jl.41 for public works. This
latter s«im includes tl5.29S.87ii 40 tor river und
harbor improvements and v3.2j0,141.30 for forti
fications aud other works of deiuttse.
Tho National Guard.
The total enrollment of tne militia of the
several states was ou xt:e 31st of October of the
ourreut year 112,59/ euttcers aud eultsted men.
The officers of the army detailed for tbe iu
speotiou and Instruction of this reserve of our
military forue report mat increased interest
and marned progress are apparent in the dis
cipline and emcieacy of tne organization.
I'eace Has Keigued.
Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestlo vio
lence have called the army into service during
the year, and theouty sctive military duty re-,
quired of it has beeu iu the depai iiueui of 'lexas,
where violations of the neutrality laws of the
United Stales aud Mexioe were promptly and
efficiently dealt with by the troops, oi.citing the
warm approval ot the civil and military au
thorities of both countries.
He organise the Army.
The operation ot w.se laws and the iafiuences
of civilization constantly leuding to relieve tne
country from the uaugers of ludian hostilities,
togtMuer with the increasing ability ot the
stales, through tbe efficiency ot tho na
tional guard organizations, to protect
their citizens from domestic violence, lead
to the suggestion that tbe time is
fast approaching when tnere should
be a reorganization ot our army on the lines of
the present necessities of the country. This
chunge contemplates ueiiher lucrease number
nor added expense, but a redistribution ot tue
force itucfcan enoouragemeui of measures tend
ing to greater efficiency among the uuen and im
provement ot the service. Tbe adoption of
battalion formations for infantry regiments,
the strengthening of the artillery loroe, the
abandonment of smaller aud unnecessary
jposls, aud the massiug of the troops al impor
tant and accessible la tions. all promise to pro
mote the usefulness of me arm v. in the judg
ment of army officers, with out iew exceptions,
the operation ot the law forbidding tbe reeu
llstment ot men after ten years servioe has not
proved its wisdom, aud while ihe arguments
that led lo its adoption were not wilhoni- merit
the experience of years constrains me to join In
the recommendation for its repeat.
Progress In Uoaat Defense-
It is gratifying to note that we have begun
to attain completed results In the comprehen
sive scheme ot scacoast defense and lorufioa
tion, entered upou eight years ago A
large sum has been already expended,
but the cost of inaintenauoe will btauiou
siderable as compared with the ex|jRK of
construction and ordnance. At the end of
the ourrent calendar year tne war depart
ment will have nine 12-inch, twenty lu-inch
and thtriy-foui*8-lnchguns, ready to be mounted
on gun-lifts and carriages, ana seventy-live 12
Inch mortars In aduniou to the product of
the army gun factory, now uouipleied at Wa
tervliet, tbe gi-v ecu meat has contracted
with private parties for the purchase
of one hundred guns of these cali
bers, ths first of which should be
delivered to the department for test before
July 1, 1891. 'ihe manufacture ot heavy ord
nanoe keeps pace with current needs: but lo
render these guns available for the purposes
tbey are designed to meet, emplacements must
bo prepared for them Progress has been made
iu this direction, and it is desirable that con
gress by adequate appropriations should pro
vide for the uninterrapied prosecution of this
necessary work.
New Klfle for the Army-
After much preliminary worit and exhaustive
examination in accordance with the require
ments of the law. the board appointed to seiect
a magazine rifle of modern type, with which to
I replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of tbe in
fantry service, completed its labors during tbe
last year, and the work of manufacture is now
in progress ut the national armory at Spring
field. It is confidently expected that bv the
end of tbe currout year our infantry will be
I sspplled with a weapon equal to that of the
most progressive armies of ihe world.
National Military Park.
Tbe work on tbe projected Ohickamnuga and
Chattanooga national military park has
been prosecuted with zeal and Judg
ment, and Its opening will bo cele
brated during tho coming year. Over nine
square miles of ths Ghiokamauga battlefield
have been aoquirad, tweatr five mnesef road
way have been constructed and peraaaent tab
lets have been placed at many historical noints.
while the invitation to ths SUMS to nn the
Kiltlons
of their troops participating la the
tUe has been very generally accepted. Tbe
work of locating and preserving the lines ot
battle at the Gettysburg battlefield Is immhi
satisfactory progress OB the plans directed by
l!»e last oongress
The Military Schools.
The reports of the Military academy at West
Point and tbe several schools for special In
structions of officers show marked advance in
education of the armv and a commendable am
bition among its ofBoers to excel in the mili
tary profession and lo fit themselves for the
highest service to tbe country.
Under the supervision ot Adjt Gen. Robert
Williams, lately retired, tbe bureau of military
information has become-well established andjs
performing a service-that will put In possessfiui
of the government in tkne of war most valuable
Information and at all times serve a purpose ot
great utility in keeping the army advised of tbe
world's progress In all matters pertaining to
the art of war.
The Judiciary Department.
The report ot the attorney general contains tbe
usual summary of tbe affairs and proceedings
of the department ot justice for tbe past year,
togetmr with certain recommendations as to
needed legislation on various subjects. I can
not too heartily indorse tbe proposition that the
fee system as applicable to tbe compensation
of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks
of federal oourts and United States commis
sioners. should be abolished with as little de
lay as possible It is clearly In the interest of
ths community that tbe business of tbe oourts,
both civil and criminal, shall be as small and
as inexpensively transacted as the ends
of Justioe will allow. The system1
is therefore thoroughly vicious which
makes tbe compensation of court officials de
Pend upon the volume of suoh business, and
thus creates a conflict between a proper execu
tion of the law and private gain, which cannot
fail to be dangerous to the rights and free
dom of oltizens and irrisistlble temp
istion to tbe unjustifiable expenditure
oi publio funds. If in addition to this re
form another was inaugurated which would
give to the United States commissioners
the final disposition of petty offenses within
the grade ot misdemeanors, especially those
coming under tbe internal revenue laws, a
great advance would be made toward a more
decent administration of the criminal law.
Iu my firs message to congress, dated De
cember 8. 1883. I strongly recommended these
changes aud referred somewhat at length lo
the evils of the present system Sihoe that
time tbe criminal business of the federal courts
and the expense attending it have enormously
increased. The number of criminal prosecu
tions pending in the c.rcult and district courts
of the United States on the 1st day of July.
1883, was 3.8J8, of which 1.814 were for vio
lations ot tne internal revenue laws,
whils the number of such prosecutions pending
on tbe 1st day of July, 189% was 9, 0i. of which
4,20.1 were for violation of ihe internal revenue
laws The expense of tbe United States courts,
exclusive ot judges' salaries, for the year
ending
July 1 1185, was *2.874,73311 and for ihe year
ending July 1, 1893, *4.528,676 87. it 13. there
fore, apparent thai the reasons given in 1885 for
a change in the manner of enforcing tbe federal
criminal law have gained cogency and gained
strength in lapse ot t'me.
Indorses the Attorney General.
I also beartily join tbe attorney general in
recommending legislation fixing degrees of the
orime of murder within federal jurisdiction, as
has been done in many ot the states authoriz
ing writs ot errors in behalf of the government
in cases where final judgment is rendered
against the sufficiency of an in
dictment or against the government
upon any other question arising before
actual trial limiting tbe right of review in
cases ot felony punishable only by fine and im
prison men. 10 the circuit court oi appeals, and
making speedy provision for the construction
of sneh prisous bud reformatories as may be
necessary for tne confinement of Uuited States
convicts.
Postal Affairs.
The report ot the postmaster general con
tains a detailed statement of the operations of
the post office department during the last fiscal
year und much Interesting information touch
ing this Important branch ot the public
service. The business of the mails
indicates with absolute certainty the con
dition of the business of tho country,
and depression in financial affairs inevitably
aud quickly reduces the postal reveuues.
Therefore a larger discrepancy ttuvu usual be
tween tbe post office receipts and expenditures
is the expected and unavoidable result of the
distressing stringency which has prevailed
throughout the country during much of tbe
time covered by the postmaster general's re
port.
Knnrmoos Deficiency.
At a date when better times were anticipated
It was estimated by bis predecessor that the
deficiency on the 30th day ot June, 1MM, would
be but a little over U,Eoo,iX}J It amounted,
however, to more than t5,0U0,00a At the same
time, aud under the influence of like anticipa
tion?, estimates were mode for the current
lli'-al year ending June 3j. t&M, which exhibited
a .surplus of revenue over expenditures of *872,
24:i 71 but now. in view of tue actual- receipts
and expenditures during that part of the cur
rent fiscai year already expired, tbe present
postmaster general estimates that ut lis c.ose
instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency
of nearly S8.00J,(KU
The post office receipts tor tbe last fiscal year
amounted to- 7O.896.93J.16, and its expenditures
to 181.074,004.9.1. Tuis post office deficiency
would disappear or be Immensely decreased If
less matte'- was carried free through ihe mails,
an item of which is upward ot 800 ions of seeds
and grain from the agricultural department.
The total number of post offices in the United
States on the 3Jth dayot June, 189A HUB68,
403, an increase ot 1,284 over the preceding
year. Of these 3,36J were presidential, an in
crease in that class ot 204 over the preceding
year.
The Free Delivery System.
Forty-two free delivery offices were added
during the year to tho»e already existing, mak
ing a total of 610 cities and towns provided
with free delivery on June 30, 18JS. Ninety
three other oities und towns are now entitled
to 1 his service under the law, but it has not
been accorded them on account of in
sufficient funds to meet the txpeuse of
its establishment. I am decidedly of tbe
opinlou that the provisions ot the present
law permit as general an introduction of this
feature of mall service as is necessary or justi
fiable, and that it uot be exteuded to smaller
communities than are now designated. Ihe
expense of tree delivery for the Uocai year osd
ing Juue 30. l&M. will be more than *I1,00J,U(W,
aud uuder legislation now existing there must
be a constant Increase in this item of expendi
ture.
Money Order Business.
There were 6,401 additions to the domestlo
money order offices duriug the last fiscal year,
being the largest increase in any year since ihe
inauguration of the Sk-tem. Tue total number
of these offices at tbe close of the year wss
18.431. There were l.l,30J.7J5 money orders is
sued from'these offices, Leiug an increase over
the preocdiug year ot 1,210,294 and the
value of these orders amounted to *197,576,
433.65, au increase ot I7,5c9,63z..i8. 'ihere were
also issued during the year postal notes
amounting to 112,9J3,076.71 During the year
195 international money-order offices were
added to those already provided, making a to
tal ot 2.407 in operation ou June 30, 1801
The number of international money orders is
sued during tho year was 1,0)5.9? 1, an increase
over the preceding year ot 72.523. and their
value was «ld,3i 1,837 M, an increase of II,2^,
606.31. The number of orders paid was **niil/,
un increase over the preceding year of 13,5.1,1,.
and their value was «6,'.83,375.70 an Increase ot
194.094.83. From the foregoing statements It
appears that tbe total issue of money orders
and postal notes for tbe year amounted to
tli# 821.31*84.
Tbe number of letters and packages mailed
during the year tor special delivery was 3,37V
69& an inorease over ibe preceding year of
nearly 22 per cent Tbe special delivery stamps
used upon tbess letters and packages amounted
to 337,560 and the messenirars' fees paid tor
their delivery amounted to 19(8,502.71, leaving a
profit of i8J,976 59.
TUe Railway Servlee.
Tbe railway mail service not onlv adds to the
promptness ot mail delivery at ull offices, but
it Is ihe espeoial Instrumentality nich puts
the smaller and way places In the service on an
equality in that regard with the larger and
lermiual offices 'i his branch of tbe postal
service has therefore received much attention
from the postmaster seseral, and, thjugh it is
gratifying to Know that it is lu a condition of
high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led
to agree with the postmaster general, that
there room for its further improvement.
Value of Ctvil Service Ketorm.
There are now connected with, the post office
establishment £4,3 :4 employes who are In the
classified service. The head of this gre it de
partment gives conclusive evidcnco ot the
value of civil service reform when, after an ex
perience that renders his judgment on the sub
ject absolutely reliable, he expresses the
opinion ihst without the benefit of this system
it would be Impossible to conduct the vast busi
ness intrusted to him.
1 desire to commend as especially worthy
of prompt attention the suggestions ot the
postmaster general relating to a more sensible
und business-like organization and a better dis
tribution of responsibility in his department

Progress in the construction of new Tossnli
has not beeu as rapid as was anticipated.
There has been delay in the completion of u
armored vessels, but for the most part they
have been such as are constantly occurring
even In countries having the largest experisnse
in naval ship building. Tbe most serious do-.
lays, however, have been in tbe work apoa
armored ships Tbe trouble bas been tbe Ml

The difficulties seem now, however, to have
been all overcome, and armor is being delivered
with satisfactory promptness.
Our Reorganised Navy.
As a result ot tbe experience acquired by
ship builders and designers and material SMB.
it Is believed that the dates when vessels will
be completed can now be estimated with rea

which will be completed by August 1. of that
year. It is also expected that the three gun
boats authorized by the last eongress will be
completed iu less than two years.
A Note of Warning.
Slnoe 1886 oongress has at each session
authorised tbe building of one or more vessels,
and the secretary of the navy preseats an
earnest plea for tbe continuance of
this plan. He recommends tbe authori
sation of at least one battleship and
six torpedo boats. Wbilo 1 am dis
tinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the
policy we have inaugurated of building up a
thorough and efficient navy I eaonot refrain
from tne suggestion that the oougn-ss should
carefully take into accouut the number of un
finished vessels on our hands and the depleted
condition of our treasury in considering the
propriety oi an appropriation at this time to
begin new work.
The method of employing mechanical labor
at navy yards through boards of labor, and
making efflcleucy the sole test by which labor
ers are em?loyei and conusasJ. is proiiuo
Ing the best results, and the secretary is
earnestly devoting himself to its development.
Attention is invited to the siatemeuis ot his
report in regard to ihe workings of the system.
The Pensluu Rolls.
The secretary of the interior bas the super
vision of so many important subjects that his
report is ot especial value and interest On the
30in day of Juue. 1893, there were on the pen
sion rolls 965,012 names, an increase of 89,944
over the number on the rolls June So, ltlii Of
these there were 167 widows and daughters ot
revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors ot the war
of 1812,5.425 widows ot soldiers ot that war, 31,
518 survivors und widows ot tbs Mexican war,
8,332 survivors aud widows of Indian wars, 281
army nurses and 473,615 survivors aad widows
and children of deceased soldiers and sailors ot
the war of the rebel.ion The latter number
represents those pensioned on account of disa
bilities or death resulting from army and navy
service. Tne number of persons remaining on
the rolls June 3d, 1893, who were pensioned un
der tbe act of June 27, 1B9J, which allows pen
sions on account of deaih and disability n&t
chargeable to army serviue, was 459 155.
The number added to the rolls daring the
year was 1*3,631 aud the number dropped was
o3,690. The first payments on pensions al
lowed during the year amounted to (33,756,
549.93. This Includes arrears, or the accumu
lation between ihe time from which Un al
lowance of pension dates and the tiue ef actual
ly granting the certificate.
Pensions for Disabilities.
Although the law of IBM permits pensions tor
disabilities uot related lo military service, yet
as a requisite to its benefits a disablil-y must
exist lucapacitalinir applicants "from the per
formance of manual labor to such a degree as
to render them unable to earn a support" Ths
execution of this law in Its early stage* does
not seem to have been iu accord
with its true intention: but toward
tue close ot ibe lust administration an
authoritative construction was given to th«
statute and sinc-j that lime this construotioa
has been loliowed. This has had the effect of
l.mlting the operation of tbe law to its intended
purpose. The discovery having been made that
mauy names had been pui upon the peasioi
roll by means of wholesale anu giganuo frauda
the commissioner suspeuded payments upos'
a number of pensions which seemed to
fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com
plete examination, giving notice to tbe pension
ers in order that they might have an opportun
ity tojbstabiish, if possible, tbe jiMiice of theii
claims noiwiths landing appareut invalidity.
Frauds Should Be Kxposed.
This, understand, is the practice whioh has
for a long lime prevailed in the pension
bureau, but after entering upou these recent
investigations the commissioner modified this
role So as not to allow, until alter complete ex
uuiiuation, interference with the payment of a
pension apparently not altogether void, but'
which merely had been fixed at a rate higher
than authorized by law. I am uuable
to understand why frauds in the pension
rolls should not be exposed and oorrested with
thoruughuess and vigor. Bvery nume frauds
leu Uy put upon these rolls is a wicked imposi
tion upon the kindly sentiment iu wuiok pen
sions have their origin Every fraudulent pen
sioner has become a bad citizen every false
oath in support of a pension bas made perjury
more common, and false and undeserving pen
sioners rob the people not omy ef their
money but ot the pair.otic sentiment
which tho survivors of war. fought for
the preservation of the un on. ought to in
spire. Thousands of neighboi hods nave their
well-known .fraudulent penslousrs. and recent
developments by the bureau establish appall
ing conspiracies to accomplish petto.on frauds.
By no means the least wrong doue is to brave
and deserving pensioners, wno certainly ought
not to be condemned to such association. '1 hoaa
who attempt in tbe line of duty to reoufy f—
wrongs should not be accused of enmity or
difference to ibe claims of honest veterans.
Enormous i£xpendlture*.

Indian Affairs.
Ths condition of the Indians and their alM
mate fate are subjects wbi56 are related to a
sacred duly of ine govern meat and 'whieh
strongly appeal to tbe sense of jueticoaad ihe
sympalny 01 our people.
Our Indians number about S4S,OOt Most of
them are located on Mi reservations, contain
ing M, 118.531 acrea ot land. About lli,6su of
111
est* Indians bave, to a large degree, adopted
civilized customs. Lands in severalty have
been allotted to many of them. Such allotV
ments have been made to 10.0M individuals dur
'ear' embracing about
1 (WWUO acres. The number ot Imilan gov
ernment schools open during tbe year was
lk„an increase of twelve over the preceding
year. Of this total 17U were on reservations, of
which seventy-three were hoarding schools and
ninety-seven were day schools. Twenty board
ing schools and five day schools supported by
the government were not located on reserva
tions. The total number of Indian children en
rolled during the. year us attendants at all
schools was SI, 13$ an incresse of i.*8l aver ths
enrollment for the previous year.
What Is Bost for the Indian.
I am sure that secular education and asoral
and religious teaching must be important fac
tors In un effort to save tbe Indian and lead «.•»»
to civilization. I believe, too. that the rella-
I#
I
If 1 al relations and the gelding ot
illy may, in favorable conditions,
quisbmool ot 1
in «everatt
aid this consumuation. It steins to me, how
ever, that allotment of land Is severalty ought
to be made withcreat care and circumspection.
If hastily done before the Indian knows Ms mean
ing, while yet he has little or no idea of tiding
a farm and no Ssnteption of thrift, Miere is
great danger that a reservation lite in tribal
relations may be exuhauged for the pauperism
of civilization, iuslead of Its Independence 1^

depends very largely upon good adminiett!
