Abdmoke, Tuesday, Dec-6.
Monday's specials from Wash
ington indicates that the opposi
tion to the re-election of Bailey as
Democratic leader in the next Con
gress is dying out.
Representative Cousins of
Iowa introduced the first bill in
Congress Monday. It is a bill de
claring the standard of value in
the United States to be the gold
dollar of 25 8-10 grains of standard
gold and 900 fine. If this bill is
ever heard from again the wool
will fly.
One hundred girls, inmates of
the Cleveland Ov hau Home at
Versailles, Ky., and the matron
and music teacher, are very sick
from poison. Some of the children
will die. They are supposed to
have been poisoned by drinking
water that had been standing in
lead pipes.
Durino the closing days of the
last session of Congress Senator
Morgan gave notice of his inten'
tion to call up the Nicaragua cana!
bill at the beginning of the present
session. He unquestionably wil
redeem his promise and doubtless
will seek the first opportunity. Al
the indications are that this ques
tion will be one of the most im
portant sabjecis under considera
tion during the session.
In his report to Congress Comp
troller Dawes sa,-s that, though a
less number of national banks are
operating than at" any time since
1890, the individual loans, dis
counts and deposits and total re
sources are larger than evr be
fore. Yes, there is lots of money
in the banks, but the stuff the
people have to sell commands such
miserably low prices they scarcely
eke out a scant living. Plenty of
money in the banks doesn't seem
to help the producers. They are
growing poorer each year. There
is bound to be something radically
wrong when such a fact exists.
Extra Session of Creek Council.
Muskogee, Dec. 5. Isparhecher,
the chief of the Creek nation, has
called an extra session of the
council of that nation for the 12th
inst. to consider holding a new
election as to whether or not the
Indians of that tribe desire to
treat with the United States. It
will be remembered that these In
dians by popular vote on the 1st
of November rejected the treaty
they made with the Dawes com
mission last year and the Curtis
bill immediately became operative
oyer them. Now they are anxious
to treat'.

THE V RESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Congress convened Monday, and
President McKinley sent in his
annual message.wbich dealt almost
exclusively" with our war with
Spain and other foreign matters.
He compliments Dewey and Samp
son, but ignores Schley and Roose
velt. He I is in ; favor of building
the Nicaraugua canal and of build
ing up ie 'American merchant
marine. The follo-ving is the
Presidei i position on the finan
cial eoncuuon of the country:
THE INFLOW OF GOLD.
The provision made for strength
ening the resources of the treasury
in connection with the war has
given increased confidence in the
purpose and power of the govern
ment to maintain the present
standard, and has established more
firmly than ever the national credit
at home and abroad. A marked
evidence of this is found in the in
flow of gold to the treasury. Its
net gold holdings on November 1,
1897, were $239,883.16, as com
pared with $1.)8, 573,147 on Novem
ber 1, 1898, and an increase of net
cash of $207,7.36,100, November 1,
1897, to $.K),2:J8,273, November
1, 1898. The present ratio of . net
treasury gold outstanding govern
ment liabilities, including United
States treasury notes of 1890, silver
certificates, currency certificates,
standard silver dollars and frac
tional silver coin, November 1,
1898, was 23 23 ier cent, as com
pared with 19.96 per cent Novem
ber 1, 1897.
DEATH TO GREENBACKS.
I renew so much of my recom
mendation of December, 1897, as
follows:
That when any of the United
States notes are presented for re
demption and are redeemed in gold,
such notes shall be kept and set
apart aud only paid out in ex
change for gold. This is an obvious
duty. If the holder of the United
States notes prefers the gold and
gets it from the government, he
should not receive back from the
government a note without paying
gold for it. The reason for this is
made all the more apparent when
the government issues an issue'
bearing debt to provide gold for
the redemption of United States
notes a non - interest bearing debt.
Surely it should not pay them out
again except on demand and for
gold. If they are put out in any
other way the3' may return again,
to be followed bv another interest
bearing debt to redeem a non
interest bearing debt.
This recommendation was made
in the belief that such provisions
of law would insure to a greater
degree the safety of the present
standard and protect our currency
from evils to which it is subjected
from a disturbance in the general
business condition in the country.
In my judgment the present con
ditions of the country justify the
enactment of the legislation recom
mended one year ago, under which
a portion of the gold holdings
should be placed in a trust fund,
from which greenbacks should be
redeemed upon presentation, but
when once redeemed should not
thereafter be paid out except for
gold.
It is not to be inferred that other
legislation relating to our currency
is not required. On the contrary,
there is an obvious reason for it.
GOLD STANDARD DEMANDED.
The importance of adequate pro
vision which will insure to our
future a money standard now, and
to that of our commercial rivals is
generally recognized.
The companion proposition that
our domestic paper currency shall
lie kept safe and yet be so related
to the needs of our industries and
internal commerce as to be ade
quate and responsive to such needs
is a proposition scarcely less im
portant. The subject in all its
parts is commended to the wise
consideration of the congress.
Many a household is saddened by
death because of the failure to keep
on hand an absolutely certain cure
for croup such as One Minute Cough
Cure. See that your little ones are

GRAIN AND PROVISIONS.
Ohicago, Dec. 6. Wheat The
trade in wheat was about as dull as
could very well bo the case, and es
tablished continuous quotations.
Visible supply increased for the week
729,000, which waa sot as much as
expected. World's shipments 8.
800,000, 100.000 increase over last
year. The arm tone in Liverpool is
said to be caused by reports of bad
weather in Argentine. Continental
cables: Paris wheat and floor un
changed, steady; .Berlin 3-8 np; Am-sterdaml-2
lower; Buda Pesth un
changed. Corn Speculative trade in corn
also doll, but shippers report as
sharp demand for casb and there is
indication of a good spot business
being done.
Oats A trifle easier. Casb demand
fair.
Provisions Firm ; trade is broad
ening somewhat. Pickers are the
sellers as a rule.

New York, Dec. 6. The situation
this morning was uninteresting
Liverpool was halting with futures,
although spot sales indicated con
tinued good demand. Receipts
however, promised to be heavy, and
this tended to produce hesitation in
both markets. The fact is, receipts
are keeping up entirely too free, and
it will require a falling off to con
vince people that the crop will not
reach the estimate claimed by many
The opening was unchanged to 2
points advance on small sales, fol
lowed by unimportant changes and
continued indifference np to the
noon hour, spotsjwere unchanged
Tarns at Manchester quiet. Cloth
orders were at low limits.
In the afternoon prices went down
4 to 5 points from the opening. On
the whole there was very little doing
all day. The market closed at 1 to
2 points decline.
