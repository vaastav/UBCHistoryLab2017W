Littei.l's Living Age.?' Year by yea;
those who wish to keep them elves informed
in the literature of the day come more generally
to recognize The Living Age as the best means
for attaining that end within the reach of per
sons of moderate leisure." This is owing tc
the fact that The Living Age. being published
in weekly numbers of sixty-four pages each,
gives more than three thousand double column
oc'tyo pages of rcadiug matter yearly, and is
thereby enabled to present with a satisfactory
completeness, nowhere else attempted, whatever
ia of immediate interest or permanent
value iu the vast and generally inaccessible
mass of foreign periodical literature.?a litera
ture embracing the productions of the able*'
living writers in every department, whether
relating to history, biography, fiction, poetry,
wit. .science, politics, tneology, criticism or art.
As a fresh compilation of the admirable and
noteworthy in current literature, including the
ablest and most interesting essays, reviews,
serial and short stories, poetry, scientific, histoiical,
and politioal information, it has become
invaluable, iu the great and growing multiplicity
of quarterlies, monthlies, and weeklies, to
every person or family of intelligence and taste.
The highest critical authoritiesot the country
unite in pronouncing it "the best of all our
eclectic publications."
The uibscriptiou price ($8 a year) is cheap iu
proportion to the amount of reading matter
niroished ; but for those who desire the cream
of both home and foreign literature a st'll
cheaper offer is made by the publishers (Littcll
& Gay, Boston), viz:, for $10, they will send
The Living Age, weekly, and cither one of the
leading American $4 monthlies, for a year; or
for $S.oO The Living Age and Our Young
Folks. "Possessed of The Living Atre and of
one or. other of our vivacious American monthlies,
a subscriber will find himself in command
of the whole situation. ' The next volume of
The Living Age begins January 1st.

The usual committer* to inform the President
and the other Moure that Congress had assembled,
was appointed.
A resolution was introduced for the immediate
re construction of the destroyed public buildings
at Chicago.
Mr. Sumuer presented Uu? petititions from
Dr. Augusta and Dr. Powers, complaining that
they were not admitted lu the Medical Society
of the District of Columbia 01: account of their
color, and urged that Congress should, at ihe
earliest period, take r.lejjs to jn..t,-ei mo colored
race.
A petition of Mr. Plcasanton, Into Com mis
ioner of Internal Revenue, prole.-ting against
the manner oi' his removal IVoni the olliou of
Commissioner of Internal Revenue was pre.
senled.
It was suggested that this busiue?s was
' proper for executive session and the paper was
withdrawn.
Mr. Sumner introduced a hill for substitute
' ing legal tender notes for compound interest
notes. The effect of this bill would, he said,
in a few months make paper equivalent to coin
and bring about specie payment. The susnoni
sion of specie payments and of the writ of habeas
i corpus were, he said, war measures, and tocon
tinuo :heni beyond the war was an outrage.
The President's message was then received
i and read.
In the House of Representatives the u.Mtal
committee to inform the President of the assembling
of Congress was appointed.
The standing commit tecs ol the House were
announced.
A resolution of inquiry into the suspension
of habeas corpus in South Carolina was introduced.
Mr. Dawes, oi" Mass.. objected, and
on motion of Gen. Butler it was referred to
the committee on insurrectionary States.
The President's message was then received
and read.
Mr. Sumner's early attack upon the President's
suspension ol the habeas corpus is looked
upou as the first gun from the uuti-Administration

arid the execution ol the eight student?, showing
that the only desecration to the grave ol
Castanon, consisted ol'breaking lite glass eases
covering the niche of the tomb and substituting
wreaths of garlics instead of immortelles.
At the court martial the Chaplain Siated that
it was only a student's frolic and did not deserve
severe sentences, but the clamor.-, of the
volunteers overruled everything else, and eight
were condemned to death, eleven sentenced ru
six years in the chain gantr, nim teen to lour

The students were all quite young, mere

lered large sums of money to save them, the

j all were vain. Cap'ain General Ynlinascda was
