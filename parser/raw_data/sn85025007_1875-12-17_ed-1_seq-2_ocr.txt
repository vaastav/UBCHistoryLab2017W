Several of the persons interested in the
French spoliation claims have beeo in Washing
ton since the meeting of Congress. The at
tempt to get a bill through providing for the pay
ment of the claims is to bo renewed. One prop
osition, which is favored by those who repre
sent the bulk of the claims, is to petition Con
gress that the claims may be paid out of the
balance of the Alabama award. Under the
present law respecting the distribution of this
award, more than half of it will not be needed,
but if, as seems likely now, the insurance com
panies and other claimants are allowed to be
included, there would not be much of it left for
Frenoh spoliation claimants. Messrs. J. T.
Pickett and J. J. Stewart, on behalf ot the
heirs of Jaoies H. Causten and other French
spoliation claimants, have memorialized the
Senate to request the President to endeavor,
through our minister to France, to secure the
return to this country of the evidence of losses
iueurred by our oiiizens between 1792 and 1S01.
which were forwarded'by our State Depart
nient to France as the basis of a claim ot in
euinity, and have never been returned, al
though, by the treaty ot July, 1S01, our gov
ernment accepting the French claim of set-off,
assumed the obligations of that government to
our citizens. It is supposed that these proofs
ttill exi>t among the archives of the French
government.
Every day a large number of petitions are
presented in the Senate in favor of a commis
sion to inquire into the effects of the liquor
traffic. It is the design to support Senator
llowe's bill to provide for a commission on the
subject of the alcoholic liquor traffic, which re
quires the President to appoint (subject to con
firmation by the Senate) a commission of five
persons, neither of whom shall be a Federal
officeholder nor an advocate of prohibitory leg
islation or of total ab!>t;nence in relation to al
coholic liquors, who shall serve without 9-ilary
and within two years investigate the liquor
traffic, ils relations to revenue and taxation
uud its general economic, criminal, moral and
scientific aspects in connection wilh pauperism,
erime, social vice, the public health and gene
ral welfare of the people, and also inquire and
take testimony as to the practical results of
liccose and prohibitory legislation for the pre
vention of intemperanoe in the several States
of the Union. The bill appropriates $10,000
for neoessary expenses, and requires the com
mission to report the result of their investiga
tion to the President to be by him transmitted
to Congress. Cannot all these matters be left
Jo the States? Even those who consider a pro
hibitory law desirable, must know that Con
gress has no power to pass such a law.
The Republican party leaders are trying to
hedge against the foolishly stupid blunder the
President made ia his annual Message, when
he urged Congress to submit to the Legisla
tures of the States a Constitutional amendment
making it the duty of the States "to establish
and maintain public schools adequate to the
education of all children in the rudimentary
branches within their respective limits, irre-1
spective of sex, color, birth plaoe or religion;
forbidding the teaching in said schools of relig
ious, atheistic or pagan tenets. A prominent
gentleman, after having read this part of the
President's Message, said to a member of the
Cabinet whom he accidentally met one day,
"What does the President mean by recom
mending such an amendment? Suppose a
State refuses to establish or maintain schools
or to prohibit the teaching of religion in them
how will you enforce the Constitutional amend
ment?" The Cabinet Minister smiled and
said, "Well, I can't answer that. The Presi
dent thought he had hit upon such a devilish
good thiog that he didn't show it to his Cabi
net, and the first I knew about it was when 1
read it in the newspapers."
Colonel Forney writes from London that
Hon. Reverdy Johnson, who is now sojourning
in the Eoglish metropolis, is everywhere sought
and welcomed by the leaders of the Eoglish
bar. His strong, melodious voice, his reten
tive memory, his fund of wit and humor give
to his eloquence a peculiar charm, and it is
difficult to believe, as you mark his erect and
graceful fuure aud listen to his strong and
mauly rhetoric, that he has passed so far be
yond the Psalmist's age. Enjoying life to the
uttermost, food of society, a capital conversa
tional^, a courteous listener, his heart respon
sive to the best feelings of our nature, he is
the centre and charm of every circle. Few
public men caD look back over a career at once
so varied and so honorable.
Judtje Wellford, ot the Richmond City Cir
cuit Court, has appointed Gen. Wickham re

The South Carolina Legislature, which is
overwhelmingly Radical, yesterday elected as
an associate justice of the Supreme Court of
the State a colored, man named Wright, and
the circuit judges, all Republicans. The elec
tion of Wbipper, Wiggin and Moses, the first
for Charleston circuit, the most important in
the State, oreates regret and indignation among
the best class of Republicans and the people of
lite State generally.
It is not too much to say thatthe Democrat
ic majority in the House of Representatives-ot
the l^pited States, hold io their hands the de
termination ot the 'Republic fur many years.
Wisdom, discretion and stati'smenlike tact,
this session, will insure a Democratic triumph
during the Centennial year, and will euable
the country to start upon the second century of
its existence united and free, full of promise of
blessings to our pot-terity, and still a beaoon of
hope to the world.
If, however, personal rivalry shall interfere
with discreet movements, if the meao ambition
which has selt for its object, be substituted tor
that patriotism "that makes ambition virtue,"
history will write of all the Democratic leaders
of to-day : They preferred their own ambition
to the safety of tbeir country, and ruined at
once themselves, and the people who trusted
them.
There has never been a Congressional invest
igation for which there was so little warrant,
as for that which is now proposed by Mr.Mor
too, into the affairs of the State of Mississippi.
There were some election riots, but nothiug
that could,in any material degree, have ohaug-,
ed the result of the election. The Democrats I
have won Mississippi from Radical misrule,and
therefore a pretext to interfere in the local
affairs of the State is gotten up. Mr. Morton
unwittingly disclosed the motive ot bis resolu
tion. "If we let this alone," said Mr. Morton,
"next year the same thing will be done in South
Carolina and Louisiana."
A valued correspondent writes as follows:
"In your just strictures upon the system of
absenteeism from their seats of members of the
Legislature, to the great hindrance of business,
you do uot touch the true sore spot. It is that
petty bribe of free tickets over the railroads
which causes the want ot quorums on Saturday
aud Monday of almost every week. If you can
shame the Legislature iuto passiog a law mak
ing it a misdemeanor at least to give or take this
bribe, yuu will do much to cure the evil."
Now that the Uuited States Senator has
been chosen, it is hoped the Legislature will
go to work; let the code alone and adjourn as
soon as possible. If the members want to
make themselves popular, let them make haste
to get away, and thereby relieve the burdens of
the people by lessening their taxes to that
amount.
The Rockingham Register opposes taxation
of churches, and says : "Until we find con

church memberships, and perverting their
right of exemption from taxation, from relig

laws." _______________

WASHINGTON LETTISH.
[Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.]
Washington D. Cm Dec. 16. -The feature
of the day at the Capitol was the debate in the
Senate, on Mr. Morton's Mississippi resolution,
indulged in on the one side by Mr. Morton, of
Indiana, and on the other, by Messrs. Bayard,
of Delaware, and Thurman, of Ohio. The re
solution provides for the appointment of a
oommittee to investigate alleged frauds at the
late election in Mississippi, by which a radical
majority of twenty-five thousand was overqome
by a like majority for the Democrats, which
Mr. Morton thinks oould not have been done
except through "fraud and intimidation." Of
course, Mr. M. made a specious argument, and
his usual partizao appeal, but was met by Mr.
Bayard with a most overwhelming reply, parts
of which were warmly applauded by the galle
ries. When Mr. Morton told Mr. Bayard that
the politios of Delaware might change, and he
(B.) go under, Mr. Bayard quickly replied
that, should such an event happen and he be
displaoed, he hoped and prayed that no inves
tigating committee would be appointed in his
interest. The ultras are desperate, and it is
Mr. Morton's idea to so legislate as to intimi
date and bring under subjugation again the
Southern States, so as to effeot the Presiden
tial election, and secure the continuation of
Radical rule.
It may be safe to predict, indeed it is already
spoken of, thatshould Morion's resolution pass
the Senate, one of a like character will bo
passed by the House, and a committee of
Northern Democrats appointed to give to the
country a aorrect version of affairs in Missis
sippi. As at present constituted the game be
tween the parties will be a pretty one, with
odds in favor of the House.
The House was not in session to day, and
will only sit for a short time to-morrow, when it
will adjourn for a trip to Philadelphia, at the
invitation of the Centennial Committee, who
will dioe and wine the?morabers liberally and
then, of course, expect a little appropriation to
celebrate the "nation's birthday," and pour in
to the coppers of the city of Brotherly Love
millions. So the world wags now-a-days, and
so some of the members, with delicate con
sciences, looking into the mill-stone, will de
cline to go, but the number of such will be few
?very few. Very little conscience goes a long
way up here 1
Many of the Virginia delegate are abused at
home for not obtaining appointments for each
and every applicant, but when it is considered
that the offices of the House were equally di
vided out among the members, each would
have about one and ahalf, or two, and that, for
each place, there are about two hundred ap
plicants, it will be seen that no blame can be
attached to the representatives, who, to use
the expression ot one of them, have, since the
opening of Congress, been little else than office
>ker<?not a very agreeable position, anc

[Correspondence of tho Alexandria Grzotte.]
Richmond, Dec. 16. 1875.
The adjourned meeting of the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railroad Company was held to-day.
Geo. Williams C. Wickham, the Vice Pres
ideut, read the report of the President, C. P.
Huntington, esq.
The report attributes the small amount of
through business to the waut of a connection
by rail from its western terminus with the
great centres of trade in the Wet, Southwest
and Northwest; to the low rates for freight
which have prevailed during the greater part
of the year on competing lines,and to the finan
cial embarrassments o! the company,which are
well knowu, aud which have induced many
large shippers of freight to seek other routes,
of transportation who would otherwise havu
entrusted this compauy with the transpoita
tioQ of their property.
The report says it was hoped and believed
that the proposition for funding a portion ol
the interest on the mortgage debt, and the
whole of the floating debt into incoma bonds,
would have been acceded to by nearly all, if*
not all, of the bondholders and other creditors,
but after the most patient and earneet efforts
of the officers and financial agents of the com
pany, it is found that a uumber of bondholders
aud other creditors refuse their assent to the
plan proposed, representing au amount suffi
cient to annul the plan. Alter listcniug to and
carefully considering all other plans proposed
by those who would not accede to those pro
posed by the company, the President and
Board of Directors became oouvinced that
none of them wore practicable. When, there
fore, it became evident that tho company could
not pay the interest that would mature on the
first of November, instant, on its six per cent,
mortgage bouds, the Board of Directors ap
pointed a committee of seven of its members,
whose duty it should be to devise a plan for
the reorganization of the company, on a basis
that should be just aud equitable to all inter
ests. To this work the committee gave earnest
and careful atteution, holding meetings almost
every day, and they had nearly agroed upon
the details of a plan for re-orgauizatioo which
it was iuteuded should be submitted to all per
sons interested for their aonsideratiou aud ap
proval. This work of the committee was in
j tcrruptcd in the early part of October by the
action of the Circuit Court of the Uoited
States for the Eastern District of Virgiuia, aud
the District of West Virginia, in appoiuting
Mr. Henry Tysou as t3mporary receiver of the
property, incomes, franchises, etc., of the com
pany.
The report then goes iuto a long statement
ef the facts of the seizure of the road and the
appointment of Tyson as reoeiver, and in this
conncction says:
"Your property is now in his hands, and
subject to bis management, lie is a strauger
to your President aud Board of Directors, aud
so far as they are advised he has no pecuoiary
interest whatever in the property, nor have
either of his sureties, all of whom are non-res
idents of Virginia or West Virgiuia. It does
not appear ju.st and right that a property of
such magnitude and of so great cost should be
taken out of the management and control of
its rightful owners, and be placed in the hands
of a stranger against the expressed wish of so
large a majority of all persons interested in it,
as bondholders, stockholders, and general cred
itors, aud especially as nut a siugle person in
terested in the property asked fur the appoint
ment ol Mr. Tyson."
The report, of General Wickham showed that
the earuiugs of the company lor the past year
ending September last were $1,459,189.48,
and the expenses $1,112,320.70. There was a
decrease of passenger fare amounting t) $43.
749.89, and an iucrease of freight of $43,
550.17.
The report testified to the good order of the
road.
Oq motiou, the old Directors of the company
were re-eleeted.
General Skeen, of Alleghany, offered a res- j
olution approving the action of the courts oi
Virginia and West Virginia in appointing
General Wickham receiver, aud expressing the
hope that he would soon be put in lull posses
sion and control of the road, franchises, <fcc.
The resolution was adopted.
The meeting then adjourned.
Reoeiver Tyson happened to be out of the
oity at the time.
Great consternation was created in the House
to-day by the announcement that. Mr. Seig, of
Highland and Bath,was suffering Irom a case of
genuine smallpox. It is supposed that the
unfortunate gentleman contracted the disease
in the couutry, as Richmond is almost eutirely
free of it. He was stopping at a leading hotel
here, and the intelligence, it. was at first fear
ed, would cause the guests to leave, but upon
being assured that there was no danger the
majority of them remained. He was at ooce
taken to the smallpox hospital. It cannot yet
be ascertained whether he is iu danger.
A large number of couoty treasurers are in
the city paying io their taxes. They propose
having a meeting and memorializing the L"g
islature to alter the present law requiring them
to make their returns by a sertain time.
Whether they will accomplish anything by
this remains to be seen.
The Board of Visitors of the Blacksburg
Agricultural and Mechauical College have been
in session here for several days. One of the
duties incumbent upon them is the appoint
ment of a farmer for the college. There are
almost as many parties lobbying for that place
as there were aspirants for the position of pen
itentiary store keeper. Twenty eight gentle
men have signified iheir entire willingoess to
educate the young mind how to plant pump
kins and squashes. The applicants are all so
polite and accommodating about this trifliug
matter that the Visitors find it difficult to de
cide who shall be the man.
General Williams 0. Wiokham feels himself
profoundly houored by being nominated for U.
S. Senator by the Republican members of the
General Assembly. He deserves a better but.
Taken as a whole the colored element io the
General Assembly is a deoided improvement
on the old crowd there io previous years.

Who Put Out that Fire?
To the editor of the Alexandria Gazette:
Your reporter was, evidentally, nut on hand
at the on Wednesday, or he would not have
said that "the neighbors" put it out. One of
our juniors who went out into the yard discov
ered it, and a woman with a pan of water try
ing to put it out. Mr. Came sent us out to
help her, and we got axes and buckets and got
things straight long before we saw anything of
the firemen, while the neighbors stood by with
their hands in their pockets. Had there not
heea a siok woman in the house we could have
torn it down as scientifically as the Hook and
Ladder Company.

Letter from Loadouu Co.
[Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.]
Leesbuug, Va., Dec. 16, 1875.?Our Board
of Supervisors has been culled by three of tbeir
number to bold a special meeting oo Tuesday
uext to consider importaut matters. What
tbey are it is hard to surmise. Some think it
is to consider the condition of the jail, which
is half tilled by white aud colored crimioals,
and the other halt tilled by one crazy white
man.
I hear further that au iosano daughter of
the late Michael Beamer has beeu confined in
an outhouse for months; that she is io a pitiably
disgustiug condition, but that now, by the
death of her father she is worth several thous
and dollars. The Sheriff, who has beeo order
ed to take charge ot her, has applied in vain
to farmers to take care of her, otferiog to give
any price that uuy three free holders may thiuk
reasonable. There is no room iu the jail uuless
she be put in the same room with the male
lunatic, which is not t) be thought of. It may
be that this matter moves the Supervisors to
oome together. It may be that they come to
gether to consider the condition ot tho poor's
house and the farm attached thereto.
I understand there are forty-nine paupers at
the poor's house, and I believe there are eight
cabins occupied by them, it may be there is a
larger house for some ot them. The farm is
situated io Mercer District about five miles
trorn the Fauquier line, and perhaps seven
from the Clarke line; it contains about 360
acres, and is worth from $30 to $35 per acre,
or say $12 000, the county has, besides, $8,000
let out, making $20,000. It strikes me very
foicibly that (his sum would make a fine sink
ing luud tor bonds to the extent ot $30 000,
to be appropriated to the purchase ot a tarm
and the building of a poor's house, nearClarke's
I Gap, where the roads from thr e districts con
I verge, aud which is much more accessible to
! the other two lower districts, Locsburs and
i Broad lluu, thau the present location, and not
very much more iuconvenient to Mercer Dis
trict. Here the nearness to the railroad would
enable tho paupers to cultivate currents, rasp
berries, strawbc tries, asparagus, and vegetables
generally, and dispose of them readily, and
after a while truits would come ou, which would
make the institution self-supporting. Six per
cent, interest aod one per ci-nt. additional as a
sinking fuod would he $2 100, which would
be a tax of about l? ceuts iu the $100 on
property.
Again, the Board may deem it advisable to
petition the Legislature to cause the tithe of
i 50 oeuts to be applied wholly, to schools, which
would make the head tax $1.50, and should
the amendment to the Constitution be adopted
$2 50. This $2 50 per head ought to produce
$500,000, or perhaps $550,000, it' rigidly col
lected, and thus, to a cousiderable extent relieve
property trom the school tax.
Agaiu, the Board might petition the Legis
lature to cause one-half the taxes ou property
to be oollected by November 1, and the other
half by May 1, tho bead tax being payable all
by Nov. 1, as above, but to do so the Treasur
er should be required to be at his office ail
week days from the time he gets the books to
the 1st of November. This might be supple
mented by a penalty of 10 por cent, on tho halt'
not paid wheu due, or oue per cent, for the first
month, two per oent. for two mottle, and five
percent, for three month's delinquency. This
would avoid risk ineurred by a "peripatetic
treasurer," who has sometimes thousands of
dollars with him, and who offers, by his pub- ,
hc ty of that fact, great temptations to robbery.
It would also do away with the risk now incur
red by placing the money in National Banks,
which may break and cause loss to the Com
monwealth, and leave it io the hands of the
people till it is needed. This rule might be
applied to ail taxes, State, county and muni
oipal. These suggestions are applicable to all
larije counties.

ALIQUIS.
COMMERCIAL.
The money market may be quoted quiet but
stringent, with much complaint on the street of
havd times and a slim prospect for an improve
ment. Fortunately business men are not now
much pressed, and the banks being in good con
dition are abundantly able to afford all necessa
ry accommodation to that class of our commu
nity. In New York money is quiet, and call
loans are quoted at 4*5 per cent. In Baltimore
money continues to be very abundant, and the
rate3 are easy for first class commercial paper.
