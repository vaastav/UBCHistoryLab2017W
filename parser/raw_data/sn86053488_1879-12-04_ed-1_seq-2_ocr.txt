Doth of officers and of the people themselves to
co-operate for their removal. Tbe arave evils
and perils of a partisan spoils system of ap
pointment to office and office tenure are
now. generally rccoimlzed. In the resolu
tions of the Brest parties, in the reports
of Ienartments.nthedeliatesanilnroceelinn-a
of Conirress, in the messages of Executives,
the gravity of these evils has been pointed
out, and the need of their reform has been ad-
nutted.. Totunmand tho uoocssarv suDoort,
every measure of reform must be based on
omninnn right and justice, and .must: be

essential in a free Suite. -When the

stitutions, should l consulted in the policy
which it is their duty to carry into effect, is in-dtspensahlc.--
It Is eminently proper that they
should explain It before the people, as well as

Their responsibility is to their superi
ors in oIkmhI position.. It is their duty to
obey the legal instructions of those upon
whom that authority is devolved, and their best
pul.lic service consists in the discharge of
their ftination trrespective of -partissn pol-
ftk'S. Thoir -duties are the same whatever
Sparry is- in' power, and" whatever -poMey pre
vails. As a consequence, it follows that their
tenure of office should not depend upon tbo
prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of
any party, but should bs determined by their
capacity to serve the people most usefully .qtite

Tr fail so provide suon moiiiis is not only
to denv the opptirtunity of ascertaining; the
facta inn which the most righteous claim to
office depends, but of necessity to discourage
all worthy aspirants by handing- over ap

and favoritism. If it is the right of the
worthiest claimant to gain the-appointment,
-and tbe interest of the people to bestow it
upon him, it would seem cleat that a wise
and just method of ascertaining per
sonal fitness for office; must needs be
an important and permanent function
of every Just and wise Government. It bas
long since become impossible in the great of
fices for those having the duty of nomination
and appointment to personally examine ii.to
the Individual qualifications of more than a
small proportion of tbie seeking office, and
with the enlargement of Civil Service that pro
portion must coot inne to liccmno less. In the
earlier years of the Government tbe subordi
nate offices were so few 111 number that it was
quite easy for those niakingiippointmonts and
promotions to personally ascertain the merits
of candidates. Party uianaa-ers and methodj
hud not then become powerful agents of co
ercion hostile to the free mid just exercise of
the appointing power. A large and respon
sible part of the duty of restoring tho Civil
Service to the desired purity and efficiency
rests upon the President ; and it. has been my

methods employed, and several ol them have
publicly attested their favorable opinion.
Upon such considerations :I . deem '. M
my duty to renew . the , recommenda
tion contained In my annual message ol
Di.oo.iT! tier. 177, requesting Congress to make
the necessary appropriations for ihe resump
tlon of tbe work of the Civil-Service Commis
sion. , Economy will be promoted by author
izing a moderate compensation to persons in
the public servico who may perform extra
llor upon or under the Commission as th
Executive may direct. I am convinced thai
if a Just and adequate test of merit be en
forced for admission to tho public serv
ice, and in making proniot ions,
such abuses as removals without
good cause and partisan and oili
rial interference with the proper exercises ol
tho appointing power will in large measure
Nnppear. There are other administrative
abuses to which tho attention of Congress
should be asked in thisconnection. Mere par
lisan appointments and tbe constant peril ol
removal without cause very naturally lead tc
an absorbingnnd mischevioiis political activity
on the part of those thus appointed. wblchnot
only interferes with the due discharge of offi
cial duty, but is incompatible with the freedom
of elections. Not vitbout warrant .n the view ol
several of my predecessors in the President iai
ofiice.and directly in accordance with the law ol
171 already cited, 1 rndoavored, by regulation
made on th-s 22d'of June, 1S77. to put some
reasonable limits to such abuses.,- It may not
be easy, and it may never, perhaps, be neces
sary, to define with precision tbe proper liniil
of political action on the part of Federal offi
cers. But while their right to hold and freely
express their opinions cannot be questioned,
it is very plal.i that tboy should neither b
allowed to devote to other subjects
tho time needed for the proper dis
charge of their official duties, nor to use the
authority of their office to enforce their own
opinions, or to coerce the political action ot
those who hold different opinions. Reasons ol
lustice Hnd public policy quite analogous to
those which forbid tho U3e of olliieial iower
for the oppression of the private -citizen im
pose upon the Government the duty of pro
tecting its officers and agents from arbitrary
exactions. Tn whatever aspect . considered,
tho practice of making levies for paxty pur
poses upon the salaries of officers is highly de
moralizing to the public servico and discredit
able to the country. Tbough an oilicei
should be as free as any other citi-zen to
give his - own money in aid of his
opinions or his party, . he should also be as
free as any other citizen to refuse to make
such gilts! If salaries are but a fair compen
sation for the time and labor of the officers, it
is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If
they are made excessive in order that they
may bear the tax, tho excess is an indirect
robbery of the public funds. I recommend,
therefore, such a revision and extension of
the present statutes as shall secure to those in
every grade of official life or public employ
ment the protection with which a great and
enlightened Nation shall guard those who are
faithful in its service.

Our relations with foreign countries havo
continued peaceful. With Great Britain
there aro still unsettled questions, growing
out of tbe local laws of tbe maritime prov
inces, and tho action of provincial authori
ties deemed to be in derogation of rights so
cored by treaty to American fishermen. Tbo
United States Minister in London has been
instructed to present a demand for $lo5,:ja".(i2
in view of the damages rcceitod by American
citizens at Fortune Bay on theflth day of Janu
ary, lb. it. ihe sunject has been taken into
consideration by the British Government, and
an early reply is anticipated. Upon the -enm-pletion
of the necessary preliminary examin
ation, the subject of our participation in tbo
provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty,
will at once be brought to the attention of
the British Government -with a view to an
early and permanent settlement of the whole
? nest Ion, which was only temporarily ad
usted by the Treaty of Washington. Efforts .
have, -been mad to obtain the removal
of restrictions found injurious' to the
exportation of cattle to- the United Kingdom.
Some correspondence has also occurred with
regard to the rescue and -saving of life and
property upon the lakes, which has resulted in
important modifications of the previous regu
lations oi the Dominion Government on this
subject, in tbe interest of humanity and com
merce. In accordance with the Joint resolution of
the last session of Congress, Commissioners
were appointed to represent the United States
at the two International Exhibitions in Aus
tralia, one of which is now in progress at Syd
ney, and the other to be held next
year at Melbourne. A desire has been ex-
f.resscd by our merchants and manufacturers
ntcrested In the Important and growing trado
with Australia that an increased provision
should tic made by Congress for the represen
tation of our industries at tho Melbourne Ex
hibition of next year, and the subject is re

The assent cf the Government has been
given to the landing on tbo coast of Massa
chusetts of a new and independent transat
lantic cable between Franco (by way of the
Vrench Island of St. Pierre) and this country,
subject to any, future legislation of CongresJ
on the subject.' The conditions .imposed, bo
fore allowing this .connection with our.shorcs
to be established, are such 1 as 'to secure
its' competition 'with any existing or
future lines of marine - cable, and pre
clnde amalgamation therewith, and to pro
vide for entire1 equality of rights to our
Government and people with those of
Krunce iii tho use of the cable, and prevent
any exclusive p. session of the privilege as
accorded bv France to tbedisadvantntfe of nny ,
future oahio communication between Prance
and the United States which may be projected
and accomplished by our citizens. An in. i
portant reduction of the present rates of com
muuication with Europe, felt to bo too burden
some to the inteivsts of our commerce, must j
necessarily How from the establishment of this 1
competing line. The iittenll m of tVwtsrress
was drawn to the propriety of some general
regulation, by Congress of the whole subject
of transmarine cables' by mV predecessor in

The questions of grave Importance with

soon bo utile to l.ruig its lanora to a con
clusion. The long-standing' question of tho
East Florida claims bus lately been renew ;h1
as a subject of comwpondeiicc, and may pos
sibly require Cong.essional action for Its hnal

fcs.muouestions with Switzerland in regard
to pauper and convict emigrants have arisen,
but it is not doubted that they will bcarrantreJ
upon a just and satisfactory basis. A ques

to. exercise tutelage over thi persons and
property of Swiss citizen naturalized in fhls
country- ' Mia possible this may require ad
justment by treaty. With tbe-Germnn Em

In consequence of the omission of Congress
to provide for a diplomatic representative at

There is now no channel of diplo

between Egypt aud tbe United States.
The action of the Egyptian Government in

. The treaty recently madebetweeu Japanand
the United States in regard to the revision of
f orwi or commercial treaties, it is now believed,
will be followed by similar action on the part
ot other Treaty Powers. The attention of Con
rress is again invited to the subject of the In
demnity funds received some years since from
Japan and China, which, with their accural.
latcd interest, now amount to considerable
sums. If any part of those funds is justly due
to American citizens, they should receive it
promptly, and whatever may have- been
received by this Government In excess of strict

turned to tbe nations to whom it equitably be

IU willingness to consider the question of the

with a dispassionate f aimtss, and to co-operate
in such measures as may tend to prevent
injurious consequences - to the Unit

under the instructions of their re

Mexico under the Claims Commission of July

of Congress the provision of suitable legisla

Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is
'again fully restored by the arrival ef the
Minister from that country to tho United
States. ' This is especially fortunate in view of
the fact that the question of an intor-oceanic
canal has recently assumed anew and impor
tant aspect and is now under discussion with
the Cent ral A mnricun countries, through whose
territory the canal by the Nicaragua route
would have to pass. It is trusted that enlight
ened statesmanship .on their part wiii see
that the' -early prosecution of such a
work will largely inure to the ben
efit, not only of their own. citizens, and those
f f the United States, but of the commerce of
tne clvilizl. world. It Is not doubted that.
should the work be undertaken under the pro
tective auspices of th'! United States, and
upon siitistiietory concessions for the right of
way and its security by the Central American
Governments, the capital for its completion
would readily tie furnished from this country
and Europe, which might, failing such guar

the reception of a Minister from that eountrv.
The war between Peru. Bolivia -mid. Chili

ALASKA.
The third article of the treaty with Russia of
March l, l.W, by which Alaska was ceded to
the United States, provides that the inhab
itants of the ceded territory, with the excep
tion of the uncivilized native tribes, shall be
admitted to the enjoyment of all tne rights of
citizens of the United States, and shall be
maintained and protected In the free enjoy
ment of their liberty, of property and re
ligion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to
such laws and regulations as the United
States may from time to time adopt
in regard to tbe aborieinal tribes of
that country. Both the obligations of this
treaty and the necessities of the people require
that some organized form of government over
the Territory of Alaska bo adopted. There
appears to bo no law for the arrest of person
charged witn common law onenses, sucn as

'The appropriation for judicial expenses,
heretofore made for the Department of
Justice in gross, was subdivided at the last ses
sion of Congress, and no appropriation what
ever was made for the pavment of the fees of
Narshals and thoir deputies, either in the ser
vice of process or for the discharge of other
duties, and since June 30 these officers have
continued the performance of their dirties
without compensation from the Government,
taking upon themselves tne necessary inci-
nentai . outlays, as wen as re. menu
thi'ir own services. In only a fe
rendering
unavoidable instances has the proper
execution of the process of the united
States tailed by reason of tho absence of the
requisite appropriations. This course of offi
cial conduct on the part of the officers, highly
creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the
Attornev-Geneni1, who informed tbem, how
ever, that they would necessarily have to rely
for their compensation upon tho prospect ol
future legislation by Congress. I therefore
especially recommend thot immediate appro
priation be made by Congress tor this pur-
pose. The act making the principal approprla-
tion tor tne Department oi jusiice ui prt .una
sessions has uniformly contained the follow-
inir clause: "And for defraying the expenses
which tnav be incurred in the enforcement ol
the act approved Feb. 2s, 1870, entitled 'An act
to amend an act approved May 3U, 1S70," en
titled 'An act to enforce the right of citizens
nf the United Suites to vote in tbe several
i-tatesof the United States, and for other purposes,'-er
any acts amendatory thereof or
supplementary thereto." No appropriation
was . made r for " this purpose for the
rurrtnt . .year. As no general elec
tion for inem-liers - of Congress o.x-urrcd,
the omission was a matter of 1: :1c prac
tical importance. Such t lection w.ll,-
however, take place dm ing the ensuing year,
and tho appropriation niado for the pay of
Marshals and I leputies should lie sufficient to
embrace compensation lor the services t hey
may be n quired to perform lit such election.
The business of the Supreme Court in at pres

thnt -more cunes can- be decided

Iu the courts of iiuuij' of the circuits also ths

Ihe cieliiy of Justiue will call the attention of
Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is be
lieved that ail is dune in each circuit wbicb

The evils iirisinir from delay are less heavily felt
by the United Stato9 than by private suitors, as
its causes are advanced by the eourts, when it
Is seen that they involve the discussions nf
questions of a public character. The remedy
suggested by the Attorney-4ieneral is the ap
pointment of additional Circuit Judges, and
the creation of nn intermediate Court of Er
rors and Appeals, which shall relieve the
Supreme Court of a part of its jurisdiction,
while a larger force is also obtained for the
performance of circuit duties. I recommend
this suggestion to the consideratkm of Con
gress. It would seem to afford a complete
remedy, and would involve, if ten additional
Circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure
at the present rate of salaries of not more than
JOO.OOJ ti year, which would certainly be small

f378,4OT.K3 was paid on liabilities ihcurr.il in
preceding years. The expenditures during
the year were snl.2i.7 less than in the pre

tributed mainly to the operation of the law

tion of Postmasters from a commission

and as also calculated to remove those obj
Itructious, which the existence of large reser
vations presents to the settlement and devel
opment of the country. I therefore earnestly
recommend the enactment of a law enabling
the Government to give Indians a title in fee
inalienable for twenty-five years to the farm
lands assigned to them by allotment. -1 also
repeat the recommendation in my first annual
message tnat a law be passed admitting In
dians who can give satisfactory proof of 'hav
ing, by their own labor, supported thoir fami
lies for a nutiitx rof years, and who are will
ing W detach themselves from their tribal re
lations, to the benefit of the Homestead act,
and to grant them patents containing the seme
provision of inalienability for a certain period.
tne experiment oi senuing a nnnioeroi
Indian children of both sexes to the Hampton
Normal and Agricultural Institute In Virginia,
to receive elementary i-.ngusn eaucanon ana
practical instruction in farming and other
useful industries, has led to results so promis
ing that it was thought expedient to turn over
tbe cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsyl
vania, to the Interior Department for the
establishment of nn Indian school on a larger
scale. , This School has now ISH pupils, selected
from various tribes, and is in full operation.
Arrangements are also made for tbe educa
tion of a number of Indian boys and girls be
lontring to tribes on tne raeinc slope in a f mil
lar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These
institutions will commend themselves te tbe
liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic
touni licence ot tne American people.
Last spring Information was received of the
organization of sn extensive movemaut in the
Western States, the object of which was the
occupation by unauthorized persons of cer
tain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by
tieCherokecstotbeGovernnirnt for the pur
nose of settlement bv other Indian tribes.
I On tbe 2-nbof April 1 issued a proclamation
i warning all persons sirainst participation in
such an ?g"l
a military force the i ynsion was Promptly
rights ofthe Indian inhabitantsof that Territo
ry to tbe full extent of tbe Executive; but it
would be unwise to ignore the fact that a
Territory so large and so fertile, with a popu
lation so soiree. nd so si-eat a wealth of un
usued resources, will be found more exposed
to the repetition of such attemps as hp
nened this vear when the surrounding States
Vlir. kcu- A. 1 o ui r ..ill v. ... ... . . 11.,
were most densely settb'd, aud the westward
movement of our population looted tiii more
eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under
sucn circumstances the difficulty of main
taining the Indian Territory in its present
state will greatly increase, and the Indian
trills Inhabiting' it would do well to prepare
for such a contingency. I, therefore, f.illy
approve of the advice given to them by
the Secretary of the Interior on a reo-nt oc
casion to divide among themselves, in sever
alty, as large a quantity of their lands as they
can cultivate, to acquire individual title in
fee. instead of their present tribal ownership
in common, and consider in what manner the
balance of their lands may be ril.-rposed of by
the Croverninent for tneir tienelit. lly adopt
ing such a policy they would more certainly
secure for themselves the value of their pos
sessions, and at the same time promote their
nroirressin civilization aud prosiftcrity than
by endeavoring to perpetuate the preseut
HBtool tbingsinrne lerntorj.
The ipiestmn whether a chantre in tne con- ;
trol of tiie Indian service should l inude was,
in the Port? -fifth Congress n-ferred to a.b.int

consisfs in the fact that the destruction of our

ofthe p.'pul.uion cannot, under the present
state of tbe law, be otherwise obtained.
I therefore earnestly invite the at
tention of Congress to the recommenda
tion made by the Secretary of the
Interior, that a law be enacted enabling the
Government to sell timber from the public
lands without conveyinir the fee where such
lands are principally valuable for tho timber
