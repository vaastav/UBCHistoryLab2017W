The President'? message reviewi
the controversy which led to the wal
with Spain and discusses the military
and naval operations and the incas
UTOS which were taken to prosecute
the wart" asucoewful close. It will
prove a distinct dioapp ihitmenl to
those who expected that it would
fully outline the policy of the Ad?
ministration in regard to territorial
acquisition and other important issues
connected with the war with Spain.
The President makes no recom?
mendations in regard to the future oi
our new poaseaaiona or the form of
gove nrneiit to be established therein.
Discussion of thia subject, the Presi?
dent says, will be appropriate after
the treaty of peace shall he ratified.
'?In the meantime, and until Congres*
bas legislated otherwise," he wil
"continue the military governments
which have existed since our occupa?
tion, and give 10 the people security
in life a id property aiul ctfourage
inent under a jiwt and hvncfiocUl
rule."
A*to Cuba the President Mate*
that "as soon as we are in post I
nii.1 have pacificil the island, it will be
necsMsen '" Pve **dl n"'^ directkm t<
its ??eoplc to form a government for
tberii.M.-lves. This shouhl be under?

In reapect to eurruncy reform ihe
sident says; "In my judgment
the pre-? ut condition of the treiimry
amply justifie* the immediate cnatt
nieiit ot the legiithition recoinniond,.!
a year ago, under which a po tion of

??tient fur ?old. it is not In In. ,,._
ferrad that other l?gislation rehttii

the contrary there is an obvious C
ma "1 for ii.''
The reoommi ndut.oua made by t
Secretaey of War for the increase
the regular standing army has t
President's hearty approval. "The
cm le no question," ho ?lu-lan
-thai at this time and probably t
some time in the future 100,00(1 ne

u c --iiies of the situation. At :

limit from the inhabitants of il
j islands with the government ofwhi?
I wc are charged.'1 The Pree.don1 ad?
that it is his purpose "to muster 01
i the entire volunteer army as soon ;
Congress shall provide for the iiicrcai
of the regular establishment.'"
The President also gives his in
dorse ment lothe recommends! iona?
lie-Secretary of the Navy ulativ
to the increase ef the navy. Seen
tary Long recommends that the cm
?traction of the following warships b
authorised: Three battle ships t
Tl,."tl() tins displacement, to col
13,600,000 each; tluce armored cruii
?is of 12,000 tons displacement,at a:
estimated cost of 14,000,000 -act
three protected cruiser?of 6,000 ton
displacement, to rort$2J~ri),000cael
and six cruisers ot' 2,500 toil*, at
cost of $1,141,800 each. Th)
malts do not include the ims| of ai
mor and armament.
President McKinley also join
Secretary Long in reeommendinj
that the grades of admiral and vice
admiral be temporarily revived, "u
bo filled by officer? who have special
ly 'listingiii-hed tlicmselves in th?
war with Spaia."
The President urges upon Congreai
the importance of c".rly legislntioi
providing tor the taking of the twelfth
census. Ho points out that during
tin- fiscal year a total of $1I8,082,8M
waa ' Upended in the payment ofpen
sions. The total receipts of the pat?
ent office were 11,258,948, and the
receipts from the sale of public lands
$i,277,09ft. He recommends nn ap?
propriation to celebrate the onc-hun?
dredtfa anniversary of the founding of
the city of Washington for the per?
manent capital of the government of
t.'.e United States.
The alien contract law, he say s is
shown by eiperience to need some
nmemdment; a measure providing bet?
ter protection tor acumen is proposed,
and "the rightful application of the
eight-hour law for the benefit of labor,
and the application of the principle of
arbitiation, are suggested for consid?
eration."
The annexation of Hawaii and the
changed relations of the United
States to Cuba, Porto Rico and the
Philippines render il necessary, in tie
President's opinion, for the United
States io adopt a maritime policy.
"There should Le established," he
says, '-regular ami frequent steamship
communication, encouraged by the
United States, under the American
rlic. with the newlv acouircd col- '
oiiies," The President renew- hil
recommendation that Congres* nu
thorite the nppointment of a commis
sioii tor the purpose of making a sys
tnatic investigation with reference to
the cau^e and prevention ot yellow
fever. The sanitary problems con?
nected with the islands are of no less
importance, he says, than those relat?
ing to finance,commerce and admin?
istration,
In commenting upon the develop?
ments of the postal service the Presi?
dent remarks that ''within twenty
years both the revenue* and the ex?
penditures of the Post office Depart?
ment have multiplied three-fold."
Discussing our foreign relations,
the President states that the United
St.-it.s minister at Constantinople has
been instructed to "press for a just
ret t lenient of our claims of indemnity
by fi asmi of tbe destruction of the
property of American citizens resident
in that country during the Armenian
trouble of leX">, as well as for the
recognition of older claims of eqnal
?is ice.'' The arbitral tribunal ap?
pointed under the treaty of February
".', l^'.l?, between Great Britain and
Venezuela, to determine the bound
?iry line between the latter and Ilriiisli
Guiann,will meet in Pari* this month.
Tin: President states that "it is a
SOnrce of much gratification to this
government to see the friendly re?
sort of arbitration applied to the
settlement of this conl rovci -?y."' The
interpr?tation of certain provisions
lof the extradition treaty of Deeciu

\ which is abonl the war, the event

It the sentiment in Congress is repre
j seiilative of that of the country, tun
it uaunlly i> the message will be gen
, orally commended.
While the legislation of the sessioi
of Congress, which opened today
1 will have little direct connection will
? the newly acquired territory of th<
country, several of the regular ap
propriation bills, notably those foi
tic army and for the Navy, as wel
as the bill for the increase of the reg,
ular army, will furnish texts loi
many speeches on that subject, ami
the talk of Senat ors and Representa
tives indicated an intention to take
full advantage of those texts. CotUM
quently the debates of the present
?cs?ioil are expected to be unusually
lively and interesting.
Secretary Alger says, in his annual
report, in favor of his recommends?
thin that it be provided in the legisla
lion for increasing the regular army
t" leii,0(Hl nun, thai natives ot islands
occupied by our troops may be en?
listed:" These men are .acclimated,
understand the language and habits
of their countrymen, and their enlist?
ment m ill not only give them employ?
ment, but also have the tendency to
enable the irovemment to get into
closer touch with their people than
it would otherwise lie able to do.
This would also relieve our own men
from serving in those climates to a
large extent, and would, moreover,
('liable the Volunteer? to he mustered
out of the service and return to the
avocation'?" of civil life." That last
sentence will do mote to hurry army
legislation than any other one thing.
Every Senator and Representative is
besieged with requests to get this or
lbal regiment of volunteers mustered
out, ami they all know that no con
sidorabV number of the volunteers
will be ordered mustered out until
Col greM provides for the enlistment
of regulars to take their places. It is
believed that this peculiar situation
will keep men ouiet who otherwise
would bitterly oppose the bill provid?
ing for the increase of the regular
army.
lor Hale sees nothing but
trouble and expense m the annexa
lion of the Philippines, and declares
his intention to figbj th* ratification
of tbe treaty of pesos to the full ex?
tent of his ability, regardless of what
otber Senators may do. Mr. Hale'a
picture? of the calamities likely to
follow the ratification of the treaty of
peace would be truly awful if he could
make everybody see through his eyes.
B'it it has not been forgotten lhat
Mr. Hale drew some very weird pic
lures of what would happen to this
country if it dared to make war on
Spain, which were ;i long ways from
what actually did happen; there?
fore his doleful talk isn't fetching any
tears of alarm.
The probability of Nicaragua Canal
legislation is going to he a good
thing for W: shington hotel kecjiers,
this winter, and it maybe that some
?npecunconi statesmen who will be
dropped from Uncle Sam's pay roll
at the close of the present Congress,
will also handle some of the Panama
Canal Company's money, which it is
understood will he liberally spent to
block Nicaragua Canal legislation.
Tin. House ?g the doubtful body; the
Senate is known to be overwhelming?
ly favorable to the ?'onstrucioti of
the Nicaragua Canal by this govern?
ment. There are signs that the ad?
ministration will use its influence up?
on the House in favor of canal legis?
lation.
