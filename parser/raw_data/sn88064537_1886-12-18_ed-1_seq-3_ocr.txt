Interesting Synopsis of a Lengthy
Public Document.
Oar Foreign anil Domestic Relations Re
viewed -The TariiT and Silver yuoa
tio.u, and Others of Equal Gen
eral Interest Discussed.
Washington , Dec. r. —President Cleveland's
message opens with tho usual survey of for
eign relations, and one-third of the document is
devoted to discussion and review of this im
portant topic. Our Government, he says,
has consistently maintained its relations of
friendship toward all other powers, and a
neighborly interest toward those whose posses
sions are contiguous to our own. Few ques
tions have arisen during the past year with
other governments and none of those are be
yond the leach of settlement in friendly
council.
j The cruel treatment of inoffensive Chinese in
' the far West, is alluded to, and in speaking of a
remedy he says the paramount duty of main
taining public order and defending the interests
of our own people may require the adoption of
measures of restriction, but they should not
tolerate the oppression of individuals of a spe
cial race.
Discussing the fisheries question, so long a
subject of anxious difference between the
United States and Great Britain, the President
says the questions involved are of great
consequence, cad from time to time,
for nearly three-quarters of a century, have
given rise to earnest international discussions,
not unaccompanied by irritation. Temporary
arrangements by treaties have served to allay
friction which, however, has revived as each
treaty was terminated. While desirous that
friendly relations should exist between the
people of Hie United States and Canada, the
•action of Canadian officials during the past
season towards our fishermen has been
such, the President thinks, as to threaten
their continuance: and although disappointed
> in his efforts to secure a satisfactory settlement
of the question, negotiations are still pending
"With reasonable hope that before the close of
the present session of Congress the announce
ment may be mri.de that an acceptable conclu
sion has be.?n reached.
Alluding to our relations with Hawaii, the
President recommends an extension for seven
years of the reciprocity treaty of 1875. He ur
gently renews his recommendation of legisla
• tion to carry into erect the American recipro
city treaty of January. 1883, and proposes to
int'iate negotiations with Mexico for a new and
enlarged treaty of commerce and legislation.
Referring to the Cutting case, he says the in
cident has disclosed a claim of jurisdiction by
Mexico novel in cur history, whereby an offense
committed any where by a foreign penal in the
place of its commission, and of which a Mexi
can is tho object, may, if the offender be found
in Mexico, be there tried and punished in con
formity with Mexican laws. This jurisdiction
■was sustained by the courts of Mexico and ap
proved by the executive branch of that Govern
ment upon tho authority of a Mexican statute.
The Appellate Court, in releasing Mr. Cutting,
decided that abandonment of the complaint by
the Mexican citizen aggrieved by the alleged
crime (a libelous publication), removed the
basis of further prosecution, and also declared
justice to have been satisfied by the enforce
ment of a small part of the original sentence.
•The admission of such a pretense, the President
argues, would be attended with serious results,
invasive of tho jurisdiction of this Government,
and highly dangerous to our citizens in for
eign lands; therefore, he has denied it, and
protested against its attempted exercise as
unwarranted by the principles of law and inter
rational usages. A sovereign has jurisdiction
of offenses, which take effect in his territory,
although concocted or commenced outside of it,
but the right is denied of any foreign sovereign
•to punish a citizen of the United States for an
offense consummated on our soil in violation of
our laws, even though the offense be against
» subject or citizen of such foreign sovereign.
The Mexican statute in question makes the
claim broadly, and the principle, if conceded,
•would make a dual responsibility in the citizen
and lead to inextricable discussion destructive
of that certainty in the law which is an es
sential of liberty.
When citizens of the United States volun
tarily go to a foreign country they must abide
% by the laws there in force and must not be pro
. tècted by their own government, from the consé
quence of an offense against those laws com
mitted in such foreign country, bait watchful
care and interest of this Government over its
citizens are not relinquished because they have
gone abroad, and, if charged with crime com
mitted in the foreign land, a fair and open trial,
conducted with decent regard for justice and
humanity, will be demanded for them. With
less than that the Government will not be con
tent when the life or liberty of its citizens is at
t/ Stake.
What other degree to which extra-territorial
criminal jurisdiction may have been formerly
allowed by consent and reciprocal agreement
among certain of the European States, no
such doctrine or practice was ever known to
the laws of this country« n <>r to that from
•which our institutions have been mainly de
^irTthe case or Mexico, there are reasons espe
cially strong for perfect harmony in the mutual
exercise of jurisdiction. Nature has made us
irrevocably neighbors, and wisdom and' kind
feeling should make us friends. The overflow
«f capital and enterprise from the United
States is a potent factor in assisting the devel
opment of the recources of Mexico and in
building up the prosperity of both
• countries. To assist this good work all
grounds of apprehension for the security of
person and property should be removed, and
the President trusts that in the interests of
good neighborhood the statute referred to will
be so modified as to eliminate the present pos
sibilities of danger to the peace of the two coun
tries.
The President recommends the placing of the
consular system on a better footing, and reiter
ates the necessity of some mode of inspection
and report of the manner Sn which the con
sulates are conducted.
He trusts the subject of an International
copyright will receive the attention it deserves
by Congress. ... , .
He recommends that provision be made for
the immediate discharge from custody of per
sons committed for extradition where the
President is of opinion that a sur
render should not be made, and re
news his recommendation of last year
that legislation concerning citization and
naturalization be revised. We have, he says,
treaties with many States providing for the re
nunciation of citization by naturalized aliens,
but no statute is found to give effect to such
> engagements, nor any which provides a needed
control or a bureau for registration of natural
ized citizens.
Reaching domestic affairs, the first subject
discussed is the tariff, and to this the President
devotes a great deal of space, arguing that the
necessity for a reduction of the tariff is more
urgent than ever. '"The income of the Govern
ment," he snys, "by its increased volume and
thorough economies in its collection, is now
more than ever in excess of the public neces
4 sities. The application of the surplus to the
payment of such portion of the
public debt as is now at our o ption
subject to extinguishment, if continued at the
rate which has lately prevailed, would retire
■that class of indebtedness within less than one
year from this date. Thus a continuance of our
present revenue system would soon result in the
receipt of an annual income much greater than
necessary to meet Government expenses,
■with no indebtedness upon which it
could be applied. We should be
then confronted with a vast quantity of money,
the circulating medium of the people, hoarded
in the treasury when it should be in their hands,
or we should be drawn into wasteful public ex
travagance, with all the corrupting National
demoralization which follows in its track.
But it is not the simple existence of this sur
Ïilus and it3 threatened attendant evils which
urnish the strongest argument against our
present scale of Federal taxations ; its worst
phase is the exaction of such a surplus through
a perversion of the relations between the peo
ple and their government, and a dangerous de
parture from the rules which limit the
right of Federal taxation. Good gov
ernment, and especially the govern
ment of which every American citizen
boasts, has for its objects the protection of
every person within its care in the greatest
liberty consistent with the good order cf so
ciety and his perfect security in the enjoy
tneiit. of his earnings, with the least possible
diminution km public needs. V. lien more of

the people's substance ig exacted through the
forms of taxation than is necessary to
meet the just obligations of the Government
and the expense of its economical administra
tion, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion
and a violation of the fundemental principles of
a free Government.
The indirect manner in which these exactions
are made has a tendency to conceal their true
character and extent, but we have arrived at a
stage of supelluous revenue which has aroused
the' people to a realization of the fact
that the amount raised professedly
for the support of the Government is paid bj
them as absolutely, if added to the price of
things which supply their daily wants, as if it
was paid at lixed periods into the hand of the
taxgathcrer.
Those who toil for daily wages are beginning
to understand that capital, though sometimes
vaunting its importance and clamoring for the
protection and favor of the Government, is dull
and sluggish till, touched by the magical hand of
labor, it springs into activity, furnishing an oc
casion for Federal taxation and gaining the
value which enables it to bear its burden, and
the laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring
whether, under these circumstances, and con
sidering the tributes he pays in the treasury as
he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair
share of advantages.
There is also a suspicion abroad that the sur
plus of our revenues indicates abnormal and
exceptional business profits which, under the
system which produces such surplus, increase,
without corresponding benefit to the people at
large, the vast accumulations of a few among
our citizens whose fortunes, rivaling the wealth
of the most favored in anti-democratic na
tions, are not a natural growth ia a steady,
plain and industrious republic.
Our farmers, too, and those engaged directly
und indirectly in supplying the products of
agriculture, see that day by day, and as often
as the daily wants of their household recur,
they are forced to pay excessive and needless
taxation, while their products struggle in for
eign markets with the competition of nations
which, by allowing a freer exchange of
productions than we permit, enable
their people to sell for j>riees
which distress the American farmer. As
every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly
increasing greatness of our people in American
citizenship, and in the glory of our National
achievements and progress, the sentiment pre
vails that the leading-strings useful to a nation
in its infancy may be well to a great extent dis
carded in the present stage of American
ingenuity, courage and fearless self-reliance,
and for the privilege of indulging this
sentiment with true American enthusiasm, our
citizens are quite willing to forego an idle sur
plus in the public treasury. And all the people
know that the average Federal taxation upon
imports is to-day, in time of peace, but little
less, while upon some articles of necessary
consumption it is actuijly more, than was im
posed by the grievous burden willingly borne at
a time when the Government needed millions
to maintain by war the safety and integrity of
the Union.
It has been the policy of the Government to
collect the principal part of its revenues by a
tax upon imports and no change in this policy
is desirable. But the present condition of af
fairs constrains our people to demand that by a
revision of our revenue laws the receipts of the
Government shall be reduced to the necessary
expense of its economical administration, and
this demand should be recognized and obeyed
by the people's representatives in the legis
lative branch of the government.
In readjusting the burden? of Federal taxa
tion, a sound public policy requires that such
of our c'tizens as have built up large and im
portant industries under the present conditions
should not be suddenly, and to their injury, de
prived of advantages to which they have adapt
ed their business; but if the public good re
quires, it they should be content with such con
sideration as shall deal fairly and cautiously
with their interests, while the just demand
of the people for relief from needless taxation
is honestly answered. A reasonable and timely
submission to such a demand should certainly
be possible without disastrous shock to any in
terest; and a cheerful concession sometimes
averts abrupt and heedless action, often the
outgrowth of impatience and delayed justice.
Due regard should be also accorded in any
proposed readjustment of the tariff to the in
terests of American labor, so far as they are In
volved.
We congratulate ourselves that there is
among us no laboring class, fixed within un
yielding bounds, and doomed under conditions
to the inexorable fate of daily toil. We recog
nize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the
Republic; and we treat those who have it ia
their keeping as citizens entitled to care
ful regard and thoughtful attention. This
regard and attention should be award
ed them, not only because labor is
the capital of our workingmen, just
ly entitled to its share of Government favor,
but for the further and not less important rea
son that the laboring man, surrounded by his
family in his humble home, as a consumer, ia
vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost
of living and enables him to bring within hi«
domestic circle additional comforts and ad
vantages. This relation of the workingman to
the revenue laws of the coantry.and the manner
>n which it palpably influences the question of
wages, should not be forgotten in the justifiable
prominence given to the proper maintenance of
the supply and protection of well-paid labor.
And these considerations suggest such an ar
rangement of government revenues as shall re
duce the expense of living while it does not
curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the
compensation of American labor, or injuriously
affect its condition and the dignified place it
holds in the estimation of our people.
But our farmers and agriculturists—those
who from the soil produce the things consumed
by all—are perhaps more directly and plainly
concerned than any other of our citizens in a
just and careful system of Federal taxation.
Those acutually engaged and more remotely
connected with this kind of work number
nearly one half of our population. None labor
harder and more continuously than they. No
enactments limit their hours of toil and no in
terposition of the Government enhtnees to any
great extent the value of their products. And
yet, for many of the necessaries and comforts of
life which the most scrupulous economy en
able them to bring into their homes, and for
their implements of husbandry, they are
obliged to pay a price largely increased by an
unnatural profit which, by the action of the
Government, is given to the more favored man
ufacturer.
I recommend that, keeping in view all these
considerations, the increasing and unnecessary
surplus of National income annually accumu
lating be released to the people by an amend
ment to our revenue laws which shall cheapen
the price of the necessaries of life and give
freer entrance to such imported materials as
by American labor may be manufactured into
marketable commodities. Nothing can be ac
complished, however, in the direction of this
much-needed reform unless the subject is ap
proached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the
interests of the entire country and with a will
ingness to yield something for the public good.
While on the subject of tariff and revenue the
President especially directs the attention of
Congress to the recommendations of the Secre
tary of the Treasury touching the simplifica
tion and amendment of laws relating to the col
lection of the revenues.
Less space is devoted to the silver question
this year than last, but his opposition to compul
sory coinage is no tess pronounced. Tne itirier
ence in the bullion price of the standard dollar
—94!{ cents—when first coined, and its bullion
value—78 cents—on the 30ih of last November,
certainly does not indicate, the Presi
dent says, that compulsory coinage by
the Government enhances the price of that
commodity or secures uniformity in its value.
He has seen no reason to change the views ex
pressed a year ago on the subject of compulsory
coinage, and again urges its suspension on all
the grounds contained in his former recomc-nda
tion, reinforced by the significant increase of
our gold exportations during the last year, and
for the further reasons, that the more
this currency is distributed among
the people, the greater becomes our duty to
protect it from disaster; that we now have an
abundance for all our needs, and that there
seems but little propriety in building vaults to
store such currency when the only pretense for
its coinage is the necessity of its use by the
people as a circulating medium.
The attention of Congress is called to the
great number of suits in New York growing out
of conflicting views by importers and collectors
as to the interpretation of our complex and in
definite revenue laws, and an amendment is
recommended by which the present condition
of this litigation should be relieved by a law
permitting the appointment of an additional
Federal judge In New York where these cases
have accumulated.
Of coast defenses and fortifications, the Pres
ident says the defenseless condition of our
sea coast and lake frontier is perfectly palpa
ble, and thfc work laid out by the Doanl on for
tification is delpyed in default of Congressional
action. The absolute necessity of our prepara
tion for effectual resistance against armored
ships and steel guns, which may threaten our
sea coast cities, is so apparent that, he hopes
effective steps will be taken in that direction at
once.
The condition of our navy, as shown by the
secretary of that department, should challenge
the earnest attention of Congress. The produc
tion in the United States of armor and gun
steel is a question which it seems necessary to
settle at an early day, if the armored war ves
sels are to be completed with those materials
of home manufacture. In the event that the
present invitation of the department for bids to
furnish such of this material as is now
authorized shall fail to induce
domestic manufacturers to undertake
the large expenditures required to prepare for
this new manufacture, and no other steps are
taken by Congress at its coming session, tho
Secretary contemplates with dissatisfaction the
necessity of obtaining abroad the armor and
the gun steel for the authorised ships.
It would seem desirable, the President adds,
that the wants of the army and navy in this re
gard should be reasonably met and, by uniting
their contracts such inducements might be of
fered as would result in securing the domesti
cation of these important interests.
Postal service affairs show marked and grati
fying improvement during the past year, tha
increase of revenue gaining in a ratio over the
increase of cost, demonstrating the sufficiency
of the present cheap rates of postage ultimately
to sustain the service. The differences with
certain ocean steamship companies were ter
minated by the acquiescence of all in the po » y
of the Government, thus affording a service
generally adequate to the needs of the inter
oceanic mail business.
The question of establishing ocean postal
service to Brazil and the Argentine Republic
is commended to the consideration of Congress,
and the suggestion is offered that, as distin
guished from a grant or subsidy for the mere
benefit of any line whatever, the outlay that
may be r<«uired to secure additional necessarj
and proper service, should be regarded as
within the limit of legitimate compensation for
such service.
The President indorses the recommendation
of the Attorney-General for the erection of a
penitentiary for the confinement of prisoners
convicted in the United States courts. Ht
considers it a matter of very great importance,
which should at once receive Congressional ac
tion. More than one of these institution?
might be erected, and, by employing the pris,
oners in the manufacture of articles needed fo»
use by the Government, quite a large pecuniary
benefit might be derived in partial return for ex.
penditures.
He indorses the recommendation of tho
Attorney-Ceneral for a change in the Federal
judicial system, to obviate the delays neces.
sarily attending the present condition of affairs
in our courts.
Of Indian affairs he says the present system
of agencies standing alone is inadequate for tho
accomplishment of an object which has become
pressing in its importance—the moro
rapid transition from tribal organization to
citizenship of such portions of tho
Indians as are capable of civilized life, and
hence the necessity for the supplemental
agency, a commission of six intelligent per
sons—three from the army—charged with tho
management of such matters of detail as can
not, with the present organization, be properly
and successfully conducted. The time is ripe,
the President tells Congress, for the work of
6uch an agency.
The President recommends the repeal of tho
Pre-emption and Timber-Culture acts, and that
the homestead laws be so amended as to better
secure compliance with their requirements of
residence, improvement and cultivation for five
years from date of entry, without commutation
or provision for speculation or relinquishment.
Referring to the satisfactory exhibit of the
operations of the Pension Bureau during the
last fiscal year, and to pension matters gener
ally, the President says the usefulness and the
justice of any system for the distribution of
pensioas depends upon the equality and uni
formity of its operation, and as long as we ad
here to the principle of granting pensions for
service and disabilty as the result of the serv
ice, the allowance of pensions should be re
stricted to cases presenting these features.
"Every patriotic heart," he says, "responds
to a tender consideration for those who, having
served their country long and well, are reduced
to destitution and dependence, not as an inci
dent of their service, but with advancing age or
misfortune. We are all tempted by the con
templation of such a condition to supply relief,
and are often impatient of the limitations
of public duty. Yielding to no one
in the desire to indulge this feeling of consider
ation, I can not rid "myself of the conviction
that if these ex-soldiers are to be relieved, they
and their cause are entitled to the benefit of
an enactment under which relief should be
claimed as a right, and that such relief may be
granted under the sanction, not the invasion,
of it; dor should such worthy
objects of care, all equally entitled, be remitted
to the unequal operation of sympathy, or the
tender mercies of social and political influence
with their unjust discrimination.
Of the Pacific railroad debt extension propo
sition, he says, that in considering the plan
suggested by'the Secretary of the Interior and
indorsed by the board of Government directors,
the sole matters which should be taken into
account are; "The situation of the Govern
ment as a creditor and the s>rest way to se
cure the payment of the principal and interest
on its debt.''
Of inter-State commerce, he says that by a
recent decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States it has been adjudged that the
laws of the several States are inoperative to
regulate rates of transportation upon railroads,
if such regulation interferes with the rate of
carriage from one State into another. This im
portant field of control and regulation having
been left thus unoccupied, the expediency of
Federal action upon the subject is worthy of
consideration.
Of the relations of labor to capital, the Presi
dent thinks that when these differences be
tween employer and employed reach such a
stage as to result in the interruption of com
merce between the States, the application of
arbitration by the General Government might
be regarded is entirely within its constitutional
powers, and he thinks we might reasonably
hope that such arbitrators, if carefully selected,
and if entitled to the confidence of the parties
to be affected, would be voluntarily called to
the settlement of controversies of less extent
and not necessarily within the domain of Fed
eral regulation.
The PresiUent recommends, as a plain duty
on the part of the Government, the payment of
a million and a quarter dollars still due to the
Freedman's Savings Bank depositors.
Civil-Service reform is the last important topio
discussed in the message. The continued
operation of the Civil-Service law, he asserts,
has added the most convincing proof of its
necessity and usefulness. Every public
officer who has a just idea of
his duty to the people testifies to the value of
this reform. Its staunchest friends are found
among those who understand it best, and its
warmest supporters are those who are re
strained and protected by its requirements.
The meaning of such restraint and protection
is not appreciated by those who want places
under the Government, regardless of merit and
efficiency, nor by those who insist that the se
lection for such places should rest upon a
proper credential showing active partisan
work. They mean to public officers, if not,
their lives the only opportunity afforded them
to attend the public business, and they mean
to the good of the country the better perform
ance of the work of their Government. It is
exceedingly strange, the President thinks, that
the scope and nature of this reform are so littlo
understood, and that so many things not in
cluded within its plan are called by its name.
When cavil yields more fully to examination,
the system will have large additions to the
number of its friends.
Our Civil-Service reform, the President says,
may be imperfect in some of its details; it may
be misunderstood and opposed, it may not al
ways be faithfully applied: its designs may
sometimes miscarry through mistake or wilful
intent; it may sometimes tremble under the as
saults of its enemy or languish under
the misguided zeal of impracticable
friends : but if the people of this country ever
submit to the banishment of its underlying
principle from the operation of their Govern
ment, they will abandon the surest guarantee
of the safety and success of American institu
tions." ,, ,
In conclusion, he invokes for this reform the
cheerful and ungrudging support of Congress,
urges an l^'rcase of the salaries__of the Com
missioneifl and ( ■represses the hope that such
reasonable appropriations may be made as will
enable them to increase the usefulness of the
cause they have is charge.
REFINED CRUELTY.
Hovr a Good School-Itoy Win Abused bj
a Heartless .'.la ter.
From Atlantic City comes news o1
one of the most inhuman deed.-; that
have startled humanity i veil in t'nis day
of heartlessness. Prof. Morse, a school
teacher, was arrested charged with as
sault and battery upon Robert Dunkel,
a pupil. It is charged that he caught
the boy by the collar, shook him like a
rat, threw him against a red-hot stove,
dragged him about the room, pulled
him over a seat, called him a leather
head and finally, to crown his barbar
ous and malignant assault, "swore at
him in Latin." This is indeed horri
ble. Boys have been collared and
choked and caned and dragged ever
since boys were invented; they are used
to it. and probably Robert didn't mind
that. All that cuts a very small figura
in the assault. But to swear at a boy
in Latin! As though it wasn't bad
enough to swear at him at all, the Pro
fessor swears at him in a language
most hated by boys. The unhappy vic
tims hear a short sentence of the Hard
est kind of Lat'n tired at him most ve
hemently; groaning in spirit, he turns
wearily to grammar and lexicon and af
ter much care and patient labor, he learns
that he has been double deed and blank
ety blanked in strict accordance with tha
rules laid down by Andrews and Stod
dard and other enemies of boyhood.
Now, this is not right. It is all tha
more uncalled for when Prof. Morse
knows, as we ail know, that Latin is
not an easy language to swear with;
that Latin oaths are not so viciously
keen, so frightfully sharp, as good,
round, mouth-filling English swear
words. It is as hard to learn to swear
in Latin as it is to read Nepos, whereas
the most illiterate and hopelessly stupid
foreigner learns to swear in English by
ear, correctly and without an effort.
We think Prof. Morse owes Robert an
apology for giving him a Latin exercise
in cuss words directed at the pupil's self.
This is compelling the victim to kick
away the drop with his own feet. And
still, when you think how many boys
swear at the Latin and the professor
every year, it does seem as though the
Latin and the professor might have an
occasional chance to swear back.—Bur'
dette, in Brooklyn Eagle.

—There is, perhaps, no science of

We have a good deal to learn yet
about the preservation of eggs. Our
system of 1 ming does tolerably well,
! but the reason is that well limed eggs
; do not "give themselves away" to tho
ordinary customer. Tbey may have
nearly the appearance of fairly good
1 fresh eggs. There are prizes given
1 annually at the London Dairy show for
preserved eggs. All samples are kept
for three months at the ofliee of tho
; society, and are then opened at the
I show. The test is considéré 1 tri be a
I severe one. This year the prizes for
1 the best preserved cg£S v..-re riven,
i first, to eggs, described as "packed ia
I good sweet bran, thin end downward;
I second, to some rubbed with a rfiixturo
] of bees wax and oil, and packed in salt,
and third, to eggs rubbed with mutton
; dripping, and packed in dry clear lima
j perfectly air tight. If the first prize
I eggs had really been simply packed in
j bran, no efiort having been made to
; close the pores of the eggs, it seems a
! little remarkable, still we have no
j reason to doubt the truth of the state
ment.
Eggs kept in a dry place begin at
once to lose moisture, the a'r bubble in
the thin or round end begins soon per
! ceptibly to enlarge on account of this
loss of moisture. The germs of fer
mentation, which the new-laid egg is
1 entirely free from, enter through the
J pores and act first upon that portion ol
the contents lying closest to the air cell.
Th ; s is obvious when an egg that lias
been kept some time, but is still good,
is hard boiled, a faint discoloration be
; ing observable next tiie air cell.
The wonder is that eggs kept for
«orne time, and in which some change
must have begun, hatch and produce
healthy chicks.
If a fresh-laid egg. still warm, b«
smeared with some pure oil or tallow,
and then at once packed in bran, it
may be expected to keep a good while.
P.utter is excellent for th s purpose; but
it should be melted and heated long
enough to expel all the water, which re
quires a rather high heat—above that of
boiling water. Treated in th ! s way, eggs
will be fit to boil for the table many
days, or even weeks, longer than eggs
without treatment.
It is not improbable that perfectly
fresh eggs gathered warm from tha
nests and packed in and deeply cov
ered with "dry, sweet bran" at once,
may be sufficiently protected from the
spores or germs of fermentation to keep
as well as if they were greased. The
white-of-egg smeared over fresh eirga
forms one of the best means for ex
cluding the air. We have heard its use
well spoken of.
Whatever attempt is made to keep
eggs, the highest success will follow
when the freshest possible eggs are at
once placed where the air and its malign
intluences will have the least possible
effect.— Ameri an Dairyman.
FAST BUTTER-MAKING.
5111k Which Completed Its Journey to Hat
ter in Just Two Hours.
As illustrating the possibilities in the
dairy since inventive genius has been
called in to help the dairyman, Prof.
G. H. Whitcher, of the New Hampshire
Agricultural college, gives tho follow
ing account of an experiment recently
made there: "Since the establishment
of the creamery at Hanover it had fre
quently occurred to me that the morn
ing's milk mijrht be transformed into
butter for the breakfast-table the same
morning, and on a recent Saturday it
was decided to try the experiment. At
4:30 a. m. the help at the college farm
were in readiness to commence milking,,
and at 5 o'clock sixty pouuds of warm
new milk were on the scales at the
creamery, which is located some sixty
rods away. At 5:15 steam was turned
on and the engines were set in motion—
the machinery which was to do in ten
minutes what nature demanded five
hours to complete. Five minutes later
the separator was at its full speed of
eight thousand revolutions per min
ute, and the milk was turned on;
ten minutes later forty-five pounds of
perfectly sweet skim milk and fifteen
pounds of equally sweet cream were tha
existing representatives of the original
sixtV pounds of milk. At 5:45 the cream,
cooled to 56 degrees, was in the small
test churn; at 6:20 the butter had part
ed company with the buttermilk and
was ready for the salt; at 6:50 it had as
sumed the form of one-fourth pound
prints; in ten minutes more it was on
the breakfast table at the collegj farm
house, thus completing the journey from
milk to butter in just two hours, an(J/
only two and a-half hours front the time
that milking was commenced. It may
seefo a little unaccountable to those who
have never given any thought to tho
subject of mechanical separation of
cream that bntter from the morning's
milk may contribute toward the com
pletion of the breakfast of the same day,
scarcely two hours after it is milked,
yet such is the result of our trial, and
such is the triumph of inventive genius
over the plodding ways of Father Time.
By the old-time methods from 36 to 48
hours intervened between milking and
churning, and by the cold setting in
patent cans only a part of the cream
can be obtained in three hours, while
the average time is 24 hours, but with
the new system all the cream is ob
tained from 100 pounds of milk in from
eight to ten minutes.— Chicago Times.
