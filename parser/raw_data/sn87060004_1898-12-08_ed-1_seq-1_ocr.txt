OUR RELATION8 WITH other fow-

- A review of tho relations ot the United

ine, in view of tne momentous is
which havo arisen, demanding In one
tnnco the ultimate dotarmlnntlon bv

us being by far the most Important prob
lem with which wo were then called upon
to deal. The considerations then ad
vanced and tho exKsitton ot views there
in expressed, disclosed my senso of tho
extreme gravity ot tho situation. Setting
uslde. as logically unfounded, or iirac-
ltt-atly Inadmissible, the recognition of tho
vuonn insurgents as belligerents; the
recognition or tho Independence of
'iibn; neutral Intervention to end
tho war by Imposing a ration
il compromise between tho contestants,
intervention In favor of one or tho other
I lcrty, nml forcible annexation of tho Is
r land, I concluded It was honestly due to
:ur friendly relations with Spain that alio
snouia no given a reasonable chanco to
realise her expectations of reform to
which she had becomo Irrevocably com
mitted. Within a tow weeks previously
she htd announced comprehonslvo plans,
which It was conlldently asserted would
bo etllcaclous to remody tho evils so deop
ly affecting our own country, so Injurious
to the truo Interests of the mother coun
try as well as to those ot Cuba, and so
repugnant to tho universal sentiment of
Immunity.
no sion op real progress.
Tho ensuing month brought little sign
or real progress toward tho pacification
of Cuba. Tho autonomous administra
tion set up In the capital, and some ot the
principal cities, nppearod not to gain the
favor of tho Inhabitants nor to bo ablo to
extend tholr lutlucncn to the large extent

present Insurrection from Its start. No

practical ruin of tho Island, lay In sight,
but how far distant no one could venture
to conjecture.
THE DESTRUCTION OP THE MAINB.
ifG&X thlB Juncture on tho 15th of Fobru
YS&. lust, occurred the destruction of the
battleship Maine while rightfully lying
In the harbor of Havana on a mission ot
International courtesy nnd good will a
catastrophe, tho suspicious nature and
horror bf which stirred tho nation's heart
profoundly. It Is u striking evldenco of
the polio nnd sturdy good sense distin
guishing our national character that thlL
shocking blow, falling upon a genorous
pcoplo, already dcoply touched by pre
ceding events In Cuba, did not movo them
for an Instant, desperate resolve to tol
crato no longer the existence ot a condi
tion of dangor nnd disorder at our doors
that mado possible such a deed by whom
ever wrought. Yet tho Instinct of Justice
prevailed, and the nation anxiously await
ed tho result of tho searching Investiga
tion nt once set on foot. Tho finding of
tho naval board of inquiry established
that the origin of tho explosion was ex
ternal, by u submarine mine, and only
halted through lack ot posltlvo testimony
to fix tli a responsibility of Its authorship.
TUB COMING OP THE CIHSIS.
All these, things carried conviction to
tho most thoughtful, oven beforo tho find
ing of tho naval court, that a crisis In
our relations with Spain and toward Cuba
was nt hand. So strong was this bollot
that It needed but n brief oxecutlvo sug
gestion to tho congress to recelvo Im
mediate answer to tho duty of making
sufficient provision for tho posslblo and
perhaps speedy probable emergency of
war, and tho remarkable, almost unique
spectacle was presented of a unanimous
voto ot both houses, on the ninth of
March, appropriating fifty millions of dol
lars "for tho national dotense, and for
each and every purpose connected thorp
with, to ho expended at tho dlecrotou of
the president.
THE PROVISION CAME NONE TOO
SOON.
That this act of provision came nono too
soon was disclosed when tho application
of tho fund was undertaken. Our torts
were prnctlcnlly undofendod. Our navy
needed large provision for increased am
munition and supplios, and oven numbers,
to copo with any sudden attack by tho
navy of Spain, which comprised modorn
Vesrob ot tho hlghost type of continental
perfection. Our army also required en
largement of men and munitions, Tho de
tails of tho hurried preparation for the
dreud contingency Is told In tho reports of
tho secretaries of war nnd of tho navy,
unci need not be repented hero. It la suf
ficient to ay that tho outbreak of tho
war, when It aid come, found our nation
not unprepared to meet tho conflict.

Cuba. In responding to that representa
tion, X also shared tho Iiopo that the en
voys had expressed, that peace might be
preserved In a manner to terminate the
chronic condition of disturbance In Cuba
so Injurious nnd menacing to our Inter
ests and tranquillity, as well ns
shocking to our sentiments of hu
manity; and, whilo appreciating the
humanitarian and disinterested char
acter of the communication they had
mado on behalf ot the powers. I stated
the confidence of thla government, for Us
mat equal appreciation woum uo
for Its earnest and unselfish en-

ors to fulfill a duty of liumnnlty by
ending a situation, tho Indefinite prolon
gation ot what had becomo Insufferable.
ANIMATED IJY IIOIMJ OP PEACEFUL
SOUUTldN. fc
Btlll anlmnted by tho hopo of a peaceful
solution, and obeying the dictates otduty,
no effort was relaxed to bring about a
speedy ending of tho Cuban struggle. Ne
gotiations, to this object continued ac
tively with tho government of Spain,
looking to the Immodlnte conclusion of a
six months' armistice In Cuba with a
view to effect the recognition of her peo
ple's right to Independence, llesldes this,
tho Instant revocation of tho order of
reconcentratlou was usked, su that the
sufferers, returning to their homes, nnd
aided by united American and Bpanlsh ef
fort, might bo put In n. wuy to support
themselves, and by orderly resumption of
tho well-nigh destroyed productive ener
gies of the Island, contribute to the res
toration of Its tranquillity and well being
Negotiations
continueu tor wirao mui
tlmo nt Madrid, resulting In offers by tho
Spanish government which could not but
bo regarded as Inadequate.
SPAIN'S PROPOSITION.
It was proposed to confldo the restora
tion of pencu to an Insular government,
yet to be convened under tho autonomous
decrees of November, 1897, but without
Impairment In any wlce of tho constitu
tional powers of the Madrid government,
which, to that end, would grant an ar
mistice. If solicited by the Insurgents, for
such time ns tho general-in-chief might
seu fit to fix. How nnd with what scopo
of discretionary powers tho Insular par
liament was expected to set about the
preparation of ienco did not appear.
If It was to be by negotiation with the
Insurgents, tho Issue see med to rest on
one sldo with a body chosen by it faction
of the electors In tho districts under Span
ish control, and on tho other with, tho In
surgent population holding tho Interior
country unrepresented In tho so-called
parliament, and defiant at the suggestion
of suing for pence.
THE QUESTION REMITTED TO CON
GRESS Orlved and dlsuppalntcd at this barren
outcome of my sincere endeavors to
reach a practicable solution, I felt It my
duty to remit the whole question to con
gress. In tho message ot April II, 1S3S.
1 announced that, with this lust ovorturo
In tho direction ot Immediate poaco In
Cuba nnd Its disappointing reception by
Spain, tho effort of the executive wns
brought to un end. I again renewed the
alternative course of action which I had
prepared, concluding that tho only one
consonant with the International policy
and compatible with our firm-set histor
ical traditions was Intervention as a neu
tral to stop the war and check tho hope
less sacrltlco of life, oven though that
report Involved "hostile constraint upon
both tho parties to the contest. a well us
to enforce a truce as to guldo tho eventful
settlement."
JUSTIFICATION FOR OUR COURSE.
The grounds Justifying that step were
In tho interests of humanity, the duty to
protect tho llfo and property of every clt
uen In Cubn; the right to check Injury to
our commerce und the people through tho
devastation of tho Island, and, most Im
portant. the need ot removing at once
and forever tho constant mennco and tho
burden entailed upon our government by
tho uncertainties nud perils tho situation
caused by tho Interminable disturbance
In Cuba. . ...
"Tho long trial has proved that tho ob
ject for which Spain has wngod tho war
can not be attained. The lira of Insur
rection may llama or may smoulder with
varying seasons, but It has not been, and
It Is plain that It can not be, extinguished
by present methods. Tho only liopo of
relict and repose from u condition which
can no longer be endured Is tho enforced
pacification ot Cuba. In tho name of hu
manity. In tho name of civilization. In be
half of cndar.gerod American Intorcsts
which gtva us lio right and the duty to
speak, actual war In Cubn must stop,"
THE PRESIDENT'S REQUEST TO
CONGRESS.
In view of all this, congress was asked
to urgo and empower tho president to
take measures to secure a full and final
termination of hostilities between Spain
nnd tho people of Cubn, nnd to secure In
tho Island the establishment ot a stablo
government, capablo of maintaining or
er nnd observing Its International obli
gations. Insuring peace and tranquillity,
nnd tho security of Its citizens ns woll ns
our own, and for tho accomplishment of
those ends to use the military and naval
forces of tho United States ns might be
necessary, with added authority to con
tinue generous relief to the starving peo
ple of Cuba.
THE RESPONSE OP CONGRESS.
The response of tho congress, after nine
d.ivs of earnest deliberation. during which
tho almost unanimous sentiment of your
body wan dovoloped on every point, savo
as to the expediency of coupling tho pro
posed nctlon with n formal recognition
of the republic of Cuba ns the truo and
lawful government of thirl Island a prop
osition which failed of adoption tha con
gress, nflur a conference, on mo win or
April, by a volo ot K to 3-" In tho senate,
und 311 to 0 In tho house ot representa
tives, passed tho memorable Joint resolu
tion declaring:
"Klrst- That tho people of tho Island of
Cuba are, and of right ought to bo, free
and Independent.
"Second That It Is tho duty of the
United States to demand, nnd tho gov
ernment of the United States docs hereby

authority and government In the Island
of Cuba, nnd withdraw Us land nud naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Third That tho president of tho Unit

empowered to uso tho land nnd naval
forces of the United Stntet, and to call

extent ns may bo necessary to carry theso
resolutions Into effect.
"Fourth That tho United States horo
by disclaims nuy disposition or Intention
to exercise sovereignty, Jurisdiction or
control over said Island, except for tho
faclllcatlon thereof, and assorts Its de
ermlnatlon when that Is accomplished,
to leave the government and control ot
tho Island to Its people,"
This resolution wns approved by tho
executive on tho next day, April 9.
OUR RESOLVE COMMUNICATED TO
SPAIN.
A copy was at onco communicated to
tho Spanish minister nt this capital, who
forthwith announced that his continuance
In Wnshlngton had thereby become Im
possible, ho asked for his passports,
which wero given him. Ho- thereupon
withdrew from Washington, loavtng the
protection of Spanish Interests In tho
united States to the French ambassador
and tho Austro-Hungarlan minister.
SImultaneouily with Un communication
to tho Spanish minister, den. Woodford,
tho American minister at Madrid, was
telegraphed confirmation of tho text of
the joint resolution, and directed to com
munlcnto It to tho government of Spain
with tho formal demand that It at onco
relinquish Its authority and government
In tho Island of Cuba and withdraw Its
forces therefrom, coupling this domand
with announcements of tho lntontlons of
this government ns to tne future of tho
Island, In conformity with tho fourth
clause of tho resolution, nnd giving Spain
until noon of April 23 to reply.
THE ACTION OP SPAIN.
Tho demand, nlthough, as abovo shown,
officially mado known to the Spanish en
voy hero, was not dollvered nt Mndrld,
After tho Instruction reached Gen. Wood
ford, on tho morning of April 21, but be
foro he could present It, the Spanish min
ister of stato notified him that upon tho
president's approval of tho Joint resolu
tion, the Madrid government, regarding
the act as "equivalent to an evident dec
laration of war," had orderod Un minister
In Washington to withdraw, thereby
breaking off diplomatic relations between
the two countries ana ceasing all oillclal
communication between tholr respective
representatives Gen Woodford there
upon demanded his passports and quitted
Madrid tho samo day.
THE DECLARATION OP WAR.
Spain, having thus denied tho demand
ot tho United States, and initiated that
completo form of rupture of relations
which attends n stnte ot wnrf tho execu
tive powers authorized by tho resolution
were nt once authorized by me to mcot
the itnlarged contingency of actual war
between Spain and the united States. On
April 22 I proclaimed a blockade ot tno
northern roust of Cuba, including ports
on said coast between Cardenas and liahla
cKinlev s
and the port of Clenfuegos, on tho south
coast of Cuba; und on the 23d I called for
volunteers to oxecuto tno purpose of the
resolution. Hy my message of tho 25th
tho congress was Informed ot tho situa
tion, nnd 1 recommended formal declara
tion of the exlsteuco ot u state of war be
tween tho United States nnd Spain, The
congress accordingly voted, on tho same
day, tho act approved April 23, 1&33, de
claring tho oxfstenco of such war from
and Including tho Zlst day of April, nnd
ro-ena'-ted the provision of the resolution
of April 29, directing tho president to use
nil tho armed forces of the nation to car
ry tho act Into effect. Duo notification of
tho cxlstenco of war as aforesaid was
given, April 23. by telegraph to all tho
governments with which tho United States
maintain relations In ordor that their
neutrality might be assured during tho
wnr. Tho various governments respond
ed with proclamations of njutrallty, each
after Its own methods. It is not among
tno least gratifying incidents of tnestrug-
gle that Iho obligations ot neutrally were
impartially discharged by all, often under
delicate nnd difficult circumstances.
PROCLAMATION GOVERNING CON
Dl'CT AT SEA.
In further fulfillment of International
duty I Issued, April 26, a proclamation an
nouncing tho treatment proposed to be
accorded In vessels and their cargoes as
to blockade, contraband, tho exerclso of
tho right ot subjects and the Immunity
of neutral tings and neutral goods under
enemy's flag. A similar proclamation Was
mado by tho Spanish government. In the
conduct of hostilities tho rules ot the dec
laration of Paris, Including abstention
from resort of privateering, havo accord
ingly been observed by both belligerents,
ulthough neither was a party to that dec
laration. THE rLTJNGE INTO A FOREIGN WAR.
Our country thus, after an Interval ot
half a century of peace, with all nations,
found Itself engaged In deadly conflict
with a foreign enemy. .Eyery nerve was
strnlncd to meet tho emergency. The re
sponse to the Initial call for 125,000 volun
teers wns Instant and complete, as was
also tho result of tho second call of May
23, for 70,000 additional volunteers. Tho
ranks of tho regular army were Increased
to the limits provided by tho act of April
2d. Tho enlisted forco of the navy, on tho
15th of August, when It reached Its max
imum, numbered 21.123 men and appren
tices. One hundred und throo vessels were
added to the navy by purchase, one was
presented to tho government, one
leased, nnd tho four vessels of tho In
ternational Navigation Co.. the St. Paul,
St. Iritis, New York and Paris, were
chnrteied, In addition to theso the revenue
cutters and Ughthouso tenders wero
turned oer to the navy department, and
became temporarily a part of tho auxil
iary navy.
THE FIGHTING FORCE OP THE
NAVY.
Tho maximum effective fighting force
of tho navy during the war, sepurated In
to classes, was as follows: Four battle
ships of the tlrst class; 1 battleship of tho
second class: 2 armored cruisers; 6 coast
defense monitors; 1 armored ram; 12 pro
tected cruisers; 3 unprotected cruisers; IS
gunboats; J dynamite cruiser; 11 torpedo
boatB; 11 old csscls of tho old navy In
cluding monitors.
Auxiliary navy: Four auxiliary crui
sers, 2S converted ynchtH; 21 converted
tugs; 13 converted colliers; 15 revenue cut
ters, 4 lighthouse tenders and 19
miscellaneous vessels.
ALARM ON THE ATLANTIC COAST.
Much alarm wns felt along' our entire
Atlantic seaboard lest some attack might
b made by the enemy. Every precau
tion was taken to prevent posslblo Injury
to our great cities lying along tho coast.
TcmiHjrnry garrisons wero provided,
drawn from tho volunteer force. About
12,009 troops were thus employed. The
coast signal service wns established for
observing tho nppronch of an enemy'B
ship to tho const of tho United States, and
the lighthouse service co-operated, which
enabled the navy department to havo all
portions of the Atlantic coast, from
Malno to Texas, under observation.
THU AUXILIARY NAVY.
The auxiliary navy wns created under
tho authority of congress and was olll
cered and manned by the naval militia of
tho several states. This organization pa
trolled the coast and performed tho duty
of a second arm of defense.
Under tho direction or tho chief of en
gineers, submarine mines wero placed at
tho most exposed points. Defaro the out
break of the war permanent mining case
mates nnd cablo galleries had been con
structed at all Important harbors. Most
ot tho torpedo material wns not to bo
found In tho markot, and had to bo spe
cially manufactured. Under data of April
10 dlsttlct ofllcers wero directed to tako
all preliminary measures, short of thf
actual attaching of the loaded mines to
the cables, and on April 22 telegraphic or
ders were Istuod to place tho loaded
mines In post. Ion.
SUHMAUINE MINE DEFENSE.
The nggreguto number of mines placed
was 1 r35 at tho principal harbors from
Maine, to California. Preparations wero
nlso m. do for the planting ot mines at
certain other harbors, but owing to the
early destruction of tho Spanish licet,
theso mines wero not placed. Tho signal
corps was promptly organized, and per
formed service of tho most dlfllcult and
Important character. Its operations dur
ing tho war covered tho electrical connec
tion of nil coast fortifications, the estab
lishment of telonhono nnd tclesrnnhla fa
cilities for tho camps at Manila, Santiago
and In Porto Rico, Thero wero construct
ed 300 miles of the lino at ten great camps,
thus facilitating military movemontsfrom
those points In a manner herotoforo un
known In military administration. Field
telegraph lines wero established and main
tained under the enemy's lire at Manila,
and later tho Manila-Hong Kong cablo
wns opened.
CABLE COMMUNICATIONS IN CUBA
AND PORTO RICO.
In Porto Ulco cable communications woro
opened over n discontinued route and on
lund tho headquarters of the command
ing olllcer was kept Jn telegraphic and
telephonic communication with tho dlvi
slon commanders on four different lined
of operation.
There was placedinCubanwatersacom
plotcly outtlttcd cable ship with war ca
bles and cablo gear, sultablo both for the
destruction of communications belonging
to the enemy and tho establishment of
our own. Two ocean cables weredostroyed
under tho enemy'B batteries at Santingo,
Tho dny previous to tho landing of Gen.
Shatters corpj nt Calmnnera, within 20
miles ot the landing place, cable commu
nications wero established and a cablo
station opened, giving direct communica
tion with the government at Washington.
This service was Invaluable to tno oxecu
tlvo In directing tho operations of tha
army and navy. With a total forco of
over 1,30) tho loss wns by disease In camp
and field, ofllcers and men Included, only
11 vo.
THE NATIONAL DEFENSE FUND.
Tho national defense under tho 150,000,
OOu fund, wns expended In large part by
tho army and navy, and tho objects for
widen It was used are fully shown In the
reports of tho several secretaries, it was
a most timely appropriation, enabling the
government to strengthen Us defense nnd
mako preparations greatly needed In case
of war. This fund being Inadequato to
the requirements of equipment and for
tho conduct of tho war, tho patriotism of
tho congress provided tho means In tho
wur revenue act of June 13, by authoriz
ing a threo per cent popular loan not to
exceed J 100.000,000 and by levying addi
tional imposts and taxes. Of tno author
ized lonn, 3100,000.000 woro offered nnd
promptly taken, the subscriptions so far
excocdlng tho call as to cover -It many
times over, while, preference being given
to tho smaller bids, no slnglo allotment
exceeded J5.000 This was a most encour
aging and significant result, showing tho
vast resources of the nation and the de
termination of tho people to uphold their
country's honor.
SALIENT FEATURES OP THE WAR.
It Is not within the provlnco of this mes
sage to narrate tho history of tho extra
ordinary war that followed tho Spanish
declaration of April 21, but a brief ro
cltal ot Its more salient features Is ap-
firoprlato. Tho llrst encounter of the war
n point of date took placo April 27, when
a detachment ot the blockading squadron
made a reconnalssanco In forco at Ma
tanzus, shelled the harbor torts and de
molished several new works In courso of
construction,
DEWEY'S VICTORY AT MANILA BAY.
The noxt engagement was destined to
mark a memorable oooch In maratlmo
warfare. Tho Pacific fleet, under Commo
dore George Dewey, had lain for some
weeks at Hong Kong. Upon the colonial
proclamation of neutrality being Issued,
and tho customary 21 hours' notice being
given, It repaired to Mirs bay, near Hong
Kong, whenco It proceeded to tho Phlllp
plno islands, under telegraphic orders to
captura or destroy tho formidable Span
ish fleet then assembled at Manila. At
daybreak on tho first of May, tho Amer
ican force entered Manila bay, and after
in Full
jK
I n. few hours' engagement effected tho to
l tnl destruction of the Spanish fleet, con
sisting of ten warships and a transport,
besides capturing tho naval station and
forts nt Cavlte, thus annihilating the
Spanish naval power In the Pacific ocean,
I and completely controlling tho bay ot Ma
nna, wiiu inn uuilliy lu luno uiu i;iiy ui
will. Not a llfo was lost on our ships, the
wounding only numbering sovon, while
not a vessel was materially Injured. For
this gallant achievement tho congress,
upon my recommendation, fitly bestowed
upon tho actors preferment and substan
tial reward.
A PRESTIGE OP INVINCIBILITY.
The effect of this remarkable victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon tho
fortunes of tho war was instant. A pres
tige of Invincibility thereby attached to
our arms, which continued throughout
tho struggle. Reinforcements were hur
ried to Manila under tho command of
MaJ.-Gen. Merrltt, and firmly established
within sight of the capital, which lay
helpless before our guns. On the 7th day
ot May tho government was advised of
ficially ot tho victory at Manila, and at
onco Inquired of the commander of our
fleot what troops would be required. Tho
Information was received on the 15th day
of May. and tho first army expedition
sailed May 5, and arrived at Manila June
30. Other expeditions soon followed, the
total forco consisting of Ml officers nnd
15,iCS men.
OPERATION8ABOUT MANILA.
Only reluctapjSrb cause needless, loss
of life nnd p(1"JWrty prevented theTcarly
storming anj capture of tho c'ty and
therewith tho absolute military o 'cupan
cy of tho whole group. The insurgents
meanwhile had resumed the active hos
tilities, suspended by the uncompleted
truce of December, 1S97. Their forces In
vested Manila from tho northern nnd
eastern sides, but were constrained by
Admiral Dewey and On. Merrltt from at
tempting an assault. It was fitting that
whatever was to bo done In the way of
decisive operations In that quarter should
be accomplished by the strong nrm of the
United States alone. Obeying the stern
precept of war, which enjoins the over
coming ot the adversary and the extinc
tion of his power wherever assailable, as
tho speedy and sure means to win a
Ccnce, divided victory was not permlssl
le, for no partition ot the rights and re
sponsiu.utles attending the enforcement
of a Just and advantageous peace could
be thought of.
THE SCHEME OP OENERALATTACIC.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack, powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast
to Invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Mean
while naval demonstrations were made at
several exposed points. On May 11, the
cruiser Wilmington and tho tornedo boat
WInslow were unsuccessful In an attempt
to sllenro the batteries nt Cardenas,
against Matanzas, Ensign Worth Bagley
and four seamen falling. These grievous
fatalities were, strangely enough, among
tho very few which occurred during our
naval operations In this extraordinary
conflict.
SPANISH NAVAL PREPARATIONS.
Meanwhile the Spanish tiaval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor.
A powerful squadron under Admiral Ccr
vern. which had assembled at tho Cape
Verdo Islands beforo the outbreak of hos
tilities, had crossed the ocean, nnd by Its
erratic movements In the Carrlbcan sea
delayed our military operations while
battling the pursuit ot our fleets. For a
tlmo fears wero felt lest tho Oregon and
Marietta, then ncarlng home after their
long voyago from San Francisco of over.
15.009 miles, might be surprised by VI
mlral Cervera'B fleet, but their fortunate
arrival dlspelleO these apprehensions and
lent much-needed reinforcement. Not un
til Admiral Cervera took refugo In th
harbor ot Santiago de Cuba, about May
o, was It practicable ts plan a systematic
military attack upon the Antlllean pos
sessions of Spain.
DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE ISLAND
COASTS.
Several demonstrations occurred on tho
coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico In prepara
tion for tho larger event. On May 13 tho
North Atlantic squadron shellod San Juan
do Porto Rico. On May 30 Commodoro
Schley's squadron bombarded the forts
guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor.
Neither attack had any mntcrlal result.
It was evident that well-ordered land op
erations were Indispensable to achieve a
decided advantage.
THE SINKING OP THE MERRIMAC.
The next act In tho war thrilled not
nlone tho hearts ot our countrymen, but
tho world by Its exceptional herohim. On
the night of Juno 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided
by seven devoted volunteers, blocked tho
narrow outlet from Santiago harbor by
sinking the collier Merrlmac In tho chan
nel, under a fiery shower from shore bat
teries, escaping with their lives as by a
miracle, but falling Into tho hands of the
Spaniards. It Is a most gratifying In
cident of tho war that tho bravery of this
little band of heroes wns cordlallv appre
ciated by the Spaniards, who sent a Hag
of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of
their safety and to compliment thorn upon
their daring net. They were subsequent
ly exchanged July 7.
CUBA TINALLY ISOLATED.
BY Juno 7 the cutting ot tho last Cuban
cable Isolated tho island. Thereafter tho
invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
June 10, under a heavy protecting lire, a
landing force of GOO marines from tho
Oregon. Marblehead and Yankee, waa af
fected in Gunntnnamo bay, whore It had
been determined to establish a naval sta
tion. This Important and csentlal port
was taken from the enemy after severe
fighting by the marines, who wero thn
first forco ot tho United States to land In
Cuba.
THE INVASION OF THE ISLAND.
The position so won was hold despite
desperate attempts to dislodge our forces
By Juno 1G additional forces wero landed
and strongly intrenched. On Juno 22, the
ndvnnce of the Invading army undor MuJ.
Gen. Shatter landed at Dlaqulrl, about 15
miles cast of Santiago. This was accom
plished under great difficulties but with
marvelous dispatch. On June 23 the
movement against Santiago wns begun.
On the 21th, tho first serious engagement
took place, In which thu First and Tenth
cnvnlry and the First United States vol
unteer cnvalry, Gen. Young's brigade of
Gen. Wheeler's division, participated, los
ing heavily. By nightfall, however, ground
within flvo miles of Santiago was won.
The ndvnntago was steadily Increased.
On July 1, a severe battle took place, our
forces gaining tho outworks of Santingo;
on the 20th El Cnney und San Juan hill
were taken after a desperate charge, and
the Investment of tho city was completed,
Tho navy co-opcrnted by shelling tho
town and the coast forts.
THE DESTRUCTION OP CERVERA'S
FLEET.
On tho day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 3.
occurred the decisive naval combat of tho
war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to
leave tho harbor, was met by tho Ameri
can squadron under command of Com
modore Sampson. In less than threo hours
all the Spanish ships wero destroyed, the
two torpedo boats sunk and tho Maria
Teresa, Almlranto Oquendo, Vlzcaya and
Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span
ish ndmlral und over 1.300 men wero
taken prisoners while tho enemy's loss
of life wob deplorably large, some COO
perishing. On our sldo but one man wns
killed nnd one man seriously wounded.
Although our ships were repeatedly struck
not ono was seriously Injured. Whero
all so conspicuously distinguished them
selves, from the commanders to tho gun
ners, and tho unnamed heroes In tho
boiler rooms, ench and all contributing
toward the achievement ot this astound
ing victory, for which neither ancient
nor modern history affords a parallel In
tho completeness of the event and (he
marvelous disproportion of casualties, It
would bo Invidious to slnglo out any for
special honor.
DESERVED PROMOTIONS.
Deserved promotion has rewarded the
mora conspicuous actors tho nation's
Srofoundest gratitude Is due to all those
rave men who, by their skill and devo
tion. In a few short hours crushed tho sea
power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness nnd far-reaching con
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can wo be unmindful ot tho achievements
ot our builders; mechanics and artisans
for their skill In the construction of our
warships.
With the catastrophe of Santiago,
Spain's effort upon tho ocean virtually
ceased. A spasmodic effort toward tho
end of Juno to Bend her Mediterranean
fleet, under Admiral -Camara, to relieve
Manila, wns abandoned, tha expedition
being recalled after It had passed through
the Sues canal.
THE CAPITULATION OF feANTIAGO.
The capllu'iulon ot San'lago followed.
Tl.o city waa closely bcslii .1 by land,
whtlo the entrance of our a ii' s Into the
harbor cut off all roilef on i.iat ai.lo. Af
ter a truce to allow of tfc removal of
non-combatants, prnirttcteil negotiations
continued ftnni July 3 until Jul) 15, whin,
under roenaco of Immediate ussault, Uis

preliminaries of surrender were agreed
upon. On tha 17th Gen. Shatter occupied
the city. The capitulation embraced the
entire eastorn end of Cuba. The number
of Spanish soldiers surrendered was 22,000,
all of whom were subsequently conveyed
to Spain at tho ohargo of tho United
States. Tho story of this successful cam
paign Is told In the report of the secre
tary of war, which will be laid before
you. Tho Individual valor of officers and
soldiers was never more Btrlklmrlv shown
than In tho several engagements leading
to tno surrender of Santiago, whilo the
prompt movements and successive victo
ries won Instant and universal applauso.
Gratitude due the victors.
To those who gained this complete tri
umph which established the ascendency
of the United States upon land as the
fight off Santiago had fixed our suprem
acy on the seas, the earnest and lasting
gratitude ot the nation Is unsparingly due.
Nor should wo alone remember tho gal
lantry of the living, tho dead claim our
ccais, and our losses by battto and dls
c.iso must cloud any exultation at the re
sult, and teach us to weigh tne awful cost
of war, however rightful tho causo or
signal tho victory.
With tho fall of Santiago, the occupa
tion ot Porto Rico became the next strat
egic necessity. Gen. Miles had previous
ly been assigned to organize an expedi
tion for that purpose. Fortunately, he
wns already nt Santiago, whero he had
arrived on the 11th of July with rein
forcements for Gen. Shatter's army.
THE OCCUPATION OP PORTO RICO.
WJIh these troops, consisting ot 3,415 In
fantry and artillery, two companies of
engineers and ono company of the signal
corps. Gen. Miles left Guantanamo on
July 21, having nlno transports, convoyed
by a fleet under Capt. Hlgglnson, with the
Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie, Glouces
ter, Columbia nnd Yale, tho two latter
carrying troops. The expedition landed
at Guanica July 25, which port waa en
tered with llttlo opposition. Hero the
fleet was Joined by the Annapolis and the
Wasp, whilo tho Puritan and Amphltrlte
went to San Juan and Joined the New
Orleans, which was engaged In blockad
ing that port. The major-general com
manding waa subsequently reinforced by
Gen. Schwann's brlgado of the Third
army corps: by Gen. Wilson, with a part
of his division, and also by Gen. Brooke,
XvilaJJart ot h,B cns, numbering In all
16,573 ofllcers and men.
THE ENTRY INTO PONCE.
On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the
most Important ports In the Island, from
which he thereafter directed operations
for the capture of the island.
With the exception of encounters with
the enemy at Guayama, Hermlguerez,
Coamo and Yeuco, nnd an attack on a
torco landed nt Capo San Juan, there was
no serious resistance. The campaign was
prosecuted with great vigor, and Tiy the
12th ot August, much of tho Island was
In our possession and the acquisition of
the remainder wns only a matter of a
short time. At most of the points In the
Island our troops were enthusiastically
welcomed. Protestations of loynlty to the
flag and gratitude for delivery from Span
ish rule met our commanders at every
stage. As a potent lnfluenco toward
peace, tho outcome of the Porto Rlcon
expedition was of great consequence, nnd
generous commendation Is due to those
who participated In It.
THE LAST SCENE OF THE WAR.
The last scene of tho war was enacted
at Manila, Its starting place. On August
IS, after a brief assault upon the works
Ul7njt-lirf.H thn -nhltnt dit-panit.-.J ,n
condltlonslly. The casualties wero com
paratively few. By this tho conquest of
tho Philippine Islands, virtually accom
plished when tho Spanish capacity for re
sistance waa destroyed by Admiral
Dewcy'B victory of the first of May, was
formally sealed. To Gen. Merrltt. his of
ficers and men for their uncomplaining
nnd devoted services, for their gallantry
In action, tho nation is sincerely grate
ful. Their long voyage was mado with
singular success, and the soldierly con
duct of tho men, many of whom were
without previous experience In military
service, deserves unmeasured praise.
THE CASUALTIES DURING THE
WAR.
The total casualties In killed and
wounded In the army during the war was
as follows; Ofllcers killed. 23; enlisted
men killed, 2J7; total, 280; ofllcers wound
ed, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1,461; total,
1.577. Of the nnvv. killed. 17: wounded.
C7; died as tho result of wounds, 1; In
I valldcd from service, C; total, 91.
It will be observed that while our navy
was engagea in iwo great Dames ana in
numerous perilous undertakings In tho
blockades and bombardments, and more
than 60,000 of our troops were transport
ed to distant lands and engaged In as
sault and siege and battle, and In many
Bklrrnlshcs In unfamiliar terrltoy, we lost
lp both arms of the service a total of 1,
66S killed and wounded; and In tho cntlro
campaign by lond nnd sea wo did not lose
a gun, or o. Hag, or a transport, or a
ship, nnd, .vlth tho exception of the craw
of the Merrlmac, not a soldier or sailor
was taken prisoner.
A SHORT CAMPAIGN.
On August 7. 46 days from the dato ot
the landing of Gen. Shatter's army In
Cuba, nnd 21 days from the surrender of
Santingo, the United States troops com
menced embarkation for homo, and our
entire force was returned to the United
States as early as August 24. They were
absent from the United States only two
months.
THOSE WHO REMAINED AT HOME.
It is fitting that I should bear testi
mony to the patriotism and devotion ot
that large portion of our army which, al
though eager to be ordered to tho post of
greatest exposure, fortunately was not
required outside of tho United States.
They did their whole duty and, like their
comrades at the front, have earned the
gratitude of the nation. In like manner,
the ofllcers and men ot the army and ot
the navy who remained In their depart
ments and stations of tho navy perform
ing most Important duties connected with
the war, Hnd whose requests for assign
ment In the field and at sea It was com
pelled to refuse because their services
was Indlspensabla here, aro entitled to
the highest commendation. It Is my re-
?rot that there seems to bo no provision
or their suitable recognition.
THE AMERICAN RED CROSS.
In this connection it Is a pleasuro for
mo to mention tho cordial appreciation
tho timely and useful work of the Ameri
can Red Cross, both In relief measures
preparatory to the campaigns; in sani
tary assistance at soveral of the camps
bt assemblage, and, later, under the able
and experienced leadership of the presi
dent of tho society. Miss Clara Barton, on
the fields nt battle and In tho hospitals
at the front In Cuba. Working In con
Junction with the governmental authori
ties, and under their sanction and ap
proval, nnd with tho enthusiastic co
operation of many patriotic women and
soclotles In the various states, the Red
Cross has fully maintained Its already
high reputation for Intense earnestness
and abmty to exercise the noble purpose
of Its International organization, thus
Justifying the confidence and Bupport
which It has received at the hands ot the
American people To tho members and
officers of this society and all who aided
them In their philanthropic work, the sin
cere and lasting gratitude of tho soldiers
and the public Is due and Is freely ac

stantly reminded of our obligations to tho
Divine Master for His watchful caro over
us and His sate guidance, for which tho
nation makes reverent acknowledgment
and offers humblo prayer for tho continu
ance of His favor.
SPANISH OVERTURES FOR PEACE.
The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's
fleet, followed by tho capitulation of San
tiago, having brought to the Spanish gov
ernment n. realizing senso of the hopo
lessness of continuing a struggle now be
coming wholly unequal. It mado over
tures of peace through the French am
bassador, who, with the assent ot his
government, had acted as the friendly
reprcsentatlvo of Spanish Interests dur
ing the war. On the 26th day ot July, M.
Cambon presented a communication,
Blgned by the duke of Almodlvar del Rio,
the Spanish minister ot state, Inviting
the United States to stato the terms upon
which It would be willing to make peace.
OUR TERMS MADE KNOWN.
On July 20, by a communication ad
dressed to Duko Almodlvar. and handed
by M, Cambon, the terms ot this govern
ment were announced substantially as hi
tho protocol, afterwards signed. On Au
gust 10. the Spanish reply, dated August
7, was handed by M. Cambon to the sec
retary of stato. It accepted uncondition
ally the terms Imposed as to Cuba, Porto
Rico and an Island ot the Ladrono group,
but nppearod to seek to Introduce lnadmls
slblo reservations In regard to the Phil
ippines. Conceiving that discussion on
this point could neither be practicable or
profitable, I directed that la order to
avoid misunderstanding, tho matter
should bo forthwith closed by proposing
tho embodiment in a formal protocol of
the terms In which the negotiations for
peaco wero to be undertaken. The vaguo
and explicit suggestions ot tho Spanish
note could not be accepted, tho only re
ply being to present as a virtual ultima
tum a draft or protocol embodying the
precise terms tenuerod to Spain In our noto
of July 39, with added stipulations of de
tail as to the appointment of commission
ers to arrange for tho evacuation of the
Spanish Antilles.
THE PROTOCOL SIGNED.
On August 12 M. Cambon announced his
receipt of full powers to sign tho proto
col bo submitted. Accordingly, on tho af
ternoon ot August 12, M. Cambon. as the
plenipotentiary of Spain, nnd the secre
tary of state, as the plenipotentiary of
tho United States, Blgned a protocol pro
viding: "Article 1. Spain will relinquish nil
claim of sovereignty over and tltlo to
Cuba.
"Article 2. Spain will cedo to tho Unit
ed Btates the Island of Porto Itico and
other Islands now under Spanish r.ov
erelgnty In tho West Indies, nnd nlso nn
Island in tho Ladrones, to bo selected by
the United States.
"Article 3. Tile United States will oc
cupy and hold tho city, bay and harbor
of Manila, pending tho conclusion of a
treaty of peaco which shall determine
the control, disposition and government
of the Philippines."
COMMISSIONS PROVIDED FOR.
The fourth article provided for the ap
pointment of Joint commissions on the
part ot the United States and Spain, to
meet In Havana and San Juan, respec
tively, for the purpose of arranging nnd
carrying out tho details of the stipulated
evacuation of Cuba, Porto Rico and other
Spanish possessions In the West Indies.
Tho fifth article provided for the ap
pointment of not moro than flvo com
missioners on each sldo, to meet at Paris,
not later than October 1, and to proceed
to tho negotiations and conclusions of a
treaty of peace, subject to ratification ac
cording to tho respective constitutional
forms of tho two countries.
The sixth and last artlclo provided that
upon the signature of tho protocol, hos.
tilltles between the two countries snould
bo suspended, and that notice to that ef
fect should be given as soon as possible
by ench government to tho commanders
of Its military and naval forces.
HOSTILITIES SUSPENDED.
Immediately upon tho conclusion of th
protocol I Issued a proclamation on Au
gust 12, suspending hostilities on the part
of the United States. The necessary or.
ders to that end were at once given by
telegraph. Tho blockade of the ports ol
Cuba and San Juan de Porto Ilico was In
llko manner raised. On August 18, the
muster out of 100,000 volunteers, or asnear
that number as was found to be practlca
ble, was ordered.
VOLUNTEERS MUSTERED OUT.
On December 1, 101,1(3 ofllcers and men
had been mustered out and discharged
from tho services, 9.002 moro will bo mus.
tered out by the 10th of tho month. Alsc
a corresponding number of generals nnd
general staff officers havo been honora
bly discharged from tho Bervlce. The
military commissions to superintend the
evacuation of Cuba, Porto Ttlco and the
adjacent Islands wero forthwith appoint
ed: For Cuba MaJ.-Gen. James F. Wade,
Rear-Admiral William T. Sampson, MaJ.
Gen. Matthew Butler; for Porto Blco:
MaJ.-Gen. John C. Brooke, Rear-Admiral
Wlnneld S. Schley. Brlg.-Gen. W. Gordon,
who soon afterward met the Spanish com
missioners at Havana and San Juan re
spectively. THE WORK OF THE COMMISSIONS.
The Porto Rlcan Joint commission speed
ily accomplished Its task, and by October
13 the ovncuntlon of the Island was com
pleted. The United States flag was raised
aver the Island at noon on that day. The
administration of Its affairs has been pro
visionally Intrusted to a military gover
nor until the congress shall otherwise
provide. Tho Cuban Joint commission has
not yet terminated Its labors. Owing to
the difficulties In tho way of removing the
largo numbers of Spanish troops still In
Cuba, tha ovacuatlon can not bo com
pleted beforo the 1st of January next.
THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS.
Pursuant to the fifth article of tho pro
tocol, I appointed William R. Day, late
secretary of state: Cushman K. Davis,
Wm. P. Fryo and George Gray, senators
of tho United States, nnd Whltelaw Held,
to bo tho peace commissioners on tho part
of the United States. Proceeding In due
season to Paris, they there met, on the
1st of October, five commissioners Blml
larly appointed on the part of Spain. The
negotiations have mado hopeful progress,
so that I trust soon to be able tolayaden.
plto treaty of peaco beforo tho senate.
With a revlow ot the steps loading to Its
signature.
FUTURE OP NEW POSSESSIONS.
I do not discuss at this timo tho gov
ernment or the tuturo of tho now posses
sions which will come to us as the result
of tho war with Spain. Such a discussion
will bo appropriate after the treaty ot
peace shall bo ratified. In tho meantime,
and until tho congress has legislated oth
erwise. It will be my duty to continue the
military governments which have existed
since our occupation and government, as
suring the people security hi llfo and
property, and encouragement under a Just
and beneficent rule.
THE FUTURE OP CUBA.
As soon as wo are In possession of Cuba,
and hnvo pacified tho Island, It will bo
necessary to give aid nnd direction to Us
peoplo to form a government for them
selves. This should bo undertaken at the
earliest moment, consistent with safety
and assured success. It Is Important that
our relations with these people shall be of
the most friendly character, and our com
mercial relations close and reciprocal It
should be our duty to assist In every prop
er way to build up the waste places of
tho Island, encourage tho Industry of tho
people, and assist them to form a govern
ment which shall bo freo and Independent,
thus realizing tho best aspirations of the
Cuban people.
Spanish rulo must bo replaced by a Just,
benevolent and humane government,
crented by tho people of Cuba, capablo ot
performing all International obligations,
and which shall encourage thrift, Indus
try and prosperity, and promote peaco
and good will among all of tho Inhabit
ants, whatever may havo been their re
lations In tho past. Neither revengo nor
passion should havo a place In tho new
government. Until there Is completo
tranquillity In the Island, and a stable gov
ernment Inaugurated, military occupation
will bo continued.
With tho exception of the rupture with
Spain, tho Intercourse of tho United States
with tho great family of nations has
been mnrked with cordiality, nnd tho
closo ot the eventful year finds most of
tho Issues that necessarily nrlso In the
complex relations of sovereign states ad
Justed or presenting no serious obstacles
to a Just and honorable solution byamlca
ble agreemnt.
ARGENTINA AND CHILI.
A long unsettled dlsputo as to the ex
tended boundary between tho Argentine
Republic and Chill, stretching along tho
Andean crests from tho southern border
of tho Atacama desert to Magellan
straits, nearly a third of tho length of the
South American continent, assumed an
acuta stago In the early part ot the year
and afforded this government occasion
to express tho hope that the resort to ar
bitration, already contemplated by exist
ing conventions between tho pnrtlcs,
might prevail, dcsplto tho grave difficul
ties arising In Its application. I am hap
Ey to say that arrangements to this end
ave been perfected, the questions of
fact upon which tho respective commis
sioners wero unable to ngrco being In
courso of reference to her Britannic maj
esty for tho determination. A residual
difference touching tho northern bound
ary lino ncross the Atacama desert, for
which existing treaties provided no ade
quate adjustment, bids fair to ba settled
In llko manner by Joint commission, up
on which tho United States minister at
Buenos Ayres had been Invited to servo
as umpire In tho last resort.
A COMPLICATED MATTER.
I have found occasion to approach the
Argentine government with a view to re
moving differences ot rate charges Im
posed upon tho cables of an American
corporation In tho transmission between
Buenos Ayres nnd the cities of Urguay
and Brazil of through messages passing
from and to the United States. Al
though the matter Is complicated by ex
clusive concessions by Uruguay and Bra
zil to foreign companies, there ts strong
hope that a good understanding will ba
reached, and that the Important chnnncls
of commercial communication between
tho United States and tho Atlantic cities
of South America may bo freed from an
almost prohibitory discrimination.
AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT
In this relation, I may bo permitted to
express my sense of tho fitness of nn In
ternational agreement whereby the Inter
change of messages overconncctingcables
may bo regulated on a fair basis of uni
formity. Tho world has seen tho postal
system developed from Incongruous Inde
pendent and exclusive scrvlco Into a well
ordered union, of which all countries find
tho manifold benefits. It would bo strango
wero tho nations not In tlmo brought to
rcalizo that modern civilization, which
owes so much of Its progress to tho an
nihilation of spaco by tho electric force,
demands that this all-Important means of
communication, a herltago of all peoples,
be administered and regulated In their
common behalf. A step In this direction
was taken when the International con
vention ot 1SSI, for the protection of sub
marine cables, was signed, and tho day
Is, I trust, not far distant when this
medium for tho transmission of thought
from land to land may be brought within
tho domain of International concert as
completely as In tho material carriage of
commcrco and correspondence upon the
faco ot the waters that divide them.
THE PAGE CLAIM ADJUSTED.
Tho claim of Thomas Jefferson Page
against Argentina, which has been pend
ing many years, has been adjusted. The
sum awarded by tho congress of Argen
tina was (4,212.35.
RELATIONS WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.
The sympathy of the Amorlcan peoplo
has Justly been offered to tho ruler and
tho people of Austria-Hungary by reason
of tho affliction that has lately befallen
him In the assassination ot the empress
queen of that historic realm.
On tho 10th of September, 1237, a con
flict took placo at Latimer, I'a., between
n body ot striking miners and the sheriff
of Luzerno county and his deputies. In
which 22 miners wero killed and 41 wound
ed, ot which ten of the killed and 12 of
the wounded wero Austrian and Hun
garian subjects. This deplornblo event
naturally aroused tho solicitude ot the
Austro-Hungarlan government, which, on
the assumption that the killing and
wounding involved the unjustifiable mis
uso of authority, claimed reparation for
tho BufTercrs. Apart from the searching
Investigation, nnd tho peremptory action
of tho authorities of Pennsylvania, the
fcdoral executive took appropriate steps
to learn tho merits of the case, in order
to bo In a position to meet the urgent
complaint of a friendly power. The sher
iff and hU deputies, having been Indicted
for murder, were tried and acquitted af
ter protracted proceedings and tho hear
ing of Hundreds of witnesses, on the
ground that the killing was In the lino ot
their official duty to uphold law and pre
serve public order In tno stab?. A repre
sentative ot tho department of Justice at
tended tho trials and reported Its course
fully. With all the facts In Us posses
sion this government expects to reach a
harmonious understanding on the subject
with that of Austria-Hungary, notwith
standing the renewed claim of the lat
ter after learning tho result of the trial
for Indemnity for Its injured subjects.
THE BRUSSELS EXPOSITION.
Despite th6 brief tlmo allotted tor prep
aration, t.o exhibits ot this country at
tho universal exposition at Brussels, In
1!97, enjoyed tho singular distinction of a
larger proportion of awards, having re
gard to the number and classes of arti
cles entered, than those of other coun
tries. The worth of such a result In
making known our national capacity to
supply tho wolrd's markets Is obvious.
Exhibitions ot this International charac
ter are becoming more frequent as the ex
changes of commercial countries grow
more Intimate and varied. Hardly a year
passes that this government Is not In
vited to national participation nt some
Important foreign center, but often on too
short notice to permit of recourse to con
gress for the power and means to do so.
My predecessors havo suggested the ad
visability of providing, by a general enact
ment and a standing appropriation, for
accepting such invitations and for rep
resentation of this country by a commis
sion. This plan has my cordial approval.
BELGIAN RESTRICTION ON AMERI
CAN CATTLE.
I trust tho Belgian restriction on the
Importations of cattlo from tho United
States, originally adopted as a sanitary
precaution, will at an early date bo satis
fied us to their present and future ot
hnrdshlp and discrimination so as to ad
mit live cattle under due regulation ot
their slaughter after landing. I am hopo
ful, too, of a favorablo change In the Bel
gian treatment of our preserved and salt
ed meats. The growth of direct trado be
tween tho two countries, not alono for
Belgian consumption and Belgian prod
ucts, but by way of transit frojn and to
other continental states, has been both
encouraging and beneficial. No effort will
be spared to onlargo Its advantages by
seeking the removal ot neodless Impedi
ments, and by arrangements for Increased
commercial exchanges.
EVENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
Tho year's events In Central America
deserve moro than passing mention.
A menacing rupturo uetween Costn
Rica and Nicaragua was happily com-
Cosed by the slgnnturo of a convention
otween the partlei, with the concur
rence of the Guatomalean representative
ni a mediator, the net being negotiated
and signed nn board tho United States
steamship Alert, then lying In Central
American waters. It Is believed that the
good offices of our envoy and commander
of thut vessel contributed towards this
grntl'ylng outcome.
In my last annual message tho situa
tion was presented with respect to tho
diplomatic repicsentatlon of tills govern
ment In Central America, created by tho
association of Nicaragua, Honduras and
Salvudor, under tho tltlo of the Greater
Republic ot Central America, and the
delegation ot their International func
tions to the diet thereof. Whilo tho repre
sentative character of the diet wns rec
ognized by my predecessor, and has been
confirmed during my administration by
receiving Its accredited envoy and grant
ing exequaturs to consuls commissioned
under Its authority, that recognlzatton
was qualified by the distinct understand
ing that tho responsibility of each of the
component Boverclgn republics toward
the United States remained wholly un
affected. A NEEDFUL PROVISO.
This proviso was needful, Inasmuch as
tho compact of tho three republics was,
at the outset, an association whereby
certain representative functions were
delegated to a trlpartlto commission
rather than a federation possessing cen
tralized powers of government and ad
ministration. In this vlow of their rela
tion and tho relation of tho United
States to tho several republics, a change
In tho representation of this country in
Central America was neither recom
mended by tho exccutlvo nor Initiated by
congress, thus leaving ono of our envoys
accredited as heretofore separately to
two states of tho areater Republic, Nic
aragua and Salvador, and to a third
state, Costa Rica, which was not a party
to the compact, while our other envoy
was similarly accredited to tho union
stato 'of Honduras and tho non-union
state of Guatemala. The result has been
that one hns presented credentials only
to tho president of Costa Rica, tho other
having been received only by the govern
ment ot Guatemala.
UNITED STATES OP CENTRAL
AMERICA.
Subsequently tho three associated repub
lics entered Into negotiations for making
tho steps forecast In tho original compact.
A convention of their delegates framed
for them a federal constitution undor the
name ot the United States ot Central
America, and provided for a central fed
eral government and legislature. Upon
ratification by tho constituent Btates, the
1st of November last was fixed for the
new system to go Into operation. Within
a few weeks afterwards tho plan was se
verely tested by revolutionary movements
arising, with a consequent demand for
unity ot notion on the part of tho mili
tary power of the federal states to sup
press them. Under this strain the now
union seems to havo been weakened
through tho withdrawal of Its moro Im
portant members. This government was
not officially advised ot the Installation
of the fedaratlon, and has maintained an
attitude of friendly expectancy, while In
no wise relinquishing the position held
from the outset that tho responsibilities
of tho several states toward us remained
unaltered by their tentative relations
among themselves.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
Tho Nicaragua canal commission, under
tho chairmanship ot Rear-Admiral John
G. Walker, appointed July 21, 1897, under
the authority ot a provision In the sun
dry civil act ot Juno 4 ot that year, has
nearly completed Us labors, and tho re
sults of Its exhaustive Inquiry Into tho
proper route, the feasibility and the cost
ot construction of an Inter-oceanic canal
by a Nlcaraguan route will be laid before
you. I tho performance ot Its task the
coramis n received all possible courtesy
and assistance from tho governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which thus
testified their appreciation ot the Im
portance ot giving a speedy and practical
Strong and
War and its
outcome to tho great project that has for
so many years engrossed tho attention of
tho rcspectlvo countries.
AS THE MATTER STANDS.
As tho scopo of recent Inquiry em
braced tho whole subject, with tho view
ot making plans and surveys for a canal
by tho most convenient route, It neces
sarily Included a review of the results of
previous surveys and plans, and In par
ticular those adopted by tho Maritime
Canal Co., under Its existing concessions
from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, so that
to this extent these grants necessarily
held an essential part In the deliberations
and conclusions of the canal commission,
as they havo held, and must need hold. In
tho discussion of tho matter by the con
gress. Under theso circumstances, and
In view of the overtures made to tho
overments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica
y other parties for a new can! conces
sion predicated on the assumed approach
ing lapse of the contracts of the Mafltlmo
Canal Co. with those states, I have not
hesitated to express my conviction that
considerations of expediency and Inter
national policy as between tho several
governments Interested In the construc
tion and control of an Intcr-occanlc canal
by this routo requlro tho maintenance of
tho status quo until tho canal commis
sion shall have reported, and tho United
States congress shall have had the op
portunity to pass finally upon the wholo
matter during the present session, with
out prejudice by reason ot any charge In
the existing conditions.
NICARAGUA'S SECOND GRANT.
Nevertheless it appears that tho gov
ernment of Nlcarauga, as one ot Its last
sovereign acts before merging Its powera
Into those of tho newly-formed United
States ot Central America, has granted an
optional concession to another associa
tion, to becomo effective on the expiration
ot tho present grant. It docs rt uppear
what surveys have been made or what
routo Is proposed under this contingent
grant, so that an examination of the feas
ibility of Us plans Is necessarily not em
braced In tho report of tho canal com
mission. All theso circumstances suggest
tho urgency of some deflnlto action by
the congress at this session It the labors
of the past are to bo utilized, and the
Unking of tho Atlantic and Paclfla oceans
by a prfactlcal waterway Is to bo realized.
That tho construction of such s, marltlmo
highway Is now more than ever Indispen
sable to moro lntlmato and ready Inter
communication between our eastern and
western seaboards, demanded by the an
nexation of tho Hawaiian Islands, and
tho prospective expansion of our lnfluenco
and commcrco In the Pacific, and that
our national policy, now moro Imperative
ly than ever, calls for Us control by this
government, aro propositions which I
oubt not tho congress will duly appre
ciate and wisely act upon.
UNITED STATES AND CHILIAN
CLAIMS.
A convention providing for tho rovlval
of tho lato United States and Chilian
claims commission, but not considered bo
causo of the expiration ot tho time lim
ited for tho duration of the commission,
was signed May 24, 1837, and has re
mained unacted upon by the senate. Tho
term therein fixed for effecting tho ex
change of ratifications having elapsed,
the convention falls unless tho time bo
extended by nmendment, which I am en
deavoring to bring about, with tho friend
ly concurrence ot the Chilian govern
ment. EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
The United States hns not been an Indif
ferent spectator of tho extraordinary
events transpiring in the Chinese empire,
whereby portions of Us maritime provin
ces, are passing under tho control of va
rious European powers; but tho prospetc
that tho vast commerce which the energy
of our citizens and tho necessity ot our
stnplo productions for Chinese uses has
built up In those regions may not be prej
udiced through and exccutlvetreatmentbv
the new occupants, has obviated tho need
of our country becoming an actor in tho
sceno.
Our position among nations having a
largo Pacific coast and a constantly ex
panding direct trade with tho farther
orient, gives us the equitable claim to
consideration and friendly treatment In
this regard, and It will bo my aim to sub
serve our largo interests in that quarter
by all means upproprlato to tho constant
policy ot our government. Tho territories
of Klao Chau, of Wel-Hal-Wcl. and of
Port Arthur nnd Tallen Wan, leased to
Germany, Great Britain and Russia re
spectively for terms of years, will, It Is
announced, bo open to International com
merco during such alien occupation; and
If no discriminating treatment of Ameri
can citizens and their trade be found to
exist, or be hereafter developed, tho do
slro of this government would appear to
be realized.
ACTION RECOMMENDED.
In this relation, as showing tho volume
and vnluo of our exchanges with China,
and the peculiarly invorable conditions
which exist for their expansion In. tho
normal courso ot trade, I refer to tho
communication addressed to the speaker
of tho house ot representatives- by tho
secretary of the treasury, on the 14th of
last June, with Its nccompau, ig lettor
of tho secretary of state, recommending
an nppropriatlon for a commission to
study the commercial and Industrial con
ditions In the Chlneso empire and report
as to tho opportunities for, and obstacles
to, the enlargement of markets In China
for tho raw products and manufactures
of the United States. Action was not
taken thereon during the lato sgsslon. I
cordially urge that the recommendation
recelvo at your hands the consideration
which Us Importance and timeliness mer
it. JUST GROUND TOR DISQUIETUDE.
Meanwhile there may bo Just ground for
disquietude of the unrest, nnd rovlval of
the old sentiment of opposition and preju
dice to alien people which pervades cer
tain of tho Chlneso provinces. As In tho
caso nt tho attacks upon our citizens In
Szcchuan and at Kutlen, In 1833, tho Unit
ed States mlnUter has been Instructed to
sccuro tho fullest measure of protection,
both local nnd Imperial, for ly menaced
American Interests, und to demand. In
case of lawless Injury to person or prop
erty, Instant reparation appropriate to
tho case. Warships hai'o beri Btatlonod
at Tlen-Tsln for moro ready observation
ot tho disorders which havo Invaded even
tho Chinese capital, so as to be In a posi
tion to act, should need arise, while a
guard of marines has been sent to Peking
to afford tho minister tho same measure
of nuthorltattvo protection as tho repre
sentatives of other nations have been
constrained to employ.
THE CERRUTI CLAIM. ARBITRATION.
Following closo upon tho rendition of
the award of my prodecessor as arbitrator
ot the claim ot tho Italian subject Cerrutl,
against tho Republic of Colombia, differ
ences aroso between tho parties to the
arbitration In regard to the scopo and ox
tension of tho award, ot which certain ar
ticles wero contested by Columbia, while
Italy claimed their literal fulfillment. The
award having been made by the president
ot the United States as an act off friendly
consideration, and with tho solo view to
an Impartial composition of the matter
in dispute, I could, not but teal concern
at such a mlscarrlago and, whilo unable
to accept tho Colombian theory that I,
In my official capacity, possessed continu
ing function as arbitrator, with power to
Interpret or revise tho terms of the
award, my best efforts were lent to bring
ing tho parties til-j harmonious agree
ment as to the exclK'on of Its provisions.
ITALY'S NAVAlFlEIMONSTRATION.
A naval demonstration by Italy result
ed In an engagement to pay the liabilities
claimed upon their ascertainment, but
this apparent disposition ot tho contro
versy was followed toy a rupture of diplo
matic Intercourse between Colombia and
Italy, which still continues, although, for
tunately, without acute symptoms having
supervened. Notwithstanding this, ef
forts are reported to be continuing tor
tho ascertainment ot Colombia's contin
gent liability on acount of tne Cerruttl
debts, under the fifth article ot the award.
'AN AMERICAN OUAI'M UNPAID.
A claim ot on American citizen against
the Dominican RepubKo tor a publK
bridge orer the Ozama river, which has
been In diplomatic controversyfor sev
eral years, has been settled by expert ar
bitration, And an award In ifavor of the
claimant amounting to about 130,000. It,
however, remains unpaid despite urgent
demands for Us settlement according to
the terms ot tho compact.
THE PARIS EXPOSITION IN 190&
There Is now every prort that th

in 1900 will be on a scale commensurate
with tho advanced posltlvu held by our
products and Industries In the world's
