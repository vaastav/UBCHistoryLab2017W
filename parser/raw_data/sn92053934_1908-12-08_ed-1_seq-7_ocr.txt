v THE ARGUS. TUESDAY. DECEMBER' 8. 1908.
LAST ANNUAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT
TO THE SECOND SESSION OF THE SIXTIETH CONGRESS
Washington, Dec. 8. In Lis message
to congress, read to the' two houses,
the president said:
The financial standing of the nation
at the present time Is excelleut. and
' the financial management of the na
tion's Interests by the government dur
ing the last seven years has shown the
most satisfactory results. But our
currency system is Imperfect, and it
Is earnestly to be hoped that the cur
rency commission will be able to pro
pose a thoroughly good system which
will do away with the existing defects.
During the period from July 1. 15)01,
to Sept. 30, 1908, there has been n net
surplus of nearly one hundred millions
of receipts over expenditures, a reduc
tion of the Interest bearing debt by
ninety millions, In spite of the extraor
dinary expense of the Panama canal
and a saving of nearly nine millions
on the annual Interest charge. This Is
ail exceedingly satisfactory showing.
There has been a reduction of taxa
tion. Corporations.
As regards the great corporations en
gaged in Interstate business, and espe
cially the railroads, I can only repeat
what I have already again and again
said In my messages to the congress.
I believe that under, the interstate
clause of the constitution the United
States has complete and paramount
right to control all agencies of inter
state commerce, and I believe that the
national government alone can exer
cise this right with wisdom and ef
fectiveness so as both to secure Justice
from and to do justice to the great
corporations which are the most Im
portant factors In modern business. 1
lelleve that it Is worse than folly to
attempt to prohibit all combinations
as Is done by the Sherman anti-trust
law, because such a law can be en
forced only Imperfectly and unequal
ly, and Its enforcement works almost
as much hardship as good. I strongly
advocate that instead of an unwise
effort to prohibit all combinations there
shall be substituted a law which shall
expressly permit' combinations which
are in the interest of the public, but
shall at the same time give to some
agency of the national government f all
power of control and supervision over
them. One of the chief features of
this control Ehould be securing entire
publicity in all matters which the pub
lic has a right to know and. further
more, the power, not by judicial, but
by executive, action to prevent or put
a Btop to every form of Improper fa
voritism or other wrongdoing.
The railways of the country should
be put completely under the interstate
commerce commission and removed
from the domain of the anti-trust law.
The power of the commission should
be made thoroughgoing, so that It
could exercise complete supervision
and control over the Issue of securities
as well as over the raising and lower
ing of rates. As regards rates, at least
this power should be summary. Tow

that there are wise and unwise Judges,

for his term is short. The same Is
true with the legislator, although not

Labor.
There are many matters affecting la
bor and the status of the wageworkcr
to which I should like to draw your
cotting In every form. The demand
was made that there should be trial
by jury In contempt cases, thereby
most seriously impairing the authority
of the courts. All this represented a
course of policy which, if carried out.
would mean the enthronement of class
privilege In its crudest and most
brutal form and the destruction of
one of the most essential functions of
attention. As far as possible I hope the Judiciary in all civilized lands
to see a frank recognition of the ad
vantages conferred by machinery, or
ganization and division of labor, ac
companied by an effort to bring about
a larger share in the ownership by

Forests.
If there Is any one duty which more
than another we owe it to our children
and our children's children to perform
at once it is to, save the forests of
this country, for they constitute the
first and most Important element in
the conservation of the natural re
sources of the country.
Shortsighted persons, or persons
blinded to the future by desire to
make money in every way out of the
present, sometimes speak as if no
great damage would be done by the
reckless destruction of our forests. It
Is dilficult to have patience with the
arguments of these persons. Thanks
to our own recklessness in the use of
our splendid forests, we have already
crossed the verge of a timber famine
in this country, and no measures that
we now take can, at least for many
years, undo the mischief that has al
ready been done. But we can prevent
further mischief being done, and it
would be In the highest degree repre
hensible to let any consideration of
temporary convenience or temporary
cost Interfere with such action, espe
daily as regards the national forests,
which the nation can now at this very
moment control.
The president here cites in support
of his contentious the great destruc
tion wrought In China by the denuda
tion of the forest areas.
What has thus happened In northern
China, what has happened In central
Asia, in Palestine, In north Africa, in
parts of the Mediterranean countries
of Europe, will surely happen in our
country if we do not exercise that
wise forethought which should be one
of the chief marks of any people call
ing Itself civilised. "Nothing should be
permitted to stand in the way, of the
preservation cf 'the forests, and it is
criminal to permit individuals to pur
chase a little gnln for themselves
through the destruction of forests
when this destruction is fatal to the
well being of the whole country In the
future.
Inland Waterways.
Action should be begun forthwith,
during the present session of congress,
for the Improvement of our inland wa
terways action which will result in
giving us not only navigable but
navigated rivers. We have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars upon
these waterways, yet the traffic on
nearly all of them is steadily declin
lug. This condition is the direct re
sult of the absence of any compre
hensive and farseelng plan of water
way improvement. Obviously we can
not continue thus toexpend the rev
enues of the government without re
turn. It Is poor business to spend
money for inland navigation unless
we get it.
Such shortsighted, vacillating and
futile methods are accompanied by de
creasing water borne commerce and
increasing traffic congestion on land,
by increasing floods and by the waste
of public money. The remedy lies in
abandoning the methods which have
so signally failed and adopting new
one3 in keeping with the needs and
demands of our people.
In a report on a measure Introduced
at the first session of the present con
gress the secretary of war said, "The
chief defect in the methods hitherto
pursued lies in the absence of execu
tive authority for originating compre
hensive plans covering the country or
natural divisions thereof." In this
opinion I heartily concur.
Until the work of river Improvement
Is undertaken in a modern way it cau
not have results that will meet the
needs of this modern nation. These
needs should be met without further
dilly-dallying or delay. The plan which
promises the best and quickest results
Is thnt of a permanent commission au
thorized to co-ordinate the work of all
the government departments relating
to waterways and to frame and super
vise the execution of a comprehensive
plan. The time for playing with our
waterways is past. The country de
mands results.
National Parks.
I urge that all our national parks ad
jacent to national forests be placed
completely under the control of the
forest service of the agricultural de
partment, instead of leaving them, as
they are now, under the Interior de
partment and policed by, the army.

Public Health.
The dangers to public health from
food adulteration and from many oth
er sources, such as the menace to the
physical, mental and moral develop
ment of children from child labor,
should be met and overcome. This na
tion cannot afford to lag behind in the
worldwide battle now being waged
by all civilized people with the micro
scopic foes of mankind. The first leg
islative step t be taken Is that for the
concentration of the' proper bureaus
Into one of the existing departments.
Statehood.
I advocate the immediate admission
of New Mexico and Arizona as states.
This should be donc at the present ses
sion of the congress. The people of
the tw territories have made it evi
dent by thejr votes that they will not
come ln ns one state. The only alter
native is to admit them as two, and I
trust that this will be done without
delay.
Foreign Affairs.
This nation's foreign policy Is based
on the theory that right must be done
between nations precisely as between
individuals, and in our actions for the
last ten years we have in this matter
proved our faith by our deeds. We
have behaved and are behaving to
ward other nations as in private life an
honorable man would behave toward
his fellows.
Latin American Republics.
The commercial and material prog
ress of the twenty Latin American re
publics is worthy of the careful atten
tion of the congress. No other section
of the world has shown a greater pro
portionate development of its foreign
trade during the last ten years, and
none other has more special claims on
thejnterest of the United States. -
Panama Canal.
: The work on the Panama canal 13 be
ing done with a speed, efficiency and
entire devotion to duty which make it
a model for all work of the kind. No
task of such magnitude has ever before
been undertaken. b any nation, and no
port they visited.
Th Army.
As regards the army, I call attention
to the fact that, while our junior ofil
eers cud enlisted men stand very high,
the present system of promotion by
seniority results in bringing into the
higher grades many men of mediocre
capacity who have but a 6hort time to
serve. No man should regard it as
his vested right to rise to the highest
rank in the army any more than !n
any other profession.
The .scope of retlrinsr boards should
be extended so that they "could con
sider general unfitness to command
for any cause in order to secure a far
more rigid enforcement than at pres
ent in the elimination of, officers for
mental, physical or ' temperamental
disabilities. But this plan is recom
mended only if the congress dos not
see fit to provide what in my judg-
ment Is far better that ts, for selec
tion in promotion and for elimination
for age.
Now that the organized militia, the
national guard, has been incorporated
with the army as a part of the national
forces it behooves the government to
do every reasonable thing in its pow
er to perfect its efflcienc;.
A bill is now pending before the
congress creating a number of extra
officers in the army, which, if passed,
as it ought to be, will enable more of
ficers to be trained as Instructors of
national guard and assigned to that
duty.
There should be legislation to pro
vide a complete plan for organiz
ing the great body of volunteers be
hind the regular army and national
guard when war has come. While
teams representing the United States
won the rifle and revolver champion
ships of the world against all comers
in England this year, it is unfortunate
ly true that the great body of our citi
zens shoot less and less as time goes
on.
To meet this we should encourage
rifle practice among schoolboys and
indeed among all classes, as well as
in the military services, by every
means in our power.
The Navy.
I approve the recommendations of
the general board for the increase of
the navy, calling especial attention to
the need of additional destroyers and
colliers and. above all. of the four bat
tleships. It is desirable to complete
as soon as possible a squadron of eight
battleships of the best existing type.
The North Dakota. Delaware, Florida
and Utah will form the first division

I most earnestly recommend that the
general board be by law turned Into
a general staff. The is literally uo
excuse whatever for continuing the
present bureau organization of the
navy! The navy should be treated as
purely military organization, and
everything should be subordinated to
the one object of securing military
efficiency. A system of promotion by
merit, cither by selection or by ex
clusion er by both processes, should be
Introduced.
Nothing ' better for the navy from
every standpoint, has ever occurred
than the cruise of the battle fleet
around the world. The improvement
of the ships In every way has been ex
traordinary, and they have gained far
more experience in battle tactics than
they would have gamed If they had
stayed In the Atlantic waters. I do
not believe that there is any other
service in the world in which the
average of character and efficiency. in
the enlisted men is as high as is now
the case in our own. I believe that the
rame statement can be made as to our
officers, taken as a whole, but there
must be a reservation made in regard
io those in the highest ranks and in
regard to those who have just entered
the service, because we do not now
get full benefit from our excellent
naval school at Annapolis.
