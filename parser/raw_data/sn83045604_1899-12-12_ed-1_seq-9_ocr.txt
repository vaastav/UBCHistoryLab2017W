felted that he should be authorized to
make another lecturing and organising

ed:
"The Western Federation of Miners,

Federation at this time, could no doubt be
perauaded that their present unaffiliated
position renders them liable to attacks
from which they would practically be free

ltoriews Wardnrr Trouble.
Reviewing the events of the past year
•t Wardner, Idaho, President Gompers de
clared that from the best sources available
be learns# that the destruction or property
of the Baker HUi and Sullivan mines was
the act of unorganized miners. Of the
corralling of 1,200 miners by the state au
thorities, aided by Gen. Merrlam. he said:
"The whole proceeding Is so outrageous
at to bring a blush of ehame to the cheeks
of every liberty-loving American. If, as
tileged. the Imprisoned men are guilty,
the)- at least should be given a fair trial
before a Jury of their peers, confronted
with their accusers, and, If guilty, pun-
Uhed; If Innocent, they should be given
their liberty and their wrongs should be
redreaaed. This convention In no mistaken
termn should express Its keen Indignation
and emphatic protest against this outrage
upon human rights. The killing of inno
cent men upon the public highway of Lat
timer, the shooting down of unarmed men
at Buffalo, the Incarceration of workmen
guilty of no offense In Idaho, and the out
lawry of organised labor must tie frowned
down upon: must be met with the con-<
sclouaness of our rights, the manhood to
atclare them and the -determination to
achieve them."
Prerident Gompers urged "renewed and
roneentrated effort" to bring about a re
duction of the hours of toil in all depart
ments of labor. He suggested that the
"invention authorize an investigation In
regard to the eight-hour law of Colorado,
»n'.ch the supreme court of the state de
fied to be unconstitutional, "and. If
laure be good grounds for an appeal to
the United States supreme court such an
«ppeal should be taken by the American
Federation of Labor in co-operation with

Treasurer'* Report.
Treaeucer John B. Lonnon, tn hla annual
report said:
"Never in the history of the federation
has our treasury been so strong, and of
more- Importance even than a strong treas
ury Is this fact that our Income dur
ing the past year has enabled the federa
tion to carry on more organizing work than
during any year In Its history.
The report shows that a balance of 12,-
391.42 remained In his hands November 1,
1898. The year's receipts were 131,757.18 and
the disbursements 130.a99.t2, leaving a bal
ance on hand November 1, 1899, of 18,519.33.
The balance of the seaslon was taken up
with the contention between the rival
unions of the theatrical employes and the
musicians In Detroit. No solution of the

GERMANY'S NAVAL PROGRAMME.
Von Hnelow Make* a Strong Appeal
for More Veaael*.
BERLIN, Dec. 11.—During the debate on
tbe estimates In the relchstag today Count
Von Buelow. the minister of foreign affairs,
reiterated the terms of the various agree
ment* for partitioning Samoa between the
United States and Germany, for repealing
the Samoan act and for submitting to ar
bitration the losses resulting from unjusti
fiable military action on the part of offi
cers belonging to either of the states. He
said that after the assent of the United
States and the hundesrath bills ratifying
the treaty would be submitted. In the
meanwhile he hoped the iClclutag would not
discuss the matter. He added that no In
crease In nert year's Imperial budget would
arise from the supplemental estimates for
Samoa.
Prince Hohenlobe, the Imperial chancel
lor, then announced that the Federal gov
ernment had come to the conclusion that
the present navy was insufficient for the
country's needs, and that estimates for
doubling the present number of warships
would be submitted.
He added that the period within which
the Increase of the new navy would be
affected was not to be ftjed by law, the
number of new ships to be provided for an
nually In the estimates decided In
accordance with the urgency requirements.
Count Von Ituelow, In supporting the
proposed Increase In the navy, said:
"The president of the I'nlted States in his
message, expressed himself conct rninit tho
good relations between the United States
and ourselves with a warmth that fills us
with sincere satisfaction. As far a? Great
Britain Is concerned wa are willing and
ready to live In peace and concord with
her on the basis of full reciprocity and
rectproeal consideration."
Count Von Buelow also Justified the in
crease In the navy from a political point
of view and declared Germany's policy
had nlwavs maintained an even course be
tween neglecting and overdoing trans
oceanic interests.
Alluding to the warlike changes and rev
olutions of the past few years he said: "We
must be assured against surprise not only
on land but at sea. We must cieit" and
possess a fleet strong enough to exclude at
tack bv any podfer and I emphasize attack,
for in the absolute peacefulness of our pol
icy It can never he other than a question
of defense, German foreign pollcv ig neith
er covetous, restless nor fanciful.
"In the coming century the German peo
ple must be either the hammer or the anvil.
Tn tho name of the country's best Interest
I entreat your favorable reception of the
navy bill."

Special Dispatch to the Post-Intelllgenc*r.
WASHINOTON, Dec. 11.—Comment on
the president's message la almost wholly
favorable among public men here. It la
regarded as one of the Ablest state papers
of recent years, and by all means the
boldest declaration Mr. McKlnley has
made he became president. The
unusual lengtff of the document made Its
reading drag tlresomely In both house
and senate, and the majority of the mem
bers, as Is customary, contented them
selves with reading the message In Its
pamphlet form Instead of listening at
tentively to the voice of the clerk.
There were some amusing features at
tending the reading of the message, espe
cially In the senate. Mr. Hanna paid no
attention to the clerk, but perused his
printed copy as eagerly as If he expected
to And some pleasant revelation. He held
the message strnlght out in front of his
face nnd became apparently absorbed.
Then he laid the pamphlet on his desk
and leaning over followed the lines with
his fore finger.
Growing weary he rested his head up
on one hand and shadtng his eyes he
still followed the words of the printed
page with his finger as he read them with
absorbing Interest. Then he shifted to
the first posture, and so on to the end.
The funny part of it all was that Mr.
Hanna had been consulted regarding the
message before It left the executive man
sion nnd there was probably little In the
document which had not passed under his
eyes before. Irreverent scamps In the
gallery suggested that Mr. Hanna was
examining the message so closely because
he wanted tn see If the presdent had slip
ped In anything unbeknown to him.
Comment* of Senator*.
Senator Foraker grasped the printed
copy of the message eagerly and, turn
ing to that part relating to foreign af
fairs, read It greedily. Then he dropped
the copy on his desk and paced around
the hall In his customary nervous manner
while the clerk droned wearily through
the lengthy document. Asked afterward
what he thought of the president'* com
munication to congress Senator Foraker
replied: "It was a very able message
and I am pleased wfCh It In Its entirety.
I think most all of Its recommendations
will be followed by congress."
Mr Hanna said: "It Is an able docu
ment: forceful and Instructive."
These are brief comments made by
some of the other senators:
Prye, Maine—l think the president's
message Is a magnificent one. It touches
very Important subjects In a very Intelli
gent manner."
Spooner, Wlsconsln—l think It Is an
nble and exhaustive state paper. It Is
written In the felicitous style which char
acterizes all of the president's messages.
. Beverldge, Indiana—lt Is remarkable
for Its comprehensiveness and for the
breadth of Its statesmanship.
Davis, Mlnnesota—l think the message,
In Its entire scope, Is most admirable.
Except some little matters of detail con
tained In the message It meets with my
unqualified approval.
Cullom, Illinois—The message contains
more and treats of subjects that apper
tain to Internationa! affairs of this coun
try and our relations with foreign pow
ers* better than-any message which has
ever emanated from the White House.
Burrows. Mlchigan—l regard it as a
very clear state paper, covering the en
tire ground of domestic and foreign af
fairs. I was especially gratified at the
financial portion of the document and
the attitude taken regarding the treat
ment to be extended to our new posses
sions. Respecting trusts, I think the
president said all he could say In the
matter.
McComas. Maryland—The message Is
strong, patriotic and wise. The subject
of trusts Li well treated, and the plan of
uniform state legislation, supplemented by
Federal statutes, as proposed, is a wise
method to restrain such combinations as
are dangerous to the public welfare.
Galllnger, New Hampshire—l regard
this message as one of the most compe
tent that ever has been issued. The ques
tions are deult with comprehensively, and
J think the senate and house will follow its
recommendations.
Chilton, Texas President McKinley's
declaration on the trust question Is vague.
I have no doubt that the attitude of the
Republican party is likewise Indistinct, so
far as the Philippine question is oon
cerned. It seems to me the people are en
titled to know from the president Just what
sort of prospective government the admin
istration Intends to inaugurate. He has
not made this subject quite clear enough
to my satisfaction. (Mr. Chi.ton 1., a
Democrat.)
Warren, Wyoming—l think the presi
dent has made out a policy that will be
very valuable to us. and one which will be
valuable to the people.
Chandller, New Hampshire—lt Is a most
admirable message, particularly that por
tion referring to the flag In the Phlllp
-1 Jones. Arkansas- "The president did not
surprise me with hLs trust provision. They
are with trusts as they were with bimetal
lism. They elected the president on this
platform and then repudiated It. So it will
be with trusts; condemned for campaign
purposes mil keep rlsrht on fostering and
maintaining them. (Mr. Jones is chair
man of the Democratic national commit
tee.)
Clark. Wyoming—Covers all subjects ful
ly ami well: a great state paper.
' Keene. New Jersey—lt is an excellent
document, verv strong, and will commend
itself <o the Judgment of the people and
will strengthen the administration.
Thurston, Nebraska—Strong and able,
presenting public nnestlons In a c'ear and
concise manner. Places the future of the
Philippine Islstids where It probably be
longs—with congress.
Pritcbard. North Carolina—A very
«trong message, especially so on trusts,
nri'l will nlace us in a good position before
the country. , '
Fairbanks. Indiana—No questions eith
er avoided or evaded. Everything is han
dled on a lofty and dignified n'ane. and I
regard It as one of the strongest messages
of »ny president.
Clerk. Montana—lt is a strong docu
ment.
Other senators, as TTawlev. Kentucky;
T,odge Massachusetts; TTanshroueh, North
Tinkota: Klklns. West Virginia; Kyle.
South Dakota; Nelson. Minnesota, agree
In commending the message.
Senator Depew said; "It Is a st'.ing,
able, conservative and statesmanlike mes
sa sre."
S.-nator Harris of Kansas. Ponullst, crit
icises the mfssaee in these words: "It is
exceedingly commonplace and rpmarkab'e
otilr for its failure to outline a positive
policy upon the questions-- in which the
people are most interested."
Members of the house who are in politi
cal svmpathy with the president express
substantially the name opinions respecting
the message ss those which have been
quoted from the senators.
Opinions In th«* lloiiir.
Representative Orosvenor said: "The
message Is a document full of sound sense,
pood logic and forceful opinion. Tt is a
dear, good and powerful expression of the
Republican party'? policy."
Representative Cannon said: "The mes
sage is a document of weight."
Representative Steel of Indiana said: "It
Is to my mind unequivocal and sound."

empire here were surprised by the presi
dent's attitude toward Turkey, and one
of them said: "We certainly did not ex
pect the president to comment severely
upon the relations of Turkey with the
United States. It Is of very recent date
that the sultan nave a decided token of
his friendship for the United States."
This diplomat also asserted that, "upon
request of the United States government
the sultan of Turkey used hla Influence
with the sultan of Bulu and materially aid
ed In the settling of many questions aris
ing out of the transfer of the sovereignty
of Spain in the Sulu islands to the United
States. We therefore expected from Presi
dent McKlnley expressions of gratitude
rather than criticism."
At the British emhii*ny It was stated that
the message was entirely satisfactory to
Great Britain, and at the German embassy
the general expression was one of entire
satisfaction, the diplomats there pointing
out that Germany was endeavoring by
every means to respond to the growing
oordlallty between the two governments.

JAPANESE PARLIAMENT OPENS.
Every Prospect That Tliln«» Will Go
Smoothly for the Government.
YOKOHAMA. Nov. 25 (via San Francis
co Dec. 11).—Parliament opened on the

jority of fifty for the ministerial party.
Unless a fight for the spoils causes a di
vision, there is every prospect that things
will go smoothly for the government in
all Its projects.
The sensational reports of the French
carrvlng things with a high hand In China
have dwindled into a commonplace inci
dent in diplomatic negotiations. The Indif
ference, however, with which the original
reports were received and commented up
on is highly significant of the change of
attitude in the public mind. Tidings of
any further Impending partition of the Chi

fact and excite little comment, whereas
only a few months ago they were the oc

nearly all diseases have their beginning In
the disorder of these most Important
organs.
Now by this is not meant that you
should overlook all the other organ* and
merely look after the kidneys.
Your other organs may need attention—
but your kidneys most, because they do

If you are sick do not neglect your kid

they will help all the other organs to
health.
The kidneys may get weak or diseased
from a thousand and one causes; from
overwork, worry, a simple cold, from lift
ing, a strain or t'xeesa In high living.

swelling of the feet and ankles, rheuma
tism. bad blood, gout, gravel, catarrh of
the bladder, sleeplessness, anaemia, ner
vousness, headache or neuralgia.
All these symptoms are due to kidney
trouble, and the most prompt and effect
