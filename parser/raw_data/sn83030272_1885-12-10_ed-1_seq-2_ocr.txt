R The Hurometcr,
I i Tho slzo ot tho surplus Is tho barometer of
tariff agitation. When tho surplus goes up,
I tariff roformors and tinkers autl horlzontai-
fats are busy with tliolr tooguos and pencils,
a and oven tho absolute froo trado doctrinaires
begin to show their noses. When thosur-
I plus goes down Tory far, most of thoso gen-
tlcinon aro silent, for then any oxtonslvo re-
ductlon in tho taxes that yield the nation's
a revenue moans a deficit.
I Tho rcoont upheaval of tariff roform tho-
cries coincides exactly with tho enormous
' lnoreaso in tho avallablo surplus. In 1878
and In 1879 tuore would liavo boon a dctlclt If
tho money duo tho sinking: fund had been ap
plied to that purposo. Then tlicro began to
bo a surplus. Hero aro tho figures from 1830,
reckoning tho sinking fund payments ro
! quired by law as part of thooidlnary oxpen-
j dltures of tho Government :
1880 Actual lurplui f27.tU3.010
1881-ActUal surplus 23,089,204
J8H2-Actul SUXDtOS. 8S.404.a60
I83 Actual surplus. 88.021.744
1884 Actual surplus. 57,603,390
1885-Actual surplus. 17.859.7J3
lSSOEUniated surplus. 24.230,000
According to Secretary MANNiNa'a estl
tnato for tho next fiscal year, thcro will bo a
deficit on June 30, 1887, of $31,589,552.
Thus we pass from a time ot deficit,
through a period In which tho Government
Itoveauos wore enormously In excoss of tho
expenditures, and then back to deficit again.
It is a romarkablo and significant fact
that President Cleveland, in hia mes
eago, treats tho gross surplus of rovonue
I ver expenditure as it It woro the avallablo
margin for a reduction In tho taxes la other
words, as if a largo part ot this gross sur
plus woro not dovotod, in advance, to meet
ing the requirements ot tho sinking fund
taws. Ho puts tho surplus tor tho presont
Ij focal year at $70,000,000, when in fact it prob-
S " bly will not reach 125,000,000, after tho sink
3 log fund requirements havo boca attended to,
1 Then Mr. Cij&vxxiAHD says :
"Th tact that our revenue aro In excess f to actual
BStdsof an economical administration of th Oevsrn-
stent Justifies a reduction In tha amount axaottd from
Via Utopia (or Ita support. A oertaln reduction
aaould b made Ut our customs revenue. Tha amount of
anon reduction having beta determined, the Inquiry fol-
Iowa, where caa It beat ka remitted. I think
I the reduction ihould be made In tha revenue derlvi,d
I tzom a tax upon the Imported neceeearlu of life."
9 But how much margin is there for reduo-
log the taxes, erea on the Imported ata-
(earlos ot life, it tho Administration's esti
mates for noxt year, as presented la Ut.
Man.stnq'3 report, aro approximately cor
rect ? Thoso estimates point to a deficit ot
nearly $25,000,000.
Tho baromotor Indicates that tho approach-
s, log season Is not favorable to tariff agitation.
' The Administration's Foreign Poller
That part of tho President's messago
" which, as dealing with tho rolatlons of tho
United States to forolgn counlilcs, was of
course prepared by Secretary Bayard, Is,
with tho posslblo exception of a slnglo sug
Ce&tlon, faithful to the soundest traditions of
tho Democratic party. Tho blunders of tho
.last Administration aro repudiated or re
trieved, and tho ono creditable per
formance of tho last Secretary of Stnto
J . Is cordially ratified. It will also bo noted
with satisfaction by our peoplo that tho im-
j pudont attempt of tho Austrian court to cir
? cumscrlbo tho right ot our Stato Department
1 to designate its diplomatic representatives
has boon repelled with dignity and firmness.
"Ve are, in short, well pleased to rocognjzo
that in ovory particular, savo ono, tho now
Government's foreign policy oonforms pretty
closoly to tho lines so often and so earnestly
recommended by The So:.
Tho Administration very properly con
demned tho un prcccdented course of our reg
ular and Irregular representatives in tho
, ; Congo Conference, who, it will bo remem
bered, tried to niako tho United States a
, .party to an adjudication of territorial dis
putes on a foreign continent, and to a gunr
antoo ot tho visionary rights ot that so
" .called African State. Mr. IUyaud is much
too sagacious to sanction an Implied acqui
escence in a walvor of tho MoxitoB doctrine,
' and In a futuro reciprocal Intcrfcronco by
European nations in controversies relating
to Central America. Nclthor can ho be Ira-
' , posed upon by tho wlro-ditiwn dis
tinction between a treaty and an
',. ? "act" which soomed so specious to tho
' lato Secretary of Stnto. Whothor tho docu
ment to which our overhasty delegnto at
! Borlln saw fit to affix his signature should,
- t wltli technlcul correctness, bo tcrmod a
troaty or on act, it involves an assertion oi
j powors whoso counterparts our Government
will not Buffer European Stato? to oxorclso
. upon this continent, and thoroforo tho now
r Executive, by expressly withholding its en
dorsement, Invites the Scuato to disavow tho
wholo transaction,
Tho treaties coneludod by tho last Admin
istration, but which lack cither tho sanc
tion ot tho Bonato or enabling legislation by
tho House of Reprosontatlvos, aro handled
with tho warlnoss aud discrimination upon
which wo havo ropeatedly insisted in these
columns. Tho Nicaragua troaty is su mmaril y
discarded for tho strongest and most ob
vious of many cogent reasons, namely, that
lb would subject our Government to fiscal
burdens and international com plications
;. lncalculablo in extent and Irreconcll-
ablo with our traditional policy, Tho
Spanish treaty, also, which almeti
to modify our commercial rolatlons with
j tho Spanish Antilles, is disapproved of
, ', on two grounds, tho first of which would by
tlsolf havo boon doclslve. Wo refer to tho
proof (latent upon the face of Its oue-sldcd
provisions that our representative had boon
overreached by tho Castlllun diplomatists,
and that wo wore asked to cut oil Important
aud porlups essential sources of public
rovcmio In lotuin tor Insignificant and
illusory advantages. Horo ttrcfS Is nat
urally laid upon this consideration
than on tho obstruction offered by
commercial compacts llko that proposed
with Spain to tariff legislation, becouso tho
assent refused in this Instance Is accorded by
Mr. IUYAitu to tho Inchoato treaty with
Mexico. To this convention, also, tho excep
tion might bo raised that it operates to re
strict tho rcgulatlvo powor of Congress ovor
customs duties, but tho drawback is here
more than offset by tho faofc that under tho
agreement mado with Moxlco wo havo noth
ing to loso and probably a good deal to gain.
Tho measures taken by tho present Stato
Department to redress tho wrongs Inflicted
on American citizens in Ecuador aud Haytl
are worthy ot tho examples of vigilancoand
resolution set by former Democratic Admin
istrations. From tho tenor ot tho loforenco
to Germany's harsh treatment of our natu
ralized citizens who may choose to so
journ for a season hi tho laud of their
blrtb, wo Infer that this Administration
means to exhibit to tho great powers
of Europe, no less than to its foublo neigh
bors, nn unflinching purposo to fulfil ita fun
damental duties. Although no similar in
fringement ot tho immunities exigible by
every adoptod son ot tho American ropubllo
baa of lato boon attempted by Great Britain,
wo should havo been glad to soo a peremp
tory affirmance of a determination to protect
our hlsh-Amcrlcan fellow citizens from un
lawful molestation on British soli. But wo
have nofoar that Mr. Bayard, wlion the oc
casion calls for action, will forgot the Im
measurable, obligations of this nation or the
wolghty Indebtedness of tho Domocratlo par
ty to tho invigorating Inflow of Irish blood.
It must bo owned, nevertheless, that tbo
proposition put forth In Mr. Cikvblakd'u
messago to avert by rigid restrlotlvo legisla
tion tho alleged abuses of tho privileges of
citizenship will not strike all readors as well
counselled or well timed. It scarcely seems
to bo the moment for emphasizing tho neces
sity of precautions which, however dotonsl
blo In a few instances, could hardly fall In
their broad and ultimato effect to materially
abridgo tho benefits ot asylum and tho In
ducements to emigration. Ot course a Dem
ocratic Administration would not counte
nance anything that oven In tho popular im
agination could bo associated with tho Allen
law of most unfragrant moraory. But,
really, naturalization laws which, though
capacious and elastic, havo boon hold buOI
clently discriminative during the last quar
ter of a century, might bo endured for four
years longer. Democrats need not bo ovor
zcalous to put up bars which tho Republi
cans deemed it moro prudent to leavo down.
A Fortunate Millionaire.
Our esteemed contemporary, tho Tribune,
publishes some interesting tacts about tho
porsonal tastes and habits of Mr. Robert
GAiutGXT. tho dashing young Baltlmoro mil
lionaire, who has determined to give this
town a now trunk line and his rival railroad
nabobs a very lively time. Mr. GAitnirrT Ib a
fortunate man, and tho massof mankind, who
aro by no moans so envious of good luck
as some cynics represent, will bo Interested
to know that he stoma to bo a very good
follow. Ho goes to his office overy day at 10
in the morning, although ho could
afford, to sleep till noon, being re
puted to bo "worth from six to
ten millions of dollars," a sum which makes
a man rich in Baltlmoro, and is a modest
compotonce even In New York. He Is woll
looking, "plump, but not corpulent," and
has In him the making of a good man, his
present weight being 180 pounds. He likes
to walk, and is much given to hearty laugh
ing, a tact which speaks libraries In his
favor. He is fond ot society, is an accom
plished dancor, and " has a groat admiration
for young and pretty girls.'' He enjoys the
theatre, hoalro. naaawuos, mi eTol oatlng-,
and his farorlto drink Is champagne, so that
he Is .not only happy now. but will avoid tho
gout later on. He baa a splondld country
bouse, a cottage at Nowport, and a paloco la
Baltimore. Ho is a liberal glvor to charities,
goes to the charity balls, and when he drlvos
has an Indian-rod colored coachman, who is
tall, athletic, and Impressive
All theso details are interesting as show
ing tho varied accomplishments and enjoy
ments of a millionaire who spends as well as
accumulates, aud gets out of life all ho can
find in It. But to our mlud tho detail which
gives tho largest Idea ot tho power of wealth
in wise hands is this :
"PreM ! Ub Mr, Oilmen a consideration of the

Mr. OAaaaii'a tailor haa hla shop in New York. This
personage keeps tha railroad President constantly In

as he rinds auythtng that pleases his fancy, ha wires hla

York to make him a suit of that sample. When he
reaches New York the suit Is made aud walling for htm
at his hotel So fastidious and dainty is h'o in euch
matlera that ho frequently strlnga hla telegram out in

essarlly precise directions. These telegrams deal not
only lth tha broad generalities of the fit of tha coat,

"Mr, Oilman's collection of hati. canes, and umbrel

mense number of hats distributed through the halls, and
have fallen Intu the natural error of supposing that he
Is entertaining a vast delegation of his friends at dinner.
Tlielr surprise is profound when tbeyiflud that there is
no ono about the premises but tho host."
It is In his capacity as an arbiter ot tho
elegances of tho toilet, a connoisseur who
docs not shrink bcfoio his tailor, that Mr.
GAitunrr's good fortunoBeems most conspic
uous and admirable. Oue does not need to bo a
mlllloualro to bo well looking or to danco
well. A mllllonalro can afford to danco bad
ly, or not to danco at all, and It Is piling tho
gifts of tho gods pretty high to make hint
rich and handsomo too. An agrccablo man
with no bauk account may bo asked to tho
bost houses, and got his share of good chcor.
Thcro aro llbrarlos which a poor man may

what poor roan or what rich man either, Sir,

Baltlmoro Foutunatus docs not cower in
tho presence of that solf-controllcd and un

ho doos not want and weakly put up with
coats that do not fit, with waistcoats oroctive
about tho nock, and trousers baggy and

This Is why we call Mr, G.uwKrr a fortu

preeminent among tho sons of moo, that ho

The Power or the Boycott.
Tho cigar manufacturers, Messrs. SmArrott
A STonir, reopened tlielr factory on Monday
after a lockout of about a month, and thoro
foro their great forco of operatives aro now
ablo once moro to earn their living.
Tho romarkablo thing about this caso is
that tho factory was not olosod beoauso of
tho dulnoss of trade or dissatisfaction among
the workmen. "We bad employment all
along fox our pooplo," says Mr. Storm. " Out
of two thousand pooplo employed by tho
firm," writes tho man who was mainly ro
spormlblo for tho lockout, "not three persons
could find fault with tho troatmont of their
oroployors."
Tho factory stopped work bocauso the
labor organization to which tho operatives
belonged had boycotted tho goods of tho
firm In the Now England Status, aud thus
soriously interfered with its business.
Messrs. Stbaiton A SionM, as a measure
ot self-dofenco, deolded to lock out tlielr
workmen until tho boycott ngainut the
common Intorosts ot oiuployora and em
ployed was removod; and at last It Is re
moved through tho exertions of tho locked
out operatives, who have lost in wages bo
causo of it about forty thousand dollars.
Tho managers of the labor union find nftor
Investigation that the boycott of tho tobacco
manufacturers was all a mistake that it
"was put on their goods without any causo;"
and now the mistake Is to be corrected, after
it has caused a loss to tho workmon of forty
thousand dollars and to their employers of
very much more, perhaps. But boyootts
whero tho union has made no mistakes as to
the facts which havo Induced them aro going
on all tho tlmo.
Tho product of a lagor beer br.owory is
boycotted until tho proprietors yield to tho
terms Imposed on them by discontented em
ployees. A theatro Is boycotted until tho
managor agrees to employ only musicians
belonging to a rogular organization ot
musicians, and, besides, to pay $400 for the
expenses of boycotting him. Tho boycott on
two other thcatros has just been raised by
orders from tho labor union bocau60 the
manager has been starvod into making tho
concessions dornanded by hla musicians.
All business was lately kept at a standstill
in Galveston bocauso a steamship com
pany was boycotted. Two Postmistresses,
ono In Massachusetts and ono in Pennsyl
vania, arq now boycotted becausn of objec
tions to tbolr appointment. Thoso are only
a few among many cases, but they serve to
mdlcafco tho troRMUuloua evad revolutionary
powor of tho now force which organized
labor hae begun to wield, and whoso uso it
learned from dissatisfied tenants in Ireland.
In thoanclent Athenian republloCi.i.'iTHENE.H
dovlscd ostracism as a method of getting out
of tho way any public man whom tho peoplo
feared or distrusted. If six thousand of tho
citizens voted for tho ostracism of a man,
ho was compelled to withdraw from the city
within ton days, and romaln In banibhineut
at first for ten yctue, and aftorward for five
years. Even AitlSTJDKS, TliMliaTOCLKS, and
Cimou were thus quietly sent Into exile. But
llio modern boycott, originally devised solely
to punish employers and capitalists by lu
juilng ordostroyiug tliolr chances of making
mouoy, seems liki-ly to becomo a political
foico oven more effective than oslmcUni was
In the old Athenian republic.
A tow weeks ago, fur Instancy a Connecti
cut correspondent described In The Sun tho
working of the boycott In that Stato, and how
the Knights of Labor havo acquired tho bal
anco of political power by boycotting politi
cally candidates who aro objcctlouablo to
them. " Thcro is no quostlon," ho said, " that
the rlso of this new spirit ot menace on tho
part of labor Is deeply agitating thoso at tho
head of tho Ansoula manufacturing Inter
ests," and "thcro Is no doubt that Connecticut
politicians aro feeling very unoasy over tho
showing that tho Knights ot Labor mado at
tho last election; and all business men In
manufacturing towns know well tho penalty
of breaking fuilti with tho Knights."
Wo see, thoroforo, that thero aro torriblo
possibilities in tho boycott.
ijis Speech Hewrnyoth Him.
Tho Hon. LEVKitrrrr Saltosstalij, Collec
tor of thoPoit of Boston, seoms to bo dls
tuibcd by tho dissatisfaction shown by tho
Massachusetts Democracy at hU appoint
ment. Ho Insists that ho has long boon a
Democrat, and Is ovldontly surprised that
any Massachusetts Democrat should not bo
pleasod with him. " For a quarter of a cen
tury," ho told the solid men of tho Cereal
Club tho other night, "I havo arousod and
endured tho bittor onmity of tho Hopubllcan
party bocout.0 1 was a Domocral; and now I
discover 1 am not a Democrat."
Mr. SAi.TONsrAi.in surprlso Is natural.
Ho was a Democrat for many years, years of
dlbcouragemont and disaster to tho Demo
cratic patty In Massachusetts. Ho stood up
courageously for Domooratlo principles
whon they wero most unpopular, and when
Bay Stato Ilopubllcanlsm was most pros
perous and intolerant. Thero Is no moro
doubt about Mr, Saltonktall's courago aud
sincerity than thero Is nbout his good looks
or his good breodlng; yet this must bo
cald, that, with a fow othor amlablo and cul
tivated gcntlomon, ho could not put up with
tho ono man who had tbo forco and popu
larity to lead tho Massachusetts Domocrats
to victory. Thon he bocamo for a tlmo an
associate ot Mugwumps and Republicans;
and It Is no wonder to othor pooplo, although
It Is to him, that his sympathy with tho
sympathies of tho groat body of Massachu
setts Domocrats has boon doubted.
In tho vory speech In which he defends tho
gonulncnoss of his Domocrnoy ho gives addi
tional evldonco ot his Inability to undei stand
what tho Massachusetts Democrats bellovo
In and deslro. Ho tells tho Cereal Club that
very cltlzon who loves his country should
support tho modern schorao of compotltlvo
examinations and non-partisan appoint
ments, nn that any party which dares to
opooso that sort of thing will bo lobt, And
he goes on to show how to boost this nation
up tho path of civilization:
"Other iMoee the currency or the tatIB mar afleat
theprospeilty ot the nation tor a time, but by standing
by thla law we may do more tor the ulttmateatandard at
the nation among tha peopkeof tha world than In aay
other and In all other waye combined."
This wondrous prophecy lias caused much
thankful uplifting ot tho heart and volco
among tho Mugwumps. Thus our esteemed
contnmporary, tho Brooklyn Union, nvors
that "tho most Interesting quostlon In
Massachusetts politics Is, Ot what party
nro most of tho mon who keep Mr, Saltov
htali, company lu his advanced position ?"
Well, most ot tho men who koop hint com
pany in his advanced oollion uru of. no pat ty.
They are Mugwumps. The Doinocrutsof
Massachusetts don't keep hint company, and
the greater hla ardor for the Mugwump
Bohorue, the furtbor from them will he get.
It Is n quoer way of guaranteeing that he
Is a sound Democrat to show that ho Is as
mad as tho muddvbt Ealonlau on the subject
of bringing about the millennium by means
of oompotltivo examinations and non-partl-ean
politics. A Democrat should not talk
the straight Mugwumpeso Lingo. Mr.
Salto.vstalIi's speech bewrayeth him. He
Is moro of a Mugwump than a Dotnocrat.
A Curious Attack on tho President.
Our esteemed Mugwump contemporary,
thereto l'orfc Time, published on Tuesday
tho following remarkable story In tho form
of a letter from Pulaski, Giles county, Touu. :
"The leet isaue ot the rultuKI WU cm-, which
reached this city to-day, contalna an account C the
flndlbgof the cranio la which President Clevblird waa
rooked when a baby. Tha account aaye that when ha
waa an infant hla father lived near Batavta, O.. aud
when he removed to New York hla cradle, manufactured
by tha CLaraiAKn broihera, was loft baklud and
fell Into the handa ot a sutler, who after
ward want to PulaakL During tha lata war
hta place was aacked by MriaaAN'a cavalry and ha had to
Ilea for his life. Okiik Jictso.i, a colored man, who
hauled hint to Lawrenca, now remeuibere that aoradla
waa thrown Into a creek, A few daya ago, whUa two
cltlaeiiaof I'ulasklwera Helling there, they discovered
an odd looking object In the stream, drew It out, and
discovered It waa a cradle. It was thrown into tha
wagon fur a aeat, and a it feU the end board split and
a piece of paper droppad out. Tba end bad bean inada
ot two plecee ot board. hoUowed and gluod together.
On tha paper waa written: Mad bIJ. and S. Clbvb
usd. Batavla, O.' Enough of the paper was deciphered
to show that It waa made for Sriruiif Obovbr. son ot
Ukob. The President waa notified by Mr. Richibdboh,
who made tba dlseoverjr, and received thla reply :
" Wuita Uousb, Nov. 20, 1B83.
"Mr. J. A. KUhariiort.
"Sib: Yourawasduly received, but waa unanswered
until 1 could inquire into the fct, X am fully persuaded
that the cradle la genuine. I have otteu heard ray
mother speak ot It, and slnoe tha war trted to get it, but
learned that a German peddler had got It. ! shall ba
glad to receive a photograph, aud If you will part with
the cradle iteclt I will be gliul to accept any moneyed
terms j ou deairc, Youra truly,
" Oaovaa Clbtbmbd."
Whtlo this talo Is artfully dovlsod, and
thoro la much that is Interesting and eveu
affecting In its suggestions, Its romantic fea
tures cxclto suspicion, aud wo caused an In
quiry to bo mado upon tho subject at tho
Exccullvo Mansion Iu Washington. This
wa9 tho answor: "Tho wholo story about
tho cradle Is an invention. No such letter, or
nny other on that subject, has over been
written by Mr. Cleveland."
While tho real purpose of this concoction Is
evident and that purposo Is to throw rldl
culo upon Air. Cleveland we do not say
that the Times was a party to that intention.
Wo presume that it received the communica
tion as a matter of news and publlscd It inno
cently. At least, wo hope that such is tho
caso; although when we consider the tre
mendous Mugwump propensities of tho
Times, its scarcely concealed dissatisfaction
with Mr. Cleveland becauso ho is not

Mr. Joso'ii Thomson, the African traveller,
bus just mado a trip from London to tbo king
dom of Sokoto, far up tho Niger lilvor, and
buck, iu sovon months. Tho means of trans
portation in tha Niger basin hare evidently
lnmroed since Bartii, IIiiade, tho Landehb,
and others spent years Instead of months in
those regions. Mr. Thomson went out on bo
bait of tho African Trading Company, and ho
mado treaties with tbo Sultans of Bokoto
and Gamlo which givo tho company trading
privileges for many hundreds of miles
along tba Xluor and its largost branch, the

equaliis salaries, so that teachere occupying the same
grade In the various schools shall rscelva the same

ment waa far from being perfect. It took power out ot
the bauds ot the Trustees and lodged It In the hands ot I
the Board, reduced the salaries nf old teachere und lu- j
creased the salaries of thuss who were fre.h frum tbe
academies.
Commissioner Crary said the Board of Rdncatlon had
power to vqualbvi salaries, and ehould have done II be
fore. Kvery teacher, lie eald, should shiir equally 111
