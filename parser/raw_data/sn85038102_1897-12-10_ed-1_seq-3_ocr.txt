Washington, Dec. 6. President Mc
Kinley today sent his annual message
to congress. He congratulates It upon
assembling under felicitous conditions.
Peace anu good will with all nations of
tne eaiia continue unbroken, he says,
and'vve should feel genuine satisfaction
at the growing spirit of fraternal re
gard and unification in all sections of our
country and the lifting of great public
questions above party prejudice.
Beginning with the subject of the fln
anances, the president says that wh.ls
the full effect of the legislat.cn . I ...c.-
tra session has not been reani. .u
It has already accomplished u. ..s s
of its timeliness and wisdom, ..6t
its permanent value further time v. i.i be
required, and the people, Eat.sfied With
its operation and results thus lar, are
in no mind to withhold from it a fair
trial.
The next question pressing for consid
eration is that of the currenc y. With the
great resources of the government and
with the honorable example of the past
before us, we would not hesitate to en
ter upon a currency revision which will
make our demand obligations less oner
ous to the government and relieve cur
financial laws from ambiguity and
doubt. The evil of the present system
is found in the great cost to the govern
ment of maintaining at parity with gold
our different forms of money, and the
experiences the past four years have
demonstrated that this is net only an
expensive charge upon the government
but a dangerous menace to our national
credit. It is manifest that we must de
Vise some plan to protect the government
against bond issues for repeated re
demption. We have nine hundied mill
ions of currency which the government,
by solemn enactment, has undertaken
to keep at par, and nobody Is obliged
to redeem In gold but the government,
which must borrow the gold. The law
which requires the payment out of the
treasury of redeemed United States notes
demands a constant replenishment of
the gold reserve, especially in times of
panic and insufficient revenue, and dur
ing the preceding administration $262,
815,400 4 per cent bonds were issued
and sold to sustain the gold reserve and
pay the expenses of the government in
excess of revenue. While it is true that
a greater part of this was used to supply
deficient revenues, a considerable por
tion was required to maintain the gold
reserve. If no further legislation is to
be had to correct this and the policy of
selling bonds is to be continued, then
congress should give the secretary of
the treasury authority to sell bonds at
long or short periods bearing a less rate
of interest than is now authorized by
law. The president says:
"I earnestly recommend as booh as
the receipts of the government are quite,
sufficient to pay all the expenses of the
government that when any United States
notes are presented for redemption in
gold and are redeemed in gcd, such
notes shall be kept and set apart and
only paid out in exchange for gold. Tn.s
is an obvious duty. If the holder of
the United States note prefers the gold
and gets it from the government, he
should not receive from the government
a United States note without paying
gold in exchange for It."
Turning to loreign aftairs.the president
devotes much space in his message to a
considerat.on of the Cuban question,
which, he . ays, is the most important
problem with which oiur government
is now called upon to deal in its foreign
relations. Summarizing the histoiy of
former outbreaks, the president comes
down to the piesent insurrect.on, speak
ing of its remarkable increase, its tena
cious existence against enormous forces
massed by Spain, the widespread de
struction of property and tne u.Mtgard
of the civilized code of war on both sid-es.
He says this condition gives li&e to the
gravest apprehension. There is no de
sire on our part to profit by Spain's mis
fortunes, and we have only the desire to
see the Cubans enjoying that measure of
self control which is the inalienable
right of all.
Of the concentration policy of Weyler,
he says: "It has utterly failed as a war
measure. It is not civiliztd wai fare, it
Is extermination." Against tn.s abuse
of the rights of war, the presiuent says
he has felt constrained on repeated oc
casions to enter thw firm and earnest pro
test of this government. He outlines
his instructions to Minister Woodford,
which were in substance to impress upon
the Spanish government the sincere wish
of the United States to lend its aid toward
the ending of the war by reaching a
peaceful and lasting result just and hon
orable to Spain and the Cuban people.
It was also asked whether Spain of her
own volition should not make proposals
for settlement, and it was said that he
could not con template an indefinite period
for the accomplishment of this result.
The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford was,
In the president's opinion, In the direction
of a better understanding. It admitted
our friendly purposes and deep interest,
and declared that the new government
was bound to a change of policy that
should satisfy the United States and
pacify Cuba within a reasonable time.
To this end political reforms will be
put into effect and military operations
conducted on humane lines.
Taking up the question of belligerency,
the president quotes at length from Pres
ident Grant's message of Dec. 7, 1875,
wherein he declared that the conditions
in Cuba warranted neither the recogni
tion of Independence nor the recognition
of belligerency. He adds that, more
over, a recognition of belligerency would
confer upon neither party to the conflict
a sfStus not heretofore not actually pos
sessed, whle It would weigh heavily In
Spain's behalf, giving her right of search
on the high seas and extending her mari
time rights to the margin of our terri
torial waters. "For these reasons," says
the president. "I regard the recognition
of the belligerency of the Cuban insurg
ents as now unwise and therefore Inad
missible." He says the near future will demon
strata whether a righteous peace Is likely
to be attained; if not. the exigency of
further and other action by the United
States will remain to be taken. Sure of
the right, the government will continue
its watchful care over American citizens
and its efforts to bring about honorable
peace, and, says the president, "If it
shall hereafter appear to be a duty im
posed by our obligations to ourselves to
civilization and humanity to intervene
with force, it shall be without fault on
our part, and only because the necessity
for such action will be so clear as to
command the' support and approval ol
the civilized world."
The president next takes up the sub
ject of the annexation of Hawaii, which,
he says, should be accomplished. Rap
idly reviewing his former arguments in
favor of annexation, he says that legis
lation is required In the event of the rat
ification of the treaty; and, while abrupt
assimilations of immature elements of
population should be avo'ded, Just pro
vision should be made for self-rule In
local matters with the largest political
liberty to the Hawalians.
International arbitration Is declared
by the president to represent the best
sentiment of the civilized world, and
treaties embodying these humane prin
ciples on broad lines without in any way
imperilling our Interests or honor will
have his constant encouragement.
Attention is also called to the need for
prompt legislation as to Alaska and to
the extension of civil authority within
the territory. There is need for surveys
and for the establlsahment of another
land office at some point in the Yukon
valley, fcr which an appropriation Is
asked. Military force is also necessary
and the establishment of some sort of
flexible government, If the startling
reports as to the probable shortage of
food for the miners be fully verified
every effort should be made at any cost
to carry them relief.
The Nicarague canal is spoken of as of
large importance to our country and the
promise is made of a further reference
tto the subject when the report of the
commission now at work is sent to con
gress. The president says of the International
monetary commission that, notwith
standing diligent effort, the envoys have
failed so far to secure an agreement.
Gratification is expressed at the action
of France in this matter In joining In our '
efforts, and it is said that the negotia
tions are still pending. Meanwhle, the
envoys have not made their final report,
believing that the doubts raised in cer- !
tain quarters respecting the feasibility
of maintaining parity between gold and
sliver may yet be solved. The president
earnestly hopes that their labors may ;
bring about an International agreement. 1
The president devotes the last chapter .
of his mesage to the civil service, the 1
practical improvement of which, he says,
has long been a subject of earnest dis
cussion, and which has of late years '
received increased legislative and exec
utive approval. During the past few
months the service has been placed upon
a still firmer basis of business methods
and personal merit. While the right of
deserving veteran soldiers to reinstate- !
ment has been asserted, dismissals for
merely political reasons have been care
fully guarded against;" the examina
tions improved and made practical, and
a distinct advance has been made by giv
ing a hearing before dismissal upon all
cases where incompetency Is charged or
demand made for the removal of officials.

Boston, Dec. 8. Seventeen of the 32
cities of the commonwealth held their
municipal elections yesterday. In a
majority of the cases the Republicans
were successful In electing their mayor
and securing control of the city govern
ment, although the results show that the
Idea of Independent or non-partisan con
trol of municipal affairs is steadily
growing in favor.
In Havarhill the success of Daniel
F. Chare, the non-partisan Democrat
and Socialist candidate, is said to sig
nify that partisan nominations are at
an end in that city.
In Marlboro the city elected a Dem
ocratic mayor for the first time in its
history, a result attributed to the great
personal popularity of the candidate.
Newton voted under a new s rgle
charter with cnly one mayoralty candi
date. The closest fought elections were those
In Lawrence, Maiden, SpringnVd,
Somerville and Waltham, all on purely
local Issues, in the first named the Dem
ocratic candidate having declared his
intentiOTi, If elected, to shake up the
office holders of that city.
Seven of the mayors chosen won upon
other than straight party nominations,
although nearly all had party endorse
ment. Six maycrs were re-elected.
On the license ccrtest the contest, as
usual, was closely fought, but the ad
vocates of no-license last much ground
and strength.

Waverly, N. T., Dec. 7. C. T. Hull, for
many years cashier of the First National
bank of Athens, N. Y., was arrested yes
terday, charged with embezzlement and
making false entries In the books of the
bank. He pleaded not guilty and gave
bail in $2000 for his appearance Dec. 28
for examination.
Hull left the bank's employ about two
years ago, and a couple of months ago
the bank went into voluntary liquidation.
A United States examiner went through
the books, and, It Is alleged, found a
shortage of $1373. Hull was prominent
in Grand Army and musical circles, and
Is widely known.

MES. LYNESS ESCAPES
The Hospital and a Fearful
Hospitals in greatcities are sad places to visit. Three
fourths of the patients lying on those snow-white beds
are women and girls.
Why should this be the case ?
Because they have neglected themselves! Women
as a rule attach too little importance to first symp
toms of a certain kind. If they have toothache,
they will try to save the tooth, though many leave
even this too late. They comfort themselves with
the thought that they can replace their teeth ; but
they cannot replace their internal organs 1
Every one of those patients in the hospital beds
had plenty of warnings in the form of bearing-down
feelings, pain at the right or the left of the womb,
nervous dyspepsia, pain in the small of the back the
" blues," or some other unnatural symptom, but they dii
not heed them.
Don't drag along at home or in the shop until you are finally obliged to
go to the hospital and submit to horrible examinations and . operations t
Build up the female organs. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will
bave you from the hospital. It will put new life into you.
The following- letter shows how Mrs. Lyness escaped the hospital and a

GAIS KXPLODKD,
Bnilclli'g; of Exeter Gaslight Cnmpmty
Was Quite llnillr tilmtiered.
Exeter, N. H., Dec. 7. The brick
building of Exeter Gaslight company
was quite badly shattered this morning
by an explosion from some cause un
known. The large meter connected with the
works is taken every night and mortUna
by some employe to ascertain the
amount of gas consumed. ;-
Just before 6 o'clock Albert Dewhirst
Started with his lantern for the front of
the building. As he entered the door
leading to the meter room, there was a
terrific explosion. He was thrown about
15 feet into the street. He was not se
riously hurt, however. A second explo
sion quickly followed the first one.
Frank Crummett, another employe,
who lives near at hand, heard the re
ports, and ran as quickly as possible to
the works, where he found the building
on fire. He attached a length of hose to
a hydrant and put out the flames with
out ringing in an alarm.
The damage to the building will be
probably $1000. The windows were shat
tered, the floors smashed Into splinters
and the bricks In the walls thrown from
ttieir places.
The accident was probably due to a
leak somewhere In the pipes. It will not
interfere with the supply of gas, as the
machinery is not damaged.

Bradford, Vt., Dec. 8. A circular is
sued by the Uradtord Savings Bank and
Trust company, saying that it had limit
ed withdrawals to 10 per cent a month,
has caused a good deal of misunder
standing among the depositors. The
facts are that owing to litigation of the
bank against Kobert F. Strafe of Bos
ton and a story that a run on the bank
migt come, the trustees, as a precau
tionary measure, voted to "pay not more
than 10 per cent on ajiy interest bearing
depo-Flt." Tliia resolution was adopted
at the suggestion of the state Inspector
of finance, and only applies to interest
bearing deposits, not affecting at all ac
counts subject to check or the general
business of the bank.

where he was found to have a fractured
skull. He never regained conscious
