The IUukt Don't Like the Way Some of
the Confederate Offlceri Fondle
Around Federal Officials and
Trigger for Favors.
Continued from last week Article 11.
Sept. 8, 1862. Our guards are as
mute as mice. Cheered for Federal
soldiers, we hurrah for Jeff Davis
and Stonewall Jackson. We arrive
at Maltoon, a railroad junction
(marked on the old maps Paradise),
at 3 a.m. Saw a negro girl peeping
out of a little cabin as though she
were afraid of being kidnapped.
At Indianapolis some little negroes
ventured up to look at us. A Reb
jumped out of the cars and started
after them, making them ecamper
off in a hurry. Our Missourian for
whom we made up the money is
seen here sitting off among the
crowd of lookers on.
At 7 a.m., we arrived at Effing
ham. The Rebels scattered all over
the town and the guard was runuing
around after them, but one com
pany can't guard a train of thirty
cars of Rebs who have learned that
the train will not start when many
of them are off. Here an old Dutch
woman refused to sell Confederates
anything. The Dutch are hard
against us; the Irish for us. At 9:30
we stopped for a train to pass. A
little boy here said that there was
lots of secesh in this country. A
citizen told Lieut. Love that he
would rather fight for the devil than
for Old Abe. At Indianapolis I trot
a paper. The holder was afraid to
let me have it until he asked the
advice of a bystander. We have
not found any one along the road
who has had time to read the news.
They don't know what it is, but iwe
fine it to ba glorious. Lexington,
Bowling Green,' Frankfort and
Cynthiana are evacuated by Fed
erals and they fall back on Louis
ville and Covington. Cincinnati in
an uproar, the whole of the citizens
called out and martial law declared
by Lew .Wallace, the commander.
Kentucky 'legislature sitting at
Louisville. Confederates pushing
on after Federals and routing them,
horse, foot and dragoons. Our bravo
boys driving them at every point in
Virginia. Gen. Jackson reported
wounded; Gen. Ewell killed.
Northern papers setting up a howl
for more troops, stating that the
barbarous rebels are at their very
doors and that all will be lost if
they don't meet them cn masse im
mediately.
At one o'clock we arrived at Cen
tralia. We have a good manv sym
pathizers through this part of Illi
nois. The Federal mistake us for
federals and cheer us. Some new
recruits at this place told us "to
give them hell, boys," but they soon
found that we were Rebels by the
hurrahs for Stouewall Jackson and
Jeff Davis.
Ninety-six miles from Cairo we
came to a considerable town. In
the southeast part of the town some
young ladies came out on the por
tico. A little trirl had a nag. winch
all the boys took to be a Confederate
llag. One of the young ladies got so
excited that she jerked it away from
the little Kin and commenced wav
ing it amid the cheers of a thousand
liebel oincers and wavinar or nana
kerchiefs. Some took two red and
one white handkerchiefs and made
extemporaneous Confederate flags
and waved them from the top of the
cars, which were covered with Con
federate officers. Farther back ;
saw a young lady cheering us with
a white hanaKercniei. Anotner,
standing by, ierked it away from
her, but she continued to wave ner
hands. At the same town a vixen
stood in the door and kept popping
her fists at us. The more we hol
lered the madder she got. We
glided by, leaving her "champing
the bits." Several ladles on the
road told us to stand up and fight
like men.
In the evenine we arrived at
Duquoin, eighty miles from Cairo,
and waited lor an up train to pass
Here we saw fthe man mentioned
here was a few years ago, and possi
bly is vet. a citizen or the southern
end of Maury County. During the
Eumme1' season of revivals he was
quite a conspicuous figure at any
church within a radius of ten miles
of his home where a revival was in
progress. Nor did he figure less
conspicuously, whether invited or
not, on such occasions, at the homes
of those brethren whose wives were
noted for setting a good table. He
looked very sheepish and went and
brought his wife down. She is very
bitter against the South. X had
but little to say. We learned from
a citizen that he was doing nothing
for livelihood. It is evident to my
mind that he is playing off on the
loyal Illinoisans as a persecuted
Union man who has had to flee for
his life and leave all his property; a
thing which many other scamps
have done, creating a false , impres
sion on Northern men in respect to
Southern men. . '
Passed Big Muddy tiver bridge
about sixty miles from Cairo. Sev
eral companies were stationed here.
evidently guarding the bridge.
After dark the engine stalled and
had to take part of the traln.over at
a time. Reached Cairo at 10:30 all
cramped up and fatigued to death,
havlug had no opportunity to sleep
for two nights. We were crammed
on the Universe, an old crazy boat.
We covered it from top to bottom
and then could scarcely get room to
lie down. I slept on top of the boat.
Our baggage was sent ahead and we
do not know where it is. We have
heard that our trunks were burst
open at Sandusky after the officers
told us that we need not send our
keys, as they did not intend to ex
amine the baggage. If that be so
we are satisfied that everything of
value is stolen.
8ept. 4. Waked by the cold this
morning, though the day is oppres
sively warm. Every part of the
boat is so crowded that you can
scarcely turn around. The river
water that we drink is as warm as
dish water. We can scarcely get
anything to eat. The rations of a
great many gave out yesterday.
Some few eatables for sale are
brought over in skiffs. Passes are
difficult to get and the citizens are
so afraid that they will be arrestud
that we can't begin to have our
wants supplied. A great many
have no money. Camp Douglas
prisoners have been arriving here
day and uight since we have been
here. As soon as we got aboard our
boat it was anchored out in the mid
dle of the Ohio. The river is full of
Rebels with two gunboats watching.
An ironclad steamed np the river
to-day, probably for Cincinnati, as
the Yanks there are frightened out
of their hides. Dr. Southern, of Co
lumbia, came over from Cairo to see
his acquaintances aboard. He met
with cold comfort.
Tutle, the commander of this post,
(he also commanded a regiment at
Ft. Donelson) brought over some
rations late this evening, gun-wadding
bread, raw met, coffee and
soap. There is no chance in the
world for so many to cook, and i
have been afraid the old boat would
be set on fire, so many crowding
and rushing around the fire to cook
something.
Here we came up wttn our
Colonels and Major who had been
paroled somf tinie before we started,
to report at Vicksburg. They could
get no farther than Cairo. The
juards have been trying to nave tne
fires on the boat put out, but the
Rrtbs won't let them. Old Follett, a
tyrannical old scamp, has lost his
power over us and has fallen back
to Cairo, leaving us and nis com
pany to do the best we can. At San
dusky he spoke out very gruffly to
his lieutenants to "drive 'em In,
drive 'em in," as though we were a
lot of hogs.
JSiL'ht hundred negroes, stolen Dy
the Federals, arrived here yester
day from "away down South."
Learned here that Dr. Dickson had
been arrested and sent to Johnson
Island. Some of the Rebels were
taken off this boat about dark, but
we seem very much crowded yet.
Sept. 5. After being tramped over
a good part of the night we stirred
out early to try to get a chance to
make some coilee. xnis pnee is
worrying us greatly. The weather
is oppressively warm and if we have
to remain at this place long we will
all be sick with cholera or some oth
er pestilence. The boats the pri
vates are on are so crowded that a
groat many have to stay out on top
and take the rain. At dark we were
put aboard the boat on which the
Johnson Island prisoners were
placed last night. This gave those
who came aboard first a chance to
sret the best Darts of the boat. Some
eight tbousaud prisoners are lying
off Cairo in nifflit of Mound City.
sweltering and almost suffocating
with hfiHt D-nnhoats Delow and
above us. With ropes and blankets
we stretch out covers to protect us
from the sun. When it rains we
cannot guard so well against it
Sept. (!. Slept last night on top
the boat on my shawl with nothing
to cover with men so thick that
one can't get about without step
ping on them. On the boat to-day I
saw an intelligent contraband,
owned by Butler, of Cahoma county,
Miss. lie was very sick of Yankee-
dom and wanted to iro DacK. uapt
Blake's daughter come over this
mornlne: in a skiff to see him.
There are 1,200 men on this boat,
the Choutan. Capt. McWhirter,
Cols. Battle, Wood, Quarles and
others are paroled to Cairo aud pick
out a hundred officers and select
crowd eolntr down on parole $15 for
the passage. There is a good deal
of hard feeling against them among
the officers for the way they have
triggered around and fondled around
old follett aud other federal om
cers.
Our trunks and baggage came
aboard yesterday, all pillaged and
mutilated. The civilized world
never before witnessed such thiev
inir and low-down rascality by otti
cers or any government. JNeany
every officer in prison asked if he
must send the key to his trunk and
was repeatedly told that it was not
necessary; that the trunks had been
examined twice and everything con
traband kept out and that they did
not intend to examine them. In
Sandusky they broke open every
trunk, breaking off the hinges and
tops and smashing in the sides, un
tying our bundles and pillaging
everything. Many trunks were
robbed of their entire contents and
everything of value taken from our
baggage. The only thing of value
that I put with the baggage was a
pair of heavy blankets I brought
from Donelson, and the only blank
ets I had were stoleu. Capt. Follett
will get mauy a cursing before we
get to Vicksburg by all except a few
who are always truckling to tne
"blue-bellies" and begging for fa
vors. The most of us have too much
pride for such conduct.

President McKinley Sends His
Annual Message. '
The Recognition of Cuban Independ
ence Is Sow Out of All Questlou
No Belligerent Rights.
The Financial Problem Wants Hawaii
Annexed Congratulated Upon
Assembling Under Felici
tous Conditions."
Presidont McKinley last Monday
sent hi3 message to the first regular
session of the Fifty-fifth Congress.
The document is a lengthy one and
would occupy nearly two of the
Heralo'6 pages. The main points
of his address are as follows:
To the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives: It gives me pleasure to extend
greeting to the Fifty-fifth Congress,
assembled In regular session at the
seat of government, with many of
whose senators I have been associa
ted in the legislative service. Their
meeting occurs under felicitous con
ditions, justifying sincere congratu
lations and calling for our grate
ful acknowledgment to a beneficent
Providence, which has so signally
blessed and prospered us as a nation.
The Financial Question.
With the great resources of the
government and with the honorable
example of the past before us, we
ought not to hesitate upon a cur
rency revision which will make our
demand obligations less onerous to
the government and relieve our
financial laws from ambiguity and
doubt.
The evil of the present system is
found in the great cost to the gov
ernment of maintaining parity or
our different forms of mony, that
is, keeping all of them at par with
gold. We Burely cannot be longer
heedless of the burden this imposes
upon the people, even under fairly
prosperous conditions, while the
past four years have demonstrated
that it is not only an expensive
charge upon the government but a
dangerous menace to the national
credit. 1
If the holder of the United States
note prefers the gold and gets it
from the government, he should not
receive back from the government a
United States note without paying
gold in exchange for it.
I recommend that the issue or
national bank notes be restricted to
the denomination of $10 and up
wards. If the suggestions I have
herein made shall have the approval
of Congress, then 1 would recom
mend that national banks be re
quired to redeem their notes in gold
No Help for the ubns.
The most important problem with
which this government is now
called upon to deal pertaining to its
foreign relations concerns its duty
toward Spain and tne uuoan insur
rection. Problems and conditions
more or less in common with those
now existing have confronted this
eovernment at various times in the
past. The story of Cuba for many
years has been one of unrest, grow-
ine discontent, and an ellort toward
a larger enjoyment or liberty and
self control: or organized resistance
to the mother country ; of deep de
pression after distress and warfare
and of ineffectual settlement to be
followed by renewed revolt.
Ihe civilized code oi war has been
disregarded no less so by the Span
lards than by the Cubans. The ex
istiuir conditions cannot but fill this
government and the American peo
Ie with the gravest apprehension,
.'here is no desire on the part of our
people to profit by the misfortunes
of Spain.
Let the Cruel War Go On.
In the absence of a declaration of
the measures that the government
proposes to take in carrying out its
proffer of good offices, it suggests
that Spain be left free to conduct
militarv operations and arrant politi
cal reforms, while the United States
for its part shall enforce its neutral
obligations and cut off the assist
ance which it is asserted the insurg
ents receive from this country. The
supposition of an indefinate pro
longation of war is denied. It is
asserted that the western provinces
are already well nigh reclaimed;
that planting of cane and tobacco
therein has been resumed and that
by force of arms and new and ample
reforms very early and complete
pacification is hoped for.
Sure of the right, keeping free
from all offense ourselves, actuated
only by upright and patriotic con
siderations, moved neither by pas
sions nor selfishness, the govern
ment will continue its watchful care
over the rights and properties of
American citizens and will abate
none of its efforts to bring about by
peaceful agencies a peace which
shall be honorable and enduring
If it shall hereafter appear to be a
duty imposed by our obligations to
ourselves, to civilization and hu
manity to Intervene with force, it
shall be without fault on our part
and ouly because the necessity for
such action will be so clear as to
command the support and approva
of the civilized world.
He Wants Hawaii.
- By a special message dated, the
Ifitli day or June last, I laid b6fore
the Senate of the United States a
treaty signed that day by the pleni
potentiaries of the United States
and of the republic of Hawaii, hav
ing for Its purpose the incorporation
of the Hawaiian Islands as an
integral part of the United States,
and under its sovereignty. The
Senate having removed the injunc
tion of secrecy, although the treaty
is still pending before that body,
the subject may be properly referred
to in this message because the
necessary action of the congress is
required to determine by legislation
many details of the eventual union
hould the faot of annexation be
accomplished, as I believe It should
be.
If the treaty is confirmed, as every
consideration of dignity nnd honor
requires, the wisdom of congress
will see to it that, avoiding abrupt
assimilation of elements perhaps
yet fit to share in the highest fran
chises of citizenship and having due
regard to the geographical condi
tions, the most just provisions for
self rule in local matters with the
largest political liberties and an in
tegral part of cir nation will be ac
corded to the Hawailans. No ler.s
is due to a people who, after nearly
five years of demonstrated capacity
to fulfill the obligations of self
governing statehood, come' of their
free will to merge their destinies in
our body politic.
The Klmetallltt CoinmUxlon.
Under the provissions of the act
of Congress approved March 3, 1897,
for the promotion or an international
agreement respecting bimetallism,
I appointed on the fourteenth day
of April, 1897, Hon. Edward C. Wil
cott, of Colorado; Hon. Adlai E.
Stevenson, of Illinois, and Hon.
Charles J. Paine, of Massachusetts,
as special envoys to represent the
United States. They have been
diligent in their efforts to secure
the concurrence and co-operation of
European countries in tne inter
national settlement of the question,
but up to this time have not been
able to secure an agreement con
templated by their mission.
Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction
to state that the special envoys have
already demonstrated their ability
and fitness to deal with the subject
and it is to be earnestly hoped that
their labors may result in an inter
national agreement which will
bring about recognition of both gold
and silver money upon such terms
and with such safe guards as will
secure the use of both metals upon
a basis which shall work no in
justice to any class of our citizens.
' 1 International Arbitration.
International arbitration cannot
be omitted from the list of subjects
claiming our consideration. Events
have only served to strengthen' the
general views on this question ex
pressed in my inaugural address.
The best sentiment of the civilized
world is moving toward the settle
ment of differences between nations
without resorting to the horrors of
war. Treaties embodying these hu
mane principles on broad lines with
out in any way Imperiling our in
terests or our honor shall have my
constant encouragement.
Talk or Alaska.
The territory of Alaska requires
tne prompt attention or (Jon
gress. The conditions now existing
demand material changes in the
laws relating to the territory. The
great influx of population during
the past summer and fall, and the
prospect of a still larger iinmigra
tio'i in the spring, will not permit
us to longer neglect the extension
of civil authority within the ter
ritory or postpone the establishment
or a more thorough government.
Ihe startling, though possibly ex
aggerated reports from the Yokon
ltiver country of the probable short
age of food for the large number of
people who are wintering there
without tho means of leaving the
country, are confirmed in such
measure as to ju&tify bringing the
matter to the attention of congress.
Access to that country in winter
can be had only through the passes
from Dyea and vicinity, which is a
most difficult and perhaps an im
possible task. However, should
these reports of the suffering of our
fellow-citizens be further verified,
every effort at any cost should be
made to carry them relief.

A SHREWD ADVERTISER.
John Wanamaker Tells Why He Vies
Newspapers Only,
"I never in my life used such a
thing as a poster or a dodger or
handbill," said John Wanamaker.
"My plan for twenty years has been
to buy so much space in a newspa
per and fill it up as I wanted. I
would not give an advertisement in
a newspaper of 500 circulation for
5,000 dodgers or posters. If I wanted
to sell cheap jewelry or run a gamb
ling scheme I might use posters;
but I would not insult a decent read
ing public with handbills. The
class of people who read them are
too poor to look to support in mer
cantile affairs. I deal directly with
the publisher. I say to him :
"How long will you let me run a
column of matter tnroughy our paper
for $100 or $500?" as the case may be.
I let him do the figuring, and it I
think he is not trying to take more
than his share I give him the copy.
I lay aside the profits on a particu
lar line of goods for advertising pur
poses. "At first I laid aside $3,000. Last
year I laid aside and spent $40,000.
I have done better this year, and
shall increase the sum as the profits
warrant it. I owe my success to
newspapers, and to them I freely
giva a certain profit of my yearly
business." Wool and Cotton Re

of the Cumberland Presbyterian
Church, issued the following card
In Monday's American:
"The Orphans' Home Committee
of the General Assembly of the Cum
berland Presbyterian Church has
had several very interesting meet
ings. The Chairman is Rev. R. W.
Binkley, of Nashville; the Sec
retary, Rev. O. O. Bachman, of
Nashville, and W. T. Hnrdlson, of

Elder9 A. V. Goopasture,., Hamilton
Parks and T. O. Morris, are the re
maining members.
"After a thorough investigation of
the proceedings of the former com
mittees, it was unanimously decided
that the Orphans' Home of the
Cumberland Presbyterian Church Is
located by action of the first com
mittee at Columbia, Tenn. The
citizens of Columbia, together with .
the committee on the part of Rich
land Presbytery, having, signified
their desire to carry out the pro
position which they made to raise
$10,000 or more, in lands or money,
the committee has agreed that upon
the presentation by them of the
deeds, with the usual covenants to
such land or lands as may be
donated to the Trustees of the Cum
berland Presbyterian Church for the
purpose, and upon their securing
good and solvent pledges, payable
on or before the first day of June,
1898. covering the above amount,
provided the action of this commit
tee .is ratified by tho General As-',
aembly at its next meeting, work
will begin upon such site as may be
selected by the committee in or
about Columbia.
"The people of Columbia have
been notified of this action, and It is
expected that they will at once
take up the matter and make good
their part of the proposition. The
committee have nU) decided to
push this work to its fullest extent,
and have requested tho Secretary
to notifv all parties who have
made pledges to Rev. G. B.
Russell for the Orphans' Home to
pay to the Treasurer such amounts
us are due. They have also selected
Rev. J. R. Goodpasture as Financial
Agent, and he will at onci take the
field in the interest of thU impor
tant work. It is hoped by the
above plans that active work will
have begun by spriug, and that in
the early fall the committee will bo
in shape to open and operato the
home.
"It is the purpose of the commit
tee to operate in connection with
the home an industrial school, and,
as far as possible, make the homo
self-sustaining ufter the grounds
have been prepared, the buildings
are erected and furnished.
The committee desire the earnest
prayers and h&arty co-operation of
all lovers of the God of the father
