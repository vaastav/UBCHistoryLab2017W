With the King indorsing the term?
of settlement in which the allegiance
of hie subjects is so vitally affected,
there can be no such thing in Parlia?
ment as real opposition to the pact.
King George will appear in state nt
Westminster when the treaty is pre?
vented for ratification.
Tho first official outline of the agreo

Birkerihcad. ford High Chancellor.who
discussed the success of the negotia

Modifient ion of Oath
There was great rejoicing In Eng?
land and Ireland to-dsrj There were
a tew discordant voices nerfl and there
because the term.; of the peace were
in part a compromise of two opposing
po?i??s of view. The British delegates
naot yielded on th? question of allegi?
ance to th? crown and the Sinn Feiner?
had given in on their demand for a
united Ireland as a fundamental. Not
all could be satisfied when the settle?
ment ia a compromise, but all do pre?
fer it to a renewal of hostilities. The
oath of allegiance as it appears io the
pact is ta marked modification of the
British demand, but. as it apparently
satisfied the King himself, tho average
Briton regards it as a good enough
gas ran ty against an Irish rebellion."

keeping of Lloyd George's premise
This fact added a dramatic element t<
the struggle for peace at the confer

George kept his promise that thej

day he had said he would.
Dublin Press Satisfied
E. J. Duggan, one of the Sinn Fein
delegates, and Desmond Fitzgerald,
their publicity representative, started
on an early train this morning for
Dublin. Long before either thev or
Mr. Shakespeare had reached their
destination, Ireland knew cf. the terms.
Dublin newspapers were, quick to ex?
press their satisfaction, but thc Bel?
fast pre?= was restrained in its com?
ment.
* Although there is enormous reason
to rejoice over thc fact that the two
most important parties to a dispute
which has done more to injure th?
British Empire than any other in re?
cent times have come to an agreement
I*, is too early to say that completo
oeace will ?settle immediately ovej
Ireland. For the time being a pro?
visional gevemment will be established
in Dublin until the attitude of Ulster
has been made known and the details
of the administration have been worked
out between representatives of Sinn
Fein and the British Cabinet. There
will meanwhile be no repetition of the
murders and ntrocitlcs which made
?io-.'th Ireland the world's darkest soot
outside of Russia, but it is felt here
that there is still danger of clashes
between the Protestants and Catholics
living in the north. Religious fanati?
cism still exists, and, although the
treaty goes a long way toward grant?
ing freedom of worship there is no
reckoning without the animosity that
has so long existed in Bejfast and
vicinity.
Agreed on Fondements!?
The agreement came as no great sur?
prise to those who were familiar with
every detail of the negotiations. Suc?
cess was actually snatched out of the
jaws o? failure, but the conversations
of the last three months have done
much to bring Sinn Fein and the Brit?
ish into alignment and to make possible
that moment when Irishmen and Eng
liahmen, wearied and careworn with
long struggling, arose and shook hands
across a document of peace. England
and Ireland had agreed on funda?
mentals.
The country's reaction to this agree?
ment, as expressed in tho press, is
generally favorable. Mo?t of the eve?
ning newspapers are reticent in their
comment, a few of them even giving
the impression of fearing to say the
wrong thing.
Comment ?f the Press
"Tho Evening Newt<** expresses the
hope that Irishmen will be as studious
in keeping the peace as the government
has been in finding it. It says:
"Not alone such a progressive states?
man as General Smuts (Premier of
South Africa), but tho American on?
lookers, who arc all for Irish liberty,
had advised the Sinn Fein not to brea?
its head on independence rock. If
Ulster accepts, 2:20 a. m., December C,
?921, is the greatest moment in the his?
tory of Ireland, and one of the most
important in the history of a world
that is sick of war."
"The Star" says that the fact that
the two major parties to a dispute
which thretened the very basis of the
empire wer? able to agree should make
it impossible for the "won't-have-its"
to wreck a settlement which demanded
Hot only every dictate of national and
international justice, but also plain
justice and expediency.
"The Evening Standard" commends
the statesmanship of the Sinn Feiners
and especially of thc Unionist Minis?
ters, who took their political lives in
their hands and, on account of whose
ett'orts the agreement runs little risk of
being wrecked by extremists, ?3 other
compromises have been in thc past.

it adds, "that these principles contained
no real menace to Great Britain and
she looks to Lloyd George to do hi.?
part in insuring that tho opposition of
a fanatical minority will no longer

iVeiu York Irish Rejoice
Over Peace Seulement
Father Duffy Predicts Speedy
Harmony in Erin With One
Rule for South and Ulster
Th? Irish settlement plan reached in
London yesterday was greeted in New
York with delight by many Americans
of Irish descent and indorsed by other
leading citizens. Among the comments
were:
The Row Francis P. Duffy, rector of
Iloly Cross Roman Catholic Church
and former chaplain of the 69th Regi?
ment:
"I am certainly glad to hear that
there is peace in Ireland. It will
not be permanent until Ireland is
under one government. Ireland in not
such a. big place. There is scarcely
room for two governments. ^ It can be
expected that tho country will soon be
under one government."
Major Michael Kelly, of the Ameri?
can Association for the Recognition of
the Irish Republic:
"We have implicit confidence in Mr.
de Vaiera and the Dail Eireann to see
that Ireland will get her full measure
of freedom and that her birthright will
not be sold."
Joseph Connolly, "Irish Consul":
"We believe in Ascmith's policy of
waiting."
Mayor Hylan:
"That's fine. I'm very glad to hear
it."
Bryan L. Kennelly, president of
Bryan L. Kennelly, Inc., and vice-presi?
dent of the Harriman National Bank:
"In the establishment of an Irish
free state I see the dawn of a new
era; I sense the coming of a new and
better age. God bless those Irishmen
who had the courage to enter the
breach and the fortitude to seo the
peace negotiations through to a trium?
phant finish."
Judge Alfred J. Talley, of the Court
of General Sessions:
"Ireland's struggle and sacrifice
amidst tremendous odds for the ideal
of freedom have been an inspiration in
these days of sordid materialism.
"America, which loves liberty, should
rejoice the most at the return of Ire?
land to the family of free nations."
Belfast Is Puzzled by
Neues of the Agreement
General Sentiment Reported
To Be Doubt and Distrust;
Caucus to Meet To-morrow
BELFAST, Dec. 6 (By The Associated
Press).?A statement from the Ulster
> Premier on the Irish settlement will be
I delayed for some days. The nawa that
J a treaty between England and Ireland
; had been concluded has nonplussed
Belfast. When Parliament assembled
tremendous excitement prevailed.
There was great curiosity, mixed with
anxiety a.B to how Ulster would fare
under the treaty.
Sir James Craig announced m the
House that the treaty had been re?
ceived, but he had not read it, and the
House adjourned after transacting
routine business. The Cabinet assem?
bled immediately to consider the new
situation, and later Colonel Spender,
secretary of the Cabinet, formally an?
nounced* that another Cabinet council
would be held to-morrow to continu?
the discussion.
On Thursday a party meeting oi
government supporters will be con?
vened to consider the settlement.
Colonel Spender pointed out that
there were a great many points requir?
ing elucidation which might necessitate
further correspondence before any de?
cision could bo made by the Ulstei
Cabinet.
In reply to questions, he declarer
that if the south wero going to con?
tinue hostile "it would be better tc
1 have it out now." But if the south
I really intended to act with friendli?
ness, that would put a different com?
plexion on affairs. He admitted thai
the first impression of the Ulster gov
! ernment was one of "puzzlement." Ht
'thought that details were likely to af?
ford more trouble than the broad out
lines', Ulster disliked the form of the
oath propose?), but if it. was acceptable
to the British people, Ulster would not
Object.
The genera! feeling in Belfast to-day
was rather of doubt and distrust.
Pope Benedict Pleased
At Irish Agreement
WASHINGTON, Dec. 0 (By The As?
sociated Press).-?Pope Benedict, a
message from Rome to-day said, ex?
pressed great satisfaction on learn?
ing that ?m agreement had been reached
by the British and Sinn Fein delegato* I
affording a basis for settlement of tho
Irish question.
The Irish struggle has been one of
the greatest anxieties for the Pontiff,
repreehtatives of both sides having had
active friends in Rome.
Pope Benedict did not conceal his
sympathy with what lie regarded the
just claims of the Irish people, but
condemned the use of violence on both
sides.

Shop; Firemen Rescue 3
Trapped by Flames
John Camponi, nine years old, of 230
Stanton Street, was burned seriously
when a fifty-gallon barrel of turpentine
in front of the paint store of Isidore
Bund, at 211 Chrystie Street, exploded
yesterday afternoon and spread flames
in all directions. Charlotte. Farb, sev?
enteen years old, of I' Suffolk Street,
was singed, and two painters who were
in the store at tho time of the ex?
plosion had narrow escapes.
The Camponi boy was passing the
store when the turpentine exploded.
His clothes were ignited and bystand?
ers extinguished the ?ames by rolling
him in the gutter. He was treated at
a drug store and then removed to
Gouverneur Hospital, where it was said
ho had little chanco of recovery.
Miss Farb and the two painters were
cut off from escape through the street
door by the rapid spread of the flames.
Running to the rear they found the
door locked and the windows heavily
barred. Flames were igniting thc high?
ly inflammable stock on the store
shelves when firemen arrived, pried
the bars from the rear windows and
liberated the three.
When fire started in the American
Express Company's Building on Madi?

Forty-seventh streets, yesterday, traffic
was tied up for forty-five minutes. The

To Buy Auto, He Says
Witness Explains Bank Account
at Hirshfield Inquiry Over
Civil Service Accusations
Patrolman Elbert H. Fagan, of mo?

witness yesterday at a hearing before
Commissioner of Accounts Hirshfield
in the investigation of alleged pay?
ments by patrolmen of $1,500 each to
insure their promotion to sergeant in
civil service examinations. Fagan tes?
tified that he withdrew $1,500 from a

money, he said, was intended to be
used in the purchase of an automobile, i
he said.
He said he was unable to find the
right, sort of automobile and placed
$1,100 and the family silverware in a
safe deposit vault at the Bronx branch
of the Corn Exchange Bank. Later he
took the money to his home at 2460
Tiebout Avenue, the Bronx.
An attache of the Commissioner of

'Striking Tribute to thc

Blow to Politicians Here

The reaction of the New York

ing ejeoerpts;
Times
Sinn Fein bus abandoned itn first ex?
treme position. On tho other hand,
(h-3 British government did not ?tickle

. . . If the meetings at 10 Downing

With partisans admitted the windows

the patience und resource of the Prime
Minister, combined with tho practical
sense o? the Irish delegates ? under
strong pressure, a?* the latter must
havo been from the south of Ireland
to make peace?finally triumphed.
One almost feels like pausing to
drop a tear over those who will feel
like 80 many Othellos with their occu?
pation gone after the Irish question is
settled. Particularly will some politi?
cians in this country lament that their
source of reputation and even of liveli?
hood has cruelly been taken from them.
But such personal sacrifices are neces?
sary when the genera) good demands
them. And nothing can really abate
the deep f-ntlsfaction with which the
entire world will receive the news that
at last English political genius has
found a way to put a term to evils in
the relations or Ireland to England
that have existed for more than 700
years.
World
There Is world-wide cause for great
rejoicing in the Irish pettlement. It
ia an agreement for peace founded in
justice and common sense. Ii is a
treaty subscribed to not under duress
on cither side but in thc spirit of for?
bearance and conciliation.
The peace negotiations in London
Beemed to have reached their darkest
hour when the terms of the settlement
were agreed upon. They had dragged
on for months, until a lirai break-down
had looked inevitable. Suddenly from
tho conference chamber in Downing
Street issued the news that the treaty
of peaoe hnd been signed. The situa?
tion had never been hopeless, because
behind the British and Irish delegates
was the impelling force of the demand
of the people of Great Britain and
Ireland thaT, the way be found to avert
further civil war.
In this Irish settlement the British
government has gone far beyond tho
proposals laid down by Premier Lloyd
George in his correspondence with Mr. !
de Valera, and the Sinn Fain delegates
also have receded from their extreme
claims to full independence. It is an
agreement by compromise on details
but resting aiwaya on the fundamental
principle of Irish nationality and Irish
self-government.
Herald
Assuming that this is the end of
seven centuries of her bitterness, Ire?
land has much to thank King George
for. He saw, with an imperial vision
reminiscent of his father .the chance
that had come, the chance that was
slipping, the chance that might never
como again or come on!y after more
and futile verirrt of rebellion and blood?
shed; and he reached out and took it.
As for Lloyd Gcot^e, none will mini?
mize the task he undertook, the stub?
bornness with which he persecuted it
or the wonderful patience he displayed
at trying moments. . . .
Mr. Do Valera and his associate's,
most of them more Irish in blood and
characteristics than himself, must be
congratulated upon obtaining for Ire?
land the status of a "free state."
Here, then, is a victory in which none
is vanquished. Here is the first real
peace in a war which has raged for
centuries and spread far beyond the
islands of the principals. It ought to
be encouraging to the whole world,
which seeks peace everywhere, to see
the seemingly impossible come true.

manageable proportion?. It contends
that Britain has gono to length? of
generosity greater than many of her
fltcarneat critics ever ileniunded, whilo
tho Sinn Fein delegates, regarding *h0
position of Ulster, proved themselves
courageous Btatewmen.
"Wherever our tonguo la spoken,"
says "The Dnlly Telegraph," referring
to the Irish agreement, "tho newn will
be heard with heartfelt joy and thank?
fulness. The event in the greatest that
has happened in the internal affairs of
this country for generation". Tho dig?
nity of the throne and the security and
integrity of the empire are not com?
promised. Therefore, we view the
signing of the treaty as a supreme
event.
"The Premier, in signing tho agree?
ment, has written his nnme among the
greatest in our history."
"The Morning Post" la 'ngain almost
the singlo exception to tho chorus of
press rejoicing at the Irish Battlement.
"The Post" says;
"Never before hua the Britinh gov?
ernment quailed before armed rebel?
lion and organized assassination. These
things are the more remarkable be?
cause they were done not only with
impunity, but with the ucii.iiiesc.nce of
public men of commanding aspect and
with a large measure of general np
provnl, or, at least, of absence or" pro?
test on the part of the people."
"The Post attributes this to "the.
fatal heritage of the war" and the fact
that a tired government is trying to
administer the affairs of a tired people,
which would sacrifice nearly every?
thing fur pence and quiet.
"The Daily Mail," In heartily indors?
ing the settlement, (insumes that Ulster
approved, declaring that, unless the ar-1
rangement was agreeable to Ulster "wo !
cannot suppose the government would
have mudo their welcome announce?
ment."
In a special editorial analyzing tho
agreement, "The Daily Chronicle" com?
pares the provisions with the famous
offer of tho government in July. It
says the most noticeable withdrawal is
that of the claim for free trade be?
tween all parts of the islands, in view
of tho southern Irishman's strong
theoretic leanings to protection.

service corporations throughout the

Message Urges
Labor Laws and
Flexible Tariff
(Continued fro? ?af??n?)
the delay was holding up stabilization
abroad, while it wna gaining absolutely
nothing for this country. The desire
of the Administration on this is to
have tho foreign governments which
owe the United States money substi?
tute bonds which can be sold to Ameri?
can investors for tho I O U's which
they now have in the United States
Treasury. The United States could
then take the monev obtained from thc
sale Of these foreign bonds to Ameri?
can investors and retire Liberty bonds
with It, thus eliminating the interest
paid on some billion? of Liberty bonds
every year, which in turn would aid
in the reduction of taxes. Incidentally
the whole movement would result in
enhancing the value of Liberty bonds,
since tho total of them outstanding
would be reduced materially.
A few of tho other important pointB
in tho message were:
The President's fv?demt dissatis?
faction with much of the Republican
leadership In Congress, including the
tendency of members to join with the
opposition groupa Buch us the
agrarian bloc.
A recommendation for national
legislation to authorize co-operative
marketing by thc farmers.
A constitutional amendment to call
a halt on the issuance of tax-free
securities.
As always i?? the ca?? trifft Presiden?
tial niOfisageu to Congress, members of
thc President's party praised what he
had to say and recommended, nnd the
opposition party generally had nothing
but criticism to offer. On the whole,
the message came up to thc expectation
of Republican leaders, and, as one ex?
pressed it, "tho President has laid out
a program that will keep us bu??y."
There was a general feeling among
Republicans and Democrats that the
President in urging "division along
party lines" rather than "to divide geo?
graphically or according to pursuits or
personal following," was condemning
the agrarian bloc and at the same time
blaming the party leaders for permit?
ting tho disintegration of the party in
tho organization of blocs. Senator
Capper, of Kansas, one of the leader?
in the agricultural group, said he lid
not believe tho President was hitting
at the bloc and added that the Presi?
dent haa nothing whatever to fear
from it.
But Senator Capper's view was not
shared by Senator Curtis, of Kansas,
and _ others among the leaders. They
realize fully what Mr. Harding was
driving at, and feel that ?teps of some
sort are in order to get the party in
Congress to working as a unit.
While some of the agrarian members
were more or less piqued at the Presi?
de nt'c insistence on adherence to party
lives, they were more than pleased
with ills recommendation that co-op?
erative marketing legislation be passed
Thc President, it is believed, was in?
duced to deal with this subject because
of the failure of tho Senate to acf
favorably on the Yolstead-Cappcr bill

work and probably would delay the
date on which the measure will come
before tho Senate.
Advocates of the American valuation
provisions also are worried over thc
suggestion that thc President be ?iven
discretion in applying the provisions.
However, they are face to face with
the issue, for Senator Smoot intro?
duced amendments to the tariff bill
carrying out all of the President's
recommendations. In the end the Re?
publican leader? are expected to follow
the President as the best means of
meeting conditions in Europe.
There has been much talk about
i.bolifthing tax exempt securities
through n constitutional amendment.
Senator Smoot. has one pending in thc
Senate. But, those who commented on
the President's recommendation pre?
dicted nothing will come of it. Even
i hould Congres? propose the amend?
ment to the various states, it is incon?
ceivable, some member? pointed out,
that the states would give up their
right? in the matter.
The President was received heartily
by the audience, which was one of the
largest ever crowded into the House
chamber, He was applauded vigorous?
ly when he entered and when he con?
cluded, us well as at frequent intervals
during his address.
Harding Industrial Court
Fails to Suit Gompers
From ne Tribune's WaaMr.gton Bureau
WASHINGTON, Dee. 6.?President
Harding's proposed industrial relations
court is a "reversion to the conditions '
obtaining 400 years ago, when the
Court of Quarter Sessions determined
wages and condemned men to compul?
sory servitud-: if they resented the de-j
cisions," said Samuel Gompers, presi- ''
dent of thc American Federation of
Labor, in a statement made here to?
night.
If the President had in mind the es?
tablishment of a tribunal to determine
working conditions and wages, he had
ignored the lesson to be drawn from
such efforts in Kansas and in Aus- ?
tralasian countries, Mr. Gompers con?
tinued.
"The analogy which the President !
makes between international affairs j
and industrial disputes is unwarranted j
by facts," thc labor chieftain added, j
"Is it not true that Mr. Harding and
the Senate have stood unalterably
against the covenant of the League of ]
Nations, and for what reason? Be?
cause they have regarded the covenant '
as a legalistic machine to enforce and
compel obedience of any recalcitrant
nation, while his proposal as presented
by Mr. Hughes to the armament limita- :
tion conference is an offer of voluntary
agreement. And it is the voluntary
agreement, thc collective ? bargaining,
the organization of the workers and of
the employers to reach voluntary agree
mentS, ko that strikes, lockouts and
boycotts may be avoided, which must
solve our industrial disputes."
Except for this criticism Mr. Gom?
pers said that the President's message
to Congress was an "admirable docu?
ment."
