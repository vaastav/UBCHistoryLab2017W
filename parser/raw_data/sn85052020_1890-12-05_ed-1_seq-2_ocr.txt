W. P. WALTON.
The president's message is a long and
tiresome documentof 12,000 vvords.which
our imtronB will thank us lor not inflict
the McKinley tariff bill and pleads with
the ignorant common people to study it
more and give it a fair trial. He thinks
reciprocity a good thing, but is not as
much taken with it as Blaine. A Force
bill is needed, he avers, to regulate our
Congressional elections, but it should be
thoroughly non-partisan, though at the
same time advocates a bill by which
his party can do its own registration, its
own enumeration and its own certification.
Knowing that our boasted surplus
had "yanisbed into thin air" and the balance
is now on the other side of the ledger,
he counsels Congress to economize'
after congratulating it on tho great work
it accomplished during its first session,
and tho permanent good it did the country.
The president does not seem to
have heard of the recent verdict of the
people against the outragesag.iinstthem,
either enated or proposed, and writes as
if he were a kiug und not subject to their
dictation and demands. The
Presbyterian don't cuss, but a reader
between the lines can see that he has as
much contempt for the people m if he
had said with Vanderbilt, "Tho people
he d-d."
Gen. Gkken Clay Smith delivered an
address in tho Hall of the House of Del.
egates at Frankfort Monday night on tho
subject of prohibition, but only a small
number of those he wished especially to
hear him attended. The fact is, tho
members of the convention are too fond
of their own chin music to enjoy Gen.
Smith's or anybody else'B and therefore
6tayed away. The general very considerately
said he didn't ask that prohibition
be inserted in the constitution, but he
did ask that tho people be given a chance
to vote on it as an independent proposition.
He would give, if he could, those
who are engaged in tho liquor traffic,
which he charges is responsible for SO
per cent, of the crime and a large portion
i,f the idiocy, lunacy and poverty of the
country, till 1900 to close out and seek a
moro elevating employment. The general
is a pretty good talker and his address
was, as usual, worthy of himself
and the cause ho represented.
Immediately on the assembling of
s Congress Gov. McCreary introduced a bill
to place tin and tin-plate, cotton ties, agricultural
implements and edged tools,
binder's twine, blankets, worsted used
for men and women's clothing and Bait
on the free list. Said ho to a reporter:
"Of course the democrats will seek to.re
vise the tariff, but I thought I would
first give the republicans a chance, "and
see if they have learned the lesson
taught them by the elections." The gov
ernor will find that they nave learned
nothing. If any relief comes to the people
it "must be through the democratic
party, of which Gov. McCreary is bo
earnest and able exponent.
When Clifton R. Breckinridge, whose
eeat was stolen from him by Reed and
his minions, appeared at the bar of the
House Monday to bo sworn in, after his
constituency had expressed its contempt
for the outrage on him, he was tho recipient
of a perfect ovation. Tho democrats
cheered themselves hoarse and basket
after basket of choice flowers were
sent him by admiring ladies. Meantime
Reed looked liko a miserable culprit and
hia fellow robbers felt like going into
their holes and drawing them in after
them. It was a moment of supreme triumph
for right und justice.
Instead of $-1,000,000 increase in tho
Thk democratic newspapers aro not
Tory highly pleased with the president's
message. The 2f. Y. Star says "it is simS
ply a weak excuse for the shortcomings
of the president's party." Tho World
remarks that "it is a singularly
ing on them, though not a dozen would
t ,mg nQ po,icy t(J rccoiumen(l to the
have read it had wo done bo. It is chief
lv remarkable for its bull-headed ness and
the studied attempt all through to show
himself the great I and tho people tho
little u, for he tells them plainly that the
McKinley bill is n good thing and that
the reason they do not think so is because
of their ignorance. Tho paper
starts off by congratulating tho country
that his party has collected S 130,000,000
without stealing nny of it, though that is
yet to ho seen. A good deal of space is
devoted to the State department, but he
manages to tell nothing with winch the
reading public is not familiar. He touches
lightly on tho silver question and says
that our large supply of gold, if not lost
by impulsive legislation in tho supposed
interest of silver, will carry us through.
He is much pleased with the management
of the post-office by Bror. Wana-maker,
although it has cost $o,7SG,o00
more than it paii. The civil service law,
so far as ho knows, has been executed
with fidelity, but it is a subject he evi
dently doesn't care to discuss and therefore
does not do so. The pension enactments
are so liberal now that he thinks
great scrutiny should be given bills for
special relief, both for, the cause and the
amount. He is especially solicitous about
estinif document. His attitude is ono of
nhstinnto, untcachahlo
and his utterances thoroughly partisan."
The Courier-Journal calls it "a stale, flat
and unprofitable document, a confession
upon the part of the administration that
people or to its party that holds out to
them any pronupo of a return of public
confidence. Tho democrats can ask nothing
better than to have the campaign of
which opens with the president's
message, conducted on the lines which
ho lays down." Wo might give many
others, but these express the general sentiment
with reference to the perfunctory
and colorless document.
Thk democratic victory in Louisville is
very gratifying. Booker Reed imagined
himself a bigger man than the party to
which ho owed allegiance and refused to
submit to its action. Henry S. Tyler received
the nomination and, although
Hoed and hisaupporters made the bitterest
kind of a fight, was elected by 'J,75S
majority, and the other democratic
were all, with few exceptions,
elected. Louisville has proved again
that sho is democratic to tho coro nnd
that bolters stand no show whatever.
Thk Senate by a strict party vote of -11
to 30 took up the Force bill and agreeable
to an order of the caucus will press it
fo a final vote, even if tho rules will have
to bo changed to do so. Tho lesson of
the late election seems to have been lost
on the conspirators, who aro moro than
ever determined to punish the people for
their insolence in condemning their par
tisan actions. Let them do their worst.
A reckoning day is coming and as sure
as the Bible is true they will reap the
whirlwind from the wind they aro sowing.
Thk Henderson Howa, which for 27
years has been conducted and edited by
Mr. Benjamin Harrison, announces in
the current issue that it will appear no
more. It is understood that Mr. Harrison
will go to Bowling Green, to which
place n stock company has invited him,
and start a morning daily. Tho Kentucky
Press Association, of which for so
many years he has been the honored and
honest treasurer, will wish him success
even beyond his expectations.
Thk Louisville Post made n gallant
fight for its candidate, Booker Reed, and
but for its bad break in publishing an
edition on election day asserting that he
was elected, its country cousins might
havo continued their confidence in its
reliability, if they had grown suspicious
of its judgment.

authority, pays out to his assistant $-1 17 j

of $333. This is gouging tho State!

Mr. Miller's proposition to abolish
the office of commonwealth's attorney
and require county attorneys to prosecute
all criminal case3 was defeated in
the convention, the more's the pity. The
commonwealth's attorney is at the same
time the most useless and the best paid
officer in tho State, and Mr. Miller's
proposition to do away with him would
have met with better Buccess but for Mr.
Bronston, who seems to he the especial
champion of such attorneys, and
intention of the rest of the
opponents not to abolish a single office,
but create as manv more as possible. At
present commonwealth's attorneys cost
the State $110,000 a yearand they do less
than can bo accomplished by county attorneys,
who are as a general thing just
as capable and necessarily better acquainted
with the cases.
