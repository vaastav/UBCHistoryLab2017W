Ilorrlble Phases of the Trade In Hainan
Being In Africa.
Cologne, Dec 1C At a meeting of the
African Society hero to-day Canon Kespes
read extracts from the diaries of African
missionaries, which told of revolting
cruelty in connection with slave-hnnting
in the neighborhood of Lake Tanganyika.
One of the statements read was as follows:
The notorious slave-hunter. Makatubo.
brought back with him two
thousand natives of every age
ana sex as the result of bis last
expendition to Karwa. These wretched
people were chained in batches of a score.
They were like living skeletons. While tho
caravan was traversing the Kiranao coun
try, where there was a famine, the march"
lug slaves were obliged, through hunger, to
dig up and eat roots which animalsrefused
to sat. Hundreds of them died of hunger,
fever or dysentery. A large number of
women and children, whose want of
strength impeded the rapid inarch of tbe
column, were drowned. Laggards through
illness were killed with cndgels at tbe rate of
from ten to fifty daily. At night they were
sheltered in rootless huts, while the goats
which were being taken along wero kept in
covered stables. Every morning the bodies
of those who had died during the night
were dragged out and thrown to the hyenas
which followed tho camp. Many of the
poor creature were covered with burns
and sores resulting from the punishment
inflicted npon them."
Similar accounts wero given of cruelty
practiced by other slave-hunters. The mis
sionaries ransom tho slaves, and place those
that are s;ck in a hospital whenever pos
sible, t

Food Riots of Dally Occurrence In the State
of Doranso-Corn from Kansas'.
Dcraxgo, Mex., Dec. 16. The distress
among the people of this city and through
out the state of Durango, on account of
tho drought, is on the increase. The suffer
ing among the lower classes cannot be de
scribed. It is a famine of the worst kind,
and the pleadings and cries of the hungry
horde for food are becoming more pitiable
with each succeeding day. Small riots in
the villages throughout the state aro ot
daily occurrence. In a number of instances
store-houses have been attacked by mobs
of men, women and children, made desper
ate by tho pangs of hunger, and robbed of
corn. There are hundreds of people actual
ly starving in this city and thero have been
many deaths attributed directly to that
cause. The state government several days
ago contracted for 100, (XX) bushels of corn
and that order has nov been doubled. The
corn will come from Kansas. It is esti
mated that it will take no less than ono
million bushels of corn and beans to carry
the eullVrers of thia state alone through
tho winter and until next year's crops are
matured.
Cardinal Vannutelli May Succeed Pope Io,
Rome, Dec. 1C A movement is on foot
among an influential ecclesiastical party at
Rome in favor of bringing more into
prominence the candidature of Cardinal
Zeraiino Vannutelli as the successor of
Leo XIII to tho Papal throne. Cardinal
Vannutelli has been nuncio at Brussels
and at Vienna. He is a brother to tbe
celebrated Cardinal Vincent Vannutelli,
cx-nnncio at Lisbon, who enjoys a great
reputation as a diplomatist. fceraiino Van

beat impression at the Vatican.
An Interview with the Tope.
Pome, Dec 16. The Temps prints an ac
count of an interview with the Pope on the
French ecclesiastical question. According
to this account the Pope says his aim was
to encourage a policy of conciliation, and
he wonld havo been better pleased if the
letter of the Archbishop of Aix had been
an isolated manifestation of opinion. He
had been much atlected by the attacks
made upon tbe French pilgrims in Rome,
and he bad been pained to learn that pil
grimages of French Catholics had been
stopped by a ministerial order. The
French government, he thought, erred in
prosecuting the Archbishop of Aix. Minis
ter Fallleres ought simply to have written
a trenchant reply to the Archbishop's let
ter. The prosecution of the Archbishop, in
stead of promoting pence between the state
and church, tended to canse enmity.
Still Harping on Chill.
Lonpon, Dec. 1(5. The Times correspond
ent in Paris sends to his paper a column
dispatch giving tbe text of Chili's reply to
President Harrison's message. In com
menting upon the "surprising character of
American action'' tbe correspondent says:
"The violence of President Harrison's
message would be repugnant to European
Ideas oven if they were only atlected. If,
however, America went to war for a sail
ors' quarrel. Europe might witness a spec
taclo so singular that it would relieve the
monotony of the present times. America
having refused to sign the treaty against
privateering. Chili would be entitled to
equip her entire mercantile marine, even
Auierican-bnilt vessels. as privateers.
Happily, this is a mere hypothesis. Presi
dent Harrison's message is merely rhetoric."

The Sherburne Company Grants the Advance
and the Miners Resume Work.
Special to tho Indianapolis JournrJ.
Brazil, Ind., Dec. 16. Tho Sherburne
Coal Company acceded to tho miners' de
mands and resumed work this morning.
They only operate one mine which is almost
exhausted. It is claimed that this mine
will bo worked out in a few months, and
tho owners thought it advisable to pay the
advance and work a full force of men, with
a view to closing down their mine perma
nently at the earliest opportunity. This
will give employment to seventy-live men.
A report reached here this morning that
Wood mil, Brownell &, Wilton have closed
down their mine at Carbon. The cause is
attributed to their inability to
find a market for their coal.
As the weather is pleasant, the
domestic trade is light, and tbe Chicago
markets aro Hooded with Ohio, Illinois and
Kentucky coal. By the closing down of
this mine two hundred miners ore thrown
out of employment.
No remittance has yet been received by
tho miners from their association, which
leaves hundreds of families on the vergo of
starvation.
No. 8 and No. 10 mines will resume opera
tion to-morrow.. A committee of miners
called on tho Brazil Block-coal Company
to-night and asked fcr work at tho old
price.

Sweeney, of the Switchmen's Mntnal Aid
Association, was asked to-day what action
his organization would take in tbe matter
of tbe proposed new Federation ot Railway
Employes, tho plan of which was outlinod
by a committee here yesterday. He severe
ly scored tbe advisory council of railway
men for the action taken yesterday. "The
switchmen," said Mr. Sweeney, "already
belong to one federation the Supreme
Council of Switchmen and Firemen and
do not care to enlarge that federation. The
new scheme of federation originated with
the Trainmen's Brotherhood, which was
kicked out of the council. 1 think you can
count at least the engineers, firemen and
switchmen out when tho federation meet
ing of Feb. 1 is held."
Adjusting the Differences.
St. Louis, Dec. 16. The grievance com
mittee of the Switchmen's Mutual Aid

Combining Against the Italians.
Crested Buttf. Col.. Dec. 18. There are
some prospects of a strike between the op
erators aud miners employed by the Col
orado Coal and Ira Company being set
tled. The Austrian and English miners
have united against the Italians. There is
some fear that this combination will be
the cause of bringing on another fight, but
every means will be employed to prevent
6uch an occurrence. Many of the men
want to return to work at tho company's
figures of cents per ton and a reduction
ot fifty men. This will let out all tho
Italians.
The meeting to-night did not amount to
anything. The discussion lasted fourhonrs
and when a ballot was taken on the prop
osition to return to work at f5c per ton. it
stood HI to SO against the same. Tho com
pany expect to put men to work at least by
Monday.

nual meeting of the American Sabbath
Union convened at the Central Presbyte
rian Church this afternoon. Organization

including representations from all the

organization for business purposes was

president of tho association, in tho chair.
.Various committees wero appointed, after
which the meeting adjourned.
At tho evening session Iyer. Jos. Mott
presided. The address of welcome to tbo
delegates was delivered by Dr. Fnsbie, of
Des Moines. Colonel Shepard replied to
it. Ho paid a high compliment to Iowa as
a Sabbath-obsorving aud temperance State.
Speaking of the work of tho union he said
it was to restore the observance of tbe
Sabbath. Ho said it was only a eeventh of
the week, and thank God tho majority of
the people in tbe country still observe
it. True, it has its enemies, he
said. They commenced by break
ing the Tenth Commandment, by coveting
the time not their's but God's. The na
tions that are most backward, he said, are
thoso who disregarded tbo Sabbath; those
who were most advanced are those who
observe it. True, not all the people in the
Sabbath-observing countries keep it in its
strictness, but just in proportion as the
numbers of a people observe the Sabbath
just in that proportion God prospers that
people. He said that one of the objects for
which the union will labor is for the clos
ing of the world's fair.
Dr. Herrick Johuson, of Chicago, 6poke
at length on the drity of' tbe government
to insist that this Nation tako no part in
the desecration ot the American Sabbath.
He argued the question nt length, answer
ing the arguments of those who favor open
ing the fair. Other speakers were Rev.
Edward Thompson, of San Francisco, and
J. H. Knowles, of New Jersey.
Alleged Instruments of Torture.
St. Louis, Deo. 16. At the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church Extension Confer
ence, held in the Lucas-avenue Presbyter
ian Church, here, to-day, some very inter
esting dlscnssions were held. After Miss
Bettie Duffleld, a missionary to Japan for
the past six years, had made her report of
the situation in that country, Rev. A. II.
Whatley spoke for Mexico, asking assist
ance for church bnilding and missionaries.
At tho conclusion of Rev. Whatlcy's re
marks one of tho ministers asked whether
it would not be well to concentrate their
work upon the "poor, ignorant Roman
Catholics here, and give them the light of
God, instead of spending bo much money
in Mexico." This brought ont a statement
from Rev. Whatley to the effect that the
Romau Catholics in Mexico were steeped
In ignorance. "1 havo an instrument of
torture in my patchel," he said, "which I
brought from Mexico, with which these
ignorant Catholics scourgo themselves. A
friend of mine has rope with barb wires in
it which one of bis converts was made to
wear by the priests as a penance. She
wora it around her waist, next to the
ficsn." Rev. Whatley recited other similar
instances, and then Rev. J. B. Mitchell
spoke on the subject of "Othor Fields."

New York and the Great Fair.
Ilarrer's Weekly.
It is for the interest of New Y'ork that it
should take part in the fair. Chicago and
tbe rest of the country can easily make it
successful. But it is desired that in such
an assembly of tho industrial forces of the
Union its greatest city should be adequate
ly represented. New York has very little
local priae, although it assumes us own
primacy and supremacy in a way which
other communities are very fond of snub
bing. But there is publio spirit enough
among New Yorkers to prevent them from
indifiernce to so important and national
an undertaking as the fair, and an active
committee, taking the matter in hands
would win a worthy response
New Y'ork is too heterogeneous a city for
great public spirit There cannot be much
common impulse among people which has
not traditions in common, and it has been a
popular defect of the proposed fair that al
though Columbus discovered America, he
is not a hero of tbe popular imagination,
and there is no enthusiasm to be aroused
bv his name. The circumstances were
wholly ditlerent in 1876 at Philadelphia,
and the kiud of sentiment which is neces
sarily lacking in tbe Columbian fair is al
ways of very great service.

DR. RABTLETT AND TIIK CKAJilT-
The Wcll-Known Minister Relates from tha
Pulpit a Tersoual Experience. .
WasMngloa Post.
Something of a sensation was created in
the congreg.itiou of the New York-aveuno
l'rosbyterian Church Sunday morning by
an incident which was related by the pas
tor, Rev. Dr. Bartlett. in the course of
bis sermon. He was preaching about the
cities of refnge mentioned in tbe Bible
wbero persons who had unintentionally
been guilty of a homicide could llee and be
safe from molestation. This suggested a
train of thought in regard to
the large number of deaths that re
sulted from carelessness, more in num
ber by far than was the result of deliberate
intention. He quoted from the President's
message figures which showed that during
the year ended June 30. JSV0, 2,450 railroad
employes had been killed and 22.S.)) had
been injured, largely as tbe result of care
lessness. The speaker referred to the prevalence of
carlessness. resulting in a heavy loss of
life, and then spoke of the deeds of tho
class of people known as cranks. Some
provision, he thought, ought to be mado
for caring for such people and for
keeping them where they could do no
harm. He was of the opinion that institu
tions occupying a position midway in the
scale of punishment for crime between a
penitentiary and an insane asylum ought
to be established for the reception of peo
ple of this kind.
He then spoke of an experience he had on
the previous Sabbath with a man of tbe
crank species. Upon tbe conclusion of the
services last Sabbath morning, he said, a
man came up to him as he stepped
from the pulpit and told hlrn that he
wished to speak to him. He merely
glanced at tbe man, and seeing other peo
ple waiting to speak to him said to the man
that he would see him presently. The man,
however, replied: 'l must speak to you at
once." This remark arrested tho Doctor's
attention instantly, and ho realized that be
stood in the presence of a crank. He looked
hastily to see if ho carried a dynamite
bomb and then glanced the man
over. He saw a man of medium 6ize, with
a tuft of hair standing up prominently
from his head, and features that were rath
er insignificant. The man handed him a
card rather well printed. It contained a
name something like Maurice John Henry
Hogg, and under the name was
tho word brick-layer. While the
Doctor was looking at the card the
man said in a hurried way: "I came here
to see the President I want to see him
specially on a matter of importance. But
1 want it to be understood that all these
people, whether they be Christians or not
who are following me. havo got to stop it
I havo stood this thing long enongh. There
is a band of conspirators, and it mnst be
broken up."
The man went on in this strain, and the
Doctor said that he was not long in reach
ing the conclusion that he stood in tho
presence not only of a crank, but of a hom
icidal crank. He glanced around, thinking
that Col. Moore, the major of police, whose
seat was near tbe pulpit, might be at hand,
and he would turn the man over to him.
Bat Colonel Mooro. as it happened, was not
at church that day. Then he looked in an
other diroction, and the man, evidently
divining his intention, without saying an
other word darted to a side aisle and
pushed his way out of the church as rapid
ly as possible Dr. Bartlett. at the close of
this narrative, stated, to the relief or his
hearers, that he had seen in tbe papers a
fow days later a notice of the arrest of this
man for making threats in regard to the
President. .
THE SALE OF DYNAMITE.
Traffic In the Dangerous Substance Sbonld
Be Restricted by Law.
TfceKpoch.
Public attention hasbecn aroused in a very
sensational way to the absence of restraints
on the sale of dynamite. Any of the com
pounds of nitro-glycerine can be procured
ready for uso in the most deadly form by
any murderous crank or maniao who can
scraoo together a few dollars. These com
pounds are sold as freely as is gun-powder,
and whether the object be the blowing np
of a building and all its occupants or the
wreck of a railway. train, the purchaser has
only to say that he wants the stuff for blast
ing purposes to get it without further ques
tions. The unrestricted sale of poisons
would be less of an anomaly than this, for
the destructive power of any poison is to
nitro-glycerine as the cross-bow is to the
modern magazine riile. Tragedies moro
fatal than that of last Friday, when a
crank tried to blow np Rnsseli Sage and
everybody in his ollico, have failed to arouse
publio opinion to the necessity of legisla
tion on this subject But when the danger
asserts itself at noonday in the heart of
the business quarter of a crowded city, it
may be hoped that the makers of high ex
plosives will be subjected to some clear
responsibility for tbe destination of their
wares. No legal restraints are likely to do
away with theuseof dynamite tor purposes
of assassination, because there is no other
deadly agent so easy to fabricate as it
Bnt something would be accomplished if
its unrestricted sale wero stopped, and if
the severest penalties were atlixed to its
secret manufacture.

to be made during Mrs. Grant lifetime.
Mrs. Grant and her children wonld prob
