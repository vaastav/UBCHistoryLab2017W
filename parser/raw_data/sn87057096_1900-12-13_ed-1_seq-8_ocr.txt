JUCGLIKG SUBSIDY BILL
JtUa of Its Original Form Now JEU
mains.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 11.—One of
the significant things about the prog
ress of the ahip subsidy bill Is the fact
that it has been patched and amended
so that the measure of to-day would
be scarcely recocrnizable by its au
thors If they were not the same per
sons also who did the amending. Tha
bill was first drafted by a committed
Of interested shipbuilders in 1897, three
years ago, arid since that time it haa
been amended so often that all the
earlier reports upon it are practically
useless. Whenever a criticism has
been offered an amendment has been
made promptly, and the sponsors of
the subsidy scheme have pointed to
these repeated changes as an evidence
of their fairness and willingness to
meet all proper criticism. Inasmuch
as the bill lias been so often changed,
it is manifestly impossible for its op
ponents to meet it, for amendments
are made readily, but are not always
calculated to cure the evils complained
of. The bill, it should be remembered,
was drafted by a shipbuilders' commit
tee, the president of which was C. A.
Griscom of Philadelphia, president of
the International Navigation com
pany, commonly known as the Ameri
can line. Yet now, three years later,
the subsidy bill has been amended
deftly in such a remarkable manner as
to change its provisions seriously, and
this change was made for the express
benefit of the mail steamships on thq
Atlantic, and particularly for the per
sonal benefit of the American line.
Biff Ships Lakes to Ocean.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.—Presi
dent McKinley has transmitted to con
gress the report of the deep waterway
Commission appointed to make sur
veys and examinations of deep water
ways and routes for a waterway be
tween the great lakes and the Atlan
tic ocean.
While this board makes no recom
mendations, but simply presents the
facts ascertained by its investigations,
5t says the most favorable route for a
thirty-foot waterway is from Lake
Erie to Lake Ontario, via La Salle and
Lewlston, and from Lake Ontario to
tidewater by way of Oswego and the
Mohawk Valley. The same route W
practically as favorable as any for a
twenty-one-foot waterway.
The estimate of cost for a waterway
of the high level plan, with a channel
of a thirty-foot depth, is $295,915,451
for the twenty-one-foot channel, $199,
184,610.
Hay Threaten* to Reslsn-
Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.—It was
announced almost openly In

in the cabinet is dependent upon the
action on the canal treaty. Most of the
penators understand that Secretary
Hay has positively declared his inten
sion to resign unless the treaty is rati
fied practically as sent to the senate.

Storm Wm so Heavy That thq
Captain of the Towing Vessel Could
Not Pat Abont to Attempt Lift
*.Sg§! ft
Brie, Pa., Dec. 11.—In the midst of
one of the most bitter gales that ever
swept Lake Erie, the ore barge Charley
Foster, In tow of the Iron Duke,
plunged to /the bottom at 4 o'clock this
morning ten miles off this port and
eight persons were drowned, as fol
lows: Capt. John Bridges of Cleve
lan. First Mate name unknown.
Second Mate name unknown Sea
man Robert Wood. Seaman William
Kelly of Port Austin, Mich. Cook
Mrs. May of Detroit. Two unknown
deck hands.
The Charles Foster was one of the^
fleet of James Corrigan of Cleveland,
and for two months had been running
from Duluth to this port with iron ore.
Her cargo consisted of 1,500 tons of
ore.
Gave No Signal of Distress.
Capt. Ashley of the Iron Duke made
this port in safety. In an interview
he said:
"The Foster was In tow about 600
feet astern. I was up all night and
there were three men on watch with
me. The seas were rolling tremen
dously from the northwest,and the gale
carried with it a blinding, stinging
bnowstorm. We made the harbor
light all right When we turned for
the harbor a sea much heavier than
any experienced struck us. I ran to
the stern. Just as I got there the
Foster plunged in an awful sea and
dove nose first. There was not a cry
from a soul of the crew of eight she
carried. Just as she pitched down I.
saw a man on her forecastle with a
lantern. The tow line parted when
she went down. The storm was so
heavy that ,1 could not put about to
hunt for any one. There would not
have been a particle of use anyhow, be
cause in those tremendous seas no one
could have lived a minute, even if
the water had not been icy cc-'d. Had
there been a cry for help I would have
turned and risked my ship, but there
was no use. I had all I could do to
make port in safety myself."
When asked for an opinion as to
the cause of the sinking of the Foster,
Capt Ashley said he could not tell. He
said:
"Apparently everything was all
right aboard her until she took that
fatal dip. There had not been a
single signal of distress from her up to
that time. I gave orders for her to
be watched carefully for distress sig
nals. If there had been any trouble
aboard we would have saved the crew
had it been possible."
Capt Bridges might have been ill
In his bunk when the accident occur
red. The last time he was seen by
the crew of the Iron Duke was when
they passed Sault Ste. Marie Thursday.
There is from 80 to 100 feet of water
where the wreck occurred, and there
Is little hope of locating the spot. The
Foster was valued at $19,000, but there
was no insurance, as it lapsed Dec.
1. The cargo was not insured. The
life-saving crew took a trip out to-»
day, but could find no traces of wreck
age.
Loil for the Beason 118 Men.
The loss of the Foster's crew runs
the number of lives lost on the lake^
this season up to 118. The previous
total of 110 was already the largest for
many seasons. The Foster went down
not far from the scene of the loss of
the steamer John B. Lyon earlier In
the season, when nine men were
drowned.

Atchison, Topeka & Santa fe Men
Walk Out.
BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY.
The Kansas City Times Says There Hay
Be a Great Sympathetic Strike Amoni)
the other Railway''Orders—Situation
Is Strained.
Chicago, Dec. 11.—About 900 Of
the telegraph operators On the Atchi
son, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad, cov
ering the territory from Chicago to
San Francisco, are out on a strike. Ac
cording to the men, advices from
points along the 5,000 miles of track
In the system indicate that the freight
traffic is practically tied up and that
passenger trains' are running slowly,
with no further destination than the
next division terminal. Railroad offi
cials, however, deny these tales and
aver that not more t/han 600 operators
have struck. The order that precipi
tated the walk-out was sent from head
quarters In St Louis by M. M. Dol
phin, president of the Order of Rail
way Telegraphers. He estimated that
97 per cent of the telegraph operators
on the road had obeyed his order,
which reads as follows: "To all
agents and operators' of the Atchison,
Topeka & Santa Fe railroad between
Chicago and San Francisco: Commenc
ing at once, all'operators will refuse
to handle any further company's busi
ness, out will properly proteot any
property In their hands and will turn
it over to the railway's representa
tives. Lock up the office, turn the
board red and leave them so in order
to protect life and property." The
strike thus declared is purely sympa
thetic and has been called to support
the demands of the 300 operators who
since Thursday have been out on a
strike on the Gulf, Colorado & San
Francisco division, of the Atchison,
Topeka & Santa Fe railroad.
The dispute there has been regard
ing wages and rules and the strike
was called following refusal of the
railway officials to arbitrate. The
points at issue were not in themselves
considered of the highest Importance,
but the great cause of complaint was
based upon the corporation's refusal
to permit the dispute to be settled by
arbitration. The total amount of the
salary In dispute on the Galveston
branch did not aggregate more than
$195 a month nor were the rules at
Issue of vital importance. Chicago
operators among those that walked out
attributed most of the present trouble
to what they ascribed as the high
handed conduct of L. J. Polk of Gal
veston, general manager of. the Gulf.
Colorado & Santa Fe division of the
road. After the complaints had been
brought to him and had been briefly
discussed he passed the matter on to
Vice-President J. M. Barr of .this city.
Mr. Barr, however, soon escaped the
matter by sending back the dispute to
Polk for settlement With him it
stayed while the representatives of the
telegraph operators tried in vain to
bring matters to a head. The execu
tive committee ot the railway teleg
raphers reported at the end of two
months that they were unable to get
any satisfaction from Mr. Polk. They
further ascribed his attitude to his
pride in his blue blood, his unc1e hav
ing been President Polk. He himself
*iad been a colonel in the civil war.
Summary or the Fltnatlon.
Latest dispatches show the situation
Is as follows:
Number of operators employed on
Santa Fe system* estimated by Third
Vice-President Barr, 1,200 estimated
by members of the Order of Railway
Telegraphers, 2,000.
Number of union operators out east
of Albuquerque, estimated by railway
management, 240 estimated by strik
ers, 500.
Number of operators out west of Al
buquerque, estimated by railway man
agement, 150 estimated by strikers,
400. Cause of strike, refusal of the
railroad management to arbitrate rules
and regulations, particularly to grant
eight hours' continuous exemption
from work in twenty-four.
Trains Reported Late.
Dispatches from divisional points
along the line of the Santa Fe in
dicate that the great system is badly
crippled by the strike of the telegraph
ers, trains being late and in some in
stances "lost." All passenger trains
are moving, however, and many
freight trains are struggling along as
best they can. Passenger traffic, To
peka reports, has been greatly reduced.
Strike May Spread*
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 11.—The
Times sayfi:. "Within the next forty
eifht hours the walkout of the Santa
Fe operators may widen into a general
strike and the members of the Order of
Railway Telegraphers be Joined by
those of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Firemen and the Brotherhood of
Railway Trainmen. Such is the dan
ger that telegraphers say now threat
ens the great passenger and freight
business of the Santa Fe from Chica
go to the Pacific coast and the Gulf
of Mexico. Before President Dolphin
of the National O. R. T., sent the
cipher message over the wires calling
out the operators on the line of the
Santa Fe proper in support of those
of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe he,
it is said by the operators, was guar
anteed help by the heads of, the other
•big railroad organizations. This is why
a general strike is probable. It is de
clared to be inevitable unless the San
ta Fe management decides to accede
to the demands of the Gulf line tele
graph operators."

best that time, money and skill can
produce.
The owner, a non-resident, planned
and developed the plaoe for a perma
nent home and occupation for a deli
cate son. The latter has recently be
come a hopeless invalid, and as the
owner oan not give the farm personal
attention, he has decided tK sell or
exchange for property near his home,
which he can look after.
ThH is an unusual opportunity for
someone who desire* to engage in the
fruit business on a large scale. For

sufficient or reliable enowgk sfet*
ments to make an article on thlaT
subject very valuable, except as fcf
sort of index to facts whiek are

withheld. But it may be
said, aSk
assumed as true, at least in mini
niuin figures,, that there in *T6br*»
ka over 1,000,000 beef cattle srer
600,000 dairy cattle' over 1,000,009
sheep, and over 3,OflO,OQ&,
ptese figures are, no doubt, fa»r
below the* facts, but are given as
minimum?, on estimates 'fai'rS
taken. Tor instance, in Cuhiing'
county, one of tne best farming,
counties, and not large, not devoteM'
to stock raising, there are over 36,000
head of cattle. In Stanton county*
adjoining Cuming county, both farm*
ing- counties in the Elkh'orn valley,
there are at least 30,000 head* of
cattle, probably considerably oves
50,000 head of hogs. Farther wes%
and in the stock counties, CherryV
county reports over 13,000 head of
horses, over 103,000 head of cattish
and over 16,0«0 head of sheep.
This gives some idea of the stodt
business. As our meats have estab-l
lished a marketable excellenoo
abroad, they are being ej^orted to
very large quantities. Ia lios our
meat product exportation amounted
to $166,679,106.
There is a notable falling off fa* th*
exporting of live animals, no doubts
owing to a shortage of tha products
and the greater'demand it home and}'
to feed oifr own armies and higheii
home prices obtained according)y— -nil,
of which insures to the benefit of thf
grower of the stock.
Notwithstanding these enormoui!
figures in numbers and valuss there
'are millions of acres of gracing and
hay lands along the line of tha Fro*
mont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley R.
R., unimproved and improved, ranchop
which can be purchased atifrom S1.M
per acre upward. Some even as-low
as $1.00 per acre. Surely these sught
to attract people to Nebraska.
