SUMMARY OF CONGRESS.
Senate Proceed ings.
1st Day. At the opening of the Fiftieth
Congress the Senate Chamber wore a fresh
anl tasteful appearance. The floors and gal
leries were newly carpeted, and the desks
glistened in their coat of varnish, the odor of
which mingled faintly with that of the bou
quets and gorgeous floral devices which en
livened the picture. The Senator rat fa
vored in the matter of flowers was Mr.
Daniel, of Virginia. The devices were all of
mammoth proportions, and covered not only
his desk and chair but overlapped
upon the desks of his neighbors.
The galleries were filled, Mrs. Cleve
land being conspicuous among the
visitors. The diplomatic gallery was filled
by members of the various legations, the
front seat being occupied by the Chinese
Minister, his secretaries and associates. The
Senate Chaplain, ltev. J. (i. Iiutler, opened
the proceedings with prayer. The President
of the Senate. Mr. Ingalls, then took the
chair and called the Senate to order. lie
said ho would now place before the JSenate
the certificates of election, the certificates of
appointment and other pap?rs received since
the adjournment. In the swearing in of
Senators-elect, Mr. Hoar made objection to
the administration of the oath to Mr. Faulk
ner, of West Virginia, until certain questions
to which his credentials gave rise could be
pas-sed upon by the Committee on Privileges
and Elections. At the suggestion of Mr.
Kenna, the matter was referred to that
Committee without a vote, and the swearing
in of Senators continued. At the conclusion
of this ceremony Messrs. Hoar and Morgan
were appointed as a committee to notify the
President that the Senate was ready to re
ceive the message, and at 1 o'clock the Senate
adjourned.
Jn Day. Mr. Harris suggested that bills
and mc-morials might be introduced and re
ferred. Mr. Hoar opposed the proposition,
stating that it vas an ancient custom of the
Senate not to enter upon any ordinary busi
ness until after hearing the communication
from the President, at the beginning of the
hession. That was a mark of respect due
from the legislative department of the Gov
ernment to the Executive. He therefor?
moved a recess for half an hour. The mo
tion was agreed to. After the recess the
President's Message was received and read.
Adjournment followed.
House Procecdi iifjs.
1st Day. Long before noon the gal
leries of the House were crowded to their
utmost capacity with spectators of both
sexes, drawn together to witness the opening
scenes of the Centennial Congress. At noon
the Clerk of the House called the body to
order, and was about to call the roll when a
man in the gallery started a Salvation army
hymn, which he sang lustily until ejected by
a" doorkeeper, which was not until several
minutes had elapsed, as the crowd impeded
the officer in his attempt to reach the musi
cian. The Clerk then proceeded with the roll
ca'l amid a good deal of confusion, caused by
gentlemen renewing old acquaintances or
forming new ones amid much talk and
laughter. The pages were kept busy carry
ing belated bouquets and floral designs to
the proper recipients. After roll call Mr.
Carhse, of Kentucky, was re-elected Speaker
by l(i:J votes to 14S for Mr. Heed, of Maine,
and 'J for Mr. Brumm, of Penns3'lvania. Mr.
Carlisle made a speech of thanks, in which
he directed attention to the important labors
which would devolve upon the present Con
gress, and dealt with much stress on the im
perative necessity of such a moderate and
reasonable reduction of the tariff as would
guarantee the laboring people against the ef
fects of financial depression and at the same
time not deprive them of any part of the
just rewards of their toil. The work of orga
nizing the House was then proceeded with.
The House was then called by States, and
the oath of office administered, alter which
Messrs. Cox, Randall and Cannon were ap
pointed a committee to wait upon the Presi
dent and inform him that the House was
ready to receive any communication he
should see fit to make.
2d Day. Mr. Miller (Texas) offered a
resolution directing the Speaker to appoint
the Committees on Rules, Accounts, Enrolled
Bills and Mileage, each to consist of the same
number of members as is provided for by the
rules of the Forty-ninth Congress, and refer
ring the rules of the Forty-ninth Congress to
the Committee on Rules when appointed.
Adopted Several amendments to the
House rules were proposed The President's
Message was received and read, and then the
House adjoined.

The New Postmaster-General.
DON M. DICKINSON
Mr. Dickinson will be the youngest mem
ber of Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet. He was
born at Auburn, N. Y., in 1845. His father
Asa Dickinson, was a distant relative of
Daniel S. Dickinson, but belonged to the
Massachusetts Dickinsons. He went to
Michigan when Don was a small boy. The
new Postmaster-General was educated at the
State University at Ann Arbor, graduating
in 180(3. Three years later he received his
diploma from the law school and began to
Eractise. At first he had a desk in his older
rother's office. When the latter, already a
rich man, went to New York to accept a re
tainer of $10,000 a year from one of the
largest dry-goods firms there, he gave his
business to Don.
On receiving this encouraging gratuity Don
took into partnership another Dickinson,
Julian G., who was no kin whatever to him,
but knew "how to collect debts. The two
prospered and separated, but Don held to
gether the large collection business, in which
he had made a good deal of money. The firm
is now Dickinson, Hosmer & Thurber, and
the senior partner is said to have an in
come all told of over $40,000 a year. A
large part of this comes from his collection
bureau, which he runs independently of the
firm. He hires two or three good lawyers
and a big corps of clerks and pushes the busi
ness with an energetic hand. He is famous
for promptitude and never stups when he
gets after a debtor until he collects his judg
ment and hands over the cash to his client.
He is said to be worth half a million, and
Mrs. Dickinson, who was a Grand Rapids
girl, has a fortune of $150,000 in her own
right. They have only one child, a little
girl three years old.
Mr. Dickinson is a slender, black-haired
man, with black side-whiskers flanking a thin,
pale face. He has been a delegate-at-largo in
every National Democratic Convention since
1870. He was an enthusiastic Cleveland man
long before the Chicago Convention, and
never saw the President until he met him
bv invitation in Buffalo in December,
1884, when Mr. Cleveland had gone there to
arrange his affairs preparatory to making his
home in the White House. Then, in company
with Judge Lothrop, now Minister to Russia,
Mr. Dickinson called on Mr. Cleveland. The
two took a fancy to each other which time
has only strengthen.
