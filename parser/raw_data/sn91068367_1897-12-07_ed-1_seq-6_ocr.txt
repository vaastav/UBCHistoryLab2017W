Tire supreme court decides, in the
case of the state ag-ainst Jones, from
liockinffham, that under sections &2
and 53 of the new revenue act it is not
Che duty of the sheriff to make rerxrt
of tar delinquents to the court, as pro
vided for by this law, until after the
day of levying and selling has passed.
This fully sustains the attorney gen
eral's opinion.
The auditor is now making out the
pension warrants, 5,738 in number.
Some of the iloors in the capitol are
so -much decayed that steam cannot be
turned on them, so offensive is the odor
of the heated timbers.
Bif-nhop Cheshire's address to the
!North Carolina Methodist conference
yesterday was extremely well received,
lie says lie looks for unity of the
JMethodists and Episcopalians.
A republican state otlice-holder said
today: "What fools our people have
1een before we have been in office a
year, to raise all this row about passes.
"VVe have ksilled the goose that laid the
jrolden egg. Just at a time when
passes could do us the most good we
have cut them off."
This week the penitentiary convicts,
eventy-six in number, grading the ex
tension of the Carthage railway, will
ilnls'h it. It is not known what will
then be done with them. A Mr. Wade

numler of them.
The postoffice-holding populists are
trying to stem 'the current which is
sweeping so many of their party back
to the democrats.
Judge Starbuck is making thing3
lively for delinquent tax payers in For
syth county. He makes them all pay
the tax and, in addition, the costs,
never levs than $10.
A republican says there -are now "six
parties" in thrls state gold democrats,
silver democrats, republicans, Russell
republicans, Butler populists and Skin
ner populists.
It is said that the Lynch ites, or sanc
tified band, have acquired a strange
dominion over the people of Southport.
A preacher, -When asked why the
churches did not attack these people,
said they would raise the cry of per
secution. In one house in the village,
of only two small rooms, seventeen
persons live, sleeping together promis
cuously, nine of them being children.
It seems to be the duty of the churches
to drive these people out of the state.
The state authorities have been asked
to do so, but have done nothing.
There is not nearly so much enthu
siasm here in the anti-saloon move
ment or league as was at first shown,
and its promoters are disappointed.
Two of the numerous fakirs who at
the various fairs In t'he state have so
bodly swindled the people, are sent to
the penitentiary from Forsyth.
It is t'he remark of members of the
democratic state committee that there
la to be next year a clean, open dem
ocratic fight from beginning to end,
without compromise or fusion with any
party.
Weeks ago your correspondent pub
lished the statement by a republican
it hat it seemed to him that Senators
Butler and Pritchard had agreed or
about agreed to bury the hatchet. It
was denied. Now the whole matter is
up again. Some of the populists have
for six mouths believed that Butler
was trying to get in wifh the demo
crats. Now they see that the demo
crats will not touch him. Butler is
jrreatly worried. The speech at Rocky
Mount causes much of the worry. He
Iras a four column editorial denial,
rwitlh a score of affidavits.
Mrs. Fanny Hayes, who has leen in
charge of the old woman's home here,
goes to Norfolk, and Mrs. Fletcher, of
Wilmington, succeeds her.

There are seven conferences of the
Christian church in this state. .The
laart oe is now 1n session.

.Kvangelistic Campaign In Onslow Connty
(Correspondence of The Messenger.)
Wards Mill, N. C, December 1.
In less than three weeks there have
leen three new Baptist churches organ
ized with 127 members. The campaign
has been led by the noted Evangelist

JHaydan minister at Berlin sihou'Id fall.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Devoted Chiefly to Currency Question, and
Foreign Affairs Annexation of Hawaii
and Non-interference With Cuba Advo
cated "Washington, December 2. The mes
sage of President McKinley will be de
voted practically to the subjects of
foreign relations and the currency
problem, 'it will be unique in one re
spect in that it ignores the great bulk
of matters usually constituting the de
partmental portions of presidential an
nual messages. There is scarcely a
reference to the subject matter of the
annual reports of the cabinet, the pres
ident's purpose being to call attention
only to the more important affairs of
the government. For this reason the
postal savings project of the postmaster
general is not discussed in the message.
While the detail of the currency plank
are not definitely known, it can be au
thoritively stated that it is in the
main an incorporation of the views
submitted by Secretary Gage, 'though
as to details the president leaves him
self freedom of action by not taking
any position with reference to several
features of the secretary's plan while
endorsing its main object.
A strong presentation of the Hawaii
an question is made and congress is
urged to tak immediate action by
ratification of the treaty of annexation.
This part of the message strongly de
picts the necessity for making the is
land part of the domains of the United
States and reviews advantages chat
would accrue to the country by its
possession.
As to Cuba the message calls atten
tion to the recent trend of affairs on
the island, refers to the scheme of au
tonomy just offered by Spain and, af
ter reciting other developments in the
situation, reaches the virtual conclu
sion that existing circumstances do not
warrant interferences in the affairs of
the .island.
Considerable attention is paid to the
subject of reciprocity negotiations with
various countries in Europe. Special
Commissioner Kasson has been work
ing en this subject for some time and
the message deals with some of the de
velopments of negotiations already had
and expresses the hope of the adminis
tration to secure satisfactory results in
the future. The policy of the adminis
tration on this subject is outlined, and,
citing French champagnes as an illus
tration, the point is made that if special
concessions are given any foreign pro
duct the United States must be given
equal treatment by reciprocal conces
sions. The Alaskan problem is discussed at
some length and a plan is made for
congressional legislation, including the
extension of the operation of the public
land laws and the granting of rights
of way for roads by which all parts of
the country may be made more acces
sible. Hart's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil

Mias Muicer to he Married
As Captain Munger formerly served
on the United States revenue cutter
Colfax in the port of Wilmington, the
following from the Seattle Post-Inteli-gencer,
November 21, will interest his
and his daughter's friends here:
Miss Henrico Munger, daughter of
Captain 'and Mrs. F. M. Munger, and
Mr. L. T. Jones, of the Grant, will be
married December 8th. The wedding
will be a quiet affair and none but the
relatives and intimate friends of the
contracting parties will witness the cer
emony. The engagement was an
nounced by Miss Munger at the recep
tion given Wednesday afternoon on
board the Grant. Mr. Jone3 is a south
erner, his native home being Baltimore.
He has been with the Grant for three
years and is- considered one of the
ablest young men in the service. Miss
Munger is probably better known in
this city than is Mr. Jones. Since Cap
tain Munger has made Seattle his head
quarters she has been here and has at
tended many social functions. She i3
an accompished young woman and
has accompanied her father on many
of his trips to foreign ports and is as
well informed about "service matters"
as the average officer.
Reports of the- Indian Schools
Washington, December 2. The an
nual reports of Indian schools show
considerable progress at Carlisle, Pa.,
and Hampton, Va., the principal insti
tutes. Superintendent Pratt, of Car
lisle, reports an enrollment of 762 pupils
at the beginning of this fiscal year and
they include representatives of sixty
eight different tribes. Captain Pratt

tal enrollment at the Hampton insti
tute is 138, embracing representatives
of thirteen tribes.

cerlike conduct, in , the disbursement of

TEH PROPOSITIONS
LAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
BY THE CUBAN LEAGUE
The Cause of Freedom Itetarded by Indirect
Aid of Oar Government to !pain The
Prupovitiou of Autonomy to Gala Time.
The People Demand Kecogailion f, the
Cubans ou Interference by Oar Gov
ernment the tteult of Influence of the
Money Power
Washington, December 2. Mr. Berk
ley Balch, secretary of the Cuban
League, appeared before President Mc
Kinley and presented the following ar
gument in behalf of the Cuban insur
gents: Mr. President: We appear before
you in the name of those who have died
for the cause of .freedom in, the island
of Cuba, and for those who are still
ready to give their lives today or to
morrow for the cause; also represent
ing as we claim, a majority of the peo
ple of the United States, who lelieve in
that cause, and demand that their
wishes shall now be translated into
efficient action by their chosen repre
sentatives. Thanks to the power, honor
and patriotism of the American press,
the people today know the essential
facts of the Cuba.n situation. We sub
mit to you, therefore, these' ten propo
sitions for your consideration:
1. The three wars in Cuba within
this century are proof of a genuine
movement for the extension of demo
cratic principles and the attainment of
liberty from a tyrannical, corrupt and
alien government.
2. Without the indirect aid given by
this government to Spain, the patriots
would be further advanced in their
struggle.
3. Spain has lost Cuba as far as the
present population is concerned. If,
however, she is permitted to continue
the cruel work of exterminating non
combatants, she may possibly recon
quer and re-populate the island.
4. If with our passive aid, she un
fortunately succeeds in doing this,
when another generation comes, the
revolution will surely begin again. The
govering classes in Spain of all parties
have regarded Cuba for 300 years as an
orange to be squeezed. They are un
able to consider it otherwise and no
amount of diplomatic effort on our part
is likely to change their point of view.
The other classes are ignorant. Spain
has held all her colonies with an iron
hand until forced to let go. The war
of liberation in Venezuela lasted fifteen
years and during the last five years of
the struggle no quarter was given by
either side.
5. Autonomy is a foolish dream. It is
evident that neither side understands
it. wishes it, or can administer it. It
is proposed to amuse this government
and to gain time.
6. A majority of the people of this
country desire to see a free and inde
pendent Cuban republic. An opposing
factor of great force is the money
power. It is a fair conclusion to urge,
that a majority of our people believe
that the assistance of our government,
till now, has been given to Spain and
withheld from the republic, on account
of the influence that eminates from
great financial interests, usually afraid
of patriotic aggressive movements.
7. Our people have hoped for favor
able action for Cuba from the present
administration and have patiently
waited to give the administration time
for consideration of the wise road to
this end. That patience is now ex
hausted. 8. Very few Cubans and still fewer
people of this country desire immediate
annexation; but independence is clear
ly due to Cuban valor and sacrifices.
9. The friendship of the republic of
Cuba is. worth vastly more to us than
that of Spain, for reasons of business
and defense. It is our duty and self
interest to recognize the bellligerency,
and, logically follow this, the indepen
dence of the republic, and to conclude
with a defensive and offensive alliance.
If this is not compatible with a con
tinued friendship with Spain, so much
the worse for Spain. If Spain attacks
us we can take care of our own.
10. Out of the experience of our work
and from the study of over twenty
years this league asserts that these ten
propositions are true and that their
right understanding leads to the only
action which will solve the problem.
And now, Mr. President, in behalf of
those we represent, we thank you for
this opportunity to present their views.
We hope for such action on your part
as will bring a correct solution. We
desire to state that this league and our
sympathizers have "enlisted for the
war" or until such, times as the repub
lic of Cuba shall become a fact in his
tory. The president said he would give the
argument careful consideration.
Fraud Cases Dismissed
Birmingham, Ala., December 2. In
the federal court today nine cases
against Major W. H. Hunter, three
against Sandy White and six against
C. C. Reed, charged with presenting
false claims against the government
were dismissed.
Four years ago the federal grand jury
here made sensational charges of
wholesale frauds against the govern
ment by federal officials in North Ala-
bama alleging that the government had
been defrauded out of about $100,000 by
false claims by commissioners and
deputy marshals. The treasury depart
ment sent two examiners to investi
gate. As a result two commissioners
and eight deputy marshals were in
dicted. Commissioner Robert Charl
son, of Atlanta, whose stealing amount
ed to $20,000 is now serving a term in
the penitentiary. Other convictions oc
curred but appeals were taken and
cases dragged along until today when
the last of them was finally dismissed.
All parties are prominent. Hunter was
formerly commander of the grand army
of the republic dn Alabama.
Sloan Not to Ride for the Prince ef Waes
London, December 2. Gaines, the
manager of Tod Sloane, the American
jockey, says there is no truth in the
statement made iby The St. James Ga
zette yesterday afternoon that Sloane
has contracted to ride for the prince of
Wales and Mr. Pierre Lorillard. The
manager said: "Sloane has not receiv-,
ed an offer from the prince of Wales,
nor !has he even met the prince. He
highly appreciated the compliment the
prince of Wales paid him in allowing
htm to ride one of his horses, which
was an unusual one considering that
he was an unknown American when he
came to England and without backing-."
