THE DEBATE ON THE TONQUIN CREDIT
BILL.
HICKS PACHA'S DEFEAT?CABIN KT MATTERS-MR.
GOSCHKN'S DECMNAT10K.
|BT CA* LE TO TUB TRIBUNE. 1
LOM'OLN, Dec. 8.?No inferences can be drawn
iTom yesterday's unfinished debate on the Tonquin
credit bill in the French Cbambor. Tho Paris
correspondents expect that the credit will he voted,
but drop ominous hints of an accompanying vote of
rjonsuro on M. Ferry, more of whose duplicities and
deceptions stare them in the face as they turn over
the Yellow Book. The Bourse's dispatches last
May prove that the Ministers were fully informed
and were explicitly warned of tho certainty that
the Chinese were determined to resist further
French incursions in Tonquin, aud wore able to
otter formidable opposition. A further dispatch
fi om Marquis Tseng, not included In tho Yellow
Hook, and the existence of which was denied by
the Ferry journals, appeared to-day, dated Decem?
ber 5, expressing the hope that Admiral
Courbet would be ordered not to ap?
proach Bac-Ninh or 8ontay, and dn-l-f?g
that such an act would be deemed by
Chiua as inconsistent with French professions of ?
desire for peace. The French official journals
nevertheless during the week kept repeating that
China was ready to abandon those positions, and
that Admiral Courbet's expected attack was de?
layed despite the pressure from Trimo Minister
Ferry.
LACK OF KNERGY IN KGYrT.
Bits of evidence continue to come from Egypt
confirming thc destruction of Hicks Pacha's army.
Baker Pacha remains at Cairo hurrying forward
reluctant troops. The transport facilities are deft*

iliowinir a lack of enemy. There appears to bo
Blight h< pe of saving Khartoum.

The oratorical dud between Lord Hartington and
Mr. Chamberlain continiies.the critics inferring from
Lord Hartington's moderation and Mr. Chamber?
lain's audacity that tho Kadical programme is
likely tn carry the Bay in tho Cabinet. Every
Ministerial speaker denies any division in the
Cabinet, Mr. Chamberlain himself calmly (Whiring
that he is quite unaware of any, but Lord Salisbury

tively that reform in the London municipality will

*n far different terms, recent events in Ulster

iras given to Lord Rossmore yesterday at Mon*

I-U 81'EAKKRsHlP OF THK COMMONS.
Mr. Goschen's final refusal to accept the Spcaker
ihip of the House of Common.'I saves a first-class
itatoflman to active public life. Tho extreme radi

The President's message arouse^ but languid in?
terest, and the comments are without point. Mr.
Carlisle's election was first telegraphed here as a
lecisive triumph for free trade. The English press,
learning prudence from repeated delusions, received
ihe news with cant ions hopefulness. The Reeaeamn,
while conceding the improbability of tariff legisla?
tion at this session of Congresses sanguine enough to
?peet that before long a decided step will be
nade toward free trade. Reflection confirms the
Irst English view of the Suez canal agreement. It

?apposed to be complicated by the recent ougage

Something very like a quarrel arose in tho scien
-fic world from Mr. Romanes's reading before the

Darwin's fame or the existing stock of scientific
-nowledge. Mr. Romanes admits that the paper
Ban never revised, but insists that the publii at iou

THEATRICAL AN'. TERsONAL.
"Claudian," by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills,
was produced on Thursday at tho Prince*? Theatre
It was a bold attempt to popularize the poetical
diama, dependiug for its success partly npon the
imaginative treatment of an almost impossible mo?
tive, and partly upon the elaborate scenic effects.
Thc audience was puzzled aud received the play
rather coldly. The real triumph of the evening
was Wilson Barrett's acting, but tho press awards
high credit to the authors.
The reported dissatisfaction of the Belgian
African Association with Stanley, and the aUeged
dilliculties between him and the negro? on the
Congo, are authoritatively denied.

strongly censures thc Catholic clergy at Newry, Ireland,
for their attitude, during thc recent agitation there. It
especially condemns thc sermon of Father MacCarten In
the Cathedral at Newry last Sunday, tn which he charac?
terized the action of tbe Government In prohibiting a Na?

EXTENSIVE FRAUDS IN CITY CONTRACT&

A SYSTEM OF UNBALANCED BIDS OF THE- WORST KIND.
TILE LOSS TO THE TAXPAYERS AMOUNTING TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS-.
IRE METHODS OK THE OI.I) CANAL RINO TRANSFERRED TO THE STREETS OF NEW-YORK?HOW THU
ri'BLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT ALLOWS PUBLIC MONEY TO BB MISUSED*
Care fill investigation of department records by Tribune reporters reveals the existence ra
Ibis city of a ring of contractors whose methods are similar to those of tho Canal Ring, which
(mis broken up eight years ago. But no effort has yet been made to break up the corrupt com
liiiiiitiou which is defrauding tho taxpayers of New-York. A system of unbalanced bids, by
which thc public treasury suffers heavily, has grown to startling proportions in the Department
A Public Works, under thc eye of Commissioner Thompson. Misleading estimates of thc work
to In-.lone are tho rule rather than the exception in that department, and certain favored con.
tractors succeed in obtaining secret information as to thc real nature of the work which these
misleading estimates cover. They are thus enabled to put in unbalanced bids at figures which
result iii tarn Kains to them and serious losses to the city. Tho extraordinary nature of these
lids may be imagined when it is known tbat the Department of Public Works is now paying oa
?ontracts still in force all thc way from one cent to eight dollars per cubic yard for exactly tha
mme kind af excavation. Honest contractors are driven out of the field by the ring of men who
mt in thc unbalanced bids. These outrageous street contracts, of which tho Public Works De
iiirtiucut is full, result in the vacation of assessments on an extensive scale, throwing the whole
.unit n of tho expenditure on the city. By the vacation of assessments resulting from these
.buses the municipal treasury has suffered to the extent of millions of dollars in the last few
?cars.

ot' earth excavation and a small amount of rock
excavation, the estimates ravene the amounts.
Itids ure invited for a small amount of earth exca?
vation and a loree amount of rock excavation. A
ooatroctor knowing tbe truth ooaeealed by the
estimates I.nU a nominal price for rock aud a btu
prim for earth. In thai way on the face of the
estimates his total bid will bo low. But as he ls
paid by tho cubic v ard, accord?ur to Ihe returns on
the c.mpleted work, his bid will ui tue end turn
mitt, ba the highest, and thc city is consequently
defrauded. If a contractor bids I cent per cubic
yard for excavating rm-k and $'_' per cubic yard f"t
exeOYOl itu.' earth, the bid is plainly " unbalanced."
It is out oi' al! re-OOP, and shows at a (.lance that it

Alleged errors of a startling character have been
diseorered la tho estimates prepared by eogtn-on
employed by tbe Public Works Department. At
!. a i one contractor in every OOM is awaro of these
? ip rs tt) before ho makes his bid, aud ls
thus able t? secure contract- at figures out
of all proportion to tlie value of tho work. Con
traeton have been paid over ??100,000 for work on
which theil t"tal bid was less than 910,000. John
Brady, a contractor la the Pttbtfa) Works Depart*
ni-iit, is receiving $** a cubic yard for excavating
Barth, while the value of the work is not more than
fifty conto I cubic ford. Michael Pinn, another
contractor, is receiving $7 80 a cubic yard for tho
name work; and 1). K. Qollaghef is receiving$.5 SO.
In the Park Department J. W. O'Grady was n -
Bently poid900 a cable yard for excavating rock,
while another contractor was doing similar work
f..r ;f_ a cubic yard, which was a fair price. In tho
Public Works Deportment agaiu J. D. Mooro was
paid ,?10 a cubic yard for rock excavation,
and oth.-r contractors havo been paid from RRtB
ft a yard for the same work, the fair value of
which was established hy tho Assessuiout Commis?
sion at less than ,f'_ a cubic yard.

for each item in tho work. In regulating and
grading a street, for instance tho engineer"* ure sup?
posed to mako careful surveys, and to present
accurate estimates of th.* .juantity of earth and
rock to be excavated. Tho contractor then bids a
price per yard for each kind of work. Tho lowest
total bid according to tho estimated quantities
determines to whom tho contract shall be given.
Hut the contractor is paid his price per yard with?
out regard to the estimates. The estimates are
often fictitious, and this is known to contractors.
Hy mcaus of this knowledge they aro able to get
enivruioii-ly high rat.is for work, while contractors
who do not know tho inside facts are prevented
from securing such contracts. Tho result is shown

These are but specimens of man** that havo been
made within a comparatively short time. It has
b.-eu shown by testimony before the Assessment
Commission that contractors have been paid in full
for work only partly done. lu ono case o contrac?
tor was paid for taking out 8*788 cubic yards of
rock which is still in the street. The most friendly

t!u ri is plenty of evidence to provo the existence

caped thc scrutiny aud publicity that would have
followed if lt had come before tho Hoard of Estimato
or the iSiukiiig Fund Commission.

In conducting the street improvements under
which these contracts have been made, the Com?
missioner of Public Works and the Park Commissiou
ers act in the capacity of trustees for tho owners of
the property b-QCfltod by the improvements. Tho
law requires that the fair cost of any work of this*
kind bo assessed on the property b.-nelited. Tho
city does tho work and pays for it by the Issue of
bonds which are to be paid off when the assessments
are collected from tho owners of thc property bene?
fited. But thc losses caused by any breach of trust
OB tho part of the city have to bc met out of the city
treasury. The assessed property-owners go into tho
courts aud prove that the cobt of thc work is ex?
cessive and thc courts vacate the assessments. Tho
- then added to the city debt, which is paid by
general taxation.
."since l-t7tj tho city has lost $3,IMS,431 byro
rated assessments, nearly all caused by unbalanced
bids. Hut that ls not one-half the total loss. Tho
courts have decided that the fact that the work wm
done by contract under public letting is no excuse
for excessive cost, as thc city was not bound to ac?
cept such contracts. Hence, under advice of tha
Corporation Counsel, and in order to BOT* to the city
at hast a part of the amounts paid on assessment*
wink, the Heard of Aldermen 1ms recently assess,,[
property-owners only what the Board cousidem
the fair valuo of tho work dot;.* without regard to
the contracts made by the Commissioner of Publio
Works or the Park Board. Tho excess of cost over
the amount levied iii tho assessment is charged,
among other matters, to a fund called Deticiencieo
in Assesniiieiits. This fund, which represents a total
loss to the city, now amounts to $4,4*. 1,350.
Hut this does not cover all the loss. There is an
Assessment Commission, created by tho laws of
1880 to reduce assessments wheu the. cost of tho
work ls excessive. Nearly all the COMO cooring be?
fore tnis Commission asmt limn claims of MOpar* v
owiiers for relief because of unbalanced bids.
During the past week the Connini.wioa made a re?
duction In one case of 80.996 b* BO-O the work
was done under au unbalanced-bid contract. At
the same time, in another euee, the Commission made
a reduction of 8108,484. They di.-covered among
other irregularities, that the contractor had received
pay for excavating 27,000 cul.ic yards of rock at $2
per cubic yard, although the rock had uot b?'.-a
taken out. Altogether tho Assessment Commission
has made reductions amounting to over .* 1,000,000,
and in addition has returned nearly half a milli.in
dollars to property-owners who had paid BBBBBSYrm
.?nts Dcsidcsall that, the etty loses the in?
terest which it has paid on assessment bonds issued
to pay contractors for work on which reduct ioxxa
and vacations have been made.
Altogether since 1"?70 there han been a loss to the
city treasury of over if-ii,OOO,OOO because ol frauds,
irregularities and excessive cost in assessment work.
Nearly all this loss has been caused by unbalanced
bids. _

The evil- growing out of these unbalanced bi _
can be shown best by illustrating the method of
preparing false estimates. In the estimates pre?
pared for a proposed street improvement it woo
stilt.-d that th.re were required 15,000 cubic feet
of rock excavation and 5,(KIO feet of earth excava?
tion, when iu reality the figures should bc re versed.
A conti actor in tho secret would bid a high price
for the earth excavation aud a low price for tho
rock e-euvatiou. As the contract was to be given
to the Lowest bidder on the total amount of the bid,
tho result would bc that the contractor who knew
that tha est imates wero misleading would securo
tho work at a fraudulent figure. A contractor uot
in the secret, but relying OB tl*.* fairness of the es?
timate of the Public Works Department, would bid
about as follows:
15,000 cubic yards rock excavation at $135
peiyard. 0-0,250
5,000 cubic yards earth excavatiou m .Oe.
per yard. 2,000
Total. #_-,_30
The contractor who knew that the estimates wero
misleading, and that th. re would be 15,000 cubio
yards of earth and 5,000 of rock, would bid as fol?
lows :
15,000 eul.lc yards rock excavation at 10c. per
yard. 81.500
5,000 cubic yards earth excavation at *W per
]anl. 15.000
Total. -llrt.OOO
The second bid being $5,750 lower thau the tirst,
of couts** tho luon-st bidder loses the contract. Hut
when the work is finally paid for by tho city tho
account of the favored contractor is a.- follows :
5,000 cubic yards rock excavation at 10 cents per
yard. ?50O
15,000 cubic yunis or e-itb. >? .. avail.m ut l*KJ per
yard. 45.000
Totul.$.5 500
In this way the favored contractor by his unbal?
anced bid, gets $;l'_\750 moro for the same woric
thau it would havo cost the city at tho honest bid?
der's rates, aud the city is swindled out of that
dum.
This is no fancy sketch, but a practical illustr*
tiou of what is going ou daily in the Depart?
ment of Public Works. lu March last, tho
Mayor's attention was called to a contract let
in thin way which cost tho city $-0,740,
although the estiu-ate of the Public Worka
Department was for $8,-03 ouly. Tho
estimate of tho Department on another coutract
was for $4,800, but the city paid more than threo
times that amount to the contractor.
