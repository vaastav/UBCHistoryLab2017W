Yesterday Ihe County Board of Supermen
made tbclr acnnal visit of Inspection to tbe

K. e ,.« end commanding a view of the city lying
j'o the distance in its veil of smoke, which
ii*cs like incense towards heaven forever and
ever. The main building Is a substantial brick
structure of three stories and basement, to
which have been attached long two-story vrmpt
of wood, so tl at the whole building is capable of
accommodating probably five hundred Inmates.
Adjacent are various smaller structures—a small
ttvo-etory bonding, occupied principally by uld
men, the baking nonsc. work honsc, broonuacto
ry, small-pox bouse, and barns, aid other appnr
leuauccs of a lanre tatm. Externally the appear
ance of the establishment Is that of a great com
fortable country hotel. We step within and
the impression changes. From the plainly
furnished reception room wc go at once into
the midst or the unhappy panpers, the aged, the
or; bans, the sick, the insane—the very Imperson
ations of want, disease and sorrow, who have
sought or been forced to accept witbiu thesewalb
the core ard shelter which the great .hurrying. 00l-
Bldc world would not give them, to make hero
their dreary home, to take here, many of them,
their last weary look on life.
Wo look first Icto the women's apartments.
Hero arc the aged females and those in middle
lift*, whose husbands and sons are dead or have
basclv deserted them; and so, helpless and forsa
ken, these once happy wives and mothers linger
out their aimless lives. Some elt silently In the
cut ncr, seeing not the strangers, for the light has
gone from their eyes; some are able to sew or
knit, aud thus have employment (or their fingers;
s few can read, and so can ond some food for
their mental hunger. Next we enter the Juvenile
apartments, where some twenty children, from a
dozen days to a* many years of age, arc cared
for bv motherly looking women; and here
in the unthinking happiness of childhood we see
the only cheerful faces of the whole great com
munity. These llule ones, children oi want or of
shame, wear, many of them, bright and intelli
gent faces, and may, in their after years, forget
and overcome the sad prestige of tbcir early days.
One little bov there was stone blind, with no
Irhndsor relations in the world, who has bat A
hopeless lot before lam. Too tick men's wards
are next shown. Here lies a nan with hollow
eyes and emaciated form, whom consumption
will soon kindly relieve; bore, another drawn
up and tortnred by ihenmalism; here, one
dcceitly dressed, with a look of respectability,
who la much of the time insane, bat quiet and
bat ml ess; and so through tbc catalogue of ills
and woes. Kot tor distant are the sick women,
victims 100 of consumption, rheumatism, fever
and other frequent and often hopeless infirmities.
N*o sadder sight can he found than that of an
aged woman, who has been a happy wife and
mother, lying here alone in bet hard cot, friend*
less and hopeless, slowly hut surely parsing
over the road from which there is no return.
One old lady, sixty-six years of age, who had
been in the bouse two years and is now near the
point of death, la to hare a son keeping a
saloon on Clark street, and in comfortable clrcum*
fiancee. Another bed-ridden old dame of sixty*
tlx rears wears ont the long hoars with
thoughts cf a son not tax away who is living amid
abundance, while she Is fed by the cold hand of
public charity. Such filial ingratitude Is almost
too great for ueilcf.
The Insane Department exhibits another phase
of sorrow and misfortune. Within strongly
haired cells or, when the symptoms are mild, in
balls adjoining, seventy-eight unfortunates are
now confined, from whom the light of reason has
fled. Here ail decrees of insanity are manifested.
Some sit upon the floor or walk alone, muttering
to themselves or bursting into unmeaning
laughter as some strange fancy darts
cm oss their disordered brains. Some
arc sullen and refuse to be approached; some axe
wildly tall.alive and sc'ze the visitor by tbc baud
and tell him the story of their Imagined troubles.
One Unman girl Implores each visitor intake
her out, haying continually “ I be not crazy,*’ “ I
he not crazy.” Another .called “Bridgeport,”
who gives her name as Hate Uervcy, biull of
wild gayety. “I’m a statue,” says she; “I'm
the month of Way, the queen of May;’' “I’ve
been through hell and I don't want to go
again.” An excited woman says her nameTa
MaryMcHtaw. “Me friends live In Ireland and

jects for study.
In a two-story building west of the main edifice
seventy male paupers, mostly old men. lodge.
Hie low beds lie close together along tbc walls
and on these and on tndc benches they lie or ait,
antidote the time away, save when they are inter
rupted at the nme of meals or to attend to some
trifling employment about tbc building. A few
leitamcnts and papers are seen, hut little Intel-
Isciual curiosity Is left to prompt to their read
ing. Some of them arc intelligent looking men,
who have apparently seen prosperous days.bul are
now crushed and broken by the band of adversity.
A tew are healthy, hearty fellows, who, too lazy
or 100 weak-hearted to earn their own bread,
come here ue the winter begins and
hang about tbc stoves until tbc summers
sun drives them forth to pick up an unwilling
sustenance again. Most of tbc inmates of the
house, however, are real paupers, broken down
in spirits and fortune, sick, friendless or old, and
genuine subjects for the deepest pity.
The PoorHon*e and its appurtenances appeared
yesterday In an excellent state of cleanliness aud
order, and the Warden. Mr. M. L. Pmney, with
his assistants, seem to attend faithfully to their
unpleasant duties. There are at present 804 in

cholera season, thirty died ol tills disease In a

We published yesterday au abstract or the bids
opened in tbe office of the Board of Public Works
fortbe completion of the work on sections 17 to
37, Inclusive, ol the Illinois & Michigan Canal.
Eleven bids were opened, most of them for all the
sections ; one or two for only a portion.
The binding was what may be called “wild," the
figures varying widely, ranging from 51 cents to
Si.so per conic yard for earth excavation, and
from gi.Mto #5.50 (or tbe stone excavation.
Ihe contract price of Fox, Howard &
Walker was tblrty-tnrce cents for earth and two
dollars for stone. Thathrm was one of tbe bid
acre on the re-submlsslon of tbe work, tnetr esti
mates ranging at about sevcnly-lhrce cents and
three dollars and a halt, or folly twice the amount
of tbelr first contract.
It i£ rumored that the Commlsslonera do not
know what to do with the subject; they have ah
elephant of decidedly elephantine magnitude on
Ihdr bonds, or perhaps wo might call It au ana
conda— m view of the tortnons character of the
canal—on anaconda which threatens to swallow
np the wealth 'of tbe State, to
consume many long years of time, and
may yet engnlpn the Commissioners themselves
in its vast maw, as the former contractors say they
themselves have been wbat the French wonld
tern enaloutt. The lowest of the recently offered
bids calls for about a million of dollars more than
the original contract price, and there Is no security
that even that would not be found too little. as the
repudiation of contracts with tho city Is now
fashionable. They do not know bnt the canal
may tnrn Into a quicksand which will absorb all
, the money now appropriated, and necessitate tho
making of still other appropriations for US com
pletion. _
They doni know wbat to do. To let the con
tract to the present lowest bidder would be dan- .
gCTons. Indeed they think unwise, as the bids ate
evldcntlv wild, and the work conld be done at I
much less than the lowest- 11 la rumored »ba» the I
proposition has been broached to make It a city
undertaking, at least fora while, till it could be
seen what ibo actual cost ie.wnd then to take
those figures as the basis of a contract with some
one who w onld bo willing to make the bargain.
Of coarse no one knows as yet wbat will be the
course taken. . . . ,
The publican; a little curious to know why the
contract with Messrs. Fox, Howard & Walker was
not insisted on. Very many Inquiries of this tenor
were addressed tons yesterday. We are enable
to answer, and will be glad if any one will throw
light on the subject Ihe contractors gave bonds
lor the faithful performance of their contract, said
bonds being represented as sufliclcnt to Insure the
city against loss. Why was the contract vacated ?
We would not insinuate that there was any Im
pioper reason; wedonot think It probable; bnt
there evidently was a reason, and it most have
been a strung one. The people, an extra multou
of whose money is now imperilled, think they
baveanebt toknow. Will the Board of Canal
Commissioners please explain?
As before hinted, the vacation of contracts, or
rather their attempted vacation, is crowing alto
gclher too fashionable. Now it Is IbciAueTnn*
nel, then the Canal. Bye and bye It will be some
6 tied contractor, and then, perhaps, some city
official who, having contracted to serve tbe city
for a certain term at a certain rate, will “strike,'
and withdraw bis valuable services unless extra
■ compensation be allowed. These are vicious pre
cedents. and cannot bo too carefallv guarded
against. It should ho understood that a contract
a contract, whether made with individuals or
corpoistions, and a contractor should be held to
bis bond, if a man or firm do not understand
their business well enough to know beforehand
what a certain amount of work Is worth, they
should Id It alone. To abrogate contracts Is to
ivo a death blow to boncst competition.
ACowaudit Assault.—On Monday lift, Mr.
B. J. DPchcock, a retail grocer at So. M Twenty
second street, addressed a number of letters to
certain of his customers who bad fallen behind lo
their payments, the tenor of which was an urgent
invitation ta “walk up to the captain's office and
settle,” failing in which the accounts would be
placed in ILeTiands of a lawyer for collection.
Urc of the gentlemen thus addressed felt Insulted,
and determined on revenge. About 10 o’clock in
the evening, be repaired to the residence of Mr.
Dltchcock, who had retired for the night. That
gentleman partially dressed himself, and an*
ewered the summons. The visitor produced the
netc.and after some remarks on its “imperti
nent” character, be said be thought It his duty to
give the gender a good trashing. On seeing two
other gentlemen arrive in the ball, be, however,
thought better of it, and went out. but bad scarce
ly passed the door when he palled a large atone
from bis pocket and threw it at Mr. Hitchcock, in
flicting a wound on the temple, which would
have been serious had it not grazed rather than
struck the object of hi? wrath, lie was arrested,
and In the Police Court vesterday was held to
ball In the sum offaai. Tho prisoner has hither
to been known as a man of exemplary conduct, as
be Is roost respectably connected, and lu view of
this fact wc refrain from publishing the name of
the perpetrator of what cannot be characterized
other than as a dastardly outrage.

Kew York Dry Goods market*
KswYosk, December 4.
The Cvmmtrcial say* the dry goods market la very
qolct to-day. The holders of goods are still Arm la
their views, and notwithstanding the absence of hav
ers, there seems little prospect oi lower prices. Should
cotton decline, or Congtasa remova any part of the tax
on manufactures, or make any other change, a decline
will follow; but with the present steadiness In the mar
ket the prices are firm, as the margin of proflt above
coat ol production 1s very slight. . . „
In woollen goods there is a more steady feeling.
Blocks are diminishing under the stopping of milts,
and the market leels somewhat relieved. In cloths
and casstmares there is bnt little change, hut In some
makes cf woollens suitable to the soring trade the
market is more active, and llnseys and flannels are in
light stocks. Prints arc steady, with no change In
P There la an almost entire absence of bnslocu in for
eign goods to-day. The auction aslca are nearly or
, quite over, and Uie business Is in other branches of
the trade.
