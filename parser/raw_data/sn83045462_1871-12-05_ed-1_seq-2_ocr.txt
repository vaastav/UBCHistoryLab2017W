famished him by order of the President. The
< occlusion from this accrecy seemed irresistible
that llie >n.?iructions pven him and the money
turn is bed bim were for the purpose of getting
> i. Kolliti* out of office, for political purposes.
?ladge I'.iles ruled that the letter of Mr. Rol
lins was not pririlcfH from disclosure, as might
I avc be? r the ease if it had been a State Depart
ment or War Department secret; bnt that being
i roved. tlie plaintitt must also show tl*at the de
li nilaut acted with malice. The jury by their
verdict deco'ed that he acted without malice.
Iks Few ts. The Xaay.
On' of the provoking causes of the present
pgitaticn in England is the fact that the land*
of that country are held by a comparatively
smail number, who are thus created into a close
ar.stoei acy, poMetaing i>eculiar and extensive
privileges. It is estimated that out of ber im
mense population less than 3J>,000 persons are
o? ners of real estate, in even the smallest quan
t.ty, ?iiilc 1M> persons only are the possessors of
ov.e-balfof all the land in England and three
? owthsof Scotland. For instance, the Earl of
1' readaibaiie can ride on his own property 1?0
utiles fr? m his own house in a single direction.
" he I?uke of Sutherland own* the county of the
^ime name, reaching from sea to sea. The
Duke of Richmond holtfc possession of 340,000
acres at Gordon Castle and (roo<lwood, and the
Puke ot Devonshire 96,000 acres in the county
of Derby aione.
Of course, the natural tendency under this
state of things is a still further gravitation of real
estate into few hands. This is shown by the
fact that within the last two hundred years
more thin T.OOfl.oftO acres of land have been
absorbed by or added to estates already estab
lished; and the absorption is understood to be
going db now at a more rapid rate than ever
before.
Th*?e are si<rnitlcant facta, and should not
be overlooked by those now controling the
fntnrc- destinies of this country. At the rate at
v? hich the public lands of the I"nited States are
beinj voted awav. together with the progress
l-eirg maile in the concentration of the railroad*
ot the country into few hands, it will not be
long rntil we have a ruling class here more
g'*<?pin2 and oppress ve than the aristocracy
tri-m wl ich tbe peoj le of England are now
stnvii g to tree th* nisekes.
Wonlerful! the difference of opinion between
a :r tit mocratic and republican cotemporarie*
it- re tard to the me-*?age' The Patriot thinks it a
very poor mosage. It isn't long enough (!) It is
too curt- It fails to convey an intelligent view of
our national affairs, and so on. The l'*Uint
Ei.ii evidently sighs for the good old times when
a Presidential message Ailed from twelve to
cglitecn columns. In thosetimesa Victim once
tietincd it as the depth of human misery "to sit
on a cold grindstone and read the President's
message." The Pntrivt don't think so. If there
L> anything in the world it hankers after it i* a
good lon^ message.
The republican morning papers think the
message an excellent message. It is '-forcible,
wi?e. br?iT ess-like.*' &
We think the geneial verdict will be that it
is a sensible temperate doc-inv-nt, dealing at
si fficient length with the large number of sub
jects reft rrtd to. and properly suggesting that
matters ot particular moment will be dealt wit|>

Not withstanding the fre<inent and heavy rain
w >th ? bit h this locality has lately bee?i favored,
there is now n< arlv as much complaint of scar
city of water in the higher parts of the city as
?f;ir.ng the dry and dusty summer season. In
tletd. in s. me bonnes hardly enough can be se
cured during either day or night lor sanitary
ami i nlinrtry purposes. It must be, therefore,
cither ibat there is great waste of the preciou
fluid iti the lower parts of the city, or that our
l-opulation Las increased -o much that the ordi
nary ?upply is no longer anywhere near alte
rnate tor daily uses. It will be well, in either
<a*c. tor the water registrar to take early and
efficient strps to stop all leaks ami waste, as
those who are thus deprived are getting tired of
laying for what they do not get And, above
all things, kt th*-work of putting in that new
main be pushed forward with all possible haste.
1 nleMt something is accomplished in that direc
tum, 'here will be absolute suffering for w ant of
wateT in Washington next summer.

The California legislature met ve?t-r iav, and
tbe senatorial contest this week is likely to be
vi rt lively. The pmrainent aspirants are :?
nr.? o!e. Egerton, Estee. and Phelpa, and
their chm-es. according to a telegram from
Naerari! nto, -.rand in about the order ia trhich

A correspondent of the Cincinnati tinwlio
t! ate* h is letter from this city, opposes the re
elect* n of Mr. Sherman to the Senate because
he I*not a college graduate. Tins ia very thin.
And not a very good argument, either, to be
adtlres^ed to the legislature that has the electing
