THE PRESIOEM'S MESSAGE.
The last annual communication which
Mr. Buchanan will be called on to make
to Congress, lias just been transmitted.
We have no space this week to give the
document, but subjoin a few extracts from
that portion of it devoted to the present
crisis. The message commences with the
following passages :
" Throughout the year since our last
meeting, the country has been eminently
prosperous in all its material interests.
The general health has been excellent, our
harvests have been abundant, and plenty
smiles throughout the land. Our com
merce and manufactures have been prose
cuted with energy and industry, and have
yielded fair and ample returns. In
short, no nation in the 'tide of
time has ever presented a spectacle of
greater material ; prosperity than we have
done until a very recent period.
" Why is it, then, that discontent now
so extensively prevails, and tho union of
the States, which is the source of all these
blessings, is threatened with destruction ?
The long-continued and intemperate- inter
ference of tho Northern people with the
question of slavery in the Southern States
has at length produced its natural effects.
Tho different sections of the Union arc
now arrayed against each other, and the
time has arrived, so much dreaded by the
lather of his country, when hostile geo
graphical parties have been formed.
have long foreseen and often forewarned
my countrymen of the now impending
danger. Ihis docs not proceed solely
from the claim on the part of Congress or
tho Territorial Legislatures to exclude
slavery from the territories, nor from the
efforts of different States to defeat the ex-
ccution of the fugitive slave law. All or
any of these evils might have been en
dured by the South without danger to the
Union (as others have been) in the. hope
that time and reflection might apply the
remedy. Tho immediate peril arises not
so much from these causes as from the fact
that the incessant and violent agitation
of the slavery question throughout the
North, for the last quarter of a century
has at length produced its malign influ
ence on the slaves, and inspired them with
vague notions of freedom."
After continuing this rehash of the
common clamor about the wrongs which
the South receive from the North, ho pro
ceeds thus :
" And this brings me to observe that
the election of any one of our fellow citi
zens to the office of President does not itself
afford just cause for dissolving the Union.
This is more especially true if his election
has been effected by a mcro plurality and
not a majority, of the people, and has re
sulted from transient and temporary caus
es, which may probably never again oc
cur. In order to justify a resort to revo
lutionary resistance, the federal govern
ment must bo guilty of a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous exercise of pow
ers not granted by the constitution. The
late residential election, however, has
been held in strict conformity with its
express provisions. How, then, can the
result justify a revolution to destroy this
very constitution? Reason, justice, a re
gard for the constitution, all require that
we should wait for somo overt and danger
ous act on the part of tho President, be
fore resorting to such a remedy."
The President then goes on to enumer
ate the specific grievances of which the
secessionists complain, and while virtually
admitting that these would justify seces
sion in case that they had actually been
perpetrated, insists that the only viola
tion of tho rights of the South which has
yet occurred, id the passage by tho Terri
torial Legislature of Kansas, of an act
abolishing slavery in that Territory ; but
he insists that the courts will nullify that
act, arguing upon the Dred Scott decision
that such an act can give no good reason
for a dissolution of tho Union, and thus
proceeds j '- "
" The most palpable violations of con
stitutional duty which have yet been com
mitted consist in the acts of different
State Legislatures to defeat tho execution
of tho Fugitive Slave law. It ought to
be remembered, However that for these
acts neither Congress nor 'any President
can justly bo held responsible, Having
been passed in violation of tho federal
constitution, they are, therefore, null and
void. All the courts, both State and
national, beforo whom tho question has
arisen, has from the beginning declared
the Fugitive Slave law to be constitutional.
Tho single exception is that of a. ' State
court in Wisconsin, and this has not only
been reversed by the proper appellate tii
bunal, but has met with such universa
reprobations that there can be no danger
from it as precedent The validity of
this law has been established over and
over again by the Supremo Court of the
United States with perfect impunity. It
is founded upon an express provision of
the constitution, requiring that fugitive
slaves who escape from service in one
Stato to another shall bo " delivered up
to their masters. Without this provision
it is a well known historical fact that the
constitution itself could never have been
adopted by the Convention.
" In one form or other under the acts
of 1793 and 1850, both being substan.
tially the same, the Fugitive Slave law
has been the law of the land from the
days of Washington until the present
moment. Here, then, a clear case is pre
sented, in which it will be the duty of the
next President, as it has been my own, to
act with vigor in executing the supreme
law against the conflicting enactments of
State Legislatures. Should he fail in the
performance of his high duty, he will then
have manifested a disragard of the Con
stitution and laws, to the great injury of
the people of nearly one-half the States
of the Union. Hut are we to presume in
advance that he will thus violate his duty ?
This would be at war with every princi
pie .of justice and of Christian charity.
Let us wait for the overt act. The fugi
. i i in t ,
tivc slave law nas Dcen carried into exe
cution in every contested case since the
commencement of the present administra
tion ; though often, it is to be regretted,
with great loss and inconvenience to the
master, aucl with considerable expense to
the government. Let us trust that the
State Legislatures will repeal their uncon
stitutional and obnoxious enactments.
Unless this shall be done without unnee
essary delay, it is impossible for any hu
man power to save the Union.
" The Southern States, standing on the
basis of the constitution, have a right to
demand this act of justice from the States
of the North. Should it be refused, then
the constitution, to which all the States
are parties, will have been virtually vio
lated by one portion of them in a provis
ion essential to the domestic security and
happiness of the remainder. In that
event, the injured States, after having first
used all peaceful and constitutional means
to obtain redress, would be justified in
revolutionary resistance to the government
of the Union."
Tho President thon goes into a lengthy
argument of the constitutional right of
secession, treating the matter very much
as he would argue such a question in court,
making such an argument as any common
lawyer is capable of producing, and after
admitting that tho seceding States have
the right to resist tho General Govern
ment, and stating that such resistance may
or may not be justifiable revolution, he
arrives at the following very extraordinary
result :
What in the meantime, is the respon
sibility and true position of the Execu
tive? Ho is bound by solemn oath before
God and the country " to take care that
the laws bo faithfully executed," and
from this obligation he cannot be absolved
by any human power. But what if the
performance of this duty, in whole or in
part, has been rendered inpracticable by
events over which he could have exercised
no control ? Such, at the present moment,
is the case throughout tho Stato of South
Carolina, so far as the laws of the United
States to secure the administration of jus
tice by means of the Federal Judiciary
arc concerned. All tne federal oiuccrs
within its limits, through whose agenoy
alono these laws can bo carriod into exe
cution, have already resigned. We no
longer have a District Judgo, a District
Attorney, or a Marshal in South Carolina.
In fact, the whole machinery of tho Fed
eral Government, necessary for the dis
tribution of remedial justice among the
people, has been demolished ; and it would
bo difficult, if not impossible, to replace
it. , .,
"The only acts of Congress on tho
statute book bearing upon this subject,
are thoso of the 28th of February, 1795,
and 3d March, 1807. These authorize
the President, after, he shall have ascer
tained that tho Marshal, with his posse
comitatus, is unable to execute civil or
criminal process in any particular case,
to call forth the militia and employ the
army and navy to aid him in performing
this service, having first by proclamation
commanded tho insurgents " to disperse
and retire peaceably to their respective
abodes, within a limited time." This duty
cannot by possibility bo performed in a
Stato where no judicial authority exists
to issue process, and where there is no
Marshal to execute it, and where,, even if
there were such an oiheer, the entire pop
ulation would constitute one solid conibi
nation to resist him.
" Ihe bare enumeration of these pro
visions proves how inadequate they are
without further legislation to overcome a
united opposition in a single State, not
to speak of other States who may place
themselves in a similar attitude, Congress
alone has power to decide whether the
present laws can or cannot be amended
so as to carry out more effectually the
objects of the constitution.
" The same insuperable obstacles do not
lie in the way of executing the laws for
the collection of the Customs. The rev
enue still continues to bo collected, as
heretofore, at the Custom House in Charles
ton ; and should the collector unfortunate
ly resign, a successor may be appointed
to perform this duty.
" Then, in regard to the property of the
United States in South Carolina. This
has been purchased for a fair equivalent,
" by the consent of the Legislature of the
State," " for the creation of forts, mag
azines arsenals," &&, and over tlisc tic
authority " to exercise exclusive legisla
tion" has been expressly granted by the
Constitution - to Congress. It is no be
lieved that any attempt will be mate to
expel the United States from this property
by force; but if in this I should pmc to
be mistaken, the officer in command of the
forts has received orders to act striclly on
tho defensive. In such a contingency,
the responsibility for consequences ould
rightfully rest upon the heads ofj the
assailants."
The President then, apparently unmind
ful of tho course he took when he sent an
army to coerce the people of Kansas; and
forcibly prevent the city of Lawrence
from watering their streets under an or
dinance of their city government, pro
ceeds to discuss his authority to cocko the
seceding States, and insists that lie has
no power to use force in reclaiming them ;
and although he makes no specific men
tion of that particular result, the tenor of
his argument would indicate that tho
President has no right to enforce the laws
of the United States, when there is any
objection to such enforcement.
He then most humbly and most meekly
entreats and beseeches the Southern States
not to use force against the General Gov
ernment. Then, as if somewhat relieved, he goes
on to suggest a compromise or settlement,
by amendments to the constitution. He
goes on to recite the way in which the
Constitution provides for its own amend
ment, and then says :
' This is the very course which I ear
nestly recommend in order to obtain an
'explanatory amendment' of tho Consti
tution on the subject of slavery. This
might originate with Congress, or the
State Legislatures, as may be deemed most
advisable to obtain the object.
" This explanatory amendment might be
confined to the final settlement of the true
construction of the Constitution on three
special points :
1. An express recognition of the
right of property in slaves in the States
where it now exists or may hereafter ex
ist. " 2. The duty of protecting this right
in all the common Territories throughout
their territorial existence, and until they
shall be admitted as States into the Union,
with or without slavery.
3. A liko recognition of the right of
the master to have his slave, who has es
caped from ono State to another, restored
and ' delivered up ' to him, and of tho va-
idity of tho fugitive slave law enacted
for this purpose, together with a declara
tion that all Stato laws impairing or de
feating this right are violations of the
Constitution, and are consequently null
and void.
' It may bo objected that this construc
tion has already been settled by the Su
preme Court of tho United States, and
what more ought to . bo required? The
answer is, that a very largo proportion of
the peoplo of the United States still con
test the correctness of this decision, and
never will cease from agitation and admit
its binding force until clearly established
by the people of tho sevcrtd States in their
sovereign character. Such an explanatory
amendment would, it is believed, forever
terminate tho existing dissensions, and
restore peace and harmony among tho
States. ' '
" It ought not to be doubted that such
an appeal to tho arbitrament established
by tho constitution itself would bo re
ceived with favor by all the States of the
confederacy. In any event it ought to be
tried in a spirit of conciliation before any
of these States shall separate themselves
from tho Union."
And with this proposition ho closes
that part of the message devoted to seces
sion. He gives in another place another
argument to justify his course on the Lc
compton constitution, which wo have not
space to comment on at this time.
Taken altogether, this last message of
tho " Old Public Functionary " must be
considered tho most extraordinary docu
ment ever promulgated by tho Executive
of a great nation.
When one of tho States of tho Union
is, according to his own statement, at
tempting a revolution, he stops to palliate
their action, and state over their excuses,
While it is his duty to preserve the digni
to of the nation and a respect for its au
thority, he, instead of enforcing the laws,
demeans himself and the nation by dis
graceful supplication and entreaty. When
before did the world ever see the Execu
tive of a great nation so low as to beseech
a rebellious portion of the nation to cease
rebellion ? This is worse than tho course
of Peter Stuyvcrsaut, who conducted war
by proclamations, for the President's mes
sage has not even the pitiful spirit to re
sist treason even on paper.
And then his propositions for pacifica
tion. These questions have just been sub.
mittcd to the people of the United States,
and not one-fourth part arc willing to es
tablish any such doctrines. Mr. Buchanan
having seen the effort to enforce these very
doctrines dismember the Democratic party,
and drive off two-thirds of it from the
support of tho Administration, must have
high notions that such a course will
cement the Union of tho States.
If secession is to prevail, and tho Union
to be dismembered, it is'very much to be
regretted that this great and prosperous
nation can mako no better adieu to the
world than this last message of its last
President.
When Itichard Baxter died, his last
words of wisdom and piety were eagerly
canght up and published ; and these were
publications eagerly sought after, entitled
More of the last words of Mr. Baxter;"
but we trust in God we never shall Jiave
any more of tho last words of Mr.
Buchanan.

The Secession Movement.
In the South Carolina Legislature, on
Tuesday of last week, the Joint Commit
tee of the Senate and House reported that
it was inexpedient to attempt, at this time,
the reorganization of the militia system,
but recommended tho passage of a bill
which gives the Governor power to call
out any part or the whole of the military
force of the State at any time he may con
sider it necessary.
A dispatch from Norfolk, Va., says a
paper is being mysteriously circulated
there, pledging the signers " to be ready,
at a moment's warning, to start for a given
point Richmond, as I understand and
there join a force of chosen men who arc
to battle in the front ranks in defense of
Southern rights. It is supposed that a
similar movement is on foot in every part
of the State. It is surmised that this
picked force will visit Washington the day
of the inauguration.
Tbe message of Gov. Tcttus to the Mis
sissippi Legislature, convened to take ac
tion on the present political crisis, takes
bold ground for resistance and secession.
He thinks the liVcs, liberty and property
of the people of Mississippi cannot be in
trusted to tho sectional majority which
has now come into power, for the following
reasons, which he describes as " a long cat
alogue of insults and injuries: "
" They havo exhibited a low selfishness
in seizing all the Territories, which arc the
common property of all the States. They
have deliberately attempted and have suc
ceeded in educating a generation to' hate
tho South. They have sworn to support
tho Federal Constitution, and deliberately
passed laws with the palpable intent to
violate one of the plainest provisions of
that compact. They have sent large suras
of money to Congress for tho purposes of
bribing the members of that body to pass
laws to advance their private interests.
They have attempted to degrade us in tho
estimation of other nations by denouncing
us as barbarians, pirates and robbers, un
fit associates for Christian or civilized man.
They have excited our slaves to insurrec
tion, advised them to burn our property,
murder our peoplo, and have furnished
them with arms and ammunition to aid
them in their bloody work. They have
murdered Southern mou in the lawful pur
suit of their fugitive slave, and failed to
punish their citizens for these flagrant vio
lations of the laws of God and man. They
have furnished money and arms for tho
invasion of 4 a slaveholding State, and
when the puuishmcut awarded to treason
and murder by all civilized nations over
took the invaders, they threatened tho
dastardly revenge of midnight incendia
ries, tolled bells in honor of traitors, and
murderers, and reward the family of tho
chief traitor as never was rewarded that of
any soldier who fell in defense of the coun
try, and held him up as an cxamplo of he
roic devotion to a just and glorious cause.
Their press, pulpit, lecturo room and
forum, teem daily and nightly with exhori.
tations to thoir people to press furwurd
this war on our institutions even to tho
drenching of Southern fields with the blood
of lier citizens."
Ho then argues at great length the right
of a Stato to secede, and recomeuds tho
calling of a convention at an early day,
the appointment of commissioners to visit
tho other Southern States, and appropri
ation for the aid of tho military compa
nies, i . ;' -
