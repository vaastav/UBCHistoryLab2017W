Is the tree eaase of money troubles, at least in

en Matured by the Governor are powerlets,
aad that tha Governor and hia political mmciatM
are all poworfal la tho State, and have
tho oatire iaanaf?moBt of tho money and
credit of tho State, tho bodhbm of tho charge
will appear at once. If the State oBelala had
only deelred all thlo time to take care of the in*
tereat of tho people, and to cconomioe the ex*
penaea of the State inatead of making million*
for themselves, all the fault finding in the
world would hare hurt hat little. Whan a en
utterly deatltnte of money, and with very little
character come here from distant States and
(at all the offices by cheating the Mack population
into their support, and at the end ?
two or three years are found investing funds
by the fifty thousands aad the hundred thou*
aand dollars in houses and lands, and stocks^
away out of the State of South Carolina, and
where these same officials are in the aggregate
reported to be worth millions of dollars, wheref
they ware not worth as many cents, on com*
ing here, there seems to be some reason for
saying that tha Governor is slightly mistaken
In attributing the had lnck of the State Treasury
to honest patriots, who had nq power to
control anything, and who only hare exercised
the poor privilege of complaining ot their
treatment. We saw the gamn of plundering
the State Treasury commenced early by our
present rulers, where they hoodwinked the'
Legsilature, we will not say bribed, to throw
away at least one million of dollars by passing
a law to give six per cent, gold paying bonds
to take up the bills of the banx of the State,
which was a corporation that bad no right to
require the 8tate to redeem its bills, and no
attempt to do so had been made or seriously
thought of by the Legislature which preceded
8cott's Legislature. By looking at these
figures of the Governor, we see one debt of
twelve hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
created on this account. Every body now
knows that this measure was not thought of
for the good of the State, or the honor of the
State, but to give away the public money to
a " ring." And so the issuing of bonds, and
the printing of twenty-two million of dollars
worth, oonfessedly nine millions-more than
the law directed. What is it all fer?
It requires neither tedious argument, nor
much calculation, to show where the blame
lies. The State debt has been manipulated
and doctored, and the State officials havs turn*
ed.ovcr bonds, pledged them, and got money.
Somehow, so it is, they have managed to
bring up the State debt from five or si* to fit
teen million of dollars, according to the beat
citimates tbat seem to be made, in the meantime,
baring levied and handled some millions
of taxes which aro all gone, and the Treasury
empty. When we see a few millions sticking
out of their pockets, and many thousands of
dollars worth of stocks and real estate in New
York and Ohio and elsewhere, purchased by
some of them, coating five times their ralaries
we bare no need of a search warrant to find
out where the State money has gone, and how
it is tbat the people must be burdened with
taxes, and threatened with still heavier. Just
Heaven ! is it not too mueh that seven hundred
thousand people in South Carolina should
have these fraudulent burdsns imposed upon
themselves and posterity, to make rich a few
such men as these officials ? And yet, they
are the men, and our native people, white and
black, must stand aside for them, and go and
work and make money, and pay interest on
their bonds. We are all made the bond-ser ants
of these half dozen or dozen masters
and their overseers. We do not believe that
the people of this State, black or white, are
(uiu| iu hmu iuu ium(, om ion mey win repudiate
theie men and tbeie bond*. All the
people hare to do hereafter, :* not to vote tor
them, or rote taxes to pay their little bill*;
they bare had their aalariea and ought to be
satisfied with tunning the State finances for
the preaent, and not desire to perpetuate these
burdens for a generation to come, which would
be the ease if the people are foolish enough to
boulder the debts they loare behind them. It
ia their debt, not the people's, for the peoplo
bare got nothing for it.

Daring the day the clouds gave unmistakable
signs of giving as a repetition of the

snow began again to fall rapidly, in a short
time covering the earth, and by night was
several inches deep j the snow continuing to

From Friday noon until the following Monday

aa to r?|rtt his own eouosela in favor of
minority repraaentation, oa account of the
hatred ha bears to the white people of this
Stale who have unfortunately, aahi something
ugly at ont the woety matters in which
he la concerned. The Governor quotes ?n?r
tain things from a few newspapers, ta which
some rough language la us?d towards his
party, and therefore he feels justified in
withholding simple justice from all the men,
women and children and their posterity in
Ibis Slate. who are nul ?f ? - I
- ?r-1 "J
The IodUn savages ?how just the same political
wisdom. If one drunken white man
ahould flight and kill one drunken Indian,
the Indiana make war on all the white raee
of the United States. So Governor Scott
would droj the entire minority of the StatS(
the whole white population in many countiee,
of all repreaeotatioo or ehanee of appearing

the editor of the Charleston jVVtee or

and all the people who are in minorities in
every county in the State, whatever their
characters, er merits, or claim* to have a
little part to do In governing ''lemeelves ;
those all must suffer eternal exclusion from
the Legislature, and humbly submit to his
bonds, hand-cuffed, and soul cuffed if he
could. The long and the shoit of this is all
easily seen. Men who grow suddenly rich
in oflce, and as suddenly biing the Stato to
bankruptcy "do not wish to see any minority
in the Legislature, whom they think
neither humbuggery er bribery will silence
into the support of their Utile scheme* of
bonds, and financial agencies, etc. Now it
seems to us the Governor will be disappointed
in his desTe of kindling up such a
party feeling an-ij smoke as to smother all
attempts to look into bis bonds and his cere
of the public treasury. We hardly think
any member.of the Republican party, who
nas any lionest purpose for being a Republican,
will be fool enough to belive that
there is any party g?ln or advantage in upholding
tha-1 plunderers of the pnbl<? treasury,
and imposing of millions of debt on
the peoples back. No I Republicans ;in
this State and all over the United Stales,
abhor such conduct and cell on Republicans
here and everywhere not to sustain any man
guilty of it. The Governor insults his own
party by supposing they will make fraud
a party question.

Immediately there was a great rush to tbo t

giren way whilst work was going on with tho
ce ling over the court room. Mr. Carpenter
wot somewhat injured, and a young man hy
name of Milton Qooplocb had threo ribs
broken. The men were on the scaffolding
when it fell, and it is a great wonder that
no lives were lost. Some colored boys were
underneath the framework when it started,
but noticed it coming and flod into the jury
room. Had they remained a second longer,
they would have boon crushed to a jelly.

The City of Charleston has been sorely afs
flictcd. The sickness has been more general
than reported, but not more fatal. 212yelto? fever
deaths Is tho whole number. But then, tbero
woro thrco fevers hero at onco?tho yellow
fever, the malarial fever and tho broken bono
fover?and wholo multitudes were sick, but
few comparatively died. Tho physicians say
that yellow fever is from animal putrefaction >
tho malarial fever is from vegetable putrefaction
; and broken bone fever from cold. Tho
treatment of each was verv different?Calo
aaol for the first ; quinine for the second ; and
lot drinks lor the third. It has been a torrii>lu
blow to the City, amd it will bo long before
t fully recovers.
The new City Council Is very popular, aud
10 far have been very cautious and judicious
n their course. It is thought the interest on
he City debt will be paid in full in January,
icxt, and the City stock has advanced in conicqucnce.
The City is on the whole, progros
five, and soon will be very prosperous. There
s a new spirit among the people, and much
sntcrpriso and industry, and the City and
State are neither so far gone as politicians, fur
fftcA, represent.
There is a bright future for our people, they
need encouragement. The climate, the soil,
the capital, the intelligence and virtue of our
people will yet solve the problem. Our troubles
are temporary, our advantages permanent.
We are like a sick man recovering
from disease nervous, petulant and disheartened,
but soon all will be changed.
The churches hero arc all again opened and
well attended. I preached on Sunday morning
in Bethel Methodist Church, and nt night
in Spring Street Methodist Church to large
and attentive audiences.
I hope to bo back on 8th December, and in
