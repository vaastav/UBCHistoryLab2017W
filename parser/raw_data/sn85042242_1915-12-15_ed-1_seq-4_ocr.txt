CONFUSING ISSUES.
Senator Lodge, replying :o Senator
Smith's demand that the negotiations
of this government to terminate Brit­
ish interference with the trade of
neutrals, while touching, was not ger­
mane to the discussion.
He solemnly declared: "The body
of an innocent child floating dead in
the water is to me a more poignant
and a more tragic spectacle than an
unsold bale of cotton."
Probably everyone in the Senate,,
including Hoke Smith, feels tbe same
•way. Just why Senator Lodge sought
to confuse the issues was not appar­
ent, but his attitude merely empha­
sizes the fact that there is a tendency
to overlook our trade rights whi'
demanding strict accountability
where an infringement of the laws of
humanity are concerned.
Great iBritain has been sicillful in
arousing public sentiment in United
States by clever appeals ro our sym­
pathies. It is not a question of plac­
ing dollars above lives.' There is no
reason why this nation cannot trea:
violations of international laws af­
fecting human rights on the high sea3
without compromising or abating our
stand on trade regulations.
The two issues should not be con­
fused or joined. (Both should be en­
forced with equal firmness. The tend
ency of the Wilson admmistration to
procrastinate when British violations
of international law are concerned .*3
becoming a matter of serious com­
ment in the press and Congress,
where Democratic leaders have al­
ready taken their chief to TasK.
William E'ayard Hale nas just is­
sued a booklet, entitled: "Americas
Rights and British Preventions,'
wliich sums up the situation from a
purely American viewpoint. We quote
his foreword, because it presents forc­
ibly the arrogant attitude 'England
has assumed in the treatment of our
commerce upon the hign seas:
"The government of Great Britain
has virtually set up in the midst of
the busy seas an arbitrary court,
claiming unheard of powers and exer­
cising the most tyrannous police func
tions seizing and haling into the
dock as suapects all travelers upon
the ocean highways, and visiting
many of them with heavy penalties
for unproven and, indeed, unprovable
offenses. This lawless assizes of the
seas, contemptuous alike of its own
precedents and of the rights of oth
er8, scarcely stoops to tue pretense
of citing authority tor Jts acttons
which are determined solely by its
'brutal will, and enforced, though, in
deed, largely through intimidation, by
the gigantic power of its naval police.
The extent of the earth's surface
over which t-iis extraordinary cour*
la permitted to wield its self-arrogat­
ed jurisdiction, the magnitude of the
interests which its actions vitally af­
fect. and the supineness with which
sovereign states submit to tlie erec-
tion upon the ruins of their self-re­
spect and the debacle or their high­
est commercial and political inter­
ests, of an island'3 municipal statutes
into international formulas, unite to
render this one of the spectacles of
history."
Conditions '.iave not. changed much
since Thomas Jefferson wrote to 'Bar
onne de Stael Holstein in 1813, in
part, as follows:
"England is in principle the enemy
of all maritime nations. The object
of England is the permanent domin­
ion of the ocean, and the monopoly of
the trade of the world. Then came
"ier paper blockades, T)y which she
might shut up the whole world with­
out sending a ship to sea except to
take all those sailing on it, as they
must, of course, 'he hound to some
port. And these were "ollowed :jy
her orders of connctt, rorbiddlng
every nation to go to I he port, of an­
other without coming first to some
port of GTeat. Britain."
Surely the tactics of il'813 are being
duplicated in Ml5. However serious
the breaches of the Central Powers
against international law, they should
not blind us to the infractions of the
Allies.
Wilson won't, stand for a palched
up peace neither will 'Congress swal­
low the administration's patclied-up
excuses.
PIVOTAL STATE.
Political writers delight, to declare
the first state which declares its pres­
idential preference as the "pivotal
state." The expression has been usee
so often as to become platitudinous
and trite, as well as Gecltieuly Irrele­
vant and immaterial when used in
such a connection.
'North Dakota four years ago was
the first state to express a pres cen
tial choice. Everyone knows how
"pivotal that action was. It had nc
effect upon subsequent events except
at Chicago North Dakota assisted in
preventing the organization of tne
convention from falling jnto the hands
of the Roosevelt managers. Had Wis­
consin and 'North Dakota swung to
MtiGovern, the story of the Chicago
battle might have been different.
But there was nothing "pivotal"
about North Dakota's choice. It is
hardly likely that {Minnesota's presi­
dential preference, the flrst to be ex­
pressed, will be "pivotal" in its influ­
ence. Should Cummins win in the
primaries of the North Star state, it
may give his candidacy considerable
momentum in the Northwestern
states, chiefly Wisconsin, INorth and
South Dakota and iMonuina.
(Probably, that is what the Twin
City political scribes mean when they
speak of .Minnesota as a pivotal state.
Too much emphasis is placed upon
the choice of the flrst few states. The
Republican presidential candidate will
not be selected through primaries, de
spite the fact that many states will
use this medium of selecting and in­
structing their delegates to the na­
tional convention. Most of the prim­
aries doubtless will result in a use­
less and somewhat perfunctory en
dorsement of "favorite son" candi
dates, so that when the delegates as
semble next June or July they will be
as far from a binding decision as
though the presidential primaries had
never been held.
{Minnesota's decision early next
March, will be but one political straw
to denote the drift of sentiment. The
failure of Cummins to secure the en­
dorsement will eliminate him as
possibility his success, however, will
be of only passing political signifi­
cance. Minnesota politicians behind
him do not look upon the Iowa sena
tor .13 a winner, but they nope to se­
cure a Cummins delegation so as to
control the selection of the national
committeeman and to a large degree
the organization of the state commit­
tee. That, if the truth were told- is
the chief significance of the Minne
sota Cummins movement.
-INSTRUCTIVE MONOGRAPH.
'Believing that the development of
a sound national shipping policy 13
rendered difficult by the general lack
of knowledge of the fundamentals of
ocean transportation, the 'National
Foreign Trade Council has published
a monograph, entitled. "Ocean Ship­
ping." It is a simple presentation of
the basic principles of marine trans
portation with particular reference to
the foreign trade of the United States,
lit is expository and non-argumenta
tive in tone. It compactly presents
information from many sources cover
ing aspects of ocean shipping as an
industry which has been shown in the
discussions of the past year to be
little understood in this country. The
question is treated from the stand
point of normal conditions rather
than those of the present war, it be
ing recognized that the upbuilding
an American merchant marine will
be a long task affected by the keen
shipping competition of peace rather
than the "boom" characteristics ol
war.
PARTY I

Criticize His Message and Say
He Is Reactionary in His Rec-
comendations.
!S. S. Oscar II., Radio, via Cape
Race, Dec. 1:4.—At a mass meeting
held aboard Henry 'Ford's peace ship,
Tuesday evening, 'December 7, S. S.
McCltire, the eminent magazine pus
Usher and publicist, read important
extracts from 'President Wilson's
message, an advanced copy of which
Mr. iM!Clure had obtained aefore sail­
ing. After the readings, Mr. Ellis O.
Jone3, one of the delegates, spoKe as
follows:
I certainly do not believe this mes­
sage should be received in silence by
this assemblage. This is a reaction­
ary message this message comes to
us at a time when we cannot keep
silent we must speak out we are
going abroad now, on a mission to
stop a terrible war among nations,
every one of which is prepared in a
military way—prepared for war. Tnrs
is no time to disturb American tra­
ditions and prepare us for war, a
member of this delegation said to­
night, that, preparation in the mili­
tary sense is only a century old, but
that is not correct. Preparation in
the military sense is many centuries
old, the ancient histories are full o»
it preparation in a peace sense, how­
ever, preparation in a civil sense is
not so old. I call your attention ?o
the preparation for peace, tliat now
exists in the United States and 'Can­
ada. Where there are no forts, where
(here are no soldiers, where there are
no trenches or guns, that is prepara
tiort for peace, and that is about a
century old. A preparation for peace
exists between Norway and Sweden.
There is no fort between their fron­
tiers, and that is the kind of prepara­
tion we need now. America is in dan­
ger, but of what is she in danger?
The president does not say in his
message of what America is in dan­
ger. At this time the president, does
not mention a single nation that, he
dares to say is an enemy of the Unit-'
ed 'States of America, but the United
States of America is in danger none
the less, it is in danger of enemies
from within and they are not natural­
ized enemies either they are the
men who are building battleships at
tremendous profits men who are try­
ing now to add to the burden of taxa­
tion of the United States of America
and to mortgage posterity for years
to come. To fasten this dreadful mil­
itary burden upon us, they are telling
us that we want to Chinafy America,
that we are all mollycoddles. It may
be true, that every mollycoddle is a
pacifist, but it is not true that every
pacifist is a mollycoddle, and this we
are' going to show President Wilson
and the armament trusts of t'.ie Unit­
ed States of America, before we are
through. (Applause.) It is not true,
perhaps, that everyone who favors
preparedness in the United States is
a grafter, but nothing can be truer
than that every grafter in the Unit­
ed iStates is in favor of preparedness
every corporation lawyer in the Unit­
ed States is in favor of preparedness.
Joseph H. Choate, the other day, had
the superlative impertinence to say
that he had considered this matter,
that he had gotten the facts from mil­
itary authorities and had found that
America was not prepared in any sin­
gle respect or in any particular. Was
ever there a more absurd statement
made by any man than this one, from
a great international lawyer? Amer
ica is prepared now, if you want a
military preparedness it is very sim­
ple. These men do not want a mili-

If we want to prepare ourselves, it is

in no uncertain terms about this mes­

said, "for national efficiency and se­

best energies ,to-the making of mur­

OEMS PLAN CAHPAKiN
FOBm PRIMARY
INorth Dakow democrats, when they
meet in Grand Forks on Wednesday,
December. 15,'vfojf :$ie first campaign
meeting of tTO^itafe central commit­
tee, will outline pjann ror the presf
dential campajgn.
Just now, there is nobody being
talked of among the democrats of
this state for president outside of
Wilson, the supporters of the presi­
dent being satisfied that no formida­
ble opposition will arise in this state.
Petitions to place Wilson's name on
the presidential primary ballot for
the 'March election probably will be
placed in circulation very shortly ar
ter the committee meets.
Committeeman Race.
Jt is also expected that there will
be some developments here as to the
race for democratic committeeman.
It has not yet been announced wheth­
er John BrueggSf%ttie present nation­
al committeeman, will be a candidate
for re-election.The bitterness of the
-C.'
last committeeman race in the dem­
ocratic party makes it certain that
the position will be contested with
equal intensity during the approach­
ing election.
The business before tile nemiSi^ratic
central committee is varied. It is the'
first session the committee has held
for some time, and with the rapid ap­
proach of the new campaign there
are many problems, particularly that
of finances, for consideration.
Already numerous candidates for
atate and national offices are being
put forth. John Bruegger is being
groomed toy some as a candidate for
congress in the Third district Mat
vor Halvorson of Minot is being put
forward as a candidate for congress.
Alfred iPeterson of Stanley, who is
here as a juror of the federal court,
is-a (Halvorson booster.
WELSH SINGERS HERE.
The Royal Welsh Male Quartet of
iXewport, South Wales wa3 greeted
with a fine audience in the Bismarck
Presbyterian church, when t.'iey ap­
peared in concert here last evening.
Seldom have entertainers been given
a greater ovation than was the fam­
ous quartet of Lusitania fame. Their
program covered a wide range or
numbers, including many of the. class­
ics and the old favorite songs. 'Each
member of the quartet was a finished
artist and gave to their auditors a
splendid entertainment of songs.
A feature of the concert was a
graphic description of the sinking or
the iLusitania by Risca Williams, who
was rescued after being several hours
in the water. Mr, Williams gave a
very careful review of the terrible
disaster, in which three of his com­
panions lost their lives.

It is a mystery story of far more than

Minneapolis Boy Looks as if He
Will Show Local Man What
Wrestling Is.
Frank Mattson of Minneapolis, ar­
rived in the city yesterday for his
wrestling match with Joe Novak at
the Grand theater tonight. Mattson
is the cleanest cut and most likely
looking wrestler who has been seen in
the capital city in a long time.
He has littlel to say in regard to
the match tonight, but thinks that he
will be able to pin Novak to the mat
the required two times, to win the
gate receipts.
Mattson states that he has tried to
get a match with Novak any number
of times, but the local man always
managed to have some "previous en­
gagement." Novak's last stall was
that Mattson had. a reputation for
rough dirty work, and he did not care
to meet him. 'From outward appear­
ances, Mattson looks like the last
man on earth who would start any
dirty tactics^ and ho says such charg­
es are entirely without'"foundation, as
lie lifts never been disqualified from a
match since he entered the wrestling
game.
Novak agreed to make ISO pounds
fc-r the match tonight, but it is not be­
lieved lie is down to that weight.
Mattson stated last night that while
any additional weight would be a
handicap, he was confident he would
win the match. Novak is equally con­
fident, and is going in to win, as he
fully realizes that it is his last
cl&nce to make good with Bismarck
wrestling fans.
A good seat sale has been reported,
and -the fans are looking forward to a
good match. The preliminary to the
