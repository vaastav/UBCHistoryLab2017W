'litis titno tho President's mossnge is
dryer than a Inst year's almanac. Tor
the most part it is a more summary of ^
departmental reports. It contains no (
striking thoughts and no important recommendations,
except to urge Contress
to pas* tho "Wilson tariff bill.
This 'latter con hardly bo called im- f
portant, becauao it has been expected
as in the lino of what was understood to ^
bo tho administration policy. 'Jlio ad- '
miniitration was acquainted with tho
bill in all it? derails before tho country
aw it, and it cx;xno to tho country as an
administration measure.
There is littlo about Hawaii except a {
promise to discuss tho Eubject in a
special message. From this it is to be !
inferred that tho President desires to
hear from Minister Willis beforo ho j.
opens up tho battle with Congress, liis
plans have miscarried, and beforo he
discusses tho Hawaiian situation he desires
to know just what it is. lit* makes
plain, however, that he sent Minister
Willis to restoro tho queon. ?j
There aro some sensational remarks .1
about cabbatro seed, but tho country la
will hardly become wildly excited on
this subject. There is an absence of tho
phraee-makinc which has marked most
of Mj. Cleveland's public writings. s)
Tho wholo document conveys the irn- P
prossion that it was put together by a
man who was tired while ho was doing 1,1
it Naturally tho kooncst interest is
shown on tho tariff question. to
President Cleveland wants the wage- n
earners of this country to bo better fl
housed, lietter clothod and better fed. ,,
If ho wfll give thetn a chanco to get back fr
where they were beioro ho and his party u
jot into power tho wuge-earnera will be n,
glad to lookout for themselves.
A Discredited Policy.
Two ?ocrotario3 of tho treasury under ol
Mr. Cleveland in his first terra, .Mr.
Manning and Mr. Fairchild. doclared t!
strongly acainat ad valorem duties and ci
in favor of specific duties as opening tho ei
way to defraud the treasury. Chairman tl
"Wilson declaros in favor oi ad valorem c<
duties aud President Cleveland endorses cl
liim. tc
Tho McKinley tariff act makes uso of m
both kinds oi duties, and while it has i:
not caught tho importer every time it it
hnn mailn it harder for him to ovado th? i
customs duties and to rob tho American m
producer of tho measure of protection
which Congress intended ho should
have. 01
P<
The Van Alen Biifinoss. w
Stang by the criticisms of his appoint- w
ment as ambassador to Italy, Mr. J. J. \\
Van Alen gives up the job. Tho Presi- n
dent did not feel tho disgrace ot the U)
thing, and having started in 0:1 tho tit
wrong road, insisted that Mr. Van Alen
should travel with him.
In spito of tho President's urgent ap- *n
peal Mr. Van Alen decliued to 1:0 to hid
post. Ho deserves credit for accepting
the first opportunity to do his country- c''
mon a service.
Mr. Van Alon shows to vory much
bettor advantage than tho President,
Who has not appreciated the gross iui- jr,
propriety of selling a diplomatic place. jH
Mr. Van Alen has riven him something ?>
to think about. Tho public has given ^
liim more.
Prksipknt Ci.evei.anp lira's Congress *r
to make hasto to invite more imported
wares into the Americau market, so as ea
to givo more employment and more fi|
wages to tho Americans who mako the do
same kinds of commodities, when they th
have the chance. This is statosmar- 0f
ship?of its kind.
A Volco From Knglutul.
"While tho President and his party t|,
are doing what they can to fasten on j?
this countrr tho British taritr system, .1 th
iiystem of taritr-for-revenuc-only, there
is in Great Britain a growing and verypositive
sentiment in favor ot a return th
to th? system of protection to home in- ho
slustries. th
A writer in the London Xtus says Pr
that ii tho British sovornvaont will put
a duty on foreign products so as to pro- ee(
test homo industries, it will accomplish c](
at onco what all t'ho committees for the th
unemployed can never accomplish, lieaides
the wage*arners, this writer notes
tho fact that purchases of foreign coinmodities
are driving to ruin tradesmen,
shopkeepers and manufacturers. ho
As Great Britain impose* on tobacco,
cicara and spirits a duty o: 800 per rout, j
ho would have a duty equally high put ' ^ |
on all foreign commodities t. ;.'!ve the
British producor a chance to live. The (

IMPORTANT DECISION
Of tho Supremo Court on the Alien Contract
I?abor Law.
"Washington-, 1). C., Dec. 4.?Tlio
United Stated supreme court to-day
rendered an opinion which, while
affirming the constitutionality of tho
alien contract labor law, will embarrass
to some extent tho practical enforcement
of the law. The quostion camo up
on tho appeal of Joseph Lees and John
S.4x>cs, from a decision of the United
States circuit court of tho eastern district
ot Pennsylvania,'fining them $1,000
for importing Frederick Graham, of
England, to perform labor in their mill
at Bridgeport, Pa. Tho court holds that
tho act is valid, but that when tho accused
partios wero compelled to give
o vide nee against themselves in a criminal
proceeding their constitutional .
rights wero violated and hence reverses
the decision.
