ai;wwi of the -. roi.,
Tff'liiive rc-errvnl A pamphlet pub
lialied In fit. Lout! and untitled "The
National Capitol Is Removable!" The
title assertsa self-evident proposition;
but the question of deepest Interest

reol the peoph) anil illgracdng the
institution which were once the pride
of the country and the admiration of
the world. What will It avail ua to
expend millions for the removal of
the vapltol, or tho building of a new
one, unlcM the people will Infuse In
to Its Halls the spirit '"70," re-est ib
llsh the prhxHples boru of that event
ful peviot) ft4 demand of their agents
the patriotic tutegrlty of the father
of tho llepubllc?
Yest "The Capitol Is removable,"
and so arc thieve that infest aud
desecrate it; but so long as the latter
are to le tuletated with In It pre
clncts, it matters little where it is bl
eated, for the disintegration of the
government, hlch uiuat follow a few
inure year of gross corruption, will
obviate the necessity for any Fede
cral Capttol, and ' the brokeu frag
ments will each for Itself, locate and
build Ita1 own ieftt oiT government.
A centralized despotism", even with
Grant as Its head, will not long survive-
Ita Wrto, and amid th struggle;
that will ensuro ;for the recover
of that libertiea, .now being lightly
thrown iWay flie. question will arise
here-iitratl boc located the Capitol
of the new' Confederacies forced Into
vxlstence by the Corruption nnd ty
ranny of the old.
What Interest can the trilling mili
um take In the question of the re
moval of tho Capitol, so long as their
hard earnings are wrung from them
by unequu!, unjust and unnecessary
taxation, that a fund may be raised
to swell the coffer of rings and mo
. nopolies? They foci their 'burdens
aro heavy enough already. They are
fcegrniiiug to learu that money they
r forced to pay, under tho pretence
of paying the public debt, goes Into
a corruption fund to be umu for fast
enlng upon them the corrupt misrule
which U rapidly destroying their lib
trtles and prosperity, It matters not
to them, where tho Capttol Is, until
it can bo mado a point front whloh
cliall emennto Justice, wisdom .and
equal protection to all.
Tun keepers of Grant, lu order to
make vantage ground fur 1872, will
engraft upon his message a show of
reduction of the public debt, a large
decrease of taxation and au tamest
of reform lu the civil service. They
who can believe that such promises
will ho stronger than pie crust, aro of
easy f villi, and little disposed tojud.ro
the future by the past. With all his
strength, growiug out of causes that
need not be ineutloued here, Grant!
knows that he uiuU resort tocun
ni us and duplicity to weaken the
growing opposition of his own part v,
to hi re election. , Aud as false
. . ., . - . . .,
urei and hollow promises arc the
most handy and available-tricks In
such an emerirenov. wo may expect i
a liberal display of both In his forth
oofntng message. Grant and hi
trainer are fully aware of tho uni
versal odium attached to the Income
tux, and we shall look for a recom
mendation for it repeal, us a trump
rard in the R tdlcul programme. But
us the infamous tax must expire'by
limitation, It will, at once, be seen
that any such recommendation Is a
mere "tub to the whale." Experi
ence has taught ih, of the H.iuth, the
value of empty promises, and our
advice (hat the South "wait for tho
agon," and if it ha no other choice
than to vote for a Radical candidate
- lie he hard or soft to make tho bust
bargain it can, sinoo It I only by
playing upon the sclf-lntcrest of as
pirants, that we can hopo to regain
f our last liberties.
Since the foregoing wm written,
we have received and read the mess
axe, but fiud nothing in it to modify
the opinion above expressed. There
nothing in It about San Domingo;
It repeals the stale and vapid utories
alMUt Kuklux and the South and.
for all It should contain, refer the
country to tho reports of his subordl
nite olllovra. It studiously multl-pU-s
words, without saying anything,
and to mention' subject without
i- iinmitting the writer to any definite
opinions, or line of pulioy.

Both Houses of Congress arc or

have been presentod for the relief of

suffer from theft and tyranny except
a call from, Senator Blair, upon the
President for the law, and the fact
upon which, he baaed his suspension
of the wilt of Habeas Corpus. - It 1

the pretended outrages are lies manu

A oi.anck at the proceedings of
Congress will show that the Radicals
are as determined as ever, to destroy
the Republic, and aro acting upo
the European motto, that King
(.Grant) can do no wrong. It Is also
apparent, from the disposition of (he

forcible remarks ou the importance t
the IiIncetoii road, and the necessity
for. prompt aiwl. efficient actlou.
There can., he nothing save manu
factures, more important to Clarks
Vllle than , this contemplated Im
provement, which appeal o directly
to the Interests of all classes of bust
iiess. The project' has ceased to be
problematical, and all hands should
take hold and put it through in the
shortest poanlble time: , .
"On Thursday last, It wna our good
fortune to attend the meeting or the
Directory of the 1'rlnceton and New
Providence railroad, which was held
at the above inimed thriving little
town, although the weather was cold
and thear.ow fell faster than "leaves
In wintry weather." Yet each nnd
allot i hem came up promptly to time.
The accommodating and clever pro
prietor or tne wauonia notci, air.
Marion Boyl, immediately prepared
a warm and comfortable room for
the Directory, and the work of the
duy was soon begun In earnest. Af
ter reading and revising the minutes
of the last meeting, various proposi
tions were suggested, which, in their
turn, elicited spirited discussion. Af
tcr an interchange of opinions was
thus brought about, the Directors
came to the conclusion, that a survey
of the route was the next Uitug to be
done, In order that they might know
the topograpny oi tne country, tne
probable cost of the road, and the
time necessary to build It. Where
upon the Chief Engineer, Mr. McKI-
fatriclt, was oruereu to maKe me pre
liminary survey of the route, as soon
aa possible. Beginning at Princeton
and touching the following points:
Wallonia, Montgomery, New Design
and the vicinity of Garrcttsburg or
Genoa, they alt being on an air line
between the termini of the road..
It being necessary to have money
to defray the expenses of this survey,
the Directory then, for that purpose,
ordered a call to be made rbr ten per
cent of the stock subscribed, aud ap
pointed A. C. Mayes, of Princeton,
J. M. Taylor, of Wallonia, aud John
C. Robertson, of Montgomery, agents
to collect the funds. Mr. John C.
Robertson was also appointed Gener
al Agent, to solicit subscriptions along
the route, between the State line and
Princeton, than whom no better se
lections could have been mndo. . Mr.
Robertson is a plalu, earnest, hard
working, eneigettti and intelligent
gentleman, knows everybody, and is
fully alive to the Interest of the road.
The people may look out for him, and
be prepared to receive him. The wri
ter was then elected Attorney for the
road, and alter some other business
of a general character, which it is
useless to mention, the Directory ad
journed to meet at the same place on
Saturday Dec., 2nd.
We must congratulate the friends
of tho road on having a Directory of
such earnest and energetic men. We
never saw seven men more deter
mined to work for anything, than
these gentlemen are for this rond.
Tliey are emphatically live men, and
Intend to leave Do stone unturned to
build the road. Stock is being taken
eveiy day, aud the prospects are that
in a very short time, a sufficient
amount will be subscribed to build
the road."
