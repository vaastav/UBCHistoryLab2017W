The Laws. We surrender our space
almost entirely this week to the laws pass
ed at the late session of tha legislature,
and designated by the Secretary of State
for publication in the newspapers. We
have preferred to put them all in one
number, where they will thereby be much
more convenient and accessible to all who
cure anything about them. Among the
acts in which a general interest will be
felt, are tho following : Normal Schools-
Division of School money Registry of
Voters Redemption of Bank bills In
terest Preservation of fish increasing
pay of jurors and witness and allowing re
spondents to testify.
The President's Message.
We of course have no room this week
for the President's Message which was
sent to Congress on Monday. It is quite
as brief as could be expected of such a
document, and is most remarkable for
what it docs not say. The President is
very much less beligerent in tone toward
Congress than in any of his speeches dur
ing the last ten months, while he at the
same time re-affirms his policy and thinks
the best recommendation lie can make to
Congress is to immediately admit the
southern delegates to Congress. It could
hardly be expected that the President
would change his mind, and yet it is a
strange recommendation to make now that
the people have just pronounced an over
whelming verdict against it, and especial
ly so to urge Congress to do that which
their constituents at home have just in
structed them not to do. And this is the
essence of all there is in the message on
national politics. There is no allusion
whatever to the pending amendment pro
posed by Congress, in other words the pol
icy of Congress, nor to the late elections,
and the amount of space devoted to this
subject is less thun two columns.
As a whole the message maybe regarded
as conciliatory in tone, and the other sub
jects treated of will give general sati-fac-
tion to the country. Our relations with
France, England and Mexico, are not so
complicated as have been represented.
appears that the French Emperor did au
thorize a variation frcm the agreement in
regard to the withdrawal of our troops
from Mexico, upon which our government
took occasion lo express its dissent. There
the matter stands at present, but the Pres
ident expresses a hope that France will
conform as nearly as possible to the origi
nal agreement. On the subject of the
Alabama claims, tbe President says there
is reason to believe that the new English
Ministry will act in a becoming and friend
ly spirit. With regaid to the Fenian
prisoners in Canada, tho President urges
those considerations which tend to clem
ency, and says that those prisoners who
are citizens of this country have been
provided with counsel by our government.
During the last fourteen months the
public-debt has been reduced $206,879,565,
a very gratifying exhibit. The President
also expresses the welcome opinion that
the taxes may be reduced and the entire
debt extinguished in the next quarter of
a century. He also recommends that the
District of Columbia be allowed a dele
gate in Congress, same as a territory. The
postal service shows a deficit on account of
the Southern States. This is the old
story. The South never did pay its pos
tage, and never will till education becomes
mo e general among its people.
Congress.
Congress met on Monday aud a quorum
was present in both Houses. The creden
tials of Senators Polund and Edmunds of
this State were presented, and they were
sworn in. The late elections have evi
dently increased the strength of the Union
and radical element in Congress and some
of the members are a'most rampant. In
the House a bill was immediately passed
the effect of which is to prevent the Pres
ident from pardoning any more rebels.
The vote on the passage of this bi 1 was
111 to 29. Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois
offered a resolution calling upon the Presi
dent for information as to " how near the
veige of the government the present body
call d a Congress is at present, and if it
is not nearer the centre than he formerly
supposed.
At a caucus of the Union members,
Mr. Stevens declared, amid great laughter,
that he was too conservative " last ses
sion, that he had been rebuked for it by
his constituents and that he was now go
ing to catch up with them. Gov. Bout
well of Mass., and others made very radi
cal speeches. Hon. J. S. Morrill of this
Sta:c was Chairman of the caucus.
Tns Listing Laws. A large number
of bills were introduced in the legislature
relating to the grand list, but only one was
passed. On the last day of the session in
AitiiEST op Scheatt. John II. Sur-
ratt, one of the assassins ot President
Lincoln, has finally been caught and ar
rested in Egypt, by U. S. Consul Halo,
nnd will be forwarded to this country.
There is much rejoici g at this event, and
hopes are entei tained that some of the
mysteries of the assassination may be
cleared up by his tri;d or confession.
Third District. The official vote
for member of Congress in the third dis
trict has been announced and is as fol
lows : Whole number of votes, 1 1,250.
W. C. Smith, 5730 ; A. O. Aldis, 2791 ;
W. Brigham, 2680; Scattering 44;
Smith's plurality 2936, and his majority
210. Tho danger of electing a democrat
in that district is not very apparent, even
if the Union party do split.
