The Gospel of Reaction
The easiest thinjr to sav ai><>ut the president's message
is that it is characteristic of Mr. Harding. It is calm,
dignified and. for the most part, colorless.
His recommendation* that amendments he submitted to
make passible the regulation of child laltor and the re
strictions on issues of tax-exempt securities are along
popular lines and will be well received.
There will lie little objection to his plan of the registra
tion of immigrants or for the enforcement of the prohibi
tion law.
His comment on foreign relations is what might have
been expected, and indicate that we are still standing jmt
in watchful isolation.
Probably the only "kick" in the message is the recom
mendation that a labor division of the interstate com
merce commission be empowered to hear and decide rail
road labor disputes as to wages and working conditions,
and to have power to enforce its decisions. This mean*
giving a governmental body the power to fix wages and
that, of course, will meet with bitter opposition from
organized labor.
This proposal, which would set up the reactionary inter-
State commerce commission as a sort of national Kansas
industrial court system, will receive scant consideration in
a congress practically dominated by progressives, ready
to champion the cause of frve labor.
While the farmer receives some passing sympathy,
that's about all he does get.
He is told he ought to have all the help the federal
government can give him, and whatever that may be is
left to the best judgment of congress. The farmer is
assured, however, that the outstanding problem is better
and cheaper transportation. With this the farmer will
doubtless agree, altho he may want relief now instead of
waiting until the president's dream comes true of a co
ordination of all transportation systems from railroads
down to the motor highways, with these acting as feeders
to the railway#.
Some farmers might, with reason, infer that the presi
dent is more interested in the ultimate needs of the rail
goads than the present needs of the farmers.
Altogether, the message doesn't say much and doesn't
mean much. It reads as if written by a president who
hadn't yet quite made up his mind.

Income Tax for State
They're beginning to talk sense. At the statewide
meeting at Tacoma a few days ago, where taxation que.«v
tfona were under discussion, a strong sentiment developed
for a state income tax law.
That is what we should have. In fact. The Star ques
tions if the great bulk of all our taxes of every sort ought
Aot be raised by income and inheritance taxes.
An income tax is fair; it exempts the men and women
of meager resources and lays the burden in increasing
acale upon those best able to pay.
An income tax would be efficient and economical to
collect, for the state would have access to the federal re
turns, and thus would be relieved of tte cost of maintain-
In* expensive machinery for the purpose.
By all means, the next legislature should incorporate
the income tax idea into our state system.

The Thought Behind the Face
Daily you pass hundreds of strange faces. Hehind those
facial masks, thinking of some sort is going on constantly.
What would you give to be able to read their thoughts'
Would you want your own read?
Sometimes, in a flash, you learn what is stewing inside
»ne individual head. As, for instance, this classified ad
tn the "agony cofUmn" of London Times: "A mother of
Daughters TIIANKS every MOTIIEH who gave or lent a
ION to England, 1914 to 1918."
With that "off her chest," she's probably more peace
