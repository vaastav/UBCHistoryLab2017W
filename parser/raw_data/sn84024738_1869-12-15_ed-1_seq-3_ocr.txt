WASHINGTON NEWS.
Correspondence of the Richmond Dispatch.
WiiBWOWs, December 18,1889.
There is quite an extensive amount of!
talk just now about the passage of a sweep
ing disability bill but much delav about
setting the ball in motion. There is a
growing feeling among the more sensible
and loss vindictive Radicals in favor of a re
moval of the restrictions under which so
many of the white people living south oi
the Potomac exist t and as it is known that
the President, hacked up strongly bv Gen
eral Sherman and, with only a few excep
tions. the entire army aud navy, is also in
favor of some general measure for removing
political disabilities, the hope has been in
spired that as soon as the session recom
mences after the holiday recess the matter
will take practical shape,* and be pushed to
a very gratifying conelusion to those in fa
vor ot ending the prescriptive measures
that prevail to-dav.
Senator Drake has grace enough to sav
that he will not be able to impart his view's
with reference to disabling the Supreme
Court with all their force to his political as
sociates. Some of them may agree with
him in his crusade upon the judicial branch
of the Government, but not enough to give
his position the slightest dignity.
It i> rather noticeable that Grant has very
little association with politicians, no matter
li ov exalted their station, and after the ex
piration of the hours which he devotes to
oftieiul duties he is very nuieh averse to re
ceiving any but social visitors, who, of
course, see "him with his family, and not in
the executive office. This is riot agreeable
to some of the over-enthusiastic adherent*
of the party of progress, who imagine that
the President is as much their property a*
their overcoats or umbrellas. Grant's old
army notions stick to him, and he will not
discus* polities, although he is not apt to
a-k questions of Congress, being pertectly
willing to execute all the laws that congress
men make.
The proposals which some of the Cabinet
officers have suggested to Congress to make
an increase of salaries will receive some
comment before adopted, even if they are.
Those who cry so vehemently in favor of
retrenchment and reform refuse to believe
that there is any necessity for increasing
salaries, and Horace Greeley backs tliem up
fervently. Perhaps Congress does-not know
that among the extraordinary expenses of
the Government is an item of ?14,000 per
annum expended as extra compensation
outside of salaries for twenty-three clerks
in tire office of the Secretary of the Trea- j
suit.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs is
still busy with bis annual report. This will
be a very interesting document when com
pleted. "
The views ot congressmcnon the financial
situation and the methods ot' solving the
intricate national financial problem now be
fore the rulers increase every day. The
discussions on this topic are likely to be
lengthv and labored. Everv man in Con
cress imagines he knows the exact^ thing
wanted to* put the nation's finances in the
real groove ot certain success, but very few
as vet agree on the topic.
The Western members are fighting bard
to secure an inflation of the currency, as
serting that it will not retard the coming of
specie payments an hour. Some of the East
ern members are willing to cut oti a hun
dred millions from circulation. It is thought
here that the inflationists will carry the day,
notwithstanding both the President and
Secretary of the Treasury are for contrac
tion.
somehow or other, the lobby has not suc
ceeded in getting fairly at work. Then* is
an evident drawback somewhere. Possibly,
however, thev will spring their influence
alter New Year's Day. As yet there is no
show for startling "jobs." There is too
nun'h patriotism in Congress or too little
money in the lobby to allow a very early
commencement of operations. Timox.
The Three Keeoustruction Bills.
1. Famsicorth's Bill.
44 Whereas the people of Virginia have
adopted a Constitution republican in form,
and have in all respects conformed to the
requirements of the act of Congress enti
tled ? an net authorizing the submission of
the Constitutions of Virginia, Mississippi,
and Texas, to a vote of the people, and
authorizing the election of State officers
provided "by the said Constitutions, and
members ot Contjwess,' approved April 10,
lbGO; therefore be it
" ft'solved by the Senate and House of
BopyescntaU'ccs of the United Statesof Ame
rica hi Congress'assembled, .That tue said
Mate of Virginia is entitled to representa
tion in the Congress of the United Mules."
'A The following i> proposed as a substi
tute by Mr. Paine, of the Reconstruction
Committee :
"Whereas the people of Virginia have
adopted a Constitution republican in form,
and have in all respects complied with the
requirements of the several acts of Congress
providing for the reconstruction of the late
rehel States; therefore be it
" llesoiced, dr., That the State of Virgi
nia is entitled to representation in the Con
gress of the United States."
' Mr. Butler introduced the following?
viz. :
'?'Whereas the people of Virginia have
adopted a Constitution republican in form,
and by its provisions assuring the equality
of right in all citizens of the United states
before the law, and has in all respects com
plied with the requirements of the several
acts of Congress providing for the recon
struction of the late insurrectionary States ;
rind whereas the Congress of the United
States have received assurances, and are as
sured, that the people of Virginia, and espe
cially those heretofore in insurrection
against the United States, have renounced
all claims of any right ot secession in any
State, and that they are now well disposed
to the Uovei mnent of the United States, and
will support and defend the Constitution
thereof, and will carry out the provisions of
the Constitution submitted by the recon
struction acts of Congress, and ratified by
the people of Virginia in letter and spirit:
therefore he it
?'licsolccd, d'C., That the StateofYir
ginia is entitled to representation in the
Congress of the United States."
These several propositions were referred
to the Committee on Reconstruction.
Whittlesey vs. SIcKenzie? Retroces
sion of MexniMt"!#.
In the House of Representatives Monday
Mr. Paine, of Wisconsin, from the Commit
tee on Elections, offered the following reso
lution :
44 Whereas it is claimed that the retroces
sion of the county of Alexandria to the
State of Virginia,* by virtue of the act of
Congress entitled 'an act to retroeede the
county of Alexandria, in the District of Co
lumbia, to the Slate of Virginia,' approved
July 9, lS-iG, and of the proclamation -nf
.Tumes K. Polk, President of the United
Mates, made in pursuance of said act on
the 7th day of September, 184G, was uncon
stitutional*aud void ; and that Lewis Mc
Kenzie, claiming a seat in this House as a
representative of the seventh congressional
district of Virginia, and alleged to be a citi
zen of said Alexandria county, is ineligible
to such seat because not an inhabitant of
the said State of Y irginia ; therefore
44Resolved, That the Committee on the
Judiciary be instructed to inquire whether
said retrocession was unconstitutional and
void, and if so, whether said Lewis Mc
Kenzie is for that reason ineligible to a seat
in thL House as the representative of the
seventh congressional district of Virginia,
and to report by bill or otherwise on or be
fore the 10th day of January, 1870."
Mr. Paine said he supposed lie might
have offered the resolution as a question of
privilege, but he preferred to ofi'er it in this
way as a simple resolution for action at this
time, and he hoped 110 exception would be
taken to it. This was a question that the
House would shortly be called upon to.J
meet, and he thought'it desirable that there '
should be a report from the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Mr. Piucklenburg, of Missouri, objected
to the resolutiou.
Mr. Paiiie then moved to suspend the
rules.
Mr. Logan, of Illinois, thought this a very
Uuusual time to bring up this resolution,
especially as the question of the constitu
tionality o1 the act of retrocession had not
been regularly raised. It has been decided
that that act was constitutional, and no
other decision has been' asked for, except
bv thls resolution, end for that reason he
objected to the reference.
Mr. Paine said the question had been
raised, and there is now a case pending in
which it mifst be decided. It was not
raised as an abstract question, but because
the necessity existed to meet it promptly.
The opposition seemed to come, however,
from gentlemen who wore perhaps inter
ested in the removal of the capital or seat of
government, and he had no doubt, the op
position could be explained in flr t war.
If there was ho objection he woulu with
draw the resolution.
Objection was-made.
Mr. Lo?ran was surprised that the Chair,
man of the. Committee on Elections shoul-.
i attribute lbe opposition to this measure (?<
a desire for the removal of the capital. ? b
had viewed it just the other way. l.:*I
thought the gentleman from AViscon.-iu
wanted to get a report upon this subject
now, with an ulterior object in view.
Mr. Grover. of Kentucky, asked Mr.
Paine whether he knew to Vhat partv Mr.
MoKenzie belonged, that howas sonnxiou
fo rule him out.
Mr. Paine replied that he believed Mr.
McITeuzle belonged to tbe Kepublieai L
party.
Air. Farnsworth. of Illinois, suggested
that Mr. AlcKenzie was reported to repre
sent other people besides tlioso of Alexan
dria county, A a., and he wanted to knov.
if it was proposed to disfranchise all tin
people of the coiurrcrional district if tin
retrocession of Alexandria was declared
unconstitutional. _
Afr. Paine said the gentleman knew ver*
well what his views were toward Air. AI<:
Kenzie, and he could hardly be accused o
desiring to legislate him out without cause
Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, though
the resolution contemplated an act of injus
tice which the House should not entertain,
aud ho moved to lay it on the table. H
withdrew it,however, temporarily,toallov
further rem ., ivs.
Mr. Sell nek, of Ohio, said he was prob: -
bly the only suvvivor in the House of tho
Congress that passed theactretrocedingtl,;
county of Alexandria to Virginia son- ?
twenty-three or twenty-five years ago. H"
was a* member of the House then, and for
twenty-five years the retrocession lias bee-:
recognized 'as constitutional. The district
of which Alexandria is a part has been
electing members of Congress from time 11
time, and the right of representatives from
that district has never been questioned.
Yet now we are asked to make an outsid ?
collateral question, and in his opinion if
would be better to leave the law alone as i
had stood for the past twenty-five or thirt;.
years.
Suppose, we get the opinion of the Con.
mittee on the Judiciary that the act o'
retrocession was unconstitutional, wha:
have we then ? Why, we have simply the
opinion of nine intelligent gentlemen as
against the opinion of a large majority ol
botlr Houses of the Congress that parsed
the act of retrocession, and who 9uppo/od
thev were doing a constitutional act. Since
that time it had always been recognized as
constitutional without a question, and he
did not see why it should be raised now.
The question was then taken upon Air.
Randall s motion to lay the resolution 011
the table: and it was agreed to.
In the Senate Alonday Air. Cattell pre

Bills for a general amnesty have been in
troduced in both the Senate and House, but

How the Georgians Show their
Loyalty.
Special illsputch totlie Chronicle.
Atlanta, Ga., December 13.?General
Morgan, a leading Democratic member oi
the Georgia Legislature, has published a
rejoinder to Congressman Tift's letter, in
which he says :
"Neither"Senate nor IIousc intended to
submit the question of eligibility of colored
members to seats in the Legislature to the
Supreme Court. The present Legislature
never will re-seat negroes, nor will it
pass the fifteenth amendment. These are
settled facts. For myself, I have been a
subuiissionist as long lis I intend to be, and
have gone as far as I intend to go to gratify
the unhallowed will and domineering spirit
of a corrupt Congress."
Democratic puj jrs quote the above as a
manly sentiment and having tiie ring of the
true metal. General Morgan occupies the
seat of an expelled uegro member.
Becclicr's Reply to a >'ote frojn

Brooklyn, December 11. 1809.
My Dear'Mr. Bonner,?1 took every state
ment of every kind respecting the affair of
which you write me " without time to in
vestigate." The man was dying. Was that
a time for sifting evidenceWhat was to
be done must be done quickly. I asked
only such things us should* determine
whether 1 had a right to go forward. It
was lor my own sake, therefore, that I
hastily inquired, and' not to inculpate or
to exculpate any one.
But as you how call my attention to the
fact that what I did lor "my own justifica
tion is hanging over McFarland to liis in
jury, and tends to forestall a verdict against
him, 1 agree with you that I ought not to
let it remain uncorrected. I should be as
unwilling to do an act of injustice toward
him as toward any one else. Concurring,
therefore, with you that it is now due to
McFarluud lor me to state that [ know
of no legal proof against him on lliat point.
1 do so unhesitatingly. At the time that i
>tated what 1 did. I thought of its relation
only to other parties. I did not dream of its
bearing upon McFarland.

Mr. Greeley and tub New York Sun's
Interviewer.?Mr. Greeley publishes a card
in the New York Sun denying the accuracy
of the "interviewer's" report of the con
versation had with the " philosopher of the
Tribune" last week, and published in the
New York Sun. Mr. Greeley says that the
"interviewer" concealed the fact that he
was a reporter of the Sun; denies that the
name of the Supreme Being was used by
him in that conversation, whether profanely
or otherwise; that he did not say he would
have to testify on the trial of McFarland;
and that he did not say he did not want to
hurt Mac., &c. Finally, Mr. Greeley says
what lie did say was substantially this:
"That this marriage on a death-bed, besides
giving the woman a legal right to be a
mother to Richardson's young nutl doubly
orphaned children, was operative maiulv in
giving her a right, throughout her bfack
and bitter future, to be called bv the name
of him who for her sake was so foully mur
dered, rather than that of his stealthy, cow
ardly assassin; and this small mitigation of j
her immeasurable woes I regarded as hu-1
mane and just. That is my opinion, and 1
propose to stand by it."

The Pennsylvania Coal Trade.?Yes
terday's Philadelphia Ledger thus speaks of
the anthracite coal trade :
"The coal trade, with the close of navi
gation, is slacking otF materially, yet the
orders for and the shipments of coal from
this point are considerably in excess of the
current receipts. For the last three days of
last week there was quite an increase of
orders for coal, fully maintaining prices.
There has been only "a moderate supply of
vessels at Port Richmond?the cold snap
a week or ten days ago was received by
captains as a caution not to venture
too far north. The consequence was,
freight' charges north were held high,
and an indifference to load south, ex
cept to open ports, generally prevailed. The
few days of warmer weather since has pro
duced some change in this respect, and ves
sels are more numerous at about last week's
rates. A number of vessels are on their
way back from northern ports, and should
they return to tin's port, venturing another
trip, instead of stopping at the inlets where
they belong, laying-up for winter quarters,
the supply" of Vessels here may* be so in
crcasea as to put down freights. The coal
trade bv water, however, may be considered
over.
" The Reading railroad brought down for
the week 80,0-12 tons against 127,777 tons
for the previous week, and 123/201 tons
since the 1st instant, the beginning of
the company's lineal year, against 01,170
tons to corresponding time last year?an in
crease of 02,091 tons." This is starting the
new fiscal year favorably. The Schuylkill
canal shipped for the week 10,594 tons
against 29,427 tons the previous week, and
for the season, 092,659 tons against 080,444
tons to same date in 1808?a decrease of
293,785 tons.
" The entire tonnage of ail the carrying
companies for the week was 409,472 tons
against 398,571 tons the previous week. As
some of the companies have ended their
fiscal years, we omit the aggregate annual
tonnage until the end of the year, when the
aceouht can be more accurately presented.
The annual anthracite production for 1809
will probably be about fourteen millions of
tons?a quarter of a million of tons more
or less short of the tonnage of 1808."
Fresh Proofs of Dr. J-'choeitk's Guilt.?
The Ilarrisburg Telegraph, referring to the
efforts made in behalf of Dr. Schoeppe,
says :
"On this subject we have not now a word
to say, but it is* well the public should know
that while the friends ot 'Dr. Schoeppe are
using their utmost efforts to satisfy the Gov
ernor that there is reasonable doubt of his
guilt, the fricuds of his alleged victim, Miss
Steiuecke, are, on the contrary, daily furnish
ing fresh proofs to the Executive of the
Doctor's guilt, and that it is not a case for
the exercise of the pardoning power, or
even the granting of a respite. The whole
matter is now before Governor Geary, and
he will act in the case as his judgment and
conscience dictate."

The Admission of Virginia.
The members of the minority or extreme
"Radical wing of the Legislature of "V irgi
nia presented to the Reconstruction Com
mittee to-dav their protest against the ad
mission of the State under its present form
of government. They desire that the test
oath should be administered to the Legisla
ture, and that the Legislature should take
no part in the election of senators and other
officers until after the State is admitted.
This protest is the same as that presented
by them at the organization of the Legisla-1
ture. Then it was signed ^hv forty-four I
members, now it is signed by twenty-eight?
the others having bolted, and arc now de
manding the admission of the State as at.
present constituted. Bland, the colored
State senator, is among the latter.
Mr. Ward, of New York, presented a bill
in the House to-day providing for the ad
mission of Virginia, and that the clauses in
the new Constitution which relate to suf
frage, a common free-school fund, and that
colored men shall serve as jurors, shall
never be altered or repealed. The bill was
referred to the Committee on Reconstruc
tion.
There is much disappointment felt bj
some of the legislative committee and others
some ui icgiM-w- - . .,
who expected the Reconstruction Commit
tee to report to-day a bill for the admission
of Virginia.
It i? expected the Senate will pass Mor
ton's bill to-morrow, but it is doubtful whe
ther the subject will come up in the House.
.Patience must be exercised. There is no
doubt of the ultimate result.

mittee this morning the Democratic mem
bers moved the adoption of Mr.-Jams
worth's bill providing, for unqualified ad
mission, and 3Ir. Wliittemorc moved the
adoption of Mr. Ward's bill. Both motions
were defeated, and after discussion of the
Paine and Butler propositions, but without
determining the matter, the committee ad
journed until next Saturday.
These delays give rise to anxiety lest the
subject may go over until alter the holidays
without final action, and possibly result in
sending the subject back to the citizens of
Virginia for vote, or further action of some
kind or other; but the latter result cannot
surelv take place, for Governor Walker, who
has thoroughly canvassed the Senate aud
House, finds about nine-tenths of the sena
tors and representatives in favor ol imme
diate admission upon about such a resolu
tion as that of Mr. Farnsworth.
The Late Senator Fessenden?Speeclies
lii the Senate.
The number of speeches in the Senate to
dav on the announcement of the death ot
Mr. Fessenden were greater than has been
customary on such occasions, and a notice
able feature about them was the written re
marks read from the manuscript. But two.
?senators delivered extempore speeches, and
these were committed to memory from
man useript that was all the time lying conve
niently on the desks of the orators. In gen
eral the eulogies were correct estimates oi the j
character and capabilities of the deceased 1
senator, and, with two or three exceptions,
the efforts were in good taste.- One of the
notable exceptions was in the remarks'of
Senator Davis, who inserted into his speech
an attack upon Radicals, giving utterance
to strong partisan political sentiments,
thomdi the points made showing blemishes
and broad- inconsistencies in 3Ir. Fessen
den's character as a statesman were well
taken; yet Senator Davis was not content
with a' simple reference to them, hut em
braced the opportunity to get oil' a political
harangue, ill-timed and out of place.
Cnba?Revival of Hope.
The Cuban heart, bowed down with the
weight of Spanish gunboats and other ad
verse circumstances, has revived within the
piist eight hours by reason ot an unexpect
ed impulse in their favor discovered by re
solutions etc., in Congress and a canvass of
the members, most of whom are disposed
to take issue with the arguments in the
President's message relative to the status of
the insurgents aud thPir claim to he a de
facto government. What shall be the re
medy to apply to the case gives them pause,
however ; and although Cuban friends and
sympathizers are numerous, there is no
concert of action among them.

DCAI5AGE ABOUT OUR HOtStSSi f
'' Oh wad some pow' r the * i (tie gle us
ToseeoarselsaAlthcragecusi
It wad frao monlc a blunder free to.
An' foolish notion."
For some reason we never see oil selves or
our surroundings in the lignt of truth. Con
ditions which have grown up with us seem
natural and proper to us, however tbey may
seem to others. This is especially true of
farmers, who live on the farms or in the
neighborhoods where they were born. The
kinds of crops, the modes*of cultivation, the
arrangement of their buildings, the division
of their farms, seem exactly right, because
they are used to them, and have thought, of
nothing different. Let one of these farmer.
buy a farm in another State, or let an intel
ligent stranger take one of these old places,
arid there is at once the improvement thai
jccrmes fmm a new and unprejudiced view of
things. The new occupant is not afraid of
the ghost of his grandfather. and straight
way uses his own wits, demolishes old build
ings, removes the little enclosures for front
yards and calf pastures and colt pastures,
and puts things into convenient shape.
Flit there is something more than mere
habit that seems to control us in our judg
ment of our own affairs. We have an idea
that- we are exce'ptions to general rules.
We think our family healthy though we
have the doctor every week. Our dog won't
bite, and our chickens don't trouble the
neighbors. Saleratus bread and pickles and
candy don't hurt our children, though we
must confess they are always ailing. A wo
man was heard to declare that she knew hot
tea and coffee were not injurious to the teeth,
for she had used both all her life, and when
she was reminded that she had worn a full
set of false teeth for years, she said she did
not think of that!
Xo doubt many families are suffering, and
even slowly perishing, for want of proper
drainage of their dwellings and out-budd
ings, and yet it seems to be regarded as a per
sonal affront to intimate to a man t hat a pool
of 3ink-water at his door, or a pond of stag
nant water in his cellar, is unheathful.
HOW WELLS APE POISONED.
Many wells are bad in summer which for
merly were good. To put the matter plain
ly, this is generally because the drainage
from a sink dr trom a vault runs into the
well. A deep drain takes the water from a
shallower one, and a well draws towards it
all the water that is higher, for a long dis
tance?many rods even, ip sandy soil.
In the spring, when the ground is fulhof
water, it does not tend so much towards
the well, because the well is also full: and
besides, the sink-water is so much diluted
that we get loss of it* flavor.
Earth of any kind is a great disinfectant
and deodorizer. Dogs having had wounds
sometimes dig holes in the ground and lay
the wound against the fresh soil; and gar
ments infected by disease, or offensive with
animal odors, are purified by burying them
in the ground.
For a long time, therefore, the earth ab
sorbs the had qualities of sink-water and the 1
like, but .after months and years it becomes
saturated; and the water, percolating
through the soil, takes along its impurities
with it?so that suddenly old wells, which
have always been excellent, will be spoiled.
There is* a cause for everv thing, and a verv
natural one for wells thus becoming bad, al
though one dislikes to admit that his family
Ls drinking this sort of fluid. In two In
stances, years ago, where persons came to
ask my a'dvice as to the cause of their well
water" becoming bad, and I attributed it to
their sink-drains, they both declared it could
not be possible; hut an investigation traced
the drainage water, by its discoloration of
the earth, plainly to the wells. In one of
these oases the well had becu dugonly a year
or two, and was fitly feet or more from the
sink-hole. It was; however, in the direction
in which the water naturally flowed in the
ground. There is always a direction in
which water in the ground naturally flows
towards some swamp or ravine, where it
finds an outlet in springs. There is little dan
ger that thjs current, will he reversed, and
in arranging for draining buildings it is of
great importance to discharge your drains
into this natural current beyond your well.
Unless there i* a great draft upon the well
by pumping, the water in it will stand us
high as in the ground around it, and will
flow out of it with the natural underground
current.
Somebody has wisely said that no mau is 1
so poor that he need Have his pig-trough at
his front door; but I fear there ure many
men so thoughtless and shiftless as to have
open sink-holes close by their houses, and
these are iniinitely more unhealthfuL than a
well managed feeding-trough.
UNHEALTIIFTL VESS OF DRAINAGE
DEPOSITS.
The Smithsonian Report for 18G8 contains
an elaborate report of a very learned com
mittee on the influence of the Washington-1
City canal on the health of the population.
In a paper which I sent you some weeks
since, I referred to Professor Antisell's analy
sis of the deposits in this canal, by which'it
appeared that they were ot very little value
to the farmer, and. would not pay for cart
ing away?a ton of the mud being worth
>nly about 98 cents. He says the sewage wa- j
ter'differs very little, chemically, from pure
l'otouiac water. It lias an offensive odor,
which is mainly due to the soap-water of
sewage; yet he says the sun and air, operating
on the mud in summer, decompose the veg
etable matters, and its emanations are car
ried over the city by the breezes and be
come potent causes of disease.
The committee say: "From the expi
encc of other cities, and the investigate
experi-1
"ations
of chemists and engineers, we learn that
open sewers, as the canal in this city, evolve
gases very prejudicial to health. Observa
tion has shown that the death-rate is much
greater among the population along these
ojk'u sewers than in streets removed but a
short distance from them."
Again: "Every gallon of sewerage will
discharge from I-V to 1'A cubic inches of this
(poisonous) gas per hour, and the fermenta
tion continues for weeks. Whenever this
putrid
fatal." They speak of the effect of the drain
age of the city of London into the Thames,
which so contaminated the river that the
houses of Parliament, upon its banks, were
hardly habitable, so that in 18oS an appro-1
priation of fifteen million dollars was author-1
ized for sending the drainage in another di-1
rection. The committee attribute the poi
soning of many persons at the National Ho
tel in Washington, in 1837, to the pestilen
tial influences of the sewers. Among them
were several distinguished members of Con
gress, and at the time it was supposed by
many that a deliberate attempt had been
made to murder them by poison
DEATII FROM GAS OF HEWER?.
They cite instances given by an engineer]
in a report relating to the London sewers
to show how deadly arc the effects some-]
times of the emanations from these sewers.
Five men were killed in I8f>2. Three of them
had gone into the sewer early in the morn
ing, and not returning, alarm was felt for
their safety. A surgeon entered the sewer
and was killed on the spot. A young police-1
man followed, and was struck dead in a few |
minutes. On making an opening from the I
street into the sewer to get the bodies of
these men, the gases as they escaped were I
set on Are by a match, and burnt with a yel
low flame, rising twenty feet. Three more
lives were lo*t by breathing sewage gases
that escaped from an opening into a sewer.
Tlie committee conclude by expressing]
their opinion that the canal at Washington
is a great cause for creating and propagating
disease, and should at once be filled up, and
a system of sewerage adopted that will car
ry the drainage water of the city many miles
age
awuv.
When we consider that this canal is so fa
tally poisonous, and yet that the deposits j
in it contain so small a perccntago or any
thing valuable for manure that it will not
pay lor hauling away, we may form some
opinion of the effect of the emanations from
our sinks and barn cellars and vaults, which
are a hundred times stronger.
General liutler, by merely cleansing New
Orleans, not only prevented the cholera, but
rendered the citv during his administration
one of the healthiest in the Union; and if
we had in every village, as well as city,
health officers who woula enforce proper reg
ulations for drainage about our buildings,
(there would be in country as well as city a
sensible decrease of sickness in its worst
forms. The emanations from wet cellars,
from vaults and sink-dhiins, are those most
common in the rural districts. "Their of
fence is rank and smells to heaven," yet
many men seem powerless to apply the rente*
dy.
Boards of health and engineers will take
care of the cities, but wo farmers must look
out for ourselves. The following extract
from a New York paper illustrates our sub
ject :

anMB?yaw

whole popnlation; tn other word?, there are
fewer neath" by a thousand In a yeartnm

tion of a health officer, Mr. Davie*. who,
aided by four Inspectors, baa vMted every
tenement court three times a week, exam
Ined every house and closet, disinfected every
nuisance, and superintended the clearing of
drains and the whitewjiah&i? of walls. . Al
though a great part of the population live In
these crowdedcourts, Mr. Da vies his suc
ceeded in extirpating typhus and other ma
lignant fevers, and has thoroughly Interested
the laboring people themselves In his mea
sures.
Is there any other field for benevolent en
terprises equal to this ? Ia there any other
form of labor open to man in which the high
jest philanthropic ambition could Jiope di
rectlv to save a thousand lives a year ? Yet
if a little of the effort and monev annmllv
wasted In this city In those charities whieh
create and encourage pauperism were in
telligentlv applied to imitating Mr. Davies
the saving would be as much greater here
as Xew York is larger than Bristol.?Judge
