The Denver Republican does not
agree with the Salt Lake Tribune In I I
1 f
Its statement that Denver and Colora
do In jseheral have been paralyzed on
account of hostile silver legislation and
has the following to say regarding an
article recently published In the Salt
Lake Mining Oracle
In a irecent issue the Salt Lake
Tribune pontalned an at tide represent
ing Denver a being in a condition of
utter business stagnation It is sur I
prising that a paper printed in the
Rocky Mountains should publish any
1
thing so untruthful about Denver As
a matter of fact both Denver and the 1
mater
state have been recovering from the I
late business depression with wonder i
ful rapidity Denver Is In many re
spects the best city in the Union
viewed from a business standpoint
and as for the state the rapid growth I
of gold mining promises to do away en
tirely with the business depression ex
cept in the camps which are entirely
or almost exclusively engaged in sil
ver mlnitig I is already evident that
Coloradols gold resources are enormous
and that the state stands upon the
threshold of a gold boom
THE HOUSE OF DEATH
Sumo Occurrences for Which No Explana
tion Is Offered
Do you believe in the superstitions con
nected with the house of death The con
tributor confesses that he has always
been skejiHcal about them but here are
three old signs which prophesied death In
a Waterbury home recently which are
almost remarkable In their coincidence If
not in supernatural significance
A group of people were sitting In a
pleasant roora one evening in one of the
suburbs of iVaterbury where neighborly
intercourse Is often freer than In the city
itself There was a knock at the door
and another neighbor came In on an er
rand Another and another neighbor and
then I th rd Turn some one remarked
Three kn cks and three callers The next
will come n without knocking and Death
will come in after him The next in
comer cal e In without a knock and it
was a nel hbors boy as strong and
healthy a ad a one is likely t see any
where jid Death was behind him
through t ey did not see him nor think
much of v hat had been said
This bov s mother has always been dis
turbed by an extraordinary anxiety and
restlessness at the approach of death to
any of heri relatives It has happened sev
eral times that she has been pursued as it
I hSehg 1
seemed through the house from garret to
cellar and through all the rooms by an
incorporal something which she tried to
escape Xo one could stop her or quiet
her for a long tme A day or two after
the mysterious fourth call at the neigh
bors door this mother who had heard
nothing about that incident was seized
with this Intangible fear and began her
perplexed wanderings through the house
In and out up and down she walked
with u frightened air trying to escape
whit She did not know but they agreed
that death was pursuing some member
of the family
orO J
j One day hot long after the boy who was
the fourth caller and whose mother had
had this premonition was sick Not very
but a little His father was sent for In
the city to come home He was detained
and walked home In the early evening A
strange cat followed him home crossing
his track and winding its way in and out
I of his along the road At home was an
I other strange cat which had followed Q
sister home They were stopped at the
door and soon were joined by two more
The fourth stood there on guard all night
and all next day with a dreadful patience
and persistence craving admittance with
signs of horrid appetite dodging into the
house whenever the door a opened and
kept I a distance only by great difficulty
They might have been stoned or shot but
that is not the way the old superstition
reads The boy Inside grew worse and
died the next day gew
This Is not a very remarkable story but
I It made a good deal of an Impression on
the contributor as it was told to him by
a member of the family who knew that
I those things had happened In just this
way that they were old superstitions
I which still 1ve and who asked him if he
believed there was anything In It Water

Heat Kills Ferns
I is certain that ferns will do better i
at all times in a room in which there is 1
only a fire occasional than in one I
where it i kept alight daily The rea I
son for this is not difficult to under
stand When a lire is kept up the air II
jis t too dry and a a consequence the
I fronds shrivel up and die away Most I
ferns like a moist airindeed i Is nat
ural to them We need not be sur I
I prised then if they look unhappy in i
the dry air of constantly heated rooms
All the ferns that i is usual to attempt
I to cultivate in such places only require
to be kept ftee from frost I is D mis
take altogether to suppose that they
will be benefitted by being kept warm
by the aid of a fre They will do much
better in a room in which there is only
an occasional one made Such ferns as
the common maidenhair Pterls ere
tlca and Asplenium flaccidum keep in
good condition for several years in
j I rooms in which there is not a regular
fire The onir important part about
their treatment is the water supply
Care should be taken not to give plants
I too much water especially during the
winter Those who have ferns to keep
through the winter in rooms should try
the plan of keeping them cool without
allowing the frost to reach them and
to keep th roots from getting too
much ocrat moisture St Louis GlobeDem

I Concerning Pronunciation
An Englishman who has been visit I
Ing In Chicago says It Is very amusing
to listen t the American ridicule of
j Englishmen for pronouncing Cholmon
deley j Chumley Beauchamp Bee
cham ele In England he declares
IYou will find as a rule that people
1 pronounce Massachusetts Masatch
azettes Absurd Of course It Is but
how are you going to tell The rule
by which i is pronounced Massachu
setts is purely arbitrary The most
curious of all your pronunciations are
perhaps the adapted French names
How in the name of the eternal fitness
of thfngs do you get Soo Saint Mary
out of Sault Ste Marie Tery Hut
for Terre Haute is just a HUe worse
It is unaccountable too how you came
to call Prairie du Chlen Prairie doo
Sheen Of course you have a right to
arrange your own pronunciation but
give us the same liberty We at least
have the txcuse that our names are
ten or fifteen centuries old and have

They were supplied with a loaf of

for them in the waiting room and that
they were welcome to stay Until morn

themselves the boys began to mistrust I
that they were to be shipped back to
Salt Lake and wanted to leave but
were kept by force Duringthe time
that the agent was conversing with
them he was also telegraphing to the
police station in Salt Lake city When
the boys saw that they were captured
they gave vent to their feelings by
crying Their names were Samuel

The daring gang of burglars that
has made this camp the scene of oper
ations for several months have not
been idle this week Sunday night
about 8 oclock they held a man up in
the alley back of the Oxford saloon
and relieved him of an overcoat and
some articles of value On the follow
ing night several chicken roosts were
touched for thanksgiving treasures
and then thanlsgin night by
breaking into the car on the sidetrack
of the Rio Grande Western which was
almost filled with merchandise from
the Tucker Wallace stock and
helped themselves quite liberally Mr
Dunning estimates the loss at about
51500 the burglars having made a
careful selection from the finest shirts
underwear and clothing They also
took the contents of the jewelry case
and damaged some line shirts by
tramping upon them Suspicion points
to several parties but as yet the
officers have no positive clue to work
upon The loss will fall upon the rail
way company and they will doubtless
sift Miner the matter thoroughly Tintic
