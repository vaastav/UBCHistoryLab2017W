THE MESSAGE
or
President Hayes to the Second Session
of the Forty-Second Congress,
Delivered at 12 O'clock
Monday, Dec. 6.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of
Bepresentatives: I congratulate you on the
continued and increasing prosperity of oar
•country. By the favor of Divine Providence
we have been blessed daring the past year with
health, with abundant harvests, with profit*
able employment for all onr people and with
contentment at home and friendship with
other nations.
The occurrence of the twentyfonrth election
of achief magistrate has afforded another oppor­
tunity to the people of the United States to ex­
hibit to the world a significant example of the
transmission of the power and
authority of the government from
public servants, whose terms of office
are about to expire, to their newly chosen suc­
cessors. This example cannot fail to impress
profoundly the thoughtful people of other
countries with the advantages which republi­
can institutions afford. The immediate, gen­
eral and cheerfal acquiescence of all good citi­
zens in the result of the election gives gratify­
ing assurance to oar country and its friends
throughout the world that the government
based on the free consent of an intelligent and
patriotic people possesses elements of strength,
stability and permanency, not found in any
other form of government.
SUFFTAGE.
Continued opposition to the full and free en­
joyment of the rights of citizenship conferred
upon colored people by the recent amendments
to the constitution, still prevails in several of
the late slave-holding States. It has, perhaps,
not been manifested in the recent election to
any large extent by acts of violence or intimi­
dation. It haB, however, by fraudulent prac­
tices in connection with ballots, with regula­
tions as to the places and manner of voting and
with counting the returns and canvassing the
votes cast, been successful in defeating
the exercise of the right preservative of all
rights, the right of suffrage, which the consti­
tution expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens. It is the desire of good people of the
whole country that sectionalism as a fact or in
politics should disappear. They prefer that
no section of the country should be united in
solid opposition to any other
section. The disposition to refuse
prompt and hearty obedience to
the eqaal rights amendments to the consti­
tution is all that now stands in the way of a
complete obliteration of sectional lines in our
political contests. As long as either of these
amendments is flagrantly violated or disre­
garded it is safe to assume that the people who
placed them in the constitution as embodying
the legitimate results of the war for the Un­
ion, or who believe them to be wise and neces­
sary, will continue to act together
and to inBiBt that they shall be
obeyed. The parmount question
still is as to the enjoyment of the right by every
American eitizen who has the requisite qalifi
cations to freely cast his vote, and have it hon­
estly counted. With this question rightly set­
tled the country will be assured the conten­
tions of past bygones will indeed be by­
gones, and political and party issues with re­
spect to economy and efficiency of administra­
tion, internal improvements, the tariff, domes­
tic taxation, education, finance and other im­
portant subjeata will then receive their full
Bhare of attention. But resistance to and
nullification of the. results of the war
will unite together in resolute purpose for
their support, all who maintain the authority
of the government and the perpetuity of the
Union and who adequately appreciate the
value of the victory achieved. This deter­
mination proceeds from no hostile sentiment
or feeling to any part of the people of our
country, or to any of their interests. The
inviolability of the amendments rest upon the
fundamental principles of our govern­
ment. They are the solemn
expressions of the will of the
people of the United States. The sentiment
that the constitutional rights of all our citi­
zens must be maintained does not grow weaker.1
It will continue to control tbe government of
the country. Happily, tbe history of the late
election shows that iu many parts of the coun­
try where opposition to the fifteenth amend­
ment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminish­
ing, and is likely to cease altogether if firm and
well considered action is taken by Congress. I
trust the Houje of Representatives and tbe
Senate, which have the right to judge of tbe
elections, returns and qualifications of
their own members, ipill see to it
that every case of violation of the letter or
spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thorough­
ly investigated, and that no benefit from such
violation shall accrue to any person or party.
It will be tbe duty of the exeoutive, with suf­
ficient appropriations for the purpose, to prose­
cute unsparingly all who have been engaged in
depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to
them by the constitution.
It is not,however,to be forgotten that the best
and surest guarantee of the primary
citizenship
iB
rightB
of
to be found in that capacity for
self-protection, which can only belong to a peo­
ple whose right to universal suffrage is sup
ported by personal education. The resources
at the command of local and State authorities
are in many cases wholly inadequate to furnish
free instruction to all who need it. This is
especially true, where before emancipation the
education of the people was negleoted or pre­
vented in the interests of slavery. I am firmly
convinced that the subject of popular education
deserves the earnest attention of the. people of
this country, with a view to wise and compre­
hensive action by the government
of the United States. I respectfully
recommend that Congress by suitable legisla­
tion and with proper regulations supplement
the local educational funds in tbe several
gtates where the grave duties and responsibili­
ties of citizenship have been devolved on un­
educated people, by devoting to the purpose
grants of the public lands, and if necessary, by
appropriations from the treasury of the United
Btates what else the government can fairly do
to promote free popular education ought to be
done. Wherever general education is found
peace, virtue and social order prevail and civil
and religious liberty are secured.
OITHi SEBYICB KEFOBM.
In my former annual messages I have asked
the attention of Congress to the urgent neces­
sity of a reformation of the civil service) sys­
tem of tbe government. My views concerning
the dangers of patronage or appointment for
personal or partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and expe­
rience in the executive office,and I belieye these
dangers threaten the stability of the govern*
ment. Abuses so serious in their nature can­
not be permanently tolerated. They tend to
become more alarming with the enlargement of
the administrative seivice, as the growth of
the country in population increases the num­
ber of officers and placemen employed. -The
reasons are imperative for the adoption of
fixed rules for tbe regulation of appointments,
promotions and removals by establishing
a uniform method having exclusively in view
in every instance the attainment of best quali­
fications for the position in question. Such a
method alone iB consistent with the equal rifchts
of all citizens and tbe most economical and ef­
ficient administration of the public business.
Competitive examinations in aid of impartial
appointments and promotions have been con­
ducted for some years past in several of the
executive departments, and by my direction
this system has been adopted in the custom
houses and postoffices of the larger cities of
the country. In New Jfork city over 2,000 po­
sitions in the civil service have been subject
in their appointments and tenure of
i' place to the operations of the
.published rules for this purpose the
paat
vwo years. The results ot these practical
trials have been very satisfactory, and have
^confirmed my opinion in favor of the system
of selection. All are subjected to the same
iteete and the result is free from prejudice by
-personal furor or partisan influence. It se­
cures for the position applied for the beat
qualifications attainable among the oompeting
applicants. It is an effectual protection from
tbe pressure of importunity, which, under any
other course pursued, largely exaots the time
and attention of appointing officers, to their
great detriment in the discharge of
other official dutiea. It prevents the abuse of
the service for the mere fnrtherenoe of private
or party purposes and leaves the employe of
the government, freed from the obligations
imposed by patronage, to depend solely on
merit for retention and advancement, and with
this constant incentive to advancement and
improvement. These invaluable Results have
been attained in a high degree in the offices
where tbe rules for appointment by competi­
tive examination have been applied. As
shown by experimental trial it may be fairly
considered conclusive that the system should
be extended to all subordinate positions under
the government. I believe that a strong and
growing public sentiment demands immediate
measures for securing and enforcing the
highest positive effioienoy in the eivil service
and its protection from recognized abuses,
and that the experience referred to has demon­
strated the feasibility of such measures. The
examinations in cos
torn houses and postoffises
have been held under many embarrassments
and without provision for compensation for the
extra labor performed by the officers who have
conducted them, and whose commendable
interest in improvement of tbe public service
has induced this devotion of time and labor
without pecuniary reward. A continuance of
these labors gratuitously onght not to be ex
peoted, and without an appropriation
by Congress for compensation it is
not practicable to extend the system of
examination throughout the civil service. It
is highly important that all Buch examinations
should be conducted upon a uniform system
and under general supervision. Section 1,753
of the revised statutes authorizes the President
to prescribe the regulations for admission to
the civil service of the United States, and for
this purpose to employ suitable persona to con­
sider the requisite inquiries with reference to
the fitness of each candidate in respect to age,
health, character, knowledge and ability for
the branch of service into which he seeks to
enter, but the law is practically inoperative for
the want of requisite appropriations.
Therefore, I recommend an ap­
propriation of $25,000 per annum to
meet the expenses of a commission to be
appointed by tbe President, in accordance
with the terms of this Bection, whose duly it
shall be to devise a just, uniform and efficient
system of competitive examination! and to su­
pervise the application of the same through­
out the entire civil service of the government.
1 am persuaded that tbe facilities which Buch
a commission will afford for testing the
fitness of those who apply for office will not
only be as welcome a relief to members of Con
cress as it will be to the President
and headB of departments, but that
it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of
embarrassment which now inevitably and con­
stantly attend the conflicting claims of patron­
age between the legislative and executive de­
partments. The most effectual check upon the
pernicious competition of influence and offi­
cial favoritism in the bestowal of office, will be
the substitution of an open competition of
merit between tbe applicants, in which every
one can make his own record with the assurance
that his success will depend upon this alone.
I also recommend such legislation, as, while
leaving every officer free
SB
any other citizen to
express his political opinions, and to use his
means for their advancement, Bhall also enable
him to feel as safe as any private citizen in re­
fusing deouands on his salary for political pur­
poses. A law whiob Bhould thus guarantee true
liberty and justice to all who are engaged in
the public service, and likewise contain string­
ent provisions against the use of official author­
ity to coerce the political action of private cit­
izens or of official subordinates, iB greatly to be
desired.
The most serious obstacle, however, to an
improvement of civil service, and especially to
a reform in the method of appointment and
removal, has beea found to be the practice un­
der what is known as the spoils system, by
which the appointing power has been so largely
encroached on by members of Congress. The
first step in the reform of the civil service must
be a complete divorce between Congress and
the exeoutive in the matter of appointments.
The corrupting doctrine that "to the victor
belong the spoils" is inseparable from Congres­
sional patronage. As the established rule and
practice of parties in power it comeB to be un­
derstood by applicants for offices and by tbe
people generally that Representatives and Sen­
ators are entitled to disburse the patronage of
their respective districts and States. It is not
necessary to recite at length the evils resulting
from thiB perversion of the executive func­
tions. The true principles of government on
the subiect of appointments to office, as stated
in the national oonventionB of the leading par­
ties of the country, have again and again been
approved by the American people and. have
not been called in question in any quarter.
TheBe authentic expressions of public opinion
upon this all important subject are the state­
ment of principles that belong to the consti­
tutional structure of the government. Under
the constitution, the President and beads of
departments are to make nominations for of­
fice, the Senate is to confirm the appointments
and the House of Bepresentatives is to
accuse and prosecute faithless officers. Tbe best
interest of the public service demands that
these distinctions be respected, and that Sena­
tors and Bepresentatives who may be judges
and accusers should not dietate appointments
to office. To this end the cooperation of .the
legislative department of the government is
required, alike by tbe necessities of the case
and by public opinion. Members of Congress
will not be relieved from the demands made
upon them with reference to appointments to
office until by legislative enactment the per­
nicious practice is condemned and ferbidden.
It is, therefore. recommended that
an act be passed defining tbe re­
lations of members of Congress
with respect to appointment to office by the
President, and I also recommend that the
provisions of section 1767 and of tbe sections
following of tbe revised statutes, comprising
the term-of-office act of March 2, 1867, be re­
pealed. Believing that to reform the system
and methods of the civil service in our conn
try is one of the highest and moat imperative
duties of statesmanship and that it can be
permanently done only by the co-operation of
the legislative and executive depart­
ments of the government, I again commend
the whole subject to your considerate atten­
tion.
POLYGAMY.
It is the recognized duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to suppress poly­
gamy where it now exists in Utah Territory and
to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous
efforts have been made by the United States
officers in Utah to enforce the laws against it.
Experience has Bhown that legislation upon
this subject, to be effective, requires extensive
moaincanon ana amendment, xne longer
action is delayed the more difficult it will be to
accomplish what is desired. Prompt and
decided measures are necessary. The Mormon
sectarian organization which upholdB polygamy,
has the whole power of making and executing
the local legislation of the Territory. By its
oontrol of-the grand and petit jurors it poetesses
large influence over the administration of jus­
tice. Exercising, as tbe beads of this sect do,
the local political power of the Territory, they
are able to make effective their hostility to the
laws of Congie3s ocjche subject of polygamy and
in faot do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy
will not be abolished if the enforcement of
law depends those who practice and up­
hold the crime. It can only be suppressed by
taking away the political power of the sect
which encourages and sustains it. The powers
of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect
the Territories.is ample. It is not a case for
half-way measures. The politioal power of
the Mormon sect is increasing. It controls now
one of our wealthiest and most populous Ter­
ritories. It is extending Bteadily into
other Territories. Wherever it goes it estab­
lishes polygamy and sectarian political power.
The sanctity of marriage and family relations
are the corner atones of American society and
civilization. Beligious liberty and the separ­
ation of church and state are among the ele­
mentary ideas of free institutions. Tore-es­
tablish the interests and principles which po­
lygamy and Mormonism have imperilled, and
to nlly reopen to intelligent and virtuous im­
migrants of all other creeds the Territory
closed to general immigration, by intolerant
and immoral institutions, it is recommended
that the government of the Territory of Utah
should be reorganized. I recommend that
Congress provide for the government of Utah
by a governor and judges or commissioners,
appointed by the President and confirmed by
the Senate—a .government analog
eons to
tbe provisional government established
for the territory northwest of Ohio
by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is
deemed best to continue tbe existing local
form of government I recommend that the
right to vote, hold office and Bit on juries in
the Territory of Utah be confined to those who
neither practice nor uphold polygomy. If
thorough measures are adopted it is believed
that within' a few years the evils which now
afflict Utah will be eradicated, and this Terri­
tory will in good time become one of the most
prosperous and attractive of the new States of
the Union.
FPBEION BEDAUONH.
Onr relations with all foreign countries have
been those of undisturbed peace and have pre­
sented no occasion for concern as to their con­
tinued manintenanoe. My anticipation of an
early reply from the British government to
the demand of indemnity to our fishermen for
injuries suffered by that mduBtry at Fortune
Bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in
my last annual message, was disappointed.
This answer was received only in the latter
part of April in the present year, and when
received exhibited a failure of accord between
the two governments as to the measure of tbe
inshore fishing privileges secured to our fisher­
men by the treaty of Washington, of
so serious a character that I made it the
subjeot of a communication to Congress in
which I recommended the adoption of meas­
ures which seemed to me proper to be taken
ly this government in maintenance of the
rights accorded to onr fishermen under the
treaty and toward securing an indemnity for
the injnry these interests had suffered. A
bill to carry ont these recommendations
was under consideration by tbie House of Bep­
resentatives at the time of the adjournment of
CongresB in June last.
Within a few weeks I have received a com­
munication from her majesty's government re­
viewing the consideration of [the subject, both
of the indemnity for injuries at Fortune Bay
and of the interpretation of the treaty, in
which the previous correspondence bad shown
the two governments to be at variance.
Upon both these topics the disposition
towards a friendly agreement is manifested by
a lecognition of our right to an indemnity for
the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving tbe
measure of such indemnity to further confer­
ence and by an assent to the views of this gov­
ernment, presented in a previons correspond­
ence, that the regulation of conflicting inter­
ests of the shore fishing of the provincial sea
coasts and the vessel fishing of our fishermen
should be made the Bubject of conference and
concurrent arrangement between the two gov­
ernments. I sincerely hope that the basis
may be found for a speedy adjustment of the
very serious divergence of viewH in the inter­
pretation of the fishery clause of the treaty
of Washington, which, as the correspond­
ence between the two governments
stood at the close of the last session of Con­
gress seemed to be irreconcilable.
In the important exhibition of arts and in­
dustries which was held last year at Sydney,
New Sonth Wales, as well as in that now in
progress at Melbourne, the United States have
been efficiently and honorably represented.
The exhibitora from this country at the former
place received a large number of awards in
some of the most considerable departments,
and the participation of the United 8tates was
recognized by a special mark of distinction. In
the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by
our country is no less notable, and an equal
degree cf success is confidently expected.
The state of peace and tranquility now en­
joyed by all tbe nations of the continent of
Europe has its favorable influence upon our
diplomatic and commercial relations with them.
We have concluded and ratified a convention
with the French republic for settlement of the
claims of citizens of either country against the
other. Under this convention, a commission,
presided over by a distinguished publicist, ap­
pointed in pursuance of the request of
both nations by bis majesty the emperor
of Brazil, has been organized and has begun itB
sessions in this city.
A Congress to consider meanB for the protec­
tion of industrial prosperity has recently been
in session in Paris, to which I have appointed
the ministers of the United States in France
and Belgium as delegates. The constitutional
commissions upon weights and measures also
continues its work in PariB. I invite your atten­
tion to the necessity of appropriations to be
made in time to enable this government to ful­
fill its obligations under the metrical conven­
tion.
Our friendly relations with tbe German em­
pire continne without interruption. At the
recent international exhibition of fish and
fisheries at- Berlin the participation of the
United StateB, notwithstanding the baste in
which the commission was forced to make
preparations, was extremely successful and
meritorious, winning private exhibitors nu­
merous awards of high class, and for the coun­
try at large, the principal prize of honor offered
by biB majesty the emperor. The results of
this great succeBB cannot bat be advantageous
to thiB important and growing industry.
There have been some questions raised between
tbe two governments as to tbe proper effect
and interpretation of our treaties of nat­
uralization, but recent dispatches from
our minister at Berlin show that favorable
progress is making toward an understanding
in accordance with the views of this govern­
ment, whiob makes and admits no distinction
whatever between the rights of a native and a
naturalization citizen of the United States. In
practice the complaints of molestations Buf­
fered by naturalized citizens abroad have never
been fewer.
There is nothing of importance to note in our
unbroken friendly relations with the govern­
ments of AuBtna, Hungary, Russia, Portugal,
Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and
Greece.
During the last summer several vessels be­
longing to the merchant marine of this coun­
try sailing in natural waters of the West Indies
were fired at, boarded and searched
by an armed cruiser of the Span­
ish government. Tbe circumstances,
as reported, involve not only private injury to
tbe persons concerncd. but also seemed too
little observant of tbe friendly relations exist­
ing for a century between this country and
Spain. The wrong was brought to the atten­
tion of the Spanish government in a serious
protest and remonstrance, and the matter is
undergoing investigation by the royal authori­
ties, with a view to sach explanation or repara­
tion as may be called for by the facts. The
commission Bitting in this city for the adjudi­
cation of claims of oar citizens against
the government of Spain is, I hope,
approaching tbe termination of its labors. The
claims against the United States nnder the
Florida treaty with Spain were Bnbmitted to
CongresB for its action at the late session. I
again invite your attention to this long stand­
ing question, with a view to a disposition of
the matter.
At invitation of the Spanish government a
conference has recently been held at the city of
Madrid to consider the subject of protection
by foreign powers of native Moors in the em­
pire of Morocco. Ibe minister of the United
States in Spain was directed to take part in the
deliberations of this conference, the result of
which ia a convention signed ou behalf of the
powers represented. The instrument will be
laid before the Senate for its consideration.
Tbe government of the United States has also
lost no opportunity to urge upon that of the
emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accord­
ance with the humane and established spirit
of the age, of putting an end to the persecu­
tions which have been so potent in that conn-,
try of persons of a faith other than Moslem
and especially of Hebrew residents of Mo
rooco.
The oonsular treaty concluded with Belgium
has not been yet officially promulgated, owing
to the alteration of a word in the text by tbe
Senate of the United States, which occasioned
a delay, during which the time allowed for
ratification expired. The Senate will be asked
to extend the period for ratification.
The at tempt to negotiate a treaty of extra­
dition with Denmark failed, on account of the
objection of the Danish. government to the
clause providing that each nation should pay
the expense of the arrest of persona whose ex­
tradition it makes.
The provision made by Congress at its last
session for the expense of the commission
which had been appointed to enter upon nego­
tiations with the imperial government of
China, an a subject of great interest to the
two countries, enabled the commissioners
to prooeed at once upon their
mission. The imperial government
waa prepared to give prompt and
respectable attention to the matters brought
under negotiation and tbe conferences proceed­
ed with such rapidity and success that on the
17th of November last two treaties were signed
at Pekin, one relating to the introduction of
Chinese into this country and one relating to
commerce. Mr. Trescott, one of the commia
siorers, is now on bis way, bringing the treat­
ies and it is expected that they will be receiv­
ed in time to be laid before the Senate early in
January.
Oar minister in Japan has negotiated a con
vention|for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked
persons. I take occasion to urge once more
upon Congress the propriety
of making provisions for the erection of
suitable fire proof buildings at the Japanese
capital for the use of the American legation
and the court house and jail connected with it.
The Japanese government with great generosi­
ty and courtesy haB offered for the purpose an
eligible pieoe of land.
In my last annual message I invited the at­
tention of Congress to tbe subject of the in­
demnity funds reoeived some years ago from
China and Japan. I renew the recommenda­
tion then made that whatever portions of
these funds are doe to American citizens
Bhould be promptly paid and the residue re­
turned to the nations respectively to which
they justly and equitably belong.
Tbe extradition treaty with the kingdom of
the Netherlands, which has been for wme time
in course of negotiation, has, during tbe
paBt
year, been concluded and duly ratified.
Belations of friendship and amity have been
established between the government of the
United States and that of Roumania. We have
Bent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest
and have received at this capital tbe special
envoy, who has been charged by His Boyal
Highness Prince Charles, to announce the in­
dependent sovereignty of Boumania. and we
nope for a speedy development of commercial
relations between the two countries.
In my last annual message I expressed the
hope that tbe prevalence of quiet on the border
between this country and Mexico, would soon
become
BO aBBured
as to juBtify tbe modifica­
tion of tbe orders then in force, to our mili­
tary commanders in regard to crossing the
frontier, without encouraging such distur­
bances as would endanger the peace of the two
countries. Events moved in accordance with
these expectations and the orders were accord­
ingly withdrawn to the entire satisfaction of
our own citizens and the Mexican government.
Subsequently tbe peace of tbe border was
again disturbed by a savage foray under the
command of tbe Chief Victoria, but by the con­
tinued and harmonious action of the military
forces of botb countries, his band has been
broken and substantially destroyed. There is
reason to believe that the obstaoles which have
BO
long prevented rapid and convenient com­
munication between the United States and
Mexico by railways are on the point of disap­
pearing and that several important enterprises
of this character will soon be Bet on foot,
which can not fail to contribute largely to the
prosperity of both countries.
New envoys from Gutamala, Colombia,
Bolivia,Venezuela and Nicuragua have recently
arrived at this capital, whose distinction ana
enlightenment afford the best guarantee of the
continuance of friendly relations between our­
selves and these siBter Republics.
INTEB-OCEANIC CANAL.
The relations between this government and
that of tbe United Statea of Columbia have en­
gaged public attention during the past year,
mainly by reason of tba project of an inter
oceanic canal across the Isthmus, of Panama to
be built by private capital, under a concession
from the Columbian government for that pur­
pose. The treaty obligations subsisting be­
tween tbe United States of Columbia and the
United StateB, by which we guarantee the
nutrality of the transit and the sovereignty
and property of Columbia in the IsthmuB,
make it necessary that the conditions
nnder which
BO
stupendous
a change in the region embraced in this guar­
antee Bhould be effected—transforming, as it
would, this iBthmus from a barrier between the
Atlantio and Pacific oceans, into a gateway and
thoroughfare between them, for the navies and
merchant ships of the world—Bhould receive
the approval of this government, as being com­
patible with the discharge of these obligations
on our part, and consistent with
our interests as the principal com­
mercial power of the western hemisphere.
The views which I expressed in a special meB
sa^ to Congress in Mareh last, in relation to
tbis project, I deem it my duty again to
pteBs
on your attention. Subsequent consideration
has but confirmed the opinion that it is the
right and duty of the United Statea to assert
and maintain
Buob
supervision and authority
over any interoceanic canal across the IBthmus
tbat connects North and South America, and as
W3ll protect onr national interest.
Tbe war between tbe republic of Chilli
on tbe one band and the allied republics of
Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues.
ThiB government has not felt called on to inter­
fere in a contest that is within the belligerent
rights of the parties as independent States.
We have, however, always held ourselves in
readiness to aid in accommodating their differ­
ence and have at different times reminded both
belligerents of our willingness to render such
services. Oar good officers in this direetion
were recently accepted by all the
belligerents, and it was hoped they would prove
efficacious. But I regret to announce that the
measures which the ministers of the United
States at Santiago and Lima were authorized
to take, with the view to bring about a peace,
were not successful. In tbe course of the war
some questions have arisen affecting neutral
rightB. In all of these the ministers of tbe
United States have, under their instructions,
acted with promptness and energy in protec­
tion of American interests.'
The relations of the United States with tbe
empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial,
and their commercial intercourse steadily in­
creases, to their mutual advantage.
Tbe internal disorders with whioh the Argen­
tine Republic has for some time past been
afflicted, and whiob have, more or less, influ­
enced its external trade, are understood to have
been brought to a close. Tbis happy result
may be expeoted to redound to the benefit of
tbe foreign commerce of that republic, as well
as to the development of its vast interior re­
sources.
In Samoa the government of King Malietoa
under the support and recognition of the con­
sular repesentativeB of the United States, Great
Britain and Germany, seems to have given
peace and tranquility to the islands. While it
does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole
the scheme of a tripartite local government
which has been proposed, the common in­
terests of the three great treaty powers require
harmony in their true relations to the native
frame of government and this may be best
secured by a simple diplomatic agreement be­
tween them. It would be well if tbe consular
jurisdiction of our representative atTopia were

In pursuance of the act passed at the last
session of Congress, invitations have been ex­
tended to foreign maritime states to join in a
sanitary conference in Washington, beginning
the 1st of January. The acceptance of this in­
vitation by many prominent powers gives
promise of success in this important measure
Resigned to establish a system of international
notification by which the spread of infections
or epidemic diseases may be -more effectively
counteracted or prevented. The attention of
Congress is invited to the necessary appropria­
tions for carrying into effect, the provisions of
the act referred to.
oca comnmoc.
Tbe efforts of the department of state to en­
large the trade and oommeroe of the United
States through the aotive agency of consular
officers and through the dissemination of in­
formation obtained from them, have been unre
laxed. Tbe intereat in these efforts,
as developed in our commercial com­
munities and the value of the in­
formation secured by this means to the
trade and manufacturers of the oountry, were
recognized by Congress at its last session, and
provision waa made for the more frequent
publication of consular and other reports by
the department of state. The first issue of
this publication has now been prepared, and
subsequent issues may regularly be expeoted.
The importance and interest attached to the
reports of oonsular officers are witnessed by
tbe general demand for them by all classes of
merchants and manufacturers engaged in our
foreign trade. It is believed that the system
of such publication is deserving of the ap­
proval of Congress and that the necessity of
appropriations for its oontinuance and en­
largement will commend itself to your con­
sideration.
The pursuit of domestio industrious and
their immense production of subjects of for­
eign commerce invite and even require an
active development of the wishes and inter­
ests of our people in that direction. Espec­
ially important is it that our commercial rela­
tions with the Atlantio and Pacific coasts of
South Amerioa, with the West Indies and the
Gulf of Mexioo, should be direct and not
not through a cirouit of the European systems,
and Bhould be carried on ia our own bottoms.
The full appreciation of the opportunities
which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to
commerce with Japan, China and the East In­
dies, with Australia and the island groups
whioh belong to thete routes of navigation,
should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to
oar own interest and administer to our own
capital a due portion of thiB trade. Whatever
modification of our method of trade and navi­
gation may be necessary or useful to meet and
direct to the enlargement of our exchange and
our carrying interest, I am Bare members of
Congress will be ready to Bapply. One initial
measure, however, seemB to me so clearly use­
ful and efficient that I venture to press it upon
your earlieBt attention. It seems to be very
evident tbat the provision of regular Bteam
post communication by aid from governments
has been the forerunner of the commercial
prominence o£ Great Britain in all the sea
coasts, and these coasts and
seaB,
a greater
share of whose trade is now the deBire and in­
tent of our people. It is also manifest that
tbe efforts of other European nations to con­
tend with Great Britain for a share of this
commerce has b°en snce»«*sfnl in proportion to
their adoption ot regular steam postal com­
munication with the markets wtiose trade they
Bought. Mexico and the statics of South
America are anxious to receive such postal
communications with this country and to aid
in their development. Similar co-operation
may be looked for in due time from the east­
ern nations and from Australia. It ia difficult
to see bow tbe lead in that movement
can be expeeted from private inter­
ests in respect of foreign commerce.
Quite as much, an international
trade postal communication seems necessarily
a matter of common and pnblic administration,
and thus pertaining to the government. I re­
spectfully recommend to your prompt atten­
tion such juBt and efficient measures as may
conduce to the development of our foreign
commercial exchanges, and the building up of
our carrying trade.
In thiB connection I desire also to suggest
the very great service which might be expected
in enlarging and facilitating onr commerce on
the Pacific ocean were a transmarine cable laid
from San Francisco to tbe Sandwich
Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and
Australia at the south. The great infinence of
Bnch
meanB
of communication on these routes
of navigation in developing and securing the
due share of our Pacific coaet in the commerce
of the world, needs no interpretation or en.
forcement. It may be that such an enterprise
is useful and in the end profitable, as it would
prove to private investment, may need to be
accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress
in
its aid, and I submit the matter to your
careful consideration.
An additional and not unimportant although
secondary reason for iostering and enlarging
the navy may be found in tbe unquestionable
service to the expansion of our commerce,
which would be rendered by the frequent cir­
culation of naval ships in the seas and portB
jf all quarters of the globe. Ships of the pro­
per construction and equipment" to be of the
greatest efficiency in case of maratime war
might be made constant and aotive agents in
time of peace in tbe advancement
»nd protection of our foreign
trade and in the nurture and diBoipline of
young seamen who would naturally in some
numbers mix with and improve the crews of
our merchant ships. Our merobants at home
rod abroad recognize the value to foreign
tommerce of an active movement of our na­
val vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic
seal of our naval officers in promoting every in
terest of their countrymen ia a juat subject of
natural pride.
THE FINANCES.
The condition of the financial affairs of tbe
government, as shown by the report of the
secretary of the treasury, is very satisfactory,
[t is believed that the present financial situa­
tion of the United States, whether considered
with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing
wealth, or the extent and variety of our re
rouroes, is more favorable than
that of any other country of
our time, and |haa never been surpassed
by any other country at any period of its his­
tory. All our industries are thriving. The
rate of interest is low new railroads are being
constructed a vast immigration is increasing
Dur population, capital and labor new enter­
prises in great number are in progress, and our
commercial relations with other oountries are
Improving.

Tbe amount due the sinking fund for this
year was $87,931,643.55. There was applied
thereto the sum of $73,90#,617.41, being
$35,982,97286, an excess of the actual::
requirementa for the year.
The aggregate of revenues from all sources
during tbe fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, waa
$333,526,610.98, an increase over the preoeeding
year of $59 699,426.52. The receipts thus far
of the current ear together with the estimated
receipts for the remainder of the year, amount
to $330,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet
the estimated expenditures of the year, and
leave a surplus of $90,000,000.
It is fortunate that this large surplus of rev­
enues occurs at a period when it may be ap­
plied to the payment of the public debt soon
redeemable. No public duty has been more
constantly cherished in the United States than
tbe policy of paying the nation's debt as rapid­
ly as possible. The debt of the United
States, less cash in the treasury, and exclusive
of aocruing interest, attained its maximum of
$2,756,431,57L.43 in August. 1865. and bassinco
been reduced to $1,S90,025,740.89, the princi­
pal of the debt $108,755,100 has been paid
since March 1st, 1877, effeoting an annual sav«
ing of
Bix
to seven millions*.
This burden of interest has also
been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing
a low rate of interest, and the application ofi
the prooeeds in redemption of bonds bearing
a higher rate. The annnal saving thus so*
cured since March 1st, 1877, is $14,290,453.50*
Within a short period over six hondred mil*
lions of five and six per cent, bonds will be«i
come redeemable. ThiB presents a very favoi
able opportunity not only to reduce the priih
cipal of the debt, but alse to reduce tbe rate
interest on tbat which will remain un
I call the attention of Congress to the viewi
expressed on this subject by the secretary o:
the treasury in his annual report, and reoom*
mend prompt legislation to enable tbe treasury!
department to complete the refunding of the
debt whioh is about to mature.
The continuance of apecie payment has no|
been interrupted or endangered since 'the data
of resumption. It has contributed greatly tai
the revival of business and to our remarkablo
prosperity, Tbe fears that precededed and ao»
companiea resumption have proved ground**
lees. No considBrable amount of United State*
notes have -been presented for redemption,
while very large sums of gold bgrilion, botb
domestic and imported, are taken Yo the minta'
and exchanged for coin or notes. Tbe increase
ot cein and bullion in tbe United States sinoo
January 1st, 1879, is estimated at $227,399,428*
There are still in existence, unconceled,
1346,281,016 of the United States legal tendev
notes. These notes were authorized as a wa#
measure made necessary by tbe ex,
[gencies of the conflict in whioh the United
States was then engaged. The preservation of
tbe nation's existence required, in tbe judg*
ment of Congress, an issue of legal tender
paper money. Tbat it served well the purposQ
for which it was created, is not questioned, but
tbe employment of the notes as paper money
indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the
object for whioh they were provided, was not
contemplated by the framers of the law undea
whiob they were issued. These notes long
ftince became like any other pecuniary obliga*'
tion of tbe government, a debt to be paid, and
when paid to be canceled aB mere evidence of
an indebtedness no longer existing. I there*
fore repeat what was said in the annual meu
sage of last year, tbat the retirement fron^j
circulation of United States notes, with the
capacity of legal tender in private contracts,
is a step to be taken in our progress towards a
safe and stable currency, which should be ao^
cepted as tbe policy and duty of the govern*
xientand tbe intereat and security of thfr
people.
At the time of the past age of the act now iiv
force requiring the coinage of silver dollars.
fixing their value and giving them a legal tenV
der character, it was believed by many sup^J
porters of the measure that the silver doUaiu
which it authorized would speedily become^!
under the operations of the law, of equivalent'
value to the gold dollar. There wete otheg
supporters of the bill who, while they doubted,,
as to the probability of this result, neverthelem
were willing to give the proposed experiment
a fair trial with a view to stop the coinage it
experience should prove the silver dolt
lar authorized by the bill continu
to be of less commercial value than the stai
dard gold dollar. The coinage of silvi
dollars under the act referred to began iq
March, 1878, and has been continued as require
ed by the act. The average rate per month tq
the present time has been $2,276,492. The
total amount coined prior to the 1st of Novenw
ber last was $72,847,750. Of this amount 947^
081,450 remains in the treasury apd only $25fl
763,291 are in the bands of tbe people. A oon*
stant effort has been made to keep th:s ourren\
cy in circulation and considerable expensqj]
has been necessarily inonrred fag.
this purpose but its return to
the treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary
the confident anticipation of the friends of thi
measure at the time of its adoption, the value
of the silver dollar containing 412% grains of
silver has not inoreased. During tbe
prior to the passage of the bill authorizing
coinage tbe market value of the silver whioh
contained was from ninety to ninety-two cento,
as compared with the stanf
ard gold dollar. During the last year the avi
age market value of the silver dollar has
eighty-eight and one-balf cents. It is obvt\
ous tbat tbe legislation of tbe last Congress intj
regard to silver so far aa
it was based on an anticipated
rise in the value of silver as a result of that
legislation,has failed to produce the effect then
predicted. The longer the law remains in
force requiring as it does the coinage of a nom*
inal dollar, which in reality is not a dollar, tho
greater becomes tbe danger tbat this count
will be first to accept a single metal as tbe
legal standard of value in circulation, and t]
a Btandard of less value than it purports to
worth in tbe recognized money of tbe worl
The constitution of the United Stater, sound
financial principles, and our best interests aQ
require that the country should hav^
as its legal tender money boffc
gold and silver coin of an intrinsic value
bullion, equivalent to that which upon its faj
it purports to possess. The constitution
express terms recognizee botb gold and silve*
as the only true legal tender money, To
banish either of these metals from our cum
cy is to narrow or limit the circulating meai*
um of exchange to the disparagement of
portant interests. The United States produ
moie silver then any other country and is
rectly interested in maintaining it as one o:
the two precious metals whioh furnish
coinage of the world. It will in my judgm
contribute to this result if Congress will
peal so much of the existii
legislation as requires the coinage of silra
dollars containing only 412^ grains of silvet
and in its stead will authorize.the secretary
the treasury to coin silver dollars of equiva-i
lent value as bullion with gold dollars. TT
will defraud no man and will be in accordant
with familiar precedents. Congress, on si
eral occasions, has altered' the ratio
value between gold and silver, in order to
tablish it mere nearly in accordance with tl
actual rate of value between the two metals. I
'I
In financial legislation every measure in tlMj
direotion of greater fidelity in the discharge oq
pecuniary obligations has been found by ex«
perience to determine the rate of interest debt-,
ore have to pay and to increase the facility]
with which money can be obtained for evenj
legitimate purpose. Our own recent finanoiu!'
-history shows how' surely money beoomW!
abundant whenever confidence in the exact
performance of moneyed obligations is estab­
lished.
SHE WAB DEPARTMENT.
The secretary ot war reports that the expend
ditnres of the war department for the fiscal
year ended June 80,1880, were $39,924,773.08,,
The appropriations for this department for tho
ervice year amount to $£1,998,630.40. WW
espect to tbe army the secretary invites atteis*,
tion to the fact that its strength is limited by
section 115, revised statute 19, to not more than
80,000 enlisted men, but that ia proviso con
tained in the appropriationbillr
nave limited
the expenditures to the enlistment of hut 25,
000. It is believed the full legal strength is
tbe least possible foroe at which the present
organization can maintained, having in
view
