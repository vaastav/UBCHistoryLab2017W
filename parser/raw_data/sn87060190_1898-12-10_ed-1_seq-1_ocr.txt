WILL GIVE THEM UP.
Filipinos and Their Spanish
Prisoners of War.
SO THINE THE AMERICANS.
Admiral Dewey find General Otla En
lighten the Washington Authori
ties ou Present Conditions
lu the Philippine.
Washington, Dec. 10. Tho navy de
partment has received a cablegram
from Admiral Dewey summarizing tho
oxlBting conditions .at Manilla and at
such points in the Philippines as havo
been visited by his officers.
Advices also have been received
from General Otis, the commandant of
the United States military forces in
tho islands, and they both go to show
a notable improvement in conditions
and the growth of a better spirit
s, among those factions of tho natives
r which promised to give trouble.
This fact Is particularly gratifying,
as the United States government is al
ready" giving consideration to the best
means at hand to redeem the pledge
it will bo placed under by the treaty
of Paris to secure tho release of tho
Spanish prisoners held ,by the Philip
pine natives. There aro about 500
clerical prisoners, and the government
is confident their captors will deliver
them up on proper representations
from General Otis and Admiral Dewey,
made, possibly, through Consul Wild
man. It may be necessary to call tho
natives into service in this matter, for
the reason that come of the prisoners
are held in captivity on other islands
than Luzon, which can be reached best
and most effectively by Admiral Dew
ey's ships.
Besides these clerical prisoners, tho
Americans themselves hold nearly 15,
000 Spanish soldiers as prisoners, men
captured at tho fall of Manilla, f hese
are actually on parole about tho city,
and the question 1b, how1 aro they to
be returned t6 Spain'. This must bo
settled by tho peace commissioners in
Paris.

inspections considerably. At tho same
time tho war brought' out results in
the branch of the service devoted to

DuW KBnBVY.
State of Business,1 Willi Failures For the
Current Week.
Now York, Dec. 10. R. G. Dun &
Company's weekly review of trade
Bays: The most significant thing this
week has been the entire absence of
the customary nervouB fright before
or after the mcotlng of congress, the
president's message and the treasur
er's report. No one Bhowed the least
alarm, and nobody could find occasion
for any. There Is a larger demand for
products In nearly all the great indus
tries. Wheat does not come out at low
prices if the people have less to sell
than last year, at 20 cents more per
bushel. Corn exports were 4,151,981,
against 3,313,086 ast year, and such a
foreign demand at prices much higher
than last year, and with wheat cheap
er, Is proof of a state of things abroad
which Americans hardly appreciate.
Tho price declined only ono-fourth
cent, with enormous receipts.
Cotton shared in tho export move
ment fully, and nevertheless has risen
three-sixteenths in price, with a feel
ing that estimates of yield may have
been excessive. Woolen goods have
been In much better demand and
many of the smaller mills have been
buying after concessions secured by
the larger.
This week's failures have been 248 In
the United States against 312 laBt year
and 22 in Canada against 29 last year.
OU Hankers Worried.
Cincinnati, Dec. 10. A crowd of bank
presidents and cashiers stood in the
Lafayette bank and saw" a steel vault
reduced to nothing so quickly that an
extra force of night watchmen wore
placed In the bank. They saw stoel
two and one-half Inches thick melted
like cheese, and then the bankers
shook their heads and came to the con
clusldn that there was nothing safe In
this world, not even their safe deposit
and automatic time lock and burglar
proof safes. Electricity was used to
melt the steel.
Array Apuulntnients.
Washington, Dec. 10. The president
sent to tho senate all the army ap
pointments made during the recess.
The appointments Include tho promo
tions In the regular army, as woll as
promotions and appointments in the
volunteer service, and also a large
number of second lieutenants appoint
ed from civil life. Soma of tho men in
the regular army havo been retired
since tho appointments were made, and
many In tho volunteer service have
been honorably discharged.
Fitting Ont Two Transports.
Washington, Dec. 10. The war de
partment has in contemplation the use
of the two big transports now being
fitted out at Cramps for tho convey
ance of troops on tho Pacific service.
It is probablo that when they have
served tholr purpose in conveying the
permanent garrisons to Cuba they will
be dlapatchod to Manilla by way of the
Suoz canal. In such case thoy will
take several thousand regulars to re
place the voluntoers thore.

president of the Spanish peace com
mission, presented a vigorously word
ed protest against the spoliation by
Uncle Sam of their colonial empire, and
concluded: "But these concessions
which wo were obliged to make touch
us less than the insult which has been
Inflicted upon our nation by President
McKlnley In his message. Wo again
protest solemnly against tho accusa
tion hurled against us in connection
with the Maine, and we intond to-again
submit tho question to an international
tribunal comprised of Eri;;Ia&uv;France
and Germany to determine who
shall bear the responsibility of the
catastrophe."
Prefer Nutiouul Sutclile.
Madrid, Dec. 10. Tho Imparclal in
timates that the explosion of the
Maine was the outcome of an intense
desire "upon the part of certain fac
tions in the United States to see tho
outbreak of war, which was unpopular
with the majority of Americans." It
adds: "The partisans of the war real
ized that something startling was
necessary to arouse national senti
ment It was a remarkablo chance.
Almost all the Maine's officers were
on board another ship at tho time of
tho catastrophe. Those who charge
the Spaniards with being capable of
such a monstrous act are well capable
of committing it themselves. Spain
cannot remain under such an infamous
charge. It would bo preferable to givo
tho world the spectacle of national
suicide."
