CABINET HUMORS.
The rumors of Cabinet cbanges.at Wash
ingles suddenly and somewhat unexpected
lv involve the name of Secretary BoutwelL
It is even loft in doubt by the latest advices
whether ho has not already resigned. If
he has done so, we presume it is because
the official Cabinet has, for some months,
ceased to comprise the actual political ad
risers of President Grant We are not
sure that the President considers himself
bound in choosing his political advisers to
find them among his Cabinet officers. They
me officer* of the government sworn to
the performance of certain official duties.
Some of them may be aspirants for
the Presidency themselves, and,
in such case. it would be
equally uncongenial to either party that
they should be consulted as to the political
steps uf the President's coarse. And yet,
so blended are the questions which bear on
the President's prospects as a candidate,
with the duties which the Cabinet are
culled upon to perform, that a President
can Scarcely ever select a circle of private
and confidential advisers, without soon
finding himself brought by their counsels
into collision with his constitutional ad
visers, When the political Cabinet begins
its sessions, the constitutional Cabinet is
very likely to put on Its hat and take Its
umbrella under Us arm. It Is well known
that for some time past the Hon. Simon Cam
eron, of Pennsylvania, and the Hon. Cheva
lier Forney, with incidental aid from Zach-'
ariah Chandler and Admiral Porter, have
been of great service to the President in
moulding his future policy. One of the
important results of this invaluable aid has
itfcn the clear insight it has given the
{'resident of tße necessity for creating the
Revenue Bureau into a Cabinet office, so
as to relieve the Secretary of the Treasury
of the labor and responsibility of making
some 17.000 appointments, and reduce
him to about 3.000.
Secretary Boutwell is conservative on
this question, and opposed to violent
changes. This raises the question whether
Secretary Boutwell, who was hardly the
choice of the President in the first in
stance. is essential to the formation of a
complete Cabinet. Now it Is part of the
theory of the President, in which wo agree
with him, that noltody is essential to his
Cabinet, and, as there are plenty of people
ready to fill the vacant space which the
Secretary now occupies, it follows that the
President can do without Mm,
Though the name of Secretary Cimeron
has not been mentioned, we should think
more than probable that he would sac
reed ilr. Bontwell, should the latter retire.
Hr represents Pennsylvania,and there hare
been daily indications for months that
Pennsylvania Is geographically desirous of
a Cabinet appointment. The fact that
the Secretary has amassed vast wealth is no
disqualification to him in the eyes of the
President. Mr. Cameron’s utmost ambi
tion would be satisfied by the Vico Presi
dential nomination, while Bontwell is cred
ited with an aim one notch higher. Bout*
well's Stale, Massachusetts, is sure for the
Republican candidate any way, and hasn’t
much voice In nominating him. Pennsyl
vania, however, is the biggest and most
doubtful State to be looked after politically.
Moreover. Simon has long desired to wipe
out the stigma put upon him by his ejec
tion from Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, In his
intimation, this can be best done by getting
into somebody’s else Cabinet, We hope
that President Grant can .find some better
nw» for any Cabinet positions at his dis
posal than to use them, for varnishing the
reputation of Simon Cameron.
GETTISG SOWH TO BUSINESS.
The chaos of opinion upon financial
.{nb&tions which prevailed last winter has,
in some degree, passed away. It may be
-'t down as agreed upon, that nobody in
Congress bdlcyes in the benefieesoo of
mrre inflation, per tt, once the 'West.and
South have refused to take more than
> {.'hhi.ooo of the $54,000,000 of new bank
circulation offered them by the act of last
winter. The Peudletonian measles have
also come ont well and passed off—nobody
cow proposes to pay the national debt in
greenbacks, or to abolish the National
Hanking system, and substitute greenbacks
therefor. All plana of scaling the currency
have been given up; and many other
moonshine projects hare been decently
interred.
It is something to have got rid of tho
necessity of entertaining these ancient
theories, whose features, like those of poor
relations, are so much more familiar than
they are welcome. Mr. Ingexsoli may con
tinneto believe, on the one hand, that
greenbacks ought to be propagated on the
winds like thistle-down. Mr. Stunner may
conceive, on the other, that the people oonld
pay gald if the greenbacks were to wear
cut and become frowsy in their pockets by
iiko. until, likeibe Deaeon’s one-hoss shay,
they sh nld suddenly dissolve into their
constituent elements and there would be no I
1 rotnise left for'the government to redeem. |
Last and not least. It may be assumed that |
the < per cent delusion has “gone where
iLc woodbine twineth.” 1
VTLon this disease set in, we were
i Uargc-d with lack of patriotism for affirm
ing that. w> long as our G per cent bonds
at a discount, nothing would ever in
jure capitalists to buy a 4 per cent bond
at par. We insisted that no sales of bonds
kbould be permitted below par, lest we
should be repeating the mistake made by I
(ireat Britain, over and over again, ot
issuing a low interest bond for a price so |
much below its t principal as to make its
real rate of interest as high as that which
it Mii>crseded, thus effectually preventing
the government from ever obtaining any
reduction in Its rates of interest.
The world has now, for months, enjoyed
the privilege for which it was supposed to
panting, of lending ns money at 4
P*.-r cm!, when, by buying onr bonds at
current rales,* it conld get Cj per
cent lint, for some mysterious reason,
not even the disinterested editors, who
thought it constructive treason to dohbt
that the 4 per cents would be taken,
Llive r Cored to take a single bond. There
j, Q pin K in this badness somewhere, which
the Secretary of the Treasury has been
- eking to puli out. He cannot understand
vhv Mr. Charles Bowles and the other
'•♦•ring bankers, who took such A tender
re»t in the Funding bill, when it was
.jipicg Its shell, incontinently deserted it
a* nmid as it began to feather out The
real difficulty is, that they wanted to get
hold of the bonds and get their oommis
* mods f«>r soiling them at “current rales’"
si whatever they would fetch. In tins
manner we could undoubtedly faud our
whole 000,000 of debt into 4 per
rent iKinds, by issuing $3,000,000,000 of
bunds at cents on the dollar.
\v<* congratulate the country on having
■ got rid of a portion of that kind of finan
cial wisdom of which Wilkins Mieawber is 1
the accepted type. Doubtless more notions
~f the same kind are in store, which may
t.Tevent any action whatever at the present
L,i..n of Congress. If so, the count.,

This is' what some people would stylo
-waiting the operation of natural laws,
ktd others would .call “walking by frith
Mid nut by sight,** or “ going it blind, »U
if vbicb signify a wholesome trust in un
known canids, and a lively expectation that
thf-y will produce unknown but gratifying
n-sclU. The only action which Congress
could by any means be induced to agree
would be that which throughout the
lafct Mission commanded the support of its
leading members with considerableunanin
itr. This was the proposition to retire a
civen amount of greenbacks—say the $4,«
(kKM>OO per month authorized under Mo-
CulWcb's administration —and to authorize
National Bank notes to take thoir place, so
that there would be a gradual redemption
-ol the greenback -debt without
Bair contraction of oar paper currency
in the aggregate. As the greenbacks
, should become' scarce, they' wduld’ prob
ably command a small premium of J
per cent to 2 per cent In National Bank
notes—just enough to pay the cost of send
ing the latter home to their respective
banks for redemption. This would set in
motion the system of bank note redemp
tion, which has now been practically sus
pended for six years. As soon as the Na
tional Banks were required to redeem their
own notes, they woold soon have piles of
these notes on hand to loan to their cus
tomers near at hand, of having
them afloat, stagnant and irredeemable, in
all parts of the country. As the greenbacks
are retired and their value enhanced, re
, demption of the bank notes in gold will
gradually ensue, and the greenback era will
end.
THE MOVEMENTS OF HTTBBIA.
The attitude of Bossia at present is suf
ficiently menacing to cause grave appre
hensions of another war in Europe, in
volving, perhaps, some important changes
in the boundaries of nations. Aa one of
the results of Btu&ia's discomfiture la the
Crimea, the “great powers,” England,
France, and Austria, with Turkey, re
qaired the Czar to a com
pact making the Black Sea a neutral water,
excluding therefrom any arched vessel of
any nation, and practically confining Bus
sia to the frozen oceans of the North, Im
mediately upon the execution of the treaty
of Paris, Bossia began her preparations
for its abrogation, by the purchase and
manufacture of all the materials of war
necessary for a thorough arming of her
people. . Since 185 C she bos been
untiring in her efforts in this
behalf, and the workshops of
Germany, Franco, Belgium, England,
and the United States have been employed
in manufacturing weapons of the most
approved construction, and in Immense
quantities. A high military officer of the
Bossian Government has resided at Hart
ford, Connecticut, ever since the close of
the war, superintending the
manufacture' and delivery of breech-loading
arms, by the Colt and other companies;
while the Cold Spring Foundry in the
neighborhood of West Point, and the Fori
Pitt Foundry, at Pittsburgh, have shipped
quantities of cannon of all calibres. Of all
this the British Government has been
fully informed, and a military attache has
been connected all the time with the
British Legation, whose business has been
to watch-the proceedings of the military
agent of the Bossian Government.
The result has been, unquestionably, the
collection in Bossia of such a quantity of
arms, and of such approved quality, as will
enable her. In case of war, to place her
troops In the field In a farabetter condition
than she was able to do in the Crimean
war. In that war, her troops were armed
with weapons of inferior construction, and
bad to meet the breech-loaders of
England and France, with the old style
muzzle-loaders, and in many eases, cm
at Inkennann, with ancient flint
locks. Bossia, therefore, is, in all proba
bility, now prepared to back her demand
for a free outlet from the Black Sea, upon
more equal terms than in the Crimean
war.
Cassia requires, in order to be a recog
nized commanding power in .Europe, a
first-class navy. 'Without a navy she can
not enforce her policy beyond her own
territory; her rivals have navies, and be
cause of her navy, England, so greatly in
ferior to Bossia In population, territory,
and natural resources, is able to curb and
restrain the great nation, of the North.
Russia must have commercial relations
with other lands, and must have a navy to
protect her mercantile marine. At pres
ent, beyond her own territory, she is una
ble to afford protection, and it has become
a matter of necessity with her to force the
issue which Prince Gortsebakoff has pre
sented. The treaty of Paris is an iron fet
ter upon her freedom. It was extorted
from her by the bayonet, and under du
ress.
F-om all tbe signs and indications, we
are led to conclude that Russia means to
nmV-A good her demand, whether the other
powers give their consent or not. The
present season is the best that can bo se
lected. The Baltic will be closed with ice
until May, amply protecting her ports on
the north. Her whole military power wlli,
therefore, be free to operate against Tar.
key. Though special pains have been taken
to deny it. It is not unlikely that there is a
thorough understanding between Prussia
and tbe Czar; and that, incase of hostili
ties on the part of Austria, the imperial
flpg of Germany will be carried to Vienna,
and the unity of tbe empire bo completed
by driving the Hspsbnrgs Into Hungary.
Tfrwijw have changed since 1836, when
this treaty was extorted from Rus
sia. Then France, England, and
Austria dictated terms. Thou Prussia :
was insulted by not being invited 1
to sit In the Council of Paris. Tbe year
1870 finds the leading power whose military
resources accomplished the results of the
Crimean war, in ruins. In a self-oboeen
campaign of sixty days, it finds itself with
out army, credit, government, or even or
dinary national pride. In 1860, Austria,
after a six weeks* campaign, to save Vienna
from the fate which now awaits Paris,
yielded abjectly to the terms demanded of
her. She denuded herself of all the terri
tory claimed of her, and was glad to ©scape
i without farther dismemberment This is 1
the present condition of two of the “ great
powers** which forced Russia to sign the
treaty of 1856. Since that day, Prussia has
risen to greatness and unites under her
sovereignty, more military strength
than any other nation in
Europe, except, possibly, Russia, England
alone, of all other parties to the treaty of
1856, Is in any condition to offer resistance.
Turkey is of little account The British
navy is the only means by which England
can seek to enforce that treaty. Wo have
soen enough to satisfy the world that public
sentiment in England is opposed to a war
with Bmtsia. However strongly Earl Gran
ville may have remonstrated, there is no
evidence that popular sentiment hw really
| sustained him.
In this contest, true to our traditional
policy of non-interference in European
controversies, we, of course, can take no
part. But we cannot be indifferent to tho
result. Tbe right of the interior State to
jm unobstructed road to the sea, is a ques
tion which wo can understand. Many of
the rivers of Russia empty Into tho Black
Sea, towhichshoisdebarred entrance. All
the equities are on the side of Russia, . Un
der these circumstances, it is not saying too
much to add that, in the conflict, should
there be one, Bushs will have the sympa
thies of the American people, and their
hearty wishes that she may accomplish the
object which she has in view.
An enabling act, for the aamission of
Colorado aa a Stale, ia now in the handa of
the Committee on Territories, and aomo
bill of the kind onght to pass. Colorado
ia now growing as rapidly aa any State in
the Union. Its true indnatriea are defi
nitely marked ont, the actual capacities of
the Stale are being worked np, and they
will be found sufficient' to sustain a very
large population. IThen the question of
I forming a Stale government was op before,
the State was barely recovering from the
partial disappointment of its expectations
in mining. It ia now known, however,
that she has unequalled advantages for
-maing and farming, and that these Indus
tries, under new and improved conditions,
bo the chief resources of her people.
The population cannot henceforth fail to
increase rapidly, and It will need the rigor
and power of a State government within
the earliest time at which a constitution
can bo framed, submitted to the people,
and tbo officers elected. She is quite as
much entitled to admission as Oregon was,
and better entitled to it than Kevada is to
day.
The Director of the United States Mint
recommends again the issue of silver coins
of the denomination of 10, -5, and «»0
cents, but ot the value of, s.y, 4 »
cents, or therosbonts, respectively, so ss to.
correspond with the average relne of our
existing depreciated greenbacks, and su
persede the fractional currency now m nse.
If this were done, it would lake ahont 11.
cents in the new coins to be worth 100 in
the standard coin. He would bare
the now coins of the standard fineness, but
less than the standard sire. Were we cer
tain that the premium on gold would re
main for even two years at its present
figure, such a plan would be worth the
trial. But, if the premium recedes to 5
or rises to SO, the new currency would be
'not a whit more available than the present
silver coinage.
The New York \forld t noticing the prob
able appointment of General Schanck as
Minister to England, says: •
41 We will sot withhold our opinion that the ap
pointment of General Sc&cock u, nn the whole, a
strong one; surely, m. American estimation, a
great improvement on Hr. Motley, General
1 Sebeock r»", indeed, make do pretentions to Mr.
’ Motley's literary, nor even hta social, cultivation:
but, unlike Motley, he baa vigorous native sense,
thoroughly American sympathies, and too much
'robnitsuanf character to be wheedled by social
•blandishments. lie la a man of rather coarse or
■sanlzatiotCgood faculties, strong prejudices, nar

Socially; bp* mu no danger of making aortal eo
jnymept Us bealoeea Instead of relaxation. Mr.
was Minister to Brazil under President
Fillmore, when Mr. Webster was Secretary of State.
He took aa active part, we believe, to negotiating
two or three treaties, acquitting himself with
credit, although nearlv twenev years youngerthan
be is at present. He baa sufficient acquaintance
Kith diplomatic forms to be free from embarrass
ment on that score, even if be lacked something
of bla known strength and self-reliance.”
, Aa General Scbenck is not a 44 revenue
reformer," we suppose that his position in
the party will not be seriously jeopardized
by the praise which the World bestows up
on him. Its encomiums are discriminating
and well deserved. General Schenck, in
our opinion, possesses, on the whole, bet
ter, if not higher, qualifications for the
position of Minister to England in this
crisis than any other person to whom the
jilace has been tendered since the recall of
Mr. Motley was decided upon.
As Chairman of s the Committee
of Ways and Means, in the sense of being
the leader of his party in the House, ho
was conspicuously successful. As a maker
of tariff and tax bills, he was equally a fail*
ore, As a contestant for a seat in Con
gress, to which he was not elected, he
would inevitably bo disgraced. As Minis
ter to England we shall expect from him
some practical issue out of the Alabama
controversy, free from tho taint of dema
gogism, which both countries can accept
without dishonor.
A week has passed by without any in
vestigation on (ho part of (he New York
Tribune into the editorship of Tax Chi
cago Tbibvwx. This is a subject worthy
to call forth tbe highest powers of our
New York namesake, end we are becoming
somewhat low-spirited on account of its
neglect to pursue It.
The Washington telegraphers say that
Horace Greeley is visiting the National
Capital at the present time, in quest of a
Cabinet position, and particularly that of
Postmaster General, We sincerely hope
that there will bo no farther hesitation in
giving Mr. Greeley an office. Since the
Bepubllcan party camo into power, he
has been twice a candidate for United
States Senator, once for Comptroller, once
for Governor, once for Congress, and once
for; Peace Commissioner. The last was
thc only office to which he was elected.
Wo submit that it is time something com
fortable was given to him.

In jour recent article upon 41 What the Con

jon advocate a thorough reform, or rather
change, in our whole system of civil proee-
In doing so you hold up for our aimirition
tboNsw York coda. Tba State of Ohio and
tho others you mention bare substantially
adapted the new code. This is a serious quee
tion, inasmuch as upon the proper adminiatra
. tion of Justice depends the well being of so
ciety. t You remark that aecordicg to the aver
ace standard of Judgment among lawyers, the
State of Kow York and the others mentioned
are far in advance of the State Of Illinois In
that regard, and hence call upon our Legisla
ture to adopt a similar system. It seems to us
that you adopt what the Nation calls a 44 high
priori* system cf reasoning. What this world
of ours most needs is facta. We need tho
ability to discriminate between facts and sim
ple imagination. If we reform, we should
know first that the thing to be reformed
needs reforming; and second, what better
thing can we put in its place. In the first
place, we decidedly deny that the majority of
Illinois lawyers think the New York code pre
ferable to ours. Not one in a hundred of the
Judges upon the bench, and of the lawyers ;
having a respectable standing at the oar,
would exchange systems of pleading. |
Of the NewTork lawyers, Charles O’Conor, .
who is respectable authority, but a abort time 1
since. In a public meeting, utterly condemned :
the New York code, whoa # compared with the
common law system; andbf similar views are
the leading lawvera of New York- It is an ad
vance hacKXPQriL
Yon admit that law and chancery must he
substantially kept separate. And so it rooms
they must. And in your atitanced States
•they are as separate as under our system.
: Von ksk us to adopt the Now Yota system,
yet vnu grieve at the denial of justice there.
Where wfll yon find an argument in favor of
their system, while you admit that our Chan
cery Court works well ? It seems to ns that
your argument tails. And again, you state
a man’s business may be shut up without
redreas and without appeal. It may be so
under the New York code ; Ula not so la Illi
nois. Thera is no ench. thing aa trying a case
ear parte, and there is always a tight of appeal.
The comparison institntod between tho • law
and chancery sides of the court by you. Is in
teresting and novel, bat it lacks the element
of truth. You state that. 44 the law regards
the past, and the rights that crow out of it.
while equity seeks to guard the future, and
secure the interest® cf parties hereafter.
That la not at all true as a proposition
Nine-tenths of all litigation on the Chancery
side of the court baa nothing to do about
guarding the future. Bills to redeem, bills to
impsach-a record, or to lake an account of
partnership affairs, have nothing more to do
with the'future than has a proceeding at law.
So system will become perfect so long aa
human Judgment remains imperfect. _
‘ The theory of all the new codes is simply to
state the facta of the case In alQgkal manner-
But the difficulty arises to tUe, that all law
toxs are not blessed with hign logical fac
ulties, and bence they need some aids, to
the way of precedents; and to-day, under
the New York system, tbe books are
full of adjudications upon the cueetiona
of practice, and pleading to New York may be
■aid now to bo as technical as our own eysteno.
And they follow preceaonte as closely. Why
threw sway ore system that is well defined
and adopt another which is all at sea, and
which mart be travelled over again and become
as technfcal as the one we have ? Those wbo
< originated our system were the leading minds
of the past. And do we know more than all
1 of them } And is past experience nothing to
us ? All of those Stales which have adopted
1 the code are drifting back to ns. The world
seems tohave spells of ieonocltem, but again
1 we all sail round, and once more admire the
! dear old'pictures which.we once worked.to
deetroy. 'Let us not, to our desire to over
throw thdhad. join the “ howhng sisterhood "
and seek to destroy the good.
Here and there we need reform to oar system
of civil procedure, hut only reform, not de
struction: In voar leader yon fait upon the
few wsak spots, but that does not mQltate
the svstem. A little judicious pron-.
tochers andtoere is desirable. Let ns more
riewly about these things, as the English do.
Xet ns not destroy a noble temple, and replace
it with a shanty. , ,
You are entirely mistaken to regard to our i
svetem of pleading delaying justice. Every
I case can be ready foe trial when it is reached.
I What we want is more Judges to do the bnsi
l ness. ’ .1
The very thing which yon consider the de- !
1 feet in our svatea is really Us superiority
' over the code system. WUh us tba oase most
'be prepared for trial, and U is very
1 rarely, indeed, that a continuance must
I be bad after trial is commenced to
l order to amend the .pleadings, but
under the code, the exactness with which the
1 facts are stated m the petition, instead of
1 their legal con-clarion, renders it absolutely
mrurrarT to amend if on trial the facta should
prove to be different from what the pleader
supposed, and the c*u?e most be eon tinned.
We mnst either advocate some well-defined
svetem of pleading or we mnst abolish special
pleading altogether, and with it courts of re
cord. ~
The lawver wbo is capable of practicmglaw,

.fbe Elections for (he School
Board.-'
Characterofthe Members Elect.
Mrs. William Grey-Miss Emily
Davis, • ■ ’ ' "
(wo* an occasional. coaasirosmctT.l
•Lo.vno.v, peer L
Tuesday was an important day for England,
for it virtually carried the ballot, besides giv
ing practical effect to ths Education act. Up
on the votes given, and the selection of can
didate*, the future of tbe rank file of our
London population depends, and there have
been few social changes of greater magnitude
in this generation than that which was inau
gurated so quietly on Tuesday. Deeply im
pressed with this, I devoted the morning to
the polling-places of tho city of London,where
tbe members of tbe board were elected by
open voting, and the rest of the day to the
polling-places of the metropolitan boroughs,
where the ballot waa being tried. Let me ray
at once, that the ease and , quietness with
which tbe elections were conducted struck me
as wonderful, and as giving a death-blow to
eatandawfll, and the performances we bare
been accustomed to associate .with popular
candidature. For, in spite of Bribery bills,
and the repeated conviction and eviction of
honorable members, a Parliamentary election
has been, with ns, little better than a brawl.
Mr. John Stuart Mill was not allowed a bear
ing by the yelling, shrieking crowd which
surged round tbe room from which he spoke
at Charing Cross; tbe members for tbe city
were shrieked down by excited liverymen In
their own Guild ball; aud that model of urbane
courtesy and refined feeling, Mr. Acton Aye
ton, the First Commissioner of Works, con
fessed .publicly, tbe other dsy, that one of
the snodee by which he won his election
was fighting his^adversary, who happened to
be a brewer, with nia own weapons, namely
by hiring all the public nouaee in the Tower
Hamlets out of his way. These things oc
curred yesterday, as it were, when this pres
ent Parliament was elected, and ife la not too
much to cay that until Tuesday last, the idea
of candidates being returned by a large con
stituency, in a perfectly seemly way has not
been extensively entertained or believed in
hire. Now, it la quite true that there have
been some complaints of the mode in which
thio school ballot waa conducted in certain
places. Toting papers were distributed in a
lump toward the close of the dsy, and without
dueexaminationottbe tate-payingqmdificatlona
of their recipients; voters came late and were
not permitted to register their votes after tbe
time of closing ths ballot-boxes (8 p. m.); and
a protest was banded in against the validity of
(be election for a certain ward. These are
the charges brought against the system em
ployed on Tuesday, and are grave enough.
But they are charges only, and not convic
tions, and, when compared with the allega
tions tnd incriminations which have fol
lowed elections made in tbe old manner,
or with tbe enormous number of voters and
places concerning which there has been
no whisper of reproof, they seem but fight.
My own experience was, that perfect order,
regularity, fairness prevailed throughout.
Tho names of the candidates seemed to have
cast a halo of respectability over tho elections.
Mr- Samuel Morloy, M. P., wbo is a strictly
representative man, and one whoso authority
has no small weight whenever tbe interests of
tbe dissenters are being canvassed in the
House, sits, as everybody knows, for the
rather turbulent city of Bristol. Bis sweat
ness of expression, and kindly dogmatism—
both of which seem begotten of much pro-
I siding at tea-tables, and tbe respectful admira
tion of ministers—must have shrunk oceas-
iocally from tbo rode shocks of British elec
tioneering. The deconun of Tuesday aod its
result must bays atrack him pleasantly, as
attaining a desired end without the touching of
pitch. Mr. Morley is said to hare been soar
the head of the poll, though as 1 write, the
returning officer, the Right Honorable Russell
Gurney, has not yet published the official re*
turns. Mr. Alderman Cotton is a favorable
specimen of his class. .Our Aldermen, though
far from tbo contemptible creatures
which Theodore Hook, and scores of
vulgar imitators, have punted for them, being,
as a role, shrewd, intelligent, wen-informed
men of business, have neither the training
norths bresdtbof view of those fitted to deal
with imperial interests. The night before the
School Board election I chanced to be dialog
in legal society, when one of the luminaries ;
of the Home Circuit avowed-hia Intention of 1
voting for Cotton because he was a gentleman I
as well as an Alderman, a conjunction which
ought to be supported. Mr. Cotton is one of
a turn in the leather trade, and the only tune
I ever met him in public was when he was
Sheriff for the city. In returning thanks for
bis health being drunk by a mixed company, |
he drew a comparison between the Common ■
Council of the city and tbe Imperial Parlia- .
ment of the United Kingdom, and bad the I
temcritv to assert that. In intellect, culture, .
experience of the world, administrative ca- I
pacity, and disinterested public virtue, tbe
two bodies were ou a par. It eeemea tike 1
comparing the governing committee
of tbe QUrious Apolloa, of which
you will remember Mr. Richard Swlveller was 1
the perpetual Grand, with tbe Privy Council, 1
and the unconscious arrogance which prompt-. I
ed tbe speech promises that Mr. Cotton, at 1
least, will not be unmindful of his own impor
tance at the School Board. This gentleman
presents 4 striking contrast to the Rev. Will
iam Rogers, another of the candidates for tbe
city, whose election is reported to be success
ful. Mr. Rogers is tbe father of that middle- 1
class school movement which saved so many {
old charities from criminal waste. "Item:
seven marks and one shilling yearly toward
the purchase of faggots for the burning of
heretics stSmithfleld; item; tbe interest of
two hundred pounds for tbe ransom of Eng
lish slaves from the Emperor of Morocco;
item; moneys for ©quipping vessels for the
war on the coast of Barbery I These are tbe
kind of bequests which the venerable compan
ies of the city of London have to administer by
the score. Of course there are no faggots to
buy now, no English slaves, no fighting off
tbe coast of Barbary— so the pions wishes of
the departed donors have long been things
impossible of fulfilment, and the funds which
should have burnt heretics have furnished
forth loving-caps in which heretic and ortho
dox have pledged each other at civic ban
quet. But Mr. Rogers found some years
since that many of these bequests were lying
dormant, and that, further, there was a latent'
power in tbe city for promoting middle class
education, which had never been made useful.
He worked the mine. Public meetings, re
ports in the press, agitation among tbe fold
ing merchant a and bankers—resulted lu tbe
micule class school, into tbe working of which
I have examined thoroughly and personal! ,
and which I regard as one of tbe
greatest ornaments ro the city. Tbe man woo
raised such a superstructure out of the
dead botes of forgotten religious animosities
and obsolete'national fears and hatreds, is,
we may be sure, fully qualified for directing
tbe education of the men and women of tbe
future, and Locdon Is fortunate in securing
him. Mrs. William Grey seemed the most
popular candidate at the Cbelaea pollings
pUces, and if the quiet and formality were
broken a little by jests at woman s rights—as
If the education of the young were not tbs
highest and beet work upon which either man
or woman conH be engaged. Lord Lawrence
was one of her fglow-eompetitors. and tbe
return of both thee© is said, to bo certain.
Tbe latter is as well known to you as
to us, and hfo Tp<k*« reputation follows him
ev<u in the minds of rate-payers. If 1 have
doubts, thev are as to tbe appropriateness of
a training which baa been chiefly among a
subordinate and inferior race, *od because I
remember the qualities and opinions which
led to tbe painful differences between his
Lordship and a lofty-minded brother, as to
the treatment and degree of confidence to be
shewn to those over whom both were appoint
ed to rule. I pass by Mr. R. Freeman, not
from disrespect, hut because the word goes
round that he was distanced in the race, and
find in Mr. McCoJlagb Torrens’ candidature at
Tlasbniy themoet noteworthy fact connected
with that ooroogh. Mr. Torrens hopes to be,
•and, I think, deserves to be. Chairman of tbe
newly-elected board, apoat of £2,000 per an
num, and the only one m which
payment- follows membership- Mr.
Torrens (who sita for Finsbury in the Bouse
of Commons) has not been a tacky man,
politicallv; and It was thought by many that,
on Mr. Gladstone’s accession to office, Mr,
Torrens would be appointed President of the

There areabont three hundred voting places,
and the polls, which opened at 8 this morning,
will close at 8 tonight. Those which I visited
were very quiet, and an American would have
been amused at seeing the curious parody on
American voting-customs here and there ex*
bibited. The polls were in school-houses, the
basements of churches, and similar place*. A
solitary policeman stood at the door of each;
and the voters, instead of banding in their
ballots through the window, . went into the
room where aat the officers of the election,
and where was arranged the ettrioos machinery
provided for by the new law. At one aide
of the room, behind a table, sat a gentle*
man called 4i the President, who had be
fore him a book containing the names of
the rate-payers of the. district. The
voter accosts this gentleman, gives fata
name, and If it be on the list he receives a
“ voting paper." If his name be not on the list
the President kindly puts it on, and then gives
him the voting-paper all the same. All the
voter has to do is to say be is the occupier of
a house in the district; do other oaeations are
ashed, tod do oath Is exacted. The
upcr” the voter receives Is in the following
otm;
.Vumta* of tout gltm to

Tie voter Harare rotes, all of whtehheoay

The voter, with this paper in his hand, then
proceed* to another part of tbe roots, where
be finds before Bio a nest of enclosed desks,
vet; similar to ordinary square boxee; placed
on their sides on a taole, and baring so lids.
These boxes are abont two feet square, and
into one of tbem tbe voter pnts bia bead and
i-bonldera and marks against tue names of bia
favored candidates (all printed upon tbe
voting paper) tbe number of votea which be
wishes to give for oaeb, using a pen and ink
which he finds before him; or a pencO if be
prefers it. and writing either in words or fig*
uroe. He moat not sign Lis name, or be will
invalidate bia vote, and’no other paper but
that provided most be used. Tbe voter then ;
folds op bia paper and pnts it into tbo ballot*
box which stands before tbe presiding officer,
and most then walk out of the place. In case ,
a voter cannot write, a clerk is appointed to
fill np his paper according to bia desire. I
Around tbe polls wore men walking np and :
down tbe pavement carrying boards on tbeir
breasts and'backs with tbe usual appeal to
the voters: “Vote for Mrs. Gray and no
Popery;” “ Applegarth. Efficiency, Economy,
and Perfect Religions Freedom“ Vote for
Huxley, tbo Renowned Man of Science; *
“Potter and Pore Religion;” “Down with
tbe Distill era and Dissenters,” 40. Everyone
seemed only to laugh at these things, and I
do not thick anyone's vote was won or lost
thereby. .At all tbe polls where a Catholic
candidate was running, his supporters
** plumped" for bim, and tbe other candidates
were fortunate if they got half of tne voter's
suffrages. I saw many ladies vote, and It was
affecting to observe tbe mingled timidity,
basbfulocse, pride, and self-satisfaction with
which they performed this first fcet of citizen
ship.
From the hour at which the polling-pla:ea
opened, people began to a; rive and register
tbeir votea. At the nlaccc in tbe more aria*
tocratic neighborhoods, there was nothing to
show that an election was taking place at all.
As each parish was subdivided, and each sub
division bad a place of Us own, the rooms
were never full; in fact, tbo ten desks (which
was tbe number most or tbe rooms were pro
vided with) were hardly ever all occupied at
once. At Mazylebone Parish, there was very
little stir at all; inside tbe rooms, no canvass
ing at all was allowed, and outside, tbe extent
to which tbo candidates went to secure votes
was the distribution of cards recommending
tbe candidates whose names they bore- The
division of Hyde Park- consisting al
most entirely of dwelling houses or
high-class shops, sent' only very
respectable voters to tbe poll. Ladles
came up in tbeir broughams or dye. and went
through the ordeal as a matter of course. In
tbe room for the division was a notice stating
that only persons going Io coie were allowed
in the room, and consequently tbe parish
beadle, who was doing doty there, felt It In
cumbent on him to request me to leave, bat I
expostulated slightly, and “o,.miracle of no
ble”—bumbledom, he discovered that it was
possible to mite tbe dignity dne to fals office
with civility. From him I learned that aa yet
most of tbe voters had been ladies, and that
tbsy all spoke to one another of plompiug for
Miss Garrett. There were twenty-two mem
bers for all Marylebone, ranking amongst
them a knight and a carpenter, a reverend
doctor of arnmty and a spirit merchant, a
female doctor of medicine, a well-known au
thor, two or three J. F's., etc.
The dead walls in tl e neighborhood were,
of course, covered with invitations to elect
“tbe right man in the right place." An asso
ciation had been formed to bring In seven
members. Churchmen and Dissenters, but, aa
they only recommended one rote to be given
to each, they only weakened their canse. Mr.
Hcpwortb Dixon, not so modest, invited the
electors ro “giro him tbeir eeven votes,"
whilst Meseis. Cremer and Onedalla divided'
between them tbe honor of being the work
ingman's candidate. Iwent to a poDing-plaoe
in a poorer neighborhood ana foam the
voting mnob livelier. There came tbewerk
ir groan who refused to accept a card, and
who “knowed wary well ’oo 'ee
were goin' to wote for.” Ee
gave bis name and address in a ready
manner, and wrote off bia paper, as if he un
derstood all about rf, and wasn't going to let
any of the swells get hold of him. Then came
a fierco-looking, elderly man, wbo was in a .
constant state of indignation. He gives bis |
name In a tone aa much as to say *‘T4 like
von to prove that that isn’t my name." He |
receives bis paner as though no was taking
something he bad won by the force ot- his in
vincible argument, and before proceeding to
the desk, ho stands in the centre cf the room,
grasps bis umbrella by tbe- middle,
and scowls round on every , one. Bis
look save plainly: “ Now. they, if any
one thinks he can prevent me voting for
the man Eve chosen let him by,, that's all.
UohappQv no one seems Inclined to accept Uir,
challenged and ha is compelled to fill on h : .a
votes, mop bia paper into the box, and exit
triumphantly. Then there's the timid vn’ er.
wbospeass is a “monstrouslylittle vor.ee.”
and isn't sure that that’s his parish or if he’s
got a vote at all. Place aux Damee! here
comes a plumper Indeed!* A lady of, to say
tba least, embonpoint comes panting tip. In
answer to the Recorder she gives bar name,
but considers Liseon Grove as quite sufficient
for the address. It takes ten minutes’
convincing her that she must giro her foil
address, and then she begins t o go ahead
.the other way. “She lives tjt 51 Carlisle
street, keeps a lodgin'-’oca*. And .'as got
six lodger*, nail coapect'ble ladies, she assures,
wot pays reglar. and wot w.t Urn. Garrett to
get m, *coa she’s good to "the little children,
and don't bother about them great 'nlkln*
brutes wot broke her wiafi.ows three yean ago
come next Easter, and no good to nobody.”
Tbe clerk succeeds in stopping her, and she
goes out, but prewatt' return* to say“a«a
gettleman boutside r as given 'era card and
told 'tx to wot* for Whelptou, and, please,
tbe'd like to V.e back 'er paper and wote
again.” Being r t last convinced that this is
impossible, ajv. declares that “nothin' 1 tint
fair for ns pore women,” and dinging down
the card; gowa away for good, thank heaven’.

Of tbs remit of the elec non for member* of
the School Board under the new education law
iD Manchester, you bare been informed by
telegraph, but. the matter U of sufficient
internet to warrant additional comment. A
previous letter baa Informed jou that under
thia Jaw all rate-payers, women as well as
men. are totora. and-that each voter has «
manv votes as there ate Beats to be filled, be
ta* at liberty to concentrate all his votes <m
one candidate, or to distribute them as he
pleases. In Manchester there were fifteen
member* of the School Board to ba elected, ,
and each voter had fifteen votes at Us die- 1
noeaL Portv-four candidates went to tbo
polls, and over 390,000 votes*were given
tv 20.513 voters. There are in Matt-
Chester no lew than 62,000 rate-pavera
so thst the first surprising thing about
the election la the sdf-evident fact that
something like 36,000 voters abstained from
Eo jjje | 0 T ote. Bat the other results are a till
more astonishing. Manchester is famous for
two things—first, the fervor of its Protestant-
Ism; second, the number, organization, and
strength of its working classes. But at this
election the two Roman Catholic*!were brought
in at the head of the poll, one of them receiv
ing nearly 20,600 more votes than any'Protest
ant candidate, and so working caescandi
date, of whom they were seven, being elected
at all, the highest vote any of them received
being 3.851, whilaono of them got only 166.
Here is the list of the successful candidates.

The 90,863 votes given to the two Roman
Catholic candidatea were polled by about 7,000
i vdlers, who either “ plumped” lor the revar
-1 end gentleman who heads the lisior split their
I votes between him and the lawyerwhofollow*
I him. The 133,762 given to the five Church of
England candidatea were polled by about
9.000 voter*—eo that it-seem* that in Man*
cljeater the relative strength of the Church of
England and the Church of Borne iraa niaa
to seven. It is quite clear that, under tbe
old system, the former could have elected all
the candidates, while the latter would
have been unrepresented; but it is equally
clear that those two parries under-estimated
their own strength, and that between them
they might have elected all tbe candidates but
one. The Catholics might have had alx in
stead of two candidates, anil given each of
them 15,144 votes; the Episcopalian* might
hdve had eight candidate*, and given each of
them 16.720 votes; while all that the other
partiescoold have done would have been to
elect tbe remaining candidate. These are the
mysteries of tbe cnmnlatiro vote, now tried
for tbe first time hi England, bat destined, no
doubt, to be need for even' more important
purposes hereafter.
} The complete rout which has overtaken the
' uneectazian, tbe secularist, and the working
men’s party in tbo election is an event giving
rise to many reflections. We hare been told,
Htqttead nauseam, that the “masses" in Eng
land cared nothing for rotigiomr education,
and bad an ardent desire for se
eming secular instruction, and sec
ular instruction only, for their children.
But now. In a city where the ‘‘nnsectanan,"
tbe secular, and the workingmen parties were
suppoeed to be strongest, there is an election
where tbo religious party meets the secularist
party and drives it from the field ; whore the
dogmatic party overwhelms tbe unsectarian;
and whore, out of fifteen candidates,
not one is a “ workingman.” or even a work
logman's candidate. What does all this
mean ?• It is true that 36,000 voters* neglected
to vote, while only 26,000 went to tbe polls;
but experience has shown that the voters who
stay at home are well represented' by those
who vote. Whatever else this curious elec
tion may be suppoeed to show. It proves at
least that tbe new education act fa ta produced
results not at all intended by those who wore
most anxious for Its passage. Piccannxx.

The Debate in the Horace*
Wash lvorow, Dec. 12.
Mr. Lotus introduced a bill to abolish the
offices of Admiral and Vice Admiral- in the
navy, tfas> former at once, and the latter
whenever a vacancy {n the office should occur.
Mx.Bco«atn(Bep.],of Pa., Cnaimtn of the
Committee on Karal Affairs, said be would
object unless the bill was referred to that
committee.
Mr. Looan moved to suspend the rules, In
order to introduce and pass the hill.
Mr. Bconxu> said he did nut think it be*
coming in the Bouse to he in haste la passing
such a bill. It should go to a committee,
like other hills. Be did not want to be always
kicking a man who happened to he down.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Lome disclaimed intending.any dis
courtesy or wrong to any indiv idaaV Ho had
no personal feefisg whatever in the matter.
He wished to extend to the navy .the same
principle that had been extended to the
army in the abolishment of the ranks of
General and Lieutenant General when
ever vacancies occurred. With a personnel of
only 8,000 In the navy, there w< ire now UC offi
cers corresponding with thoa e of General.
Lieutenant- General. Major General, and
Brigadier General. Kosucb Thing exists in
any other navy, He introduced toe bill as a
move in the right direction and ia» the Inter-
oet of economy.
Mr. Hale (Rep.), of Ho., t. member of tha
Committee on Saral Affairs, opposed the bill
ns miking an unfair distinction between the
army andnavv. The rank of General bid
been created for General Grant,-, ae that of
Admiral had been for Admiral Farragut, and
ae one bad been filled when a vacancy occur*
red bv tbo promotion of Get teral Sherman, so
the other should bo by the pi -amotion of Tice
Admiral Potter. Every bods had read Admiral
porter's letter.and ho thought that it was in*
consistent with tbo dignity ci- the House to
stare in any sentiment that might beprodneed
by that letter.
Hr. lajoax remarked thi .1 to bad said noth'
log about any letter. *
LCr. SoonfXD remarked that the estimates
last rear from the army were greater after the
passage of the Army Reform Bill of last ses
sion than they were before s also that many of
the naval officers referred to by the gentle*
man fromlQinoie. were retired on half pay,
whereas the retired arm y afflesrs were draw*
jug their active eerrico pay; also that the
officers of the army received from twenty-five
to flflv per cent more pay. than officers of cor*
responding rank in th o navy. He knew very
weU tVt Admiral Pc*tor bad written a not
very wise letter; bn't Osneral Scott had writ*
ten Utters that write cot very wise, and a
great many other men had made the mistake
cf writing foolish) otters, .and they were never
as gallant and boriorahlo men as Admiral Por
ter. AU he (Hr. Scofield) asked was that the
bill ehetUd be referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs.
Hr. FEBEtsß(Rep.}, of New York, said he
would be glad to know which of Admiral For*
brra letters the gentleman was referring to.
Mr. Scofield, without answering the qnee
tlcn. said he anew that when a man comnut
ted some folly all the wits cf the country tried
to pot him down. In that way they bad
laughed General Scott out of the Presidency.
Members of Co agrees once In a while aatd
foolish things. JXaughter.] In fact, it had
been well said that every man had bis fool’s
day, and with some it laatsd more than a day,
SmpSiS'of Mr ScoSeld ,h,l
the duties ot an Admiral were.
Mr. ScortELD declined to answer, except
to eay that they were the same duties that
• Admiral Farragut performed.
1 Hr. Dawns remarked that the Admiral had
t na duties to perform that were known to the
Hr. ScornxD said that the question whether
there should be each a rack in tbe navy wan
not the question at issue, but whether this bill
ebould not be referred to the appropriate
committee.
Mr. Daves eiid tbit the necessity for con
tinuing the rank «u the very question at
issue. The office vu created for a great and
glorious purpose, to testify to the great ter
nee rendered by a great Captain, and it was a
fair question whether that office should he
conferred on another. It was a snpenmme
rate and honorary position and that only.
Mr.Bma, of Maas., said that an allusion
had bees made to a letter of Admiral Porter.
It was not improper that he should refer to it
a moment. If gratitude were to control his
rots be should give it in faror of Admiral Por
ter for the writing of that letter. It had pat
before the country a piece of evidence for
which he (Mr. Butler ) was deeply grateful.
It showed that the army commander of
the Fort Fisher expedition was never to suc
ceed. Still, be could not believe that it was
the dnty of Congress to keep opes the grade
of Admiral, even for the sake of having each ,
good letters written as the two to which refer
ence had bees made. fXaughter.) He de
sired to know whether it was worth the while
to have an Admiral of the navy who could
could not. for two days together, utter the
same sentiments: whether it wae woith the
while to have an Admiral of the navy who one
day maligned and another day bugged bis
commander. He could easily understand
why the President bad taken no notice of Ad
miral Porter e letters. They were personal to
. him, too. Bet was that the man to put In the
pltce of the sainted, noble, brave Farragut ?
VTaa that the man to put as ah' example be
fore the youth of the nary ? "Were they to
be told that a naval officer could at one mo
ment praise his commander and at an
other moment malign him; that he
might at one moment write a sycophantic
Tetter to the Secretary of the Navy, to get
promotion and power, and at the same time
< abuse a man not then In power, and when that
letter was brought forward to turn around and
; abuse the poor Secretary, who was not now In
power, so as to gam the favor of the person
nhe President} who was In power ? Was that
the way men should be promoted In the navy?
' Was that the example they were to set befo? e
i the yenth of the country ? The brave, frank,
open-hearted sailor who bad Just died (refer-
I neg to Admiral Farragnt) had. with his dying
lipe, said to bis attendants “Xerer raise that
I flag over me; carry it before my coffin; that
flag which has been imposed upon by the man
: who expects to be my successor.” As a friend
I and associate of Tarragnt he (Boiler) nrolest
| ed. In the face of the country, that Congress
1 should not step out of Us way to tax the peo
ple for the purpose of putting honor upon the
1 man who bad dishonored the President and
had dishonored the navy., JHiatomenL]
Mr. Basis said he should vote forlheoUJ,
because, as he understood it, it placed the
navy exactly tn the earns position la vrafch too
army bad been placed. Congress had already
passed a WU that, when a vacancy occurred «
the office* of General andLiantdnant
; they should he dlaeonlinued.” He trusted that, .
itnsemocb as tha office of Admiral was n®: •
'necoasaiy. and as the House was asked not: to
I consider for a moment the acts of the noramos
i fertbia office,'-because it would prejudice ma ,
t cate; the House should now act upon the i
5 merits of the question, and plica the office of
t Admiral where Congreee had placed that of
: General and lieutenant General of the army; .
There was now* vacancy In' the office of Ad-
Imiral. If the office was extendedto ths’psr-
Ison who had been nominated to it, there was
no reason why it should not be continued to
the end of time; and he knew that those who
were tilled upon to pass Judgment on that
Domination were anxious for the House to
csss Judgment upon the question whether iho
office UaSF should be continued.
Mr Cox called the attention of the House to
an order of the Nary Department, tamed on
the 12th oT March, 1869, directing that ill mil
ters relating to the n&vy coming under the
cognizance of the different bureaus should be
submitted to Vice Admiral Porter before be
ing transmitted to the Secretary of tho navy,
and aaid that that order was an upturning of
the whole nary business and a violation of
the law. There had never been any rule of
law or of the department, previously, which
would allow Vice Admiral Porter to take
charge of the department, to the dishonor of
the Secretary of the Navy and to the dishonor
of the administration. It never had been al
lowed in any otber administration, and
should not be allowed la this administra
tion. He knew very well that a great many
irregularities had taken place under tho ad
ministration. He knew very well that Admi
ral Porter bad In one sense played the syco
phant and disgraced his high position. He
was willing to allow to Admiral FOrter brave
ry as a seaman and elall as a Captain in every
relation in which he had served during the
war; bathe would vote to makevokithe office
of Admiral, because be was in favor of good
administration and responsibility toe?-at the
head of the Navy Department. Tho condition
of things In the Navy Department bad been
such that the man who had tho power was not
accountable, and took do responsibility. He
would vote for the biß. not on personal
grounds, not because of the shameful letters
of Admiral Porter, not because of the humili
ation of the navy, and of the nation, by his
(Porter’s) sycophancy, hut he weuld vote to
vacate this office because H would be a re
form in tho administration of the government,
and especially in regard to naval affairs.
Hr. Looax t aid that what he had done in
fhiij matter be had done because be bad
. thought It to the advantage of the country
nM of the nation, and not from any feeling of
a personal character toward any individual.
lOf the gentleman affected by it (meaning Ad
miral Rowan) ho bad never met and did not
know, but be thought It right that this bill
should pass, and he thought that now was the
time to Paea it. The rank of Admiral was one
that had never been conferred in this country
before, and one which never ought to be con
ferred hereafter. Ee moved that the rules be
suspended and that the bill he put on its pas
sage. The motion was agreed to by a two-
Uurds vote, without division, and the biU was
passed.

The very plena and penitent Her. Jamee* S.
Green, whose real name Is John Wesley
Greene, has made what purports to he a- full
confession and complete history of himself
from tbe time and place of bis birth up to tbe
commission of this, M# first and only crime.
. Now I hare known this innocent preacher
ever since be served Ms foil term of fifteen
'months is the Moymmenaing Penitentiary.
-.When he emerged from that humane ioetitu*
tion, ho inunematoly repaired to this city to
join his wife and three children, baring aban
doned his first wife some fire years previously,
in Elizabethtown, N.'J., leaving her destitute,
with four t** 11 children to support as beat
eile eonld. . • . •
His first appearance m Cincinnati wav m
the fall of 1847, as an ornamental painter and
sembMeUiodist rreacfaer of tie ChornhSontb.
In tie following winter ho married a worthy
young lady ip this city, Uvea with her at inter
valsbetween four ana fire years, or np to the
time be waa eentencedto the Penitentiary from
Philadelphia. During that period be managed
to (swindle hie mother-in-law out of the very
valuable property where the Times building is
now located, besides robbing her of soma hun
dreds of dollars in money and relieving the
boarders at her house of a number of watenes
and other articles of value. In tbo fall of
11154 bo-Icft this city by epecitl request, and
sc on tarred up in Granville, Ohio, with a
third wife, a sister of a brother’s wife,
a school girl of that place. Soon after
bo emigrated to Now Torfc city, and wae
there arrested under the assumed name of
Ore ear. tba *• Great Confidence Man.” Ten
indictments were found against him for ob
tain ing watches and jewelty under false
pretences. He was tried upon only one of
tboa e indictments, found guilty, and sentenced
to Si mg Sing for the term of five yean. Here
his .exemplary conduct and great interest in
religions matters brought a pardon from the
Governor after a service of sue months.
upon his release ho again visited this city,
and n jarried here a grass-widow for bis fourth
wife, took her Hast and went into a Pennsyl
vania regiment as Chaplain. Was sent to the
Potosoac, and there, on account of atrictly
bonce t and business-like qualifications, was
appointed Brigade Postmaster. In tine ca
pacity be managed to steal about all the
money and valuablee belonging to the
soldiers, wae detected, tried, convicted,
acd sentenced to tbo Alexandria prison.
Again his good conduct eocn induced a pardon,
and soon be became the “ great negotiator’'
for peace between Jeff. Dans and the United
States. President Lincoln furnished JumSlOO
for this namese not of tbo Secret Service
fund. Hut Id a few days be obtained a very
costly set of furs for bis wife from a house m
Baltimore upon false pretences, and fled to
Chicago. There he was arrested, but escaped
into Canada, remaining there about one year,
when be made his way to Middlefield, Connec
ticut, under the assumed name of M. M. Culli
eon, wUhhlsfiflb wife.
In Canada, as he says, “he worked for *8
per week," and went to Connecticut in answer
to an advertisement for an “ornamental ja
panner." There he soon commenced preach
ing to a “ mixed people," without a congrega
tion, upon a salary of only £350 a year. This
salary was from year to year raieed until It
reached £BOO, when bis parsonage very mys
teriously, one dark night, was
burned. A few of bis “ mixed people,"
oat of pity for him. made np a purse more
than sufficient to make him whole again. But
the discovery was coon made that he bad bid
away under the church four large trunks, well
filled, and upon his attempt to remove them
tbev were attached, and part of the contents
sold for the support of bis abandoned family.
Very soon after this he appeared in Chicago,
at 45 Franklin street, as J manner, under the
assumed name of Jas. S- Green. His career
since is best knows to the people of Oreens
burg, Ind.. and other* - placee in that State,
where he has lately preached and prayed bo
