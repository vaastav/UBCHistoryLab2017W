THE L'ANSE SENTINEL, L'ANSE, MICH.
WILSON'S MESSAGE
TO THE CONGRESS
Senate and House in Joint Ses
sion Hear Address of .
the President.
HE MAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS
Further Legislation for Settlement and
Regulation of Railway Labor Dis
putes Held Imperatively Neces
sary by the chief Magistrate.
Vushlngton, Dec. 5. The senate
ami house met In Joint session today
nnd heard President Wilson's message,
which was ns follows: ;
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fultllllng ut this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time to time
Information of the state of the Union
und recommending to your considera
tion Much legislative measures ns may
l.o Judged necessary and expedient I
Khali continue the practice, which I
hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service ami cotillne myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which It seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few ns possible; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first plnee, It seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of-your last session in view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated d'.llicultles which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended ;
First, Immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate; In order that the ,
commission may bo enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon It with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
Its present constitution and means of
action, practically lmjosslble.
Second, the establishment of nn
right-hour day ns the legal basis alike
of work and of wages In the employ
ment of all railway employees who nre j
actually engaged In the work of oper
ating trains In Interstate transporta
tion. Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of n small
body of men to observe the actual re
suits In experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour ' day.- In railway trans
portation alike forthe men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
press of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of nn
Increase of freight rates to meet such
nddltional expenditures by the rnll
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
'our day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
nnd economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify the Increase.
Fifth, nn nmendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of' such controversies ns the present
.by adding, to It a provision that, In ense
the methods of accommodation how
provided for should fall, n full public
Investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be Instituted nnd
completed before n strike or lockout
mnv lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
hands of the executive of the power,
In case- of military necessity, to take
control of such portions nnd such roll
ing stock of the rallronds of the conn
fry ns may be required for mllitnry
tiso nnd to operate them for mllitnry
purposes, with authority to draft Into
the military service of the United
States such train crews nnd adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe nnd etllclent use.
Renews Hit Recommendations.
The second nnd third of these rec
'omniendatlons the congress Immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service and It au
thorized the appointment of a coin
. mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most Immediately needed;
Unusual Experience.
"Man." remarked Sandy, "I did a
thing last nlcht what I've no dune this
twenty year. I went to :ra bed palrr
fectly sober, but I'm rlcht thankful to
say I got up this mornln' none the
waurl"
Few Beggars in Panama.
Although the city of Panama Is ft
most cosmopolitan place, practically
every race being represented In Its 00,.
COO Inhabitants, there are no beggurs,
pzcept few blind men.
but It postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem It neces
sary to renew. The power of the In
terstate commerce commission to grant
an increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to Is Indlsputubly clenr and n
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw In question the scope of the com
mission's authority or Its Inclination to
do Justice when there Is no reason to
doubt either.
The other suggestions the Increase
In the Interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and In Its facilities
for performing Its manifold duties, the
provision for full public Investigation
and assessment of industrial disputes,
nnd the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary In time of war
or other like public necessity I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest nnd pressing. Those who have
Intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving nnd safeguarding
them In such matters would find It
hard, I believe, to excuse n failure to
net upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the Interstate com
merce 'commission now find It practi
cally Impossible, with Its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
Its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but It Is not unlikely that It
may presently be found advisable to
add to Its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected us an administrative Instru
ment. The country cannot nnd should not
consent to remain nny longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbances for
luck of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
nd all will agree that there must be
no doubt ns to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed nnd
whenever they are needed.
This Is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative . efliclency
which argues Its own ease In the mere
statement of It. With regard to one
of Its Items, the Increase In the elll
clency of the Interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted; its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, nnd
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make It, that nny man In any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue In an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass u law which
forbade or prevented the Individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society In do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I
take It for granted we are not prepared
to Introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or Inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public
investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at Issue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the tuition Is not to propose
any such principle. It Is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the In
dustrial processl-s of the nation, ift any
rate before the nation shall have hud
tin opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of the cuse as between em
ployee nnd employer, time to form Its
opinion upon an Impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing In that proposition
but the Justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessury processes of
Its very life. There Is nothing arbi
trary or unjust in it unless It be arbi
trarily nnd unjustly done. It can nnd
should be done with u full nnd scrupu
lous regurd.XoxU).e. Interests and liber
ties of nil concerned as well as for the
permanent Interests of society Itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital Importance
nwnit the action of the senate which
have nlrendy been ncted upon by the
house of representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than Is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present orgunlc law of Porto Itlco;
ond the bill proposing a more thor
ough nnd systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money In elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted Into law. Their
urgency lies In the manifest circum
stances wldch render their adoption, at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. . Even delay would seriously
Jeopard the interests of the country
und of the government.

"Simple Simon went a-flshlng In his

ulate the expenditure of money In elec
tlons may seem to be lew necessary
than the Immediate enactment of the
other nieasum to which I refer; be
cause at least two yeurs will elapse
before another election in wklch fed
erul otllces are to be tilled ; but it would
greatly relieve the puUlc mind If this
Important mntter were, dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining nnd spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
'cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied in
the light of present experience; nnd a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postiionlng ac
tion until another election was at hand
and soma special object connected wljh
It might be thought to be In the mind
of those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not nrgue nt length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand In the
mntter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essentjal enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently, will Immediately assume,
lias Indeed nlrendy assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented In our experience.
We have not the necessary Instrumen
talities for. Its prosecution; It Is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be created upon nn adequate
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacles
nnd create u basis of undoubted law
for It which will give freedom' without
permitting unregulated license. The
thing must be done now, because the
opportunity is here nnd may escape us
If we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Klco Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
its people are not Just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which, we have not satisfied.
There Is uneasiness among the people
of the island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt w hat we wish
to do In any essential particular. We
ought to do it nt once.
There are other matters nlreudy nd
vnuced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I should spenk.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
nnd nction taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress. I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure nnd satis
faction I have co-operated with you In
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor In such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare servlceableness and
distinction. . .
Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite.
Instead of an ax and saw to remove
the tops of trees that nre to be used
as masts In logging operations, dyna
mite Is used to shoot off the tops.
After the branches have been removed,
a rigger climbs the tree, with n set of
Irons, to the point where It Is neces
sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk
Is usually about 12 Inches In diame
ter. The rigger ties n string of dyna
mite enrj ridges, fastened end to end
like sausages, around the trunk at this
point. Inserts n blasting cap wlthbout
'JO feet of fuse In one of these sticks,
lights the end of the fnse,vnnd de
scends before the explosion takes
place. The tree top pumps Into the
air with the explosion and the trunk
Is left ready for attaching the rigging
for dragging In and loading the logs.

Federal Reserve Board Sees Peril In
Purchase of Short-Term Notes
Formal Stat' nt Issued From
Washington Blow to Financiers.
Washington, Nov 29. The federal
reserve bourd Issued a stutement on
Monday warning bunks. unci the public
against the purchuse of short-term for
eign notes. -
The stutement will be a severe blow
to the financiers who were planning to
float these loans In the United States.
The statement says In part:
"In view of contradictory notes
whlcl have appeared In the press re
garding Its attitude toward the pur
chasing by bunks In this country of
treasury bills of foreign governments,
the board deems it a duty to define Its
position clearly.
'The board believes that at this
time banks should proceed with much
cuutlon In locking up their funds lu
long term obligations which are short
term In form or name, but which,
either by contract or through force of
circumstances, may have to be re
newed until normal conditions return.
The board's concern nnd responsibility
lies primarily with the banking situ
ation. "If, however, our bnnking institu
tions have to Intervene because for
eign securities nre offered faster thun
they can be absorbed by investors
that is, their depositors an element
would be Introduced which, If not kept
under control, would tend townrd in
stability nnd ultimate injury to the
economic development of this coun
try. 'While the loans may be short In
form and severally may be collected at
maturity, the object of the borrower
must be to attempt to renew them col
lectively, with the result that the ag
gregate amount placed here will re
main until such time ns It may be ad
vantageously converted into a long
term obligation. It would, therefore.
seem thut funds of our bunks, which
should be available for short credit
facilities to our merchants, manufac
turers nnd farmers, would be absorbed
for other purposes to u disproportion
ate degree, especially in view of the
fuct that many of our banks nre nl
rendy carrying foreign obligations
w hich they nre under ugreement to re
new.
The board deems, therefore, Its
duty to caution the member banks that
it does not regurd It in the Interest of
the country at this time that they in
vest in foreign trcusury bills of this
character."

NATIONAL TREA8URY IN A DE.
PLORABLE CONDITION.
Democrats Make Loud Claims of "Pros.
perity" While Piling Up an En or
moua Deficit Appropriations
Beyond All Reason.
The Democratic administration,
which Is loudlyHProclnlni,nS "prosper
ity," Is plllmup a government deficit
of nearly S000,000 every 24 hours.
Congress lias made appropriations
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917,
which total $1,G30,3S3,000. Every
source of revenue available at pres
ent will fall short $444,814,000 of rais
ing that sum.
The estimates of Incomes nre : From
customs duties ( $225,000,000, Inter
nal . laws $515,000,000, new rev
enue law $205,000,000, sale of Pan
ama canal bonds remaining in tho
treasury $240,509,000. That Is a to
tal of $945,000,000 with which to pay
$1,030,383,000.
Of the appropriations for the cur
rent yenr $349,103,590 are attributable
to military and naval preparedness
and on account of the war situation.
In addition to that item, which Is
looked upon as extraordinary, the
Democrats have arranged to spend In
the present year $330,000,000 in ex
cess of tho revenues of the nation.
Not only nre they facing a deficit
of $444,814,000, but to keep it down to
that total they nre figuring on selling
$240,509,000 Panama canal bonds, thus
adding to our bonded debt by $240,509,
000. In other words. In one year's op
erations, they would Increase by
$085,3S3,000 the nmount the country
owes. That Is more than two-thirds
the total national debt of $1,028,504.
055 when they took charge. J
During the first eight months of
the present yenr our shipments of ma
terial exceeded similar shipments made
during the same period In the year
the war began by $1,535,000,000. Add
ed to this there was a gain In the ex
port of cotton and breadstuff s to sup
ply clothing and food needs of Eu
rope due wholly to the war, which In
creases the total to $1.74S,000,000. Our
total exports of all kinds now nmount
to $2,110,000,000 more than they were
in 1914. There Is no evading the ob
vious fact that the war was the cause.
Whnt Is going to happen to this
business nnd the employment of Amer
ican wnge-enrners which Is bnck of It
when the war ends? There Is cer
tain to be a great change.
President Wilson's Weakness.
Undoubtedly the impression left
upon nn unprejudiced student of Mr.
Wilson's public enreer Is that of a
wavering, shifting personnlity, ever
seeking a line of least resistance. His
Innumerable changes of mind -on Im
portant questions point Inevitably to
a sacrifice of principle in favor of
political expediency. More significant
still have been his direct surrender to
dictation from special Interests. His
well-known reliance upon unofficial ad
visers In the conduct of his adminis
tration Is another Indication of his
Inability to stand alone, to mnrk out
a course fofiilmself nnd pursue It to
the end bernus'e he believes It to be
right. PfttsbVrgh Chronicle-Telegraph.
'
Conditions After the War.
Wlien the war ends, the demand for
our strictly war exiwrts will abrupt
ly cense. The belligerents will begin
at once to supply tneir otner neeus.
The neutral countries of Europe will
not have to look to America olone for
their supplies. These nre conditions
which cannot be avoided. But there
Is greater peril still. Our own homo
fiiarket, which furnishes a business
eight times as great as even our pres
ent abnormal export trade, will be In
vaded unless nn adequate protective
tariff is Immediately Imposed. It will
be the most attractive market. in the
world to gold-hungry Europe.

EVERYTHING WAS "JUST FINE"
Bunch of Giggling Girls Showed
Tendency to Work That Particu
lar Phrase Overtime.
If you happened to be near the
bunch of giggling girls In the station
the other day, you would have conclud
ed that only two words were left in
the English language with which to
express approval, answer questions or
exclaim.
You couldn't help hearing the con
versation, for after the fashion of
some young girls, they didn't care who
heard what they said.
They opened fire when they met by
asking each other: "And how are
you?" The answer was Invariably:
"Just fine!"
Then they tackled the weather," and
each of them conceded that It was
Just fine. It seemed that onj of the
party hadn't been with the others for
Borne time, and that her special chum
of other days was not present on this
occasion, so one of them asked : "And
how Is Murle?"
"Oh, she's Just fine!" was the en
thusiastic reply. "She's married, you
know."
"Married? Marie! Oh, hush! Did
she get a nice man?"
"Yes, he's Just fine!"
And they all exclaimed In chorus:
"Isn't that Just fine!"
