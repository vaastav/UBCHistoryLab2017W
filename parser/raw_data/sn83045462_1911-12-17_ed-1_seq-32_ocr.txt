>lah* Vajrn viirlh. Phra Mongkut Klao,
HIbk of Slam.
The coronation ceremonies attending
the ascension to the throne of his majesty,
Maha Vajiravudh, Phra Mongkut
Klao, King of Siam, which have just
been completed, set another milestone In
the rapid march which Siam is making,
and which has astonished the nations of
the world. The very fact that the great
powers sent members of their royal
families to represent them at the coronation
is an evidence of the interest and
respect which they have for Siam.
Unostentatiously, without upheaval, but
vith amazing speed, the Siamese picked
jp the progressive ideas and inventions of
the western powers, and today a foreign
?r who journeys to uaneKOK, uip capital
jf the nation, will find there railways,
street cars, large electric light and gas
plants, telephone service, in fact all of
the best features of modern civilization.
Young by Their Beckoning.
The npit monarch, who has ascended
the throne under the most favorable
circumstances, takes up his reign in
tiie year *30, according to the reckoning
of the Silmese, who reckon the years
from the establishment of the national
capital of Bangkook. Their ne'w year's
day falls on April 1 of the Gregorian
calendar. Among the sjieciul ambassadors
sent to Siam for the coronation
were: His serene h ghness Prince
Alexander of Teck, and his suite, representing
Great Britain; his imperial
highness the Grand Duke Boris and
su.te, Russia; his royai highness Prince
Waldemar and his three sons. Denmark;
his royal highness Prince William. Duke
of Sudder manie, and suite. Sweden; his
highness Prince Fushimf and suite. Japan,
and his royal highness Prince Nicholas,
Greece. The I'nited States was
represented by Hamilton King of Michigan.
I'nited States minister to Siam,
specially designated to represent the
I'nited States at the coronation suite, including
Col. Be a Febiger, 17. S. A.
Much of the credit for the rapid development
of Siam Is due to the late
king. Cliulalongkorn, Phra Chula Chom
Klao, who was a man of much ability
and who took the lead in the adoption
of the best features of the western civilization.
One matter which his late
majesty insisted upon was the education
of the people of Siam. and the new monarch
is proceeding along the same line,
in consequence a system of public schools
lias been established throughout the
knigdom and is maintained on a high
plane.
Educated in England.
The late king sent his son, who is now
on the throne, to England, where he
went through the military academy at
Sandhurst and was attached for two
years to an English regiment. He then
r. 4 . . J : J .. 4 r?u x r % . li m?v r a
Muuitnj at v unsi s * one&e, uxiuru.
For many years it lias been the practice
of Siam to send thirty or forty young
men to European countries and to the
United States to be educated. As fast
as they receive an education they are recalled
to Siam and their j?!aces lilied by
others. I'pon these men is falling a large
share of the work in modernizing the
kingdom according to western ideas.
It is rarticularly interesting to note
that for many years the chief office in
tiie Siamese government has been held
by an American. Prof. Edward H. Strobe!
was seleciecj for this important office
?that of general adviser?by the late
king, who made a careful search for a
disinterested and capable man for the
position before making the appointment.
Prof. Strobel went to Siam from Harvard
University. Cnder his advice the progress
of Siam was rapid and without friction
of any kind.
American to Fill Place.
When Prof. Strobel died several years
ago from blood poisoning due to the bite
of an insect, received in Egypt on his
way home for a vacation, another
American was selected to 1111 his place as
general adviser to the government. Jens
Ivens Westenyard, also an instructor at
Harvard, and Mr. Westenyard's services
have been so satisfactory that he has been
continued in office by the new king. An
evidence of the liberality and gratitude
of Siam is to be found in the pension
which the government pays annually to
the aged mother of the late Prof. Strobel,
who is living in South Carolina, more than
eighty years of age. The government of
Siam pays her $1,75U a year for life.
The Siamese are very friendly to the
United States nut only because of the
influence which lias been exerted by Prof.
Strobel and Mr. Westenyard, but also because
of the feelings entertained for this
country by the Siamese who have visited
t ... . . z i.. _t . - * I, ,, _ a i _ t
.iiucri a, particularly me present King,
who came to Washington during the administration
of President Roosevelt and
received a cordial welcome at the White
House. He visited many of the important
cities of the I'nited States and of Canada
during his journey. It must be said,
however, that Americans have been slow
to awaken to the fact that a big Held for
trade with Siam exists. Although Siam
does a large export and import trade today,
practically none of it is with the
I'nited States, and nearly all of it is with
European nations, especially Great Britain
and Germany.
A Benevolent Despotism.
The government of Siam is a benevolent
despotism. The steps which have
been taken for the beneHt of the people
and for the development of the country
have all originated with the king and the
nobilltj. The various departments of the
government such as the foreign office,
the department of the interior, the war
department, the department of justice,
are intrusted to members of the ministry,
who are select'-d by the king with
preat care.
While Siam is properly called a despotism
and tlie authority of the king is
ibsolute and is handed down from father
-o son in the royal family, the unusual
social system of Slum tends'toward de
moeracy. Men in Siam may be said to

be all born free and- equal, with the ex- '
ception of the members of the royal family.
There is, to be sure, the nobility.
But no man is born a nobleman. No
title descends from father to son, except
in the royal family. The son of a nobleman
must prove himself worthy of nobility
before he attains that rank. And
nobility is won only because of merit
and of good work performed. In the
case of the brothers of the king their
sons do not receive the same title as
their fathers, but are one degree lower
in rank, and their sons, in turn, are one
degree lower in rank than their fathers,
unless by merit they may attain the
higher rank. Thus the descendants of
the royal princes may ultimately become
the same as the rest of the people. There
are live ranks in the nobility.
Population Nine Millions.
The population of Siam has been esti- '
mated at about O.OOO.OOO and the area 1
of the country is about the same as that \
of France. The Siamese are a different
race from either the Chinese or the !
Japanese. Their straight black hair and !'
dark eyes give the Siamese some resem- <
blance of the Japanese, but their eyes |
are straight and the general expression
of the Siamese countenance is more that
of a European.
The capital, Bangkok, is a handsome i
city of some 700,000 inhabitants! The
street cars, the street lighting, telephone ]
system and modern sanitation all give
the impression of a modern western city. 1
The style of architecture Is being more s
and more modeled after the western style
and narticularlv the Italian. Their houses i
are many of them similar to the detached
houses which are found In the suburbs
of cities in this country. The dress
adopted by the people is western to a
great extent also. In the public schools
the only foreign language taught is Eng- 1
lish, which is the commercial language
of the far east. Although the religion of
the Siamese is Buddhism, the government
makes no objection to such foreign missions
as are established in Siam, particularly
because many of the schools established
by the missions teach English.
The late king, just before he died, requested
his son not to spend large sums
of money upon a great funeral for him,
but to spend such money as he desired
to devote to the memory of his father
for the benefit of charitable institutions.
The present king has voluntarily surrendered
about $t?oO,UU(> from his civil '
list for the benefit of the government.
A Peaceable People.
The Siamese are a peaceable people,
but they are also intensely patriotic. The
army system there is very similar to that
of Germany, and each young man is i
compelled to serve his three years in the
standing army and then enters the reserves.
None of the Siamese shirks this
duty. A splendid standing army of ItO,(KX?
men is maintained, well equipped and
well drilled, and should be able to give a
good account of itself.
As an evidence of the consideration
which the English and other foreigners
have for the Siamese, extraterritorial
courts, such as are maintained in China
and other far eastern countries, are not
maintained there. When a British subject
commits an offense in Siam he is
tried in a Siamese court, and under the
laws of that land. Not a foreign soldier
is maintained in Siam by any of the
nations as a guard for the legation there,
but the protection of the European representatives
is left entirely to the Siamese
police.
The railroads in Siam are owned by the
government, with the exception of a few
short spurs. The government has found
these roads a good investment, paying
about 7 per cent. Slam is remarkably
free from public debt, owing only about
five million pounds, most of which was
borrowed to construct railroads and
other public improvements.
Siam is primarily an agricultural country.
and among her principal exports are
rice, tea and hides. There are rich mineral
resources in the country, many of
which have not yet been developed, including
oil, tin and gold. The country
has a stable monetary system based on
a gold standard.
Tlie quantity of labor Is very limited in
Slam, and. In fact, many Chinese laborers
are employed in the rice fields and other
Industry. There is no emigration from
Siam.

FAFT'S NEXT MESSAGE
DEALS WITH ECONOMY
-
Departmental and Administrative
Matters Principal Theme
of the Paper.
President Taft's next message to Congress,
which will go to that body within
a few days, will deal with departmental
and administrative affairs. The
work of the economy and efficiency
ommission will form an important part
uf the message. This commission has
been at work long enough to have
reached conclusions that the President
will wish to communicate to departmental
heads and possibly to Congress.
The President's tariff message will not
be put into shape before some time
icxt week, and may go over until right
ifter the Christmas holidays.
President Taft has accepted honorary
membership in the Georgia Society of
New York. This society appreciated
some acts of the President friendly to the
south and wishes to honor him.
The Florida senators and representatives
have urged the President to attend
the opening of the East Coast railway]
at Key West, January 22. He has not j
yet decided what he will do in the matter.
Taximeter Gets Kentucky Senator.
Senator Bradley of Kentucky watched a
taximeter do him out of 10 cents at the
White House yesterday. The Kentucky
senator is probably the best patron of
taxicabs and hacks in the city. He rides
everywhere, pays what is asked of him
and goes on about-his business.
As he reached the White House yesterday
in a taxicab he glanced at the
taxirpeter and saw that it had registered
$1. He didn't hear a little click a second
after he had glanced at the instrument.
"I see I owe you a dollar," said the
senator to the chauffeur. "Here it is."
"No, it'is $1.10," said the autocrat of
the taxi. "Didn't you hear that little
click just then?"
"By gosh, I didn^t." declared the Kentuckian.
"But here's the 10 cents, and
I had better get away from here; that
thing keeps on going 'round." The Iventuckian
hurried away before the instrument
could start again.

TOTALS SEVERAL MILLIONS.
?
Virginia Fisheries Largely Increase
in Value According to Report.
According to the annual report of the
Virginia fisheries commission that state
now ranks first in the fisheries industries
of the country, surpassing the New England
states, with their great cod and
mackerel catching fleets. For the year
ending September 1, 11?11. the gross income
of the various fishing industries of Virginia,
including the oyster industry, was
$7,.VX>,00(?, and this does not include the
catches of-mackerel, bluefish, trout and
other deep sea fish off the coast, and
which if added would increase the amount
given above by several million dollars.
The lafge increase in the value of the
fisheries in Virginia is due much to the
menhaden industry, in which a large fleet
of big steamers is employed, and at which
many thousand persons work during the
fishing seaso'n.
There is hardly a. town of any size on
Chesapeake bay or at the mouth of the
Potomac without its fish factory, and
this business has practically all been developed
within the past eight or ten
years.

EFFORTS TO SAVE HER
Attempt Resumed to Obtain
Executive Clemency for
Mattie Lomax.
Those who would save Mattie Lomax,
colored, from execution of the sentence to
die on the scaffold at the District jail
tne middle of February for the murder
of her husband, will urge the probable
mortal character of her present illness
to President Taft in support of a plea
for clemency and will present other reasons
to induce executive clemency. Her
condition is not such that she is likely to
die before the time fixed for her execution.
"Mrs. I.omax is holding up well." said
Rev. John Roberts, her spiritual adviser,
today. "She is not nervous, although she
entertains but little hope of executive
clemency."
Mr. Roberts called to see Maj. Sylvester
yesterday to get from the police department
evidence in support of a claim that
the unwritten law might have been invoked
as a justtfication for her crime.
Mrs. I.omax found a pocketbook on the
table in her husband's room. When she
asked her husband to whom it belonged,
he replied: "That's my sweetheart's."
At the trial of the case, it is stated, no
reference was made to this pocketbook.
The evangelist hopes he will be able to
get enough information about such a
pocketbook to incorporate it In a statement
to be sent to the President.
Another matter that may be brought
before the President is a claim that while
Lomax and his wife were living In a Missouri
avenue house the husband pursued
the 'wife with a razor and forced her to
jump frorti a window. This was . not
brought out at the woman's trial.
Arthur Johnson, colored, sentenced to
die with Mattie Lomax, hopes the Court
of Appeals will come to his rescue and
prevent or stay his execution. His case
is still pending.

SPECIAL MEETING CALLED.
Important Questions Pending Before
Columbia Country Club.
Important problems are to be acted
on at a special meeting of members of
the Columbia Country Club, which will
be held at the New Willard Hotel tomorrow
evening. A constitutional amendment
is to be brought up and probably adopted,
providing for the admission of 200
associate members, of whom only from
fifty to loo are to be admitted in the near
future, the number remaining to be taken
in as the board of governors may later
decide.
The associate members will not be required
to subscribe to the organization
fund, but they will not have the right to
vote or hold office. The initiation fee and
dues, however, are to be the same as the
active members'.
A proposition, framed by the executivefinance
committee, is to be urged upon
the club to permit the board of governors
to recall the present issue of $100,000 of
bonds, bearing 5 rer cent annually, with
Messrs. Donaldson and Eynon as trustees,
and to issue instead $10O,0>X) of bonds,
bearing ?! per cent interest, payable semiannually,
having the Union Trust ComIiany
as trustees.
The special report of the executive committee
shows that the club, which occupies
128 acres on Connecticut avenue not
far from Chevy Chase Lake, now has 4?7
active members, 36 non-resident members
and 0 active special members, a total of

WILIJAM F. DOWNEY.
William F. Downey, who for many
years has conducted a livery stable in
Washington, has opened a horse sales
department in connection with his stables.
For some time Mr. Downey has been interested
in breeding and raising of horses
of fine stock, and recently he purchased
the Falrview stock farm, located at
Seminary station. Fairfax county, Va.,
only nine miles from Washington. This
stock farm will add greatly to his facilities
in maintaining in Washington a
market for horses.
Mr. Downey's new departure will increase
the facilities offered Washingtonlans
in the purchase of both riding
and driving horses. The opportunity of
seeing and trying out the horses, without !
traveling a considerable distance, is of- j
fered. The interest in horseflesh and in
riding and driving in the National Capital
has l>een much increased by the establishment
of the Washington Riding
Club, and by the establishment on a firm
basis of the National Capital Horse Show
Association, which assures Washington
a first-class horse show every year. '
Model Stock Farm.
The Falrview stock farm, purchased by
Mr. Downey, is announced as one of the
best equipped and most fertile stock farm
in Virginia, with modern stables containing
100 box stalls, artesian water, light,
drainage and ventilation. Large exercising
driveways, inside and around stables,
paddocks, good fencing, abundance of
spring and stream water, in every field,
with trained grooms, veterinary service
and every convenience for the care and
training of horses.
The many desirable features contained
in this farm completes Mr. Downey's
sales department by supplying a place
where seasoned, acclimated and thoroughly
trained horses may be obtained, and
where horse owners desirous of summering
and wintering their horses can have
the advantage of a well conducted stock
farm and stables. Mr. Downey has arranged
with some of the largest horse
breeders and shippers to be constantly
supplied with horses for all purposes.
A large stock of saddle and harness
horses is now on exhibition at Mr. Downey's
stables. 1022-28 L street. ,

be confirmed at the regular monthly
meeting of the council Monday evening.
It is understood that a number of citizens
who signed a petition for the appointment
of another citizen of the ward will protest,
but under the charter the town
council is authorized to fill vacancies of
this kind, and the protest will probably be
of no avail.
The remains of Robert J. L. Davidson,
who died Wednesday morning at his home
on Franklin avenue,, were conveyed to
Baltimore yesterday, and funeral services
held in St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal
Church South, of that city. Interment
was made in Loudoun Park cemetery.
Bright's disease caused death. Deceased
is survived by his wife, who was Miss
Emma Denton Godman of Baltimore, and
two sons. He was employed in the office
of the Hyattsville Gas and Electric Lighting
Company.
The oratorical contests which have been
held under the direction of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, in the Methodist
Episcopal churches throughout
Prinoe Georges county, during the last
few months, were concluded Wednesday
evening, at Bell's Church near Camp
Springs. The program included discussions
by six contestants, who had previously
won medals in similar contests.
These were the 'Misses Irene Allen, Florence
Pyles, Eva Hardy, Mabel Everett,
Mazie Carroll and Arthur McNler. The
judges were Thomas H. Lyons* Dr. E
T. Simpson and Rev. Mr. Ryarson. The
medal was awarded Miss Hardy, the
presentation being made by Rev. ?r. Ryarson.
During the evening a musical and
literary program was enjoyed, in which
Mrs. Worcester Brlggs, Miss Esther Germany
and Mr. Germany took part.
State Senator Charles A. Wells says he
will introduce a bill in the comina leais
lature bonding Prince Georges county for i
$100,000, to be apportioned among the four i
road districts for the construction of permanent
roadways. It is proposed to increase
the tax rate 5 cents on each $100,
and with an assessable basis of over $1".- <
000,000, sufficient money -can be raised to
pay the interest on these bonds and create
a sinking fund with which to retire '
the bonds. >
