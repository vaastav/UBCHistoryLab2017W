Gentlemen of the Jury : The caso which

by the Delaware 8 täte Fire aud .Marine In
surance Company, a corporation duly created
by a law of this rttat»» passed i
aud William T. Croasdalo, a citizen of Wil

the plaintiff and lie the defendant. F

Under tho charter granted by the Legisla

tbe testimony of Messrs. Money aud Henry,
who were sometime officers residing at Delà
City, and by William Bright, speaking
as to tbe location of the cotupauy s office at
Wilmington. Tho plaintiff, it uppuai-H by tho
eburter in evidence, had tho right to transact
a stuck insurance business, and ulso a mutual

capital to operate with, and the
needing any as hucIi, but only the obligati

ment of a jury. J'hu parties are therefore at
not only upon tlie
guilty, but also upon tho other defenses
up by tlie defendant, which to repeat are that
the word»
1. ".Substantially true, and tlmt tho samo
wore published properly for public informa
tion. und with no uiuliciuun or mischievous ,
motives."
2. That "they woro matters of common re
port and that the a aid defendant war engaged
in printing and punlishmg the newspaper iu
said declaration uieutionuil, ami was midci
obligation to tho public to print and publish
h common report for tho information and
protection of persons interested in obtaining
insurance." These two pleas aro not valid one.-«
aud ought to have been demurred tu ; but
having been takeu upon them, w
treat them not as defenses to the action, but
rather as pleas in mitigation of damages.
3. "That the statements mude in tho said

punlishiug thereof, were true."
4. "That tbo statements made in the said
supposed libel at aud before the printing and
publishing thereof, were true, and tlie same
were published properly for public iuforma

the pleadings stand, is presented as an answer
to ail tho different counts of the declttruliou,
it follows that if thu defendant has, iu your
upiuiou, succeeded in maint ining either of
tliein, thu plaintiff cannot recover and tlie
defendant is entitled tu your verdict. That is

by tho Kent county mortgage records that

815,000 made tj the plaintiff in this action.
It appears al.-ci, hy tho Kent county dood

« plaintiff. It is plain tlmt this
mortgage was no security whatever for tho
»>' which it represents, thu sheriff's
irtgageil land showing tliut only
could bu obtained for it. Tho
feudaut relies upon this wurthlusssness of
gaged land as a fact sustaining in part
his defense of tho truth of
libels but he is
uy the testimony of Mr. Bright,
who, upon his' oath, states. that
he is president of tho company, plaintiff, and
that he never heard of tho .Murderkill hun
dred mortgage and knows nothing of it.
Whether thu witness speaks truly or not is a
matter for you. If you think ho duos, then
he nm.it be taken to have spokeu from
knowledge of thu company's affairs. If he
spoke, then tho transaction with respect to
the Murderkill hundred land must have boon
between Money and - Myors, which was not

alleged
entered in the books of the company,
evidence thereof tiled with the company's
papers. These facta you must settle f
selves. With respect to the Dul'uge county
(Illinois) laud, taking the testimony with
respect to its value, given by the defendant's
their depositions, wo must
that laud held by the
s worth very little indeed. Wo
• turn to other matters presented by
•
support of the defense,
restigation was made by a eommitteo
witnesses in
treat the mortgag
company
will
tho defendant to sustain his pleas.
The examination of the affairs id' this com
pany by a committee of insurance men of the
diffeteut insurance olîices of Wilmington, and
their report against it, is presented
prominent fact
l'liis i
of competent persons, aided by experienced
counsel, and embodies a statement honestly
made, beyond a fair doubt, of the condition
of this company, tidi ng the report of (,'
missioner limes, of .Maryland,
but the committee do not, from the state
members, appear to have
examined any documents or records whatever
to justify tho conclusion against tho company
which they arrived at, much less did they
investigate the value of any of tho mortgage
securities by inspecting tho mortgaged laud,
or having it done by an agent. Whether
such a report, and the evidence of those who
made it, sustains tho defense of the defond
, is a matter for you to determine.
Again, the defendant produces before you
the report of our own (.'oinmissioner of Insur
ance, John It. McFeo, Esq , about the affairs
of the company, und that is relied iq
proof that the defendant's charges were true.
Mr. Me Fee rejected all other —
the item of cash assets,
the right, but the duty iq
of
lie had uot only
him, to do. for
immediately available as cash,
securities presently convertible
cash, and fouuu a sum remaining, however,
which, according to tho testimony of
William A. Lu.Mutte with respect to the rela
tion of cash assets to liabilities of tbe
Farmers' Fire Insurance Company, of which
he is secretary and treasurer, is greater than
that of his company, tho proportion of cash
assets of that company to its liabilities being
about two per cent, whereas those of the
plaintiff to its liabilities, according to the re
port »if Commissioner McFeu, are about foui
ller cent, by a calculation of percentage by
William A. Keynolds, a competent authority
in matters of arithmetic. This, however,
applies only to the mutual business, and not
to the stock business, winch iu the true sub
ject of examination.
Further, the defendant, for tho purpose of
affecting tin* question of damages, offers
pi'ool of tlm condition of tins company
according to common report. That proof is
the testimony of officers of other insurance
companies doing business in Wilmington. It
does appear by their evidence that this
s iu the business—that
3 of
puny hail a bad
ng tho other companies—and
the witnesses states that he had heard it spuken
of discreditably outside of insurance circles.
It would seem, however, that this reputation
founded upon tho Marylund Commis
sioners report, aud the examination of the
mortgage records by the counsel em
ployed by them, ami went no farther. Now.
the rule with respect to impeachment of

In this connection, it is my duty to call
ution t« the testimony of the expert
the affairs of the com
pany. Mr. William Muir, of Philadelphia, a
gentleman uf large experience iu investigating
the affairs of insurance companies. As u
result of Air. Muir's examination, tho
puny was, in his opinion, not doing business
upon a safe basis, and ho advised Mr. McF'
1 it up ; but then be excluded from i
assets tbe un rtgages which I have passed in
review, and tho notes of Bright and others ,
of the eompauy, and |
looked to nothing us assets but money,
fdiately convertible iuto it. !
this showing the company had not a
ml basis, according to bis notion of simud
: but whether it was therefore a dis
honest concern, a fraud, it is for you to
«lucide. Under the old State banking system
considered safe to circulate a
greater proportion of paper than three dollars
• one of eoiu to redeem it with, and a bank
that did it was not considered
sound banking business according to financial
theories cf banking. But it was nevertheless
that most hanks did keep out a larger
than three for oue, and
proved in tho end to bo very hunest banks
notwithstanding- This concern may have
been guilty ot gross imprudence in c inducting
its business, and not been fraudulent
doing after all. Aud it is to be conndured
that no proof has been made that any iusured
party, except perhaps 0110 in its early stage,
ever lo»t a dollar by it ; although there is
proof that some settled nt less than the

You have tho proof by Dr. Tantum r
amount the compuuv hits paid in 1
is. 1 think, over $17,01)0.
1 think, gentlemen of the jury, that I have
gone over tlie material grounds of the defense
made iu this caso, and they aro now left for
. . • consideration along with tho
souted by tho plaintiff ; but v
by t«i consider yourselves restricted to what I
have laid betöre you, but are to review and
examine nil and every thing the parties have
offered to you in their behalf respectively,
and endeavor to do perfect justice between
them. But before committing the matter to
you entirely, it is proper that I should repeat
what tho Court take tho law to be by which
you are t»i be governed. *
We hate said to you that tho words alleged
in the declaration to have been written aud
J. It
pro
aru not there
j published bv the defendant, are libelous ; w
have further said that, if you
the evidence which 1 have called your att
turn to - his editorship-iu-chief of'the pup,,.,
that the charges are editorial matter, that
they were not writtou by the assistant editors
far ah they know by the other persons
spokeu of by them who sometimes wrote
editorials, and that the publication manager!
sent all matter delivered to him for publica- I
tion to the type setters I say if you are satis
tied by these facts, and the knowledge an
editor must have or what is done with liis
effusions, that the defendant wrote the arti
cles of libel, then other questions are to be
considered ; but if you are not, you should
say so by a verdict of "not guilty," which, as
I have said, will terminate the case. But if
«hall bt. »iitl#fiud tlmt tho dofuudant com
posed these libels for publication, then vou
are to determine whether the charges made
. It they are true.und were published
lor the sole and proper purpose of public in
formation, lie should have your verdict ; but
really published by him
maliciously, that is, not for an honest, fair
purpose, and not properly and solely for pub
lic inf urination, but from ill will to'the plaui
tiffs, and for the purpose of gratifying his
personal malevolence against it, and* to do it
mischief and injury, he should not, but you
should find against him. For although the
perfect defense against un alleged
libel, yet the law will not allow any one to
it aguilist another to shield his own malevo
lence, but on tho contrary will punish
• bis malice. If you aro satisfied that the
charges mudu by tho defendant are not true,
or rather were not true at the time they were
made, then your verdict should be that lie is
"guilty."
i be counsel for the defendant has urged
Upon us the consideration that if your verdict
should ho against their client, you should ho
