Any direct or specific allusion to the

ahly lx- thought out of place in the
Prc idents message and therefoie the
public will not be mprisBd at tlie al
aeno af any such allusion in the pr
message of President HarriiMin That the
tions might have some
influence upon the recommend
message or its treatment of some of
the qncatione and measures ujxjn which
the American eafie are supposed to
have expressed their opinion in Novein
ber would not have been unreasonable to
sport If there le any naaaasa who
cherished such an exectatiem however
they will find themselves disapjointed
There iv not one sylable in the message
Man that President Harrison at
taci idlest importane e or signifi
cance to the expression of the opinions of
a majority of his countrymen

or the wrk of the Fifty first Congress in
its first session Only one thing is evi

countrymen

while American companions every

This is not only witty but wise but then
it smacks of free trade and of course
nothing looking in that direction has any
ce under the high tariff regime We

drams and the trumpets seem
to have caught the echoes of the recent

THE BAKKTMUA CASE AGAIN
For the first time probably in the his
tory of the country the Presidents mes
sage yestertlay contained an item of
news The recall of Minister Mizner for
hie connection with the assassination of
Gen Barrundia which was announced
in the message had not been previously
made public although it was generally
believed tliat the administration would
decide on this step The action of the
President was particularly pleasing to
Representative McCreary of Kentucky
as it sustained the position taken by him
in his nssseh in the House just felon
the close of the last session Gov Mc
Creary it will lie remembered intro
duced a resolution calling ujion the
President for the correspondence in the
Mizuer llarrundia affair and as no ans
wer had liecn made to this resolution he
held a conference with his colleaga
the Foreign Affaire Committee last Sun
day night a to the sssper Hue of further
action
The statement in the Presidents
message said Go McCreary to a Post
rejiorter yesterday removes the neces
sity for any further steps in the matter
I disagree with the President on the
silver question the force bill and the
tariff but in this matter he is right He
simply follows all precedent and sus
tains the dignity of the nation MSesV

CHEAP RAILUUAU iAUKS
We gave a short time since an ace tint
of the zone tariff svstem of railway fares
adopted in Hungary and the really re
markable results that have accrued It
has proved that cheap railway fan
rying a jiassenger for the same Mini over
a distance of ten miles and parting up
the cost for every additional ten miles
the charge in even- instance being at
the lowest ossible rate will produce
profit to the railroad esssnssnea
than fares that are charged by the mile
The success of the Hungarian system of
zones has been so marked that
it has bees introduced in Austria
anil the surprising results have just
lieen described ly Prof E J
James liefore the Manufacturers
Club of Philadelphia There as else
where on the continent and in England
irs are divided into three classes
first second and third class and the
rates of fare are charged accordingly
The zone system in Austria retains the
same classification but reduces the rate
of fare projiortionately in all The most
remarkable effect ie the increase of jias
senger railway traffic by second and
third class That it should be so is saw
at all wonderful It is but another illus
tration of the change that was brought
alout by the reduction of the price of
letters to two and carrying the reduction
through all departments of the mail ser
rding to Prof James Aus
tria has now the cheat est railroad fares
in the world usual rate for third class
Is ing only six and a half mills jer mile
r six dollars and fifty cents for one
thousand miles while it costs in the
Fnited States from twenty to thirty dol
lars to travel the same distance Com
mutation tickets he says are still
lower Forlsesl travel a workman can
l to and from his work for two cents s
trip up to six miles for four cents up to
twelve miles six cents up to eighteen
miles and ten cents up to thirty miles
Yearly tickets g hk for thirty mile trips
Id for seventeen dollars and forty
cents The most curious tiling he
hat these fares are proving
inle to the railroads from the
enormous increase in passenger traffic
Prof Jsssei regards this sue a
cheep fares on the Austrian and Hun
garian roads as suggestive of the still
greater profit to be derived from the
zone system on American roads
C N CLAY JR
- us M Clay Jr doesnt brag
much on himself as an orator but it
should not therefore be rashly inferred
that he cant sjK ak and speak well ra
tory comes as natural to a Clay as crajis
to a darky and though the present candi
date for Governor i only remotely con
nected with the great Henry still bis
branch of the family knows how to talk
and to talk effectively
-his M Clay Jr is a son of the late
Bratus J Clay who was a memlierof the
Thirty eighth Congress and a prominent
anu weathly farmer and stock raiser of
Bourbon county Brutus J Clay wasthe
son of Gen Green Clay of Madison far
mer soldier and statesman one of the
noted pioneeis of the State who trans
mitted to all his descendants that intreji
id spirit ami mental and physical power
which he himself had received from his
ancestors a Welsh baronet through one
of the adventurous members of Sir Wal
ter Raleighs colonial expedition
sius M Clay Jr is a nephew of Cassius
M Clay Sr the old lion of White Hall
Madison county who looks out from his
ancestral lair and occasionally growls his
displeasure with the times whose great 1
est sensations tame by comparison with
the stirring events of his own career His
nephew has the same vigorous spirit and
the same intellectual stiength Ca sius
M Clay Jr 1ms never been afflicted
with much ambition He has preferred
the life of a Kentucky country gentleman
upon his splendid estates in Bourbon
But his mettle has been tried and he
stood the test He is a man absolutely
without fear having always the courage
of his convictions prompt decisive mas
terful and with the qualities which go to
make up the clear headed leader and the
successful organizer He is a king bee in
a convention There is not a lazy bene
in his body He has a bead to plan a
vitality that keeps him hustling and a
will to execute When fortune smiles
he is not flattered into indiscretion and
when the fickle dame frowns he never
gets panicky Opiosition develops in
him resources and daring Tall and erect
w ith strong features a clear penetrating
glance and on air of poise and of indomi
table courage he is a man who rises to
his best in an emergency In the State
Senate three years he led the memorable
tight against the railroad lobby and was
the only member of the committee to in
vestigate the lobby who did not lose his
head when the railroads developed such
strength in the House and assumed an
attitude of defiance annd retaliation To
that and to his hustling he owes his
m as President of the Constitution
al Convention a position in which he
has given increasing satisfaction being
firm and ready and a born parliamentar
ian
As intimated above Mr Clay can make
a good speech But Mr Brown can
make a better Mr Brown also knows
how to organize But at that game Clay
c ould probably give him half and beat
him out Clay is too good a general to
risk his fight to the stump but he is too
will speak together and their
speeches will be worth going to hear
Brown may thrill the crowd and gut the
most hurraing but Clay will make a good
speech and will not lose his head because
he can not make a better Then they
will get out among the mercham
the farmers and the horny handed toil
ers and Clay will shake hands with ten
men while Brown is bidding one good
morning The strength of one is the
others weakness It is a pretty match
and when they meet in a State conven
tion it will be a battle of skill and mani
pulation and here is where Clay will le
strongest Jjnuitrilk Timet

Those who in the last few years have
been in a position to purchase good breed
ing stock and thus get their herds in tine
shape for the successful prosecution of
their business and have not done so have
made a great mistake At no time in
the history- of the- country- have all kinds
of breeding stick been as low on average
as they have been for some years Many
thoughtful men have availed themselves
of this to prepare themselves for making
money in the decade which is now open
ing Others thoroughly dise ou raged by
the circumstances with which they were
surrounded and believing that no good
from stock raisini could ever be realized
again have given up in despair and al
lowed opportunities to pass them which
in better times would have been gladly
etabrseed He whose herds are made
up of choice animals bought within a re
cent period jKjssesses stock worth inmost
SOto than he paid for it and is al
most certain within a reasonable length
