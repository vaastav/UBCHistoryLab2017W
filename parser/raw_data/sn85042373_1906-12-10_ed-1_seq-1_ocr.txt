LAWS
Matter of Patent Rights Will Also
Come Up for Consideration and
Probably for Legislation—Big Con.
cerns Said to Have Gained Control
of Product of Musical Artists.
(By E. C. Snyder.)
Washington, D. C.t Dec. 10.—The
committee on patents of the house of
representatives Is not usually a very
active body of law framers But ev
ery-year or two some one gets crazy
on the subject of the copyright laws
and then this particular committee
has to "get busy for fair" as one of
the members slanglly put it today
Next week the committee will join
with a similar body from the senate
and will sit In the handsome senate
reading room of the congressional lib
rary for the purpose of hearing argu
ments for and against the proposal
to extend the copyright laws to card
board rolls used in self-playing pian
os, etc. Very naturally the man who
composes a march or a song or any
other musical work and who takes1 the
trouble to copyright his production
does not care to hear It played by
hand organs, street pianos or beer
garden pianolas without his consent.
Consequently he comes to congress
and asks that he be given the protec
tion of the copyright laws to a great
er extent than he now enjoys. On
the other hand the manufacturers of
mechanical piano players assert that
one or two concerns have foreclosed
upon every artiste in the world and
that the extension of the copyright
law to pieces of perforated cardboard
will simply place In the hands of "the
trust" another Othello-like pillow
with which to smother the suffering
people who are dying for canned mu
sic.
The joint committee which has
this matter up for consideration hopes
to be able to devise some law which
will ensure a royalty to the compos
er without crippling the music roll in
dustry which has grown to enormous
proportions, by the way, as it is as
serted that upwards of ten million
dollars are invested in mechanical
piano playing plants in the United
States.

U. S. to Retain Title to Lands
Containing Mineral—A
Bill Preparing.
(By E. C. Snyder.)
Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.—Pol
lowing the suggestion contained in
the president's message with respect
to coal lands, Senator Hansbrough is
at work oh a bill which he will in
troduce at an early date, reserving to
the government the title to all coal
land property contained In the public
domain, allowing settlement for any
purpose and reserving the right to
settlers to use for their own needs
any coal found on the lands filed by
them. The bill will also contain a
clause authorizing the government to
develop the coal properties by leasing
them or allowing them to be worked
under a royalty system.
In other words it is the purpose of
the senator to amend the homesteaa
law so as not to retard settlement and
at the same time to reserve to the
government the title to the coal de
posits upon the public domain. He is
in receipt of' letters from different
parts of the west setting forth that
the withdrawal of large areas of land
supposed to contain coal is working
injury to settlement.

010. S. GOVERNMENT
Committee on Indian Affairs Has Rt
ports of Importance to Render at
Present Term of Congress—Okla
homa Aborigines Starving to Death
in the Midst of Plenty.
(By E. C. Snyder.)
Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.—Within
the next few weeks a sub-committee
of the senate committee on Indian af
fairs will submit a report upon the
subject of the Indian land holdings in
the new state of Oklahoma, which will
show a very peculiar state of affairs.
This sub-committee consists of sen
ators Clark of Wyoming, Clark of
Montana, Brandigee, Teller and Long.
For nearly two months they have been
making a personal inquiry into exist
ing conditions, and It Is doubtful if
there was ever before a party of
"visiting men" who worked so indus
triously as did the five senators from
the committee on Indian affairs. They
positively refused everything in the
way of entertainment during their
stay in the embryo state, but devoted
their entire time to a careful inquiry
into conditions existing, and to the
necessity of a change in the law.
When the United States first under
took the task of making citizens out
of the aboriginal population it became
the policy of the government to divide
land holdings in severalty among the
various tribes. In order that the newly
created citizens might not be robbed
of their ample holdings it was provid
ed that the allotments of land should
not pass from the original Indian pat
entee for a specified period, usually
tweny or twenty-five years. In the
meantime these homesteads were ex
empted from al'l taxes during the
period of what might be termed "in
cubatory ownership."
The North American is a born gamb
ler. In this he differs very little from
the members of the Aryan or even the
Mongol race. But the Caucasian legis
lator for the red son of the forest and
the plain proposed to protect the hold
ings of Lo and all his brothers even if
he pauperized the Indian in doing this.
The theory upon which the law makers,
backed by the philanthropists, pro
ceeded was altruistic, but it has not
met the results expected. Every west
ern istate in which there is a large
body of Indian ciitzens has appealed
for relief from its taxation burdens,
and practically every Indian has beg
ged to be released from the Utopian
condition which "his friends" have
tried to force upon him.
The senate committee found in that
portion of Oklahoma designated as
the "Indian territory" literally hun
dreds of Indians who are virtually
starving to death because they cannot
dispose of their surplus lands. Under
the method of land distribution which
was generally followed each Indian^
family of say five persons has beeif
given about 1,200 acres of land. Under
the regulations of the department of
the interior the Indian family, or its
head, is permitted to lease his lands
only from year to year, and never
for a period longer than five years.
He, or they, cannot sell an acre, and of
course cannot borrow on mortgage.
The committee discovered that thirty
acres is about the absolute limit of
the amount which can be cultivated
by the average Indian family, and
unless he has animals and tools
Papa Indian cannot handle even
so much. There are literally thou
sands of Indian children, each the
owner of from 100 to 400 acres of
some of the best land "out of doors"
who are unable to attend school be
cause they cannot swap an acre of
land for a shirt, while hundreds of
other equally wealthy in lands are
actually suffering for the necessities of
life, and yet the. legislation which
makes them paupers was enacted with
the best of intention toward the In
dians.
The committee Is trying to formu
late some plan which will assure the
Indians adequate protection for their
homes against the rapacity of the
whites, and will at the same time per*
mit them to sell or lease their sur
plus holdings without such restrictions
as no white man would submit to for
an hour. The lands in question are
those of the Five Civilized Tribes, In
dians who have for twenty years lived
as white men, and who are as well pre
pared to take care of themselves to
day as they will ever be in this world.
