senate Takes Up Cummins Rail
Bill and House Attacks Ap
propriations. Washington, Dec 2. Omission of
treaty in the president's inessage to
congress today met with general satis
faction among Republican and Demo
crat Senate leaders, who are quite
willing to leave the treaty in its pigeon
hole until important legislation is
passed or compromise effected.
In all private discussions of senator
and in ome public statements, there
was much speculation today as to
what extent the president's illness had
handicapped the actual preparation of
the message. Democrats declared
President Wilson's vigorous beliefs on
public questions shown by the lan
guage of the message shows his mind
ro be unimpaired by illness. Repub
licans speculated as to how far his
advisers aided him and indicated the
iieliof that the message was not up to
the usual form. - - - -
Senator Frelihghuysen, republican,
of Xew Jersey,. , said the message
titled to take up some important
public problems and "reflects the
views of Attorney General Palmer,
Secretary of Labor Wilson and Samuel
Gompers and that they undoubtedly
assisted him in its preparation." :
Edare, republican of New Jersey said
it certainly lacks the usual VWilson
punch."
McKellar, democrat of Tennessee.
characterized the message a "genuine
unadulterated Wilson message.'
Lnderwood, democrat of Alabama-
declared it up to the president's fine
standard. -
Hitchcock, actlns Democrat Sprto
leader said: "But few messages have
ever pointed the way to more enlight
ened remedies for existing evils."
congress got into full swine with
the receipt of the president's message
and the senate took up the Cummins
railroad bill, hoping to pass It before
Christmas. House leaders arranged
for immediate attack on the annual ap
propriation bills. - "
The House today adopted the con
ference report on the Edge bill author
izing foreign tade financing corpora
tions and the measure now goes to the
president.
Tho regular weekly meeting of
President Wilson's cabinet was post
poned today, a number of the cabinet
officers planned to be at the capitol
to hear the president's annual message.

BUDGET SYSTEM
IS ADVOCATED
President's Message Deals With
Financing and Other
Problems. :
TREATY BE UP LATER
Recommendations On Readjust
ment of Nation Embodied
. in Able Document.
Washington. Dec. 2. General rec
ommendations on legislation to conr
bat the cost of living, - labor unrest,
radicalism, and a readjustment of the
nation to a peace time, basis were the
features of President Wilson's annual
message to congress delivered today.
The peace treaty, the president told
congress, would be discussed In a sep
arate message later, as will the rail
road question.
For the second time only since the
president established the practice of
addressing congress in person, his mes
sage was read today by the clerks.
The president's principal recommen
dations were:
establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation
system with simplification of the in
come and excess profits. i
Readjustment of the tariff system,
if necessary, to meet 'changed world
conditions and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
States is "the greatest capitalist in
the world." " '
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the -world war, particularly
In the way of government . farms as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the war
to keep the United States independent
of foreign supply. ' . . ,
; An enlarged program for rural de
velopment, in recognition of the farm
er's part In the war. ' ;;,:
,Measure -v that?' -will "remove ...the
causes" of Apolitical restlessness in our
body politic" .. - .
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the causes for the un
rest "are superficial rather than deep
seated," and that they "arise from or
are connected with the failure on the
part of our government to arrive speed,
lly at a just and permanent peace per
mitting return to normal conditions,
from the transfusion of radical theo
ries from seething European centers
pending such delay, from heartless
profiteering resulting from the increase
of the, cost of living, and lastly from
the machinations . of passionate and
malovilent agitators. W'ith the re
turn to normal conditions this unrest
will rapidly disappear."
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal f
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods, would abrogate our
time tested institutions."
v Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous Ones, were made by
the president to bring down the cost of
living. Among them were extension of
the food control law to peace times
for the emergency; regulations for
transportation of foods In interstate
commerce; a cold storage law modeled
after the law in New Jersey; a law
requiring marks to show the length of
time the foods are kept in storage
and a law to secure "competitive sell
ing and prevent unconscionable
profits," by federal license of corpora
tions selling food in interstate com
merce. A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
program to bring about an improve
ment in the conditions of labor," and
bring about "a genuine democratization
of industry," was recommended.
"The 'only way to keep men from
ua(m ne-ainst grievances Is to re
move the grievances," said the presi
dent's message. At anoiner poun n
declared, "the seed of revolution Is re
pression." - . .
"The ' establishment of the : princi
ples regarding labor, laid down in the
covenant of the League of Nations,
said the message, "offers us the way to
industrial peace and conciliation. No
.cA hm onen to us. 'Gov
ernments must recognize the right of
men to bargain collectively ior Hu
mane objects. Labor must no
longer be treated as a commodity.
"The right of individuals to strike
is Inviolate," continued the message,
"and ought not to be interfered with
by any process of government, but
there is a predominant right and, that
is the right of the government to pro
tect all of its people and to assert its
power and majesty against the dial-
lone A nf nnv class."
The president was referring to the
government's recent injunction against
the coal strike. -.
: The message closed with a pointed
reference to radicalism, and red doc
trines and referred to "Russia today
with its blood and terror," as a "pain
ful object lesson of : the power of
minorities.".
"Thore are those ' in this coun
try," said the ' message, ''who

State Department's Attitude
Characterized As Impatient
- in Jenkins Case.
Washington, Dec. 2. "With much
impatience the state department to
day awaited word from Mexico City
of the release of Consular Agent Jen
kins in response to the . sharp note to
Carranza A new sidelight was thrown
on the general, Mexican kidnapping
situation today in a report of the re
cent capture by rebels at Zacatecas of
Norman Rowe, a British subject.
Rowe was held for ransom,, but quick
ly released at the instance of the Car
ranza government when the British
Vice Consul took the case up at Mex
ico City. The military authorities were
seeking to rescue Rowe a few hours
after that. , , " .
Mexico City. Monday, Dec. 1. An
nouncement was made at the Mexican
foreign office late last night that the
last American note had not been de
livered. First intimations as to the
nature "f , the communication sent to
Mexico by Secretary of State Lansing
was given by dispatches to this city
by the Associated Press.
It was learned at the American em
bassy there were numerous errors in
the cable transmission of the note
which probably ' explains the delay in
its presentation. .
Hilario Medina, under-secre tar y, of
foreign- relations,, declared today
treaties existing between Mexico and
the United States make no provision
for the exemption of consular agents
from the jurisdiction of federal trlbun.
als "for which reason W. Oi Jenkins,
the United States . consular agent at
Puebla, because of. whose imprison
ment a delicate situation has arisen
between the two countries, cannot
claim immunity as has been suggested
by his friends." . .
Senor Medina stated the treaty of
friendship and commerce between the
United States and Mexico, drawn -to
1831 and renewed In 1848 established
no immunity in favor of consuls.

STRIKERS FACE
EARLY ARREST
Indianapolis Judge of Opinion
Miners and Operators
In Cahoots.
RESTRICTIONS GENERAL
Seriousness Situation May Be
Increased By Anthracite
Workers Joining in.
Indianapolis, Ind Dec. 2. That
mine operators and mine workers ap
pear to be in cahoots to bleed the pub
lic was the opinion of Federal District
Judge Anderson expressed today in
talking to a miner who
with Illegal sale of liquor. This miner
saia ne reared for his life if he at
tempted to return to work. Question
ing of another miner brought out the
fact that he was married and had five
children; owned his own home and an
automobile. Working conditions will
have to be improved for this man, the
judge remarked.
Indications here tonight were ar
rests will be made within the forty
eight hours on charges of violation of
the federal court injunction against
coal strikers.
Springfield, 111., Dec. 2. Soft' coal
miners on strike here may have the
support of miners of the eastern an
thracite fields if they become hard
pressed, President Farrington, of the
Illinois miners declared today.
Washington, Dec. 2. Senator John
son, democrat, of South Dakota, to
day introduced a resolution calling on
Secretary of the Treasury to report
the actual profits of coal operators be
tween 1916 and 1919. Senator Smoot,
republican, of Utah, opposed immediate
consideration, suggesting that it go
over for a day or two as he believed
concurrent action by th'e house and
senate necessary. J " :; -
Chicago, Dec. 2. Restrictions on
the use of coal already put into effect
by regional coal committees where the
pinch of necessity Jiad bees felt today
were extended throughout the nation
under an order of the federal fuel ad
ministrator. The most extensive shut
down of industry in history was in
prospect and domestic consumers were
preparing to endure privation and dis
comfort as the strike of bituminous
coal miners entered its second month.
Only in Kansas, where volunteers were
in the strippits under protection of
state and federal troops and in the
New River field of West Virginia, was
there prospects today of increased pro
duction. In Kansas seven pits were
working and in West Virginia opera
tors said normal production was in
sight by the end of the week. Through
out the remainder of the country,
however, miners apparently remained
steadfast in their determination not to
return" to work under the 14 per cent,
wage increase ordered by the federal
government and acceded to by the
operators.
In Wyoming new labor troubles
threatened to decrease the small
amount of coal being brought out. Ex
cept for brief shut downs at the be
ginning of the strike and twice since,
the mines in that state generally had
maintained operation.
Members of the railroad brother
hoods in Kansas today were expected
to act on a resolution adopted last
night to request authority to refuse, to
handle coal mined by non-union
workers.
Under the sweeping order of Fuel
administrator Garfield limiting deliv
ery of fuel or power only to essential
consumers in the first five classes of
the war priorities list, curtailment of
production was inprospect in factories
turning out boots and shoes, brass and
bronze manufactures, clothing, ma
chinery (except where specifically ex
empted); iron and steel; jewelry, mar
ble and stone production, musical in
struments, paper goods, (newsprint ex.
cepted) ; rubber goods, cigars, wagons
and carriages, wood manufacturers,
sheet and metal products, leather
goods, mattresses, paints and var
nishes, photographic supplies and mis
cellaneous non-essentials.
CARLISLE SHOT

Carlisle, the artful 'train robber, who
for three weeks laughingly defied civil.
'railroad and private detectives, was
captured this afternoon near Glend.
' Wyomipg after being shot through the
lung. He was brought to a hospital
here and doctors said he might not
j live. Carlisle fought desperataly be-
'fore being taken. "I am glad the chase
lhas ended," he said later.
'CONSULAR AGENTS
AKiu uun ixw Jt judo
Laredo, Dec. 2. Unconfirmed re
ports from Mexico today were that
many American consular agents and
others are resigning their : posts and
others are preparing to leave because
of the Jenkins case and the feeling of
insecurity of the Americans in Mexico.
NEW FUEL LAW
IS INTERPRETED
Lengthy Wire from Regional
Committee Gives Specific
Information.
ORDER IS DRASTIC ONE
Darkened Streets and Business
Places Evidence Coopera
tion in Pensacola.
"Very careful consideration was
ColiM thffUthern Regional Coal
Committee today to requests coming
from every section of the region for
rtMtati? f the fuel "sumption
restrictions issued on November "9
? a number of urgent appeals for
modifications of the regulations in fa--vor
of certain industries and lines of
business."
Foregoing is a statement by the
regional fuel administration commit-
w in Atlanta, received in Pensacola
by wire last night and in connection
with this statement a summarv of the
more important conclusions reached
with reference to application of the
fuel conservation- regulations are
given that will be a source of impor
tant information to local people who,
as a whole, are manifesting a desire
and disposition to comply with the
regulations, but who in many cases
are understood to be falling short for
lack of specific and definite instruc
tions. Dimly lighted streets and darkened
show windows and places of business
generally throughout the city last
night evidenced the disposition of lo
cal merchants and business people to
live up to the fuel regulations, which
are held by some to be even more
drastic than during the world war.
Following is a summary of the more
important conclusions reached.
(1) The regulations apply alike to
industries, stores and business houses
actually burning coal oir or other -fuel
in their plant and to those using elec
tric power whether hydro-electric or
steam this question was given most
serious consideration. The decision
was based both upon the well-known
fact that most of the hydro-electric
utilities consume a certain amount of
coal varying with the amount of water
power available and upon the convic
tion that to make any exception would
involve indefensibly discrimination and
endanger the whole plan of conser
vation the execution of which is im
perative for the safety of the country.
In this connection it may be stated
that hydro-electric power now is be
ing diverted under direction of this
committee from various points of pro
duction to distant communities where
users are largely dependent upon steam
produced electricity and the "refer"
power saved by the restrictions at
points of production is saving coal
elsewhere.
(2) Operation of laundries and clean
ing plants is considered essential from
the standpoint of public health there
fore the restrictions do not apply to
such establishments.
(3) The committee was convened on
the necessity for extending the hours
of business of grocery and meat stores
and milk depots and a modification of
the regulations was issued permitting
such places of business to remain open
until 6:00 p. m. daily except Saturday
when their closing hour is 9:00 p. m.
(4) Many merchants and others
urge that they be allowed to open be
fore 9:00 a. 'm., and close later than
4:00 p. m. on condition that they use'
no lights or heat or used candles or
kerosene lamps. No exception of this
kind can be made; any exceptions
would result in discrimination and tend
to nullify efforts to enforce the regu
lations. (5) Dance halls are classified as
places of public amusements.
(6) Pool and Billiard Rooms, bow
ling alleys, shooting galleries and simi.
lar establishments are classed as places
of public amusement. The manage
ment of such places where cigars, to
bacco, or soft krink stands are main
tained may if they desire operate un
der the regulations applying to the
merchant; If so they cannot call them
selves places of public amusement or
observe the hours fixed for such places.
Those who elect to be classed as pub
lic amusements will not be permitted
to run their cigar and tobacco or soft
drink stands after 4:00 p. m.
(7) Cigar and tobacco stands in
hotels, restaurants and office build
ings, railroad stations and other pub
lic places will be required to observe
the hours fixed for mercantile estab
lishments generally, except that such
stands may open for the sale of news
papers and periodicals without re
striction. (8) Packers and other wholesale
handlers of perishable food products
are regarded as exempted from the
regulations so far as may be necessary
for the proper conduct of their busi
ness. (9) Fruit stands and confectionery
will be required to observe the same
hours as other stores where sand
wiches or other food is served as such
stands or at soft drink or cigar and
tobacco departments of stores such
