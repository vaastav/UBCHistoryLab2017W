"WHEELING. DECEMBER 4. 11KX).
The President's Message!
It Is customary for partisan c
papers speaking of the Pres- e
Jdent representing their political
' belief to characterize his message
to Congress as the "most able document
ever written," but without political
bias or party partiality, vve think
wo can refer to President McKInley's
message, sent to Congress yesterday, as
a clear, forcible and unequivocal presentment
of the affairs of the nation,
a document that will well repay perusal.
The document opens with a brief sur-vey
of the growing strength and increasing
power for good of republican
institutions and American liberty
at the outgoing of the old and the Incoming
of the new century. The Chinese
problem is made the dominant
question In our foreign Intercourse and
' an elaborate review Is made of the de'
talis of military operations and diplo
matic steps taken In the progress of the
settlement up to the present time, and
which have been made known to the
public by official announcements in the
past.
The securement of an adequate guar
antee for liberty or faith is put rorwaru
as one of the essential factors of a dur- ^
abh? adjustment of the present difficulties'in
.the Flowery Kingdom. Touching
the question of indemnity the President
says: "I am disposed to think that due
compensation may be made In part by
increased guarantees of security for
foreign rights and immunities, and,
most Important of all, by the opening
of China-to the equal commerce of all
the world. These views have been and
will be earnestly advocated by our representatives."
In the event of protracted divergence
of views In the negotiations the President
favorably Inclines to Russsa's suggestion
that the matter of indemnities
be relegated to the court of arbitration
at the Hague.
After expressing satisfaction over
some minor foreign matters, the President
takes up the isthmian canal project.
Regarding the Nicaraguan canal,
the Information Is given that the Nlcaraguan
government shows a disposition
to take measures to promote the water
way, after having declared the sostyled
Eyro-Cragin option void, The<
report of the convention. It Is recommended,
may be awaited. The convention
with Great Britain to remove any
wujctuuus wjiii;u nii&ui iwise uui oi me
Clayton-Bulwer treaty to the construc- '
tJon of the canal Ik commended to the (
early attention of the senate.
The outlook for the passage of the i
Nicaragua bill ivas brightened somewhat
by the press dispatches yesterday i
morning conveying the Intelligence that 1
Secretary Hay and Senor Correan, the
Nlcara^uan minister, on Saturday sign- ,
ed a treaty whereby Nicaragua concedes
to the United States the rights and priv- ,
lieges for the construction of the Nica- (
rngua canal. Nicaragua Is to free her- j
self of any treaties that would abridge
the privileges of the United States, and (
is to be paid 15.000.000 in the securities ,
of the Canal Construction Company.
This leaves the way perfectly clear for j
Congress to ?cL
The financial operations by the gov- j
eminent during the year are reviewed
In riftnll. "It will bo tht* flutv. nn 1 am
euro it will be tho disposition of the
Congress," says the President, "to provide
whatever further legislation In
neoded to Insure the parity under all
conditions between our two forma of i
metallic money, silver and gold."
Touching: the deposition of the surplus
the President recommends u reduction
of Internal revenue war taxes In the
sum of JCO.OQO.OOO. " "This reduction
should be secured by the remission of
(hog*taxes which experience has shown
to be the most burdensome to the Industries
of the people." The Inclusion In
tho reduction Is specially urged of the
legacy tax bequests for public uses of a
literary, educational or charitable character.
In record to combinations of capital
org&nlied Into trusts, the President reiterates
his deliverance on this subject
in his last message, adding that "restraint
upon such combinations as are
Injurious, and which are within federal
Jurisdiction, should be promptly applied
fty the Congress."
Tho treatment of the Philippine question
consists larg'ly of n review of
events and nets there during the pnst
year, recalling, the President's determination
to await the decision of the
will of Congress as to tho establishment
of a form of government, He report*
favorable progress towards pacification
and the institution of local government.
Increased needs of the army by reason
of th? oew porawwlons, the country's
:oast defenses, and new army post*, la
jointed out, and the necessity In the
mmediate future of from 45.000 to $0,00fr
nen in the Philippines is stated. "It
nust be apparent," says the President,
'that we will require an army of 00,000
rnd that during present conditions In
?uba and the Philippines the President
ihould have authority to Increase the
'orce to the present number of 100,000,
included in this number, authority
ihould be given to raiso native troops
n the Philippines up to 15,000, which the
raft commission believe will be more
directive In di'tcctlng and suppressing
fuerillas, assassins, and la drones tha*
>ur own soldiers."
Attention Is called afresh to the necjssity
for amendment of the alien conTact
law and Important features of the
ightful application of the eight-hour
aw /or the benefit of labor and of the
>rinc!pal of arbitration are commended
o Congrtas.
These arc but the sallertt points of a
veil ordered and thoughtful message,
rhe President concludes his paper by
eloquently admonishing Congress that
'in our great prosperity we must guard
igalnst the danger it invites of extrava:ence
in government expenditures and
ipproprlatlons; and the chosen repre
etatlves ot the people will, I doubt not,
urnlah an example.in their legislation
if that wise economy which in a season
if plenty husbands for the future. In
hla era of great business activity and
pportunity, caution is not untimely. It
*111 not abate, but strengthen, confllence.
It will not retard, but promote,
egltlmate industrial and commercial
ixpansion. Our growing power brings
vlth it temptations and perils requiring
constant vigilance to avoid. It must
lot be ured to Invite conlllcts, nor for
>PPresslon, but for the most effective
Maintenance of those principles of
^quality and Justice upon which our Initiations
and happiness depend. Let
is keep always in mind that the founlatJon
of our government is liberty; its
iupcrstructure peace."
Compulsory Conciliation.
The Civic Federation of Chicago has
ailed a conference of the laborer, the
employe and the capitalist to meet early
his month In that city to discuss the
irbltratlon of labor disputes and the
ronclllatlon of labor and capital, and in
his connection the report of United
States Consul Dillingham, at^Auckiand,
>n labor legislation in Xew Zealand,
vlll be quite Interesting. He says the
abor laws of that colony were enacted
n the effort to regulate certain condllons
affecting employer and employed.
["heJr seppe embraces many difficult
impositions into which the exigencies
>f modern industrial life have forced
hose engaged in the trades and handi:rafts.
The general tendency of the
'complusory conciliation" law, say It*
luppuntrg, is iv umcjiura.ic me pu?iuuu
>f the worker by preventing social oppression
through undue influences and
he unsatisfactory conditions of sanltaion.
"It will doubtless be found," says Mr.
Dillingham, "that, with the advance ol
:ime, these laws are capable of great
m prove m en t and amendment; but they
lave already, their friends assert, done
nueh to make the lives of operatives of
'uller and more healthy growth. Their
ilm Is to check abuses before these obaln
formidable dimensions; but that
hose laws have not prevented abuses
s pretty generally admitted, and, Inasnuch
as the "rosy" side of the question
ia3 heretofore been given In reports
published In the United States, 1 deem
t.advisable to give the other side as
sell."
This "conciliation law" is solely for
:he benefit of the unionist laborer; nonmlonlsts
have no status under its provision*.
In other words. It would appear
that the non-unionist can sell his
abor If he can get an employer to run
h^ risk of encountering vexatious and
expensive legal proceedings, Instituted
jy some union for engaging him, instead
of a unionist.
In citing the workings of the law, the j
ttnsul^Says that "if A. being a unionist,
lpplles for work, and B, a non-unionist,
Applies, and the employer, knowing the !
ion-unionist and believing him to be
:he better workman, engages hlrn. then
\ could set the law in motion, make the
preference to the non-unlonlst at? 'industrial
dispute,' and put the employer
lo the trouble and expense of trying to
justify his employment of B Instead of
A. What employer will run that risk?
He finds It less expensive to Bubmlt to
the law and employ the less competent
man, whom he docs not want, than to
fight it. In theory, he need only employ
the unionist If he be equally capable;
but, as the proving of the equal
rapacity involves a lawsuit, the theory
Is Impracticable."
Here are some very choice nuts for the
Civic Federation Congress to crack on
the line of the proposed conciliation
scheme. If the New Zealand labor law
Is not class legislation then we don't
know the meaning of the term, but we
presume the Chicago Congress will bo
perspicuous enough to give us some
light on the subject.
Trade With Germany.
"While the meat restrictions of Ger
many have tvcll night ruined our trade
with that country Jn that particular
branch of trade, anxiety as to Us effect
m other commodltlea seema to he
wasted.
It will ho remembered that ? fear was
expressed aomo months ago that certain
trade restrictions proposed In Germany
might Berloualy Interrupt the
soinmurclal relattoiiN between that
:ounlry and the United States and especially
decrease our exports to that
country In agricultural products. Figures
Just Issued by the treasury bureau
of statistics show that our exports to
Ciermnny, In the ten months ending with
October, 1P00, werv $27,000,000 gre ater
than thosu In the corresponding months
of last year, an Increase of about 20 per
:ent and that our Imports from (Jcrinnny
show an Increase of js.000,000, a
fain of over 10 per cent.
Of the forty great articles which compose
the hulk of our exports to Germany
more than two-third* show tin Increase
In 1POO ns compared with 1899. Thosu
ivhlch show the principal dccrvnse nro
liog products, corn, wheat, fcrtlllxors
im! certain linen of machinery. Thoaq

nearly 11.000,000 each and unruanufac,
tured cotton over $28,000,000, while In the
list of articles which show a decrease
there are but two cases In which the
I falling off Is as much as $1,000,000?corn
I showing a reduction of a little more
| than $1,000,000 and wheat a little more
than $2,000,000.
Tho Democrats oncc claimed that the
Republican policy of protecting the tin
I plate Industry was a farce, and as usual
they are confounded by facts and reI
suits. Since 1852 the output of tin plates
has Increased from 18.803 tons to 379,767
I tons in 1893, while within the same perj
iod the Imports of British tin plates
have fallen from 263,472 tons to 53.915
tons.
The surrender of 2,200 rebel Filipinos
1b the beginning of the end, and a fulfillment
of the prophecy incident to McKlnley's
election. Others will follow
rapidly, now that a break has been
made.
Knitters game is up, after Germany's
snub. He will have to"oe satisfied with
the effervescent sympathy of Prance,
Inspired, not by love for Kruger, but
hatred of England. .!
The "Red Light" district of New

The powers are gradually swinging
around to the position maintained by
tho United States with regard to China.
I When Pettlgrew opens his fountains
of gall and bitterness the senate chara(ber
will have to be fumigated.
j You may be euro tho shipping bill Is
a good thing, because the Democrats
oppose It.
I The President's message Is one of the
I ablest executive documents ever written.
I Yesterday's gloom was a good Imitation
of a London fog.
The shipping bill will have the call In
the senate.

a sensation when brouhgt up at the ^

rested at the instance of the girl's
mother, "who hoped to get $2,090 out of ^
him," but she was disappointed in that _
particular. Referring to his confinement
in the Ohio county jail on the
lunacy charge, he said he was always
suspicious of his father when he did a
seemingly good act?as, for instance,
bringing him two suits of domes just
before his departure for Spencer asylum.

things in their letters. He was asked ac'
as to a certain vulgar term used in his in(
letter to his mother, and said it was a
word in everyday use in the family. pr'
