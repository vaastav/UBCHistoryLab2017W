Old Man Killed By Passenger Train.
Springfield, Mo., Dec. 5. Unmind
ful ofthe rapidly approaching train
owing to his hearing and sight being
impaired as a result of his advanced
age, Boyd M. Bowland, 90 years old,
was instantly killed at 1:15 o'clock
yesterday afternoon in North View,
eighteen miles east of Springfield,
when he stepped "in front of Frisco
passenger train No. 4.
News of liis father's death was re
ceived 'in Springfield shortly after the
accident by R. A. Bowland, secretary
of the Springfield Eight-Mile special
road distirct and former county treas
urer, who went to Northview last
night.
A detailed report of the accident al
so was received at the Frisco general
offices yesterday afternoon from Con
ductor J. "M. Mansfield and Engineer
W. H. Carter, who were in charge of
the train.
According to the reports received
here Mr. Bowland was on his way to
his home, where he lived alone. He
had walked along the- station platorm
and had stared across the tracks when
struck. .The pilot of the engine caught
him and carried him for more than
sixty yards before the train was
brought to a stop.
Death- probably was instantaneous;
for when the btfdy wa3 picked up' it
was badly crushed and practically
every bone had been broken.
Condition 13 Improving.
N. V. Allebach, who lias- been con
fined to the Springfield hospital for
over two weeks following an opera
tion for relief of a carbuncle infection
on the-neck, is steadily gaining. The
attending physicians saM today that
if hi3 condition continues to improve
he will soon be well enough to be re
moved to his home. While 'Mr. Alle
bach's condition has been serious and
has caused concern among his friends
in other towns on the Frisco, as well
as here, it now seems probable that
after a slow convalescence he will
again enjoy his usual vigorous health'.

The embargo on cattle has been
lifted and .shipments will be received

infection, which at first was thought
to be the foot and mouth disease
among the stock in the Kansas Ctiy

placing of the embargo. The cliser
