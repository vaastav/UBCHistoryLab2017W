Can this be the home of my youth
Where in childhood I gatnbol'd and play'd ?
Can this be the house where Iliv'd 7
And is that the same room where I lay 7
Oh ! where is that tree, where the birds
Came so often to chirp and to sing!
Can that be the same running brook
Whencfe the water we often did bring 7
How vacant, how scattor'd thoSe woods,
Where the pheasant oft beat with his wing-
Where the whippowill always was heard
When the evenings grew warm in the spring!
The willow and black walnut trees,
With their bushels of nuts all around,
Which the swine did so patiently crack
Till the snow lay quite deep on the ground !
Those pear trees that bore in the fall,
And were sure to be loaded with fruit—
That stood up so straight and so tall,
Are dead lroin the top to the root.
That soft gentle voce of my mother—
The voice that was always so dear
'Twould be sweeter than music of heaven,
If now it could break on my ear.
Oh, that mother! —that dearest of mothers :
Net a mortal on earth can I find
Where the chorls of attachment are equal-
Where the chains of affection so kind.
•
If now I could see my dear mother—
If bnt ever I could meet her again—
llow light would that heart be within me,
Aud my tears would run down like the rain!

And tny brothers and sisters are dead ;
Oh ! le v. lonely how dreary I feel,
While my heart weighs within me like lead,

VIVIA AGAIN.
BY GEORGE MARTIAL.
It lias lxen nearly three months since I
have seen mv littleJriends, Lou and Vivia
Buracole. Silken flounces no mere rustle in
my hall, my study is forgetting bouquet do
Caroline, and the little stool in the corner is
getting quite an old-time look for want of use.
The girls have been spending the summer out
of town, visiting an the Hudson, and the last
three weeks at their own pretty cottage on
the seashore. From that locality I have re
ceived several letters from Yivia, who has en
stalled ine as father-confessor, embodying
material for a first-class romance, with the
help of the usual " sensation" style.
The summer had been rather a hollow af
fair for Yivia, who, for reasons best known to
herself, had on hand a little private stock of
restlessness and discontent. She had flirted,
danced, and laughed ; been always well-dress
ed and gay ; in a Word, played her part in the
sorry degrading farce to perfection, arid paid
for it as do all furgces, with double inward
misery.
When at last their traveling trunks stood
on their own piazza, her sensation was one of
relief.
" I atn so glad," she said, wearily. " Here
I can be at rest and by myself. Y"ou and
Guy can entertain*each other ; father will be
busy with his old friends, and in my own
room, or walking by myself, I can have the
rare luxury of looking as I feel. This whole
summer has been such a disgust and weari
ness to me."
Lou. who had felt something of Yivia's
heart sickness, longed to console ; but, being
wise in her generation, forbore, and only
wrote to Phillip instead—the consequence of
which was a letter to Yivia on the fourth day
of their arrival. She opened it Carelessly
enough, sitting at tiie breakfast-table, linger
ing over her last cup of coffee, read it with a
start, turned very' pale, and handed it to Lou.
It was from Phillip, who stated that he was
only a few hours behind it. lie was coming
to pay them a visit, to learn for himself the
cause of Vivia's late silence, and put an end
to doubt forever.
Lou read it coolly, as she does every thing
i (though, to tell the truth, 6ho could hardly
have been expected to have been so very
much surprised, as she had suggested some
such course of action in her letter,) folded it
up and handed it back.
" Well,® 7 she said, " I see rro' need of turn
ing pale. We have all our Che6ts here, and
the spare room is in order. We are quite
prepared for the attack."
" 0 Lou! how can you ?"
" llow* can I what ?"
The two girls were alone. (It had been' a
habit of theirs, since the death of their moth
er, to breakfast together in their own room.)
Vivia got up, and coming round by Lou, sat
down at her feet, and laid her head in her
sister's lap.
" O Lou !" she said, pitifully, "you know
very well what is the matter. He is coming
to know why I have been silent, and I—"
" Well—^
"I must tell him, of course. There is no
other possible way. If I could deceive him j
even in the smallest detail, I muat sink lower I

even in my own esteem thslri 1 have done yet
Think of it, Lou. I must, accuse myself; hurl
myself down from thfe pedestal on which he
has placed me in his belief; etpose my own
miserable folly; confess my own uiter worth
lessncss ! Oh ! I could easier die than do it,
and yet I would die a hundred times over
rather than not do it."
Lou flung both arms around her sister's
neck.
" That is my cwn brave sister. I knew
that you were true and noble at hoait, and I
told Guy so. O Vivia, you don't know how
glad you have made me."
" But that is not all," pursued Yivia, grow
ing suddenly very red. " I—you don't know
—oh ! how shall I tell you ? I love him bet
ter than I ever did before. I have been com
paring him with all the shallow talkers and
thinkers we have met this summer, and read
ing alternately his grave, loving letters, ati 3
Allan's passionate protestations and demands.
Why, Lou, he seems almost godiike beside
such natures ; the man whose honor is stls.
tair.cd, whose word is strong as truth itself,
who fears only God, a-'d would face a battery
sooner than swerve from a principle ! Think
of his loving a shallow, worthless thing like
me, so dull that I didn't even understand
the worth of the nature that bowed before
me 1"
" I think you undervalue yourself a little,"
said Lou ; " but, however the case may be,
you are quite right; you cannot evade the
duty which lies straight before you."
At this juncture Vivia wrote off one or two
very pathetic letters to me, byway of divert
ing her mind from the terrible hour that was
fast approaching.
Philip came at last, kind and genial as ev
er ; and the family, who knew nothing of
Yivia's troubles, welcomed him very much
as usual, and took an early opportunity ol
slipping out one by one, ou some convenient
pretext, and leatihg the two lovers (?) to
gether.
Lou went last, and, with her, all Yivia's
courage. The crisis was at hand. Philip
came and sat down by her on the sofa.
" Now, Yivia,"' lie said, grately, " what
have you to tell me ?"
Vivia edged quite away in the other corner
of the sofa, put her head down in the sola
cushion, so that he could see nothing but the
ro'.ls of dark hair, and the tip of cue littie
ear, and began.
She told the story mercilessly ; she spared
herself not in the smallest detail ; she exoner
ated Allan (who was utterly ignorant of her
engagement) and called herself some of the
hardest names in the calendar.
" And now," she finished, " if reparation is
possible, I will make all that I cm. My con
duct has freed you, of course. Let it be un
derstood by the world that you bruke our
engagement, and why."
A rising sob warned her to bring her sen
tence to a close as speedily as possible ; but
no answer was returned. She waited a mo
ment ; the dead couldn't have been more ut
terly still than the uiSn at her side. She be
gan to fear, she hardly knew what. She
raised her head hastily. He was ghastly
pale, his features working, and a strange
look in his eyes that she had never se. n |>e
fore.
"Philip! Philip!" she cried, in terror.
" don't-look so. I never thought that you
would care. Oh ! this is worst of all. I fan
cied that yoti would be angry—that you
would hate and despise me; but this—this is
dreadful. Philip, for pity's sake, speak."
If she had dared, she would have laid her
head on his shoulder, pressed her lips to his;
as it was, she took his hand and kissed .it.
lie did not push her away as she expected ;
only said, sadly r
" You needn't blame yourself, child. The
fault is mine. lat least might have known
that you were young, and had not fairly test
ed your love; but I thought only of my own
passion, and was chiefly anxious to bind you
by a promise, and have you for tny own. I
am justly rewarded."
"Oh ! but this is intolerable!" burst out
Yivia. "Keenest reproaches couldn't behalf
so bitter as to hear you blame yourself unde
servedly. I tell you, Philip, I did love !"
"You thonght so."
" I did—l shall always. I know it now;
only I have such a contemptible nature that
it c nldn't be true on the surface, though it
was at heart."
Philip turned toward her with a sadden flush
of hope.
" Take cire, Yivia. Do you knotV what
yen are saying V
"What do you mean ?"
" You said, just now, "I did and 6hatt al
ways love you."
Vivia crimsoned to her temples.
" Did you mean that ?"
She bent her head low. lie drew her to
ward him, and gently forced her to look up
" Answer, Vivia ; did you mean that?"
(i Yes," whispered Vivia.
That trembling monosyllable bridged over
all the gulf of difference between them, for
said Phlip.
" The best surety that I could ask that
you Will be true to me, is that you have dared
be true to yourself; and this painful experi
ence has but proved the strength of our mu
tual love."
" But Allan !" murmured Vivia.
Philip looked grave.
"Ah ! there is where the sting of evil will
make itself felt. I cannot help you there >
you must, tread the path alone. I have for
given you, for I have your love. What he
will do, I cannot tell."
The thought came agsin and again, to
check and mar Yivia's happiness. Wrong i&
double-edged : it. hurts the doer as well as the
sufferer. Allan was coining home on lurlough;
his first visit would be to Yivia, and she
must go through the trial alone.
Lou, Guy, and Philip pitied indeed, but
they could not help. It was at this juncture
that I received the second pa'hetic out pour
ing. Some one had advised Yivia to write
the truth to Allan, but she refused indignant
ly.
"I think that, Mr. Martial (she wrote to
me,) is the very most cowardly and unfenii
nine thing that a woman can do. ITe ha>>
a right to hear it from my lips, and I will
not spare myself the pain."
Allan came ; Vivia met him at the door,
1 motioned back his caresses, put away his
| , i offered hand.
"I am not Worthy of it," she said; "wait
and hear rue."
And for the second time she went over the
miserable story.
Allan interrupted her by a fierce exclama
tion, ground out between his teeth :
"If you were not a woman—oh ! that it
were only a man that had dmie me such a
wrong, that I might kill him !"
" Kill me, if you like," answer Yivia, who
was wrought up to that pitch that she realiy
felt that she deserved, and would rather have
preferred such a fate.
Allan turned on her with a cold, sarcastic
smile.
"Kill you ! You aro not worth it. I wil
despise you and all your sex ; that is the
only feeling that a woman deserves. Tsey
are pretty play things, and can protest and
promise fairly ; but honor and truth they
know nothing about ; and the man who ex
pects it from them deserves what I have
received at your hands. Good morning, Miss
Baracole."
Bitter are the fruits of etil. Vivia is happy
tn having been loved by one man among a
thousand ; a man who not only could but
dared forgive. Yet Allan's words ring ?n her
ears; the thought of him, with fath and
love destroyed, haunts her. It was ea-y
enough to do the wrong; who shall und > it ?
Utter carelessness and weakness wrought the
harm ; a whole life-time of repentance may
never efface it.
AFRAID OF THEIR RECORD.
The action of the majority in Congress, in
tabling the resolutions off-red by Mr Cox and
others, offered the lirst da}' of th session,
whicn we noticed last week, asking an inves
t'gation of the arbitrary arrests made by the
present administration, shows that these cow
ardly Abolitionists are afraid to allow the
facts in these cases to be made public. They,
therefore, smother inquiry, and permit the
President and his Cabinet to monopolize all
the information as to the question. But the
time is comicg when the damning rec rd will
be spreaJ before the world, and when the au
thors of these outrages will become a hbsing
and a scorn throughout Christendom, if not
among even barbarians of the earth. It is
not wonderful that the Abolitionist desire to
keep the record of their acts from the light of
day as long as the" have the pow r to de so;
their cowardly nature prompts this course, for
with ell their f"lly, they are wise enough to
know that a full di-closure of thejfacts might
endanger their personal safety among their
outraged and indignant fellow citizens.— E.v
S32T"The Post thinks in the matter of arbi
trary arrests the government has mad a
mistake only " in the needlees secresy and
'• mystery with which it has made arrests and
"ordered imprisonment."
But for the epidemic insanity of the time,
under which the Post suffers severely, this
simple statement would be its own refutation.
It beg.i the question, or avoids it, of the right
lor wrong of these imprisonments, and con
demns only an incident and accident of them
--their privacy. Outraged law, the violate 1
rights of citizens, the disregard of personal
liberties—all these are nothin? to the Post.
But that they were done in private—that is
the error.
Has the Post to learn that despotism al
ways vails itself? Light and publicity are
the guarantees of liberty and law. Secresy
and mystery the very indices of arbitrary
power World.

VOICE FROM THE \HOLITIOX CAMP.
The HusUm Commonwealth, Hon. Charles
Sumner's organ, says:
Ii is said that once there was a man who
thought that if he should run i v.o niili3 le
could jump over a mountain. When, after
bis run, lie reached the base of the mountain
he sat down to rest. We are reminded ol
11; is individual by the President's fiie-sage.
Taking a hundred days start he nears the
base of his mountain ; but it seems is very
tired and sits down to rest. lie nods. Xev
er did wide-awakes uher in a more heavy
eyed President, Ilere, evidently fallen
asleep, he takes to dreaming of the year 1900
Is it that despairing of the present he is turn
ing his attention to future salvation 1 It will
doubt less occur to many that we have abut
as much as we can attend to to deal with De
cember 1802, without undertaking the bur
thens of the second generation from this.
Possibly that generation may have brains of
its own in deal with its own affairs.
The President says that slavery is the
C uisfe of the war ; the cau-e of it? continuance;
that we can have no peace so long as it ex
ist£. Then his proposition can only amount
to d, pfop. sltion to continue the war until the
year 1900 !
To get any gleam of hope from this mes
sage is like trying to extract sunbeams from
cucumbers; so much is said to the point of
that ivhith is nothing to the point ; bur the
least objectionable thing in it is that he indi
cates an intention to adhere t > his proclama
tion. The question, however, arises, it the
President means to carry out liis edict of
freedom on the New Year, what is all this
sti.fi about gradual emancipation ?
The guns of our army and navy cover to
day one million slavr*. Will the President
on that day strike the fetters from that inill
ii" win the reach of his arm! Let htm at
tend to that, and, for God's sake, let the
Twentieth century al ne ! lie la our Presi
ident, not that of posterity.
The en articles, f-.r the Constitution
are ludicrious, and (.ne can hardly I eln-vt
that Orpheus C. Kerr did not httve his pock
et telegfaflh erf the lines, arid so manage to
insert several paragraphs. One of these ar
ticles gravely - imports :hat after we have got
a State free from slavery and the slaves pair]
for, if that State wants to re establish slave
:y, it may quietly do so, only it must pay u?
bstck our money !
One sen ence in the mc>age strikes in as
disingenuous. It says, " Some would abolish
is >uddenly ami wit lout compensation.'' A?
if the idea of c >rnp-tisation had anything to
do with the gridualness of emancipation !
The President must be Impele-idy ignorant if
he does not know ihat all but a v iv fi-w
emancipationists in this country are in favor
of striking at slavery directly and immediate-
ly ; that they be! it Ye that slavery can be
reaclie 1 only by the wir power, v i cli from
its very nature acts upon ah -exigency ; and
that many euianc.pationistsj fav jT fcuuipensa
ti. n.
The fict is the President seems to be innn
of inadt quote calibre; lie does not cotnpre
bend his position ; he has exhausted himself
apparently in taking up the gauntlet which
the South threw d wn. Either tlws theory
is true, or ehe that Mcphistoplus, Seward,
is paralyzing h.s powers.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE NlGGEßS.—Pres
ident Linci'ln, in presenting bis views to the
Senate and ll<>nse of Representatives, on the
subject of negro emancipation in the South,
savs;—' It is insisted Ih it their presence
would injure and displace while labor and
white laborers. If there ever could be a time
for mere arguments, that time, surely, is not
now "
This, then, according to his logic,' is not the
tune to advocate the interests of the wnit_ la
boring men of the North, many of whotn are
in the army fighting the battles of then 1 conn
try. The negroes must be permitted to flood
the Northern States, and drive out the white
laborers, because the President has as-ure I
us I hat "if they leuve their old places they
leave them open td white laborers." That i>,
if the negroes come North to Jill our wotk
shops, tnine®, &c., <tc., the poor laboring men
in the free Sta'es must be sent to fill the
place vacated by the negroes in the cotton,
rice and sugar fields of the S null. The
workmgmen of Pennsylvania will not fail to
appieciate the logic of an Abolition President
who is endeavoring fo rriduce them to the de
graded level of the negro. That portion of
the President's Message is an insult to the
white freemen of the North. The Abolition
ists may endeavor to disguise the fact as they,
will, the whole aim of their party hffs been
to elevate the negto at the expense of the
white man.— Ex.
