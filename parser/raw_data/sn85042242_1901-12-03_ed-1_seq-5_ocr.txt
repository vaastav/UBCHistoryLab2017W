SKETCH THAT SHOULD FIND
PAyOR IN THE BE5ST ,y
FAMILIES.
In the Minneaipolis Journal of Sat­
urday last, Mr. A. J. Russell, who fur­
nishes the nonpareil similes for that
esteemed contemporary, took five min­
utes oft to make a little journey to the
home oif the author of the prose and
verse Sketches that have appeared in
this column. Those who desire inside
misinformation as to the career of Mr.
Foley, hand-turned, ao^rdeon-plalted,
and» with a circular flouncing, would
do well to borrow the neighbor's
paiper of that date. With nothing to
build upon but a name, a warwhoop
and a few eagle feathers, Mr. Russell
has concocted a beautiful little bio­
graphical sketch which needs only a
strawberry mark to make it complete.
It is the finest bit of "^word painting
that has appeared since the -new sign
was put up in front of the Sixth street
butcher shop. Aside from the dram­
atic flavor and literary excellence of
this article, the paper of that date will
be found valuable for the scrap book,
the waste paper basket and the pantry
shelf. Now is the time to subscribe.
Mr. Russell has blended verse and
prose in the article into a delicious
quality of literary succotash, and the
dish is served piping hot, with an orig­
inal verse at the top and bottom, hand-
done by"Mr" Rus^H ^edlnTf^toe L®e
occasion. Memories of the old times,
when at the tender age of nine years
the author of this defense galloped
over the wild, western hills with Pres­
ident Roosevelt and Marquis de Mores,
with never less than, jone scalp, are
brought back so vividly by this sketch
of Mr. Russell's as almost to seem
true. How clearly, too, come the re­
collections of birth and infancy on the
banks of the Little Missouri river, sev­
eral years before the foot of white man
or woman had ttodden the soil or
sought the chiropodist Born there,
all alone, without either father or
mother present! How romantic and
how grand!
The insatiate advertisers are crowd­
ing upon the domain of literary genius
and Lydia Pinkham is calling us to
break away. But before we go, some
quick snappy verses dedicated to Mr.
Russell:
Born into strife
In early life,
And quickly taught to hustle,
Because, you see,
In infancy,
His parents made him Russell.
Then at the font,
Where in and on't
•Baptismal waters glisten,
His father said,
With bending head:
"I bring A. J. to christen."
The years on swing!
A. rubber ring,
A. J. was lying, biting.
Unchanged his mood
And attitude,
But now he's lying, writing.
—FOLEY.
TAX SALE.
Auditor Moorhousa conducted the
annual sale of real property for delin­
quent taxes today. There were 210
descriptions of property sold, and the
average of the sales was about $10. The
county did not bid in any of the prop­
erty, lively individual biddesfe taking
all that was offered. A. T. Patterson,
W. H. Bohannan, P. E. Byrne, and
Gen. A. Hughes were among the pur­
chasers, some of the interests repre­
sented being the Buffalo Center, la.,
State Bank, President Merrill of the
Minnesota Loan and Trust Company,
and Mr. Foster. About 100 descrip­
tions of property were redeemed before
the tax sale. It was one of the live­
liest in the history of the county, al­
though the amount of property offered
was not great .:

sidier the matter carefully. He asked
for a postponement of action on the
resolution until the next meeting of
the council.
^lderman Smyth said 'there was no
desire to force action on the part of
the council but to get an expression of
sentiment. o^i the part of the council
as to the manner in which the water
company dealt with the city. It was
one way to bring the matter up.
Alderman Slattery wanted immedi­
ate action on the part of the council.
He said it was a case of the people be
d——. He called attention to the ac­
tion of the company with reference to
matters in his ward to sustain his po­
sition.
The question of the right of the com­
pany to shut off water from the city
hydrants, in case the resolution was
adopted, was raised.
Aldermen Jackson and Smyth said
that as far as they had looked the mat­
ter up, the water company could not
prevent the city's using water from
the hydrants. Alderman Smyth said
the council would not refuse to take
water, but would refuse to take and
pay for it under the present pretended
contract.
Alderman Reade renewed his motion
to postpone until the next meeting,
Wa^ted"any
neglect on the
of
the water company, such as there had
been in the recent instance where the
fire department officials had not been
notified of the shutting off of water,
remedied, but he still though it would
be well to consider the whole matter
carefully before taking action. Al­
derman Smyth said he would agree to
postponement if the resolution were
referred to the city attorney for his
opinion, and no bills of the water
company be allowed until the matter
was settled. This was agreed upon
and the matter went over.
Alexander Hughes of the local elec­
tric light company then made the
council a proposition to furnish street
lights. He said that he would fur­
nish four arc lights for the streets for
the next five months at the rate of $10
a month each, lie also agreed to fur­
nish 32-cahdle power incandescent
lights for some of the street corners at
a yearly rate.of $3 a month. He said
the rate asked was that usually asked
for the whole year, and he offered it
for the time when the liiglits are used
longest and are the heaviest tax upon
the plant
The whole matter of street lighting
came up for discussion, particularly
with reference to the locating of the
lights. An effort will be made to have
the city's appropriation of $200 a year
supplemented with private aid from
business men, so that arrangements
can be made for lighting Main street
and also lighting the corners nearest
the several churches. The matter of
obtaining this assistance and locating
the lights was referred to a special
committee consisting of Aldermen
Smyth, Jackson and Reade.
Chris Johnson of the Salvation Army
was appointed a special policeman of
the city without pay, for the particu­
lar purpose of maintaining order at
the Salvation Army barracks, and the
appointment was confirmed by the
council.
Mayor Register stated that he had
taken it upon himself to have repairs
made in the walks leading to the school
house, and the matter was referred to
the committee on streets, with the sug­
gestion that rep a ire be made on Fourth.
Fifth and Sixth streets, as a temporary
expedient until spring.
The matter of manure piles about
the water hydrants in the city was
brought up by Alderman Smyth and
the water works committee was given
aiithority to act in the matter, the
members of the council expressing
themselves as opposed to this praotice
as unsightly and unhealthful.

Figs, manufactured by tlie
California Fig Sybup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa­
tive principles ot plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa­
tive, cleansing1 the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per­
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub­
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities
of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Sybup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
