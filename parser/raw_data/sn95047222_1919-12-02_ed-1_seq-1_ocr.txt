There is danger in rapidly rising

and the speculator is the one who
generally gets the profit.
Tests conducted by the U. S. De
partment of Agriculture prove ' that
millions of dollars are lost annually
to Southern farmers through improp

lets a bale of cotton stay .on the

that to run wet cotton through the
