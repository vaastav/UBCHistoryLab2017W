Finding that our store, No. 302 Market
street, (although the largest and finest
boot and shoe establishment in this
part of the country,) is not large
enough to hold all the goods we would
wish to place before the people of Wil
mington and vicinity, we have conclud
ed to open a branch store at No. 413
Market etreet, (half way between 4th
and 6th streets,) where we will place
the greatest bargains to be found any
where. We are confident by this time
that the people are aware that we can
sell cheaper than any other house in
Wilmington by manufactnrln
goods and belling them at and under
wholesale prices. By giving us a call
aud comparing our prices with others
you will lie convinced that what we say
is true. Remember the place, No. 413

1 HEY KNOW BA YARD.
A Few Imhm why Bayard'* Bourn
will net Boom.
From the St. Paul's (MUn.) Ploreer Press.
Mr. Bayard is said to he discouraged
by the perverse behavior of his boom.
He came hack from Europe just in the
nick of time. The destroyer bad been
at work among hie rivals, east and
west. Thurman had just been slain in
Ohio and Tildeu in New York. The
Democracy, stunned and blinded by ac
cumulated catastrophes was groping
about among the wounded of lost bat
tle-flelds for somebody with life enough
in him to lead it to new defeats.
The party was even reduced to euoli
desperate straits that it explored the
graves left by many former disasters
and proposed to dig the hones of Hora
tio Seymour from the quiet nook where
they have rested since 1868, to wire
and galvanize them into the ghastly
semblance of a leader in the contest of
1880. Just at this juncture, cams Bay
ard. He had shrewdly kept out of bat
tle and escaped disaster ; had shelter
ed himself in Europe and kept himself
as much alive as his usual habit is.
What more natural lhau that the De
mocracy should hail him as the eagerly
sought leader. But it didn't. It Is
true some sort of a reception was pre
pared for him in New York ; hut aB
he earns sailing into the harbor, hie
delicate nostrils detected an odor of
Tammany about it, and he declined to
commit his boom to the doubtful care
of John Kelly. It was Hobson's
choice, ami- as he wouldn't have a
Tammany reception he got none. As
the next host thing, he went home to
Delaware aud got himself ihterviewed
in correct and etately platitudeB of ex
cellent English and admirable senti
ment, which were telegraphed over the
country without regard to expense.
All the same, hie boom Wouldn't boom.
This is the more disappointing, as
Mr. Bayaril permits himself to be dis
turbed by no shadow of a doubt that he
is the purest and ablest statesman in
the Democratic party. And, with a
certain qualification, to be noted later,
be is correct in his conviction. All
tillage considered, Mr. Btyardls proba
bly the best of the Democratic states
men. Why, then, doen't his acknowl
edged virtue help his adolescent boom ?
It is no satisfactory answer to say that
he is too good for his party. If he were
so excessively virtuous as to repel the
evil element of his .party, the good
element would cling to him and, what
is more important to hie success, he
would attract the fastidious floating
vote that is what makes presidents
these days. But Mr. Bayard does not
attract the virtuous aud repel the evil
elements in his party, but the reverse.
He is welcomed by Tammany, while
the virtuous Democrats aud fastidious
independent voters are indifferent to
him.
The reason for this aud the failure of
Mr. Bayard to inspire enthusiasm as a
Presidential candidate, reste in the pe
culiar quality of his virtue ; the char
acteristic texture of his personality.—
His gooduess is of the goody-good kind;
of a pulpy, negative, inoffensive tex
ture, that does not iiifiueuce others or
communicate itself to his following.
Mr. Bayard is not a weak man, bat he
is a weak leader; or rather he is no
leader at all. He has strong personal
convictions, and he can resist invasion
of bis personal rights ; but he cannot
impress his conviction upon others, or
lay down a line of policy and bring his
party associates to fallow it. Ue can
reiuse to follow his party and sulk
alone by himself in a corner ; bat he
cannot lead. Daring all his history he
has been doing one or two things, fol
lowing obediently in the line of policy
marked out by lees conscientious but
more vigorous partisans, or standing
aside silent, powerless and alone, while
his party moved on without him. No
man had ever better command of Iris
own convictions or less influence with
his martyrs than Mr. Bayard.
Whenever he has acted with hie par
ty, he has surrendered his personality
and lias been a partisan of the parti
sans. Whenever he has separated
from Iris party in obedience to his per
sonal convictions, he baa carried no
body with him. He separated from
his party on the financial issue, it ie
true, but the party of honest money
gained only his eingle vote. He has
acted with hie party a hundred times,
without moderating the intemperative
ness of its partisanship a particle. He
has served on par'isan investigating
committees, and the influence of his
less able but more emphatic associates
has tinctured his reports with the
blindest injustice. He has acted iu
Democratic caucus, when the impet
uous z-al uf his associates has swept
him from his conservative footing and
curried him into most radical excesses.
lu the extra session last spring, he
surrendered to the madmen who forced
the conflict with the executive ae weak
)y as he resisted the fiat money men
boldly the winter before. Mr. llayard
always surrenders to the extremists on
political questions.
This is the reason why the bad men,
the unscrupulous partisans of theDem
oorany, do not fear that the political
virtne of Mr. Bayard would haDg like a
millstone about the neck of their
schemes of partisanship and plunder.
They understand that it is a parade
ground virtue, a campaign catchword,
that would never he permitted to inter
fere with party Bucoees. They under
stand that Mr. Bayard as President
would be like Mr. Bayard as Senator,
pi-raoually pure and Incorruptible by
money ; but the servant of his party
aud the tool of more impetuous leaders;
strong enough at most only to keep
himself from entering upon a rash and
dangerous course—never to restrain
his party as well. This is why Tam
many is willing to boom for Bayard.
And this is why the independent voter
doea not inoline to Bayard and his
boom languishes. The independent
voter sees that to elect Bayard would
be eimply to vote the Democratic party
into power, with all that the word im
plies ; and he considers that the gilded
image of a saint for a figure-head is
email consolation for a ship fallen into
the hands of a piratical crew. Mr.
Bayard was in error not to accept Tam
many's reception. If he is nominated
for the Presidency, it will be for parti
■an considerations, not for hti virtues.

Ou motion of Mr. Thurman, of Ohio,
the Secretary was directed to inform

Immediately after the committee had

President appeared and announced that
Ue had been directed to deliver to the
Senate a Message from the President.
The Message was thereupon received
and submitted by the Vice-President.
The Clerk then began to read the Mes

SKNATOR C1IANDLBlt'S IIKATH.
Mr. Ferry, of Michigan, then rose and
said that the sorrowful official duty de
volved upon him of announcing to the
Senate the death of his late colleague,
Xachariah Chandler. It was nut his
preseut purpose to speak of the char
acter and serviqps of one so long aud so
notably a member of this body, but at
some suitable time he would invite the
Senate to express, by resolution and by
eulogy, its senes of the irreparable loss
the nation had sustained iu the death
of so distinguished a citizen. As a
mark of respect to a Senator present at
the last adjournment and absent now
forevermore, he moved that the Senate
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to and at 3.15
p. in., the Senate adjourned until 12

The Export Trade.
The New York "Snu" says it is a
fact well worth noting, that the exports
of domestio merchandise from the Uni
ted Slates were larger, in value, during
the last fiscal year than during any
previous one in the history of this
country.
It is a Becoud fact worth noting that
the exports of all eorts were iu value
$711,637,393, and the total imports
$445,777,755,—so that the former were
to the latter 6J to 4, and surpassed
them by $266,859,638. The exports
reckoned in a mixed gold and cur
rency value ; the imports only in gold.
Allowing for this wo have a balance ol
about $250,000,000 on the export side.

THE MTOI.r.X MEMBAUEN.
A Bare Literary Then - 90 , 00 *
Word* Telegraphed aid tel IB
la Fear Honrs.
A Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia ''lleeord'' ban the follow
ing about the theft of Secretary Shei
man'e report and the Preeident'a Mee
eage:
It appears now to be pretty well un
derstood among newspaper correspon
dents here that the party tnaiuly in
strumental is securing the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury and the
President's Message from the (lorern
ment Printing Office was T. 0. Crawford,
correspondent of the Chicago ' Times.'
The story is that he bargained with an
employe of the printing office for proofs
>1 me documents, and then made an
arrangement with several papers to re
ceive them and divide the expense.
With regard to the Secretary's report
t should be stated that il was bought
by the correspondent of the New York
"Tribane," Cincinnati "Enquirer" and
" I'liuee,''but was, nevertheless, tele
graphed from the New York "Tribune"
office to the Cincinnati "Gazette," Chi
cago "Tribune" and Bustou "Adver
tiser."
The same thief who stole a copy of
the Secretary of the Treasury's report
also secured a copy of the President's
Message, and the latter documeDt was
sold on Saturday evening to the corres
pondent of the New York "Times,"
Cincinnati "Enquirer" and Chicago
"Times" for $500 each. Every precau
tion was taken not to let the fact be
come known that tire document was
being telegraphed from here, and in
order to doubly insure the purchasers
against the possibility of a leak a strict
watch was maintained ou the operating
room of the telegraph office and the
movement of the employes.
Seme of the papers in the bargain
were disposed to weaken ou Saturday,
but Mr. Crawford wae instructed by
the "Times" to go ahead, if that paper
had to asBUine all the expense itself.
Crawford is said to have paid $1,500 for
the Message. It was telegraphed so as
to close about four o'clock in the morn
ing, when the Chicago "Tribune" gftt
wind of it, and immediately telegraphed
to New York where a copy of the New
York "Times," with the Message in it,
wae obtained.
The work of telegraphing it from New
York to the "Tribune" commenced at 4
o'clock in the morning. Ten wires were
used, and the "Tribune" was enabled
to appear with the Message in a late
edition about half past Beven o'clock on
Monday morning. The entire work of
making arrangements, telegraphing and
s ttiug up over 20,000 words was ac
complished in less than four hours.
This will unquestionably be the last
time that such an event will occur dur
ing the present administration, as the
president has determined that hie next
Message shall not be printed until after
It shall Lave been transmitted to Con
gress. President Grant adopted this
plan, and never permitted his messa
ges to be printed before the assembling
of Congress, lie did this to avoid such
premature publications of Executive
Messages as was the case during Presi
dent Johnson's term.

James Murphy was the last witness
called on the part of the plaintiff in the
Delaware Western R. It. case vs. Jno.
A. Harris, and hie testimony corrobora
ted that of the previous witness already
reported as regards the lines of the
Leonard property.
At the close of bis testimony—at 12-40
o'clock, Mr. Cummins for defendants
asked the court for a non-suit, claiming
that plaintiffs had not made good their
title to the property in dispute.
Mr. Bates for plaintiffs replied at
length, going over the evidence at
lused and the court orerruled Mr.
Cummings' motion.
The court then at 1.30 adjourned un

Mr. CummiDge for the defence reading
a number of deeds showing who owned
the property in dispute.
Chas. Moore was the first witness
called. In hie testimony Mr. Moore
went hack to 1812. He was then quite
young but recited several instances
which impressed the different land
marks in the neighborhood of Water
and Shipley upon his memory. Ue
was cross-examined at great length by
Mr. Sprnance. The poiut of Mr. Moore's
testimoney was that the dock claimed
by plaintiffs as West dock was
not West dock: but that West
dock was a sort of natural dock
formerly, and the present dook aB de
cided in former evidence was not West
Dock. A great deal of croes firing be

A meeting of the Board of Health
was held last evening, Piesident Mona
ghan presiding.
Orders were directed to be drawn in
favor of D. H. Thomas for $21.16 and
Wm. Bowers, $23.81.
Mr. McConnell asked for information
as to what had been done towards
abating the nuisance at Bombard and
Lord streets. He thought action should
be taken in the matter.
Col. Singley who has had the matter
in hand said that the nuisance would
be abated this week, that he intended
to have the parties before the Mayor.
Mr. Kenney aeked who the aggress
ers were. He further stated that he
understood Colonel Singley had taken
sides with Mr. Stine one of the parties
accused of maintaining the nuisance.
Mr. Singley threw back the charge of
favoritism and stated that the lady had
dumped two cart loads of dirt in a
gutter to which two others living above
had right of way, thus baoking the
waste water upon their properties.
In order to investigate on motion of
Mr. Kenney the Board adjourned to
meet upon the spot on Saturday after
noon at 4j o'clock.
A Theft uf Time.
John Ward, Edward Lawler aud Sam
uel Lawler were arraigned before His
Honor for the theft of the clock, the loss
of which has been before mentioned.—
Mr. Hirst, who keeps a jewelry store
on Market street above Seventh, recog
nized the parties as being the three who
were in his store on Wednesday night
last; and recognized the clock. The
timepiece was a small one, of an alarm
pattern, worth about $1.75. Witness
stated Lawler came into the store for
the purpose of purchasing a watch on
which he paid $2. The other two were
his companions. It was after they had
rone out he had misled the clock.—
Edward Hicken another witness testi
fied to meeting the prisoners and saw
the clock in the posBsesBioa of Mousley
and saw him transfer the clock to
Ward. When arrested the clock was
found in their possession. The par
ties were each held in $200 for ap
pearance at Court.
The Delaware Cllf Robbery.

Delawa ■?, Crrv, Dec. 1, '79.
A first class robbery took place here
last night, or before daylight this morn
ing. The store of the widow Cook,
near the Fridge, was entered by bnr
glars, and a clean sweep of everything
in the store was made. Groceries, trim
mings, &c., were all taken. No clue to
the burglars. The impression prevails
that they were taken away on a vessel.
Two sons and a daughter were in the
house all night, aud people think they
were chloroformed. Last winter a number
of burglaries occurred here. Would it
not lie well for the citizens to form a
a nightly patrol ?

that hereafter the meeting would be
