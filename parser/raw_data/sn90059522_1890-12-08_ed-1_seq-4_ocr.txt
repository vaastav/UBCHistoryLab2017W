HARMONY IN NEW YORK.
There has been tremulous- solicitude
!n Republican circles over the seeming
division of the Democrats in the state
of .New York. They have drawn san
guinary pictures of the collision of :
those who would have .Cleveland or:
Him. for the presidential candidate in
3.892. It has seemed to them that there
jiiust be such discord between these
Clements that the state would be thrown
lo the Republicans. They have been
Quite sure that Gov. Hill would throw
away a brilliant chance by going to the
United States senate and hushing any
buzzing of the little bee for the
time. Vet the most recent ad
vices from that quarter are that
• >ov. Hill will either be a can
didate for the senate himself or
Dame the man, and not enter the
broader arena for the present,- at least,
In view of the districting in that slate,
it was a remarkable achievement to se
cure a majority, on joint ballot in the'
legislature. The credit for this is due
In a large measure to Gov. Hill, lie
•believed that it could be done, and gave
that feature of the canvass his particu
lar attention. His abilities are well
fitted to the senate, and the indications
now are that he will go there and not
he in the way of a united delegation
from that state for Mr. Cleveland, if
lie shall be among the presidential can
didates in the next election. This will
involve some disregard of the judgment
and sensibilities of many Republicans,
but is asserted by apparently reliable
authority.
-•-
PROBABLE APPORTIONMENT.
' if it is true that the Republicans of
the census committee in the bouse have
Agreed upon a basis of representation
jfor au apportionment bill, it is probable
that the measure may not prove ob
jectionable on partisan grounds, .The
population ratio is named as 173,801,
and the total membership of the house
856. an increase of 24 from the present
Dumber. This obviates the loss of a
member to any state, and is claimed to
be about the lowest figure that will en
able all to retain their representation.
This state will have seven members
and one of the largest unrepresented
fractions, but no probable ratio will
give it more than the seven. The
advantage in a partisan way that'
the Republicans imagine they will
gain in this allotment is in the
fact that out of the twenty-four
additional members sixteen will come
from states they have been in the habit
of claiming, while the others, which
Voted for Mr. Cleveland, have but
eight. But no Democrat is likely to
Concede that such states as Illinois.Wis
consin. Michigan and Massachusetts
Should be counted as reliable for the
Republicans, not to speak of Kansas.
Nebaska and Minnesota. These states
have eleven of the sixteen the Republi
cans are to gain. it will be a hard year
for the Democrats in 1892 if*ihey do not
tarry some of these states. The two to
be given to Illinois will both come from
Chicago, which is Democratic, and has
lust elected three out of the four
Democratic congressmen. it would
take a wonderful gerrymander iii Mtii
lies to keep the Democrats from
electing a fair share of the congressional
delegation. The Democrats at Wash
ington should not consent to an appor
tionment that has any Republican twist
to it. but no very decisive reasons are
apparent for endeavoring to prevent the
passage of a reasonable apportionment
Pleasure at this session. It is true that
its defeat or delay would give the Demo
crats a chance at it in the next congress,
but they would be checked by a Repub
lican senate and president. A revision
of the census is not likely to be conceded
by the Republicans, and -in any
future showing tint certain Demo
pratic states have been . shnru of their
Rightful numbers for partisan ends, the
' additional representation could be ef
fected. The considerations in favor of
opposing a fair bill are not likely to
commend themselves very strongly to a
considerate judgment, lira partisan
way, the fact that so unusual a propor
tion of tho state legislatures are opposed
to the Republicans seams a strong re a- ,
son for such timely action as will ena
ble them to shape the districts. It is
not believed that there should ba any
of the shoestring or serpentine work
that partisans have at times effected for
unfair advantage. Geography and
mathematics siiould have most to do
with this districting business. The
suggestion that the election re
turns should be kept entirely out
of sight is most commendable, but
not quite human, politically speaking.
vi least, the Republicans have not af
forded numerous illustrations" of that
decree of disinterestedness. If there is
no apportionment bill passed at this
session, it is almost certain that there
will be none before the next congres;
sional election. In this state this will
continue the present injustice that
gives thu voter in one district about
double the political power of the voter
in another. The election of two ad
ditional members on the general ticket
would not relieve this iniquity. It is
extremely probable that an apportion
ment hill will be passed this session,
even it opposed by the Democrats: but
it does not appear that there is basis for
the assumption that party Hues will be
drawn.

THE MUTUAIj BLESSING.
li Secretary Noble is to be taken
logically and consequentially, he can not
lie far from the platform of the Alliance
element that would have the govern
ment diffuse prosperity by supplying all
the individuals with a good bank ac
count on small provocation, His recipe
for universal abundance would seem to
be to put everybody on a beneficiary
roll, to be fattened by the government.
In his report lie exultingly asserts that
the mission of the pension bureau has
"reached wonderful proportions," hav
ing ".sent into the channels of trade and
commerce more than $100,030,000 the
past year." In tins way it has "trans
ferred at most opportune moments the
accumulated treasures of the govern-*
m eh t to ; the hands of the people,
blessing him that gives and him that
takes." The happy fact that the diffu
sion of vast sums by the government is
a blessing to "the giver as well as the re
cipient suggests that such blessings
should be expanded indefinitely. All
the people who have not otherwise been
sufficiently blessed in store should be
afforded an opportunity to enlarge the
blessing of the government by accept
ing a share in it. There is happily,
however, promise of the continued
growth of this mutual blessinz for a
considerable period, as the pension list
has vast expansive possibilities. There
are only 537,914 now on the pension
rolls, and there are 8'.)2,2:2l claim* not
acted upon; and the commissioner esti
mates that there are 1,216,089 surviving
veterans. Next year §150,000.000 will
be sent on the way to mutually bless
"him that gives and him that takes."
WOULD BOYCOTT.
Clarksox's lowa paper wants all Re
publicans in that state to boycott the
Chicago Tribune. Speaking of the Re
publican loss in Ohio, it says the Trib
une's "idiotic advocacy of tree trade is
more largely responsible for that loss
than all other things combined." The,
Tribune supported the party ticket, but
opposed the McKixlky bill. The Trib
une and the lesser Republican sheets
that followed it are all deserving credit
for their good work, but Mr. Blaixe
helped the Democrats quite as much by
his pointed declarations that the farmers
were not in the list of beneficiaries of
the McKixi.ev tariff. The Republican
leaders realize this, and would be glad
to denounce him and l.is reciprocity fad
if they could afford to. In place of this,
they will be obliged to stultify them
selves by praising and following him.
— BUS.
MATRIMONIAL BONUS.
Tha last number of the North Amer
ican Review contains a symposium on
the subject of giving dowries to Amer
ican girls who are eligible to matrimony.
This is a foreign idea that has not been
naturalized, and has a mercenary sug
gestion about it that disturbs the senti
ment th it is supposed to be the prime
factor in the roseate preludes to do
mestic felicity. The husbands that are
most desirable to have are not likely to
be allured by the bonus to be obtained
as an inducement to marry. There is
enough of sentiment left to look upon
the fair enchanter as an abundant
dowry in herself. The young man who
looks for a wife to afford him support
is a good sort to avoid. If tho parents
have a"surplus of means, and wish to
free their daughters from the contingen
cies of wadded life, they should always
bo hedge it that the wife could not be
dispossessed of her endowment by an
improvident or mercenary husband.

A local experimenter in scientific
process says Eoisox may have his

izes the idea recently credited to him of

the aid of any motive power, to any
such extent as to drive a great steamer
across the ocean, with a few baskets of
| coat in place of thousands of tons. This
party credits the wizard of Menlo Park

THE ALLIANCE IN POLITICS.
A Distinction and a Difference.
Chicago Inter Ocean (Hep.) Wjßj
Between the Farmers' Alliance and
Industrial Union, now in session at
Ocala. Fla., and the National Farmers'
Alliance there is a distinction and a dif
ference. The first is a Southern or
gauiza.ion which has gone into politics
on party lines, and has achieved sonic
measure of success. The National
Farmers'. Alliance, on the other hand,
is a political but not a, partisan body.
Organized in the Northern slates, hav
ing free scope for its' action upon two
great parties, accorded the utmost free
dom or' speech, existing in a section of
the Union where every man reads, and
where every corner grocery in the
country is a center of political debate,
the National Farmers' Alliance can
avoid those rocks and shoals of third
partyisin upon which Hie Southern or
ganization is all but sure to be wrecked.
.Old Parties Need Not Fear.
Washington Post (Dem.)
There is no reason why any members
of the old political parties whose patri
otism is eater than their partisanship
should look upon the new movement
with suspicion, much less with fear,
•Some individual ambitions inay,indeed,
be disturbed, but a greater good to a
greater number may be gained. The
farmers of the country have fully as
large an interest in its welfare and
prosperity as any other class of citizens.
They are eminently sensible, practical
and patriotic. They will not adhere to
•a policy which develops a mischievous
tendency. The Alliance movement,
therefore, in giving a fresh impetus to
political action, may lead to a needed
revision of old theories and. methods,
may have an influence on the correction
of some abuses and may do something
toward giving practical c ffect to the
doctrine that a government by the peo
ple is for the people.
Legislation Not the Only Cure.
Toledo Blade (Kep.)
Trie ultimate success of the Farmers'
Alliance rests not so much in present
political action as in the thorough edu
cation of its followers in economic and
social subjects. Many of the disad
vantages under which the agricultural
classes labor spring more from lack ot
information than from lack of legis
lation. Their greatest grievances
cannot be cured by political action.
Cheap money and plenty of it will not
brine any larger returns to shabby
fanning, and the control of a governor
ship or a legislature will not make pros
perous a class that disregards economic
principles.
Not the Tariff, But Money.
Philadelphia Press (Rep.)
The Democratic papers, without a
single exception, are assuming that the
newly-elected Alliance members of the
next house are Democrats politically,
and that they will vote as such on all
tariff legislation that may come up in
that congress, In this they are, we think,
badly mistaken. Secretary Jiittenhouse.
of the National Alliance, writing from
the national headquarters \ in. Washing
ton city, declared that he. received hun
dreds of letters from subordinate organ-:
izations of the Alliance which show that
it was the money question, and not the
tariff issue, that caused the nomination
and election of so many Alliance candi
dates for congress.
A Most Important Gathering. - i
Boston Herald (Ind. > ; j
That it is an important gathering need
not be said. Three newly elected gov
ernors, several congressmen-elect, and
I representative men from every state in:
the, Union are. among its members. It'
I assembles fresh from decided victories
j at the ballot box. and no one. unless it
I be a '"mossback'' politician, blinded by
! tfte glamour and emoluments of power,
can close his eyes to the possibilities
which lie in the proceeeings of the Al
liance.
i- Alliance's Political Fitness.
Brooklyn Citizen (Dem.)
Because the fanners have declared
their independence and shown their
good sense in the recent elections, it
does not follow that it would be wise
for them to form a third patty, or that
they have demonstrated their fitness as
an organization to take on themselves
all the functions of government.
1 he South Not in It.
Atlanta Journal iDem.)
-.^ The Farmers'. Alliance has absolutely
nothing to gain by' going in tc a", third*
p irty, and it will not go Into a third
party so far as the South is concerned.

DUNN'S CLEVER PLAN
The Princeton Editor Wanted
a Walk-Over for Himself
at the Election,
And Offered to Swap an Office
in Advance for a With
drawal.
Price, His Democratic Oppo
nent, Gives a Few Facts
in the Matter.
Samples of Republican Gerry
mandering- for Legisla
tive Purposes.
Tlie more the late election In the
Forty-sixth legislative district is investi
gated the more absurd appears the
lnuch-talked-of contest that is being in
stituted by Hon. Bob Dunn, of Mille
Lacs. A few days ago Mr. Dunn pre
pared a iaiue defense of his position,
and at his request it was published in
the GLOBE. In this Mr. Dunn claimed
that Mr, Price had, at various times
during the campaign, desired to with
draw in his (Dunn's) interest. While
this has no possible bearing on the mat
ter under dispute, it is at least interest
tug to learn from Mr. Price, himself,
that he was asked to withdraw by Mr.
Dunn, and for pay at that. Mr. Dunn,
although running as a Republican can
didate for office, Mr. Price asserta, of
fered to obtain for him, a Democrat, a
position around the legislature at the
coming session.
What did Mr. Dunn nigan by this
offer?
Simply this,that he was willing to make
a dicker by which a Democrat running
in his own county would withdraw,
thus making Dunn's election sure, re
gardless of how this proceeding would
affect his fellow Republican candidates.
In a letter sent in by Mr. Price, which
will be found below, are several se
rious charges in regard to changes
made in the vote of Mille Lacs county.
The following lame apology for the
changes made in the Mille Lacs vote
was printed in the Princeton Union,
Mr. Dunn's paper, last week:
Hon. H. ('. Stivers, editor of the Brainerd
Journal and mayor of that city, attempts to
throw discredit on the vote "of Mille Lacs
county, for the sole purpose of prejudicing
our case and binding us out of a contest for
our rights. That bluff game wont work, Mr.
Stivers. We are not oue of the kiud that
tamely submits to bullyiug. There was not
a dishonest vote cast or returned from Mille
Lacs county. Mr. Stivers states what is un
qualifiedly false when he says twenty votes
were added to the returns ' from
this couu;y because it was thought
Dunn needed thtu many to elect
him. At the time the vote "iv Mille Lacs
county was officially canvassed everybody in
Princeton thought Dunu wes defeated. "We
had conceded our defeat twice in the Union,
and uearly one week after the returns from
this county had been officially canvassed.
We were not present at the official canvass.
A tubulated statement of the vote of the
county was given us by Auditor VanAlstein's
son. We did not discover any error in the
official vote uutil we scrutinized the tiible in
the columns of ttie I'nion five days after the
vote had been canvassed. We were the first
person to inform Auditor Van Alstein of the
mistake, aud ho immediately corrected it.
The error was made by his son in copying
the returns.
The lameness of this defense is made
more apparent by the dozen or more dis
agreeabie lliugs made at Mr. Price by
Mr. Dunn in the same issue of his
paper, as well as the abuse poured out
upon the heads of Sheriff lloiule, of
Morrison, Hon. H. C. Stivers, of Brain
erd, and others, who declined to give
Mr. Dunn an opportunity to take ad
vantage of technicalities at the meet
ing of the canvassing board of the dis
trict at Little Falls. The tact of the
whole matter is: Mr. Dunn's friends
gave away the latter's case when they
admitted that E. E. Price received
2,080 votes and E. L. Price 1.417 votes,
while 11. C. Dunn received only 3,502
votes. A printer's mistake in Mor
rison county is just exactly
what Mr. Dunn seeks to take
advantage of. and, however he may
twist and squirm, he cannot get away
from the tact that Auditors Tache,
Khoda and Van Alstine, all Republi
cans, agreed that the above figures
were correct. As a sample of the per
sonalities printed in Mr. Dunn's paper
is the following paragraph, as it ap
■ peared in the Princeton Union:
S. K. Price, of Foreston. the young- man
| who received such a "flattering" vote from
his own county (Mille Lac»> for the legis-
Jaturo on the Democratic ticket, was in St.
Cloud Sunday.— St. Cioud Journal-Press.
The following dignified letter from
Mr. Price, the gentleman whose seat
Mr. Dunn so ardently seeks, will explain
several claims set up by Mr. Dunn in his
letter published in the Globe Dec. 4:
To the Editor of the Globe:
Will you be kind enough to allow me a
sbort space in your columns for a reply to I{.
(\ Dunn's letter which appeared iii your
issue ot Dec, 4. Air. Dunn states in his' let
ter that I rcpciKdly offered to withdraw iv
his Cavor. If he would leave out the word
repeatedly lie would come somewhere near
the truth. Mr. Dunn sent me word to come
down to his place of residence, stating that
he wunted to see me. I went ctowu and in
terviewed him, and this is what he proposed:
If I would witharaw from the tirket he
would write a letter ot wiihdrawal for me.
I lie made use of the statement that he was
sure of his election and told me he would
get me a position in the house this whiter. I
had no idea of being elected at the time, and
I told him it would be as he said, for I
had no time nor money to spend on the
election, with the chances'the way 1 looked at
them and the way ha made them appear to me.
He agreed to bring the letter of withdrawal
up the coming Friday. This conversation
I took place on Saturday. But instead of
bringing it up, as he agreed, lie went up to
Brainerdand told H. C. Slivers that I wanted
to withdraw. Mr. stivers wrote me at once,
saying it would not do for me to withdraw,
and gave his reasons why. 1 said then that
1 would stay on the ticket if I did not get but
fitly voles. Nothing more was said between
Mr.Dunnandme'on the above-stated subject.
Mr. Editor. I feel rather timid on this sub
ject, for J am young in political matters.
Bat when a man comes out and makes use
of a statement that is untrue. I leel like
making a reply. If Mr. Dunn was perfectly
willing that every vote that was cast for
Price, regardless of initials, should be count
ed for rue, why was he at the canvassing at
Little Falls with Mr. Bruckart, of St. Cloud,
and Mr. Rhodes, of Little Falls, to light that
point? 1 think that Mr. Dunn's remarks are
superfluous iv regard to his proving to
any fair-minded mau or men that if the
votes were counted as cast he would have a
goodly majority, for I beliave that every vole
was east ior him was counted the same. In
Morrison county, where they claim so much
fraud, 1 made inquiry when I was ui> at the
i-iuivassmg, aud couldn't find one that was |
there at the election but what said the vote !
<»f that county was conducted honestly. 1 i
think those who live in glasshouses shouldn't
throw stones, tor I think there was n fraud
perpetrated in MilleLacs county that would
beat them all. It looted that way to me, and
I think it would to nuy fair-mi'uded man:
when Mr. Dunn came out in his paper and
gave himself twenty more- votes than he re
ceived in Mille Lacs Comity, and these
tweuty votes divided up "among the
different precincts. If the mistakes
had all came from one precinct
or even two. it wouldn't have looked so bad;
and I think that Uie extra set of returns that
was sent to Little Falls was the same as
printed by Mr. Dunn. 1 have said nothing
before or idnce election until now, aud did
not intend to say anything until I read Mr.
Dunn's letter which* was published iv the
i;u>BE. I think he is using my name a little
too much for me to keep still aud not retali
ate to souk 1 of his sayings. I feei satisfied
there wouldn't have been v. ghost of a show
for iqc at the canvassing which took place at
Little Falls, hud it not been for men who
came to my assistance. I feel tn.ly thankful
to those men. and if ever the time comes
when I can go out and battle for their inter
ests, I will willingly and sincerely do so.

Foreston, Minn.. Dec. 5, 1390
The inequalities of the legislative ap
portionment of Minnesota are a travesty
on justice and a disgrace to the state,
and one glance at the manner in which
certain Democratic counties arc divided
up for purely partisan purposes will
cause every Republican to cease talking
about Democratic gerrymanders in
Ohio or elsewhere. Take the appor
tionment act passed by the legislature
at the session of ISB9. Turning to the
county of Winona, it will be found thai
it is divided into four legislative dis
tricts.
Why was this done?
simply because If the four represents
tives to which the county is entitled
were elected on one ticket voted lor
throughoutthecouuty.aU lour would
In- Democrats, in Blue Earth count'
all three representative* are voted for
all over the county, and why. .Simnly
because that no "three legislative dis
tricts could be ciphered out in that
county that would be surely Republican.
Thus it is that, with legs than : UA) plur
ality, in Blue Earth county the Repub
licans usually elect three legislators,
while the Democrats, with 1,200 to 1,100
plurality, in Winoua county elect about
one-hall of the legislative delegation.
Killniore county elects its legislators
on the general ticket. The 2,000 lie
publican majority makes them sure for
that party, while now and then one
might escape were the county divide'!
into districts.
.Steams county is divided Intodis
tricts; it has :;,000 Democratic majority,
and v place had to be made for Hon.
Frank E. Searle.
otter Tail is not divided for legisla
tive i)iii posas, for it it were the northern
end of the county would always elect a
Democrat.
(Mutated is undivided also, and here
again 200 of a Republican plurality
elects two mem bets of the house. Were
this plurality on the other side the
county would be divided, and one of the
districts made Republican.
The above are only a lew of the in
numerable instances in which this
double-headed rule is made to do serv
ice, and. every fair-minded man in the
next legislature should insist upon hav
ing a uniform system In. this reappor
tionment matter. If Democratic Wi
nona is to be cut into four legislative
districts, let Republican Olmsted and
Fillmore suffer the same fate. If Steams
county, cannot have the privilege of vot
ing for a straight legislative ticket, why
should Otter Tail? if it is best to subdi
vide the legislative districts it should be
done in every county of the state, and
the independent members-elect of the
legislature will be derelict if they fail
to pass a measure changing this' rotten
and unfair apportionment.
GOOD ANIMAL STORIES.
George Stearues, a farmer from Waik
er county, Alabama, owns a large black
cat which kills every snake and lizardit
can find. The other day he saw the ca
creeping through the arass toward some
kind of prey and watched it. A few feet
away be discovered a large rattle snake
coiled ready to strike, and its bead-like
eyes lixed on those of the cat. The head
of the snake was making the peculiar
swaying motion which is a part of the
charm that brings birds and rabbits
willing victims to the mouth of the hid
eous reptile: Stearnes says he saw at a
glance the snake was trying to charm
the cat, and, as he was not much at
tached to the feline, he stood still to
await results. With its body close to
the ground and its tail sawying back
and forth, the cat continued to
creep slowly forward. its eyes
were fixed on those of the snake,
as though the two weie testing
their powers of mesmerism. Slowly
and cautiously the cat crept closer to
the coiled reptile, and it really seemed
for a while that it had fallen a victim to
the charming powers of the rattler.
When within four feet of the snake the
cat stopped, placed its feet in position
for a spring and remained motionless
for an instant. The snake seemed sur
prised, and changed its position slight
ly. This was the opportunity the cat
was waiting for. Quirk as lightning
the feline leaped and caught the snake
by the neck with teeth and claws, and.
after rolling over and over on the
ground for two minutes, the snake was
dead. The cat did not release its hold
until long after the snake ceased to
move, and then, as it walked away,
would occasionally look back to see "if
there was any suspicious movement.
.Steams says it was the most fascinating
sight U.e ever saw, the cat creeping up
to the snake, which, no doubt, thought
it had secured a good dinner by the
charm of its eye.
Enormous Strength of the Limpet.
Some interesting results of a natural
ist's inquiries are sent to the London
Daily News by J. Lawrence Hamilton.
M. B. C. S. Brighton, who says that, in
proportion to its size.the limpet Is prob
ably the strongest of known animals, ex
cept the Mediterranean -Yonus verru
cosa, acockle-iike creature, which pulls
2.071 times its own weight when ont of
its shell. "At Folkstone, by means of
accurate appliances," says Lawrence
Hamilton. "1 found that "the common
seashore limpet, which, deprived of its
Shell, weighed a minute fraction less
than half an ounce, required, when
pulled according to its plane of adhe
sion, a toice exceeding sixty-two
pounds to remove it from its
powerful grip upon the !o;al littoral
low the rock, or upward ot 1,984 times
its own dead weight. The superficial
area of the base of this individual lim
pet measured 2.4 square inches. Taking
the atmospheric pressure at 14.7 pounds
to the square inch, this would even only
account for 35.28 pounds, or little more
than half the power exercised in the air
by this sea snail, which, acting upon
immersed objects in the water, would,
of course, have pulled a much greater
weight than that of 62 Bounds. Thus,
in tiie air, The limpet pulled up to 32
pounds, but subsequently, in spue of its
previous fatigue, it took upward of 54
pounds to remove it. I doubt whether
the limpet's adhesive force has anything
to do with atmospheric pressure. In
other experiments even bits ot rock
came away, sticking to the limpet's em
brace."'
A Dog Saves Kittens' Lives.
Turk and Tricksy are valued mem
bers of the household of Rev. Mr. Bax
ter, of Columbia, S. C. and though the
former is a big Newfoundland dog and
Tricksy a cat, the two are fast friends
and manifest a sort of * Damon aud
Pythias affection for each other. A
few weeks azo .Tricksy became the
proud mother of three promising kit
tens, and Turk, permitted as a special
favor to inspect them, behaved quite
like a bachelor uncle who has a weak
ness for children. But the mistress of
the house did not share in the rejoicing,
and sternly decreed tne death by drown
ing' of all three of the kitten,*, who were
accordingly delivered over for execution
to a small negro boy employed on the
place. Tricksy, suspecting mischief,
accompanied her squalling offspring to
the scene of the tragedy, a small duck
pond close to the house, where
the boy, taking them from the
basket in which he had car
ried them, threw them one by one into
the water. Poor Tricksy seeing the
first one hurled out into the watery
deep, screamed in anguish, and made si
move as if she would have rushed in
after her kitten, but seeking Turk walk- j
ing near by with his master, ran to him i
crying piteously. She must have made
him understand the trouble, for he ran
immediately to the pond and plunged
in at once. The first kitten had by
this 7 time perished, but the second had
barely struck the water before Turk
had it in its mouth, and was wading in
with it held high, when the third was
thrown. • With a good deal of dexterity
he managed to seize both of them, and
made his way to terra lirma. where the
mother relieved him of his burden.
Mr. Baxter,' who had watched the whole
proceeding, prevented the boy from re
peating the performance, and interceded
with his wife for the kittens" lives
