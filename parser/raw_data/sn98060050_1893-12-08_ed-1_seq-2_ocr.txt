THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
Annual Statement of Our AH'nlrs.
The WNnii Tariff Hill Fully Endorsed.
Mr. Clurlnml Would ltestnre the lln
vvitllnn (liirrn Pension) Oie Pns, Of
fice llrimrliitriit! tlir liiillntix. Ktc.
The message opeii9 with the usual re
view of our relations with foreign countries.
These are amicable ami satisfactory with
no serious exception. An impartial atti
tude has been maintained in regard to the
rebellion now In progress in Brazil, and
there has seemed to bo no occasion to rec
ognize the insurgents, who consist of the
officers, men and vessels of the navy, so
far as active operations are concerned.
It is believed that, under the recent
amendment to the Geary law, Chinese la
borers In this country, who refused to com
ply with the law last sprlnc, will avail
themselves of the renewed privilege thus
afforded of acquiring a legal right to remain
here, and the necessity for enforced depor
tation will thereby be avoided to a great
extent.
The Nicaragua canal company has be
come financially embarrassed, and has been
compelled to suspend work, but the Presi
dent earnestly hopes that this great enter
prise may bo completed eventually under
American auspices.
In response to urgent protests made by
out government the Turkish government
has made, or promised to make, reparation
for the work of a mob In that country in
attacking and partly destroying Anatolia
college, established at Marsovan by citizens
of the United States, and also for attacks
on our missionaries, who are doing legiti
mate work in Turkey.
With regard to the Hawaiian question
the message says :
llav nil.
It Is hardly necessary for me to state
that the questions arising from our rela
tions with Hawaii have caused serious em
barrassment. Just prior to the installation
of the present administration the existing
government of Hawaii had been suddenly
overthrown and a treaty of annexation liad
been negotiated between the provisional
government of the Islands and the United
States, and submitted to the Senate for
ratification. This treaty I withdrew for
examination, and despatched James H.
lilount of Georgia to Honolulu, as a spe
cial commissioner, to make an impartial
investigation of the circumstances attend
ing the change of government, and of all
the conditions healing upon the subject of
the treaty. After a thorough and exhaus
tive examination, Mr. lilount submitted to
me his report, showing beyond all question
that the constitutional government of
Hawaii had been subverted with the active
aid of our representative to that govern
ment, and through the intimidation caused
by the presence of an armed naval force of
the United States, which was landed for
that purpose at the instance of our min
ister. Upon the facts developed it seemed
to me that the only honorable course for
our government to pursue was to undo the
wrong that bad been done by those repre
senting us and to restore as far as practica
ble the status existing at the time of our
forcible intervention.
With a vie- of accomplishing this result
within the constitutional limits of executive
power, and recognizing all our obligations
and responsibility growing out of any
changed conditions brought about by our
unjustifiable interference, our present min
ister at Honolulu has received appropriate
instructions to that end. Thus far no in
formation of the accomplishment of any
definite results has been received from him.
Additional advices are soon expected.
When received they will be promptly sent
to Congress, together with all information
at hand, accompanied by a special execu
tive message fully detailing all the facts
necessary to a complete understanding of
the case, and presenting a history of" all
the material events leading up to the pres
ent situation.
Arbitration.
Great Britain has responded favorably
to the resolution of Congress, declaring
that all differences between nations ought
to be settled by arbitration.
illllllt-lnl Mutter.
The amount of gold exported during the
last fiscal year was larger than in any pre
vious year In the history of the govern
ment, amounting to S-lOS.tiSO.-J-l, and ex
ceeding the amount exported during the
preceding year by $5S,-4S."i,ol7. The sum
paid from the treasury for sugar bounty
was fi),;17."),130.8S, an increase over the
preceding year of -J,0;!3,0j3.00.
It is estimated upon the basis of present
revenue laws that the receipts of the gov.
eminent for the j-ear ending June 00, lt0-l,
will be S"430,121,o(w.P.S; and its expendi
tures $-15K,l:ll3(l.'.::; resulting in a de
ficiency of $28,000,000.
The purchases of silver under the law of
July 14, 1800, during the last fiscal year,
aggregated 54,O0S,ltlJ.5i) fine ounces, which
cost $45,S31,u74.,"3. The total amount of
silver purchased from the time that law
became operative until the repeal of its
purchasing clause, on the first day of No
vember, 1803, was 108,074,500.-10 fine
ounces, which cost $irri,030,040.84.
It is estimated that on the first dayof
July, 1803, the metallic stock of money in
the United States, consisting of coin aVid
bullion, amounted to S-l,'213,.")0,100, of
which ?vj07,007,OS."i was gold and ftil.1,
S01.4S4 was silver.
One hundred and nineteen national bauks
were organized during the year ending
October 31, 1803, with a capital of $11,
L'30,000. Forty-six went into voluntary
liquidation and 1.18 suspended. Sixty-live
of the suspended banks wero lnsolvent,80
resumed business, and seven remain in the
hands of bank examiners, with prospects
of speedy resumption. The total number
of national banks in existence on the 31st
day of October, 1803, was 3700, having an
aggregate capital of $005,558,120. The
net increase in the circulation of these
banks during the year was $30,380,072.
Till- Silver tlurstliili.
The repeal of the silver purchase law
has made an entire change In the complex
Ion of our currency affairs, and I do not
doubt that the ultimate result of this action
will be most salutary and far reaching. In
the nature of things, however, it is impos
sible to know, at this time, what supple
mentary legislation may prove to be essen
tial or expedient. When, however, through
restored confidence, the money which has
been frightened into hoarding places Is re
turned to trade and enterprise, a survey of
the situation will probably disclose a safe
path leading to a permanent sound cur
rency, abundantly sufficient to meet every
requirement of our increasing population
and business. In the pursuit of this ob
ject we should resolutely turn away from
alluring and temporary expedients, deter
mined to be content with nothing less than
a lasting and comprehensive financial plan.
In these circumstances I am convinced
that a reasonable delay In dealing with this
subject will Increase the probability of wise
action.
Tlir War Department,
The secretary of war reports that the
strength of the army on the 30th day of
September last was 2.1,778 enlisted men,
and 2144 officers. The total enrollment of
the militia of the several states was, on the '
31st of October of the current year. 112,507
officers and enlisted men. The officers of
the army detailed for the Inspection and
Instruction of this resent- of our military
force repoit that increased interest and
marked progress are apparent in the dis
cipline and efficiency of the organization.
Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic
violence has called the army Into service
during the year.
Tlir Clilrkniuntign llnllli flt Id.
The work on the projected Clilckaniauga
and Chattanooga national military park
has been prosecuted with zeal and judg
ment, and its opening will be celebrated
during the coming year. Over nine square
miles of the Chickamauga battlefield have
been acquired, 2.1 miles of roadway have
been constructed, and permanent tablets
have been placed at many historical points,
while the invitation to the states to mark
the positions of their troops participating
in the battle has been very generally ac
cepted. The work of locating and preserv
ing the lines of battle at the Gettysburg
battlefield Is making satisfactory progress
on the plans directed by the last Congress.
I'o.t-orllt r Irinrtinrnt.
The business of the mails indicates with
absolute certainty the condition of the
business of the country, and depression in
financial affairs Inevitably and quickly re
duces the postal revenues. Therefore a
larger discrepancy than usual between the
post-office receipts and expenditures is the
unavoidable result of the distressing strin
gency which has prevailed throughout the
country during much of the time covered
by the postmaster general's report. At a
date when better times were anticipated it
was estimated by his predecessor that the
deficiency on June 30, 180."., would be but
a little over a million and a half dollars. It
amounted, however, to more than five mil
lions. The post-office receipts for the last
fiscal year amounted to $7-1,800,033.10, and
Its expenditures to $-U.074,101.HO. This
post-office deficiency would disappear or
be immensely decreased if less matter was
carried free through the malls, an Item of
which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and
grain from the agricultural department.
The total number of post-offices in the
United States on the 30lh day of June,
lf03, was 08,403, an increase of 12S4 over
the preceding year. Of these 3300 were
presidential, an increase in that class of
204 over the preceding year.
I am decidedly of the opinion that the
provisions of the present law for the free
delivery of mails permit as general an in
troduction of this feature of mail service
as is necessary or justifiable, and that it
ought not to be extended to smaller com
munities than are now designated. There
are now connected to the post-office estab
lishment 2.",324 employes, who are in Un
classified service. The head of this great
department gives conclusive evidence of
the value of civil service reform wheij, aft
er an experience that renders his judgment
on the subject absolutely reliable, he ex
presses the opinion that without the benefit
of tills system It would be impossible to
conduct the vast business intrusted to him.
I'rlittlmtH.
On the 30lh day of Juno, 1803, there
were on the pensiou rolls 000,012 names, an
increase of 80,044 over the number on the
rolls June 30, 1802.
Of these there were 17 widows and
daughters of lleolutionary soldiers, 80
survivors of the war of 1M2, 542.1 widows
of soldiers of the war, 21,518 survivors anil
widows of the Mexican war, 3S2 survhors
and widows of Indian wars, 2.4 army
nurses, and 475, (U.I survivors, and widows
and children of deceased soldiers and sail
ors of the war of the Iiebelllon. The lat
ter number represents those pensioned on
account of disabilities or death resulting
from army and navy service. The number
of persons remaining on the rolls June 30,
1MI3, who were pensioned under the act of
June 27, IsOO, which allows pensions on
account of death and disability not charge
able to army service was 4.10,155.
The number added to the rolls during the
year was 123,104, and the number dropped
was 3:1,000.
Although the law of 1M0 permits pen
sions for disabilities not related to military
service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a
disability must exist, incapacitating appli
cants "from the performance of manual
labor to such a degree as to render them
unable to earn a support." The execution
of tills law in its early stages does not
seem to have been in accord with its true
intention, but toward the close of the last
administration an authoritative construc
tion was given to the statute, and since
that time this construction has been fol
lowed. This has had theeffect of limiting
the operation of the law to its intended
purpose.
The discovery having been made that
many names had been put upon the pen
sion roll by means of wholesale and gigan
tic frauds, the commissioner suspended
payments upon a number of pensions
which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthor
ized, pending a complete examination, giv
ing notice to the pensioner!), in order that
they might have an opportunity to estab
lish, if possible, the justice of their claims,
notwithstanding apparent invalidity. This,
I understand, is the practice w liich lias for
a long time prevailed in the pension bu
reau; but after entering upon these recent
investigations the commissioner modified
this rule, so as not to allow, until after a
complete examination, interference with
the payment of a pension apparently not
altogether, void, but which merely had been
fixed at a rate higher than that authorized
by law.
I am unable to understand why frauds in
the pension rolls should not be exposed
and corrected with thoroughness and vigor.
Kvery name fraudulently put upon these
tolls is a wicked imposition upon the kind
ly sentiment in which pensions have their
origin; every fraudulent pensioner lias
become a bad citizen; every false oath In
support of a pension has made perjury
more frequent, and undeserving pensioners
rob the people not only of their money,
but of the patriotic sentiment which the
survivors of a war, fought for the preser
vation of the Union, ought to inspire.
Thousands of neighborhoods have their
well-known fraudulent pensioners, and re
cent developments by the bureau establish
appalling conspiracies to accomplish pen
sion frauds, liy no means the least wrong
done Is to brave, deserving pensioners, who
certainly ought not to be condemned to
such association. Those who attempt in
the line of duty to rectify these wrongs
should not be accused of enmity or indif
ference to the claims of honest veterans.
The sum expended on account of pen
sions for the year ending June 30, 1803,
was 150,740,407. 14. The commissioner
estimates that $10.1,000,000 will be requir
ed to pay pensions during the year ending
June 30, 1804.
The Indiana.
Our Indians number about 248,000.
Most of them are located on 101 reserva
tions, containing 80,110,531 acres of land.
About 110,000 of these Indians have, to a
large degree, adopted civilized customs.
Lands in severalty have been allotted to
10,000 individuals, the allotments during
the last fiscal year amounting to about 100,
000 acres. The number of Indian govern
ment schools open during the year was 105,
an Increase of 12 over the preceding year.
The total number of Indian children en
rolled during the year as attendants of all
schools was 21,138, an Increase of 1231
over the enrollment for the previous year.
I am sure that secular education and
moral and religious teaching must be Im
portant factors In any effort to save the In
dian and lead him to civilization, I be
lieve, too, that the relinquishment of tribal
relations and the holding of land in sever
alty may, in favorable conditions, aid this
consummation. It seems to me, however,
that allotments of land In severally ought
to be made with great care and circum
spection. If hastily done, before the In
dian knows its meaning, while yet he has
little or no idea of tilling a farm and no
conception of thrift, thero Is great danger
that a reservation life In tribal relations
may be exchanged (or the pauperism of
civilization, instead of its independence
and elevation.
Tlir Agricultural Dipnitmrlit.
On the 7th day of March, 1803, there
were upon the pay rolls of this department
2480 employes. This number has been
reduced to 1850 persons. In view of a de
pleted public treasury, and the Imperative
demand of the people for economy In the
administration of their government, the
secretary has entered upon the task of ra
tionally reducing expenditures by the elim
ination from the pay rolls of all persons
not needed for an efficient conduct of the
affilrs of the department.
The regulations of 1802 concerning Tex
as fever hae been enforced during the last
year, and the large stock yards of the
country have been kept free from Infection.
While contagious pleuro-pnetimonia in cat
tle has been eradicated, animal tuberculosis,
a disease widespread and more dangerous
to human life than plcuro-pncumonla, is
still prevalent. Investigations have been
made during the past year as to the
means of its communication and the meth
od of its correct diagnosis. This work
ought to be extended, in cooperation with
local authorities, until the danger to hu
man life arising from this cause Is reduced
to a minimum.
The agricultural exports show a falling
off of about 25 per cent from the preced
ing year, the decrease occurring entirely In
the last half of the year. This suggests
that the falling off may have been largely
due to an increase in the price of American
export cattle.
Tlie exports of acrlcultural products
from the United Males for the fiscal year
eniiing.iune ;i, imij, attained the enor
mous figure of $00.000,000 in round num
bers, being 7.7 per cent of our total ex
ports. In the last fiscal year this aggre
gate was greatly reduced, but, neverthe
less, reached Mtl.l.OOO.OiK). being 75.1 per
cent oi an American commodities export
ed. Kliiirmiiiia DUlriliiillim uT St-ril.
Under the sanction of existing legisla
tion there was sent out from the agricult
ural department during the last fiscal year
enough of cabbage seed to plant 10,200
acres of land, a" sufficient quantity of
beau to plant 4IKK) acres, beet seed enough
to plant 2.100 acres, sweet corn enough to
pi mt 7800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed
to cover 2025 acres with vines, and enough
muskmelon anil watermelon seeds to plant
2075 acres. The total quantity of flower
and vegetable seeds thus distributed was
contained in more than 0.000,000 packages,
and they were sufficient, if planted, to cov
er 80,500 acres of land.
In view of these facts this enormous ex
penditure, without legitimate returns of
benefit, ought to be abolished. Anticipat
ing a consummation so manifestly in the
interest of good administration, more than
$100,000 has been stricken fiom the esti
mate made to cover this object for the year
ending June 30, 180.1; and the secretary
recommends that the remaining $3.1.000 of
tlie estimate be confined strictly to the
purchase of new and improved varieties of
seeds and that these be distributed through
experiment stations..
t'lill Srrvlre ltrftirm.
The continued intelligent execution of
tlie civil service law and the Increasing ap
proval by the people of its operation are
most gr.Uifing. Tlie recent extension of
its limitations ami regulations to tlie em
ployes at free delivery pot-o!lices, which
lias been honestly and promptly accom
plished by the commission, witli the hearty
cooperation of the potmaler general, is
an immensely important advance in the
usefulness of the system. 1 am, if possi
ble, more than ever convinced of the in
calculable benefits conferral by the civil
service law. not only in its effect upon the
public service, butao, what Is even more
important, in its effect in elevating the tone
of political life generally. The course of
civil service reform in- this country in
structively and in erestingly illustrates how
strong a bold a movement gains upon our
people which has underlying it a senti
ment of justice and right, and which at the
same time promises better administration
of their government. The law embodying
this reform found its way to our statute
book more from fear of the popular senti
ment existing in its favor than from any
love for the reform itself on the part of
legislators, and it has lived and grown and
flourished in spite of the covert as well as
open hostility of spoilsmen and notwith
standing querulous impracticability of
many self-constituted guardians. Beneath
all the vagaries and sublimated theories
which are attracted to it, there underlies
this reform a sturdy common-sense princi
ple not only suited to this mundane sphere,
but whose application our people are more
and more recognizing to be absolutely es
sential to the most successful operation of
their government, If not to its perpetuity.
Tariff Hi fin in.
After a hard struggle tariff reform is di
rectly before us. Nothing so Important
claims our attention and nothing so clearly
presents itself as both an opportunity and
a duty an opportunity to deserve tlie grat
itude of our fellow citizens and a duty im
posed upon us lw our oft-repeated profes
sions and by the emphatic mandate of the
people. After full discussion our country
men have spoken in favor of this reform,
and they have confided tlie work of Its ac
complishment to the ban Is of those who
are solemnly pledged to It.
If there is anything in theory of a repre
sentation in public places of the people
and their desires, if public officers are real
ly the servants of the people, and if polit
ical promises and protestations have any
binding force, our failure to give the relief
so long awaited will be sheer recreancy.
Nothing should intervene to distract our
attention or disturb our effort until this
reform Is accomplished by wise and careful
tfrzm&s folk

f
legislation While wo should stanchly
adhere to the principle that only the neces
sity of revenue jiwtlfles the Imposition of
tariff duties and other federal taxation,
and that they should be limited by strict
economy, we catinoi close our eves to the
fact that conditions have grown up among
us which In justice and fairness call for dis
criminating care in the distribution of such
duties and taxation as the emergencies of
our government actually demand.
Manifestly, if we are to aid the peo
ple directly through tariff reform, one of
its most obvious features should be a
reduction In present tariff charges upon
the necessaries of life. The benefits of
such a reduction would be palpable and
substantial, seen and felt by thousands
who would be better fed and better clothed
and better sheltered. These gifts should
be the willing benefactions of a govern
ment whose highest function is the promo
tion of the welfare of the people.
Not less closely related to our people's
prosperity and well-being Is the removal of
restrictions upon the Importation of the
raw material necessary to our manufact
ures. The world should be open to our
national Ingenuity and enterprise. This
cannot lie while federal legislation through
the Imposition of high tariff, forbids to
American manufacturers as cheap materi
als as those used by their competitors. It
Is quite obvious that the enhancement of
the price of our manufactured products re
sulting from tills policy not only confines
the market for these products within our
own borders, to the direct disadvantage of
our manufacturers, but also increases their
cost to our citizens.
The interests of labor are certainly,
though indirectly, Involved In this feature
of our tariff system. The sharp competi
tion and active struggle among our manu
facturers to supply thellmlted demand for
their goods soon fill the narrow market to
which they are confined. Then follows a
suspension of work in mills and fac'.ories,
a discharge of employes, and distress .in
the homes of our workingmen. Even if the
often disprovixl assertion could be made
good, that a lower rate of wages would re
sult from free raw materials and low tariff
duties, the Intelligence of our workingmen
leads them to quickly disc iver that their
steady employment, permitted by free raw
materials, is tlie most important factor in
their relation to tariff legislation.
Tlir Xevr Tallir Hilt.
A measure has been prepared by the
congressional committee, embodying tariff
reform on the lines herein suggested, which
will be promptly submitted for legislative
action. It is tlie result of much patriotic
and unselfish work, and I hvlieve it deals
with Its subject consistently and as thor
oughly as existingcomlitlons permit. I am
satisfied that the deduced tariff duties prc
vided for in the proposed legislation, added
to existing internal reenue taxation, will,
in the near future, though perhaps not im
mediately, produce sufficient revenue to
meet the needs of the government.
The committee, after full consideration,
and to provide against a temporary defi
ciency which may exist before tlie business
of the country adjusts itself to the new
tariff schedule, have wisely embraced in
their plan a few additional internal revenue
taxes, including a small tax upon incomes
derived from certain corporite investments.
These new assessments are not only abso
lutely just and easily borne, but they have
the further merit of being such as can be
remitted without unfavorable business dis
turbance whenever the necessity of their
imposition no longer exists.
In my great desire for the success of this
measure I cannot restrain the suggestion
that its success can only lie attained by
means of unselfish counsel on the part of
the friends of tariff reform, and as a result
of their willingness to subordinate person
al desires and ambitions to the general
good. The local interests affected by the
proposed reform are so numerous and so
varied that if all are insisted ujion tlie leg
islation embodying the reform must inevi
tably fail.
riiiiii'.
In conclusion, my intense feeling of re
sponsibility impels" me to invoke, for the
manifold interests of a generous and con
fiding jx-ople, tlie most scrupulous care,
and to pledge my willing support to every
legislative effort for the advancement of
the greatness and prosperity of our beloved
country.

Executive Mansion, Washington, Dec.
4, 1803.
A HemiM-ratlf Opinion.
From tlie Ne York Sun J
In what he has to say about the reform
of the tariff, Mr. Cleveland recognizes "the
emphatic verdict of the people," but he is
very careful not to say what that emphatic
verdict was. There is not a word about
the constitutional limitations on tlie taxing
power of the government, as affirmed by
the Democratic platform on which he was
elected. The generalities and half-truths
and solemn nothings which are so charac
teristic of his rhetorical stvle. are emnloved
No hide tlie naked Iniquity of his proposi
tion that the platform shall be repudiated
by the party, and that the Democracy shall
now engage in the construction of an avow
edly protective tariff, differing from the
MeKinley tariff in the degree of Its Me
Kinleyism, but not in kind. . . . The
personal note sounds as usual throughout
the message, swelling in the last paragraph
to an impressive acknowledgment of the
President's "intense feeling of responsibil
ity," not only for his own share in the
management of tlie nation's affairs, but
also for the doings of the Congress.
A I'rolilrm in .tlnlliriuaf iia.
From the New York Tribune
Mr. Cleveland does not seem to grasp the
meaning of the treasury reports which he
submits. Regarding these, lie says that
the estimated revenue for the cutrent year
falls short of estimated expenses by $38,
000,000. As the decrease in revenue for
only five months has been over $31,000,000,
the statement seems singularly out of place
in such a state paper. The present tariff
law, under Democratic conduct, yields less
by about $70,000,000 yearly than it did last
year, and the proposed tariff will cut off,
according to Chairman Wilson, about $50,
000,000 yearly from last year's revenue. It
is not to tlie President's credit that he
avoids the problem thus presented.

per head.
A comparison of the above rates will
show that the foundations of Vermont's
prosperity are attacked at every point by
the tariff reformers. Her leading industry
is agriculture, and there Is not an article
of farm products upon which the duty Is
not either very largely reduced or wiped
out entirely. Had this bill been framed
by a committee of the Dominion parlia
ment, Its rates could hardly have been ar
ranged so well to conserve the interest of
the Canadian fanner or more decisively to
the disadvantage of tlie Vermont farmer.
In other schedules a sharp discrimination
against Vermont products is also msde.
Vermont's minerals, in particular, are
placed at the mercy of foreign competition.
In this section of Vermont, disaster to an
important industry lurks in the proposed
rate of duty on imported granite. Scotch
granite, even under existing duties, has
been a close competitor with the American.
Tlie pay of a granite-cutter in Scotland
for a week is hardly greater than the dally
wages of his brother in America, (iranite
is brought from Scotland as ballast, and
the freight is merely nominal. It prob
ably costs less to land foreign granite at
any of the leading seaport towns of the
Cnited States than to freight it from any
of the inland American quarries, (iranite
in the rough is on the free list in the bill
proposed by Chairman Wilson. The ex
isting duty of -10 per cent on diessed gran
ite is reduced to 0 jier cent. The bare
statement of these simple facts and consid
erations is enough to show that the new
tariff bill levels a death blow to one of the
most important brandies of Vermont in
dustry, u branch which, under the fostering
care of tariffs enacted under ltepubliean
administrations, is now in mid career of a
marvelous development. The tariff re
former has dealt somewhat more leniently
witli marble and slate, (iranite seems to
lie the object of his special malevolence.
In this connection the casual observer
might raise the query, why i a large duty
on marble in the rough" retained, while
granite in the same condition is sent to the
free list?
Lumlier is another article in the produc
tion of which our neighbor on tlie north js
an active competitor. Here again the Dem
ocratic tariff reformer discriminates in fa
vor of the Canuck against the Yankee.
All the old duties in this branch of indus
try are annulled, and lumber, imiuditu'
clapboards, shingles; railway ties, etc.. et. .,
all the peculiar products of Vermont for
ests, are placed in the free list. The lum
berman is a proieetive companion in mis
ery of the farmer, the quarryman and the
manufacturer.
Disaster to all her material interests must
inevitably result to Vermont if the Wilson
report, or anything similar to it, ultimately
becomes a law. Had Vermont's old-time
Republicanism ever shown any signs of
waning, this attack upon her intorests
would kullice to reinspire her devotion to
I'epublican principles. In the next con
flict with organized Democracy, this state
will lead the attack with a vigor and unan
imity that will eclipse any of her former
achievements in the way of political war
fare. AVirc than Siberia.
Outragr on Xrgrora Told In tin- Afro
Ainrrlran Cmiprrn.
Cincinnati Scl!il to the New York Press 1
If half the stories told by delegates to
the Afro-American congress in session here
of outrages perpetrated on the blacks in
the South are true, the horrors of Siberia
are not alone in the racial crimes of the
age. Delegates from Georgia, the Caro
linas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi
relate that scores of negroes are shot down
in cold blood; that many are lynched;
that untold numbers are maimed for life in
pure wantonuess, and not a word of it
reaches the outside world. Such work Is
not a crime In the South. Crops of black
men are openly taken, and a protest means
ueaui, or at uosl tlie destruction of the i
cabins In which the wretched creatures i
live. i
Drunken white men riding along the I
road think it fun to shoot at negroes in tlie
fields. It is a common occurrence for ne- I
gro families to hoar bullets whizzing about I
meir neaus, ureu tnrougu windows by
travelers on the highway. That is oue
reason the blacks seek secluded spots in
which to build their huts. 'o negro is al
lowed to accumulate property in the rural
sections. If he raises more cotton than is
necessary to pay his rent he wakes up
some morning to find it burned or gone.
