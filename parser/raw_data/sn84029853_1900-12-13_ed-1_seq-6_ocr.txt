THE SANTA FETELE6RAPHERS
Their Strike Was Sudden But Had
Been Prepared For.
MEN CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
Wichita, Dec 11. J. A. Newman, of
this city, who is general chairman of
the Santa. Fe division of the Order of
Railway Telegraphers, including the '
entire Santa Fe system, issued an or
der to workers for the Santa Fe to stop
worlc. invoice their offices and guard
them until some official of the road
should check them out. The strike
has been brought about by the trouble
between the operators on the Gulf,
Colorado & Santa Fe and the officers of
the road, and the general strike was
ordered in sympathy to the cause of
the Gulf operators.
Mr. Newman, who has been employ
ed in the Santa Fe division office here
for about ten years, says that there are
something like 1,300 telegraph em
ployes on the Santa Fe system aad it
will be utterly impossible for the com
pany to fill their places. We are out
and will stay out until we win all of
the conditions, in which case te will
return. One of the conditions is that
all of the non-union operators mir-st be
dismissed from the service of the San
ta Fe.
Topelca, Dec. 11. When the strike
order was received here the operators
in the general offices and at the depot
quit work with only a very few ex
ceptions. C. G. Sholes, superintendent
of telegraph of the Santa Fe went to
work at the key and so did General
Manager II. U. Mudge, and ther were
others found in the departments, suffi
cient to do the most important work.
Mr. Mudge said that he anticipated
no especial trouble in the operation of
trains as most of tlie trains are run
ning on time table schedule, and that
a great many new men had been se
cured already and more of them are
constantly applying for positions. He
Raid: '"The whole trouble hinged on
the rules and regulations. The wage
scale was up for consideration, but the
road agreed to arbitrate on that point.
The rules and regulations have been
up and were not settled. The road
would not agree to the rules which
were asked by the men, and the strike
is tl-.e result."
The operators in Topeka say they are
sure to win in this case and feel cer
tain that they will interest the other
railway organizations in their behalf.
L. C. Radgely, assistant local chair
man of the telegraphers' order, says
tli at
the fight between the operators
and
the Santa Fe is a fight to the fin-
They feel that they will win, and
hold out until the matter is

up and got breakfast and washed the
dishes. "She did the housework. I was
preparing to wash. After Jessie fin
ished I gave her some prunes to wash

go over to Lizzie Davis' to see a pat
t srn. I'll be back in time to make
f tarch for the clothes."

1899? A. Sometimes three times s.
week and never less than once.

IHE DFENDANT TESTIFIES;
It is a Question of Which ' Woman
Told the Truth.
MORGAN'S DEPOSITION REC'D.
Kl Dorado, Dec 10. When Jessie
Morrison took the witness stand, she
was weak but she met the crisis with
firmness. As usual the spectators were
mostly women. Witnesses for the de-
fense first testified contradicting a
number cf statements made by wit
nesses for the state.
The deposition of J. A. Morgan was
then introduced. Is a canvassing agent;
was canvassing El Dorado on June 22;
on that morning visited the house of
the deceased, Mrs. Castle; after leaving
heard a knocking on the inside of the
door screen; thought he was being
called back and looked that way; saw
Mrs. Ct.stle was not looking at him but
at a small lady who did not stop until
Mrs. Castle said to her "Jess, come in.
I want to talk to you." Before he was
out of hearing he heard a scream, and
started back, and saw the small lady
brought out of the house. He then
left and the next morning left the
town.
Jessie Morrison then testified. Knew
Olin Castle; he called on me from once
to three times a week; often took me
buggy r;ding, and took me to" parties.
He always furnished the conveyance,
the went to Excelsior Springs to visit
her sister. Never said to Castle "I'll
fix you." Did not make any threat
when she asked Castle for her letters.
Never wrote Castle an anonymous let
ter; never wrote him that she was in
trouble and for him to remember his
promise. Never wrote him about any
'scheme." Castle gave me a mirror
and he said Clara would make a scene
if he told her about it. She denied
every statement made by Castle in his
testimony. She had never got a razor
at the Racket store and never tried to
do so. Had no razor or knife in her
possession the fatal morning. When she
left Mrs. Davis' with the collar pattern
she started home, had no thought of
stopping at Castle's. Mrs. Castle called
her in. There was a man on the side
walk. Said nothing to Clara about
any letter. Was shown the razor; said
she had never seen it at that time; had
no sharp instrument in her pocket; had
no thought of trouble with Clara when
she went m.
Miss Morrison then related the story
of the figlit.
During a quarrel had dropped her
handkerchief and while picking it up
Clara had cut her throat. Then the
fight commenced, during which the
witness had taken the razor away from
Mrs. Castle and while Mrs. Castle was
on tr'P of her, both on the lounge and
on the floor, Mrs. Castle received the
slashes from the razor in the hands of
the witness She saw only one razor.
Mrs. Moberly was the first one to enter.
she asked "What is the matter; I re
plied, "she tried to kill me." Mrs.
Spangler came in and asked the same
as Mrs. Moberly and I replied, "Clara
called me in and tried to kill me and I
am afraid I have killed her." "I
stooped down to take my skirt from
under Clara and to put on one of my
slippers." "Did not try to conceal any
thing in my skirts." I had two hat
pins in my hand when I was going
home from Castle's, which had dropped;
had nothing else in my hands."
Q. At the time you used the razor
on Mrs. Castle did you believe your life
was in danger? A. I did. There was
nothing said about a letter by either
of us when I went into the house. Did
not ask Mrs. Castle if there was any
one about the house." I did not cut
myself."
In answer to cross examination she
said: Was never engaged to Olin Cas
tle. There was no promise on either
side. Had no intention of going to
the Castle houe when I left home.
When I dropped my handkerchief and
before she cut me I beard her jump
toward the stand but I did not see her.
Mrs. Castle's first conversation com
menced with "You know that I hate
you."
Judge Shinn's charge to- the jury
was considered to be. in effect at least,
very lenient and favorable toward
Jessie Morrison.

Salisbury's Ultimatum.
London, Dec. 8. Premier Lord Salis
bury in reply to bitter criticisms from
members of the house of commons said:.
"Anything resembling independence
to the Boers can never be granted.
The war must proceed to its inevitable
issues. We must let it be felt that no
one, by the issue of an insolent and
audacious ultimatum, can force the
British government to abandon its
rights. Not a single shred of inde
pendence must be left. How soon the
Transvaalers have safeguarding powers
depends on themselves. It might be
years and it might be generations."
A -General Order to Close Shops.
T;r '.to., Dec 11. General Manager
n. i - Mudge, before the telegraph
stiike, issued an order that shou'd
a sympathy strike be ordered
to all telegraphers, that vwork be sus
pended at once in all departments by
all men whose services are not actually
required for handling business that is
being moved, and for the protection of
property, until the company is able to
resume handling business under normal
conditions. When that occurs the men
so suepended to be returned to work.
EVERY PRECAUTION TAKEN V
To Prevent - Accidents PUot Engines
Ahead of Each Train.
- Chicago, Dec 11. Third vice presi
dent J. II. Barr eays: "There was no
grievance existing between the com
pany and the operators on any of the
lines of the system other than the Gulf
lines. The operators employed on the
lines were working on agreements en
titled the company to . thirty days"
notice of a desire on the part of the
operators to cancel them. No notice
of strike was served on the co-npany.
"Operators are being employed to
replace the men who quit work."
As soon as the company knew of the
trouble it was compelled to f ac&, word,
was sent along the lines to set the
danger signal at all switches, and
ahead of all passenger trains a pilot
engine was sent out, the crew looking
after all switches and setting the
proper signals for the train behind.
It was announced at the offices of
the company that trains would con
tinue to be run in this way and that in
stretches of territory where there were
no operators the trains would be run
on schedule time, the engineer regu
lating his speed by the time card.
ISoth Side Confldent.
Topeka, Dec 11. The indications
are now that the Santa Fe will have
more strike trouble before long if the
present troubles with the telegraphers
continue. Dispatches received here in
dicate dissatisfaction among the train
men in some" division points.
