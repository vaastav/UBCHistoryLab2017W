President of the United States Sends in Kis
Annual Message to Congress
Today.
EVtDENCES_OF PROSPERITY
CHIEF EXECUTIVE POINTS OUT PROOFS OF OUR GROWING
STRENGTH-CHINESE PROBLEMS AND OTHER
! MATTERS-SYNOPSIS OF TOPICS.
j
To the Senate anil House of Represen
tatives:
With the outgoing of the olil and the
beginning of the new century, you begin
the last session of the Fifty-sixth con
gress with evidences on every hand of
individual and national prosperity and
tv i tit proof of the growing strength and
increasing jjower for good to republican
institutions. Your countrymen will join
with you in felicitation that American
liberty is more firmly established than
ever before and that love for it and the
determination to preserve it are more
universal than at any former period of
our history.
The republic was never so strong, be
cause never so strongly entrenched in
the hearts of the people as now. The
constitution with few amendments exist
as it left the hands of its authors. The
additions which have been made to it
proclaim larger freedom and more ex
tended citizenship. Popular government
has demonstrated in its one hundred and
twenty-four years of trial here its sta
bility and security and its efficiency as
the best safeguard to human rights.
When the sixth congress assembled in
[November 1800, the population of the
United States was 5,308,483. It is now
70,304,700. Then we had sixteeen states.
Now we have forty-five. Then our ter
ritory consisted of 900,050 square miles. It
is now 3,846,595 square miles. Education,
religion and morality have kept pace
with our advancement in other directions
and while extending iis power the gov
ernment has adhered to its foundation
principles and abated none of them in
dealing with our new peoples and posses
sions. A nation so preserved und Messed
gives reverent thanks to God and invokes
his guirance and the continuance of his
care ad favor.
The president in discussing the for
eign intercourse of the country goes
quite fully into the Chinese problem,
saying that it is the dominant question
under this head. The relations of the
United States with China and the de
velopment of the Boxer movement are
treated in a clear and complete man
ner. Then tire siege of the legations is
taken iup. "By June 0 the legations were
cut off," says the message. "A note from
the yamen ordered each minister to leave
Pekin, under a promised escort, within
34 hours. To gain time, they replied
Risking prolongation of the time, which
was afterward granted, and requesting
an interview with the tsung li yamen on
the following day. No reply being re
ceived on the evening of the 20th, the
German minister, Baron voit Ketteler,
set out for the yamen to obtain a re
sponse, and on the way was murdered.
An attempt to recover his body was
foiled by tiie Chinese." The manner of
the defense of the British legation,
where the foreigners gathered, is then
described. The way the forces reached
the capital and saved the legations is
graphically set forth. The president says
the powers agree that the Celestial em
pire shall not be dismembered, and in
sists that the question of indemnity is
cm important matter.
The message discusses our relation
ships with other foreign countries, and
Jays special stress on the importance of
the Paris exposition.
The president condemns lynching In
the United States.
"It i's gratifying to be able to state
that the surplus revenues for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1900, were 579,527,
060.18," say's the report. Recommenda
tion's are made by the president for var
ions improvements and special attention
Is-given to the shipping trade.
This Is said on trusts:
''In imy last annual message to the con
gress I called attention -to the necessity
for early action to remedy such evils as
might be found to exist in connection
with combinations of capital organized

MANY NATIVES TAKE OATHS
OVER TWO THOUSAND FILIPINOS CROWD INTO CHURCH AND
SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO UNITED STATES.
Manila, Dec. 3.—Sunday In Vigan was
e great day for the American cause.
Twenty-two hundred natives of the re
gion nearly all fighting rebels, crowded
the church and took the oath of alle
giance to the United States. The oath
was administered by the priset. Ail but
tOO of those who were sworn were bolo
men. The number included 1,200 bolo
men who had previously surrendered.
The proceedings in the church occu
-(-j «ho entire 4»». and included an ad
my recommendation at that time which
concludes: 'It is apparent that uniformi
ty of legislation uipon this subject in the
several states is much to be desired. It
is to be honed that such uniformity in
a wise an'd just discrimination between
what is injurious and what is useful and
ne'censary in business operation's may be
obtained and that means be found for the
congress within the limitations of its i
constitutional power to supplement an
effective code of state legislation and
make a complete system of laws through
out the United States adequate to com
pel general observance of salary rules
to which I have referred.' The question
is so Important that 1 am sure no part
of it .will be lightly considered but every
phase 'Will have the deliberation of con
gress resûlting in wise and judicious ac
tion. Restraint upon such combinations
as are injurious and which are within
jurisdiction should be promptly applied
by the congress.
"In my last message I dwelt at some
length on the condition of affairs in the
Philippines. While seeking to Impress
upon you that grave responsibility for
the future government of those islands
rests with congress, I abstained from
recommending at that time a specific
and final form of government for the
territory actually held by the United ;
States forces and in which, as long as i
insurrection continues, the military arm |
must necessarily be supreme. I stated
my purpose, until the congress shall j
have made known the formal expression
of 'its will, to use the authority vested In .
me toy the constitution to uphold the !
S'overeigny of the Un led States in hose j
distant islands as in all other iplaces
whe-re our flag rightfully floats, placing
to that end at the disposal of the army
all means of the liberality of congress
having (been made, 1 ha.e steadfastly
pursued the policy of employing the civil
arm as well as the military toward the !
accomplishment of pacification and for j
the institution of local governments I
w'ith-in the lines of authority and law. I
Progress in the hoped for direction !
has been favorable. Our forces have
successfully controlled the greater part i
of tiie island, overcoming the organized !
forces of the insurgents and carrying
order and administrative regularity to i
all quarters. What opposition remains i
is for the most part scattered obeying ;
no concerted plan of strategic action,
operating only by the methods common j
to the traditions of guerilla warfare,
which, while ineffective to alter the gen- ;
eral control now established are still i
sufficient to beget insecurity among the
populations that have felt good results
of our influence and thus delay the con- I
ferment upon them of the fuller meas
ures of local self government, of educa
tion and of industriaal and agricultural
development which we stand ready to
give to them.
By the spring of this year the ef
fective opposition of the dissatisfied
Tagals was virtually ended thus opening
the door for the extension of a stable
administration over much of the terri
tory of the archipelago. Desiring to
bring this about I appointed in March
last a civil commssion composed of the
Hon W. H. Taft of Ohio, Prof. Dean !
C. Worcester of Michigan, Hon. Luke
E. Wright, of Tennessee, Hon. Henry
C. Ide of Vermont and Prof. Bernard
Moses of California.
The aims of their mission and the
scope of their authority are clearly set
firth in instructions of Apr 1 7, 1900, ad
dressed to the secretary of war to be
transmitted to them.
In the message to congress on Dec. 5,
1899, I said speaking of the Philippine
Islands: "As long as the insurrection
continues the military arm must nec
essarily be supreme. But there is no
reason why steps should not be taken
from time to time to inauguraate gov
ernments essentially popular in their
form. To this end I am con
sidering the advisability of the
return of the commissio nor such of the
i
j

I
dress by General Young and an exhorta
tion by the priest. Scarcely and rebels
remain in the vicinity of Santa Maria.
General Young attributes this fact to
three causes, the re-election of President
McKinley, the arrival of a stronger body
of troops tnd the especially rigid enforce
ment of war measures and the deporta
tion of prisoners to Manila. He reports
that it is necesary to occupy all the bar
racks in order to protect the natives
from the vengeance of the Tagalo raid
ers.

'I he Philippine question is discussed at
length and the other islands are given
• iue consideration. This is said about
the army:
"It must be apparent that we will re
quire an army of about 60,000 and that
during present conditions in Cuba and
the Philippines the president should
have authority to increase the forces to
the present number of 100,000. Includ
ed in this number, authority should be
given to raise native troops in tiie Phil
ippines up to 15,000, which the Taft com-
mission believe will be more effective in
suppressing guerillas, assassins and la
drones than our own soldiers.
The full discussion of this subject by
the secretary of war in his annual re
j port is called to your earnest attention."
The message concludes in this way:
"In our great prosperity we must
guard aguinst the dangers it invites in
extravagance in government expendit
ures and appropriations and the chosen
representatives of the people will, I
doubt not, furnish an example in their
legislation of that wise economy which
in a season of plenty, husbands for the
future. In this era of great business ac
tivity and opportunity caution is not un
timely. It will not abate but sterngthen
our confidence. It will not retard, but
promote legitimate industrial and com
mercial expansion. Our growing power
brings with it temptations and perils
requiring constant vigilance to avoid,
i H must not be used to invite conflicts,
j nor for oppression, but for the more
i effective maintenance of those princi
ples of equality and justice upon
I which our institutions and happiness de
| pend. Let us keep always in mind that
I *be foundation of our government is lib
erty; its superstructure peace.

BISHOP FËÈhTn
IS TO RETIRE
HEAD OF THE CHICAGO ARCH
DIOCE WILL GIVE UP AC
TIVE MANAGEMENT.
Chicago, Dec. 3.—The Tribune says:
The Most Rev. Patrick Feehan, arch
bishop of the Roman Catholic dioctse
of Chicago since Se-ptemtoer 10, 1S80, will
retire from the active management of his
office with the close of the present year.
Early in January a coadjutor bishop,
with the right of station, will be conse
crated, and will relieve the 'present in
cumbent of the burden of his ecclesias
tical duties. It is expressed as true that
the Rev. Father P. J. Muldoon Is the
priest upon whom the new honor will bo
bestowed.
Archbishop Feehan is 71 years old, and
while in general health, considering his
age, is not able alone to conduct the ec
clesiastical business affairs of the large
archdiocese in his care. In recognition of
this condition, the Rev. Father McGavick
was made auxiliary bishop without the
right of succession.
Ill health impaired the new prelate's
usefulness and finding that satisfactory
relief was not in sight, he resigned last
May and his resignation was accepted
by the pope. It was then decided to ap
point a coadjutor ;bisho.p. The selection
was made. The appointment is in the
hands of Archbishop Feehan now. Fath
er (Muldoon, the credited appointee, will
return from Europe about December 21,
and after the elaborate services inci
dent to the Christmas season are over,
the new coadjutor will be consecrated.
The date will lie between January 1 and '
15.
Andrew J. Ryan, counsel for the arch
diocese, last night declined to state
whether the generally accepted belief
that Father Muldoon had been appointed
coadjutor bishop is true.
SAMUEL LAWSON KILLED.
Other Fatalities in Alaska are Made
Public.
Tacoma, Wash., Dec. 3.—Advices from

Wales, by the accidental discharge of 1rs

2$, by George St. Cyr, who went to Daw
son and gave himself up. The mangled
and dismembered (body of Jno. Atcheson
was found at Kirkman. lOf^niles above

froze to death, and dogs or wild animals i
mangled his remains. Générai Randall I

SUGAR EXPORTS MAY INCREASE.
Act' .in of Foreign Countries Is Con
sidered Important.
* N "• York, Dec. 3.—The news that
Fra: e, Germany and Austria have
reached a tentative agreement for aban
doning the export bounty on sugar is
attracting quite a little attention at the
moment in local sugar circles, and some
what diverse theories are current re
gai .ng the effect of such a Change, if
ma* ' in refiners' supplies here. There
seer,is a general agreement, however,
that a very important effect would be
an immediate and large increase in the
exports of American preserved fruits an 1
jellies at the expense of the business of
the great English and Scotch preservers.
The ( ffect of the removal of the boun
ties would also, it is argued, be to in
crease the competition and restrict pro
duction of sugars in the continental
countries.

the 56th congress adjourned and the sec
'ond session began today with many mo
mentous questions awaiting the atten
tion of the national law makers.
Early in the day the tide of travel
turned down Pennsylania avenue to
ward the capitol, filling the broad walks
leading to the marble terrace. On the
eastern plaza front there was a great
scene of activity, tong lines of carriages
swinging up to the wings, bringinng sen
ators, members, public officials and in
terested observers, while the many lints
of cars carried their quota of the inter
ested public.
Inside the building but little restriction
had been placed on the free moving of
the throng and the crowd moved at will
from one wing to the other. All of the
galleries were opened so that everyone
in the good natured crowds had an equal
chance. By 11 o'clock the elevators be
gan to be besieged and there were signs
of an overflow at the gallery doors. It
was evident that the ladies took great
interest in the proceedings for they were
present in full force, one delegation of
girl students numbering over fifty. There
were conferences among senators as to
the programme for the week and for so
early in the session, ususual activity was
displayed by members on both sides of
the house.
Speaker Henderson arrived at his pri
vate office at 1:15 and was soon surround
ed by members, discussing the pro
gramme of business. On the senate side
there was less evidence of activity and
the crowds were rather slow in invad
ing the galleries. President pro tern Frye
was engaged with his colleagues long be
fore the opening hour.
