THE MAN FROM MAINE ELECTE»

the First Days Business Cuuflned to the
Election and Drawing Seats—Bat Little
Will Be Done in Either House TiU
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.— The first week
of the Fifty-fourth congress promises
nothing at either end of the Capitol in
the way of actual legislation. The time
before the Christmas holidays is usually
devoted to preliminary matters and the
work of fhe session does not begin until
after the reces3. The new congress will
probably not be an exception to this
rule. The senate proceedings may be
enlivened by an attempt at reorganiza
tion but in the house nothing can be
done until tho committees are appointed.
Speaker Reed Bays that tho committees
will not be announced this week with,
THOMAS B. REED.
[Speaker of the honse.]
perhaps, a single exception—the com
mittee on rules. This committee "for
mulates the rules which are to govern
the house during its session and it is
customary for the speaker to name it
during the first week in order that it
can immediately begin its labors. While
it is believed that the rules of the
Fifty-first congress over which Mr.
Reel presided will be reported for the
gu:c ance of the present house, it is un
derstood that a few changes will be
made as a result of the experience
which are to still further
Improve the House Machinery
and the facilitation of public business,
Mr. Kerr, clerk of the last house, called
the house to order. After the roll call
the election of the officers-nominated by
the Republican caucus occurred, and as
soon as Mr. Reed was formally installed
as speaker the drawing of seats, which
is known as the congressional "raffle,"
followed. This was a somewhat tedi
ous but amusing affair and occupied the
remainder of the afternoon. The read
ing of the president's message will con
sume Tuesday, and at its conclusion
tho house will probably adjourn until
Thursday, and on convening Thursday
adjourn immediately until Monday.
These adjournments will continue prob
ably until the committees are an
nounced. This is the programme, but
the unexpected might occur,' as it so
often does in the house, if some aspir
ing member should introduce a sensa
tional resolution and ask for its imme
diate consideration.
Programme in the Senate.
It is not probable that the first week
of congress will witness much serious
effort at legislative work in the senate.
The message will be read on Tuesday,
and the brief sessions of Wednesday
and Thursday will be devoted largely to
the introduction of bills of which there
will be several hundred. Following'
precedents, the senate will on Thursday
until the following Monday. One or
two brief executive sessions for the ref
erence of nominations are also among
the probabilities for the week.
If tho the Republicans decide upon an
effort to reorganize as is now generally
conceded the Democrats will follow a
conference at which they probably will
decide upon a course of action. It now
appears probable that all three parties
will place candidates forpresident pro
tem in the field and in that event the
week will be enlivened somewhat by a
triangular contest for this and the
other offices of the senate.
