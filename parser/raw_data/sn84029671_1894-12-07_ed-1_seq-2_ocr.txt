CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE.
The President's Annual Review of
National Affairs.
Oar Foreign Relations, the Treasury and
Other Departments of Government
Commented Upon The Issoo
of New Bonds.
Washixgtox, Dec 3. Following is
President Cleveland s message to the
second session of the Fifty-third con
gress:
To the Congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's legisla
tive halls of those charped with the duty cf
making laws for the benefit of a generous and
free people impressively suggests the exacting
obligation and inexorable responsibility in
volved in their task. At the threshold of such
labor now to be undertaken by the congress of
the united States, and in the discharge of an
executive duty enjoined by the constitution. I
submit this communication, containing a brief
statement of the condition of our national af
fairs and recommending such legislation as
seems to me necessary and expedient.
Our Foreign Relations.
The history of our recent dealings with other
nations and our peaceful relations with them
at this time additionally demonstrated the ad
vantage of consistently adhering to a Arm but
Just foreign policy, free from envious or am
bitious national schemes and characterized by
entire honesty ana sincerity.
I have? endeavored to impress upon the Bel'
glan government the neediessness and positive
harmtulness of its restrictions upoa the im
portation of certain of our food products and
have strongly urged that the rigid supervision
and Inspection under our liws are amply suf
ficient to prevent the deportation from this
country of diseased cattle and unwholsome
meat.
On the 17th of March last a new treaty with
China in further regulation of emigration was
signed at Washington and on August 13 it re
ceived the sanction of the senate.
Kiirly in the present year an agreement was
reached with Great Britain concerning instruc
tions to bo given to the n.nv:il commanders of
the two governments in Uthriug sea and the
contiguous North Pacific ocen for their guid
ance in the execution of the award of the Paris
tribunal of ar'oitratian and the enforcement of
the regulations therein prescribe J for the pro
tection of seal life in the waters mentioned.
Since communicating the voluminous corre
spondence in reg.ird to Hawaii and the action
ti;keu by the senate and house of representa
tives on certain questions submitted to the
judgment and wider discretion of congress the
organization of a government in pia.-e of the
provisional arrangement which followed the
dep3Kitioa of tho queen has been announced
with evidence of its effective operation. The
. recognition usual in such cases has been ac
corded the new government.
Apart from the war in which the island em
pire is engagaJ. Japin attracts increasing at
tention in this country by her evident desire
to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us
and to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her
laudable desire for complete autonomy in her
domestic affairs and full equality in the family
of nations. The Japanese empire of to-day is
no longer tho Japan of the past and our rela
tions with this progressive nation should not
bo loss broad and liberal than those with other
in common, has marked our relations with our
nearest southern neighbor.
Peace beln-; restored along her northern fron
tier, Mexico has asked tho punishment of the
late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought
to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation
with that country to take the place of the one
which terminated thirteen years ago.
The recent death of the ez'ir of Russia called
forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on the part of our government with
his bereaved family and the Russian people.
As a further demonstration of respect and
friendship our minister at Si. Petersburg was
directed to represent our government at the
funeral ceremonies. The sealing interests of
Russia in the Behriug sea arc second only to
our own. A modus Vivendi has therefore been
.concluded with the imperial government re
strictive of poaching on Russian rookeries and
of scaling in waters which were not compre
hended in the protected area defined in the
Pur is award.
Treasary Statement.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the treasury from all sources of
revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1P94, amounted to $37J.3 r'. isy.-jj and its expend
itures to S4.505,7.8.S7, leaving a Ueiicit of $69.
803.26J.58. There wns a decrease of $13.il.V'.674.
69 in the ordinary expenses of the government,
as compared with the llscal year 1J:1. There
was collected from customs $!3l.sis, 53162. and
from internal revenue $H7.1il.4W.so. The bal
ance of the income for tho year, amounting to
$s3,81S,S17.97. was derived from tho sales of
tal dutiable imports amounted to S27j.rja,08C.
feeing M6.6S7,C2o less than during tho preced

amounted to $37u.7).V:!0. being s6t.7-lR.67.j less
than during the preceding year. The receipts
from customs were Sr.l.ri3(1.4S!J. 11 less and from
internal revenuo 13.833.";t ! yr less than in 1893.
The total tax collected from distilled spirits
was tH5.-J39.-2 0.25, on manufactured tobacco,
$28,617,8U!i62, and on fermented liquors, 31,4M,
788.04. Our exports of merchant! ise. domestic and
foreign, amounted during the year to tx-JJ.Hu.-
of $I4.4'.5.378. The total amouut of gold ex
ported during the fiscal year was tTJ.P.tt.OOl. as
against J108.680.444 during the llscal year 1893.
The amount imported was 72.4!Sl.ll!.as against
$21,174,381 during the previous year. The im
ports of silver were $13.28 j."2. and the exports
were $50,451,265. The total bounty paid upon
tho production of sugar in the United States
for the llscal year was $:2.10J.2X.89. being an
increase of $2,725,078.01 over tho payments
made during the preceding year. The amount
of bounty paid from July 1. 1.M, to August 23.
1894, the time when further p.ivments ceased
by operation of law, was SXkI.I3.V84. The total
expenses incurred in the payment of tho
bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year was
$130.140.8.). It is estimated th-it upon the basis
of the present revenue laws the receipts of tho
government during tho current liscal year
endiug June 30, 189"., will bo J424.427.748. 44.
and its expenditures $444,427,748.44, resulting
in a deficit of $J9,0O3.'i;)O. The first day of No-
vembcr, 1894, the total stock of money of all
kinds in the country was f2.24'J.773.8$8. as
against $2,204,651,000 on the first day of Novem
ber, 1893. and the money of all kinds in
circulation or not included In the treasury
holdings was $1,672,093,422. or K4.27 per capita
upon an estimated population of 68.887.000. At
the same date there was held in the treasury
gold bullion amounting to $44,615,107.55 and sil
ver bullion which was purchased at a cost of
$127,779,988. The purchase of silver bullion un
der the act of July 14. l&sM. ceased on the first
day of November, 1893. and up to that time
there had been purchased during the fiscal
year 11.917,058.78 fine ounces ut a cost of $S.71",
621.32. an average cost of $0.7313 per tine ounce.
The total amount of silver purchased from the
time that law took effecr. until the repeal of its
purchasing clause on the date last mentioned
was lfi.6?4.682.53 line ounces, which cost $155.
031,032.25. tho average price per ounce being
$.9:44. The total amount of standard silver
dollars coined at the mints, of the United
States since the passage of the act of February
28, I8M. is $421,773,408. of which $178,161,793 were
coined under the provisions of that act, $33.
631 ,143 under the provisions of the act of July
14. 1890, and $5,078,478 under the oct providing
for the coinage of trade dollar bullion: the to
tal coinage of all metals at our mints during
the last fiscal year consisted of 63,485.220
pieces, valued at $106 216.73J.03. of which
there was $99,474,912.50 in gold coined.
$758 in standard silver dollars-. $'3,024,140.30 in
subsidiary coin srnd $716,919.26 in minor coin.
During the calecdar year 1893 the production of
precious metals in the United States was es

commercial tod coinage value of $35,9.3.000 and
CO.OOJ.tW fine ounce:- of silver of the bullion or
market value of f4S.800.000 and of the coinage
valifc of $77,576,000. It is estimated that on the
first day of July, 1894. the stack of metallic
money in the United States, consisting of coin
and bullion, amounted to $1,251.00.93. of
which $627,923,201 was cold aad $321,347,758 was

- Fifty national banks were organized during
the year ended October 31. 1894. with a capital
of $5,286,000, and seventy-nine, with a capital of
$10,475,000. went into voluatary liquidation.
Twenty-one banks, with a capital of tJ.77J.000,

tal number of national banks in existence on
the Stst of October last was 3.753, being 40 less
thanonthe3litdy of October. 1893. The cap
ital stock paii t was $872,671,36 , being .6T8,
491 less than it the same time in the previous
year, and the ai-rplus and undivided profits,
jless expenses tfnd taxes paid, amounted to
1(314,121,083.10, wh'ch was $16,039-780 less than
Ion October SI. 1863.
The circulation has decreased tl.74I.StB. The

counts were $111,205.93 more than at the same
time the previous yeir. and checks and other
cash items were $J0.319.'J61more- The total re
sources of the banks at the date mentioned
amounted to $3,473,922,0 u, as against $3,10J,-
663,284.38 in 1893.
Army A fTalrs.
From the report of the secretary of war it
appears that the strength of the army on Sep
tember 30, 1894. was 2.13 officers and 25.765 en
listed men. Although this is apparently a very
slight decrease compared with the previous
year, the actual effective force has been in
creased to the equivalent of nearly two regi
ments, through the reorganization of the sys
tem of recruiting and the consequent release
to regimental duty of tha large force of men
hitherto serving at the recruiting departments.
The abolition of these departments, it is pre
dicted, will furthermore effect an annual re
duction approximating $250,000 in the direct
expenditures, besides promoting generally the
health, morals and discipline of the troops.
The execution of the policy of concentrating
the army at important centers of popu
lation and transportation, foreshadowed
in the last annual report of the secre
tary, has resulted in the abandonment
of fifteen of the smaller posts, which was ef
fected under a plan which assembles organiza
tions of the same regiments hitherto widely
separated. This renders our small forces more
readily eCectl ve for any service which they may
be called upon to perform in cases over the ex
tent of territory under protection vrithous
diminishing the security heretofore afforded to
any locality; improves the discipline, trainin
and esprit de corps of the army, besides consid
erably decreasing the cost of its maintenance.
Though the force of the department has been
somewhat increased, more than three-fourths
of tho army is still stationed west of the Mis
sissippi. This carefully matured policy which
secures the best and greatest service in the in
terests of tho general welfare from the small
force comprising our regular army should not
be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation
of new and unnecessary costs through acts of
congress to gratify the ambitions or interests
of localities. While the maximum legal
strength of the army is 25.00J men the effective
strength, through various causes, is but little
over 20,009 men. The purpose of congress does
not, therefore, seem to be fully attained by the
existing condition. whi:e no considerable in
crease in the army is in my judgment demand-
d by recent events.
The policy of sea coast fortifications in pros
ecution of which we have been steadily engaged
for some years past has so far developed as to
suggest that the effective strength of the army
be now made at least equal to the legal strength.
Measures taken by the department during the
year, as indicated, have already augmented the
effective force, and the secretary of war pre
sents a plan, which I recommend to the consid
eration of congress, to attain the aesircd end.
The total expenditures for the war depart
ment for the year ending June 8). 1894.
amounted to 5S5ij.O39.O09.31. Of this sum $:..-
614.99 was for salaries and contingent expen
ses: $J3.l5!V156.1;i for the support of the military
establishment: S5.ooi.68'.23 for miscellaneous
objects, and $25,371. 555.WJ for public works.
This latter sum includes $19,194,037.49 for river
and harbor improvements and $3,947,863.56 for
fortifications and other works of defense.
Tho appropriations for the current year ag
gregate $:.429.1 12.78. and the estimates sub
mitted by the secretary of war for the next lis
cal year call for apDropriations amounting to
$52,318,529.55.
The skill and industry of our ordnance offi
cers and inventors have, it is believed, over
come tho mechanical obstacles which have
heretofore delayed the armament of our coasts,
and this great national undertaking upon which
we have entered may now proceed as rapidly
as congress shall determine, with a supply of
finished guns of large caliber already on band
to which additions should now rapidly follow.
The Department of Justice.
The report of the attorney-general notes the
gratifying progress made by the supreme court
in overcoming the arrears of its business and
in reaching a condition in which it will be able
to dispose of cases as they arise without any
unreasonable delay. This result is of course
very largely due to the successful working of
the plan Inaugurating circuit courts of appeals.
In respect to these tribunals the suggestion Is
made In quarters entitled to the highest con
sideration that an additional circuit judge for
each circuit would greatly strengthen
these courts and the conlidence
reposed in their adjuiicatioa. and
that such an addition would not create a
greater forca of julgss thm tho increasing
business of such courts requires. The perma
nent solution of what is called the Indian prob- I
lem is probably not to bo expected at once, but '
meanwhile such ameliorations of present con- I
ditions as the existing system will admit ought
not to be neglected. 1 am satisfied there should
be a federal court established for the territory
nth sulllcient judges and that this court should
sit within the territory and have the same jur
isdiction as to territorial affairs as is now
vested in the federal courts sitting in Arkansas
nud Texas.
Another subject of pressing moment referred
to by tho attorney-general is the reorganiza
tion of the Union Pacific Railroad Co. on
a basis equitable as regards all private inter
ests and as favorable to the government as ex
isting conditions will permit. The operation
of a railroad by a court through a receiver is
an anomalous state of things which should be
terminated on all grounds, public and private,
at the earliest possible moment.
Post Office Affairs.
The report o? the postmaster-general pre
sents a comprehensive statement of the op 'ra
tions of the post office department for the last
fiscal year. The receipts of the department
during the year amounted to $75,031,479.01 and
the expenditures of S84.3M.41 1.15. The trans
actions of tho postal service indicate with
barometric certainty the fluctuations in busi
nesses of the country. Inasmuch, therefore, as
business complications continued to exist
the last year to an unforeseen extent it is
not surprising that the deficiency of revenues
to meet tho expenditures of the post o:Mce
department, which was estimated in advance
at about $8,099,09). snould bo exceeded by
nearly $1.250.00J. The ascertained revenues of
the last year, which were the basis of calcula
tion for the current year, being less than esti
mated, the deliclency for tho current year will
be correspondingly greater, though the postmaster-general
states that tho latest indica
tions arc so favorable that he confidently pre
dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent, in the
revenues of tho current year over those of the
last year. Tho expenditures Increase steadily
and necessarily with the growth and
Ss of tho country, so that the defi
ciency Is greater or less in any year
uepenaing upon tne volume of receipts. The
postmaster-general states that this deficiency
Is unnecessary and might be obviated at once
if the laws regulating rates upon mail matter
of the second class was modified. The rate re
ceived for the transmission of this second-class
matter is 1 cent per pound, while the cost of
such transportation to the government is eight
times that amount. In the general terms pf
the law this rate covers newspapers and peri
odicals. The extensions of the meaning of
tneso terms from time to time have admitted
to the privileges intended for legitimate news
papers and, periodicals a surprising range of
publication, and created abuses the cost of
which amounts in the aggregate to the total
deficiency of the post otTlce department. Pre
tended newspapers are started by business
houses for the purpose of advertising goods.
complying with the law in form only, and dis
continuing the publications as soon as the pe
riod or advertising is over. Another abuse con
sists In the free carriage through the malls of
hundreds of tons of seed and grain, uselessly
distributed through the department of
agriculture. The postmaster-general pre
dicts that if the law is so amended
as to eradicate these abuses, not only will
the post office department show no deficiency.
but he believes that in the near future all
legitimate newspapers, periodicals and maga
zines might be properly transmitted through
the mails to their subscribers free of cost. I
invite your prompt consideration of this sub
ject and fully indorse the views of the postmaster-general.
The total number of post offices
in the United States on the 30th day of June.
1894. was 69,8u, an increase of 1.403 over the
preceding year: of these 3.428 were presiden
tial, an increase of sixty-eight over the preced
ing year. Six hundred and tea cities and towns
are provided with free delivery, ninety-three
other cities and towns entitled to this service
under the law have not been accorded it on ac
count of insufficient funds. The expense of
free delivery for the current fiscal year will be
more than $12,300,000, and under existing legis
lation this item of expenditure is subject to
constant increase. The estimated cost of rural
free delivery generally is so very large that It
ought not to be considered in the present con
dition of affairs. During the year 830 addi
tional domestio money order offices were es
tablished. The total number of these offices
at the close of the year was 1964. There were
14.304.041 money orders issued during the year,
being an increase over the preceding Tear of
994.306. The value of these ordes amounted
to 1S8,733,57.4B. an increase of $11,317,245.84.
There were also issued during the year postal
notes amounting to $12,646,004.95. During the
year 218 international money order offices were
added to those already established, making a
total of 1.825 such offices in operation June 30.
1894. ViM number of International money or-
I den issued during the year was 917.828. a de
; crease in number of 133.173, and their value
was $13,792,455.31. a decrease in amount of $2.
849.332.9 -. The number of orders paid was 33.1.-
180. an increase over the preceding year of 60.
263, and their value was $6,563,493.73. an in
crease of $11,285,118.05. From the foregoing
statements it appears that the total issue of
money orders and postal notes for the year
amounted to $16.23.129.3. The number of let
ters and packages mailed during the year for
special delivery was 3.436.970. The special de
livery stamps used upon these letters and
packages amounted to $313,657. The messen
gers fees paid for their delivery amounted to
$261,206.70. leaving a balance in favor of the
government of 48J.4.S7.3). The report shows
most gratifying results in the way of economies
in the cost and amount of supplies used in the
service, amounting in all to $16,619,017.42.
Oar 3vy.
Attention Is called to. the report of the sec
tary of the navy.- which shows very gratifying
progress m the construction of ships for our
navy. All the vessels now building, including
the three torpedo boat s authorized at the last
session of congress, and excepting tho first-
class battleship Iowa, will probably be com
pleted during the coming fiscal year. The es
timates for the increase of tho navy for the
year ending June 3). I89i. are large, but they
include practically the entire sum necessary to
complete and equip all the new ships now in
commission: so that, unless new ships are au
thorized, the appropriation for the naval serv
ice for the fiscal year ending June 3J, 1897,
should fall below the estimates for the coming
year by at least $12.00 J.09J.
The secretary presents with much earnest
ness a plea for tho authorization of three ad
ditional battleships and twelve torpedo boats.
If we are to have a navy for warlike opsrations.
offensive and defensive, we certainly ought to
Increase both the number of battleships and
torpedo boats.
The Interior Department.
The report of the secretary of the interior
exhibits tho situation of the numerous and in
teresting branches of the public service con
nected with his depnrtment. I recommend this
report and the valuable recommendations of
the secretary to careful attention of congress.
The public land disposed of during the
year amounted to 10.4"O.10J.77 ; acres,
including iiSsr.fiOi of Indian lands.
I: is estimated that the public domain still re
maining amounts to a little more than 603.00J.-
09J acres, excluding, however, about 360.0J9.00)
acres in Alaska as well as military reservations
and railroad and otaer selections of lands un
adjudicatcd. .
An exceedingly important recommendation
of the secretary relates to the manner in which
contests and litigated cases growing out of ef
forts to obtain government land are de
termined. I concur in the opinion that the
commissioner of the general land otltce should
be relieved of this duty of deciding litigated
land cases: that a non-partisan court should be
created to pass on such cases and that decis
ions of this court should be final, at least so far
as the decisions of the department are final.
At tho close of the last fiscal veor. on the
39th day of June. 1391. there werj 1W9.5! J per
sons on the pension rolls, being a net increase
of 3.53: over the number reported at tho end
of the provious year. These pensioners may
be classified as f illows: Soldiers and sailors.
survivors of all wars. 753.568: widows and rela
tives of deceased soldiers. 215,15;: army nurses
in war of the rebellion. 4:4. Of these pension
ers. 32.039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and
other wars prior to the late civil war and
the widows and relatives of such soldiers.
Tho remainder, numbering 937.505. are re
ceiving pensions on account of tho war of the
rebellion, and of these 459,344 are on the rolls
under the authority of the act of June 27. 1X93,
sometimes called the dependent pension law.
The total amouut expended for pensions dur
ing the year was l:!9.8 H.4S1. 05, leaving an un
expected balance from the sum appropriated
of $25,205,712.65. The sum necessary to meet
pension expenditures for the year ending June
30. 189:1, is estimated at $14.0M.0) ). The
commissioner of pensions is of tho opinion
thai '-io year 1895 being tho thirtieth
after far; closo of tho war of the rebellion
must, according to sensible human calculation,
see the highest limit of the pension roll, and
that after that year it must begin to decline.
The claims nending in the bureau have de
creased to more than 9.090 duricg the year. A
large proportion of the new claims tiled are for
increase of pension by those now on the rolls.
The number of certificates issued was 80,213.
The names dropped from the rolls for all
causes during the year numbered 37.951. Among
our pensioners are nine widows aad three
daughters of soldiers of the revolution, and
forty-five survivors of the war of 1812.
Agricultural Matters.
The secretary of agriculture in his report re
views the operations of his department
for the last llscal year, and makes recommen
dations for tho further extension of its use
fulness. He reports a saving in expenditures
during the year of $j0J,0J'J. which is covered
back into the treasury. This sum is 23 per
cent, of the entire appropriation, as special
study has been made of the demand for Amer
ican farm products in all foreign markets, es
pecially in ("rent Britain.
That country received from the United States
during the nine months ending September 30,
1SU4. .wvjoi live beef cittle, valued at $2(5.500,-
090 as against 182.611 cattle, valued at f 16.634.
00 J during the same period for 1893. During
tho first six months of 1894 the United King
dom took also 112.00J.0W pounds of dressed
beef from tho United States valued at nearly
$10.0JO.OOl.
The report shows that during the nine months
immediately preceding September 30.1894. the
United States exported to Crent Britain 222.-
fl.'O.OJO pounds of pork, of apples 1.9,'JO0
bushels, valued at f2.50J.oio and of
horses 2.811 at an average value of
$139 per head. There was a falling off in Amer
ican wheat exports of 13.500,o:0 bushels and the
secretary is inclined to believe that wheat may
not in the future be tho staple export cereal
product of our country, but that corn will con
tinue to advance in importance as an export on
account of tho new uses to which it is con
stantly being appropriated. The exports of
agricultural products from the United States
for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1894, amount
ed to $628,361,058. being 72.28 per cent, of Amer
ican exports of every description, and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain took more
than 54 per cent, of all farm products finding
foreign markets.
The secretary of agriculture recommends
that the law providing for tho microscopical
inspection or export and interstate meat be so
amended as to compel owners of the meat in
spected to pay the cost of such inspection and
I call attention to the arguments presented in
nis report in support of this recommendation.
The live beef cattle exported and tagged dur
ing the year numbered 363,535. This is an in
crease of 69,533 head over the previous year?
The Civil Service.
The advantages to the public service of an
adherence to tho principles of civil service re
form arc constantly more apparent and noth
ing is so encouraging to those in official life
who honestly desire good government as the in
creasing appreciation by our people of these
advantages, a vast majority of the voters of
the land are ready to insist that the time and
the attention of those they select to perform for
them important public duties, should not be
distributed by doling out minor offices and
they are growing to be unanimous in regarding
party organization as something that should
be used in establishing party principles instead
of dictating the distribution of public places as
rewards of partisan activity. Numerous addi
tional offices and places have lately been
brought within civil service rules and regula
tions, and some others wiil probably be in
cluded. The report of the commissioners will
be submitted to the congress, and I invite care
ful attention to the recommendations it con
tains. A Board of Health.
I am entirely convinced that we ought not to
be longer without a national board of health
or national health officer charged with no other
duties than such as pertain to the protection of
our country from the invasion of pestileuce and
disease. This would involve the establish
ment by such board or officer of proper quaran
tine precautions of the necessary aid and coun
sel to locate authorities on the subject, prompt
advice and assistance to local boards of hea ,th
or health officers in the suppression of con
tagious disease and in cases where there are
no such local boards.
The Labor Commission.
By virtue of a statute of the United States.
passed in 1888, 1 appointed in July last Bon. J.
D. Keen, of the state of New York, and Hon.
Nicholas E. Worthlngton. of the state of Illi
nois, to form with Hon. Carroll D. Wright, com
missioner of labor, who was designated by said
statute a commission for the purpose of mak
ing careful inquiry into the causes of the con
troversies between certain railroads and their
employes which had resulted in an extensive
and destructive strike, accompanied by much
violence and dangerous disturbance with con
siderable loss of life and great destruction of
property. The report of the commissioners
has been submitted to me and will be trans
mitted to congress with the evidence taken
upon their investigation.
Tho Tariff.
The tariff act passed at the last session of
congress needs important amendments if it is
executed effectively and with certainty. In
addition to such necessary amendments as will
not change rates of duty, I am still vary da
cidedly in favor of putting coal and iron on tha
I free fist. Jso far as the sugar schedule is con
j cerned. I would be glad, under existing aggra-
Itiocs, to see every panicle of differen
tial duty in favor of refined sugar
stricken out of our tariff law.
I I earnestly repeat here the recommendation I
have made in another portion of this commu
nication, that the additional duty of one-tenth
of a cent per pound laid upon sugar imported
from foreign countries paying a bounty on its
export be abrogated. It seems to me that ex
ceedingly important considerations point to
the propriety of this amendment. With tha
advent of a new tariff policy not only contem
plated to relieve tho consumers of our land ia
the cost of their daily life, but to Invite a bet
ter development of American thrift, and create
foruscloserand mora profitable commercial re
lations with the rest of the world, it follows as a
logical and imperative necessity that we should
at once remove the chief, if not only, obstacle
which has long prevented our participation it
the foreign carrying trad3 of tho sex. The
ancient provision of our law denying American
registry to ships built abroad and owned by
Americans appears, in the light of present
conditions, not only to be a failure for good at
every point, but to be nearer a relic of barbar
ism than anything that exists under the per
mission of statute of the U nited States. I
earnestly recommend its prompt repeal.
The lionrt Issue.
During tho last month the gold reserves in
the treasury for the purpose of redeeming the
notes of the government circulating as money
in the hands of tho people became so reduced,
and its further depletion in the near future
seemed so certain, that in the exercise of
proper care for the public welfare it became
necessary to replenish this reserve and thus
maintain popular faith in the ability and de
termination of the government to meet, as
agreed, its pecuniary obligations. It would
have been well if in this emergency authority
had existed to isuuo the bonds of the gov
ernment bearing a low rato cf interest
and maturing within a special period,
but the con-Tress having failed to confer such
authority resort was necessarily had to the re
sumption act of lS7i. and pursuant to its pro
vision, bonds were issued drawing interest at
the rate of 5 per cent, per annum and maturing
ten years after their issuing, that being the
shortest time authorized by the act. I am glad
to say. however, that on the sale of these bonds
the premium received operated to reduce the
rate of interest to be paid b the government
to less than 3 per cent. Nothing could be worse
or farther removed from sensible finance than
tec relations existing between the currency
the government has issued, the gold hold
for its redemption and the means which
must be resorted to for the purpose of repien-
isning suca reuempuon tuna when impaired.
Even if the claims upon this fund wore con
fined to the obligations originally iutended,
and if the redemption of these obligations
meant their cancellation, the fund would be
very small. But these obligations when re
ceived and redeemed In gold are not cancelled.
but may be reissued and may do duty many
times by way of drawing goid from the treas
ury. Tuus we have an endless cht.in in opera
tion constantly depleting the treasury's gold
and never near a final rest- As if this was not
bad enough, we have by a statutory declara
tion that it is the policy of the government
to maintain the parity between gold and silver
aided the force and momentum of this exhaust
ing process and added largely to the currency
obligations claiming this peculiar gold redemp
tion, uur small gold reserve is thus subject to
draw from every side. The demands that in
crease our danger also increase the necessity of
protecting tnis reserve against depiction, and
it is most unsatisfactory to know that the pro
tection afforded is only a temporary aalliation.
It is perfectly and palpably plain that
the only way under present conditions by
which this reserve, when dangerously de
pleted, can be replenished is through
the issue and sale of th3 bonds of the
government for gold, and yes congress has not
only thus far declined to authorize tho issue of
bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there
seems a disposition in some quarters to deny
both the necessity and power for the issue of
bonds at all. I cannot for a moment believe
that any of our citizens are deliberately willing
that their government should default in its
pecuniary obligations, or that its financial
operations should be reduced to a silver basis.
At any rate I should not feel that my duty was
done if I omitted any effort I could
make to avert such a calamity. As long,
therefore, as no provision is made for the
final redemption or the putting aside of the
currency obligation now used to repeatedly
and constantly draw from the government its
gold, and as long as no better authority for
oonu issues is allowed than at present exists
such authority will be utilized whenever and
as oftcnis it becomes necessary to maintain a
sufficient gold reserve and in abundant time to
save the credit of our country and make good
the financial declarations of our government.
Questions relating to our bunks and currency
are closely connected with the subject referred
to: they present some unsatisfactory features.
Prominent among them are the lack of elasti
city in our currency circulation and its fre
quent concentration m financial centers when
it is most needed in other parts of tho country.
The absolute divorcament of the government
from the business of banking is the ideal rcla -tionship
of the government to the circulation
of the currency of the country. This condition
cannot be immediately reached but as a step in
that direction and as a means of securing a
more elastic currency and obviating other ob
jections to the present arrangement
of bank circulation the secretary of
the treasury presents his reported scheme
modifying present banking laws and
providing for the issue of circulating notes by
state banks free from taxation under ccrtnin
limitations. The secretary explains his plan
so plainly and Its advantages are developed by
him with such remarkable clearness that any
effort on my part to present arguments in its
support would be superfluous. I shall therefore
content myself with an unqualified indorse
ment of the secretary's proposed changes in
the law and a brief and imperfect statement of
their prominent features.
It Is proposed to repeal all liws providing
for the deposit of United States bonds as se
curity for circulation: to permit- national
banks to issue circulating notes not exceeding
in amount 75 per cent, of their paid up and un
impaired capital, provided they deposit with
the government as a g-.iarantee fund in United
States legal tender notes, including treasury
notes of 1899. a sum equal in nmount to 3) per
cent, of the notes they desire to issue, this de
posit to be maintained at all times, but when
over any bank retires any part of its circula
tion a proportional pert of its guaranteo
fund shall be returned to it: to per
mit the secretary of the treasury to
prepare and keep on hand ready, for issue in
case an increase in circulation is desired blank
national bank notes for each bank having cir
culation, aa.l to repeal the provision of the
present law imposing limitations and restric
tions upon banks desiring to reduce or increase
their circulation, thus permitting such increase
or reduction within thedimit cf 75 per cent, of
capital to be quickly made as emergency may
arise. In addition to the guarantee fund re
quired it is proposed to provide a safety fund
for the immediate redemption of the circulating
notes of failed banks by imposing a
small annual tax. say one-half
of 1 per cent upon the average circulation of
each bank until the fund amounts to 5 per cent
of the total circulation outstanding. When a
bank fails its guarantee fund is to be paid
into this safety fund and its notes are to be re
deemed in the first instance from such safety
fund thus augmented: any impairment of such
fund caused thereby to be made good from tho
imxediately available cash assets of said
bank, and if these should be insufficient such
impairment to be made good by prorata as
sessment among the other banks, their
contributions constituting a first lien
upon the assets of the failed bank in
favor of the contributing banks.
That each national bank, except in case of a
failed bank, shall redeem or retire its notes in
the first instance at its own office or at agencies
to be designated by it. that no fixed reserve
used be maintained on account of deposits.
Another very important feature of this plan is
the exemption of state banks from taxation by
the United States in cases where it is shown
to the satisfaction of th secretary of the treas
ury and comptrolle r of the currency by iaks
claiming such exemption that they aave
not had outstanding their circ.ilatlng
notes exceeding 75 per cent. of
their paid up and unimpaired capital:
that their stockholders are individually liable
for the redemption of their circulating notes to
the full extent of the ownership of stock: that
the liability ol such banks upon their circulat
ing notes constitutes under their state law a
first lien upon their assets: that such banks
have kept and maintained a guarantee fund in
United States legal tender notes, including
treasury notes of 1890 equal to 30 per cent, of
their outstanding circulating notes and that
such banks have promptly redeemed their cir
culating notes when presented at their princi
pal or branch office.
I conclude this rommunicatioat. fu-lr appre
ciating that the responsibility lor legislation
affecting the people of the United States rests
upon their representatives in tfce congress and
assuring them that whether accordance with
recommendations I have male or not. I shall
be glad to co-operate in perfecting anv legis
lation that tends to the prosperity and welfar
of oar people.

CURRENCY REFORM.
Cccrstary Carlisle Sends ttu An

PLAj FOR A OT BA5KIXG SYSTEM.
The Condition of the National Finance.
Total Estimated Kxpcnditnre and
Revenue for th? Current
Fiscal Year.
TVAsmxr.Tox. Djc. H. The annual
report of tho secretary of the treasury
ca ths state of the finances of the na
tion was sent to congress yesterday.
The most important feature of Mr. Car
lisle's report is his du;cnssion of the
subject of currency reform, in the
course of which tho administration's
plans of a new system of currency are
set forth in detail.
The secretary revietvs the circum
stances leading up to the first S.0.030.
000 issue of bonds as a means of re
plenishing the jrold reserve, vieldi
S"'S,Gi!,'.i7. and increasing the free jrold
in the treasury to 107.44'i.so:.'. The'
lowest point reached by the reserve
since the redemption of specie pay
ments was on the 7th day of Ausrust,
1SD4. when, by reason of withdrawals
in the redemption of notes, it was re
duced to ?.".. l$'..r0.i. After that it was
slowly replenished by voluntary ex
changes of g-old coin for l"n:ted States
notes by the banks and by smal; re
ceipts of g-old in payment of dues to
the g-overam2nt until the 14th of No
vember, is:il. wiwa it reached the sum
of 8'"il.S7S.374.
The secretary then says:
I have prepared the outlines of a plr.a which.
ia mv opinio::, will relieve the government to
a (ircat extent from the. burdens now imposed
upon it. secure within a raasoaable time u safe
and elastic national and state b mi; currency,
and re.-ult ultimately in tie permanent retire
ment of United States legal tender notes of
both classes. It is. in brief, as follows:
First Keyeal all laws requiring, or author
izing the deposit of CniteJ 1st jtes bonds as se
curity for circulation.
Second Permit national banks to issue notes
to aa amount not exceeding 7 per centum of
their paid up and uninipjire i capita!, but re
quire each bnn'.c before receiving notes to de
posit a guarantee fund, consisting of United
States k'fra! tender notes, including treasury
notes of iS'J i to Hie amount of 'Jii per cent, of
the circulating notes outstanding to be main
tained at all tiraex. an:l whenever a bank re
tires its circulation, in whole or Vi part, its
puarantee fund to be returned to it in propor
tion to the amount of notes retired.
Third Retain th'3 provision of the law mak
ing stockholders individually liable and pro
vide that the circulation notes shall constitute
a first lien upon ail the assets of the bank.
Fourth Impose a tax of 4 of 1 per centum
per annnm. payable semi-annually, upon the
average amount of notes in circulation to de
fray the expenses of printing notes, official
supervision, cancellation, etc.
Fifth No national bank note to be of less
denomination than tea dollars, and all notes of
the same denomination t be uniform in design:
but banks desiring tj rsueem their notes ia
pold may have them made payable in that coin.
The secretary of the treasury to have authority
to prepare -ind keep on h ind ready for issue
upon application a reserve of blank national
bank cotes for each banking association having
circulation.
Sixth Kcquire each nation-.il banking asso
ciation to redeem its notes at its own office, or
at its own oK'.eial agencies to be designated
by it.
Seventh To provide a safety fund for the
immediate rcdemotion of the circulating notes
of failed banks, impase a tax of (blank) per
centum per annum upon the average circula
tion o" each bank until the fund amounts to 5
percent, of the total cirjulation outstanding.
Require each new bank and each bank taking
out additional circulation to deposit its proper
proportion of this fund before receiving notes.
When a bank fails, its guarantee fund held on
deposit to be paid into the safety fund
anil used in the redemption of its
notes, and if this fund s".v!l be impaired
by the redemption, of tiie notes of
failed national bmks. and the immediately
available cash assets of such banks are insuf
ficient to establish the fund, it shall at once b3
ma-Je sood by pro rata assessments upon the
other banks, according to the amounts of their
outstanding circulation: but there shall be a
first lien upon all assets of failed bank or
banks to reimburse the contributing banks.
The safety fund may be invested in outstand
ing United States bonds, having the longest
time to run. the bonds aad the interest upon
them to be held as part of the fund and sold,
when necessary, to redeem notes of failed
banks.
Ki-.r'nih Repeal the provisions of the reor
ganization and extension act of July 12. ism.
impeslug limitations upm the reduction and
increase of national bunk circulation.
Ninth Repeal all provisions of the law re
quiring bunks to keep a reserve on account of
deposits.
Tenth The :;ecretiry of the treasury may.
In his discretion, use any surplus revenue of
the United States In the redemption and re
tirement cf United States lesal tender notes
but such redemptions shall not in the aggregate
exceed an amount equal to 7i per cent, of the
additional circulation taken out by national
and state banks tinder the system herein pro
posed. Eleventh Circulating notes issue! by
banking corporation duly organizel under the
laws cf any state, and which transacts no other
than a banking business, shall be exempt from
taxation under the laws of the United States,
when it is shown ti the satisfaction of the sec
retary of the treasury and the comptroller of
the currency: ,
1. That sueh bank ha? at no time had out
standing its circulation notes in excess of 75
percentum of its paid up and unimpaired capi
tal. That its stockholders are individually lia
ble for the redemption of its circulating notes
to the full extent of their ownershiD of stock.
2. That the circulating notes constitute by law
a first lien upon all assets of the bank.
4. That the bink ut all times keep the guar
antee fund in the United States legal tender
notes, including treasury notes of !SX. equal
to 30 per centum of its outstanding circulating
note: and.
' f. That it has promptly redeemed its notes
on demand at its principal office, or at one or
more of its branch o31ces. if it has branches;
Twelfth The secretary of the treasury may,
tinder proper rules and regulations to be estab
lished by him. permit state banks to procure
and use in i he preparation of their notes and
distinctive pr. per used in printing United States
securities: but no stiie bank shill print oren
rravc its notes in similitude of n United States
i:ote or certificate, or uational bank notes.
Whatever ca- be the objections to the Issue
and circulation of United States legal tender
paper upon either constitutional or financial
ground, it his become so incDrporated into our
currency system and constitutes so largo a
part of our act.ve circulation that it could not
be suddenly withdrawn without produc
ing ia the pre-e :t state of our laws
considerable disturban-e in the fiscal
operations cf the government as well
as Vas business of the people, and,
therefore, the plan now suggested provides for
its gradual rctiromi ut b the use of surplus
revenues hereafter received, a process which
will probably require several year-; for its com
pletion. As these notes cannot be retired
until o:her forms of currency to an equal
amount have ttken their place, there will be
neither a forced contraction or expansion of
tie circulation on account of the chiuge.
As the plan suggested proposes to exempt
the government cf the United States from all
Lability for the redemption of national bank
OtCi and place the sole responsibility upon
the banks themselves, a guaranteed fund of
not less than 30 per centum upon the outstand
ing circulation Is regarded as a very propel
and necessary feature of the system.
In my opinion, the imposition of a tax by the
federal government upon the use of circulating
notes, lawfully issued byvstate banks, is an un
justifiable, if not an unconstitutional interfer
ence with the authority of the several states:
but its validity has been Judicially sustained'
and as it does not appear to be practical tc
repeal absolutely at this time, it is proposed
to avoid the prohibitory effect by exempting
from taxation the notes of such banking insti
tutions as may be organized and conducted
under conditions which will amply protect the
'holders of their paper. While direct super
vision is not. and ought not to be provided for,
the requirement that a bank, in order to se
cure exemption from taxation must satisfy the
secretary of the treasury and the comptrollei
of the currency that It has complied with all
the conditions imposed, will enable those offi
cials to adopt such measures as may be neces
sary in each case to secure every material fact
involved in the inquiry.
The secretary, after dilating' upon tho
foreyoinjr, then discusses the tariff and
makes a strong1 plea for reform. The
secretary afterward states:
The revenues of the government from all
sources for the fiscal year ended June 30. ism,

DRUM AND CYMBALS.:
The Instruments of Percussion (Jsed la mm
Orchestra.
There are two kinds of nercussive in
struments those of a definite pitch and
those used without regard , to pitch for
rhythm only. Of those of definite pitch,
the kettledrums are the most impor
tant. Tho kettledrums are used in
pairs, hence the plural form of tha
name. One drum is larger than the
other, the larger and deeper toned be
ing called the U dram, and its compan
ion, the C drum. The kettledrum is
named from its appearance, being1 in
reality a copper or brass vessel, ovet
the head of which is stretched a calf
skin which has been treated with oil.
One principal defect of the drum is that
it is impossible to have the membrane
of perfectly equal thickness, and so the
sound vibration is impaired. The ket
tledrum is tuned by means of a num
ber of large screws around its edge,
and tuning is a laborious work. At
tempts have been made to tune by me
chanical appliances, but hand work
still excels.
Thus drum is struck near the edge
for bright effects, otherwise in the
middle. Two pairs' of drumsticks are
used for producing variety in tone
color. The points of execution of this
drum are long notes, short notes (the
tone being checked by tor.ching the
drumhead with the hand), trills and
muted notes, the last being played by
putting a cloth over the drumhead.
The kettledrums were formerly used
in military bands, and ere still used
somewhat in cavalry bands, where the
kettledrums are strapped together and
hung over tho horse's neck, one on
either side. The compass of these in
struments is any two tones between
great F and small F. Ileethoven was
the liberator of the kettledrums, as of
so many other instruments. The tone
color of the instrument is one of
anxiety and suspense, and has been
nsed by JJeethoven, Haydn, llerhoz,
Meyerbeer and Wagner with most
dramatic effect. The largest number of
kettledrums ever used at one time was
in 15crlioz"s mass, where, with sixteen
of these instruments used in a rising
crescendo, he pictures the confusion of
the judgment daj-, leading on to the
sound of the last trump. There was
one expert kettledrum player. Pfund,
Herman for pound, was such an artist
that his playing worked a reform ia
the orchestra with regard to the ket
tledrum. It is now given only to com
petent players in this particular
branch. It used to be given to the in
valid of the orchestra.
The bass drum is used for rhythm.
In loud passages it portrays boisterous
festivity, and in soft passages is used
to express mystery. It is played with
one drumstick, with the end covered
with chamois. The side drum is used
very effectively in vorking up a cre
scendo. The best use of it was made
by Uerlioz in his " Damnation of
Faust."
The glockenspiel, German for a
chime of bells, is composed of small
bars of steel of varying lengths. It is
nsed in passages of extreme sweetness,
and almost never enters into sympho
nies. Hells are imitated by Uerlioz in
his Childe Harold symphony by using
the reverberation of the horn, with the
twang of the harp, for a cathedral bell,
and by uniting flute and clarinet with
the harp for a higher toned belL The
most effective bell effects are in the
Huguenots and II Trovatore.
The xylophone consists of a number
of bars of wood of different lengths,
placed on a frame, which are struck
with a mallet. It was used by St.
Sacns in the Dance of the Dead, to
represent the bones of the skeletons
knocking together.
Cymbals are without definite pitch.
They are used for the clangor of fes- '
tivity, and for rhythmic effects. The
tom-tom is the ordinarj' Chinese gong,
and is used at climaxes of a catastroph
ic nature. '
The triangle is a bent bar of steel,
ind has been used to imitate the tink
ling of sheep bells, and also in gypsy
music. The tambourine is also a gypsy
instrument, and is used in all tropical
dance music.
The castanets are two hollow bits of
hard wood which are clicked together.
