HAWAII,.
,(
The Hawaiian situation remains
unchanged. A9 Minister Willis rath
er pompously declares, "the whole
question is now in abeyance, and
nuthing that newspapers can say or
do will alter thestatementone iota."
We presume the press of the country
will bear up fairly well under this
blow. Willis was sent on by the ad
ministration to restore the mon
archy, but he repoits that "con
tingencies" have arisen which induce
him to await further instructions
rom Washington before proceeding
to put Liliuokalani on her throne
again. Meantime the provisional
government holds the fort. It may
be that these "contingencies" will
develop so fully as to change admin
istration's mind on the Hawaiian
question. The country is anxious to
know just what is to be dune on
these islands, where American inter
ests are so largely involved, and a
good deal may depend on the next
move that is made.
DECLINED WITH THANKS.
The hue and cry raised all over
the country against the nomination
of Van Alcn as ambassador to
Italy in return (or his fiity-thousand-doilar
contribution to the democrat
ic campaign fund, has had its effect.
At least Mr. Yan Alen has written
the president, declining to accept the
position, after being confirmed by
the senate; and the protest of the
people against so open a political
bargain must be regarded as having
a great deal to do with Mr, Van
Alen's declining.
The gentleman in question does
not deny that he gave largely to the
campaign fund, and says he was im
pelled so to do by a bt lief that "a
continuance of republican supremacy
would be a hindrance to national
progress," etc. However well or
poorly founded that belief may be,
the sending of Mr. Van Alen to Italy
as our representative was felt to be,
nder the circumstances, by leading
lights in his own party, a very dis
creditable proceeding; and it is a
matter for congratulation that the
appointee has taken the hint and
declined with thanks.
The tempest stirred up by this ap
pointment should prevent the con
signation of similar bargains by
either party.
THE MESSAGE.
President Cleveland's message was
read to congress on Monday of this
week, and it takes eight columns of
small type to get the document out
into the light where the public can
see what there is in it. The message
contains suggestions and rccommend
ationson matters of vital importance
to the nation, bnt nothing especially
new is set forth. Considerable in
terest was felt in w hat Mr. Cleveland
might say about Hawaii, but his al
lusion to this question is compara
tively brief. No definite action hav
ing been taken as yet, he promises to
communicate again with congress
when further advices are received by
him. The following summary of the
points in the message is taken from
the Boston Journal, and will give
our readers a fair idea of the presi
dent's views on national issues:
The message opens by saying that
while our iorciii relations hnve not been
free from perplexity, no cnibarrassine
situation remains Hint will not yield to
mirness or justiee.
Admiral Stanton's salute to Admiral
Mello is disavowed.
Minister Ivirnn ol Chile is rebuked for re
civing tinsuecesslul revolutionists into
his ollieial residence.
Tilde lms been a little friction with
certnin ol the South American countries,
sut u is an riKin now.
French aggression in Liberia is repro
sated.
The hone is expressed that the Nicar
agua Cunal project inny be accomplished
aiuler American auspiecs.
It enlarges upon the "Impolicy of en-
tannlinii loreifin alliances," as instanced
in the United btateg-Sitmoan-Briush pro
tectorate of Samoa.
It recommends that congress make
recognition to Spain lor the gift ot the
caravels.
Turkey is notified that American mis
sionariea must and shall be protected.
It gives a recapitulation of the
Hawaiian mutter, and stales thut the
president is satisfied Iron) Mr. blount's
report that the constitutional govern
ment of Hawaii had been subverted with
the active aid of Minister Stevens .mid
through theintimidationol armed United
Slate forces. Minister Willis has been
ordered to restore the monarchy as far
ns lies in his power,
It approves of the settlement of
d.plomutie disputes by arbitration and
of a plan of raising the grade of our en
voys to ambussudor to ureut Urituin,
France, Italy and Germany.
It recommends a recast of the consular
laws that the service may be made more
efficient.
It summarises the report of the secre
tary of the treasury and gives coinuge
and bank statistics. The deficit in the
treasury Nov. 1 was $28,000,000.
The effect of silver renenl.in the opinion
of the president, is salutary and far
reaching, but it is impossible to say pre
cisely what changed conditions will be
brought about or what supplementary
legislation will be essentiul. We must
"turn awny from alluring expedients."
The president wants authority to invite
an international monetary conference
when there is a fail prospect of agree
ment. A more efficient national quarantine is
recommended.
As there can be no more Indian out
breaks, the redistribution of the army is
recommended.
It recommends the abolition of the fee
system ns applicable to the compensa
tion ol United States attorneys, marshals,
clerks and commissioners.
A more sensible and business-like
organization of the postmaster general's
department is recommended.
The president is in lavor ol consistent
naval development, but congress must
consider the depleted treasury and be
careful in making appropriations.
He avers that there arc thousands 01
fraudulent pensioners on the rolls.
The abolition of Indiun tribal relations
is urged, and the allotment of land in
severalty.
Laws for the preservation of the for
ests are especially recommended.
t he gratituous distribution 01 seeds dv
the agricultural department is costly and
of little a vail ; it should be stopped.
The president is more than ever con
vinced of the incalculable benefits con
ferred bv the civil service law.
Tnriff pledges must be redeemed. While
adhering to the principle of "revenue
onlv." a "discriminating care must be
exercised in the distribution of such
duties." Free raw material is urged.
The Wilson bill cordially recommended.
It will be remembered that Col.
Ainsworth, formerly of Woodstock,
was, in common with three other
government officials, held responsi
ble by the courts for the collapse of
the Old Ford theatre building at
Washington last June, by which sev
eral lives were lost, and an indict
ment for manslaughter followed.
The district court of appeals has just
sustained a dernurreroffered by Ains-
worth's counsel, and declared the in
dictment against him to be fatally
defective. This sends the case back
to the lower court, which will dis
charge Ainsworth and his associates.
It is exceedingly doubtful if anything
further is heard from thiscase, which,
at the time, created such a stir.
The demon of the liquor traffic is
furious when attacked, and hits hard
in revenge when opportunity offers.
The city of Ilazelhurst, Miss., was
on Monday the scene of a brutal
murder by representatives of the
liquor interest. In revengefor Mayor
Williamson's earnest fight against
illegal sales of the ardent he was as
saulted on the streets in broad day
light and so seriously hurt that he
died three hours after. Acts of this
sort 6trve to strengthen the opposi
tion to the evil traffic and to bring
its devotees under, condemnation.
The candidates for lieutenant-gov
ernor are being mentioned by the
state press and we note that the
Burlington Free Press names Hon.
Henry C. Bates of St. Johnsbury, in
response to an editorial in our St.
Johnsbury contemporary, who an
nounces "that St. Johnsbury has a
cinch on the office next time round."
Mr. Bates has served the state well
in the past and he has a host of
friends in Vermont who believe that
he would make an excellent lieutenant-governor.
Gov. Lcwelling of Kansas has a
great scheme in miud the construc
tion of a gulf and inter-state rail
road, which will enable Western
farmers to carry their products
across the Atlantic "at a saving of
millions of dollars annually." Ten
states are to be asked to aid in build
ing the line, which will extend from
the Brit it-h possessions to the Gulf of
Mexico. This is a gigantic enter
prise, the successful issue of which,
while not impossible, is likely to be
delayed for some time yet.
Another official head has dropped
into the basket, nt St. Albans, and
C. S. Forbes is superseded by A. L
Weeks as deputy collector of internal
revenue. The new appointee is a
wide awake business man of St.
Albans, and will muke an excellent
deputy in Uncle Sara's revenue de
partment. The railroad town has
yet to be provided with a change of
postmasters, and when this is done
the "offensive partisans" in that
vicinity will have been pretty much
taken care of.
Isn't it time, alter recent ex
peiiences with outside financiers, for
lakes like Brewer to find Vermont
unprofitable soil to cultivate?
Burlington Clipper.
It would seem so, certainly. And
if we rtmember correctly, the Bur
ton people diil not bile ui Brewer's
bait so extensively as to muke his
profits bewildcringly large.
At least one republican postmaster
the official at Springfield, Mass.
leaves his office under most favorable
auspices. He has resigned as post
master only to step into the state
treasurer's office to which he was
elected last month.

ty outrages have been reported, but
none ns yet very serious, f armers are
arming themselves in order to protect
themselves and families from the bands
of men who stroll about the country.
There never was such an amount ol law
