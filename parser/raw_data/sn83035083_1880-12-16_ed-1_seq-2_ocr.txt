Ahjp . now Hayes comes out in a
Proclamation announcing free trade
with China. It is reported that the
treaty was actually made in time lobe
proclaimed before tbe late election,
and that Hayes knew it before he left
California, but that it was kept back
for tbe reason that it might hurl Gar
field. Jobs' Kelly, tbe Tammany boss,
has been bounced Irom the office ol
Comptroller, and Allen Campbell cho
en aa his successor, and the nomina
tion made by Mayor Ceoper confirm
ed. This was brought about by an
alliance ot the anti-Tammauy Alder
jnen wHh Republicans. Great excite
tnent prevailed throughout the city
over tbe overthrow of the " Bote."
. Tbb aaonal report of the Ohio State
Inspector of Mines shows that for the

was 6,307,725 tone, aud the Co mm is
aioner estimates that tbe aggregate
oatput for the year ending December
31st, 1880, will reach, if it does not
exceed, 7,000,000 ten 4.
The balance of trade for the year
endipg October 31, 187'J, was $2G!),
200.000 fa our favor, but for the year
nding October 31, 1830, it had been
reduced to $155,500,000, a falling off
f $113,700,000. This shows a re
markable change going on in tbe for
eign 'commerce of tbe country. As
times Improve, the importation of
foreign luxuries largely increases.
The Republicans are doing every
thing In their power to prevent the
adoption of the joint rule for counting
the electoral vote by Congress. Gen.
Grant was twice counted in under a
similar rale, but the Rads don't relish
their own legislation, because they
are determined to defeat every meas
ure which does not recognize tbe ar
bitrary authority of the Vice-President
to make the count.
JLm Age of Improvement.
We live in an age of improvements
aa Is evident to all when we consider
tbe wonderful discoveries which are
coming to light day by day. One of
tbe latest and most wonderful is the
discovery of Kendall's Spavin Cure,
which will cure a spavin, splint, curb,
callous or ring-bone, and remove the
enlargement without even blistering
or causing a sore and it has recently
been tested for deep-seated pains,
rheumatism, enlargements and many
similar difficulties on man as well as
beast, and it has been found to work
uo well that it la believed to be the very
beet liniment for external use on mau
that has ever been discovered. It can
be used full strength at all seasonsof
tbe year with peaect safety. Read the
advertisement for Kendall's Spavin
Cure.
The Republican leaders, while gloat
ing over their great victory and declar
ing- that the Democratic party is dead,
seem to forget that they have been ut
tering that silly twaddle for the past
twenty years, and yet at every return
ing election the party of Jefferson and
Jackson comes to the front ready as
ever to fight for the principles of equal
privileges against the monopolists.
They seem to be ignorant of the fact
that at the late election General Han
cock received the votes of nineteen
States, and that Garfield received not
a greater number, while he is largely
in Ihe minority of the . popular vote,
and that, with the aid of the solid ne
gro vote of the North, the 100,000 fed
eral office holders, the National Hanks,
the eoereion of employes by mammoth
manufacturing establishments through
out the country and all the corrupt ap
pliances of colonization of voters, false
registration and tyrannical employ
ment, of the federal electiou machinery
they were able to eke out only 3,401
plurality of the popular vote for the
great bribe-taker. Their victory was
dearly bought, indeed, and a becom
ing modesty should dictate to the lead
ers that they go slow in boasting over
their triumph. And above all things
they should not fail to remember that
the Democratic party is not dead nor
does it propose to ground the weapons
of its warfare while the country is
confronted with the momentous ques
tion of revolutionizing the govern
ment of the fathers and planting upon
the ruins of the republic they estab
lished a "strong government," inJ
which the reserved powers of the
States shall be ignored, State lines ob
literated and the national government
assume imperial authority, or while
the attempt is made to build up a
privileged order in this land. The
Democratic party is the party of the
Constitution and equal rights, and
whenever the atu-mpt is madetoover
throw'the government which it estab
lishes, every man faithful to its prin
ciples and worthy to bear its great
name will be found in the front rauks
ready to renew the fight against the
monarchial doctrines of the Radical
party and in favor of the constitution
and human rights.
The time was, when the United
States was regarded as a confederation
of States, before it had -grown, under
the nursing of the Republicans, to be
a nation with a big N, that its flag was
respected In every quarter of the civ
ilized world, and &irorwa mU pro-1
tection to every American citizen, but
since it has grown to be a " strong
government" it pockets the insult to
its flag by a Chilian cruiser, without
any apparent attempt to resent or re
dress it. A little less brag and bluster
and a trifle more exhibition of back
bone would be more becoming.
Hon.-E. B. Taylor, who was chosen
ou the 30th ult., to serve out the un
expired term of Gen. Garfield in the
House, is not permitted to take undis
puted possession of the seat. Hon.
Frank llurd insists that Taylor's cre
dentials be referred to the Committee
on Elections, averring that Taylor does
not represent any district, either under
the laws of the United States or the
laws of Ohio. Rut Taylor has been
sworn in.
The Madisou County Court House,
at Anderson, Indiana, with its con
tents, was destroyed by fire ou Friday

ants of the necessity of guarding
against a like calamity? If such a
disaster should befall us somebody will
be held guilty of culpable negligence.
Hayes' message Hoi led Down.
We published Hayes' last annual
message in full last week, and presume
it has been pretty generally read and
its suggestions weighed, but for the
benefit of those who have not thought
it worth while to wade through the
long, prosy document, we present the
following brief summary thereof:
The message recommends land
grants, and if necessary, the appropri
ation of money for educational pur
poses in the South ; an appropriation
lor a commission to devise a system of
competitive examinations applicable
to all branches of the civil service;
proposes reform in the method of ap
pointment and removal of higher of
ficers; calls attention K the Mormon
question and suggests a change of
Government Tor Utah, aud touches
upon the position of the Government
iu the Fortune Bay affair, Iu a re
view of our foreign relation, Mr.
Hayes reiterates his views of the De
Leeps canal project aa expressed iu a
special message to Congress iu March
last, and albo mentions the safe arrival
of the .Egyptian obelisk. President
Hayes coucurs with iSecretary Sher
man in recommending the substitution
of an honest xOO-ceul sWver dollar,
for the present standard dollar, which
the Treasury has been unable to force
into ciiculation. The surplus revenue
for the next year is estimated at over
$00,000,000, aud Mr. Sherman presents
to Congress the alternative of either
reduciug taxation or devoting the sur
plus to the further reduction of tbe
debt. Mr. Hayes also suggests that
Congress should create the rank of
Captain-General of tbe Army for Gen
Grant.
alter a Pardon.
The Warren correspondent of the
Pittsburgh Post says: Some of the
friends of George R. Kennedy, the de
faulting auditor of Trumbull county,
held a meeting to consult and take ac
tion in procuring his pardon from the
penitentiary, where he is serving out
a term of three years. It was decid
ed to circulate a petition for signatures,
and confidence was expressed that if
proper representations were made to
Governor Foster, backed by a numer
ously signed petition, that there was
nodoubtof success. The ou ly au x iety
seemed to be as to how Mr. Peterson of
the Tribune, regarded it whether he
would give his approval or remain si
lent. He might create an unpleasant
ness by stirring up the rural kickers.
AH the expressions of sympathy were
on behalf of Kennedy's wife. There
is a good deal of maudlin sentiment
exhibited over this Republican olficial
who has stolen more than all the horse (
thieves and burglars taken together ,
ever sentenced from this county,
When, after several efforts a couvic-,
tion that would stick was procured by
a compromise, the sentence was almost
unanimously regarded as trifling com-
pared with the offense, taking tbe in-,
telligence and standing of the culprit
into account. The only palliating fact
in the case is, that he was not much
worse than other officials that were
associated with him, and who were al
lowed to return their ill-gotten plun
der to the treasury and go ecot free."
Washington Letter.
Washington, Dec. 3rd, 1880.
Congress is again in full blast and is
proving itself as much a windmill as
any of its predecessors. On Monday
both houses convened with the qui
etude aud informality which charac
terize the opening hours of the last
Bession of Congress. The receiving and
reading of the President's Message is
usually the main duty of the day, and
yet, in this instance, the groundwork
was laid for a winter's debate by the
introduction of the electoral count
measure before thecouu try knew what
Hayes had to say upon the iolitical
matters of the Government. Now the
House is busied wrestling with that
exceedingly indefinite aud vexations
problem involved in the couuting of
the electoral vote, and dear only knows
whether any Other question will be
considered until the windmill exhausts
itself. Mr. Garfield is elected all ad
mit that but the manner of declaring
the fact is the weighty couumlrum be
fore the average Congressmau, and
every other political interest of the
country wil have to sutler pending the
solution. It is astonishing how many
bills similar to this in real uselessuess
have been resurrected by members
ambitious of notoriety at home, with
certain classes of constituents, or with
the press. And yet all know that un
less tbe present program in debate is
dropped the last session of the 46th
Congress will be as barren of useful
legislation as that of the 44th, when
Mr. Hayes' admission to the White
House had to be determined. The
Senate, however, is pegging away
quietly at sundry matters, and dispos
ing of them with its usual dispatch,
when its windmill is not aroused into
activity by some purely political breeze
Senator Voorhees is vigorously push
iug his bill for the erectiou of a Nation
al Library. He, and his Committee,
have unanimously decided against fur
ther occupancy of the Capitol for Li
brary puritoses, either by extension of
the building or by the use of the pres
ent rooms, which are so wholly inade
quate for the daily needs, and will rec
ommend the erection of au ample
structure upon some one' of the Gov
ernment reservations, probably Judi
ciary Square.which is oueof our largest
parks. Two most important matters
have appeared iu the Senate. One
looking to the purchase from the legal
representatives of the ex-Confederate
Generals Bragg and Polk, their private
naiiers relating to the late war ; the
other, the annotiucemenTror MrrRan
dolph that he will, on Monday next,
ask the Senate to consider the bill re
storing Fitz John Porter to the army
without pay. Both these measures
will provoke extended debate. The
proposed purchase does an apparent
wrong to the ex-Confederates who
have freely given their private papers ;
the country knows the objections
which are urged against the restora
tion of a cashiered officer. It is our
belief, however, that some form of re
lief will be given him as a sequence of
his persisteut fight. He was evidently
in the wVong at the time he is alleged
to have disobeyed Pope's orders, but as
it is admitted that other generals
shared his unwillingness to fight under
Pope, aud quite as openly and directly
were guilty of disobediance, the feeling
is undoubtedly growing here that Por
ter should have fair play, or rather,
should not be made the scapegoat for
all the alM)ini nations of the fall-campaign
of 1SC2. It is settled that we are
to have au Agricultural Report for 1879,
Senator Johnson has ascertained that
the delay in publicatiog has been
caused by the difficulties experienced
in getting the illustrations for it. The
Public Printer informs the Senator
that the Uejiort will be ready for dis
tribution a'.out Christmas. It is very
voluminous, much more so than any
of its predecessors, and, in so far as we
have examined it, we regard it as con
taining much more of real value to
farmers generally than any of the
series for many years past. It is so cus
tomary to deride the Agricultural Re
port, that the public have come to re
gard it as one of tbe means used by
Congress to waste our revenue, but the
truth is, that no other official report
contains more valuable information
for any one class than this of the Ag
ricultural Department. It covers the
investigations of experts and scientists
into the causes leading to the losses of
farmers in all directions, and ridicule
it as we may, the country reaps an im
mense benefit from this published
work of the Commissioners' of Agri
culture. It should have au immense
distribution.
' The feeling is undoubted in Con
gress that the present taxes ou matches
and bank checks must Unabolished.
The pressure against the taxes, partic
ularly on matches, was very stroiis;
last winter, aud now seems to have
assumed shape iu the guaranty of re
moval. 8 few people are troubled
with bank accounts that the two cents
required upon a check does not draw
forth a universal protest like the penny
on matches.
meeting- r tbe Portage County
itledical Society.
Ravenna, Dec. 2, 1S80.
Society convened in Dr. Alcorn's
office und was called to order by the
President, Dr. Hugus. Secretary Dr.
Moralh being absent, Dr. Alcorn was
appointed Secretary pro tern.
The minutes of the last meeting were
read and approved.
Dr. Leonard presented two cases for
opinion aud treatment; one a case of
chronic diarrhoea of four years stand
ing, rendering the patient totally una
ble to labor, the other a fine specimen
of herpes circinatus. Treatment sug
gested for each case.
A very interesting paper was then
read by Dr. Leonard on the subject of
Diphtheria, giviug its pathology .treat
ment and valuable suggestions for the
prevention, or for mollifying the poi
sonous substances which propagate the
disease. The Dr. would have a Com
mittee appointed whose duty would be
to report on the origin and nature of
the poison, and how best to shield our
homes from its invasion, and that this
Committee should reach the people
through the public press of the county.
The Dr. thought such report from our
own home talent would be much more
likely to attract the attention of our
citizens than that from distant author-
ity. The subject of the essay w as free-
ly discussed by different members, but
especially by Dr. E. W. Price, of Kent,
where the disease has done its most
deadly work. The Dr. spoke of the
different grades of of the disease, of its
attack upon every class of society and
iu every kind of locality the families
upon the high sand banks as well as
those along the flats.
When the afternoon was spent in
earnest discussion, the meeting ad.
journed to meet in Pr. Waggoner's of
fice on the first Thursday of January,
1881. H- P. H pg us, Pres'.t.

That Hunting Party.
Friend Harris: Perhaps your
readers would be pleased to kuow
something of the Portage County par
ty which recently were deer hunting
in the mountains of Pennsylvania. I
will tbeiefore furnish you a brief
statement of the facts.
On the 4th of November, at 8,20 A.
AT, we started for Coiry yia. N. Y.,
Pa. & O. R. R-, where we arrived at 1
P. M. There took the P. & E. R. 11.
for Sheffield. .Arrived at Sheffield at
4 P. M., where most of our parly put
up for the night at the Lse House,
kept by mino host Louis Lay, where
we bad tbe best of fare for the night.
air Lrotucr?, with one or two more
of our party, went to Lower Sheffield
and staid over night with E. Carey,
Esq., who was to be our guide, aud
who expected fo hunt with us.
Mormug ot the otn, Alex, vail re
turned to Sheffield and told us that
the drive to (ho hunting ground would
piobably bo bad. He brought with
km Alex. Marshall, with a very heavy
spun of horses to take us up the
mountain to Ihohuntiug grouud, said
to be twenty one miles distaut. We
loaded and bound ou our baggage,
weighing 1464 pounds, aud at 9 A. M
started. O, Allyn. S. S. Iiurlbut, aud
myself, were to ride. I walked to
Beeu's P. O., two and one-half miles,
then got on to the wagou and rode a
mile, aud such a ride! Sometimes one
wheel up two feet on a rock, then it
suddenly dropped luto a chuck-hole'.
It required active work and strong
bauds to keep top of the load, so I
concluded to foot it up the mountain.
Our team had to go by the way ol
Hrookstowti, and our party could save
lour miles by taking up tbe mountain
across to the Waison place (so known)
where we arrived at 2,30 P. M. Here
we had to wait uulil 4 P. M, for our
team. We saw many deer tracks here
in the road. One of our party Wil
bird M-thau took his rifle and struck
out iuto the woods a short distance,
aud returned, saying he had secu a
flock of deer going down the hillside.
He guessed there were five of them,
but it looked as though there were
five hundred. We all had a hearty
laugh, and Alex. Vair went out and
saw their track?, and said there were
five of them. Four P. M. our team
came, and we had some eight miles
yet to make to reach our buutiug
ground We'held consultation, aud
decided te encamp here for the night.
Went iuto au old hunters' camp which
was about ten feet square, got our
supper, and spent tbe eveuing cutting
hemlock boughs and preparing bunks
on which to sleep. Iu this little room
eleven of us slept or staid that night.
Five A. M., Nov. C, breakfasted and
started on our jourucy. 1 P. M., we
had made five miles and stopped near
the Cunningham place (90 kuown),
and the teamster said be could not
pull our load the balance of the way
to Mill Brook. So we here held coun
sel, and decided to atop at an old hun
ters' camp, one-half mile west of uf,
which had becu burned out a year or
so before. This place we reached with
our team about 2 P. M., and unloaded
our baggage, paid our teamster $10,
and he left. It commenced to rain,
and the winds" rose, and the storm
became frightful. We had uo shelter
except some old deserted Indian wig
wam?, unused for the last two years.
Well, we weut to work, cut logo, aud
put up a large loghcap, and here, amid
a howling storm snapping and crash
ing the mighty hemlocks at our right
and at our left, to tho ground, we
spent the night,
Sunday morning, the 7ih, the wind
had shifted to the north, aud it com
menced freezing. We went at once
to repairing our camp so as to have
our house iu order lor the fol'owing
night.
Ou Monday we finished our camp,
aud Tuesday we divided our party
and struck out in various directions,
prospecting aud running lines, and
raarkiug trees to camp. These lines
were north, east aud west. The trees
we marked three notches toward camp,
oue notch from camp. This work took
several drys.
Fred. French, who was down the
Blue Jay about three mile, killed a
fine large buck, weighing about 175
pounds. This was the first deer and
the first pair of horns got by our par
ty. Ou the following day, Orsou
Collins aud Hiram II u! sou were out
diluting in company. John Collins
shot st a large doe about forty rods
dig'"!, running at full speed, and
killed her. This was the second vcu
isou lor the party.
After this tho ground became dry
and frozeu, aud the twigs cracked aud
leaves ratttea so that we nan poor
luck for several days. Fiually there
came a little snow, and oue day ot
good hunting; we hung up three
deer on that day. Then it turned cold,
mercury 10 deg. below zero, and poor
hunting; too noisy ; but James Vair,
O. Callius and myself, hunting in
company, to share equally, killed a
young buck, I following the track,
James Vair flanking on my right and
Collins ou my left. We followed this
deer from about 10 A. M. uutil about
12 M., when the deer came out to
Vair, who shot it, wounding it severe
ly. We then followed it until about
3 P. M., shooting at it any chauce,
when Vair got In another shot that
killed the deer. James Vair had also
killed a deer the same morning, before
we saw this one. Hiram Hutson afso
killed a deer on tbe same day. This
was ouo good day. S. S, Iiurlbut af
terward killed a fine young buck, and
Fred. French killed another large
buck, the largest by auy of us killed
or seen while we were in the moun
tains. It was from this deer that tbe
large and curious horns were by us
obtained. Freuch also killed another
Hue buck, and he well earned the name
given him before he started "Kill
Buck." By the way, the party were
all named before leaving for tbe pleas
aut hunting ground.
We eat the fore quarters iu camp.
making us an abuudancc of meat dur
ing our stay.
One of my legs became badly galled
by weariug heavy boots, aud I caught
cold iu the wound aud was complete'
ly disabled for about two weeks.
Williard Mahan left for home after
being with us about ten days, and Q,
Allyn left in about two weeks, the
rest of our party remained four weeks
lacking two days. We had a pleasant
time. There were plenty of deer.some
bears and wild cats, and other game in
the woods, but the weather was so cold
and traveling co noisy wo concluded
best to break camp and leave. '
Our hunting ground was about two
thousaud feet aboye tide water, and
leaving camp and getting to Sheffield
was about as d.:fuV.ult at it was getting
into camp. S. D. N.
DeLkssei's canal scheme is boom
ing. On the day the books were op
ened nearly $4,000,000 of stock were
taken in New York, and $1,000,000 has
been subscribed in San Francisco.
Since the election of Garfield, near
ly every day brings tho news of the
failure of one or more business houses.
That of B. G. Arnold & Sons, coffee
dealers of New York, is the heaviest
yet reported. When it was generally
believed that Hancock would be elect
ed these thiiiKS did not occur. What
can the matter be ? Is the couutry ou
the eve of another commercial and
financial crash ?
