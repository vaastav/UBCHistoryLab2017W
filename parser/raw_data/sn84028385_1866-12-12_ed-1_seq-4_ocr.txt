AN AUTUMN DAY.
NOVEMBER 13, 1866.
A crimson curtsin veiled the west.
As closed this Indian sumiaer day.
And o'er earthV soar and nake breast
Heaven's bright reflected mantle lay.
The autumn wilds had sought their eaves.
To mi it seened a holy hush.
River and lake rolled not a wave
All waiting f a magic touch.
Of fierce old waiter, who is eoming
On his hoarse whistling, rattling ear
On our roof willsoon be drumming,
Proclaim:nghe"tl11 tor war.
Will marshal aJ his frigid host
And blustering loud will take the field.
And o'er our land will stalk a ghost.
In armur brirfit as burnished steel;
Will thunder at our castle wall.
And bulwarks raise of ice and snow.
We .bout when lis bright missiles fall.
For health'spura rose again will glow.
On the pale, fadd. sallow cheek.
And lire-side have their fullyest.
In S.mthern lanls in vain we seek
For winter sceies that come to bless,
Vernon. 0. H-
Maximilian Out of Humer
with Napoleon.
The following significant patua, oc
curs in the Paris correspondence of the
Independence Beige, November- 12th:
The late news from Mexico makes
mention of Maximilian's- ill humor on
account of the way in which he has
been forsake by the French govern
ment. It is even announced that on
his return to Europe (which is expect
ed soon to take place) he will publish
the correspondence with our Govern
ment (France), together with all the
documents bearing on the Mexican
question which he has in his possession.
It is easy to imagine what must be the
feeling of irritation that sways Maxi
milian now that he is about to be dis
possessed. Nevertheless, there is no
discuisinz the. fact that the French,
government is not free toact differently
from the way it is acting iu this affair,
Richmond Newspapers on the
Message.
O
The Examiner says that there ia noth-
& . . , e . ,
ing onensive in tne message tor me
radicals to make a handle on, but that
it entirely repudiates the President's
test oath and foreign policy.
The Whig says the message counsels
no resistance to the measures of Con
gress, and that it ia -virtually a recog
nition of the acts of Congress.
The Times savs that the messaco is
temperate and firm, and that while it
concedes nothing to the wild beasts of
hphesus, it noes not exasperate them
by unnecessary or untimely denuncia-1
tiocs.
Cocksb of Prices. According to a
table prepared for the New York Com-
mercial Advertiser, the aggregate prices
of twenty leading commodities, such as
flour, corn, coffee, coa), cotton, iron,
leather, molasses, salt, wool, &c, &c,
re 105 per cent, above the average of
IsOU. .Reducing current prices to gold,
the advance is found to be within a
fraction of 50 per cent, upon six years
ago. The quotations are for the 23d of
November, 18C6. Except upon bread
stuffs, iron and bides, tho quotations
are generally considerably lower than
in January; and as the extraordinary
prices of breadstuff's must be considers J
as but temporary, it would scarcely be
proper to retard the advance 111 those
commodities as counterbalancing the
decline in otheis. Moreover, the de
cline in prices of many kinds of man
ufactured goods exceeds the rat-s upon
the M;i nles above quoted, it being
peculiarity in the present condition
trade that the excess of production
runs rather upon manumciurea pro
ducts than upon fixd commodities and
raw materials.
I'he' marriage of Miss H. R. A
was conducted in. Lutheran styl. at
church, with tbn exneption of ; Nor
tvffinn riistorri. vir. : In Norway th
blideuroom first, futers Ui church with
some brother or d.v.r f; ;ittd who places
him for tho ceremony; then follows
the bride with father, hi other or guar
d:at, who iilacf-s her by th s:de of the
bridegroom. Tbe semi-circle of the
altar was adorned with flowers inter
spersed with lighted cAudleM. The bride
and bridegroom sit during tha dLcourse
just in Irontol the altar; tneir imme
diate frisnds nave cnairs ptacea nrouna
the seini-circle in the chancel. Two
embroidered cushions, gifts of friends,
ure placed on the first step of the altar
for thn bride and bridegroom to kneel
upon while they are pronounced man

black gmvn and cap, offers a prayer,
and a woefully long exhortation. The

Masonic Jewels Stoles. In New
Hrk. cn Wednesday last, the. iron safe,
belonging to the St. John's Lodge,
that city, was opened by picking tne
lock and tbe iiacient jewels, consistm
of the Masonic insignia made of solid
silver, were stolen. I heir pecuniary
value was the least part of the loss,
since ihev had a histoiic interest and
peculiar associations which were prized
