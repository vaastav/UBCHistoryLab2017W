TAKE SINNFEIN PAPERS
Mr«. MacSwiney Says the Irish Have
Come to the Point Where They
Are "Calling Premier Lloyd
George's Bluff."
London.—Efforts to arrange a truce
In Ireland is the dominating topic of
the daily newspapers, which print
many rumors gathered in Dublin and
London. These show intense interest
in the situation, and a widespread
hope for definite results from the ex
changes of views now understood to
be going on.
Sir Hamar Greenwood, chief secre
tary for Ireland, declared emphatic
ally amidst cheers in the house of
commons that he was "convinced there
can be no truce, or successful advocacy
of a truce, jintil the extreme leaders
of the Irish republican army either
surrender and deliver their arms or
are arrested."
At a meeting of the Sinn Fein divi
sional council in Dublin during the
week end, reference was made to the
report that negotiations were proceed
ing between the Sinn Fein and the
English government, says the Central
News Dublin correspondent. It was
decided any person or persons discuss
ing terms of a settlement with a for
eign government, unless authorized by
the Irish republican parliament, is
guilty of treachery and that any such
negotiations and the refdlts thereof
tvill be repudiated by
'/be
people of
Ireland, the correspondent adds.
Documents Seized.
Liverpool.—Sensational Sinn Fein
documents alleged to deal with pur
chase of arms and munitions on a
great scale, are reported to have been
discovered during a raid at Seaforth.
Two young and stylishly attired Irish
girls were arrested.
Must Withdraw Troops.
New York.—England must withdraw
all British troops from Ireland and lib
erate all political prisoners as a pre
liminary to restore peace in Ireland,
Eammon de Valera, "president of the
Irish republic," declares in a statement
relative to the message dispatched to
Premeir Lloyd George concerning the
premier's initial steps leading to peace.
"Removal of the aggression, obvi
ously is both the initial and also the
final step—that is, as I have said, the
whole essence of the trouble."
Mrs. Muriel MacSwiney, comment
ing on the message to Lloyd George,
said:
"To use a slang expression I have
learned since coming to America, I
think the Irish are balling Lloyd
George's bluff."
HARDING MEETING LEADERS
Public Curious as to Who Will Meet
President-Elect,
Washington.—Many of the questions
which President Wilson went to Paris
to settle are today almost as unsettled
as they were then and those questions
which have been the burden of the
last two years of domestic and inter
national politics will again be the prin
cipal question that Senator Harding
will take up with the advisors he had
summoned to confer with him this
week. During these two past years
forces of nature and the laws of eco
nomics have made some little progress
toward healing, but the statesmen and
the politicians have been less success
ful.
The public curiosity is chiefly intent
on whom Senator Harding has chosen
to come to see him and talk with him,
and is focused on finding out what the
president-elect says to his callers. But
no less importance attaches to what
the callers say to Mr. Harding.
ARGENTINE MAKES PROBLEM
Assembly at Geneva Labors to Make
Machinery Go.
Geneva.—Plans for co-operation on
technical organizations of the League
of Nations by representatives of Ar
menia, and former Russian states,
though these states are admitted to
full memberships in the league have
been discussed by the assembly of the
•league. This was the principal item
on the agenda, having been brought
into prominence by the decision of the
committee on the admission of new
states.
Announcement has been made that
Honorio Pueyrredon, head of the Ar
gentine delegation which has with
drawn from the assembly of the
League of Nations, will leave Geneva
at once. It was said at the Argentine
headquarters that the rest of the' dele
gation would depart later.

Recommends Immediate Independence

Washington President Wilson's
concrete recommendations to congress
in his annual message were:
Revision of the tax laws, with
simplification of the income and
profits taxes.
Independence for the Philip
pines.
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in government, appro

The president did not endorse a
bonus for the soldiers.
Nowhere .did the president refer to
the League of Nations or the peace

ence in his opening when he quoted
Abraham Lincoln's "let us have faith
that right makes might and that faith
let us dare to do our duty as we un

Says Democracy Put to Test.
Democracy, the president said, "is
being put upon its final test."
"The old world," said he, "is just

of the principle of democracy and a
substitution of the principle of autoc
racy as asserted in the name but with

multitude. This is the time of all
others when democracy should prove
Its purity and its spiritual power to

the attempt to make this spirit pre
vail.
The president's message was trans
mitted by messenger, the president
adhering to his decision not to address
congress in person.
The president's message was not
read immediately in the senate which
waited until it had disposed of routine
business. Secretary Joseph Tumulty
was among the spectators in the sen
ate occupying a seat on the floor. Pub
lic galleries again were filled and sev
eral diplomats were present.
TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
President Wilson's annual message
to congress follows:
"When I addressed myself to per
forming the duty laid upon the presi
dent by the constitution to present to
you an annual report on the state of
union, I found my thought dominated
by an immortal sentence of Abraham
Lincoln's: 'Let us have faith that
right makes might, and in that faitn
let us dare to do our duty as we un
derstand it.'—A sentence immortal be
cause it embodies in a form of utter
simplicity and purity the essential faith
of the nation, the faith in which it
was conceived and the faith in which
it has grown to glory and power with
that faith and the birth of a nation
founded upon it came the hope into
the world that a new order would pre
vail throughout the affairs of mankind,
an order in which reason and right
would take precedence of coveteous
ness and force, and,
"I believe that I express the wish
and purpose of every thoughtful Amer
ican when I say that this sentence
marks for us in the plainest manner
the part we should play alike
in the arrangement of our domestic
affairs and in our exercise of influence
upon the affairs of the world. By this
faith, and by this faith alone, can the
world be lifted out of its present con
fusion and despair. It was this faith
which prevailed over the wicked force
of Germany. You will remember that
the beginning of the end of the war
came when the German people found
themselves face to face with the con
science of the world and reaiized that
right was everywhere arrayed against
the wrong that their government was
attempting to perpetrate. I think,
therefore, that it is true to say that
this was the faith which won the war,
Certainly this is the faith with which
our gallant men went into the field
and out on the seas to make sure of
victory.
Democracy Put to Test Now.
This Is the mission upon which de
mocracy came into the world. Democ
racy is an assertion of the right of the
Individual to live and to be treated
Justly as against any attempt on the
part of any combination of individuals
Exercise Can Be Overdone.
There is a great deal of falsity about
the assumed value of exercise in the

ord., In moderation, that is within the

to make laws which will overburden
him or whftsh will destroy bis equality
among his fellows in the matter of
right or privilege, and I think we all
realize that the day has come when de
mocracy is being put upon its final
test. The old world is just now suffer
ing from a wanton rejection1 of the
principle of democracy and a substitu
tion of the principle of autocracy as
asserted in the name, but without the
authority and sanction of the multi
tude. This is the time of all others
when democracy should prove its pur
ity and its spiritual power to prevail.
It is surely the manifest destiny of the
United States to lead in the atteimpt
to make this spirit prevail.
Points Way for America.
There are two ways in which the
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object first, by offering the
example within her own borders of the
will and power of democracy to make
and enforce laws which are unques
tionably just and which are equal in
their administration—laws which se
cure its full rights to labor and yet at
the same time safeguard the integrity
of property, and particularly of that
property which is devoted to the devel
opment of industry and the increase of
the necessary wealth of the world.
Second, by standing for right and Jus
tice as toward individual nations. The
law of democracy is for the protection
of the weak, and the influence of
every democracy in the world should
be for the protection of thq weak na
tion, the nation which is struggling
toward its rights and toward its prop
er recognition and privilege in the
family of nations. The United States
cannot refuse this role of champion
without putting the stigma of rejec
tion upon the great and devoted men
who brought its government into ex
istence and established it in the face
of almost universal opposition and In
trigue, even in the face of wanton
force as, for example, against the or
ders in council of Great Britain and
the arbitrary Napoleonic decrees
which involved us in what we know
as the war of 1812. I urge you to con
sider that the display of an immediate
disposition on the part of congress to
remedy any injustices that may have
shown themselves in our own national
life will afford the most effectual off
set to the forces of chaos and tyranny
which are playing so disastrous apart
in the fortunes of the free peoples of
more than one part of the world. The
United States is of necessity the sam
ple democracy of the world, and the
triumph of democracy depends upon
its success.
Urges Early Budget Law.
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the late
war has been exceedingly slow on the
other side of the water and has given
promise, I venture to say of early com
pletion only in our own fortunate
country, but even with us the recovery
halts and is impeded at times and
there are immediately serviceable acts
of legislation which it seems to me we
ought to attempt, to assist that recov
ery and prove the indestructible recup
erative force of a great government of
the people. One of these is to prove
that a great democracy can keep house
as successfully and in as businesslike
a fashion as any other government. It
seems to me that the first step towards
proving this is to supply ourselves
with a systematic method of handling
our estimates and expenditures and
bringing them to the point where they
will not be an unnecessary strain upon
our income or necessitate unreason
able taxation, in other words a work
able budget system, and I respectfully
suggest that two elements are essential
to such a system namely, not only
that the proposal of appropriations
should be in the hands of a single body
such as a single appropriations com
mittee in each house of the con
gress, but also that this body
should be brought into such co-opera
tion with the departments of the gov
ernment and with the treasury of the
United States as would enable it to
act upon a complete conspectus of the
needs of the government and the re
sources from which it must draw its
income.
Explains Veto Action.
I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill
passed by the last session of the con
gress because of a constitutional objec
tion. The house of representatives
subsequently modified the bill in order
to meet this objection. In the revised
form I believe the bill coupled with
action already taken by the congress
to revise its rules and procedure fur
nishes the foundations for an effective
national budget system. I earnestly
hope that one of the first steps taken
by the present session of the congress
will be to pass the budget bill
Finances Show Improvement.
The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the last
year. The total ordinary receipts of
$6,694,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920
exceeded those for 1919 by $1,542,000,
000, while the total net ordinary ex
penditures decreased from $18,514,000,•
000 to $6,403,000,000, The gross public
debt, which reached its highest point
on Aug. 31, 1919, when it was $26,596,
000,000, had dropped on Nov. 30, 1920,
to $24,175,000,000. There also has been
a marked decrease in holdings of gov
ernment war securities by the banking
institutions of the country as well as
in the amount of bills held by the fed
eral reserve banks secured by govern
ment war obligations. This fortunate
result has relieved the banks and left
them freer to. finance, the needs, of agri
culture, industry and commerce.' It
has been due In large part .'to' the re
duction of the public debt, especially
Qf the floating debt, but more particu
larly to the improved distribution of
government securities among perman
ent investors. The cessation of the
government's borrowing except thru
short term certificates of indebtedness
Mu*lo Increases Output.
Tradsplantlng rice in the Philippines
costs about 40 centavos a day, with
two meals, cigarettes and betel nut, but
when music Is provided the output of
work is' increased 30 per cent, says the
New York Medical Journal. It Is often
a blln^man who plays. He sits on the
low dyke and sings the old folk songs
to his guitar, and frequently fhe work
ers Join in the chorus. Some of the
large stores in the States also tried the
affect of music with good result!,
has been matter of great Consequence
to the people of the country at large,
as well as to the holders of Liberty
Bonds and"Victory notes, and has had
an important bearing on the Matter
of effective credit control. The year
has been characterised by the progres
sive withdrawal of the treasury from
the domestic credit market and from
a position of dominant Influence In
that market. The future course will
necessarily depend upon the extent to
which economics are practised and up
on the burdens placed upon the treas
ury, as well as upon industrial develop
ments and the maintenance of tax re
ceipts at a sufficiently high level.
Urges Strictest Economy.
"The fundamental fact which at
present dominates the government's
financial situation is that seven and a
half billions of its war Indebtedness
mature within the next two and a half
years. Of this amount, two and a
half billions are floating debt and five
billions Victory notes ahd War Sav
ings certificates. The fiscal program
of the government must be determined
with reference to these maturities.
Sound policy demands that the gov
ernment expenditures be reduced to
the lowest amount which will permit
the various services to operate effi
ciently and that government receipts
from taxes and salvage be maintained
sufficiently high to provide for current
requirements, including interest and
sinking fund charges on the public
debt, and at the same time retire the
floating debt and part of the Victory
loan before maturity. With rigid Econ
omy, vigorous salvage operatipns and
adequate ^revenues from taxation, a
surpl^ of current receipts over cur
rent expenditures can* be realized and
should be applied to the floating debt.
All branches of the government should
co-operate to see that this program Is
realized.
Appropriations Cut Held Needed.
I cannot over emphasize the neces
sity of economy in government appro
priations and expenditures and the
avoidance by the congress of -practices
which take money from the treasury
by indefinite or revolving fund appro
priations. The estimates for the pres
ent year phow that over a billion dol
lars of expenditures were authorized
by the last congress in addition to
the amounts shown in the usual com
piled statements of appropriations.
This strikingly Illustrates the im
portance of making direct and specific
appropriations. The relation between
the current receipts and current ex
penditures of the government during
the present fiscal year, as well as dur
ing the last half of the last fiscal year,
has been distributed by the extraordi
nary burdens thrown upon the treas
ury by the transportation act, in con
nection with the return of the railroads
to private control. More than $600,
000,000 has already been paid to the
railroads under this act—$350,000,000
during the present fiscal year and
it is estimated that further payments
aggregating possibly $650,000,000 must
still be made to the railroads during
the current year. It is obvious that
these large payments have already
seriously limited the government's
progress in retiring the floating debt.
Asks Tax Law Revision.
Closely connected with this, it seems
to me, is the necessity for an immedi
ate consideration of the revision of
our tax laws. Simplification of the
income tax and profits has become
an immediate necessity. These taxes
performed an indispensable service,
during the war. The need for their
simplification, however, Is very great,
in order to save the taxpayer incon
venience and expense, and in order to
make his liability more certain and
definite. Other and more detailed rec
ommendations with regard to taxes
will no doubt be laid before you by
the secretary of the treasury and the
commissioner of internal revenue.
Urges Soldiers' Rehabilitation.
It is my privilege to draw to the at
tention of congress for very sympa
thetic consideration the problem of
providing adequate facilities for the
Care and treatment of former mem
bers of the military and naval forces
who are sick or disabled as the result
of their participation in the war. These
heroic men can never be paid in
money for the service they patriotical
ly rendered the nation. Their reward
will lie rather in realization of the
fact that they vindicated the rights
of their country and aided in safe
guarding civilization. The nation's
gratitude must be effectively revealed
to them by the most ample provision
for their medical care and treatment
as well as for their vocational training
and placement. The time, has come
when a more complete program can
be formulated and more satisfactorily
administered for their treatment and
their training, and I earnestly urge
that the congress give the matter its
early consideration. The secretary of
the treasury and the board of voca
tional education will outline in their
reports proposals covering medical
care and rehabilitation which I am
sure will engage your earnest study
and command your most generous sup
port.
Living Cost Legislation Asked.
Permit me once more to emphasize
the need for action upon certain mat
ters upon which I dwelt at some, length
in my message to the second session
of the sixty-sixth congress: The ne
cessity for example of encouraging the
manufacture of dyestuffs and related
chemicals the importance of doing
everything possible to promote agricul
tural production along economic lines
to improve agricultural marketing and
to make rural life more attractive and
healthful the need for a law regulat
ing cold storage in such a way as to
limit the time during which goods may
be kept in storage, prescribing the
method of disposing of them if kept
beyond the permitted period and re­
\y Put Body Above Soul.,.
In 8000 and 4000 B. G. the Egyptians

quiring goods released from storage
in all cases to bear the data of their
receipt.
Favors Marking Market Prloe.
It would also be most serviceable If
it were. provided that all goods re
leased from cold storage tor Interstate
shipment should have plainly marked
upon each package the selling or mar
ket price at which, they, went into stor
age, In order that the purchaser lplght
be ablo to learn what profits stood be
tween him ahd the. producer or the
wholesale dealer. Indeed, it would be
very serviceable to the public if all
goods destined for Interstate com
merce were'made to carry upon every
packing case whose form made It pos
sible a plain statement of the prlpe
at which they left the hands of the
producer. I respectfully call your at
tention, also, to the recommendations
of the message referred to with regard
to a federal license, for all. corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce.
In brief, the immediate legislative
need of thd time is the removal of all
obstacles to the realization of the best
ambitions of our people in their sev
eral classes of employment and the
strengthening of all Instrumentalities
by which difficulties are to be met
and removed and justice dealt out,
whether by law or by some form of
mediation and conciliation. I do not
feel it to be my privilege at present
to suggest the detailed and particular
methods by which these, objects may
be attained, but I have faith that the
inquiries of your several committees
will discover the way and the method.
Asks Loan for Armenia.
In response, to what I believe to be
the impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout the United StateB, I earn?
estly suggest that the congress auth
orize the treasury of the United States
to make to the struggling government
of Armenia such a loan as was made
to several of the Allied governments
during the war and I would also sug
gest that it would be desirable to pro
vide in the legislation itself that the
expenditure of the money thus loaned
Bhould be under the supervision of a
commission, or at least a commission
er, from, the United States, in order
that revolutionary tendencies within
Armenia itself might not be afforded
by the loan a further tempting oppor
tunity.
Philippines' Independence Proposed.
Allow me to call your attention to
the fact that the people of the Philip
pine Islands have succeeded in main
taining a stable government since the
last action of the congress in their be
half, and have thus fulfilled the condi
tion set by the congress as precedent
to a consideration of granting inde
pendence to the islands. I respectfully
submit that this condition precedent
having been fulfilled, it is now our
liberty and our duty to keep our prom
ise to the people of those islands by
granting them the independence which
they so honorably covet.
Closed With Valedictory.
I have not so much laid bef&re you
a series of recommendations, gentle
men, as sought to utter a confession
of faith, of the faith in which I was
bred and which it is my solemn pur
pose to stand by until my last fighting
day. I believe this to be the faith of
America, the faith of the 'future, and
of all the victories which await na
tional action in the days to come,
whether in America or elsewhere.
BOYS CONFESS TO MURDER
Three Youths Admit Holdup of Min
neapolis Grocer.
Minneapolis—Three boys, the oldest
of them 20 .years of age, have con
fessed killing James A. Borte, who
was shot in an attempted holdup at his

Two of the boys are brothers, Percy
Balmes, 18 years old, and Donald
Balmes, 20 years old. The third and
youngest member of the trio is Rouel
Carlson, 17 years old.
From all three, J. F. Walker, chief

showed that Percy Balmes did the
shooting. The confession was ob
tained after several hours of question
ing. The Balmes brothers were the
first arrested after a citizen apqpared
at police headquarters and gave an ac
count of the affair which he is reported
to have obtained from friends to whoin
the boys had talked. The police have
not revealed the name of their In
formant.
