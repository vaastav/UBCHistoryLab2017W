t. THE CLEVELAND VAGARIES.
There sre insane people who insist
that they are perfectly sane, and that
all the rest of mankind are mad. There
are very many callow youths who es
teem lightly the experience of age, and
claim to "know it all." There are
all-knowing men, who are so imbued
with their own consequence, that their
thick skulls are ever impervious to
penetration by the light of reason.
There are men who simply have no
tions, and think they have ideas.
But the truth remains that the in
sane man is still insane. The youth is
still callow. The self-esteemed and all
knowing one still has his thick skull,
(which is not backbone after all), and
the man who mistakes notions for ideas
is still without the needed brains
with which togenerate the ideas.
About eight years ago Grover Cleve
land in his celebrated message, launch
ed his notions on the tariff, of which
a year before he confessed he knew but
little. His party took up the cry, and
with a mighty shout, followed the new
flight. The campaigns "of education
Commenced. The people were "hoo
flooed." returned Mr. Cleveland to the
White House and gave him a Congress
of hflfco'wn «lection along with him.
The rasuifc was, the panic of 1893 and
the sickening business heartache of
1894, whtqh has cost the people of this
country more money than did the civil
war.. 1
But, Mr. Cleveland is not yet satis
fied. The country has not yet been
sufficiently disgusted by tariff tinker
ing. H9 wants mare. And it is not
enough to keep the people in a furore
over the tariff, he and Mr. Carlisle
have some more vagaries on the cur
rency, which if permitted to be put
into practice, will prove as disasterous
as his tariff craziness. But so far, the
people have not contemplated this late
message with much seriousness, for
it is not believed that the present Con
gress, for the few weeks it will be in
existance, will be able to agree on any
thing. The people have settled down
to a patient waiting for Mr. Cleveland's
exit, and few tears will be shed when
he goes.

A bill to repeal the Income Tax
law was the first to be presented to
Congresss.

Silver is speech but Silence is
Gold." Mr. Cleveland evidently had
this in mind when he preserved such
remarkable silence on tlie recent elec
tions in his last message. But there
was really nothing for him to say, and
he said it.
We can truly say of the President's
Message, "If its length benot its merit
it hath no other.
We presume, how
ever, Prof. Wilson is pleased with it,
Mr. Catching likewise, but the rest of
the country receives it with apathy.
It did not make any stir in Congress,
and with the exception of a volley of
condemnation from the press of the
country it seems to be almost ignored.
It i-' a very dull, humdrum, uninterest
ing document, lacking either vigor or
brilliancy, and so far as any distinctive
originality is concerned it is not to be
mentioned with the "perfidy and dis
honor" letter. The President had a
duty to perform and he did it in a very
perfunctory manner.
The Sunday opening of Saloons is
being much discussed in New York
City. The Devil seems a little harder to
down in Gotham than in most places!
After such an overwhelming victory
for good morals and good government
it is surprising that there should be
such activity in favor of Sunday sell
ing of liquor: Ministers are preaching
against it hut some of the newspapers
and many citizens are declaring in
favor of it, pleading for the rights
of the saloon men and their
patrons, and declaring that because the
present Excise law is not enforced, it is
impracticable, and that lawful Sunday
selling is belter than unlawful Sunday
selling I But the sentiment that
finds a lodgement in the most enlight
ened minds and hearts is, dise the
saloon not only on Sunday, but every
day and the greatest foe to good govern
ment and morality will be removed.
It is certainly not to the credit of STew
York City that many of her so-called
leading men claiming to be reformers
are favoring Sunday selling. The ex
isting evils would be increased mani
fold if t)>e present Exci. e law, irrprac«
>
Ü
ticable as it is claimed to be, should be
replaced with legalized Sunday selling,
The liquor question is one of the vital
questions of the hour. IIow to deal
with it wisely and well is one of the
must difficult problems this great na
tion has to face. We are persuaded that
the Dispensary law that has made the
name of Governor Tillman, of South
Carolina, to be known throughout the
country, is a step in the direction of
the final overthrow of the saloon.

WASHINGTON DETTER.
_
Washington, Dec. 3d, 1884:— I
Congressis with us again! And a very
much sadder and a somewhat wiser
Congress it is than it was when it ad
journed last August. One who saw
the ending of tue last and the begin
ning of the present session and who
was entirely ignorant of the interme
diate occurrences would not need to be
told that something important had
happened, and the faces of the Repub
licans and Democrats would give him |
an excellent clue to guess what that
something was. Proportionate to their
number there was a better attendance
of Republicans in both House and |
Senate than of Democrats. A witty
Democratic member of the House per
petrated the following just after the
Democratic ^chaplain had concluded 1
his opening prayer: "I say," he said in
a stage whisper, turning his head to
wards the member seated next to him,
"that fellow has an almighty poor
memory." "Why?" asked the gentle- .
man spoken to. "Why? Why great
Scott! he omitted to say a word about
the great November catastrophe, just
as though the loss of $5,000 a year by
such an awful lot of us was an insig- 1
nificant affair already forgotten. He'
should have given us a word or two of
religious consolation; we need it. The
contemplation of the loss of his own
job ought to have aroused his sympa

the warring factions of his party in
Congress get together amicably, his
wishes aie not made apparent by a bur
ried reading of his message. On the
contrary;the impression left upon one's
mind is that he merely offers them a
choice between accepting his views
and being kicked out of the party, and
that he doesu't care very much which
they choose. Already liiere are mu'.
