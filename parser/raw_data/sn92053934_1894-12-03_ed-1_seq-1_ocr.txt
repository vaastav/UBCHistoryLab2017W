Wamiinc.tox, Doc. S The prcsi-
.'.i-nt! annual message was read at
tiir cjioninj; of congress today. Re
..ir.linj; foreign affairs the president
:.!: "Tin' history of our recent
dra'injr with other nations, and
jva' iful relations with them at this
time, a'lilitionally demonstrates the
n ! vantage of consistently adhering
1 1 n firm ltit just foreign policy, free
from the environs of ambitious na
tional schemes, and characterized by
entire honesty and sincerity." The
jirc-i'lent recommends the repeal of
milch of the statute as imposes
tin' ilirriminating duty on sugars
cuming from countries paying ex
port bounty which is protested
s.'u'nst ly Germany as contraven
tion of the treaty with Prussia.
Iltnall and Blue Field.
In Hawaiian affairs, reference is
made to the matter being 'submitted
to the judgment and wider discretion
of congress." Reviewing the Blue
I'ii-lds incidents, the president says:
We cannot challenge rightful sov
ereignty of Nicaragua over important
part of her domain." Touching

in the recommendation for the con.
-trm'iion of additional battle ships
and torpedo Ixiats. Coming to the
jwtision division of the interior de
partment, the president says: "The

Iraiuli is evident unfriendliness
toward our worthy veterans, and the
" uial of their claims to the gener

"fortunate indifference to the com-iii-sion
of any offense which has for

The president makes a strong ar
'-' nit-nl in favor of the extension of
1 vi! service, and endorses the report
'' tin? strike commission. Continn-!nJ-
he Fays: The tariff act passed
a' tde last session of congress needs
'oportant amendments if it is to be
' "'Mi ted effectually and with cer
ain'.y. Additional to such necessary
''l.etidmcnts as will change the rates
"! 'I'i'y. I am decidedly in favor of
"tine coal and iron ore upon the

i ' i. concerned, I would be glad un
' ' r the existing aggravation to see
1 Try particle of differential duty in
' 'Vor of nelined sugar stricken out of
""r tariff law. If, with all the favor
""w accorded the sugar refining in
'rests in our tariff luws, it still lan--iijnhcs
to the extent of closing the

'a' a hopeless case for reasonable

oonds the premium received is oner-
than J y h Rvern"ent to less

worse or farther removed from sen
sible finance than the relations exist
ing between the government eur-
redemption, and means of redemption
,Tpa,'red- Even"the claims
upon this fund were confined to obli
gaUons originally intended, and if
the redemption of these obligations
meant the cancellation of the fund,
it would be very small. But these
obligations, when received and re
deemed in gold, are not cancelled,
but reissued, and made to do
duty many times bv wav tf
drawing the gold from' the treas
ury. Thus we have an endless
chain in operation, constantly deplet
ing the treasury's gold, and never at
final rest. The demand that in
creased our danger also increased the
necessity of protecting this reserve
against depletion, and it is most un
satisfactory to know that the pro
tection afforded is only a temporarv
palliation, and, it is perfectly anil
palpably plain that the onlv wav, un
der present conditions, bv which this
reserve when dangerously depleted
can be replenished, is through the
issue aud sale of tfce bonds of the
government for gold. While con
gress has not only thus far declined
to authorize the "issue of bonds best
suited to such a purpose, there
seems a disposition in some quarters
to deny both the necessity and
power for the issue of bonds at all. I
cannot for a moment believe anv of
our citizens deliberately willing
their government should default in
its pecuniary obligation, or its finan
cial operations should be reduced to
the silver basis. At any rate, I
should not feel my duty done if I
omitted any effort I could make to
avert such a" calamity.
The Nation's Credit Will be Maintained.
"As long therefore as no provision
is made for the final redemption or
putting aside of a currency obliga
tion now used repeatedly and con
stantly drawing from the government
its gold, and as long as no better au
thority for the bonds issue is allowed
than at present exists, such authori
ty will be utilized whenever and as
often as it becomes necessary to
maintain a sufficient gold reserve and
in abundant time to save the credit
of our country ftnJke.raMj.kP.'
uuaociai uecraranou oi our govern
ment. The question relating: to onr
bunks and currency is closely con
nected with the subject jo st referred
to, and they also presented some sat
isfactory features, rromlnent among
tbem are lack of elasticity in our
ourrency circulation, and it is a fre
quent concentration in financial cen
ters when it is needed in other parts
of the country.
New Policy froinnU.
Absolute divorcement of the gov
ernment from the business of bank
ing is the ideal relationship of the
government to the circulation of the
currency of the oountry. This con.
dition cannot be immediately
reached, but as a step in that direction
and as a means of securing a more
elastic currency and obviating other
objections to present arrangements
of the banks'1 circulation, the secreta
ry of the treasury presents in his re
port a scheme for modifying the pres
ent banking laws, and providing for
the issue of circulating notes by me
state banks, free from taxation under
certain limitations. It proposes the
repeal of all laws providing for the
deposit of United States bonds
as security for the circu
lation, and permits the national
bank issue of circulating notes not
exceeding in amount 75 per cent of
their paid up and unimpaireu capi
tal, provided they deposit with the
government as a guarantee fund in
United Slates leiral tenner notes, .in
cluding the treasury notes of 1890, a
sum equal in amount to J0 per cent
of the notes they desire to issue, and
to rental the provisions oi tne pres
ent law imposing limitations and re
strictions upon the banics aesirinvo
reduce or increase their circulation;
thus permittinsr each an increase or
reduction of the limit of 75 per cent
of the capital to be quickly made as
an cmergenej- arises.
In addition to the guarantee fund
required, it is proposed to provide
safely a fund for the immediate re
dnnintion of the circulating botes- of
failed banks dv imposiug a omai. u
nual tax sav one-half of 1 per cent
nnon the" average circulation of
each bank, until the fund amounts to
5 per cent of the total circulation
outstanding."

man seeing the flames were loyond his
control rntdicd frantically from room to
mom to arouse the slopping boarders, all
of whom were in tho house at the time.
Before he hud completed tho rounds of
the rooms the house was filled with siuoko
aud the man had to fly for his life.
Mr Smith's Ikxly Found.
Tho fourth-story front room was occu
pied by Mrs. Smith and the middle room
on the same floor by Miss Cullenden. The
firemen were on the scene in a few min
utes, and at once turned their attention to
rescuing tho boarders on the third and
fourth floors. All of these on the third
floor were gotten out safely and he fire
men rushed to the fourth floor. They
triitl the doors of Mrs. Smith and Miss
Cullenden, but found both locked. The
doors were quiokly burst opn. Lying on
the floor in the front room was the iwdy
ot Mrs. Smith, partly wrapped in carpet,
which she had torn from the floor in her
agony. Sho had been suffocated by tho
smoke. Marks on tho windowsill showed
that she had mttde an effort to raise the
window, but it is supposed that in her
weak condition she could not get it up.
Miss Cullenden was found lying across
the bed in her room, having also fallen
from suffocation. Sho w:is dead when
reached by the firemen. There wire
many narrow cscaiics. Mr. and Mrs. 1L

from the building. E. L. Kaboug, whooc
cupied a fourth story baek room, had a
thrilling escape from suffocation. . I In saw
that his cseape down the stairwtiy was cut
off and gathering up his bed clothing
rushed to tho window and waved frantic
ally, endeavoring to attract the attention
of the firemen. Fireman Ratferry of en
gine No. 2 had by this time reached the
roof of the burning building and was at
tracted to the side of the building bv Uji-
tne situation at a guuiee. Ho rushed to
the ladder and, procuring a short piece of
rope, dropped it to liaboarg. The latter
realizing that tlds was the only means of
escape, clutched the slender strand and
was drawn upon tho roof by the sheer
strength of tho fireman. From the roof
he was taken down the ladder in safety.
The rear of the building was partially de
stroyed, involving a loss of a few thou
sand dollars.
