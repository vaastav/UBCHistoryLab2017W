Washington, D. C., Dec. 6,— -The scenes
attending the meeting and organization of
the House today were such ns nru .familiar to
all who have been attendants,upon the open
ing at .Congress. The.throng in tho hall of
the House was Very great, and an hour be
fore noon, the time of meeting, the press of
members, ex-members, department olllcers,
and aspirants for Uio minor unices was so
great that' movement* about tho /loor was
difficult. When Uio Doorkeepers of the
Democratic Administration that is about to
■surrender tho control of Uio House find
•cleared the floor of those not ’ entitled
to Us privileges, Uiere still remained about
the outer, edge of the hall, behind the bur, a
.thick, black fringe of people composed of ex
members, tho officials of the dead Congress,
and Uio nominees for Uio new offices.
THE OAU.ERir.S
were densely packed. The members' ’ gal
leries were as full as those devoted to the
general public, tho wives of the nstv mem
bers being attracted by tho novelty of tho
scene, and the wives of .tho old members
having come to look upon familiar faces.
Tho diplomatic gallery alone showed that
the,opening of u new Congress was not the
only charm of Washington life, for it was
nearly empty. . ; :
At 13 o'clock George M. Adams,* Clerk of
the FoJty-sj.vtlj Congress, acting under tho
mandate ot the Constitution, called tho House
to order, Tho old members, through force
of habit, took tho seats which they had oc
cupied In tho old' Concrcss, and those who
had good ones hoped that tho chances of lot
would allow them to retain them. The new
•members generally sat near tho old members
from their State delegations.

then went monotonously forsvnnl. There
was but one thing to do, which was to ascot
by tlio roll-call, whether a quorum of
members was present. In order that that quo*
rum might proceed to tho further organiza
tion of the House. .Ponding tho roll-call, the
,bur.z nud hum of voices was so great that the
Citric often had to suspend and rap for order
that he might hear tho responses.* There was
much anxiety manifested among Kepubllc
aus as to the futo of Edward McPherson, the
caucus nominee for Clerk. Thoro hail been
noisy threats on tho part of Jtussoll Errett
amt Sam Harr that Uiby would, as they termed
It, give him (McPherson) *'a dose of Ids own
medicine,” and, Inasmuch ns he had Just
chosen to bolt tho regular ticket hr Pennsyl
vania ami to support Wolf, they, In turn,
would decline now to support .
.TUETKADITIOKAI.KNBWV OKTHKCAMEItON’S,
and one of the most earnest opponents of Urn
uultruleaudthoPennsylvania machine. Tim
fact that Sum Harr eat in his seat hi earnest
consultation with Kusscil Errett, and that
Barr did not take oil Ids overcoat, and kept
ids hat and gloves upon the desk, added to
the Kupubllcaus’ apprehension. He seemed
to be in readiness to start nf any moment,
but ho staid, and all the Pennsylvania mem
bers staid, and subsequently ate their own
words and voted for McPherson, us will ap
pear later from die proceedings. The de
feated candidates for Speaker sat for the
most pnrtlnthe seats which they occupied in
die last Congress, and Mr. Kassou looked
quite natural .In Uie old scat which he had
occupied lu the .Forty-ilfth. There was
what the preachers would perhaps call u
chastened look about Urn focus of ail the do
feated candidates, save that of the ruddy,
open, boyish
Mil* HEED,
who was as Jolly ana genial and full of fun
as ever, Air. Kassoh was dignified and
grave, and the few tilings which lie did say
during the day Indicated very clearly dmtho
speedily wjll come to the front and lend the
House, from the Hoor, If not from tho chair.
There were baskets of (lowers or bouquets
■upon die desks of many members, but nuue
were upon the desks of those who most
needed consolation, except that Air. Dumioll
alone, of die Speakership candidates, had
. Ids desk covered with two largo baskets of lino
dowers, one less Hum bis number of votes
'.upon the lost ballot. The discrepancy in a
short time was discovered, for, soon after
.die House had opened, u, third basket was
placed upon Air, Duunoll’s desk, one basket
for- eooh of his faithful supporters. It he
had had more votes his dusk would not have
been mfge enough to have held the baskets.
Among the other members whoso desks were
ornamented by flowers through the enthusi
asm of their constituents, die courtesy of die
ladies; or drafts Upon die floral contingents
at the Government greenhouse of the mem
bers themselves wem. Judge Kelley, of
Pennsylvania, who read hU newspapers and
disregarded the bouquet; Hyuu. of Kansas,
whose high, shining forehead could Just be

basket; and’ Towy Young, of Ohio, who

were no flowers..' Tho party had gone out of

The coming Speaker was dressed in immacu
late black, his ITlnco Albert coat being
tightly buttoned over his breast. There
sauntered up to him,'ns ho sat Ihoro, a flno
looklhg, easy mannered man, larger of frame,
dressed with careless neatness, who slapped
Idmontha shoulder. Kelfor grasped his
hand and the two stood there chatting for a
few moments.
MU. lIIRCOCK,
for It was he, scented ns hearty, ns coidlnl in
greeting, ns though lie had been one of Keif
er's most* ardent supporters Instead of his
strongest opponent in tho Speakership can
vass. Over on tho Democratic side a smalt
gentleman with closely-buttoned coat, upon
the breast of which dangled a gold eye-glass,
was entertaining a group of members. Hu
was telling them of the wonderful scenes lie
lind witnessed the past summer up near tho
north coast of Xorwdy, of his wanderings
among tho tombs of Bible heroes. Tills was
sunskt cox, v
and by tho bursts of laughter which wore
heard from tho galleries we knew Hint Cox
was enlivening his sketches with ills
customary flow of wit Thu Into Speak
er of the House, Hnmlull, wiio
had Just como down the aisle with Ids
waist circumscribed by Robeson's arm, took
a scat near the front row, put oil his glasses,
ana began busily to examine papers. He was
not allowed very much opportunity. Tho
new members of botii parties seemed anxious
to make ids acquaintance, and they were
brought uu to his scat ono after another and
introduced by mutual friends.
A TAT.L YOUNG MAX
dressed with great taste in morning costume,
whose heavy brown mustache could not con
ceal a pleasant smile, was introduced by Sun
set Cox. Tills was tho late Controller WitUs
worth, of Now York. Randall delayed Wads
worth some moments in conversation.
Gen. Sherman nt that time en
tered the main door In his quick,
nervous way, glancing over tho house and
then slipping into the seat formerly occu
pied by his old opponent in tho field. Gen.
Joe Johnston. The members of Uie new and
old House crowded around tbo General nf
Uiu Army, and it seemed to please him as
much as it always does when this is done.
Meanwhile Gen. Joe Johnston himself was
moving around amongst his friends, con
spicuous by reason of a very light-colored
overcoat. Ho met Sherman. They shook
hands and sat down In the must brother
ly fashion, sldo by side. Thu pages commenced
to run to and fro, bearing messages, curds,
and letters. The doorkeepers came down the
aisles with big bouquets and floral decora
tions. and as Uicy moved through Uie swarm
ing throng the fiowers they bore touched up
Uio sombre color with an effect which
seemed from Uie gallery kaleidoscopic.
THE HUM OF HUNDREDS OF VOICES
grew louder, laughter and hilarity were In
one corner, while around the desk of Uio
sharp-voiced Reed of Maine was a group of
members who seemed to bo discussing with
tho utmost seriousness some proposition
which Heed had made.
• TUK KOIBE I.VCIIBABED
ns the hour of 1- drew near, find It scorned to
bo Impossible to bring with ono stroke of the
pnvcl order out of sucli confusion—lobbyists
rushing lilthor ami tliither, newspaper cor
respondents buttonholing members, constit
uents seeking out their member and boring
him with nil sbrts of requests, ofllcers of the
House hurrying to and fro on various
errands,'members dlflldently socking seats or
looking up acquaintances, imges skipping
like grasshoppers under tho arms and some
times almost under tho legs of members,*
men with claims, cranks with nil sorts of
petitions, politicians with schemes, seedy
men, clegmitly-dressed gentleman—all these
appeared ou the floor in ono heterogeneous
mass, from which came a most confusing
and eur-torturlng sound. But, as If by magic,
when Cleric Adams rapped on tho desk order
was evolved from chaos.
TIIK HOUfIK AS A WHOLE
seems to comparo favorably In general no
pearnuco with that which was adjourned on
tho 4th of last .March. Some faces which
have not been scon for some time were
noticed today. Thoro was Knsson—tall, cold
In manner, changed but little In his four
years’ absence abroad, seated in an Incon
spicuous place far toward tho rear, Thoro
was Holman, of Indiana, of whom so much
Is expected, his desk already lumbered with
books and papers, as though he left it only
yesterday. Thoro was A. S. Hewitt, whoso
beard seems move heavily tinged with gray
than when last here, but who was apparently
In better health than then, a mmrwhoso ex
ceeding paleness of complexion was all Urn
more marked by reason of the Jetty black
ness of Ids beard and hair. A slight, deli
cate member took tho seat of his predeces
sor, Mr. Frye, of Maine. This was
KJi-noV. \RI.KOK DINOI.KY.
Seated near Mr. Hewitt was Mr. Flower, who ■
conducted thosuccussfukcanvass agalnsiMr.
Astor. The youthful member from the War
ren County District of Hew Jersey, Mr. Har
ris, was almost concealed behind the
inassfvo llguro of Mr. Klotz. Mr. Skin
ner, the successor of Warner Miller,
was sheltered under tho wing of Anson Mc-
Cook. Hobeson, whoso blushes seem per
petual. arose, and, with a decidedly sten
torian tone, nominated Air. Kelfor for
Speaker. Air. Uammll was nominated by Mr.
House, and Mr. Murch, of Maine, nominated
Mr. Ford, of Missouri. The ballot which
followed, of course, elected Mr. Kelfor by
two votes more than a quorum of the House,
it seemed us if
SIU. UAN DALI. AND MH. IIISCOCU
must have had a prescience of what Air.
Adams, fitter announcing did election of Air.
Kelfor, would suy, for, when Air. Adams
designated as an escort for conducting
the Speaker to tho chair the two
member Just named, by a remarkable coinci
dence both of those gentlemen were found
to be standing by Mr. Kelfer’s side. Each of
tho gentlemen seized the now (Speaker by an
unn, and, thus protected, the three marched
down the central aisle. Air. Kelfor seemed
In doubt as to which at the two gentlemen
he should keep In step with, and Ills ullorts
towards t harmonious movement were nut
helped on by the numerous steps which It
was necessary to descend In order
to reach die Speaker's desk. Air. Ban
dull looked stern and dignified during
this ceremony, but Air. Hlscook seemed
to have detected something humorous In it.
Mr. Kelfor ascended the platform, drew
from his vest pocket a wad of note paper,
unfolded It, and read, la die tremulous voice
of a frightened school boy on declamation
day, a speech which must have been com
posed In a hurry.
THKitB WAH A GROUP OP pOLOtIRT) MEN
about the door of tbo House that was pota*
bl.e and conspicuous. Among tnem was ex*
ilepresentatlve llalnoy, of South Carolina,
defeated candidate for Clerk of the House,
who evidently U greatly disappointed, and
who thinks that the Jlepubllcou party has
not treated him falrlv in rejecting him, after
having given him the caucus noiduatluh iu
the last Congress, There wotnflSpe, ex*
Senator fioiu Mississippi, now PSlster.of

Mississippi, where he Is ruponmgto have
really aided Luinar Jo secure a fMJoetloji. Jt
wasudebt, yt political gratitude, possibly,
on the part of Uruce, as Lamar did much for
him. There was Hubert Smalls, ot South
Carolina, as black a colored man as ever sat
in Congress,.who .was noted fur his heroic
conduct during Jihe War hi piloting a Gov
ernment vessel out of Charleston harbor
under Uebel tiring, and who but recently has

been the; victim of Bourbon oppression in
his State. Ho is a contestant for one of the
South Carolina seals, to which ho undoubt
edly was elected, ami is hero In person to
watch Ids contest. There was Lynch, of
Mississippi, of the Shoestring District, who
is awaiting the action of the Republicans to
placo'ldm In Uie scat to which ho is entitled,
which
cn.vr.MKus sow wrongfully occupiks.
The spirit of thb Republicans was pretty
clearly manifested, later in the day, In the
vigorous objections which wuro made to Ids
being seated, notwithstanding Ills prln’m
facia certificate was regular. It was very
evident, from the determined opposition
made today by the Republicans in the
Chalmers and the Mnckoy-O’Connor cases,
that the Elections Committee Istohoonc of
the lending committees in tho new House,
and that, before many weeks are over. It may
confidently be expected that tho Republican
majority will be increased. Tho roll-call
was interrupted to permit Clerk Adams to
correct ono ludicrous mistake fn preparing
the roil. Ho had Inserted in tho New Hamp
shire delegation the name of tho Governor
of the State who signed the certificate as tho
Representative from the Second District,
and had left oft tho name of the Representa
tive himself. About the floor were many
distinguished persons. Mr. Thompson, ex-
Secretary of the Navy, was there, and was
there perhaps to learn to his mortifica
tion (hat Ids successor had taken
tho side of the Democrats In tho
lost House, and had denounced the Choriqul
land-claim, which was so great a pot of Mr.
Thompson's administration. Mr. Ambrose
Thompson's' speculative project Is likely
once more to prove unsuccessful. There was
Cllsby, of Michigan, the old Reading Clerk,
who went out’from the House with-Mr. Mc
-I'hcrson, and who Is to come back ngaltf to
his old place with McPherson, and whoso
clear, familiar voice will doubtless be heard
from Ids old place nt the desk tomorrow.
There wore a good many ox-members whoso
only occupation in Washington is known as
that of Kings atul Princes of tho lobby.
Finally the long, tedious roll-call was com
pleted, and the Clerk announced that there
was a quorum present. Thu Republicans
observed with some relict that there were
THIIEE DEMOCRATIC MKMHEIIS AHSF.NT,
a fact which made it more probable that,
even should some of Uie Pennsylvania Re
publicans fulfill their threats of bolting, the
Republican caucus nominee for Clerk might
still be elected. Two of the Democratic al>-
scnlees were Ledpold Morse, of .Boston, ami
Duuster, of Milwaukee, Uie latter having ton
long delayed Ids return from Europe to
reach the Capital, Perhaps Urn most con-*
sptcuous figure upon all sides pending the
calling of tbo roll was W. E; Robinson, of
Brooklyn, the noted correspondent “ Riche
lieu,” a man noted for Ids wit and humor,
who is likely to be a rival of Sunset Cox. A
figure not less conspicuous was that of tho
Rev. •). Hyatt Smith, a slender, trim, eler-
Ical.personnge, who wore mi old-fnshioned
black'silk tint, and looked like a coun
try clergyman with a good share
of humor. Ho sat neither, aloof nor
among the Republicans, and it was
generally observed that the Green back ora
looked upon Idm ns a traitor. He certainly
did not follow the Grecnbnckors in their
chimera in attempting to elect their candi
dates for Speaker and Clerk, but voted con
tinuously with tho Republicans. The roll
call being announced,
aim KEiPF.Ii
was declared elected, ho having received 143
votes, live more (owing to tho Democratic
absentees) than v was necessary to a choice.
Mr. Randall received his party vote, 12U,
while Ford, of Missouri, received 8 votes;
Some mnnsonioht was created'pending the
announcement of tho roll-call at the discov
ery Mr. Hnzelton, of Wisconsin,* ono of
the must prominent In securing tho nomina
tion of Mr. Keefer, was classed with tho
Greenbaclcer Ilazolthio, of Missouri, as vot
ing for Mr. Ford. Mr. Kelfor, in his speech
of thanks, indicated tho hope, or at
least the expectation, - that this will
be a business Congress. His hope may, in a
measure, bo realized, but thoro Is likely to bn
move Stalwart politics in this Congress, than
has been witnessed in Washington tor many
a day. Tho Speaker seated, the swearing hr
of members proceeded by platoons, those
/who could tako the Iron-clad oath standing at
Uio left of tho scml-clrcnlar area In front of
tho Speaker's desk, those who had homo
arms against the Republic standing at tho
right and awaiting the administration of tho
modllled oath. The names of the members
from Alabama wore road, when the Repub
licans made objection to the swearing in of
» MU. WIIEKI.EU.
Mr. Wheeler comes from tho Sixth Alabama
District, having the Governor’s credentials,
ills claim to tho sent is contested by Lowe,
tho Greenback member of tho lust House, and
there can benodonbtwhatovur that Mr. Lowe
received largely tho majority of tho voUs.
Tho Grconbnckors wished to 'emphasize this
fact at tho beginning, and they attempted to
do this In a rather awkward way, through
Air. .Jones, of Texas, a very sincere, earnest
Granger sort of a man, who knows, little
about tho rules of the House, but has n very
stubborn sense of. Justice. Ho Insisted upon
holding tho lloor without making a motion,
In violation of the parliamentary rules and
.of the established order of procedure, and to
tho surprise of the Republican leaders,
Speaker Kelfor was disposed to let Him have
his way. Herb Speaker Kelfor made
1118 KIU3T nui.i.sa,
to the effect that It was for Urn Speaker to
determine die order of procedure In the
swearing In of members, and ho directed
Wheeler to stand aside, Tim Democrats
took advantage of this ruling. A number of
challenges wore subsequently made, hut
dually all members having prlma-facla ccr
llllcatcs were sworn In and all tho odlcers of
the Housp elected. Mr. -McPherson escaped
defeat by a very narrow margin, die Penn
sylvania members having all dually voted
for him.

In the fact Umt g now man may not venture
to assume u leading place on the 'opening

of the contested elections from the {Southern

When the Tennessee delegation was called
to the front and dm hand of Mr. Moore was
about to be raised to take the oath, a clear,
ringing voice was heard from tho Democratic
side, sayUigl “ Hi die name oMiumanlly, In

was elected Clerk l by a narrow majority.
Four Pennsylvania members and ono Rend-
Jnstcr, on tho Arid cult of the roil, declined to
vote for Idm, ami, us tho first call proceeded,
It became evident that it would be doubtful
whether Mr. Mol'llbrsoii could bo elected
unless on n second rolMdl Democrats and
Grccidmckors should vote for him. It was
thought possible that the threats ot Uie in
surgents, Errut, Barr, and Bingham, would
ho carried out, and the friends of Mel’herson
had arranged to nave tho voto tied and an
other ballot taken, when Uie ulght Green
back voles would undoubtedly have .been
cast for McPherson, If it had bren necessary
to elect him. Tho friends of McPherson in
tho Pennsylvania delegation had planned
tills, and wore certain that their bian would
bo successful, but tho courage of tho Penn
sylvania insurgents failed thorn, or their
sense of party obligations induced Uioiu to
change their votes, and on tho second call
tho united Pennsylvania delegation voted
for McPherson, tho hated onouiy of the Cam
erons. , ■ .
IP THE DEMOCRATIC ABSENTEES
find been present it is possible that tho Dem
ocrats might have been more persistent and
Mr. McPherson's chances of election havq
been smaller. There was an* attempt to de
feat the election of Uie Republican caucus
nominee tor Chaplain, Dl*. Powers, Garfield’s
pastor, but it was not successful. Had tho
facts about Powers’ extraordinary sermon
alter tho oasaslimilon been generally known
In caucus, however, Uiere Is Utile probability
that lie would have been selected. It Is
known that the sermon grated unpleasantly
upon the Garfield household. Dr. Powers,
who seems to be a man of fully lb or past
that, in a card today said that he was not old
enough to have gone Into Uip Robot army,
although his father is a Virginia Confed
erate, and lie himself lived in Virginia dur
ing the War.
I'ABACIIGH POWERS.
To (li« HVilcrn Amoetated
Washington* D. C., Dec. o.—'file Rev. Dr.
Power*, pnalor of the church tho Itito Presi
dent Garfield attended, was elected Clmpkdn
of (he IJoijae; but there was Republican op
position, and this alarmed him. Last sum
mer he preached a sermon, which was tele
graphed to tho Western Associated Press, in
which he referred to tho political influences
which, he said, led to U o assasinulion of
Garfield. He salll: “Had there been no
Stalwart contest against the prerogative .of
the Executive there would have been no
such assault upon tho President’s life. Gul
lean’s crime Is but the terrible product of the
vicious, shameless, bitter, inflammatory at
tacks indulged In persistently by those
who have only personal ends to-sorve, and
who were dissatisfied with tho Executive ac
tion, not because It alTcflcd the Interests of
tho country, but because it wns not In accord
with their own precious counsel. It is not
the act ot an irresponsible madman. The
murderous report of (UiUenu’s pistol on the
"d of .July was but tho final eruption of n
diseased .political atmosphere. An atmos
phere poisoned by the pestilential vapors
from the cesspools of faction, and from tho
venomous breath pf slander. It is but tho
hitter fniit of tho ’’spoils systehi, It Is but
the representative work of tho place men.”
Powers In a letter to the Republican members
of the House, today, disclaims any intention
of reflecting on the Stalwarts. In reply to
tho charge that he was not u Republican he
says he whs born in Virginia, was 100 young
to bo in the Rebellion, hut, had he not lived
in Washington, would Imvo voted for Oar
lleld. Continuing he says: “I understand
It Is alleged that in a sermon preached by mo
after the ossaslnallun of Xhesldont Garlloht,
I charged responsibility upon tho
Republican -party or tv part there-'
of. It wns not my Intention
In that sermon (notwithstanding published
reports and references to it, for which I am
not responsible)to' charge responsibility
upon tho party who find so recently elevated
my friend to the Presidency, but to correct
what I regarded as an abuse, and to attack n
system of ofllce-begglng and inflammatory
criticism of tiie Executive which made it
possible for a half-crazed oflico-buggar, be
cause of his disappointment, to commit nil
act so dastardly and heinous ns that com
muted by Gultcau upon tho late President.”

to report such propositions fornohnnge In tho

Blaine bill introduced nt Uie close of Uie last
session. Tho separata bills Introduced by
Morrill and Garland for the appointment of
a tarlll commission differed only ln the man
lier of creating Urn commission. Morrill's
plan is to have nine Commissioners at>-
pointed by the President from civil life, tho
appointments to bo approved by the Bennie:
Garland’s to have tho commission composed
of three Senators, three Representatives, and
three exports selected by Uie oUior six. Tho
points to do considered by Uie Commissioners,
according to both resolutions, are tho same—
to inquire into tho relative effects of the tariff
on tho different industries of tho country and
upon tho consumer and producer; Uie rela

systems; what, If any, improper discrimina
tions exist; It* tho present tarilt law cannot

ing thus proposed a large amount of work,
tho Senators took
A RECESS
to await tho organization of Uie House, pro
■ llmury to receiving tbo President's message.
Uu reassembling Senator Edmunds offered
a resolution that the standing and select com
mittees, as they expired nt tho close of tho
session, be revived and continued for tho
present Resalon. Pugh offered a substitute
that the President pro tcm. bo authorized to
decide whether or nut Uie committees shall
bo equally divided between Uio two parties,
mid. if he decides theyslmll, that ho be further
authorized to name which committees shall
be composed of a majority of Republicans
and which of Democrats, Uie Sciiato then
to proceed to elect Senators to
fill tho committees on tils designation.
Edmunds made Uio point of order on the sub
stitute that Uio Senate could not vest such
authority in its presiding officer. Doth reso
lution and substitute meeting with objection
went over for d day under Uie rules. At this
point there being no prospect of Uie Immedi
ate organization of Uie House, the Senate ad
journed. A Senator is quoted tonight as
having said lie bad learned Uiat Judge Davis
WOULD DECIDE AOAIKBTTIIF. IIUPUIILIOANS
in the matter of committees, and that ho
feared Ids information was correct. The
Senate Sub-Committee .on Bankruptcy did
not take any steps toward drafting a Na
tional Bankrupt law during recess, but will
meet in a few days for that purpose. Sen
ator Hilt, of Georgia, to whom was referred
the papers tiled In Uta cases of Senators Lap

Washington,!). C., Dec. B.—Senator Pugh
introduced a resolution tills afternoon to
divide tho committees between the Repub
licans and Democrats. This Induced tho Re
publican Senators to hold a caucus, wherein
they decided to Insist upon having all tho
committees. Tho talk In the caucus was to
the elTcct that tho Democrats have tho Secre
tary anti Surgennt-nUArms, with tho sub
ordinate, olllcers, and tho Republicans aro
entitled to tho committees. Those wiio ns
'sumed to have Information stated that Presi
dent David, of the Senate, hftd indicated ho
would not vrito for any change of organiza
tion; that hirvoto would not assist To turn
out tho present ofllcors. and from tills
It was concluded he Intends to vote to
give the Republicans the committees. This
talk indicates that tho Republicans do not
expect to bo able to elect the ofllcors at this
session. Thera is some dissatisfaction among
the Democratic Senators with Sergoant-at-
Arms might.- He discharged several Demo
cratic omploy6s, and appointed Republicans
for Republican Senators, and the Democrats
protest against this.

MISSING FACES.'
Special IHtpaieh to The Chicago Tribune.
Washington, D. 0., Deo. s.—Congress is
back again. The National debating society
has resumed Us annual sessions. It is In tho
busy, boisterous Houso that the frequenters
of tho Capitol will notice tho most change.
Among the UOO and more members and dele
gates hero are many now faces. There mo
tho familiar faces left of tho
r OLD POLITICAL LANDMARKS,
which liavo served as guide-posts for a gen
eration of legislators, but thoro nro now and
unfamiliar faces, and It Is the appearance of
time now faces which gives tho hall of tho
liouso an unaccustomed look. Tho changes
upon the Itepuhlican side nro very marked,
and tho effect of these changes Is yet to bo
determined. Tho mon on tho Itooubllcnn
sldc wlio towered above all others, who wore
fenders In tho JteoubJlcan party, and mon of
recognized eminence throughout tho world,
have been transferred to the Senate, have re
tired to private life, or have Joined tin* Jong
procession of the dead. Their faces, voices,
and Inllucnco will bo missed, and. it remains
to bo scon who will tnko their places. Thu
question ofitepubllcan leadership from the
llobr Is not loss Important to tho party tlutn
the election of their ablest man for Speaker.
. . TIIK NEW COMKHS. 4 v
Thoro are able men left who In the past
have not averted themselves. I say In tho
past, for It ’has eomo to bo a recognized fact
of our American Congressional life that no
now comer may aspire to be a leader. • Lack
of knowledge of the rules of the Jlouso-a
knowledge which cmftiot bo obtained except
by long experience upon tho floor—of Itself
dlaqunllllea a now member from Immedlato
leadership. There nro besides very many
obstacles to overcome, such ns tho principle
of seniority, Jealousy, the clannishness of
the older memburs, which present an Insur
mountable barrier to the newcomer In the
hulls of tho House. Age, which Is often
urged against a candidate for tho Speaker
ship, is quite ns often presented as a reason
far tho recognition of leadership upon the
door.
CHANGES BY STATUS.

.Forty-seventh Congresses anil compare thorn,
and run your eyo over tho roll of those who
have dropped back Into private life, assumed
outer or who are numbered with tho
dead, the changes will be very marked.
KICVENGLAND. . ‘ ,
From the State of Maine Mr. Blaine, a
loader in oil the mompntous
War, had gone In a former Congress to the
Senate to be taken from l|g for Garfield’*
Cabinet, and to pass now, hi early poccltbor,
19 private life—where nobody thinks he.wlll
long remain. Frye, too, frank, oarnost,
vigorous, often eloquent, always popular,
has gone to the Senate, and already made his'
mark there- Ho Is succeeded In Uie House *
by Nelson B. Plngley, a man Well known In
Maine, but who has yot to write hi* name ou
Uie mmols of National reputation. The re*
tlremmit of Frye loaves to Mr. Hoed tho
undisputed leadership of the Maine delega
tion, and Mr. itced has'ability enough to
venture at least to aspire to the leadership of
the House, which for fully, twenty years
has been In a great moafuro claimed by Urn
State of Maine. Mr. Hoed is-young,, vigor
ous, popular, quick-witted, alert, and Is a
rising man.
JMIOM MASSACHUSETTS, *
Walbrldae Field, a man of learning and
ability, but too much of* a recluse , pud a
student to ever take a prominent part tn
practical legislation, has retired to tno
Supremo Ilonoli of Massachusetts,,Which ho
will adorn, mul to which his education ami
his tastes adapt him. lie is succeeded by
Judins Uanney, a man of good reputation
In his profession, a lino speaker, successful
In the things of this world, and very likely to
take a prominent part In Congressional con*
tests. T)r. Lonng, too, has toft the House to
bo Commissioner of Agriculture, ami Is do
ing more to give dignity and Influence to that
bureau than any man who has hold tho otllco
since it was created, lie Is succeeded by
Kbeu F. Stone, of Nowburypnrt, a man who
has long aspired to Congress, mid who is
rated us a quick-witted, keen political man
ager. Oov, Clallln, a business llupresunta
tlvc, has been succeeded by John.W. Candler
In tlio Eighth Massachusetts District. Mr.
Candler Is a man of line presence, of great
resources, skilled In Uio knowledge of man
aging men, and will bo ono of the leaders
among tho business legislators of tho Forly
sovonth Congress.
IN VEUUONT,
Bradley Barlow, the banker, the great stage
man, the famous star-routu contractor, wito
has been heard of moro in the Investigation
into Uio star-route proceedings than he ever
was, hr ever would imve been in the halls of
Congress, lias given place to William Grout,
an ambitious young soldier, who bus yet tu
make his mark.
Thu entire ilhode Island delegation In Uio
House Is changed. Nelson W. Aldrich, an
active, capable busiuess-nmn, who can speak,
has been transferred to the Senate to succeed
tho lamented Burnside. Hu Is succeeded by
Henry J. Spooner, also a business-man, who
Is not much known outside of tho very nar
row limit of “Jlhodo Island and the Provi
dence plantations.” Latimer W. Ballou, tno,
the old editor mid banker, whose earnest face
mul thlu voice for so many years have been
familiar to Uio frequenters of the House, lias
given place to Jonathan Chaco, a man even
less known in National affairs than Spooner.
Little Khodo Island has Its record to make in
tho new House.
IS CONNECTICUT
“ Joe” Hawley. whom to bo named Is to bo
known, witli his genial manners and his
earnest speech, has boon promoted to the
Senate, and is succeeded by John R. Buck,
who will wait some years, undoubtedly, bo*
fore he achieves thereputotkmof his brilliant
predecessor.
NEW YOIW,
Coming to New York, there have been
many changes. Covert, Representative from
hung Island, who, during his last year in
Congress, achieved a prominence of which
his (list term gnvu no promise, yielded to one
of Uie most respected Congressional tradi
tions of New York, that a member should
not be returned for more than one term unless
he stand preeminent above all rivals, and
Is succeeded by Perry Belmont, wealthy,
ambitious, tho sou of August Bel*
numt, who deserves well of tho
Democratic party, however 111 iio may have
been treated by it. Perry Belmont, un
doubtedly, Is one of tho richest .men in tho
now Congress. Possibly not ns rich ns ho Is,
but a young man of tho same typo and dash,
is Roswell X*. Flower, of . one of tpe New
York City districts, who defeated William
W. Astor, another young man of vast wealth.
■Flower Is elected to take tho ploco of Devi
P. Morton, many times a millionaire, now
Minister to the French Bepubllc. There are
a good many millions represented by tho
three men Just named, and it Is a fact not
without slgnlllcnnoo In our politics that du
cats and political ambition are beginning to
mu close together. Dnn O’Kcilly, the
Brooklyn Alderman and Congressman, who
arrlvml In Washington In tho last Congress
Just In time to. make Mr. Randall speaker,
mid who made such a desperate struggle to
retain his salary as Congressman ami Alder
man, has gone buck to ward politics, and Is
succeeded by William IS. Robinson,
known everywhere to readers of po
litical literature in this country' as
tho old-time correspondent “Richelieu.”
Jin will be one of the wits of the House, and
will bo the most formidable rival that Sam
Cox has In his humorous specialties. An
other noted change In the Now York dele
gation Is Uie retirement of tho nervous, elec
tric. funny, earnest little Mr. Chittenden,
lie Is succeeded by Uie Rev. J. Hyatt Smith,
wiio in political classifications has a big “ 1.”
written after his name, but who mure than
anything else in politics represents tho anti-
Olmtenmm ticket. Outside of the bailiwick
in Brooklyn which ho represents Uie Rev. J.
Jlyatt Smith Is likely to bo a more earnest
Republican than tho Democrats, who once
hoped to secure Ids vote, cun dream.. Nicho
las ilu I lor, who hud Quite a reputation ns an
emigrant runner ntono time, gives way to
the noted Ben Wood, once of Uio Express,
a representative of a typo of Now York pol
itics which need not bo described. Klnsteln,
the wealthy young German Republican, Is
succeeded by Philip Dugro,'a -wealthy mer
chant; Fernando Wood by John Hardy;
Jimmy U’Brien, who was so little in
Ids seat in tho last Congress .that al
most every time he came to -Washington
on an occasional visit he had to be intro
duced to the doorkeeper, has retired to pri
vate life, and is succeeded in Congress by
Abram S. Hewitt, ouu of the ablest and most
earnest men on Uie Democratic side. .The
banker Ferdon is followed b.v Lewis Boacli;
Lomisbury is displaced by* Thomas Cornell,
who is likely to be a prominent man In tho
new House; Bailey, of Albany, Uio half
breed whoso name President Arthur sent in
again to ho Consul at Hamburg, Is followed
In the Sixteenth New York District by
Michael Nolan, and Warner Miller, Uio most
fortunate young man In New York politics,
has been elevated to the Senate. Tho other
ohunges in Now York are not notable.
nbw .iKUsier
In New Jersey Mr. George M. Hoboson
remains, and if ho is disposed to work will
bo very likely to lay claim to leadership on
tho Jtupubticau side. Charles JI. Voorhls,
whoso career in Cuugroas wan clouded by
Irregularities in business transactions, Is
succeeded by John Ulll, who did go much in
former Congresses In tho interest of cheap
postage, and who has not abandoned ills
favorit hobby.
I’ENNS VI. VANIA.
In Pennsylvania Delator Clymor, who was
so ambitions and so unfurtunato having, m
one summer married a wife, broken u lug,
and lost his CongrosaloimDnomhmilon, has
his seat filled In the now Congress, by Daniel
Krmontrout, a Ponnsylvauia German poli
tician of a good deal of power. Hendrick 11.
Wright, uman full ,of Isms ami particularly
cranky on tho labor and greenback questions,
has hud all Ids sins pardoned him by his us
suoliUes in Congress, and tho qid man lias
gono to his grave •honored and beloved by
every one who knew him. Eccentric ns lie
was, iiu was generous to a fault and the soul
of honor, and his brethren in tho House of
Iteprcsumattvos, and tho poor people of Ids
district, wiio wore the daily recipients of his
bounty, remain to mourn Ids loss. JohnW*
KUJluger, of tho Fourteenth Pennsylvania
District, nervous, fussy, a little less of an
electric eel than b ather Chittenden, a perpet
ual Jack-lmthc-box, the man who was al
ways the tirst to rush between the
tellers and to hasten to his seat to
invite attention to ills remarkable exploit—
which was the beginning and the end of his
Congressional record—U succeeded by the
well-known ■ Samuel F. Barr. John I.
Mitchell, of Pennsylvania, another lucky
young man In, politics, who was so little
Known lu the House at the time Ida good
luck came that many Inquired who he was,
was elected to tho Bunate to succeed “ Cof
fee-Pot Wallace,” and Is followed In tho
House by jtobert Walker, Alexander H.
Coltroth, uman of varying fortune in‘Con
gress, one of the most persistent of tho
pension-grabbers, has disappeared from the
Pennsylvania delegation. Andrew tJ. Cur
tin at fast stands upon the roll ns a itepre
sentntlve from the-Twentieth Pennsylvania
District. Those who know the old War
Governor, and remember how strongly his
heart beat fur the Union cause, will be sub*
prisGd to know Uiat opposlt Ids name the
word “Democrat” la written. Harry White,
to whom Grant wrote his unft-thlm-term
letter (which never yet has been satisfactor
ily explained), the* quickest man- to get
upon Ida feel In the Forty-llfth and Furty
alxth Congresses, has' been unfortunate
enough to have ids name dropped from tho
rolls. .He Is followed by domes Musgruve.

Traveling west, a notable missing face In
the Ohio delegation Is Miat of John McMahon,
one of the clearest-beaded, most forcible,
direct, incisive speakers on the Democratic
side, anq a man who was the model of the
bluerorit and most extreme partisanship. He
Is followed by Henry 1* SEorey. Frank Hurd,
Uie brilliant debater aim able lawyer,'has
again yielded to the fata of putttlcs, and Is
retired. Finley, tbo. the Immortal Finley,

I'HOSPKCTS or THE NEW MEN,
- What.about the now men? LUtle U
known, liiey have their records to make.
It Is to bo seen whether they .will cornu for
ward to take the places of some of the more
eminent men whom they have succeeded.
There doubtless are many undeveloped
leaders in tho throng of untried members
who crowd Uie roll, The talent for leader
ship is not possessed by all. The House Is «
very trying place. To bo successful in
leadership there requires the combina
tion of many qualities such as are
not mot with in every department ut
political life. Some years bunco doubt
less Uio now men who now for.tha
first time take tho oath, If they continue la
political life, will be among the giants of
those days. For the present, unjust as It
may seem, they will have to wait. Important
as they niay bo within the boundaries of
their own districts, conspicuous ns they are
in* their States, tho Nation is a Held into
which many of them are but Just boglnnlmr
to enter, and in tho matter of leadership mi
apprenticeship has to be served. Otcimr-e
this does not apply to the nmvcomchs who
have simply returned to public life after an
absence which it may perhaps bo pleasant to
describe ns a vacation.
