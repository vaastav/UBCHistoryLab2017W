Similar extracts from the same and other equally high
authorities m ght l>e produced to an indefinite client. I
have c< nfmed myself to tenutorr ? mm high in authori
ty. uiid who brii g to the support of their doctrine* un
questioned evidence of the sanction and approval of the
pci pie they represent. All ol these Senators have been
endoised by re-election to t he Senate, and by elevation
10 other js+ts of honor and distinction. Some, if not all
of tl.i in, are inditted for their position and popularity
to the very avowals upon which I am commenting It
;s wt im than idle to say that the people condemn these
t o< triors, r.nd that they are the extravagant ebullitions
if excited partisans. Tins ia impossible. Other wIho
these sentiments would not he repealed and reiterated,
n und out of i t asm, by these Sewn tors, and always
with more than usual emphasis and bitterness as the
time for their reelection approaches. Nor would State
1 egls Int ur? s continue lo return them to Congress it the
|-e< pic did not approve and sanction the doctrines thus
i.nuounted by th< se chosen u> represent (hem.
in the other branch of Congress the black republican
representatives have gone even farther than Senators in
ihcir abuse and di ntineuition, not only of thu institution
el slavery, but of slaveholders. No language is dee-nod
tei h? tfc ? no ipithet too coarse ? no denunciation too
b iter, ui th< csluiation of these men, to be applied to
the pi t pie of the South. The official record of Congress
hileii wah the tut -t inflammatory appeals, not only to
th< [Kople of tin North, but t<? the slaves of the South,
ir.iil.rg it, sunn tn n, stimulating revolts, encouraging
urf.'ti a: murder, and denouncing slaveholders as pi
tatid &'id barbarians. I shall not stop to make quota
tions fnm ihise speeches. It ia only necessary to open
any volume of the ComjrtMvmal GUI* for the last few
v eats, and turn to the speech of any black republican on
the si.bjt 1 1 of slavery, and you will find ample evidence
of the truth ef the statement.
To such aw extent has this hahit, on the part of mem
hi rs of Congress, of abusing the people ? . the South gone,
that a citizen of a Southern State cannot visit the capitol
ol his country and linger for nu hour iu lis halls during
the session of Congress, without hearing language and
epithets applied to h niself and section or the most ofl'on
sive and insulting character. Ihe venerable men of all
sections, who served in Congress twenty live and thirty
years agn. li.-ten to these discussions or read them in the
papers w ith equal a:!<m ishment and mortification. I will
in t pause to ci mmcnt ujsui this state of things, but will
proceed with iny inquiry into the principles ;uid objet ts
of thi* party.
W hi 1st these amn univmeiifs are being maile in Ihe
halls of Ct.ugri ss. si.d b> those who h u e been commis
si! ned to speak for the pinpie of the North, it is not
strr.nge that (he public press should be filled with vimi
lar entiments, only cli thed. if possible, in more vulgar
language. I simply allude to the fAct. without intending
to wiaken the argument by bringing to the wltueso stand
the lower i rder of black republicans, of the t lass of Webb,
Vent worth, Greeley . 4cc. They simply do the bidding of
wiser heads. With them it is "thrift. " With tho others
it? is sentiment ? puss ion ? power; olid tho fact
that so many instruments ran be found to do
the menial work is < uly evidence of the extent to which
the f'octriues and pr.nciples have taken rout in the pf^iu
lar lieiut.
Tliere is one dt gma of this party which hits been so so
11 mnly enunciated, botu by their national convention*
and Mr Lincoln, that it is worthy of sersms considera
tan. I allude to the doctrine of negro equality. The
stereotyped expression of the declaration of indepen
di nee, thut " all men are born equal," has been perverted
from its plain and truthful meaning, and made
the baf.s of n political dogma winch strikes at
the very foundation of the institution of slavery.
Mr. Lincoln and big party assert that this doctrine
of equality applies to the negro ; and necessarily
there can exist no such thing as property in our equals,
fptnthis r? int both Mr. Lincoln and his party have
spi ken w ith a dmupt tness which admits of no question
or tqimwtation. If they are right, the institution of
slavery, as it exists in the Southern States, is in direct
violation of the fundamental principles of our govern
nicnt, and to say that they will not use all the power In
their nancts to eradicate the evil and restore the govern
mint to its "anennt faith," would be to write them
seivtl down self ion victid traitors, both to Dr indole aid
duly.
These principle* liavo not only been declared in tbo im
passioned Uin^i.aKr of its advoi ales and defenders, but
nave ut length found their way into the statute books of

True, but over anxi"tis friends of the Union at the North,
faithful but over confiding men at the South, may catch
at this Congressional majority tsirawj but it will only be
to grasp and sink with it.
Ibc facts and consideration* wbicb T have endeavored
to bring to your view present the propriety of resistance,
on the part of the South, to the election of Iineoln In a
very dittereut light from the mere question of rcslstltag
the election of a President who has been chosen in tho
usual and constitutional mode. It is not simply that a
comparatively obscure abolitionist, who hates the insti
tutions of the South, has been elected President , and that
we are asked to live under the administration of a man
who commands neither our respect nor confidence, that
the S'lith contemplates resistance evu to disunion.
Wounded honor might tolerate the outrage until, by
hiioth< r vote of the people, the nuisance could be
abated; but the election of Mr. Lincoln involves
lur higher considerate us. It brings to tbo South
the solemn judgment of a majority of tbo
people of every Northern State ? with a solitary
exception? in favor of doctrines and principles violative
of be r c< ustitutionaJ rights, humiliating to her pride, de
structive of her equality in the I'nion, and fraught with
t he greatest danger to the peace and- safety of her people.
It < an be regarded in no other light than a declaration of
the purpose i.nd intention of tho people of the North to
continue with the power of the federal government, the
war alr< ady commenced by the ten nullifying States of
the North, upon the institution of slavery aud the consti
tutional rights of the South. To these acta of bad faith
the South list heretofore submitted, though constituting
ample Justification for abandoning a compact which hud
been wantonly violated. The question is now presented,
whether longer submission to an increasing spirit and pow
er of aggression is compatible cither with her honor or her
safety. In my mind there is no room for doubt. The is
sue must now be met , or forever abandoned. Equality and
safety in tbe I'nion are at an end: and it only remains to
be seen whether our manhood is equal to tbo task of as
serting *nd maintaining independence out of it. The
Union formed by our fathers was one of equality, justice,
and fraternity. On the fourth of March it will bo sup
planted bv a lTnion of sectionalism and hatred. The one
was worthy of the support and devotion of freemen ?
the other can only- continue at the cost of your honor,
your safety, and your independence.
Is there" uo other remedy for this state of things but
Immediate secession? None worthy of your considera
tion l.ns been suggested, except tbe recommendation of
Mr. Buchanan, of new constitutional guarantees ? or ra
ther. tbe clear and explicit reoognition of those that al
ready exist. This recommendation is the counsel of a
patriot and statesman. It exhibits at? nppr<? .atiou of
the evils that are upon us. and at the same time a devo
tion to the constitution and its sacrod guarantees. It
conforms to the record of Mr. Buchanan'* life ou this
distracting question ? tbe rccord of a purr heart and wise
head It is the language of a man wbiM heart U over
whelmed with a sense of the great wrong and injustico
th.it has been (lore to the minority section. minglod with
an ardent bops and desire to preserve that I'nion to which
be has devoted tbo energies of a long and patriotic life.
The difficulty is there will be no response to it front
those who alone have it in their power to act. Black
republicanism is the niling sentiment at tbe Nertb, and,
by the ek ct ion of Liimln, lias pronounced, in the most
formal and solemn manner, against the principles which
are now commended to the country for its safety and
preservation. As a matter of course, they will spurn
these words of VMM and patriotism . as tliey have be
fore turned tbeir back upon all tbe teaching* of tbe good
ai <1 true men of Um land, or elf o tlo'j wi 11 play with it
In their insidious warfare to delude the South into a false
security, that they may the more effectually rivet their
iron chains, and thereby put resistai.ee in the future be
yond our power. They have trampled upon the
constitution of Washington and Madison, and
will prove equally faithless to tbelr own
lodges. Yon ought not ? cannot trust them. It is
not tho constitution and the laws of the United States
which need amendment, but tbe hearts of the Northern
P?i pie. To v fleet the first would bo a hopeless under
taking. whilst the latter is an Impossibility. If the ap
peal ot tho President was made to brethren of the two
sections of the country, we might hope for a different
response. Unfortunately, however, black republicanism
has buried brotherhood in the same grave with tbe con
stitution. We are n<> longer "brethren dwelling together
in unity." Ihe ruling spirits of the North are bla.-k
republicans? Mid betw een them and tbe people of the
South there is no other feeling than that of bitter and
intense hatred. Aliens in h< art . no (>ower on earth can
keep Ihem united. Nothing now holds us together but
tbe cold formalities of a broken and \ loiatod constitution.
Ihaven has pronounced the decree of divorce, and it will
be accepted by tbo South as the only solution which
gives to her any pr< ml.-e of future peace and safety.
To part with our friends at tbe North who havo been
trne and faithful to the constitution will cause a |*ng in
every Southern breast- for With them we could livo lor
ever, peaceably, safely, happily. Honor, and future
seeuiity. b< wever, demand the separation, and in their
hi arts they will approve, though they may regret the
act.

or c?n the Union be preserved an ?oeh terms? I think
not. To preserve the Union we moot be Just. an?l carry
out in gcod faith every provisiou and guarantee of the
constitution. It is not only true, sir. that the platform of
print ink* sdls forth ail that I state, but I recollect lately
leading the speech of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Trum
bull made in the presence of Mr. Lincoln, in which he
spe ke of the great triumph ? the election of Lincoln. Ho
Raid it bad secured one great object. One great thin# had
been accomplished bv this victory? it was free territory;
tbat nluvery should never be extended upon another foot
of the territory of this country. In addition to that, sir,
we bave seen a letter from the honorable Senator from
Wisconsin, Mr. Doolittle. I will have it before me direct
ly, in which he commences by saying that it la indeed a
great triumph; that it has settled' forever the question of
fi ee territory ; that slavery shall not be extended into the
Ten Stories, by any act, however bold or however spe
cious; neither by border ruffian invasions, nor by the
decrees of courts, nor by congressional slavo codes ; but
tbat tbe territory uow acquired, or to be hereafter
acquired from Mexico or (ireat Britain ? throw
ing his eye all over the opportunities of acquiring
territory, seeing we could only acquire it from
the one or the other shall for ever remain free. He doos
not stop there, sir. He professes to own a portion of the
Cnple of this country ? Florida, Louisiana, Texas? to
ve purchased them, and tbat he Is going to hold on to
thi m; that they paid a large sum of money, and sacri
ficed forty thousand lives and $100,000,000 to defend
b<m.andheis not going to permit them to go out of
this I'nion. They cost a price thut ho enumerate*; and
he intends to hold them here, and they shall have no lot
or part in the common territories of our common coun
try. Will our people in tbat portion of the country thus
spoken of, knowing that the platform of principles upon
which that party succeeded lti tbe late election is in con
flict with their equulitv. is in conflict with the constitu
tion, and with these threats at meetings rejoicing over
their success, and the written views of distinguished
gentlemen on that side ? wiil they sit stilly Will they
submit? I ask you. sir, and the patriotism of tbe coun
try, will they submit to this kind of inferiority , to this
kind of insult, inequality and degradation? If they do,
sir, without a guarantee that cannot hereafter bo
broken, that they shall have equality in th is country,
and enjoy rights with the other Statos, then they are not
worthy to be culled American citizens or freemen. I
would do anything, sir, to save this Union; but it must
be saved upon honorable terms; it must be saved upon
the principles of tbe constitution. The obnoxious laws ?
laws violative of a faithful and prompt execution of the
Fugitive Slave law ? now on the atatule boolu of the
Northern States, must be repealed, and such guarantees
made as will satisfy every man tlmt- hereafter their
rights shall be safe. I would not advise them to be vfery
ready In ai repting promises. They are easily made and
easily broken. Then, I say, sir, without such guarantees
as will secure to every portion of this country unques
tioned equality, without such guarantees, as will enable
every man of every State in this Union to go into the
common territory and take his property and enjoy It while
tbe territorial condition remains, there can be uo peace
in this country; .there can be no Union. It does
not exist to-day. That fraternity, that good faitf
that honorable feeling and just action that controlled our
fathers, does not exist in this country to day. There
must be a change of head, and, I would to nod. of heart
also. Heaven can work a miracle; it did upon Saint
I'aul, and 1 would be very glad to see it done in this
country, and the hearts of the people throughout the
land changed, and good will, good faith. honorable feeling
and just action restored, and then the country would go
on together forever. Hut while I say these things, I want
it understood distinctly that I would ask nothing for Ore
gon that she is not entitled to under the constitution; but
that I would have, and nothing less. And. sir, I say
If the South had the numerical strength, and could, by
action here, or in any other way, deprive the state which
I represent of her equality, or her rights with the other
Stat<s of this Union, I would not submit to if.
I would have that winch we are entitled to, and I
would esk no more; but that 1 would have, and every
State of this Union is entitled to it. and ought to and
must have it. Mr. 1'resident, I sent for and have now
in my hand the letter of the distinguished Seuator from
Wisconsin to which I have alluded, aud for tear I did not
quote it correctly, I will read this letter. It Is a beauti
ful document, but just in keeping with the principles
upon which Mr. Lincoln was elected. He says: ?
Racink, Nov. 1?, MOO.
W. T. Kfiijci, Esq , Corresponding Secretary:?
Sir? An Important business engagement, beyond my power
to postpone, will prevent me from joining tbe republicans of
Milwaukee thi* evening In " rejoicing over the glorious vie
toiy lately obtained by the republican party " It is, indeed, a
great victory, e?tabllshlng two things at least:?
1. That slavery shall not be extended Into the Territories,
by any means, however bold, nor under any contrivance,
however specious, neither by act of OongresiL by border ruf
fian Invasion, by Judic ial decrees, nor oy Territorial slave
codes: but that the free territories acquired or to be acquired
from Mexico or Great Britain shall remain free. And.
2. That the majority, and not tbe minority, by their votes,
constitutionally given, shall determine who shau be President
of tbe United States, and that It la the first principle In repub
lican popular Kover^ignty that the minority must aequlesee,
peaeefsOy if they will, but they niu*taequ!e?"e in the enforce
ment of all constitutional laws unacted for the country, and
for the whole country
We have not purchased Florida to protect our entrance into
tbe Cnlf of Mexico, nor Louisiana to control tbe outlet of tbe
Mi>sl>-*ippl Valley, nor annexed Texas, and defended her
again ? Mexico at the eiper. w of forty thousand lives and
IlCWt mi.WI, to suffer i hem now to pass under a foreign and
hostile Jurisdiction. It cannot be done. Mr. IJneoln will be
Inanfimatcd President of all the United Stales, and must taks
charge of all our foreign relations.
Now, here Is the modest part of this letter:?
When the passion aud misrepresentation of the hour are
Rssed; when the people of the South, who have as yet re
sed to hear what republicanism Is, except from its pulttieal
em mlea, -hall learn from him what it really Is, and how
grossly it ha? beeu misrepresented to them, every considera
tion or Interest and of patriotism will bind them anew to the
American Union, and lead them to a peaceful acialeaenoe
In Mr. I.ino in s administration. J. K. DOOLTITLE.
Mr. President, It Is not the election of Mr. Lincoln that
Is troubling the country, as I said before, but that he is
regarded as a dangerous man . tlu?t he eutertalns view"
and opinions, a?- express, d by him- :f. which are da?ige
roue to the peace, safety and prosperity of fifteen States
of this confederacy. It is because he has been support
ed aud elected by a party holding the views of the Sena
tor to whom I have Just referred. Mr. Lincoln himself,
if he were not m the liands of such a party, would not
be objectionable, nor would he If be had no views, or had
expressed none, but be has had views; be is an " irre
pressible conflict" man; he holds tbat the slave States
and free States cannot live together. I apprehend the
result will be that they will not live together. TV mo
tion Is to print the Message. It Is a very Important State
R per, and I approve a very onudcrable portion of it.
ere are many points in it tbat I like; and before it
goes out to the country, I have thought It proper to say
this much on the subject.
