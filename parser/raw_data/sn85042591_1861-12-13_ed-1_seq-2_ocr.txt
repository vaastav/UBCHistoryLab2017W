very foolishly proposed to give oar

if they can bo furnished in time; but
if not the sewiug machine might be
called into requisition.
The Boston Journal says: An
officer in the army requests os to aak
the ladies to make mittens for the
Soldiers with one finger as well as
a thumb. Without this they can
not handle the locks ot the mus
kets. 1'ieces of soft leather sewed
upon tbe ball of tbe finger and
