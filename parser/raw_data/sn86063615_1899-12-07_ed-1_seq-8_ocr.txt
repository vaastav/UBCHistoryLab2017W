LADYSMITH, Saturday, Dec i-The
hottest bombardment of the siege took
place last Thursday. The Boers got a new
big gun into position on Lombard's kopje,
completely commanding the town, and
shelled our camp that day and jeslerday.
planting shells with great accuracy in the
camp of the Gordon Highlanders and the
Manchester regiment, where there were
many narrow escape;. To-day the enemy
resumed the bombardment, doing .some
very effective shooting. Several of our
Biins have been shattered by the Boer big
sun.
QUEENSTOWN.-CAPE COLONY, Satur
day, Dec 2. The Boers have become very
active in the country around Stormberg
Junction, to which General Gatacre will
make his next move
The telegraph lines have been cut In va
rious places, arid communication with
Eteynsburg, Dordrecht and Maralsburg
has been severed. It is believed
here that the Boers have oc
cupied Steynsburg. Firing has been
heard in the direction of Stormburg, prob
ably between General Gatacre's vanguard
and the Boer command.
IXNDON, Dec 7. 1:30 a. m. Again there
Is a complete lull In the war news. Lady
Bmlth has established heliographic com
munication with Frere. and it Is reported
that all was well up to Sunday. vA dis
patch from the Boer laager, by way of
Lourenzo Marques, dated Thursday. No
vember 30. confirms the report that the
commandos have been closing in upon
Xadysmlth and mounting big guns In new
positions.
According to the fame advices a heavy
cannonade had been maintained and a gen
eral assault had been ordered for Thursday
morning, but was countermanded at the
last moment.
Modder river dispatches say that the
Boers are encamped amid the hills half
way to Kimberley; but It Is also asserted
that a large body of the enemy has gone
In the direction of Jacobsdaie. It is pos
sible, therefore, that Lord Methucn may
endeavor to clear his right flank as far
as Jacobsdaie before continuing his ad
vance. He Is still waiting at Modder river
lor stores, guns and ammunition.'
The sortie from Kimberley on Novem
ber 25 appears to have been much more
serious than had been supposed. Details
are now arriving of a reconnolssance In
force by mounted troops under Colonel
tscott-Turner. at dawn, in the direction of
a ridge near Carter's farm, wnere the
.Boers were strongly Intrenched. Finding
.the Boer pickets asleep. Colonel Scott
Turner proceeded along the ridge under
cover and rushed the Boer redoubts at
G-.:5 a. m . In the face of a hall of bullets.
TIip Boers hoisted a white Hag and fired
at the Britten under Its protection before
Mil-rendering. Owlifjr possibly to the ex
haustion or their ammunition, the British
were unable to follow up the attack and
to seize a large Boer laager about 300
yards ahead, especially as Boer reinforce
ments were seen approaching and the
enemy was keeping up n heavy fire from
tho shelter of the thick bush.
During the sortie, an. armored train re
cpnnoitered north and south, while a con
siderable force of British, with field guns
and Maxims, advanced toward Spvtsfon
lein. holding the Boers In check f.i that
direction.
Ten tuns were engaged simultaneously
and. viewed from the conning tower, an ar
tillery' duel seemed proceeding In every di
rection, except toward Kenllworth, the
fusillade being terrific At 8 o'clock, hav
ing no force sufficient to hold the position
he had stormed. Colonel Scott-Turner be
gan gradually retiring his men. He had a
horse shot under him, and a bullet went
through the fleshy part of his shoulder.
Several men had terrible wounds.
It is alleged that the Boers used Martinis
and explosive bullets, and that they fre
quently fired at the British ambulance
wagons. The British captured twenty
eight of the enemy.
There appears to be some doubt as to
whether this was the reconnolssance In
which, according to the announcement of
the war office. Colonel Scott-Turner was
killed, or whether that officer met his fate
In a subsequent frortle.

Yeiiterday.
FRANKFORT. KY., Dec C The flood
gates of oratory wero opened promptly
when the election commissioners took their
seats to-day and it rolled on for hours,
with a brief intermission at noon. The
Republican speeches were longer and more
elaborate than those of the Democrats,
who were apparently saving as much as
possible of their time for Judge Hargis. of
Louisville, who to-morrow makes the great
argument for Goebel.
D. W. F. Fairlelgh, of Louisville, made
the opening statement for the Republicans,
It. F. Peak, or ShelbyWlle, performing a
similar olllce for the Democrats. A. E.
Wilson, of Louisville, rpoke next for the
Republicans, and Lous McQuowen, of
Shelbyville, replying for the Democracy.
A. P. Humphreys, of Louisville, was put
down for the close of Republican argu

case. Judge Hargis closes to-morrow. The
arguments were carried on during the day
In the greatest possible harmony.
The senate chamber was Jammed to suffo

ADMINISTRATION SKEPTICAL
Take Little Stock in the Report That

WASHINGTON. Dec C Relative to the
rumor from Hong Kong that Agulnaldo is
willing to surrender to United States Con
sul Wlldman. it is learned that, though the
consul himself has cherished that belief
for some months past, the government
here has been without any assurance of
the soundness of his conclusion. Mr. Wild
man is not the only official representing
the United States In the far East who has
expressed confidence In his ability to per
suade Agulnaldo to cease hostilities, but
for some reason the administration has
always been somewhat skeptical as to
thee undertakings. The report from
Hong Kong is believed to be nothing more
than a revival ot some or the old rumors.

HAVANA, Dec. 6. President McKlnley's
message to congress has been received by
Cubans or all classes with much satisfac
tion. Even the leaders of the extreme party
admit this, and the announcement that
there will be no American civil governor
has cleared away most of the clouds that
had been hanging over the Cuban political
situation. The Lucha, alone among the
papers, still favors a civil governorship.
General Collaso says:
The message will pacify the country. President
McKinle's statements are nut ery concrete, but If
congress guarantees the independenie of Cuba we
need not ask for any eptcincatlon "as to the time for
the remoral of the American troops, although every
body would be glad to see the black troops go, be
cause of the excesses they commit.
Cubans fear the administration, but they do not
fear congress. The administration represents the
trusts. Although Cubans are as good business men
as Americans, they could not compete with the
enormous power of the trusts, which, by creating
monopolies, would eventually enslave the working
man. We wish to see each man onnlng some prop
erty, at least enougii to make it worth his while to
behave as a good 'citizen should, instead of going to
the woods.
Gualberto Gomez said:
I had expected the message to be encouraging, but
I had not'expected such clearness of thought. Con
gress will go further and will Justify the hope of
tbo Cuban people.
The Discussion says:
President McKlnley's message will oil the hearts

The Patria says:
Hurrah for President McKinley. He could not
k VKta ln clearer tone. It Is Impossible for
mc i,iuUiiie oi conquest to overpower the deep,
natural impulse of a noble and democratic people.
The Cubano says:
The message contains the clearest words yet spoken
by President McKinley. and shows that Justice Is the
guiding principle at Washington. Our hearts, hith
erto bowed down by tremendous skepticism, are now
relieved, and ws may expect congress to speak still
more clearly.
Germany.
BERLIN, Dec C The German govern
ment and press almost unanimously wel
come President McKlnley's message to
congress. Even the Agrarian papers, al
ways opposed to things American, grudg
ingly admit that the message Is"' fair and
honest. The drift .of private comment is
virtually the same. In the lobby of the
relchstag to-day, similar sentiments were
expressed without reserve by members of
every shade of political conviction.
Emperor William, it is reliably reported,
had a long consultation this afternoon with
Count von Buelow, the foreign minister,
and he expressed himself as very much
pleased with President McKlnley's atti
tude toward Germany. It Is also reported
that his majesty discussed the best mode
of giving official voice to the feelings of
the crown and the government. Count Von
Buelow authorized the 'Associated Press
correspondent in Berlin to send to the
United States the following as his im
pression of the message;
Count Von Buelow regards the message as an enun
ciation memorable In the development of German
American friendship. The warm tdne ln which the
preldent speaks of our mutual relations has crested
here the best Impression and one may be sure that
the sympathies 'exhibited by the president for Gar
many are here sincerely reciprocated. PolIUcally
everything between the two countries Is serene and
there is nothing that- disturbs the entente cordiale.
Economically considered the contents and tone of
the message strengthen the hope that the United
States with their Increasing exports to Germany will
make fair concessions to German trade and that the
reciprocity negotiations will be further conducted In
a friendly spirit to a good end.
The press particularly rejoices at the
announcement regarding alliances, despite
many previous asseverations to the same
effect. The semi-official Berliner Post says:
President McKinley has put a stop to such rumors
and guesses and has placed ln lieu of fiction the
solid fact that the relations between the United
States and the German empire are ot the most cordial
character. His message will not fall to produce by
its pacific tone the best effects everywhere and not
least In Germany. Formerly we were accustomed to
meet everywhere a broad inimical attitude toward our
colonizing efforts, but President McKlnley's words
Indicate that he knows and .appreciates Germanv'g
cultural mIsion and is ready to assist.
The Vossische Zeltung says:
Experience has taught us. although we gratefully
acknowledge the present warm tone of President
McKinley, that Uncle Sam Is as quick to hate as
to love, and too often ln the past he has allowed
himself to be prejudiced against us by his cousin on
this side of the Atlantic.
Discussing the meat problem, the Vos
sische Zeitung welcomes the proposed com
mission of experts. Inferring that this will
be in the interest or cheaper meat and rood
here and welcomes also the continuance
of friendly relations with the United States.
The Berliner Tageblatt, which discusses
the message chiefly in its economical as
pects, concludes as follows:
We heartily join ln the wish that this fair spirit
may dominate ln the treatment of all controversial
points, which will show that a genuine effort Is
being made to regulate German-American relations.
The Boersen Courier says:
It Is significant that a president's message prob
ably for the first time should devote so much space
to foreign affairs. The improvement in German
American relations Is largely attributable to the
skill of Count Von Buelow.
The Nord Deutsche Allegemelne Zeitung
and the Nolnlsche Zeitung briefly record
their satisfaction with the message.
The Kreuse Zeitung, the Deutsche Tages
Zeitung and the Statsbuerger Zeitung ex
press Joy that the alleged alliance does
not exist. The Boersen Zeitung says:
We can unrestrainedly declare our satisfaction, hop
ing that time will not return when American poller
will glide Into paths leading Into unnatural discord
between the two nations.
France.
PARIS, Dec. C The Journal des Debats
notes that President McKinley reiterates
that the traditional policy of the United
States Is to avoid alliances and places all
the powers on the same rooting. The paper
adds tha't if anything, he selects France
and Germany for the kindliest references.
Continuing, the Journal des Debats says:
We cannot but be touched by President McKIniej's
alluion to the hlstnrlc ties between France and th&
United States which have never been Interrupted.
His were not mere words of courtesy but real truth.
There never existed the slightest desire for hostili
ties, which may have been said during the Spanlsh
Airerlcar. war, which were mere press criticisms oc
casionally carrle-l too far. In order to understand
one another the two nations ought to have much
mutual Indulgence and good will. The opportunltv
for the exercise of the last named Is at the present
moment In the submittal of the Franco-American
convention to both parliaments. We may have that
the protectionists at Washington will not give it a
bad reception, nnd that our deputies and senators
will not prevent by their blindness the conclusion
of an agreement so precious to our amicable relations
with the United States.
The Temp3 says It finds "want of de
cision" In President McKlnley's message
to congress, which must be "disconcerting
Tor the country, which needs an uneiulvo
cal, firm statement." Referrinpr to the par
agraph on roreign affairs, the Temps says:
After Mr. Chamberlain It was President McKlnlev's
turn, and he has shown himself tactful. He speaks
warmly ot friendship, but does not breathe a word
or alliance. These are shades of language which say
much for the fragility of the ties of sentiment be
tween the two countries. His allusion to the failure
to reach an agreement with Canada Is very clear.
Alliances may be talked of. but a difference of sec
ondary Importance cannot be settled amicably. Re
ferring to South Africa. President McKinley held the
balance level between the two belligerents, and even
Inflicted on Mr. Chamberlain and the pretentious
Imperialists the cruel word "mediation."
In short, the message will little please the noisy
champions of alliance, while It Ignores, it will give
A Trne Friend.
A rriend In need is a friend Indeed. That
is exactly what Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy Is. It is the mother's help when she is
suddenly awakened In the night by the
omtnous husky cough and labored breath
ing of her babe. It Is the safe resort of the
youth or adult when he has "caught cold"
and there is coughing and irritation of the
mucous membrane of the throat. It allays
the irritation and cures the cold.
satisfaction to all wise friends of a good understand
ing between the two great Anglo-Saxon nations.
Mexico.
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 6. The cordial tone
of President McKlnley's allusions to Mex
ico In his message to congress were well
received here, where the message wis re
ceived with great Interest: also his re
marks on trusts, as trade combinations are
being made here, for It seems probable
that the Industrial combinations will be
one of the most important phases of the
business situation ln this country. Presi
dent McKlnley's frank declaration that the
Island of Cuba Is being held In trust for
the Cuban people ana that the United
States government Intends honestly carry
ing, out the intentions of its congress, as
declared at the outset of the war, causes
favorable comment, and It Is believed that
the same sentiment will be expressed
throughout Latin America, awakening
friendly feelings tor the great Northern re-
puonc.
The Mexican Herald says :
President McKlnley's message is a remarkable and
statesmanlike document, which Indicates the grow
ing cosmopolitanism ot the United States, and thlt
his utterances on the Cuban question will enhance
the prestige of the American name through Latin
America. The reactionaries will read with rage the
generous declaration of President McKinley, whll
the true and tried friends of progress and modern
ideas will rejoice that the American people have
put away the temptation of territorial acquisition.,
They went to Cuba to remove the yoke of European
power and give Cuba genuine freedom, and now the
great president, whose came will be identified with
new and cosmopolitan era of development In the
United States, confirms In solemn utterance the will
of the liberty loving people of the great republic.
Latin America will understand McKinley better.
He Is strong enough to be generous and statesman
enough to know how to win favor of Latin America.
Englund.
LONDON, Dec. C The amount ot space
devoted here to President McKlnley's mes
sage to congress evidences the widespread
interest in the document. The afternoon
aewspapers In long editorials on the sub
ject, particularly refer to the currency dec
larations and solace themselves with the
Idea that the good relations between the
United States and Great Britain are so
well known as to not have required em
phasis as In the case of Germany.
The Pall Mall Gazette sees in the mes
sage an unmistakable reproof of Mr. Cham
berlain's Leicester speech.
The Globe thinks the document is weak
in higher statesmanship and that nn for
eign policy, as elsewhere it Is tinctured w.th
opportunism.
The AVestminster Gazette, discusslnir the
reference to Canada, says:
"When discussing the relations between
Great Britain and the United States, it
ought always to be remembered that there
are very material interests which must be
dealt with on business and not on senti
mental grounds. Gracerul concessions are
not seen ln the same light by the daughter
as by the mother."

of the Grand Army ot the Republic de
cided to-day that the next encampment
would be held from August 28 to Sep
tember 1, in Chicago.
In the general discussion of the council
it was the consensus ot opinion that the
encampment should be held at some time
during the public school vacation, so that
the public schools might be utilized as
sleeping quarters for members. It is said
by members of the committee that there
are many veterans who might wish to at
tend the encampment but who could not
stand the financial burden of paying bills
at crowded hotels. At other encampments.
tents have been used, but the committee'!
deems it more advisable to use the school
buildings.
The meeting of the national council of
the Grand Army of the Republic and the
local general committee closed to-night
with a dinner and reception to the visitors,
given by the department of Illinois G. A.
R.. the Women's Relief Corps and Ladles
of the Grand Army. In honor of Command
er Shay and National President Harriet
J. Bodge, of the W. R. C. Tho dinner
was served at the Palmer house and was
followed by a reception in the general
parlors of the hotel. At the dinner Commander-in-Chief
Shaw, in speaking of the
next encampment, said:
"Doubtless the president of the United
States will be in attendance, as well as
other leading men of the nation. Admiral
Dewey who is a great favorite with the
Orand Army, has been invited and will no
doubt be here as the guest of the city
t Chicago and Grand Army combined.
itate uuwtres irom all tne aepart
ments, embracing forty-five states where
the Grand Army exists, and they are all
united lit the judgment that the year IPO)
will be one of the most glorious in the
annals of the Grand Army."
There was only one absentee when the
council met, those present being Com-mander-in-Chier
Albert D. Shaw. Adjutant
General Thomas J. Stewart; Quartermas
ter General E. J. Atkinson, Thomas "V.
Scott, AW H. Armstrong, F. M. Sterrettt,
P. H. Coney and P. 11. Lennon. M. D.
V ickersham, of Mobile, Ala., was the only
absentee. A delegation from the Woman's
Relier Corps was also present. The mem
bers or the committee called on Mayor
Harrison at the close or the morning ses
sion. Mayor Harrison urged that the en
campment be made non-partisan In every
detail, and suggested that. Inasmuch as
President McKinley would be present. Mr.
Bryan or whoever the Democratic presi
dential nominee might be be also Invited.
This will be done.
"The president Is a member of the G.
A. R. and always attends the encampments
in his capacity as a member," said Commander-in-Chief
Shaw after the confer
ence. "There is nothing political in the In
vitation we have extended him. The may
or's request, however, is a just one and
will be complied with."
General Shaw said that he intends visit
ing, if possible, every department of the
Grand Army in the United States, and for
the months of March and April has
planned a tour embracing the states ot
Maryland, Virginia and North and South
Carolina, Florida, Texas. Arkansas, Ken
