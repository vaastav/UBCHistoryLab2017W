FAIR WARNING.
About the 1st of January we shall
publish a list of delinquent subscrib
ers ta the Covrier, and the names
of each will be kept in our columns
until the dues of each are paid.
TThen the large list of our subscrib
ers is taken into consideration it
will be readily seen that it would be
saberious task to interview each of
eur delinquents in person, and we
Vill adopt the method of publishing
si list of those of our subscription
patrons fa arrears, both as a matter
ef convenience to. them and to our
selves, and at which no honest man
fill take' offense! If, in the mean
tike," any of our patrons "wish to pay
their subscription, they can tell ex
actly what they owe us, by referring
ts the label opposite their names, on
the Cockier they receive each week.
ArrrmM must be settled at the
rate of $1.50 per annum, and $1 for
the current year.
The "president's message sent to
coBzress last' monday is too long
for our oolumns, though it makes
sight of good reading for any one
wlshlnz information In reference to
all departments of our good govern-
Bjeat. It is a much more volumin
ous document than his last annual
message and bears upon almost every
tooic claiming attention by congress.
The president's views , iu reference
to the unlimited and compulsory
m if nave ' ot silver are not in exact
accord with his party, particularly
ta the West, but he gives his rea
sons therefor in pointed terms, that
Impulses oue with the honesty of
hi convictions. Upqn the whole wc
do not recollect a more statcmens
tike document of the kind than the
taessaere of President Cleveland.
Tho Globe-Democrat, notwithstand
Ing its intensely partisan character,
makes favorable mention of tue mes
or'. nd winds tiD its review as
follows:
' "The message touches upon al
. most erery question of broad na
tional concern. While the recom
mendations and suggestions will not
all command and unqualified favors
of the people, it must be acknowl
edged that most of them arc sound
and worthy of the action . of congress.
The document certainly gives much
valuable information on questions
with which ever eood citizen should
feel aa interest."
A wspaech from Glasgow to the
Globe ' Democrat says that the safe
. at Essie's mill in that place, was
broken open last Friday night and
burglarized of $80 :. and Ollie Thix-
ton. a yonng mulatto, had been ar
tested for the crime, and had con
fessed his guilt, that the mother of
the boy, when learning mac circum
stances implicated her son as the
iiifof . Ait.ed the officers all she
. could, that she applied the hickory
so readily, and to such good pnrpo
mes tint the vounff scamp became
quite willihg to produce nearly a
the stolen money. '
WtiAT TUK PASTOR SAW.
Aa old army officer, who has
very high opinion of himself on ac
count of his noblo birth, went to
. church one Sunday accompanied by
his orderly. The 'preacher, a very
eloqoent man, discoursed at length
oa the future life, how in heaven
there would be no difference in rank
or title. After church was out the
old army officer said :
' 'Did you hear what the pastor said
about how it is going to be in
heaven?'' ;' " :
. ! did, colonel," replied the or
derly.
Well, let me tell you right now.
