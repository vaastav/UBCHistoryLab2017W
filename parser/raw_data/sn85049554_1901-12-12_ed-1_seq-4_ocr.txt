CANAL TREATY PROGRESS.
National Interest centers to some ex
tent in the senate's consideration of the
isthmian canal treaty, now being dis
cussed in executive session previous to
ratification or rejection. There is no
fear of the latter, as the republicans are
heartily in favor of it and the democrats
are making but feeble resistance to It.
Thus far Senator Bacon of Georgia has
made the most extended argument
against it, claiming that it un-Ameiican
in that it does not meet all that was
.sought by the senate amendments. On
the other hand the republican leaders
are satisfied that it provides for an
American built, an American controlled,
and an American guarded canal, with
the neutralisation feature in the Interest
of the world's commerce, and that it is
a vast Improvement on the Clayton
Bulwer treaty. Senator Lodge has man
aged the treaty with skill ^nd foresight,
has clearly expounded its superior fea
tures, and has no fears at all as to its
ratification. He and other leaders are
perfectly willing that the opposition
shall have all the time necessary to de
bate its features, tho they do not care
to encourage filibustering tactics. How
ever, it is impossible to filibuster to any
considerable extent In executive session
and Senator Lodge hopes to get a final
vote on the treaty not later tluui Fri
day afternoon.
QUARANTINE TROUBLES.
Iowa, people seem to have passed
from a position of extreme feur of
smallpox to one of extreme careless
ness. At least this inference is war
enforcing quaraintine regulations in
ranted/ from the reports of trouble in
the cities of the state, notably at Bur
lington, Des Moiijes and Council Bluffs,
a quottion from the Nonpareil of the
latter city, appearing in this issue,
showing how quarantine has been vio
lated. The authorities are perplexed in
their efforts to enforce it in order to
prevent the spread of the disease. Oth
er cities than those named are having
similar troubles. Meantime the disor
der is spreading and new outbreaks are
frequently reported. It is in fact per
meating the state. In. the November
Bulletin of the state board of health
Dr. Kennedy reports outbreaks in Oc
tober at more than thirty points. It Is
widely diffused thru the state. It is
true the disease is in mild form the
people have come to understand this
and have less fear of it. Many of them
are Immune from vaccination. Hosts of
others refuse to resort to this precau
tion, and are a menace to the general
welfare.
'One of the difficulties in enforcing
quarantine is a lack.of system or lack of
Impartially in applying it If stories
current awhile ago when a case devel
oped in Marshalltown are to be credited,
some of the exposed were put under the
ban of quarantine while others were
allowed to go free. The people are in
clined to resent quarantine regulations
that do not "regulate." It requires a
great deal of wisdom to properly dis
criminate in cases of exposure in order
to keep the people and the board of
health in touch with each other. They
ought to work together to preserve the
public health.
FAREWELL YE GROUT BILL,
The recent discussion of the Grout
bill in the convention of live stock men
haB called attention again to that piece
of proposed class legislation. Under the
guise of a pure food law that aims'to
prevent Imltatloh of butter the Grout
bill proposes to place a tax of ten cents
per pound on all oleomargarine that Is
colored a rich, yellow color. Such a
tax would be and Is intended to be pro
hibitive. No charge can be brought
against the product as being unwhole
some. It is made from beef products
and is as clean and wholesome as any
meat could be. It is used in place of but
ter and since by the cheapness of the
cost of its production is made available
for use on many a poor man's table
when butter to him Is a luxury beyond
his means.
It is claimed that oleomargarine Is
colored in imitation of butter and sold
as butter to many an unsuspecting cus
tomer, thereby proving unfair compe
tition to the poor farmer's cow. A law
requiring all oleomargarine to be sold in
packages plainly marked would be fair
and no hardship but It has become a
well established prejudice with man
kind that he wants his butter or butter
imitation colored a rich yellow. The
color makes it more palatable to him,
hence practically every pound of butter
made in America during eight months
of the year is colored by some artificial
coloring to meet the public demand.
Butter made this time of the year, in its
natural state would nearly resemble un
colored oleomargarine and a law that
places a prohibitive tax on the coloring
of the one Is nothing but ,visck)us class
legislation if it does not prohibit the
coloring of the other. Both products
are used for the same purpose and both
cater to the same prejudiced public
taste. Both when colored are no less
wholesome and pure.'
The discussion of the live stock men
has probably settled the fate cf the
Grout bill which in its inception was
nothing but a piece of ch'eap politics at
best. The sycophant who would win the
farmer's vote by taxing the oleomar
garine industry out of existence and de
priving the poor man of a cheap and sat
isfactory substitute for butter will see
that there is a large and lusty body of
farmers who will have none of his
fawning. As a matter of fact, thru I6\va
there is hardly one farmer in three that
is Interested In butter making while the
other two would be glad to see the ole-o
industry thrive if 1t would add a few
cents per hundred pounds to the price
of fat steers. However, the exasperat
lng thing about the proposition is that
coiferess should be asked to drive one
man out of a legitimate business in or
order to make the other man's business
easier, to tax one man for coloring oleo
margarine yellow when the butter mak
er colors his product in the same way
for the same purpose.
WHEN ROOSEVELT WAS ARRE8TED.
Cassius M. Barnes was once terrl
torial governor of Oklahoma and was
candidate for re-appointment to sue
ceed William Jenkins, strange as It
may appear in view of the incident
given below. Barnes has a strong fol
lowing In Oklahoma, but that he should
aspire to the governorship again at the
hands of the president was more than
his friends expected of him. He is the
only man who ever issued a warrant
for the arrest of President Roosevelt.
Under this warrant the president was
arrested, but explanations followed and
his release was Immediate. The Inci
dent is related by a writer In the New
York Tribune:
It was during the rough riders*"re
union at Oklahoma City in 1899 that
the incident occurred. President
Roosevelt was then a vice presidential
candidate and governor of New York.
Governor Barnes tendered him a fine
black horse, which he accepted for his
personal use during the reunion, at
least. On the day of the parade Col
onel Roosevelt found that some of his
men lacked saddles, and, without ado,
the Oklahoma governor invited the
New York governor to take some of
those belonging to the militia. This
was done, but the militia, on finding
that the rough riders had taken more
than their share, asked that the saddles
be returned. Words between the pri
vates followed, and as a result a brazen
young lieutenant of the militia asked
Governor Barnes for the arrest of
Governor Roosevelt. The former, being
of quick temper, issued the writ. When
it was served the New Yorker bent
from his horse, saying: "Please con
vey my compllmentB to Mr. Barnes and
say he shall have all of his animals re
turned, even to the one I am riding.
The rough riders can walk." The
rough riders did not walk, nor did they
ride the 'animals furnished by the
governor of Oklahoma.
IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES.
'The autumn weather has been to
good to sell," says the Marengo Repub
llcam "Stay in Iowa, and get more of
It."
Rockwell Phonograph: At this writ
ing the grand jury has been in session
nearly a whole day and not a solitary
Mason City druggist nor grocer either
has been indicted. The former are ev
idently confining their attentions solely
to the sale of Pink Pills and Peruna and
the latter to codfish and cranberries.
Who says the revivals did no good!
The Ottumwa Courier urges that an
archy should be clearly defined. "What
should be branded as a crime is to be
long to any society which advocates the
assassination of public officials. The
punishment for such offenses could not
well be made too severe."
The Clarlnda Herald expresses this
opinion: "Those Corning preachers
who are preaching on early closing in
stores are preaching practical Chris
tianity that will win converts ten times
faster than doctrinal discourses and de
nunciation of sinners. Touch a man's
dally life sympathetically and you make
him a friend, which Is the first and
longest step toward making him a con
vert."
"Our good equal suffrage ladles will
have to get closer together if they ex
pect to make an Impression on the next
legislature," remarks the Davenport
Republican.
The Council Bluffs Nonpareil observes
that "The women In discussing suffrage
have already commenced calling each
other such harsh names as to give some
Idea of what a hot time there will be
when they really come to the scratch."
In noticing the demand upon members
of congress for public buildings, the
Vinton Eagle observes that "Other con
gressmen besides Cousins haye trou
bles," but that Cousins "Is the only con
gressman being cartooned/'
Keokuk Gate City: The secretary of
agriculture is responsible for the state
ment that the preacher who does not
eat beef steak cannot preach. This can
not be regarded as other than a das
tardly blow at the yellow-legged chick
en industry.
A Discredited Senator^
[Washington Correspondence.]
Senator Wellington, of Maryland, is
the loneliest occupant of a seat in the
United States senate. "He occupies a
seat on the republican aide," writes
a correspondent of the Chicago Chron
icle. "All around him are men whoso
political faith he once expounded and
who recognized him as a worthy ex
ponent. Wellington sits there day after
day apparently bewildered and un
noticed except by the galleries, which
seek him out thru motives of curi
osity. From a well contained, self
complacent statesman Wellington has
become extremely nervous. He does not
know apparently what to do with his
hands. He did not attend the repub
lican caucus and he will not be ad
mitted to the democratic caucus. He is
the only man in congress who is with
out a party. The change ,6| Welling
ton's fortune is due to his! liability to
state an obvious fact in such a manner
as not to offend public decency. He had
quarreled with the late President Mc-
glutting Times-'EEpwWtert, TOarsljalltotait .torn Ttrursong,
Ktnley, and because of that quarrel
when McKlnley was shot he said to a
newspaper Interviewer that he had
nothing good to say about President
McKinley."
New Congressman at White House
[Washington Star.]
At the white house he is ushered In
to the President's room without undue
ceremony, but there he alts on a leath
er-covered chair and sees senators and
members of the cabinet take precedence
of him. After a time the president
passing from one to another of his
visitors reaches the new congressman
and grasps his hand. On the first meet
ing the congressman says he has just
come to pay his respects and the pres
ident gives him an enthusiastic greet
ing, signifying that he is glad to sec
some one who does not want a favor.
On his second visit he will not find
himself so cordially greeted. Not that
the president will be anything but
agreeable and courteous, but it is not
safe for even a president to be too
civil with a congressman. His attitude
might be Interpreted as conveying en
couragement.
Thinking Versus Worrying.
[St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Many business men imagine they are
thinking of their affairs when In fact
they are only worrying. Worry is fear
with a minimum of thought and fear
is not only an unfaithful emotion, but
most destructive of effective thought.
Of course, It needs no wisdom to teach
that worry does no good. That is gen
erally recognized and accepted as an
undeniable truth. That It doeB posi
tive harm Is Just as true, tho not al]
men like to admit It.
The Deluge of Bills.
[Indianapolis Journal.]
It Is to be hoped that the extraordina
ry number of bills introduced during the
first few days of the session of congress
Indicates the activity of members during
the recess and that It will soon subside.
A total of 4,224 bills Introduced in three
days Is alarming.
Democratio Force of Habit.
[Omaha Bee.]
The new Hay-Pauncefote treaty has
EO far elicited the opposition of only two

against ratification simply from force of

[OUTSIDE POINT OF VIEW.j
Written for the Times-Bepubllcaa.
Somehow this winter the writer has
not been able to deliver as many pri
vate practical family lectures as usual.
The reason has not been because the
lecturer was unprepared, but because
the audience seemed to b« too small for
the effort required. We have actually
played whist some this winter. Again
Seraphlna would come over after sup
per and bring "those blessed children,"

one of her daughters were present. The
writer proceeded "to take time by the
forelock."
"Ladles," said the writer, "I have In
my hand the Boston' Advertiser. The
very name Implies respectability and re
liability. I propose to read from it.
When I am thru you Will know that
such a condition as psychological disin
tegration exists for the scientific mind.
It will explain some things in this fanp
ily the cause of which to find out has
taken me many weary years. Listen:
'Dr. Morton Prince, physician for
nervous diseases at the city hospital,
has a patient under hi« observation who
outdoes the famous dual creation of R.
L. Stevenson's genius. His Dr. Jekyll
had a dual personality, but Dr. Prince's
patient enjoys the distinction of being
the possessor of a triple self. The doc
tor is now writing a monograph on the
case for the London Society for Psychi
cal Research.
"The patient, a young woman known
as 'Miss Beauchamp,' Is quiet, reserved,
studious and with a strong leaning
toward the religious a reader of
French, a lover of music and a person
of high Idealism. She can recall none of
her other personalities.
'The second self has been called 'Sal
ly,' and the disposition and the pranks
of this personality fit the name admira
bly. Sally hates the proper, circum
spect Miss Beauchamp, and torments
her to a degree well nigh incredible.
While Miss Beauchamp does not know
of her existence, she, on the other hand,
knows the most secret thoughts of Miss
Beauchamp. An absolute antithesis to
the other, Sally detests books, study and
church going and delights In practical
jokes. She Is vindictive, too, especially
regarding Miss Beauchamp. and some of
the annoyances to which she has sub
jected the latter show fiendish Ingenu
ity.
'Dr. Prince says that Miss Beau
champ also has three hypnotic states,
and that he has analyzed her continu
ously for three years, his investigations
occupying hundreds of hours at a time.
During this period the three personali
ties have been coming and going appar
ently without any consistency. Each of
the three claims to be the real Miss
Beauchamp and to have the sole right
to occupy her body.'
"Now, madam," aald the lecturer, "be
fore we go farther let us make a person­
12, laoi

you were a prototype of Miss Beau
champ. After the honeymoon—soon
after—the Sally part of your organiza
tion showed itself. You "Let me
suggest," said Mrs. B., "that you finish
reading and then deliver your oration."
"Very well," said the lecturer. "Just re
member, madam, when I first knew
you, you were 'neurasthenic.' Listen
further:
'When Miss Benuchainp first came
under Dr. Prince's observation she was
a neurasthenic of a very severe type. A
student in a New England college, she
was diligent and
quick-witted,
but had
to abandon the course owing to her ex
cessive nervousness. Physically she was
quite a wreck. Her Innate temperament
is one of extreme idealism. Consulting
Dr. Prince regarding her neurasthenia,
the usual treatment was applied, with
no effective results, however. Finally,
Dr. Prince tried hypnotic suggestion.
'One day,' says Dr. Prince, 'when I
hypnotized her and
referred
"The Advertiser goes on to say:
'Sally often carries on a correspond
ence with Miss Beauchamp, pointing out
all the weak points In the letter's char
acter, dwelling on all her little slips and
l'oibles, telling her all her reckless acts
and secret thoughts. When Miss Beau
champ wakes In the morning she finds
pinned up on the wall of the room
verses' containing all sorts of personal
allusions, letters calling her names, tell
ing fictitious things persons have said
about her In short, doing everything
imaginable to make her life miserable.
"The third personality later devel
oped in which Miss Beauchamp did not
know Dr. Prince at all, and had wholly
lost the taste for music, literature and
kindred things. In this personalty the
woman 'has no emotonal ability except
ing bad temper.'
'What is the key to the enigma? Dr.
Prince thinks he has found it.
'In 1893 Miss Beauchamp, as she
originally wa# constituted, was a nurse
in a hospital. One night, while sitting In
her room, the face of a man suddenly
appeared at her window. It was a
friend who had known her since child
hood and who had been a sort of a pro
moter to her. She beckoned him to go
down stairs and met him on the door
step. He was on his way to New York'
and had wandered to the hospital
grounds. In a spirit of fun he had
climbed the fire escape and found hlm
celf looking into Mi» Beauchamp's
room. The Impropriety and dramatic
nature of the proceeding acting upon
Miss Beauchamp's fine nervous organi
zation gave her a shock from which she
never recovered.
'This incident,' says Dr. Prince, 'dis
integrated her. Certain components of
her personality became disintegrated
from the rest. Certain local areas of
her brain have gone to sleep. Her origi
nal self became modified.'"...
"Now, madam, here Is an Illustration
of three personalities in one female. It
follows that "Owing to the small
audience present the management have
decided not to have the entertainment
this evening," said Mrs. B. "Money will
be refunded at the door." "Pa, shake

said Angelina, as both ladies withdrew.
