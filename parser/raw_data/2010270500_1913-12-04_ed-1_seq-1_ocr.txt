Cadets Change Style After First Peri
od, Using Open Plays to Turn Tide
President Wilson Attends Game
In New York.
How York, Dec. 2. Tho president of
the United States and members of his
cabinet, together with 42,000 patriotic
Americans, surrounded the gridiron In
tho Brush stadium on Saturday and
saw the Wost Point football eleven
furnish a stunning surprise by con
quering the midshipmen from Annapo
lis by a score of 22 to 9.
From tho standpoint of the specta
tor, the gamo and Its setting lost noth
ing of its thrilling grip and interest as
a result, and the 42,000 persons pres
ent gasped and cheered by turps at the
kaleidoscopic playing scenes depicted
Tho uses of tho forward pass repeat
edly by tho cadets opened up tho play
to a far greater extent than tho more
conservative lino attack and runs of
the middles.
In tile opening quarter the two
elevens played the usual eastern
game, with the attack directed princi
pally at the line and outside tackle. At
this period tho advantage lay entirely
with tho middies, who used their
weight and speed for consistent gains.
Near their own goal lino tho army
held firmly and Brown, tho middles'
right guard, was called 'back to the
cadets' 20-yard line, whence he kicked
a placement goal. In the second peri
odyhe duplicated the feat, after Hodg
son dropped ono of Nlcholls' punts
and Gilchrist recovered.
Tho army got into action in this
quarter also, and sent the score see
sawing with a field goal and touch
down. Early In tha period tho soldiers
gairied tho ball on the navy's ten-yard
line as a result of a blocked punt from
Nlcholls' too. The West Point backs
could make no impression on tho navy
line, and Woodruff, who replaced
Jouett for the occasion, kicked an easy
goal from placement on tho navy's 25
yard line. Just before the quarter
ended Prlchard caught one of Nlch
oils' high punts at midfield and raced
15 yards toward the middies' goal be
fore he was downed.
'. Three times in succession, then,
Prlchard hurled a forward pass. The
first two were uncompleted, but the
third shot squarely Into the hands ot
Merrlllat, tho army right end, who had
run across tho middles' goal line, thus
West Point registered the first .touch-
down of tho game, leaving tho score at
the end of tho first half 9 to C In favor
of the soldiers, for McEwan failed to
Kick the goal from touchdown
Tho navy added another goal from
placement in the third period when
Nlcholls, by clever running back of
Jouctt's punt, placed tho ball on the
army's 25-yard line. Checked by the
soldiers' defense. Brown scored his
third and last goal from placement,
kicking from the 30-yard mark.
With the points nine all tho cadets
opened another brilliant attack. Mer
rlllat, with llttlo or no interference,
, ran from tho army's 45-yard line to
the middles' one-yard mark before he
was tackled from the rear by GllchriBt.
i'wo line plunges, with Captain Hogo
carrying tho ball, scored the second
touchdown, and McEwan kicked the
resultant goal, making the score, army
16; navy, 9.
Immediately following the opening
of the final period Captain Hoge
caught one ot Nlcholls' low punts on
the arrny's 45-yard line and ran un
aided to the middles' 20-yard mark be
fore Brown pulled him down.
On the next line-up Hoge tore
through the fast weakening sailors
line for eight yards. Again Prlcharo.
elected to try a forward pass and
again it was Merrlllat who caught tho
flying spheroid behind tho navy goal
line for the third touchdown of the
game. The ball was downed to tho
extreme right of the goal posts and
the punt out was a failure, leaving the
final score: Army, 22; Navy, 9.
