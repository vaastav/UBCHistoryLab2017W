lows: Gentlemen of the Congress:
In pursuance of my constitutional
duty to "give to the congress Informa
tion of the state of the Union," I take
the liberty of addressing you on sev
eral matters which ought, as it seems
to me, particularly to engage the at
tention of your honorable bodies, as
of all who study the welfare and pro
gress of the Nation.
I shall ask your indulgence If I
venture to depart In some degree from
the usual custom of setting before you
In formal review the many matters
which have engaged the attention and
called f(r the action of the severol de
partments of the government or which
look to them for early treatment In
the future, because the list Is long,
very long, and would suffer In the
abbreviation to which I should have
to subject It. I shall submit to you

The results of the contests at the
election were early apparent Returns
gathered at the East Oregonlan office
from the first 60 ballots counted 'in
dicated that commission government
was lost and that Dr. Best and John
Vaughan were victorious. Only In
one balloting place did the final re
sult fall to tally with the f rst in
dications. In the second precinct of
the fourth ward, the first 75 votes
counted gave the negative vote on the
charter a substantial majority but
from then on the affirmative vote
gained and ended winner by It votes.
Many people were on the streets
waiting; to hear of the results and the
telephone at the East Oregonlan office
was kept constantly ajlngle by peo
ple eager to learn the outcome. Many
waited in vain for the light of the
city to wink In token of the passage
of the charter. Probably the two
greatest surprises of the election was
the heavy vote polled by Dr. Beat and
the number of ballots marked for W.
L Gadwa on the north aide.
The total vote cast at the election
was about 1400, which prove that
many did not exercise their right of
franchise. There were more than
that number registered and yet many
of the votes cast were those of sworn
in voters The woman vote, while
heavy in the afternoon, was almost
nothing in the morning and it is es
timated that not 25 per cent of the
women appeared at the polls.
