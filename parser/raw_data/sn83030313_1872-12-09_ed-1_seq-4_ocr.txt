The Pboposed Pbesbitebian Ecumenical
Council.?We are glad to notice that the cele
bration of the tercentenary of John Knox has
given birth to one really valuable suggestion.
It is that, on as early a (lay as possible, and in
,such place as shall hereafter be agreed upon,
there shall be held a grand general council of
the Presbyterian churches throughout tho
world. It is a most sensible suggestion, and
one which cannot fail to meet with general
acceptance. It is stated that Presbyterianism
ean boast of twenty thousand congregations
and A population of thirty-four millions.
Lutheran, and other kindred bodies included,
the total swells to fifty-seven millions. Dis
union has long Wn a disgrace to the Protest
Ant section of Christendom. Such a council
Could hardly fail to have a healing and other
wise beneficial influence. Uuion is strength
and beauty as well. Wc wish tho project afi
manner of success. It would be one of the
grandest ecclesiastical gathering* the wot Id has
^.yer known. *
CoBgnu The
B?Tf BUMi It P*M? ?* w??t
The proceedings of the ftwt week of the
closing session of the present Congress may
be pronounoed a fair beginning with an eye
to business. It Is a little remarkable,
however, after the exhibition of the
President's rose-colored picture of tho beau
ties of arbitration in the settlement of inter
national difficulties as illustrated by th?
Geneva Tribunal, that the first act of tbo
House of Representatives should be tbo pas
sage of a bill for the construction of sin
additional ships for the purposes of war.
Surely if the administration had any faith in
the general adoption of friondly adjustments,
from its boasted inauguration of arbitration
as a substitute for war, it would hasten to set
the good eiample of providing rather for a
new era of general poace than for an ealavged
employment of
i Bombs, sans, drams and batteries.
But the Secretary of the Navy pleads the
inefficiency of our present naval establish
ment for warlike purposes, the President sup
ports his recommendations and the House of
Representatives, as if fully impressed with
the idea that no time is to bo lost, hurries
through its preliminary bid for the construc
tion of sir new ships-of-war. And what is
the argument for this measure? General
Banks, Chairman on Foreign Affairs, said in
the debate that he had introduced this bill at
the last session in anticipation of troublo with
Spain, that affairs in tho Gulf of Mexico had
not improved since then, that no one knew
what might occur there any day, and that it
was proper to be prepared for all contingen
cies. But Mr. Scofield did not share in these
apprehensions, and it was not for any such
purpose as a possible oonfliot with Spain that
he wanted these sloops-of-war constructed.
His idea, perfectly innocent of warlike de
signs, was simply to keep up the American
squadrons in the various seas of the world for
the protection of our commerce. It appears,
however, that General Banks speaks by au
thority and that the real object of these new
vessels to the navy is to meet the possiblo con
tingency of a rupture with Spain. He says
that the Secretary of the Navy had declared
to members of the House that ho was afraid
that events had occurred in the Gulf of Mex
ico which would require the government to
be prepared to defend our commerce.
What, then, are these ominous events?
They are, perhaps, the alleged high-handed
proceedings of the Spanish authorities in the
Island of Cuba and of the Spanish Navy in
the Gulf of Mexico, in certain arrests and im
prisonments or expulsions of our citizens, and
in certain pursuits, detentions and searches of
our trading vessels on the high seas or in neu
i tral ports. But the President says nothing of
these things in his Message. He regrets the
continuance of the disturbed condition of the
Island of Cuba. He complains that no ad
vance towards the pacification of its discon
tented population has been made, while the
insurrection has gained no advantages and
exhibits no better prospect of success than it
exhibited a year ago; that this struggle has
lasted for four years ; that, with Cuba at our
door, we cannot be indifferent to this state of
things, and that he has no doubt that the con
tinuance of slavery in the island is at the bot
tom of this continued strife. He hopes for
tho voluntory removal by Spain ofc this great
evil; but ho regrets to believe Jhat citizens of
the United States, or persons claiming to be
guch citizens, are holders of slaves and are
slave dealers In Cuba, and he recommends
such legislation as may be deemed proper to
discourage them from this unlawful business.
There is nothing here to support the appre
hensions of Secretary Robeson or General
Banks, and yet the evidence submitted justi
fies the conclusion that the bill for these six
vessels-of-war has been urged upon and passed
by the House to meet the apprehended con
tingency of a war with Spain.
What ultimate design, then, is entertained
behind the scenes at Washington in reference
to Cuba? The President's Message means
peace, but the bill for these new iron-clads
means war ; and as we have and fear no mis
understanding with any other naval Power
than Spain, this warlike measure clearly is
intended for the contingency of a fight with
Spain. Such is tho state of things in Cuba,
too, that on the plea of the common interests
of civilization and humanity upon which
Louis Napoleon justified his military invasion
and occupation of Mexico, or on the plea of
England's belligerent rights to Jeff Davis, or
on the plea of righting the wrongs committed
upon our citizens on the island and upon our
trade in the Gulf, by the servants of Spain,
we might take military possession of Cuba
or open the gates of the island to an army of
filibusters. Even upon the plea of the
abolition of slavery and the slave trade and of
the coolie trafflo with the island, our armed
intervention for the pacification and civiliza
tion of Cuba would now be supported by the
advanced public opinion of all the States of
Europe, excepting Spain, and perhaps Turkey.
But we conjecture that the administration
contemplates no immediate quarrel with Spain
for any cause?that the present object is prep
aration for possible contingencies in the fu
ture; but that when provided with even half
a dozen ships-of-war, superior or equal in
speed, strength of armor and weight and de
structive force of metal to the best ships of
Spain, we may expect an ultimatum from Wash
ington that will startle the government at
Madrid. Meantime the various interests con
cerned in the building and equipment of these
j new war vessels will have their influence in
| Congress in pushing through this bill and
other similar bills as good things for the coun
try, peace or war. The strength of the ad
ministration for party purposes lies in its ex
penditures, and in this view armies and navies
and costly iron-clads and fortifications will still
cast into the shade the peace policy of your
Geneva Tribunals. Arbitration, moreover,
I will apply where neither party dare venture
into war; but as between Spain and the United
States we have a hone of another color.
The real work before this short and closing
session of the present Congress lies in the
regular annual appropriation bills, with such
retrenchments as an established policy of
peace may demagd^ rffieqch
ments, how'ever, tne President's Message fore
shadows a poloy of enlarged expenditures in
ever^direction. The government is now in a
position which would justify a reduction of its
expenses and its taxes to the extent of a hun
dred millions of money per annum ; but while
our expenditures are to be widened, it is not
surprising that, in the judgment of the execu
tive department, a reduction of our taxation
for the present is impracticable. The first act
of the House of Bopresentatives betrays the
policy of liberal expenditures and valuablo
jobs, and in the magnificent schedule of inter
nal improvements suggested and partially, at
least, recommended in tho Message, a hint is
thrown out to Congress which will surely be
seized upon by the lobb^. Wgapprehona, there
fore, that instead of reduced we shall have in
creased appropriations and additional subjects
for the appropriations of this session of Con
gress ; that the regular appropriation bills will
be heavily charged with lobby jobs and with
the introduction of new schemes of internal
improvements which, under the next Congress,
will, in all probability, be developed into a
monstrous system of widespread official cor
ruption and publio demoralization. Here,
then, is a field in which the minority in the
two houses may labor to some purpose in
building up ft powerful opposition party
for the Presidential succession.
Mexico Peaceful and Bacoarkglag
Progress.
By telegram from Mexico City we have news
from tho neighborirg Republio dated on the
1st of the present month. The advices are of
an encouraging oharacter. There is no men
tion of the existence of political trouble, and
the only revolutionist project which is spoken
of in the despatches is a preparation which is
being made by Dame Nature for the exhibi
tion of a grand volcanic eruption which will
be displayed,^ according to the scientists,
through now apertures from the bowels to tho
surface of tho earth. His Excellency Lerdo
do Tejado was formally declared Presidout of
the Republio. His assumption of Executive
authority was to be completed on tho 2d
instant, amid citizen rejoicing and the cordial
recognition of the foreign diplomatists.
Porfirio Diaz was in tho capital. Tho once
famous revolutionist had had an interview
with the President, but his presonco produced
no excitemcut among the people. Telegraph
communication with tho United States was
restored. The profitable and useful subjects of
railroad extension and eoast lights improve
ment were gradually, but certainly, weaning
tho mind of the Mexican nation from its
remembrance of the losses which may bo
endured and tho atrocities which may be
perpetrated under the cry of God and Liberty,
when it is prostituted by selfish men for
demoralizing uses.
Cuban Capitalist* In Exodus from the
Spanish Island.
By a special Hebald report from Kings*
ton, Jamaica, we are informed of the impor
tant fact that many wealthy Cuban planters
have determined to seek shelter in the British
West Indian colonial island, and to make it
their home in the future. The intending emi
grants have already made heavy investments
in the purchase of English sugat fields and of
other land, on which they propose to cultivate
tobaoco. Sums of forty thousand dollars aud
fifty thousand dollars respectively have just
been paid by Cubans for Jamaica estates
which would not have brought moro than half
these amounts a few years sinoe< Property is
advancing in value rapidly, as wo are in
formed, in the English possessions, and it
appears very likely, judging froa* fee tenor of
our report, thpt ^?^09 ghich js
guarded by tho lion andthe unicorn "will
eventually triumph over that which it is at
tempted to enforce by bloodhoupds and con
vict soldiers with scarred backs from Fcrrol.
Our Kingston despatch goes on to say that
Jamaica 6till requires an infusion of American
energy to make it just right. This will be sup
plied, no doubt, in due time, and then the
world will behold the realization of a sweet
poetic prophecy,
Tho lion and the unicorn ncrhtinjr for a crown,

The Loss of the Steamship Guatemala,
of the Pacific Mail, from the full accounts
published in another part of the Herald,
would appear to be attributable in the first
instance to a neglect by the third officer,
George Foster, in regard to the steering orders
of Captain Douglas. The course lay close to
the land, with breakers on a bar known
to be not far off. The course, as said to be
directed by Captain Douglas, was northwest
by west half west. When the vessel struck
on the breakers the ship he declares to have
been heading northwest by north half
west?that is, a difference of two
points. This would, in such a case, be
sufficient to account for the disaster;
but the conduct of tho third officer proclaims
him not only incompetent but wanting in
common sense. After the worst had come
the boats, as usual, were found to be next
to worthless, one of them boiug rot
ten and only prevented from "filling
by the presence of mind of a lady
passenger, who caulked it with her petticoat.
The troubles of the shipwreck were height
I ened by the Indians, who refused sustenance
; to the sufferers until a chief was captured
and held for the hospitality of his fellows
under pain of death. The sad portion of the
story is the reported losi by swamping of tho
boat under command of the first officer.
The Pbtjssian Reeobm Bill.?According
to our latest news from Berlin the Counties
Reform bill passed to a third reading in the
Upper House of the Prussian Diet on Satur
day. A number of amendments which had
been proposed were withdrawn, and the bill
passed in the Shape in which it came from the
Lower House. Final action will be taken on
the bill to-day, when the royal signature will
alone be wanting to make its provisions part
of the law of the land. In this struggle be
tween the popular and aristocratic branches
of the Prussian Parliament tho Emperor
King has, by judicious interference, secured
tho victory for the people. Since the creation !
of the new Peers it has not been doubtful on
which side victory should lean. The bill
provides for the extension of municipal priv
ileges in the rural district? of Prussia
proper, and It is expected to work great and
beneficial changes in the matter of local self
government. ,
The Swiss Pbehidential Election.?What
Preskleutinl election has just
come off m Switzerland. Tho election has* re- i
stilted in the choice of M. Ceresole for Presi
dent and Dr. Schenk for Vice President. How I
peacefully these elections from tinio to time
pass off in Switzerland ! What better proof
of the smooth working of republican institu
tions tliau is furnished bv the*e elections'<? If
it be true that that country U happiest which
makes the least noise in the world the honor
must be given to the Swiss Confederation.
Why will not France learn the lesson ?
The Situation la New Orltau-Plap
li>( with Fire.
Our special despatches from New Orleans
ropres^nl^ho city as having been remarkably
quiet yesterday. The radicafleaders?Judge
Durell, United States Marshal Packard, Sena
tor Kellogg and Secretary of State Bovee?
affected to be in fear of personal violence, and
moved about guarded by soldiers besides hav
ing a garrison to protect their residences; but
so far as we can judge from the reports the
precaution appears to have been un
nocessary. A meeting of prominent citizens
was hold on Saturday evening, and
a committeo was appointed to proceed at once
to Washington for the purpose of remonstrat
ing against the action of Kellogg, Casey,
Durell and others who claim to act by author
ity of the general government, but at the same
time prepared to pledge to the President the
fealty and support of the people of New Or
leans in all just measures. The Warmoth party
declaro that on no account will they be guilty
of or countenance violence, although they
express their determination to exhaust every
lawful and constitutional power of resistance
to what they call the usurpations of the
federal government Up to this timo the
Courts have been relied upon in all the move
ments that have been made, and no indica
tions of a desire to appeal to force have as yet
manifested themselves on the part of the
Warmoth men. Under these circumstances
it would seem that the radical fears are
groundless, and the suspicion prevails that
they have been assumed for a purpose. A
legislative caucus was held yesterday by the
Legislature, recognized as regular by the
Governor and State authorities, and its mem
bers were likely to remain in consultation
the greater part of the night. It is thought
they will organize at an early hour
this morning, while the Kellogg Legislature,
convened under authority of the United States
Court, will assemble at noon. The latter con
template compelling the attendance of such
members elect as remain in .the Warmoth body
by the power of a strong force of sergeants-at
arms backed, doubtless, by federal troops.
Meanwhile the local press continues to com
ment on the situation in a tone not calculated
to allay the excitement.
Do these New Orleans politicans know that
they are playing with fire?that at any moment
they may occasion a conflgration that can only
end in their own destruction ? The proceed
ings that have as yet taken place have, it is
true, been confined to the aotion of the Courts
of law, but a chance collision, a rash act on
either side, might prove the commencement
of an outbreak the limits of which
cannot be measured. We regret the light
and frivolous tone adopted by General Emory
in his conversation with our special corre
spondent, reported in yesterday's Hkrai.d
The confidence he expresses in the strength
of the United States troops and his unsol
dierly chuckling over the exaggerated esti
mate of the force at his command seem to
imply that he does not look upon a collision
between the authorities of the State and those
of the United States?a conflict between the
people and the federal soldiery?in a sufficiently
serious light. No event more deplorable,
more dang&oui or more disgraceful could
occur. We hope to see it avoidod; yet we
cannot conceal the fact that the peril is im
minent. Governor Warmoth is bold and
unscrupulous, and ho will not hesi
tate to resist violence if any should be
attempted against his authority. He can
call out the militia of the State
to sustain him, and probably would do so in
case his Legislature should be scattered at the
point of the federal bayonet. Indeed, there
seems greater probability of an outbreak in
New Orleans to-day than in Versailles, and
every good citizen and every brave soldier
would deplore the occurrence, not only on ac
count of its danger to the lives of the citizens,
but for the disgrace it would bring upon the
nation.
President Grant condemns the action of
both parties to this miserable faction fight,
and it is said that he will not suffer the inter
ference of the federal troops unless it should
become actually ncccssary for the main
tenance of the law and the protection
of the citizens. But the federal troops
are already playing a conspicuous part in
the drama, and, so far as General Emory is
concerned, there does not appear to be any
disinclination to give them yet more unenvia
ble prominence on the scene. It might be as
well for the President to send General Sher
man to New Orleans, or at least to detail some
experienced and discreet officer to the tem
porary command of the department until the
trouble is ended. As the Collector of Customs
at New Orleans is mixed up in the deplorable
scramble for office it might also be well for
the President to make an immediate change
in that position, and thus remove at least one
of these political firebrands from the unfor
tunate city.
The Right Hon. Benjamin Disraeli
at Glasgow.
From our cable news it will be seen that
Mr. Disraeli, the leader of Her Majesty's
opposition, is an honored guest in the city of
Glasgow. It is now some time since Mr.
Disraeli was elected to the honorary office of
Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow.
Circumstances have hitherto hindered him
from visiting the North. The installation of
the Lord Rector is a somewhat pompous cere
mony. The large hall of the University is
crowded with the students and alumni, the
(lift of the city and neighborhood fill the gal
leries, while on the platform sit the Principal,
with the new Lord Rector on his right, the
Professort and leading officers of tho Uni
versity being ranged on either side. After
the ceremony of installation has been gone
through it is the custom of the Lord Rector
to address the students in his robes of office.
The Lord Rectorship of the University of
Glasgow has acquired yffPj impor
tance from the long roll of distinguished men
who have ulicd Jh^office^ ?dmjn?d Burke,
Adam Smith, Lord Brouglianf Sir Robert
Pod, Lord Macaulay, Lord John Russell, Lord
Palmerston, Sir Archibald Alison, the Duke of
Argyll, and Lord Lytton arc specimens of the
rank and class of men who have in the past
graced the Rectorial chair. Their spoeches,
which have been carefully preserved, have
, aliuo.it invariably !?eou worthy of the occasion.
Mr. Disraeli, who U, bo doubt, folly alive to
the honor whioh has been oonferred upon
him, is the laat man in the world to fling
away his opportunity ; and it ia reasonable to
presume that he will do his best to make his
inaugural address worthy of a place beside
such masterpieces of eloquence as those of
Burke and Bolwer and Macaulay. When Dis
IWii failed to comrnancT the ear of the House
of Commons on the occasion of his maiden
speech, he said, with emphasis, "The time
will come, gentlemen, when you will hear
me." These honors, which are now being
showered upon him by an old and honored
university, and by the tfeoond city of the Brit
ish Empire, prove that he has long since
made good his word. No man is so patiently
heard in any part of the three kingdoms as
Benjamin Disraeli.
More Lessons from Greeley's Life.
The pulpits are still vocal with the praises
of the dead journalist, Horace Greeley. Yes
terday Dr. Chapin, Bev. W. F. Clarice, Bev.
Henry Asten, Rev. E. 0. Sweetaer, of this
city, and Bev. Dr. Chadwick, of Brooklyn,
laid their offerings on the lately closed
grave of the departed Philosopher. Dr.
Chapin held up Christ as * man who |
was popular with the masses. But the
politicians wanted to make a leader
of Him, and because ho discouraged their
plans and defeated their schemes He aroused
their animosity and they in turn conspired
against Him aud compassed His death. While
He lived men did not think so much of Him,
nor, indeed, as the Doctor declared, do we
appreciate the full worth of men until they are
dead. And nothing illustrates this better
than the sad services which were held in the
Church of the Divine Paternity hist
week. "All through Mr. Greeley's life,
and especially during the last six months
of it, the clouds of misconception enshrouded
him, and people talked of his mistakes; but
with his death the clouds dropped away aud
the inner central spirit of the man was re
vealed?the spirit that loved human nature
and sympathized with the slave and the op
pressed." It was this that attracted the thou
sands who thronged the church and crowded
the streets last week. Though Mr. Greeley's
form has gone from our midst the lessons of
his life remain. And the greatest lesson
is the broad sympathy with human
nature that Christ symbolized by his
death upon the cross. Bev. ?. 0. Sweet
ser considered "patience in well doing
as the hidden motto of the great journalist
whose late death was so universally felt."
Mr. Sweetser examined some of the causes
which make men weary of well-doing?namely,
increase of worldiness, frequency of disappoint
ments and the like. But amid Buch distract
ing causes the late lamented Horace Greeley
continued patient in yell-doing. Every life
of well-doing, Mr. Sweetser believes, is "fully
rewarded with an abundant harvest." Such
was Horace Greeley's life from beginning
to end, and we ought not to let the signifi
cance of such a life escape our notice.
It is a providential opening through which we
can see, if we will, into heavenly realities. "In
all that Mr. Greeley undertook he aimed to
benefit humanity. His paper he made an
organ for good, or leftist what he believed to
be goodj IJo njf$q WfiJua voice a messenger
for good, bringing tidings of freedom to the
slave, of woe to the oppressor, of knowledge
to the ignorant, of advice to the erring, of
piety to the penitent and of reconciliation to
the long estranged. He never lost his faith
in God or in man. He has reaped his harvest
and is immeasurably richer to-day than if he had
lived a selfish life and were still on the earth
filling the throne of a king. Even in his
death ha triumphed. It was a glorious death,
for out of the very gloom that surrounded it
there came a ray of heavenly light, which
was worth more than all the anguish, the
heart-breaks, the bitter disappointments, the
shattered nerves and the ruined system?'I
know that my Bedeemer liveth.''' One would
be almost willing to die daily if he could
secure such eulogies as this. But it was the
useful life that made the death so triumphant
and worthy of applause and emulation.
Bev. Mr. Clarke, of Harlem, could not well
talk about "Journalism and Journalists" with
out taking account of the two great lights of
American journalism who have passed away?
the late editors of the Hebald and of the
Tribune. Tracing the origin of the newspaper
in America from the time that an enterprising
Yankee attempted to start a single sheet daily
in Boston, in 1690, but was prevented by the
interference of the General Court, down to
our day, when the late Mr. Bennett
"made the model American newspa
per; lifted reporting to an art; devel
oDed the collection and arrangement of in
telligence from all parts of the world into a
business and science," Mr. Clarke could not
do less than exalt the genins and the enter
prise that could produce such results. The
newspaper is as many-sided as the manifold
life out of which it springs and to which it
ministers. "It lets daylight into the darkest
recesses of our modern life and vice shrinks
from its blazing illumination. The enterprise
of the press is one of the marvels of our age,
and the splendid achievement of the Hebald
in lifting the curtain that has con
cealed the heart of a continent is the spirit of
tremendous organized energy which ransacks
the world for intelligence and turns the
globe into a whispering gallery. The Herald
is the daily confessional of mankind. Mr.
Bennett made the newspaper an institution;
Mr. Greeley made the American journal."
Rev. Mr. Asten drew from the life of Horace
Oreeley the le8son9 of self-reliant energy
which made him one of the greatest in jour
nalistic fame, and covered him in death with
an honor greater than can be won by the
Presidency of this Republic. Moral heroism in
honesty, sobriety, patriotism and humanity
are other traits of Mr. Greeley's char
acter which were pointed out. Mr. Asteo
credits the lately deceased jonrnalist with
creating the moral sentiment which pressed
Mr. Lincoln to sign th$ proclamation of frce
I dom to the slaves. The lesson of Mr. Greeley's
death is that in all our defeats, conflicts &Jld
| triumphs we need a divine helper.
Dr Chadwick, in Brooklyn, referred to the
delamation of Mr. Greeley's character by
party politicans and tho partisan press, but
now they unite in praising him?a circumstance
which shows conclusively that it was the cause
with which Le was espoused and not the
man that they distrusted. Tlie contrasts
of Mr. Greeley's life wore broucht out and tho
real qualities of hie character were mado mora
apparent by the exhibition. "The dead phil
osopher was a good hater, but his bark was
greater than his bite."
Mr. Frothingham talked about "Crime
Punishment," taking his cue from the hang
ing of Bodgera in Brooklyn last week. Mr.
Frothingham does not oonsider hanging pun
ishment in any sense. It is (he removing of
the criminal beyond the pale of punishment.
The preacher's idea of punishment is
the excommunication of tho criminal
by the civilized community of the na
tion or of the world. The Rev, D.
McAlister demonstrated from the Scriptures
the national right to use the Bible in the pub
lio schools. He oritioally examined Superin
tendant Wearer's decision on the Hunter's
Point School case, and proved from State
papers that among the original ideas whiolt
prompted the founding of our school system
one was to disseminate religion and learning
throughout the country. And now for sixty
years the Bible haa bean legally read to the
public schools. Mr. McAlister would make
the constitution oonform to the oommon
schools by acknowledging God and the Bible
rather than hare the Bible thrust out of the
schools.
Mr. Beecher contrasted the constitution and
the doings of the council at Jerusalem with the
council which a few days ago installed Mr.
Hepworth as pastor of the Ohurch of the Dis
ciples. Mr. Beeoher called attention to the
memorableness of the plaoe in whioh this last
council met, to the remarkable circamstance
that a former Congregational minister of
Brooklyn is now Mr. Hepworth's successor,
and to the grounds of faith on whioh Mr. Hep
worth was received.
Yesterday was the feast of the Immaculate
Cnnception, and as such was religiously
observed in the Catholic churches. Hence, in'
the Cathedral, Father McNamee treated on
original sin by way of preface to the doctrino
of the day. He quoted largely and learnedly
from the actions of popes and oounoils to
prove that the precious blood that was to pay
the price of devotion was, though yet un
formed, by a strange miracle of anticipation
80 applied as to keep the heart of the Virgin
Mary from coming under the ban of sin.
Bather a far-fetched "miracle," and lacking
in biblical corroboration.
The BuiLDrNO in Pabk Bow in which the
Express editorial, press and composing rooms
were situated was burned last night.'
The newspaper offices in tho vicinity
were naturally alarmed at the burning
of their brother. Streams, nay, brooks ot
water, however, got the better of the flames,
and Printing House square settled down
quietly to writing up the conflagration. It'i*
to be hoped that the enterprise of our contem
porary will rise superior to this misfortune^'
and that not a day's issue will be lost.
