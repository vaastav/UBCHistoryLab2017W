Mechanical college this afternoon Presi
dent Winston, of the college, by re
quest, made a full statement as to the
recent fire, saying building burned cost
$10,000. It was insured for three fourths
of its value, and from this, deduction
must be made for the walls yet stand
ing. He said $3,300 of loss was unin
sured. He urged that two buildings re
place the one burned and that a loan be
secured for rebuilding. He appeared to
think $15,000 should be the amount thus
to be secured.
The board discussed the matter and
on motion of John S. Cunningham ap
pointed a committee to call on the gov
ernor and inform him of the situation
and see if the council of state would
agree to authorize a loan.

LONDON PRESS ON THE MESSAGE
Favorably Criticized and Compliment
edHow Received in Berlin
London, December 3. The London
daily papers this morning, looking at
President Roosevelt's message from the
point of view of its literary power and
the wealth of weighty matters dls
cussed, regard It as one of the most
characteristic and remarkable messages
ever sent to congress. At the same
time the papers recognize its conser
vative and business-like moderation and
that no attempt has been made, as the
morning Post remarks, "to strike an at
titude or carry his listeners away."
On the whole, however, the newspa
pers are skeptical of any great out
come from the president's efforts in the
direction of reform of the trusts, anti-
anarchism or reciprocity, the idea be
ing that the senate will effectually step
in and nrevent any irreat changes in
the existing system.
Most of the papers remark upon the
tone of exultation adopted by President
Roosevelt in dealing with the cana
ouestion. but they do not show the
slightest disposition to cavil thereat.
The Times in an editorial on the pres
ident's message says it is distinguished
by a clearness, firmness and reserved
strength which do not require the ad
ventitious aid of rhetorical pyrotechnics
or popular platitudes.
"We certainly have no fault to find'
says the Times, "with the language to
wards the British irovernment or In

It is not easy to see how the exclusion
policy can be enforced. The United
States would today be poorer In many
of the finest "elements of Its nationa
character, if an entrance fee had been
demanded of everv settler in the early
days of colonization."
The Times thinks that reciprocity
and the trusts will prove thorny prob
lems, and that the president s cautious
handling of the latter will disappoln

Berlin, December 3. The message of
President Roosevelt caused a mild thrill
in Germany. On the bourse where it
was eagerly awaited, the message was
received with uncommon interest and
the market generally was slightly stim
ulated upon the posting of a bulletin
containing President Roosevelt's utter
ances about trusts. The shares of the
steamship companies fell one or two
points on account of the immigration
inspection paragraph and the proposed
development of the merchant marine

THE STEAMER ALGONQUIN
One of the Clyd Line's Biggest Vessels
Arrived in Port Yesterday Hound
From Boston and New York She Bad
It Rough Off Ilatteras and a Horse
Was Killed .
The sandsome steamship Algon
quin, which is one of the largest and
most commodious of the Clyde's Steam
ship Company's vessels, arrived in port
yesterday at 11:25 a. m. It was her
first visit to Wilmington and as she
steamed up stream, the steam craft
along the water front saluted the
stranger. By reason of the delay of the
steamship Geo. W. Clyde, the Algon
quin was sent by Wilmington to bring
freight for our merchants as a matter
of accommodation, as her regular run
is between Boston, New York, Charles
ton and Jacksonville.
The Algonquin had a big freight list
and had on board 120 passengers bound
for the Charleston exposition and Flor
ida. Her master is Captain I. K. Chi
chester, who is well known and very
popular in Wilmington. For years he
was a frequent visitor to Wilmington
but it has been tome time since he was
here.- so his old friends were exceed
ingly glad to see him again.
The Algonquin left Boston Saturday
and sailed from New York at 2 p. m.
Monday. She had a nice run until she
rounded Hatteras when she stuck her
nose into a southerly gale Tuesday
morning. About midday the gale came
from the southwest, and Tuesday night
the wind blew guns from the south.
The ship was In no danger but she was
terribly shaken up. The passengers
were awfully seasick and. the ladies
never showed up for a day. It was so
rough some of the passengers received
bruises and a horse was killed out
right. A number of horses, carriages
and automobiles for Charleston were
part of the cargo.
When the Algonquin reached port
many of the passengers came ashore
and were strolling around the streets,
taking in the town till 5 p. m.. when
the ship left on her voyage south.
After this trip the Algonquin will run
between Boston, Charleston, Bruns
wick and Jacksonville. She Is one of
the largest of the Clyde steamers, being
of 2.S57 gross tons displacement, and 46
feet beam. She has 74 state rooms. 14S
berths and is allowed a passenger list of
185. She has elegant passenger cabins,
social rooms, ani a commodious dining
room. She is in fact quite a comforta
ble boat.
The man with the crutch never fails to arouse the deepest sympathy and
awaken the tenderest emotions of his more fortunate fellow being. The haggard
countenance, swollen joints and twisted and deformed limbs tell a pathetic story of
suffering such as Rheumatism alone can inflict Only those who are painfully
and slowly hobbling through life can fully realize what it means to be crutch-bound.
They feel most keenly their helpless and dependent condition when it dawns upon
them that they are no longer workers but unwilling drones in the busy world.
Rheumatism should not be neglected because the pains at first are wander
ing and slight These are only the rumblings of an approaching storm of pains
aud aches that may transfer you from a life of activity to the ranks of the crutch
bound cripples.
Rheumatism is due to acrid gritty particles being deposited in the joints
muscles and nerves by an impure and too-acid blood, and the strongest constitutions or mus
cles of iron and nerves of steel can long withstand these corroding poisons. Thev penetrate
to every fibre of the body, and no liniment, lotion or other external application can reach
ana dislodge tnein.
Finally the natural oils are consumed when there
is a creaking, grinding noise with every movement of the
limbs, the joints become locked and immovable, the mus
cles wither or contract, the nervous system gives way
and the patient becomes a physical wreck and crutch
bound cripple. Rubbing with liniments may produce
counter-irritation and afford temporary ease, but they
cannot reach and destroy these corrosive particles, which
are daily forming in the blood.
The correct treatment the true cure for Rheu
matism is a remedy that will dissolve and wash out
this inflammatory matter and expel it from the system,
and no medicine does this so promptly and thoroughly
as S. S. S. It neutralizes and eliminates from the blood
current all poisonous, noxious substances and makes the blood pure and strong again and,
as it circulates through the bod-, all effete matter is gathered up and sent out through the
proper channels. This rich new blood cools the feverish, throbbing muscles and joints and
refreshes the tired nerves, and welcome relief comes to the wretched sufferer.

Editor Messenger:
The new and popular train on the
Atlantic Coast Line which leaves Wil
mington at 6:00 o'clock a. m., and reach
es Charleston at 1:10 o'clock p. m., was
hoarded by your correspondent at
Florence Saturday at 0:45 o'clock a.
m. Captain L. C. Jones, one of the
Coast Line's popular young conductors,
was in charge and the run through was
made on time. Station after station
was passed in rapid succession till
Charleston was reached. At St. Ste
phen station the muddy Santee river, i
which originates in the pretty hills and
mountains of western North Carolina,
was crossed.
On reaching the city one of the first
things I did was to go to Mr. T. J.
Neville's bureau of information, which
s said to be proving very useful to
strangers who are in the city, for a copy
of hisCity Guide Book." Mr. Neville
has lived in Charleston all his life, is
an old newspaper man. knows a great
deal ' about the city, does business at
No. 151 King street, sells his books ror
25 cents, and charges nothing for infor
mation to strangers.
My next step was to find a home for
rhe short time I was to remain in the
city, which I did by going to the New
Pavilion hotel, on King street, opposite
to the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion building, operated by Captain J.
T. Oglesby. who was for many years
conductor on the Atlantic Coast Line.
Finding myself now settled down for
a short time in one of the old historic
southern cities, which is to be the cen
ter of attraction for the next six months
the southern states, if n
United States, on account of the great
South Carolina Inter-State and West
Indian exposition, I was ready to be
gin to take in the "City by the Sea," so
to speak, which I did by visiting a
number of places of interest for the
remainder of the day, one of which
was the new Argyle hotel, which Is to
be opened on the 10th instant and which
will be one of the finest hotels In the
citv. At this fine hotel I found Mr. J.
II. Hinton. of Wilmington, who i su
perintending the fitting up of the hotel
for the opening and who Is to be its
manager. The South Carolina Press
Association, which meets here on the
12th instant, will make the Argyle its
headquarters. By the way the Argyle

who is so highly esteemed in Wilming

exercises in the afternoon. Rev. David
Ramsey is the pastor of the Citidel
Square Baptist church, where I attend
ed. At the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation was heard the famous LlndeU's
Indian band.
A ride of about two miles brought me
to the exposition grounds. While many
of the buildings are incomplete and
scarcely any exhibits in place, the
grounds present a splendid appearance.
The exposition grounds are called the
"Ivory City." and lie right along the"

S. S. S. not only purifies the blood, but at the sanie
time invigorates and tones up the whole system, increases
the appetite, strengthens the digestion and restores the
rheumatic sufferer to sound health again.
The opening ceremonies of the great
exposition were held in the beautiful
auditorium building. The scene "was
grand and the exercises unusually in
teresting. I remarked to Mr. J. II. Hin
ton, who took in the grounds, buildings
and opening exercises with me, that
I appreciated the privilege I was then
enjoying, for I was in a great building,
containing a great audience, and lis
tening to great and patriotic speeches
and grand instrumental and vocal mu
sic. Today was the regular opening day
and the official programme was suc
cessfully carried out:
The parade was one of the greatest
ever seen in Charleston and the exer
cises in the great auditorium were
grand beyond discription.
The speech of Senator Depew was
one of the greatest it was ever my
privilege and pleasure to hear and it
greatly pleased those who heard it.
Of the Algonquin and Colonel Wad
dell. The Evening Post of Saturday
had the following complimentary no
tice: "The revenue cutter Algonquin, Cap
tain Willey. arrived in port this morn
ing from Wilmington, to take part in
the naval demonstration attending the
opening of the exposition on Monday.
"The Algonquin is one of the finest
cutters in the service, and there Is no

On board of the Algonquin, as a guest
of Captain Willey. is Hon. A. M. Wad-
