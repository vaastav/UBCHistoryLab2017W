PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fcllow-Citizevs of the Senate and home of
JieuresenUttkes:
I congratulate you on the continued
and increasing prosperity or our country.
By the favor of the Divine 1'rovidence
we have been blessed, during the wast
year, with health, with abundant liar
vests, with prolitable employment tor all
our people, and with contentment at
home, and with peace and tneiidship
with other nations.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth
election of the Chief Magistrate has af
forded another opportunity to the people
of the United States to exhibit to the
...a,.i,i .i uiiTiiiiii:int. f vuiiinlu of the neace-
iul and safe transmission of the power
and authority of government from the
public servants, whose terms of olhce are
about to expire, to their newly-chosen
successors. This example can not fail to
impress profoundly thoughtful people
of other countries with the advantages
which Republican institutions aliord.
The immediate, general and cheerful ac
quiescence of all gootl citizens, in the re
sult of the election, gives gratifying as
siiianre to our country, and to its triends
throughout the world, that a government
based on the free consent of an intelli
gent and patriotic people possesses ele
ments of strength, stability and perma
nency not found in any otber iorin of
government.
Continued opposition to the full and
free enjoyments of the rights of citizen
ship, conferred upon the colored people
bv the recent amendments to the con
stitution, still prevail in several of the
late slave-holding states. It has, per
haps, not been manifested in the recent
election to any large extentin acts of vio
lent or intimidation. It has. however,
by fraudulent practices in connection
with the ballots,.with the regulations as
to the places and manner of voting, and
with counting, returning and canvassing
the votes cast, been successful in de
feating the exercise of the right preserva
tive of all rights, the right of suffrage,
which the constitution expressly conlers
uuon our enfranchised citizens.
It is the desire of the good people of
the whole country that sectionalism as a
factor in our politics should disappear.
They prefer that no section of the coun
try should be united in solid opposition
to any other section. The disposition to
refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to
the equal-rights amendments to the con
stitution is all that now stands in the
way of a complete obliteration of sec
tional lines in our political contests. As
long as either of these amendments is
flagrantly violated or disregarded it is
sal to assume that the people who
placed them in the constitution, as em
bodying the legitimate results of the war
for the Union, and who believe them to
be wise and necessary, will continue to
act together, and to insist that they shall
be oneyed. The paramount question
Mill is. as to the enjoyment of the right
by every American citizen who has the
requisite qualifications, to freely cast his
vote and to have it honestly counted.
With this question rightly settled the
country will be relieved of the conten
tions ot the past; by-gones will indeed be
by-gones, and political and party issues
with respect to economy and elliciency
of administration, internal improve
ments, the tariff, domestic taxation, edu
cation, finance and other Important sub
jects, will then receive their full share of
attention. JJul resistance to and nullifi
cation of the resuits of the war will unite
together in resolute purpose tor their
support all who maintain the authority
of the government and the perpetuity of
the Union, ami who adequately appreci
ate the value of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no
hostile sentiment or feeling to any part
of the people of our country, or to any of
their interests. The inviolability of the
amendments rests upon the fundamen
tal principle of our government. They
are the solemn expression of the will of
the people of the United Stales.
The sentiment that the constitutional
right of allourcitlzetiH must be maintain
ed does not grow weaker. It will contin
ue to control the government of the
country. Happily, the history of the late
election shows that in many parts of the
country where opposition to the Fifteenth
Amendment has heretofore prevailed it
is diminishing, and is likely to cease al
together, if linn and well considered ac
tion is taken by Congress. I trust tho
House of Representatives and thefSenate,
which have the right to judge of the elec
tions, returns and qualifications of their
own i nbers, will see to it that every
casu of violation of the letter or spirit of
the 1'ilteentli Amendment is thoroughly
investigated, and that no benelit from
such iolation shall accrue to any person
or party. It will be the duty ot the Kx
ecutive, with sullicient appropriations for
the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all
who have been engaged in depriving cit
izens of the rights guaranteed to them by
the constitution.
It is not, however, to t forgotten that
the best and surest guarantee ofYtho pri
mary rights of citizenship is to bo found
in that capacity tor self protection which
can belong only to a people whoso right
to universal suffrage is supported by uni
versal education. Tho means at the
command of the local and state authori
ties are, in many cases, wholly inade
quate to furnish free instruction to all
who need it. This is especially true
where, before emancipation, the educa
tion of the people was neglected or pre
vented, in the interestof slavery. Firm
ly convinced that the subject of popular
education deserves the earnest attention
of the people of the whole count! y, with
a view to wise and comprehensive action
by the government ot the United States,
I respectfully recommend that Congress,
by suitable legislation and with proper
safeguards, supplement the local educa
tion. ii tunds in the several states where
the grave duties and responsibilities of
citizenship have been devolved on uned
ucated people, by devoting to the purpose
grants of the public lands, and, it neces
sary, bv appropriations from the treasury
of the United Stales. Whatever govern
ment can fairly do to promote free popu
lar education ought to be done. V here
ever general education is found peace,
virtue and social order prevail, and civil
and religious liberty are secure.
In my former annual messages I have
asked the attention of Congress to the
urgent necessity ot a reformation of the
civil-service system of the government,
ily views concerning the dangers of pat
ronage, or appointments for jwrsonal or
partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and ex
perience in the executive office, and I be
lieve these dangers threaten the stability
of the government. Abuses so serious
in their nature cannot be permanently
tolerated. They tend to become more
alarming with the enlargement of admin
istrative service, as the growth of the
country in population increases the num
ber of oflicerb and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the
adoption of Oxed rules for the regulation
of appointment, promotions ana remov
als, establishing a uniform method, hav
ingexclusively in view, in every instance,
the attainment of the best q unifications
for the position in question. Such a
method alone is consistent with the equal
rights ot all citizens, and the most econ
omical and efficient administration of the
pobli3 busloJ.
Competitive examinations, In aid of
impartial appointments and promotions,
have been conducted for some years pa3t
In several of the executive departments,
and by my direction this system has been
adoptetl in tho custom houses and post
otlicesoflhe larger cities of the country.
In the city of .New York over two thou
sand positions in the civil service have
been subject, in their appointments and
tenure of place, t3 the operation of pub
lished rules for this purpose during the
past two rears. The result of these prac
tical trials have been very satisfactory,
and have continued my opinion in favor
of this system of selection. All are sub
jected to the same tests, and the result is
tree from prejudice bv personal favor or
partisan influence. It secures for the
position applied for the best
qualifications attainable among the
competing applicants. It is an effectual
protection from the pressure of importun
ity which, under any other course pur
sued, largely exacts the time and atten
tion of appointing officers, to their great
detriment in the discharge of other olli
cial duties, preventing the abuse of the
service lor the mere furtherance of pri
vate or party purposes, and leaving the
employe ot the government, freed from
the obligations imposed by patronage, to
depend solely upon merit for retention
and advancement, and with this constant
incentive to exertion and improvement.
These valuable results have been at
tained in a high degree in the otlices
where the rules for appointment by com
petitive examination have been applied.
A method which has so approved itself
by experimental tests at points where
such tests may be fairly considered con
clusive, should be extended to all subor
dinate positions under tho government.
I believe that a strong and growing pub
lic sentiment demands immediate meas
ures for securing and enforcing the high
est possible elliciency in the civil service,
and its protection from recognized abus
es, and that the cxperianee referred to
has demonstrated the feasibility of such
measures.
The examinations in tho custom hous
es and post otlices have been held under
many embarrassments and without pro
vision for compensation for tho extra la
bor performed by the oiucers wno nae
conducted them, and whose commenda
ble interest in tho improvement of the
public service has induced this devotion
of time and labor without pecuniary re
ward. A continuance of these labors
gratuitously ought not to bo expected,
and without an appropriation by Con
gress for compensation, it is not practi
cable to extend the system of examina
tions generally throughout the civil ser
vice. It is also highly important that all
such examinations should ho conducted
upon a uniform system and under gener
al supervision. Section 1,7.": of tho re
vised statutes authorizes the President
to prescribe the regulations for admis
sion to the civi.' service of the United
States, and Tor this purpose to employ
suitable persons to conduct the requisite
inquiries with reference to " the lituess
of each candidate, in respect to age,
health, character, knowledge and ability,
for the branch of service into which he
seeks to enter;" but the law is practical
ly inoperative for the want of tho requi
site appropriation.
I therefore recommend an appropria
tion of SU'i.ObO per annum to meet the ex
penses or a commission, to be appointed
by the President in accordance with the
terms of this section, whoso duty it shall
be 1 1 devise a just, uniform and efficient
system of competitive examinations, and
to supervise the application of the same
throughout the entire civil service of the
government. I am persuaded that tho
facilities which such a company will af
ford for testing tho fitness ot those who
apply for office will not only be as wel
come a relief to members of Congress as
it will be to the President and heads of
departments, but that it will also greatly
tend to remove the causes of embarrass
ment which now inevitably and constant
ly attend the conflicting claims of pat
ronage between the legislative and exec
utive departments. Tho most effectual
check upon the pernicious competition
of influence and official favoritism, in the
bestowal of office, will be the substitution
of an open competition of merit between
the applicants, in which every one can
make his own record, with tho assurance
that h's success will depend upon this
alone. .
I also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving every officer as free as any
other citizen to express his political opin
ions and to use his means for their ad
vancement, shall also enable hi in to feel
as safe as any private citizen in refusing
all demands upon his salary for political
purposes. A law which should thus guar
antee true liberty and justice to all who
are engaged in tho public service, and
likewise contain stringent provisions
against the use of official authority to co
erce tho political action of private citi
zens or of official subordinates is greatly
to be desired.
The most serious obstacle, however, to
an improvement of tho civil service, and
especially to a reform in the method of
appointment and removal, has been
found to be the practice, under what is
known as the spoils system, by which the
appointing power has been so largely en
croached upon bv members of Congress.
Tho first step in the reform of the civil
service must be a complete divorce be
tween Congress and the executive in tho
matter of appointments. The corrupting
doctrine, that " to the victors belong the
spoils,' is inseparable from Congression
al patronage as tho established rule and
practice of parties in power. It conies
to e understood by applicants for office,
and by people generally, that the Repre
sentatives and Senators are entitled to
disburse the patronage of their respect
ive districts and states. It is not neces
sary to recite at length the evils resulting
from this Invasion of the executive func
tions. The true principles of govern
ment on the subject of appointments to
office, as stated in the national conven
tions of the leading parties of the coun
try, have again and again been approved
by the American people, and have not
been called in question in any quarter.
These authentic expressions of public
opinion upon this all important subject,
are the statement of principles that be
long to the constitutional government.
" Under the constitution, the Presi
dent and heads of departments are to
make nominations for office. The Sen
ate is to advise and consent to appoint
ments, and the House of Representatives
is to accuse and prosecute faithless offic
ers. The best interests of the public ser
vice demands that these distinctions be
respected; that Senators and Representa
tives, who may bo judges and accusers,
should not dictate appointments to
office." To this end the co-operation of
the legislative department of the govern
ment is reqired alike by the necessities
of the case and by public opinion. Mem
bers of Congress will not be relieved from
the demands made upon them with refer
ence to appointments to office until, by
legislative enactment, the pernicious
practice is condemned and forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an
act be passed delining the relations of
members of Congress with respect to ap-
rjlntment to office by the President, and
also recommend that the provisions of
section 1167, and of the sections follow
ing, ot the reviaed statutes, comprising
the tenure-of-office act of March 3, lstn,
be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our coun
try is one of the highest and most imper
ative duties of statesmanship, and that it
can be permanently done only by tho co
operation of the legislative and execu
tive departments ot the government, I
again commend tho whole subject to your
considerate attention.
It is the recognized duty and purpose
of the people ot the United States to
suppress polygamy where it now ex
ists in our territories, and to prevent its
extension. Faithful and zealous efforts
have been made by the United States
authorities in Utah to enforce the laws
against it. Kxperience has shown that
the legislation upon this subject, to be
effective, requires extensive modification
and amendment. The longer action is
delayed, the more difficult will It be to
accomplish what is desired. Prompt and
decided measures aro necessary. The
Mormon sectarian organization which
upholds polygamy has the whole power
of milking and executing the local legis
lation of the territory. My its control of
the grand and petit juries, it possesses
large inllueiice over the administration of
justice. Kxercising, as tho heads of this
sect do, the local political power of the
territory, they are able to make effective
their hostility to the law of Congress on
the subject of polygamy, and, in fact, do
prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will
not be abolished if the enforcement of
the law depends on those who practice
and uphold the crime. It can only be
suppressed by taking away the political
power of the sect which encourages and
sustains it. The power of Congress to
enact suitable laws to protect the territo
ries is ample. It is not a case of half
way measures. The political power of
tho Mormon sect is increasing; it controls
now one of our wealthiest ami most pop
ulous territories. It is extending stead
ily into other territories. Wherever it
goes it establishes polygamy and secta
rian political power. The sanctity of
marriage and the family relation are the
corner-stone of our American society
and civilization. Religious liberty and
the separation of church and state are
among the elementary ideas of free in
stitutions. To re-establish the interests
and principles which polygamy and Mor
inonisni have imperilled, and to fully re
open to intelligent and virtuous immi
grants of all creeds that part of our do
main which hits been, in a great degree,
closed to general immigiatiou by intoler
ant and immoral institutions, it is recom
mended that the government of the ter
ritory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for
the government of Utah by a Governor
and Judges, or uoninnssioiiers appointed
by the President and confirmed by the
Senate a government analogous to the
provisional government established for
the territory northwest of tho Ohio by
the ordinance of 17S7. If, however, it is
deemed best to continue the existing
form of local government, I recommend
that the right to vote, hold office and sit
on juries in the territory of Utah be con
lined to those who neither practice nor
uphold polygamy. If thorough measures
are adopted, it is believed that within a
few years the evils which now alllict
Utah will be eradicated, and that this
territory will in good time become one of
the most prosperous and attractive or the
new states of the Union.
Our relations with all foreign countries
have been those of undisturbed peace,
and have presented no occasion for con
cern as to their continued maintenance.
My anticipation of an early reply from
the British (iovernineiitto the demand of
indemnity to our lishermen for the inju
ries suffered by that industry at Fortune
Hay, in January, 1S78, which I expressed
in my last annual message, was disap
pointed. This answer was received only
in the latter part of April in the present
year, and, when received, exhibited a
failure of accord between the two gov
ernments, iu to tho measure of the inshore-fishing
privilege secured to our
lishermen by the treaty of Washington,
of so serious a character that I made it
tho8ubjeet of a communication to Con
gress, lu which I recommended the adop
tion of the measures which seemed to me
proper to be taken by this government in
maintenance of the rights accorded to
our lishermen under tho treaty, and to
wards securing an indemnity for the in
jury these interests had suffered. A bill
to carry out these recommendations was
under consideration by the House of
Representatiues at the time of tho ad
journment of Congress in June last.
Within a few weeks I have received a
communication from Her Majesty's Gov
ernment, renewing the consideration of
the subject, both of the indemnity for
the injuries at Fortune Bay, and or the
interpretation of trie treaty in which the
previous correspondence had shown tho
two governments to beat variance. Upon
both these topics the disposition towards
a friendly agreement is manifested by a
recognition of our right to an indemnity
for the transaction at Fortune Ray, leav
ing the measure of such indemnity to
further conference, and by an assent to
the view of this government, presented
iu the previous correspondence, that the
regulation of conflicting interests of the
shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts,
and the vessel fishery of our lishermen,
should be made the subject of confer
ence and concurrent arrangement be
tween the two governments.
I sincerely hope that the basis may be
found in a speedy adjustment of the very
serious divergence ot views iu the inter
pretation of the fishery clauses of the
treaty of Washington, which, us the cor
respondence between the governments
stood iit the close or the last session of
Congress, seemed to be irreconcilable.
In the important exhibition of arts and
industries, which was held hist year at
Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in
that now in progress at Melbourne, the
United States have been efficiently and
honorably represented. The exhibitors
from this country at the former place re
ceived a large number of awards in some
of the most considerable departments,
and the participation of the United States
was recognized by a special mark of dis
tinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne
the share taken by our country is no less
notable, ami an equal degree of success
is confidently expected.
The state of peace and tranquillity now
enjoyed by all the nations of the conti
nent ot Europe, has its favorable influ
ence upon our diplomatic and commer
cial relations with them. We have con
cluded and ratilied aconvention with the
French republic for the settlement of
claims of citizensof eitfiercountry against
the other. Under this convention a com
mission, presided over by a distinguished
publicist, appointed, in pursuance ot the
requestor both nations, by his majesty,
ttie Emperor of Ilrazil, has been organ
ized and has begun its sessions in this
city. A congress to consider means for
the protection of industrial property has
recently been in session in Paris, to which
I have appointed the Ministers of the
United States In France and in Belgium
as delegates. The international commis
sion upon weights and measures also con
tinues its work in Paris. 1 invite your
attention to Uie necessity of an appropria
tion to be made in time to enable this
