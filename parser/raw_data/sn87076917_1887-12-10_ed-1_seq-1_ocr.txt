nFDUGE THE TARIFF
So says the president. A
popular Christmas cry, that.
Everybody wants "tariff" re
duced, so as to make the hol
iday money go as far as possi
ble. We know that. We
have acted on the knowlege.
In such seasonably suitable
things as Mufflers, Si k Hand
kerchiefs in fancy embroid
ered and initial. Smoking
Jackets and Umbrellas of all
kinds, and we have reduced
the tariff on them right down
to wholesale pricess for the
single purchase.
AS TO CLOTHING.
We make the clothing we
sell. We know the stuff that
is in it and the work that is in
it. We sell direct to wearers
of clothing; we sell at such
prices that there is no room
for dealers' profits, but only
manufacturers' profits. That
this is your advantage you
need not be told.
If you are for serviceable
var in Suits or Overcoats,
Rubber Goods or Hats, we
have everything a little
cheaper than everybody else.
Come see us about it.

he could ssy was that his bank had handled
the sale paper of Tlmberlake's, with en
dorsement by Wilshire, and the court ruled
It all out as Incompetent
Timberlake, himself, was called. He
said Wllshire never bought for him, nor he
for Wilshlre. Wllshire had simply en
dorsed soma of his paper.
Mr. Blackburn said his purpose was to
show that Wllshire' testimon) that he had
bought for Harper, only, was not true.
The court reminded counsel that
Wllshire had testified that he
bought a million bushels en
his own account, and If the) could show l.e
had bought more than this it might be done.
Witness was excused.
Edgar Starke, bank cashier, was called
to tell of the Timberlake transaction, but it
was ruled out. and Blaakburn said, "Under
that ruling of court we have no further

Mr. Harper and his counsel withdrew for
consultation. Deputy Marshal Mouer fol

called out. In fifteen minutes the parties
all returned, and Mrs. Harper wascarrvlng

its white hood and displayed its lovely head
ana face, fair hair, bright, eyes, hne com
plexion and full face.
There was a whispered consultation at
the table for a minute or two, during which

New YoKh, Dec ID. The Blaine inter

democrats the Interview has a dismal effect
Some say that Cleveland has plared direct

half the senators and members lingered
around the capitol )esterday, writing or
discussing among themsch es the president's

the selection of Chicago as the place for
holding tie republican convention, and the
repeated statement that Mr. Scott of Penn
s)lvania, had been determined upon as the
head of the bouse committee on waj s and
means.
Members of the house refer to the Inter

The Dunlsp opera company presented
"The Black Hussar" at the Grand last
night to a small but enthusiastic audience.
The opera wasadmlrably rendered, and had
the coinpanj had the stimulus of a big
house, the performance would have been
one of the most brilliant productions of
comic opera offered to Springfield patrons
for a long time. But the "beggarly arra)
of erupt) benches" had the effect of dis
heartening the company, and the effect was
visible In fhe peformance. Notwitlistand
ing. the opera was produced very accepta-
iiy. ana uie company is a urge anu capaoie
one. Springfield pretends to enjoy comic
opera, but it poorly rewards the local man
ageis when tbey bring it here. Manager
Dunlap, who has managed McCanll's com
panies for) ears, told a reporter last night
that he never played to expenses iu Spring-
held in his life.
The Dunlap company includes about
thirty-five people ami the chorus is a magnif
icent one. The principal artists are of
high ability. Harry Brown, who created
the role of Lorenzo In Mascotte.and Mount'
jo) Walker, who has been seen here be
fore, were very funny as Uackenback, the
magistrate, and Piffkow, his factotum. Mr.
Cnarles T. Dungan was graceful and
stately as Von Helbert, the Black Hussar,
and Miss Johnson, Miss Stanley and Miss
Falrbalrn were excellent as Minna, Ilosetta
and Barbara, respectively. The costumes
were very pretty, and altogether the
"Black Hussar" was worth) of a big house.
Mr. Charles T. Ellis and his excellent
compaii) gave another performance of that
charming comedy-drama, "Casper, the
Yixller," at Black's, last night to a de
lighted audl-ie. Mr. Ellis will alwa)s be
warmly weltorned in Springfield.

That grand spectacular play. "At und

duced at the Grand on Monday night by a
very strong and capable company. The
following reference to this pla), clipped
from the Cincinnati Ennnlrcr. will be of
Interest to tbe ladies:
"It proved Itself a great matinee card at
Heuck's ) eaterday afternoon The theater
was packed with ladles ami children, all of
whom greatly enjojed tbe spectacular.
The piece is doing a phenomenal business
this week, the house being sold at every
performance, before the rise of the curtain.
Many after-wltnessinc the performance, go
to see it again, as one seldom sees such an
all around clever production. The scenery
and spectacular effects are really Immense
and outdo all former attempts, while, un
like other spectacular shows the coin pan v
in itself is an exceptionally strong one."
Seats are now on sale at Harris's,

Pat Rooney. the inimitable, will be at
Black's next Tuesday evening In that side
splitting piece. "Pat's Wardrobe." The
Manchester Union says of it:
" The popular Pat Kooney drew a fair
sized audience to the opera house last even
ing, to laugh at his eccentric delineation of
farcical Irish character. It proved an en
tertaining evening as the hearty laughter
of the audience attested. His new play,
' Pat's Wardrobe.' is the best setting that
Pat Itooney has bad for tbe display ot his
specialty. As Pat O'HooIlhan,' Rooney
appears without variation from his familiar
line. The part created for Katie Rooney.
under the title of 'Christopher,' gives the
little lady plenty of room to display a clever
tslent that is rapidly developing." The

If
the Followlnc Pncta Are True They

The following Is going the rounds of the
Ohio papers: "Eleven prisoners were pa
rolled from the Ohio penitentiary )esterday.
One of these was a Springfield man. Harry
Jones whose record was clean d and his
parole granted, to take effect December 15.
He was received from Clark county for
hve years for burglar)" and lareeuy. This
prisoner has considerable of a record, hav
ing been a fashionable society man at one
time, lie married a daughter of a wealth)
southerner, and she is living with her
father in Tennessee at present ignorant of
her husband's w hereabouts. He. Ls going to
rev eal the secret, and having emplo) ment
in Columbus, will send for his famil)."
The above facts are somewhat exagger
ated. Harrv Jones was sent up from this
city at the time mentioned for burglarizing
the house of Mrs Belle Williams, of west
High street between Center and Market
streets. But nothing came out of the trial
to indicate his romantic marriage w ith any
southern girl, neither did lie ever figure in
Sprtngheld viciety. He was simply a dis

A shocking accldentoccurred on the Ohio

resulting in the instant death ot A. Dye. a
freight brakernan.
A local freight, westward bound, con
ducted by John Kibble, was coming down
the hill this side of Harris station and be
tween Harris and Storms when the acci
dent happened. D)e was walking along
the top of one of the cars when his feet
slipped from under him and he fell
headlong between two cars and In an in
stant was swept under the wheels. He
gave one despairing cry as he fell and then
the cars jolted v ery perceptibly as they
struck his body. The train was stopped as
soon as possible and D)e's train mates went
back to the scene of the accident The
poor fellow's body was found partly on and
partly beside the track, and mangled almost
bevud recognition. Death had evidently
resulted instantly, as the head
was severed almost completely from the
body, both arms were cut off, and the upptr
part of tin- body was horribly crushed.
The remains were removed to llalnbridge.
where the) were prepared for burial, and
today they were taken to D)e's home at

A VERITABLE ART BAZAR.
Oeeeriptlon or Mr. VV. II. irhtiua'e Magnif
icent llollflajr lilsplar
It Is a genuine pleasure for anyone with
arusuc tastes to enter me art anu queens-
ware stole of W. II. Schaus, No 4t south
Market street Many of the merchants of
Springfield are laying In big holiday stocks,
anu tney make a nice display, but some
how, the interior of Mr. Schaus's hand
some store Impresses one with a feeling
entirely different from that customarily
aroused. It is much more like entering the
siuuio or some art amateur, whose pen
chant Ls the collection of rare and exquisite
china and bric-a brae A coimolfcur
could enter Mr. Schaus's store and find ma
terial upon which ids artistic instincts
could revel for days. Last night when the
RKi-cnuc reporter v isited the store, it was
flashing with the light of countless lamps
and all aglow with the illumination glinted
back by such an array of rich goods as one
might never hope to seo in tie town of
Springfield. An inspection of such a
stock was nothing less than a" genuine
treat.
The first line which attracted the report
r's special attention wxs the exquisite dis
play ot Japanese brlc i-bruc. which Is such
a rage now In most circles There were
dainty Japanese rose-jars, shaped like an
Inverted pear, and ornamented with a rich
grotesqueness that baffles description; jjot
pnurrl jars, tilled with a fragrant material
of dned flower petals whose odor lasts for
years; fancy Japanese tib'e ornaments of
all shapes and sizes and colors. Including
the rich, blue and the flaming v ellow of the
Orient Mr. Schaus has the rose and put
jtourri jars in every size and price and they
are the prevailing craze tills )ear for holi
day presents.
Mr. Schaus's display of lamps, plain,
fancy, ornamental and luxurious Is not to
be approached in the cit). Some of them
are perfect artistic gems, aud will make
superb Christmas gifts
A display that charmed the writer was
the vast array of dainty decorated China.
In this line Mr. Schaus acknowledges no
superior in Central Ohio. He has It in such
illimitable variety that one feels that sense
of confusion which accompanies the in
spection of anything vast or complicated.
Some of this China, particularly
mat which Is the creation of Havlln. of
I.amoges, France. Is Indescribable dainty.
The great patterer's name is a household
won! In art circles aud he turns out goods
as dainty as egg shells and so translucent
that one can almost read through them.
In art-porcelain the stock is unrivalled and
any art connolteur in Springheld, whether
he be a purchaser or not, ought not to miss
seeing it A pleasing feature of the store
Is the "bench show 'that is the dozen of
pug dogs made of terra cotta and In every
size, ion have doubtless noticed theinun
the window.
But It Is a futile task to attempt
tempt to convey any idea of this brilliant
stock In any ordinary newspaper account
There Ls something there to please every
body and ever) body should go. Mr. Schaus
keeps queensware and table-ware In vast
variety and you can find whatever) on need,
whe her for its beauty or its utility, at prices
that are likely to surprise ) on.
A BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN.
Vimu Jarbean taatche. n Clillil From
the sery Jaw. or Death.
Miss Vernona Jarbeau, the petite and
sparkling actress, who is a great favorite in
Springfield, has suddenly become a heroine,
as bf Shown by the following dispatch from
New Camlet, Pa.: v
As the train on the E. P. road bound
for Pittsburg, due here at 3?22 a, m.. drew
into tbe depot this morning. Charles White
and wife, of Erie, and their 4 ) ear old
child, en route to Altoona, stepped from
the train to walk on the platform a few
moments. The baby ran from the platform
on to the track as a freight train approached.
Everybody expected to see the child crushed
to death. The members of the Vernona
Jarbeau company were boarding the
train for Pittsburg to go to Johnstown.
Miss Jarbeau saw what happened as she
emerged from the station, ran rapidly
across the platform and first truck, reached
the child, and. by herculean effort suc
ceeded In drawing the little one av-ay just
before the train reached that portion ot the
track where the child had stood a moment
before. The train passed so close it threw
the noble woman to the ground, but neither
she nor the child were hurt The parents
of the child were so badly stared they could
hardly thank Miss Jarbeau. All parties
left on tbe train for Pittsburg. The act
was a most courageous one. Jeff Bern
stein, Jarbeau's husband, became so sick at
his wife's peril he could hardly get on the
train.

And the right place yesterday

" there are more people in this
store than in ail the other
dry goods stores put to
gether." Anyway, WS can
say that we have seen no such
rush of business since the day
before last Christmas. LatJits,
we respectfully thank yea far
the confidence yeu have
shewn in sur simple state
ments as set forth day ay
d iy in this column of the
"Republic." That we will do
our best to retain that confi
dence you may rest assured.
Next Friday you will nnd bet
ter bargains than ever with
us. Count on it, bank on it if
you will, for just as sure. as
the day comes, you'll get
cheap dry goods here.
For Monday we'll offer good
bargains in Dress Goods ; the
lot of goods expected for Sat
urday have arrived and are on
sale. (50c Dress Goods for
25c). that's what we told you,
isn't it ? Come and see.
Respectfully,
