A GREAT FIGURE
FUNSTON AND THE BAPTISTS
Although one may try to appreciate
the point of view of General Funston
in his controversy with Dr. Gambrell,
one is compelled to take issue with
the commander of the American
forces. Dr. Gambrell, one gathers
from the correspondence as publish
ed in the Literary Digest and the
newspapers, merely asked for the
privilege of holding meetings among
the soldiers without in any wise ob
jecting to confirm to military roles
in the camp. The general assum
ed that the Baptist intended to arouse
the emotions of the soldiers, preach
to them that soldiering is unpatriotic
and make them dissatisfied with army
life. i
That was not the point at all. Even
if Dr. Gambrell did propose to con
duct revivals, the meetings would be
intended to quicken the spiritual
life of the troops and to make them
better men. Cromwell's psalm-singing
Roundheads were good soldiers
with all of their piety, and we have
been told that some of the greatest
revivals ever held were those in the
Confederate armies.
General Funston apparently did not
wait to hear the plans of the Bap
tist leader, but merely waved him
aside, and the general's explanation
that Baptist preachers are chaplians
In the army scarcely covers the sit
uation. The feeling is general that
the so-called evangelicals are discrim
inated against in favor of other
churches, when we daresay there are
more of the former n the army than
of the latter.
Chicago Herald. ,
t i imnnasihlA for friend of foe to
withhold admiration from Belgium's
heroic primate, Cardinal mercier.
The fearless prelate fulfills the finest
traditions of his ornce. L,iKe one
saints, he boldly stands
out, one man against an army, daring
al, reiving only on tne saiuuy ui iu
high ulllce and the intrepid heart
thin him. In the midst
of ruthless, materialistic, agnostic
war Jlcrcier yields not. rreacner ui
f brotherhood, exponent of
a philosophy of non-resistance, Jler-
cier interposes ueaanuy tne mau.
of a just plea between his people and
thn ntwcpno events of wanton war.
The king and the army gone, he
alone is left to express a nations
soul. To the outside world now the
irreat cardinal is Belgium. All the
fl'prinL concentrates m
v,;m All the neoole's need voices it-
solf through him. ,He is the sole
Bimlipsman.
His latest appeal against the de
portation of his countrymen to Ger
many for enforced labor is not the
hie of his lonsr list of ex
ploits. Outright slavery could, of
course, never be introduced in Eu
rope today. The world is too liberal.
German liberals find it no less de
testable than do Belgians, French
men, Englishmen or Americans. But
tl-it. ilpn(rt.:itions such as Cardinal Mer-
cier describes are dangerously close
to slavery. They add a new norror
to the frightl'ulness of war. For in
other ages actual slavery arose out of
just such conditions. The conquer
ing of neighbors and the transpor
tation of the men back to the land
of the victorious, where the vanquish
ed were forced to toil upon an alien
soil that, in brief, is the evil history
of human slavery. Against its tem
porary reappearance the Belgian pri
mate struggles. He speaks for his
own people and at the same time he
gives voice to all the idealism the
world has accumulated during the
mrps. ATereier will live, because to
love freedom passionately, to be
willing to lose all in tne name oi nu
mnn lihertv. is to court imomralitv in
the memory of men.-Of all the great
figures of this the greatest oi wars
none for sheer nobility overtops
Belgium's gallant spokesman Car
dinal Mercier.

leadership, the class will attain ja
place of even greater usefulness in

HOW TO CLEAN SPECTACLES
Uai-o isn't, mnre than one person
I in a thousand who knows the proper
j wav to clean eyeglasses ana spec
tacles.
The proper way is as follows:
Take a small quantity of household
ammonia in a suitable vessel, say a
saucer, then with a half worn out
tooth brush wash the glasses getting
into all the crevices, etc., then rinse
off with clean water and wipe dry
with any clean soft cloth, bleeched
cheese cloth is fine.
The next best thing is soda water,
a teaspoonful to half cup water used
as above. The washing of glasses
preserves them to a great extent and
is the most sanitary. It also makes
glasses stay on better.
