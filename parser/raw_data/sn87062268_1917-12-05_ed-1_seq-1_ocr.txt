" wlLon today asked congress to
JmedJately declare war on Austria
Hungary, and congress, v responding
gn of approval, began setting
itself about the work.
The genate foreign relations com
mittee and the house foreign , affairs
Momitwe. which must deal with the
irresolution, were called to meet to
morrow. .??' -; .". -k '
The resolution, drafted by the inter
Eaknal law experts of the state de
ment, will be introduced and lead
er," av probably will be passed by
foth houses of congress ' by Friday
night. V''virr';?-
Xh president did not . recommend
declarations of war with Turkey or
Bulgaria, Germany's other allies, .at
this time. - f '. . " -- 'A , - . V l
Some members of congress, believ
ing they should be Included, have an
counced their intention of attempting
to amend the war resolution,' v
Most administration leaders, . how
ver, realize that the : president may
have a diplomatic reason for not in
cluding Turkey- and Bulgaria, and the
war resolution probably will pass as
lie president wants it.
Before a crowded hall of -congress,
ishlch included high officials of the
American government and representa
tives of many r foreign ; nations, the
president spoke the words which, he
said, he considered necessary to the
nccessful prosecution of the:, war.
Even though Austria is the tool of
Germany and not her own mistress, he
said, she stands in the path of "Amer
ica's part in the world struggle for

hedged 'again all the ; resources and

Appealing to congress-to devote all
its energies to the successful prose
cution of. the war, the president closed
his address by declaring anew the de-r
termination of the United States not
lo lay down the sword until a right
eons peace is achieved. .
The Message.
The president spoke as follows: ,
"Gentlemen of the Congress: '
Eight months have elapsed since!
last had the honor of addressing; you.
They have been months crowded with
events of immense and grave signifi
cance for us. I shall, not undertake to
detail or even to summarize these
fvents. The Dractlcal A particulars of
4e part we have played in , them will
' 'aid before you in the reports of
the executive departments. I shall dis
cos only our present outlook upon
&ese vast affairs, our present - duties
si the immediate means of accom
plishing the objects we shall hold al
ways in view. - V1,.': 'h-JL''h',.
1 shall not go back to debate the
u$es of the war. j l The intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
"T the sinister masters of Germany
kve long since become too grossly
Wous to every true - American to
S5d to be rehearsed.
"But I shall ask you to consider
'sain and with a very grave scrutiny
6 objectives and the measures ; by
'Mrh we mean to attain them, for the
iose of discussion here in this
P.aee 0f action, and our action must
w straight towards definite ends.
-t object is. of course, to win the

spokesmen of the American

people and they have a right to know
wnether" their purpose is ours.
"They desire peace by the overcoming-
of evil. by. the defeat once for all
of the sinister forces that interrupt
peace and render" it- impossible,- and
they wish to; know how closely our
thought . runs with "theirs and what
action" we propose. .
'They are impatient with those who
desire peace', by any sort of . compro
mise deeply and indignantly impa
tientbut they .vwlll be equally impa
tient with ; us if ; we do not make it
plain to them what our objectives are
and what we are planning for in seek
ing to make conquest of peace by arms.
"I -- believe that I . speak ; for them
when I say two things: First, that this
intolerable Thing of which the masters
of Germany have shown us the ugly
face, this menace of combined intrigue
and force, which we now see so clear
ly as : the : German t- power; . a Thing
without conscience or . honor or. capac
ity for covenanted peace. ; must be
crushed. 4 and. if it ? be - not : utterly
brought a to an end, : at least shut out
from the friendly .( Intercourse of ., the
nations; : and, second, that 'when this
Thing and its power , are Indeed ' de
feated and the time comes that 5 we
can discuss peace when " the German
people " have spokesmen whose word
we can believe, and when those spokes
men are ready in ; the name of - their
people to accept the common judgment
of the nations as to what shall hence
forth be the bases of law and of cove
nant for the life of the world we shall
be willing and glad to pay, the full
price for peace, and pay it ungrudg
ingly. We know " what that price will
be. It will be full, impartial - justice
justice done at every point and to ev
ery nation that the final - settlement
must affect our enemies as well as our
friends. , , - .
"You catch, with- me, the ivoices of
humanity that are in the air. -They
grow daily more audible, more articu
late,, more persuasive, and - they . come
from the hearts of men-everywhere.
They insist that the -war shall not end
in vindicative action of any kind; that
no nation or people shall be robbed or
punished -: because , the --- Irresponsible

selves , done deep and. abominable
wrong.. y It-; is ' this - thought that has
been expressed in the formula 'no an
nexations, no contributions, no puni
tive indemnities... Just because this
crude formula expresses the instinctive
judgment as to right of plain men ev
erywhere has been made diligent use
of by the masters of German intrigue
to lead the people" of Russia astray
and the people of every other country
their agents could reach, in order that
a premature peace might be , brought
about? . before A autocracy has been
taught its final and convincing lesson,
and the people of - the world put - in
control of their own destinies. , :
"But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a just idea is no reason
why a right use should not be made
of . It. It ought to be C brought under
the patronage of ' Its real friends.
Let it be said again that .autocracy
must, first' be shown the utter futility
of its claims to power or leadership in
the modern worlds It is impossible to
apply any standard of justice so .long
as such forces are unchecked and un
defeated i as : thei present: masters of

has been done can right be set up as
arbiter and peace-maker -among . the
nations. - But when that has been done
as, God willing, it assuredly will be
we shall at last be free to do an
unprecedented thing, and , this is the
time to " avow our, purpose to . do it.
We shall be free to base peace on gen
erosity a.nd justice, to the exclusion of
all selfish claims to advantage even on
the part of the victors. A . -Task
Is- to Win War.
"Let'there be no misunderstanding.
Our present and immediate task is to
win the war. and nothing shall turn us
aside from it until it is accomplished.
Every power and resource we possess,
whether of, men, of money. Or of ma
terials, is being devoted and will, con
tinue to be devoted to that purpose,
until it is achieved. Those who de
sire to bring peace about, before that
purpose is achieved I, counsel to car
ry their advice elsewhere.- We will
not entertain it.. We shall regard the
warAi as won A only when the German
people say to us. through properly ac
credited representatives, that they are
ready' to agree to a settlement based
upon " justice and the reparation of
the wrongs their rulers a have done.
They have done a wrong to Belgium
which must be repaired. They have
established a power over other lands
and peoples than their own over the
great empire of Austria-Hungary, over
hitherto free Balkan states, over Tur
key, and within Asia which must be
relinquished."
"Germany's success by skill, by in
dustry, by - knowledge, by enterprise
we did not grudge, or oppose, but ad
mired, rather. She had built up for
herself a real empire of trade and in
fluence, secured bythe.peace of the
world. We were c- tez-t to"bide the

lENt BULLET
IS
Plans Being Perfected for
New Anti-Craft Shot .
for the Zeppelins., '.'
INVENTOR NOW IN i
CITY FOR WINTER '
Is Anxious to Secure Early
and Rigid Test of His
Original Patent.
Plans are being- perfected by I A.
Schurman for a new, anti-aircraft bul
let to be used against air invaders,
and the inventor, who livts in Har
vard. HI., but who is spending- the win
ter in Pensacola, expects to present
the completed models to the govern
ment at an early date. ,
The new bullet might be termed an
aerial dumdum, for while it does not
flatten out to do Its work, the theory
is the same. Mr. Schurman la very ,
anxious to obtain an immediate trial
of the bullet, and offers- it without j
cost to the United States, saytn that
he is too old to fight personally, but !
that he wants to do everything- e can
to help win the war. ' !
In construction the bullet resembles i
any other bullet. except that 1n
grooves along the projectile there are
placed long arms, meeting" at a point
several inches above the apex of th
projectile. When the bullet is Inserted ,
in the gun the arms lying- in the.
grooves form a smooth wairwlth the t
outer surface of the shell, and do not'
lnterefere with the firing. As soon as
the projectile leaves the mouth of the '
gun', however, the arms fall back on1
the base, at right angles to the side
of -the shell, , and present a much
larger, -destructive surface - than . the
simple - iroJectileAfci' -a.-.
To allow for - the spinning of the
shell in flight, : the arms are slightly
curved to minimize wind resistance.
and prevent interference with aim. .
If the bullet proves suooessful it is
expected to verolntionlze aerial war
fare by increasing the effectiveness of
land batteries . for use against air
planes. Repeated instances in the war
have revealed the fact that an air
plane may be riddled with bullets, but
that unless the motor propeller or con
trols are hit directly there is llttlo"
damage, and even though forced to
descend the crippled machine can
usually regain its own lines. '
With the Invention of Mr. Schur
man a three-inch shell, which might
otherwise simply puncture a wing sur
face, would rip the entire plane vff,
completely wrecking the airplane.
Mr. Schurman, while mainly inter
ested in the bullet, has prepared plans
for a new type airplane, which he
will doubtless submit for consideration ;
as soon as they are finished. Beinrf
interested ln airplanes and desirous of
spending the winter in Florida, h
very naturally selected Pensacola, and ;
expressed himself as delighted with '
the climate here.,,.X''-V(: ----- -
