You cannot waste
Mr. Bennett says:
tomorrow: it is kept for you. You cannot
waste the next hour: it is kept for you.
But you know all too well, that some
one else can waste it for you.
One secret of the success of the movies
is that it is such a pleasant way to waste
one's own time. If we plan to do some
special kind of work, and hoard our hours
for that purpose, just efs likely as not,
someone will come in and quietly steal
those hours from us. without the least
compunction.
So we go to the movies
we may lose ourselves in the atmosphere
of valor and romance, dare-deviltry, and
heroism, and no one will take these from
us, for the movies, like the poor, we.have
always with us, and they belong to all.
