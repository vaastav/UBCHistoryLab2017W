NEW TORK Dec 2 Prior to the pub
lication of the Presidents messaRfe to
Cong ess stock market movements while
bomewhat Irregular were generally to
ward a loner let el Scrutiny of the doc
ument produced apparently a reassuring
effect and rt all ccnts there was socn
after midday a general and material rally
in prices
-The attitude assumed by the President
tpon the so called trust question ap
peared to meet with general commenda
tion With the present lesson ot the
Amalgamated Copper concern In mind the
public at large and the Wall Street com
munity In particular is quite ready to ap
plaud any recommendation that a proper
amount of publicity In regard to tho af
fairs of the industrial combinations
should be enforced by law
Itilly of liirciHniIiiir Clrtnictr
President Roosevelt however also lalJ
stress upon the folly and the futility of
the unreasoning clamor against the great

olutlon The Presidents message dis
posed summarily of the reports which
were current some time ago that he
would urge strongly restrictive and even
prohibitive legislation against the trusts
although why any such ideas should have
been accepted In icw of his solemn as
surances upon tbo occasion ot his taking
the oath ot oHce is not easy to under
stand
The position assumed by tho President
upon other of the Eevcral great political
and financial questions of the time was
also decidedly eficctive in giving a more
confident tone to the spetulatlon ban it
has had for several days
The general market opened fairly steady
tut It soon relapsed Into the irregularity
and weakness which marked yestcrda af
ternoons dealings acd a number of stocks
broke very badly Cases in point wtre
Great Northern St Pnul and Union Pa
rlSr all cf which were unfavorably af
fected ty the current attacks en the le
gality of the formation of tho Ncrchern
Securities Company emanating In the
Western States and supplemented in other
directlccs
Selling Ijy Weitlcrii llonncf
Western houses continued heav sellers
ot these stocks but the largely Increased
borrowing demand fcr them In the loan
marKet indicated that much of the selling
was fcr short account It Is not alone in
these stocks howeter ttat an increased
borrowing demand appeared for It was
evident practically In every direction
Other notably weak features of the
early dealings were the Vanderbllt stocks
which hofffier subsequently recoered
rapidly and Texas and Pacific In the
industrial quarter the trading was active
but a fairly firm tone prevailed there
Notwithstanding a further reduction in
the price of copper In the London metal
market and yesterdays reduction in the
dividend on Boston and Monfana stock
Amalgamated Copper was for the time
being firm
It seemed to be the common opinion
that about all the untoward developments
possible bearing upon this had now
been made known and largely on this the
ory quite a IUcly covering of short con
tracts was conducted Other firm fea
tures In this direction were Pacific Mall
Tennessee Coal and Iron General Elec
tric and Peoples Gas
Itnlly Kollovtx the JJcnnjrc
The Industrial quarter generally speak
ing moved In line with the rest of the
market being weak In the forenoon and
rallying after the publication of the Pres
idents me sage The United States Steel
stocks were logically favorably influenced
by the recommendations of the Execu
tive rtgardlng industrial combinations
while Sugar was favorably influenced by
the suggestions that the duties Ga Cuban
products should be reduced
The London market for American stocks
did not reflect the unsettlcmont which
prevailed at the close here yesterday
and In fact was quoted above parity with
jesterdays local final prices
Foreign liuuses on balance were buy
ers hero to a moderate extent Sterling ex
change was easier as a nult ot yestcr
da s engagements of gold for export and
the money market was fairly steady with
the bulk of the borrowing en cal effected
between 4 and 4 per cent
CoiipcrH jVesv Loir Lei pi
With the course of the afternoon Amal
gamated Copper developed renewed weak
ness and declined to the lowest figure the
stock has yet attained As was to be ex
pected the renewed weakness In Amalga
mated checked the improving tendency In
the remainder of the market and led to a
general reaction
There was nothing novel bearing upon
the stock and its decline seemed to be
owing simply to a fresh outburst of the
liquidation which has been conducted in
the stock for the past three months The
dealings In Amalgamated overshadowed
those In the remainder of the market
throughout

inmim w u u mtuu The presidents mcSsagc undoubtedly
more in cucci man normal rcuusixiai should be considered to have produced tho
cuuuKi m me tone 01 me siock mantel
for tho better that occurred yesterday
afternoon There had been a dull and
sagging market during the greater part of
the morning and immediately after the
message appeared there was an accession
of buying orders which advanced prices
fractionally all over the list and during
the remainder ot the afternoon this bet
terment although in no way remarkable
was persistent and unmistakable
The better market reflected the general
opinion of the message in Wall Street
Railway and financial men characterized
the document as conservative and yet op
timistic and progressive and the position
taken by the President on all questions
affecting financial commercial and rail
way matters seemed to meet with general
commendation
The ZehKllKc nn the TrnntH
Mr Roosevelt recognizes the immense
work that the trusts have done in build
ing up the prosperity of the country and
deprecajeg strongly any haphazard legis
lation to obstruct legitimate business
growth but advocates in unmistakable
tcrmslavte tW giVethe Government the
right to know what the great corpora
tions ire doing and to inform the public
when advisable
Wall Street Is not disposed to quarrel
with this Many of the most prominent
financial and business men have already
expressed themselves In favor of just
such laws requiring publicity of the
trusts Many cf the best of these con
cerns have already realized the rights ot
their stockholders to have such knowl
edge and are at the present time giving
It to them in regular periodical state
ments It is the general comment that
the message and the laws that It may
lead to will hurt no company that does
not deserve to be hurt
hnpervlHlon o Frelclit Itntex
The recommandatlon that supervision
of railway freight rates be given to the
Interstate Commerce Commission and that
the commission have the power to enforce
its supervision is not unfavorably received
by the railway Interests because it Is
coupled with a plain intimation that tho
railwavs should be allowed to form pool
ing arrangements under the direction of
the commission Such a compromise be
tween the railways and the commission
would tc acceptable to both parties it is
said
The expectation that Mr Roosevelt
would favor a subsidy for American ships
is fulfilled Wall Street interests almost
universally wanC a subsidy bill and arc
pleased that the messago openly advo
cates such a law
The llccliiroclty View Commended
Tho conservative commendation of a
reciprocity plan which shall not bow
ever hurt the effectiveness of the pro
tective principle and the recommendation
that the revenues of the Government be
c irtalled carefully so that a too bulky
surplus shall not be piled up in the
arc both In accord with the views
cf a majority of the financial men and
favorable opinions wero expressd yester
day afternoon regardlns the paragraphs
discussing these subjects
lluxicfal 3iifUct OnlnlcuiH
The street is hopeful that tho stock
market will continue to Improve It is
recognized of course that even though
the incs3agc is a bull argument there
may be other factors affecting the mar
ket that will outweigh Its effect Con
servative Wall Street people however
arc Inclined to the belief that this will
not prove to be the case
The Immediate financial situation Is not
entirely satisfactory but it will Improve
If the experts are correct In their views
At any rate the outlook Is excellent for
legislation in the line of the message that
will have a beneficial effect before tbe
winter is passed Call money rates were
not advanced yesterday s many had pre
dicted they would be It said that the
banks arc receiving Important remittances
of cash Irom the West and South this
week
The Amalgamated Copper business Is
still in evidence but the message leaves
room for the plain suggestion that the
general market should be allowed to suf
fer on account of the possibly rotten con
dition of any one concern
Railway earnings continue to lncreaso
and also the earnings of the Industrial
concerns that publish statements of their
business and after all has been bald this
Is the last and basic argument In favor of
a strong stock market Earnings make
dividends possible and constantly Increas
ing earnings make larger dividends a
thing to be expected
Orlober nnriilnRs MntemcntM
These October earnings reports made
yesterday were Important Two of them
made an excellent showing and the third
a poor showing that was not a surprise
The Increase In the net earnings of tho
Pennsylvania for the month of October
was J367C00 one of tho largest Increases
ever made The Increase In the surplus
after fixed charges of the Rock Island was
311011 The Burlington surplus after
fixed charges for the month showed a de
crease of r066l The Burlington Is not
earning enough to ray the Interest on the
new Issue of bonds floated when Its stock
was bought up by the Morgan combina
tion
Vo IliercnKc In Sucar Dividend
The regular dividend was declared by
the Sugar Trust directors There had been
some talk of a possible Increase but the

THE TIMES WASHINGTON ApygSDAY DECEMBER 4 1901
news that there is to bo no change in the
rate was not a surprise in conservative
quarters Sugar vas fairly strong during
the afternoon on the theory that the Pres
idents reciprocity Ideas will include a re
duction of the tariff on raw sugar from
Cuba No direct referenco to the Cuban
sugar question is made
Uccrcnsc In Conner IlxportM
Amalgamated Copper was erratic In tho
extreme getting at one time as low as 71
and a fraction a new bottom price and
at period of tho day as high as
74 It closed near the bottom however
and there seemed to be little support
from inside interests The announcement
yesterday morning that the Boston and
Montana Company one of the Amalga
mated concerns had cut Its dividend in
half perhaps had something to do with
the weakness of the stock Another mat
ter not favorable to the stock was tho
publication of the Bureau of Statistics
figures showing the exportation of cop
per lor November to have decreased 11
154031 poijids or J1S09000
Mnnlinttan Ill lo WM l
Manhattan was the strong feature of
the day with an advance In the last hour
to another new highest price on record
133 Nothing new regarding tho affairs
ot the company was heard and it Tas
supposed that the advance was due to
forced short covering
