Cpt*t. was battling for his life
j-esterday at his home. The Maples.
Greenwich. Conn., with a scant chance
af recovery, the grand Jury of this
eoeaty was Investigating his manage
ment of the company.
According to the State Superiadendent
af Issxranee. the Phenix was manage*
by Mr. Sheldon much as he saw fit with
out any interference from his fellow
officials, to say nothing of the non
retlvity of state officials whose duty It
was to examine into its affairs.
A long conference which District At
torney Jerome held on Monday with
William H. Hotchkiss, the State Super
intendent of Insurance, following th«
latter statement of the remarkable dis
closures made in the investigation of
the eonpary s affairs which was 6tarted

Ing to work immediately to probe for
eviderres cf criminality in the manage

Assistant District Attorney Nott was
placed la charge of the case, and during
the -.ay four men who are supposed to

Improper use of the resource* of the

BLOW TO P. S. BOARD
COURT OF APPEALS
CURBS ITS POWER.
Commission* Not Intended to
Replace Private Financial
_ Manager*.
[Br Telegraph to Th« Tribune.]
Albany. Dec. 7— The decision of the
Court of Appeals to-day in the Delaware
and Hudson Company. $7,000,000 appeal
came as a surprise. It limits to a large
extent the powers of the Public Service
Commissions in regulating capitalization.
However, the friends of the Public Ser
vice Commissions law point significant
ly to this paragraph In Judge Haighfs
decision
For a generation or more the public
has been frequently imposed upon, by the
issues of Ftocks and bonds of public
sfrvice corporations for improper pur
poses, without actual consideration
therefor by company officers, seeking to
enrich themselves at the expense of
Innocent and confiding Investors.
One of the legislative purposes in the
enactment of this statute was to correct
this, evil by enabling the commission to
prevent the issue of such stocks and
bonds, if upon an investigation of the
facts it is found that they were not for
the purpose of the corporation enumer
ated by the statute and reasonably re-
QUired therefor.
The court holds that the paramount
purpose of the Public Service law creat
ing the commission was the protection
and enforcement of the rights of the
public; that the commission must sim
ply see to it that the railroad corpora
tions maintain their equipment, tracks
and roadbed in good order and operate
their railroad with safety to the public
and give proper service, that they should
also prevent fraud on the public by the
manipulation of the stock market
through the overissue of stocks and
bonds.
The court holds that the Legislature
did not Intend to make the commission
the financial manager of corporations or
empower it to substitute Its judgment
and discretion for that of the directors
and stockholders of a corporation as to
the wisdom of a transaction; that a
statute that should make such substitu
tion would probably be unconstitutional.
fcr the ownership of property carries
with it the right of occupancy and man
agement, and a statute that would de
prive' an owner of that right would
undermine his right to protect and 'make
his property remunerative.
The upstate Public Service Commis
sion last December refused to authorize
an issue of bonds by the Delaware *
Hudson Company to pay off the indebt
edness Incurred by the purchase of the
securities of the Hudson \ Valley Com
pany and the coallands. The properties
in "Question were not • Included 'in - the
mortgage upon the Delaware & Hudson
property, under which It was proposed
to issue these bonds. The property was
acquired before the commission came In
to existence.
The Delaware & Hudson Company ap
pealed and the Appellate Division set
aside on eertiorar! the order of the com
mission which refused assent to the bond
issue. The Court of Appeals affirms tho
Appellate Division.
Chairman Stevens of the upstate com
mission, who argued the appeal In per
eon, said in his brief filed with the
Court of Appeals that if the commis
sion's ruling In this case was set aside
It would mean that the powers of the
commission "■will be bo limited in their
nature and so insignificant in character
as practically to nullify the obvious in
tent of the law and make the pretended
regulation of capitalization a farce."
It was suggested to-night that pos
sibly Governor Hughes in his message
la the Legislature would recommend
legislation to increase the powers of the
commission in regulating capitalization,
as it was pointed out that this was on*
of the main principles involved In the
Public Service Commission's law.
WILLCOX NOT DISTURBED
Public Service Chairman in This Dis
trict Does Not Think Decision Drastic.
William R. Wlllcox, chairman of the Pub
lic Service Commission for the Ist District,
did not appear to be at all surprised by the
decision of the Court of Appeals. He said.
however, that he was only lightly fa

FAVOR HUGHES IDEA
DEMOCRA TS DISCUSS
PRIMARY PL AX.
Some at League Dinner Also
4 - *
Approve of the Republican
P. S. Commission.
So much of the Democratic League as
John K. Sag Tie.. Mayor of Poughkeepsle.
can account for stands squarely in favor
of direct primaries and the Public Ser
vice Commission, even if they are proj
ects of a Republican Governor.
That was the way Mr. Sague put it
last r.:ght at the dinner given by two
hundred members of the Manhattan
Club for the executive committee of the
league that was born at the Saratoga
conference of Democrats last summer.
"I think H is a mistake to oppose the
Public Service Commission," said Mr.
Sague, and again, "there is no use in
opposing direct nominations simply be
cause a Republican Governor wants
them."
Governor Hughes, Mr Sague said.
though he didn't use his name, has made
people think they've got to have direct
primaries, and he told of a talk he had
recently with Assemblyman-elect Lewis
3. Chanlar.
"1 told him to vote for the direct pri
martes, and to get as many as he couM
to vote for them." said Mr. Sague. "and
if the Republicans throw them down, so
much the better; we can go before the
people then as the champions of that
reform."
EX-JUSTICE O'BRIEN. TOO.
Ex-Justice Morgan J. O'Brien, as
toastmaster. referred to the same topic
in his opening remarks. "In some state?.
he said, "direct nominations, the refer
endum and the initiative have made
headway, and we are face to face with
them In our own state. That ballot re
form Is necessary all must concede.**
Thomas M. Osborne. chairman of the
league executive committee, in the same
strain declared that he wanted no dick
ering with machine politicians.
Most of the speakers took liberal raps
at "Fingey" Conners. though the name
of the Democratic State chairman was
not mentioned during the evening.
Toastmaster O'Brien tried to set the
pace with a remark that the league's
aims could not be attained by casting
blame or reproach on others for past
defeats or poor leadership.
"Nor should we seek to make invidious
distinctions between those whom we
think bore the banner of the party aloft
in honor, or suffered it to trail disnonor
ably in defeat." he said.
"LEST. WE FORGET."
' But Mr. O^bome, was not uihwled to
follow "sucn^paciiiciines." He didn*t want
to rake up things of the past, he said,
but when there were still "elements of
power" in the saddle now, as a result of
s«mo of those things of the past, he had
a jrotest.
'Upstate w» haven't forgotten the
scandal in Buffalo three years ago." he
said, "and we cannot forget It so long
as some of those results are in power.
And we cannot forget the outrages in
Carnegie Hall a year ago."
A "rirvent ' and "efficient" Democratic
organization throughout the state would.
Mr. Osborne thought, turn the tide of
victory to the Democrats in 1910. and
that would te only the forerunner of a
Democratic victory in the nation in 1912.
The influence of the Saratoga confer
ence had been great, said Mr. Osborr.e,
and as a shining example he cited the
case of Buffalo, where he said a Demo
cratic Mayor was elected entirely on the
indorsement of the men Just retimed
from Saratoga.
"Everybody in Buffalo admits that."
he said with a laugh, "except possibLy
one man," whereat a brother in the rear
of the hall groaned mockingly. "Poor
old Ftngey!"
WANTS AFFIRMATIVE PARTY.
"We want an affirmative party, 1 ' said
Mr. Osborne. "we want an organization
headed by men I can support, and not
men of whom I am heartily ashamed."
He thought it would be a mistake,
however, for the league to have candi
dates. Its function, he said. . hould be
more to influence and supervise, and
though he asserted he knew what was
what in the Democratic party up the
state, he said it would be a wise man
who could tell much about the Demo
cratic party in the city of New York.
William Jennings Bryan was also
treated to some healthy blows, which al
most rivalled those given so freely to
Conners. Mr. Sague "as the medium.
and he said that men such as he found
in the new Democratic League and in
the Manhattan Club should do more
talking and exert their party influence
more.
Edward M. Shepard spoke about the
principles of the Jefferson Democracy
and the need that the present party
should return to them. He attacked tha
Republican party as creating class feel
ing and denounced the. corpornttoa: tax
ard commerce regulations as measures
■which take away from the states the
power to regulate their own affairs.
D. Cady Herrick said that men in
N'evi- York City didn't know what it
meant to be a Democrat upstate. "There
«r* no rewards to be gained. " he said,
"no business to be promoted, no honor
gained; the man who votes the Demo
cratic ticket does !t from principle
pur* and simple.
"This executive committee purposes
to submit to the league some measures
which will offer the sought for issues."
he continued "We want a reform of
the primary election laws, to be direct
primaries without limitation, and with
an enrolment in every district of the
state. We also want a reform of the
bailor so that each name will appear
on it once only, and each voter will be
required to indicate each individual can
didate of his eh

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on page 5. -
ROOT RELEASED IT.
Blunder Caused Premature
Publication of Treasury Report
Washington. Dec. 7.— Senator Root, of
New York, presiding in the Senate to
day in the temporary absence of Vice-
President Sherman, created, all un
known to him at the time, a sensation
among the newspaper men the effects of
which were even international. Copies of
the annual report of the Secretary of
the Treasury were in the hands of news
papers throughout this country and in
Europe, to be held in confidence for
publication to-morrow afternoon. The
report itself was still unsigned on the
desk of Secretary' MacVeagh. in the
Treasury Building.
By some means as yet unknown two
printed copies of the report found their
tv ay to the desk of the President of the
Senate. Mr. Root is a past master" in
the art of dispatching routine business
In the Senate, and he deftly handed me
Treasury report over the desk with the
routine announcement customary in such
cases. Instantly the keen eared report
ers on the Senate floor flashed to the
wires the news that the report had be
come a public document, and the "re
lease" clicked off to Chicago, to San
-!sco. to New York and t» 1
ft was nearly two hours before the
fact that a blunder had been made was
realized. Upon the Secretary's insist
ence an effort was made to recall the
release, but he soon came to appreciate
that the mischief was in fact irrepara
ble, and consented to waive the techni
cality, and the release was confirmed.
An amusing feature of the mix-up lies
in the fact that the report should not
have been handed down in the Senate at
i!!. since, in accordance with law, it Is
addressed on!'- to the Speaker of the
House.
COLER CASE AFFEST.
Dismissed Clerk in Brooklyn

clerk in the Bureau of Sewers in Brook
lyn until dismissed for falsifying the

TU'EXTY SETEX DEAD
Great Fire Follows Gas Tank
Explosion at Hamburg.
Hamburg. Dec. 7— The explosion of
two gas tanks on the so-called "K'-^ - •
Grasbrook." on the Elbe front, this af
tcrn>on was followed by an extensive
fire and the loss of many lives. The ex
plosion was due to a leak in a new
gasometer. - Escaping gas entered th©
retort house, where It came In contact
with the fires, causing a heavy ex
plosion. A large number of workmen
were engaged in rebuilding and enlarg
ing the plant. Twenty-five of th« men
were employed near the gasometer.
They disappeared in a mass of flames
which shot up to a great height.
Firemen appeared quickly on the
scene, but they were unable- to approach
In large force.
Up to a late hour to-night ten men are
reported dead and seventeen missing. It
is almost certain that all of these are
dead. Forty men were dangerously in
jured, of whom several cannot recover.
The new gasometer which exploded
was the largest In the world, having a
capacity of two hundred thousand cubic
metres. The city appropriated 14.000.

REPRESENTATIVES* VIEWS. .
Each element in the House had its de
cided opinion on th& President's mes
sage. The organization sentiments were*
expressed by the leaders, who pro- ;
nowaoed the message an able docu~i«ar.!
and cue that" displayed to great advan- '
tag* the deliberate character and Judi
cial temperament of its author. Taw:
Democrats for the moat part declared
i? Innocuous." The insurants pre
ferred not to be quoted, but were In
sistent it\_ their comparisons with tltos
days when a Presidents msasaa* meant
a series of thrills.
Speaker Cannon said it was a good
message, one that bespeaks the calm
ness and care with which Preside*!
Tilt intends" to approach great public
questions. The President has called at- •
t^ntion to the facV* added the Speaker.
"thai two of the most Important sub
jects for legislation will be treated m>
forthcorainsr messages. ' Those subject* .
which he did treat are fully covered and j
will undoubtedly command the serious.
attention of Congress." •
Representative Sereno E. Payne said:
It is a fine message. It outlines a por
tion of the legislative programme which
will not prove too difficult of fulfilment"
Representative Tawney said. "I re
gard the President's message as a very
able docment. True, It is .not complete.
but there is no necessity for includlM
all the Presidential recommendations in
one message. The portion dealing witt»
foreign affairs is especially strong. «I
am immensely pleased «M the entire
message."
Representatlre Boutell said: "Tnte»
tin— nil is mm af the most sane, cew
aerratlve and intelligent that ha» beesi
sent to Congress in years."
Representative Butler, of FennaylTa
nia. agreed with this, and added that It
was ai and would not alarm
business interests.
' A3 TO MONROE DOCTRINE.

Champ Clark, said: There are some ex

the country win be astonished to leant
that the Monroe Doctrine Is obsolete.
This Is the one thins the American peo
ple have agreed on. and they will recre*
the Present's statements. So far aa
Nicaragua is concerned, we ought to
treat her just as we would treat any of
the great powers. We should thoroughly
investigate all cases wherein mistreat
ment of our citizens is claimed, and If
upon investigation we conclude that they
have been mistreated, the guilty nation,
great or small, should be compelled to
make ample reparation.'*
Representative Fitzgerald said: *Th«
President's message is as consistent a*
its opening sentea/re. In view of the,
situation in Nicaragua it Is somewhat of
a strain *» believe that the relations at
the United States with foreign govern
