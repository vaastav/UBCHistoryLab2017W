PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Washington, December 4th. In
addressing my third annual message
to the law making branch of the gov
ernment, it is gratifying to be able to
state that during the past year suc
cess has generally attended the effort
to execute all laws found upon the
statute book. The policy lias been
r.t:t t inquire into the wisdom of laws
already enacted, but to learn their
spirit aud interest and to enforce them
accordingly. The past year has, un
der wise Proideuce, been one of gen
eral prosperity to the nation. It has,
however, been attended with more
than usual chastisements in loss of life
and property by storm and fire.
These disasters have served to call
forth the best elements of human na
ture in our country and develop a
friendship for us on the part of for
eign nations which goes far towards
alleviating the distresses occasioned
by these calamities, and the benevo
lent who have so generously shared
their means with the victims of these
misfortunes will reap their reward in
consciousness of having performed a
noble act, and in receiving the grate
ful thanks of men, women and chil
dren whose Buffering they have be
lieved. The relations of the United States
with foreign powers continue to be
friendly. The year lfas been an event
ful one, in witnessing two great na
tions, speaking one language, settling
by peaceful arbitration disputes of
long standing and liable at any time
to bring these nations into a bloody
and costly conflict. An example has
thus been set which if successful in its
final issue, may be followed by other
civilized nation and finally be the
means of returning to productive in
dustry. Millions of men are now
maintained to settle the disputes of
nations by the bayonet and the broad
side. I transmit herewith a copy of
the treaty alluded to, which has been
concluded since adjournment of con
gress with her Britannic majesty, and
a copy of protocols of the conference
of tlte commissioners by whom it was
negotiated. Tliis treaty provides a
method for adjusting the questions
pending between the two nations and
various questions are to be adjusted by
arbitration.
I recommend congress at an early
day to make the necessary provision
for the tribunal at Geneva, and for
the several commissions on the part of
the United States, called for by the
treat-. His Majesty the King of
Italy, the President of the Swiss con
federation and His Majesty the Em
peror of Brazil, have consented on the
joint request of the two powers, to
name on arbitrator for the tribunal at
Geneva. I have caused my thanks
to be suitably expressed for the readi
ness with which the joint request has
been complied with by the appoint
ment of gentlemen of eminence and
learning to these important positions.
His majesty the emp-eror of Germany
has been pleased to comply with a
joint request of the two governments
and has consented to act arbitrator of
the disputed water boundary between
the United States and Great Britain.
The contracting parties in the treaty
have undertaken to regard as between
themselves certain principles of pub
lic law for which the United States
have contended from the commence
ment of their history. They have al
so agreed to bring these principles to
the knowledge of other maritime pow
ers, and to invite them to accede to
them. Negotiations are going on as to
the form ami mode by which invita
tions is to be extended to other pow
ers. I recommend that the legislation
necessary on the part of the United
States to bring into operation articles
of treaty relating to the fisheries and
to other matters touching the relations
of the United States toward British
North American provinces to become
operative so soon as proper legislation
shall be bad ou the part of great
Britain and its possessions. It is
much to be desired that this legisla
tion may become operative before the
fisherman of the United States begin
to make their arrangements for. the
coming season. I have addressed a
communication, of which a copy is
transmitted herewith, to the governors
of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wis
consin, urging upon the governors of
these suites respectively the necessary
action on their part to carry into ef
fect the object of the article of the
treaty which contemplates the use of
canals on either side connected with
navigation of the lakes and rivers,
forming the boundary on terms of
equality by the inhabitants of both
countries- It is to ba hoped that the
importance of the object and the bene
fits to flow therefrom, will secure the
specdv approval and legislative sanc
tion of the states concerned. I renew
the recommendation for an appropria
tion for determining the true position
of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude,
where it forms the boundary between
the United States and the British
North American provinces between
the Lake of the Woods and the sum
mit of the Ilocky mountains. The
early action of congress on this re
common dation would put in the
power of the war department to place
a force in the field during next sum
mer. The resumption of diplomatic re
lations between France and Germany
has enabled me to give directions for
the withdrawal of protection extend
ed to Germans in France by the diplo
matic and consular representatives of
the United States in that country.
It is just to add that the delicate duty
of this protection has been performed
by the minister and the consul gener
ai of Faris, and the various consults
in France, under the supervisions of
the latter, with great kindness as well
with prudence and tact Their course
has received the commendation of the
Germau government, and has wound
ed no susceptibility of the French.
The government of the. Emperor of
Germany continues- to manifest a
friendly feeling toward the Uifited
States and a desire to harmonize with
the moderate and just policy which
this government maintains in its re
lations with the Asiatic powere, as
well as with the South American re
publics. I have given assurances that
the friendly feelings of that govern
ment are fully shared by the people
of the United States.
The ratification of the consular and
naturalization convention with the
Austro-IIungarian Empire has been
exchanged. I have been officially in
formed of the annexation of the
States of the Church to the Kingdom
of Italy, and the removal of the cap
tal of that kingdom to Home, and in
conformity with the established poli
cy of the United States I have recog
nized this change. The ratification
of the new treaty of commerce be
tween the Uuited "States aud Italy has
been exchanged.
The two powers have agreed on this
treaty that private property at sea
shall be respected during a war be
tween the two powers. The United
States have spared no opportunity of
incorporating this rule iuto the obli
gations of nations.
The forty-first congress at its third
session made an appropriation for an
organization of a mixed commission
for adjusting upon the claims of citi
izeus of the United States against
Spain, growing out of the insurrection
of Cuba. That commission has since
been organized. I transmit herewith
the correspondence relating to its for
mation and its jurisdiction. It is to be
hoped this commission will afford the
complaiuauts a complete remedy for
their injuries.
It has been made the agreeable du
ty of the United States to preside over
a conference at Washington between
the plenipotentiary of Spain aud the
allied South American republics,
which has resulted in an armistice,
with the reasonable assurance of a
permanent peace. The intimate
friendly relations which have so long
existed between the United States and
Itussia continue undisturbed. The
visit of the third sou of the emperor
is proof that there is no desire on the
part of his government to diminish
the cordiality of these relations. The
hospitable reception which has been
given to the grand duke is proof that
on our part we share the wishes of that
government.
The inexcusable course of the
Russian minister at Washington-, ren
dered it necessary to ask his recall,
and to decline to longer recievc that
functionary as a dipolomatic represen
tatives. It was impossible with self
respect or with a just regard to the
dignity of the country, to permit Mr.
Catacazy to continue to hold inter
course with this government after his
personal abuse of a government offi
cial, and during his pcrsisteut inter
ference, through various means, with
the relations between the United
States and other powers. In accord
ance with my wishes this government
has been relieved of further inter
course with Mr. Catacazy, and the
management of the imperial legation
has passed into the hands of a gen
tleman entirely unohjectioual. With
Japan we continue to maintain inti
mate relations. The cabinet of the
Mikado has, since the close of the last
session of congress, selected citizens
of the United States to serve in of
fices of importance in several depart
ments of the government. I have
reason to think that the selection is
due to an appreciation of the disin
terestedness of the policy which the
United States has pursued toward Ja
pan. It is our desire to continue this dis
interestedness and just policy with
China and Japan. The correspon
dence transmitted herewith shows
there is no disposition on the part of
this governmei t to swerve from its
established course. Prompted by a
desire to put an end to barbarous
treatment of our shipwrecked sailors
ou the Corean coast I instructed our
minister at Pekin to endeavor to con
clude a convention with Corea for se
curing the safety aud humane treat
ment of such mariners. Admiral
Kodgers was instructed to accompa
ny him with sufficient force to pro
tect him in case of need. A small
surveying party sent out, on reaching
the cost, was treacherously attacked
at a disadvantage ; ample opportuni
ty was given for explanation and
apology for the insult ; neither came ;
a force then landed after an arduous
march over a ragged and difficult
country. The foits from which the
outrages were committed were rsduc
ed by the gallant assault and were de
stroyed. Having thus punished crim
inals and having vindicated the hon
or of the flag the expedition returned,
finding it impossible under the cir
cumstances.4o conclude thei desired
convention. I respectfully refer to
the correspondence relating thereto
herewith submitted, aud leave the
subject for such action as congress
may see fit to take. The republic of
Mexico has not yet repealed the very
objectional laws establishing what is
known as the "Free Zoue" ou the
frontiers of the United States. It is
hoped that this may yet be done, and
also that more stringent measures
may be taken by that republic for re
straining lawless persons' on its fron
tiers. 1 hope that Mexico by its own
action will soon relieve this govern
ment of the difficulties experienced
from these causes. Our relations
with the various republics of Central
and South America continue, with one
exception, to be cordial and friendly.
I recommend some action by congress
regarding the overdue installments
under the award of the Venezulean
claims of 1866. The internal diosen-
sions of this government present no
justification for the absence of effort
to meet their solemn treaty obligations.
The ratification of an extradition trea
ty with Nicaragua has been exchang
ed. It is a subject for congratulation
that the great empire of Brazil has
taken the initiatory step towards the
abolition of slavery. Our relations
with that empire, always cordial, will
naturally be made more so by this
act. It is not too much to hope that
the government of Brazil may here
after find it for its interest as well as
intrinsically right, to advance to
ward entire emancipation more rap
idly than the present act contem
plates. The tme prosperity and greatness of
a nation is to be found in the eleva
tion and education of its laborers.
It is a subject for regret that the re
forms in this direction, which were
voluntarily promised by the states
men of Spain have not been carried
out in its West Indies colonies. The
laws and regulations for the apparent
abolition of slavery in Cuba and Por
to Rico leaves most of the laborers in
bondage, with no hope of release until
their lives become a burden to their
employers.
I desire to direct your attention to
the fact that the citizens of the Unit
ed States, or persons claiming to be
citizens of the United States arc large
holders in foreign lands of this species
of property forbidden by the funda
mental law of their alleged country.
I recommend to congress to provide
by stringent legislation a suitable
remedy against the holding, owning,
or dealing in slaves or being interest
ed in slave property in foreign lands,
either as owners, hirers, or mortgages
by citizens of the Uuited States. It
is to be regretted that the disturbed
condition of the island of Cuba con
tinue to be a source of annoyance and
anxiety.
The existence of a protracted strug
gle in such close proximity to our own
territory, without apparent prospect of
an early termination cannot be other
than an object of concern to a people
who, while abstaining from interfer
ence in the affairs of other powers,
naturally desire to see every country
in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace
liberty, and the blessings of free in
stitutions. Our naval commanders in
Cuban waters have been instructed, in
case it should become necessary, to
spare no effort to protect the lives and
property of bonx fide American citi
zens and to maintain the dignity of
the flag.
It is hoped that all pending questions
with Spaiu growing out of the affairs
in Cuba, may be adjusted in the spirit
of peace and conciliation which has
hitherto guided the two powers in
their treatment of such questions, to
give importance, and to add to the
efficiency of our diplomatic relations
with Japan and China, and to further
aid in retain the good opinion of those
people aud secure to the United States
its share of the commerce destined to
flow between those nations and the
balance of the commercial world. I
earnestly recommend that an appro
priation be made to support at least
four American youths in each of those
couutries, to serve as a part of the
official family of our ministers there.
Our representatives would not even
then be placed upon an equality with
the represeutat'wes of Great Britain
aud of some other powers. As now
situated our representatives in Japan
aud China have to depend for inter
preters and translators upou natives
of those countries who know our lan
guage imperfectly or procure for the
occasion the services of employees in
foreign business houses or the inter
preters to other foreign ministers.
I would also recommend liberal meas
ures for the purpose of posting the
American lines of steamers now ply
ing between San Francisco and Ja
pan aud China, aud the Australian
line, almost our only remaining lines
of ocean steamers, and of increasing
their services.
The national debt has been reduc
ed to the extent of $86,057,126,80
during the year, and by the negotia
tion of national bonds at a lower rate
of interest, the interest has been so
far diminished that now the sum to be
raised for the interest account is near
ly $17,000,000 less than on the 1st of
March, 1869. It was highly desira
ble that this rapid diminution should
take place both to strengthen the
credit oj' the country and to convince
its citizeus of their entire ability to
meet every dollar of liability without
bankrupting them. But in view of
the accomplishment of these desira
ble ends, of the rapid development of
the resources of the country, its in
creasing ability to meet large demands
and the amount already paid it is not
desirable that tho present resources of
the country should continue to be
taxed in order to continue this rapid
payment, and I therefore recommend
a modification of both the tariff and
internal tax laws, and recommend
that all taxes from internal source be
abolished except those collected from
spirituous, vinous and malt liquors,
tobacco in its various forms, and from
stamps. In readjusting the tariff I
suggest that a careful estimate be
made of the amount of surplus reve
nue collected under the present laws,
after providiug for the current expen
penses of the government, the interest
account and a sinking fund ; that this
surplus be reduced in such a manner
as to afford the greatest relief to the
greatest number. There are many
articles not produced at home, but
which enter largely into general con
sumption, through articles which are
manufactured at home, such as medi
cines, compounds, etc., from which
very little revenue is derived, but
which enter into general use. All
such articles I recommend to be plac
ed on the free list. Should a further
reduction prove advisable, I would
then recommend that it be made upon
those articles which did best bear it
without disturbing home production
or reducing the wages of American
labor. I have not euterxd into fig
ures, because to do so would be to re
peat what will be laid before you in
the report of the secretary of the
treasury. The present laws for col
lecting the revenue, pay collectors of
customs small salaries, Ljt provide
for moieties, shares in all seizurse,
which, at principal porta of entry par
ticularly, raise the compensation of
those officials to a large sum. It has
always seemed to me as if this sys
tem must, at times, work perniciously;
it holds out an inducement to dishon
est men, should such get possession of
those officers, to be tax in their scruti
ny of goods entered, to enable them
finally to make large seizures. Your
attention is respectfully invited to this
subject. Continued fluctuation in the
value of gold us compared with the
national currency has most damaging
effect upon the increase and develop
ment of the country in keeping up
prices of all articles necessary in eve
ry day life. It fosters a spirit of
gambling prejudical alike to national
morals and the national finances.
If the question can be met as to how
to give a fixed value to our currency,
that value, constantly and uniformly
approaching par with specie, a very
desirable object will be gained.
For the operations of the army in
the past year, the expenses of main
taining it, the estimates for the ensu
ing year, and for continuing sea cost
and other improvements conducted
under the supervision of the war
department, I refer you to the ac
companying report of the secretary of
war.
1 call your attention to the pro
visions of the act of congress, approv
ed March 3rd, 1S69, which discon
tinues promotions in the staff corps
of the army until provided for by
law.
I recommend that the number of of
ficers in each grade in the staff corps
be fixed, and that whenever the unni
ber in any one grade falls below the
dumber so fixed, that the vacancy may
be filled by promotion from the grade
below. I also recommend that when
the office of chief of a corps becomes
vacant, the place may be tilled by se
lection from the corps in which the
vacancy exists. The report of the soc
rettry of the navy shows an improve
ment in the number and efficiency of
the naval force without material in
crease in the expense of supporting it.
This is due to the policy which lias
been adopted and is being extended
as fast as our material will admit of
using smaller vessels as cruisers en the
several stations. By this measure we
have been enabled to occupy at once
a larger extent of cruising ground, to
visit more frequently to posts where
the presence of our flag is desirable,
and generally to discharge more ef
ficiently the appropriate duties of the
navy in time of peace, without ex
ceeding the number of men or theex
endiiure authorized by law. Dur
ing the post year the navy has, in ad
dition to iti regular services, supplied
the men aud officers for the vessels of
the coast survey, and has completed
the surveys authorized by congress of
the Isthmusof Daricn and Tehuante
pec, and under like authority has sent
out an expedition completely furnish
ed and cquippod, to explore the un
known ocean of the north. The sug
gestions of the report as to the neces
ity for increasing ami improving the
material of the navy, and the plan
recommended for reducing the person
nel of the peace standard by the grad
ual abolition of certain grades of of
ficers, the reduction of others, and the
employment of some in the service of
the commercial 'marine, are well con
sidered, and deserve the thoughtful at
tention of congress. I also recom
mend that all promotions in the navy,
above the rank of captain, be by se
lection instead of by seniority.
This course will secure it in the
higher grades, greater efficiency and
hold out nn incentive to young offi
cers to improve themselves in the
knowledge of their profession. The
present cost of maintaining the navy,
its cost compared with that of the
proceeding year and the estimate for
the ensuing year, are contained in the
accompanying report of the secretary
of the navy.
The enlarged receipts of the post
office department, as shown by accom
panying report of the postmaster gen
eral, exhibits a gratifying increase in
the branch of the pubic service. It
is the index of the growth of educa
tion and of the prosperity of the peo
ple; two elements highly conductive
to the vigor and stability of republics.
With a vast territory like ours, much
of sparsely populated, but'all requiring
the service of the mail.Jit is not at pres
ent to be expected that this" depart
ment can bd made self-sustaining, but
a gradual approach to this end from
year to year is confidently relied on.
The day is not far distant when the
post office department of the govern
ment will prove a much greater bless
ing to the whole people than it is now.
The suggestions of the postmaster gen
eral for improvements in the depart
ment presided over by him, are earn
estly recommended to your special at
tention. Especially do I recommend
favorable consideration of the plan
for uniting the telegraph system of
the United States with the postal sys
tem. It is believed that by such a
course the cost of telegraphing could
be much reduced, and the servece as
well if not better rendered. It would
secure the further advantage of ex
tending the telegraph through portions
of the country where private enter
prise will not construct it
Commerce trade, above all the ef
forts to bring a people widely separa
ted into a community of interest ,are
always benefitted by rapid intercom
munication. Education, the ground
work of republican institutions, is en
couraged by increasing the faculties
togethei, speedy news from all parts
of the country, and the desire to reap
the benefit of such improvmetitse will
stimulate education. I refer you to
the report of the postmaster general
for full details of the operation of last
year and for comparative statements
of results with former years. There
has been imposed upon the executive
branch of the government the execu
tion of the act of congress, approved
April 20 1871, and commonly known
as the ku klux law, in a portion of
the state of South Carolina. The
necessity of the course pursued will
be demonstrated by the report of tho
committee to investigate southern out
tragej. Under the provisions of the
above act I issued a proclamation
calling the attention of the people of
the United States to the same, declar
ing my reluctance to exorcise any of
the extraordinary powers thereby con
ferred upon me, except in case of
imperative necesity but making
known my purpose to exercise such
powers whenever it should become
necessary to do so, for the purpose of
securing to all citizens of the Uuited
States the peaceful enjoyment of the
rights guaranteed to them by the con
stitution and the laws. After the pass
age of this law information was re
ceived from time to time that combi
nations of the character referrered to
in this law existed and were powerful
in many parts of the southern states,
particularly in certain counties of the
state of South Carolina. Careful in
vestigation was made, and it was as
certained that in nine counties of that
state such combinations were active
and powerful, embracing a sufficient
portion of the citizens to control the
local authority and having, among
other things, the object of depriving
the emancipated class of the substan
tial benefits of preventing freedom,
and of the free political action of
those citizeus who did not sympathize
with their own views. Among their
operations were frequent seourgiugs
and the occasional assassinations, gen
erally perpetrated at night by dis
guised jiersons, the victims in' almost
all cases being citizens of different po
litical sentiments from their own or
freed persons who had shown a dispo
sition to claim equal right with other
citizens.
Thousands of inoffensive and well
disposod citizens were the sufferers by
this lawless violence. Therefore on
the 12th of October, 1871, a procla
mation was issued in terms of the law,
calling upon the members of those
combinations to disperse within five
days and to deliver to the marshal or
military officers of the United States
all arms, ammunition, uniforms, dis
guises, and other means or imple
ments used by them for carrying out
their unlawful purposes. This warn
ing not- having been heeded, on the
13th of October another proclama
tion was issued suspending the priv
ilige of the writ of hebeas corpus in
nine counties in, that state. Direc
tions were given that within the coun
ties so designated persons supposed
upon creditable information to be
members of such unlawful combina
tions should be arrested by the mili
tary forces of the United States and
delivered to the marshal to be dealt
with according to law, In two of
said counties, York and Spartanburg,
many arrests have been made. At
the last account the number of persons
thus arrested was one hundred ami
sixty-eigth. Several hundred, whose
criminality was ascertained to be of
an inferior degree, were released for
the present These have generally
made confession of their guilt. Great
caution hits been exercised in making
these arrests, and, notwithstanding
the large number, it is believed that
no innocent person is now in custody.
The prisoners will be held for regular
trial in the judicial tribunals of the
United States. As soon as it appear
ed that the authorities of the Uuited
Statos were about to take vigorous
measurers to enforcethc law, many per
sons absconded, and there is 'good
ground for supposing that all such
persons have violated the law. A full
report of what has been done under
this law will besuhmmitted to congress
by the attorney general. In Utah
there still remains a remnant of bar
barism repungnant to civilization, to
decency and to the lawsof the Uuited
States. Territorial officers, however,
have been found who are willing to
perform there duty in a spirit of equity
and with a duo sense of sustaining
the majesty of the law.
Neither polygamy nor any other
violation of existing statues will Lb
permitted within the territory of the
United States. It is not with the re
ligion of the self styled saints that we
are now dealing, but with their prac
tices. They w ill be protected in the
worship of God according to the die-'
tates of their conscience, but they will
not be permitted to violate the laws
under the cloak of religon. It may be
advisable for congress to consider
what, in tho execution of the laws
against polygamy, is to be the status
of plural wives and their offspring.
The propriety of congress passing an
enabling act, authorizing the tcrrito
al legislature of Utah to legitimize
all children born prior to a time fixed
in the act, might be justified by its
humanity to these innocent children.
This is a suggestion only, and not a
recommendation.
The policy pursued towards the
Indians has resulted favorable,
so far as can be judged from the
limited time during which it has
been in operation. Through the exer
tions of the various societies of Chris
tians to whom has been intrusted the
execution of the policy, and the board
of commissioners authorized by the
law of April 17, 1869, many tribes of
Indians have been induced to settle
upon reservation, to cultivate the soil,
to perform productive labor of vari
ous kinds, and to partially accept civ
ilization. They are being cared for
in such away, it is hoped, as to induce,
those still pursuing their old habitaof
life to embrace the only opportunity
which is left them to avoid extermina
tion. I recommend liberal appropria
tions to carry out the Idian peace '
policy, not only because it is humane,
Christian-Mke and economical bat be-"
cause it is right' I recommend to
your honorable consideration also the
policy of granting a territorial gov
ernment to the Indians in the Indian
territory, west of the Arkansas" , and
Missouri, and south Kanses. In doing,
do every right guaranteed to the In
dians by treaty should be secured,
such course might in time be that
means of collecting most of the In
dians now between the Missouri and!
the Pacific, and south of the British'
possessions, into one territorry or in
a state. The secretary of the interio'
has treated upon t his subject at length
and I recommend to you his sugges
tion. I renew my recommendations that
the public lands be regarded as a her
itage to our children, to be disposer? of
only as required f r occupancy and tff
actual settlers. Those already grant
ed have been in great part disposed of
in such a way as to secure access to
the balance by the hardy settler who
may wish to avail himself of them,
but caution should be exercised in at-
tabling so desirable an object
Educational interest may well be
served by the grant of the proceeds of
the sale of public lauds to settlers.
I do not wish to be misunderstood as
recommending, in the least degree, a
curtailment of what is being done b
the general government for the en
couragement of education. The re
port of the secretary of the interior
submitted with this, will give you all
the informatiou collected and prepar
ed for publication in regard to the
ceusus taken during the year 1S70.
The operations cf the bureau of edu
cation for the year ; the patent office ;
the pension office ; the land office, and
Indiau bureau. Tim report of the
commissioners of agriculture gives the
operations of his department, for the
.year. As agriculture is the ground-'
work of our prosjierity, too much im
portance cannot be attached to the
labors of this department It is in
the hands of an able head, with able
assistants, as zealously devoted to in
troducing into the agricultural pro-'
ductions of the nation all Useful pro-'
ducts adapted to any of the various
climates and soils of our vast territory,
and to giving all useful information
as to the method of cultivation of the
plants, serials and other products
adapted to particular localities. Qui
etly, but surely the agricultural bu
reau is working a great national good,
and if liberally supported, the more
widely its influence will be extended,
and the less dependent we shall be ti
on the products of foreign countries.
The subject of comjd-nsation to the
heads of bureaus and officials holding
positions of responsibility and requir
ing ability and ehaiscter to fill prop
erly is one to which your attention is
invited. But few of the officials re
ceive a compensation equal to the rc-sK-ctab!e
support of a family, while
their duties are such as to involve mil
lions of interest in private. Life ser
vice demails compensation equal tot
the service rendered. A wise economy
would dictate the same rule in tho
government service. I have not given
the estimates for the support of gov
ernment for the ensuing year,- nor tbe
the comparative statement between
the expenditures for the year just pass
ed and the one just preceding, because
all these figures are contained in the
accompanying reports or in those pre
sented directly to congress.
More than six years having elapsed
since th; hurt hostile gun was tired be
tween the armies then arrayed against
each other one for the perpetuation,
the other for the destruction of the
union it may well be considered
whether it is not now time that the
disabilities imposed by the fourteenth
amendment should be removed. That
amendment lo:s not exclude the bal
lot, but only imposes the disability to
hold office upon certain classes.
When the purity of the ballot is se
cure majorities are strre to elect offi
cers reflecting the views of the ma
jority. I do not see tire advantage or
propriety of excluding men from
office merely because they were before
the rebellion of standing and charac
ter sii.ficient to lm elected to- positions
requiring them to take oath to sup
port the constitution and :?initting to
eligibility those ci?tri'tainiog precisely
the same views but of less stanciug!in
their communities. It may be said
that the former violated an oath,
while the latter did not Tho latter
did not have it in their p wer to dc)
so. If they bad taken this oath it
cannot be doubted they would have
broken it as did the former class.
If there areany great criminals dis
tinguished for the part they took in
oppositon to the government, they
might, in the judgment of congress, be
excluded from such an amnesty. This
subject is submitted for your careful
consideration. The condition of the
southern states is, unhappily, not such
as all true patriotic citizens would like
to see. Social ostracism for opinion's
sake, personal violence or threats to
ward persons entertaining political
views opposed to those entertained by
the majority of the old citizens pre
vents immigration and the How of
much needed capital into the States
lately in rebellion. It will be a hap
py condition of the country when the
old'eitizens of these States will take
an interest in .public affairs, promul
gate ideas honestly entertained, vote
for men representing their views and
tolerate the same fredoro of expression
and ballot in those entertaining differ
ent political convictions.
Under the provision of the act of
congress approved February 21, 1871,
