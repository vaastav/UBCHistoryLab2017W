to know thnt would ba not onlv a great event,

calamity of the age. lite' Controferay on the
aulgeot of alavery haa now reached a point,
when Ha honorable aad rightfnl a^Juatment,
onaal|ted to by the ^epple of both aactlona,
aeema indiapenaabie to tW coodouanoe of the
tiovernment in ita present form. The election
of Liuco|' fraaleped the critical day hia defeat
could only peatpone }(. doat intend to aay
that one section waa more to blame than the
other whether both were equally at faaU, or
whether tb» blame waa whofly on one aide.—
Oruutnationa and recrimination* are no# naelew,
nay da geroua. If poasible, the flrat thing done
stiould be to restore the fraternal spirit which
once existed. How shall this be done? By
cheerfully and honestly assuring to every section
ita just constitutional rights. Ho aectfen ought
to ask more—none ought to suffer luaa. Aa to
what are thoea constitutional rights, that ia a
sokjeQf (o fcjf,considered in a spirit of confidence,
mutual good will, "and devotion to the {Jtnion,
for tha preservation of which my constituents
are ready to make anv sacrifice that a reasona
ble pan asks or an honorable man can grant,
cooaiatontly with principle. In thia apirit Iaball
i meet thia great question, and In doing ao shall
I be auatainad by a a iijjmense majority of my 6on
stituenta. If time Aall ahow 'I am wrong in
this belief, I shall luatantly cease to represent
them here. The people, under God, must save
this nation, if it ia to be saved the poHticnna
i cannot do it. What I may be willing to do, or
the Senate be willing to do will avail nothing
unSa^ suatained by tne intelligence and confi
dence of the people. There ia a class df men
North, nerhapa South, small in numi^er and influ
ence, who aaanme that the preaent coAteat is a
conflict of two oirilisatton^, freedom or slavery
muat perish. The great body of those I repre
sent do not thus believe. We believe there is
no conflict of systems of labor In different
States Incompatible with the peaceful existence
of our Union. We believe the slave-holding nnd
non slave-holding States may still revolve In
harmonious spheres that if the question of sla
very deKftsy-i the Union, it will be because the
statesmen of the d*y are incompetent to. the
task.
After further debate by Messrs. Broirn, £ugh,
Hale, and othera, the Senate adjourned.
Hocat.—Mr. Hawkins gave addit:unal reasons
why he hxd asked to be excused from serving on
the Union Select Committee. Florida is a small
State, bat nevertheless is entitled to all the rights
and immunities of the other States. She cannot
be forced to remain in the Union and the South
era States are pledged to defend her in the event
of attempted eoercion. He was aatisfied of the
unanimity pervading that State to aeek redress
of ita grieyai)oes4n its own way and means of
other than Congressional compromises, which
latter have never accomplished a successful pur
pose. He regarded the component parts of the
Committee as peculiarly unfortunate. He critl
cised the composition of the Committee, espe
cially objecting to Mr. Davis, of Maryland, as
not a fit representative of that State, arguing
that all who voted for Pennington as Speakci
were disloyal to the rights of the South. He
legretted that the resolution for the appointment
of the Committee came from ope of the most
gifted sons of the South
He gave fair warning that Mississippi, Alaba
ma, Florida,' Georgia and South Carolina were
certain to secedeaud to be followed by Arkansas,
Louisiana and Texas.
Mr. Vallandingham argued in favor of ex
cusing Mr. Hawkins for the reason that the Conv
iuiitee was raised with a view to pcace. We
should not use coercion to make members serve.
He adverted to the composition of the com
mittee in condemnation, saving, there was no
Democratic committee man from the great North
West, which has such deep interest in the sub
ject, and which dea not intend to be depend
ent province, either of the East or Soutb. If
the people of that section could not otherwise
get to tlie sea they would pieaye their way with
the sword.

Mr. Sherman, from the Committee on Waya

Houax.—Mr. Cobb, of Alabama, did not risa
to make a speech, but to express an anxious de
sire that the Select Committee should commence
their business and present their de'iberations in
soma tangible form. Hia hape,however,wea faint
ae to any useful result. It Anything waa to be
done to save his State, It mast be done st once.
The election of delegates to the Statu Conven
tion takes place on (lie 27th inst., and the Con
vention meets on tt« 7th of January. What
meanatheae crowded"" gal eries? riis answer
was: The excitement which -pervades the pub
lic mind, not only here, but throughout tbe en
tire country—ill are looking to Congress to do
something." He hoped the House would stop
this debute, and do something, if possible, to
produce harmony among the people. There was
a pure beam of light From Boeton, which may
ultimately have a good «ffhct on the public mind.
Let the North ahow a returning aense of justice,
nd leave the question which now agitates the
country in thet!bands Of the people for proper
adjustment. He trusted that the Committee
would do lomethiug to harmonise tha distracted
public.
Mr. Leake. Alabama would not remain In
tbe Confederacy longer than tbe 1Mb of Janu
ary, unless something was speedily dost. He
was not a secessionist. He desired pence, pred
ion ted on the principles of tbe Constitution. If
you can give us that, you can help uato remain
in the Union aa ltag as the sun shall shine, and
my prayer shall be sent forth for tbe perpetidty
of this Government
Mr. Davis, of Miss., briefly gave the reason
why he should serve on the committee he might
be blamed or cenaarad, but ia acting where hia
eonacience approved, he deled the opinion of
the world. Be stood hew not as the represen

Mr. Curtia, wished to aay, hia party had not
refhaed to diacuss he would do so at the pro
per tiflto. He wanted the Committee, on which
he waa a member, to hare a fair bearing.
Mr. Smith, resuming, aaid he expected the op
portunity would hare been presented of exhib
iting the different views Of members, aa a meaa
are of influence, and acting on the Committee,
he wasanxfeuetoere every State participate In
the deliberationa of the Committee, and hence,
he could not excuse Mr. Hawkins, because if this
Were done, Florida would be unrepresented.
Mr, Burnett, explaining, said this Government
ia not to be saved by mere eulogies on the
Union, but by apeedy action.
Mr. Smith reaumed. Xobody expected to eee
force used to compel Mr. H. to serve, or desired
to visit him with punishment other than that of
mere opinien. The Senate is resolved not to
serve on the committee. Let him refuse, hu» not
make a request to be excuaed, with a private de
termination not to perform his duty should the
House refuse to excuse Mr. Bryce v a tie vote.
Mr. Smith, of Vn., having been informed that
Mr Hawkins aupposcd he had made some isiuua
tions to hia prejudice^ disclaimed any aucb inten
tion and spoke of the uprightness and integrity
of the gentleman from Florida.
Mr. Qawkini wa« understood to fee satisfied
with tbe explanation.
Mr. Morrill asked to be excused from serving
on the Committee because of other duties which
fully employed his time.
Sxjiats.—The
House bill to provide for the
payment of outside Tressury Notes and author
ise a loan, Ac., was takeii up, after some re
marka from Mr. Rice against and Mr. Oowdoron
in favor. On motion of Mr. Bice it waa refer
red to the Committee on Finance.
Tbe resolution in relation to tbe portion of the
President's Mesasge in reference to secession was
takeii up.
Mr. Hale ofliired a resolution that the Commit
tee on Military affairs be instructed to inquire
whether the eipenses of that branch of the pub
lic service cannot be reduced without detriment
to the safety, and that, If they c*n,gtbey be fur
xtyir Instructed to -report to what extent and
what particular branch or branches can be dis
pensed with or reduced. Tbe resolution waa
aopted.
Mr. Bigler then took the floor, having yielded
it yesterday4pHe said he would go with tbe Sen
ator from Illinois with men of every party who
will devote themselves to tbe great work of res
cuing the country from impending danger. Mr.
President, for weal or woe, I am a Union man.—
I am for Ae {Jnipn a| r,ia^e by our fathers. I
am for tbe Constitution and ibe Union.. Mr.
Bigler concluded th»t in Pennsylvania and Kew
York there waa more votes than in all tbe States
threatening accession. The Republican party
haa gained ita last victory. Let us remain to
gether.
Mr. I verson said the South does not fear the
operation of personal liberty bills, fugitive slave
laws, &c. if they were all repealed, we fear the

wtth the same on oar farma, we desire to add oar trstlMimj
to that of others who have recommended it as dsstinedto
become of the greatest poasible benefit to the Jhnnfegln
terests of this State and of the West generally. The result
of the experiments we have made, aad the beaeflt we hare
derived from the uar of tpe Machine, are beyond our mral
sanguine expectations, and so fcr as we have been able to
learn, the srtne has been the case in other localfttea. It
^aseaabled osto racialra, at an inatgniacaat cost, larga
portions of our twins which had previously been totally tn
tillable and worse than useless, and render thaauae
productive, tf not more ao, than that which we had before
eonsldereo our best land.
The drains made by tids Machine are large enough for
all practicable purposes, far enough below tha surface la
be beyond tbe reach of frost and permit the ground abova
them to be cultivated witboat the slightest danger or ia.
Jury to the drains. We are convinced that they are
permanent and durable, gome of the drains In this Coon
ty were made with this machine more than two years ago
and ail of them remaia In as perfect a -ondttinn as they
were when they were first made, in Illinois and slaewbste
they have been in use a much longer time wttb tba aaa
result.
Another very great advantage to be derived from this
mode of draining, and one which every Tanner will re
nlae as of tl e highest knportance, ia the cuaaUait ao
of pure stock wator which these drains furnish at tbeir
lets, Summer and Winter. This alone, in most localities.
If not in all, ia worth Infinitely ante than tha oostaf
drainage.
We therefore most cordially recommend tie above
named Machine to the farmers of this County and of tba
•tale, with entire confidence that wherever tried It wS
perform all that ita owners ciahn for it, aad rsaalt b» ne)t
aoanent and lasting benefits to all concerned.
