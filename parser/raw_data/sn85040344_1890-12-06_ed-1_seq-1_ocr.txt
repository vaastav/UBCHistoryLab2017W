know that these did hot grow in any degree out

securities held in that market. The return of
our bond- and stocks was caused by a money
stringency in England, not by any loss of value

STRONG STAND FOR PROTECTION,
The President Points tint Henefits Certain
to Result from the >evv Hill.
The genera! tariff act has only partially gone
into operation, some of it- important provi
sions being limited to take effect at dates yet in
the future. The general provisions of the law
have been in force less than -ixty days. Its
permanent effects upon trade and prices still
largely stand in conjecture. It is curious to
note that 'he advance in the price*- of article
w holly unaffected by the tariff act was by many
hastily* a-cribed to that act. Notice was not
ta ken'of the fact that the general tendency of
the markets wa- upward from influences whol
ly apart from the recent tariff legislation. The
enlargement of our currency by the silver bill
undoubtedly gave ah upward tendency to trade
and had a marked effect on prices; but this
natural and de-lred effect of the-liver legisla
tion was by many erroneoU-ly attributed to the
tariff act.
There i- neither wisdom nor justice in the
suggestion that the subject of tariff revision
shall be open.*l before this law ha- had lair
trial. It is unite true that every tariff schedule
is subject to objections. No bill was ever
frame*). 1 suppose, that in all of it- rates and
cliis.-ili* aliens had the full approval even ot a
party caucus. Such legislation i- always and
necessarily the product of > mproinise a- to de
tail.-. and the present law i- no exception. Hut
in it- gen* nil scope and effect. 1 think, ii will
justify the -upport of those who believe that
American legislation should conserve and de
fend American trade ami thewagesof American
vvoi k men.
i he misinformation as to the terms of the net
which ha- been so widely disseminated at borne
and abroad, will be corrected by experience,
and the evil auguries us to its ’ re-tilts con
founded by the market reports, the savings
banks, international trade balances, and
the general prosperity of our peo
ple Already wo begin to hear from
abroad ami from our eit-tom-honses that the
prohibitory effect upon importations imputed
to the act is not justified. The imports at the
port of New York for the first three weeks of
November were nearly k per cent, greater than
for the same period in land 2o per cent,
greater than in the same period of IS-s. And. so
fur from being an act to limit export-, I confi
dently believe that under it we shall secure a
larger ami more profitable participation in for
vigil (fade than we have ever enjoyed, and that
we shall recover a proj ortiouatc (anticipation
in me ocean carrying trade of the world.
Ihe criticisms of the bill that nave *■olllo to
us irv m foreign sources may well tie rejected lor
repugnancy. If these critics really believe that
the adoption by us of a free trade policy, or of
tariff rate-having reference solely to revenue,
would diminish the participation of vheir own
countries in the commerce of the world, th* ir
advocacy and promotion by speech and other
forms of organized effort of this movement
among our people is a rare exhibition of iiuseit
isliness in trade. And on the other hand if
Ihev sincerely believe that the adoption of a
protective tariff policy by thi- country inures
lo their profit and our hurt, il i- noticeably
strange 1 hat they should lead the out* ry against
the authors of a policy so helpful lo their coun
trymen, amt crown with their fav or those who
would -natch from them a sub lamial share ot
a trade with other land-already Inadequate to

1 desire to repeat with added urgency the- rec
ommendations contained in my last annual
message in lelntiou to the development of
American steamship line*-. !he reciprocity
clause of the tariff till will lie largely limited,
and its benefits retarded and <1 ininished. if
provision is not contemporaneously made to en
courage the establishment of tirst-ela-s steam
communication between our pons andthe ports
of such nations as may meet onr overtures lor
enlarged commercial exchanges. The steam
ship, carrying the mails statedly and frequent
ly, and ottering to passengers n comfortable,
safe and speedy transit, is the first condition of
foreign trade. It earrit- the order or the buyer,
but not all that is ordered or bought, it gives
to the sailing vessel such cargoes us are not ur
gent or perishable, and, indirectly 111 h ast, pro
motes that important adjunct of commerce.
There is now both in this country hi and in the t u
tions of Central and South America a stale oi
expectation and confidence a.s to increased
trade that will give a douhfi v ainc to prompt ac
