GOODLAND'S GREAT WELCOME.
If the various and numerous re
marks of satisfaction and delight. ex
Dressed by the teachers who attend
ed the annual convention in our city
last week for the royal way In which
Goodland entertained her guests,
should be reduced to one little sen-
tpnr. It would be: "Welcome ever
smiles."
That genial cordiality extended by
the people of the town to the visitors
was like the welcoming, not of strang
ers, but of old friends. Cool for
mality and "distance" are unknown
out here In this great, democratic
west: and the stranger within the
gates was made to feel thoroughly at
home. From the time the teachers
stepped from the trains that brought
them, to the time they re-embarked
for home, they were the recipients of
courteous attention from our city's
young men and women. Many pleas
ing acquaintances were formed, idea.
exchanged, and good received. So
that, in the memory of the 400 teach
ers who came from near and far
Goodland's welcome ever smiles.
The big heartedness of this western
town to all conventions of people from
neighboring counties 13 rapidly b
coming proverbial. Not only that; th
Importance of this growing, western
citv. Increases more and more as
knowledge of her proportions and
business activity is spread about.
Many teachers were very agreeably
surprised to find Goodland a place
far beyond expectations It Impr-s
ed them as an audacious nttempt at
the marking out of an important cen
ter, with much hope of the realiza
tion. It 13 really not an attempt, but
the "natural growth" out of man's in
dustry and Nature's beneficence in the
fertility of the region and the favor
able rolling of the seasons.
The mingling with educated peo
ple from other par's of the state nur
tures education here. It was a good
diffused, and Its result, we hope, will
be lasting at home and promotive of
those higher 'nterests in pducation
throughout the territory of the asso
ciation.
o
DEMOCRATS DOXT VOTE.
Charles A. Edwards, secretary of
the democratic congressional commit
tee at Washington, in discussing the
result of the last electio::. says that
the very thing that Kijps the demo
cratlc party out of poarjr is the Indif
ference of democrats to ilw t'i.t of
voting on election day.
"The lesson of this election should
come home to the people with added
force and effect," he says, "simply be
cause they did not exert their prero
gatives as a voter, and a killer, there
fore, of vicious practices and poTivi
cal evils. The democracy has lost the
house by between forty and fifty, in
the Sixtieth congress. It should have
won. As I said some time ago, 116
majority republican In the house of
representatives was an herculean
task to overcome. It could have been
overcome if the democrats of the
United States, who really are demo
crats, who believe In democratic prin
clples, had come out and voted their
honest convictions, because there were
enough men defeated democratic
candidates by less than 200 majority
to have won the house.
"The trouble with the democratic
party in this country Is that they do
not go to the polls and vote. The rea
son they do not vote 13 because they
are satisfied. Satisfaction meana con
tentment, and contentment means in
difference to the political ills that dis
turb this country, and make it a c oun-
try of, for and by the trusts, and not
the people. It seems to me, after ten
years of service in Washington as a
newspaper correspondent, and s'x
years service as secretary of the demo
cratic congressional committee, there
is nothing which will overcome the re
publican majority In the house or the
republican majority in the nation
from a presidential standpoint, ex
cept absolute poverty, and a pinch
ing in the belly which will make men
think of the cruel wrongs being
wrought by the trusts and combina
tions, absorbing the money of the
masses."
-o
"WELL DONE, LITTLE JOE."
Crammed Into thi3 short screed
there is story, sermon, editorial, and
lecture, all In one. It would repay
any man or woman to read it.
"Once on a time a lad employed in
a home of wealth and culture, much
to everybody's surprise, gave up hi3
job of running errands and scouring
the brasses and departed. A friend
asked him why he had acted thus:
'Weren't you well fed?' 'Yes.' 'Weren't
you well paid?' 'Yes.' Weren't you
well treated?' 'Yes.' "What was the
matter, then?' "Well, I'll tell you.
They treated me well enough and it's
likely that at the next place I won't
get as much money or as comfortable
a bed. But I just wanted them to
say, once In a while, Well done, little
Joe.' "
"Little Joe spoke of a great many
people besides himself. After one has
done his best over and over again and
- studied to please in every particular,
he is hardly human if he does not
crave a bit of appreciation. Not that
the right-minded person cares for Cat
tery, lie abhors that and suspects the
one who brngs it of some ulterior de
signs. But appreciation is an alto
gether diSerent article from fawning
praise. It i3 the just and accurate
estimate cf work, done and service
rendered.

It amounted to several hundred dol
lars annually and when I remarked.
She must have been very grateful to
you,' my inena repnea wun a cynicai
little shrug. She never thanked me.
"Let there be more appreclativeness
n the home. You 11 get quicker and
dore complete obedience from that
fine but sometimes very perplexing
boy of yours if you make him aware
that you note with approval the strug
gles he does make to toe the mark.
the self denial he now and then prac
tices in order to comply with your
wishes. To bring up children in an
atmosphere which lacks the elements
which parental fondness and appre
clativeness contribute to it is like put
ting a tender, tropical plant into the
hard, cold ground on a November
day. Children in the home, pupils in
the school thrive and blossom Into
strong and lovely characters when
they have the proper amount of ap
preciation. On the other hand, the
boys and girls themselves need to ap
preciate their parents and it is to be
feared that In this age when parents
are doing more for their children than
ever before there has not been a cor
responding Increase of deference and
considerateness on the part of the
children.
"In the shop and factory there Is
the same righteous demand for ap
preciation not of laziness or slipshod
work, but of fidelity, of long contin
ued acceptable service, of the contri
bution which even the humblest
worker is making to the success of
the concern. Our labor problems
would be nearer solution if employers
oftener said: 'Well done, little Joe,'
"The church is another field for the
exercise of the art of appreciation.
If your pastor helps you, tell him
Don't be afraid of spoiling him.
Ministers don't spoil so easily now
adays. That was a beautiful motto
which a church once put on the wall
to welcome a pastor returning from a
long vacation, 'We love you, and we
tell you so.' "
TILE ROAD TO YESTERDAY.
If I could only find the road.
The road to yesterday.
I'd ease my heart of many a load
That burdens it today.
Recall the words so harsh, unkind,
Kiss clean the stabs I made whenbllnd.
Plant love for hate if I could find
The road to yesterday.
The road to yesterday.
The road to yesterday!
Unlock. O blessed angel guide.
My night of sleep and open wide
The gates that Intervene and hide
The road to yesterday!
Repentant, turn and walk again
The road to yesterday!
Rewrite the page with cleaner pen
And wipe out yesterday.
With wiser heart I would retrace
The stains of sin and wrong efface.
My tortured soul seeks means of grace
To re-live yesterday.
O angel, show me, pray,
The road to yesterday!
With precious blood the way v
bought:
I've found the blessed boon I sought;
Tomorrow shall be happier wrought
Than was my Yesterday.

HIGH COURT DI3NLCS RELIEF.
Habeas Corpus Will Not Issue to Pet
ti bone and 1 eilow Prisoners.
Washington, Dec 3. The supreme
court of the United States today de-
ided. adversely to the men. the ha
beas corpus cases of il oyer, Hay
wood and Pettibone, the representa
tives of the Western Federation of
Miners, who are now held in prison
in Idaho on the charge of complicity
in the murder of former Governor
Stunenberg. The opinion was by Jus
tice Harlan.
The effect of the decision will be to
continue to hold the men in confine
ment for trial in Idaho.
Of the men involved, Charles H.
Moyer, is president; W. D. Haywood,
secretary-treasurer; and George A-
Pettibone. a member or the western
Federation of Miners. They are now
n prison in Canon county, Idaho, un
der a charre of murdering former
Governor Stunenberg of that state, al
though it was not charged that they
were present when the crime was
committed. The cases came to this
court on an appeal from a decision of
the Idaho federal court, refusing to
grant writs of habeas corpus.
The principal point or controversy
was the method by which the Idaho
authorities secured Jurisdiction over
the men. All of them are residents of
Colorado and It was alleged on behalf
of Moyer and his associates that they
were kidnaped in pursuance or a con
spiracy to which the governor of Co
lorado and the Idaho authorities were
parties and hence that Jurisdiction
was acquired by fraud.
Justice Harlan said in so rar as tne
application for a writ of habeas cor
pus in the United btates courts was
concerned the method of extradition
of the defendants was not material.
The merits of the cases were not In
volved, as that phase was not ques
tioned. The only question involved
was the right of the state courts to
proceed with the cases, of which
there could be no doubt.
Justice McKenna delivered a dis
senting opinion, holding that Moyer,
Haywood and Pettibone had a ngni
to invoke the aid of the federal courts
to correct improper methods used in
spcurtntr their extradition. He said-
that kidnaping under the law is no
more to be justified than when per
formed outside the law, where every
effort of authority is used to prevent
and punish it.
In his dissenting opinion justice
MeKenna said:
In the case at bar, the states
through their officers, are the offend
ers. They by an Illegal exertion of
power, deprived the accused of a con
stitutional right. The distinction Is
Important to be observed. But It doe3
not need emphasizing. Kidnaping is
a crime, pure and simple. It is diffi
cult to accomplish; hazardous at ev
ery step. All the officers of the law
may be invoked against It. But how is
t when the law becomes the kidnap
er? When the officers of the law, using
its forms and exerting its powers,
becomes abductors? This is not a dis
tinction without a difference. It 13
another form of the crime of kidnap
ing distinguished only from that com
mitted by an individual by circum
stances. If a state may say to one
within her borders and upon whom
her process is served, T will not In
quire how you came here; I must ex
ecute my laws and remit you to pro
ceedings against those who have
wronged you, may she so plead
against her own offense? May she
claim the mere physical presence of
the accused within her borders of one
who is brought there by violence as
justification of her offense?
"Constitutional right the petitioner
in this case certainly did have, and
valuable ones. The foundation of ex
tradition between the states is that the
accused should be a fugitive from
justice from the demanding state, and
he may challenge the fact by habeas
corpus Immediately upon his arrest.
If he refutes the fact he cannot be
removed and the right to resist re
moval is not a right to assume. It is
the right to be free from molestation.
it is the right of personal liberty in Its
most complete sense."
Justice McKenna here Inserts In his
opinion a statement of the hasty In
carceration of Moyer, Haywood and
Pettibone and concludes:
"No Individual could have accomp
lished what the power of the two
states accomplished. No Individual
could have commanded the means and
success; could have made two arrests
of prominent citizens by invading
their homes; could have command
ed the resources of jails, armed
guards and special trains; could have
successfully timed all acts to prevent
inquiry and Judicial Interference.
"The petitioner, as soon as he could
have done so. submitted his right to
the consideration of the federal court.
He could not have done so in Colo
rado, he could not have done so on the
trip from Colorado. At the first in
stant of time that the state of Idaho.
so far released its restraining power
to enable him to consult counsel and
appeal to the writ of habeas corpus.
he should have been heard, not dis
missed from court, and the action of
the circuit court in doing so should
be reversed."

OPENING DAY
QUICKLY.
PASSED
Resolutions of Inquiry Into Discharge
of Colored Troops Was Prompt
ly Brought Forward.
Washington, Dec 3. The Fifty-
ninth congress began its last session
at noon today. It took only fifteen
minutes to arrange the preliminaries.
The senate received from the presi
dent a long list of appointments for
its confirmation and in an executive
session of nineteen minutes decided.
as the nominations had been received
before the body had been organized
formally, to make no confirmations
until the president's annual message
had been received and the senate fin
ally started.
Senators . Penrose of Pennsylvania
and Foraker of Ohia came forward
with resolutions of inquiry .regarding
the discharge of the negro troops of
the Twenty-fifth infantry. One was
addressed to the president and the
other to the secretary of war. After
the ripple of surprise had passed and
Vice President Fairbanks had sug
gested that it was unusual to tran
sact any business until the presldent'3
message had been received, the reso
lution went over by unanimous con
sent.
Senator Dupont of Delaware took
the oath of office.
The opening of the two houses was
witnessed by an animated throng
which filled the galleries to their ca
pacity. Hundreds went away disap
pointed in not gaining admission to
the session of either the senate or the
house.
Not in years has a larger number
of members-elect of the lower house
of congress presented themselves at
the speaker's desk to take the oath of
office. Death was unusually active
among the membership during the
closing daj-s of the last session and
the beginning of the present, and
Chaplain Couden feelingly called the
attention of the body to the work of
the grim reaper during the months
since adjournment.
Speaker Cannon appointed James

The galleries of the house were
crowded at an early hour. The ab
sence of flowers from the desks of the
members was much commented on.
but the order of the speaker prohibit
Ing the floral display was generally
commended for its good sense. A si
milar rule was made in the senate
two years ago.
Mrs, Nicholas Longworth, daughter
of the president, occupied a seat in the
executive gallery, accompanied by
Miss Hagner, social secretary of the
wire or the president.
The routine work of the house in
cident to the opening day was quick
ly dispatched, the roll call showing
nearly sou members present.
Representative Bourke Cochran of
New York, who recently married Miss
Ide. was the subject of hearty laught
er when his personal request that he
be permitted to absent himself for an
indefinite period on aecount of busi
ness, was laid before the house by the
speaker.
After the appointment of the usual
committtee to wait upon the president
and inform him that the house had
been organized and was ready to re
celve any communication he might
desire to make of interest to the pub
lie service, the house adjourned out
of respect to the memory of the de
