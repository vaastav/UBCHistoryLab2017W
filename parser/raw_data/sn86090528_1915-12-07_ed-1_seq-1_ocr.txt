President Delivers Annual Message to Congress

Chi
Daily
CALLS ON NATION TO
PREPARE
"Pay as You Go" Policy to Meet Cost
of Preparedness Recommended;
More Income Tax Suggested;
Merchant Marine Advocated
STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
The department of war contemplates an Increaie of the standing
force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers
and 102,985 enlisted men to 7,136 officers and 134,'07 enlisted men, and
supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens.
It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of
strength and efficiency.
The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have
been uttered within our own borders.
It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and
development that we should have a great merchant marine.
It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that In what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go.
We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov
ernment If we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the income taxes.
We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico and we have
atood the test. .Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we
have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the independence
and prosperity of the states of Central and South America la not
altered.
Note The president's message will
be found on page four of this paper.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. For the
tenth time since ho entered the White
House, President Wilson today ap
peared before the two houses of con
gress in joint session, delivering his
annual message in person.
Special interest attached to the
president's address this time on ac
count of the, expectation that he would
define his position on the question of
preparedness, an Issue upon which
leaders of his party are divided.
The galleries of the bouse chamber
were packed long before the chief ex
ecutive entered. The formalities of
the occasion were much the same as
have marked previous appearances of
the president before the law-makers of
the nation.
The president entered the house
ihamber at 12:40 o'clock this after
tuxm. and It was 1:43 o'clock when he
finished the reading of his message
which was somewhat longer than he
has been accustomed to deliver. He
read In, a clear tone of voice and at
times placed dramatic emphasis upon
Ills words.
In opening his address the president
referred to the world war, declaring
that "we have stood apart, studiously
neutral," and then he touched upon
Latin-American and Mexican matters.
National defense was the next topic
considered, the administration pro
gram for military and naval Improve
ment being outlined. Merchant ma
rine and means of raising additional
revenues occupied the main part ot
'the remainder of the message.

By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. That the
Democratic national convention, Juno
12, will be held in St. Louis, with
Wilson the nominee, now seems th'e
probable result of the meeting
of the Democratic national committee.
Sentiments were sharply but favor St.
Louis. The fight now seems narrowed
to St. Louis, Chicago and Dallas, in the
order named. Balloting for the selec
tion is expected to begin at i o'clock
this afternoon. '
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dee 7. The 1916
presidential campaign was launched
here today with the Democratic na
tional committee meeting to select a
place and time for the Democratic na
tional convention. The Republican
committee meets here a week from
today to do the same. The Democratic
committeemen favor June.
President Wilson's renomination
was not questioned by the Democratic
chieftains. Other features of the cam-
paign, including renomination of Vice
President Marshall, were much dis
cussed, Informally.
Democratic leaders, war horses and
politicians, the usual entourage of the
national committee's annual meeting
and the committees from cities seek
ing the convention, were here as
usual.
There was much verbal speculation
regarding the alleged movement to .
oust William F. McCoombs of New
York as chairman. Friends of Fred
B. Lynch of Minnesota were said to be
active in trying to have him succeed
McCoombs. Party leaders insisted the
rumors were without foundation.
Among the cities bidding fur the con
vention were Chicago, St. Ixjuis, Dal
las, San Francisco and Omaha.
Lengthy arguments and pyrotechnics
were scheduled.
Called Jo order at 11 o'clock at the
New Willard Hotel by Chairman Mo
Coombs, the morning session was
largely routine.
There were eight vacancies on the
committee. In two of these there were
contests from Oregon and Kentucky.
Urey Woodson and Gen. W. B. Halde
man were the contestants for Ken
tucky's seat and Will R. King and
H. M. Easterly for Oregon's. Both
contests presented novel tangles.
Woodson was chosen by the Kentucky
fctate committee. At last summer's
state convention General Haldeman
was named national committeeman. A
similar family quarrel was the Oregon
contest. King was selected by the
Oregon state committee and in last
year's primary election Easterly was
chosen by the Democratic voters.
Democratic precedent provides full
four year terms for each committee
men. The national committee was
presented with the prob'""i of over
throwing choices of state couiumtees,
according to established precedent, by
recognizing the choice of a party con
ventions and the rank and file in a
primary contest. Full authority and
discretion was vestd in the commit
tees, to decide the contests.
Other new members seated today
were: Vincent Miles ot Little Rock.
Ark., to succeed W. H. Kavanaugh.

AGAIN NEAR '
BREAK WITH
GERMANY?
State Department Declines to Heed
Request to Give Reasons for
Asking Recall of Embassy
Attaches
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 The state
department's formal refusal to grant
the German government's request for
the reasons actuating the United
States in asking the recall of Captain
Boy-ed- and Captain von Papen, em
bassy attaches, was sent to Berlin and
to Ambassador Bernstorff last night,
it became known today. The German
embassy, It is said, interprets this ac
tion as very unfriendly.
Germany through Bernstorff and
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin re
quested that reasons for the recall be
given privately if the state department
did not desire to make the reasons
public. Secretary Lansing refused to
give the desired information either
privately or publicly.
State department officials make no
attempt to minimize the effect that
such a reply may have on Germany.
Berlin must now make the first move.
The bearing which the alleged activ
ities of German agents in Mexican af
fairs may have on the newly arisen
acute situation was indicated by At
torney General's admission that his
department was still gathering infor
mation of that kind.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. It is be
lieved that Germany and the United
States are nearer a break in diplo
matic relations than they have been
at any time since the war began.
Those in close touch with the situation
say that either this is true or Germany
is making a colossal diplomatic bluff.
The outcome is thought to be uncer
tain with the possibility of se,loiis
'iventualides. Officials have discussed
the possibility of a breach, with the
recall of Ambassador Bernstorff volun
tarily by his own government. They
are hopeful, however, that the dead
lock over Germany's demands for rea
sons why this government has asked
for the recall of Captain Boy-ed and
Caplain von Papen may be settled
amicably.
Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Hill of Hemp
stead, Texas, are in the city visiting
their daughter, Mrs. Ed F. Johns.
Mr. and Mrs. Hill have not been here
since 1870, when they traveled from
the enst to P;illns In a wagon.

BOARD IN
REGULAR
SESSION
Several Road Matters Considered
by Commissioners; Assistant At
torney and Inspector Clash
Over Certain Claims
The board of county commissioners
met in their regular monthly session
in the office of the county clerk yes
terday afternoon with all board mem
bers present.
The reports of the officers for Grady
county for the month of November,
were presented and after having been
first duly audited were allowed.
The matter of the Luclle road com
ing up Commissioner Bryant reported
that the right-of-way through the
Minter lands would have to be pur
chased. In the same connection it was
reported to the board that the land
heretofore controlled by Dave Hill had
been advertised for sale. In the same
connection Mr. Marlow reported that
Dixon would fight the opening of the
road through his lands.
The board instructed Mr. Marlow to
take the matter of the opening of the
road up with the township board and
with Messrs. Minter and Dixon and
see if an amicable settlement could
not be arranged.
A petition was then presented for
the opening and bridging of a road on
the section line between sections
11-14, township 5, range 7 west. The
petitioners asked that the county be
required to put in and construct the
necessary bridges for opening the road
along the section line. Investigation
disclosing that there were uo funds
available for this purpose the board
declined to consider the petition and
the petitioners withdrew the same.
Upon the proper motion being pre
sented it was ordered that the claims
arising from the Elmer Gray judg
ment, amounting to $l,632.fit, and the
Pioneer judgment, amounting to
H2G.43, be allowed and paid.
A number of erroneous, tax assess
ments against certain Jndian lands
ordered Ftrlcken from the rolls.
By resolution NIm Wyatt was ap
pointed foreman on the work to be
done from donation funds on the road
running from Rush Springs west. On

rate of three dollars per day for the
time served as foreman on the public
highway.

BOND ISSUE
FOR SCHOOL
BUILDINGS
In Compliance with Request of
Board of Education Mayor Coff
man Calls Special Election
for December 21
SPECIFY $70,000 AS
AMOUNT NEEDED
Money Will Be Used for Repairing
and Equipping High School and
Erecting of Additional
Structure
In accordance with action taken by
the board of education setting forth
the need for additional school facili
ties in Chickasha, Mayor Coffman to
day issued a call for a special election,
to be held December 21, for the pur
pose of voting on a bond Issue of
$70,000.
Crowded conditions in the schools,
especially In the lower grades, have
been calling for relief for a long tlmo
and after due consideration the board
finally decided to submit the proposi
tion to the people, asking for a sum
sufficient to meet urgent needs, pro
viding the additional rooms and equip
ment necessary to take care of the
children and to enable the schools to
do effective work. , .
Speaking qf the situation in the
schools, Superintendent Ramey satd.
Every room Is full and the three yri
mary rooms with from 70 to 80 pupils
each are holding half-day sessions.
Some little ones have already been
turned away and I don't know what
we are goinp to do with the new crop
of beginners that will come at the
opening of the second terra. At the
prerent time we have the eighth gia ;e
and part ot the .seventh grade at the
high school in order to relieve conci
tions in the ward buildings and our
high school has grown till we aro i.o'.
able to handle them. Another thing.
our high hchol, is not now equipped
as a first-class high school must be
and notice' has been served upon us
that this is the last year that will be
given to us to so equip it, otherwise
we shall be dropped from the liBt of
schools accredited by the state univer
sity. We must hafe rooms for phys
ical, chemical, biological and agricul
tural laboratories and must get the
necessary equip'ment. To get this ad
ditional room we shall have to take
the seventh and eighth grades away
from the high school. My suggestion
to the board was to build a junior high
school to take care of all the seventh
and eighth grade pupils in the city.
This would remove the pressure at the
top and also would make more room
in the ward buildings for the primary
children. The amount which the board
is asking may seem large, but it is
all needed and the people may be
assured that it will be spent to advan
tage." The mayor's official call for the
election is printed on page seven of

BANKER IS
SENTENCED
By United Press.
MUSKOGEE, Dec. 7. W. P. Phil
lips, former cashier of the First Na
tional bank of Vinita, was convicted
of making false entries nine years ago
and today was sentenced by Federal
Judge Campbell to serve five years iu
prison.
Phillips was indicted In 1907, tried
in 1911, and appealed his case which
was reversed in 1913 by the circuit
court of appeals. The case was then
taken to the United States supreme
court, where the conviction was
' affirmed. Phillips has recently been

TO EDUCATE
PUBLIC IS
PROPOSED
Traffic Cop Stationed at Corner
Fourth and Chickasha by Chief;
Gives Course of Lessons
in Safety First
"HEED ALL RULES OF
STREET" IS ORDER
Period of Persuasion Will Precede
Application of Force to Viola

.
TRAFFIC RULES.
Wagons, buggies, bicycles,
autos, must keep on right side
of street.
All vehicles slow up at
corner.
Vehicles must not cross
streets, except at intersections
drive to "far" side of Inter
secting street before turning.
On overtaking another ve
hicle drive to left
Pedestrians pass from one
side of street to another only
on crossings cut out "angling."
Believing it is the only way to bring
about a system of "safety first" in the
matter of street traffic, Chief Phillips
of the Chickasha police has started in
by stationing a traffic officer at the
intersection of Chickasha avenue and
Fourth street during the busiest hours
of the day and evening.
Fourth and Chickasha is the busiest
corner in Chickasha. During rush
hours of any day in the week this
corner will be found in a greater or
less congested condition. Especially is
this condition marked on Saturdays
and on such days as First Monday.
Automobiles, service cars, street cars,
farmers wagons, delivery wagons, eur
ries, buggies, pedestrians are all
mixed in a true metropolitan maze on
this corner on busy days.
These conditions existing at this
corner, more than at any other corner
in Chickasha, Chief Phillips selected
this as the spot upon which to initiate
the anti-jay driving and the anti-jay
walking crusade which he and the
mayor of the city propose to conduct
an "anti" crusade In the interests ot
the "safety first" education of all who
use the thoroughfares of the city for
business or for pleasure. !
Chief Phillips stated this morning
that he felt more could be accom
plished by an educational campaign In.
this line than might be by popping
down the enforcement of the ordi
nances already existing and putting
the screws to all violators in the man
ner of arrests and fines. However,
Chief Phillips stated, should it become
necessary to hale some obstreperous
driver into court for failure to comply
with the ordinances after this school
of instruction had been conducted for
a reasonable length of time, then the
mayor will do the rest and will see to
it that the lesson is driven in.
In speaking of the matter further.
Chief Phillips Btated the growth of
vhickasha had rendered it necessary
that the ordinary rules of "safety
first" should be observed by all per
sons who drive, walk or otherwise
pass along the streets.
Officer Boleg is the first Chickasha
officer to bo detailed to '"traffic" duty.
As "one of the finest" this officer has
been stationed at the "Fourth and
Chickasha" intersection with instruc
tions to use his every endeavor to con
vince the public tU-.t i matter of the
enforcement of the anti-jay ordinance
is something more than a joke. His
duty, according to Chief Ph.'ilips, shall
be to educate the public along the
"suiety first" line In a courteous man
ner, but to use firmness should firm
ness be needed.
When asked If it was his intention
