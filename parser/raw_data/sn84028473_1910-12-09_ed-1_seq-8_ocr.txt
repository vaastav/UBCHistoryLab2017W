effect upon the cost of living When
President Joseph E Ransdell called

marks set forth the main points in the
waterway policy which the organisa

as follows
That no waterway Improvement
hall be entered upon by the govern
ment which has not the unqualified
approval of tho United States engi
neer corps That projects now under
construction should bo pushed to com
pletion as rapidly as men and money
can accomplish this preference be
ing given to such improvements as
from their nature will be of little use
until completed and which in any
vent will fit into any greater and
more extensive plan that may here
after be adopted That If tho funds
necessary for this purposo cannot be
provided for out of current revenues
of the government bonds should be
issued just as was and Is being dono
with tho Panama canal
Tho first formal nddrcs3 on tho pro

Largely matter of faith
Proof of Authenticity of Relics Re
ligious or Historical In Most
Cases Impossible
Tho authenticity of relics religious
or historical must in many cases be
largely a matter of faith proof is
often lacking often Indeed impossible
to procure Tho number of couches
notable from the fact that they have
been slept In by good Queen Bess
shown in manor houses is legion and
the same may bo said of many other
historical heirlooms the real history
of which It lost In the mists of an
tiquity How Many pairs of gloTes
were given by King Charles 1 as keep
sakes on he day of his execution
There are quite a number of claimants
for the honor One pair has recently
been the cause of a law suit and It
was said In the course of the trial
that they were given by the king to
Bishop Juxon on the scaffold There
Is yet another pair which has had a
far stranger history than most Stuart
relics which have Indeed little his
1
tory but a quiet passing from genera
tion to generation In EnglUh country
houses They were sent by King
Charles on the day of execution by a
trusty hand to Speaker Lenthall for
amitys sake Only one of the pair
now survives tho other was burned
In a bush flro In Australia The
precious gloves had gone there when
tho Lenthalls awhllo ago left their
homes and their lands and had with
Charles lls pardon of Lenthall been
cherished In many wanderings In Au
stralia The surviving glove and the
pardon are now back in England be
cause happily the Lenthalls aro back
It Is quite likely that King Charles
gave away several pairs of gloves for
gloves then were costly things cities
gave them to visiting sovereigns
where now addresses or gold boxes
are given But In the days of the
Stuarts gloves were costly enough at
any rate to carry a sentiment even a
kings sentiment
OLD SLAVE CITY IN AFRICA
Dr Peters Finds First Actual Ancient
Inscription Found In South
Africa
Dr Carl Peters tho German explor
er tells of strange finds in South Af
rica I was fortunate enough to dis
cover a tablot which so far as I know
contains the first actual ancient In
scription found in South Africa For
merly discoveries have not been of
proved actual Inscriptions but of
stones bearing marks strongly resem
bling ancient Semitic writings Tho
tablet In question was found by ono
of my men In a slavo pit to tho south
Df Inyanga north of Umtall Tho dis
trict contains hundreds of theso pits
from twenty to twenty five feot deep
in which the nnclcnts kept their slaves
Tho tablet was evidently made of ce
ment and had been cut In two clearly
while It was soft tho letters on It be
jig In no way damaged Tho characters
ook to me like Greek letters but other
experts say they nro
I tako It to be the half of an
indent passport ono portion of which
was retained by tho master and tho
other handed to the messenger
I also discovered near Zimbabwe a
brass figure- of Pan sir and a half
Inches In length very similar to the
figures found at Pompeii thus proving
Greek Influence In South Africa appar
ently at a later period than the tablet
I havo mentioned These and other
discoveries are to my mind further
proof that In South Africa there has
been a continuation of different civili
zations
It has also been shown that during
all these periods gold mining has been
carried on Apparently this was be
gun by natives of the soil probably
bushmen and it seems likely that the
first Semitic people who appeared on
the scene were only traders in tho
precious metal
She Keeps a Secret
Coroners Detective Frank Paul had
an amusing experience recently and
he has npt as yet decided whether it
was a joke or the truth The cir
cumstances are these
Paul was sitting in his office
meditating on the ways of the world
in general The telephone bell rang
Hello said the detective in his
best manner
Come down here quick said an
agitated feminine voice theres a
murder being done
What Is the address asked the
vigilant sleuth and 111 be down
right away
Its none of your business was
the snappy reply and the receiver
was hung up with a bang
Lots of people who are crazy are
quiet and It isnt necessary to send
them away

THE MkHOtttiMJ DISPATCH FRIDAY DECEMBER 9 1910
TAFT MAKES MANY RECOMMENDATIONS
Nations Executive Advocates Things
Which in His Judgment Are
cessary to be Done for Good
and Welfare of Country
Washington Dec 7 The president
has addressed to congress and to the
American people a letter of soma
88000 words The message Is a com
prehensive history of what has been
done by this government during the
past year and of the things which
in judgment of its chief executive of
ficer aro necessary to be done for
its welfare and progress during the
year which is to come In a single
sentence the message of President
Taft is an accounting to the people of
his stewardship as a chief executive
Wants Present Laws Enforctd
The most Important and far reach
ing suggestion of practical Importance
in the entire message is to be found
In one of its final paragraphs in which
tho president declares that there
should be no further legislation with
referenco to the regulations of cor
porations until we have haltod a while
to test the vigorous execution of the
laws on the statue book restraining
tho abuses which certainly did exist
and which aroused the public to de
mand reform
Mr Taft speaks clearly and with
unquestioned emphasis upon tho pos
tal savings bank and heartily recom
mends the parcels post on rural deliv
ery routes with eleven pounds the In
ternational limit to bo made the limit
of tho carriage
Tho president makes specific and
positive language tho sweeping pro
posal for tho extension of tho com
mission plan In all business legisla
tion Including tho tariff rivers and
harbors public buildings waterways
monetary afTalrs and the problems of
currency reform
Enlargement of Tariff Board
Ho Is In line with thoso who de
mand a downward revision of tho
tariff not In a new and general tariff
bill productive of uncertainty and un
settlement In business but a down
ward revision schedule by schedule
as expert study shall demonstrate It
to bo necessary Ho demands the en
largement of tho tariff board to a
tariff commission of experts which
shall lift tho tariff question abovo the
selfish wrangles of localities Into the
Catholic scope of the general national
interest Ho refers In strenuous fash
ion tho propriety of enacting a na
tional incorporation law
Ito stands In vigorous Americanism
for tho proper fortification of tho Pan
ama canal Ho rings clear and true
In his vigorous rind cmphntlc demand
for nn tndlspcnsnblo merchant marine
either by mnll subsidy or other sub
vention adequate to guarantee tho res
toration of tho American flag to its
ancient commercial place upon the
sens Ho speaks clearly In advocacy of
tho eight hour law for labor for a
proper system of compensation for
industrial accidents to laborers for
tho employers liability act and for
reasonable compensations to work
