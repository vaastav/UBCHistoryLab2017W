THE PRESIDE N TVS M KS& A . I .
The President's message is now
before the people. It is a volumin
ous document, strong in the recom
mendations pertaining to Cuba but
weak in regard to the Phillippines
and the financial question. It shows
that the expenses of running the
government are far in excess of the
revenue, which means that the
stamp tax is to be continued indefi
nitely. The recommendations as to
the Nicaraguan canal will meet with
general approval. The historical re
view of the vvar comprises a great
portion of the message.
PETITIONS TO INVESTIGATE.
It is understood that Daniel Mc
Donald has filed a petition to the
board of county commissioners ask
ing that an examination of the coun
ty books for the last four years be
made. A petition has also been cir
culated by others, asking for an ex
amination since 1S70. The Inde
pendent believes that if there has
been any crookedness, either by
democrats or republicans, it ought
to be exposed am in consequence
sanctions the investigation as far
back as any tax-payer may wish.
An interesting case has just been
decided by a Michigan circuit judge,
involving the question of a "legal
tender." A frrmer named Baldwin
tendered a money lender named
Baker 364 sdvcr dollars as payment
of a $330 mortgage and the interest
thereon. Baker refused the silver,
but Baldwin went to court to have
the mortgage cancelled as he had
tendered thr payment of it to Baker.
The lattei objected on the grounds
that in congress passed a coin
age law providing that the standard
gold dollar should be the unit of val
ue, and he argued that the market
value of the silver tendered him
was but 58 cents on the dollar The
circuit judge held that the tender of
the silver in payment was good and
ordered the mortgage discharged as
paid. The case will be appealed to
the supreme court of Michigan and
it is expected will go to the United
States supreme court.
The advocates of exDansion count
on 55 votes in the senate for the
ratification of the Paris treaty of
peace. Sixty votes (two-thirds) are
required to ratify. If the expan
sionists already have 55, they will
get the other five. Republican sen
ators opposed to ratification are pli
able. They will subordinate their
personal feelings to the wishes of
the McKinley administration. Sen
ator Teller, leader of the silver
forces, will do all in his power to
secure ratification, and Senator Mor
gan will see to it that certain demo
cratic senators from the south are
landed in the ratification camp. Sen
ator Murphy of New York, will
also assist. The most pronounced
opponent of ratification is Senator
McOafferey, of Louisiana, a gold
democrat.
Gen. Lew Wallace is now en
gaged in writing his autobiography,
and in this work will depart from a
a time-honored custom, in that the
work will not contain either his let
ters or his speeches. His friends
may look for a very deeply interest
ing book, for the general's experi
ence all through life and especially
during the war days, were of a kind
susceptible of Oeing worked up into
a thrilling autobiography.
The death of R. B. F. Pierce, of
Indianapolis, general manager of
the L D. & W. Ry., will be deeply
regretted throughout the state. He
has done much to promote the wel

The senatorial stock of Major
Steele is on the advance. He has
established his headquarters at the
Dennison hotel and his backers are
there in full force. Steele is one
of the shrewdest politicians in the

Wekl Indf pendent Four Years Old.
With this edition of the Week
ly Independent the weekly issue com
pletes its fourth year. It is young yet,
and it has the vigor of youth, as its ap
pearance plainly indicates.
There is doubtless no paper in Indi
ana that has had such marvelous growth
as the Weekly Independent. This is
accounted for by the fact that it has
adhered strictly to the truth regard ess
of conse luences. It has not utilized its
columns for half the year abusing those
whose political opinions are in opposi
tion to the editor.
It has tried to reflect the best thought
of the community. Today its adver
Using patronage is exceeded by no local
paper; typographically, it has no supe
rior in any of the surrounding cities. Jt
is a paper for the people and in the in
terest of the people.
The publisher is well pleased with its
past year's record for business and con
fidently predicts for it, as well as the
daily edition, a long and eventful ca
reer. It will always be found in the
front ranks advocating every move
ment intended to build up the city of
Plymouth or to advance the interests of
Marshall county.
A Moat Contemptible Specimen.
The Independent has heretofore cred
ited the mob that is trying to run
things in the ollice of the Evening
News with at least an atom of business
Lonor, but when they maliciously mis
represent lie business transactions of
this office, we conclude that they are
the incarnation of meanness, disturb
ers, undeserving of the considerations
that competitors would otherwise ac-
c rd them. 11 ere are the cuppiujrs
which are directed at this paper with
appareut malicious intent:
"The South liend furniture store
which advertises in a fake paper in this
county does not advertise in the South
liend paperR. They do not insert ad
vertisements for nothing in order to get
something to fill their columns.
'The paper which carries advertise
ments f ree of charge for buBiuess men
of other cities in order to get some
thing to till up his columns will oon he
bo low in the advertising scale tiiat live
dealers will demand damages when he
inserts their advertisements in order to
save setting type for his paper. Plym
outh Evening News."
In reply to the above. t he Independent
will quiet their presumptions with the
statement which any one can verify by
communicating with Sam It. Thomas
of South liend:
The furniture advertisement of Mr.
Thomas was brought to this oflice by
one of the South Bend ladies who came
here to attend the Kastern Star banquet.
The advertisement was accepted for a
period of six weeks in the Daily Inde
pendent for the sum of $12.50. This is
at the rate of a few cents over $8 per
month, the price which has governed
continuously during the present man
agement of this paper so far as space
advertisment is concerned .
If we wanted to be mean we would
show the people who it is That is adver
tising for a song by publishing the price
that Mr. Bosworth and Mr. Klcepfer
nay they pay for a whole column in the
Evening News. 13ut this is no concern
of ours. The Independent does not
care if the News advertises for nothing.
The chances are the publisher knows
what advertising in his paper is worth
and the chancee are that he gets all
that it is worth. The Independent has
a rate card to which it adhere-. Its
rates for advertising are justified by its
circulation, the publisher is convinced,
and all advertisers are treated alike
So far as Mr. Thomas' advertisement is
concerned, we accepted it, as any ma
in business would do. We think that
the local furniture dealers would not re
fuse to sell a 12.50 bill of furniture to
a South Hdnd business man, and tor
the same reason, the Independent does
not refuse business which comes to It.
The quoted squibs of the Evening
News which are directed at this paper
are quite in keeping with some of that
paper's other malicious attacks aimed
to thwart the hard ello-ts of Plymouth's
business men to bring the I tankard in
stitution here.
Hou . Burned tu the Oruund.
Tuesday at 3:30 p. m. the alarm
was sounded for the burning of Hart
Liggets house. This is the last house in
the row and is quite near the city limits.
When the fire bell first rang the llames
had already made rapid tieadway. It
was fully fifteen minutes afterwards
that the hoee cart arrived on the scene
of action and the fireman to their
chagrin discovered that the hose lacked
several rods of bringing the nozzle
within squirting distance. The big
white team of horses hitched to the hose
wagon were turned instantly and raced
to the city for more hose. By the time
of their return the house was almost
totally annihilated, partially by the lire
and partially by the fireman's hooks.
The department is to be congratulated
upon the difficult but successful fob of
saving lien Fetter's house with no other
apparatus than ladders and buckets.
The strong breeze blew ths llames of
the burning structure almost within
reach of the fireman while they worked.
The tire it is stated, started from a de
fective flue. All of the household
goods were saved.
Plymouth Lawyer t Columbia City.
large number of people from Mar
shall county are attending court at
Columbia City as parties and witnesses
in the case of lirubaker, administrator,
against ialentine and others. The case
goes to that court from Kosciusko
county and is an old timer, having been
in the Supreme Curt once or twice.
It involves about twenty thousand dol lars
worth of real estate near liourbon,
now held by J. M. Matchett, of liouibon
and J. K. Lawrence, of 1'ierceton. and
is hotly contested. The array of at
torneys in the case is somewhat formid
able, thosa representing the plantili be
ing L W. Koyse, and Wood ft liowser,
of Warsaw, and Marshall, McNaguy !c
Clugston, of Columbia City; the de
fendants, Lawrence and Matchett, be
ing represented by Charles Kellison, C.
P. Drummond and W. Ii. Hess, of
Plymouth, and A. A. Adams of Colum
bia City. It is thought that the case
will continue through this week.
Aceltlently Shot.
Saturday, near Elkhart, while chasing
a squirrel, Albert Heck accidently shot
Will Koland, aged 15, son of Benjamin
Roland, of Elkhart, the boy being about
15 feet away and the shot taking effect
in Roland's back. The charge went di
agonally through his body and lodged
between his left shoulder and the neck,
after passing through his lung. Two
ribs were found to have been shot oil
and the left lung was literally cut to
pieces, and they found portions of the
victim's clothing that had been carried
entirely through the body.
Death of f aroh Oliver.
Jacob Oli iger, one of the oldest resi
dents of Plymouth, died at his home on
S. Thayer stree- Wednesday morning.
The death occui ted after a protracted
period of sickness. He will be re
membered as a carpenter who at one
time had a good business. He leaves
in this world his wife and four children,
all of whom have reached the aire of
maturity.
The funeral has been announced for
two o'clock Friday and will be held at
his residence. Rev. L. S. Smith of the
M. E. church will otliciate.
Will Adopt the KngliHli Language.
Archbishop Elder, of Cincinnati, O.,
says the time is not far distant when
the Catholic church in America will
use the English language exclusively in
the services and instructions of the
priests, because this is the prevailing
tongue used Dy the rising generation
no matter what their nationality may
be. The children of foreigners born in
this country invaribly prefer the
English language, because that is the
one universally spoken here.
Compromised With the Church.
A compromise has been reached be
tween the authorities at Goshen and
the rector of the Episcopal church,
whereby the clergyman agrees to limit
the ringing of the church bell to twelve
taps sounded five times each day. The
reo' or is a disciple of the high church.
Constancy.
Friend if ter friend has lf t my side,
Departing uever to return
And some of those for whom I yearn
Were by the tenderest ties allhd.
From some the cruel hand of fate
In early youth did separate,
And others since that day have gone
Their different ways into the world;
And, like a leaf in winter whirled.
And I forever hurried on
Toward the cold cheerlens crypt.
One friend alone that from me goes
Always returns if I Inclose
A postage stamp my manuscript.

A few weeks ago the News made a
malicious attack upon this paper and
its editor, endeavoring to give its
slander backbone by drawing Mr. Swin
dell into it. Mr. Swindell, very man
fully puhlished a statement over his
signature branding the charges of the
News as false. As shown in last night's
issue of that sheet it is still jealously
malicious. It doubtless will have to be
turned up and spanked again. The
Independent is perfectly willing to ac
cept the verdict of the public.
A young man well dressed and intel

girl, he said, doubted his sincerity. He
informed her that he would comply
with any request or demand that she
might make of him to show that he was
in good faith. The young woman in
formed him that if he would secure a
white mule and ride it to Greensburg
within forty-eight hours from a given
time, the animal not being allowed to
move out of a walk, she would become
his bride.

Reducing Taxe- on Railways.
If railways are obliged to lower fares
one-third by thn enactment of a two-
cent fare law, will it not be just as
reasonable for tliem to expect a one
third reduction in the amount of taxes
they are required to annually pay into
stae and county funds? A reduction
of one-third in the vast sum of state
and county taxes paid by the railways
will mean a great deal to a state, but
but not any more than a two-cent fare
means to the railways. wit
