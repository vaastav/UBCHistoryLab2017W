UNION, ONE AND HTSEPEKABLS, NOW
Herdlns Cattle.-
Extract fr on a Private Letter.
Within a few vears a system of
cattle-growing has been practiced in
this country (111.) which changes the
characteristics of prairie farming.
The vacant lands are now bo general
ly enelosed that the pasture "range"
has become too narrow for the stock
of the farmer, and this has led the
owners of larce herds to establish
"ranchos" or herding stations, on the
borders of Inlet and Winnebago mar
shes, to which aro gathered in the
spring most of- the beef- and young
cattle of this section for pasturage
during the grazing season. In Octo
ber they are returned to their owners
who pay about one dollar per head,
for salting and attendance, thus get
ting a summer's growth at but slight
expense compared with home feed
ing, the animals thriving equally well.
The farmers following this sysiem,
are generally such as own from one
hundred to one hundred and sixty
acres of land, about one half being
kept under cultivation, in corn, wheat,
timothy, and the lesser crops.
e cannot give a better idea of
this system than by-some accouut of
the farm and management of Ira Bv
rcn, Esq. He has 240 acres of land,
nearly one third of which is in with
timothy, which he cuts as early as
it is fit for seed, carrfully saving the ,
straw, as well as that of his .larger
crops of wheat and oats in stacks for
winter forajre. His cornfield also1
furnishes a large amount of fodder.
He buys of his neighbors as he can,
their one, two and three year olds,
as before stated. In October, when
the prairie grass is all dead, his tis
mothy is excellent pasture, and here
his stock is kept until snow comes,
when they range the cornfields or feed
at the straw stacks as taey choose.
At the proper age, Mr. Brewer fat
tens his cattle for the Chicago mar
ket, feeding them liberally with corn
in the ear. About sixtv hos follow
the cattle to use up all the shelled
corn and that which is voided whole.
It is found that hogs do better when
fed in this way than if fed corn in the
ear fattening more readily and eco
nomically. !This system has its advantages in
allowing the profitable home consump
tion of all the fodder as well as the
coarse grains of the farm ; in ena
bling the farmer to keep all the stock
the farm will winter at but slight ex
pense per head ; and in the large a-
mount oi manure tnus iurnisnea ior
keeping the .soil in highly productive
state, lhe expense ot marketing tne
product is far less than in the form of
grain, and the prices are generally as
remunerative.
To Prepare Trees forPlantln
With a sharp knife cut off sloping
from the under side, any bruised or
broken roots, then reduce the tops to
correspond with the losis of roots, cut
ting off the surplus branches, and
reducing those forming the head to
three or four buds cm each of last
year's shoots. This will cause a more
r . - -i l A xv r i.
healthy anci vigorous kuooi me urbi
season its omission is a common
cause of the failure or sickly growth
of newly planted trees.
In setting, let one person hold the
tree in its position, while another fills
in the mellow earth, pressing it care
fully among the roots with the hand,
leaving no cavities underneath and
when the roots are all covered, pres
sing the whole down firmly with the
foot.
Avoid deep planting when all is
finished, the tree should be not over
two inches deeper than when in the
nursery.
Grapevines should be cut back to
two or three eyes, and only one of
these should be permitted to grow the
first year.
Blackberries and raspberries should
be cut back to within one foot of the
norund.
Gooseberries and currants should
he cut back to one or two eyes oflast
season's growth.
Trees planted in the Fall should
have earth hilled up around the stem,
six inches or mo;e in light, to hold
them firmly in position during win
ter, and protect th3 roots somewhat
from frost and excess of wet. This
is also a protection against injury by
mice. In sprirg the earth should be
leveled, and a few inches of coarse ma
nure or litter spread on the surface
over the roots for the space of four or
five feet in diameter; this will keep
the surface moist, prevent baking,
and check the growth of weeds.
If planting is done rather late in
spring, and in dry weather, it is well
to give water freely after setting the
trees and covering the roots with earth
letting it settle before finishing up ;
then if the surface is mulched as re
commended, no farther watering is
necessary.
No gras3 or grain crops should be
grown araoBg fruit trees, at least un
til they have arrived at bearing Bize,
even then it is bad economy.

DECEMBER 13, 1S62.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh
Congresf, December 1st, 1SC2.
FeUoiD Citizens of the Senate and
House of Representatives : j
Since vour last assembling another
year of health and bountiful harvest has
passed, and while it has not pleased the
Almighty to bless us with a return of
peace, we cannot but press on, guarded
by the best light he gives us, trusting
that in His own good time and wise way,
all will be well.
OUR 'FOREIGN RELATI05S.
The correspondence touching foreign
affairs which has taken place during the
last year, is herewith submitted, in vir
tual compliance with a request to that
effect, made by the House of Representa
tive near the close of the past session of
Congress. If the condition of our rela
tions with other nations is less gratifying
than it has usually been at other periods
it has certainly been more satisfactory
than a nation so unhappily distracted as
we are, might have reasonably appre
hended. In the month of June last there were
some grounds to exnect that the maratime
O A.
powers which, at the beginning of our
domestic difficulties so unwisely and so
unsuccessfully as we think, recognized
the insurgents as a beligerent power,
would soon recede from that position
which has proved only less injurious to
themselves than to our own country, but
the temporary reverses which afterwards
befel the national arms and which were
exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens
abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of
simple injustice.
The civil war which has so radically
changed for the moment the occupations
and habits of the American people, has
necessarily disturbed the social condition
and affected very deeply the prosperity
of the rations with which we have car
ried on a commerce that has been stead
ily increasing throughout the period of
half a century. It has at the same time
excited political ambitions and apprehen
sions, wrhich have produced a profound
agitation throughout the civilized world.
In this unusual agitation we have for
borne taking part in any controversy be
tween parties and factions in any such
Stales. We have attempted no prcpa
gandism and acknowledged norevelution,
but we have left to every nation the ex
clusive conduct and management of its
own anairs. uur struggle has been or
course contemplated by foieign nations
with reference less to its own merits than
to its supposed and often exaggerated
effects and the consequences resulting to
those nations themselves. Nevertheless,
complaint on the part of this Government,
even if if it were just, would certainly be
unwise.
SUPPRESSION CF THE SLAVE TRADE.
The treaty with Great Britain for the
suppression of the slave trade has been
put into operation with a good prospect of
complete success. It is an occasion of
especial pleasure to acknowledge that the
execution of it on the part of Her Ma
jesty's government has been marked with
a jealous respect for the authorities of the
United States, and the rights of their
moral and loyal citizens.
The convention with Hanover for the
abolition of the State dues has been car
ried into full effect, under the act of
Congress for that purposn.
THE COAST BLOCKADE.
A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast
could not be established and vigorously
enforced in a season of great commercial
activity like the present without commit
fing occasional mistakes, and inflicting
unintentional injurie upon foreign na
tions and their subjects. A civil war,
occurring in a country where foreigners
reside and carry on a trade under treaty
stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of
complaints .of the violations of neutral
rights. All such collissions tend to ex
cite misapprehensions and possibly to pro
duce national reclamations between na
tions which have a common interest in
preserving peace and friendship.
In clear cases of these kinds I have,
so far as possible, heard and redressed
complaints which have been preferred by
friendly powers. There is, however, a
large and augmenting number of doubt
ful cases upon which the government is
unable to agree with the government
whose protection is demanded by the
claimants, lhere are, moreover, many
cases in which the United States or their
citizen suffer wrongs from naval or mil
itary authorities of foreign nations, which
the government of these States are not
prepared to redress.
AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION.
I have proposed to some of the foreign
C...- .1 - . .J l 1.
oiaitrs uius imi.'rcMcu uium;u couverjuons
to examine and adjust such complaints.
This propositihn has been made especially
to Great Britain, to France, to Spain
and to Prussia. In each case i: has been
kindly received, but has not yet "been
formally adopted.
THE CASE OF A NORWEGIAN BARK.
I deem it my duty to recommend an
appropriation in behalf of the owners of
the Norwegian bark, Admira P. Fcrciens
Riola, which vessel was in May, 1SG1,
prevented by the commander of the block
ading force off Charleston from leaving
that port with a cargo, notwithstanding a
similar privilege had shortly before teen
granted to an English vessel. I have di
rected the Secretary of State to cause the
papers in the case to be communicated to
the proper committee.
AFRICAN EMIGRATION.
Applications have been made to me by
many free Americans of African descent
to favor their emigration, with a vieiv to
such colonization as was contemplated in
recent acts of Congress. Other parties,
at home and abroad, some from intereste d
motives, others from patriotic principles,
UZ Hy

and still others influenced by philanthrop-
ic Fentiments, have surested similar
measures; while on the other hand sev
eral of the Spanish Amerioan Republics
have protested against the sending of
such colonies to their respective territo
ries. Under these circumstances I have de
clined to move any such colony to any
State without first obtaining the consent
of its Government, with an agreement on
its part to receive and protect such emi
grants in all their rights asfreeaen, and
I have, at the same time, offered to the
several States situated in the tropics, or
having colonies there to negctisite with
them, subject to the advise and consent
of the Senate, to favor voluntary emigra
tion of portions of that class to their re
spective Territories, upon conJitions
which shall be equal, just and humane.
Liberia and Hayti are the only coun
tries to which colonists of African de
scent from here could go with a certain
ty of being received and adopted as citi
zens, and 1 regret to say that such per
sons, contemplating colonization, do not
seem so willing to emigrate to these
countries as to some others, nor so willing
as I think their interest demands. I
believe, however, that the opinion is im
proving, and that ere long there will be
an augmented and considerable emigra
tion to both these countries from the
United States.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The new commercial treaty between
the United States and the Sultan of Tur
key has been carried into execution. A
commercial and consular treaty has been
negotialed, subject to the Senate's con
sent, with Liberia, and a similar negoti
ation is now pending with the Republic
of Hayti. A considerable improvement
cf the national commerce is expected to
result from these measures. Our rela
tions with Great Britain, France, Spain,
Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark,
Sweeden and Austria, the Netherlands,
Italy, Rome, and the other European
States, remain undisturbed. Very fa
vorable relations also continue to be
maintained with Turkey. Morocco, China
and Japan.
OUR NEIGHBORING NATIONS.
During the last year there has not
only been no change of our previous re
lations with the Independent btates of our
continent, but mere friendly sentiments
than have been heretofore existing are
believed to be entertained by those
neighbors whose safety aud progress are
so intimately connected with our own.
This statement especially applies to Mex
ico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras,
Teru and Chili. The commission under
the convention with the republic cf New
Grenada closed its session without hav
ing audited and passed upon all the
chirns which were submitted to it. A
proposition is pending to revive the con
vention that it may be able to do more
complete justice. The commission be
tween the United States and the repub
lic of Costa Rica has completed its labors
and submitted its reports.
INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.
I have favofed the project of connect
ing the United Slates with Europe by an
Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project
to extend the telegraph from San Fran
cisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph
with the wire that is being extended
across the Russian empire.
OUR TERRITORIES.
The Territories of the United Stales,
with unimnortant exceptions, have re-
A

they are exhibiting such eviJence of j
pro.per.ty as justifies an expectation that
some ot tnem win soon De in a conuuiuu
to be organized as States and be consti
tutionally admitted into the Federal
Union
The immense mineral resources of
some of these Territories ought to be
developed as rapidly as possible. Every
step in that direction would have a ten
dency to improve the revenues of the
Government and diminish the burdens of
thepeople.
A SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION.
It is worthy of your serious consider
tion whether some extraordinary meas
ures to promote that end cannot be ad
opted. The measure which suggests
itself as most likely to be effective is a
scientific exploration of the mineral re
gions in those Territories, with a view to
the publication of its results at home and
in foreign countries results which can
not fail to be auspiciou3.
NATIONAL FINANCES.
The condition of the finances will
claim your m st diligent consideration.
The vast expenditures incidental to the
military and naval operations required
for the suppression of the rebellion have
hitherto been met with a promptitude and
certainty usual in similar circ im'tances,
and the public credit ha- been fully
maintained.
THE CURRENCY INFLATION.
The continuance of the war, however,
and the increased disbursfment3 made
necessary by the augmented forces now
in the field, demand your best reflection
as to the test mode of providing the
necessary revenue without injury to busi
ness, and with the least possible burdens
upon labor. The suspension of specie
payment by the tanks, soon aftnr the
commencement of your last session, made
large issues of United States note una
voidable
In no other way could the
payment of the troops and other just de -
rounds be so economically or as well pro -
vided for. The judicious legislation of
Congress securing the recsivability of
these notes for leans and internal cuties,
and making them a legal tender for oth
er debts, has made them universal cur
rency, and has satisfird, parti lily at least,
and for the time, the long -felt want of a
uniform circulating medium, saving there
by to the people immense sums in dis-

EVILS OF FLUCTUATION.
Fluctuations in the taiue of currency
are always injurious, and to reduce these
fluctuations to the "lowest possible point,
will always be a leading purpose in wise
legislation. Prompt and certain conver
tibility into coin is generally acknowl
edged to be the lest and surest against
them, and it is extremely doubtful wheth
er a circulation of United Slates notes,
payable in coin, and sulliciently large fcr
the wants of the people, can be perma
nently, usefully and safely maintained.
Is there any other medium which the
necessary provision for the public-wants'
can be made, and the great advantages
cf a safe and uniform currency secured ?
A REMEDY PROPOSED.
I know of none which promises so cer
tain results, and at the same t;me so un
objectionable as the organization of bank
ing associations under a general act cf
Congress, well guarded in its provisions.
To such associations the Government
might furnish circulating notes on the"
security of United States bonds deposited
in the Treasury. These notes, prepared1
under the supervision of proper ofBcers,
and being uniform in appearance ard
security, and convertable always with
coin, woull at once protect later against
the evils of a vicious currency, and facil
itate commerce by cheap and safe ex
changes. A moderate reservation from
the interest on these bends would com
pensate the United States for the prepa
ration and distribution of the notes, and
a general supervision of the system would
lighten the burden of that part of ths
public debt employed as security. The
public credit, moreover, would be greatly
improved, and the negotiation of new
loans greatly facilitatsd by the steady
market demand for Government bond,
which the adoption of the proposed sys
tem would create. It is an additional
recommendation of the measure, of con
siderable weight in my judgment, that it
would reconcile, a3 far as possible, all ex
isting interests by the opportunity offered
to existing institutions for a secured uni
form nationalcirculation in place of the
local and various circulation, secured and
unsecured, now issued bv them.

WAR AND NAVY REPORTS.
The reports of the Secretaries of the
Navy and War are herewith transmitted.
These reports, though lengthy, are
scarcly more than brief extracts of the
very numerous and extensive transactions
and operations conduced through these
Departments, nor could I give a summa
ry of them here upon any principle whieh
would admit of its being much shorter
than the reports themselves.
I therefore content myself with lay
ing the reports before you, and asking
your attention to them.
THE POST OFFICE T APARTMENT.
It gives me pleasure to report a deci
ded improvement in the financial condi
tion of the Post Oilice Department, as
compared with the several preceeding
years. The receipts for the fiscal year,
16G1, amounted to $5,349,200 40, waich
embraced the revenue from all the States
of the Union for three-quarters of that
year. Notwithstanding the cessation cf
revenue from the iiO-called Confederate
States, during the list fiscal y:ar the in
crease of the correspondence of the loyal
States has been sufficient to produce a
revenue during the same yesr of $3,299,
520 90, being only $50,000 less than was
derived from all tte States cf the Union
the previous year.
The expenditures show a still mere fa
vorable result. The amount expended ia
1561 was S12.606.7S3 11. For the last
jyear lhe amount his teen reduced to
' Sll, 125,364 13, showing a difference of
: about 81,457,000 in the expenditures, as
compared with the preceding year, or
about 2.750.000, as compared with the
fiscal year of 1560.
The deficiency in the Department fcr
the previous year was S-i,55i,CC .j D3.
For the last fiscal year it was reduced to
82,112,514 57. These favorable rsrolts
are, in fact, owtng to the cessajiaa cf
