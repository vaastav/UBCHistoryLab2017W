Wednesday, Dec. 13, 1905.
Entered in the po^toffice at Aew Llm,
linn., as second clas^ matter.
All the messages of the presidents
since 1897 have been a continued story
of national prosperity. On that item
everybody should be willing to stand
pat.
It is scarcelj possible that Count
Witte has had a single pleasant
moment or experiencec modicum of
personal successs since his great
diplomatic success.
There are grave indications that the
Czar of Russia will have to take the
lead of his army or leave the country.
Most of his generals have resigned
their places and lequested that thej be
relieved.
The oppositions the Roosevelt plan
for dealing with the transportation
question is fast disappearing. Sen
ators are falling into line, the railroad
presidents are becoming con\inced
and the people are getting busy.
The Hartford Courant sajs: "Prob
ably the next generation of Americans
will see at the national capital a glori
ously massive and towering monument
to all the dead soldiers, of America."
The combination of indomitable cour
age with grand achievements deserves
the greatest memorial that can be de
vised.
Sam Lord ot Kusson has had the
temerity to announce that he is willing
to be a candidate for governor and
will stand for the nomination when the
time lor nomination comes. He is
the choice of a number of the senators
of the last legislature and of Senator
Somerville. But it will be hard for
some of the people of the state to
enthuse much over the name of Lord.
The revisers of the Caadian tariff
continue their wanderings up and down
the Dominion, and seem to get deeper
all the time in a complication of views
and cross currents. Their work will
please their government and them
selves about as well as the tariff re
visers of this country -will please the
majority of people here.
"It is greatly to be wished," says the
President's message, "that the state of
New York should copy as regards
Niagara what the state of California
has done as regards the Yosemite."
California has made the national
governmei\t the owner of the Yosemite
valley. There seems to be no other
way to save Niagara Falls.

And it is up to you to make the

making Christmas purchases. This store is in better shape now than ever
before to t*ke care of its customers and our stock is right np to the mark.
Forgot somebody?
Well, we are ready to help you
out. That is one of our missions.
We will help you. and no time lost.
People and goods must move quick
ly. Good suggestions for those
you forgot.
The passage in the president's mess
age on the food adulteration vigorous
ly touches on a matter that legislators
in this country have neglected.
From all indications and they point
pretty strongly to the truth, Japan's
ship of state is begining to carry a full
ballast in the shape of a national debt.
Apropos of thanksgiving, can the
country from year to year show as
great an improvement in moral stam
ina and right purpose as in business
statistics.
Since Mr. Bryan left the country
Pennsylvania has gone democratic
and silver has reached its highest
price in five years. But perhaps these
are mere coincidences.
The President on National Needs.
The constitutional injunction to
••give to the Congress information of
the state of the Union, and recommend
to their consideration such measures
as he shall judge necessary and ex
pedient.'' ir obeyed by President
Roosevelt with a clearness and a full
ness which leaves nothing to be desired.
As was expected, the leading place in
the message is given to the necessity
of railroad rate regulation by the
national government, but this is only
a small part of the scheme of govern
mental supervision over the great
activities which he proposes. •'Inorder
to insure a healthy social and industrial
life," he sa^s. "every big corporation
should be held responsible by and ac
countable to some sovereign strong
enough to control its conduct," and,
obviously, the only power adequate to
this task is the government of the
United States. He repeats and em
phasizes his recommendation ot 1904
for a supervision and regulation by
the national government of interstate
transactions in insurance.
What the President says about the
necessity for Congress to enact such
legislation as will expedite the con
struction of the Panama canal will ap
peal to the people and to Congress.
The need, too, which he urges, of plac
ing the army and, navy on the highest
possible condition of efficiency, of
strengthening the coast defenses and
of the erection of adequate fortifica
tions at Hawaii, will be plain to Con
gress. The Monroe doctrine is always
with us,, but this, as he intimates, can
not be enforced unless we have a navy
and an army equal to the task. As a
corollary of the Monroe doctrine the
President entered into a treaty with
Santo Domingo in 1904 to aid the people
of that country in straightening out
their finances, iirorder to avert trouble
between them and foreign governments.
This treaty, which has been before the

senate for many months, will doubtless
soon be ratified. Pending action'on
the treaty the United States is super
vising the collection of the revenue in
Santo Domingo, in the interest of the
people of that country and of their
foreign creditors, among which is the
United States. Incidentally, too. we
are heading off insurections and an
archy in the island, and have estab
lished a stability and an order unknown
in recent years.
As was expected, the President urges
the speedy admission of Oklahoma and
the Indian Territory as a state, and he
also recommends the admission of
Arizona and New Mexico jointly, the
four territories to make two states. It
is to be hoped, however, that the mis
take of putting the two groups of terri
tories in the same bill, which was per
petrated in the two latest Congresses,
will be avoided this time. The country
will be glad to hear his plea for the
organization of Alaska into a terri
tory, to be represented in Congress by
a delegate. This measure of justice
to the people of our big northern
colony has been delayed too long.
His condemnation of breaches of trust
in the public service is none too strong,
in view of therecentrevelations against
prominent officials. Other Presidents
have also urged economy in the public
service, but Mr. Roosevelt goes farther,
and recommends, as part of his plan
of cutting down expeditures, the aboli
tion of ail unnecessary offices. With
the government's outgo in excess of
its income, as it has been in the past
two years, the necessity for cutting
down expenditures as far as this can
be done without detriment to the public
service, is pretty plain to the people.
The message is clear, comprehensive
and strong. It touches on all the
United States' great concerns, internal
and external, and it deals with them
sanely and adequately.
Word comes to the effect that there
is to be a general investigation of the
Standard Oil company from the seat
of government at Washington. As far
as this goes it is all right but the
general opinioa seems to be that when
the investigation is ovsr and the in
vestigators have been paid the whole
thing will be dropped. It is wh,at
should follow a conscientious investi
gation of these things that most con
cerns the people of this country. The
appointment of a committee to investi
gate the matter of railroad rates and
the insurance muddle in liable to be
all that congress may do at the present
session. There is too much investi
gation that does not produce results.
These genuine Hohner Harmonicas
are what please the boys. Give him

anticipated for this great annual event
and on account of the inability of the
builders to complete the magnificent
new amphi-theatre on time, it has been
found necessary to postpone the Ex

be held on the days of the week corre
sponding to the dates arranged for the
previous week. All preparations are
being made to make the event one long

convenient for a larger number to at
