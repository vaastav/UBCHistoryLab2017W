WE most heartily endorse what
Pres McKinley says in his message
to congress about good roads A
plan has already tjeen submitted to
Secy Wilson and indorsed by him
that will help greatly in the educa
tion of the people on this vital
subject The plan is to build a
quarter of a mile of model road in
four parts of each state during next
year to be paid for by the Federal
Government Pres W H Moore
of the National Good Roads and
Irrigation Congress has drafted a
bill for this purpose and is asking a
propriation of 150000 to carry on
the work Mi Stuyvesant Fish
Pres of the Illinois Central railroad
has written a letter to Mr Moore
in which he snysI do not know
much about irrigation but I do
know that the absence of good roads
is costing thepeople of this county
annually about as much as
they pay for all the freight trans
ported by all the railroads Now
