COTTON CKOWEKV CONVENTION.
The American Colton Growers'
Protective Association, through Its
President, Hector D. Lane, has called
a meeting to bo held in Memphis,
Tenn., on Mouday, December 30. The
Sentinel is requested to urge the
attendance ef a delegation from this
section, and feels inclined to do so,
for the business-like wording of the
call leads us to believe that some
thing may be done at this meeting to
improve the present cotton situation,
or at least a foundation laid for future
action in the premises.
The call for the convention is based
on the patent fact thut "cotton is too
low; there is a cause for this condition,
and it is the purpose of this conven
tion to find the cause and adopt the
course necessary to better the condi
tion."
The president of the Association
says further:
a
in
is
"It is the opinion of the best minds
of your country that this consumma
tion can only be reached by a resolute,
continuous and systematic iule of ac
I tion laid down by authorized represen
tation, and adhered to by the musses of
the cotton growers.
"I shall not waste space by in
dulging in arguments of the necessity
of this action. Five-cent cotton and
aturnl effect is its own most poteDt
I Je.ider in this cause, and the sounding
adjectives of the orator and the well
! rounded sentences of the journalist are
j not necessary to awaken the Soutli to
| the sad realization of our condition
and what is to follow without prompt
remedial action on these lines.
"The importance of the situation ad
dresses itself to our common country.
There is no one interested in the ma
j teria! prosperity in the South who
will not have to bear their pro rata of |
this burden.
"Upon the* part of the

i
'American

' tion," I appeal to the peeple to join us
in a patriotic, systematic and con
j servulive effort to combat these ills

A aOTCRXOI'4 WORK.
Under the able administration of
Gov. O'Perrall, Virginia has made a
record in the past four years of which
any State might well feel proud. The
Governor submitted bis final menage
to the Legislature which met in that
State last week, and a summing up of
the work of the retiring administration
showed the important reforms effected,
among which were:
"The destruction of gambling saloons
that had been Haunting their brazen
fronts and sneering at moral sentiment
and bidding defiance to lawful authority
for years.
"The stamping out of horse-race
gambling and prize fighting, which
were bringing reproach upon the Com
monwealth.
"The capture and extradition of
nearly every fugitive from justice.
"The entire exemption of Vlrginlain
the years of 1894 and 1895 from mob vio
lence of every discretion and the trials
of all offenders by courts and juries.
"The reduction of the number oi
lynchings during his administration
from an average of about nine every
two years from 1880 to 1894 to three
during his term of four years."
There were numerous other com
mendable results achieved by the ad
ministration, but the above are noted
to show what a determined and fearless
Executive can accomplish when he has
the interest of his State deeply at heart.
Gov. O'Ferrall has made a brilliant
record as Governor of Virginia, and
his work has been observed and com
mended by the whole nation.
Hon. Ju. €. Longstreet.
It is published that Hon. B. T. Kim
brough, of the third chancery district,
is not an applicant for reappointment.
Chancellor Kimbrough has adorned
the ermine. He possesses an enviable
reputation, both as a citizen and law
yer. The press of the district is teem
ing with praise of his administration.
There are a number of applicants for
tho succession. The friends of Hon. J.
C. Longstreet, of Grenada, are urging
his appointment. It ought to be con
sidered a privilege by any Governor to
have such material as Mr. Longstreet
from which to select judicial officers.
The name of this gentleman is a eulogy
within itself. Brilliant, handsome,
popular, learned in the law, just in all
things, and full of magnetism, his ap
pointment would be hailed with delight,
not only by the people of his district,
but by troops of friends all over the
State. He measures up to the true
height of legal greatness. He would
be an honor eyen to the supreme
bench. The Third district is composed
of Benton, Calhoun, DeSoto, Grenada,
Lafayette, Marshall, Montgomery.

There is no other way to

and good labor, and the crop won't pay
expenses. Now, as the practical
farmer can not afford lo waste time
testing seeds to find out whether they
are true to name, sound and clean, it
stands to reason that the only safe way
to buy seeds is to seek the protection
of a name that has stood for reliability

Dear Sir:—It may be of interest to
your policy holders, as well as of
service to you, for mo to slate that
some years ago 1 took a poliey in your
Company, on the Free Tontine plan,
for Five Thousand Dollars, which
policy was paid up in full, by its terms,
last December. The results of this
policy were quite satisfactory to me,
as I wrote you at the time. In addition
to the policy i^hove referred to, I have
another paid-up poliey for fifteen hun
dred Dollars. A year or two ago I se
cured another for Two Thousand Dol
lars, and while at home in Oxford
some days ago I made application for
#2,500.00 additional, making a total in
surance of Eleven Thousand (#11,000.00)
Dollars which 1 am currying in the
Equitable.
It is hardly necessary for mo to add.
after having written the above, that I
have entire faith in the stability and
wise management of your Company,
and you are at liberty to refer anyone
to me concerning oither the Company,
or yourself as Manager of the Equitable
Agency. With regards, I am,
Very truly yours,
