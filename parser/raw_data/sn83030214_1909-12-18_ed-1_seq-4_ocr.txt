Pole.
At an early hour this noraißS <^r">oir.
Osbon's new plan for settling the North
Pole affair had not been carried out—
that in spite of the fact that Mr. Lightfoot.
Mid by the <.aptain t.-> n»v.< first made the
offer to repudiate, had meantime offered to
make an affldailt of bis own that Captain
Oabon was wrong.
LIGHTFOOT S VERSION. .
George A. i-ightfoot told his story to the
reporters in the office of '.he Lightfoot Gold
Dredging Oesßpany. at No. r>2 Broadway.
"I thought Lossbj would repudiate hi?
affidavit." he said, 'if it t was false, for I
kn'v }.<• wa« "broke." He came into my
office one riav with just four cents, and
from what re said 1 fudai he was reaOy
to repudiate. Ha paid that, whatever 'The
Times' may have paM for lac affidavit, he
pot none of it.
"Later he went up:o«r. to see 'The Times*
•nd ask for the money to take him to
Copenhagen. I untlcrstotH that if l;e did
net fcft the money from them be would
jrobably be MUlnc to repudiate the afh'da
vit. As he did not return. I wrote him the
letter printed in the morning paper*.
"A reporter for 'The Evening Mali' came
to me and said his paper would pay IM9 for
the rsßNsMatisn But Uooas stuck to his
story, saying that his affidavit was true. I
never toM Captain Osbon that I had a
check for $.-'•• 1o pay I^oose, or that I h»'l
any check ■ f any kln'l. I'll make an nffi
davit tr- that if y.i j want it."
TOO HIGH. SAYS "M.MU"
Tht city eJitnr of "The Evening ilail"
told a fomewhat different story.
"On the <3ay in Bveatton." he said, "Mr.
Lightfoot called m<- up m the telephone
and *afd that Dunkle had gone to 'The
Times' off! pradioally to demand, as I
understood it. that they pay him to refrain
from going back on the affidavit he had
made for that paper. I^ghtfoot's words
were, as i remember them: 'I feel sure
that If •'The Times" don't pay them they
w!'l be ready to talk with >ou.'
"I bent a raportar to see Mi. Ughtfoot.
The man returned and 6aiO they wanted
%-Ant for th< repudiation. 1 told him that
tiiat was aMocether too much money, that
from tha nature of the case the first affi
davit « aft aouUl on Itself, and that to pay
any mj-Ii Jin for discrediting turh a story
wouJd l»e absurd. People are j-ick of the
w hole mess, and I took little Interest In
ti <- offer."
"Lightfoot told me," said Captain Osbon,
"tliat Loose was going to make a confe^
*i«»n; that he had a fctenoßraiilif-r to take
It down and a notary in tbe next room to
take I Is oath on It. And. \vl: it's more, h°

have been plumb crazy to have gone back

Washington. Dec. 17.— The continued at
tacks on Secretary Balllnger, and over his
fchoulders on the administration, are the
occanion of grave anxiety to the members
Of President Taffs Cabinet, many of whom
see in them additional evidence of the
movement to discredit the Taft adminis
tration and bring about a situation which
might compel the nomination of Mr. Roose
velt in 1312. The members of the Cabinet
deeme.l the evidences of the existence of
such a movement of sufficient importance
to lay them before the President on his re
turn from his Western trip, as was told In
these dispatches at that time, and events
have served only to confirm the opinion
they then entertained. President Taft. who
supposed his exoneration of Secretary Bal-
Unger. made public last September, would
mi an end to the whole controversy and
prevent further publication of such charges,
has grown so FenMtlve on the subject that
few members of the Cabinet care to risk
his displeasure by bringing It to his at
tention. Mr. Taft refuses to read a.l news
paper and magazine articles on the subject,
dismisses everything dealing with the polit
ical end of his administration with impa
tience, and his advisers are forced to the
conclusion that he has little idea of the
extent or far-reaching influence of the con
troversy. . ,
The latest changes against Secretary Bal
linger. in so far as they are charges, can
easily b» disproved, although the simplest
liMtiasi requires many words of explanation,
pud such explanations make dry reading.
In the main, however, there are no <leflnlt«
charge, s'mp'y a series of statements
placed in such connection as clearly to con
vey an iden without stating a fact. This
style of apparently succinct statements
nislrrs Interesting reading, effectively con
\•.. r the implication and obviates asser
tions which would be distinctly libellous.
For Instance, these sentences follow each
ether "Alexander McKensJe, of N<>rt:,
Dakota, was the captain of this filibustering
enterprise. I'onald K. McKen/.ie Is on>- of
the chief conspirators in the present at
tempted steal." The implication is clear
that the two IfcKanzles are It; pome w;i\
rrlated, although that statement is nut
rr.ide. As a .matter of fa ft, they are not
related either a« kindred or In business.
Many other statements of like character
rrigtit be cited.
Advices from Vice-Consul Caldera, at
Managua, that rioting and 'violence are in
creaslng in the Nlcarapuan capital, that
Zelaya's supporters are armed with knives
and revolver? and that a number of
Americans have appealed to the legation
for protection have been followed by in
structions ' to Admiral Kimball to proceed
to Corinto with seven hundred marines, to
Mr. Caldera and other consular representa
tives of this country to communicate di
rectly with the commanders of American
Fhlps In case, of need, and to those com
manders to take all measures necessary for
the protection of American interests. It is
expected, therefore, that early advices from
Xicaraeua Will tell of the landing of Amer
ican armed forces on Nicaraguan soil. No
Importance whatever is attached to Ze
laya's communication to President Taft
quoting a message lie says he seiit on De
cember 4. to his special emissary, Gonzales.
No such messaee was received by the Pres
ident or by Secretary Knox. and grave
doubt Is entertained regarding the truthful
ness of Zelayas latest communication.
Be«or Creel presented his credentials to
President Taft to-day. but no information
reearding the purport of his conversation
with the Executive was given.
The Committee on Paciflr Islands and
Porto Rico, of which Senator Depew Is
chairman, gave an extended hearing to
day to the members of the reformers" con
clave, who seek the enactment of a law
prohibiting the sale of Intoxicating liquors
In Hawaii. John <». Woolley. of the Anti-
Saloon l,en>;iie of Hawaii, described the
popular Hawaiian drink, 'dago red." which
delectable beverage is composed of i ologne
spirits and red wine It sells at whole
sale for IS cents and at retail for fin cents
a gallon. Mr. Woolley de. lured that a gal
lon was sufficient to keep two families
drunk for two days. At cording to Iff!
Woolley, the sale of liquor to the common
people was prohibited under royal rule in
t] c is'ar.d. but since its annexation to the
T'nlted States the liquor interests "exer
full BWing." He insisted, moreover,
that a prohibition law was necessary to
make the anti-canteen law effective so far

command wide newspaper publicity. There
are always too few Senators of that type
to meet the demand, and a superabundance
of those who neglect committee duties and
hard work arid devote their time to tlie
sensational and the spectacular with the
hope of Raining personal advertising. Sen
ator Flint says he should have devoted
more years to accumulating a fortune,
having done which he could have served
in the Senate as long as his state dcsi r ed.
Congress has lost some of Its most valua
ble members because they entered public
life too soon, and were later obliged to
recoup their personal resources, of which
tlere lies been no more striking illustra
tion than that of Senator John C. Bpooni r,
who was compelled to resume the, practice
of law at n time when lit* services to the
nation were valuable beyond estimation.

further fact that conditions are such that
the man with high ideals and without an
Independent and considerable fortune can
not be happy In the Inited States Senate.

POLITICIAN IN FEAR OF DEATH.
W. F. Lynan Tells Brooklyn Coroner
of Mysterious Assault.
Fearing that he was likely to (Iron dead

day paid a visit to Coroner Brewer, of

litical ally of Martin P. t only, from whom
John J. Bridges wrested the Democratic
control of the 2d Assembly District of
Kings County. Being out of the city it
the last primaries Lynan did not vote, and
tie Conlyites imagined that he had voted
against thi'lr leader.
On the night in question, according to
Lynan, he was assaulted by several men.
The following Sunday he v« nt to St.

doctors did not seem ablo to tind the trou

Do You Know What
An Excellent PIANO
$195 Will Buy? .*
And FIRST PAYMENT Need Not
Be Made Until February First
•J Tins is a piano that any family may be proud to own, refined and beautiful in
architectural construction and finish. It is a piano so excellent in tone and action that
ii is constantly being commended by music teachers, who tell us that it is radically dif
ferent in character from the usual instrument sold at $200.
«jj So one is more discouraged than the musk teacher if the piano tone is not right; for
the teacher, more than anyone else, realizes how important it is that the students ear
should he trained to be familiar with true musical tone.
«I In securing such a piano as the J. C. CAMBELL to he sold at *I!>s we believe
we made one of the achievements of this great WWAMAKKR Piano Business, and
protected the public against the necessity of resorting to an instrument of imperfect
tone and action, when a low price was to be paid.
q We shall be glad to have the J. C. (A MBELL critically compared with any other
piano that can be bought for any less than $250.
*I Demonstration at your convenience, in our piano salons.

Gompers s Viexc.i on Drastic
Measu re in A ustralia.
Sydney. N. 8. W., Dec. 17.— Business h»*
l)»en so demoralised by the coal strike that
the legislature took the drastic step to-day
of passing a bill rendering both strike lead
ers and employers who Instigate or aid a
strike, or lockout liable to a year's Impris
onment.
Washington, Dec. 17.— Samuel Gompersi
president of the American Federation of
Labor, pointed out to-day the failure of
compulsory arbitration In New Bsfjsjnd to
prevent strikes, with the accompanying
Inference that laws making arbitration
compulsory In the United states would not
operate differ-ntly. He said to-day:
When New Zealand and New South
Wales adopted their compulsory arbitration
laws, faddists declared that strikes would
not again occur in those countries. Observ
ing men said that the lawsSvould be Inef
fective and abortive, and no • they have
proved themselves. Compulsory arbitration
which compels employers to pay higher
wages than they think they can affoid and
enforces that award by the power of gov
ernment results In confiscation of prop
erty. Compulsory arbitration which awards
a lower wage and imposes conditions upon
workmen repugnant ti» them and enforces
it by the power of . government, -establishes
involuntary servitude— slaver r. :•
The attempt in the New >So"uth Wales
legislature to send men to pTVson for en
gaging in or encouraging a strike- will
prove equally abortive to their first at
tempts at compulsory arbitration. :As lons
as the workers have aspiration's foe a bet
ter life and concept of the rights which are
Justly theirs, they will unite and continue
their efforts for their attainment. When
they cannot be secured, without a strike
they will have no hesitancy In. striking, Jail
or no jail. :• • <*< ■•« : >. . •'■;■•■. \

CUBA WOULD BUY ARMS.
General Bell Recommends Sale of Ten
Thousand Stand.
Washington. Dec. ' 17.— "The commanding
general of the Cuban regular army Is ready
to come to the United States to buy these
arms In case Congress authorizes the sale,"
said Major General Bell, chief of staff of
the army. In discussing army guns before
the House Committee on Military Affairs
to-day. The committee, however, has ig
nored the Cuban desire to get supplies from
this country and has made no provision for
them In the army appropriation bill which
has been reported to the House.
General Bell told the committee that h«
had recommended to the Secretary of War
that, rather than pee Cuba forced to go
to Kurone to huv these arms, "we ask an
amendment authorizing the sals of not
exceeding 10,000 stand of arms to Cuba.
They could buy ammunition for those guns
from Atnerlrnn manufacturers,' 1 he added.
"We have h.id considerable correspondence
with the Cuban authorities."

BENXET'S NEW BILL
Drastic Measure Aimed at
"White Slave" Traffic.
[From Th« Tribune Bur»au '
Washington. Dec. 17.— A "white, slave"
bill which Is admittedly one of the most
comprehensive and drastic measures ever
puhmitteri to a parliamentary body has been
' favorably reported by the House Commit- ,
tee on Immigration and Is on th» calendar
ready for immediate consideration. It covers
every possible phase of the evil, and. In the
opinion of the committee. Is not open t<>
any constitutional objection.
In explaining the scope of the measure, j
which Is laritelv his own work. Representa
tive Bennet. of New York, said to-day:
The bill adds to the excluded classes all
persons supported by or receiving th*
proceeds from prostitution. In providing
against the offence of harboring aliens for ,
Immoral purposes the phraseology of th«
law Is modified by the words "In pursu
ance) of such Illegal Importation." co as to
relate- to the offence of harboring* to th«
offence, of Importation. This Is to meet
th« constitutional objection sustained hv
the Supreme Court In the Kellor case, in i
hlch the court decided that a man could j
not be punished whose sol* offence was I
harboring a prostitute By connecting
harboring with the hnportation of these
aliens the law will reach all offender* '
Among the new features of the bill are |
the sections making It possible to deport
aliens found in or connected with the man
agement of houses of prostitution, or any i
alien receiving benefit from the earnings j
of prostitutes or who receives benefits ]
from a music or dance hall frequented by
prostitutes A most Important regulation
is that relating to all persons, whether
naturalized or alien. It provides that any
person who buys a ticket for an alien to
transport her for Immoral purposes shall
bfl guilty of a felony and shall b* pun
ished by not more than ten years" impris
onment or $5,000 fine.
Another stringent provision is that which
makes competent the testimony of a wife
against her husband and vice versa.

Late Season Negotiations Bring These
Two Christmas Presents for Those Men
Who Waited Until Now to Buy Clothing
High-Grade Suits at $27.50
Lenigan Waistcoats, $4.75
Both allowed us as a kind of bonus for large
regular orders placed with the makers — one the king
of waistcoat makers, and the other the man who makes
our splendid lines of $35 and $45 suits.
The Suits are of fine worsteds— file famous Hockanum
and Globe cloths that set the standard of quality. They
are splendidly made, of course — the maker is not organized to
do any but the highest character of tailoring. At $27. 5 C, tnese
suits are nothing short of an opportunity — possible only because
the maker desired to dispose of his remaining Winter cloths and
because of the large regular orders with which we are able to
favor him through the season.
Lenigan, Waistcoat maker, made it possible for us to sell
these handsome waistcoats at $4.75. for identically the same rea
sons. They are made of wool cheviots, largely, in the unhack
nejsed patterns that this maker is noted for — mainly such as will
appeal to conservative business men. Style and cloths are both
correct without being conspicuous. The price is, of course, sev
eral degrees lower than men are accustomed to paying for waist
coats of equally high standing. Each in a holiday box. if desired,
Scarcely any question about all sizes being here, if you come
