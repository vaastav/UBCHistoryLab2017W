El Pasoans Now Working
Deposit In New Mexico
With Much Success.
Lu 1L Stiles, oil operator, and John
C. illUer, mining engineer, both of
HI Paso, are opening tip a mica, mine
13 Apache canyon In the Petaca dis
trict, Rio Arriba county. New Mexico.
It Is said to be the largest deposit in
tne rnlted States, If not In the world.
Messrs. Stiles and Miller state that
they have five parallel reins averag
ing fully four feet wide, which crop
out for at least half a mile and all
are covered by 16 claims. For 15
months they have been working
quietly on this property which they
acquired, by location and they say
they have mined 40,00 to 45,0M
pounds of "block" mica which la all
cleaned and stored, and from 150,090
to 175,000 pounds of cleaned scrap
mica. Some muscovite, the white
mica, has been shipped, and it Is said
to be comparable to that of East In
dia, which country and the United
States are the principal producers of
that mineral.
Mined In 1S52.
Desultory mica mining had been
done on this deposit as far back as
i52. by a Mexican named Sandoval,
w no tool: out some of the best qual
ity in the form of the largest and fin
est "books" of the clear white sheets,
and hauled It by wagon by way of
Santa Fe to Fort LearenT orth, Kan.
Now the property is only 12 miles
from La Madera, the saw mill station
of Halleck & Howard on the branch
road from Taos on the Denver & Rio
Grande railroad, downhill haul from
the mines 9300 feet above sea level.
The mica Is in plgmatlte fissure
-veins with a dip of 60 degrees be
tween granite and quartxite, accord
ing to Mr. Stiles.
Demand for Mien
"Mr. Miller located the claims, hav
ing had his attention attracted to
these old, abandoned mines by the de
mand for mica due principally to the
inability to import mica from India
during the war," said Mr. Stiles. "We
had it all to learn, for mica mining
15 so different from other kinds. He
worked It out there at the mines
tbile I went east visiting the mills
v. here the raw product is prepared
for the market. I also visited mica
irnes in North Carolina, which state
produces 60 per cent of tne output of
the United States. In that and other
southern states It costs J2M a ton
to produce mica and It Is not mined.
jut "gonhered out by the farmers
b hen farm work Is done. They will
rl ar their oren pits or cuts, find tsmall
deposits, often only 60 to 100 pounds.
Buyers will then come around and
buy it tm and when they have enough
ro just ifv it, send wagons to haul it t
to tne railroad.
Running- a TnnneL
"With us we start mining from
'grass roots Mr. Miller Is running a
tunnel along the foot wall and then
ne vein matter Is stripped carefully
frnm the hanging wall by gadding
and picking. We can stope and make
opra'ses and sink winzes more like
real mining. The work is done away
from the mineral, so to speak, for
fear of hitting and thereby Injuring
perhaps a fine "book of mica. When
ever mica dust rhows on a drill that
hole is abandoned. In the vein one
cannot tell when these 'books occur,
as they are irregular, being perpen
dicular, horizontal or at any angle.
We 'an mine comparatively cheaply,
whHe in the southern states It costs
cno a ton and in Canada $170.
REVIVAL OF MINING IN '

Preseott. Ariz, Dec. 14. There has
been & revival of the plans of the
Anglo-Saxon Smelting and Refining
company, which In 1915 secured a
grant of land from the city of Phoe

Geo. G. Lemons, bought some mines
and showed signs of good intention
till Its activities were stopped by the
war. Now Lemons has been succeeded
as manager by Geo. w. Klerstead, a
Kansas City contractor, who has been
celled to London to confer with the
financial backers of the enterprise.
Locally the company's interests are in
the hands of J. E. RusselL The grant
