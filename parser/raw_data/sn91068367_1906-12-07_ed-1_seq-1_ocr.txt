CONFERENCE NOTES PERSON A.L
ST ATI STI C AL.
The election of Rev. John N. Colo
to the superintendency of the Metho
dist Orphanage at Raleigh, some time
ago, takes out of the pastorate one
of the most active and earnest men
in the conference, as well as vacating
the presiding eldership of the Rocking
ham district Lets of interest centers
about this vacancy, as some man not
now a presiding elder -will be elevated
to take the work of traveling a district.
A change like that noted above often
means something like knocking down
"ten pins". Some member of the con
ference that has been holding down the
best stations or a presiding elders dis
trict drops out by death or otherwise
and some man who has not hitherto
held such places must of necessity
go up a step, and the selecting of ihat
man and filling his place often neces
sitates the TEJOvftng of quite a number
hence the interest that centeis and will
center about the supplying of the
places made vacant by the death of
Rev. John W. Jenkins and the election
of Dr. Cole to the orphanage work.
Another thing about. this session of
the conference that can now be talked
about and printed, legitimately, is the
fact that three of the other presiding
elders' time expires -'by limitation, and
they and the church in genera) know
they have got to move; and in as much
as the other five (not including Rock
ingham) presiding elders time has not
expired and they being from one tn
three year men, it becomes interesting
to know which vail be changed Rev.
W. H. Moore of the Raleigh district.
Ptev. J. T. Gibbs. of the Durham dis
trict, and Rsv. J. B. Hurley of Fayetts
ville district change from time limit
and to place them one or mere changes
in location of presiding elders will be
necessary
A similar situation obtains on tb?
present status of three station preacn
ers whose four years expire at this ses
sion, and these three must "walk the
plank" as St Avere, and in order to make
room for them seme men now in their
first, second, or third year must move,
as these three are the only station men
ia their fourth year. The men referred
to are Revs. L. E. Thompson, of Wash
ington, R C. Beaman, of Trinity, Dur
ham, and Rev. K. D. Holmes, Rox-
boro. The only other four year men
noted in looking at minutes are Rev.
D. L. Earnhardt, of Fremont circuit,
and one other, name not now recalled.
Thus one interested sees that the
session of the conference will be inter
estimr to the last hour, when the t-p-.jpointmjenfts
arte read in answei to
question. 46 ".Where are the preachers
stationed for the next year?"
SUCCESSORS TO SPENCER.
W. W. Finley, of Washington, Elected
President Southern Railway.
New York, Dec. 5. The directors of
the Southern railway today elevated
W. W. Finley, of Washington, presi
dent of the company to succeed the
late Samuel Spencer. Sir. Finley has
been second vice president of the road
since September 15, 1S9G. He has been
active in railway work since 1S75.
Prior to entering the Southern's
service, Sir. Finley was second vice
president of the Great Northern rail
way; before that he was third vice
president of the Southern rail w v. For
two years he was chairman of the
Southeastern Passenger, association at
Atlanta. Mr Finley was at times as
sociated with James J. Hill.
PRISON FOR
Sentence of Adams and Saw
yer Commuted.
BY PRESIDENT OFITHEU. Si
Decision Gives Almost Universal
Satisfaction Here.
Action of the President was An
nounced Yesterday Prisoners Had
Almost Given up Hope of any Furth
er Action Being Taken Short His
tory of the Notable Case and the
Earnest Efforts to Save the Lives or
the two 3Ien.
Washington, December 5. The presi
dent has commuted to life imprison
ment the sentence of death imposed
upon Arthur Adams and Robert Saw
yer, negro members of the crew of the
schooner Harry A. Berwind, who were
convicted of murder and mutiny aboard
that vessel about a year ago. The men
were tried at Wilmington, N. C, and
are now in jail at that place. Another
member of the crew who was convicted
on the same charge already has been
executed.
The few words in the above dispatch
received from Washington last night,
will be read . with universal interest
here, where the developments in the
Adams and Sawyer case have been
followed wfith increasing interest.
Those two (Timinals are now con
fined in the New Hanover county jail,
and they had almost despaired that any
action would be taken by the president
to prevent the carrying out ot the death
sentence, the date for execution bsing
set for December 15th, just a little
more than a week off. They had made
no complaints, but were waiting with
patience for the day of doom. Yt
through it all, they have not entirely
lost hope. They were kept advised of
the efforts being made to save their
lives and they awaited anxiously each
day for seme tidings of good news.
They have been unofficially informed
of the commutation of sentence and it
was plainly evident that the news came
as a great joy and relief to them.
Marshal Dockery will probably come
on to Wilmington within a few days,
and officially communicate to them the
president's action. They will then "ns
taken to some federal prison, probably
the one at Atlanta, and begin the life
sentence.
Since the confession made by Henry
Scott, on the gallows, when he was
executed here on July 6th last, in
which he completely exonerated Adams
and Sawyer of any complicity in the
Berwind tragedy, there has been a
w4de spread belief that the negroes
were not equally guilty with Scott and
that they did not deserve the death
sentence. It has been the almost gen
eral opinion that life imprisonment
would be the sentence that wa? more
just, and t get this change of sen
tence, strenuous and earnest efforts
have been made by some of the lead
ing citizens and members of the bas
of Wilmington.
The crime for which Scott, Adams
and Sawyer were convicted occurred on
October 10th, 1905. On November 7th,
jthat year, Adams and Sawye were
convicted and sentenced to be hanged
on January 26th, 1906. An appeal was
-taken 'and a stay of execution resulted
In the appeal, no error Was found by
the United States supreme court -and
the men were again sentenced to hang
on August 17th. 1906. On August 7th,
on account of the confession of Scott
and in order to allow time for the con
sideration of the case, the men were
respited until November 1st. On Octo
ber 13th. the presdent decided not to
interfere in the case and to allow the
execution to be carried out. However,
ten days later, on October 23rd. Rever
ends H. H. Barber of Fredericksburg,
Va., and Jas. Carmichael, of this city,
made a personal appeal in their behalf
to the president of the United States
and to the attorney general, this re
sulting cn the 26th, in another respite
until December loth, when the execu
tion was ordered to occur.
There were no f1 riher developments
until yesterday, when the commuuitioji
of sentence was ordered by the pres
ident. Dr. - Carmichael f Wilmington ha
taken deep interest in the case anil he
has exerted himself to prevent thf
hanging. Geo. L .. Peschau, Esq., t
torney for the condemned men has also
worked diligently and faithfully in
their behalf and tn president's actio!
must b? a rcuic . f very great p ea
lire and satisfaction to him.
Oth?:s. too, hav taken a deep in

Washington, December 5. The reso
lutions relative to the discharge of the
negro troops of the 25th infantry were
called up in the senate today by Sen
atr Foraker, of Ohio, who proposed
the adoption of his resolution which
calls on the secretary of war for intor
mation as a substitute for that of
Senator Penrose, calling on the presi
dent. Senator Warren of Wyoming, offered
a substitute for both which was ad
dressed to the president. To this sug
gestion Mr. Foraker was opposed. The
information he desired was, he said,
ia the possession of the war department
and could be secured there without
difficulty.
Mr. Foraker asked that his reso
lution be considered independently and
not as a substitute to the Penrose
resolution.
The vice president ruled that as the
resolution had been amended its status
was changed and an objection from
any isenator would carry the resolution
over one day. Mr. Knox made this
objection.
Mr. Foraker then secured unanimous
consent to amend his resolution and
followed this step with a motion for
immediate consideration Senator Cul
berson offered an amendment to the
Foraker resolution calling in addition
for the order issued to Major Penrose,
in command of the 25th infantry, di
recting him not to delivel to civil au
thorities of Texas certain members of
his command charged with assault, to
murder. Thi3 was accepted by Mr.
Foraker. Senator Spooner called at
tention to the fact that Senator Penrcs3
was absent from the city and it was.
unusual to pres matters in which a
senator was espesially interested in
his absence.
Mr. Foraker at onca accepted this
view and the whole question went over
until tomorrow.
Notice was given that Senator Mor
gan would tomorrow address the senate
on a resolution introduced today by
his colleague, Senator Pectus, directing
the committee on interoceanic canals
to enquire what action of congress is
necessary "to bring the alleged cor
poration of the Panama railroad within
the direct control of the isthmian canal
commission."
The senate adopted a resolution call
ing on the secretary of commerce and

Richmond, Va., Dec. 5. Insurance
Commissioner Button today reported
to the state corporation cmirission
with a recommendation that their
liceises be revoked the German Na

and the German Insurance Company
of Freeport, Illinois. Both companies
have done an excellent business In
Virginia and each has deposited with
the state treasurer the $10,000 re
quired by law for the protection of
policyholders, but both sustained al
legedly overwhelming loss in the San

Button therefore feels constrained to
recommend the revocation of their

tation, addressed tiie board of agri
culture on immigration. He compli
mented very highly the exhibit made
at Boston and said be noped it would
consider In the broadest way the
whole question of securing the best
class of immigrants. He spoke of

every purpose, but 4i counties received
more from the state than thty pay in.
One of these is Cumberland, which re-
