Ardersok, Ird., Dec ft Last evening
John Martin, a farm band, retiding In tha

a terrlOo tuasto with a pair of wildcat. It
waa in tha duak of tbe evening, and Martin
waa passing; through a narrow strip of
timber. Ha wa walking alowly along tha
highway, whoa all of a audden ba wa
tartled y a shrill scream, end a cata
mount sprang from a low clump of bushe
into to miuslleof tbe road In front of him.
The animal wa unusually largo and
ferocious. Martin taw at once that
there waa to be a fight to a flu Ith,
and there wa a mortal dread as
to what tha remit might be. There waa
no time to be lost, for tbe cat was there for
business. She sprang, at tha man'a throat,
but received a whack with bis walking-
stick wblcb laid ber on ber back. Just at
this juncture tba mala cat appeared on tha
scene, jjorore Martin could recover hi
guard the male caught him by tbe ahoul-
dec a it leaped and raked him, tearing
action of hi coat and about alx inches of
skin and flesh Into ribbons. Fortunately
tba cat mined ita calculation! aa tha man
swung about with tbe weight of bia blow
upon tba flrat one. At it waa, the wound
wa very painful. By tblt time tha male
had got on It feet again, and both cata
prepared to aprlng at once. Martin, aee
ing that tha affair wa getting ser
ious, backed up against a tree and
awaited their onslaught H didn't
have long to wait, as the mala
snarling with rage, mad a leap at bis
throat, while tbe female crept to one side,
a If to flank blm. This fact saved the
man, as It gave him time to relieve tbe big-
gest one, which be skillfully did by jump
ing to tba right and striking it a it (truck
the tree where be bad just stood. Tba
mow knocked It senseless. The female
made a flying leap, but another quick
movement allowed ber to strike the base of
tba tree, where the man had stood. Ha
gave it one hard blow on the aide, but
(lipped and fell, when tbe cat buried her
teelb and clawa in bia leg. It was

Fourteen Hundred Dollars of Missing
Claverument Funds Traced to
Their Hiding Place.
Nashville, Tesr., Dec. 7. Several
Weeka ago a heavy shipment of silver wa
made from tha New Orleana Hint to th
Treasury Department at Washington.
When tbe boxea were opened by the Treas
ury officials it was discovered that MOO
ailver dollar bad been abatracted and
bag ot shot substituted. Tb robbery
wa communicated to tha autboritiea of
the mint and the Sonthem Express Com
pany, and Mr. iL C. Fisher, superintend
ent ot the latter, began a careful examina
tion ' at New Orteaus on tba l?th of No
vember. Ha traced the silver front
the mint to the time it was placed
on the train at New Orleans, Hi la
bor have teen crowned witb succes, tba
roblier having been discovered and the
missing money found in a trunk which
bad beeu checked to Bowling Ureen, Ky.
When Mr. Fisher entered upon tbe investi
gation he bad forwarded to him the bag
of shot that -bad been placed In tha box.
He went through tbe shot and found an
advertisement showing that the shot had
been made In October by Tatbam Bro., of
New York. Correspondence with Tatbam
Bros, developed the fact that they bad
made only two shipment of October bot
to the South. With this clctf Mr.
Fisher clearly ascertained who ob
tained the shot The evidence was o
conclusive that the robber, knowing
bis guilt would shortly be fully estab
lished, wrote Mr. Flatter, and, inclosing tbe
check for the trunk, told him that if ha
would take the check to Bowling Green,
get the trunk and open it be would discov
er the missing money. Mr. Fisher met th
man, who made a full confession. The
trunk, w hlch waa lying in the railroad of
fice at Bowling Green, was examined, and
wrapped up in a bed-quilt was found the
fourteen hundred silver dollars. Mr. Fish
er, in declining to give the name of the
guilty man, said he was not actuated
by a desire to save the reputation ot the
individual In question, but did not wish to
blast the lives of innocent women and
children. The robber, he said had com
mitted the theft nndsr circumstances that
would excite the sympathy of a stoic, and
bad already suffered as much aa if he bad
been consigned to hi prison and bis name
given to the world. Mr. Fithor telegraphed
to Mr. Montague, the Superintendent of
the Mint, that the money had been recov
ered, and taid that no person connected
with the Mint was in any way concerned
in the robbery.

whlcb the United Statet wa a party dur
ing the year, the Attorney-tieneral saye
that the usual examlnaton of peni
tentiaries In which United Statet pris
oners are confined was made during tbe

ed. He advocates the passage of tbo
bill now pending la Congress for the ap
pointment ot a commlssloa 'to Inquire -Into
the advisability of bu Idlng Government
penitentiaries and reformatories, and tayt:
"It would teem that the United Statet tbouhl

He recommends that a special appropriation
be made to pay special deputy marshals em
ployed during tbe recent electiona; that mar
shals be allowed Increased expenses In the

mentofthe Inter-State Commerce law; that
the salaries of the Examtnerof Calms in toe
