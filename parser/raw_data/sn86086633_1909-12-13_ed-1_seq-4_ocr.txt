naturally reassuring. Congress as yet
shows no signs of breaking out with
antagonistic legislation, although It Is
quite apparent that the radicals -were
disappointed at the conservative tenor
of president Taft'a message. Political
ly speaking, the situation Is hopeful,
for while It la evident that large cor
porations must prepare themselves
for more or less government regula
tion, and enforcement of the Sherman
anti-trust law In Its present drastic
form may cause some disquiet, still the
outlook in these directions is les
threatening than during the sometimes
unwisely aggressive policy of the prev

Our railroad situation Is not without

That the companies should have to
face a demand for higher wages at this
time is unfortunate, for they have
scarcely more than recovered from the.
efl'eits of the panic. Wages were not
reduced at that period aud labor suf
fered little from this disaster. It if
true that the cost of living has risen.

railroads. If obliged to coined.' to lat

than advancing the rates and compell

sons such as these railroad stocks and
bonds have been comparatively neg

properties are still finding It difficult
to distribute their surplus holdings.

TEACHING HOW TO SWINDLE.
The newspaper has on more than
one occasion expressed its opinion of
the evil fleets likely to lollow I no ex-
loitatioii by magazines in semi-lle-
tiotial form of the m.-tho.ls or sw mo
uld sharpers," says the Chicago
Tribune, and its comments upon this
theme are particularly wholesome. Tho
Tribune says: "One publication ran
riallv for several months a cleverly
written account of how a confidence
man robbed merchants and small cap
italists throughout the country. Whe
ther the recital was rewritten from fact
r was the product of the author's fer
tile imagination, it could not but havo
somo bad effect. : The. ' varhd conll-i

dubious hero w ere just' of the sort toi

log their living at the expense of otfi-
As an example of this a swindler
thine, Is a much more harmful thing
than appears upon its face."
! CHRISTMAS GIFTS WHICH MAY BE MADE AT
Now that the weather man has giv
en a touch of real Christina weather
and you are beginning to give Uwr
attention to your Christmas shopping,
why not make up your mind to give a
little Christmas present to your home
city and boost for Calumet by making
your purchasea of the local merchants?
This imposes no hardship on you. It Is
n aacrillce. for you can get as good
quality and aa good prices from local
merchants as from any others. Spend
your money lure and It stays here. It
helps out the general prosperity. In
directly It rebounds to your advantage.
You are adding to Calumet cheer. And
It is no excuse to wait until a day or
o before Christinas, when all ho
stocks have been looked over, and find
fault with tile merchants because they
don't happen to have Just what you
want. Look the goods over now.
