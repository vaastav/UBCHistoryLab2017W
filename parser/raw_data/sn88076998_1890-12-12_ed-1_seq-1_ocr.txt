W a
Congeessman Hansbrough has in
traduced a bill for an appropriation
of £500,000 to distribute among the
farmers of North Dakota who have
lost their crops by drought.
The President's message is not a
sky-rocket production. It's just a
plain, every day, common-sense
statement of the
of the government,* and of
o-ir most pressing needs, in a. legis
lative way. And judging from the
W the senate has buckled down to
jrk on its principal recommend
ation—the federal election bill—it
must have struck the right spot.
Poor old Cleveland He has re
ceived a harder blow below the belt
from the national convention of the
Farmers Alliance that has yet been
admimistered to him. The Alliance
people say that Cleveland's financial
opinions are such that they will not
under any circumstances support
him for the presidency. This is sig
nificant, and will undoubtedly have
considerable effect upon the next
democratic national convention.
However that's a good ways off and
Mr. Cleveland may change his finan
cia views before then.
The Indian excitement seems to
be gradually dying out. The United
States government has so effectively
surrounded the Indians with troops
that it is hardly likely that a war will
be the outcome. The trouble with
the Indians seems to be the want of
more rations, and the government
has responded to this request and
issued extra rations. A bill has been
introduced in congress to make an ap
propriation of $100,000 for addition
al rations for the Indians. Now if
the government will only furnish
each Indian with a fine coonskin
coat, plug hat and a hemp necktie,
the country would probably think
that the right thing was being done
by the noble red man.

President Sprague, of the Grand
Forks University, announces himself
as a candidate for United States sen
ator, but says, "to get it I can engage
in no scramble, no intrigue, no bar
gain, no fight, shall neglect no pres
ent duty, make no speeches, curry
no favor, solicit no votes, pull
no wires, promise no offices, pay no
money, fling no mud, and tell no lies.
I am not for sale." Mr. Sprague
can sleep peacefully, the senatorial
toga won't come his way. The per
son elected senator by the coming
legislature will have to pull wires and
pull them hard.

FRIDAY. DECEMBER 13,1 S»0
The United States senate could
not do a more popular thing than to
take up and pass Senator Cullum's
bill for one cent postage. This is
one of the few things that every
body favors.
Honest Dave Wellman has served
notice of contest for the senatorship
in his district against Hen. J.M. Patch
senator elect. Mr Wellman will
think his opponent too large a Patch
lor him to coser. up. before he is:
through with the deal and will feel
anything bat a Well-nfan.1

Speaking of North Dakota coal,
the Jamestown Alert in commenting
upon the annual report from the
Asylum, says that at least one-third
the expense has been saved by using
this coal. Two years ago the coal
item was $
16.000 and the amount
last year was about $11,000. This
is a good showing in favor of the
ignite.
The President is neither a craw
fish nor a clam he will not go back-
ou*
a
a a
intermission until a decisive
victory shall be won. If there be
any men in the ranks who are
opposed to fighting they will do well
to get to the rear immediately.
The coming state legislature is
purely a farmers body. There are
only four lawyers elected. We hope
the farmers will now do the right
thing and give us some good legis
lation and not come home and kick
a'3°ut l'ie
-legislature being run by
monopolists. To be sure there are
three editors elected, but there are
enough farmers to sit on them, so
that there is no danger of them do
ing any serious damage.
Major Edwards takes great pride
in showing up the big crop of the
Red River Valley and ridicules Con
gressman Hansbrough for introduc
ing his joint resolution to provide
seed wheat for farmers who are des
titute. The Major is all right as far
the Red River Valley is concerned,
unfortunately there are several coun
ties that are not located in that said
fertile valley, that will certainly need
some help. We could mention a
number of spots in our growing
young commonwealth that could
stand a lift of that sort. Hansbrough
is all right and is no fool.
No 1 Vol. of the Sanborn Enter
prise comes to us on the quarter
shell so to speak. A series ot break
downs on the part of the press was
the cause of the cut in size. Sanborn
is not a very profitable place to pub
lish a paper, probably that is the
reason that Editor McKean does
not feel like going to more expense
in the matter of presses. Mc., if you
get stuck again, ship your forms up
here, and the COURIER will run
out your paper for you—any favor
we can do, you only have to ask it.
The county reports in the Argus
last Sunday show that in the entire
state of North Dakota there was
122,390 sheep at the time the assess
ment was taken last spring. It is
safe to estimate that the natural in
crease since then reaches 100,000.
Besides the above it has been esti
mated- by those who are believed to
be in a position to know, that
150,000
sheep have been purchased by the
farmers of North Dakata during the
summer and fall. This makes a
total of 372,000 sheep in the' state
at present, which, at average of eight
pound wer head would produce a
wool clip next spring of 2,976,000
pounds and this at twenty cents a
pound would bring the farmers of
North Dakota $595,200, which
seems quite an important amount
for an infant industry.

The inaugural ball in honor
t,f
Governor-elect A. H. Burke,
will take place at the
capitol, Bismarck, January 7 th, 1891.
It will be one of the grandest affairs
of the kind ever given in the state.
There are twelve counties in Ne
braska that have an almost total
failure of crop, and 10.000 families
are in need of assistance. North
Dakota is not in that shape even if
she has been stricken with drouth
the past year or two.
The immediate result of the pass
ing of the McKihley act has been
the announcement that the eminent
firm of Lister has determined to es
tablish a factory in America. Why?
Because the prohibitory du
imposed by the new act compel it
that—which means to employ Ameri
can labor instead of English labor
or lose all its American business.
Other great English firms have no
waited for the McKinley tariff ao to
demons'rate to them the latest ad
vantages of one-sided free trai e.
When one finds an Armstrong esl.i
