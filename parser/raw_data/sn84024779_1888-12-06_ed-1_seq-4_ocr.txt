It is thought that Catholic bishop
for North Dakota will be appointed,
now, before a great while.
George Washington was first in
augurated March fourth, 178!.
Harrison will be inaugurated March

president.
Young Blaine having deserted his

The sugar trust has just shut
down two of the largest refineries
in the United States, throwing 700
men out of employment at the be
ginning of winter, all for the pur
pose of decreasing the supply and
maintaining present prices. This
is made possible by the two cents
per pound tariff.
The latest reports indicate that
President Cleveland's plurality on
the popular vote is 100,000. The ulna
of voting for president by states and
-voting for United States senators
through legislatures, is a good deal
of a farce, the latter especially. The
laws ought to be changed and the
voting done directly for tlie candi
dates.
It is said that one illustration of
the
way "trusts" work is furnished
by the great oat meal mill at Daven
port, Iowa, the propi ietors of which
are paid $18,000 a year to keep it
idle. Hut then this is a "private
affair," according to lilaine.and the
consumers of meal who pay lliis
large sum are not concerned in the
matter.
Coal is sold at extortionate prices
in the northwest, and yet seven
thousand poor miners have just
been thrown out of their pittance
in the shape of employment along
the Monongahcla river, that the
monopolists may enjoy the full
fruits of this important deposit
which God Almighty has placed in
the earth for the benefit of his whole
people.
President Cleveland delivered his
last message to congress, Monday of
this week, and he gives the country
the plainest talk it ever got on the
subject of the usurpation of the
money power. The president is
unquestionably on the side of the
people as against the money power,
and time will justify, he says, the
people's cause. It is a great mes
sage, and we will publish same next
week.
(4 It is said that in lOtil a Jesuit
priest in Massachusetts, while com
piling the bible into the Algonquin
Indian language, consulted an old
parishioner as to a proper transla
tion of these words, viz: "Xot to
think more highly of himself than
he ought to think,"' was at once ad
vised to use the word "mugwump."
From that time 011 the word has
been occasionally applied to men in
New England, taking prominent
shape in the campaign four years
ago.

One of the greatest trusts forming
in this country is the dressed meat
trust of Chicago, headed by Armour,
Swift, Morris and others. The com
bination now has the meat trade so
completely under their control that
they arc enabled to dictate what
shall be paid for live stock and
what dressed meats shall bring in
the markets of this country. One
instance of their method is now seen
at Finley, Ohio, where the Chicago
pool had men doing a meal, trade,
getting into a fight with local deal
ers at once got instructions from
headquarters to put the price of
dressed meats down from !0 to 50
per cent., and that unless the local
dealers complied with their wishes,
and that was to buy meats of- the
latter, to freeze them out of
the business, with the implica
tion of course, that when the
local dealers were used up, the
corporation would restore the old
retail prices. Yet, the pompous re
publican bosses assure us that these
trusts and combines, building up
huge corners on the necessaries of
life, are merely private affairs with
which the general public lias no con

the virtuous Republican monopolist
and boss hands out a stone, and at
the same moment descants in 11
loud tone upon some feature of the
bloody shirt and a solid south.

[Fargo Republican.
We would be pleased to see Col.
l'lnmmer gain a good position un
der the administration. Fie is not
only a whole sou led. good hearted
and able man but he has earned a
lucrative position, if he wants it.
Hut when the colonel says we shall
hear no more about "free trade" in
this country he makes a rather
startling statement. We doubt the
republicans'ability to reform in the
matter of speech. There is little
hope for them, especially when it is
claimed they will cry "free trade"'
110
more. Such reformation is un
expected. We rather expect they
will keep up the absurd bloody shirt
refrain and the silly free trade scare
just as long as the people persist in
listening to them, as was done in
the late campaign, with the hope
that the former may continue to
vote to the republican bosses that
political patronage and the manipu
lation of the commercial affairs of the
American people, the like of which
the world has never before seen.
These are ilush times with the mo
nopolist boodlers, and that they will
not undertake to keep the thing
going as they gained the last vict ory,
is incredible.
"Blocks of Five."
W Yowk, Nov. 28.-—The World
this morning publishes an interview
it had with Senator McDonald, of
Indianapolis, last night at the Fifth
Avenue hotel. The senator said
that he believed Mr. Dudley wrote
the "Blocksof Five" letter and that
he will lie arrestedas soon as he enters
Indiana. Fully $1,000,000 was nsed
in Indiana for illegitimate purposes
and the openness of the bribery was
something unprecedented. The
democrats of Indianapolis will make
a strong effort to convict. Dudley.
"There is no doubt of his guilt.
The first, paragraph of the letter is
evidence of the criminal intent of
the author. His offense is against
the federal law and not the state
law, and the prosecuting attorney is,

Mr. Donnelly is to have some good
appointment. Che la-publican party tjW! adjournment of the house
The other day Conklin's Dakotaian
ot Watertovvn called attention to
the fact-that some of the millers
ot South Dakota were moving
in the interest of a territorial or
state trust to control the price of
Hour, deprecating the idea of trusts
when the Yankton Dakotaian hop
ped on to Conk I in with both feet,
declining tljat the Dakota millers
had to coinbi-ne to hold their own
against the' Minneapolis millers'
trust. N'ow. if this "spat" shows
anything it is a strengthening of the
idea that the cwinnercial affairs of
this country are Jtjeing usurped or
"gobbled up" by gi%it-corporations,
and that the bravado of the Yank
ton sheet defeats itself. Trusts and
combines are just wlut Conklin un
dertook to rebuke, and that the
domineering, high sounding defense
of the Jilaiue doctrine, that trusts
are merely private affairs with
which the public has 110 concern,
constitutes a living issue and will
scarcely hold out for all time. The
people will surely get the better of
their prejudice after awhile.
Canada ami the Union.
The Republican bosses realizing
the shallowness of their great claims
about a "home market" and "pro
tection to American labor," are
turning their attention to the propo
sition of the consolidation of the
union tt^HfcCanada. It is notorious
that CaiiliJni under her present pro
tective laws is unable to hold out
against or compete in furnishing
homes with this country and herself
make any progress. She is of too
small commercial proportions, and
being unable to stand her present
strain of "protection to home in
dustry-' and a "home market," finds
her population melting away, na
tional debt and common hardships
ol her people multiplying upon
those who cannot get away, and it
is indeed conceded that she must,
make a shift for the better and that
is, ultimate union with the United
States. This would undoubtedly at
once afford Canada relief, and it
might cause a loosening up in com
mercial circles of this country, for
some features of our gorged "marts
might find relief in supplying that
Section which has been held: aloof
bv means of Canada's retaliatory
protective laws, passed a dozen or
fifteen years since. The lesson,
then, the present aspect of affairs
teach is that so-called protection
does not save Canada unto herself—
to a government of her own and
that it she should agree to consoli
date with the union- ami England
should admit of such a thing--it
would be just contrary to what, the
people iiiere have always advocated,
would he a matter of commercial
expediency and not or.e of narrow
bounds hampered by high protection.
We think the people of this country
would, under consolidation, have no
cause for apprehension of complica
tion, everything would move, on se
lenely. the acquisition being more
apt to lean toward conservatism
among the people than toward the
present tendencies of centralized
power. One would have as much
hope in the new territory i,"i"g
right on great popular questions
as
can now be hail of faith in the cen
tral and western states,
who
seemed
to lose their head in the late con
test, or at Jeast failed to conie to
their senses: the bloody shirt and a
solid south might not so worry the
new territory as it seems to worry
sections of the middle ground.
In truth this prospective consol
idation which so savors of destiny
does not carry out the idea that
narrowness and contraction
source of wealth, but leans
toward the breaking down of imagi
nary walls and lines, affording a
wider range to commercial affairs,
and it is in the Democratic faith to
allow these things to come to pass.

the title of all bona fide settlers under

WASUISUTOX, Dec. (5.—At the conclu

the tariff bill was taken up and read bv
sections for amendment. Senator Harris
said that to test the sense of the senate
he would move to lay the finance com
mittee's amendment to the house bill on

called for a vote was taken with the re
sult that the senate refused to lay the
finan.ee committee's substitute on the
table—yeas 19, nays 26. The division
was on party lines.
The substitute was then read by sec
tions for amendments, and thirty pages
of the bill were disposed of.
Senator Dawes introduced and the sen

secretary of the interior for information
concerning the alleged outrages on In

the action, if any, taken by the depart
ment to protect the persons of females in
Alaska from outrage, violence and re
straint of liberty. Mr. Dawes said that
lie had 110 other information on the sub

prints, but that if these stories were true
and the department of the interior had
adopted no measure to correct the r&t
rages. the matter was a great public
