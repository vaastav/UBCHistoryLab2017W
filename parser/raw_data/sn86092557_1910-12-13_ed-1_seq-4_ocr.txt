HOW TO PREPARE PACKAGES.
In order to minimize the number of
packages (lost during the coming holiday
season by the express companies
the public has been asked to observe
a number of very simple suggestions.
If these are followed by the patrons
of the express companies it will result
in an advantage all-around.
The instructions as to packing will
apply equaly to the preparation-of
mail as express packages and the carrying
out of these instructions will injure
the prompt delivery of gifts in
good condition.
. Here are some of the suggestions:
First?Ship your packages .early, by
the 18th of December If possible. The
express company, will give you a small
label to paste on. the package-.road|qg
"Don't' opeii" until* Chrjstmas.' Thlb
will insure .'"the .delivery ,*of the pa'okage
before Christmas and give the additional
pleasure to the recipient'of
having it on Christmas morning.
Second?Use wooden boxes for
packing. GIbsb. or fragile articles
should bo well,protected. It may cos:
a few cents more, but the danger ol
loss or damage is very much lessened,
True, if the shipment is lost or dam
aged, the express company will paj
for it but that will give your friend
no pleasure.
Third?Write the address - in full,
stating county, city, street and number
on the box or pucknge with ink or
crayon. Tags^are frequently torn off
and lost.
J.-uuii.ii?11 j-uu wuut to prepay uie
charges, write the worfl "Paid' in
large, plain lettqrs on the package.
Fifth?Insist upon getting a receipt
and see that the amount paid is marked
on the receipt and package and the
value of the package declared thereon.
Sixth?Write your own address in
full somewhere on the package follows
ng the prefix "From." Inclose a card
in each hox or package giving your
and the consignee's address.
Seventh?If not convenient to ship
in wooden boxes, use strong wrapping
paper, (not newspaper) and tie with a
strong cord.
Eighth ?If package contains anything-,of
a perishable nature, write the
word "Perishable' in large, plain letters
on the- box, thus insuring special
attention and first delivery.
DR. ELIOT STUDIES SOCIALISM.
After studying the returns of the
recent election in which the Socialists
made such a surprising showing,
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, president eraorHub
of Harvard University, became
deeply interested in the subject ol
Socialism and commenced a study oi
the "cause and effect" as he terms it,
In the course of his investigation
this eminent scholar made a trip to
Milwaukee, where he spent two days
studying that city's socialist chiei
executive, Mayor Seldel, his methods
and the strength of his party.
