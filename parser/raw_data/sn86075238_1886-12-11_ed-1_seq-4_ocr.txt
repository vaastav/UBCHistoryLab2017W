SATURDAY, DEC. 11, 1883. E
THE great bill-wrestling tournament
has begun at Washington.
THE President is r, ported as hav- p
ing worked himself into a fit of sick- a
ness over his exhaustive message. ti

CONGRESSM'AN PRICE of Wisconsin is
dead and before he is cold, several
ambitious politicians are scheming for
his place. A
THERE is a colored Fred Archer in ii
this country by the name of Isaac tl
Murphy. He makes $12,000 a year tl
out of jockeying. tl

THE brilliant Sunset Cox has i.een ti
returned to Congress, of which body n.
he has for many years been a useful ti
and ornamental member.
DnIasa the year 1886 Montana ship- e,
ped 6, 952,959 pounds of wool. The t
clip for the year as stated by the .Mon- la
tana Wool Grower will reach 7,250,000 :
pounds. oi
MIR. FR_ N PIXLEY, the brilliant, d,
but erratic editor of the Argonaut, is p,
still hurrahing, for the "American ei
Party" in spite of its being so cruelly
nipped in the bud at the late Cali
fornia election.
As a fair sample of the reward of G
literary merit, we note the fact that vi
Walt Whitman's income is only, $200 rig
a year. He ought to get a position at
as a country editor where he could tb
command a salary of $250 sr

W. K. Roberts have signed the peti tl
tion praying for his pardon. The
mitigating circumstances of the case di
certainly call for some leniency. ai
ST. PAUL is being favored with ex- T
cellent ice-palace weather and the b,
company will take advantage of the b<
propitious elements by building am
temple to his Hyperborean Majesty be
which will eclipse anything of the vc
kind ever attempted. fc

"THE wheel of fortune goes round fi
and round." In San Francisco, the b,
stock excitement has caused many for- f,
tunes to change hands. Many a man fE
with an empty stomach and coatless tl
back has been raised to affluence by fz
unloading his back number stocks p
which have been worthless for years. ei
AN enterprising doctor of the nut
meg state is trying to down the Stand- a
ard Oil monopoly by promulgating a
the theory that diphtheria is caused
by burning kerosene lamps in the b
houses. He is destined to receive as
much cheap notoriety and as little re
spect as the average weather prognos
ticator.

AND now X. Boidler is writing a g
book of reminiscences. It will be one m
of intense interest and probably make g,
Baron Munchausen turn over in his ff

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. ol
PRESIDENT CLEVeLAND forgot no- t
thing in his message to congress. He
covers the whole field. It nearly clogs t
the wires with its transmission to the
press throughout the country. He
congratulates the United States that
she is at peace with all the other na
tions of the earth, reiterates his re
commendations upon the fisheries
o question and hopes that congress will C
utake immediate action pointing to the
settlement of all piscatorial difficulties. tl
n He again urges the re-establishment
'- of the boundary line between British
d America and Alaska. takes up the sub- tc
0 ject of our Mexican relations and asks o0
for a better treaty for navigation and
commerce. He sustains Secretary
Bayard's position in the Cutting af
fair. He recommends a revision of
the extradition laws be so amended
so that the surplus be relegated to the ci
people, cheapening the price of the to
necessities of life and giving free en- b<
trance to such imported materials as p,
by American labor may be nianufac- it
tured into marketable commodities. di
He again, earnestly recommends the
r
suspension of the coinage of silver.
After suggesting some improvements
a in the judiciary system he reverts to
c the Indian question. He says that
r the agency system is inadequate to I
the requirements of the Indian Serv- Ib
ice and wisely recommends the aboli- si
ation of tribal relations and the allot- w
Y ment of their lands in severalty. He ti
thinks that all acts relating to the w
taking up of public lands be repealed IY
except the homestead and insists that Si
e the laws against the fencing of public
lands shall be strictly enforced. He
u urges arbitration as the proper meth- o
od of settling;difficulties between cap- Mt
ital and labor. He asks congress to lip
do something to stop the ravages of sa
s pieuro-pneumonia and winds up by Ij
1 endorsing Civil Service reform.
THE SPORTSMAN'S PARADISE. th
- - - to.
To the lover of our-door diversions G
F Great Falls and vicinity offers an in- T
t viting field. Within a short day's ci
ride the sparkling nIountain brooks Pi
i abound in the choicest specimens of
I the finny tribe, while both large and
small game yet tempt the hunter with
promises of reward which are sure to
be :fulfilled. Several bands of w
antelope lurk upon the outskirts of h,
the townsite within shot of which the \i
sly hunter may come any day. The F
drives about the town are all varied w
and exceedingly interesting. h
The smooth surface of Broadwater
bay which quietly washes the eastern
border of the town, allures the boat- ti
ma.a, who, with skiff or sail- tt
boat can pursue his pleasant w
voyage up the picturesque Missouri
for many miles. He will not cast his
line there in vain, for large white
fish, cat-fish, grayling and trout. We i'
a believe that this will be a great resort 12
for summer tourists who will not suf- n
fer from ennui though they prolong ,
s their stay througout the summer and F
Y fall season. There are innumerable s,
places of interest to visit and no s
end of healthful diversions. One of tl
these days some of the broad, level b
acres about here will be laid out for c
a fairground and race-track, for Mon- e
tanians are proverbially fond of con
testing the honors of the turf with
horses of noble blood.
THE CITIZEN'S DUTY.
In almost every town there are cer
tain individuals who are on hand to
a get all they can out ofthe community "
e without contributing anything them
e selves. Public spirit is-an element ij
s foreign to their character. We are, p
thus far, very fortunate in Great Falls ii
e in this respect. There are few if any, f
- of our citizens who hang back when
r" called upon to contribute to any good t
work. It should be firmly held in 1
mind that money, time and exertion
expended for churches, schools, librar
ies and other publicinstitutionsis not
a taxation upon what the contributor
never enjoys. Whatever adds to the
elevation of character and promotes
proper industries, redounds to the
benefit of each and every atom of the
corporate body.

IN reviewing the labor record of
's the past year the Pioneer Press apt
je ly remarks that tlit Knights of Labor
at are discovering that it is rather diffi
cult for any lobor organization to get
a
a corner on labor in this country.

ill Crook" has left this world's stage and
ne quietly retired to the green-room of

Jumped tne Gang.
Bf- rTTE, Nov. 7th.- Frank Ramage, an
of inmate of the jail wh, was working out
d a fifty dollar fine on the road a day or two
since, found himself suddenly with no
e custodian but a dense fog. and concluded
ae to itinerate, which he did, and has not
1- been seen since. If he will leave the city
as permanently the city will con,:ratulate
c- itself, for he is a notoriucis an chronic
s. drunkard.
W, W. Dixon's House Burglarized.
r.
s 3'UTTE, Dec. 7th.- --The residence of
to ilon. W. W. Dixon was surreptitiously
at entered last night and burglary attempted.
at Things in the house were well pawd over.
to Itis plated ware was tested as to solidity,
- but none was thken. Mr. Dixon's solid
i- silver not being accessible to the thieves,
t- was not stolen. The burglars made an en
Ie trance and exit through the transom,
ae which was removed, and that was the on
?d ly thing missing.
Si Sherinfs Sale of the Big- Slaughter
ic House.
e n Thursd:ay afternoon Sherlif Savage
sold tne entire plant and property of the
i)-- Miles City Dressed Beef Company at pub
o lic auction for the sucm of '2,5.870. The
of sale was made under an execution on the
ty judgmer~ which was confessed by the
company in favor of the Lincoln (I11l.)
banking house of Win. DUtstin & Co., and
the purchaser was W. II. Ross, Esq., trus
tee of the Lincoln Bank and the Stock
is Growers National bank of Miles City.
a- The amount of the sale represents the
's claims of those two institutions and at the
is present writing they, through their true.
tee, have possession of the plant in lieu of
their claims.--Yelllowstone Journal.
Deep Creek Dance. cr
On the evening of December 17, a dance -
will be given at the Deep creek school *t
house for the benefit of the school fund. A
Mr. Evans, who favored us with a call '¶
Friday, states that the school is provided
with a good teacher, Mr. Remington and
has about fifteen scholars in attendance. no
There are forty-one children in the dis
trict. It is to be hoped that there will be
a good attendance, as all will have a good
time and contribute their money to a wor
thy cause. The Great Falls string band
t will furnish the music.
Fire! Firell Firell!
Next Tuesday evening at Wetzel's store
in the Stone block, there will be a mass
meeting of citizens interested in the organ
ization of a Fire Department. We do not
need to urge tipon any sane man who is in
anyway pecuniarily interested in Great
SFalls, the necessity of at once providing
8 some means of stopping the spread of fires
o which are liable to break [out anytime in
f this town. A hook and ladder truck would
1 be the most practical purchase which
r could be made now; and then have it man- a
ed with certain reliable men who under
stand the business and will attend to it
when the time for action arrives. In a fa
vorable wind a tipped-over lamp or a va
grant burning match might sweep this
townsite as clean as it was when Paris Gib
- first looked upon it four years ago.
t, w is the time.to take hold of this mat
tr in earnest. Fire protection here will
o alo reduce the enormous premiums which
Y we are all compelled to pay to keep our
property insured. Let's go at this matter
ýt in a business-like manner and sensibly
, provide a means of preventing our build
bs ings from being transported to Heaven in
r, freight wagons of fire.

O. E. Spear has gone to Minneapolis to 1
remain until March. He has sold out his
horse-power drilling-machine and is go
ing to ship out his steam-power which has I
been in use at Fargo all summer. He will
also bring a stock of pumps and wind
mills.
Montana Central.
Although the Montana Central R. R.
surveyors have staked out several routes
leading into Great Falls, the one most
likely to be adopted will be the crossing
of the Missouri above SIn river, some
where near Dexter's ferry. The Montana
Northern connecting therewith from the
east, will probably cross the Missouri
sonugwhere between the Cataract mill and
Black Eangle falls.
