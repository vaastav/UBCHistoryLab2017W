BLAINE'S BOLD BID.
We had, in our juvenility and innocence,
bui posed that European travel would tend
to an expansion of thought that inter
course with new peoples would serve to re
move old prejudices, and that a bigoted
political policy professed here for a pur
pose would yield to. the enlightenment of
the growth of ages abroad. Well,yes, we had
thought that the plumed knight of Maine
would, like Russell Lowell,
believe in Freedom's name
As far away as Paris is.
And that in time he would come back to us
with his great mind unencumbered by
restricted notions of popular right and his
acknowledged statesmanship liberated from
partisan shackles. But no, the Ethiope's
color is unchanged; and in the salons of the
French capital he is just as intolerant of
progress as when addressing his Republi
can neighbors at Augusta or swinging
round the circle in his campaign for the
Presidency.
When the first telegraphic summary of
Mr Blaine's criticism on President Cleve
land's message reached us, we confess to
have entertained the idea that it was an
enterprising invention of some needy
French Reporter. We have high estimate
of Mr Blaine's qualities as a gentleman, and
we could hardly believe that with the at
tributes and instincts of the character he
would precipitately descend to make a bid
for a prospective 'dead man's shoes;' we be
lieve Mm to be a man of literary .eulture
and refinement and - hesitated credence to
. the- want of delicacy involved in his re
ported pronouncement on the President's
reform policy. We thought that having
stood three years ago as the rival candidate
to the great man who was selected
as ruler of the United States and, if
all signs of the times indicate truly, is
anxious to stand in the same relations again
he would,in the delicacy we have suggest
ed, refrain from a pronounced antago
nism and reserve his strictures for the
time when, if he get the opportunity he
should stand on the same broad platform
of open rivalry. But then? a nomination
would be a pre-requisite to such an oppor
tunity; and he anticipates the opportunity
by a bold bid for the pre-requisite.
It is not our desire or design to follow
the parripatetic Mr Blaine through the in
tricacies of his political platitudes in reply
to the President. The statements are of
the old reckless standard, the arguments of
the stamp that have sought to justify mon
opoly, and uphold corruption and crush
the people through all the years of Repub
lican misrule. Mr Blaine in this attidude
merely plays a part to subserve his own
ambition, for he is too acute a man not to
know that America cannot remain in the
old groove of party assumption while the
Nations 6f the world step in on the march
of progress. Mr Blaine puts in an opposition
to Mr Cleveland's proposition. Not that he
does not believe in their propriety, but that
it is the only recommendation he now
possesses to the favor of the cliques that
would suffer by their enforcement. It is
a lamentable thing when a great intelli
gence will lower itself before selfish aspir
ations: when what should be an ardent
patriotism yields to the miserable demands
of party ascendancy. Mr Blaine's time
for criticism was ill-chosen; his style un
warranted and unjust; the people of this
country are keen enough in the aggregate
to distinguish between the ruler who pro
motes reform and the would-be ruler who
would cling j.tne oia - J
tion will estimate' the object of Blaine's
Bold Bid. How the alliterative points
come in ! The three R's Rum, Romanism
and Rebellion of a reverend advocate
contributed in no small degree to the de
feat of 1884, and now the three little B's
Blaine's Bold Bid will operate, if we mis
take not, against his nomination in Con
vention. A, WORD IN SEASON.
It is glorious weather as we write, this
afternoon. The air is crisp, not "eager
and nipping;" and the sun is bright and
warm. Overhead it is pleasant, and under
foot dry; even the crossing are passable
and the sida-walks without unsightly mud
heaps. All this is very enjoyable, and we
are thankful for the favors which Heaven
gives.
But a day is coming is not far off may
be with us to-morrow or any time,
when as a compensation for the loss of
celestial favors now, we shall have to look
to mundane influences, to the power of
municipal authority; and more, the will
and determination to exercise that power.
Frost will be here anon indeed, is here at
present and the effect is to accelerate the
pulse and give vigor to the step of the mul
titude. All right. But what about the
snow? The "Beautiful Snow" as long as it
lasts is a God-send to those who, muffled
in furs, can disport themselves behind the
musical tinklings of the sleigh bells, and
return to their luxurious homes refreshed
and re-invigorated. The snow, however,
will degenerate into slush; the mud in street
and on pathway will become thick and
slab; the crossings, that used to be, will be
invisible in their filthy coatings, and pedes
trians the people of business who do not
possess sleighs and cannot afford to" pay
for carriage hirewill have to wade morn
ing, noon and night through seas of that
same slush and mountains of that same
mud, not only to their positive discom
fort, but to the danger of disease and
death. . - -'.I
Now our word in season is that the
Boards or Councils or Commi.slonex'3 or
whatever you pleeie to de?inrte the vari
ous bodies charged with conservation of
the City's comforts should take time by the
forelock and prepare for the time that
will come whether they be prepared or
not. If' there be City Ordinance8
for the cleaning of our thoroughfares let
them be enforced at any cost; if not, let
powers be sought in that direction and for
that TrarDose. we should like to see a
broom brigade daily in operation and carts
occasionally at work to take away the gath
ered street sweepings. We would rejoice
in the enforcement of a rule or if not exist
ing an ordinance therefor by which resi
dents in private house or public store
should be called upjpn to keep their front
ages respectively clear of snow and accu
mulated mud. And in especial manner it
would be more acceptable to us to see the
crossings so that persons might cross in
safety. In the last named matter, in. other
cities, house and store keepers have be
come a power unto themselves: if authority
does not act for them they find it to their
profit to keep the crossings to their premi
ses clean. This word in season or rather
anticipative of the season, is worth think
ing about.
How public boards protect public inter
ests is sometimes exemplified in not very
praiseworthy directions. The matter of
bids and contracts for City purposes is
made a mockery; and competition is pre
vented by a fore knowledge of favoritism,
Our local contemporary, the "Republi
can," mildly charges that: "A meeting of
the Fire Commissioners was called for last
night, but only the Mayor and Commis
sioner Roberts appeared,and they adjourned
subiect to the call of the Mayor." Just ao.
The meeting was for the award of con
tracts. Last year for similar purposes
the contract was awarded to the
"highest bidder" without any alle
oration iustifvina ..the selection. This
year there was no bidder but the contrac
tor of last jetT the other contestants
deaminsr it a waste of time and labor to
compete; and on this reason Mr Commis
sioner Kelly justifies his absence from last
night's meeting, and authorizes us to state
so. Perhaps the Commissioners generally
not only of the Fire Department but of
all others within municipal jurisdiction
would take to thought the fact that they
are appointed to protect public interests
and conserve publio funds and not to favor
bv exceptional preferences individual
friends.
We find a pamphlet on our desk entitled
"The Book of Books." with various sub
titles, by Professor Nathaniel N. Pearce
It treats on the cleansing of the blood and
the cure of all diseases, external and inter
nal. bv the simple use of hot water. The
Cold Water Cure of Claridge had its day,
and there are various Hydropathic estab
lishments still scattered over the world
but hot water ij a new suggestion. From
cancer to chilblain no reference to our
friend Blame oi teat ilk, tnougn tnere is
hot water enough in store for him from
rickets to rheumatism from biliousness to
bunions and from corns to consumption
hot water is the universal prescription
Nothing else will be effective, for any pur
pose but po.'soning. Doctors and drugs
pills and potions, bleeding and blistering
are all abominations. Hot Water is the
grand specific, and of this, goodness knows
many people have more than enough. The
little book, however, has a merit that is
not claimed for it. Mirth is acknowledged
to be a medicine in itself and there are
few who can resist the provocative to
mirth contained in the "Professor's" war
of extermination asrainst tlie "varmint"
cat and the filthy dog.
The annual report of the New York,New
Haven and Hartford railroad, which has
just been issued shows that corporation to
be in a highly prosperous condition. Al
though $672,582 has been spent in the past
year in improvements, principally in lay
ing four tracks, a dividend of 10 per cent.
can be paid, and there will still be cash as
sets amounting to $2,719,160. The report
describes in detail the different improve
ments under way and proposal. The four
tracks will be completed to Portchester
early in the spring. The block system of
signaling trains is being introduced on the
New York division, and will be in opera
tion in a few weeks. This will greatly re
duce the liability of accidents. Grade
crossings are to be abolished at twenty-two
places in Connecticut, and the same work
is being pushed in New York State. There
nas been a large increase or tne passenger
traffic during the past year, and the cars at
present in operation have been found to be
entirely inadequate for the business, and a
large number of new coaches have been
ordered. '
x hat jjemocratic JJuty, or wnicn we
wrote yesterday, impresses us the more the
more we think of it Our party owes it to
itself to stand together in unity of thought
and unity of action ln respect of the ap
proachmg appointments by the City
Fathers. The pressure from without
is
ever a potent factor in political matters
and if constituents insist representatives
must obey. The Aldermen and Council
lors of the Republican party admittedly
majority in both Chambers have the oppor
portunity of graceful concession to Demo
cratic claims; if they do not seize it, then
the representatives of the other side could
so act in concert as to lead to an obstruc
tion promotive of a dead-lock. We should
not like to see this. Mutual consideration
and fair play all round is what the citizens
want. We .welcome a reform indicating
general interests in national affairs let us
not cultivate the old grudge in City mat
ters. . - " '
Mb Blaine wants a special organ in the
West. It was somewhat confidently stated
m Washington last night that the defeated
of 1884 and the aspirant for 1888, through
his friend, Mr Stephen B. Elkins, is behind
the movement for securing the Chicago
Times," the des'gn being to make it the
leading Republican protection organ of the
noi ihwest, and, of course, an advocate of
the election of Mr Blaine to the.presidency
next year. It won't do, Sir Knight. There
is a counteracting power not to be over
looked; particularly as it exists in the Re
publican household. The "Tribune," Mr
Medilt's paper, while friendly to Mr Blaine
is yet a low tariff cnampion, ana to tne
surprise of "Republicans has come out
in unequivocal indorsement of the princi
ples laid down in the President's message,
and recommends their adoption by its par
ty in Congress.
The New York "8tar" suggests that the
Republican conclusion to hold a National
Convention in Chicago strengthens the ar
gument for a Democratic Convention in
the Empire City. Our contemporary adds:
"Let us avoid the inconvenience of having
two party platforms bearing the same
me, and at the same time reach the ad
vantages that can be gained in no other
way than by holding the grand council of
THE DEAREST FRIENDS. "
It's an overcome sooth for age an' youth.
And if . brooks wr nae denial ,
That the dearest friends are the auldest friends,
And the young are just on triaL
There's a rival bauld wi1 young an1 auld,
And it's him that has bereft me, . -
For the surest friends are the auldest friends
And the xnaist o' mines hae left me.
There are kind hearts still for friends to fill,
And fools to take and break them, -
But the dearest friends are the auldest friends,
And the grave's the place to seek them.

An English Quack Doctor's Trick.
A short time ago a quack experimented in
Lambeth with considerable success upon the
pockets of an awe stricken crowd. After a
preliminary harangue and a terse little lect
ure on the viscera, which ..the charlatan
1 A. t 3 1 a
eiteicueu in wtn coiorea crayons upon a
blackboard - on which the human skeleton
was outlined in white paint, the fellow came
to business. "I am going to demonstrate to
you," said he, "by a startling experiment
upon one of you bystanders, that my
miraculous remedy can cure all diseases of
the lungs and chest. Now, whoever's trot a
bad cough or cold on the chest let stand for
ward." There was some little hesitation and
a good deal of giggling. "Don't be afraid,
my friends," said the quack; "it's all free.
gratis, for nothing. Let any afflicted person
come forward and I'll show him the nature
of his disorder, and give him a packet of my
mng neaiers ror notmng." At last a man
with a violent cold and cough came forward.
The quack doctor pretended to sound his
chest with a stethoscope of almost pantomi
mic proportions ana miormea tne staring
crowd that the patient was in a galloping
consumption.
"My friend," said the quack to the unfortu
nate victim, "so terrible is this disease that
you can actually see it." He handed a glass
tube to the patient and then poured a pint
of clear water into a large tumbler. "Just
you blow into that water, my friend," he
cried. The man obeyed, and the water grew
discolored, turbid, and at last as white as if
it had been mixed with millr. The patient
became as pale as ashes. "This unhappy
man, my friends," said the quack, as he held
the glass on high, "if he had't had the Igood
fortune to come across me to-night wouldn't
have been long for this world. I should have
given him about a fortnight: that's all,
Now a packet of my lung healers will cure
him. What you see in the glass of water are
his vitiated humors, the products of corrup
tion. JVly magic lung healers destroy these
humors in the body or out of the body. Ob
serve, my friends, watch me carefully, there
is no deception here." The quack dropped a
pinch from one of a packet of powders into a
glass, and directed the patient to stir it with
the tube. The water , became immediately
clear. Then he reaped his harvest. The
water was lime water, and the carbonic acid
in the man's breath naturally threw down
the carbonate of lime at once, and rendered
the water turbid. And the miraculous lung
healer was simply a little citric acid and
sugar which instantly redissolved it. Satur

A Lowly Refreshment Stand.
At the foot of the Fifty-ninth street ele
vated station, between a stout telegraph pole
and one of the iron pillars, there sits a buxom
colored woman attired in the proverbial blue
calico dress, an immaculate white apron, and
a tantastical headdress of bandanna handker
chief. An ironing board does duty in front
of her as a counter, Upon this is placed at
one end a huge coffee urn with an oil stove
, nr i j- . , . - .
unaerneam. isexc to tms is an immense
waiter of deviled crabs. The woman usually
taKes up ner stand aDout n o'clock at night,
and there she remains until it is nearly morn
ing. During the few minute intervals on
the elevated trains she indulges in cat naps.
As each train deposits its load of passengers
she suddenly enthuses with the thought of a
possible customer. The voice that has been
trained in the old plantation school of music
raises its notes and utters the refrain of "Hot
coffee and debbled crabs." If no one stops to
purchase, and the rapidly dispersing crowd
warns her to infuse more life into her cry,
she sings in a higher key, "Here's nice hot
corphy and debbel crabs. Oh, won't you buy
dese deobei crabs r r
The belated passenger who does try a cup
of her coffee generally adds a nickel to her
price, and, if his digestion be good, a deviled
crab prepared in the old southern style of
cooking makes him wonder that such things
can be round at that time or night. The wo
man who keeps the stand is said to make be
tween $3 and $3 per night. New York Even

Gems in Brown Paper.
I heard a curious story about Mrs. Paran
Stevens, the other day, which was extremely
characteristic. A friend, calling was shown
up into her boudoir and took the first chair.
They conversed for a while, or rather he
listened with interest to her caustic comments
on men and things, until she said suddenly
"Oh, you're sitting on my diamonds; get
up this minute."
On examination he found that a little
crumpled brown paper parcel on the seat of
the chair, which he had not noticed when ho
sat down, let slip when he picked it up a per-
tect river of the most splendid gems.
"I keep them in brown paper," she ex
claimed, "to deceive the burglars. They'd
never think of looking in a brown paper bag
lying about anywhere on a shelf or in
drawer for some $75,000 worth of jewels.
There have been two attempts to steal them
within a year, and I hit on this as a good way
to keep them." Brooklyn Citizen.

BUILDING PIANOS.
SOME CURIOUS FACTS REGARDING
THEIR MANUFACTURE AND SALE.
Comparatively Few Piano Factories Can
Justly Claim to Make Their Own In
struments Fanciful Namea-Borrowlns;
a Good Scale Various Successful Tricks.
Pianofortes are no longer manufactured,
but are built. Only two or three of the hun
dreds of piano factories in this country can
ustly claim to make their instruments from
beginning to finish. Large establishments
devoted to the manufacture of some particu
lar portions of the instrument have sprung
up of late, and have so revolutionized the art
of piano making that in some shops not a sin
gle part of the completed instrument is made
in the factory. -
There are probably a dozen places in New
York and vicinity devoted exclusively to the
making of cases. A like number make the
beautiful and delicate piece of mechanism
known as the action, and as many foundries
cast the heavy iron plates which sustain the
enormous strain of the strings, mere are
also manufacturers of sounding boards, and
of wrest planks, into which the tuning pins
are set; carvers of legs, lyres and trusses; im
porters of felts and cloths, winders of wrapped
strings for the lower notes, and drawers of
thinner wires for the upper notes.
Several large houses make a specialty of
pianoforte hardware, and' a half dozen cut
ters of ivory supply complete keyboards with
black keys of ebony and white keys of a me
dium quality of ivory. Other establishments
make keys of various compositions, princi
pally of celluloid, and even the stencil plates
for the name are often furnished by the var
nish dealer. Thus, nothing remains to be
made at the factory but the name, and that
is sometimes of the most adroit workman
ship, t
One of the largest buildings on the west
side of this city, with a capacity of turning
out the enormous number of sixty to seventy
five completed instruments a weeky makes no
part of the piano but the name, and quite
frequently even that is furnished to them by
the dealer who buys largely enough to jus
tify having his own name put on as the
maker. Sometimes a name is manufactured
having so close a resemblance to that of some
one of the best known makers as to mislead
the unwary.
UNDER FANCIFUL NAMES.
Besides these, dozens of names, purely
fanciful, are used by makers whose reputa
tion will not justify demanding a high price
for pianos bearing their own name. It is
not, however, to be inferred that all instru
ments built and put together like blocks in a
puzzle are necessarily inferior.
The quality of a pianoforte depends upon
two essentials the scale, and the care with
which it is constructed and finished. The
scale is a matter of scientific accuracy in
form, balance and proportions of the iron
frame over which the strings are stretched,
and its adjustment to the sounding board.
This is generally most readily arrived at by
borrowing from some leading maker. A first
class piano is secured and taken to pieces, the
frame or scale is copied, often by making- a
casting from the original plate, and the new
manufacture is equipped with a successful
scale, without experiencing any of the delay
and disappointment incident to experiments
m search of the new and the beautiful.
The casemaker is next visited, and it is
found that a moderate price will buy a case
suitable for a high class instrument, and one
less elaborate, made of lighter material, can
be had for a surprisingly small sum. Whilo
the case, which .is made of white wood and
ash, veneered with something more expen
sive, is getting ? its first coat of the stain
which is to turn it into rosewood, ebony or
cherry, the skilled workmen are putting the
frame and sounding board together. The
stringing is then done, the pins being driven
into place with a hammer instead of being
carefully screwed m as in the old fashioned
days of conscientious work and high prices.
while this 13 in hand the case is glued to
gether, having received its several coats of
varnish. i s
More rosewood pianos are made than of all
the other sorts combined; yet few are really
veneered with rosewood nowadays. This is
because it is seldom that varnish will not
soon show small chinks and cracks on this
veneer, and, as a very close imitation can be
produced by staining, it is usual to veneer
the ' cases jwith mahogany or baywood or
sometimes with cherry, and then transform
it into rosewood or ebony as preferred. No
real ebony is ever used for similar reasons.
and also because large pieces of ebony veneer
cannot be had. . -
- THE JFTNJggJJJjJ TOUCHES.
After the stain comes the Tarnishing.
"This
is frequently done by contract, the varnish
foreman receiving a stated price for each in
strument finished, hiring his own assistants
and buying the varnish himself. After the
case has joined company with the iron frame
and sounding board, the action is placed in
position and the wires get the first rough
tuning. If the piano is to have any soul, the
tone regulator now proceeds to develop it by
his skill But if the price at which it is to be
sold does not justify such luxuries as a pure,
round and even toneand a crisp, responsive
touch, the soul maker's responsibilities are
not exacting. Fly finishing is done last.
This includes putting on lock and hinges,
and the instrument is then ready for sale.
It is popularly believed that no plain piano,
however fine, can be made to cost the manu
facturer more than $200, and the fact that
some of the cheapest are wholesaled at less
than $150 seems to justify that impression.
It is thus a matter of comment that in nearly
all catalogues the old extravagant prices are
quoted, although it is well known that in al
most every case the list price is utterly dis
regarded in making a sale.
Only one house of any repute has had the
courage to do away with the long price . sys
tem, and to face the inference that reduction
indicates a cheapening of quality. One great
establishment vigorously holds to the high
list throughout, giving only a moderate dis
count even at wholesale, but its patrons seem
willing to pay the prices, and a reduction or
modification would probably result in a loss
of caste.
All the piano makers, however, do not
grow rich. Long credits and enormous bills,
money borrowed, and notes discounted at
ruinous rates ivork havoc among these as
with other classes of business men. And
without copious advertising a piano maker
might as well close his doors. A piano can
not be sold at a fair price unless it is already
favorably known. ' It requires a long head as
well as a deep pocket to make a good piano,
and to sell it after it is made. New York

A Famous Doctor
Once said that the secret of good health
consisted in keeping the head cool, the
feet warm, and the bowels open. Had
this eminent physician lived in our day,
and known the merits of Ayer's Pills
as an aperient, he would certainly have
' recommended them, as so many of his
distinguished successors are doing.
The celebrated Dr. Farnsworth, of
. Norwich, Conn., recommends Ayer's
Pills as the best of all remedies for
"Intermittent Fevers."
Dr. I. E. Fowler, of Bridgeport,
Conn., says: "Ayer's Pills are highly
and universally spoken of by the people
about here. I make daily use of them
in my practice."
Dr. Mayhew, of New Bedford, Mass.,
says : " Having prescribed many thou
sands of Ayer's Pills, in my practice, I
can unhesitatingly pronounce them the
best cathartic in use."
The Massachusetts State Assaver. Dr.
A. A. Hayes, certifies : " I have made a
careful analysis of Ayer's Pills. They
contain the active principles of well-
known drugs, isolated from inert mat
ter, wmcn plan is, cnemicauy speaKing,
oi great importance to their useiumess.
It insures activity, certainty, and uni
formity of effect. Ayer's Pills contain
no ro&tallic or mineral substance, but
. the virtues of vegetable remedies in
skillful combination."
