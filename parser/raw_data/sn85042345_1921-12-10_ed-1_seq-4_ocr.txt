people to Jive at home for a wek! line, of

urge someone in authority to designate n week

to cat breakfast or go to their dally task?

Henry Port! presents a daring but not a novel
method for financing the Muerle Hhetals prop
osition. It Is estimated that It will require 110,
000,00ft to onmplet this proeet If bonds wero
floated for tho purpose the government must
needs pay Inleretn on tmm. "There Is no Uhj
letting anybody g'sft on ih government like
that," says tho Mule builder.
Not at all. Orsftln off the government by ol
looting a low rale of Intsrest for the im of
money Is entirely wrong, but grafting off the
government In building Impossible tin boats nr
operating n. piece of government property fdr
private profit that Is high-minded bllslneea
according to Henry!
I'ord ayn the government nhould lsue
United Htatew eurrency for the amount noeen
sary to complete tho Muse Hhoals plant.
Therefore It would not be compelled l pay any
body any profit for the thing. Aside from tho
fact that here Is a piece of government prop
erly whleh tho Musle builder wants to get hold
of, It Is neeenwiry to Inquire Into this plan of
financing.
If It In wound finance for the, government to
merely Iwttie Its promlso to pay In sufficient
aunntlly to finance I'ord and his Muscle Hhoals
pUnn, why should not the government go the
wholo way and print enough paper'to retire It
present bonded Indebtedness thus relieving
Itself of all "graft" In the form of Interest
Let Mr. Pord answer that tieetlon. Then ho
might also answer this:
Does ho Intend to recommend that this gov
ernment embark upon the nam treacherous
sea of Inflation which has all but wrocked hs
bark of every llurnpeuu government?
And about the "graft" Involved In charging
the government for the tiej of private money
doesn't thst rule apply more or less to tho
manufacturer', rather Inslitent demind for a
fair profit on his turnover?
And finally, who miggcntcd to Henry Ford
that ho Is an authority on finance?

Aa on opportunity to gather the patronrt ot
the public schools Into a single congregation
and thus permit tho school authorities to dem
onstrate precisely what It Is tho schools are
doing, National educational Week constitute
a worthy vehlolo for accomplishing a gonulno
public rervlcc.
It Hhould be scrupulously maintained for
demonstration purposes only for Inspiring
faith and ronfldenae In tho eohools of our land;
for bringing closer together, perhaps, the teach
ing body with tho patron body.
Tulsa has every reason for feollng great
prldo In Its public rchool system. Ciltlelnmu
there are, of courts, but they must he crit
icisms of detail rather than principle or pur
pose. Tulsa possesses n. high school capable of
affording the student every essential inrann for
conquering the practical difficulties of life. We
have no doubt that thero are boy and girl
graduates of Tulsa High who will go as far and
climb as high In life a any who seek greater
academic learning elsewhere. It Is the primary
or baso knnwledgo which counts In the long run.
There nre many attractions In the city dur
ing tho week, but none of these nhould prevent
the parent and child from attending 'it least
one of tho demonstrations of National Kduca.

My succenn? It Is due to the great good for
tunti of having been born in circumstances that
universally lauee discontent ami lomplalnt. I e ,
In poverty .1 J. Hill said apologetically of his
boys, that "they had done fairly well enrii'ld
erlith their lack of advantages." ho meant the
advantage of being born poor.
Koonnmle conditions are hard nnd unfair and
make life too competitive too much "dog eat
dog" and It Is only well burdened candidates
that get to tho top, nnd thosv are tho ones who
have the hard knocks early.
Of coutre, millions go down In the strugglo
before ihey get a fulr start, such ure the terms
of modem life.
My succorH'.' I will never boast of It Until
I have done something tangible to make every
one successful. No one can be proud of a suc
cess that Is built on the bout shoulder of his
fellow math
If ou would be- truly successful, dedicate
yourtmif to the service of your brothers: don t
rent until you have notiRht out the cause ot
falluro of others and helped to destroy It.
You may have great financial and commor
clal success by industry, honesty and good
fortune, Influenced largely by your early en
vironment. Hut with all this you will not be successful
without an Ideal.
And you will not he fully nuccesstul without
that Ideal poseesiion you Impels you to work
for It.
And tho Idea) must be a practical one, and
to Im practical It must concern tho economic
welfare uf mankind.
