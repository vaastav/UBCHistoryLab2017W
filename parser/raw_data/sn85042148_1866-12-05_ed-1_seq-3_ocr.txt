Uniest Meeting i Davidsoa County.
At a meeting Ueld in Davidson County, at
Union School House, on Saturday, Novem-
vet zotu, loou, u ---
called to the chair. ,
The meeting assembled for the purpose of
maintaining and preserving the organization
of the Union, to tlie end that the btate gov
ernment of North-Carolina may be so ad
ministered as to secure the restoration and
perpetuation of the rights, privilege and
ira'uunitics of the people thereof, and their
form of government with the National gov
ernment5 Grateful for the preservation of
tht sentiment of nationality which is the
shield of the Constitution and sure guarantee-
ofa republican form ot government, we sin
cerely desire reconciliation, forgiveness and
charity among all classes of American peo
ple, who were either engaged or involved
in the late civil war.
The following resolutions were adopted:
, r Ecmlml, 1st, That only those men, with
out regard to their antecedents, who an- un
mistakably loyal to the government of the
United States,sbould be appointed or elected
by the people of North-Carolina to any of
fice of trust or profit.
Beteked, ad. That in order to- secure the
re-establisliinent of the State in "the Federal
Union, the speedy restoration of all righto
privileges and immunities of her loyal citi
zens, and the final adjustment of the govern
mental relations of her whole people in har
mony with the National government, to
' these ends the amendment proposed by Con
gress should le accepted and ratified by the
General Assembly of North-Carolina.
Betdoed, 3d, Taking into consideration
what the men loy.il to the United States
government have suffered during the past
rebellion from the enemies thereof, and as
they are yet likely to suffer from the same
men, who pretend to be Unionists, thus at
tempting to push true Unionists from their
honorable position and place them beneath
ven the free negro, therefore we, the loyal
men of tie County of Davidson, are deter
mined to hold our own at all hazards as in
dependent freemen, and .work out our own
salvation.
Retained, 4th, That we uphold the Consti
tution, and never did give voluntary aid to
the rebellion. Neither will we aid it at pres
ent, being well aware that our enemies are
striving to perform at the ballot box that
which they failed in doing with the bayonet
B&olted, 5th. That we rate the rights and
liljerfcfcjs which our forefathers fought for
and won, an inestimable blessing, which we
are determined to defend at all hazards.
On motion, George Riley, Esq., of Lexing
ton, wag called upon to occupy the floor,
which motion he accepted and addressed a
large and respoctable audience, who 'gave
their undivided attention.
Col. W. F. Henderson, of Davidson Coun

less manner.
It was then ordered that the above pro
ceedings be published in the Raleigh Stand
ard, and the meeting then adjourned.

MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES TO THE TWO HOU
SES OF CONGRESS AT THE COM-
. ' MEtfCEMENT OF THE SECOND ses
sion. ' ; " ,' , :
FeUote Citkin of the Senate ,
" and House of Representative :
After a brief interval the Congress of
the United States resumes its annual
leeislative labors. An all-wise and mer
ciful Providence has abated the pesti
lence which visited our shores, leaving
its calamitous traces upon some portions
of our country. , Peace, order, tranquil
lity, aud civil, authority have been for
mally declared to exist throughout the
whole of the United States. In all of
the States civil authority has superseded
the coercion of arms, and the people, by
their voluntary action, are maintaining
their governments in full activity and
compfete operation. The enforcement
of the laws is no longer ." obstructed in
any State by combinations too power
ful to be suppressed by the ordinary
course of judicial proceedings;" and
the animosities engendered by the war
are rapidly yielding to the beneficent
influences of our free institutions, aud
to the kindly effects of unrestricted so
cial and commercial intercourse. An
entire restoration of fraternal feeling
must be the earnest wish of every pa
triotic heart; and we will have accom
plished our grandest national achieve
ment when, forgetting the sad events
of the past, and remembering only their
instructive lessons, we resume our on
ward career as a free, prosperous, and
united people.
In my message of the 4th of Decem
ber, 1865, Congress was informed of the
measures which had been instituted by
the Executive with a view to the gra
dual restoration of the States in which
the insurrection occurred to their rela
tions with the General Government.
Provisional Governors had been appoin
ted, Conventions called, Governors elec
ted, Legislatures assembled, and Sena
tors and Representatives chosen to the
Cortgress of the United States. Courts
had been opened for the enforcement of
laws long in aleyance. The blockade
had been removed, custom-houses re
established, aud the internal revenue
laws put in force, in order that the peo
ple might contribute to the national in
come. Postal operations had been re
newed, and efforts were being made to
restore them to their fonuer condition
of efficiency. The States themselves
had been asked to take part in the high
function of amending the Constitution,
and of thus sanctioning the extinction
of African slavery as one of the legiti
mate results of our internecine struggle.
Having progressed thus far, the Ex
ecutive Department found that it had
accomplished nearly all that was within
the scope of its constitutional autliority.
One thing, however, yet remained to be
done before the work of restoration
could be completed, and that was the
admission to Congress of loyal Senators
and Representative from the States
whose people had rebelled against the
lawful authority of the General Gov
ernment. This questiou devolved upon
the respective Housfe's, which, by the
Constitution, are made the judges of
the elections, returns, and qualifications
of their own members ; and its consid
eration at once engaged the attention of
Congress. '
In the meantime, the Executive De
partment no other plan having been
proposed by Congress continued its
efforts to perfect, as far as was practica
ble, the restoration of the proper rela
tions between the citizens of the respec
tive States, the States, and the Federal
Government, extending, from time to
time, as the public interests seemed to
require, the judicial, revenue, and pos
tal systems of the country. With ihe
advice and consent of the" Senate, the
necessary officers were appointed, and
appropriations made by Congress for
the payment of their salaries. The pro
position to amend the Federal Consti
tution, so as to prevent the existence of
slavery within the United States or any
place subject to their jurisdiction, was
ratified by the requisite number of
States ; and on the 18th day of Decem
ber, 1865, it was officially declared to
have become valid as a part of the Con
stitution of the United States. All of
the States in which the insurrection had
existed promptly amended their Con
stitutions, so as to make them conform
to the great change thus effected in the
organic law of the land ; declared null
and void all ordinances and laws of se
cession ; repudiated all pretended debts
and obligations created for the revolu
tionary purposes of the insurrection ;
and proceeded, in good faith, to the
enactment of measures for the protec
tion and amelioration of the condition
of the colored race. Congress, how
ever, yet hesitated to admit any of these
States to representation ; and it was
not nntil towards the close ot the eighth,
month of the session that an exception
was made in favor of Tennessee, by the
admission of her Senators and Repre
sentatives. I deem it 'a subject of profound re
gret that Congress has thus far failed to
admit to seats loyal Senators and Rep
resentatives from the .other States,
whose inhabitants, with those of Ten
nessee, had engaged in the rebellion.
Ten States more than one-fourth of
the whole number remain without rep
resentation ; the seats of fifty members
in the House of Representatives and
of twenty members in the Senate are
yet vacant not by their own consent,
not by a failure of election, but by the
refusal of Congress to accept their cre
dentials. Their admission, it is better
ed, would have accomplished much to-
wards the renewal and strengthening:
of our relations as one people, and re
moved serious cause for discontent oa
the part of the inhabitants of those
States. It would have accorded witk
the great principle enunciated in tSie
Declaration of American Independence,
that no people ought to bear the bur
den of taxation, and yet be denied the
right of representation. It would have
been in consonance with the express
provisions of the Constitution, that
" each State shall hare at least one rep
resentative," and " that no State with
out its consent, shall -he deprived of Ha
equal suffrage in the Senate." TUeso
pry visions were intended to 'secure to
every State, and to the people, of every
State, the right of representation in each
House ot tongress ; and so important
was it deemed by the framers of the
Constitution that the equality of the
States in the Senate shonld be preserv-1:
ed, that not even by an amendment of
tne constitution can any btate, without
. i i i - . i
no cuureiu, ue uemeu a voice in mat
branch of the National Legislature.
It is true, it has been assumed that !
the existence of the States was terrain- j
ated by the rebellious- acts of their in
habitants, and ' that the insurrection
having been suppressed, they were
thenceforward to be considered merely
as conquered territories. The Legisla
tive, Executive, and Judicial Depart
ments of the government have, how
ever, with great distinctness and uni
form consistency, refused to sanction an
assumption so incompatible with the
nature of our republican system, and
with the professed objects of the war.
Throughout the recent legislation of
Congress, the undeniable fact makes it
self apparent, that these ten political
communities are nothing less than
States of this Union. At the very com
mencement of the rebellion, each House
declared, with a unanimity as remarka
ble as it was significant, that the war
was not " waged, upoii bur part, in any
spirit of oppression, nor for any pur
pose of conquest or subjugation, nor
purpose of overthrowing or interfering
with the rights or established institu
tions of those States, but to defend and
maintain the supremacy of the Consti
tution and all laws made in pursuance
thereof and to preserve the Union with
all the dignity, equality, and rights of
the several States unimpaired ; and that
as soon as these objects" were " ac
complished the war ought to cease."
In some instances, Senators were per
mitted to continue their legislative func
tions, while in other instances Repre
sentatives were elected and admitted to
seats after their States had formally de
clared their right to withdraw from the
Union, and were endeavoring to main
tain that right by force of arms. All
of the States whose people were in in
surrection, as States, were included in
the apportionment of the direct tax of
twenty millions of dollars annually
laid upon the United States by the act
approved 5th August, 1861. Congress,
by the act of March 4, 1862, and by
the apportionment of representation
thereunder, also recognized their pres
ence as States in the Union ; and they
have, for judicial purposes, been divi
ded into districts, as States alone can
be divided. The same recognition ap
pers in the recent legislation in refer
ence to Tennessee, which evidently rests
npon the fact that the functions of the
State were not destroyed by the rebell
ion, but merely suspended ; and that
principle is of course applicable to those
States which, like Tennessee, attempted
to renounce their places in the Union.
The action of the Executive Department
of the Government upon this Bubject has
been equally definite and uniform, and the
purpose of the war was specifically stated in
the Proclamation issued by my predecessor
on the 22d day of Scptemlier, 1862. It was
then solemnly proclaimed and declared that
"hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be
prosecuted for the object of practically re
storing the constitutional relation letveen
the United States and each of the States and
the people thereof, in which States that rela
tion is or may be suspended or disturbed."
Tbe rccognitiou of the States by the Judi
cial Department of the Government has also
been clear and conclusive in all proceedings
affecting them as States, had in the Su
preme, Circuit, and District Courts.
In the admission of Senators and Represen
tatives from any and nil of th States, there
can be no just ground of apprehension that
persons who are disloyal will be clothed with
the powers of legislation ; for this could not
happen when the Constitution and the laws
are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Con
gress. Each House is made the "judge of
the elections, returns, and qualifications of
its own members.'7 and may, "with the con
currence of two-tlrirds, expel a member."
When a Senator or Representative presents
bis certificate of election, he may at once be
admitted or rejected ; or, should there be any
question as to his eligibility, his credeqtials
may be referred for investigation to the ap
propriate conynittee. If admitted to a scat,
it must I'm; upon evidence satisfactory to the
House of which he thus becomes a member,
that he possesses the requisite constitutional
and legal qualifications. If refused admis
sion as u member for want of due allegiance
to the Government, and returned to his con
stituents, they are admonished that none but
persons loyal to the United States will be al
lowed a voice in the Legislative Councils of
the Nation, and the political power and mor
al influence of Congress are thus effectively
exerted in the interests of loyalty to the
Government and fidelity to the Union. Up
on this question, so vitally affecting the res
toration of the Union and the permanency of
oar present form of government, my convic
tions, heretofore expressed, have undergone
no change ; but, on the contrary, their cor
rectness has been confirmed by reflection and
time. If tbe admission of loyal members to
seats in the respective Houses -of Congress
was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no
less wise and expedient now. If this anom
alaus condition is right now if, in the ex
act condition of these States at tbe psesent
time, it is lawful to exclude them from rep
resentation, I do not see that the question will
be changed by the efflux of time. Ten years
hence, if these States remain as they are, the
right of representation will be no stronger
the right ot exclusion will be no weaker.
The Constitution of the United States
makes it the duty of the President to recom
mend to the consideration of Congress "such
measures as he shall junge necessary or expe
dient." I know of no measure more imper
atively demanded by every consideration of
national interest, sound policy, and equal
justice, than the admission of loyal members
from the now unrepresented States. This
would consummate the work of restoration,
and exert a most salutary influence in the
re-establishment ot peace, harmony, and fra
ternal feeling. It would teud greatly to re
new the confidence of the American people
in the vigor -and stability of their institu
tions. It would bind us more closely to
gether as a nation, and enable us to show to
the world the inherent and recuperative
power of a Government founded upon the
will of the people, and established upon the
principles of liberty, justice, and intelligence.
Our increased strength and enhanced pros
perity would irrefragably demonstrate the
fallacy of the arguments against free institu
tions drawn from our recent national disor
ders by the enemies of republican govern
ment. Tbe admission of loyal members from
the States now excluded from Congress, by
allaying doubt and apprehension, would
turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity
for investment, into the channels of trade
and industry. It would alleviate the pres
ent troubled condition of those States,, and,
by inducing emigration, aid in the settlement
of fertile regions now uncultivated, and lead
to an increased production of those staples
which have added so greatly to the wealth
of the nation and the commerce of the world.
New fields of enterprise would be opened to
our progressive people, and soon the devas-
fotions of war would be repaired, and all
traces of our domestic differences effaced
from the minds of our countrymen. .-'
; In our efforts to preserve "ihe unity of
Government which constitutes us one peo
ple," by restoring the States to the condition
which they held prior to the rebellion, we
should be cautious, lest, having rescued our
nation from perils of threatened disintegra
tion, we resort to consolidation, and in the
end absolute despotisiu, as a remedy for the
recurrence of similar troubles. The war hav
ing terminated, and with it all occasion for
the exercise ot powers of doubtful constitu
tionality, we should hasten to bring legisla
tion within tbe boundaries prescribed by the
Constitution, and to return to the ancient
landmarks established by our fathers for the
guidance of succeeding generations. . "The
Constitution which at any time exists, nntil
changed by an explicit and authentic act of
the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon
all." " If, in the opinion of the people, the
distribution or modification of the constitu
tional powers be, in any particular, wrong,
let it be corrected by an amendment in the
way in which the Constirution designates.
But let there be no change by usurpation ;
for "it is the customary weapon by which
free Governments are destroyed." Washing
ton spoke these words to his countrymen,
when, followed by their love and gratitude,
he voluntarily retired from the cares of pub
lic life. " To keep in all things within the
pale of our constitutional powers, and cher
ish the Federal Union as the only rock of
safety," were prescribed by Jefferson a3 rules
of action to endear to his " countrymen the
true principles of their Constitution, and
promote a union of sentiment and action
equally auspicious to their happiness and
safety." Jackson held thai the action of the
General Government should always be strict
ly confined to the sphere of its appropriate
duties, and justly and forcibly urged that
our Government is not to be maintained nor
our Union preserved " by invasions of the
rights and powers of the several States. In
thus attempting to make our General Gov
ernment strong, we make it weak. Its true
strength consists in leaving individuals and
States as much as possible to themselvs; in
making itself felt, not in its power, uut in
its beneficence ; not in its control, but in its
protection ; not in binding the States more
closely to the centre, but leaving each to
move unobstructed in its proper constitu
tional orbit." These are the teachings of
men whose deeds and services have made
them . illustrious, and who, long since with
drawn from the scenes of life, have left to
their country the rich legacy of their exam
ple, their wisdom, and their patriotism.
Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons,
let us emulate them in love of country and
respect for the Constitution and the laws.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
affords much information respecting the rev
enue and commerce of the country. His
views upon the currency, and with reference
to a proper adjustment of our revenue sys
tem, internal as well as impost, are commen
ded to the careful consideration of Congress.
In my last annual message I expressed my
general views upon these subjects. I need
now only call attention to the necessity of
carrying into every department of the Gov
ernment a system of. rigid accountability,
thorough retrenchment and wise economy,
With no exceptional nor unusual expendi
tures, the oppressive burdens of taxation can
be lessened by such a modification of our rev
enue laws as will be consistent with the pub
lic faith, and the legitimate and necessary
wants of the Government.
The report presents a much more satisfac
tory condition of our finances than one year
ago the most sanguine could nave anticipa
ted. During the fiscal year ending the 30th
June, 1865, the last year of the war, the pub
lic debt was increased $941,902,537, and on
the 31st of October, I860, it amounted to
$2,740,854,750. On the 21st of October, 1866,
it had been reduced to $2,551,310,006, the
diminution, during a period of fourteen
months, commencing September 1, 1865, and
ending October 31. 1806, having been $206,-
379.565. In the last annual report on the
state ot the finances, it was estimated that
during the three quarters of the fiscal year
ending the 30th of June last, the debt would
be increased $112,194,947. During that pe
riod, however, it was reduced $31,196,387,
the receipts of the year having been f su,
905,905 more, and the expenditures $200,
529.235 less than the estimates. Nothing
could more clearlv indicate than these state
ments the extent and availability of the na
tional resources, and the rapidity and safety
with which, under our form of government,
preat military and naval establishments can
be disbanded, and expenses reduced from a
war to a peace footing.
During the fiscal year ending the 30th of
June, 1866, the receipts were foo8,U32,BZ,
and the expenditures $320,750,940, leaving
an available surplus of $37,281,680. It is
estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year
ending the 30th June. 18U7, win oe f470,
061.386. and that the expenditures will reach
the sum of $316,328,078, leaving in the Treas
ury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fis
cal year ending June 80, 1868, it is estima
ted that the receipts will amount to $436,
000.000. and that tbe expenditures will be
$350,247,641 showing an excess of $85,
752,359 in favor of the Government. These
estimated receipts may be diminished by a
reduction ot excise and import duties ; duc
after all necessary reductions shall have been
made, the revenue ot the present aud ot fol
lowing years will doubtless be sufficient to
cover all leiritimate charges upon the Treas
ury, and leave a large annual surplus to be
applied to the payment of the principal of
the debt. There seems now to oe no gooo
reason why taxes may not be reduced as the
country advances in population and wealth,
and yet the debt be extinguished within the
next Quarter of a century.
The report of the Secretary of War furn
ishes valuable and important informa
tion in reference to the operations of bis
Department during the past year. Few
volunteers now remain in ' tbe service,
and thev are beinz discharged as rapidly as
thev can be' replaced by regular troops. The
army has been promply paid, carefully pro
vided with medical treatment, well sheltered
and subsisted, and is to be furnished with
beech-loading small arras. The military
strength of the nation has been unimpaired
by the discharge of volunteers, the disposi
tion of unserviceable or perishable stores, and
the retrenchment of expenditure. Sufficient
war material to meet any emergency has
been retained, and from the disbanded vol
unteers standing ready to respond to the na
tional call, large armies can be rapidly or
ganized, equipped, and concentrated. For
tifications on the coasts and frontier have re
ceived, or are being prepared for more pow
erful armaments ; lake surveys and harbor
and river improvements are in course of en
ergetic prosecution. Preparations have been
made for the payment of the additional
bounties authorized during the recent ses
sion of Congress, under such regulations as
will protect the Government from fraud, and
secure to the honorably-discharged soldier
the well-earned reward of his faithfulness
and gallantry. More than six thousand
maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs
or other surgical apparatus ; and forty-one
national cemetries, containing the remains of
104,526 Union soldiers, have already been"
established. The total estimate of military
appropriations is $25,205,669. .
It is stated in the report of tbe Secretary
of tbe Navy that the naval force at this time
consists of two hundred and seventy-eight
vessels, armed with two thousand three hun
dred and fifty-one guns. Of these, one hun
dred and fifteen vessels, carrying one thous
and and twenty-nine guns, are in commis
sion, distributed chiefly among seven squad
rons. - The number of men in the service is
thirteen thousand six Hundred. Great ac
tivity and vigilance have been displayed by .
all the squadrons sou lueir movements nave
been judiciously and efficiently arranged in
such manner as would best promote Ameri
can commerce, and proteet the rights and in
terests of our countrymen abroad. The ves
sels unemployed are undergoing repairs, or
are laid up until their services may be re
quired. Mostof the iron-clad fleet is at League
Island, in the vicinity of Philadelphia,a place
which, until decisive action should be taken
Congress, was selected by the Secretary of
the Navy as the most eligible location for
that class of vessels. It is important that a
suitable public station should be provided
for the iron-clad fleet. It is intended that
these vessels shall be in proper condition for
any emergency, and it is desirable that the
bill accepting League Island for naval pur
poses, the House of Representatives at its
last session, should receive final action at
early period, in order that there may be a
suitable public station for this class of vessels,
as well as a navy-yard of area sufficient for
tbe wants of" the service, on the Delaware
river. The Naval Pension fund amounts to
$11,650,000, having been increased $2,750,
000 during the year. The expenditures of
the Department for the fiscal year ending
30th June last were $43,324,526, and the es
timates for the coming amount to $23,568,
436. Attention is invited to the con
dition of our seamen, and the importance of
legislative measures for their relief and im
provement. The suggestions in behalf of
this deserving class of our fellow-citizens are
earnestly recomineded to the favorable at
tention of Congress.
The report of the Postmaster General pre
sents a most satisfactory condition of the
postal service, and submits recommencl-tions
which deserve t he consideration of Congress.
The revenues of the Department for the year
ending June 30, 1966, were $14,386,986, and
the expenditures $15,352,079, showing an ex
cess of the latter of $965,093. In anticipa
tion of this deficiency, however, a special ap
propriation was made by Congress in tbe act
approved July 28, 1866. Including the stand
ing appropriation of $700,000 for free mail
matter, as a legitimate portion of the reve
nues yet remaining unexpended, the actual
deficiency for the past year is only $265,093
a sum within $51,141 of the amount esti
mated in the annual report of 1864. The de
crease of revenue compared with the previ
ous year was one and one-fifth per cent., and
the increase of expenditures, owing princi
pally to the enlargement of the mail service
in lie doumi, was twelve per cent, ua me
30th of June last there were in operation six
thousand nine hundred and thirty mail
routes, with an aggregate length of one hun
dred and eighty thonsand nine hundred and
twenty-one miles, an aggregate annual trans
portation of seventy-one million eight hun
dred and thirty-scventhousand nine hundred
and fourteen miles, and an aggregate annual
cost, including all expenditures, of $8,410,-
184. The length ot railroad routes is thirty
two thousand and ninety-two miles, and the
annual transportation thirty million six hun
dred and nine thousand tour hundred and
sixty-seven miles. The length of steamboat
routes is fourteen thousand three hundred
and forty-six miles, and the annual transpor
tation three million four hundred and eleven
thousand nine hundred and sixty-two miles.
The mail service is rapidly increasing
throughout the whole country, and its steady
extension in the Southern States indicates
their constantly improving condition. The
growing importance of the foreign service
also merits attention. The Post Office De
partment of Great Britain and our own have
agreed unon a preliminary oasis ior a new
Postal Convention, which it is believed will
prove eminently beneficial to tbe commercial
interests of the United States, inasmuch as it
contemplates a reduction of the international
letter postage to one-half the existing rates ;
a reduction of postage with all other coun
tries to and from which correspondence is
transmitted in the British mail, or in closed
mails through the United Kingdom ; the es
tablishment of uniform and reasonable char
ges for the sea and territorial transit of cor
respondence in closed mails ; and an allow
ance to each Post Office Department of the
right to use all mail communications estab
lished under the authority of the other for
tbe dispatch ot correspondence, either in
open or closed mails, on the same terms as
those applicable to the inhabitants or the
country providing the means of transmission.
The report of the Secretary of tho Intci
or exhibits the condition of those branches
of the public service which are committed to
his supervision. During the last fiscal year,
four million six hundred and twenty-nine
thousand three hundred and twelve acres of
public land were disposed of, one million
eight hundred and ninety-two thousand five
hundred and sixteen acres of which were en
tered under the homestead act. The policy
originally adopted relative to the public
lands has undergone essential moumcauons.
Immediate revenue, and not their rapid set
tlement, was the cardinal feature of our land
system. Long experience and earnest dis
cussion have resulted in the conviction that
the early development of our agricultural re
sources, and the diffusion of an energetic
Dooulation over our vast territory, are ob-
iects of far greater importance to the nation
al growth and prosperity than the proceeds
of the sale of the land to the highest bidder
in open market The pre-emption laws con
fer upon the pioneer who complies with the
terms they impose the privilege of purchas
ing a limited portion of "unoffered lands"
at the minimum price. The homestead en
actments relieve the settler from the pay
ment ot purchase money, ana secure mm a
permanent home, upon the condition of resi
dence for a terra of years. This liberal poli
cy invites emigration from the old, and from
the more crowded portions of the new world.
Its propitious results are undoubted, and will
be more signally manifested when time shall
havo. given to it a wider development.
Congress has made liberal grants of pub
lic land to corporations, in aid of the con
struction of railroads and other internal im
improvements. Should this policy hereafter
prevail, more stringent provisions will be
required to secure a faithful application of
the fund. Tbe title to the lands should not
nass. bv patent or otherwise, but remain in
the Government and subject to its control
until some portion of tbe road has been actu
ally built. Portions of them might then,
from time to time, be conveyed to the corpo
ration, but never in a greater ratio to the
whole quantity embraced by the grant than
tbe completed parts bear to the entire length
of the projected improvement. This res
triction would not operate to the prejudice
of any undertaking conceived in good faith
and executed with reasonable energy, as 11
is the settled practice to withdraw from mar
ket the lands falling within tho operation ot
such grants, ana tnns to exciuae me uicep
. tion of a subsequent adverse right. A breach
of the conditions which Congress may deem
proper to impose should work a forfeiture of
claim to the lands so withdrawn out nncon
veyed, and of little to the lands conveyed
which remain unsold. - Operations on the
several lines of the Pacific Railroad have
been prosecuted with unexampled vigor and
success. . Should no unforeseen causes of de
lay occur, it is confidently anticipated that
this great thoroughfare will be completed
before the expiiation of the period designa
ted by Congress. .......
Dm tag the last fiscal year the amount paid to
pensioners, including tne expenses ot aiSDurse
inent was thirteen million four hundred and fifty
nine thonsand nine hundred and ninety-six dol
lars ; and fifty thousand one hundred and seventy
seven names were added to the pension rolls. The
entire number of pensioners, Jons 80,1866, was
one hundred and twenty-six thonsand seven hun
dred and twenty-two. - This fact furnishes melan
choly and striking proof of the sacrifices made to
vindicate the constitutional authority of the Fed
eral Government, and to maintain inviolate the
integrity of the Union. They impose upon ns
corresponding obligations. It is estimated that
thirty-three million dollars will be required to
meet the exigencies of this branch of the servios
during the next fiscal year.
Treaties have been concluded with the Indians
who, enticed into armed opposition to our Gov
ernment at tne ruibroak oi uie rebellion, nave
unconditionally submitted to our authority, and
manifested an earnest desire lor a renewal of
friendly relations.
During the year ending September 30, 1866,
eight thonsand seven hundred and sixteen patents
tor useful inventions and designs were issued, and
at that date the balance in tho Treasury to tbe
credit of the Patent fund was two hundred and
twenty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety
seven dollars.
As a subject upon which depends an immense
amount of the production and commerce of the
country, I recommend to Congress such legisla
tion as may be necessary for the preservation ot
the levees of the Mississippi river. It is a matter
of national importance that early steps should he
taken not only to odd to tho efficiency of these
barriers against destructive inundations, but ior
the removal of all obstructions to tbe free and
safe navigation of that great channel of trade and
commerce.
The District of Columbia, under existine laws.
is not entitled to that rcDrcaentation in the Na
tional Councils which, from our earlist history,
nas Deen unilormly accorded to each Territory
established from time to time within our limits.
It maintains peculiar relations to Congress, to
whom tbe Constitution has granted the power of
exercising exclusive legislation over tbe seat of
government Our fellow-citizens residing in the
District, whose interests are thus confided to the
special guardianship of Congress, exceed in num
ber the population of several of our Territories,
and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of
tneir cnoice snoaia net oe admitted to a seat in
the House of Representatives. No mode Beems
so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to
make known their peculiar condition and wants,
and of securing the local legislation adapted to
tbem. I therefore recommend the passage ot a
law authorizing the electors of the District of
Columbia to choose a delegate, to be allowed the
same rights and privileges as a delegate repre
senting a Territory. The increasing enterprise
and rapid progress of improvement in the District
are highly gratifying, and I trust that the efforts
of the municipal authorities to promote the pros
perity of the national metropolis will receive the
etncient and generous co-nperution or Congress.
1 ue report 01 tue commissioner or agriculture
reviews the operations of his Department during
the past year, and asks the aid of Congress in its
efforts to encourage those States which, scourged
by war, are now, earnestly eugaged in tho re

It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign
combinations against our domestic peace and
safety, or our legitimate influence among the na
tions, nave Deen tormeo or attempted, wnue
sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty, aud partiot

The entire success or the Atlantic Telegraph
between the coast of Ireland and the Province of
Newfoundland, is an achievement which has been
justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the open
ing 01 an era in tbe progress ot civilization. There
is re ison to expect that equal success will attend,
and even greater results follow, the enterprise for
connecting the two Continents through the Pacific

The resolution of Congress protesting against
pardons by foreign Governments of persons con
victed of infamous offences, on condition of emi
gration to our country, has been communicated
to the States with which we maintain intercourse,
and the practice, so justly the subject of com
plaint on our part, has not been renewed.
1 ue congratulations 01 uougresa to tne empe
ror of Russia, upon his escape from attempted
assassination, have been presented to that hu
mane and enlightened ruler, and received by him
with expressions of grateful appreciation.
The Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish-American
adventurers to iodnce the emigra
tion of freedmen of the United Mates to a foreign
country, protested against the project as one
which, if consummated, would reduce them to a
bondage even mora oppressive than that from
whictTthcy have just been relieved. Assurance
has been received irom tne Government 01 tne
State in which the plan was matured, that tbe
proceeding will meet neither its encouragement
nor approval. It is a question worthy of your
consideration, whether our laws npon this sub
ject arc adequate to the prevention or punish

In the month of ADrilSast. as Congress is
aware, a friendly arrangement was made between
tne emperor ot ranee and ine rresident 01 tne
United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of
the French expeditionary military forces. This
withdrawal was to be effected in three detach
ments, the first of which, it was understood,
would leave Mexico in November, now past, the
second in March next, and the third and last in
November. 1$7. Immediately upon the com
pletion of tho evacuation, the French Govern
ment was to assume tue same aiuiuue ui non
intervention, in regard to Mexico, as ia held by
the Government of the United States. Repeated
assurances have been given by the Emperor, since
that agreement, mat ne would complete tne
promised evacuation within the period men
tioned, or sooner.
It was reasonably expected that the proceed
ings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of
great political interest in the Republic of Mexi
co. The newly-appointed Minister of the United
States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore seut for
ward, on the Uth day of November lost, to as
sume his proper functions as Minister Plenipo
tentiary of the United States to that Republic
It was also thought expedient that he should be
attended in the vicinity ot Mexico by the Lieu
tenant-General of the Army of the United States,
with the view of obtaining snch information as
might be important to determine the course to
be pursued by the United States in re-establishing
and maintaining necessary and proper inter
course with the Republic of Mexico. Deeply in
terested iu the cause of liberty and humanity, it
seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise
whatever influence we possessed for the restora
tion and permanent establishment in that coun
try ot a domestic and republican form of govern
ment.
Such was the condition of affaire in regard to
Mexico, when, on the 23d of November last, offi
cial information was received from Paris that tbe
Emperor of France had some time before deci
ded not to withdraw a detachment of bis forces
in the month of November cast, according to en
gagement, but that this decision was made with
forces in the ensuing spring. Of this determina
tion, however, the United States hod not received
any intimation; and so soon as the information
was received by the Government, care was taken
to make known its dissent to the Emperor of
France.
1 cannot forego the hope that France will re
consider the subject, and adopt some resolution
in revard to the evacuation of Mexico which will
conform as nearly as practicable with the exist
ing engagement, and inus meet tne just expecta
tions of the United 8tates. The papers relating
to the subject will be laid before you. It is be
lieved that, with tbe evacuation of Mexico by the
expeditionary forces, no subject for serious dif
ferences between France and the United States
would remain. The expressions of the Emperor
and people of France warrant a hope that the
traditionary friendship between the two countries
might in that case oe renewed ana permanently
restored.
A chtim of a citizen of the United States for
indemnity for spoliations committed on the high
seas by tue French authorities, in tbe exercise of
a belligereut power against Mexico, has been met
by the Government of France with a proposition
to defer settlement until a mutual convention for

wars on tnts continent, hiuui uo agrocu uiiuu uy

jeeta, in violation or international law and treaty
obligations, ine delay, nowever. may uo uc
lieved to have resulted iu no small degree from
the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire
change of ministry occurred in that country da
ring the last session of Parliament. The atten
tion ol the new ministry was called to the subject
at an earlv dav. and there is some reason to ex
pect that it will now be considered in a becoming
and friendly spirit. The importance of an early
riitinosition of the onestion cannot be exaggera
ted. Whatever might be the wishes ot the two
Governments, it is manifest that good-will and
frcndshiD between tbe two countries cannot be
established until a reciprocity, in the praotice of
good-faith and neutrality, snau oe restored oe-
tween the respective nations, ;
On tbe 6th of June lost, In violation ol onr
neutrality laws, a military expedition and enter
prise against the British North American Colonies
was projected and attempted to be carried on
wituiu tue territory ana jurutuicviun ui iuc uni
ted State la g.b.ediecs, to. tho obligation im
posed npon the Executive by the Constitution, to
see that the laws are faithfully executed, all citi
zens were warned, by proclamation, against ta
king part in or siding such unlawful proceedings,
and the prjper civil, military, and naval officers
were directed to take all necessary measures for
the enlorcement of tbe laws. T.ie expedition
failed, but it It has not been without its painful
consequences. Some of our citizens who, it was
alleged, were engaged in the expedition, were
captured, and have Deen brought 10 trial, as for
a capital offence, in the Province of Canada.
Judgment and sentence of death have been pro
nounced against lome, while others have been ac
quitted. Fully believing In the maxim of gov
ernment, that severity of civil punishment for
misguided persons who have engaged In revolti-.
tionsry attempts which have disastroueliylailed,
is unsouud and unwise, such representations have
been made to the British Government, in behalf of
tbe convicted persons, as, being sustained by an
enlightened and humane judgment, will, it is
hoped, induce in their cases an exercise of clem-
ency, and a Judicious amnesty to all who were en
gaged in the movement. Counsel bos been em- .
ployed by tbe Government to defend citizens of
the United States on trial for capital offences la
Canada; and a discontinuance of the prosecu
tions which were instituted in the courts 'of tbe
United States against those who took part in the
expeditlou, bos been directed.
- I have regarded the expedition IS not- only po
litical iu Its nature, but as also in s great measure
foreign from the United States in Its cause,
character, and objects. The attempt woe under
stood to be made in sympathy with an Insurgent
party in Ireland, and, by striking at a British
Province on this Continent, wo designed to aid -in
obtaining redress for political grievances which. -it
was assumed, the people of Ireland had suffered
at the bands of the British Government daring at
period of several centuries. The persons engaged
in it were chiefly natives of that country, some of
whom had. while others had not, become dtisen
of the United States under oar general laws ol
naturalization. Complaints of misgovemment Iu
Ireland continually engage the attention of tho
British nation, and so great on agitation Is now'
prevailing in Ireland that the British Government
nave deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of
habeat corpui in that country. These dream-stances-
must necessarily modify, the opinion
which we might otherwise have entertained in re
gard to an expedition expressly prohibited by onr
neutrality laws. So long as those laws remain
upon our statute-books, they should be faithfully
executed, and if they operate harshly, unjustly,
or oppressively, Congress alone can apply tbe
remedy, by their modification or repeal.
Political and commercial interests of the Uni
ted States are not unlikely to be affected in soma .
degree by events which are transpiring In the
eastern regions of Europe, and the time Mens to
have come when our Government ought to havu
a proper diplomatic representation in Greece.
This Government has claimed for all perrons
not convicted, or accused, or susiected of crime,
an absolute political right of self-expatriation,
and a choice of new natiousl allegiance. - Moat of
the European States have dissented from this
principle, and have claimed a right to hold such
of their subjects as have immigrated to, and been
naturalized in, the United States, and afterward
returned on transient visits to their native coun
tries, to tbe performance of military service in
like manner as resident subjects. Complaints
arising from the claim in this respect made by .
foreign States, have heretofore been matters of
controversy between the United 8tates and some
of the European Powers, and the irritation conse
quent upon the failure to settle this question in
creased during the war in which Prussia, Italy,
and Austria were recently engaged.
While Great Britulu has never ocknowledged the
right of expatriation, she has not practically in
sisted npon it. France has been equally forbear
ing; and Prussia has proposed a compromise,
which, although evincing Increased liberality, has
not been accepted by the United States.. Peace
is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the
present Beems to be a favorable time for an asser
tion by Congress of the principle, so long main
tained by the Executive Department, that
naturalization by one State fully exempts the
native-born subject of any other State from tbe
neriormance of milltarv service underanv foreiflm :
Government, so long as be does not voluntarily .
renounce its rights and benefits.
In the performance of a duty imposed npon me
by the Constitution, I have thus submitted to tbe
Representatives of the States and of the People
such information of our domestic and foreign af
fairs as the public interests seem to require, uur
Government is now undergoing its most trying
ordeal, and my earnest prayer Ts, that the peril
may be successfully and finally passed, witboat
impairing its original strength and symmetry.
The interests of the nation are besl to be promot
ed by tne revival of fraternal relations, the com
plete obliteration of our past differences, and tbe
reinauguration of all the pursuits of peace. Di
recting our efforts to the early accomplishment of
these great suds, let as endeavor to preserve har
mony between the co-ordinate Departments of
tbe Government, that each in its proper sphere
may cordially co-operate with the other in secur
ing the maintenance of the Constitution, the pre
servation of the Union, and the perpetuity of onr
lree institutions. ajnukjkw juhnbuh.
