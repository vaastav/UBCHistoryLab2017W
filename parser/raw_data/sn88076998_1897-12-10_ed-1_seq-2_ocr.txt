GBBAT BRITAIN and Ireland have
turned out 54,623,706 gallons of whisky
in 1897, over 6,000,000 gallons more
than in the previous year. Of this 32,
186,938 gallons were consumed in the
United Kingdom and 4,790,181 gallons
exported. There are 198 distilleries at

MBB. FANNIE M. MCKOON owns and
manages one of the largest ranches in
California. It covers 10,000 acres,
about 15 miles from San Diego. Since
her husband's death three years ago,
Mrs. McKoon, although entirely with
out experience at that time,has operat

most successful ranches in the country.
WALTER DARLINGTON, mayor of Con

JUST as naval topedoes will fight our
battles on the high seas, torpedoes
will now be weapons of defense on
land as well. Mr. 6. W. Glinby, of
Brooklyn, has produced an electric tor

torpedoes are long, cigar-shaped pro
jectiles, mounted on rolling trucks.
The machinery to propel them is
operated by electricity, furnished by
(neaps of a wire connecting with the

SHOW statues are the latest form of
artistic freak and their creator is M.
Pierre Roche, a French sculptor of re
pute. The statue is made of copper,
and in the base is a reservoir of lique
fied carbonic acid used to generate the
cold, and the moisture which is ab
stracted from the atmosphere forms on
the surface of the metal as a coating
of snow. in the course of a few mo

by the freezing mixture.
AN old-time swindle seems to have
been revived in a letter from a pretend

a supposititious prison in Spain, who
claims to have buried a large sum of
money near Brazil, Ind. He will give
one-third of the entire amount to any
person who will remit to him by mall
the trivial sum necessary to pay his
beloved daughter's passage from Spain
to the United states and the necessary
expenses of unearthing the treasure.
Who speaks first
OK the approach of a thunder storm
French peasants often make up a very
smoky fire in the belief that safety
from lightning is thus assured. By
some this is deemed a superstition, but
Schuster shows that the custom is
based on reason, inasmuch as the smoke
acts as a good conductor for carrying
away the electricity slowly and safely.
He points out that in 1,000 cases of
damage by lightning 6.8 churches and
8.5 mills have been struck, whilst the
number of factory chimneys has only
been 0.3.
NEW YORK papers mention a rare
case of personal integrity and business
honor which has come to light in that
city. In 1861 Mr. Amos F. Eno was a
member of a firm which failed shortly
after the war began. The stock was
sold, the debts paid pro rata and re*
leases were signed by the creditors.
Now, after 85 years, Mr. Eno is paying
off the balance of all claims, with four
per cent., interest since 1861, amount
ing in the aggregate to about 9500,000.
Such cases as this tend to strengthen
commercial integrity everywhere.
The French have a decidedly prac
tical way of looking at new methods
of locomotion. No sooner was the bi
cycle established than a large revenue
producing tax was imposed on it, and
now it has been decided by the French
authorities to impose a tax on motor
cars, the tax apparently varying in
different parts,according to the density
of the population. In the large cen
ters of population the tax will be a
somewhat serious item, and in Paris it
amounts to 919 on vehicles for two pas
sengers, and 920 on larger vehicles.
THE signal corps of the United States
army now operates about 809 miles of
military telegraphs. The most notable
advance of the year in its system has
been the adoption of a combination tel
egraph and telephone apparatus which
only weighs 16 pounds, and consequent'
ly can easily be carried by one soldier.
With this apparatus one soldier can
telegraph a message to another, while
a telephonic conversation with another
station can be simultaneously carried
on, the distant operators only receiv
ing the messages intended for each.
OCB national post office shows a de
ficit of between 915,000,000 and 916,
000,000 this year, while the English
government has a surplus of about 920,
400,000 annually. The cause of deficit
does not rest with letter postage. That
has always paid its way and substan
tially supported the whole service. The
discrepancy between receipts and ex*
penditures arises from another source.
-The loss to the government by second
class mail matter is scarcely less than
940,000,000 a year, the established rate
for this class being only one-fifteenth
of the actual cost of transmission and

Sketch of the Aired Woman.
Canton, 0., Dec. 3.—At an early hour
Thursday morning Mrs. .Nancy Allison
McKinley, the venerable mother of the
president, was stricken with paralysis,
and her death is believed to be only a
question of a short time. Not since
Mrs. McKinley was stricken has there
been a favorable feature in her condi
tion. That the attack would ultimate
ly end in death was the first fear of the
family on discovering her illness, and
the consultations of the attending pliy
sicians have tended to confirm this be
lief. Every effort is being made to ren
der the patient comfortable, and what
will doubtless prove to be her last ill
ness as free from suffering as possible.
The paralysis, when it first appeared,
was not of a serious form, and seemed
only to have affected her vocal chords.
MRS. NANCY ALLISON M'KINLEY.
She was able to walk from her own
bed chamber to that of her daughter,
Miss Helen McKinley, to give the first
intimation of the attack, and at that
time seemed to be in possession of all
mental and physical faculties, but soon
afterward a change was noticed, and
in the afternoon she sank into a con
dition of semi-consciousness, in which
•he has since remained.
The President Notified.
Mr. Abner McKinley communicated
With the president as soon as he leurned
the serious nature of the illness of his
mother, and the president asked that
he be advised immediately of every
change. Appointments were made for
communication by telephone, and tele
grams were also exchanged frequently.
Boon after noon Mr. Abner McKinley
notified the president that the sufferer
bad lapsed into semiconsciousness
and promised to communicate further
•t five o'clock in the afternoon. The
president did not wait for the five
o'clock message. He responded: "Tell
mother 1 will be there," and at once
prepared to start for Canton.

ate and her intellectual power was truly
wonderful. Her husband died November

son president of his and her country. When
President McKinley entered congress over
SO years ago be was away from his mother
much of the time until he retired from con

In 1891. During his service from 1892 to
1896 as governor he went to Canton fre
quently to visit his mother, and he was

ways located near his- parents and t.ieat
much time with them.]

with Mr. Tuttle formed the firm of Tuttle
& Griggs. A few years later he opened an
office on his own account. He was elected
to the assembly In 1873 and was reelected
two years later. In the latter year the
house was equally divided and he became
leader on the republican side, and this
brought him forward. He was renomi
nated for another term, but was defeated.
He was elected counsel for the board of
freeholders of Passaic county and city
counsel of Paterson, which offices he held
until 1882, when he was elected to the'state

The Collections Are Easy and the
Business Failures Are Steadily
oh the
WA6ES OF MANY EMPLOYES INCREASED.
New York. Dec. 4.—E. G. Dua &Co.,
in their weekly review of trade say:
"The monthly report of failures shows
defaulted liabilities of Jll.GlO.lflS in Novem
ber. against J12.700.SS6 last year. Becausc
of three large failures for $3,250,000 not due
to present conditions the aggregate in No
vember was only $1,100,000 less than last
year, and except for these would have
been smaller than in August. September or
October. The decrease in nearly all
branches of business shows that payments
have been remarkably good and defaults
unusually small. Other 'evidences of the
state of business arc convincing, except In
speculative lines. Wages have been vol
untarily advanced for nearly 30,000 workers
in woolens and Iron.
The Steel Industry.
"Tt ts the season for v-'-'nj in most In
dustries, but at least one other furnace
has gone Into blast, and the lowest price
of Bessemer at Pittsburgh, after pur
chases of 80.000 tons. Is *10.15 per ton, with
(9.25 for gray forge. Eastern holders are
sometimes impatient and yet sure that
January will bring a large demand, and
meanwhile the award of ship plate con
tracts to eastern Arms gives them impor
tant help, though the demand for bars is
slow at the east and at Pittsburgh, but is
really strong at Chicago for agricultural
and railway supplies.
"The voluntary advance of
In wages of worsted workers at Providence,
restoring the rates of 1893, is evidence of
the prosperity, of that manufacture. After
much hesitation in order branches, which
this Important depart
luts itself
nt of the woolen Industry puts
at the front, virtually declaring its ability
to face any foreign competition.
The Wheat Market.
"The wheat market has deceived every
body, dropping in the face of an enormous
foretgn demand just when some advance
might reasonably have been anticipated
The western receipts, 6,882,425 bushels,
against 2,1964,621 last year for the. week, and
for Ave weeks 83,962,529 bushels, against
20,871,456 last year for the same weeks, are
just now more impressive in the market
than the Atlantic exports, which have been
4,187,672 bushels, flour included, for the
week, against 2,079,457 last year, and for
dve weeks 17,617,471 bushels, against 9,817.
153 for the same weeks last year. But In
the long run the outward movement will
affect prices, although the surprisingly
larger Increase at the west indicates a con
siderably greater yield than has been an
ticipated
"Failures for the week have been 306 In
the United States, against 379 last year,
and 28 in Canada, against 55 last year."
Bradstreet's View.
Bradstreet's says:
"General trade throughout the country
has presented rather more animation,
owing to colder weather and the approach
ing holidays. While clothing, dry goods,
hats, shoes and notions, hardware and
fancy groceries have been In a little better
demand from both jobbers and at retail
in the region tributary to Chicago, St.
Ijouis, Omaha, St. Joseph, St. Paul and
Kansas-City, the tendency of .business has
been td. slacken. This Is noticeable in Iron
and steel and In further depression In cot
ton goods, print cloths having m~^e a new
low record in price.
"The appearance of a better demand for
fllllng-in purposes has had a favorable In
fluence at points In Tennessee and the
gulf states. On the Pacific coast the fea
ture of business is the well-maintained
export movement from nearly all ports.
The domestio grain trade continues to
look wtth equanimity on the unprecedented
ly large quantities of wheat exported from
both coasts week after week, the continu
ation of which is an evidence of an appre
ciation of the relation of supply to demand
by the grain trade abroad."

of changing the existing law so that the
banks, and through them the communi
ties in which located, might have the ad
ditional benefit of an added loanable capi
tal has been urged. Despite all this the
law still remains without amendment. Not
only should the bank act be amended in
this particular, but, congr'ss should se
riously consider such a-change in the meth
od of bank note Issues as'-will enable the
banks of the country to more adequately
meet the demands of trade and commerce
in ail sections of the country. The busi
ness of banking, like every other form of
investment, must be made attractive to
capital. If it Is placed upon
a
footing
different from other undertakings, embar
rassed through unnecessary restrictions
and deprived qf proper sources of -ofit,
the result cannot be otherwise '.han that
investable capital will seek other means of
employment, and to such an extent deprive
the people of the benefits of the agency
most requisite to commercial activity.
Would Be Dangerous.
"It has been seriously suggested more
than once that the bank note issues be
done
away with and all paper be issued by the
government instead. The danger of such
a.course is not to be overestimated, xhe
experience of every government has been
that governmental currency paper la a
source of weakness and danger. In the
United• States, where there has been the
nearest approach to success, with the vol
ume of the federal paper comparatively
limited in amount, the credit of the gov
ernment has been more than once put In
jeopardy through It and the business in
terests of the country subjected to unnec
essary loss and confusion.
