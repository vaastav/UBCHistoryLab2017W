THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's message, which
was presented to the Senate and tho
House of Representatives yesterday,
Indicates that tin- chief execiulvo
of tho nation does not Intend lo
take a backward step In regard to
rate legislation. \ large portion of
the 2fi,0(K)-word document submitted
to tin- national lawmaker: was de?
voted io that subject. Mr. Rooho
velt reiterates the suggestion made
in bis las) message upon thin pro!.'
loin, declaring that the most press
Irig need, ko far a-t legislation la
concerned, m "the enactment into
luw of ."oni,. scheme to secure to
the ngento of the government such
supervision and regulation of tho
rates charged by the railroads of
the country engaged in inter-State
traffic ns shall summarily und cf
fcctively prevent the Impostliou ot
unjust or unreasonable rates. 1'
man Include putting a complete
stop to rebates In every shape ami
form. Tills power to regulate rates,
like all ?imllnr powers over the j
business world, should bo exercised
with moderation; cnutlou, ami self
restraint ; but it should exist, sb 'hat!
It can in- effectively exercised whun|
tho need a: lu< is."
The President does hot sceih ;!
have nettled in hlu own mind who
rdiould exorcise the power to which
reference |s made, lie is of tho
opinion, however, that the authority i
should I".- made affirmative and
should bo In the bands of an ad?
ministrative 'jody, aud says that if
the work Is fclvcu to tbo present
Inter-State commerce commission or
to a recognized Intor-Stato coin
merco commission, such commission
should he made uuequivocully admin?
istrative. In support of bis ap
peal for ran- legislation he say*;:
"l ?I?> hot believe in the government
undertaking any Work which can
with propriety bo bit in private
hands, lint u< Ithcr do I bolieva in
tho government Ihm hing from over?
seeing any work when it becomes
evident that abuses are surd to ob?
tain therein unleSH there Is govern?
mental supervision." This sentiment
will appeal to the country at large
whether or not it d"e.s to the mem?
bers of the Senate.
Three matters of special lutercsl
to th'. people oi" Newport News en?

while la- -,\.i; i -.-tilling bb: mos ugc
to Congress. H, again heartily en?
dorses the Ja met; town exposition pro?

make such ail appropriation a, th<
entet prise --. rt bs.
There \vu a report to the effect
that the Pre Id?nt had given Dor..
Htrry St. Oeorge Tucker carte
blanche to put luio tlm message
whatever Inference to th.> James
town exposition ho tin.echt advis?
able. While this) may have been a
child ot tho fancy of some cuter
prising Washington correspondent, :t
is certain thai the gifted president
of the exposition company could not
have written mere cordially of the
enterprise which Is so near to I ho
hearts of tho pcoplo of Tidewater
Virginia, and whatever may bo tin
final outc?mo of tbo movement to
fittingly celebrate the 30Gth anhlver

President Roosevelt touches upon
the necessity for o restoration t?f
the American merchant marine,
again calling attention to the lengthy
report of the merchant marin?.- com?
mission and InfereiUlaUy radon friz
?),>? methods suggested hy that ' im?
portant body. There can be no
doubt about the desirability to again
sending the Stars and Stripes into
the International ports of the world
open merchant steamers. Many per?
rons may lind fault with the com?
mission's pro|>OBed solution of the
problem confronting tho American
merchant murine, hut i; is a signlli
cant fact lhal none of the critics
has yet como forward with a better
plan for bringing about the desired
tilt. Tin- plnu offered has tho ad?
vantage of being constructive rather
than obstructive.
The President thinks that the uavy ?
has a sufficient number uf units and
suggests that future construction
should be limited to a sufficient num?
ber of ship.- to keep the navy up to
Its present standard. With this ob?
ject in view in- thinks that a single
battleship should be built each year.
While paying duo heed to the merits
Of seagoing lorpt do bout destroyers
aim Buhmnrluu vessels, uudcr cer
taiti conditions, Mr. Roosevelt reit?
erates h'- belief that "tho main
streugtli of ili.- navy lies and can
only He in th< great battleships, the
heavily armored, heavily gunned
ships which doch'., tli" mastery of
tho sen." In order to conserve the
eltlclcncy of the navy, ho usk-j for
additional seamen and a larger re?
serve of unval guns, both of which
items deserve the consideration of
the Inwmukliig body.

of tin. President on the issues in?

The Message.
WASHINGTON, 1?. C. Dee. '
Tho President's message in part la
as follows:
Curpiim i i"n ?.
I am In no sense hostile lo corpora*
Hens. This Is an age o( combination, j
i ml any iit'->ri to prevent ?11 corablua-i
lion will be not only useless, but In tbo
end vicious, because .if the contempt
for luw wbivti tin falbire t>> enforce
law Inevitably produces. The Corpora?
tion hug come to stay, Jest as the
trades' union baa vuine to stay. Bach
i ?n ii,< and has done great g kmI. Bach
should I".- favored so i^ng as It doc:'
g tod. But each should be sharply
cl.ked where it acts against law and
Justice.
Experience has skowu conclusively
tiiat it 1? useless to try to y i any ade?
tpjitte regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ne
tb>n. Such regulation and supervision
? ?.in onlj I.ffecttvely exercised by a !
sovereign wh. jurisdiction Is eoex
tensive with the llel i work of Uie cor?
porations -that by the national gov?
ernment. I believe ti:.-i: this regulation
nnd supervision <:m be obtained by the
cnuctmeiil of law by the congress. If
this proves Impossible, it will certainly
l u necessary ultimately to confer hi '?
fuilest f< rih such power upon 'ho nn
lloual goverumont by aftlrmatlvo ne
inent of "lie constitution.
Tbe inwt of the congress and of the ,
several -.tates hitherto, as passed upon
by the court -. have resulted mere often
iti showing that tho states have no I
l ?wer in the matter 'ban that tho na?
tional government has |ibwer; so that
there tit present exists n very unfortu- '
nate condition of things, under which |
these great corporations doing nn In
tci>*tate business occupy the position of
subjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor the national '
government having effective control]
over them, Our -toady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered ?
In, t,> nssert the sovereignty of tbe ha
Bonn) government by affirmative ne- >
Hon.
This is onlj In form an Innovation.
In substance It Is met iy n restoration,
for from Ihe earliest time such regula?
tion of Industrial activities has been
recognized In the action of tbo law- <
Uinklng Inxiics, and all that 1 propose
is to meet tie- changed conditions in'
such mat ner as will prevent the com- i
pionwcalth abdicating ihn power It has '
always possessed, not only in this conn- I
try, but also In England before and
since, this country liecnme a separate
nation. i
l(Allr<m>) Hute l.<T>Kinlittion.
As 1 said hi my messi.^o of Dec. ''?
last, the immediate and most pressing
need So far as legislation is concerned
Is the enactment into law of some
Bflieme t<- icouro lo the agents of tho
government such supervision nnd regu
luttoii of the rates charged by Ihe rail
rends of the country engaged in inter i
?stale truth'- as shall summarily and ef- t
(actively prevent the in.position of un- (
just or unronsouable rates. It must
Include putting a complete stop i" re
bates in every sb:t|ie and form, Xlilt
power to regulate rates, like nil slmllnr
powers over Ihe business world, should
be'exercised wltli moderation, eaulloh
and self restraint, bill It should exlsi
so that u can be effectively exercised
when the le-iHl ?rii >? .
In my Judgment, the ni<>',t important
provision which such law should con
tniu is that conferring upon some com?
petent administrativ! body the power
to deckle upon tho cuse being brought
before li whether n given rate pre
Bcrlbed by n railroad is reasonable and
Just, and if l? \r found t-> bo unreason?
able and unjust then, after full luven'
gat Ion of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rate beyond which it shall
n'jt be lawful t" go- tbo maximum
reasonable rate, as it Is commonly <-a,i
?1?this decision to g i into effect with?
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject t.. review
by the courts.
It sometlmcd hnppelis at present, n ?;
that a rale is too high, but that n fn
vorcd shipper i- given t?o low a rate.
In such cane |he coinmls?ie-n would
have the i i^lit to tlx this already estab
llsbcd uiiuttuum rate as tbe maximum, ;
ami it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to euro '
railroad com panics of th-; practice of]
giving lrnpro|)er uiinimut i rate?. I call
your attention to the fact that, my pro
posal Is not to give the commission
power to initiate or originate rates gen
er ally, bur to regulate a rate a I read}
fixed or originated by the roads upon
complaint aud after investigation. A
heavy penalty should be exacted from
auy corporation which tails to respect
an ordrr of the commission. 1 regard
tbi-i power t" establish a maximum
rate as being essential to any schema
of real roforni in the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
It would no* wl3C to confer en the
government fee right of civil action
pgainst tbe benoflciary of n rebato for
ut least twice the value of the rebate.
'Ihi.- would help stop win! le really
blackmall. Elevator allowances should
bo stopped, for they have now g,-o<r,i
to such nn extent that they are demor?
alizing and are used as rebates.
Prti h i.- Car Linen.

this way cun violations or evasions of
Um- law bo surely detected. A system
of examination of railroad account
eh >nld bo provided similar to that now
conducted Into the national banks by
