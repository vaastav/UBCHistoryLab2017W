There is no; subject, remarks a co

that of local taxation ; there is no
burdefi Inat jkeises ' upoa them so
lieavily as that of local taxation ; jet
there is iiot perhaps a single subject
upon which tt'cy pr? more t! or Ujly

pi essd both upon the resources and
industry of our people--of these they
know comparatively little or nothing.

wis!io3 to ".'.nscertr.in these facts and
ask the local authorites, he will boo i
discover that ' ho Jias propounded ; a
problem which they .either will not or
can not solve-Nor can the Auditor
of State, with jajl the machinery at
his command, obtain a much more
rsatislaetory answer to the interoga
tor v tha'tt cart the private citizen.
Yet it is obvious that without these
fact the citizens can not know how
to intelligently direct his efforts for
self relief, nor can the General As
sembly know how to legislate intel
ligently for retrenchment and reform.
The citizen feels " the burden, but
kuows not how to begin shaking it
off. ;.'J"Jie Legislature hears , the cry
A' the people for relief, bnt can nei;
her tell 'where the burden presses
most' heavily; nor what portion may
most juliciocslj- be removed.
This is a matter that calls for en
'rgt-tic action on the part of the
General Assembly. ' The latter should
require each year a full and detailed
t xhibitot all the facts . connected
with local (especially municipal) tax
ution ; and far any refusal or neglect
to report these facts, on the part of
tich.ii local authoriteis, it should pre-"

Auditor Of State the executor of the

1870,' show a slight decrease. The
ust Legislature, although it did not

From the New York Time.?.
.. Mre invite for the President's policy the
cindid eriticism of all, and wo are inucii
mistaken if the moat exacting can find in
it any recommendation or oversight on
which to base serious complaint. It will
strengthen the intelligent laitb of the

From the New York Tribune.. ., .
On the whole, we lind much more to
. approve than to condemn in this message
and lelieve that it will be favorably re
garded by a large majority otthe Aiueri-
c:n people. ,
From the 5Tcw York Herald. "
. ; To sum np this niessajre : As an expo
sition of the doings of the adniiuis.ra-
tion in the manasremcnt of all the vast
concerns of the several departments" of
the government, on tho'lan l and the
water, at home and abroad, durinir the
var which is now closing, it is a good
exhibit of a faithful execution of the
laws, an honest disposition of the public
money, and a rigid punishment ot public
delaultei-3. In 'the next place, themes
sage in its recommendation to Congress
co ers a budget of legislative measures
and refoim-. necessary, whlisme in
their character. In a word, whether
considered as embodying the views of a
statesman ambitious only to promote the
material 'prosperity and moral advance
ment of his country, or as' apolitical
campaign document from a candidate
for another presidential term, this mes
sage is well calculated to stre'ngtl en Gen.
Grant an I to weaken his adversaries
throughout the United States. .- '
From the Xew York Standard.
The President meets every question
presented r to r the 'minds of' the
American'1 people in a fair and
candid manner, ilis recommendations
are in nearly all respects wise and pro-,
gresssve. and the country will see in
them thai we have a President who is no
less wise in peace than be was illustri
ous in war. .
From the Xew York World. ..
There U in this message, as in most
messages, a great deal of mere dry reci
tal, such as the chief clerks ol the depart
ment are . capable of furnishing, and
which the alert newspaper correspond
ents anticipated while the events are
etill fresh and had the character of news.
The a'lusion to the Chicago d s ister. in
1'ie introductory paragraph, would have
been appropriate, had it been well ex
pressed ; b it nobody expects Grant to
employ language with the lituess and
precision of a -Webster. It has too. long
been evident that the Preside nt of the
United States can not write tolerable
English.
From the Philadelpeia Press.
When in any State paper every sen
tence is a text, it is difficult to .write
upon it within the limits of a newspaper
article. This is most emphatically the
case with the President's message. It is
a model business paper a compression
of facts that read like an invoice. Every
word nnans something and every sen
tence tell or suggests "something.." It is a
paper, clear, comprehensive, : and ' con
cise, which every voter can and ought to
read, and than this no higher praise can
beawarJcd., . .....
From the Tolatfo Bla lc.
We have not time to give our views in
full. Out only to express our entire fa";i3
f tction witu this important State piper.
From the Chicago Journal.
No candid person can read the third
annual message of President Grant with
out admiring the general spirit that per
vades it, or approving its scntiufents and
recommendations.. There is nothing
parti -an or narro.w In it, ami its general
tone it-that of peace and good will, while
it3 suggestions are grounded in iustice
and patriotism.
One other remark is here admiasable.
This message is as free from dryness in
matter as it is trom narrowness of smrit.
No language is wasted, and no attempt
made at rhetorical disulav. The President
"speaks right on" in a clear manner,
straightforward style, and after stating
in me leweso possible words, all that was
required to be said and his rhetoric has
the merit oi Deispicuitv as well as tend
erness 1 e dismisses the subject. There
is no mistaking bis meaninsf. and there
is no tirins out of the reader's patience.
Fiom tha Chicago i'ost.
It is a document whose sterling good
fense, compactness of statement, sound
ness or principle, and wisdom of sugges
tion, v, ill not only refay perusal, but
will invite the approving thuugl.t of
every citizen of the United States. The

ble woj-ds ; , r
To say that the message is one of the
ablest documlnts ever presented by and
American executive, is to rendej it great
praise, but ot the meed which is it
entire due. The citizen who can see
partisanship in its sentiment, must in
deed, liave eyes coated , with prejudice.
It touches every topic of value to the
nation, and displays in its every line a
clearness of thought, and nprig'i tn jss of
pnriose, ind'a breadth of treatment
which no citizen can fail to coiniuem'.
It will command the 'profound attention
and tne unqualified respect, n t only of
the people of the United States, but of
ri.(o ot every nation with whom we have
zelat jiis.
From the Chicago Tribune. .
The President's message, so far as we
can t iscntanglc it from the confusion in
wh'ch the telegraph gives it to us seems
to be a more creditable document than
any of President Gran'3 previous com
munications. It is more methodical
than any ot iiis former deliverances, and
contains none ot those enigmatical pas
sages which confounded the learned and
unlearned alike, in l is list annual and
in many. Df his special messages.
From the Lafayette (lnd) Journal.
It is an exceedingly creditable docu
ment. Its views and recommendations
are, in the main, charecterized by prac
tical good sense and srgacity. There is
no nonsense about it iiom uttiningto
end.- The President writs as an execu
tive, and not as a legislator He has no
policy schemes to: violently enforce at
the expense of the public.
From the Lafayette Courier.
No State paper has 'eyer emanated
from the executive mansion' in .which
there is so littU? to conJem, and so much
to approve, as that which was transmit
ted to the two lieuses of Congress.
(. Since President Grant's message,
touching the CiviJ Ser vice Tdriflj and
Amnesty we do not see why the jvew
departuriet in the Democracy should
not take him np as a candidate. lie
surely is sound oa these topics and
it'ie great line and.cry of Democratic
jreformers is to bring about hopisty
in office holders and to reduc.e taxar
tion by the tariff, and to let bveones
be jby-jroneg. .
Senator Trumbull's Views.
ir-"",.' WismxGTOK, Drc. 3.
I have just had detailed to me, by a
prominent South, ri politician, the
particulars of a conversation, had
within the last day or two, with
Senator Trumbull, of Illinois. My
informant, who is himself rn x
United States Senator, states that he
met Judge Trumbull in the library of
Congress, and that, after exchanging
friendly salutations, he asked the
Senator whether he woild consent to
the nse of his name a a conservative
candidate against Gjneral Grant.
The Illinois si t m n replied with
more than usual emphasis :
'No, sir, I would not."
'And why noti"
"For many reasons." Judge Trum
bull said in substance: "In the first
place 1 am satisfied where I am. I
consider a seat in the Senate of the
United States a position in which I
can be more useful than any other,
and I believe it to be as honorable as
any under the Government, if its
duties be efficiently and properly dis
charged. In the next t lice, I do not
agree with the programme which has
been marked out by those who refuse
to support the candidacy of the
President for re-election. lam con
ECtous of the reed of many reforms,
and I am daily striving to accomplish
them. But I'do not believe that a
revolution of parties would be salu
tary. I do not believes either the
people of the North or South are
readv to profit by such a change."
"And why not"?"
- "Because the people of the South
haVfl really accepted nothing and are
not Wiling to co-operate with the
liberals Cr the North in settling he
practical relations of socieity on . a
sure and geusrous basis. I know
that the South has much to complain
of.. But so have the liberal Republi
cans. It is not tht rebel element,
perhaps, but the nature of filings, that
the South should not realize .he com
plete overthrow of the old oni'r and
the necessity for a complete cvJnge
of the domestic policy . I behCve
that the defeat of Gen. Grant wouhi
involve a reaction in the South, whose
consoquences would be even worse
than the present state of affairs."
"Don't you think General Grant
meditates the permanent usurpation
of the Executive office ?"
"No, I do not ' ' My opinion is that
Generul Grant is, in the main, a con
srrja'.ive man. He has made mistakes.
But I ( a i not say they justify his re
moval." 1 "Wlak. are your personal rela
ijns ?"
'Very friendly. - I have opposed
some of his measures; but I have no
personal feeling against him, and, in
deed, tbi is one of the reasons why
t is i isa rreeable to have my name
meitoned in the connection you
name."
"The Southern Democracy would
support you with pleasure."
"You aro mistaken. The Democ
racy is yet too strong in numbers to
disband, for that 3 the meaning of
the passive poMer. Three million of
Democratic voters can not afford to
sell themselves to two or three hun
dred thousand Republican voters, and
that for a mess of pottage which the
Republicans and not the Democrats
are to enjoy. I don't believe they
will do it. I think the passive policy
already a failure."
'Like the new departure?"
"No, not exactly. The new depirt
nre was' a necessity, win or lose. Had
the Democrats not adopted it, but in
its place had adopted the platform ol
18G8, they would have been still more
disastrously beaten. The new depart
ure made no recruits because the peo
ple did not believe it honest. The
Democratic party leaders did wha
ihey could no longer avoid that is,
accept the amendments and the Re
publicans have to thank such writers
as Mr. Stepehs acd Mr, Forsythe that
tue step in advance did not make
further inroads. By 1876 the issues
of the war, the amnendments and the
Ku Klux will be out of the way, and
the:e may be a new and complete re
organization of parties. But not
now." -
What do yoa " think of t le . Ku
Klux?"
'They may be exaggerated. Eu
mere is enough ot unpunished vio
lence at the South to justif v the news
papers in all they are making. This
alone would beat tbe Democracy."
lhen yon think the- fight next
year will he a straight-out partv
affair?" -
I think it will lie as far as tbe Re
publicans are concerned. The party
is not really divided. Its internal
discussions merely exhibit the exer
cise of individual free will and do il
good and no harm. It will act as a
body, and I think will poll a larger
vote than it didii. T8C8, no matter
what liame-work cr what candidates
arc opposed to it. The people believe
in the republican party on account ol
its liberal discussions."
I am assured in saying that the
opinions of Senator Trumbull are also
the opinions of Senator Sumuer.
