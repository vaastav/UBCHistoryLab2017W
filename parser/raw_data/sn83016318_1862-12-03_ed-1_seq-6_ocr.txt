' The New York 7im a few days since,
published from semi-official sources, a
large nuaiber of documents, relating tb the
recent expulsion of the notorious French
hanker, Jcckci , from the Mexican Capital
by tho authorities. The details of the gi
gantic fraud, known as the Jecker liond
transactloiv which lias been the real motive
of the French invasion o f Mexico, is pro
bably fresh in the minds of all. Zuloaga
and Miramon, during their struggle against
Juarez, and their, temporary occupation of
the Mexican Capital, issued bonds ou the
Mexican Government to the amount of
75,000,000, and sold them ut an enormous
liscount to the French banking firm of
Jecker & Co., the actual advance being
only about $700,000. Tho bonds were
iiiitnediatuly bought up at this chea price
by many ot tho French magnates, and be
came the principal lever in bringing on the
expedition against Mexico. Of course,
Jnarc, on his assumption of authority,
denied tho validity of the bonds, and dc
nwUnced tho whole as a gigantic fraud
fhe French Government, whilo it had not
the ctl'rontry to assign tho repudiation of
Jecker bonds, as tho direct reason for its
course, nevertheless embraced them iu its
claims and took open issuo on this subject
with Juarez. The machinations of Jecker
and Ms associates, working on the cupidity
and ambition ot the French nobles, had a
powerful effect In hastening the crluls and
lh) commencement, ol actual hostilities.
t'nder Uiose circumstances, and after the
infraction of all treaties, aud violation of
all the principles of international dealing ou
the part ot the French, it is to be wondered
at i hat tho Mexican Government permitted
Jecker and his assoclaU b to remain within
the confines of the Mexican Republic for a
aitigle instant. However, their presence
was tolerated at the Mexican Capital, till a
few weeks since, and during all this timo
they have never ceased their intercourse
and plotting with the invading French, and
llw renegade Mexicans, whd seek persoual
advantago from the ruin of their country.
Finally, the Interception of important
correspondence, and tho consequent
ruvelailoua continue 1 tho suspicions
of the Mexican authorities and Jecker with
six of bis associates were peremptorily ban
ished from the State. Thercuiwn, tho
diplomatic representatives of tho various
nations, assembled in Mexico, adopted a
most strange course of proceeding. A
Joint letter of protest, beaded by Minister
Oorwln, was handed In to tho Mexican
Minister, demanding tho reason for tho ex
pulsion. The Mexican Minister In a very
able reply, regretted that tho foreign Mids
tcrs had not confldcnco in the rectitude of
the Mexican Government, and assured
them that he was pos ssesned of abun-
danco of cvidenco to justify the measures
bo had tukeu. With this smwer Mr. Cor
win! to his credit be it said, seems to have
lieen content but Barvu Wagner, the
1'rusHian envoy, continued tho correspond
ence In an insulting letter, demanding iudi
fial proof of the allegations made, and
closing with the extraordinary threat, as 1
peaking in behalf of tho French Govern
jneut, that "ho should hold the members
of the Government responsible for all tho
losses and Injuries to the parties interested.''

ishment that the ) 'ruasian Minister refused
I j recognize the existence of the President
of the Federation and intended to hold tho
members ol the Oovcn. ment Individually
responsible for their ollieial acts, and very
properly closed by informing tho Baron
lhat no further proceedings of his in favor
of the French subjects would bo recognized,
as in such instances ho overstepped tho
limits of his c .mmlssion. Five days after,
notwithstanding, Baron Wagner sent to the
Government the protest of Jecker against
his banishment, which the Miuistcr refused
fo receive, as being an Inhtilt to the dignity
of the Republic. ,
At this point tbo oiliuiai correspond uco
ceased, and It, together with the intercepted
letters, on which tho action in tho Jeeker
matter was based, have beeu gived publici
ty by tho Mexican Government through the
American press. The position taken and

mint is admirable in all respects.

he has long since repented of hi i Inconsid

events without giving a few extracts from
tho intercepted correspondence, showing
the French animus and also containing a
few allusions to the United btaUs.
