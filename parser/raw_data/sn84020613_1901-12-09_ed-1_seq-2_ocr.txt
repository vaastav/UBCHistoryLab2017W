SECOND CLASS MAIL MATTER
In hla annual report, the postmaster
general discusses at length the Impo
sition up'm the poHtal service resulting
from tha abuso of second class man
privilege. In a clear and convincing
iv hp shows that reform Is urgently
nifilnri nrnvlslon for which can be
marie by congress th tough proper
changes In the postal law
Second c acs matter Is made up
rhlefly of newspaper and other publt-
ration, and the amount of postage
due In a riven case Is determined by
the weight of the matter sent out. It
I a good law. but unrortunateiy u is
open to abuse through loose Inter
pretatlons rnd construction.
The result Is that thousands of pub
lications whlrh are not genuine per
iodicals wiihln the Intent of the law
are registered a second clas matter
and thus receive the benefit of the
low nnstai.. Many of these, so called,
periodicals consist of book that are
represented to belong to a aeries, but
that reallv have no connection with
one another except In the desire of
their nubllshers to secure cheap post
age. Others aro advertising chejne.
whlih under the guise of genuine per
iodical and with the pretense of hav
Ing bona fide circulation obtain the
benefit of second class mall rates.
The postmaster general estimates
that the r-elght of all second class
matter Is throe-fifths of the total
weight carried by the department, and
that the cost of transporting and
tinnrillnir it Is onefouith the total tost
of the nostal eervlce. The cost of
the mails for the last fiscal year was
S11S.RSI.tf20, one-fourth of which I
f28.8K8.730. But the department col
lected on serond clas matter only
14.294.285. This was about all times
more than the deficit shown between
the total cost and the total revenuea
iif the department.
DESIRE A REPUBLIC.
The desire of tho Cubans, aa report'
d by Oovernor General Wood, for a
republic, even If It should last only a
week, la natural. After being In
bondage to Spain for centurlee and
having acquired their freedom, with
the assistance of a neighboring and
friendly country, it would gratify a
large proportion of the inhabitants of
the Island to aee the lone star nag or
Cubra Libre float over the towns and
fortification ao lately reacued from
the Castilian power. Hut It la a true
now a !t ever was that the natural
trend of event Is toward annexation
and that the best Interest of the Is
land demand ultimate union with the
Vnlted States.
On November 1 there were 259 blast
furnaces In operation In the Vnlted
states, with a weekly output of 320.824
tons. This at the rate of 18.650.000
tons per year, which is a larger output
than that of Great Britain and Ger
many combined. It Is a great change
In seven years; for. In 1896. the pig
iron production of Great Britain ex
uded that of the United State.

ARTESIAN WATER.
Flow Struck In the Rio Grand Valley
Above Engl.
New wa received In La Cruce
yesterday of the striking of artesian
water on the waauingnam lanns on
the Armenilarla grant, about eight
mile northwest of Engle.saya the Don"
Ana County Republican. The new
excited great Interest here, as It
strengthens the conviction held by
many cltUnns. and, Indeed, by govern
ment experts who have looked the
valley over, that an artesian flow can
be had anywhere In the valley.
The flow above Engle was struck
by parties prospecting for coal In the
Interests of the Santa Fe railroad
Experts report the existence there at
the dep'h of 1,000 feet of coal field
from 40,000 to 60,000 acre In extent
and about two weeka ago a diamond
drill was put at wo. k, with thl most
Interesting and Important result.
The flow was struck at a depth of
200 feet, and It runs 2.000 gallons per
hour. The place where the drill was
sunk I in the foothill of the San
Chrlstobal mountains, and It I a rea
sonable Inference that. If the drill had
been put down at a point nearer the
river, where the altitude 1 less, the
flow would be Rtronger. Engle I about
800 feet higher than Las Cruces.
Further developments will be watched
with pro.'ound Interest.
