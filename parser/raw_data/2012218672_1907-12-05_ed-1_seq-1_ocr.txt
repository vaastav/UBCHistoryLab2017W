D cember of the drifting snow
And yule-Jog blizing brighh
A December, w-hen the cold winds blom
Across the fields of white;
W hen winter's ring ia in the grount
And nights are clear and still,
And the boys go belly-buster dawu
The slick and shiny hill.
December of the Christmas t.re
And childhoods brightest dream;
December of the ecstacy
Of hallowet Christmas e'en;
When the last sweet lullaby is sung
Aud children's whispers cease.
And the wee sweet stocking. all ar(
strung
Along the nantel piece
December of the drum and horn
And bundles slyly hid;
December of the one great morn
Of mornings for a kid;
When chime, of sweet and mellov
bells
Are weloming the dawn,
And the house rocks with the merr,
yells
Of kids with )ig hties on.

If they are sick or out

Pains, achesandrheu

kidney trouble.
Kidney trouble cauces quick or unsteady
heart beats, and mnakes one feel as though
they had heart trouble. because the heart is
over-working in pumping thick, kidney

It used to be considered that only urinary
troubles were to be traced to the kidneys,
but now modern science proves that nearly
all constitutional diseascs have their bcgin

li you are sick you can make no mistake
by first doctoring your kidneys. The mild
and the extraordinary effect of Dr. Kilmer's

soon realized. It stands the highest for its

Another 'statement by Mr. W. R.

is as follows: "I have had stom#acbs
trouble for years, and anyone who I
afflicted this way knows what an awtf3
