tors towards making a new District in Sontb ii
Carolina. The nuuie proposed is Calhonn. a
The locality is around Aiken, consisting of a
parts of Edgefield, Barnwell, and Orange
burg Districts. The argument in favor of ^
the measure is that most parts of the local,
ity in question are from twenty to thirty .
miles from their present Distriotcourt houses. 11
The objectioo to it is the additional expense 3
of the organization. The present number of d
Districts in the State is tbirty-one. p
I The Fence Laws. u
k The wedge has been introduced upon ^
this matter. The Legislature has in hand
B a measure looking towards reform in the D
m laws relating to fences At present, the a
? fenoe-owner is required to keep up a lawful n
I fence; and if he do not do so, trespassing ^
upon bis fields cannot be properly punished.
Tke near mnvoment is to bind the Stock
owner to keep his stock in place, and pat &
the responsibility of trespass upon him in- v
stead of apoa the fence-owner. The Dew
law proposed is that whioh prevails, wc f
believe, all over Europe ; and mast, sooner
or later, become a law onto Americans.
Th9 Usury La*v8.
This formidable strong-hold of old-fogy- v
ism?this fort in the defenoe lines of anti- s
progress?this mill-stone about the neck of 0
free-trade?is no more io Sooth Carolina.
The old thing died hard. The battle for 1
protection was obstinate and vigorous. The 0
battery was maooed with veterans, and they ii
plied their guns heroically. The old men p
^ of the Legislature fought for the old Usury
B Lawsj but the day of such laws was past,
M an*d the inexorable mandate of progress de- 0
W mended their repeal. They have been re- 1
1 pealed; and in that act, we feel assured i*
' that South Carolina has taken a wise step, 8
and one that will manifest its expediency
and justice more the loDger it is tried.
Beconstruction.
We are told by a friend recently from *
Hilton Head, that at the late sales of laods 1
to pay taxes much magnamimity was showo ^
by northern capitalists towards those whose
lands were so sold Lands worth fifteen or .
twenty thousand dollars were bidden off by 11
their owners at one or two hundred dollars 1<
?enough to cover the taxes?while north- 1
ern capitalists stood by with thousands in e
their pockets This appears to have been
doDe in a spirit of conciliation, principally ^
by those who have come to the south to make r
:* tkalu fnfnro heme The nnliav of such 2
lb "??? 1 J ?
a course is far sighted, and deserves to be
appreciated as we have do doubt it is. h
Dancing. t
The style of dancing, with us, varies c
considerably. Hitherto the quadrille or li
square dances have prevailed in Columbia r
Lcs Landers has held its place as the s
favorite of the square dances for seven or
eight years; and a large majority of ladies ti
have refused to take part in the round dau- o
ces, while they have been danced by a few t
from time immemorial.
Now, however, the glory and supremacy v
of the square dances are giving plaoe to the t
round ; or, at least, the round are far more I
extensively prevailing now. Some years ii
ago the cards of a partie dansante would g
contain a dozen square dances and two or
three round dances; but dow theso cards q
are either equally divided between the c
round and the square, or the former are in
majority. h
Still, and in the face of this evidence of t
a changing taste in such matters, there are o
large numbers of parents and many young t
ladies who invariably refuse to take part in t
I the round dances. t
' A Frenchman was once asked if be t
thought round dances objectionable, aod v
he replied: "For my sons, no; for my a
daughters, yes." a
And there is a good deal in the Frenchman's
reply. '
We feel no disposition to sit as umpire c
for the opposing parties to the issue. 8
As we belong to the sex upon whom ^
there is no interdictory injunction laid, it c
might seem invidious in us to express a 1
preference either way.
The fact is, however, that the dizzying f
German Waltz and the dashing Redowa 1
are superceding the graceful variety of the c
Polish Lancers and the time honored sim- ^
plicity of the good old uotuuoo.
Board at the University. 8
Now that the annual session of the State '
University is about to open (first Monday a
in January) we take occasion to recur to 1
our suggestions cf economy in the item of '
board. *
If the student wishes to economize, and
is not ashamed of economy, we ask his at- *
tention to our suggestion. 0
Board at the boarding-houses now costs! c
from five to eight dollars a week. If the j
student will arrange with some cook in the p
neighborhood of the Campus, he can have
his meals sent to his room three times a day c
at an expense of from two to three dollarsj a
a week?less than half, little more than ! c
one-third, of the boarding house rates.? | '
We speak from personal knowledge when j c
we say that one man can get board?good, | 1
who'esome, and sufficient food?sent to his [
room three times daily, for three dollars a J 1
week. A club of four we believe oould get j 1
the same for ten dollars a week, which is ! [
two and a half dollars each a week. We 1
further believe that if a club of four or;
more would take the trouble to buy their i
own provisions and give tbem out to be K
cooked and sent iu to their room, the cost j (
per week would be two dollars each a week, t
or less. And, further, if a student will buy f
his own provisions and prepare them him- (
pelf, as ho can do (if he has not missed a t
good lessou in the army), he can live upon ! t
... very little over one dollar a week. This j f
last is extreme economy, to be sure; but it \
s better living than thousands of the b(
tudeuts in Germany live on. We can i
s well as the German, if we will but g
id of a lot of fulse pride that embarrass
is in such matters.
We have spoken, not having the fear
loarding house keepers before our cyei
nd we have dooe so because we feel th
;etting an education far outbalances t
ittle matter of some personal inoonvenien
nd false pride. We urge these matte
ipon the consideration of the youth of t
ountry in the present impoverished oont
ion of our unhappy country; and we ur
hem upon the attention of every pare
rbo has a sou to educate, and who has fi
he heavy hand of war upon his peounia
esources. The truth that we are poor
alpable in all its glaring ugliness ; and
s but the part of true manhood to square
ccept that truth, and to shape its oour
nd policy accordingly.
CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDING
The thirty-ninth Congress assembled
Is second and last session, on Monday, tl
d instant. Soaroely bad the prelimina
uties of organizing for business* been cor
leted, before the cloven-foot manifested i
biquitous presence. Sumner moved
ake up bis old hobby?the bill to establii
egro suffrage in the District of Columbiarhiob
after some disoussion, was decid<
ot in order. A resolution was also intr
luced asking the President to communica
o the Senate, what action had been tak<
y the French Government, in complian
nth the demands relating to Mexioo.
The message of the President, printed
ull on our outside pages, was then pr
anted.
In the House, a bill was introduced pr
iding that every subsequent Congre
hould meet at noon on the 4tb of Man
f each year. This bill looks to the osta
ishment of a permanent Congress, who
bjeot will be to bold in oheck the appoit
Dg prerogative of the President. As
art and parcel of this proceeding, Steve:
trodaced a bill to regulate removals fro
ffice. It provides against removals whi
no Sons to ia in gpsijtnn And this hrw
i by the previous bill to be in perpetu
ession, no removals whatever can be mai
mhout its consent.
Bills to create a department of latere
tevenue; to authorize the Secretary of t!
treasury to sell, at auctioo, two millions
;o!d per week j to regulate the mode
roceedings in trials of impeachment, we
Qtroduced and referred. Elliott ask<
;ave to introduce a bill to repeal the Act
862, granting power to the Executive

aged in the late rebellion. On motion, tl
ules were suspended, by a vote of 111

In the Senate, Sumner gave notioe th
e would introduoe resolutions declarii
he power of Congress on the subject of i
oustruction, and the right to exclude tl
ate rebellious States from Congtessioc
epresentation, and from voting on tbe co
titutional amendments.
Chandler moved, but the Senate refuse
o take up the House bill to amend the a
f 1862, so as to take away the power
be Presideut to grant amuesty.
Wentworth introduced a resolution, whii
?as adopted, insisting upon the adoption
he constitutional amendment before tl
louse will consider the propriety of gi
Dg Southern States representation in Co
;re88.
A resolution was adopted, direoting i
[uiry as to the expediency of repealing ti
otion tax.
The House Committee on the Judicia
ave reported, against repealing so much

ees, respectively, of Indian Affairs, Pos
ifficeand Patents. No Committees arc nc
leaded by the friends of the Administrate
Mr. Williams offered a resolution i
tructing the Committee on Retrencbme
o inquire to what extent the President h
, right to restore confiscated property und
he laws of the United States, aud if su<
a ws exist, to what extent they oan be exec
ed, ?fec. Adopted.
Mr. Trumbull moved to take up the B
o repeal the President's amnesty powt
,nd to refer it to the Committee on the J
liciary.
This gave rise to debate, ai the concl
ion of which the Bill was referred
Mr. Suuiner offered the resolutions on i
lonstraction, of which he gave notice. Th
issert the right of Congress over the subjc
>f recoustruotiou, and deny the right of t
ately rebellious States to pass upon t
institutional amendments. The rcsolutio
vere read and ordered to be printed.
In the House, Mr. Williams, of Penusj
rania, called up the Bill of last session 1
he regulation of appointments to, and i
uovals from office, and addressed the Hou
n advocacy of the Bill.
The House Bill repealing the pardonii
)ower of the President, was taken u
Trumbull moved that it be referred to t
Committee on the Judiciary, which w
tarnestly opposed by Chaudler, who call
or the yeas and nays, on the motion j sot
liscussion ensued, during which, Chandl
nade assertions and oharges respecting t
ise of tbe pardoning power, which call
brth an emphatic denial from Mr. Dixc
yho said that if tbo charges whiob Chan
ist ler had made against the President were
do true they would render him liable to im
et peaohment He repeated the deoiai of any
iea of the ohargps or practices spoken of After
some further remarks, the Bill was re- i
of ferred to the Committee on the Judioiary.
i ; Mr. Sumner offered a series of resoluat
tions, declaring the principle of recoostruche
tion; the jurisdiction of Congress over the
oe whole subject; tbe illegality of the existing
>ra Governments in the South, and tbe exolube
sioD of each States with such illegal Govli
ernments from Congressional representation,
ge and from voting on tbe constitutional ant
mendments.
?lr. Thev also declare that it id the duty of
ry Congress to prooeed with the work of reis
construction, and to this eDd itmust assume
it jurisdiction over the States lately in rebelly
lion, except so far as that jurisdiction may
se nave been renounced, and must recognize
only the loyal States as entitled to representation
and to vote on the constitutional ag
mendment Ele said he would not discuss
. * the resolutions, but would read a letter from
a friend in Texas, showing the importance
of the matter, which be did, and after conry
eluding made some oharacteristio remarks
a. The resolutions were ordered to be printed. ,
its The House passed a Bill providing that
in all oases where a citizen of the United
States, who always remained loyal thereto
and did not voluntarily give any aid or en?
couragemeut to any person engaged in the
e(] rebellion, shall bring aa action for damages
for injaries to person or property or the
value thereof, no such action shall be deI?

of the Uoited States.
10 In the Senate on the 6th, Mr. Trnmbnll
e" reported favorably from the Judiciary Committee
the bill to repeal the amnesty power
0_ of the President, and asked its immediate
!8fl consideration. Mr. Hendricks objected,
and it lies over.
B The result of this measure will probably
b be to oause the President before its passage,
so to issue a general amnesty proclamation.
On motion, a select Committee of five
was appointed from the House, to prooeed
to Anderson District in this State, and examine
into the facts concerning the murder
m of three Federal soldiers there, in the fall
le of 1865. This resolution is evoked by the
j release of Byrum, Keys and Stowers,
convicted before a military Court, of the
crime, and released upon habeas corpus.
A similar Committee has been appointed
to investigate the New Orleans riots in Sepal
tember last; and also to inquire into the
expediency of establishing martial law in
Districts where Union men have been mur
dered. These Committees are announced
of to leave Washington this week, on their iore
vestigatiog mission.
