President Wilson read bis messag *to
Congress on Tuesday afternoon. The
President has departed from the usnal
custom of iong, tiresome messages, which
is a welcome inovation. His message of
Tuesday was one of the briefest and most
masterly of state papers. It contains less
than 3,000 words and goes directly to
the point on the subjects touched upon.
Hitherto the average length of such
state papers has been 20,000 words. The
fnll text of the tqersage, which is a model
of brevity and of diction, will be found
elsewhere in' our columns and is well
worthy of the time expended in its
reading. -
The Anti-Saloon League of ■ Maryland
has decided to drop the State-wide local,
option issue and make the fight from
this time forth for a State wide prohibi
tion amendment. If the forth-coming
Legislature fails to pass the prohibition
amendment, as in all probability it will,
judging from the temperance record of
past Maryland Legislatures, the League
will open a red hot campaign on April 1
next, to pnt the issue squarely before the
people, and public sentiment will ulti
mately force such a measure through the
General Assembly, despited the Balti
more whiskey ring, which is ever on the
job at Annapolis, keeping tab on men
' and temperance measures.
The No-License League succeeded one
year ago in driving twenty-seven of the
sixty-two saloons in Chester county, Pa.,
out of business, with the result that police
records in Coatesville, West Cheater,
Oxford, Kennett Square and Atglen show
50 to 80 per cent decrease in arrests.
Inquiry instituted in the town of Coates
ville brings out the fact that 76 out of 78
business men interviewed report increas
ed bnsinesa. Steel mills report 54 per
cent reduction in accidents and 75 p. c.
reduction in applications for aid, and
the banks have $237,000 increase in
savings deposits over last year.
These are pretty hard f-icts for the
whiskeyite who is always howling that
prohibition does not prohibit and is no
benefit anyway, to get over, and Cecil
county can add a host of other beneficial
facta to this testimony, if any scoffers
should care for them.
The new concrete bridges built by the
Pennsylvania, railroad across the Bush
and Gunpowder rivers have been com
pleted and in use for some time, but
nothing has yet been done towards re
moving the abandoned bridges. A rumor
is growing that it is the intention to con
vert them into toll bridges for vehicles
and foot passengers, similar to the stum
which was pulled off with' the old rail
road bridge over the Susquehanna, be
tween Perryville and Havre de Grace.
Similar excessive toll charges will be
made, aud in order to relieve the sadly
taxed automobilists and other passengers,
bills will be introduced in the Legislature
authorizing the State to purchase all
three of these bridges, at a sum which
will shift the heavy tax on all of ua,
whether we use the bridges or only see
them from the car windows. It is esti
mated it will coat a quarter of a million
dollars to. remove the Rush and Gun
powder bridges, and of course the rail
rjtfd company will try and evade that if
possible, the same as it did with the Sus
quehanna bridge, although in all three
instances its charters tor ti e new bridgea
were granted with the condition that the
old onea be removed.
. At last the express companies are get
ting their just deserts. After waxing fat
for years by the most ontrageons extor
tion, and preventing the adoption of the
parcel post system by one of the most
corrupt lobbies ever maintained it the
National capital, it is asserted by jCou
gresaman Lewis their bnsioess it now
being conducted at a loss.
The prediction was freely made that
the day of doom of the express co npanies
as agencies of transportation would come
in five years after the inauguration of the
parcel post, but so poor has been the
•howiug of the express business during
the first year of the parcel post, that it ia
asserted the express monopoly, one o( the
moat high-hand robbers of the people
ever allowed to exist by the Government,
will be dead and buried in a shorter t me
even than < redicted by the most enthu
siastic supporters of pared post.
There is no roocern in public business
that so richly deserves the fate that is
overtaking it, nor will there be any tears
shed by the people when these express
companies that have for years practiced
extortion at will,'-me pnt entirely ont o'
business, and the ope'*<i<> > of the parcel
poet system.is destined If) seal their doom.

WASHINGTON LETTER.
A new phase of the cost-of-living prob
lem wb9 brought to the attention of the
department of agriculture Friday.
T. ,P. Gill, secretary of the Irish board
of agriculture, told Secretary Houston
that speculators in the large cities of the
United States were baying this year’s
short American potato crop and pi inning
to hold out for high prices, counting
upon the existing quarantine against
potatoes from many foreign countries to
aid them in their undertaking.
Mr. Gill is here to urge the removal of
the embargo of potatoes from his coun
try, aud has been getting private advices
from various sources on, the potato
si'uation in Amer ea.
He inisls that the powdery scab found
on potatoes imported from Ireland is no
cause for a quarantine, because a similar
blemish already is aommon in the Uni'ed
States, and declares that continuance of
the embargo will contribute to the grow
ing cost of living.

With the railroads pleading for a 5 per
cent increase in freight rates, a deter
mined movement for additional regulation
of common carriers has developed in
congress. If the railroads win their
petition, they will be confronted with the
demand to control to the
government as a counter concession.
The principal proposals which now are
being embodied in bills for consideration
at the regular session are:
Regulation by the interstate commerce
commission of the issuance of. stock,
bonds, short term uotes and other securi
ties by all interstate carriers.
Provision that one railroad cannot pur
chase control of another railroad without
the permission of the interstate commerce
commission.
These moves in the direction of greater
supervision of the transportation lines of
the country are being supported by many
senators and representatives. Like Sena
tors Cummins and Kenyon, of lowa, they
are serionsiy contemplating the proposal
of legislation looking to the government
ownership of railroads.

What is practically a co-operative
boarding home, without a landlady, has
proved a success in the city qf Philadel
phia, and has materially reduced the cost
of living of those who have worked out
the plan and are operating under it.
Nine persons, none of them related, are
now conducting a y>mplete co-operative
household at No. 3417 Hamilton street
and they are so delighted with the suc
cess of their venture that they are an
xious for others to benefit from their ex
periences. Each of the residents contri
butes bis or her share of the expenses
and the the house aud, to all
intents and purposes, an ideal socialistic
commuuity is operating within the fonr
walls of the big residence.
Mrs. James Y. Rirpen, a worker for
the Socety to Protect Chillren from
Cruelty, is the originator of the idea and
the leader in the household. The nine
residents of the bouse pay a weekly as
sessment and are assigned to their pro
portion of household work each week.
Divided among nine, the expense la re
markably small, while the amount of
work each one does is trifling.
For instance, Mra. Rippen has figured
that the average cost of living for each
person is S3O a month, including rent,
beat, light, laundry and meals. The
rent of the bouse is SSO a month. Fuel
and light coat $22 a month. Each co
op.-rator pays $3 50 a week for meals,
which ia actual coat, and $1 a week for
laundry Two maids are employed to
cook and clean, and their wages are di
vided equally among the nine, amount
ing to a little over $1 a week apiece.
Whatever work the maids and laundry
do not accomplish is divided among the
nine members of the community. One
has charge of the marketing only; an
other supervises the cleaning; another
attends to the preparation of meals, the
women taking tarns at this duty. The
1 meu divide the work of attending the
furnaces in the winter and mowing the
> lawn in summer.

(Congress on Monday closed np the
longest extraordinary session in its his
-1 tory, beginning as it did on April 7, and
: settled down to the grind of the regular
: “long” session, expected to last well into
. -next summer. Only the absolutely nec
: essary formality marked the ending of
the old session and the beginning of the
new.
1 The Senate was at work practically all
1 day, and a' a short night session com
-1 pleted the first reading of tbe Currency
1 bill, but adjourned without a formal
I opening of the debate.
The House contented itself with a brief
I meeting, formally opening the new ses
sion. All formalities were curtailed.

Here’s Another One.
Another one has started and promises
! to become a worthy successor to “How
I much wood would a woodchuck chuck if
. a woodchuck could chuck wood?” Many
heretical versions of the new teaser are at
- large, but the true form is as follows and
1 must be strictly adhered to by the faith
• ful: Bill had a billboard and Bill had a
boardbill, and Bill’s board bill bored Bill
till Bill sold Bill’s billboard to pay Bill’s
i board bill, and then Bill’s board bill no
( longer bored Bill.
In the promised land there were always
' a few people who kicked because the milk
was too yellow and the honey too sweet.
California Woman Seriously Alarmed
“A short time ago I contracted a severe
I cold which settled on my Inngs and enna
t ed me a great deal of annoyance. I
. would have bad coughing spells and my
f lungs were so sore aori Inflamed I began
‘ to be seriously alarmed. A friend re-
I commended Chamberlain’s Cough Re

I bought a bottle and it relicv d my
I cough the first night, and in a week I
j. was rid of tbe cold and soreness of my

The Autumn Time.
Ye gentle winds of Autumn time.
Sadly solemn is yonr chime.
As through the rustling leaves ye sweep,
Wbat mournful requiem do ye keep.
Is it fair Summer's dying knelt
Your sylvan notes so strangely tell?
Though Summer’s beauty we bemoan.
We chant no dirge in funeral tone.
Like solemn sound of muffled bell.
In token of a sad farewell.
But joyous are the songs we bring.
And of the mellow Autumn sing.
Ye azure skies of Autumn time.
Ye gilded mists, ye clouds sublime.
Ye blended shades Of golden blue,
,Ot brightest red to russet hue.
No Turkish robe with spangles rare
In gorgeous beauty can compare.
No damask cloth of graceful fold
In crimson shade with lace of gold.
That ever huug on castle wall
Or ever graced a knightly hall.
Can match thy curtains in the West,
As wandering Phoebus sinks to rest.
Ye lovely trees of Antnmn time.
Pointing to a fairer clime.
With gaudy mantles o’er ye spread.
‘ln every shade of glittering red;
No Jewish prince of royal line
Was ever clad in robes like thine.
Angelo bold, nor Raphael bland.
Though well they did the brush command.
With studied art in sylvan sheen.
Could match thy shades of golden green.
From brightest tint to sombre hue:
What mortal hand can rival you ?
The ripened grain in Summer’s prime.
Gathered in the Autumn time;
What merry notes the huskers sing.
As home the yellow corn they bring;
While luscious fruit from tree and vine
Proclaim the golden Autumn time.
Ye heavens above, ye stars sublime.
Changing not like things of ti tie.
But God’s glory ye declare
To tribes and nations every where;
In every clime, in every land.
The power of his creative hand.
'Tis in the glowing Autumn time.
These heavenly lamps so brightly shine
With a pure and holy light, .
Through the solemn hours of night;
Our heartfelt thanks to him we raise
Whose works inspire our noblest praise.
Sing now ye winds in solemn song.
Soft and low the notes prolong.
In sweetest strains of rural'rhyms.
The glories of the Autumn time;
More welcome for her hearty cheer.
Than any season of the year.
Isabella Kee Buckley.
New Arrangement Of Stars In Flag.
The new arrangemerit of stars in the
American Flag has been accepted by the
War department. The design is some
thing on the order of the Union Jack, and
.is so placed as to give more room on the
blue field for the additional states which
come into the Union. In the centre is a
huge five-pointed star, composed of ij
stars, representing the 13 original states.
About this design is a circle of stars, tep
resenting the remaining 25 states. A
miniature flag with the new star arrange
ment has been presented to President
Wilson for his approval.

How to Bankrupt the Doctors.
A promiuet New York physician says,
“If it were not for tbe thin sto kings and
tfain soled shoes worn by women the
