A reconuoileriug force under Gen. Stahl,
sent out by Gen. Sigel, ascertained that Jack
son was at New Market last Wednesday.
On Saturday night iast at Snicker's Ferry,
(Jen. Stahl encountered a large force of the
enemy's cavalry, comprising White's battal
lion and the 8d, 7th and 12ih Virginia cav
alry. Attacking them in gallent style he put
the whole force to route, our men using their
sabres only. Their colors were captured, 80
horses, and a large atrtbunt of ordnance and
commissary stores, also 80 cattle. (Jen. Stahl
pursued the enemy to 15er,ryvillf, where he
broke up their camps, and chased the flying
rebels to within four miles of Winchester.
All of White's officers and some 40 privates
were aptured. Their loss was 50 killed and
wounded. The loss on our side was 15 killed
and wounded. Only one rebel brigade is now
at Winchester.

The President's Message. u Owing to
circumstances over which we had no control,"
we ascertained about nine o'clock last even
ing, much to our disappointment, that we
should not be abl to procure the Messagooom
plete in time for our paper this morning. The
" electric fluid" refused" to do iu regular duty
n the latter part of the afternoon and early
part of the evening upon he New York line,
and we were obliged to submit. We con
cluded, under the circumstances, that our
readers would be better satisfied with our reg
ular war dispatches and such synopsis of the
Message as we could procure, than with a
fmyment of the Message and no other dispatch
es. The only consolation we can find in the
matter is that we shall be able to give the
Message in our next in a more perfect shape,
than we could have done by telegraph last
night had we then been able to procure the
whole of it.

Further from Jfew Orleans.
New -York, Nov. 30.
Further advices from New Orleans state that
a powerful squadron was concentrating in the
Mississippi. Already more vessels were at
New Orleans than at any time before since iu
capture. -.
A large number of river boats had been
armed, and great activity prevailsd in milita

A general inspection of arms and men was
about to take place.
Col. Rickerson of Massachusetts, is appoin

Col. Dudley, who is appointed to Gen. But

Guerrillas infested the river banks abov
and below the city.
One naval vessel had been fired into and re
turned the shot with grape and cannister, but
the thick brush wood enabled the - assassins to
escape. 1
No vessel unless well armed now leaves the
city.
Gen. Butler was about to place overseers on
the confiscated plantations to save cotton and
sugar.
The new cotton crop is coming in quite
full.
Gen. Butler has permitted the resumption
of the publication of the National Advocate,
after explanations from Jacob Barker that he
has no intentions to aid the rebels.
Contraband Matteks. The following
interesting "contraband matters" are collect
ed by the Springfield RepuUii-au.
On the recommendation of Gov." -Andrew,
Secretary Stanton has appointed Dr. Le Barrou
Russell of Boston, a commissioner to investi

King Fishcrjust returned from the blockading
squadron of the gulf, confirms tlie accounts
given of a secret league and system of signs
and passwords among the negroes. He took
on board his ship two sets of negroes the first
from Fort Royal, the second from St. Marks.
He saw that they knew each other as perfectly
as if they had lived together all their lives.
On being pressed by him they admitted that
they had means of knowing their freinds every
where j and in a moment they knew whether
a white'inan was for the slave or themastir.
He says that the battle of Corinth was kuown
by all the negroes on the coast of Florida with
in three days after it was fought. They were
quite familiar with the name of Sumner.
A private letter from a general commanding
Union forces in Mississippi, speaks in the
strongest terms of the utility of the president'!
proclamation of freedom as a weapon of war.
The writer says that southern societyjhas been
completely demoralized by it. Some planters
have fled to the city for protection from the
specter of insurrection, leaving all the movable
properly at the mercy of the slaves. Many
others have sold their negroes South ; all are
making the most strenuous efforts to keep the
proclamation from the knowledge of the slaves,
but without avail. Accounts from Arkansas
represent the slave-holders of that state as sim
ilarly affected. Gov. Brown of Georgia gave
strong confirmation of the same idea in this
suggestion of his rex-en t message to the legis
lature of Georgiar If the enemy should take
Savannah it would lie made a safe place of
refuge for all slaves who may attempt to leave
their masters and go to the enemy this winter,
and the planters of this state must lose a much
larger number of slaves than are now required
to complete all necessary preparation for her
defense."
Gen. Saxton is pushing the organization of
the negro brigade with zeal. The Govern
ment now gives the negroes the same pay, ra
tions and clothing with the white soldiers.
Three companies of the negroes bad been off
on another expedition, going to Doboy Sound,
Georgia, on steam tugs, and remaining there a
week, returning with 200,000 feet of the best
Georgia pine lumber, sawed and ready for
use.
This lumber was taken from mills on the
mainland, directly in face of the Rebels, wfco
gave the black soldiers an opportunity to test
their pluck on shore, as they had previously on
a tug-lwat, where they fought with the advan
tage of of a partial barricade. While most of
the negroes were engaged in loading the
steamers with lumber, the company of Capt.
, Janes advanc a Lamnoissancfl. ana nSrt
opened upon with musketry by the Rebels,
from a position in ambush. The negroes de
liberately returned the fire, and, drawn up in
line of battle, kept up a fusilade, maintaining
their ground, until by the aid f the guns of
the steamers and those of their convoy, the
gunboat Madgit, the enemy was dislodged
Three of the colored soldiers were wounded,
one so seriously that his arm must be ampu
tated.
The officers of these men express the great
est confidence m their fighting qualities. Lieut.
Col. Beard, who" commanded the expedition,
says in his official report :
"When it is remerauerea wai inese men
never had arms in their hands until four days
liefore thev started for the expedition, 1 think
you cannot fail to give them great praise for
standing a galliDg fire from a. concealed ene

interruption ; and, tnougn snort oi provisions,
I heard not a murmur. On the last expedi
tion, the fact was developed that colored men
would fitrht behind barricades: this time they
have proved by their heroism that they will

Southern Affairs. The Raleigh, N. C,
Standard says that the state of the Rebel sick
and wounded is distressing, and that thous
ands are daily returned from the army in a
state of great destitution hungry, naked, mu
tilated and suffering. Everything, from the
rich man's offering to the widow's mite is so
licited in behalf of these unfortunates by the
Surgeon General of North Carolina.
The Mobile Register, of the 15th ult., is in

can raise in city property, in the hope that
they will be able to hold it under Federal pro

urges, in the event of tlie fall of Mobile, that

with the House to raise the jurisdiction of
Justices of the Peace to two hundred dollar,

It is now known that Gen. Frank Fatter-

he had been charged with cowardice by a su

The demands upou the Treasury out

it is thought, will be absorbed in reveuue pay

- Mexico, Germany, Holland, France, Eng
land, aud Russia have abolished slavery, and
this country alone, of all the great nations of
tlie earth, is the upholder of bondage. It is
an unenviable position.
In Missouri, every person claiming the
right to vote, was required to take a test oath
of allegiance to the Government. Probably
this kept from teu to twenty thousand from
the polls and secured the triumph of the eman
cipation ticket. Certainly, men who are not
willing to promise fidelity to the Government,
should not be allowed, at suah a time as this,
to fill its offices. Now let the same policy be
adopted in other Southern States, as fast as
they are brought under onr arms.
The woman who died of destitution in
London recently wss Mrs. Elizabeth Mobbs.
She had been used to a life of luxury. Sev
eral years ago her husband died, leaving a for
tune of $17,500,000, which he willed entirely
to her. This immense fortune became a sub
ject of litigation, expenditures in law ate up
what means she possessed, the suit got into
chancery, and Mrs. Mobb, though rightfully
one of the richest women in England, died
trom starvation.
Mrs. Maggie Mitchell, the Chicago papers
state, is playing havoc with the hearts and
pockets ot the shoulder-straps at Washington
City. It is said that she tried to come South,
but could not succeed on account of the nu
merous trunks of wardrobe which she endeav
ored to bring with her. We are constrained
to doubt the correctness of the latter state
ment, for certainly Maggie uses less clothes
than any actress we ever saw ou the boards.
The last steamr from Europe brought
news of the death of the young yankee Ward,
the commander of the Chinese troops engaged
against the rebels. Ward was killed in battle
at Rungpoo.
The McKinstry trial, now in process in
St. Louis, it is estimated will cost the govern

The Norfolk Union says that the orders

Meeting or thr Farmer's Clcb.
The first regular meeting of the Farmer'a
Club recently organized in this town took place
at the Franklin Hotel last evening at seven
o'clock. An address was delivered hy Daniel
Kimball, Esq., the President of the Club, the
subject bearing mainly upon the agricultural
interests of Vermont, and the various meth
ods of encouraging and promoting the same.
He urged the policy of making the raising of

Bbel Tricks.
Few persons know how constant and ingen
ous are the efforts of Rebel agents, spies and
sympathizers at the North to convey through
our lines either information, or articlss which
are in great demand in the southern States.
Partly, these industrious traitors are moved by
sympathy; but for the most part they are sim
ply adventurers who stand ready to speculate
on the necessities of either side; and if the case
were reversed, would as eagerly smuggle qui
nine and news to us from the South, as they
now Bmuggle it from the northern States into
the land ot Dixie.
It is not worth while, therefore, for any one
to waste sympathy on these mercenaries, when
they fall into the hands ot the police, iliey
are paid by the Rebels for the risks they run,
and their patriotic love of the south, has been
fortified by good wages, in general, before they
becin operations.
Though doubtless some escape, vet there is
every reason to believe that the- vigilant Gov
ernment police catches a great part of these
helpers ot the enemy. It the detectives pub
lished their own adventures, some curious
and interesting narratives would amuse the
public.
Not long since a woman appeared in New
Y'ork, and negotiated with a manufacturer of
this city for a machine to make uanK-note pa
per. The machine, when completed, was to be
seat, in parts, into Indiana; and the maker
was to receive his pay from a member of a
well-known Scotch firm up town, ihe whole
transaction passed as arranged; the bank-note
paper machine was finished and sent watched
by a detective to the appointed place in In
diana; the maker received his money; and then
the police, who had known almost from the
first of this attempt to help on the manufac
ture of Rebel Treasufy notes, seized the ma
chine, just when it was to be transported into
Kentucky, towards .Nashville.
They did not, however, catch the weman,
who dexterously avoided them. It was not
Ion? before they heard from her again. She
had aontracted for another bank-note paper
machine.
Once more the Government detectives su
perintended the making of the machine; saw
the money paid by the same enterprising and
trustful New York merchant; and guarded the
machine on its devious way towards Georgia
or Mississippi. But (his time they seized not
only the machine, but also the woman who
had been hired by the Rebels at Richmond to
execute this commission tor them.
While Nashville was yet in possession of
the Rebels, a Jewish family, consisting ol a
man and two women, once set out from Cin
cinnati, in deep mourning, and carrying with
them a finely made coffin, containing, they
aid, the body of the man's wile's sister, which
they were taking to her old hpme, near Nash
ville, to be buried.
They passed safely through LoijisviDe, and
