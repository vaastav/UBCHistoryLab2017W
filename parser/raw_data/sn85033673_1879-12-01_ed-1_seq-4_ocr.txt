A fine display of wagons from the
country daily congregate on the bluff
in front of the city. They bring in
cotton and co out loaded with sup
plies. The holders of tickets 34, 101 and
112, in the raffle for diamond ring at
Barney's saloon Saturday night last,
will please meet there Tuesday night
to decide tics.
The sparkling Lotta will have a
brilliant and an enthusiastic reception
at the theatre to night. She is to
play Musette, in which William A.
Bokus plays a loading part.
Those able to give are urged to be
prepared for tho visits of collectors in
the interests of the poor. There is
much suffering among the destitute,
and a great deal more is feared.
The theatre will bo brilliantly illu
minated to night, tho side or bracket
lights having arrived. Tho decora
tions of the theatre are complete, and
it is a pretty place to look at.
The receipts of cotton here arc un
paralleled in the history of the city
and never since Memphis became a
town has there been so great a dumand
lor the staple by owners of Eastern
cotton mills.
In view of the near approach of the
time when privy voults are to be filled
up, people have begun to practice on
the system of emptying urinals and
wash slops by pitching them out of
front and rear windows in the streets.
A street car and mule stable is in
course of erection at the corner of
Linden tndMain streets. The plot
of ground, a quarter of a square in
extent, was purchased for six thousand
dollars, and many set it down as a
bargain.

"Cotton goods continue active, and
prices are very strong. Many makes
of brown, bleached and colored cot
tons are largely sold ahead, and in
many cases agents refuse orders for
goodj except 'at value, on dav of
delivery." So says a . recent letter
from the cast.
The committee of fifteen, appointed
at the sanitary meeting on the bluff
some time ago, are to meet promptly
to-night at 7 o'clock in the rooms over
tho cotton exchange. They arc making
earnest efforts to arrive at a conclu
sion as to what eught to be done in a
sanitary direction.
We stopped in the Assignee's sale
of watches, jewelry and silverware of
C. A. Bossac, at Loyd and Fritz's old
stand this morning, and found the
handsome auctioneer. Mr. John
French selling goods at one-third of
their original cost. He says that in
all his sales in Memphis he has never
beeu forced to sell fine choice goods at
such ridiculously low prices, aud that
the quality of every article is fully

In anticipation of the visit of Gen
eral Grant to Jeddo there appeared a
sketch of Ms life in Japanese, in
which the author, after speaking with
enthusiasm of the achievements ol
Goran tu, as he calls the General, ad
drosses his readers in the following
words : "Whether we consider the fox
among beasts, or the phucnix among
birds, we find that evan when endow
ed with unusual abilities the intelli
g .nee of these is not equal to that of
stupid old women or doltish boys.
But men are able, if they choose, to
cultivate their talents; and there is a
man who has cultivated his great nat
ural abilities, is rich in thought, is
admirable in movements, is as un
fathomable as heaven and earth, and
with whom neither the fox nor the
phucnix is for a moment to be com
pared. Such an one is General Grant,
whose intelligence is commanding to a
degree, and whoso business capacities
arc truly grand,,"
A Charmed LU'o.
Richmond (Ky.) Ilcmld ,
A man in Madison county went
through the terriblo ordeal of having
a bombshell lo burst in his hands just
after tho war. lie was dreadfully
mangled by the explosion, but recov
ered from his wounds. Some timo
after that he was shot through the
body with a navy ruvolvcr. tbo ball
pac-sing In at the breast, aud out at the
tack. Somo few weeks ago the same
man was driving a wagon with a heavy
saw log on it, and bo on tho saw log.
The wagon turned over and hcand tho
saw log rolled off together, tho nar
log passing over his body, crushing
him in a frightful manner, from which
he has been confined to his bod for
several weeks, but is now out, as hale
and hearty as ever.
