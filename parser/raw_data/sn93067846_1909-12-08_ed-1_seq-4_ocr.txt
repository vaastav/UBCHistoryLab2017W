memoration of the members of the
order Who have passed away from
this life to the reward of the Grand
Exalted Ruler of the Universe*
The program was particularly Im?
pressive and beautiful. Professor
W. S. Schumacher's splendid orches?
tra was augumented by the addition
of a number of out of town musi?
cians, the total number In .the or?
chestra being eighteen. Their sev?
eral selections were among the most
enjn,,i!,ie numbers on the program.
Tr.^ vocal numbers by Miss L. E.
Alexander and Mr. Gay charmed the
large audience. They were both in
fine voice, and their selections were
beautifully appropriate. Professor
Schumacher's violin solo, always an
ever increasing treat, carried his
ilsterners to that realm of enchant?
ment to which perfect music alone
holds the open sesame.
The eulogy, "Our Departed Dead."
which was delivered by Senator John
H Clifton, was a literary gem. His
beautiful tribute to the departed
members of the Order, came, It
seemed from the deepest resources
of his heart, and found a lodging
place In the hearts of his hearers. It
was most beautiful.
Senator Oeo. P. von Kohlnlts was
selected by reason as his prominence
m the Order and his ability as an
orator to deliver the memorial ad?
dress. The rapt attention of the au?
dience as they hung upon his every
word, speaks most significantly of
the pleasure that his address gave,
it was. ndetd. an oratorical treat.

The following Resolution Was Adopt?
ed b> ibe Snmler County Farmers'
Union.
To the Senator and Representatives
of Sumter County, Greeting:
We the Sumter County Farmers'
Union, assembled In Sumter this 3rd
day of Dec, 1909, deem It wise to
call your attention to the fact that
the game laws of our State are be in?
openly ilsonejSS1 and that the game
la rapidly disappearing, and knowing
as we do that the pie. r\at ion of the
birds, and especially the insectivor?
ous birds, is of the greatest Impor?
tance, as without them It would be
almost Impossslbh |a make any
crops.
w therefore, we as representa?
tives of the farmers of Sumter coun?
ty, do it -e pas to SSM every means
la your power to h iv *uch laws
passed ?s will not injure any person,
yet will effectually prOlOCl the alfdl
r?. destruction.
In our Judgnu t the best way to
attain UHs end. Is t > put a tax n'
from one t<> tu ? dollars, on every
SC m r used for killing i-atne without
an\ exceptions whatever. Requiring
a tag to be fixed on the gun with the
nn It and ,? new tag to be given
each year when the tax Is paid. Th"
fun I collected by this means should
the kept In the State treasury to be
used by the Audubon Society.
This will enable us to have a game
warden In every community, whose
dot It shall ???? to protect the game.
And we would furth? r recommi rid
that It he m oh> unlawful for any one
perron, to kill gegfl than gftegfl birds
In any one day. Realizing as we do
the great Importance of linim dlate
action In this matter, we again ur*,e
you to use every legitimate no ans in
your power to protect our l lnK

Practical Thoughts for Practical Farmers
(Conducted by E. \V. Dabbs, President Farmers' Union of Sumter
County.)
The Watchman and Southron having decided to double Its service by
semi-weekly publication, would Improve that service by special features.
The first to bo Inaugurated is this Department for the Farmers' Union and
Practical Farmers which I h?.ve been requested to conduct. It will be my
aim to give tho Union news and official calls of the Union. To that end
officers, and members of the Union are requested to use these columns.
Also to publish such clippings from the agricultural papers and Govern?
ment Bulletins as I think. WtK be of practical benefit to our readers. Ori?
ginal articles by any of o.<r readers telling of their successes or failures
will be appreciated and ) jblhhcd.
Trusting this Department will be of mutual benefit to all concerned,

Some Random Thoughts.
Several very interesting articles

space devoted to farm topics.
This week we have an article from
Vhe Farmers' Union Sun. " What
Lach of Farm Labor Is Doing for the
BovtaV" Our farmers who are dis?
posed to plant largely in cotton
should ponder well the probable sea?
sons, and the labor supply in a wet
June and at the time of picking.
Usually I do not worry when It Is
stated that the acreage in cottor has
been increased one or two mlllon
acres. I have noticed that these are
apt t ? he wet yean and the seasons

we would cat down t<> some kiid of

What Lack of Farm Labor is Doing
for the South.
Owing to the scarcity of labor It
.will be impossible for the South for
years to come to grow more cotton
than what has already been produc?
ed. The present price of the pro?
duct may be an Incentive to South?
ern farmers to plant a larger acre?
age next year, but they realize the
folly of doing this in view of the
fact that there Is not enough labor
available to cultivate and harvest
more than 13,000,000 bales. To
raise this amount and gather it
about exhausts the labor resources
of the country, and so It Is absurd
to talk of the South, under present
conditions, supplying all the cotton
the world needs. It would be easy
enough with such labor as we have
to grow twenty million of bales, sup?
posing the world demanded so many,
but It would require twice the labor
force available to gather a crop of
tnat size. Not until the picking of
cotton by hand can be dispensed with
or foreign labor be Introduced will
the ?outh ever be able to grow In
the future more cotton than It has
in the past.
Lack of labor, then, or at least
lack of the kind that It available,
forbids greater cotton production.
The South has reached the end of
its tether In this respect. It would
be folly to raise what cannot be sav
ed, however great the demand.
This view of the situation f<
upon one's attention questions
are worth considering. The tim
near at hand when farm 1pv r
lie at a premium, perhap t
been reached already. Those in
country have every inducement
remain where they ?ire and tl
who have left it to better their
tunes in town or city will be ten
ed baok to the country. In fact,
tide of population has even i
commenced to turn countrywi
For the last fifty years it has b
going the other way. but a cba
appoars to have set in. It seems
be drifting away from the cities. I
should all the people belonging to
our urban population and living
from hand to mouth seek the coun?
try, they would not tend much to?
ward solving the South's farm-la?
bor problem. What then? Simply
that our farmers would be forced in?
to the use of labor-saving machinery
and to diversify their crops. They
\\\\\ be compelled to that course or
el-e they must encourage foreign
immigration if they purpose continu?
ing the one-crop system. Put rath?
er than destroy their homogeneou*
ness as a people and endanger their
institutions by the introduction of
foreigners, we are confident they
will seek to overcome the stress of
their present circumstances by giv?
ing up cotton growing to a large ex?
tent and devoting themselves more
i
and more to the growing of other
crops. Such a course means smaller
farms and better cultivation of the
soil.
So, after all, scarcity of farm la- 1
bor in the South looks as though it
Will prove a blessing. The day may \
come, unless a practical cotton pick?
er shall be invented In the mean?
while, when an eight or a ten mil?
lion bale crop will be considered a
fair average, with no disposition
ever to make It greater. It is need?
less i > say that such a limit set upon
cotton production would in a few
years enrich the South, provided our
larmers turn their attention to th<?
raising of home supplies and cease
to depend on other sections of the
country for them. We believe the
labor situation of the South Is such
that, against every inclination to the
contrary, they will be compelled to
this course. The future Is big with
promise to them, if they only know
how to make the most of it. Dlver
fiflod farming In the South bids fair
to te the order of the day.?Progres?

Interest In the proposed Sumter
Columbla highway appears to be re?
viving an? there is now ground for
hope that the road will eventually
be built. The route the road will fol?
low Is yet undecided, but there will
be strong rivalry between several
communities through which the
road could be built. Wedgefield is
aroused on the subject and Is work?
ing actively to have the highway
pass through that town and cross the
river In the vicinity of the A. C. L.
bridge. A meeting of citizens was
held in Wedgefield Monday, a com?
mittee appointed to look after the
Interest of that place. The property
owners of Wedgefield stand ready to
donate $800 to $1000 for the road,
If the money should be needed.
