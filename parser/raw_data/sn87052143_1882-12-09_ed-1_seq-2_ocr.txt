Three Cook bro1 hers, well known des
p radoeo from Cn'sas, natives of Illi

escaping arrest, were captured at Mo

are wanted in Kansas, Iowa and Illi-
nol- for hog, horse and cattle stealing.
Gov. MvEiiery, after a oarefut ex
amination of the case, has commit-
slotted Kellogg as congresimau from
the third Louisiana district. That is
right. There is no donbt that Kel
logg is a villain. But there is no
doubt, either, that he was elected to
congress;- and democrats will never
iudorse the plan pnrsned by tbe re
publicans of the present congress, in
partisan deoisious of contested seats,
. The president's message is not i
atartling document. It does not bristle
with striking statements, and its recom
mendations are to a great extent the re
flex of the recent election . There is t
good deal of the I-toId-yoo-so style
about it, but, then,' his I toldyou-so did
no good. The Republican measures the
paper pretty well In a sentence when it
eays that it is about as good a bulletin
as a general could well get up alter
being badly beaten in battle.
We felt sure that Mr. Thieman had
not encouraged the Thalbotein peisist
ing in its slander of Mr. Mountjoy as
that paper intimated last week when it
said it had nothing to take back. Mr,
Thieman is a strong republican, which
it is- his undoubted right to be, but he
is a gentleman and does not approve of
slander as a political weapon. What
he really says of his conversation with
Mr. Mountjoy is elsewhere printed, aud
it concludes with the words, regarding
what Mouni joy had said, "and could
not be understood to mean that no Ger
man Is able to fulfill the duties of
public office." Mr. Kranse's evidence
,e even stronger. We rest the ease.
IFENOE
After the eleotion of 1SS0 the republi
caua generally said, "the country has
declared for protection." Democrats
denied this, because the tariff ques
tiou bad been disingenuously raised
by the republican leaders, in spots,
where demagogical appeals could be
made to tbe fears of tbe laboring pop
ulatioa. In 1882 tbe tariff was talked
about, written about, thought about
and tbe democrats everywhere advo
cated tariff reform, and were oppos
ed by tbe mass of tbe republican
orators and uewspapers. Theconse-
quenceof this fail ana free discussion
was an unprecedented democratic
victory. Though tbe tariff discussion
was not the sole cause of the victory,
it was tbe prinolpal and most gener
al one, and following upon the heels
of it comes tbe repnblioan president's
message, in wbiob the logio of events
compels him to say, "It is plain. there
fore, that large reductions from tbe
customs reveuue are entirely feasi
ble. While reeommenaiug this
reduction I am far from advising the
abandonment of tbe policy of so dis
crimluatiug in tbe adjustment ot
details as to afford aid aud protection
to domestic labor, but tbe preseut
system should be so revissd as to
equalise tbe public burdeu among all
classes and occupations, aud bring it
uto closer harmony with the preseut
neeits of mdustrj. Without entering
lute minute details, which, uuder
preseut circumatauces, is quite an
necessary, I recommend au enlarge
ment of tbe free list so as to iuolude
itbiu it the numerous articles
which yield au inconsiderable reve
nue, a simplulsation or the complex
aud inconsistent schedule of duties
upon certain manufactures, particu
larly those of eotton, iron and steel,
and a substantial reduction of the
duties upou those articles aud opon
sugar, molasses, silk, wool and wool
en goods. If a general revision of the
tariff shall be found to be impracti
cable at this session, I express tbe
hope that at least some of the more
couspiouous inequalities of the pres
ent law may be eorreoted before your
fual adjournment." , . ;
Six months ago tbe admissions
made in this paragraph would have
been received by tbe balk of tbe re
publican press with a bowl of indig.
nation. It is well known that Presi
dent Arthur is not en rapport with
republican legislation on this subject,
but before the elections be would
have been much more ci.ary lu declar
ing it. -'As it is, his message will
arouse the hostility of tbe eastern
cotton, and all the iron and steel
manufacturers. We say 'eastern cot
tou manufacturers," because tbe
southern manufacturers of ootton do
not ask for protection.
Mr. Arthur evidently leans
toward tbe democratic position of a
tariff for revenue, with mcidental
protection, though he doai uot say so
explicitly, for if his recommendations
are literally taken, though of course
made with the reserve whion is nat
ural in tbe leader of a high protective
tariff party, they would lead very
nearly to tbe accomplishment of tbe
mest-to-ee desiied ends. He says,
I recommend an enlargement ef the
free list so as to include within it tbe
nnmerous articles which yield au lu
considerable reveuue." Let as see
what these are.
According to tbe statist!' s furnish
ed by the dtpartment,of tbe $193,000.-
000 collected from customsdnrlng the
year eudiug June SO, 1882, 1133.680,.
317 was collected ou six classes of
articles, sugar aud molasses, wool
aud woolen goods. Iron and steel aud
nauufactares therefrom, silk, cotton
goods, flax and linens. There are a
few more than 3000 articles on tbe
list, end there are l.Widutiable arti
cles wbicb only yielded $60,000,000 of
revenue that is, these 1,991 articles
yield particularly or collectively "an
amnsiderable revenue." Indeed
hey are net taxed for revenue, but
for protection, and for every dollar
bey briag tbe government they pat
ve or six into tbe pockets of the man
ufacturers. Mr Arthur says, place
them on tbe free list, Bo say we.
itb the exception of a tew which
are artla'es of luxury, and which
should be taxed at the highest reve
uue rate.
Then Mr. Arthur goes en to, advo
cate, "a simplification ef the complex
and inconsistent schedules of duties
upon certain manufactures, particu
larly those on cotton, iron and steel,
and a lubstantial reduction of the
duties upon those article, and upon
sugar, molattet, Milk, wool and wool
en goods." That is the doctriue that
the democratic party is teaching,
unless, it maybe, as to silk, which is
uot a ueeessary of life. Indeed the
sentence Bounds as though it mieht
have been taken from a democratic
politics! platform.
The demooaats do not advocate as
i hey are in some quarters credited
with doing, an abrogation of the tariff;
nor would tbey if tbey bad the power
destroy or even cripple the Industries
of the country. Their idea is to lay
be tariff primarily for revenue iu-
deed there is no warraut in the eon
stitution to lay taxes for any other
purpose. This done equably and just
ly would uecessarily afford some pro
tection. That mutih protection may
be borne with patience, but wbeu
taxes are laid upou over 1,900 articles
primarily for tbe purposes ot protec
tion taking the money out of tbe
pockets of tbe farmers to place it in
tbe pockets of tbe manufacturers.
with uo compensation for the injus
tice by corresponding beusfits to the
laboring class, with no sort of com-
jbubbwuu to muse wno pay tne en
hanced prices, pntlenae cesses to be a
virtue. We are sorry that Mr.
Ariuur ib not aitogetner right upon
the tariff, but are thankful that he is
so far in advauae of tbe majority of
his party. We hope uo one will tccpse
as of irreverence if we say, that it Is
very likely that on November 7th
last, whatever else Mr. Arthur may
nave done or left uudoue, that he did
uoi iau to appreciate the full extent
of the eye-opener which tbe voters ef
tbe country administered to tbe par
ty of which he is the leader.
Xbe Boston Post says: "Speaker
Kerr first put Morrison at the head of
the ways aad means eommittee. He
. nned tbe place admirably, and will in
jail probability be placed there again."

THE rUTUBE-
' Tbe tithes seem propitious for dem

the natiou. aud for a final disentbrall-
meut of the people from tbe arbitary
rule of tbe monopolists and tnei
facile agents, republican congress'
meu. a republican president,aud tbelr
appoiutees. It is timely, therefore,
to consider the prospects tor tbe fu
ture.
The democ-ats could, of course, lose
tbe great advautage which tueyjuow
have before 1884, by errors, by
venality, or by extravagance. It is
not likely that tbey will forfeit tbe
confidence of the people by either
extravagauce or venality. It is a fact
In the history of the country, demon
strable without difficulty, that the
democratic party of tbe uation has
always been tender of laying heavy
taxes, careful in tbe expenditure ef
the people's money, economical, aud
houest in its administration of public
trusts. There have beeu, uo doubt.
some exceptions to these rules, as
there will always be while publio,
like private, affairs must be entrusted
to men; bat tbe rules hold good nev
ertheless. Comparisons between it
aud the republican party on this point
sre all adverse to tbe latter. It is
well known that there was more
money stolen by tbe navy depart
ment under Robeson tbau was em
bexzled or stoleu from tbe govern
ment duriug tbe entire 60 years of
democratic administration. Shame
ful as this was Mr. Robsson was
afterward elected by republicans to
congress, aud was tbe recognized
leader of hie party there. The mil
lions stoleu iu the construction of the
Union Pacific railroad have uot beeu
forgotten. Black Friday is uot so
far distant in the past as to have faded
from the memory of the people. The
whisky ring alone stole more mouey
than all the dishonest meu succeeded
in swiudliug from the government
duriug all tbe years of demecratie
coutrol of the government.
These comparisons might be
carried on to great length, but we
only review tbem to show that veu-
ality is uot a democratic vice. Neith
er is extravagance. Everywhere.
uorth, outb, east or west, wheu tbe
democrats secure control of a state
government tbey immediately cot
down expenses. This has beeu nota
bly the case in southern states, but it
has beeu observable also elsewhere.
Tbe Seymour, Tilden and Robiusou
administrations in New York are
notable examples of tbe truth of the
assertion. Tbe objections to tbe dem
ocratic party iu the miuds of the
people will not come from any fear as
to honest management oi the reve
nues. Tbe republicans with their pride n
having, as tbey assert, established the
nation with a big "N," have suffered
this pride, where no baser reason
existed, to convince them, not only
that we have the ability to "lau out
all creation." but that we have also
the ,'ability to etaud more taxation

of tne earth. Ou the other baud the
democratic parly opposes hiuh taxes

country which may become dapger-
ous iu times of financial revulsiou.
which it is always wise to anticipate.
So far tbe north has refused to
frost the democratic party, not
because it lacked faith jn it iu tbe
directions above touched upon, but be
cause it baa been taugbt to think it the
party of rebellion, and tbo party of
tbe south. All this is passing away.
War issues are being relegated tp the
realms ef history aud speculative
politics. Tbeliviug present is com
ing to be more considered. The
uortbem people begin to see, too.
that there is muph of parly clap-trap
iu tbe professions of antipathy to
rebel-brigadiers" made by northern
politioal leaders, Tbey see the re
publican party makiug terms with
the most obnoxious of ex-rebels.
Tbey behold the admluistratiou in
dorsing "Fort Pillow Chalmers" who
abandoned bis democratic allegiauce
because the democrats iu congress re
fused to filibuster to keep him in a
seat to which Lynch, a colored mau,
had been honestly elected. Tbey sse

War feelings are dying out, and
war taxes must go with tbem. Tbe
people are tired of a tariff wbicb to
collect a hundred and ninety millions
into the treasury taxes them tour or
five hundred millions annually, lor tbe
benefit of luauufucsuring monopolists;
tbey are alarmed at the rapid growth
of the power of corporate monopolies;
they resent as an insult the imperil,
ment interference of a presHent with
the affairs of a slate; they are disgus
ted with the spoils system, used us a
rewa-d for past parly fealty aud as a
bribo for future services. Iu all
thete matters the popular confidence
is evidently with tbe democratic
party, as tvas clearly shown by fhe
eleolions of 1876, 1880, and, finally,
iu an uumistakable manner In 1882.
All that there is much fair ol, then,
is the mistakes or the future. We
hope none will occur. If adver.-i'y is as
good a school as it is generally credi
ted with being, none should take
place. To a party which dprecatts

of plaintiff u til Ootober, 1881, when
tneir diligent "inquiry resulted in the
ascertaining ot the facts set out.- "
ibe bill further avers that the eouutv
of Lafayette has a good, valid aid sub
sisting defense to the judgment obtain
ed which it will make as soon as oppor
tunity is given, in this, th4t tbe bank
had no right to sue in the Federal
courts; that Davis in good conscience is
oouno to take new w year bonds upon
which be cau sue ouly if not paid when
the same becomes due.- aud Drava that
the judgment ' deceitfully and fraudu

to enable tbe oounty of Lalayette to
make defense. ...
To this bill defendants file their da.
murrer, assigning as causes, the want
of due diligence in bringing tbe suit,
laiiure to oner satisfaction qf tbe lia
bility acknowledged and want of equity :
We have thus presented tor consider
ation and decision a new feature in the
long railroad bond litigation of. Mis
souri. The case seems to invite a re
view of the controversy, and. it is here
presented in the hope that it may tend
to bring about an early settlement of
tbe remaining railroad bond indebted
ness, a settlement in which all oarties
concerned are deeply interested.
wuue some oi toe western states
about and prior to 1837, were making
efforts iu the direction of internal im
provement, a few of the cUigens and
newspapers o( Missouri labored in the
same direction. The first Iruit of tho.ir
efforts was tbe obtaining from the leg
islature of Missouri in 1837 of 17 char
ters for railroads In various parts of the
iaie. xnree oi tnese cHartera tha
Hannibal, Paris and Qraud River, the
Lioiusiaua ana Columbia, and the St.
Louis and Bellevue railroads contained
provisions authorizing tbe county
courts ot the coquties through which
tbe roads might be located to subscribe
stock and issue tbe bonds ol the oonn
ttes lu payment thereof. As wa lonk-
back upon these provisions with our
experience since, we are astonished
that the legislature should hava m.
trusted such large and what we would
now term dangerous poweas to a ooun
ty court. How little actual danger
there was in euou legislation at the time
may oe interred irom tbe fact that tbe
acts cited and similar laws passed after
ward stood UDOU tha atatntA
book from 1857 up to 185Q with
out being noiioed or called in
to requisition, (t was about 1850
tbat railroiiU building on a large scale,
and as public enterprises commenced in
Missouri. Railroad corporations soon
availed themselves ol tho provisions of
tbe laws refered to, but not until all
kinds ot wil l and visionary schemes
were projected and aid a-ked for tbem
did the dunger ot the la authorizing
oounty c-iurts to make a? y" ,d rail
road subscriptions becomf utiajajerent.
Tbe act of 1855 aulhJ,"!d county
conrts to sub.iut tbe T'i'sIl."' rail
road subscription to the voters ot the
comities desiiing to subscribe tor infor
mation was ameuded iu 1860, requiring
such submission and a majority vole iu
its lavor, did not lessen but rather In
creased the danger for it removed the
responsibility of tbe county courts and
placed it qpon the people. Theoonsti
tution of 1865 undertook to lurnisb a
remedy by limiting tbe powers ot sqb
scription to a two thirds vote. Tbls
was supposed to have efieotually stop
ped ill advised subscriptions and would
undoubtedly have done so. had it not
been iof a decision of the supreme court
qf Missoqri declaring tbat tbe constitu
tional restriction did not apply to char
ters which bad been granted before the
adoption ol bat instrument. Between
tbe years 1837 and 1865 the who's state
bad been checkered over with railroad
charters many of tbem authorizing tho
building ol branches besides their main
lines, all havibg the right to snbecrl'ie
by the county courts In them. In addi
tion the act of 186.8 authorising town
ships to subscribe was passed. Then
came tbe absolute prohibition in the
constitution of 1875 but before it took
Effect all kinds ot sobemeshad been got
ten up, subscriptions made to many of
tbem and bonds issued iu payment
thereof. Thus tbe vast debts of copnties,
townships. : towns and cities, not to
peak oi the state railroad debt was In
curred. Aside from tbe visionary pro
jects ot many of the proposed railroads
themselves, tbe anxiety amounting to a
craze to. have them built at once.naused
very bad financial management, and
often acts bordering on Iraud in the
disposition of the bunds were commit
ted. - Contracts for building ot roads
were entered into with any and every
body at enormous prices and without
the. least security. Members ol corpor
ations contracted with themselves ' for
work or material, aud became tbe
financial, agents ol tbelr own corpora
tions. Al' Ibis was submissively borne
aud in teres: on bonds paid during the
hallucination of railroad building. Thus
tbe crisis of 1872 fouud the people of
Missouri, with many of their railroads
in various stages ol construction, with
empty treasuries, destroyed confidence
ana credit. The sobering up process
whloh set in was greatly accelerated by
demands te pay interest. Now came
tbe inquiry w hat have we been doing
In many instances partial roadbeds, no
roads, and yet large indebteduess. The
cry ot fraud became almost universal
in tbe indebted counties, and was
loud that tbe matter of improvidence
was silenced or unheard. Resistance
to the payment of obligations became as
mno'i a oraze as formerly tbe building
of railroads. There is perhaps but lit
tle blame attached to anybody. In the
the rush to accomplish much iu the
shortest possible time individual judg
ent, laws aud courts were alike over
borne and thus all have participated in
bringing about a atate ot affairs now la
mented.
That all kinds of defenses to the
bonds issued shonld be attempted in
oourss was a natural result ol the man
aer in which the indebteduess had been
incurred. That the fault in most In
stances bad .been committed by the
people taemseives or tneir legally elect
ed constituted agents, tbe county courts,
was not thougnt ot, nor the fact taken
into account that county courts had
often, when they refused to issue bonds,
been compelled to do so by mandamus
issued by their own local state courts.
.The bonds issued by counties having
been made payable to bearer so as to
facilitate their negotiability and readily
obtain money on them, were by the
supreme court ot the United States de
clared negotiable instruments perhaps
in pan persuaded to do so lor tbe same
reasons tbat they had been made payable
to bearer. Thus all inquiry into the man
ner ot their issue lu the hands ot mno
cent holders. was cut off and the sole
question tor courts to determine was.
did legal authority tor their issue exist?
Inquiries into agreements . made with
corporations as to location of the roads.
depots, switches, and completion ot the
work were all ent off as to bonds in the
bands ot innocent hollers for value.
The bonds being largely owned by non
residents of the state they had a right
to resort to tbe United States' courts lor
redress. The result ef the litigation
which followed was in' most instances
favorable to the holders of tbe bonds
and the judgments ot tbe lower conrts
were affirmed on appeal to tbe supreme
court ot the United blatea. iiie docis
ion in tbe Barsbman Vs. Bates county
case, and conflict betweeu ihe state and
federal oourss. tended to give bupport
to tne prevailing lee'iug oi repudiation
and opposition to ihe eniorcemeut ol
tbe indumenta opsj. S. courts. Legis
lation was resorted to either lo obstruct
or prevent the coiled ion of the judg
ments of federal oourts. Tbe class ot
legislation here referred to culminated
in what is known as tbe Cottey bill, which
was soon alter its passage declared un
constitutional because it changed the
laws and remedies in force at tbe time
of the issuing of the bonds aad made
them less effective. By implication this
Cottey bill, also songht to deny to tbe
federal conrts the mate machinery for
tne eniorcement or its judgments, but
this inference was treated bv the conrt
declaring the aot uncoosi itui tonal as too
vague to make anv declaration on.
tven if the legislature of a state has
the power to deny to the United States
tbe use ot the machinery the state em
ploys for the enforcement ot te judg
ments ot its own courts it should never
do so; for such an exercise ot authority
would show a hostility to the general
government which should bo discoura
ged. All attempts such as refusing to
levy taxes in obedience to proper writs,
or prevent the collection of taxes levied,
most iu the long run tall aad inflict se
rious Injuries upoa those who under
take it. No goverwsDt can without
abnegation of its functions, lail to en-
rorce tne luagmenta or its courts. If
the employment of existing state ma
chinery far that purpose could suecess?
ratty ne denied to the federal govern
ment or prove inefficient. Congress in
the exercise ot Its nndoubted oowe'rs
would pass laws deemed necessary tor
the proper and efficient eniorcement of
the judgment ot Us courts. Nor is the
objocion tbat the employment of the
state machinery tends to consolidation
valid, tor the oenosssion, it it be such.on
thepart'ot tbe state.is of the comity which
should exist between the federal and
state governments, both belonging to
and existing for the benefit ot the same
psopie. -.How much batter off would
the people ol tbe indebted communities
be to find their own officers set aside
and those ot another juriadiotion com
ing among them enforcing orders and
judgments of Its oourts. As judgments
of United States courts must be enfor
ced the choice as to who shall doit is
certainly in favor oi state officers. It is
oniy ueeessary to stop and reflect tor a j
moment to see tbe force of these sug
gestions. As soon as seen and acted on
tbe lucarceration of state officers will
cease. The indebted counties will re
ceive their share ot immigration, capital
win aeea investment in them, raisin?
tbe value of both real and personal
property. Nearly all the indebtedness
of the counties, townships, cities and
towns in Missouri has beeu settled by
compremi.es. While this is tbe case as a
whole, there are a tew bondholders
whose claims lor one reason or another
remain unsettled. These seeiug the
returning prosperity ol their debtors
under the compromises, now seek to
take advantage ol the tavorahle turn
tilings nave takeu aud not satisfied with
bat others have done now demand
the whale of their debt. Tbe defendant
in thU oase, under the allegations ol
tbe bill, wblch the demurrer, for the
purpose of determining tbe legal ques
tions admits to be true, is in a more
unenviable position even than the olass
mentioned, lie is charged with having
advocated and voted for the coin pro,
mising of tbe Ln layette county debt,
thereby as a citizen and tax-paver les
sening his own liability. Having thus
impliedly at least agreed to accept 70
cents on tbe dollar in new 25. year bonds,
he now refuses to do so, and in order
to avoid the moral odium and legal con
sequences of his acts is charged with
having made a pretended transfer of
tbe bonds sued on to tbe Jefferson City
Bank, wbo claimed to be an innocent
bolder and as such recovered judgment.
Had the facts as claimed existed and
been known to Lafayette county at the
time tbe suit was brought, plain tiff
cuniu iibto ueieaieu tne action on the
ground that the court had no jurisdic
tion and compelled defendant Davis to
seek redress in court the state provides
for its citizens. In a suit betweeu
Davis and Lafayet te county in the prop
er forum the implied agreement to take
70 cents on the dollar in 25 year bonds
could have been inquired rato. Davis
might not be an Innocent holder and
any delenseot failure on the part ol the
rauruau company in not complying with
their agreements in the construction
and building of the road, if any suoh
occurred, could be litigated. While not
now determining tbe question as to
whether tbe deceits and Irauds o'larged
to nave oeea practiced as set forth in
the bill, the demurrer on those grounds
ano lor me want of e iqity will be over
ruled, so that the whole of the facts may
come oeiore tne conrt. As to the
question ot due diligence the court
is ot the opinion that it is the better
practice to minutely state the exertion
made and means employed to ascertain
the true ownership of tbe bonds after
suit brought, and as tini demurrer is
Well taken on another branch ot the bill
tbe same is sustained as to tbls, so as to
briii?; tho question ot diligence more
fully belore the court.
' The remaining point of tbe demurrer
is that there is no offer made in tbe bill
to do and p.-rforiu what is admitted to be
tbe obligation ol the county of Lafayette
namely, tbe issuing of the sew bonds.
This objectiou Is well taken, for in case
this court shall finally maintain its juris
diction and enter upon tbe investigation
ol tbe equities of the bill, tbe plaintiff
must avow its readiness and ability to
do full justice according to its own
showing before it can obtain the inter
position ol the court in its behalf,
Tbe demurrer lo this part of the bill
is therefore sustained. '
