WHATCOM. Dec. 11.-FSsh CommiSskHi
er LitUe, by rtyuwit, addressed t.»<; Board
of Trade iaat nignt. He preesntod facts
•a the reault of h»* own Investigation* to
ahow that the Columbia rsvtr :*d fa.ien
off to at moat 0> per cent, of -ita former
yield and the proh* • iti»- were tnat the
percentage of decrease wa* m%ch greater
than this staieou-n' w>n*ld Indicate. LV
Ing this as a bast* and the Cecrease in the
Atlantic fish' rw » be arguou for the prtar
vation of our *alm»n waUi there «u yet
time. The effect of the unrestricted catch
was already visible in a decrease In Wash
ington flsh. In *.< me «>f our streams the
run bad fallen Mt per cent, and all bad de
<fcrsas"d. He thought the remedy tor the
threatened disaster lay in putting In num
erous hatcheries, making certain close
seasons, prohibiting certain fishing gear at
piacess and closing the hatchery stream.* to
fishermen within I.OOu fe*-t of their mouth*.
He gave the results of Investigations to
show the superiority of hatcheries over
the natural supply. In his estimation the
fry that reached ten weexs old by the
natural methods was leas than one-half of
1 per cent. In the hatcheries ihey c'jid
turn out 9» per cent I.a*t year the «
mated catch on Puget »</u» i and Krua« r
river was W.&uO.OOO pound* about lvtti.-
00S fish. Even by the natural method if
theae fish had not been caught the to
ereaee would have be»-n 500.000.0U0. At th«
present time nil the hatcneries were only
turning put a few million ana their product
muM be Increased very extensively to m»jet
the deficiency caused by the yearly catch.
A tax of 1 p«*r cent , equitaoiy distributed
•n the fish interests, would meet the ex
pense of putting the machinery in motion
to create a sufficient *upp.y, He estimated
this tax would rnise about 133.W) next
season, one-half of It on Puget sound.
The Baker lake hatcheries should show
some returns next year. This year they
were handicapped by baa weather and
deep snowa The tax spoken of would
■lore than double the capacity and turn
out 35,000.000 fry. Of this It was estimated
one In five would return mature fish. An
experimental station was rwutly needed to
provide facts regarding the best methods
of propagating shell fish on the sound and
to prevent the extermination of the sturg
eon and other vanities besides the sal
mon. Within six or eight miles of this
city there could be turned out as many
oyster* aa the entire state produces, and
the Sitrnlsh flats furnished half as large
an oyster area as could bo found on all
tbe Atlantic coast.
He believed that the proper place for
the Federal hatchery, for which there had
been made an appropriation oI|WM was
on a tributary of the Eraser, as M> per
cent, of thw Fraser river fish were caught
on this aide by our fishermen and by plac
ing It on one of the streams running Into
that river we wou'd receive full benefits
from It. A friend of his, whom he con
sidered a reliable authority, nad investigat
ed a stream running into ChlUlwack lake
and found it all that could be desired and
he was going to make a thorough Inves
tigation dmself in\the spring of that lo
cation. It it was suitable he would strong
ly recommend It.
Ho praised the efforts of the individual*
who had established a hatchery on Hamlsh
lake ;\nd said it would turn out 1,000,000
fry this year. Two hundred thousand CRRS
from the Columbia river had been forward
ed to it and 100,000 from the Sacramento
hatchery were en route and the effort* of
It* promoter* were meeting with grand
success.
During the address Mr. Uttle was filed

President Samuel Gompers was the life of
all groups. The so-called fight on Gomp

tion to him.
Mr. Gompers refuses to discuss his re
election. "That rests with the party of
the second part." he said to a reporter.
"If 1 am elected, I want to enter upon my
duties untrammeled by pledges, so that I
may do for my chosen people what I think
the interests of labor demand."
Mr. Gompers refuses to say what the
probable action of the convention will be
In regard to the socialist pronunclamento,
which some delegates wiil demand, or
what wiil lie the outcome In the conven
tion of the right for the indorsement of
free silver.
"In the past we have defeated the social
ists," he said, "and, in the past, likewise,
we have come out for silver. But since the
latter has become a political Issue the
action of the convention may be different."

companies of Chicago. He it now endeav
oring to amalgamate ail the street car in
tercuts in one great corporation, and has
caused a bill to be presented to the board
o' aldermen, granting this corporation a
blanket franchise for fifty years, covering
all the lines in operation and every other
route worth having. The value of the
privileges covered by the bill is over 130.-
000,000, but no provision whatever is made
for any return to the city for the presenta
tion to Yerkes of this great property. I?
Yerkes has his way, and passes the bill, he
will control all the street car business of
Chicago for the next half century, and
at no time will he be required to contribute
a cent to the city's treasury.
The ordinance will come up for passage
Monday night. It is said Yerkes has
bought enough aldermen at 11.500 a head
to pass the bill, but public indignation has
reached such a pitch that It is hardly likely
that the member* of the board will have
the hardihood to earn their bribes, know
ing that a howling mob awaits them.
Mayor Harrison la leader of the opposi
tion to the steal. He is supported by the
Cook county Democracy and the Cook
county Republican organization.
Harrison has started out to raise a storm
such as the city has never before seen. He
has arranged for half a dozen mass me*t-
Itigs and will speak at all of them. Former
Governor Altgeld. who differs from the
mayor on some political points, agrees wit'i
him in this matter and will assist In the
light. Altgeld advises the citizens of Chi
cago to use ropt-s if necessary to orevent
the obnoxious ordinance from passing the
council.
Mayor Harrison feels quite as strongly in
the matter. He said today:
"I would like to see 150.000 of the citizens
of Chicago in and around the eity hall the
night the franchise extension ordinances
are voted on by the council. If the alder
men are given to understand that the city
will not tolerate such a fraud as is pro
posed, it. will be Impossible to get those
ordinances through the council."

Every house in the twenty bloclp was
flooded and a number of them so badly

damaged so badly it will be a costly matter
