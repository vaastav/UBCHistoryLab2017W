Fellow Citizen* of Ike Semite and lionet of
Jiepretenl Uirei:
I congra-mate you on the continued an-!
increasing prosperity f yur country. By
the favor of Divine Pr -vidence, we hav -
been blessed, during the past year, with
health, with abundant harvests, with pro
fitable employment for nil our people, and |
with emteuttueut n h me, aud with peace ;
and friendship with other nations.
The occurrence of the twenty fourth |
election of Chief Magistrate has afforded
another opportunity t<> the people of the
United B:al- s to exhibit to ’* world a ‘
sigulfl tr example of the f>< cefut anl
sale transmission >f p,,, power and au
thonly of govern in at !r on the public
servan's, whose terms ->f office arc about
to expire, to then newly-chosen succes
sors. Tn example cannot fail to impress
profoundly., ih -ughUa! people of other
countries witu the advantages which re- I
publican institutions afford Ttie inline
dlale, general, ami cheerful acquiescence
of ail good cit zens, iu the n suit of the
election, gives gratifying assurance to our
country, and to its friends tbr-mgnout the ;
world, that a Givernment biased on the
free consent of an intelligent ana patri >tic
peopoi possesses elern- n’s ot strength,
stability, and permanency not found in
any other form of government.
(ton’-iiue-l opposition to the full and :
free enjoyment of tne rights •>( citizen
ship, conferred upon the colored people
by the recent amendments to the constitu
tion, still prevails in s v ral of the lalu 1
slave-holding States i- has, perhaps, not j
been manifested in the recent election to
any largo ex* r lit in a Is of violence or in- j
timldalioo. 1 1 has, how ver, t y fraudulent
oraclu - • in connection with the ballots,
with the regulations as to the jiiac.es and
tnann r --f voting, uni with counting, re
turning, anl canvassing the votes cast,
been successful in defeating the exercise
of the right preservative ol a.i rigms, the -
right of suffrage, which the Constitution
expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens.
Ills the desire oi the good people of
the whole country that sectionalism as a
factor In our politics should distppoar.
They prefer that no section of the conn- j
try should be united in solid opposition
to any other suction The disposition to I
refuse a prompt and i early obedience to I
tiie rquai-righ's amendments to the con- i
slitution, is all that n w stands in the way |
of a complete obliU ration of sectional
lints in oui political contests. As long
as either of those amendments is flagrant
ly violated or disregarded, it is sale to as
sume that the people who placed them in
the constitution, as emb ffiyiog the legiti ;
mate results of Hie war for tne Union, and
wlio believe them to be wise and mceisa- 1
ry, will continue to act together, and to
insist that they shall bo obeyed. The j
paramount question still Is, as to the en
joyment ot me light by every American
citizen who hss the requisite qualifica
tions, to treely cast his vole and to have
it honestly counted. With this question
rigidly settled, the country will tie re
lieved ot the contentions of the past; by
gones will indeed be bygones; and politi
cal and party issues with respect to econ
omy nu t efficiency ol administration,
internal improvements, the tariff, domes
tic taxation, education, finance, and other
important subjects, will then receive their
full share of attention; but resistance to
and nullification of *bj results of the war,
will unite together iu eso.uto purp se tor
their support all who maintain the author
ity if t ie Government aid tne perpetuity
of the Uoi( n, aud who adiqualely appre
ciate the value of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no hos
tile sentiment or feeling to any part ol
the people of our country, or to any ot
their interests. 'The inviolability ol the
amendments rests upon the fund a menial
principle of our Government They are
the solemn expression ol the will of the
people ot the United Slates.
The sediment that the constitutional
rights ot all our citizens must be main
tained does not grow weaker. It will
continue to control the government of the
country. Happily, the history ot the late
election shows that in many parts of the
country where opposition to ilie ''ifloenld
Amendment lias heretofore prevailed, it
is diminishing, and is likely to cease al
together, it firm and well-considered ac
lion is taken by Congress. I trust the
House of Representatives and ihe Senate,
which have ttie rigid to judge ot the
elections, returns ami qualifications ol
their own members, will see to it that
every case of violation ot llie letter or
spirit of the fifteenth Amendment is
thoroughly investigated, and that no ben
efit from such violation shall accrue to
any p-Tson r parly. It will bo the duty
of the Executive, with sufficient appropri
atmns or the purpose, t > prosecute un
sjiarlugly all who liav been engaged in
Uepiiviug citizens a)f the rights guaran
teed to them by the c institution.
It is not, however, to be forgotten that
the host and su.est guarantee of the jiri
mary rights ot citizenship is to he found
in Ins capacity tor sell-protection wtiuh
tan hrlong only to a poop e whose right
to univi rsai suffrage is supported by uni
vernal education. The means at ihe c un
maud of me locai and State authorities
are. m in up i ass, wholly mad.quale to
furnish fret- instruction to all who need
it. Tins is eapeeiallv true where, be fort
emabcipa am, the education ot the people
was m go> it'd rpn ventid, in the interest
of slav. rv. Firmly ooqv need that the
subject of popular education deserves the
earnest attention ot the people ot the
whole c >uutry, with a vut > wise aud
comp’eb. nslvo action bv the G vi rement
of tin- I idl'd tvales, I respectfully re
commend that Congress, by suitable leg
islailon and ub proper safeguards, sup
piement the local educational funds In
the everal B‘ates where the grave duties
and responsib lilies of cit ; z-*nship have
been devolved cn unedu tated people, by
devoting to the purpose grants of the pub
lie lands, and, it necessary, by a mr mria
tions from the Treasury of the United
States. Whatever G vernrnent can fairly
do to pr .motd free -popular elucation
ought to be done. Wherever gfn<-ral edu
cation is lound, peace, virtue ands icial
order prev-d 1, and civil and religious lib
erly are secure.
In my former annual messages, I have i
asked the attention of Congress to the ur
gent necessity of a reformation of the
civil service system of the G iveramont.
My v ews concerning the dangers oi pa
tronage, or appointments for personal i t
partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and ex
perience in the Executive office, and I
believe tnese dangers threaten the stabil
ity of th ■ G ivernment. Abuses bo serious
in their natu e canu t be permanently to'-
erated. They tend to become tn' re alarm
ing with the enlargement of administra
tive serv ce, as the gr >w'h ol the country
in population increases the number of
officers and placemen employed.
Tue reasons are imperative for the
adoption of fixed rules for the regulation ;
of appointments, prom lions and remov
als, establishing a uniform method, bav- j
mg exclusively in view, in every instance,
the attainment of the best quahfica'ions ■
tor the position iu quest! m. Sued a ;
it L-lhou alone is consistent with the equal
rights ol all citizens, and the most econ- I
oruical a.id efficient administration of the
[nib ic b isiaess.
Competitive examinations, in aid of irn
partial app liniments aid promotions, hav
been c muuc'ed for s >tne ve&rs past in s-.-v
erai of the Executive Departments, and 1
by my direction this system tns been
adopted in tue Custom II uses and I* >*'•
offices of the larger cities ot tut country.
In the city of New York rver two thous j
and positions in the civil service have
been subject, in their appointments and
tenure ot place, to the operation ot pub
lished rules for this purpose, during the
past two years. The resu sot th> -e prac
tical trials have been very salist-u I >ry.
and hive confirmed my opinion in favor
of this system of selection. All are sab
Jec’ dto the same tests, nd Ihe r. mu tis
tree from prejudice by personal favor or
partisan lidlaence. It secures tor (tie p•-
silion applied tor the best qualifications
attainable among tne competing appli
i ants. It is an effectual protection from
the pressure of mportunuy which, under
any otlnr course pursued, large y ex mb*
tne time and attention ot appointing offi
cers, to their great detriment iu the dis
charge of other official duties, jireveniing i
the abuse of the service lor the mere fur |
therance ot private or par y purposes, and
leaviig the employe oi the Government,
freed from the obligations imposed by pa
ironsge, to depend solely upon merit (or
retention and advancement, and with this
constant incentive to exertion and im
pri^ameut.
liiese invaluable results have been at
iained in a high degree In ttie offices
where the rules for apjjoinlmenl by cum
jielillve examination have been applied,
A method which has so approved itself
by experimental tests at points where
such tests may be fairly considered con
clusive, should be extended to all subor
dinate positions under the Government
1 believe that a strong and growing pub
lic sentiment demands immediate meas
ures for securing and enforcing the high
est possible efficiency in the civil service,
and its protection from recognized abuses,
and that the experience referred to has
demonstrated the feasibility of such me is
ures
The examinations in the Custom Houses
and Post Offices have been held under
many embarrassments and without pro
vision for compensation for the extra
labor performed by the officers who nave
conducted them, and whoso commendable
interest in the improvement of the public
service lias induced tins devotion ol lime
and labor wiltiout jiecumary reward, a
continuance ol these labors gratuitously
ought not to he expected, and without an
appro] nation hy Congress for compensa
tion, it is not practicable to extend the
system ol examinations generally through-
I out the civil service. It is also highly
i important that all such examinations
should be conducted upon a uniform sys
, tern and under general supervision. Sec
tion 1753 of the Revised Statutes author
- izes the President to prescribe the regula
tion* tor admission to the c ; vil seivlce of
the United States, and for ,h.s purpose to
employ suitable persons to conduct the
requisite inquiries with reference to “ill •
; fitut ss of each candidate, in respect to age,
health, character, knowledge and ability,
I for the branch ot service into which ho
j seeks to enter;’’ but the law is practically
, inoperative lor the want of the nquisite
1 appropriation.
i I therefore recommend an appropria
' lion of $25,000 pi r annum to meet the ex
i peases ut a commission, to be appointed
by the President in accordance with the
terms of 'his section, whose duty it shall
be to devise a just, uniform and efficient
system o! competitive examinations, and
to sujiervise the application ot the same
throughout the entire civil service ot the
government. 1 am persuaded that the
facilities which such a commission will
■ afford tor testing the fitness of those who
apply for i ffico will not only be as wel
come rel et to members of Congrss as
it will be to the President and heads of
i departments, but that it will also greatly
tend to remove the causes of embarrass
ment whicu now inevitably aud cefns'tani
ly attend the conflicting claims of pvron
age between the Lcgis.alive and Kxecu
live Departments Tne most effectual
> c leek upon ttie p< rnicious comjretllion of
1! ffnenco and official favoritism, m tho
bestowal ot office, will be the substitution
of an open competition of merit between
the applicants, iu which everyone can
make his own ncor with the assurance
that his success will depend upon this
alone.
I also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving every officer as fr-e as any
other ei izeu to i xpress iiit* political opin
ion* aud to use his means t r their ad
wc merit, shall also enable aim to feel
a* sale as any private ctliz n in refusing
all demands upon ids saUry i- r political
purposes A law which should thu-guar
anb e true liberty and Justice to all wh >
are engaged in the public service, and
likewise contain stringent provisions
against the use of official author *' oco
erce the political action of private ciM
zens or of official subordinates is greatly
to be desired.
Tue most strious obitsc'e, however, to
an improvement of the civil service, and ,
especially to a reform in the method of
app hutment and removal, has been found
to be the practice, under what is known
as the spoils system, by which the ap
pointing power has been so largely en
croached upon by members ot C ngress.
The first step in the reform of the civil
siTVice must be a complete divorce be
tween Congress an 1 the Ex-cuilve in the
matter ot appointments. Tne corrupting
iP c’rine that “to the victors belong the
spoils” is aseparable Irom C mgressional
patronage a, tue established rule and prac
l.ce of parlies in power. It comes to he
underatoolby applicants for office, an !
by the people /generally, that Representa
tives and Senators are entitled to disburse
Inc patronage of their respective districts
ar and B ates. It is not necessary to recite
at length the evils resulting :rom this in
vasion of the Executive functions. The
true principles ot government <>n the sub
ject of appointments to offl e, as stated in
the National Conventions of the leading
partus of the c matry, have again and
again been approved by the American
people, and have not been called in ques
tion in any quarter. These authentic ex
pressions of public opinion upon thus all
imp jrtant subject, are the statement ol
principles that belong to the constitutional
structure of the government.
“Un.erthe constitution, the President
and heads of departments are to make
nominations for office. The Senate is to
advise aud consent to appointments, and
tne H mse ot Representatives is to accuse
and prosecute faithless officers. Toe best
inter- -l of the public service demands
ttiat tneso distinctions he respected; that
Senator; and Reprentatives, who may bo
Judges and accusers, should not dictate
appointments to < lilce,” To this end the
co-operation of the Legislative Depart
meet of tlie Government is required, alike
by the necessities of the case and by pub
lie opinion. Members of C ngress will
not in relieved from the demands made
upon them with reference to appoint
ments to (dll e until, by legislative enact
ment, the perni ions practice is condemn
ed ana forbidden.
It i 3 therefore recommended that an
act be passed lefining the relations ot
members of Congress with respect to ap
pointment to nffi e by the President, arid
I also recommend that the provisions ot
section 1707, aud of the sections follow
ing of the R vised Statute- 1 , comprising
the tenure-01-offioo act, of March 2, 1807,
tie repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our conn
try is one of the highest aud most impera
tive duties of statesmanship, and that it
can be permanently done only by the co
operation ot the Legislative and Execu
tive De artmenls of the Government, I
again commend the whole subject to your
considerate attention.
It is me recognized duty and purpose
of the people of the United Slates to sup
press polygamy where it now exists in
our Territories, and to prevent its exten
sion. Faithful ami zealous efforts have
aten made by the United States author
ities in U ah to enforce the laws against
it Experience has shown that the legis
lation upon this subject, to bo effective,
requires extensive modification uni
amendment. The longer action is delay
ed, the more difficult will it be to accomp
lish what Is desired. Prompt and decided
measures are necessary. Tne Mormon
sectarian organization which upholds
polygamy has the whole power of making
and executing the loca 1 legislation of ihe
Territory. By its control of the grand
and petit juries, it possesses large in
tluenco < ver the administration of
justice. Exercising .s the heads of
Oils sect do, the local political power of
ttie Territory, they are able to make
effective tnelr hostility to the law of (Jon
gress cn the subject of polygamy, aud, in
fact, do prevent Us enforcement. Polyg
amy will not be abolished if the enforce
ment of the 'aw depends on those who
practice and uphold the crime. It can
only bo suppressed by taking away the
political power of the sect which encour
ages and sustains it. The power ot Con
gress to enact suitable laws to protect the
territories is ample. It is not a case lor
' half-way measures. The political power
of the Mormon sect is increasing; it con
- trols now one ot our wealthiest and most
populous Territ >rus It is extending
I steadily into other Territories. Wherever
it goes it establishes polygamy and sec
larian political power. The sanctity ot
marriage and the family relation are the
! corner-stone of our American society and
civilization. Religious liberty an! the
j separation of churcn and Slate are among
- me elementary ideas of tree institutions.
To re-establish the interests and princi
! pies which polygamy and Mormonistu
i have imperilled, and to fully reopen to
| intelligent and virtuous immigrants of all
| creeds that part of our domain which has
been, in a great degree, closed to general
1 immigration by intolerant and immoral
institutions, it is recommended that the
government of the Territory of Utah be
reorgan zed.
1 recommend that Congress provide lor
the government ot Utah by a Governor
and Judges, or Crmmissioners, appointed
ny the President and confirmed by tne
.s' U4 l t ._ s government an log-ms to the
provisional government established lor
iha territory north-vest of the Ohio, by
■ ttie ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is
deemed bes* to continue the existing f- rm
of local government. I recommend that
the right to vole, hold office and sit op
juries in the Territory of Utah be con
fined to those who neither practice nor
uphold polygamy. If thorough measures
are adopted, it is believed that within a
few years the evils which now afflict Utah
will bo eradicated, and that this territory
wi.l in good time become one ot ttie most
prosperous and attractive of the new
States of tue I uion.
Our relations with all foreign countrh?
have been those of undisturbed peace,

My anticipation of an eai'y reply f" in
the British G >verum<nt to *be demand of
indemnity to our fishermen tor the m;u
-r es suffered bv tha* industry at P -Dune
Btc. in January, 1878 which 1 expnssed
tn my last annual message, was and sap
pointed This answer wa? received only
in the' latter part ot April in tie present
year, and when received, exhibited a fail
ure of accord between the two Govern
ments, as to the m-asure of the inshore
fishing privilege secured to our fishermen
by the treaty ot Washington, of so terlous
a character that I made it the subject of a
communication to Congress, iu which 1
recommended the adoption of the mess
ures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this Government in maintenance
of the rights accorded to our fishermen
under the treaty, and towards securing an
indemnity for the injury these interests
had xctfered. A bill to cairj’ out these
recommendations was under considers
Mon by the House of Representatives at
the time of the adjournment of Congress
in J une last.
Within a few weeks, I have received a
communication from Her Majesty’s Gov
eminent, renewing the consideration of
tue subject, both ot the indemnity for the
injuries at Fortune Ray and of tne inter
pretation of the treaty in which the pre
vious correspondence had shown the two
Governments to be at variance. Upon
both these topics, the disposition towards
a frlenaly agreement is manifested by a
recognition ot our right to an indemnity
for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving
tne measure of such indemnity to further
conference, ami by an aesent to the view
of this Government, presented in th*- pre
vious correspondence, that the regulation
of cc-i. Meting interests of me shore fish
ery of me provincial seacoasts, and the
vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be
made the subject of conference and c >n
current arrangement between the two
Gov rnmenta.
I sincerely hope that the basis may be
found for a speedy adjustment of the very
serious divergence of views in the inter
pretation of the fishery clauses of the
treaty of Washington, which, as the cor
respondence between the two Govern
rnents stood at the close of the last session
of C- ngress, seemed to be irreconcilable.
In the important exhibition of arts and
industries, which was held last year al
Sydney, New 8 mth Walts, as well as in
'hat now in progress al Melbourne, the
United States have been efficiently and
honorably represented. The exhibitors
from ttrs country at ihe former place re
| ceived a large number of awards in Home
j ol the most considerable departments, and
the participation of the United States was
recognized by a special mark of distinc
tion lu the exhibition at Melbourne,
; the share taken bv our country is no less
n liable, and an equal degree oi success is
confidently expected.
The state of peace and tranquility now
I enjoyed by all the nations ol the contt
; neul of Europe lias its favorable influ
i once upon our diplomatic and commer
cial relations with them. We have cou
; eluded and ratifiou a convention wuhthe
French Republic for the settlement of
: claims ot iha citizens ot either country
against tne other. Under this conven
j lion a commission, presided over hy a
distinguished publicist, appointed, in
pursuance of the request of both nations,
by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil,
| has been organized and has begun its
I sessions in this cay. A congress to con
sider means for the protection of indus
trial property has recently been iu ses
sion in Paris, to which I have appointed
the Ministers of the United States in
France and in Belgium as delegates. The
International Commission upon Weights
and Measures also continues iis work in
Paris. I invite your attention to the ne
cessity of an appropriation to be made in
time to enable this Government to com
ply with its obligations under the Metn
cal Convention.
Our friendly relations with the German
Empire continue without interruption.
Ai the recent Intentional Exhibition of
Fish and Fisheries,Berlin, the partici
pation of the United States, notwith
standing tho hasle with which the com
mission was forced to make its prepara
tions, was extremely successful and meri
. furious, winning for private exhibitors
numerous awards ot a high class, and for
j tne country al large the principal prize
of honor ottered by His Majesty, the
( Emperor. The results of this great suc
| cess cannot hut be advantageous to this
important and growing industry. There
have been S fiue questiocs raised between
tho two Governments as to the proper
effect and intei pretalion of our treaties oi
naturalization, but recent dispatches from
I our Minister at Berlin show that tavora
ble progress is making toward an under
standing, in accordance with the views of
this Government, which makes and ad
mi's no distincliou whatever betwem the
! r gbts of a native and naturalized citizen
ot the United States. In practice, the
I complaints of molestation suffered by
naturaliz'd citizens abroad have never
j been fewer than at present.

Daring the last summer several vessels
belonging to the merchant marine of tnis
country, sailing iu neutral waters of the
West Indies, were tired at, boarded, and
starched by an armed cruiser ot the Span
isli G iverument. The circumstances, as
reported, involve not only a private injury
i to the persons concerned, but also seemed
to) little observant ot tne friendly reU
, turns existing for a century between this
country and Spain. Tne wrong was
brought to the attention of the Spanish
Government in a serious protest and re

investigation by the royal authorities,

The consular treaty concluded with
Belgium has not yet been officially pro.

I'he attempt to negotiate a treaty of ex.
tradition witn Denmark failed on account
ot the objection of the Danish Government
to the usual clause providing that each
nation should pay the expense of the ar

The provision made by Congress, at its
last session, for the expense of the com
mission whlcn had been appointed to en
ter upon negotiations with the Imperial
Government of Cuina, on subjects ol great
interest to the relations of the two coun
tries, enabled the Commissioners to pro.
reed at once upon their mission. The
Imperial Government was prepared to
nive prompt and respectful attention to
the matters brought under negotiation,
and the coutereaces proceeded with sacli
rapidity and success that, on the JTth of
November last, two treaties were signed
at Peain—one relating to the introduction
of Chinese into this country, aud cne re
lating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of
the Commissioners, is now on his way
home bringing the treaties, and it is ex
pected that they will be received in sea
son to bo laid before the Senate early in
January.
Our Minister in Japan has negotiated a
convention tor the reciprocal relief of
ship-wrecked seamen. I take occasion to
urge once more upon Congress the pro
priety of making provision for the erec
tion of suitable tire proof bnila’ngs at the
Japanese capital for the use of the Ameri.
can legation, and the Court House and
jail connected with it. Tne Japanese
Government, with great generosity and
courtesy, has offered for this purpose an
eligible piece ot land.
In my last annual message I invited the
attention of Congress to the subject of the
indemnity funds received some years ago
Irom China and Japan. I renew the rec
ommendation then made, that whatever
portions of these funds are due to Ameri
can citizens should be promptly paid, and
the residue returned to tne nations, re

Relations ot friendship and amity have
been established between the Government
of the United Stales aud that of Rouma
nta. We have sent a diplomatic represent
ative to Bucharest, and have received at
tris Capital the special Envoy who has
been charged by his Royal H’ghneas,
Prince Charles, to announce the inde
pendent sovereignty of Ruumams. We
hope for a speedy development of com
mercial relations between the two coun
tries.
In my last annual message I expressed
the hope that the prevalence of quiet on
the border between this country and Mex
ico would soon become so assured as to
justify the modilication ot the orders,
then In force, to our military command
ers, in regard to crossing the frontier,
without encouraging such disturbances as
would endanger the peace of the two
countries Events moved in accordance
with these expectati ms, and the orders
wore accordingly withdrawn, to the en
tile satisfaction of our own citizens and
the Mexican Government. Subsequently
the peace of me border was again dis
turbed by a savage foray, under the com
mand of the Chief Victoria, but, by the
combined and harmonious action of the
military forces of both countries, his
band has been broken up and substantial
ly destroyed.
There is reason to believe that the ob
stacles which nave so long prevented rapid
a id convenient communication between
tne United S'ales e.nd Mexico by rail

and that several important enterprises of
this character will soon be set on foot

New envoys from Guatemala, Colom
