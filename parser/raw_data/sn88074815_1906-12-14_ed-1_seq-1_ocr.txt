disband That we had built a walk
to the new cemetery and had con
tracted for trees to be planted along
the same this month that seats had
been promised which would be placed

ished that we had attempted to
clean the city and were asked to de
sist that we had placed barrels as
many as we i could secure around to
receive the trash and paper which
was thrown out on the streets and
scattered everywhere Being handi
capned we were powerless to do any
thing further without their assis
tance
Mr Owen arose and stated that he
thought the society should have the
cooperation of the council
Mr Weathers said that he was
greatly annoyed by the cows with
bells that roamed at large at night
and disturbed his slumbers He was
informed that even in a small town
like Leesburg the stock law was en
forced and that the citizens of that
pU D could sleep serenely
Mr Biggs city attorney said that
the laws of the city of Ocala were
So fllcient and that there ought not to
be any trouble to have them enforced
Mr Gates stated that our mayor
was not in sympathy with the society
Mr Robertson said that he under I
stood that there was an understand

Dr Chace stated that it was not
geherally known that the city was put
to considerable expense to enforce
this law and that there was not suf
ficent funds to do it
Mrs Groves a member of the com
mittc1 stated to the council that she
would like to get behind that street

tee had been appointed a year ago to
do such as that and to remove old un
s y buildings and that it was up to
the council to have it done
The ladies requested the use of
the carts one day in each month
Mr Weathers asked for a motion to
that effect giving power to act
Dr Chace objected and wanted the
matter referred to the street commit
tee
Mr Weathers withdrew bis motion
which placed the matter back in the

to the ladies
They then withdrew from the coun
cil chamber
Mrs Bittingers report was accept
ed and a discussion followed It
was the voice of the society that if
tho laws of the city are not suf
ficient to meet the wants of the cit
izens that it is the duty of the coun
cil to repeal the present laws and
make new ones The officials are the
servants of the people and it is their
duty to have the laws enforced and
that the society did not think that
the agitation of this matter would
bring down the censure or disapproval
of the people in general it was the
business of this organization to agi
ttae whatever would tend towards
correcting existing evils tliat menac
ing the health and pleasure of the
people But it was not the business
of the society to take up any personal
grievance that might exist between
the mayor council or marshallet
them settle that among themselves
It was suggested that since the
lawns were rooted up by the hogs
I and flowers are destroyed by cattle
I that if some one would make an ex
ample and shoot a few of them pos
sibly tl e nuisance would be abated
