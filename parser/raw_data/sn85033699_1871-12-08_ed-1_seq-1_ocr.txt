OHIO AND THE TARIFF.
gThe. 'Washington correspondent of the'
New York Tribune, speculating on the
probable complexion of the Committee of
Waysnd Means of the House of Repre
sentatives, writes, Dec. 3:
"Appropos of this subject, it is known
that the editor of Tlie Cincinnati Gazelle
has written aletter to Mr. Blaine, in which
he says that the appointment of Gen. Gar
field will save Ohio to the Eepublican party,
by retaining in its support such men as ex
Sficrctary Cox, Matthews, Hoadley, lias
saurek, and all thosa who are known as
'Liberal Republicans,' while the appoint
ment of a High Tariffman will cause them
to join the opposition."
The Cincinnati Gazette denies that its
f f
editor wrote to Speaker Blaine, "but he has
an impression that he said to somebody
lately that the appointment of Garfield
would take the wind out of the 'new de
parture,? while the appointment of Kelly,
who, backed by Mr. Greeley, was snorting
mad for the position, would fill all their
sails." This is rather an equivocal denial.
It is pretty clear that the editor of the
Gazette "said tom somebody" something
very like what he is charged with
having written to Speaker Blaine. And now
wo 'have a high tariff man as chairman of
the committee.
POOR AKEKJ1AX.
'Grant appears to have "soured" on Aker-
man, the only representative of the South
ln his-Cabinet. The Washington corres
pondent of the Cincinnati Commercial
writes, Dec. C, as follows:
"It is positively known, here that the
President has expressed himself as 'dissatis
fied with the Attorney General, and has in
dicated his belief in his unfitness, and it is
about certain that he has given that officer
several hints that his resignation would be
I jomptly accepted. The Cabinet officers
are also as a unit against Akerman, and un
less he acts on Grant's hints very soon, he
will he removed as promptly as Pleasanton
was. The President is unable to see how
" Southern man can strengthen him, and,
in addition, he can find no man suitable.
As a reward to the Pacific Coast for its
tiand in Republicanism, and as a bid for
her future favor in his renomination, the
President has, it is thought, decided on
Judge Williams, of Oregon."
Grant does Akerman injustice. He has
s'lown extraordinary fitness for the dirty
vpprlrassigned him in anncving and perse
cuting the people of the South, and in his"
efforts to keep Radicals in office against the
wishes of the people who pay the taxes. He
exhibited a peculiar aptness in this respect in
the manipulation of the Georgia and Texas
election law, and the part he took in post
poning the election of the Georgia Legisla
ture after it was ascertained that it was
largely Democratic He also signalised his
fitness for the work in his recent visit to
South Carolina, where he devised the ways
and means to have citzens arrested without
warrant. But Grant knows he has nothing
to hope from the South, and so he ha3 de
tcnulncd to'kick the .servile fellow out of
hiaflCabinet.

The Political Ontlook.
Special to the Louisville Courier-Journal.
The caucus of the Democratic Senators
and members, to be called to give an ex
pression on various measures which will
arise 'during the session, and the still more
important question of the Presidency. wiU
probably he postponed till after the holidays.
An informal interchange of opinion on the
course to be taken in the latter particular
shows great unanimity in opposition to un
due haste, or to any step tliat looks like a
surrender of the Democratic organization
into the hands of the anti-Grant Republi
cans. Whatever may be the strength of
the latter iu the country, there
does not appear at present' to be a
single one of the 139 Republican
members of the House, who is willing to
publicly announce his opposition to the re
nomination of Grant. There are neverthe
less many who are at heart opposed to it,
but they at the same time admit that if he
is the nominee of the Republican party they
will be obliged to support him. The Dem
ocratic leaders in the House therefore desire
to see some positive position taken by those
Republicans who will not support Grant in
any event, before any profession is made
for a coalition to unite the Democratic party
with such an element. Many Democratic
members have requested Hon. Fernando
Wood,- cliairman of the joint caucus, to
have" a conference called next week in
order that members may be able to in
form their constituents when they go home
during the recess what position the Demo
crats iu Congress have taken on this im
portant question, wliile others insist pn de
laying all action till the full strength of the
conservative Republicans' opposition is
made manifest. Democratic members
were informed by an ex-official of the Grant
Administration, who was quite active as a
visitor on the lloor of the House, tliat the
opposition to Grant's re-election was gain-"
ing ground among the Republicans in the
West, and that the more regular members
of the party were assuming, since the elec

THE WHARTON TRIAL.
AKNAroLis, MD.,Dec 7. The first wit
ness called in the AVharton case to-day, was
Mrs. Hutton. She detailed the circum
stances connected with Mrs. Wharton's
making a milk punch, of which VanNess
partook, and in which a sediment of tartar
emetic was found.
Dr. Williams' Who attended Ketcham
.during his sickness, testified to facts con
nected with his illness and stated that Mrs.
Hutton gave him a bottle when he entered
the house which Mrs. AVharton said was
found in Ketcham's bed. This bottle the
Doctor thought had contained laud
anum. . Mrs. AVharton was anxious
tnat this fact should not be made known,
fearing it might give rise to an impression
that the General had administered lauda
num to himself. The Doctor told Mrs.
AVharton he was glad to find this bottle as
it might explain the condition in wliich he
found the General, and for another reason,
if he had taken nothing else he might re
cover as there was no evidences of a danger
ous amount of opium having been taken.
Being puzzled about the General's condi
tion, the witness remarked to Mrs. Snow
den, "I fear the General has been pois
oned." The witness then went out of the
room to see Mrs. Sanly, who produced a
tumbler from her pocket and asked him
what it contained. He took out his knife
and put a small quantity of the sediment
on liis tongue, pressing it agaiust the roof
of his mouth. There was a strong metallic
taste, so strong that the taste remained in
his. mouth until his dinner, which was
about five o'clock. Being convinced by the
taste that the deposit contained a metallic
poison,' he returned to the General's
room - -with his doubt changed to
conviction, ilia the had been poisoned and
found -him growing rapidly worse. He left
the room .to, notify Mrs. AVharton of the
General's impending death. After doing so
he was returning to his room when he met
some one coming down. He asked how the
General was and was .answered he is dead.
The witness then detailed his examination
of the pants and coat of Ketcham, findinc
pocket-book, watch, knife and other small
articles of his, and giving them to Mrs.
Hutton. He did not find or examine "the
vest. A post mortem examination failed tb
discover anything in the brain that
would account for death. He then
applied . a ligature above and be
low" " 'the stomach and removed that
organ and the contents. He opened them
and found nothing noteworthy. The points
of congestion, the heart and the lungs, were
not examined. The stomach was placed in
a glass jar-and taken to Prof. Aiken .some
time subsequent. After the grand jury had
indicted Mrs. AV. they went to AVashington,
exhumed the body of Ketchum, and exam
ined the heart and lungs' which they found
healthy- JThe.court adjourned. .' '

taken up and discussed at considerable
length by AVm. G. Burwell, of New Or
leans, Monroe, of Dubuque; Opdyke. of
new xorK, veiuenu,oi rnuadeiphia, iid-
naru aikiusou, oi Boston, ana otners. The
original resolution was amended so as to
pay a tax on the counties within the limits
proposed to be reclaimed.
Mr. AVetherill said the State of Arkansas
was pledged already to a debt of eleven mil
lions of dollars, and he was opposed to
saddling them with an additional debt of
hve millions.
Leroy Shryoclr, of St. Louis, said tho
question idtimateiy was this, that not only
should the State of Arkansas and Mississip
pi be redeemed from loss caused by the
war, but the whole country should be ben
efited. When the government can see her
self clear she should sten forward and errant
her aid in producing of the great staple of
these States.
Atkinson, of Boston, said he had learned
tliat this was not an act of private benefi
cence, nor to help in the navigation of the
Mississippi river, but an act to put the gov
ernment in the cotton business. It was a
question among scientific men whether the
system of levees was the right system to
pursue, whether it did not tend to fill up
the mouth of the Mississippi arid obstruct
navigation, he therefore moved to strike
out all that portion of the resolution that
referred to bonds, so as to ask assistance of
Congress whenever these States shall be
ready to proceed with this work.
Mr. Stanard of St. Louis, did not doubt
that navigation will be benefitted by the
construction of these levees. Cotton, sugar,
rice and the other staples of that country
cannot be raised to as good advantage in an
other portion of the South as on these lands,
which are proposed to be reclaimed and
which were reclaimed before the war.
Mr. Opydykeof New Yrk, thouch. Con
gress was justified in assisting in the con
struction of these levees by the present
state of the case and by the uniform
past conduct of the" Government.
Mr. Roper of Boston, thought there was
something monstrous in the overflow of
these crevases, but did not believe the enter
prise possessed such national character that
the Board could bring it before the Govern
ment. He believed it shoidd be referred to
a committee who could present the pro
position before them in such a shape that
all could vote for it.
Barton Able, of St. Louis, said the sys
tem was not destroyed durine the -war. as
had been stated, but was inaugurated many
years ago. The system was good really,
being brought to perfection when the war
came on. Before the war the levees were
subject to overflow, but the people were
able to repair the loss. The war took away
this power. Almost the entire country
south of Memphis is subject to overflow at
any moment, and he asked, in all justice..
-why the- Government should not direct its
aim to a country so rich and beautiful as
this is?
Mr. Atkinson, of Boston, then offered a
substitute, askinjr that such improvements
as may be necessary shall be considered a
fair subject of legislation by Congress when
ever these States, or any one of them, shall
proviue oy law lor the levying of the banks
of the Mississippi .within their respective
limits. Lost. -
On motion of Mr. Roper, of Boston, the
-whole subject was referred to a committee
of three to report to-morrow morning. The
chair appointed Messrs'. Roper, of Boston,
Burwell, of New Orleans, and Clark, of
Cincinnati. The resolution, as referred,
asks Congress to aid in the preservation of
the sugar and cotton land3 subject to over
flow by the Mississippi river, and in the navi
gation of said river, whenever it is conve
nient that such aid can be safely. and ad
vantageously extended.
Direct Importation.
The chair appointed lAVetherill, of Phil
adelphia; Cook, of Cincinnati, Burwell, of
New Orleans; Opdyke, of New York, and
Kirkiand, or balumorc, a committee to re
port a memorial to Congress, setting forth
such alterations and amendments to the
law of July 14, in reference to direct impor
tation, as may be necessary to tho carrying
into effect all the act referred to.

Some of its principal features, not already

and elections to the people. He says the

Liberalism.
The Governor discusses the national po
litical situation at great length. After re
verting to the material welfare of the State
and congratulating the people on its pros
perity, he says it is equally a source of con
gratulation that its political influence has
been signally enhanced by the wise course
of conciliation so emphatically initiated by
our election. The advent of liberalism to
the administration of the State has recon
ciled the resentments of the war, confirmed
absolute lreedom to all, evolved anew the
principle of self-government acting through
local organizations, established a purer civil
service instead of that compelled by the
slavish ways ot partisanship and incited the
youthful energies of a new generation to
compass the great destinies of the future
rather than rehabilitate itself in the dead is

makes a powerful arraignment of the ad
ministration party and policy as a perver
sion ol Kepublican ideas and high treason
to Republican principles. One of his clos
ing paragraphs is as follows :
"i ne attempt to establish by lorce ot mar
tial law a civil society that would accord
with the superior government never has
been and never will be a success. At
present it is not a success in the South. In
the past it was not a success in the North,
and the teachings ot 17 ib illuminated the
failure of a cetury later. There is latent in
the reconstructed States as elsewhere
throughout the Union, much of that senti
ment which finds expression in de
votion to local freedom, a
sentiment exaggerated into wrongful
secession under the pliant passion of the
slavery controversy, but one which in the
absence of slavery may be channelled back
to the surest safeguard for the equal free
dom of all. It is in maintaining the .ger
minal points from which the growth of free
opinion starts in a preserving form, through
wliich it passes into politicd life, and re
specting the distributions of duty it im
poses and constitutionalism has created,
that security will be found for all who are
commingled in such society as ourf. It is
partly because this is assailed and sought to
be supplanted by outward force alone that so
little advance has been made by the
Government in its ostensible reconciliation
The samo result would follow in other
States on any other question thus engend
ered, and it is worthy of note, by Republi
cans as well as Democrats, that every party
which has passed from power since the
foundation of the Government, ha3 lost the.
confidence of the people, because of an at
tempt unduly to exalt the national above all.
local ireedoms, and to strain the national
power to ends for which it was never de
signed, by a 'method repulsive to the com
mon thought and present will."

and read. The Deputies are warned never
to torge&wliat: a.depth of wickedness the
Empire had led the country. France should
now look, for complete reorganization, to
God and time. It was her policy to endure
a dignified peace. Should war occur, des
pite ner determination to remain at peace,
it should not be her deed. France must
resume the position to which she was enti
tled, not only for her own good, but in the
interest of all nations.
France sympathizes with tho Pone In the
maintenance of his pontifical independence,
and will, in case of need, give the Holy
Father vigorous support. The utmost cor
diality is manifested toward Austria, for
wnose prosperity lervent hope is expressed.
The relations of France with Rrnssia, says
the President, are those of reciprocal inter
est. Thiers deplores the indebtedness of
the country, but says it 13 due to the machi
nations of the Emperor Napoleon. The
President advocates the establishment of a
general compulsory military service in war
time, and proposes a limitation of the an
nual contingent to tliirty thousand men in
time of peace. The message concludes
with an expression of confidence in the pa
triotism 01 the Assembly.

A POLITICAL LOOK INTO THE FtJ-
TURE FACTS AND FIGURES.
To tho Editors of the Union and American:
Nothing of a political nature could give
the country in general more genuine satis
faction than the defeat of President Grant
in 1872, with the consequent hustling of
present-giving, incompetent and cor
rupt office holders from office, to
gether witli the supplying of their places
with men worthy of being honored, men
in whom the masses could repose confidence
in the administration of public affairs.
Then to the means and possibilities of
accomplishin? thismuclitobo desired object.
In the elections of the past year we have
lost much by want ofS)rganization, new
departures, Tammany frauds, inactivity,
etc., hut I shall take the result of these
elections as my basis of calculation and
count for the Democracy only those that
have voted Democratic majorities under all
the above disadvantages during the year
1871, to-wit: Alabama, Arkansas, Dele-
ware, Honda, Georgia, Indiana, .Kentucky,
Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and
AVest Virginia. Eighteen in number
with an electoral vote of 122.
On the other side, I shall count those that
have given Republican majorities during
the same period, notwithstanding that we
are sure to gam iew lork in the next
election, and my recollection is she gives
an electoral vote of 32 or 33. Then we
have as doubtful, with the doubts of some
of them reduced almost to a certainty in
our favor, California, Connecticut, Missis
sippi, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But to our
calculation the following States have given
Republican majorities during the time men
tioned, and for the purpose of our calcula
tion we admit them, to-wit :
California, Illinois, Iowa, Connecticut,
Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mas
sachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebras
ka, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, Arermont and Wis
consin nineteen in all, casting an electoral
vote of 194.
From the above figures we deduce the
following facts, a change of thirty-seven of
the above electoral votes would elect a
Democrat President, then the qustion natu
rally arises how can we do this and I
answer giving, however, my individual
opinion only :
1. Aiake a prudent nomination, putting
forward men with good records, men who
would sacrifice private interests for public
good.
z. uiscara tne niea 01 new aepanures,
passive policies and organize to the core.
Clamor lor a return to tne constitution as
it is and tho old land marks of our fathers.
Recoenize the inevitable results of the late
war by planting tho Democratic party firm
ly on the rock of lilierty and amnesty to all.
"3. "Work early and work late for the right
remembering that eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty, and my word for it the
honest masses will come to the rescue and

of the district; the office of Attorney Gen
eral for the third judicial circuit shall be
filled by executive appointment until the

elected. , . '
Mr. DuBose spoke in opposition to the
amendment, on the ground that it proposed
to strike off eight counties from the Attor
ney General's district, confining him alone
to the county of Knox. The following let
ter, he said, would speak for itself:
ttotthe of Representatives, Nash
ville, Dec 7, 1871. Hon. J. J. DuBose
My Dear Sir : I regret that I was not pres
ent in the Senate ChamDer yesteruay wnen
you did the lavor tomysen auu my tuuaui
uents of calling up House bill No. 298,
(which passed tlie House without a dissent
ing voice) to create the office of District
Attorney at Knox..
In view of the published reports of your
proceedings, I desire to thank you for your
courtesy, and to assure you that the state
ments of Senator Gibson to the effect that
the bill originated in a spirit of political
persecution, are wholly untrue, as yourself
anc the Senator from Rutherford very pro
perly denied. Senator Gibson has been
sufficiently well informed by myself and
others to know that the bill now pending is
demanded by the interests of the people of
my aounty without regard to party, and the
prominent men of his own party, having
no selfish end to gratify, are urging the
passage of the bill. The statements also
made, both privately and publicly, that tlie
bill legislates the present Attorney General
out of office are alike untrue. I hope your
tody will pass the hill without amendment,
as it was drawn up with great care and
meets the case. Yours, truly,
C. M. McGhee,
Representative of Knox county.
A letter was also read from Mr. Thorn
burgh, the present Attorney-General.
Mr. Staley said it was not his purpose to
oppose the bill. The amendment he pro
posed would not effect its object; neverthe
less, although he would not oppose the bill,
he regarded it as -unnecessary legislation.
Mr. Gibson said he did not propose to
rise" to a question of personal privilege, but
he would just say that he mado
no such statement a3 had been
charged against him by Mr. McGhee,
and there was no such phrase as "political
persecution" in the report of his remarks in
the papers. If there had been, it-would
have been incorrect. His (Mr. Gibson's)
statement Was this: That the Senator
from Knox and Roane represented this
particular locality, that it had heretofore
been a custom of the Senate' to acknowl
edge the right of each Senator on this floor
to represent hi3 own locality, that the com
mittee" had this bill, ,and. .that, upon yester
day an attempt wasnade to take it out of
the hands of the committee before they had
repartedjouit, and immediately to put It.
GOODRICH.
J. M. SFURLOCE.
upon its passage iu spite of the remon
strances of the Senator from Roane, whose
locality alone was affected. He protested
against that violation of a well understood
rule of courtesy in the Senate, and what he
did say and what he now repeated, was tliat
this bill was nrged on by the spirit of
pontics, anu no aeneu any" gentleman
to contradict it. He would lav
the word of the Senator for Roane asainst
the statement of any member of the nouse
of Representatives. The fact was the peo
ple did not demand this bill. It was de
vised for tlie purpose of putting a Democrat
in a Republican's place. He did not doubt
for a moment tliat the bill would pass, and
he expected the commission was already
written out. ne was glad the amendment
liad been offered, for .in voting it down the
Senate would show tliat the bill was poli
tical. Mr. Coulter in reply to the assertion of
Mr. Gibson that he did not believe a Re
publican had spoken to Messrs. Ridley and
DuBose on the subject, said that Mr. J. C.
Parker, a Republican, had received letters
from members of his party urging the pas
sage of tins bill. A Republican of Knox
county had prepared a bill similar in char
acter and sent it to Mr. Wester, a Republi
can in the House from Roane county, with
a request that he introdnce it. Again, the
bill was voted for in .the House by every
Republican member, even by the gentleman
representing Knox itself. He (Mr. Coul
ter) himself had been importuned and
spoken to on tin's subject by many citizens
of Knox county, many of whom claimed to
bo members of the Republican or Radical
party. He understood, though he could not
say positively, that the present incumbent
was in favor of the bill. The whole argu
ment of the Senator from Campbell was a
rope of sandnd based on the presumption
that the Governor would appoint a Demo
crat. How did the gentleman know that?
He (Mr. Coulter) regretted that he was pre
vented by ill health from speaking longer
on this subject, and exposing the sophistry
of the honorable member from Campbell.
ine previous question having been called
and sustained, the amendment was rejected.

ties, stating his reason therefor to be that
the bills, in as much as they

two-thirds of the voting population of the;
counties affected thereby were in violation
of the spirit of section 4 of article X of the
Constitution as construed by the Supreme
