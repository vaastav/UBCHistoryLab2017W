Mr.^velandVseeonl ge nera? message*!
resembles the one sent to Congress a
year ago.
review or roierastjonat affairs^ Here
the two great subjects of importance are
the fishery disfatte and the Gotting case.
The former is still unsettled, and the
President, while desiring friendly rela
tions with the dominion, finds such re
lationsylJw*atened; by the action of it*
officials toward our fishermen. He
; makes no mention of the authority given
to him last summer to check this action
by ? retaliatory proclamation. The
year's negotiations at London have thus
far resulted in nothing, but hopes are
heldxOttt of reaching an acceptable con
clusion before the end of the session.
Meanwhile the correspondence on the
subject Is to be laid before Congress.
As to the Cutting ease, the President
contenta himself with protesting against
the Restri?e that although Mr. Cutting's
offence was committed on our -soil, yet
he became subject to punishment by
Mexican laws, when found in that coun
try, as the offence had been committed
agi?nst^^f?x???i citizen. f?e "b?pe*
that Mexico will abandon' her positron;
because the two republics should be good
friends, and American capital and enter
prise, 4owing int Mexico, asks , securi
ty of person and property. He recom
mends legislation, to carry out the Re
ciprocity Convention of 1863 with Mexi
co, and is going to open negotiations for
an enlarged treaty of commerce. ;
With Hawaii, as an outpost of Ameri
can commerce, our relations, says the
President, ought. to bei streng then ed.
The treaty? now terminable on a year's
notice, ought t? be extended for a fur
ther term of seven years, while the au
tonomy of the islands should be main
tained and telegraph communication
established between them and us.
The President regrets the ill treat;
ment of the Chinese on the Pacific
coast, and says that China will meet us
half way in limiting the emigration of
her subjects, while protecting those who
are now iure.r ^oosVrtsuitsjare^i?iped
from the recent changes in otgantclaw
bringing Panama directly under the ad
ministration of Bogota. Chili has not
yet provided for the payment of the
claims of our countrymen. Liberia
the President regards _ as an ^ ?n'
en oof^t*ocrr^rrtrea! system, entitled-+o
our support in maintaining her inde
pendence, although a formal protector
ate would be against our policy. He
proposes to give her some 'small vessel,
no longer found adequate to our needs,'
fof /protecting her coastwise revenues.
Ce%?u? Greeecbaum bai bee ? recalled
for his 'overzealous* stroke in declaring
a protectorate over Samoa and King
Malie ton. The Netherlands complain
that our tariff specially discriminates
agamat the tobacco of the Dutch, Sa**
Indies. Spain has relinquished her dis-'
crimination against our -merchant ves
sels in the Antilles, and now displays
? friendly commercial spirit. Mr. Cox
will be glad to bear that the improved
tre*A**eat-o? American imsaionarrea in
Turkey is due to his exertions. Vene
zuela still withholds her ratification of
the Claims Convention of 18S5.
A revision of l?gislation of citizenship
and extradition is asked, with a bureau
Or the registration of naturalized citi
zens, and a law for the .immediate dis
charge from custody of persons commit
ted for extradition where the President
thinks the surrender should not be
made. The copyright question is com
mended to Congress and also the aboli- j
tiooe&tbe discrimination now made by
t^e^ariff io favor of the works of 'Ameri-j
can artiste. Attention is asked to
Secretary Bayard's proposed re-arrange- !
ment of the diplomatic and consular J
salaries, and much appreciation is ex- j
pressed of the value of the consular re
ports which the State Department prints.
Turning to financial affairs, the Presi
dent says the ordinary receipts of the
last fiscal year were $13,749,020.68
above those of the year preceding ; the
ordinary expenses, $17,788,797 less ;
the surplus left in the Treasury, $93,
956,588.65, as against $63,463,771.
27 the previous year, being an increase
of $30,492,817.27. The estimated sur
plus at the end of the current expenses
ter about $90,000,000. The President
urges a reduction of the 3venues by so
modifying the tariff as to 'cheapen the
price of the necessaries of life and give
freer entrance to such imported materi
als as by American labor may be manu
factured' into marketable goods. The
agriculturist, he says, pays 'an unnafar
al-profiV which, by the action of the
Government, is given to the more
favored manufacturer.' As to the com
pulsory coinage of silver, the President
repeats, bis last year's recommendation
of its suspension. He advises the ap
pointment of an additional Federal
Judge in the Southern District of New
xork, where custom suits hare greatly
accumulated.
Of Secretary Eodieott's recommenda
tions he specially sanctions those rela
ting to eoast defence, and for requiring
examination, like those in the navy,
a poo the promotion of army officers.
A short summary of Secretary Whit
ney*? report is given, with a somewhat
guarded approval of its project for secur- i
ing ^American armor and gun steel, j
Thej^mdes* favors an extension of
the tree delivery service, and an appro
priation for increased postal services to
the Argentine Republic and Brazil,
though not as 'a grant or subsidy.' He
commends toe suggestions of the Attor
ney-General as a whole, and pag?fcu?ar
ly the one to establish a peui{?6tiary for
prisoners sentenced in Jfnited States
; Coarte. The cost of erecting and main
taining it would be partly offset, he
says, by saving the sums paid to State
institutions, and by 'the manufacture of
such articles as were needed for use by
the Government.'
The President repeats his recommen
dation of a commission of three army
officers and three civilians, as auxiliary
to the present system of Indian* agents.
The allotment of Indian lands in several
ly is also favored. The ? repeal of the
Pre-emption and Timber Culture acts
and the repeal or amendment of the
Homestead and the Desert Land laws
are.; recommended. The scibject of pen
sions is discussed at length, but rather
vaguely. There seems, however, to be
an indication of an important purpose
to object to pensions granted 'upon any
other gro?ods than actual service and
I injury or disease incurred in such ser
vice.' TW^aten t Office is busy and
prosperous, y As to the Uniion Pacific's
indebtedness, the President somewhat
diplomatically says that' the matters to
consider are 'the situation of the
Government se a creditor and the sorest
way to secure the payment of the princi
pal and interest of its debt.' The pro
priety of inter-State commerce legisla
tion is suggested cautiously, and the
labor question provokes a renewal of
the project So add arbitration in labor
to the present functions of the Labor
Burean. The prevailing cattle disease
is recommended to the attention of Con
gress. .
* Of?he Civil Service law Mr. Cleve
land declares that 'every public officer
who has a just idea of hie duty to the
peop?e^testifies to the value of this re
form ;' that should its underlying prin
ciple be abandoned, it wiii be the aban
donment of 'the surest guarantee of the
safety and success of American institu
tions and that the salaries of the Com
missioners ought to be increased at once.
He recommends that the Government
shouTffpay to the victims of the Freed
man's Savings and Trust Company the
38 per cent, of their deposits never re
turned to them. The amount would be
about $1,291,718, but be thinks that a
large part of it would not be called for.
The needs; of the District of Columbia
round out the very long message.
Mrs. Cleveland and Washing
ton Society.
'There is no danger/ saiid a Wash
ington lady who recently called upon
Mrs. Cleveland when she was re
ceiving informally those of her ac
quaintances who bad previously met
her in a social way, 'of the Presi
dent's wife e**er injuring hie political
prospects by injudicious remarks.
She seems on the spar of the mo
ment to say just the right thing in
reply to remarks that she could not
possibly have. anticipated. I begin
to think from the opportunities I
have bad of observing ladies in pub
lic -^-positions daring over twenty
years' residence in Washington that,
like the poets, Presidents' wives are
born not made, and Mrs. Cleveland cer
I ?ainly was endowed by nature with
I the qualities of mind and heart which
would best f?t her for the place she
now fiirs so graa-?fcy. When one
h with her one flWFa mere of her
charming, unaffected man iere than
of w|at she wears or whether she is
a bltut?tii woman or not.'
t. Cleveland receives with a
unaffected cordiality that puts
her visitors at ease at once. She
both talks well and listens well, and
manifeste interest in all that is said
t? ber, as well as readiness in begin
ning a conversation. She seems ab
solutely unconscious of the fact that
she is ^the first lady of the land,'
doing the honors of the residence of
its' Chief Magistrate. When some
one said to lier that she need not be
afraid of -people whom she would
not care -to meet* intruding when
she was receiving informerly in the
evenings, - because those who would
Ik*embarrassed by sitting down for
a tete-a-tete with the mistress of the
White House would rather come on
some more public occasion, when
they would be lost in the crowd and
any deficiencies in their dress or
conversation would eecape notice,
Mrs Cleveland said promptly and
with evident sincerity : do not
know who the people are that I
iwould not care to meet.' I don't
object to meeting any one, but only
to havHig a crowd come w?:en I am
receiving in the evenings, as might
be the .case if they thought 1 was
having a formal evening reception
for the public.' A Congressman said
on hearing this : 'Mrs. Logan herself
could not improve on that speech for
its ready tact."
Mrs. Cleveland sees her visitors in
the Red Parlor. While waiting for
her they are shown into the Blue
Room, and ir. a very few minutes
she comes to them, walking with the
buoyancy natural to her yonth, and
invites thorn to go into the Red
Room, as that is less a chamber for
occasions of state than tiie other.
When passing through the doorway
Mrs. Cleveland always steps back for
her visitors to precede her. and when
one of them recently, a lady much
older titan herself but unmarried, said
to her at the door, Oh, Mrs. Cleve
land, you must go first ; the married
ladies always take precedence of un
married ones/ ehe said, in a merry
tone : 'Is that so ? Then we will go
together/ and so walked by the other
; lady's side. As soon as she enters
the Red Parlor she asks her visitors
to be seated and, when they are, her
self draws a chair neat to ?ern and
takes her seat.

ceptions, a few days ago, Mrs. Cleve

dotted with silver and had small sil

black silk lining cut square in front,
so as to show the white neck through
the Mack net. It was fastened at
the throat with a diamond crescent,
atid she wore a bouquet de corsage of
natural roses. She had on no gloves,
and her hands were bare ama arms
exposed nearly to the elbow. Her
skin is very fair, and her arms and
hands are very white ; but, while
round, her arms give proof by their
sii ape and size of more muscular
strength in them than one would ex
pect from a lady whose duties had
never required her to use them much
in a way to develop the muscles.
She seems to avoid wearing earrings
whenever possible, but had on seve

! occasion noted, one gold bangle on
her arm, and no other jewelry except
the diamond crescent at her throat.

A WELL TRIED TREATMENT
For Consumption, Asthma, Bronchitis,
Dyspepsia, Catarrh, Hay Fever.
Headache, Debility. Rheumatism,,
Neuralgia, and ail Chronic and
Nervous Disorders.
When 'Compound Oxygen' is inhaled, the
heart has imparted to it increased vitality.
That organ sends forth the blood with more
force and less wear to itself; the vital cur
rents leave on their circuit new deposits of
vital force in every cell of tissue over which
they pass, and return again to the longs for
a new supply. This isa rational explanation
of the greatest advance medical science has
yet made.
'The Compound Oxygen Treatment,' Dre.
Starkey k Palen, No. 1529 Arch Street, Phil
adelphia, have been using for the last sixteen
years, isa scientific adjustment of the elements
of Oxygen and Nitrogen magnetized, and the
compound is so condensed and made portable
that it is sent all over the world.
