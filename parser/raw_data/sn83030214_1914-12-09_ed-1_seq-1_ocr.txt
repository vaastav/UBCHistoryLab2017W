CANNIBAL^FISH ATE MAN
Re osevelt Tells New Story of
River of Doubt.
Oyster Ray, Long Island, Dec. 8.?
Colonel Roosevelt, it was learned to?
night, {rave a private lecture several
dnys ago to a party of irlanda at Saga*
more Hill upon hi? sdventures on the
"River of Doubt." Among eeveral
thrilling escapes by member? of the
expedition described by him, the Colo?
nel told of a fish which he cnlled the
"cannibal flsh."
This fish, the Colonel aaid, though
only about eighteen inches long and
almost as wide, '.vas of indescribable
ferocity. One day, he said, one of the
native carriers fell into the river. Al
itistantly he was attacked by
t.al A ah, which swarmed around
him and were so voracious thnt when
the rescuers arrived, only the skeleton
of the man was left.

'DOROTHY ARNOLD'
ON BIBLE FLY LEAF
Family's Lawyer Doubts
Book Found on Girl in
Texas Is a Clew.
Experts long ago agreed that the
mystery of the disappearance of Dor?
othy Arnold would remain unsolved,
but every so often something happens
to recall the case. Thi? time it is the
arrest of a girl in Texas who carried a
Bible on the fly leaf of which was
written "Dorothy Arnold." To add color
to the story yesterday's report from
San Aatonio had it that a slip of paper
had been pasted over the nan.. .
The ease ot* the missing girl was
sure to be remembered this week, any?
way, for it was jaat four years ano
this coming Saturday that she left her
hoihe anil family, at 108 East 79th st.,
and was swallowed up. With the Texas
St WM a man who calls himself
Fred J. Benson. The pair are held
pending an investigation of pawr.tick
ets for allegad stolen goods. They
came from Mexico recently.
iking or the family last night,
John S. Keith, of 87 St. Nicholas Place,
the lawyer who has had charge of the
search for Miss Arnold, ?aid that in
the last year not one clew had been
turned up thai was coi.sidered worth
iaveeti gating.
Hi would Mae to see the handwrit?
ing in the Bib'e in San Antonio, he
sard, because then he could easily prove
prove the validity of the
ture. Miss Arnold's peculiar
of writing could not be mistaken any?
where, he said.
Outside of saying thnt he would like
? the signature Mr. Keith mani?
fested little interest in the clew. In
the first place he was quite sure that
the missing girl WOOld BOt be in the
eompaay of lawbreakers if the ware
alive. Then he announced positivai**
that she never had a Bible. A hand
bar was all she carried from her home,
? the clothing she wore, the law?
yer said finally, although as the re?
sult of an afterthought he intimated
that he thought the Texas clew was a
joki.
William J. Flynn ?s one of the many
who have been concerned in the search
for Dorothy Arnold who thinks she is
dead. The announcement of her dis?
appearance was made by him when he
was second Deputy Police Commission?
er in charge of the Detective Bureau
As long as he remained in the depart?
ment he thought his search would bo
successful. Since then he has changed
his mind.
Much mystery has always furround
ed the case. Although the girl went
awav in December, 1910, It was not
until January 25, 1011. that the publi
was informed that a worldwide search
had been instituted.

DOUBTS WISDOM OF
DANIELS SCHOOI
Crozier Says Army H;
Only 38 Per Cent ol
Reserve Ammunition.
[Kv;n TV? Trll'in? Bur?a'i ]
Washington, Dec. 8.?The dlsclosu:
in The Tribune regarding the unp
paredness of the navy and the lack
fleet practice caused Rear Admi
Charles L. Badger, recently in co
mand of the Atlantic fleet and a me
lier of the General Board of the na'
to undergo rijrid cross-examination 1
five hours before the House Naval ?
fair* Committee to-day.
Discussing the unpopularity of t
schools Secretary Daniels has est?
Hshed aboard ships, the admiral franli
admitted that lie doubted the wisdr
of the acaden.ic courses, and said th
were disliked by the men. He sa:
furthermore, that "school" has to
abandoned when there is Hny real wo
for the men to do?such as manoeuvr
or target practice.
Admiral Badger approved the idea
vocational training for sailors. Be sa
he saw no objection to these cours
of Ftudy, but the recent commander
chief of the Atlantic fleet waa qui
? unenthuslastic about the study hour
elementan- things.
After rapid-fire questioning, Admir
Badger admitted that "possibly one i
two ships" of the Atlantic fleet fail?
to share in target practice and mancei
vres during the last year. Asked to di
tnil the amount of practice the varioi
ships had had, Admiral Badger sai
he could not furnish this from memor;
but promised to supply the committe
with a statement of the movements c
each slip mentioned in The Tribun
story. The admiral insisted, to the be?
, of his recollection, that the Atlanti
fleet ships had had both individual an
I division practice.
Practice Schedule t'phct.
Ile ?cknowledged, however, the cor
ditiona at Vera Cruz and the fact tha
certain ships had been overhauled a
i navy yards might have disarranged th
regular practice schedule, although a?
serting that sooner or later the requi
site amount of practice was had. Al
these matters, the admiral promisee
would be act forth in his written state
ment to be supplied later.
Admiral Badger made radical recom
mendations concerning an increase o
the navy. He iriformed the committe
that this country needed 100 ?ubma
rines for defence purposes on the coast
and about the insular possessions. A
present the navy has thirty subma
rises built, nineteen building and eigh
to be contracted tor. That thm natioi
should have by 1B11? a total of forty
e jj-*it battleships of the firr-t cla?s ?j
also asserted by Admiral Badger. Thi
navy will not be an adequate navy
Admiral Badger said, until it has thesi
torty-eight ships.
The admiral's statements concerning
; the need of more submarines and bat
,t!eships followed the general discus
? ion of the unsatisfactory condition!
, of the navy as referred to in Th?
Tribune.
In advocating 100 submarines, Ad
mirai Badger said he did not desire th?
committee to sacrifice dreadnoughts ir
order to furnish the undersurface ves
isels. He insisted that this nation mus?
keep pace in constructing both battle
'ships and submarines.
He referred to the recommendations
of the General Board trn years ago for
i four battleships a year. It was contem?
plated by the board, he added, that tht
I rr tad States should have forty-eight
j ships of the first ela?s by l'.U'.t. He
told the House committee to-day that
he still regarded it a? necessary to
have a navy of this strength. Count?
I ing the South Carolina and the Michi
i MB, there are now seventeen ships of
, the firs- line built and building and
twenty-five so-called pre-dreadnoughts.
Badger Favors Air Ships.
Admiral Badger also recommended
larger appropriations for airships, say.
ing that both submarines and airships
? have proven their worth in the Euro?
pean conflict.
The hearings on the naval bill are
behind closed doors, but it was learned
from several members of the commit?
tee that a large part of the hearing was
devoted to question? which have been
raised by The Tribune in its investiga?
tion of the administration of the navy.
Representatives Roberts, Fair and Rut
!i r are expected to Bail Admirrl
Fletcher to-morrow. Kepre .ntative
Witherspoon, who was a leading crose
examiner to-day, will al?o ia>??. a hand
in examining Admiral Fletcher.
That ihe General Board is not in
sympathy with the modest recom
...uons of the Secretar*" et 'he
Ka**** was indicated when Admiral
Badger told the House committee that
It should authorize immediately the
i following auxiliary vessel?: Two hos
! pita! ships, two supply ships, two am?
munition ships, two transports and two
'tankers. The estimates of the depart
' ment covering auxiliary vessels make
| requisition for none of these vessels
except one tanker.
The prolonged examination of Ad
' mirai Badger, largely due to The Trib?
une dltcloaaree, has postponed the ap
pearaBce ef Secretar* I?i.r.?.-:. before
the committee. Tin. Secretary ii not

President Reads Message,
Revealing Defence Policy
PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
ON NAVAL POLICY
A powerful navy we have always regarded as our proper and natural
means of defence; and it has always been of defence that we have
thought.never of aggression or of conquest. But who shall tell us now
what sort of nav-y to build? We shall take leave to be strong upon
the seas, in the future as in the past; and there will be no thought of
offence or of provocation in that. Our ships are our natural bulwarks.
When will the experts tell us just what kind we should construct?and
when will they be right for ten years together, if the relative efficiency
of craft of different kinds and uses continues to change as we have seen
it change under our very eyes in these last few months?
We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some among us
are nervous and excited. The question has not changed its aspects be?
cause the times are not normal. Our policy will not be for an occasion.
It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing, which we will
pursue at all seasons, without haste and after a fashion perfectly con?
sistent with the peace of the world, the abiding friendship of states, and
the unhampered freedom of all with whom we deal. The country has
been misinformed. We have not been negligent of national defence.
We are not unmindful of the great responsibility resting upon us. We
6hall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new
circumstance, and what is needed will be adequately done.

thereafter was adopted into the d?
rations of position and the resolut
providing for a special commissioi
nine to formulate a I'an-Amer
policy looking to the protection of
! international and commercial rightr
! the neutral nations, more particuh
of those component of the union it?
The I'an-American position v. at
scribed by Ambassador Xaon in
following phrases taken from his
dress:
"It falls to us. the democracies
America, which are seeking to real
the ideal civilization founded upon
value and the strength of principles

U 'var can justify the setting aside

Following the conference and in i
c.ordance with the resolutions, the sr.
cial commission of nine members
study the international problems pr
aented and to submit suggestions loo
ing to uniformity of action in the den
ings of the American republics wi
the warring powers was appointed I
Mr. Hryan, as follows: The ambass
dor? from Argentina, Brazil and ?"hi
and the ministers from t'ruguay, I'er
Honduras, Ecuador and Cuba. M
Bryan will be the chairman of th
commission ex oflicio.
The resolution providing for th
commission stipulates that each go\
ernmer.t may submit to it such plans o
suggestions as ;t may deem eonventen
to do.
The declarations adopted by the con
ferei.ci' set forth the following state
ment of the position of the Americai
republics:
"! 1 I That the magnitude of the pr?s
ent European war presents new prob
lems of international law the solutioi
S>f which is of c'iual interest to thi
entire world.
"'2) That the form in which th<
operations of the belligerents are de
vel'.ping redounds to the injury of th<
neutrals.
"'1i That the principal cause foi
this result is that the respective rights
of the belligerents and the neutrals are
not clearly defined? notwithstanding
that such definition is demanded both
by general convenience and by the
spirit of justice which doubtlessly ani?
mates the belligerents with respect to
the interests of the neutrals.
".il That considerations of every
character call for a definition of such
rights as promptly as possible upon
the principle that liberty of commerce
should not be restricted beyond the
point indispensable for military opera?
tions."
"The interests of the countries not
involved in conflict are as much en?
titled to respect, as sacred, to say the
least, as those which could be invoked
hy the countries which misfortune has
led to belligerency," said Dr. Naon.
"The mission of the neutral countri?'S
is to maintain the progress of the
world and to conserve its moral and
material energies as a nucleus for the
re ..?lublishinent of the disturbed
equilibrium in a future which we all
earnestly hope will be immediate. That
aocial mission which is as supreme as
the verv defence of sovereignty aug?
ments, if possible, the attention which i
deserves the respect for the integrity
of their rights as neutrals. If these
rights and tha rights of the bellig?r?
ants conflict, a spirit of Justice, a sen?
timent of humanity and a reason of
high practical policy determine that
tha rights of tha neutrals must prevail,

Specifically denying any intention
playing politics, backing the efforts
any person to fore ? an investigation
the military condition of the count
or of urging preparedness against ai
one nation, the National Securi
League was organized by one hundn
prominent citizens of this city at tl
Hotel Belmont yesterday afternoon.
The league, which will be national
scope, starts with these declaratioi
of purpose-i:
To secure through an efficient ii
vestigatlon authoritative and compr,
hensive informatiitn in regard to tl
condition of our national defence
naval and military.
To find out how considerable an a?
dition to the present annual approprif
tions would be required to attain th
large measure of efficiency, i. e., "ir
surance" that may prove to be essen
tial.
To bring about such organization o
citizens throughout the country as ma
make practicable an intelligent expr?s
sion of public opinion and may insur
for the nation an adequate system o
national defence.
Stanwood S. Menken, chairman o
the committee formed to organize th?
league, called tho meeting to order
The purpose was not, he ?aid, of or
ganizing against any one country, an?;
it was not Intended to further any po
litical propaganda or the plans of an>
one person who may be seeking an in?
vestigation into the condition of the
nation's defence*. It is, he said, in?
tended to find out the weaknesses In
the existing system, and by arousing
national opinion, apply the necessary
correction.
( ommittee Declare? Aim.
(in motion of George Haven Putnam,
a comnrttee consisting of Mr. Putnam,
Frederic K. Coudert and Courtlandt
Nicoll, was appointed to draw up a
declaration of principles. The commit?
tee reported as quoted above, the
recommendation being accepted subject
to amendment by the executive com?
mittee.
There wa? ?ome question as to what
form the investigation should take.
Chairman llenken ?aid an early re?
port was necessary if any action was
to be had at this term of Congres?.
Colonel William C. i'hurcb, editor of
"The Army and Navy Journal," said
the necessary information was readily
available; in fact, he had it with him
in the form of the recommendations of
the general board of the navy and the
general staff of the army.
In the debate that followed the state?
ment was made that army and navy re?
port? are edited to please the wishes
of heads of departments.
"Wc have recently heard," aaid
Clarence J. Shearn, "that t certain
official refused to print a report unless
it was altered to conform with h's
Idea?."
Colonel Church defended the official
reports, ana ?aid the President wa* re?
sponsible for thpm and would not in?
tentionally lie.
John F. n'P.ourke agreed with
Colonel Church that thp object of the
league was not so much investigation
as to arrange an adequate scheme of
national defence.
"If we are for security," said he, "we
ahould look into that tnd that alone."
More Soldiers Needed.
"No soldier wants a big standing
army," Colonel Church resumed. "All
do want an affective force. Our con?
tinental forces to-day could be placad
in the Yale bowl, and one-lhird of the
room would be left for the populace to
occupy and admire th? aoldiera. What 1

the ruiliments of drill and man?uvre.
Ht also bolirrod It right that the na?

He paid scant attention to the navy.
He did not say that it was adequate.
He did say that "we have always re?
garded it as our proper and natural
means of defence" and added, "but who
shall tell us what sort of a navy to
build?" He asked when experts woald
tell just what kind of ships should be
constructeil and if they would be right
for ten years together, "if the relative
efficiency of craft of different kinds
and uses continues to change, a3 we
have seen it change under our very

He urjrv?! the passage of the ship

bills. His programme of business leg?

the Baaatl should pass the Philippine

but thought such legislation was not
in shape for enactment.
The Senators, the Representative?
and the crowd which thronged the gal
uf t* House knew the Presi?
dent's views on these questions were
purely legislative and waited expect?
antly for his views on the question of
national defence.
These were not expressed until the
last part of the message was reached,
and they were heard amid a quiet in
which the proverbial pin drop could be
heard. Occasionally there was a round
of applause 'rom the majority side, and
once there was an outburst of laughter
as the President laid "we shall not al- i
ter our attitude toward it because som,
among us are nervous and excite?!."
There wero words of disapproval at
t! Presiilent's views among many of
t Senators and Representatives as
they gathered in the cloakroom. To
them there seemed no doubt that the
President believed interest in national
defence was confined to whether or not
a conscription act sriould raise a large
stai.ding army similar to that of the
European governments.
Senators and Representatives ex?
pressed the opinion that they did not
want a large standing army any more
than the President did, but they did
want to know what the condition of the
army and navy--especially the navy
was at the present time, in view of the
many reports that its once efficient or?
ganization had been broken down.

Vienna reports a defeat for the Russian besieging army around Cra?
cow, on the Galician border. The Tzar's forces, it is stated, were driven
from Williczka and Pobezyce, suburbs of the fortified city. The com?
muniqu? says 5,000 prisoners were taken. The official report ttom Petro?
grad is taken to confirm the German statement that Lodz had been
captured. Both armies in Western Poland are preparing for another
great struggle.
In Flanders the Germans appear to have renewed thi<ir offensive.
The French War Office reports that the Allies have repulsed a violent
attack south of Ypres, and unofficial reports say that there is lirrce fight?
ing along the Yser Canal, from near Ypres northward to the coast. At
other parts of the western front the fighting has been unimportant. A
late dispatch says that the Belgian coast from Xieuport to Ostend is being
bombarded.
London, Dec. 9. A dispatch to "Tha
Daily Mail" from F'.otterdam ?ays that
a bombardment of the Belgian coast
Sea Ostend and Nieuport began r.t
3 o'clock yesterday afternoon in con?
junction with land operations.
A correspondent of "The Daily Ex
'' telegraphing from the Belgian
frontier, says:
"The German divisional headquar?
ters was removed from Koulers when
shells began to fall in the town after
tho British had recaptured Passchen
dai le, eleven miles northeast of Ypres.
"This indicates a distinct and im?
portan', advance by the Allies."
London, Dec. la- -Fierce fighting at
points along the Flanders battle front
is mentioned in to-day'a dispatches.
Tha fragmentary reporta indicate that
the Germans are on the offensive from
a point south of Ypres northward
aloi.g the Yscr Canal to the coast, a
distant? of approximately twenty-five
miles.
The French official report to-night
announces that ?he Germans have
made a violent attack upon the Allies

was repulsed. This may mean a re?
newal of the German attempt to bat?

A wireless dispatch from Berl?n
quotes the German headquarters staff

Whether this has reference to the bom?
bardment of a coast town west of Niets? \
