IK TUET MESSAGE
PRESIDENT POINTS OUT NECES
SITY OF CURTAILING EXPEN
SES TO LAWMAKERS.
ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ
Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For
tification of Panama Canal Lead
ing Topics Discussed— Has
Little to Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Economy in
go vernment affairs is the keynote of
President Taft's annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and is one of the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs in
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy in government expenditures, the
president says: "Every effort lias been
made by eaeh department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of Iiis department for
the ensuing tisi-;il year ending June 30.
IPl?. I say this in order that congress
may understand that those estimates thus
made present the smallest sum which will
maintain the departments, bureaus and
otliees of the government and meet its
other obligations under existing law, and
that a cut of these estimates would re
prit in embarrassing the executive branch
of the government in the performance of
Its duties. This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates, except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does it apply to the
public building bill nor to the navy bir'ld
ing program. Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all of
the estimates fer them without interfer
ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of its depart
ments. bureaus and offices.
"Against the estimates of expenditures
ffilO.494,013.12, we have estimated receipts
for next year $0*1 rv y.oOO, making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about $00,0(y 000, or
tal-insr into account the estimates fer the
Panama canal, which are P2i.S47.69, and
which will ultimately be paid in bonds.
It will leave a deficit for the next year of
about Î7. COO.000, if congress shall conclude
to fortify the canal."
Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he de
votes considerable space to forest, coal,
oil and gas, phosphate lands and water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands he sirs: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
lands in Ore eon. Washington, Idaho,
Montana, Colorado and Wyoming, except
by act of congress. I am informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov
ernment owns other tracts of timber lnnd
in these states which should he included
in the forest reserves. I recommend to
congress that the limitation herein im
posed he repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power of reservation only with
respect to land most valuable for forest
purposes. T'urine the present administra
tion ft2.li.~0 r.00 acres of land largely non
timhered have been excluded from forest
reserves, and S . SW . oqo acres of land prin
cipally valuable fnr forest purposes have
been included in forest reserves, making
a reduction in forest reserves of non
11 inhered land amounting to 2,7."0,000
acres."
Wants Canal Fortified.
Regarding the Panama canal, the presi
dent asser's that unless unexpected ob
stacles ar'se the waterway will be com
pleted well within time l'mit of Janu
nrv 1. 1115, and wilhln estimate of cost,
. ocioooo. Suggestions for levying of
to'!« and management are made, and re
garding fortification of the canal, he
says :
"Among questions arising for present
solution Is the decision whether the canal
shall l>e fortified. I have already stated
to the congress that I stronglv favor for
tification and T now reiterate this opin
ion and ask your con:.!deration of the
Bubieet in the light of the report already
before you made bv a competent hoard.
"Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the attainment of both these aims
in the position of r : glits and obligations
■which we should be powerless to enforce
find which could never in any way be ab
solutely safeguarded against a desperate
and irresponsible enemv."
Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such action as he
believes will increase American trade
abroad, and says::
"Another instrumentality indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce is merchant
marine. All maritime and commercial na
tions recognize the importance of this
factor The greatest commercial nations
our competitors, jealously foster their
merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere Is
the need for rapid and direct mall, pas
senger and freight communication ' quite
so urgent as between the United States
and T.atin America. We can secure In no
other quarter of the world such Imme
diate benefits in friendship and com
merce as would flow from the establish
ment of direct lines of communication
with the countries of Datln America ade
quate to meet the requirements of a rap
idly increasing appreciation of the reci
procal dependence of the countries of the
western hemisphere upon each other's
products, sympathies and assistance.
"I alluded to this most important sub
ject in my last annual message; it has
often been before you and I need not re
capitulate the reasons for its recommen
dation. Unless prompt action be taken
the completion of the Panama canal will
ünr" this the only great commercial na
tlon unable to avail In International mari
time business of this great contribution to
the means of the world's commercial In«
tercourse."
Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to the tariff th»
president says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty In
the Payne tariff act have been subjected
to a great deal of criticism, some of it
just, more of it unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The act was adopted
in pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which is responsible for it that cus
toms bill should be a tariff for the pro
tection of home Industries, the measure
of the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the Imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
it at home, together with such addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff is that in
respect to a number of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference retained or Inserted by
way of undue discrimination in favor of
certain Industries and manufactures. Lit
tle, if any. of the criticism of the tariff
has been directed against the protective
principle above stated: but the main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to investigate
the cost of production of various articles
included in the schedules of the tariff,
and concludes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, and the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home indus
tries, are questions which the peop'e must
decide through their chosen representa
tives. Put whatever policy Is adopted, it
is clear that the necessary legislation
should he based on an impartial, thor
ough and continuous study of the facts.'
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption of the parcels post Is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says: "With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend Its adop
tion on all rural delivery routes, and that
11 pounds—the international limit—be
made the limit of carriage in such post.
Th« same argument is made against the
parcels post that was made against th®
postal savings bank—that it is Introduc
ing the government into a business which
should be conducted by private persons
and is paternalism. The postofllee depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization, reaching into the most remntu
hamlet of the United States, and with
this machinery it is able to do a great
many things economically that If a new
organization were necessary it would be
impossible to do without extravagant ex«
penditures."
Department of Justice.
Discussing the affair^ of the department
of justice, the president says:
"I invite especial attent'on to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called 'bucket shops,' and of those
schemes to defraud in which the use of
the mail is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have saved ignorant and weak members
of the.publ'c and are saving them hun
dreds of millions, of dollars. The viola
tions of the anti-trust law present per
haps the most important litigation before
the department, and th< number of c .ascg
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment in enforcing that statute.
"Tn a spce'al message last year T
a spce'al message last year
the
brought to the at">ntion of coner
propriety and wisdom of enacting a eon
era! law providing for the incorporation
of industrial and other companies engaged
in Interstate commerce, and I renew my
recommendation in that behalf."
The erving need in the United States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
is urged.
The president recommends an increase
in the salaries of federal judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to its present effl.
cient management and the recent reduc
tion In the deficit. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes in fof
comment with a suggestion for the adop.
tion of better methods for Its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption,
and continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard,
and has studied the uses of the navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our fleet. With a fleet considerably
less than half the size of that of the
Pritish navy, we have shipyards more
than double the number, and there are
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mchinery, which,
after investigation the secretary of
navy believes to be entirely useless
naval purposes. Tie asks authority
abandon certain of them and to move
their machinery to other places, where it
can he made of use."
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign relations of the United States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two impor
tant international controversies before the
permanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United Slates and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since the fisheries convention of 1918,
has given an award which is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because of
the eminently just results secured, but
also because it is the first arbitration held
under the eeneral arbitration treaty of
April 4, 190S. between the United States
and Great Uritain, and disposes of a con
troversy I lie settlement of which has re
sisted every other resource of diplomacy
and which for nearly ninety years has
been the cause of friction between two
countries whose common Interest lies In
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations with each other.
President Taft makes a few recommen
dations for changes in the interstate com
merce law and says:
"Except as above, I do not recommend
any amendment to the Interstate com
merce law as It stands. I do not now
recommend any amendment to the anti
trust law. In other words. It seems to
me that the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpora
tions and the restraint of their business
has reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of the
vigorous execution of the laws of the
statute books in restraining the abuses
which certainly did exist and whioh
roused the public to demand reform."

Saw Only Physical Idea.
One of his friends once asked Mr.
Darwin's gardener about his master's
health, and how he had been lately.
"Oh!" he said, "my poor master has
been very sadly. I often wish he
had something to do. He moons about
in the garden, and I have seen him
stand doing nothing before a flower
for ten minutes at a time. If he only
had something to do 1 really believe
he would be better."
Putting in the Time.
A gentleman was engaging a gen
oral man and telling him what he
wanted him to do. "You will have to
clean the windows and the boots and
the knives, and go messages, chop
wood, cut short grass, mind the horse
and pony, look after the garden and
keep the house supplied with vege
tables and do any odd job that is re
quired and if suitable you will get
ten shillings a week."
"Is there any clay in the garden?"
asked the man.
"What makes you ask that?" asked
the gentleman.
"I was thinking I could make bricks
m my spare time," said the man.

said, "I'll not waste my time on you."
Paris green performer much aston
ished and grieved. "Well." he said,
"give me 24 hours to think it over."
Doctor gave him 24 hours and went

MIX THIS FOR RHEUMATISM
Easily Prepared and Inexpensive and
Really Does the Work, Says
Noted Authority.
Thousands of men and women who
have felt the sting and torture of that
dread disease, Rheumatism, which is
no respecter of age, persons, sex,
color or rank, will be interested to
know that it is one of the easiest af
flictions of the human body to con
quer. Medical science has proven it
not a distinct disease in itself, but a
symptom caused by inactive kidneys.
Rheumatism is uric acid in the blood
and other wasle products of the sys
tem which should be filtered and
strained out in the form of urine. The
function of the kidneys is to sift these
poisons and acids out and keep the
blood clean and pure. The kidneys
however, are of sponge-like substance,
the holes or pores of which will some
times, either from overwork, cold or
exposure become clogged, and failing
In their function of eliminating these
poisons from the blood, they remain
in the veins, decompose and settling
about the joints and muscles, cause
the untold suffering and pain of rheu
matism and backache, often producing
complications of bladder and urinary
disease, and general weakness.
The following simple prescription ii
said to relieve the worst cases of
rheumatism because of its direct ac
tion upon the blood and kidneys, re
lieving, too, the most severe forms of
bladder and urinary troubles: Fluid
Extract Dandelion, one-half ounce;
Compound Kargon, one ounce; Com
pound Syrup Sarsaparilla, three
ounces. Mix by shaking well In a bot
tle and take in teaspoonful doses after
each meal and at bedtime. The in
gredients can be had from any pre
scription pharmacy, and are absolutely
harmless and safe to use at any timet
