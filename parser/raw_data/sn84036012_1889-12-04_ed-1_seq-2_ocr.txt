When Ruisell H. Harrison hurrted to
Wamhiaton intent on getting his
hter to help fraud in Montana, he for
get to remind the old gentleman that
Montana would like a little lift on sil
ver. it you don't believe it, read the
paragrph in the Presidents message
eN the silver question.
You can get the I4TANiARDg for a
whole month at the modest price of one
dollar. To every minlr in Montana
this moraing's issue alone is worth that
amount, as it prints the testimony of
th President of the United States to
.howy that, in regard to silver, he ha
"bess able to ive only hasty examina
Men to the subject owing to the pres
sure of other matters!" Wall street
pressure in partleular.
Every newspaper ofnce knows that
th President's messaege was not wired
Ia time, yesterday, to afford opport'un
l~ for editorial comment in afternoon
eiions. Under the circumstances, the
Dltte later Mountais was forced to
imit its comment to a brief paragraph
Ia which it remarks that 'the silver
gqustiok does not receive as much at
teNtlon as its importance demands."
Well, If we were guests of the Inter
Meestaens, at the Silver flow club, with
the text of the message before us we
sheuld smile.
It tell to the nTAwNI.An to satisfy
the Butte Inter Monetain that Thomas
B. Read. speaker of the house of repre
sentatives has been persistently and
.aunspl.mo..ly the enemy of silver.
That is his record to day and date, and
Thomas II. Carter, of Montana, was
eomapieuous among the men who
helped to put Reed in the speaker's
hair. This is a good subject to keep
up, and regarding it the nTANI)Alr will
answer the slightest invitation of the
republican press every time.
Nhbady em guess what may be in
the mid of gentlemen at Helena who
are waiting for the right thing to turn
up. It is certain, however, that there
is no shadow of substance behind the
enrerat story that a plan is under con
slieration for a compromise look
lag toward the election of
one democrat and one republican
eor membership in the federal senate.
That is a proposition which no demo
rat will approve and which no repre
sentative of the democratic party at
Hedssa has a right to entertain. The
demoeratic party claims to have
elected a majority of the legislature.
That body elects federal senators. Its
two or nothing---and that's all there is
ef it. Days ago the republicans were
willingly open to compromise on this
question, but no democrat was found
ready to meet them; nor will there be.
For all suggestion on the silver ques
tUae, President lHarrison blandly refers
the eontry to the recommendations
of Secretary Windom. Under the rule,
that officer's report should reach news
paper oeices at the same hour with the
message of the President. However our
good comtemporaries mayhave faredthe
lTAxNDARD is bound to admit that Mr.
Windom's report is not yet at hand, so
that there is no telling what his reeom
mendations may be. The Butte Inter
Mourstat. observed, yesterday after
noon, that the country could afford to
give Mr. Windom leave of absence for
three years, at double pay, so far as
lead mining interests are concerned.
When it has read the disappointing
truck in the president's message about
silver, our Butte neighbor will doubt
less move as an amendment that liar
raom join Windom ln an interminable
erese, at pay to suit himself.
THE MESSAGE.
The literary crltie will read President
Uarrison's message with surprise, es
peDeatly it he has in mind the graceful
pbrs that were scattered through his
al ddress and puts them in
omarlarona with the paragraphs that
ested the message to fourteen thous
and six hundred and forty words.
Net that the message is unpardon
abty long--t is hardly half as long as
that which Mr. Cleveland sent to con
grass four years ago; but it it be put in
.smperison with the really admirable
nsasgural of Mr. Harrison, the conclu
sion is forced that either the address
o last March was the rhetorical prod
at of some helpful hand, or the mes
sg.e printed this morning was writ
ten with a measure of haste that
harus the reputation of the President
a writer of terse and impressive
W lish. Lest any reader may think
this eoament prompted by partisan
parpas, the STANDAR suggests that
the aemdid critle compare, in point of
literary merit, the inaugural address of
b" March and the annual message
w inh, in al its emential features. is
sammarisd in this morning's S.rx.
i ss tfr the literary features of
the me sage wleb. m, of course, of
minor Importance. The American peo
pie are more for good snse than for
fnished rhetoric; they ar fond of facta
and are not unduly worried about the
grammar. In a general way, the mes
sage is remarkable for the wide range
of topics to which It makes
passing reference. In brief review, Its
introduction recites the relations which
the United States hold with foreign
powers, referring particularly to the im
portant results that may flow from the
conference of the representative of the
guvernments of North and Mouth
A merica. The army and navy, home
affairs and foreign relations, copyright
and coast defense, commerce. bank
ruptcy and postal affairs and the In
dian qtestion, are among the themes to
which attention is given.
Iegarding the qlletion of pensions,
the message has no suggestion of ac
count to soldiers of the republic and
gives not even a passing reference to
the recommendations of Secretary
Proctor. As to civil service, the
President mildly reflects the utterance.
of his iniaugural, leaving the country in
doubt as to his opinion of the conduct
of the civil service commission and re
peating platitudes which do not har
monize with his own conduct and
which are an insincere. when measured
by his action, as the declamations of
any national convention.
Every reader of the STANDAIAn will
wonder why President Harrison failed
to put himself on record on the ques
tion of the transcontinental railroads
and the people of the Northwest. The
story runs that the white house knows
all about what is going on in this sec
tion of the Union, as the oMclal house
hold has a representative in Montana,
in the person of the hresident's son
whose chief title to notoriety is that he
is a busybody in other men's matters.
If the royal Infant had not been chiefly
engaged in coaxing the President to
help along in the consummation of
fraud in the Montana election returns,
there would doubtless have been space
in the message for a refer
ence to the tight which this
new state is waging against an arro
gant railway corporation, a tight so
large in its proportions that it is well
entitled to mention, at least, in any
message of any president.
Hlowever, the average western man
will forgive anything if only the mes
sage takes broad grounds on the salver
question. Iead what Mr. Harrison
says on that question. (live all else in
the president's columns of annual talk
the merest passing glance, if you
choose, but scan closely the paragraphs
touching the silver question, and then
make up your mind as to where the re
publican Iresident of the United rstates
stands on this vital question. The lan
guage of tre message itself is too plain
to need any added comment. ( n this
cardinal question, the message is abso
lutely without remark that is friendly
to the cause of silver, the best inten
tions of the President finding expres
sion in the sentence that "he has been
able to give only a hasty examination
to the subject, owing to the pressure of
other matters!"
Every line of the message referring
to the silver question is carefully
quoted in the columns of the STAN
ARDK) this morning. These show hres
ident Harrison to be actually afraid of
the coinage of silver, opposed to its
liberal treatment and utterly at va
rlance with the sentiment which shows
how the debtor clam of this country
may profit by its liberal purchase. To
put the situation in a sentence, we af
firm that this country has not read.
in sixteen years, a more cowardly
message to congress on the silver ques
tion than that of President larrison- -
and if any republican newspaper wishes
to call this broad declaration in ques
tion, this is the proper time and place
to start the discussion.
Time and again, the STANDARD has
asserted that the hope of the West is in
congress, not in the lresident. IRead
the flabby phrases of the Hlarrison mes
sage in relation to silver, as we print
them this morning, and see whether
they sustain that declaration.

The New York Tribe u, prints a story
from Boston about George Francis Train.
whick-h says that moon after Mr. Train was
reileased from imprisonment thber thi
otLher day, being in one of his most saes
tric moods, he collected a little erowd
around him in the corrikors of one of the
big hotels by proclaiming in stentorian
tones that be was the biggest ftol in
Am.erica. After repeating this staisamnat
several times and finding no one to ea
tradlet him,. he offered to bet a eonsldr
able sum that he knew what be was talk
ing about and that what he maid was trne.
At this a betting man, who had not taken
any notice of the speaker at first, e1
owed his way thrmough the little knot of
listeners and, evklently not knowing the
face and figure of the "Sage of Madison
Square," about whom he had read a loed
lheal in the newspapers, maid: *Look

you are not George Francis Train."

I6 years of age, the Judliclary aondsNe
has reported a substitute prohibiting Oe
manufacture and sale of cigarettes wllp
the borders of the state altogether. In the
debate that followed it appears that some
of the gentlemen took the ground that
prohhibition does not prohibit, or in other
words that the prohibition of eigarettes
would be as futile and impracticable as
the prohibition of whisky. At any rate
the cigarette should te submitted to a
vote of the people. Al, however,
agreed that the prohibition of
cigarettes to persons under 16
was a wise and patriotic messure. A menm
ber of the house the namI of Tucker
went at the merits of the question, argu*
nlu that if our hors and girls learned to
mnmoke cigarrettes, by and by they would
he smoking cigars and pipesand he could
nlnt tell what would happen after that.
We agree with Mr. Tucker that it our
girls took to smoking cigars and pipes
there is no telling what would happen. al
though we strongly suspect that there
would he cosiderable sickness and poa
sibly some spanking in the family. But it
our hrys should throw away their cigar
ettes for cigarl and pipes-it Is too horri

Thomas A. Edison's latest achievement
is the invention of a light by which pic

advantages of daylight. Electric lights
have heretofore thrown either too hril

a perfect light for pictures by placing at
the back of the bulbs in his system of
lighting a lead piece covering half of the
bulb and fitting it closely. Inside of the
bulb ir a coating of silver. The natural
yellow of the light and the silver rellee

out all the colors in a picture harmonious

their relations grew more intimate. Prior
