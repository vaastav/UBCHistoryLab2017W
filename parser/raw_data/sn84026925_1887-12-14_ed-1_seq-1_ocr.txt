Those who have followed somewhat closely
the career of Gen. McOlellan cannot fail to
be impressed that there was a fate which
more than once deprived him of victory at
the. moment it seemed surely in his grasp.
Jest before the beginning of Pope's campaign
in Virginia, while the Army of the Potomac
was still on the James below Richmond, McClellan
announced himself ready to strike the
Confederate capital. Even he seemed to be
satisfied that his army was ready and sufficiently
large. If he had attacked Rich, .ml
just at that time, early in August, 1663,
it could have been taken, most likely, for Lee
had well nigh stripp i it of defenders to send
10911 ugainst Pope in Northern Virginia.
But at the very time McClellan was giving
orders to advance on Richmond, Halleck sent
bim a peremptory command to quit the
peninsula with his army and prepare to cooperate
with Pope. Nothing was left but to
obey, and McClellan's opportunity was lost.
After the battle of Antietam, Sept 17,
1863. there was an interval of doing nothing.
McClellan distributed his army along the
Maryland side of the Potomac, watching its
fords. He evidently thought the used up
army of Lee might attempt another invasion
of Maryland. He called vigorously for reenforcements,
supplies of all kinds. By the
last of September he had an army of 100,000
men, still on the Maryland side of the Poto
mac. Oct. 6 President Lincoln directed the
general to "cross the Potomac and give battle
to the enemy, or drive him south."
But McClellan was not yet ready to do so.
While he was waiting, that dashing Confederate
cavalry leader, J. E. B. Stuart,
made one of his characteristic raids, and,
figuratively speaking, tweaked the nose
of the whole Army of the Potomac under
the eyes of its commander. Oct. 10 ho
crossed the Potomac into Maryland with 1
1,800 cavalry, near Williamsport, galloped
northward into Chambersburg, 1
Pa., destroyed the public property there,
E turned southward,
circled around McClellan's
array
lying on the Potomac,
hurried
down the mouth of
the Monocacy, in
Maryland, and
then recrossed into
Virginia and
joined Lee. Thus
a second time this
bold raider rode
^ around McClellan's
whole army.
gen. burnside. The weeks went
on. Daily, as of old, the newspaper head
lines announced, "All quiet on the Potomac."
T&eu the old impatience and dissatisfaction
broke out anew, and the country began to
wonder why it was so quiet along the Potomac.
More weeks went on till it was six weeks ;
after the battle of Antietam, and nothing
done. By that time Lee's army was thoroughly
rested and re-enforced, and amounted
to 70,000. To the president's orders to move
against him early in October McClellan had
answered that he must have new cavalry
horses. By the last of October he concluded
that ho was ready to cross the Potomac. The
crossing was actually made Nov. 2.
McClellan ordered his main army to concentrate
at Warrenton, Va. On this Lee, his
army in good trim, his communications with
Richmond perfect, resolved to retreat southward.
The main portion of the Confederate
army marched up the Shenandoah valley,
turned off to the Rappahannock and took position
at Culpepper. Stonewall Jackson's
command, with the cavalry under J. E. 15.
Stuart, remained behind to hang upon tho
Union army and annoy and delay it as fnr
as possible till the main Confederate body
should be secure.
If one could have stood upon a peak of the 1
Blue Ridge mountains of a bright morning in |
thoso early days of November, 1862, he would
have seen a sight to thrill gods and men. On
the east side of the ridge McClellan's mighty
army of over 100,000 men marched with waving
banners and
gleaming guns
south to Warren- [
ton. Gen. Alfred
Pleasonton led the
advance with the ^j

moving southward.
It was Lee's Army '
of Northern Vir- / \
gin in. Tho two gen*, pleasonton. i
hostile forces were sometimes only a few milei I
apart in this race southward, but with tht |
ridge between them. But Leo moved raor?
rapidly. His advance, under Longstreet,
hurried forward, crossed the mountains and
took position at Culpepper Nov. 3.
This rapid marching, however, separated |
Lee's army more than was safe. Jackson and j
tho cavalry were three days behind him.
Perceiving this, McClellan at length detei>
mined, of his own free will, to give battle. H?
believed that he could now strike a fatal i
blow. His army was at Warrenton, Lee's I
advance at Culpepper, some ten miles south, j
He said afterward of the situation: 'T did expect
I could either separate them and beat ;
tiem in detail, or else force them to concen. j
trate as far back as Gordonsville, aud thui
place the Army of the Potomac in positior
either to adopt the Fredericksburg line ol ;
advance upon Richmond or to be removed tt
the peninsula."
The good weather of the autumn had by
that time passed away. McClellan now.
however, seemed to be thoroughly alive anc
. f in full vigor of determination. The night ot
Nov. 7 there was a heavy rain over the camp
of the Army of the Potomac. Gen. McCleh

It was an order relieving him from com- i
mand of the Army of the Potomac, and np? !

place. With that the name of Gen. McClel- j
lan disappears from American military history.
He resigned his commission in th?
army; however, not until the day or tha I
presidential election in 1884, when he was the j
car lidate ngainsc Lincoln.
Thus apparently again in the moment of ,
success, McClellan's adverse fate interposed !
niul snatched it from hiin.
BURNSIDE'S CAMPAIGN.
Gen. Burnside was a man of fine, soldierly
presence, and highly esteemed. He was born j
in Libert}', Ind., in 1824, and was graduated
at West Point in 1847, just in time to be sent
to Mexico. He afterwards resigned from the j
army and established a factory for making j
a breech loading rifle of his own invention ,
in Rhode Island. His career was a varied I
one, and when the war began, in 1801, ho ;
was an officer of the Illinois Central railroad, j
Ho immediately joined the Union army as
colonel of a Rhode Island regiment, and roso j
to be a major general of volunteers inline- j
diately after the first Bull Run. He was put to j
duty along the Atlantic coast, and Newbern, j
Beaufort and Roanoke Island were trophies !
of his military ability.
At the beginning of Pope's campaign he
was called to Virginia. He performed active j
and distinguished service through that and j
the Maryland campaign. So well was he [
thought of that the command of the Army j
of the Potomac had been offered to him twice |
before ho accepted it, and each time he had j
refused it. His modesty seems to have been {
unequaled in the history of army officers.
The Army of the Potomac "had already
been the grave of the military reputations of
McClellan and Pope. Burnside's name was
to add the third to the hapless list After
his Fredericksburg campaign he was sent west i
and performed distinguished service in the
department of the Ohio, freeing east Tennes- 1
see at lengtli from the Confederates. During
the final campaign against Richmond ho was
in the east again and commanded his old 1
Ninth corps, contributing not a little to the i
closing victory.
After the war he was three terms gov- I
ernor of Rhode Island. He was in Europe i
during the Franco-German war, and was ad- i
tmitted within the i
belligerent lines. 1
He returned and i
represented Rhode i
Island in the Uni- i
ted States Senate. . <
While serving in I |
1881 he died, re- I
came placing him '
at the head of the I 1
fXY" v "*? Army or rue .ro- |
* tomac, doubtful
gen. parks. still of his capac- ! !
ity for great command, he would have de- j I
clined the responsibility if possible. But the , '
peremptory order from Lincoln left him n'o j
alternative. < )
He decided that .the Union army Bhould 1 <
march on Richmond by way of Fredericks- ;
burg, Va. Richmond was to be the object 1
aimed at, and Acquia Creek was to be his 1
base of supplies.
Once more the battleground is changed to
the cris crossed field of Virginia. 1
Fredericksburg is nearly 100 miles south of J
the field of Antietam. It is on the right bank i
of the Rappahannock river, n little inland ]
from the Potomac, and the railroad leads di- i
rectly south from it to Richmond, fifty miles , 1
distant. ]
Acquia Creek is a town on the Potomac at ' <
the mouth of the creek of the same name. ! i
A railroad leads from it to Fredericksburg.
On the 15th of November, 1862, Burnside began
his grand march to Fredericksburg. He
had organized his army into three "grand
divisions," right, center and left, commanded,
respectively, by Sumner, Hooker and Franklin.
They left Warrenton,. Va., as their
starting point. By Nov. 19 the three grand
divisions were in the vicinity of Fredericksburg,
on the east side of the Rappahannock.
Sumner's grand division reached Fol- |
mouth, directly opposite Fredericksburg,
Nov. 17. He was not permitted by Burnside
to cross, however, and that very day Lee
sent a large body of troops to re-enforce the
Confederate garrison there. <
Burnside began at once to put in order the
railroad from Acquia Creek to Fredericksburg,
to make sure of receiving his supplies.
Gen. H. J. Hunt was Burnside's chief of ar- |
tillery. He posted all the guns on the Federal ,
side of the Rappahannock,
and
superintended their tsn
transportation JR
from Acquia Creek. WXaajp
He decided that it
was necessary to * Jyj
plant guns upon the WmESXYoIh1-''
heights above the
left bank of the ^
Rappahannock inI ^
sufficient number^
to cover the entire^^^HP^^^g^/^^^ J
length of the oppo- u) \ <t> ' <
sing forces on the ' '
right bank. Henry gen. hunt.
Jackson Hunt was born in 1821 in Ohio, like 1
his commander a western man, also a West | '
Point graduate. He finished the course of in- |
struction there when only 18 years old. During
the Mexican war he became major of artillery,
and was afterwards especially identi- j
fled with that arm of the service. He was 1
McClellan's chief of staff during the peninsu- 1
lar campaign. During the whole war he <
served in the Army of the Potomac, and was 1
one of its most faithful and useful officers. 1
R.n.i.ciHo's oliiof envnlrv commander con- ! f
tinuea to be Gen. Alfred Pleasonton. Pleasonton
was born at W ashineton city, in 1824, i
and was the same age as Burnside. He en- | .
tered the cavalry service when he left West | <
Poiut, in 18-14. and was sent to Mexico. He j 1
remained in the west and southwest on dutv i
most of the time till the outbreak of the civil
war. At Fredericksburg he held the rank of I
brigadier general of volunteers. He saw j
severe fighting thero and subsequently at | '
Ckancellorsville nDd Gettysburg. After- I j
wards he was ordered west, and his troopers I 1
helped clear Missouri of Sterling Price's men \ ,
in 1864.
In 180S Gen. Pleasonton resigned from the i J
army and engaged in mining and other busi- j 1
ness. His advocacy of the blue glass theory is i
well known.
Burnside's chief of staff was Brig. Gen. f
John G. Parke, said to be one of the ,
handsomest of the accomplished officers ,
grouped about the headquarters of
the Army of the Potomac. Parke was J
a Pennsylvanian. born in 1827, and a ! '
West Poiuter of 1849. He entered the engi- [ 1
neer corps. He had been a brigadier general ]
on the Isorth CarolinaToast under Burnside, j
and, with his old commander, joined the ,
Army of the Potomac. He afterwards was 1
ordered south and west. He took active part
in the siege of Vicksburg, also of Knoxville.
He followed the fortunes of Burnside. At
the fiual battles before Richmond, and previous
to that, in 1864, Gen. Parke, under
Burnside, commanded the old Ninth corps.
Gen. Parke is now superintendent at West
Point.
Military critics declare that Burnside
should have aimed at Lee's army rather than
at Richmond. At all events, he determined
to occupy Fredericksburg immediately. Public
sentiment and the newspapers demanded
that something should be done at once.
While Burnside was making a way for the
transportation of supplies the Confederates
were fortifying Fredericksburg and the
heights l?ehind it. Attheendof November
Lee's whole armv lay in a crescent around '
Fredericksburg. Its right was at Port Royal,
below the town; the left a little distance
above. The Confederate fortifications were
truly formidatl j, so as to render crossing directly
in front of the city hopeless. But pontoon
bridges were prepared by Burnside, and
he arranged to cross the Rappahannock at
Skenker's Neck, twelve miles below. Leo
discovered this move in time to frustrate it.
There seem to have been ways whereby
Burnside's plans were constantly discovered
to Lee, and that almost immediately.
With a large portion of Lee's" army at
DKenKers necs, jDuriiMuu next uiuu^ut uo ,
could force the passage of the Rappahannock !
and take Fredericksburg under ttie guns of I
those who were left. The Union artillery j ,
was planted upon Stafford Heights, above ,
Falmouth. It commanded the whole plain of 1
Fredericksburg.
Lee was so well informed of all that went j
on in the Union army that within twentyfour
hours after McClellan had been super- j
seded by Burnside he was informed of it.
LEE'S GENERALS.
Around Lee in that deadly crescent upon |
the heights of Fredericksburg were group's! i
the tried generals whose stubborn fighting j
qualities had enabled him to carry dismay to j
the Army of the Potomac more thau once, j
Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, the Hills, i
Jubal Early and Stuart, with his cavalrymen,
were waiting for the deadly grapple j
with Burnside's men.

v. mouth, opposite ,

fs? Lee sent two divis- )

Gen. Ransom is now United States Senator .
Matt. W. Ransom, from North Carolina.
Gen. Ransom, was a native of North Carolina,
born in 1826. He was educated in his
own state, became a lawyer, and held variouslocal
offices previous to the civil war. Then
he entered the Confederate army and passed
up through various promotions to the rank of
major general. Ho continued in the Army
of Northern Virginia till the end, and surrendered
with Lee at Appomattox. He is j
now serving his third consecutive term in the
United States senate.
Another Confederate general who has entered
Washington by a different route from
the one he proposed twenty-five years ago is
Wade Hampton, United States senator from -j
South Carolina. He too was at Fredericksburg
and commanded a brigade of cavalry,
W. IL F. Lee commanding another. J. E. ,
B. Stuart was the division cavalry com- ;
mander. "

the Confederate cavalry service. Lee placed

called Wade Hampton, was likewise a soldier
ana ponucian. xie was an umcer m iub ievaluticn
and a member of congress in 1795.
The old man died^tJofcunbia, S. C., in 1834,

United States. . r
The 'name of Lee was numerously represented
in the officers grouped around the j
Confederate commander. Brig. Gen. W. H. ]
F. Lee, the cavalry commander, was Robert ]
E.'s second son. Robert E.'s nephew, Fitz
Eugh, also a cavalryman, held a prominent ,
command in the Army of Northern Virginia, i
All of Lee's sons?three of them?served in j
the Confederate army. The eldest, G.W. C., i

Gen. Richard H. Anderson, division com- f

others, passed through the ordeal of fighting. c
He had aided in the capture of Harper's i
Ferry, had been sharply engaged at Antie- (
tam, and now with the rest awaited the shock ]
of battle at Fredericksburg. ,
Gen. Richard H. Anderson was a South
Carolinian, a graduate of the United States ?
Military academy in 1842. He served in
Mexico. When the first probabilities of war 1
began to be talked of ho resigned from the <
United States army in March, 1801. Ho en- i
iered the Confederate service as soon as it
iarae into existence and shortly became a ,
brigadier general. He was wounded at Antietam,
though not mortally like his name- ?

The Confederates always spoke of their 1
army under Lee's immediate command as the t
Army of Northern Virginia, just as the force c
apposed to them was designated throughout ]
the war as tho Army of the .Potomac. * ^
TOPOGRAPHY.
Lee's plan for the battle of Fredericksburg 1
tvas at once simple and admirable. Long- ]
street's corps had been the first to arrive on 1
the ground, and it occupied tho left, with ]
Sen. Richard H. Anderson on the extreme i
left. Stonewall Jackson was on the rights i
ind tho forces of the two joined in tho -enter <
ind encircled Fredericksburg. j
To understand the fight fully, glance at the
iccompanying map. Five miles below Fred- <
iricksburg the little Massaponax river ]
lowed into the Rappahannock from tho west <
A ridge of hills sloped down to the Rappa- <
lannock above, the Massaponax, running <
from the northwest. Five miles above tba ]
Massaponax the ridge retreats from Che river
far enough to leave a plain, and upon th'l ]
plain tho town of Fredericksburg was built. j

FREDERICKSBURG BATTLE GROUND.
Below the town the ridgo again approaches
close to the river. Behind the first range of
hills another rose, as if both were built by
nature for the planting of batteries for the
protection of Fredericksburg. Burnside
could not have selected a worse point for attack
or Lee a better one for defense. The
railroad from Richmond to tho Potomac
river passed through the town.
Leo had 7S,000 men after Jackson joined
him. These began |to. throw up earthworks
in a crescent six miles long, from the Massaponax
to above Fredericksburg. They ,
worked with a will and soon had built those
formidable fortifications against which Burnside's
hapless hosts were to dash themselves ;
like waves against a granite rock.
Nearest the Rappahannock, on the north of
the Confederate left, was Taylor's hill, about ;
which R. H. Anderson's men lay. Next camo i
Ma rye's hill, which gained fatal renown in j
tho battle. Here were others of Longstreet's j
men, Hill, Ransom and McLaws. Across !
Marye's hill ran a stone wall, terracing the
hill. Next came Telegraph hill, the highest \
o{ all. Here Lee stood and directed opera- j
tions in person. For this reason the crest is
now called Lee's hill, and as such is pointed '
out to the visitor. Next after McLaws came
Hood's divisiott on the right. Still farther to I
the right lay Jackson's men, A. P. Hill, j
Early and Tuliaferro. D. H. Hill's command j
was upon the extreme right as a reserve.
So, on the morning of Dec. 10, 1SG2, lay the j
Confederate army awaiting the Federal advance.
Stafford heights, occupied by Burnside's
artillery on the opposite sido of the I
Rappahannock, were higher than the hills orj
the Confederate side, but these, again, were ;
so far distant as to Ikj practically out oi j
range ui iuu uniuu guns.

for the battle, and

use of the time. Mi Jt

and announcing to f ('2W
Lee's army when 'Tu ^
the first crossing
should be nttemDt- u. h. andekson.
Bd. Burnside Lad prepared pontoon bridges.
Dec. 11 was the day he fixed for the crossing. 1
That morning, before daylight, the bridges
were brought down to the shore and
the engineers set to work to construct them.
As the dawn broke, boom! boom! wentun
nnshotted cannon from Maryo's heights, telling
Lee and his men that the time was come.
Barksdale's sharpshooters within the town of '
Fredericksburg began firing on the bridge
builders. They prevented the completion of <
the bridges. The batteries from Stafford
heights were then trained upon Fredericksburg.
They battered it down, yet the sharpshooters
were not dislodged. Then Union
volunteers to cross the river in open boats
and drive out the sharpshooters were called 1
for. This was done with the loss of 300 men,
and the Federals took possession of the river
front of Fredericksburg, Dec. 11. That evening
and the next day Sumner's and Franklin's
grand divisions crossed, leaving part of
Hooker's center grand division on the Falmouth
side.
FREDERI.CKSBURG.
The battle of Fredericksburg took place
Dec. 13. It was a disastrous day to the
Union arms. Burnside's plan of attack was
for Sumner and Franklin to storm the f^rtiEled
Confederate heights above the tow^-fall,

In the midst of u .ense fog, Dec. 12, Sumner's
grand division ad crossed at the upper
pontoon on the right, Franklin's below on the
left. The First. Second, Sixth and Ninth corps
were the troops that had crossed. They were
commanded respectively by Gens. Reynolds,
Couch, W. F. Smith and Willcox. They
formed their lines parallel to the river, except
Sen. Meade's division of the First corps,
tvhich was at right angles to it. Gen. Doublelay's
division was stationed as a reserve in
the rear of Meade on the left.
The fogs of Dec. 12 continued to tho 13th.
Added to this, the weather, for Virginia, was
bitterly cold. It was tho first experience of
?ome of Lee's soldiers with a northern winter, 1
and the night of the 12th some Confederal
sentinels froze at their posts.
Fredericksburg is another of the battles of
the civil war about which there has been
much dispute. It is said on the one hand
that Burnside's order to Franklin as to the
beginning of the fight was ambiguous in meaning.
On the other, Gen. Franklin has been
blamed for not pushing the fight solidly on '
the Federal left, at Hamilton's crossing.
After crossing the Rappahannock, Franklin
was directed by Burnside's order to keep hia
whole command in position for a rapid movement
down the old Richmond road. Burnside
was by no means so well informed of the
strength of the force opposed to him as Lee
seems to have been about Burnside's army.
Franklin's corps began the fight early in
the morning, Dec. 13, with Gen. George G.
Meade in the advance. There were two linet
jf Confederate fortifications along the heights.
Franklin's attack was on the Confederate
right, against Stonewall Jackson. A fearful
storm of shot and shell met the Federals. A.
P. Hill's advance Confederate line was driven
jack, however, but Gregg, Early and Stuart
dosed in and repelled charge after charge.
More than 40 per cent of Meade's command
'ell. Reynolds came to his aid with re-enforcements,
and Reynolds lost 4,000. But
:hey finally drove the Confederates back
omewhat to Massaponax creek. The figh*
letween tho Federal left and Confederufcight
continued two hours.
Sumner's grand division formed the Fediral
right. To it fell the task of storrainjj
ilarye's hill, tho most formidable of the Coeederate
works. Lee's officers say that when
heir general discovered that Burnside wti
ibout to attack his works on Fredericksburg
leights he was greatly rejoiced. He felt that bo
:ould hold them well nigh against the world.
Longstreet's chief of artillery said to him the
noming of Dec. 13, as they looked over the
jround in front of Marye's hill:
"General, we cover that ground now so
.?t1 wt'11 vi.nvw'K mo wifli o flna fnnth
rVCli tuai ?c rviLi Wiiik/ *w 1*0 iuvu w ?wW?.
:omb. A chicken could not live on that Held,
vhen we open on it."
There is one fact connected with this tin*?
vhich renders it exceedingly, difficult to get
it the exact truth in its history. The reports
ind accounts given by army officers and con;emporarv
correspondents are manifestly
;inged. with the pro or unti-McClellan partisanship.
The position of neither Pope nor
Burnside as commander of the Army of the
Potomac was a pleasant one, and that fact
seeds to be borne in mind constantly.
Brig. Gen. J. F. Reynolds commanded the
First corps in Franklin's left grand division.
Franklin considered that three divisions of
Reynolds' corps were sufficient to carry out
Burnside's order, which he understood to
xtean that he should make a reconnoissance
rather than a serious attack. To Reynolds was
leputed this task, and to bis corps belonged
Meade's division.
Gen. 0. 0. Howard commanded the Second
me of the awful V
Marye'shill.
Howard was born
ind was graduated t

some time after his graduation. Ho was
actively engaged in fighting from the beginning
of iho civil war. Ho commanded a
brigade at Bull. Run, nnd was made a brigaiier
general in September, 1861. The "empty
sleeve" familiar in his portraits has been carried
since 1862 at the battle of Fair Oaks,
where he lost the right arm that filled it. At
Antietam he was in command of Sumner's
rorps. In 1863 he had commaud of the
Eleventh corps.
Gen. Howard distinguishes! himself at
Gettysburg. Afterward he was ordered
west, participated in the fights of Lookout
Mountain and Missionary Ridge and helped
relieve Knoxville. During Sherman's march
to the sea and up to the time of Johnston's
surrender Howard commanded the right wing
of the army. After the war he was United
States commissioner of the freed men's bureau.

been especially employed in government educational
and benevolent enterprises. In 1886
he was promoted to be one of the three major

of the department of the Pacific.
Stoneman's corps of Hooker's grand division
was pushed up behind the divisions of
Franklin on the Federal left at Fredericksburg
in time to aid in the repulse of the Confederates
there. His advantage was not
[lushed by Franklin. He considered that his
orders from Burnside did not justify him in
doing so. Burnside, in the course of the
day, sent an order for him to attack on the
front, but by the time it reached Franklin it
was too near dark for it to be obeyed, the
latter general considered. So the lighting of
the left grand division at Fredericksburg was
over.

Sumner's right grand division was to do the
fighting on Franklin's right. Sumner's task
was to assault and y s.

afterward. It is rather a strange whim of
fate that the name of so bravo and accomplished
a general as William Henry French
should be so little known to his countrymen.
Some of the bloodiest fighting of this or
uny war was uui;.e uy him ami niiiic'iuK s uivj i
sions that day at Fredericksburg. They lost
fully two-fifths of their men.
\V. H. French was born in Maryland in
1815. He was a graduate of West Point, and
fought in the Indian war in Florida in 1837;
also in the Mexican war. He was first in
command at Key West during the civil war,
but was transferrer! to the Army of the Potomac.
He became a major general of volunteers
in 1802. After the war ho was in the
artillery service on the Pacific coast. Gen.
French died in 1881.
As the fog lifted in the course of the forenoon
Longstreet beheld from the heights of
Marye's hill French and Hancock advancing
in two columns to the assault. They cume by
two parallel roads, the Orange plank road
and the Telegraph road. The Telegraph road
led to Richmond.
A deep ravine separated the advancihg
troops from the foot of Marye's hill. The
Telegraph road 6kirted along the foot of
Marye's hill. The road, indeed, had been cut
out of the hill's side and was twenty-five feet
Wide. On one side of it was the hill, upon the
Other a high stone wall had been built. This in
Wall was as high as a man's shoulders.
f THE TERRIBLE STONE WALL. Df
In every great battle there is somo point ri;
BDout which the slaughter is thickest. At jK
Fredericksburg it wa3 the stone wall upon
?ho outer edge of Telegraph road. Behind
this wall the road was pxactically a sunken ; ^j
one. It was quite invisible to the advancing
Federals. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
w
V THE STONE WALL. V]
Longstreet perceived at once the advantage s>
of this position. Behind the high wail las
stationed some 2,500 soldiers, under command
of Gens. Kershaw and T. R R Cobb. Thus, of
like Antietam, Fredericksburg, too, had it* CC
sunken road. \y
Up toward the fatal stone wall and tfcr. (j j
sunken road came the columns of the Union a[
army. They massed upon the narrow plain at ^
the foot of Marye's hill. Abovo them, tlva
moment they came within range, the Confed- .
erato artillery upon the heights poured hot
fire into them. It cut great holes iii thei* Sl^
ranks?gaps which could bo seen a mil%
Longstreet says. In a moment the gaps were ?)'
closed again, however, and the devoted men J1'
marched on. ;u
Half the narrow plain at the foot of in
Marye's hill was crossed, when, lo! it seemed SU
as if all the thunders and lightnings of heaven to
burst upon them. A living sheet of lirt m
blinded their eyes, an infernal din roared in \v
their ears, and when it passed hundreds of til
brave men lay upon that plain, never more to fe
see or hear aught with earthly eyes or ears tr
n?rnin. t:
O * tl'
The deadly lightnings shot forth from ^
Longstrcet's hidden guns behind the stone ftj
wall in the sunken road. .
Against that fire no living thing could R.
stand. French's soldiers fell hack. Hancock's
came on gallantly. Another sheet of
living fire, another infernal roar, and hun- p<
dreds of .other bodies were piled upon those je
that already lay upon the ghastly plain. One 1 n
brigade after another came on, each in its dl
turn to be mown down and hurled back, us
Those W1.0 saw the assault of Mnrye's hill at 0f
the sunken road one and all speak of it as a V(
succession of waves of living human beings m
in turn dashed and broken against the stone
wall. aj
After French's and Hancock's divisions were
repulsed, Howard's threw itself against the
wall. It, too, was driven back, broken und P
bleeding. That iluished the available strength
of the Second corps, Gen. Couch's. Then y*
Sturgis' division of the Ninth corps was af
ordered forward. The charge at Balaklava pt
is famed in history. Moro than twenty W
charges like Balaklava would not have com- to
passed the destruction wrought beforo the d*
stone wall at Fredericksburg, Dec. 13, "iSC2. n(
Six distinct waves of troops assaulted the til
works and fell back. At one moment Lee, Ul
watching the light from Lee's hill, expressed w
apprehension to Longstreet that the position
might be token, so never ending seemed to
be the lines of blue that advanced against it.
Longstreet replied:
"General, if you put every man now on the *
other side of the Potomac on that field to ap- ar
proach mo over the same line, and give mo ;u
plenty of ammunition, I will kill them all bo- in
foce the}' reach my line." su

seeing the uselessness of thus slaughter, begged p(
Burnside to countermand the order, but th
Burnside replied: "The crest must be carried
to-night," and ordered Hooker across jn
with two divisions, Humphreys' and Sykes'. jn
Humphreys is said to have been the ablest .
officer on the field of Fredericksburg. By
the time ho advanced on Marye's hill the
ammunition of the Confederate artillery
upon the heights was exhausted, and thus
one galling fire to which his predecessors 68
had been exposed was stopped. His men HA

The battle of Fredericksburg was fought .,
011 a Saturday. Burnside had 100,000 effective
men in his army, Leo 78,000 in his fortified
heights. The Union loss was about 15,000;
the Confederate, 5,400. On the Confederate W
side Gens. Gregg and T. It. It. Cobb were to
killed; on the Union side, Gens. George SU
Bayard and C. Feger Jackson. Burnside e)
had resolved to cross the Rappahannock ti
again below Fredericksburg. The move- re
ment was to commence Dec. .10. when sud- \y
denly Burnside received an order from Presi- il
dent Lincoln to malce no general movement .
without first informing him of it. White
Burnside had been preparing to cross the Ol
Rappahannock, several of his generals had nl
been to the president and represented to him k(
that they thought Burnside's plans were
ruinous folly. "
So nothing was done till Jan. 20, 1803. U|
Burnside had decided to make another at- in
tempt to cross the Rappahannock, six miles sj
above Fredericksburg. But it seemed that ?.
not only his own officers, but the fates, were
against him. His army had no sooner started m
up the river than a great storm set in. Snow, n<
rain and sleet came dowu all together and
rendered the march impossible. The soldiers
said it seemed as if the bottom had fallen but _ ,
of the roads.
The troops could not go forward. A few
deed reached the river after long delay, ;
dy to find the Confederates ready for them
the crossing.
The expedition was a failure. Officers 1
the Army of the Potomac six>ke of it desively
as the Mud March. Burnside was
sxt relieved from command of the army "at

ck of it. he was one of the most unselfish
ul patriotic of all the Union gein-raN.
PHE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message of President Cleve- 1
?d, read in both houses of Congress
1 Tuesday of last week, is pronounc1
by the press of nil parties to be a i
asterly document, bold and vigor- 1
is in its conception, and fearless in 1
s treatmentof the questions of tariff <
id taxation, to which it is mainly
mfined. A feature of the message
its brevity and the terseness with
hich the President expresses his :
iews. We give below a complete 1
mopsis of the paper.
The President sets out by saying : 1
You are confronted at the threshold <
your legislative duties with a
indition of the national finances 1
hich imperatively demands immeate
and careful consideration. The
nountof money annually exacted
I rough the operations of the present
ws from the industries and necessies
of the people, largely exceed the
im necessary to meet the expenses
' the government. When we conder
that the theory of our instituons
guarantees to every citizen the
II enjoyment of all the fruits of his
dustry and enterprise, with only
ich deduction as may be his share
wards the careful and economical
aintenance of the government
hich protects him, it is plain that 1
ie exaction of more than this is inde- 1
nsible extortion and a culpable beayal
of American fairness and jusre.
This wrong. inflicted upon 1
lose who bear the burden of nationtaxation,
like other wrongs, multi- 1
ies a brood of evil consequences,
lie public treasury, which should
ily exist as a conduit conveying the <
;ople's tribute to its legitimate ob- i
ct of expenditure, becomes a hoard- ;
g place for money needlessly with- ;
awn from trade and the people's
le, thus crippling our national en- i
gy, suspending our country's dedopment
and preventing investent
in productive enterprise. i
This condition of our treasury is not 1
together new, and it has more than <
ice of late been submitted to the i
;ople's representatives in Congress,
ho alone can apply a remedy, and
it the situation still continues with
rgravative incidents more than ever
esaging financial convulsion and
ide spread disaster. It will not do
neglect this situation because its 1
uigers are not now palpably irnmi?nt
and apparent. They exist none
ie less, certainly, and await the
lforeseen and unexpected occasion
hen suddenly they will be precipi- :
ted upon us.
On the 30th day of June, 1885, the
ccess of revenues over public exinditures,
after complying with the
inual requirements of the sinking :
nd excess, was $17,850,735.84. Durgthe
year ending June 30th, 188G,
ich excess amounted io $49,405,545.- '
', and during the year ending June
th, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,7,849.54.
The annual contribution to the
nking fund during the three years
)ove specified amounting in the agegate
to $138,058,320.94, and deleted
from the surplus as stated,
ere made by calling for that pur)se
outstanding 3 per cent, bonds of
ie government. During the six
onths prior to June 30, 1887, the !
irplus revenue fcad grown so large
/ repeated accumulations thatitwas
area the withdrawal of this great (
im of money needed by the people ,
ould so affect the business of the ,
mntry that the sum of $79,864,100
such surplus was applied to the ,
lyment of the principal and inter- !
tof the three percent, bonds still
itstanding, and which were then
lyable at the option of the govern- (
ent. The precarious condition of
lancial affairs among the people
ill .needing relief, immediately afr
the 30th day of June, 1887, the
mainder of the three per cent.
>nds then outstanding, amounting
ith principal arul interest to the
im of $18,877,500, were called in
id applied to the sinking fund conibution,
for the current fiscal year,
^withstanding these operations of
ie Treasury Department.
Representations of distress in busess
circles, not only continued but
icreased, and absolute peril seemed
hand. In these circumstances the
intrihutions to the sinking fund for
ie current fiscal year was at once
mpleted by the expenditure of $27,14,283.55
in the purchase of governent
bonds, not yet due, bearing
ur and four and a half per cent. 1
iterest. the premium paid thereon
/eraging about twenty-four per cent,
r the former and eight per cent,
r the latter. In addition to this
ie interest accruing during the curntyear
upon the outstanding bondI
indebtedness of the government
as to some extent anticipated ana
mk9 selected as depositories of pub2
money were permitted to somehat
increase their deposits. While
ie expendientsthus employed to rease
to the people the money lying
le in the Treasury, served to avert
ie dangers, our surplus reserves have
intinued to accumulate, the excess
rthepresentyear,amountingonthe i
st of Decern ber to $55,208,707.10, and
estimated to reach the sum of $113,10,000
by the 30th of next June, at
hich date it is expected that this
im, added to prior, accumulations,
ill swell the surplus in the treasury 1
i $1-10,000,000. There seems to be
) assurance that, with such a with- :
awal from use of the people's cirilating
medium, our business com- <
unity may not, in the near future, |:
; subjected to the same distress j
hich was quite lately produced from ;
ie same cause, and while the func-!!
ons of our National treasury should I i
i few and simple, and while its best!'
mdition would be reached, I be-!
eve, by its entire disconnection i
ith private business interests, yet, i
hen by a perversion of its purposes, I <
idly holds money uselessly sub- j
acted from the channels of trade, i
lere seems to be reason for the claim i
lat some legitimate means should i
> rlaiiicml K,. fho imvopntinont ro. I 1
ore, in an emergency, without i
aste and extravagance, such money I!
i its place among the people. If1
ich an emergency arises there now j i
cists no clear and undoubted execu- >
ve power of relief. Heretofore the j ]
idemption of three percent, bonds, ! i
hich were payable at the option of <
le government, has offered a means i
r the disbursement of the excess of
ir revenues, but those bonds have 1
1 been retired, and there are no i
)nds outstanding, the payment of ]
hich we have the right to insist i
aon. The contribution to-the sink- 1
ig fund which furnishes the occa- 1
on for the expenditure inthepurmse
of bonds, has been already !
ade for the current year, so there is i
j outlet in that direction. f
It has been suggested that the pres- l
it bonded debt might be refunded i
a less rate of interest, and the dif- 1
ference between the old and new
securities in cash, thus finding use
for the surplus in the treasury. The
success of this plan, it is apparent,
must depend upon the volition of
the holders of the present bonds, and
it is not entirely certain that the
inducement which must be offered
would result in more financial benefit
to the government than the purchase
of bonds, while the latter
proposition would reduce the principal
of the debt by actual payment
instead of extending it. The proposition
to deposit the money held by
the government in bonds throughout
the country for use by the people is,
it seems to me, exceedingly objectionable
in principle as establishing so
dose a relationship between the
government treasury and the business
of the country, and too extensive
a collection of their money, thus
fostering an unnatural reliance in
private business upon public funds.
If this scheme should be adopted it
should only be done as a temporary
expedient to meet an urgent necessity.
Legislative and executive effort
should generally be in the opposite
direction, and should have a tendency
to divorce as much and as fast as can
safely be done the treasury department
from private enterprise.
Of course it is not expected that unnecessary
and extravagant appropriations
will be made for the purpose
of avoiding the accumulating of an
excess of revenues. Such expenditure,
besides the demoralization of all
just conceptions of public duty which
it entails, stimulate a habit of reckless
improvidence not in the least
consistent with the mission of our
people, or the high and beneficent
principles of our government. 1
have deemed it my duty to thus
bring to the knowledge of my countrymen
as well as to the attention
of their representatives charged
with the responsibility of legislative
relief, the gravity of our financial
situation. The failure of theCongress
heretofore to provide against the dangers,
which it was quite evident the
very nature of the difficulty must
have necessarily produced, caused a
condition of financial distress and
apprehension since your last adjournment,
which taxed to the utmost, ail
the authority and expedients within
executive control, and these now
appear to be exhausted.
If disaster results from the continued
inaction of Congress, the responsibility
must rest where it belongs.
Though the situation thus far considered,
is fraught with danger, which
should be fully realized, and though
it presents features, which portend
wrong to the people as well as peril
to the country, it is buta resultgrowi
ng out of a perfectly palpable and apparent
cause, constantly representing
the same alarming circumstances.
Our scheme of taxation by means of
which this needless surplus is takeq
from the people and put into the public
treasury, consists of a tariff or duty
levied upon importations from
abroad and internal revenue taxes
levied upon the consumption of tobacco,
spirits and malt liquors. It
must be conceded that none of the
things subject to internal revenue taxation
are, strictly speaking, necessaries.
There appears to be no j ust eomplaint
of this tariff by the consumers
of these articles, and there seems
to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion
of the people. But our present
tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable
and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation ought to be at once removed
and amended.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve
the country of this taxation.
It must be extensively continued as
a source of the government's income,
and in a readjustment of our tariff the
interests of American labor, engaged
in manufacture, should be carefully
considered, as well as the protection
of our manufactures. It may be
called protection, or by any other
name, but relief from the hardships
and dangers of our present tariff laws
should be devised with reference to
providing againstimperiling the existence
of our manufacturing interests.
The reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to
necessitate, or justify, either the loss
of employment by the workingman,
nor the lessening of his wages, and
the profits still remaining to the
manufacturer after a necessary readjustment
should furnish no excuse for
the sacrifice of the interests of his
employees, either in their opportunity
to work or in the dminution
of their compensation. Nor can the
workers in manufactories fail to understand
that while a high tariff is
claimed to be necessary to allow the
payment of remunerative wages, it
certainly results in a very large increase
in the price of nearly all sorts
of manufactures, which, in almost
countless forms, he needs for the use
of himself and family. He receives at
the desk of his employer his.wages,
and perhaps before he reaches his
home is obliged, in the purchase of
an article for family use, of an article
which embraces his own labor, to return
in the payment of the increase
in price which the tariff permits the
hard earned compensation of many
days of toil.
The farmer and the agriculturist
who manufacture nothing, but who
pay the increased price which the
tariff imposes upon every agricultural
implement, upon all he wears and
upon all he uses and owns, except the
increase of his flocks and herds and
such things as his husbandry produces
from the soil, is invited to aid in
maintaining the government, and he
is told that a high duty on imported
wool is necessary for the benefit of
those who have sheep to shear in
order that the price of their wool
may be increased. They, of course,
are not reminded that the farmer
who has no sheep is by this scheme
obliged, in his purchases of clothing
and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to
his fellow farmer as well as to the
manufacturer and merchant. Nor is
any mention made of the fact that
sheep owners themselves must wear
Nothing and use other articles manufactured
from the wool they sell at
tariff' rates, and thus consumers,
us well, return a share of this in
creased price to the tradesman.
Discussing the increased cost to
the consumer of our home manufactures
resulting from a duty laid upon
i m ported articles of the same descri ption,
the fact is mentioned that competition
among our dealers produces
sometimes the effect of keeping the
price of their products below the
highest limit allowed by such duty.
The considerations that have been
presented touching our tariff laws
\re intended only to enforce an earnest
recommendation that the surplus
revenue of the government be prevented
by the reduction of our customs
duties, and at the same time to
emphasizeasuggestionthatinaccora- J
plishing this purpose we may discharge
a double duty to our people
by granting to them a measure of relief
from tariff taxation in quarters
where it is most needed and from
sources where it can be more fairly
and justly accorded, nor can the presentation,
made of such considerations
bo with any degree of fairness
regarded as evidence of unfriendliness
toward our manufacturers'
interests or of any lack of appreciation
of their value and importance.
These interests constitute a leading
and most substantial element of our
National greatness and furnish the
proud proof of our country's progress.
But if in the emergency that
presses upon us our manufacturers
are asked to surrender something for
thfi nnhlif* confl. and tn avart disas
ter, their patriotism, as well as a
grateful recognition of the advantages
already afforded, should lead
them to willing co-operation. No
demand is made that they shall forego
all the benefits of governmental
regard; but they cannot fail to be admonished
of their duty as well as enlightened
as to their self-interest and
safety, whenjfoey are reminded of
the fact that financial panic and collapse?to
which the present condition
tends?afford no greater shelter
or protection to our manufacturers
than to other important enterprises.
The opportunity for safe, careful
and deliberate reform is now offered
; and none of usshould be unmindful
of a time when an abused and irritated
people, heedless of those who
have resisted timely and reasonable
relief, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification of their wrong.
The difficulty attending a wiseand
fair revision of our tariff laws is not
underestimated. It will require, on
the part of the Congress, great labor
and care, and especially a broad and
national contemplation of thesubject,
and a patriotic disregard of such local
and selfish claims as are unreasable
and reckless of the welfare of
the entire country.
Under our present laws more than
four thousand articles are subject to
duty. Many of these do not in any
way compete with our manufactures,
and many are hardly worth attention
as subjects of revenue. A considerable
reduction can be made in
the aggregate by adding them to the
free list. The taxation of luxuries
presents no feature of hardship, but
necessaries of life, used and consumed
by all the people, the duty on which
adds to the cost of living in every
household, should be greatly cheapened.
The radical reduction of the
duties imposed upon raw material
used in the manufactures, or its free
importation is, of course, an important
factor in any effort to reduce
the price of the necessaries, and would
not only relieve them from the increased
cost caused by the tariff on
such material, but the manufactured
product being thus cheapened, that
part of the tariff now laid upon such
products as compensation to ou r manufacturers
for the present price of
raw material, could be accordingly
modified. Such reductions or free
importations would serve besides to
largely reduce the revenues.
It is not apparent how such a
change can have injurious effect upon
manufactures. On the contrary it
would appear to give them a better
chance in foreign markets with the
manufacturers of other countries who
cheapen their wares by free material.
Thus our people might have the opportunity
of extending their sales
beyond the limits of home consumption,
saving them from the depression,
interruption in business
and loss caused by a glutted domestic
market, and affording employees
more certain and steady laoor and
its resulting quiet and contentment.
The question thus imperatively presented
for solution, should be approached
in a spirit higher than party
anxiety, and considered in the
light of that regard for patriotism
which should characterize the action
of those entrusted with the weal of
a confiding people.
But the obligation to declare a
party policy and principle is not
wanting to urge prompt and effective
action. Both of the great
political parties now represented in
the government have by repeated
and authoritative declarations condemned
the tariff which permits the
collection from the people of unnecessary
revenue, and have in the
most solemn manner promised its
correction, and the deliberate violation
of these pledges will not be
condoned. Our progress toward a
wise conclusion will not be improved
by dwelling on the theories of protection
and free trade. The question
of free trade is absolutely irrelevant,
and the persistent claim
made in certain quarters that all
efforts to relieve the people from
unjust and unnecessary taxation are
schemes of the so-called free traders,
is mischievous and far removed from
any consideration for the public
good. The simple and plain duty
which we owe the people is to reduce
taxation to the necessary expenses
of an economical provision of
the government, and to restore o
the businessof the country the money
which we hold in the treasury
through the power of the government.
This can be done with safety
to all our industries, without danger
to the opportunity for remunerative
labor, which our working men need
and with benefit to them, and all
our people by cheapening their
means of subsistence and increasing
the measure of their comforts.
The constitution provides that the
President "shall, from time to time,
give to the Congress information of
the state of the Union." It has been
the custom of the executive, in compliance
with this provision, to annually
exhibit to the Congress at the
opening of its session the general
condition of the country, and to detail
with some particularity, the operations
of the different executive
departments. It would be.especially
agreeable to follow this course at
thepresenttime,and to call attention
to the valuable accomplishments of .
these departments during the last
fiscal year; but I am so much impressed
with the paramount importance
of the subject to which this
communication has thus far been devoted
that I shall forego the addition
of any other topic, and only urge
upon your immediate consideration
the "state of the Union," as shown
in the present condition of our treasury
and our general fiscal situation,
upon which every element of our
safety and prosperity depends. .
The reports of the heads of departments
which will be submitted, contain
full and explicit information
touching the transactions of the business
entrusted to them, and such recommendations
relating to the legislation
of publicinterest as they deem
advisable. I ask that these reports
and recommendations have the deliberate
examination and action of
both legislative branches of the government.
There are other subjects not included
in the department reports demanding
legislative consideration
and which I should be glad to submit.
Some of them, however, have
been earnestly presented in previous
messages, and it is not necessary to
repeat prior recommendations.
As the law makes no provisions for
any report from the Department of
State, a brief history of the transactions
of that important department,
together with other matters which it
may hereafter be deemed essential to
commend to the attention of Congress,
may furnish the occasion for a
future communication.
Grover Cleveland.
