A CONTINGENCY NOT PROVIDED
FOR.
The death o Horace Greeley suggests
the possibility of a contingency arising
which we believe is not provided for in
the Constitution of the United States.
Let us suppose that Greeley and Brcwn
bad been elected to the Presideacy and
Vice Presidency of the nation. Greeley
dies; who would be inaugurated as
President on the 4th of March neit?
The Constitution is perfectly plain on
the proposition that in case of the death
of the President the Vice President shall
succeed him, but this clause seems to
relate more particularly to that period
when both shall have been regularly in
stalled in office. Vt'e are not quite posi
tive about it, but our recollection is that
the Constitution is wholly silent on the
question under notice prior to the inaug
uration of the President elect. It is the
most natural thing in the world to con
clutle that had Greeley and Brown been
successful the latter would now be
entitled to the Presidential chair, but
the point we make is that the Constitu
tion does not provide for such a contin
gency. Arguing from the same premises
there would also bs a question as to
who would be Vice President. Eureka
Sentinel.
The "contingency not provided for"
is not owing to any omission in the Fed
eral Constitution. That instrument pro
vides for the choosing of Presidential
Electors by the States, and pursuant to
this provision the States of the I "nion
chose Electors on the 5th of last month.
These Electors are required by law to
meet in the respective State Capitals to
morrow and to vote for one person as
President and auotheras Vice 1 resident.
There is no lawful restriction placed
upon the action of the Electors, except
that one of the persons voted for ahall
not be a citizen of the State of which the
Elector is a citizen. For the last forty
years party nominations have been made
and the Electors chosen are bound by a
high moral obligation to reflect the will
of the party by which they were chosen
and vote for the nominees of that party
for President and Vice President. The
death of Mr. Greeley leaves the Electors
chosen in the States of Maryland, Miss
ouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and
perhaps one or two others, without any
thing to control their action in voting
for President except such counsel as
they may gee fit to accept from the lead'
era of their party and the rank and file
of those whose political sentiments they
reflect, but they are under a moral oh
ligation to vote for B. Gratz Brown as
Vice President. Should the candidate
of the successful party (Grant) be re
moved by death at any time between the
day of choosing Erectors and the day on
which the Electors are required to east
their votes, then they would as far as
possible ascertain the wishes of the
party and the people and vote accord
ingly. v noever snouia receive a major
ity would be declared elected. But
after to-morrow, when the Electors will
meet and choose Grant for President,
if he should die before the 1th of March,
Mr. Wilson, who will to-morrow be
chosen Vice President, would after the
4th of March act as President until
other election. '
CONGRESS.
The second session of the 4'2d Congress
met yesterday, and President Grant's
fourth annual message was handed in
We have not even a synopsis of the
message as yet; but expect to receive it
to-day, and will publish it to-morrow.
The present session expires by limita
tion on the 3d of March. The Senate
will be called together March 4th in ex
tra session to act upon any nominations
the President may choose to make; but
the House will stand adjourned until
December next, unless in the meantime
the present Congress passes an act for
the organization of the new Congress on
4th of March.
The Attorney-General of the United
States has presented a report to the
President, regarding the application of a
man named Barney Woods, who is now
under sentence of death for a commuta
tion of his punishment. The Attorney
General sayt that for the protection of
Hociety it has become necessary to show
that the , death penalty should follow
quickly and certainly upon the commis
sion of the crime of murder. He thinks
that there ig nothing to in this case to
justify the remission of the sentence by
the Court. . , '

SPKlIAI, TO THE PIOCHE DAILY BXCOBD
PACIFIC COAST.
Salt Lake City, Pec. 2. The richest
ledge of silver and galena ore known to
exist in this country, was striu k in the
Trinity mine, at Galena, near this place,
yesterday. The mine is the property of
Messrs. Blossom i Thomas Thompson,
of this place.
Salk Lake, Dec. 2. A veil known dia
mond broker of this cily, named Wiel, is
aaid to be the party who, with Harpen
ding, of San Francisco, aud Arnold, put
up the diamond swindle; and efforts are
making here by legal process to bring
the guilty parties to justice. Juuiu is
generally condemned. The victims in
Salt L ike lose over $100,000.
Indications favor a mild winter. Snow
at the greattst nltitude is not over ten
inches deep. The roads (wagon and
rail) are all open. The Union and Cen
tral Pacific trains are running regularly,
and generally on time.
Several rich strikes in the mines of
Little Cottonwood are reported.
The President's message is exciting
universal attention.
San Francisco, Dec. 2. The funds of
the City Treasury are exhausted, owing
to the slowness with which taxes are be
ing paid. Wan-ants will be issued to-day
to the Municipal Officers nud School
Teachers, and in a few days they will be
able to draw their mouoy.
One of the counsel for the Diamond
Fraud Committee of Investigation states,
that they are making rapid and satisfac
tory progress in the investigation, and
that the persons implicated iu the swin
dle ara in in this country, aud within
rea:h of our own courts.
Conflicting stories about the epizootic
in this city are afloat. The best opinion
is that thtre are no genuine cases of the
disease here. Horses are sick, but with
such disorders as are common at this
season.
The Ajax arrived to-day from Hono
lulu, with dates from Australia. There
were 23 sharp shocks of earthquake in
the Colonies on the 18th of October, but
no damage was done. The Free Educa
tional bill is likely to pass the Colonial
Parliament. The Prince of Saxe-Coburg
was at Sydney, and would soon leave for
China. On the passage down, Balph
Phelp was injured by a block. He died,
and was buried at Honolulu. He was a
passenger from this city.

Yankee Jim's, Cal., Dec. 2. A daring
robbery was committed here last night.
M. B. Tubbs closed his saloon' at mid
night, put the keys in his pocket, and
went to bed. The thieves entered the
back Toom, took the safe keys, and ob
tained $180 in coin, but left one gold
note, some greenbacks, and a check for
$100. No clue to the robbers.
Vallejo, Dec. 2. The District Court of
Solano county commenced this morning
at Fairfield. The Valencia Brothers'
murder case will be one of the first tried,
Sixty jurymen have been summoned for
this case.
Battle Mountain, New, Dec. 2. This
place was the scene of a cowardly assault
laBt evening. A blacksmith's helper,
named John Sullivan, had a dispute with
another blacksmith named William Chap
man, and blows ensued. They were sep
arated by the bystanders, when Sullivan
immediately went for a butcher's knife,
and returning, met Chapman and delib
erately stabbed him to the heart, killing
him almost instantly. Sullivan is now
under arrest, awaiting examination. The
people are so excited that it will be al,
most impossible for the officers to pre
vent them from lynching the prisoner.
Chapman leaves a wife and two children.
San Francisco, Dec. 2. E. M. Lee,
indicted for attempting to influence in an
illegal manner a juror in tho Brotherton
case, has been delivered into custody by

New York, Dec. 1, 1872. Follftwing is
a copy of the last letter from Horace
Greeley to Charles Lanman, of this city
New York, June 27.
To Friknu Lanman: I received yours
of the 25th inst. I have all mv life been
doing what people called vastly foolish,
impolitic acts, and I did not dispute their
judgment, i only said tnat which seem
ed to me the right thing. If I should
die before election, or be beaten therein,
E lease testify for me that I do not regret
aving braved public opinion when I
thought it wrong and knew it to be mer
cilesH. Horace Greeley

The President has written a letter in
complimentary terma accepting the re
signation of Gen. Horace Porter.
Baltimore, Dec. 1. The Maryland
Electors, chosen at the lint election, meet
to-morrow night to decide how the Totes
shall be east, in consequence of the death
of Greeley. The importance attached to
the vote seems to be the bearing it may
have on the nomination four years hence,
Now York, Dec. 1.-.A St. John'i (N.
B.) dispatch gives an account of the vio
lent storm there on Fviday night. Yes
terday it was doing great damage to the
shipping iu the harbor and wrecking a
number of vessels outside, with consider
able loss of life. In the city several
houses were blown down, and a portion
the new edifice, nearly completed, for the
Young Meu's Christian Association fell.
Three groceries were crushed; several
dwellings were blown over and barns de
molished. Fears are entertained for the
fleet which left port the other morning.
The remains of Greeley were brought
to this city from Pleasantville on Satur
day evening, and are now at the residence
of Thomas SincUir. The two daughters
of Greeley and Mrs. Gibbons accom
panied the remains to this city.
The Herald mentions that the Union
League have hopes that President Graut

his late distinguished rival in the politi
cal field.
The office of Surveyorof the Port, now
vacant, will be filled under the civil ser
vice rules.
Eight hundred men were discharged

Philadelphia, Dec. 1. Officers of the
Mexican National Railway received a tel
egram from the City of Mexico, dated
Nov. 27, saying the Mexican Congress
passed, that day, by a majority of 06, a
bill authorizing President Lerdo to ar
range with Gen. Kosecranz the modifica
tions desired to thoir existing concession,
leaving the latter in full power. The
Company ask for subsidy in national
bonds, in lieu of the land grant given
them iu December, 1870.
New York, Dec. 1. The Trustees of
the Tribune, at a meeting on Saturday,
appointed a committee, consisting of Sin
clair, Keid and Cleaveland, to take entire
charge of the arrangements for Greeley's
funeral. Tbey have fixed it for Wednes

was found dead this morning, from in
juries received in a scuffle with fireman
McCaully.
New York, Dec. 2. In New York and
Brooklyn, yesterday, the leading divines,
with few exceptions, took occasion to ad
dress thoir congregations on the subject
of Greeley's death. Despite the unfavor
able weather, the churches were thronged
everywhere, and high tributes were paid
to the virtues and good qualities of the
deceased.
The Sun announces that Mr. Greeley's
body will be in state in the City Hall to
day and to-morrow, and pall-bearers will
be selected to-day. The body will be de,
posited in the family vault at Green,
wood. The attaches of the Tribune yes
terday passed appropriate resolutions on
the death of their chief. The sale an
nounced at Chappaqua on Saturday was
simply a sale of superfluous farming im
plements, and had been determined upon
by Mr. Greeley at the time of his wife's
death. The sale was postponed on ac
count of his death. Senator Schurz, who
passed through tho city on his way to
Washington, last evening, expressed re
gret at his inability to attend the funeral
Minister Washburn has arrived here
The schooner Multcr, from Philadel
phia, sunk yesterday, in a squall off
Sandy Hook. One of the seamen was
drowned. Of the remaining four men
who clung to the rigging until rescued in
an almost lifeless state, one person, the
steward, was frozen to death.
The World says the Electoral vote in
tended for Greeley cannot be cast for
another, but must be cast for blank.
The Times says the reckless storage of
immense quantities of inflammable oils
in the lower part of the city, is the sub
ject which the authorities should at once
consider, as from the present aspect of
the situation it is one of great danger,
Chicago, December 2. A Washington
special gives the main points of the
President's message as follows: It will
not favor very much more reduction of
taxation, as the needs of the Treasury
for expenses, interest on bonds and pay
me nt of the debt, will equal the present
revenue. Liberal appropriations are re
commended to continue improvements
in Washington. The Cuban troubles
are commented on at considerable length
and deplored. No mention is made of
Commissioner Douglass' plan for re
ducing the force in the Internal Revenue
Department, by merging the offices of
Assessor and Collector into one; and no
approval is expressed of the postal tele
graph recommendation of the Postmas
ter General. Considerable space ig de
voted to the condition of affairs on the j
Mexican border: and the attention of
Congress is called to it,
The matter is much discussed among
papers as to the proper course for the
Greeley and Brown Electors to pursue in
view of Greeley's death. Quite a num
ber of Democratic papers urge the view
that as they cannot cast their votes for
the deceased, they are at liberty and
should cost their votes for some repre
sentative Democrat, and Hendricks of
Indiana is mentioned by a number of
papers in this connection. Others, in
cluding some southern papers and the
Cincinnati Commercial, favor casting the
vote for Grant as a graceful acquiescence
in the decision of the majority of the
voters, while still others, including the
Cincinnati Enquirer, believe the Electors
have no discretion in the mutter, but
having been elected solely to perform a
specific duty, must perform that duty
by casting the vote for Greeley and
Brown. The Tribune of this city argues
that in accordance with the spirit of the
Constitution the Electors should vote for
Brown, who, iu case of Greeley's elec
tion and death before inauguration would
be constitutional President.

Paris, Dec. 1 The resignation of M.
Lefranc, Minister of the Interior, was

result of the debate in the Assembly was
declared, and has been accepted by the
President. A Cabinet Council was held
to-day, which lasted three hours. All
the ministers have offered their resigna
tion, but up to the present time Thiers
refuses to accept them. The President
is much affected by the last vote of the
Assembly, and says the Only course left
for him is to resign. Nothing hag yet
been settled, aud the situation is one of
the gravest. Paris is uneasy, but the
monarchists are firm and confident.
