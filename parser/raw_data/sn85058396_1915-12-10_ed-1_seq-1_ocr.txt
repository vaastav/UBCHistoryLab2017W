EStm Review of War Situation.

CfMi Bulgarians, heavily reiuforced and
ni well supported by artillery, are renew
Jaif ing violently their attack upon the
M& Franco-British 'forces in Macedonia.
iSIt Their assault has gone through all the
m 2 preliminary stages and is now ap
1 proaching the climax of intensity
i Although pursuit of the Serbians
oSk still continues, it is apparent from the
ifli proportions which the Macedonian
M $ conflict is assuming that the major
4P part of the Bulgarian army has divert
jjnji jT ed its attention to the allies. The
nri I' outcome of the battle now in progress
, ifii( 1 is awaited with great anxiety in Eng
r,ttf 'and, as it will determine in great
m ''4 measure the immediate future of the
J2? f allies in the Balkans.
$M Grave Situation of Allies.
M i The numerical superiority of the
J7 $ Bulgarian forces already has been
iff f demonstrated in the initial encoun
.1 ? ters with the British. Grave doubts
;S are voiced hero as to liability of the
v British .forces to repel the increasing
fl ? momentum of the Bulgarian attack.
1 1 & There is no indication, however, that
Iff the British or French have yet found
V)l I lt necessary to withdraw further than
3 ? the positions mentioned in recent of
j ficial communications. "With the Bui
's Karians in their positions at Demir

GERMANY WILL
CONCEDE NOTHING
Desires Peace But Will Not
Consider Terms Involving
Retrocession of Alsace
Lorraine. STANDS FOR MILITARISM
People Will Never Willingly
Give Up a Foot of German
Territory.
Berlin, Dec. 9, via London,. Dec 10,
5 a, m. (Delayed.) Deputy Otto
Landsberg, a Socialist Democrat, In
his speech in the Reichstag today af
ter the imperial chancellor had an
swered the Socialistic interpellation
on peace, expressed approval of the
chancellor's address as a reasonable
invitation to the entente allies to in
itiate peace negotiations in which
Germany was willing to join.
Ilerr Landsberg declared that the
Socialist afopeal for peace was based
on no anxiety about the outcome of
the war. He said he shared Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg's opinion that
the war has been forced upon Ger
many and that guarantees were nec
essary to prevent a repetition. No
true German, ho asserted, was desir
ous of ending the war on any other
terms. He repeated the declaration
made earlier In the day by Dr. Phillip
Scheldemann, Socialist, that the So
cialists never would consider a peace
Involving the retrocession of Alsace
Lorraine. Deputy Landsberg said that, with

Premier Briand of France, both make

many, lie could understand the chan
cellor's attitude In his speech and was
pleased that Dr. von Bethmann-Holl-weg
in return had not demanded th
destruction of Russian and French
militarism or British "marinism,"
which could render peace- impossible.
Regarding tlift.aaqrJsLtion of territory,
the deputy ex'pressed high satisfac
tlon that the chancellor had made no
mention of annexation
Deputy Landsberg said that the
chancellor had demanded securities
against repetition of wanton attacks.
The Socialists, loo. wished to preserve
future generations from the battle
fields and trenches, continued the
speaker, but there was no security
against future wars in conducting this
war to the exhaustion or subjugation
of another nation.
Will Never Surrender Any Territory.
If Germany's opponents did not de
sire peace because they insisted upon
the destruction of Germany's defen
sive force and the annexation of Ger
man territory, said Deputy Lands
berg, they must learn that the Social
ist appeal for peace was based on no
anxiety about the outcome of the
war. He declared that nothing could
increase the courage and resolution of
the German troops more than the con
sciousness that the responsibility for
a further continuance of the war rest
ed with their opponents.

SEN. HOI SMITH
ENTEIS PROTEST
Urges Congress to Insist on
Non-interference of British
With Neutral Commerce.
j WOULD ENFORCE RIGHTS
Great Britain Should Not Be
Permitted to Continue Acts
of Lawlessness.
Washington, Dec. 10. Senator
Hoke Smith of Georgia, in an address
in the senate today, called upon con
gress to insist that Great Britain
cease interference with neutral com
merce. He declared that protests by
the American slato department had
bten met by increased lawlessness
ano trampling upon neutral rights.
"The United States, with other na
tions, should demand from Great
Britain," the senator said, "that dis
regard of their rights cease. It may
be necessary for the United States
and other neutrals to let Great Britain
understand that 'no word or act' will
be omitted to enforce their rights."
British merchants and shippers are
piofiting greatly, he asserted, by ex
porting the very character of goods
seized when shipped fiom the United
States to other neutral European
ports, Senator Smith denied that
Gieat'Britain could be excused on the
ground that the United States had
acted Illegally and Improperly and in
a similar way in tho civil war. Re
marking that the relations between
the United States and Great Britain
had been growing closer for a hun
dred years, tho senator added:
"But we are not a dependency of
Great Britain."
Germany too, ho said, always had
been a friend of the United States
and many American citizens love that
country second only to their own.

GARRISON IS FOR
BIGMOBILEARMY
Continental United States
Needs 1,500,000 Fully or
Partially Trained Men.
SPECIFIC REPORT
Annual Expense of $20,000,
000 for Four Years Neces
sary to Maintain Harbor
Defenses.
Washington. Dec. 10. Secretary
Garrison made public today in con
nection with his annual note the spe
cial national defense report prepared
at his request by the war college divi
sion of the general staff. It showed
that the army itself considers that to
secure the continental United States
from atack it is necessary to have a
mobile army of 1,500,000 fully or par
tially trained men. It made tho fol
lowing specific recommendations:
Regular Army.
With the colors, 121,000.
Reserves at end of eight year en
listment period, 379,000.
Total, 500,000.
Continental Army.
Under training three months a year
for each of three years, 500,000.
On furlough subject to three
mouths additional training before tak
ing the field. 500.000
Organized Militia.
No provision beyond annual appro
priation of $7,000,000 and repeal of
all acts requiring state soldiers to bes
received into United States service In
advance of any other force in time of
war.
In estimating the cost of this es
tablishment, the report figured as fol
lows for the first year
Regular army, S25S.960T000. ,
frTitiTirTitnli 5R7 KOOOftO S.
Militia, $7,000,000.
Total, $353,400,000.
Heavy Annual Expense.
According to these figures, Secre-
I tary Garrison points out, an annual
i expense of $20,000,000 for each of four
.years would be necessary for harbor
defenses and reserve material would
ccst for the first year alone $129,-
7G8,786, making the grand total for the
first year $503,288,736.
It was the cost of war college
plansVliicli led Secretary Garrison to
devise the modified plan which has
been presented to congress with the
backing of the administration. The
annual upkeep cost of the war college
plan, were the system in full opera
tion, is estimated at $319,473,000 as
against $182,234,559 for the adminis
tration plan.
The Monroe Doctrine.
"Our abiding national policies." the
board found to be the Monroe doctrine
and the avoiding of "entangling alli
ances." To maintain these, it says a
co-crdinated policy of land and sea
defense must be evolved.
Strength of Foreign Powers.
The report contained a military ta
ble of the strength of the seven lead
ing foreign powers as of August 1.
1914. and also an estimate of Hie
available shipping for a military ex
pedition to the United States. It said
"a reasonable estimate" shows that
Austria-Hungary could send 180,000
men with all necessary stores and
animals across the seas within 40 7
days in two expeditions; France 404,
225 in thirtv days, Germany, 827,000
in 30.8 davs; Great Britain. 170,000 in
"7 davs; ' Italy, 227,000 in 35 days;
Japan," 23S.3C7 in 41 days and Russia,
101,074 in 40 days.
Must Be Prepared.
The report continued: "We must be
prepared to resist a comblucd land
and sea operation ot formidable
strength. Our principal coast cities
and important harbors have already
been protected by harbor defenses
which, by passive method alone, can
deny to an enemy the use of these lo
calities as bases for such expeditions.
"The enemy being unable to gain a
foothold in any of these fortified
aieas bv direct naval attack, will
therefore be forced to find some suit
able place on the coast from which
land operations can be conducted
both against the important coast cities
and the rich commercial "centers in
the interior. Long stretches of coast
line lie open to the enemy. The only
reasonable way in which these locali
ties can be defended is by providing a
strong mobile land force."
Mobile Force With Colors.
The report recommended a mobile
force of 121,000 men with the colors
in continental United States, 27.000
censt artillery with reserves to bring
the corps up to 60.000; one reinforced
dhlsion'in tho Philippines; one divi
sion in tho Hawaiian Islands and one
in Panama.
Holding the, Philippines, the report
saia, is a national policy, not a mili
tary one. but it must be remembered
that unless tho navy controls the
sea, no additional troops can be sent
there at need. The defense of the
Pearl harbor naval base can be ac
complished properly, the report con
tinues, only by adding a mobile force
to the garrison to meet attempts at
landing and similar situations exist in
the Panama canal zone, the Guantana
mo naval station, Porto Rico and
Alaska. ...... '
Forces Must Be Maintained. ;
The report said that because of (
geographical conditions mobile forces (
must be maintained In each of tho
Puget Sound California, Atlantic and
middle west' areas. The first three (
are described as the "critical areas, j
Puget Sound should have, it was said, ,
one division of troops, less the divi
sional cavalry, a brigade of cavalry;
California and the North Atlantic
states one division and a brigade of
cavalrv each; the middle west a dl-
vision," less its cavalry, and a brigade
of cavalry. Two brigades of cavalrj j
would be assigned to tho Mexican
border.
Under this distribution there would
be 82,000 regulnrs of all arms on over
seas service and 18,000 in the United
States. Adding non-combatant forces
necessary, a grand total of 281,000 Is
reached for the standing army.

ceived In military quarters here, the
Anglo-French expedition in the Bal
kan's has continued its retreat and
has now entirely evacuated Serbian
territory. i
London, Dec. 10, 2:44 p. m. What
seems to be an intimation that the
troops of the entente allies contem
plate evacuating Serbian territory, if
they have not already done so, Is con
tained in a statement declared. In a
Reuter dispatch from Saloniki, to
have been issued by the French gen
eral staff on the' Balkan front.
The statement quoted by the Sa
loniki correspondent is as follows:
"We, the French and British, are re
tiring for reasons easy to understand.
In view of the fact that the Serbian
army for tho moment is out of the
reckoning, our presence in Serbian
territory is no longer necessary. Bul
garian successes amount to an occu
pation of territory no longer disputed
by us. They have invariably suf
fered checks each time the allied
troops assumed the offensive, notwith
standing their numerically superior
forces."

San Juan, Porto Rico, Dec. 10.- LI
Four blank shots and two solid shots ,H
were fired by tho French cruiser Des- H
cartes in holding the American, steam- IH
ship Coamo yesterday. fl
A French lieutenant, who boarded :'H
the Coamo, said orders have been giv- H
en to take all subjects or Germany H
and her allies from ships crews, be- ftfl
ginning December 8, and to take ail iH
such persons from among the passen-
gers after December 18. )
After tho six shots- had been fired jH
and the Coamo had been stopped, a 4H
small boat put out from the cruiser :H
with the lieutenant and his men. On H
boarding the Coamo. tho lieutenant H
demanded that Captain Barboun pro- jH
duce lists of the passengers and crew. IH
The passengers were alarmed and
ran from the state rooms in their H
nightclothes. Captain Barbour asked
why the Descartes had not waited un- -H
til morning to stop the Coamo so as 'H
to avoid alarming the passengers. The H
lieutenant replied he feared that the H
steamship would have reached port H
The captain protested against the ac- iH
tion of the lieutenant in taking off '(
the four German firemen, saying his .'H
vessel had never been boarded before. c
The lieutenant then informed him of H
the orders he said had been Issued H
The German firemen were paid oft JH
before being taken from the Caomo &
and the passengers gathered on tho I'l

The American steamship Carolina I.H

Washington, Dec. 10. The state de- II
partment today still was without offi- K
cial report-of the action of the French K
cruiser Descartes in holding up the
American steamships Coamo and Car- I
olina. It was said that if the Coamo l
was fired upon, tho gravity of tho i
situation was materially increased. In- ,H
quiries for details have been dispatch- H
ed to Europe and to Porto Rico. H
The action of holding up the Coamo JH
is contrary to the principles for which H
the United States has contended and, 'H

will become the subject of diplomatic !'H
