. DIRECTIONS FOR JUDGING.
Wf (Note. In the use of any score card if an ear is only (lightly deficient
it may be cut a traction of the total cut allowed as K, X or X as the case
requires )
Uniformity op Exbihit. The ears of an exhibit should be similar in
size, shape, color and indentation. For each ear defective in these respects
the exhibit should be cut not to exceed onejpoint.
Maturity and Market Conditions. Ears should be firm and the ker
pels free from mould or injury. The firmness of the ear is best determined
by twisting In the hand or by moving kernels with the thumb. Cut not to
exceed 1 points for each er that is defective.
Shape of Ear. The shape of ear should be as nearly cylindrical as
possible, as such ears usually bear more corn and a less number of gral ns
which are not uniform In sizi or shape. Cut the exhibit hot to exceed on e
point for each tapering ear.
Color, (a) Kernels. Kernels should be uniform in color, thatie, they
should be of the same shade and there should be no white caps in yellow
samples or yellowish caps la white samples. Cut 1-10 point for each kerne 1
that is off color. If five or more kernels show this character the ear will o f
course, be cut the full limit, point, (b) Cob. The cobs should ail be of
one color. For most varieties red cobs in yellow samples and white cob s
in white samples are required. Cut one point for each cob that Is off co lor
up to three which will disqualify the exhibit. A variation In the color of
the cob is an indication of very poor selection and carelsss breeding.
Butts. The butts should be well rounded out with deep regular kernels ,
solidly compacted together around a clean cup shaped cavity Attach
ment of the ear with the stalk should be about of an Inch in ulameter for
medium sited varieties. Cut not to exceed one point for each cob showing
marked defects in these respects.
Tips. There should be deep kernels well out to the end of the ear in as
regular rows as possible. The ideal tip if completely covered but as this
is largely a seasonal characteristic too much stress must not be laid on
this point. Cut not to exceed one half point for tips seriously defective.
Shape of Kern el. The kernels should be uulform in size and shape.
They should be slightly wedge shaped with straight edges so as to fl tigh t
ly together but should not be pointed. The length should be a little over
once and a half as long as the width. They should carry a uniform thick
ness from end to end and should possess germs of good eh. Remove three
kernels from near the mi Idle of each ear for comparison. Cut the exhibit
not to exceed one point for each ear showing kernels of poor shupe.
Proportion of Circumference to Length. The proportion of tircum
ference to bngfch should b as three to four or the clreuuifi-reuco should be
the length. An ear 10 iuehes lonir should b9 7 inches around on third
the distance fro o bint to" tip. Cut not to exceed one point for each ,ear
markedly defective in this proportion.
' Space between Kernels. Furrows between the rows should be nar
row aud tlw kerauia should fil tightly together In the row. Cut not to tx
ceed onediaif point f.r t"i'h fa? taut in seriously Mtiw.
Proportion of Cons to ear: The proportion of corn to ear should
not ba less than 83 percent. The pjr cent is best determined by shilling
every other ear ot the exhibit and weighing. It may be done with a fair de
gree of accuracy by shelling two representative ears. Cut 1 point? for
each per cent balow this Unlit. (It is suggested that at local corn shows it
might be possible to enter 12 or 15 ears, allowing th extra ones to be
weighed and shelled for making this determination. This will allow the
ten remaining ears to be again exhibited at the State corn show )
A Pastor Praises Folk.
New York Dec. 4 -The Rev. Dr.
Robert Stuart McArthur, pastor, of
the Calvary Baptist church, in a ser

out political rings ' In the course of
his remarks the Rev. Mr. McArthur
said:
"Mayor Weaver deserves double
credit, for he opened his own political
Dartv. Weaver has been unjustly
criticised, but he struck terrific blows
for the good. '
"Despite the revelations in life in
surance, I have no hesitancy In say
ing that business honesty Is looking
no. and that there are no people on

fal tor as the American people."
