nuis of Salisbury to Secretary Olney on
the Venezuelan question, the Associa
ted Press learns, was dispatched di
rect to "Washington by mail and should
be received by the British embassa
dor there. Sir Julian Pauncefote, in all
probability tomorrow.
A representative of the Associated
Press showed President Cleveland's
message fto congress to the United
States ambassador here, Hon, Thomas
P. Bayard, shortly after it was deliv
ered to congress. Mr. Bayard read it
r.ith much interest and said:
"I have nothing- to say now, except
that it is a most impressive utterance
and characteristic of the able straight
forward man who made it."
MIXES BLAINE'S NAME.
The newspapers here tomorrow will
eery generally contain editorial com
ments upon President Cleveland's mes
sage to congress.
The Graphic says: "The crudities
and indiscretions of President Cleve
land's present pronnunciamento on for
eign affairs might have been solved
by the late Mr. Blaine in his worst
mood. Can anything be more absurd
than the proposal that the Schomber?
line On Venezuela), should be submit
ted to arbitration. The reference to
Cuba is infinitely more injudicious. It
Is virtually an expression of sympathy
with filibustering."
"MARKING TIME."
The Times editorially says; "Presi
lnt Cleveland has drawn a starting
p'oture of the difficulties created by the
rifious currency system, and we should
be greatly surprised if the plans he
"uggreted are not warmly welcomed
by the business men throughout the
tales. But, flushed 'by electoral vic-
-ries, it Is probable enough that the
Republicans will refuse to allow any
thing to be done in the direction indi
ated. Meanwhile the remainder of
the message, especially the references
to foreign relations will give the im
pression that he is marking time. No
thing he says commits him to a new
,,,- , VL lure,f poucy. wmisi it
Hi ta-sk the Ingenuity of his opponents
to make tha.f he has any way compro- '
m-sed the dignity or been careless of
the interests of his own country."
"HE KNOWS BETTER."
The Daily News, the Liberal organ,
will say: "President Cleveland knows
letter than to treat the Monroe doct
rine as If It were a rule of international
law. it is neitner nirrnlnod nor nnlit- '
fc for the administration at "Washing-
ton to take up the quarrels of South '
American communities which do not
r-serve Usages Of Civilized nations.
Americans will find some day that this j
mrt of patronage involves a correspon
f. rT responsibility, and they will not
like that at all."
AN ALL-OVER ROAST.
The Standard. Conservative organ.
r-v;: "We cannot but regret the tone
f f President Cleveland's r forences to
Vi nozurta. If we may judge of the
tone and substance of Mr. Olney's dis
patch from the paraphrase thus Impart
ed tocongress.weare not surprised that
no answer has been received, and we
further undertake to predict that when
tht reply reaches the "White House it
w'H furnish the president with a deal
of matter for serious reflection. We
must be pardoned if we venture to say
that the whole passage referring to
Venezuela is tipsue of unreal as
sumptions and unsupported deduct
ions. If the Americans desire to carry
out the views thus expressed, they will
do so after due calculation of the cost.
Fven if we were eager for arbitration
the experience in the Berincr sea con
troversy would hardly encourage i.
It Is not easy to argue calmly the mer

'flings of popular agitators. These j
things are incidents of evn prpsiien- '

ONE FOR ARBITRATION
An editorial in the Chronicle says: '
"It is very doubtful if congress will ac
cept Prudent Cleveland's currency
plan. The mesge sounds cautious,
but there is a. welcome note in the di
rection of free trade. Tr reference
to Armenia must be regarded as the
definite adherence of the United States
to European concert. Few honest crit
ics can say anything against President
Cleveland's reference to Venezuela.
We agre with him that the boundary
dispute is eminently suited to arbitra
tion, and undoubtedly our government
will take the same view. It must be
remembered that this question is quite
distinct from that of the reparation
due us by Venezuela for injuries. When
such reparation is made, every L'beral
in this country will acquiesccin Prel- ,
d-nt Cleveland's doctrine. Our lmr.d?
nre full enough without increa--lnsr our
burdens ln America, but especially at '
the risk of creating a serious train be- '
tween ourselxes and the one great pow- ,
or whose friendship is mnr valuable
lv use than of all the others put to
F ther."
The Chronicle conclude its editorial
Vv asking whether America is ready
t-i undertake the responsibility thus in
cuTed for the faithful dischnrcre of

Atlanta, Ga., Dec 3. Cold as was the
weather tonight, the welcome extended
to Secretary Smith of the Interior De
partment on his appearance before the
general assembly to discuss the finan
cial question was the warmest. Stand
ing room only was available in the hall
of the house of representatives, where (
both branches of the legislature sat !
and loud and lengthy applause made
frequent interruptions in his remarks.
The secretary had been Invited to dis- ere Major P. P. Johnston of Lexins
cuss "the issues of the day," but like i ton, Ky., President C. D. Palmer, Low-ex-Speaker
Crisp, who spoke before the ! ell, Mas3.; David Blther of New York,
same hody two weeks aero, he confined ! Colonel "William Edwards of Cleveland
hlmseTC to the money question, taking
strong ground against the free and un
limited coinage of silver and defending
the course of the administration in the
financial matters.
Mt. Smith gave a running review of
the history of currency in this country.
?e was not against silver. He wanted
just as many sold and silver or paper j
dollars circulated in this country as
could be kept as good as every other j
dollar. He endorsed the bimetallic
of arXon. XrS
but he did not acre with the bimetal -
Salfa
ed elaborately to show that the free and
unlimited coinage of both gold and sil
ver would at the present ratio result in
the establishment of the silver stand
ard and the disappearance of all our
gold. The tide of population and of
capital was not setting towards the

Others, had OCCQSlOn to dread a. reVOlU-
lion. Free coinage would benefit no one
and work vast hardships to all, espec
ially to the cottton planters of the south
who would have to collect their pro
duots at a gold standard price and buy
their goods at an inflated silver stand
ard valuation. j
The most significant part of Secre
tary Smith's address was his reference
to state banks. The repeal of the ten
per cent tax on their circulation would,
he believed, be the one remedy for our
financial Ills. He took pleasure In tell- j
ing his auditors that of a great number
of great lawyers in the national capital
, with whom he was associated all were
agreed that the prohibitory tax was un
constitutional. I
President Cleveland and Secretary
Carlisle had both recommended Its re
peal to the last congress and their re
commendations would have been re- '
uewed, but it would have been useless
to appeal to the present congress for j
such action. j
The secretary closed by announcing
his assurance that ithe next national
convention would take advanced ground
sainst free coinage and counseled nar-
mony "wJtmn tne partj, so tnat alter

of the entries and in the arrangement

Tvere filled with society people from
all over the Pacific coast and the gener
al attendance crowded the promenade
and occupied all the seats provided.
The reception of animals for the big
show began yesterday afternoon and it
was not long until all the best known 1
owners ana Dreeuers or line norses in ,
the country were represented. Al- '
though the entries are for the most part

The board of review at its last ses
sion dclded the case in favor of Pet
tie. Last May the Queen's county so
ciety decided that the money had been
wrongly paid and that Queen Bess
should have been distanced. Edward
H. Payne, who brought the case before
the board decided to allow the case to
be opened. Much testimony was tak
en tonight. Pettie was represented
by Judge H. M. Whiteside, who conten
ded that the case should not have been
reopened.
John Kervick of "Worcester, Mass.,
a driver, appeared and asked for a re
lease from suspension of himself and
the bay gelding, "Cycle." made at Ha
verhill, Mass., November 1, last. It
was charged that he enterd the horse
in the Haverhill races and refused to
pay the entrance fee. Mr. Kervick
told the board that he did not enter
the horse but that the secretary told
, Wm that he would put his name down
ln two cias5es -which, if he -lrove, he
uia pay for. The horse did not go
to Haverhill. The owner of the horse
told the board that he never gave au
thority for the horse to be entered at
Haverhill and his strict orders were
that the horse should not be entered
without his consent.
Dr. John B. McClosey, of Lancaster,
Pa., appeared and asked to have his
case of suspension in 1S92 reopened.
He was a judge at the meeting and it
was alleged that he permitted a "ring
er" to go in a special race. The board
voted to hear his story, which he told.
It was that there was nothing of the
kind, both horses being entered and on
ly one starting. No decisions were
reached.

SUGAR SHADOWS IT

action at the Close.
New York, Dec 3. The transactions
In Sugar stock overshadowed the entire
market today. In a total of 291,700
shares, for the general market, the in
dustrials figured for 210.200 shares and
the sales of Sugar absorbed 154,300
shares of the latter record, leaving only
31.500 shares for the railroad list. Su
gar opened fractionally higher at 105U
per cent, advanced on large dealings
to 106?s per cent, reacted to 102 per
cent and closed at 103 per cent, or 2
points .net lower, as compared with
the final price of the previous day. The
early rise had been attempted to be
explained by a higher market fof for
eign sugars, and the alleged statistical
position of the company, which, it was
declared, foreshadowed the declaration
this week, of the regular dividends.
!'V
ranroaa-x-acjnc tuau settlement, exi
an increase in the dlvi-
' aenu or tne common siock or tne .sortn
i west company tms weeK. ana estimates
of favorable earnings by the granger
roads In the railroads, although bus
iness was very light, these Influences
were operative nearly all day On the
other hand the detection by the traders
of heavy realizing sales in sugar at the
top figures, inspired a drive at that and
the other industrial shares Toward
the end of the first hour there was a
sharp Inquiry for the grangers and
other leading railway shares.whlch was
stimulated by the belief that the ex
ports of gold tomorrow would be lim
ited to the $5,000 odd by order by a
German-American banking house In
this movement Burlington rose 1 per
cent and Louisville and Nashville im
proved to an equal extent on buying
for both local and foreign account.
Important fractions were gained by
other shares. The news of a proposi
tion to advance western anthracite
coal freight rates on Friday next was
confined, in effect on the markets, to
Delaware and Hudson, which gained
3 per cent, only 1 per cent of the im-
j provement being retained to the close,
Incidental to the early attack on the
industrials. Tobacco, broke 3 per cent
and rallied nearly 2 per cent, although
it closed within a fraction of the lowest
TmmAns hlrvlfn of Riip.ir stocks wpr
thrown on the market after -midday
and the price steadily receded. Its
weakness, however, did not Influence
the general market until the final hour
of business, when a general reaction
set in and some material declines were
recorded. Pacific Mall, on the rumors
elsewhere noted, proved superior to the '
general easier tendency and gained
1 per cent. The closing was heavy
in tone and the net changes were di
vided between advances and declines.
The beginning of the antl-consolida-tlon
arguments at Chicago today had a
special adverse Influence upon Chicago
Gas.
The transactions ln bonds aggregated
S1.2C9.000. The market was firm and
higher, with the gains chiefly fractional
FOREIGN STOCK MARKETS.
New York, Dec. 3. The Evening Post
financial cablegrams from London say:
The stock markets were quiet today
but cood. closing at the best. The !
better tone in Paris was the chief cause
of the strength here. Home rails and
mines were the best markets.
Americans were good, closing at tho
best, but mainly on New York support.
