MONDAY EVENING, HARRISBURG UfBKV TELEGRAPH • DECEMBER 10. 191?.
to the great Army camps and
charges of gross Immorality, were
investigated by the bureau in three
different cities, named in the
charges, and in each case pro
nounced groundless.
"Absolutely no foundation could
be found in any one of the three
towns for the statements made about
the girls there," says the report. "It
was a case of rumors added to ru
mors equaling fncts. The danger
that instances of illegitimacy will
result from the camps exist, of
course. Undoubtedly the alertness
of Army and Navy officials in this
country to the need of providing
decent opportunities for social life
among the mobilized troops will be
an important factor in preventing
the rise of the ilegitimate birth
rate here.
Protection For Women
"Protection must be afforded by
proper policing, but far more by
provision of ample social opportu
nities, ample hotel and boarding
space of unquestionable character
for every woman who visits a can
tonment town for any legitimate
reason, suitable chaperonage, and
competent women guides to meet in
coming trains.
"For the lack of any or all these
safeguards young men and women
cannot be held accountable. To
provide them effectively is the busi
ness of officials and civilians no lon
ger young."
During the coming year, the Bu
reau expects to make a country
wide study of st<ite provisions for
the care and protection of despond
ent children and a study of juvenile
courts with respect to the increase
of youthful crime which experience
in other countries has taught always
follows war.
Studies of child welfare in the
| warring countries have shown that
i there has been a decrease in both
the legitimate and illegitimate births,
but that the decrease in the former
has been greater. To a smaller ex
tent than in Kurope. the report says,
the problem of wartime illegitimacy
exists here and "in making plans
for government allowances (for de
pendents of soldiers) the question of
suport of illegitimate children of
members of the military forces must
! be considered."
The pressing essentials of the pro
gram which the Bureau considers
necessary to guard the United States
against the aftermath of the war,
are stated in the report as follows:
List of Instructions
"I—Public protection of matern
ity and infancy. Last year (15,000
mothers and 300,000 children under
live years of age died. Most of the
deaths were preventable.)
"2—Mothers' care for older chil
dren. Essentials: Adequate incomes,
family allowances for soldiers' fam
ilies, mothers' pensions for civilians,
special provision for extraordinary
needs, so far as required to enable
mothers of older children to afford
the home comfort and protection
which :ire the best safeguards
against delinquency.
"3—Enforcement of all child labor
laws and full schooling for all chil
dren of school age. Standards
should be maintained in spite of war
pressure.
"I—Recreation for children and
youth, abundant, decent, protected
I from any form of exploitation."
Permanent success in reducing In
| fant mortality can be achieved only
in connection with the protection of
mothers, according to the report,
which adds that investigations by
the Bureau prove that an adequate
Income earned bv the father of a
family is essential. Studies made in
eight cities showed that while the
mortality among infants born to
families having less than ss!>o an
nual income was 162.5 in each thous
and births, the average was reduced
to 119.8 when the income ranged
from $550 to $849, and was only
C 1.7 when the Income was more
than $1,050.
Work For Low Pay
Where mothers were forced to go
into industry by reason of Insuffi
cient other income, the Infant
death rate was more than twice as
great as in families where the moth
ers remained at home. More than
one-fourth, or 25.8 per cent, of the
fathers of the families investigated,
earned less than $550 a year, while
only one in eight, or 13.1 percent
had an income of $1,250 or more.
The cities investigated were Johns
town, Pa., Montclair, N. J., Manches
ter, N. H., Brockton, Mass., Water
bury Conn., Akron, Ohio, Saginaw,
Mich., and New Bedford, Mass.
The number of women in industry
has increased since the United
States entered the war and in the
new workers an increase was found
in the proportion of married women
to single women. The high cost of
living was given as one reason for
the return of wives to positions in
the Chicago stockyards which they
held before marriage. The report
adds:
"The employers feel that within
the next few months it will be prac- j
tically inevitable that this increase j
in the number of women employed
and in the proportionate gain of
married over single women .will go
still further."
While close studies of maternal
and infant mortality have shown the
superior healthfulness of the country
over cities, as a whole, it was found
that isolation and low incomes to
gether overbalance fresh air and
wholesome surroundings. Particu
larly in western grazing states,
where the population is sparse and
scattered, it was found that lack of
care and medical attention greatly
increased the death rate among
mothers and babies. Welfare work
by industrial corporations in cities
has reduced materially the mortality
among mothers.
"The importance of the care a
mother receives before and at her
child's birth is being constantly more
fully recognized," the report adds.
Whether or not children released
from labor are obtaining the full
benefits intended for them by the
Child Labor Law will be the sub
ject of future studies by the Bureau,
which will endeavor to find out if
they have gone into occupations not
forbidden by law or are in school, or
are both out of work out of
school. Chairman of the State Coun
cils of Defense have been asked to
report on the number of children
not in school.

Knowledge of French to
Aid Employes After War
Knowledge of French will be more
than ever a profitable accomplish
ment after the war. Nearly every
large business will have closer re
lations with European connections
and communication among citizens
will lie closer and more frequent. All
young people in business who are able
to speak French will therefore have
a. decided advantage when promotions
and advancements are considered.
A number of large corporations
especially large New York banks,
have been for some time conducting
regular classes in foreign languages.
Conversational French in all such in
stances takes the lead. Newspapers
now conducting a distribution of the
Soldiers-Sailors Diary and Dictionary,
have been pleased by the enthusiasm
with which civilians as well as those
in the military service seized upon
the book. The new and clear Sound-
Spelling Method of this hook, a hand
somely bound textile, leather volume
of pocket size, makes it especially
popular.
Distribution in this city of the
Soldiers-Sailors Diary and English-
French Dictionary is being conducted
exclusively by this newspaper. A
coupon plan makes it easy for every
reader to obtain the book 'as explain
ed elsewhere in this paper.
Russian Press Abuses
Wilson For War Talk
Petrograd, Dec. 10.—Commenting
on President Wilson's message to
Congress, the Army and Fleet Jour
nal pictures America and Great
Britain as determined to carry on
the war in order that they may tri
umph commercially over all others,
including their allies. It says:
"Peace by means of war! This is
the mask under which the American
imperialists with their inflamed ap
petites are posing. America declares
herself the implacable enemy of Aus
tria-Hungary, without any evident
reason, without any justifying mo
tives save covetojisness and greed.
At the moment in which Russia is
putting forth efforts to end the war,
American capitalists, talking with
hypocrisy of the horrors of war, are
striving to lengthen the bloody ter
ror.
"America and Great Britain de
sire to have all countries so weak
ened that they two will remain the
sole victors, and, over the bodies of
the millions that have been sacri
ficed, divide thg world. Their
bourgeois are dancing cajinabalis
tic dances over the bodies of 10,-
000.000 victims."
The Isvestia. the, semiofficial or
gan of the Soldiers' and Workmen's
Deputies, says:
"This is the old refrain in war to
a victorious end. We are sure the
Krupps and all the other German
and Austrian cannon king's are rub
bing their hands with glee at hear
ing: such talk. The Hohenzollerns
and the Hapatrarg* are rejoicing at
the possibility now of throwing over
to the shoulders of America the re
sponsibility of carrying on the war.
But the mighty call of the Russian
proletariat will soon be heard
throughout the world, and the awak
ened nations will force their govern
ments first to an armistice and then
to peace."
Most of the newspapers, aside from
the I'olsheviki organs, are still not
permitted to print.
National Prohibition
Likely to Pass House
Washington, Dec. 10.—A careful
canvass of the House of Representa
tives with respect to the proposed
constitutional amendments providing
for national prohibition and women
suffrage shows that the prohibition
amendment has a good chance of
passing. The woman suffrage amend
ment will almost certainly be defeat
ed by the almost solid opposition ot
the southern Democrats.
A two-thirds vote is required to
pass a constitutional amendment.
There is a very large majority in
both houses in favor of prohibition.
It can pass the House if all the
friends of the proposal are present
and vote.
The Judiciary committee of the
House expects to report favorably
both the prohibition and woman suf
frage resolutions on Tuesday. Pro
hibition is to be voted upon before
the holidays. The suffrage amend
ment will be disposed of on Janu
ary 8.
Young 'Sid' Drew Prefers
Flying to Trench Life
Atlantic City, N. J., Dec. 10.—Sidney
Drew, who is at the Traymore, has
just received a letter from his son,
Sidney Rankin Drew, who is an avi
ator on the French front. Young
Drew was 12.000 feet in the air when
his engine stopped. He coasted down
and landed near a farmhouse.
"I had dinner with the family in a
big room," he says. "At another ta
ble were the farmhands, German pris
oners. After looking them over I
decided X would rather be above
them, dropping bombs, than meet
them in the trenclres."
GERMAN WAR
PRACTICES GONE
OVER IN REVIEW
Kaiser Indicted With Most
Horrible Inhumanities Civ
ilization Has Ever Seen
Some of the blackest pages in all
history, comprising a documentary
record of "deeds that make one de
spair of the future of the human
race," are found in a book named
"German War Practices," which has
just been issued at the Government
Printing: Office by the Committee on
l'ublic Information for free distribu
tion. It is edited by Prof. D. C. Mun
ro, of Princeton, and other scholars.
The dumfounding evidence which
this book presents to tho jury of
mankind is drawn mainly from Ger
man and American sources, and in
cludes official proclamations and ut
terances of the responsible heads of
the Imperial German government, let
ters and diaries of German soldiers,
quotations from German newspapers,
and material drawn fiom the archives
of the State Department which lay
bare the story of inconceivable Ger
man atrocities.
The purpose of the book is to show
that the system of frightfulness, it
self the greatest atrocity, is the def
inite policy of the German govern
ment, so sinister that German sol
diers have themselves at times re
volted. Individual acts of wanton
cruelty and barbaric destruction are
cited only to illustrate the operation
of the remorseless system.
The book supplements the Bryce
report, which was the official survey
of the path of horror, ruin and death
left by the German army on the lands
of innocent and defenseless people.
The book is supplemental also to the
official reports by the Belgian Com
mission and the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and it reveals more
of the damning German war philoso
phy as expressed in the German
White Book and various official ut
terances, extenuating revolting crimes
on the grounds of expediency and
the advancement of the "Kultur"
which now mocks its name through
out the entire civilized world. The
humanity of German soldiers was so
torn by the system of brutality that
they cried out in letters to Ambassa
dor Gerard, one expressing his pro
test aganst the slaughter of the Rus
sians in tiie Masurian lakes and
swamps by saying, "There is no God,
there is no morality, and no ethics
any more; there are no human beings
any more, but only beasts."
Overwhelmed With Uarrori
The illuminating reports of Brand
[ Whitlock. minister of Belgium, tell of
I miseries inflicted upon the Belgian
people. Mr. Whitlock saying: "One is
j so overwhelmed with the horror ot
the thing itself, that it has been, and
1 even now is difficult to write calmly
I and Justly about it."
j Herbert Hoover, writing for this
l book of his experiences in Belgium,
: says: "The sight of the destroyed
| homes and cities, tho widowed and
| fatherless, the destitute, the physical
j misery of the people but partially
' nourished at best, the deportation of
men by tens of thousands to slavery
in German mines and factories, the
execution of men and women for pal
try effusions of their loyalty to their
country, the sacking of every re
source through financial robbery, the
fattening of armies on the slender
produce of the country, the denuda
tion of the country of cattle, horses
and textiles; all these things we had
to witness, dumb to help other than
by protest and sympathy, during this
long and terrible time, and still these
are not the events of battle heat, but
the effects of a grinding heel of a
race demanding the mastership of the
world. All these things are known'
to the world—but what can never be
known is the dumb agony of the
people, the expressionless faces ot
whose souls have passed the
whole gamut of emotions. Atid why?
Because these, a free and democratic
people, dared plunge their bodies be
fore the march of autocracy."
Frederick C. AValcott's description
of devastated l'oland comprehends
the monstrous woes inflicted by the
Prussian system upon those defense
less people.
In a statement prepared for the
book, Vernon Kellog said: "I went
into Belgium and occupied France a
neutral, and I maintained while there
a steadfastly neutral behavior, but 1
came out no neutral. ... I went
in also a hater of war, but I came out
a more ardent hater of war: but, also
I came out with ineradicable convic
tion, again, that the only way in
which Germany under its present rule
and its present state of mind can be
kept from doing what it has done is
by force of arms.
The books gives excerpts from
the diaries of German soldiers of
which these are specimens: "In the
night of August 18-19 the village ot
Maint-Maurlce was punished for hav
ing fired on German soldiers by being
burnt to the ground by the German

"A horrible bath of blood. The

That the reign of frightfulness was

ernment is testified to by an amaz
ing collection of documents and ut
terances of German officialdom. Here
with are excerpts from documentary
proof furnished by German records
establishing the truth beyond ques
tion:
"As soon as you come to blows
with the enemy he will be beaten. No
mercy will be shown! No prisoners
will be taken! As the Huns, under
King Attila, made a name for them
selves which is still mighty in tra
ditions and legends to-day, may the
name of German be so fixed in China
by your deeds that no Chinese shall
ever again dare to look at a German
askance. . . . Open the way for
Kultur once for all."—From the
Kaiser's speech to the soldiers on the
eve of their departure for China in
1900.
"Whenever a national war breaks
out, terrorism becomes a necessary
military principle." General Von
Hartmann.
"The City of Brussels, exclusive of
Its suburbs, has been punished by an
additional fine of 6.000.000 francs on
account of the attack made upon a
German soldier by Ryskere, one of its
polce officials."— Baron Von Luett
witz. Governor of Brussels.
"I am thirsty; bring me some beer,
gin, rum." "If you lie to me I will
have you shot immediately."—These
sentences are taken from a phrase
book supplied to German soldiers, ac
cording to Minister Brand Whitlock.
"One cannot make war in a senti

conduct of the war, the more humane
it is in reality, for it will run its

U. S. Army of 1,360,000
Raised From 110,000
in 8 Months For War
Albany, Dec. 10.—The State Defense
Council has received from Washing
ton a statement showing what the
United States is doing In the war and
what the people are getting for their
money, and In accordance with the
desire of Governor Whitman makes
it public, as follows:
The latest official figures put the
number of men in the armies of the
United States at 1,300,000. This is
the force which has grown in eight
months out of an army which on
April 1 numbered only 110,000 men.
Most of them are still in the train
ing camps. Many of them are not yet
disciplined troops, fully equipped and
armed for battle. But there they are,
1,360,000 of them, already one of the
biggest factors Hindenburg is reck
oning with for the campaign of 1916.
To lead them thero are more than
SO,OOO officers. When the graduates
of the second training camp get their
first orders the number will be more
than 100,000—as many officers as
there were privates nine months ago.
Of the new American force more
than 300,000 men are Regulars. In
all the world only two regular armies
renTain—the American and the Japa
nese. The others have all been swept
away in the Hood of war. When the
first American onslaught takes place
German Landwehr and Landstrum
troops will find themselves opposed
to an army of professional soldiers.
Behind the Regulars are the 400,000
soldiers of the National Guard, Regu
lars in experience, many of them,
thanks to our neighbor to the south.
After the Guard come the 600,000 men
of the new National Army.
The whole military establishment,
with the Marines and the auxiliary
forces thrown in, numbers 1,500,000.
The expansion that has taken place
is as if Grand Rapids has grown in
eight months to be virtually as big
as Philadelphia.
tur, and in that the population of the
enemy countries can learn a lesson
from our armies."—General Von Bis
