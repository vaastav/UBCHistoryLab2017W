Awful, but Quick Method of Sui
cide Chosen by Despond
ent Austrian Lover.
DELAQUA, Colo.. Dec. 14 Joseph
Tomic, an Austrian, committed suicide
horc this morning in a most horrible
manner. Tomic received a letter yes
torday from his sweetheart in Austria,
inwhich she stated-that she could not
think of marrying him, owing to his
gambling proclivities.
This morning. Tomic, who had been
very despondent since receiving tho let
ter, ran to the top of the coke ovcus,
which were running at white heat, and
jumped in. A cloud of white steam was
seen to rise Crom tho oven, and probably
not tho slightest trace of the man will

KBBEL LEADER A SUICIDE
Revolution Breaks Out Afresh in Guay
aquil, Says Report.
GUAYAQUIL. Dec. 14. When Gen.
Pacr. and the government troops were
entering Cucnca today with the rebels
captured at the battle of Ayancay, a,
mob tried to rescue the prisoners,
whereupon the soldiers fired and dis
persed the mob.
As tho troops fired Col. Vega, the
rebel leader, who was among those cap
tured at Ayancay, drew a revolver nnd
killed himself.
The Conservatives say that Vega was
assassinated b the government troops.
Ttt spite of reports to the contrary,
the revolution against the government
is not crushed. Rebel bands have ap
peared in tho province of Oro and occu
pied tho towns of Santa Rosa, Machala
and Pasaje. It is asserted that Col.
Larrea, has landed in the province of
Oro at the head of a new rebel band,
nnd occupied Tumbes and Pera. Other
I rebel bands arc appearing.
The authorities here hurriedly orga
'nized an expedition to attack the rebels.
This force, of 400, left Guayaquil for
Machala last, night on board tho cruiser
Cotopaxi.

tho Sccrotarj' of War has ordered the
trial by court-martial of Maj. Charles
W. Penrose and Capt. Edgar A. Mack
lin of company C, First battalion.
Twcntj'-fifth infantry, under the sixty
second article of war, for "conduct
to the prejudice oC good order and dis
cipline," in failing in their duties in
preventing and suppressing the riot at
Brownsville, Tex., last August.
The specifications will' include among
other things the charge that the two
officers named failed to exercise due
diligence in preventing the occurrence
when the condition of affairs at Browns
ville made it. necessary that all proper
caution should be taken to prevent a
clash between the troops and citizens;
and also, that they did not examine I he
rifles of the men until daylight, al
though they learned of the true state
of aftairs by 1 or 2 o'clock in the morn
ing. '
The details as to the membership of
tho court and the place where the trial

Whenever Lap Is Nearly Gained
. : Someone Falls, and Gain
Is Not Allowed.
RIDERS LEFT TRACK, BUT
WERE INDUCED TO RETURN
Nearly Three Hundred Miles
Behind the World's
Six-Day Record.
NEW YORK. Dec. 14. Two stirring
incidents marked the progress of tho
six-da' bicycle ni.ee at Madison Square
Garden early today. Tho first came at
2 o'clock, following an attempt of John
Bedell, of tho Walthour-Bedell team, to
gain a lap. Just as he seemed certain
to succeed, Fogler, of tho Poot-Fogler
team, fell, causing a spill in which half
a dozen others unwillingly participated,
and making Bedell's work go for
naught. Several of the riders were temporary-
disabled, Vanderstuj'ft suffer
ing most severely.
The accident and the subsequent pro
test of Walthour and Bedell, who
claimed that Fogler fell purposelv. so
that they could not gain the lap. caused
a long suspension of" tho race. Walthour
and Bedell refused to continue to race,
and nearly an hour was lost, before thej'
could be induced to resume riding.
The other incident was a sensational
nttempt by Bedell and Walthour, at 3
o'clock, to gain a lap and make their
score equal to that of the leaders. The
sprint was one of the wildest and long
est of the- contest. It lasted sixteeu
minutes, and while it continued tho
8000 people in the garden choered up
roariously. Walthour and Bedell relieved pach
other several times, us did also Breton
and Samuelson. Stot and Leon Georget
had to go it alone nil through tho
sprint, which placed them at a disad
vantage. There was a long delay in announcing
the 4 o'clock score, and when it was
made public it was seen that, the timers
had not given any gains or losses during
tho sprint.
At 2 o'clock the nine leading teams
had covered ISOo miles aud 6 laps;
Walthour and Bedell, Brotou and Sam
uelson, ISOo miles nnd 5 laps; Gnlvin
and Wiley, 1S05 miles and 3 laps.
-The leaders are about 320 miles bo
hind the record made by Millor and
Waller.
The score of the nine leaders at 3
o'clock was 1821 miles and 7 laps, with
tho other throe' teams trailing in tho
same relative positions as before.

Another reason why people are sponding their money so freely this yoar is in tho fact that next year thoro Is

BIG MATCH m
BETWEEN RIVAL TEAMS
Logan Basketball Team . Will
Endeavor to Lower Colors
of Local Boys.
Tonight's game of basket-ball between
the fnsL B, Y. C. team of Logan, and
the Y. AI. C. A. team, promises to be a
lively discussion of the relative merits
of the enms.
Tho gamo at Logan last Monday night
should not be taken as final Judgment
of the relative mcrltH of the two leamn,
owing to the fact that by nu unfortun
ate coincidence one regular learn 'guard
and three substitutes were unablo to
leave the city and In order to pi-event
a disappointment of the Loganltes. the
management of that team very gener
ouuly permitted us to play the coach,
Mr. Klwood Brown, at guard. Conse
quently we wish to have It known that
wc would not consider this game as con
clusive evidence of team superiority.
The matter of officials will be difficult
to solve. Every effort has been made
to secure outside official but without
success. The Logan team very gener
ously asks that an Association repre
sentative act at? referee. Thin will not
bo permitted If any possible avenue of
escape prcsonts Itself, as tho Associa
tion has established the precedent in
accordance with a very strong senti
ment that exists In all Associations all
over the country, that of never appear
ing as an official In our own game.
As a preliminary for Saturday nlpht'fi
big gamo the reorganized Granite Stake
team will play the Association's second
team, the outcome of which Is very
doubtful, owing to recent strengthening
of the Granite Stake team.
