Washington, Dec. 2. The senate
will 'be called to order at 12 o'clock to
morrow, but b?yond the probable rc-adv
Ing iaf 'the president's message it will
transact no business, adjourning until
Tuesday out of respect to the memory
of Senators Davis and Gear.
Senator Allison will make the an
nouncement of the death cf ihis late
colleague. Senator Gear, and there is
liope that Senator Nelson may arrive
in time ito perform a similar service
concerning Senator Davis. These an
nouncements will be preceded by the
ceremony of swearing in the ne.v
members, who, ithis year, are Mr. Dol
liver, who has been appointed to suc
ceed Senator Gear, and Mr. Dilling
ham, who takes the place formerly oc
cupied by Senator Ross of Vermont,
and the appointment of the usu'al com
mittees to wait up:n the president and
house of representatives.
Mr. Frye expects to get up the ship
ping subsidy 'bill on Tuesday and ;f
not on that day, then on Wednesday,
and in doing this, to have the Spoone
Philippine bill displaced. This will be
the. beginning of the important work
of five session and upon the success or
failure of the schema may depend
much of the future course of the pro
ceedings for the entire session. In or
der Ito accomplish this result it will be
necessary first to get the. consent of
the republican committee on order of
business, and to this end a meeting of
that committee will be held after the
adjournment of the senai.e -on Monday
afternoon.
Mr. Frye said today that he had conferred-
with' the majority- of the mem
bers of the committee and that he fdt
assured he would have no difficulty in
securing assent to the proposed change. 1 quarter, and two of last year's Indian

look for a factious opposition to th?
taking up of tha bill from that source.
The motion to take up the measure is
not debatable under the s?na:e rules
and they are confident of a majority
vote if a roll call should be demand-id.
It is probable that a friendly argument
will be made with Senanor Morgan,
who has the Nicaraguan bill in charge,
the bill being on the calendar at spec
ial order for the 10th instant. There
is 9ome talk of an effort
during the i
week to get up the

treaty in executive ses-:on. a mme-

the committee on foreign relations to
an abandonment of the Davis amend
ment to the treaty for la? fortification
of the proposed canal.
The usual, custom of adjourning over
from Thursday until thro following .
Monday during the first week i.f the
session will probably be departed from
this season. That Is tha desire of the
republican leaders now here and they
say there probably will be no such ad
journment. THE HOUSE
Washington-, Dec. 2. The leaders of
the house are preparing to press with
great rigor the important business of
the short session which convenes to
morrow. Already considerable prelim
inary committee wort has br-en done
on the bill for the reduction of the war
revenue taxes, army reorganization
bill, river and harbor Dili, and on sev
eral of the appropriation hills, and the
legislative mill will s'cart under a full
head of steam. The army reorganiza
tion bill Is considered particularly ur
gent, owing to the possibility of its
meeting strenuous opposition after it
reaches the senate, and it is the inten
tion of the leaders to get ic out cf the
way at the first possible moment. It
will be reported probably on Tuesday
and will be taken up at once unless af
ter further consideration it is decided
to let the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill, which also
will be ready on Tuesday, in ahead of
it. The democrats will caucus on the
army bill on Monday, and the indica
tions now are that they will offer as a
substitute for a permanent reorganiza
tion measure a bill extending for two
or three years the present law for the
provisional army. The bill to reduce
the war revenue taxes has been prac ti
cally completed by the repub.ican mem
bers of the ways and means committee
and it will be submitted to the full
committee on Tuesday, unle-ss in the
meantime a caucus of the republicans
should be found advisable. Some of the
republican members are noticed with a
list of articles relieved of taxation by
the bill and If 'too much opposition be
comes evident when the house con
venes on Monday the leaders probably
will call a conference caucus for the
purpose of adjusting and harmonizing
differences. On Thursday, the Grout
oleomargarine bill wil? come up as
special order under a rule made at the
last session. It imposes a tax of 10
cents per p:mnd on oleomargarine, but
terine or other .manufcaiiured foodstuffs.

induce M. Coquelin to lecture at 'the

in the work. While details as yet are
not announced, it is certain that admis

the rule followed heretofore When
Henry Irving and others lectured to

FOOTBALL TEAM FORMED
Players of Old Champion Phoenix
Eleven Have Reorganized.
At a meeting yesterday morning of
old foot ball players an eleven was or
ganized. The new team will be com
posed largely of men who played' in
the eleven of two or three years ago,
which at that time was the best in the
territory. F. Slain was chosen captain
and L. H. Hamilton manager. The
first practice was held yesterday morit
ing and an hour spent in light work.
The team will practice daily from now
on and the first game will be played
with the Indian school or the Univer
sity of Arizona, either on Christmas or
New Year's. Later It is intended to
get a game or two with the -normal
school, and if possible with Prescott.
Prescott formerly boasted of a good
foot ball team, which met the Phoenix
men in several contests. There are
about twenty of the old time players
who are anxious to get into the game
again, both for the sport's sake and for
the physical training to be derived
therefrom. Sprouse will probably play
center. White, Robinson and Thomp
son are available for guards; Farish,
P.osenberg. Zander and MeClintock
will be likely be candidates for tackles:
Linville, Lockwood, Stroud and Butt
are all good ends: Slain will pVay
There are a half dozen other men who
wilt probably be considered in the
make-up of the eleven.
THE SLVER TRAIL.
The Silver Trail mine, one of the
graup now being operated by the Re
liance. Mining company, in Hassayam
pa district has long been noted
for the heavy percentage of lead car-
re& by its ores. The workers in this
I,
property have just n agreeably sur
prised by exposing on the 250-foot leva!
a body of ore 11 feet wide, which car
ries from 10 to 20 percent copper, and
which brings the value of 'the ore up
l to about $70 a ton. Twenty tons or
this el'ass of ore has already been tak
en out. It will be remembered that
some months ago a good deal of $:iuO
ore was taken from the Azil.cC mine,
one of this same group. The ere now
being taken from the Silver Trail is
very similar to that which was taken
from the Aztec and is expected to equal
it in richness as depth is reached. L.

SIMPSON AT WORK.
Jerry Simpson has sold his newspa
per and is now actively cmgag. d in con
nection with the affairs of a live stock
comission company, -of which he is a
director, at Kansas City.
Since the republicans captured the
legislature, Mr. Simpson has besn
saved the trial of a campaign" for
United States Senator, which he ha?
been waging for several years, and is
now devoting himself entirely to busi
ness affairs.
Mason Peters, defeated for congress
in the second district, by J. D. Bower
sock, is the manager of the company,
having organized soon after complet
ing his first and only term in con
gress. This company numbers among its
directors several populist politicians,
all of whom announce that they have
retired from politics.
MINING INTELLIGENCE.
The. Yaeger Canyon Copper company
has been prospecting its property in
Yaeger canyon by means of a diamond
drill and have sunk a number of holes
ion it. The deepest one is between 500
and 600 feet deep and it gives a splen
did showing of copper at this depth.
All the prospecting done at this depth
ha3 shown up very satisfactory.
Report comes from Stanton that very
rich ore is being found in a claim
owned and being worked by George B.
Upton. He is now running a tunnel
in on the vein. It is now in about 10P
feet and has encountered ore which
runs all the way from $40 to $115 per
ton. He has a two-stamp mill on the
property wbich he proposes starting up
very soon. Journal-Miner.

CONTEST IN NEBRASKA
Mr. Meiklejohn Satisfied With
His Prospect
Editor Rosewater Denies That His
Friends Will Refuse to Caucus
With the Republicans Unless
Assured of His Election.
, Washington. Dec. 2. Two of Ne
braska's fore-most candidates for
United . States senat'or, are now in
Washington Hon. George D. Meikle
john, as-istant secretary of war, and
Mr. E. Rosewater, editor of the Omaha
Bee. Mr. Meiklejohn is quite satis
fied with the preliminary conditions
in Nebraska, and confident of the suc
cess of his candidacy.
Editor Rosewater .who has been here
for several days on departmental busi
ness, last night made the following
statement:
"Reports circulated through the Eas-t
ern pree3 concerning the outcome, in
Nebraska, and especial'y the pending
senatorial contest, are inaccurate and
misleading. The first report, immedi
ately following the election, conveyed
the impression that the fusionists had
elected a majority of the legislature.
Later reports have foreshadowed a
combination between republican and
fusionists that would elect one repub
lican and one populist or democrat.
Sere of these reports have gone so far
as to couple my name with the com
bine, and o.hers have charged that the
members pledged to my support would
refrain from participating with the re
publicans In their organization, unless
positve assurances were gven of my
election. There is. abcslute'.y no
ground for .these assertions.
CONOR EPS CONVENES TODAY

to labor for my election in caucus, as
well as in the legislature, and they

ries to the contrary are merely gotten
up in the interests of rival candidates."

MOUNTAIN SHEEP HUNTERS
Four, Antlered Hill Climbers Fall
Victims to Powder and EalJ.
Drs. M. A. Green and E. G. Carl
ton, of Bisbee, accompanied by Albert
P. Behan, custom officer at this point
returned last Saturday from the Te-
najas-Altas section of the county,
where they spent several days in quest
of mountain sheep, which abound in
that region. For their efforts, th3
huntsmen were rewarded by securing
four splendid specimens of the antlered
denizens of the hills, the antlers of one
measuring seventeen inches in circum
ference at the 'base, says the Yuma
Sun.
A good irany more sheep could have
been killed, a? they were found in
plentiful numbers, but it was purely
with a desire to secure same good spec
imens for mounting that the Bisbee
gentlemen took the trip, white Mr.
Behan, who is a most enthusiastic
sportsman, accompanied them on the
trip, because of his acquaintance with
the country.
The mountain fheep of Arizona are
hardly as large as those of the north
ern states, but the largest of those
killed by this party would compare fa
vorably with the average to found
anywhere. Sheep hunting is fine, but
very fatiguing sport, and numerous
sections of Yuma county afford excel
lent opportunities for the attainment
of successful results.
Drs. Green andi Carlton- are 'now
down at the Hardy Colorado, secur
ing specimens of birds and animals in

SIX DEER OUT OF EIGHT
Yuma County Goes the Yavapai
Hunting Story Two Better
The story icomes from Prescott that
a young man named Thompson killed
an entire bunch of four deer last Wed
nesday at one stand. It Is heralded as
the crack deer story of the season: but
Yuma, county can go it two better.
Walt;r Winsor, a short time ago,
killed six deer out of a bunch of eight
near his ranch in Cibola valley, at one
run, rather than stand, for almost all
of them were on the run when his ritle
brought them down, two of them being
shot at very long-range. His gun did
not hold enough cartridges, or he couId
probably have secured the two that es
caped. The hunter gained a point of
slight eminence, overlooking a
valley, in which the bunch of deer were
feeding, before they discovered his
presence, and then it was too late for
most of them. A couple of them, had
fallen before they decided which way
to run, and then, as luck would have it,
they ran the wrong way for the pre
servation of their lives.
When they finally got straightened
out and headed toward safety, but two
were able to reach the goal.
HARD LUCK STORY
A Miner's Unequal Contest Against
Fate, Rats and Range Cattle.
David Care is a horny handed miner
who owns some good claims up in the
edge of the Bradshaws on which he
has recently been doing his assessment
work. He returned t-3 Phoenix a day
or two ago to change his clothes. His
tale cf woe follows:
"I hired a pack train at Canyon sta
tion to take my outfit to my camp
some miles distant. Arriving, I found
my spring had gone dry, something
that T had never known to occur be
fore. But I knew where there was
another one a couple of miles up in the
hills, so I took a couple of canteens on
-my back and went after water. On the
way back to camp the strap on one of
ithem broke and It went tumbling over
a precipice 200 feet high. I picked It
up badly shattered and that evening
tried to mend it with doug'n made of
flour. During the night the rats ate
the paste, so I had to plug along with
one canteen.
"A few days ago I went up to the
spring to do my washing, taking along
all my clothes. I washed them and
hung them up to dry and when I re
turned the iext day I found the hun
gry range cattle had eaten them up.
I am here now to buy more clothes,
but will not go back to camp till the
grass gets better."
