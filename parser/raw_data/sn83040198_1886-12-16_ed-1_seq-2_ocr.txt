The Commissioner's report upon the public ' '

ful exhibit. It appears from this document ,
that most of the available agricultural land
iu most of the public laud Mates and Tcrri- .
tones has been largely returned as surveyed
and the surveys pad for by the L'n-rcd
States, but in many instances the reported
surveys are so defective and errotienun as to
be without merit and misleading, end that In

but plats were manufactured upon the bits. 8

BUKKAU OF LAIlOa
The Commissioner of Labor submitted his
annual report on Urch 17 last. It was ini-r-possible
tor hlxu tu submit a full report of
the operations of the bureau at an earlier- .
date, because the bureau was not-orgaiifsod
until during the last half of the 'fixcal year
ended June 30, 18K5. This first report relates
eut roly to industrial depressions and is the
result ol a pluu ov,liued by the Couuuitiiuuaer .
and approved ty mo March 17, It
groups facts drawn from trustworthy mutrcj
iu I'uropo and America, which show conclu
sively that the depression which has existed
in the United Mates for the pant decade or
more has beeu contemporaneous, not only In
features but extent, with dcpfustious in e
in other industr.al countries. The tacts col
lected warrant the deduction that Industrial
depressions wcro largely exaggerated
through the apprehension of busiuess in en .'
and ot the public generally, growing out of a
want of clearly defined knowledge of current
events. l"
Among the various causes alleged by man
ufacturers and others for the exlstf no-of '
industrial depress. ons are to be found tbe ir
feegulantics exist-ng 111 the rates of duty un
der present tariff legislation. Tho nature"
and mllueiiceof theseirreirularities are lilus- '
tratcd by statistics gathered by agents tf
the bureau, relating to lines of goods ,
manufactured in Kugland and largely im-jortc-d
into our owu markets. Many wcll
liiformed bus ness men allege that high
duties on Imported goods conptiiuto a terl
ius disturbing intluenco in mnnulacturing.
but they complain more of the inequalities
in rates than of h irli or low rates of duty. .
The fctatiitics ju6t referred to show that iu
one line of goods manufactured at Leeds
the var-ation is from6o p-r cent, to ISO
:er cent, on the price at the factory in Kng---aud.
tbe hlg-hest pr ced c-oods niime l ,
being west-ol'-Knglaud broadcloth, worth
per surd .in Jeds. the , spccjtlp .
duty lin :k cents per pound ' and tho
iM& valorem i per cent, making a total of 50.3
per ccut. on the value at the factory, while it
is further shown that this er cent. 011 cost
steadily increases until it reaches lt.7. on
low priced gooos. I hese glaring iniHiualities
are a potent cause of apprehension in the
minds 01 orouueers, 01 oisi urimnce in vuiucs,
and. therelore. of corresponding depreRr'Ions.
With theie facts comes a most valuable sug- .
gostioa to which k wish to call uiteiitlon un l.y
this suggestion the Co-.imtssioner puts in the'
loliowiug words:
"The adjustment or rates or.outy on
manufactured goods should be in uccordauoo .
with the labor cost of production, etc. . .
The labor cost In production and all the other" -
elements or production must oe eonsiucreu
betore an equ.tame sciieuuie can du ar
ranged. LTntii some such basin is adctited
the inequalities shown w 11 exist al-
thodgh they may be shifted so fur us pro
ducts are concerned."
In discusit!g rciucdtl measures the Cora
missioner says: -
"The judicious revision of tho tariff regu
lating duties on a just and equitable bnsia,
iu so fer ns it removes apprehension and put .
all b.isiness on a fairer bas s, would 1e a '
r&medial measure. Suchadjustmerit would 0
br.nif stability, would relieve manufacturers
of anxWrty. would sat:ffy labor and kei-p Jbo
tw-Hsury supplied with funds. Pract-caJly;
these are the ends sought, it ts presumed, by
by an adjustment or the tariff, etc. Any ad
justment on the basis of the cost of produc- s
tion would inevitably result in a constant en
largement ot the tree-list, and in so lar
would have a moral effect in the community .
which could not be otherwise than health
ful." And, further, that a statutory provision"'
should be made by which the tariff should Lo '
regulated on abasis of justice and science.
and not on a haphazard bass, which utioct-f
only ii'.tjiviriual interests and oftentimes In
flicts general harm.
The original Uibles in the report compre
hend about forty industries, 7.' estubi.sh
mentR, and l.Vi.tmo employes, and they prJ
vide conclusively the leasibiiiry of collecting
exact information as to the cost of produc-.
tion upon all great products of this country
and tin? countries where such products come
Into competition In the commerce of the '
world. With such Information it seems ther
would be little d.fticulty In adjusting tardf.
rates upon an equitable basis.
