At the outset of a reference to the more Im
portant matters affecting our relations with
forelim powers It would afford me satisfaction
U I could assure congress that the di turbed
condition in Asistlc Turkey bad ourlng the
pastyesr assumed a less hideous and bloody
aspeet. aud that either as a consequence of
tbe awakening of the Turkish government lo
the demands of humane civilisation, or as tbe
result of derisive action on the part of the
f reat nations hsvlng the right, by treat v to
nterfera for the protection of tho-e exposed
to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanati
cism, the shocking features of the situation
bad been jiltlgateO,
Instead, however, of welcoming a softened
disposition or positive intervention, we bsve
been afflicted by confirmed snd not unfrequent
reports of tho wanton destruction of homes
and tbe bloody butchering of men. women snd
children, made martyrs to their profession of
Christian faith. While none of our cliisens In
Turkey hae thus far been killed or wounded,
though often In the midst of dreadful scenes of
danger, their safety In the future is by no
means assured. Our government at home and
our minister at Constantinople hsve left noth
ing undone to protect our mission arips In Ot
toman territory, who constitute nearly all the
Individuals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of American
citizenship.
Several bsvsl vessels are stationed in tbe
Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to
lurnitih all possible relief and refuge in case of
emergency.
I The Cuban Insurrection!
The insurrection In Cuba still continues with
all Its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive
that auy progress has thus far been made to
waids the paciricatlon of the Island or that the
situation of affair as depleted In my last an
nual message has In tbe least Improved. If
Spain stlil holds Havana and the ceaports and
all the Considerable towns, the Insurgents still
roam at will over at least two-thirds of the
Inland country. If the determination of Spain
to put down the Insurrection seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time, and Is evi
denced by her unhesitating devotion of largely
Increased military and naval forces to the
task. there is much reason to believe
that tbe insurgents have gained in
poin of numbers and character and
resources, and are none the less inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb, without prac
tically securing the great object for which they
t ok un arms. If Spain has not yet re-established
her authority, neither have the Insur
gent yet made good their title to be regarded
as an Independent state. Indeed, as tbe cn
Net goes on, the pretense that civil govern
ment exists on the Islani, except so fares
Spain Is able to maintain it. has been practical
ly abandoned. Spain des keep on foot
such a government, more or less Imperfectly,
In the large towns and their Immediate sub
hrbe. Hut. that exception telng made, tbe
entire country Is cither given over to anarchy
or Is subject to the military occupation of one
or the other party.
It Is reported. Indeed, on reliable authority,
that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief
of the insurgent army, the reputatlve
Cuban government has now given up all at

They also are participated In by bands of
marauders, who. now In the name of one party
and now In the name of the other, as may bet
salt the occasion, harry the country at will and
plunder Its wretched tnhsbltsnts for their own
advantage. Such a condition of things would
Inevitably entail Immense destruction of prop
erty, even If It were the policy of both parties
to i re vent U as far as practicable. But while
euch seemed to be the original policy of the
Spanish government. It has now apparently
abandoned It, and Is acting upon the same
theory as the lnsurgenis. tnamely. that the
exigencies of the contest require the wholesale
annihilation of property, that It may not
prove of use and advantage to the enemy.
It is to tbe same end that in pursuance ot
general orders. Spanish garrisons are now be
ing withdrawn from plantations and the rural
population required to concentrate Itself in tbe
towns. The sure result would seem to be that
the Industrial value of the island is fast di
minishing snd thst unlesss there Is a speedy
and radical change in existing conditions, ft
will soon dlssppear altogether. That value
consists very largely, of course. In Us capacity
to produce sugar-a capacity already much re
dared by the interruption of tillage, which has
taken place during tbe last two years.
It Is reliably asserted thst should these In
terruptions continue during tbe current year,
and practically extend, as is now threatened,
to the end. the sugar-producing territory of
the Island, so much time snd so much money
will be required to restore the land to its
normal productiveness that it Is extremely
doubtful If capital can be Induced to even
make the stten.pt. The spectacle of the utter
rain of an adjoining country, by nature one of
the most fertile and charming on the globe,
would engage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and people of tbe United States un
der any circumstances. In point of fact they
nave a concern with it which is by no means of
wholly sentimental or philanthropic charac
ter. It lies so near to us as to be hardly sep
arated from our territory.
Our actual pecuniary Interest in It Is second
only to that of the people and government of
Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at
least from 3 i.OOO.tOO to ffi0.o00.0 of American
capital are Invested in plantations and In rail
road, mining and other business enterprises
os the island. The volume of trade between
the United States and Cuba which, in !
amounted to about let .000.000. rose In 1893 to
about ilOa.000.GOO. and In l(sM, tbe year before
tbe present Insurrection broke out. amounted
to nearly tfS.0P0.CCO. Besides this large pecu
niary stake In the fortunes of Cuba, tbe United
States finds Itself inextricably involved in the
present contest In other ways, both vexatious
snd costly.
Mnv Cubans reside in this country, and in
directly promote the Insurrection through the
press, by public meetings, by the purchase
i.ad shipment of arms, by the raising of fund,
rod by other mease, which the spirit of our
institutions and tbe tenor of cur laws do not
permit to be made tbe subject of criminal
prosecutions.
Some of them, though Cubans at heart and
In all their feelings and Interests, have taken
oat papers as naturalized cltisens of the
United States, a proceeding resorted to with s
lew to possible protection by this govern
ment, afld not unnaturally regarded with much
indignation by tbe countrv of their or-
brls. The insurgents are undoubtedly I
ercovraed sc- lufpeiied b? W wW-prs3 J
sympathy the people of this country always
ano instinctively reel for every struggle for
better ahd freer government, and Witch in
the rae of the more adventuro-i iic3 restless
elements of oMr bobulatlon. leads, in only too
many Instances, to active and personal partic
ipation in tbe content. The result is tWt this
government la constantly veiled upon to pro
tect American eltehs. to claim damages for
injurlea to persons and property, now esti
mated at many millions of dollars, and to ask
explanations and apologies for the acta of
Spanish officials, whose zeal for the repression
of rvbelllon sometimes blinds them to the lm
fhunit e! belonging to the unoffending citizens
of a friendly power. It follows from the same
causes that the United States Is compelled to
actively police a long line of seacoast against
unlawful expeditions, the escape of which tbe
utmost vigilance will not always suffice to pre
vent. These inevitable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion In Cuba, the
large American property Interests affected,
and considerations of philanthropy and hu
manity in general, have led to a vehement de
mand th various quarters fbr some sort of
positive intervention on the part of the United
States.
It was at first proposed that belligerent
rights should be accorded to the Insurgents a
proposition no longer urged, because untimely
and imprarttcal In Operation and clearly peril
ous and injurious to our own Interests, ft has
been and is now sometimes contended that the
Independence of the Insurgents shottld be rec
ognized. But Imperfect ahd restricted as the
Spanish gevernmcnt of the Island mav be. no
Other eslsth there- unless tbe wiil of the mili
tary officer In temporary command cf a par
ticular district can be dignified as a species of
government. It Is now also BMaSetSd thai the
United States should buy tbe island a sug
gestion possibly worthy of consideration If
there sere any evidence of a desire or will
ingness on tbe part of Spain to entertain such
a proposal. It is urged, finally, that all other
methods falling, the existing internecine strife
In Cuba should be terminated by our interven
tion, even at tbe cost of a war between tbe
L nlted States and Spain a war which Its ad
rocotes confidently prophesy could be neither
large in Its proportions nor doubtful in Its is
sue The correctness of this forecost need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States baa. nevertheless, a character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that
right and not might should be the rule of its
rondUct.
Further, though the Uhlted States is not a
nation to which peace Is a necessity. It is lu
truth the moat pacific of powers, and desires
nothing so much as to live in amity with all
tbe world. Its own ample and diversified do
mains saiisry an possible longings for tern
tory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and pre
vent any casting of Covetous eye upOn neigh
boring regions however attractive. That our
conduct towards Spain snd her dominions has
constituted nociception to this national dis
position Is made manifest by the course of our
government, not only thus far during the pres
ent Insurrection, but during the ten years that
followed the rising at Vara In 168.
No other great power. It may safely be said,
under circumstances of similar perplexity,
would have manifested the same restraint and
the same patient endurance. It may also be
said that this perslsteht attitude ot the United
Slates toward Spain in connection with Cuba
Will unquestionably evince no slight respect
and regard for Spain on the part of the Amer
ican people. They, in truth, do not forget her
connection with the discovery of the western
hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the
great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fall
to fully recognise their splendid patriotism and
their chivalrous devotion to the national honor.
Tbey view with wonder and admiration the
cheerful resoluf'on with which vast bodies of
men are sent aerass thousands of miles of
ocean and an enormous debt accumulated, that
the costly possession of the Gem of the An
tilles may still hold Its pluce In the Spanish
crown, and yet neither the government nor tbe
people of the United States have shut their
eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have
failed to realize tbe existence of conceded
grievances, which have led to the present re
volt from the authority of Spain grievances
recognised by the queen regent and by
the cortes. voiced by the most patriotic and
enlightened of Spanish statesmen without
regard to party, ana demonstrated by reforms
proposed by the executive and approved by the
legislative branch of the Spanish government.
It is In the assumed temper and disposition of
the Spanish government to remedy these griev
ances, fortified by Indications of influential
public opinion In Spain, that this government
has hoped to discover the most promising and
effective means of composing the present strife,
with honor snd advantage to Spain, with the
achievement of all the reasonable objects of
the Insurrection.
It would seem that If Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rnle which, while preserving the sovereignty
of Spain, would satisfy all rational require
ments of her Spanish subjects, there sbould be
no just reason why the pacification of the Is
land might not be effected on that basis. Such
a result would appear to be in the Interest of
all concerned. It woul.1 at once stop the con
flict, which Is now consuming the resources of
the Island and making It worthless for which
ever party mar ultimately prevail. It
would keep Intact the possessions of
Spain without touching her honor, which
will be consulted rather than Impugned by
tbe adequate redress of admitted grievances
It would put the prosperity of tbe island and
tbe fortunes of Its Inhabitants within their
own control without severing the natural and
ancient ties which bind them to tbe mother
country, and would yet enable them to test
tbelr capacity for self-government under the
most favorable conditions.
It has been objected, on the one side, that
Spain should not promise autonomy until her
Insurgent subjects lay down their arms. On
the other side, that promised autonomy, how
ever liberal, is Insufficient, because without
assurance of tho promise being fulfilled.
But the reasonableness of a requirement by
Spain of unconditional surrender on the part
of tho Insurgent Cubans before thelrautonom.V
is conceded Is not altogether apparent
It Ignores imnortant features of the situation
- the stability two years" duration has given
to the Insurrection: the feasibility of Its In
definite prolongation in the nature of thing",
and as shown by past experience: the utter
and Imminent mln of the island, unless the
present strife is speedily composed: above all,
the rank abuses whicn all parties In Spain, all
tranches of her government and all her lead
ing public men concede to exist and profess a
desire to remove.
Facing such circumstances, to withhold the
profer of needed reforms until the parties
demanding them put themselves at mercy by
throwing down their arms, has the appearance
of neglecting the gravest of perils and Invit
ing suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro
fessed willingness to grant reforms.
Tbe objection on behalf of the Insurgents
that promised reforms can not be relied upon
-must, of course, be considered, though we
have no right to assume, and no reason for as
suming, that anything that Spain undertakes
to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac
cordlngto both the spirit and the letter of the
undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and
precautions on the part of the weaker of two
combatants are always natural and not always
unjustifiable, and being sincerely desirous in
the Interest of both as well as on its own ac
count that the Cuban problem should be solved
with the least possible delay, it was Intimated
by this government to the government of
Spain some months ago that, if a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the Cu
ban insurgents and would be accepted by
them upon a guaranty of ts execution, the
United States would endeavor to find a way
not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such
guaranty.
While no definite response to this Intimation
has yet been received from tbe Spanish gov
ernment, it Is believed to be not altogether
welcome, while, as a treaty is suggested, no
reason la perceived why It should not be ap
proved by the Insurgents. Neither party can
fail to see the Importance of early action, snd
both must realise that to prolong the present
state of things for even a short period will add
enormously to the time and labor and expendi
ture necessary to bring about tbe industrial
recuperation of the island. It Is. there
fore, fervently hoped on all grounds
that earnest efforts for healing tbe
breach between Spain sud tbe insurgent Cu
bans upon the lines above indicated, mav be
at once inaugurated and pushed to un imme
diate and successful issue. Tbe friendly of
fices of the United States, either In the man
ner above outlined, or in any other way con
sistent with our constitution and laws, will al
ways be at the disposal of either party.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our po.
lcy and our interests would constrain us to ob
ject to the acquisition of the island or the In
terference with its control by any other
power.
It should he added that it can not be reason
ablp assumed that the hitherto expectant at
titude of the United States will be indefinitely
maintained. While we are anxious to accord
all doe respect to tbe sovereignty of Spain, we
can not view the pending conflict in all its
features and properly apprehend our Inevitable
relations to it. and possible results, without
considering that, by tbe course of events, we
may be drawn Into such an unusual and un
precedented condition as will fix a limit to our
patient waiting for Spain to end the contest,
either alone and In ber own way, or with our
friendly co-operation.
When the Inability of Spain to deal success
fully with the insurrection has become maul
test, and It is demonstrated that her sover
eignty is exunct in t. una jor an rurpos.es oi its
rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug
gle tor its re-cstablisbment has degenerated I
into a strife which means nothing more than I

A contemplation of emergencies that may

deemed it not amiss to remind the congress
that a time may arrive when a correct policy
and care for our interests, as well as a regard
for the interests of other nations and their

The Venezuelan Koundary Ouestion.
The Venesuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain Snd the United States, their re
st ecttve governments having ugreed upon tbe
substantial provisions of a treaty between
Great Uritaiu aud Venezuela submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The pro
visions of the treaty arc so eminently just and
fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may
confidently be anticipated.
Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitra
tion for all differences between Great Britain
and the United States are far advanced und
promise to reach n successful consummation at
an early dute.
Seal l ife in ftehrlng- Sea
We have durii g the last year labored faith
fully, and against unfavoiable conditions, to
secure better preservation of seal life in the
Retiring sea. Both the United States and
Great Britain have lately dispatched commis
sioners to these waters to study the habits and
condition of the seal herd and the causes of
their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of
these commissioner-, soon to be submitted,
and with the exercise of patience and good
sense on the part of all interested parties, it is
earnestly hoped that hearty co-operation may
be secured for the protection ugainst the
threatened extinction of seal life in the north
ern Pacific and Behring sea.

tries whence they came, at the expense of the
steamship companies by which they were
brought in.
There arrived from Japan during the year
only 1,110 immigrants, and it Is the opinion of
the Immigration authorities that the appre

a large Immigration from Japan to the United
States is without any substantial foundation.
Ilix I.lfe-sjTliig Service.
From the life-saving service it is reported
that the number of disasters to documented

the vessels were totally wrecked. There were,
besides. 243 casualties to small undocumented
craft, on board of which there were 694 persons,
of which 587 were saved and seven were lost.

congress is especially Invited.
XI1E WA DEPARTMENT.
Satisfactory Conditions Shown.
The report of the secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several branches
of the public service intrusted to his charge.
The lmit of our military force, as fixed by
law. Is constantly and readily maintained. The
present discipline and morale of our army are
excellent, and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organiza
tion. Tbe entire army has sew been equipped with
new magazine arms, and wise policy demands
that all available pubile and private resources
should be so employed as to provide, within a
reasonable time, a sufficient number to supply
the state militia with these modern weapons
and provide an ample reserve for any emer
gency. Tbe Organized Milltbs.
The organized militia lumbers 112379 men.
The appropriations for . support by the sev
eral states approximate $2,800,000 annually,
and 1400.000 is contributed by tbe general gov
ernment. Investigation shows these troops
to be usually well drilled and inspired with
much military interest, but In many instances
they are so deficient In propcrarms and equip
ment that a sudien call to active duty Wt uld
find them inadequately prepared for field
service. I therefore recommend that prompt
measures be taken t renedy this condition,
snd that even encou. acerr.eiu be g'.veu to this
fif rvinf body of ospsiu sod yg-toBHw c;u-

This improved situation is largely due to the
recent generous, response ot congress to tiie
recommendations of the tar (dei artment
Thus we shall soon have complete, about one
fifth of the comprehensive system, the fifs$
step In which was noted in my message. to the
congress of December 4, 18"J!.
The experience and result of the past year
demonstrate that with a continuation of pres
ent careful methods tbe cost of the remaining
work frill be much less than the original esti
mate. We should always keep in mitld that of
all foHns Of military preparation const de
fense alone is essentially pacific iff its nature1:
While it gives the sense of security due tb a
consciousness of strength, it is neither the
purpose nor the effect of such permanent forti
fication to involve us in complications, but
rather to guarantee us ugainst them- They are
no temptation to war. but security against it.
Thus they are tborouphl;-. In accord with all
tile traditlbbs of our national diplomacy.
Department of dtsTitfe!
Government Penitentiaries.
The attorney general presents a detailed and
interesting statement of the important work
done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. The ownership and management
by the government of penitentiaries for the
ontinemcnt of the convicted in United States
courts of violations of federal lawsf which for
many years hns been a subject Of executive
recommendation, has at last, to a slight ex
tent, been realized by the utilization of
tho abandoned military prison at Fort
Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary
This is certainly a movement in the right
direction; but it ought to be at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge
ment of this impfovished prison, and the con
struction or at least one more, to be located in
the southern states.
The New Salary System.
It is most gratifying to note the satisfactory
results that huve followed the inauguration of
the new system provided for by the act of
May 28. 1896, under which certain federal offi
cials are compensated by salaries instead of
fees. The new plan was put in operation on
the first day of July. 1896, and already the
great economy It enforces. Its prevention of
abuses and Us tendency to a better enforce
ment of the laws are strikingly apparent. Be
tailed evidence of the usefulness of this long-
aeiayea Dut now napptiy-accompnphed re
form win be round clearly set forth in the at
torney general's report.
1'OST OF ICE DEPARTMENT.
Its Operations Bnrlng; the Past Tear.
Our post office department is In good condi
tion and the exhibit tnade of Its operations
during the fiscal year, ended June 80, 181'6, if
allowance is made for Imperfections in the
laws applicable to it. Is very satisfactory. The
total receipts during the year were $82,499.' 03. -
40. The total expenditures were 90.fo,96.84
exclusive of $1,559,898.27. which was earned by
the Pacific railroad for transportation, and
credited on their debt to tho government
There was on Increase of receipts over tho
previous year oi j.:id,o80.2l, or 7.1
per cent., and an increase of expendi
ture of J3.8P.6.124.02. or 4.42 per cent
The deficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of
the preceding year.
Abuse of the Service.
The transmission at the rate of one cent a
pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets
f,house organs" (periodicals advertising some
paitlculur house or Institution), sample
copies, and the like, ought certainly to be dis
continued. A glance at the revenues received
for the work done last year will show more
plainly than any other statement the gross
abuse of the postal service and the growing
waste or its earnings.
The free matter carried in the malls for the
departments, offices, etc., of the government
and for congress In pounds amount to 94.48 ,-
189.
Corrective Legislation Recommended.
If such second-class matter paid m-rely the
cost of its handlingour deficit would disappear
ami a surp.us result, wincn mlgbt be used to
givo the people still better mall facilities or
cheaper rates of letter postage. I recommend
that legislation be at once enacted to correct
these abuses and introduce better business
ideas in the regulation of our postal rates.
Universal l ostal Union.
The Universal Postal union, which now em
braces all the civilized world, and whoso dele
gates will represent 1.000,000,000 people, will
hold its fifth congress in the city of Washing
ton in way, if.vi.
In view of the importance of this assem
blage and of Its deliberations, and of the hon
ors and hospitalities accorded to our repre
sentatives oy otner countries on similar occa
sions, I earnestly hope that such an appropri
ation will be made for the expenses necessa
rily attendant upon the coming meeting in our
capital city, as well be worthy of our na
tional hospitality and indicative of our appre
ciation of the event.
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT,
Construction of Our New Navy.
The work of the navy department and its
present conditions are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. The construction of
vessels for our new navy has been energetic
ally prosecuted by the present administration
upon the general lines previously adopted, the
department having seen no necessity for radi
cal changes in prior methods under which the
work was found to be progressing in a manner
highly satisfactory. It has been decid d, how
ever, to provide In every ship-building con
tract that the builder should pay all trial ex
penses, and it has also been determined to pay
no speed premiums In future contracts.
The premiums recently earned and some yet
to be decided are features of tne contracts
made before this conclusion was reached.
On March 4. 1893, there were in commission
but two armored vessels, the double-turreted
monitors Mlantonomoh and Monterey. Since
that date, of vessels ;theretofore authorized,
there have been placed In their first commis
sion three first-class and two second-class bat
tleships, two armored cruisers, one
harbor-defense ram, and five double
turreted monitors, including the Maine
and the Puritan, just completed.
Eight new unarmorcd cruisers and two new
gunboats have also been commissioned. The
Iowa, another battleship, will be completed
about March 1, and at least four more gunboats
will be ready for sea in the early spring.
The War College.
The war college has developed into an insti
tution which it is believed will be of great
value to tbe navy, in teaching tbe science of
war as well as in stimulating professional zeal
in the navy, and it will be especially useful la
the devising of plans for the utilization, in
case of necessity, of all the naval resources of
the United States. The secretary has per
sistently adhered to the plan he found In oper
ation for securing labor at navy yards, through
boards of labor employment, and has done
much to make it more complete and efficient
Discipline in the Service.
Discipline among tbe officers and men of the
navy has been maintained to a high standard,
and the percentage of American citizens en
listed has been very much Increased.
Tbe secretary is considering, and will formu
late during the coming winter, a plan for lay
ing up ships in reserve, thereby largely reduc
ing the cost cf maintaining our vessels afloat
The Naval Militia.
The naval militia, which was authorized a
few years ago, as an experiment, has now de
veloped into a body of enterprising young
men, active ard energetic in the discharge of
their duties, and promising great useful
ness, 'ibis establishment has nearly the same
relation to our navy as the national guard In
the different states bears to our army; and It
constitutes a source of supply for our naval
forces, the Importance of which Is immediate
ly apparent
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
E lormous Dlsbursemen I s.
The report of the secretary of the Interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting ex
hibit of the numerous and important affairs
committed to bis supervision, it is impossible
in this communication to more than briefly
refer to a few ot the sub
jects concerning which the secretary
gives full and instructive information.
Tho money appropriated on account of this
department, ana for its disbursement for the
fiscal year ended Juue 30, 1896. amounted to
more than $157 000. UK), or a greater sum than
was appropriated for the entire maintenance
of the government for the two fiscal years
ended June SO. 18C1.

Our public lands, originally amounting to
1 ,840,000 acres, have been so reduced that only
about 6o;.000,00 acres still remain in govern
ment control, excluding Alaska. Tbe bal

has been given uwsy to settlers, to new s.ates
and to railroads, or sold it a compsrauvoly

The Five Cifilised Tribes.
Tbe condition 6t affairs SmOhg thfl five civil
izeu tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in
the Indian territory; and who hate govern
ments of their own, has assumed such an s-
pect as to render it alinst fhdespnsable that
there should be an entire cu.iSS's inhe rela
tions of these Indians to the general grvsiH-
ment. This seems to be necessary in further
ance of their own interests, as well us for the
protcetloh of non-Indian residents in their ter

Utah Gilaonlte Deposits.
It appears that a very valuable deposit of
gllsonite or asphaltum has been found On ihe
reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom
paghre Ute Indians. Every consideration of
care for the public interest, and every sensible
business reason, dictate such management or
disposal of this important s;ource of public
revenue as will except it from tbe general
rUlfcs and incidents attending the Ordinary dis
position of public lands und secure to the gov
eminent a fair share, at least, of its advantages
in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to In
terested individualism.
A Permanent Indian Commission.
I indorse tbe recommendation made by tbe
present secretary of the interior, as weil as
his predecessor, that a permanent commission,
consisting of three members, one of whom
shall be an army officer, be created to perform
the duties now devolving upon the commls
sioner and assistaut commissioner of Indt&ri
affairs.
Tho Pension Roll.
Tbe diminution of our enormous pension roll
and the decreaso of pension expenditure which
have been so often confidently foretold still fall
In material realization. The number of pen
sioners on the roll at the close of the fiscal
year ended June 80, 1806, was 970,678. This is
the largest number ever reported. The amount
paid exclusively for pensions during the year
was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease from that
of the preceding year, while the total expendl
tures on account of pensions, including the
cost of maintaining the department and
expenses attending pension distribution,
amounted to $14"J,i:o6,r.i 0.50, or within a very
small fraction of one-third of the entire ex
pense of supporting the government during
the same year. The number of new pension
certificates issued was 90.640. Of these 40,374
represent original allowance of claims, and 15,-
b7 increases of exlsiting pensions. The nam
ber of persons receiving pensions from the
United States, but rosldlng in foreign countries
at the close of the last fiscal year, was 3,781,
and the amount paid to them during the year
was $582,735.38. The sum appropriated for the
payment of pensions for the current fiscal
year, ending June 10, 1897, is 140.(jOO,000, and
for the succeeding year it Is estimated that the
same amount will be necessary.
The commissioner of pensions reports that
during the last nscaiyear33. indictments were
round against violators of the pension laws
Upon these indictments 167 convictions re
sulted. Pacific Railroad Obligations.
The secretary calls attention to the public
interests involved in an adjustment ot tne od
ligations of the Pacific railroads to the govern
ment. I deem it to be an important duty to
especially present this subject to the consider
tion of the congress.
Under section 4 of the act of congress passed
March 3, 1887, the president is charged with
the duty in the event that any mortgage or
other incumbrance paramount to the Interest
or the United Sdates ln the Property of the
Pacific railroads shall exist and be lawfully
liable to be foreclosed, to direct the action of
the departments of the treasury and of justice
in the protection of the interest ot the United
States by redemption or through judicial pro
ceedings, Including foreclosures of the gov
ernment liens. In view of tbe fact that the
congress has for a number of years almost
constantly had under consideration various
plans for dealing with the conditions existing
between these roads and tbe government, I
have thus far felt justified in withholding ac
tion under the statute above mentioned.
An Urgent Situation.
In the case of the Union Pacific company,
however, the case has become especially and
immediately urgent. Proceedings have been
instituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon
these aided parts of the main lines upon
which the government holds a second and
subordinate mortgage lien. In consequence of
these proceedings ana increasing complica
tions, added to the default occurring on the
first day of January, lr97, a condition will be
presented at that date, so far as this company
is concerned, that must emphasize the man
date of the act of 1887 and give to executive
duty under its provisions a more important
aspect. it
'.therefore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct or shall have previously determined
upon a different solution of the problem there
will hardy appear to exist any reason for de
laying, beyond the date ot the default above
mentioned, such executive action as will prom
ise to subserve the public interests and save
the government from the loss threatened by
further Inaction.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
Worthy of Constant Care and Encourage
ment.
The department of agriculture is so Inti
mately related to the welfare of our people and
the prosperity of our nation that it
should constantly receive the care
and encouragement of the government.
From a small beginning it has grown to be
the center of agricultural Intelligence and the
source of aid and encouragement to agricul
tural errorts. Large sums of money are an
nually appropriated for tbe maintenance of
this department, and it must be confessed that
the legislation relating to It has always been
directed in the interest of practical farming or
properly guarded against waste and extrava
gance, ho far, however, as public money has
been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
those who actualiy till the soil, no expenditure
has been more profitably made or more gener
ally approved by the people.
Exports ot Farm Products.
The secretary reports that the value of our
exports of farm products during the last fiscal
yearamouuttd to $5."0,000,000, an Increase of
I7,',OO.UOO over these of the year immediately
preceding.
This statement is not tne lef s welcome be
cause of the fact that, notwithstanding such in
crease, the proportion of exported agricultural
products to our total exports or all descrip
tions fell off during te year. The benefits of
an increase in agricultural products being as
sured, the decrease ln its proportion to our
total export is the more gratirying when we
consider that it is owing to the fact that such
total exoorts for the year increased more than
75,&.i0.000.
(iratultous Distribution of Seeds.
In my opinion the gratuitous distribution of
seeds by the department, as at present con
ducted, ought to be discontinued. No one can
re d the statement or tne secretary on this
subject and doubt the extravagance and ques
tionable results or tnis practice. Tne pro
fessed friends of the farmer, and certainly the
farmers themselves, are naturally expected to
be willing to rid a department devoted to the
promotion of farming interests of a feature
which tends so much to its discredit

tions are related to weather conditions.
CIVIL-SERVICE REFORM.
A CSuse for Congratulation.
Tbe progress made in civil-service reform
furnishes a cause for tbe utmost congratula
tion. It has survived tbe doubts of Its friends
as well as tbe rancor of its enemies, and has
gaiued a permanent place among the agencies
destined to cleanse cur pontics, ana to im
prove, economize and elevate the public serv
ice. There arc notr in the competitive classified
service utiwaru of fcl iOU maces. More than
bl or these by6 bess iscfudsd trm tiot V9

nd sweeping extenswn was made by execu
tive Order, rs6Scd the th day of May, 1806.
And if foufth-elass postmastersbips are not
included in the statement it may be ssld that
pra"i!aHy all positions contemplated by the
civil service aw arc nov classified.
The annual rejJort of the commis ioners will
be duly transmitted, afJ commend the Im
portant matter they hav In sbaigo to the
careful consideration of oongress.
Inter-State Commerce.
The inter state commerce commission has,
dnflng the last year, supplied abun.iant evi
dence of Its usefulness and the importance of
the work committed to its charge. Public
transportation is a universal necessity, and
the qOestlon of just and reasonable charges
thcrofor has become of vital importance, not
only to shippers anil carriers, but also to the
vast multitude of producers and consumers.
In view of the judicial interpretation which
soifl provisions of this statute have received
and the CMets disclosed by the efforts made
for Its enforcefnnf, Us revision and amend
ment appear to be eSsssv'l, to the end that it
may more effectually reaCn the evils designed
to be corrected. I hope the recommendations
of the commission upon this s-ub'ect will be
promptly and favorably considered by the con-
res.
- tUK TARIFF QUESTION.
Suggestions Touching the Present Law
Snd Its Operations.
I desire to recur to the statements elsewhere
made concerning the government's receipts
and expenditures for the purpose of venturing
upon some suggestions touching" pur present
tariff law and its operation.
This statuto took effect on the 28th d ot
Augusfc, ItH, Whatever muy be its shortcom
ings as a complet measure of tariff reform, it
must be conceded that has opened the way
to a freer and greater exchange of commodi
ties between the United States and other
countries, and thus furnished a wider market
for our products and manufacturers. The only
entirtf fiscal year during which this law has
been enforced ended on tbe 30th day of June,
1888. In that year out imports increased over
those Of the previous year more than J6.500,000,
while" lfe value of domestic products we ex
ported, and whish found markets abroad, was
nearly S70,OCO,000 more than during the pre
ceding yeaf.
Those who insist that the cosi to our people
of articles coming to them from abroad lor
their needful use should only be increased
through tariff charges to an extent necessary
to meet the expenses of the government, as
well as those who claim that tariff charges
may be laid Upon such articles beyond the
necessities of goternment revenue, and with the
additional purpose of so increasing their price
In our markets as to give American manufac
turers and producers bettsr and more profita
ble opportunities, must agred that our tarlll
laws are only primarily justified fls sources of
revenue to enable the government td meet the
necessary expenses of Its maintenance, pon
sldereaa to its sufficiency in this aspect, the
present law cafi by no means fall jnder just
condemnation. DuriH tho only complete
fiscal year of its operatlori it has yielded neai
lv IK.000.000 more revenue than was received
from tariff duties in the preceding year. There
was, nevertheless, a deficit between onir re
ceipts and expenditures of a little more than
125,000.000. This, however, was not unexpected.
Th8 situation was such in December last, seven
months before the close of the fiscal year, that
the secretary of the treasury foretold a defi
ciency Of $17,000,000,
Need Not Excite or Disturb Us.
In the meantime no deficit that has occurred
or may occur need excite or disturb us. To
meet ahv such deficit in tile treasury, in addi
tion to a gold reserve of f l: O.OW.OiA), a surplus
of more than $128,000,000 applicable to the pay
ment of the expenses of the government, and
which must, unless expended for that purpose,
remain a useless hoard; or. if not extravagant
ly wasted, must in any event be perverteu rom
the purpose of its exaction from our pcopiu,
The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in
the revenue from this fund is nothing more
than Its proper and legitimate use.
A Matter of Supremo Importance.
I suppose it will not be denied that under
the present law our people obtain the neces
saries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper
rate than formerly. This is a matter of supreme
Importance, since it is the talpable duty or
every just government to make tho burdens of
taxation as light as possible. The people
should not be required to relinquish this
privilege of cheaper living except under the
stress of their government's necessity made
plainly manifest.
OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
Weakness and Vices of Our Present
Method.
This reference to the conditions and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests an
allusion to the weakness and vices of our finan
cial method. They have been frequently
Dressed upon the attention of congress in
previous communications and tho Inevitable
danger of their continued toleration pointed
out. Without now repeating these details, I
can not refrain from again earnestly present
ing the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule of sound finance
and shown by experience to be fraught with
the gravest peril and perplexity.
Withdrawals of Gold Obligations.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from its depressing influence, this should
not lull us Into a false security, nor 1 ad us to
forget the suddenness of past visitations. I arn
more convinced than ever that we can have
no assured financial peace and safety until the
government currency obligations upon which
gold may be demanded from the treasury are
withdrawn from circulation and cancelled.
This might be done, as has been heretoforo
recommended, by their exchange for long
term bonds bearing a low rate of Interest or
by their redemption with the proceeds of such
bonds.
This plan of issuing bonds for tho purpose of
redemption certainly appears to be the most
effectlvo and direct path to the needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would be a step
in the right direction If currency obligations,
redeemable ln gold whenever so redeemed,
should be cancelled instead of reissued. This
operation would be a slow remedy, but It would
improve present conditions.
National I tank Notes.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. Tbey should be allowed to Issue circu
lation to the par value or bonds deposited as
security for redemption, and the tax on their
circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of
one percent.
in considering projects ror tne retirement or
the United States notes and treasury notes is
sued under the new law of 1890, 1 am of the
opinion we have placed too much stress upon
the danger of contracting the currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold that
would be added to our circulation if invited to
us by better and safer financial methods. It is
not so much contraction of our currency that
should be avoided as its unequal distribution.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methods will not dawn uion us until
our government abandons the banking busi
ness and the accumulation or runos, ana con
fines Its monetary operations to the receipt of
the money contributed by the people for its
support, and the expenditure of such money
for the people's benefit ;Our business Interests
and all good citizens long for rest from fever
ish agitation, and tho Inauguration by the
government of a reformed financial policy
which wiil encourage enterprise and make
certain the rewards of labor and Industry.
MONOPOLY.
Trusts and Other Aggreg itlons of Capital.
Another topic in which our people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. I refer to the existence of trusts and
other huge aggregations of capital, the object
of which is to secure tbe monopoly of some
particular branch or trade, industry or com
merce, and to stifle wholesome competition.
When these are deferded it is usually on the
ground that, though they increase prices, they
also reduce prices, ana tnus may oenent tne
public. It must be remembered, however, that
a reduction of prices to tbe people is not one of
the real objects ot these organizations, nor is
their tendency necessarily in that direction.
If it occurs ln a particular case It Is only be
cause It accords with the purposes or Interests
of those managing the scheme.
Though congress has attemped to deal witn
this matter bv legislation, the laws passed for
that purpose thus far have proved ineffective,
not because of any lack of disposition or at
tempt to enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves, as Interpreted by the courts.
do not reach the difficulty. If the Insufficiencies
of existing laws can be remedied by ;further
legislation, it should oe aone.
An Appeal for Economy.
In concluding this communication. Its last
words shall be an appeal to the congress for
the most rigid economy ln the expenditure of
tbe money it holds ln trust for the people.
The way to pemlexing extravagance Is easy,
but a return to frugality is difficult. When,
however, it Is considered that those who bear
the burdens of taxation have guaranty of
honest care save in tbe fidelity of tbelr pub
lic servants, the duty of all possible retrench
ment Is plainly manifest.
When our differences are forgotten, and our
contests of political opinion arc no longer re
membered, nothing in the retrospect of our
public service will be as fortunate and com
forting as the recollection of official duty well
performed, ana the memory of a conktaut de
votion to the interests of our confiding fellow '
countrymen. Gsotkb Clxv&lamp, I
