The Btatc of Alabama Is the twenty,
tevcnth that has ratified tui Constitu
tional Amendment. "This makes three
fourths of tho number df States that
existed previous to the admission of
Colorado. It Is. now understood that
one more State is necessary, and If the
"Alexandria ratification" be adopted by
the Virginia Jslature now in session
8t Richmond, the requisite S?r -ill
lave been obtained. It is morally cer
tain that New Jersey will ratify at the
earliest possible moment and in any
event it Is perfectly clear that the doom
Of slavery is forever sealed. .
This day, therefore, the Seventh of
December 18C5, Is a day of National
Jubilee. From the Atlantic to the Pa
cific, from the Lakes to the Gulf,
our land is free. What the poet said of
New England is now essentially true of
the whole land ; ,.
"No slave is here ; our unchained feet
Walk freely as the waves that beat
Our coasts."
Is not this a cause of thankfulness 1
Everv one that rejoices In human pro
gress and human rihta every one that
has deplored t he misery una ut-giuu
inn r tin. African slave every one
that detests a proud and cruel aristo
cracy must thankfully rejoice that the
one has been disenthralled, the other
humbled, ami the great cause of human
advancement has been accelerated.
We are also enjoying the luxury of
peace. We can hardly indeed assure
ourselves that the war is really ended.
Our neighbors on the North and on the
South are in a state of commotion.
Wars and rumors of wars are heard in
the distance, but they need not, and do
not trouble us. We have conquered a
peace among ourselves, aud doubtless
we may enjoy it, and assuredly we
ought to be thankful. No longer do we
hear the calls for "500,000 more." There
Is no more drafting no straining every
nerve to raise bounties for recruits and
substitutes ho drills, and marches and
countermarches no heart rending de
partures and leave-takings no crushing
Bull Run defeats no more Gettysburgs
and Winchesters no longer do the mel
ancholy lists of casualties come pour
ing in . upon us. There are no more
Fort Pillows, Llbby Prisons or Ander-
' sonyllles. For all this let us be thank -
' ful. - ' '
Again we live In a most eventful pe
riod, .The. history of a generation, a
century, is crowded into one Olympiad,
and eucn an Olympiad! What an
arena ! ' What a prize at stake ! , What
'. an. absorbing and breathless interest on
the part of the observing millions!
What alternations of hope and despond
ency! What a glorious triumph at
- last ! What themes for the Homers and
the Xenonhons who shall in "winged
- words" declare these exploits to future
generations! Notwithstanding all the
, .ntin-erin!rR. bereavements and losses of
r- which almost every-household in this
; ;: land ahd this State has had a share, we
;.' ought to be.thankful that we are thus
0 counted worthv. 'Even a heathen could
say "It is sweet 'and honorable to die
,v for one's country." It has, been our
.v. nrivllece to' suffer and to triumph for
the benefit of posterity and humanity.
Our Autumnal Festival occurs this
' "rear .from ten ' to fourteen days later
V than has been usual for bur New' Eng
- land : Thanksgiving-r-but every one of
those davs has furnished some addition
's al cause for thankfulness. Let us ob-
. serve the day In an appropriate and be-
cominrr manner. "Let.u8"noitorsai

fits the members of a,ctiristian'commu
; nity, put join in exercises of praise and
thanksgiving to the Author of all our
' 1 ' temporial and spiritual blessings.

f BBBArE to Gbn. Banks. A num-
l ' berofthe citizens of Louisiana, now in
Washington, headed by the uon
Michael Halm, serenaded Gen. Banks
Tuesdav night at the Ebbett House.
Gen. Banks responded to the compli-
" '' ment at some length. In the' course of
, his remarks b.e spoke of the unity of
: sentiment apparent in Congress against
T the admission of Southern Oongress-
" men, and approved the sentiments of
the President's message tnat treason i
r a crime and must be made odious, and
... rebellion forever rendered an impossi
hilltv. He defended his course in Lou
Isiana and declared that it had the full
"! approval of President Lincoln. He
' : thought the future bright for the pro-,7-ir
gress of freedom and humanity, and re
4 garded the President's message as an
t admirable document:
the constitution by apportioning Con
gressional representation according to
the number of voters, aud to allow ne
groes to vote In the DUTM 0f Co
lumbia. , .

Nbw Yobk City Eikction. The New
York Tribune, which supported Hecker,
says : "The charter election on Tues
day resulted badly. Most of the Union

ascendency, whereby they drove thou
sands of Democrats back to Tammany
Hall, aud elected its caudidate for May

Tub I'kesidknt's Messaok. Our
city exchanges came to us yesterday af
ternoon with extra sheets, and all
freielited with the Message, and the Re
ports of the different members of the
Cabinet. Ou all sides we ilud nothing
but the most unqualified expressions of
approbation of the Message.
The iluaucial editor of the New York
Times says :
"The admirable Message of the Presi
dent of the United States will be fouud
of great significance m strengtnening
iluaucial confidence. Its hearty and
determined support of the public credit;
its proud survey of the resources of the
country; its earnestness in favor of
public economy aud enlarged and gener
ous taxation, looking to the rapid liqui
dation of the public debt ; its indorse
ment of the early reduction of the army
to a moderate peace establishment to
cost less than forty millions a year, and
Us entire freedom from anything like a
hasty distrust or belligerent attitude,
on our foreign relations, all unite to
commend this great document to the re
spect and warn! acceptance of the Mer
chant, the Banker, and Fundholder, in
common with people at large.
The Dassaces in the message wnicn
were applauded in the nouse during the
reading were those asserting that trait
ors should be punished, the offense
made infamous, and at the same time
the question judicially settled unany
aud forever that no state of its own
will has the right to renounce Its place
In the Union ; that a tax on travel ana
merchandise in their transit constitutes
one of the worst forms of monopoly;
and the evil is increased if coupled with
denial of a choice of route, and the
President's declaration that the justifi
cation of Enalawl in fitting out cruisers
during the rebelfion cannot be sustained
before the tribunal of nations, and that
the friendship between the two coun
tries must herealter rest ou tne oasis oi
mutual justice. Tlie upplauso vmen
this part of the message was read was

the firm of French & Kingsley, in the

was closely Identified with all its inter
ests. At the time of his de ath, and foa
a considerable time previous, he held
the otllce of Corporation Clerk, lie was
an euterprising, honest, public spirited
business man. This loss is a deep oue
to society, friends aud family. The

take place on Friday, (to-morrow,) at
one o'clock, at the late residence of the
deceased, and at the Congregational
Church at half past. one.

Notice was given of bidls to revive the
grade of general in the army, to amend
Cahamaw Smuggling. The Commis
sioner or Customs is convinced, irom
the character or the reports which he is
daily receiving from the Canadian iron
tier, that his action in employing female
detectives there was judicious, and will
be of great benefit in the exposure ana
arrest of the female smugglers, who have
recently been so extensively engaged in
the contraband trade Detween uanaaa
and the United States. Not one female
smnsslernow crosses the line where
twenty crossed before, and merchants
alonsr the border, suspected or naving
formerly been engaged in the contraband
trade, are closing their stores and sell
ins out. '
Another smnsclme dodge upon the
Canadian border has just been detected.
An "unusual number of coffins nave been
brought across the line of late for inter

when, instead of a defunct body, the
coffin was found filled with costly silks.
Thb Release of Seddos and Ma-
OBAth. The Savannah Republican gives
the particulars of the release of J. a.
Seddon. late War Secretary oi the Con
federate States, and A. J . ftiagratn, ex-
Governor of South Carolina, in compli
ance with orders from the President.
On Saturday, ,25th ult., Captain Clark
H. Remlck, Provost Marsnai oi .savan
nah, received instructions to proceed
forthwith in the steamboat Starlight to
Fort Pulaski, where both prisoners were
detained, and set them at liberty. The
order was duly obeyed. Capt. Remick
having announced to the prisoners their
release on condition of taking the am
nesty oath, the news was received by
both with joy and the oath freely taken.
Gov. Magrath seemed in exultant health
and spirits. He conversed freely on
general topics during the trip to Savan
nah and seemed heartily to enjoy the
fine weather. Mr.1 Seddon, though not
less cheerful, seemed to have held out
with less force against the inroads which
a long confinement must necessarily
make upon the constitution of even the
strongest man. He was pale, haggard
and careworn.which gave a very gloomy
and sad exnression to his regularly
fnrmpd featnres. The first moments of
excitement, In consequence of their hasty
release, having passed away, towards
the end of the trip both prisoners be
came silent aud pensive, and all further
efforts to draw them back to lively con
versation proved unavailing.
Death in the State Prison. The
Boston Herald of Tuesday says :
" Last Friday Arthur Laverv was sen
tenced to three years' imprisonment in
the Massachusetts State Prison at
Charleston for the ronrdr of John M.
Mario w. whom he stabbed in the eye a
few weeks ago. Lavery was in feeble
health at the time of his sentence, and
this morning died, thus quickly taking
an anneal from the sentence of man to
the Court where Justice never once
swerves from the right track."

A Good Bi rlsuuk ov Carl lb. Mr
Carljle having been elected rector of
the uuiversity of Ediuburg, the London
Spectator coucocts the following speech,
which it supposes him to address to the
students of the university, In which his
grotesque style is admirably taken oil';
"I am credibly Informed, my young
brothers and lVllow-learuers, that a
worthy friend of mine, with discern
ments quite beyond the common, has In
these present times undertaken to teach
you of this university somethlng(ainong
others) that men call rhetoric and let
tersutterances of great men in thin
common tongue of ours, aud the power
resulting thence to all true learners
among you, with leave of favoring na
ture, of distinctly articulating such
word of God as may be in you: if such
word be already there. If such word
be already there ! here is the grand con
dition of all true ultcrauce, without
which rhetoric professors, with huge
midwife apparatus of various discern
ments, can do nothing for you but de
liver you of-dark, extensive moon calves
metaphysic abortions, wnie-conea mon
strosities of ineffable '.oolishness, such
as it were better for the world, not
hitherto to have seen. Rhetoric profes
sors, my young brothers, of howsoever
various discernments, can at most help
you to articulate such true word as may
be in each of you, and n, in your cnaot
1c, yeasty llounderiugs of blind desire
you canuot yet find such word, may in
stead thereof surely help yon to lose
such word, beyond hope of ultimate
finding, in froth oceans oi logical jar
gon, dismal science formulas, aud scsl
ences 'called pure." In which too pos
sible case, not I, but the solemn fact
of the universe, must warn you, at peri
of drowning forever in said froth-oceans
of logical jargon, to desist from long
eared hallelujahs and laudatory psalm
ody, to middle-class education, sciences
called pure,' university extension, aud
the like, and retire into the silences, till
you can catch some audioie wnisper oi
an everlasting yea announcing, as with
a clap of thunder, what sort oi Douy pil
grimage nature ana met nave unjuiueu
upon you, under peril of your soul, iu
this distracted universe to pursue."

Spais ; akd J Chili. The conduct of
Spain towards Chill meets with strong
and unanimous disapprobation tnrougn
out Europe. The mercantile classes or
gently call upon their Government to
prevent Spain from injuring tne inter
Thk Constitutional Ammpment.
Both the Carolinas and Alabama have
indorsed the Constitutional Amendment
abolishing slavery ; but we hear no rea
son assigned for the failure of the Leg
islature of Mississippi to take action
upon it. We would not hasten them in
the matter, but we should like to see
them hasten themselves. They put
forth no objections to the measure ; they
proclaim their conviction of the utter
and final extinction or slavery, ana al
lege that in no event will they attempt
to revive it Yet they do not give their
sanction to the national measure of con
stitutional abolition. We had hoped
that it would be put through all all
the Southern State Legislatures this
Winter. We still trust that this hope
will not be disappointed. If New Jer
sey ratifies it, as she will, what shall we
think el Mississippi or Ueorgia, it tney
fail to ratify It. .v. T. Tina.

A Serviceable coat. Many years
since, an old German citizen of Pendle
ton county, Va.. when aoout to lead nis
fair "frow," to the Hymeneal altar, pur
chased a broadcloth coat in which he
was married. His wife presented him
with many children, among whom were
eight sons, every one of whom were
married in the same eoat in which their
fathermarried their molher.Theyonngest
of the eight sons, had seven sons, every
one of whom were married in the same
wedding coat, aud after the youngest
son of the seven, or the youngest grand
sou of the original owner of the coat,
had led his blushing bride to the altar
In his venerable grandfather's fashion
able wedding coat.he sold it for the sum
of ten dollars. What has become of the
coat since it was sold, we have not been
advised, but suppose that some one is
keeping it for the purpose of getting
married in it. As there seems to be pe
culiar matrimonial virtue in this re
markable coat, old bachelors would
doubtless, give a'hish price for it. If it
has brass buttons on it, it would better
not be brought to this place for some
vigilant federal soldier, jealously guard
ing the honor or dignity of the govern
ment, would cut them off "in the twink
ling of an eye."
Soldier, spare that coat, touch not a
single button. Staunton Speculator.
