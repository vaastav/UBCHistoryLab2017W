Like almost ail of Mr Vardanian - utterances, the statement is
absolutely illogical; it has neither width or depth and is chiefly re
markable for its length and for its fury.

and shows that his capacity for the invisible is no less wanting than
his capacity for the visible. Figures and dollar marks have always

The Senator is grossly in error in thinking that the people

aggression.
The President has shown iy Ins attitude toward Mexico
lhatheis not a war-making President: he has shown the same
thing in his efforts and success in pre-erviiig the neutrality of this
country as regards the present war, hence it can not be justly and
truthfully urged that he is a believer in blood and thunder,
a messenger of peace and a believer in peace.
The Senator's acknowledged vanity and pompousness nc doubt
leads him to say, "all sorts of schemes are being devised to mislead
the people and obscure the truth." To him and him alone bt longs

Council evidently did not pass what was passed or let it "pass" it.
Our city law-makers marched up the hill and down again, but acted
wisely in calling off the election for the reason that it was a fore
gone conclusion that no affirmative action would be taken by the
vott rs of the town on any of the propositions submitted because
of the lact they were all presented in a lump. Were an election
ordered and the propositions suggested offered separately, no doubt
some of them would carry.
DOES THE READER OF THIS OWE US?
Two weeks ago we reminded those indebted to this office of
their obligations. Since then quite a large number have paid but
there is a very much larger number that have not paid. We need
the money and we trust that we shall not feel the necessity soon of
repeating this reminder.
A THOUGHT FOR A WEEK.
If any one speak ill of Iliee, consider whether he hath truth on
his side; if so, reform thyself, that his censures may not affect thee.

"The Karl of Coahoma" can always be relied upon to be there
at the right time with the goods. He seems to be a very live factor
just now in the business world. He has labored hard to apply the
same business intelligence to the Stale's affairs that he has his own,
although he has been very much hampered in this regard.

Moriti framing in the Public Schools;
By \V. D. Hu'ileston, Professor of
Philosophy and Ethics U. of M.
This question is confused in the
minds of some people with religious
training in the public schools. There is
room for difference of opinion as to the
advisability of giving religious training
by an institution of the state or by any
agency not under the direction of th^
church. But there should be no differ
ence of opinion as to the advisability of
giving moral training by any and ev
ery agency we have for training the
mind. The same reasons hold good for
giving moral training in the public
schools which may be given for such
training in the Sunday schools.
The division of our people into relig
ious parties or sects, is along religious
or theological lines of cleavage and
have no reference to moral ideas. The
question is not whether moral training
shall be given in the public schools, but
whether it shall be given systematically
and under intelligent supervision. Moral
training is given by all activities and
experiences of life. The public school
here most children acquire their
notions of things and of conduct; or at
least, is where their notions are modi
fied and fixed. They are being trained
morally, hut the training is not satis
factory. It should be given eystemati
cally and under proper supervision.
This article is written primarily to
call the attention of the public, and es
pecially of school trustees, to a lucid
and eminently practical plan for such
instruction given in the Hand Book for
Mississippi Teachers, 1912-1916, on pages
25-27. This book is in the hands of the
teachers of the state, and every school
trustee should read these pages.
This is a matter of much importance.

This is a Progressive Age
New discoveries are constantly being
made that benefit humanity more or
less according to the necessity or de
mand for an improvement over old
methods.
On account of the dangerous, as well
as unpleasant, after-effects of Calomel,
men of science have been patiently
searching for a substitute for it.
Calomel acts too violently on your
liver, causeB you to lose time from your
work, and is liable at any time to sali
vate you. Science has at last dis
covered a substitute for Calomel which
is called Lemolac.
You will find Lemolac a real liver
medicine that possesses the virtues of
Calomel without its unpleasant and of
ten dangerous after effects.
Lemolac is pleasant to take, and as
it does not salivate, is certain to fill a
long felt want. Try a bottle at our
risk.
P. S. — If you forget the name spell

SO EASY.
So easy to 9ay what another should do.
So easy to settle his cares,
So easy to tell him what road to pursue
And dispose of the burdens he bears.
It is easy to bid him be brave and be strong,
And to make all his short-comings known,
But O, it's so hard when the care and the wrong
And the dangers we face are our own.
It is easy to stand in the other man's place
When our comforts of life are assured,
And the sting'of the rain beating sharp in his face
By him must be bravely endured.
It is easy to tell him the path he should take
And to bid him to laugh at his care.
But 0 it's so hard when it's our hearts that ache
And we have the burden to bear.
We all know the things that another Bhould do,
His faults are like books on our shelves,
We can ponder them over and read and review,
But we haven't a book on ourselves.
We can settle the other man's problems each day.
His griefs we can calmly discuss.
It is easv to sweep all his troubles away,
But we can't do the same thing for us.
The need of another it's easy to see.
When our own wants are all satisfied,
Brave arid courageous it's easy to be
When it isn't our souls that are tried.
But O it's so hard when we're stumbling along
To keep ourselves steadfast and true;
It is easy to tell some one else to be strong,
It's easier to tell than to do.
-Edgar A. Guest, in Detroit Free Press.
