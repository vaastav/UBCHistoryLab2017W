THE EXPOSITION BUILDING ASSURED.
At lust it may safely In; said that the Okla
homa buildiiiK at the I'aiiumii Pacific exposition
at Kan Franeineo is assured. The meitiiiers of the
'handier of (Inmimerce and (iovernoi-Kleet Nil-
ltamii have become interested in it and will help
push it to completion.
It ia proponed to have the state appropriate
irfi.OOO for the maintenance of the building, and
there will be other ways of ruining money, l'resi
deut I'oleord of the Chamber of Cnnimrce has ap
pointed a committee composed of strong business
men to assure the exposition authorities that the
Oklahoma building will be erected This will re-,
ult in holding the site, which there wan danger'
of losing.
Oklahoma citizens have not done as well us they
might have done in the effort to raise fiutds for
the state building at the big exposition, hut per
haps they are not to blame. The efforts of tliosewho
took upon themselves the burden of raising tin)
funds have been most admirable. They have par
tially Hiieeeedeil, and they have worked ceaselessly
to accomplish the task.
It is fitting that others should come in now and
pivo their assistance. The wealthy men (if the stato
owe it to Oklahoma to help with the effort. They
should make up all that is lacking without being
asked for it. It is also proper that the state should ',
help with an appropriation.
At any rate Oklahoma niusl be represented nt
the Panama -I'aeifie exposition nt San Francisco
next year and there must be a creditable building
anil exhibit for this state. Hvery resident known
that it would he disc reditable to the state to not
le represented. The proposed appropriation of j
"i,fi(W to maintain the btiildiiiL' which (Vivertior t
Williams will ask is not too larire a sum.
How long the individual may expect to live hits
been a subject of dispute for a very long time and
it remains unsettled. One of the well known phy
sicians of this country declares that he is going to
live 120 years, lie has lived now between seventy
and eighty of them and declares that no youngster
of twenty ia more Hlert and has better health
than he.
Premier Okumn of Japan declares that he in
tends to live to be 12fi years and insists that there
is no reason in the nature of things why the aver
age life of mankind should not be at least HK
assuming naturally that accidents arc barrel or es
caped. Miinv will hold that such aspirations arc sub
ject to discount and yet thre arc so main ex
amples of tl catenarian and of these who live
ciiite a number of years beyond the completion of
a century, to encourage others into the hope that
by right oiethods of liv in.' h 'v can have far longer
span of life than is the rule.
One difficulty is to know what is the right
kind of living for each cnnstittiti.oi and tempera
ment. The only thing to be avoided in this mat
ter perhaos is (on Treat solicitude uu. I too much
concern for the things of this life and I lie n''xt
that bear upon it.
People who are till the while Linking for symp
loins of illness find them just as often ss thev look
diligently, iusl as people who look f ir trouble are
all the while g"titi'' into it. Hut those who take
care of their health as a mutter of course and
withoul thinking much about it. because busier
with things so much more important, arc more npt
to live to s good old nee thin those who are
troubled about a pond many things.

BASIS OF THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.
Agriculture is the basis of the country's wealth.
That fact has been admitted for years and years.
The fnrm wealth of the I'nited States is now esti
mated at forty billions, but lit the snme time the
farmer is expei-piicing many drawbacks and diffi
culty in tuakinir both ends niee.t.
At the Interstate Agricultural congress at St.
Joseph, V. C. Hrown, former railroad president,
and now an lows farmer, said: "The establish
ment of farm credits is one of the most important
qnetioiiH now before the nation. The farmer is
paying twice the interest he should. Long time
loans at a low rate would enable the farmer to
properly finance his work, and it is in this financ
ing upon which depends to a large defree the
prosperity of the country "
There has been a considerable expenditure of
sentiment on the " Intel,-to the farm movement"
Meeanse our cities are filling up with foreigners
the political economists and other people who are
endeavoring to benefit their fcllowmcn have an
idea that stricter attention to agriculture will fur
nish employment for thousands, and result in an
increase in food products.
Tf the farmer can not secure credit his ease is
hopeless. If he can secure credit he should not be
called upon to pay interest which will reduce his
yearly profits to n minimum. The period when
the agriculturist seeks to move his crops is de
cidedly trying. If he can not secure transporta
tion his labor comes to naught. Between high in
terest and lack of transportation the avera
farmer experiences difficulty in making both ends
meet.
Of course there are very prosperous agricul
turists, hnt they are the exception. The estali
lisrrnient of farm credits oncht to work wonders.
There can be no doubt that the innovation would
at least sate thousands of tillers of the soil from
going to the wall.
It is ani'tvim-ed that the Vobcl peace prize will

one. In some ipinrt'Tv it Is explained that there

th' multitudes of good citizens who nrc entire!-

enmstanees of the vefir All thnt nny head of n j
neutral power could do would be to suggest medi

cause it is triu'ly impossible for anyone to tell
what there is to arbitrate or whaj should he the

MAKES REQUE8T FOR AN INDIAN DAY.
SOME CABINET CHANGES RUMORED.
Tt would be strange indeed if there were no
peculation about cabinet changes when the mein
Vers of that body are found arguing ia their re
ports against the position of the president him
self.
President Wilson's speech in the form of an
annual message ridiculed the idea of investigation
of preparation for defense, but tho secretary of
war minimized our resources and urged very
strongly that because our militia amounts to lit
tle and the regular army is small, there should
be an expansion of the army on the regular es
tablishment by many thousands more than is the
present legal allowance.
" It would bo n good thing if nrmy expansion
were made automatic. That is, prowirtioaed to
thn number of people in the union and th amount
of work; that " the army has to do. Si'ieh a basis
oould readilj be established and the plan tlien
followed out; without the perpetual friction.
It took thirty years' work and then required
a Secretary Krtot to get the army reor(ranised from
the old, Inefficient and antiquated basis to tba
modern one of toond organisation m far aa It
ffoea. ,, Perhaps aome other secretary of war will
be influential enough to put the matter of array
Americans ar little aid to do things as others
do them 1 sat March an Indian of the blood tribe
known ns Red For James started from the Crow
agency in Montana to go to Washington on horse
back and represent to the president the desire of
his tribe to have some day in the autumn pro
claimed as Indian day, to be observed nil over
the United States in' memory of what the Tndinn
has meant to America. '
Perhaps Red Fox James will succeed in his
ouest. It is said that in bis riding across the eon
fitrent he has been very cordially received by the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
oddly enourrh, snd that society 1ms taken in hand
th task of shoeing the bronco as often as there was
need of it. The camaraderie illustrated by such
a fact is not easy to estimate, though surely it Is
well understood
It requires an intense enthusiast ns well as a
v ery vigorous personage to mount a horse in Mon
tana and ride that horse dny after day to Wash
ington to present a petition that would be ear
ned by mail in three days nt the most and prob
ably would have about atreniueh weight with the
president if presented in thaf way ns If presented
in person by the rider after the long tramn.
Nevertheless if we all did things nlik we
would have a rather flavorless country and it is
noted with some source of pride that people read
of the expedition of Red Fo.x James and even
n ay hope that we shnll have another holiday add
ed, or nt least a day set apart in eomiaenajratlon
f the Indian. We shall see, of course, when we
leu returns from Washington on the subject.
